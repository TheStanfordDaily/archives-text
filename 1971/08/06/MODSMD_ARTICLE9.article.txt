The Christian Science Monitor
of July 28 contains an analysis by
David Mutch of the Supreme
Court decision in the Pentagon
papers cases. Mutch interviewed
experts in the field of constitu
tional law for the story.
Dr. Leonard W. Levy, whose
historical writings in the field of
press freedom have been called
"indispensable" by Henry Steele
Commanger, was quite pessimis
tic.
"I thought the issue of prior
restraint was settled," said Levy.
"The New York Times editorials
congratulating itself on this great
principled advance for freedom of
the press did not jibe with a very
accurate headline in the news
story: 'First Amendment rule held
to block most prior restraints.'
"I think this was not a
clear-cut victory for the principle
of no prior restraint. Another set
of facts, and another court, the

decision could have gone differ
ently."
Mutch goes on to quote from
Levy's book, "Legacy of Suppres
sion," on the "no prior restraint"
doctrine: "The common law's
definition of freedom of the press
meant merely the absence of
censorship in advance of publica
tion.
"But the presence of punish
ment afterwards, for 'bad senti
ments,' oral or published, had an
effect similar to a law authorizing
previous restraints."

Ralph Nader, the Superman of
responsible corporate liberalism,
has always enjoyed remarkably
favorable treatment in the press.
But the institutional structure
which the reforms that Nader
proposes would create in America
has received less attention than is
deserved. What Nader's plans
amount to is the creation of a
corporative state political econ
omy in the U.S.
In Campaign GM Round Two,
one of the major proposals was
for members of the board of
directors to represent constituen
cies, specifically consumers, deal
ers, and workers.
As Professor Henry G. Manne
of the University of Rochester

pointed out in the May 17
Barron's: "Only one instance in
modern political history is sug
gested by the constituent director
proposal.
"That was Mussolini's fascist
state, in which various social and
economic interests in society were
represented in the higher echelons
of government."
Similarly, CBS radio commen
tator Jeffrey St. John said on May
21: "Ralph Nader is indeed a
fascist. We use this term not as a
smear, but as an identification of
what Nader proposes .. . Nader
wants to go beyond the New Deal
to a corporate Fascist State on the
model set up by Mussolini in Italy
in the 1920'5.
"GM executives, at the same
time, are so void of understanding
what Nader is proposing that as an
expedient they have come to
adopt Nader's fascistic proposals
and call them 'social responsibil
ity.' "
Of course, the GM executives
might understand Nader's pro
posals and agree with them in
principle if not on specifics. One
must remember that many Ameri
can executives favored the New
Deal's National Recovery Admin
istration, which was modelled on
the corporate state administrative
bodies of Europe.

It is of major importance that
the conference committee com
promise amendment on American
withdrawal from Vietnam con
tains, as the New York Times of

July 31, put it: "no policy
direction, as in the original Mans
field amendment, that all Ameri
can troops should be withdrawn
from Indochina in nine months,
subject to the release of American
prisoners of war held by North
Vietnam."
But the importance of the
dilution of the withdrawal state
ment should not be allowed to
cause us to neglect the fact that in
handling the draft-extension bill
the "conferees violated the legisla
tive rules for conference commit
tees by reducing the pay increases
below the $27-billion level ap
proved by the House and Senate.
Under the Legislative Reorganiza
tion Act, conference committees
are not supposed to change points
that have been agreed upon by
both the House and Senate."
The conference committee's
reduction of the pay increases will
have the effect of prolonging the
existence of the conscription
system. In a subsequent editorial,
the Times argues that the pay
raise reduction is a good reason
why "neither house should rush
to endorse the compromised draft
legislation."
The Times of August 5, in
reporting House passage of the
conference committee's draft ex
tension bill, included this descrip
tion of the parliamentary tactics
used to evade the issue of the
alteration of the pay provisions of
the bill in conference:
"In the debate members of the
House Rules Committee acknow
ledged that the conferees had
violated the rules of the House
and the 1970 Congressional Re
organization Act... The bill was
thus subject to a parliamentary
point of order, which if raised
would have forced the legislation
back into conference.
"But at the insistence of Mr.
[F. Edward] Herbert (D-La.) and
House leaders, who wanted action
before the recess, the Rules
Committee granted a rule for
floor consideration of the bill that
prohibited any points of order
being raised by two junior Repub
licans—William A. Steiger of Wis
consin and James T. Broyhill of
North Carolina-who had sought
to do so."
