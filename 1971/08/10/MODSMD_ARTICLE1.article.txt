# Report Demands Firing Of Tresidder Director
## 
### MADELYN NELSON 
Tresidder Union's director and busi
ness manager should be fired because of
"their record of ineptitude in every
field of management," states an ASSU
committee report issued yesterday.
The ASSU Senate Investigations
Committee's report, commissioned by
the Senate and Council of Presidents,
blasts the current directors of the
student union for their personnel
practices and financial management.
It charges that Director Forrest
Tregea and Business Manager Phillip
Duffy are responsible for "services that
are few, poor in quality, expensive in
price, and unpleasant to experience."
The ASSU started the inquiry in the

spring, after 12 Tresidder workers were
laid off in February. Activists challeng
ed the Union with a boycott and
"alternative food service" throughout
spring quarter.
Undertaker Mentality
The 18-page report uses strong
language, charging Tresidder's need for
innovation cannot be filled by "men
with the mentality of undertakers."
Tregea said the report "seems to be
a number of distortions of fact;
allegations not supported by any kind
of evidence that's produced."
He charged the report was written
by "young men with conclusions in
search of evidence to prove them."
Scott Burke, a junior in philosophy,
chaired the Tresidder investigation. He
conceded he began with the assumption
"something was wrong at Tresidder."
He said he knew that because of
widespread student dissatisfaction and
because "I've eaten there."
But he denied that the committee
arrived at its verdict of inept manage
ment before its investigation began.
Committee Dispansion
In addition to its demand for a
change of management, the report
called for disbanding the nine member
Committee on Tresidder Union. It said
the committee does not effectively
supervise the Union because of its
"rubber stamp attitude."
Burke, who is also on the Tresidder
Union committee, said the three other
student members agree with the ASSU
report.
Burke also said the four students
will attempt to meet with President
Lyman and to circulate a petition
backing the report's recommendations.
But Tresidder committee chairman
Mason Yearian, a physics professor,
said, "I personally would like to
reiterate my confidence in Mr. Tregea's
direction of Tresidder, and I believe the

majority of the committee feels the
same way.
"Steps are being taken to improve
the Union every day," Yearian added.
Unfriendly Attitudes
The report said students complained
about the unfriendly attitudes of
Tresidder employees. Employees must
have a better attitude, the report said,
and this "cannot occur so long as
Tresidder's present management and its
present system of policy-making con
tinues, for they . . . are the source of
the problem"
The report claims employees' low
morale is caused by administrative
attitudes. It said the hiring of the
coffee house manager's wife as a coffee
house employee violates University
rules and is "the source of extreme
antagonism among coffee house work
ers toward the manager."
The investigators said employees are
often hired in a "completely arbitrary
fashion." They described the manage
ment attitude toward most workers as
"harsh, autocratic, and condescend
ing," but said personal friends of the
bosses receive special favors.
Asked about the report's charge that
one woman was given a Tresidder
owned TV set to use in her home,
Tregea said a woman who had "fallen
ill was provided with a television set for
a few days during her recuperative
period." He denied that favoritism was
involved.
Student Workers
The report said Tregea has failed to
back up his promise to review the
status of student workers, who are not
considered regular employees. The
students currently do not receive some
benefits available to other workers.
Beyond the specific allegations, the
report charges that decisions concern

ing workers are made without any
employee participation, "in the finest
tradition of the divine right kinds of
the 15th and 16th centuries."
Moving from personnel to finance,
the report said Tresidder is operating at
a loss because of "colossal blunders" in
financial decisions.
The report states that the February
layoffs, called an economy measure,
backfired and led to increased losses.
After the layoffs, monthly sales volume
was 20 percent lower in March than

one year before and 37 percent lower
in April, according to the committee.
The report claims the Tresidder
management neither understands nor
cares about the financial problems. It
quotes Tregea as saying, "It does not
really matter what the Food Service
makes. We don't need to know how
much an operation is making or
losing."
The committee recommended that
the University first fire Tregea and
Duffy and disband the Committee on
Tresidder Union. Then, the report said,

while a University office takes interim
responsibility for the Union, a student
worker-expert commission should de
sign a new organization for Tresidder.
Finally, the commission said final
approval for the reorganization of the
Union should come in a community
wide referendum.
The report was presented yesterday
morning to President Lyman with a
letter from Senate Chairman Mike
Dawson, who emphasized the "urgent
necessity for immediate action."

Asked about the report's charge that
one woman was given a Tresidder
owned TV set to use in her home,
Tregea said a woman who had "fallen

a few days during her recuperative

employee participation, "in the finest
tradition of the divine right kinds of
the 15th and 16th centuries."
Moving from personnel to finance,
the report said Tresidder is operating at
a loss because of "colossal blunders" in
financial decisions.
The report states that the February
layoffs, called an economy measure,
backfired and led to increased losses.
After the layoffs, monthly sales volume
was 20 percent lower in March than

one year before and 37 percent lower
in April, according to the committee.
The report claims the Tresidder
management neither understands nor
cares about the financial problems. It
quotes Tregea as saying, "It does not
really matter what the Food Service
makes. We don't need to know how
much an operation is making or
losing."
The committee recommended that
the University first fire Tregea and
Duffy and disband the Committee on
Tresidder Union. Then, the report said,

while a University office takes interim
responsibility for the Union, a student
worker-expert commission should de
sign a new organization for Tresidder.
Finally, the commission said final
approval for the reorganization of the
Union should come in a community
wide referendum.
The report was presented yesterday
morning to President Lyman with a
letter from Senate Chairman Mike
Dawson, who emphasized the "urgent
necessity for immediate action."
Tresidder Union's director and busi
ness manager should be fired because of
"their record of ineptitude in every
field of management," states an ASSU
committee report issued yesterday.
The ASSU Senate Investigations
Committee's report, commissioned by
the Senate and Council of Presidents,
blasts the current directors of the
student union for their personnel
practices and financial management.
It charges that Director Forrest
Tregea and Business Manager Phillip
Duffy are responsible for "services that
are few, poor in quality, expensive in
price, and unpleasant to experience."
The ASSU started the inquiry in the

spring, after 12 Tresidder workers were
laid off in February. Activists challeng
ed the Union with a boycott and
"alternative food service" throughout
spring quarter.
Undertaker Mentality
The 18-page report uses strong
language, charging Tresidder's need for
innovation cannot be filled by "men
with the mentality of undertakers."
Tregea said the report "seems to be
a number of distortions of fact;
allegations not supported by any kind
of evidence that's produced."
He charged the report was written
by "young men with conclusions in
search of evidence to prove them."
Scott Burke, a junior in philosophy,
chaired the Tresidder investigation. He
conceded he began with the assumption
"something was wrong at Tresidder."
He said he knew that because of
widespread student dissatisfaction and
because "I've eaten there."
But he denied that the committee
arrived at its verdict of inept manage
ment before its investigation began.
Committee Dispansion
In addition to its demand for a
change of management, the report
called for disbanding the nine member
Committee on Tresidder Union. It said
the committee does not effectively
supervise the Union because of its
"rubber stamp attitude."
Burke, who is also on the Tresidder
Union committee, said the three other
student members agree with the ASSU
report.
Burke also said the four students
will attempt to meet with President
Lyman and to circulate a petition
backing the report's recommendations.
But Tresidder committee chairman
Mason Yearian, a physics professor,
said, "I personally would like to
reiterate my confidence in Mr. Tregea's
direction of Tresidder, and I believe the

majority of the committee feels the
same way.
"Steps are being taken to improve
the Union every day," Yearian added.
Unfriendly Attitudes
The report said students complained
about the unfriendly attitudes of
Tresidder employees. Employees must
have a better attitude, the report said,
and this "cannot occur so long as
Tresidder's present management and its
present system of policy-making con
tinues, for they . . . are the source of
the problem"
The report claims employees' low
morale is caused by administrative
attitudes. It said the hiring of the
coffee house manager's wife as a coffee
house employee violates University
rules and is "the source of extreme
antagonism among coffee house work
ers toward the manager."
The investigators said employees are
often hired in a "completely arbitrary
fashion." They described the manage
ment attitude toward most workers as
"harsh, autocratic, and condescend
ing," but said personal friends of the
bosses receive special favors.

the Senate and Council of Presidents,
blasts the current directors of the
student union for their personnel
practices and financial management.
It charges that Director Forrest
Tregea and Business Manager Phillip
Duffy are responsible for "services that
are few, poor in quality, expensive in
price, and unpleasant to experience."
The ASSU started the inquiry in the

spring, after 12 Tresidder workers were
laid off in February. Activists challeng
ed the Union with a boycott and
"alternative food service" throughout
spring quarter.
Undertaker Mentality
The 18-page report uses strong
language, charging Tresidder's need for
innovation cannot be filled by "men
with the mentality of undertakers."
Tregea said the report "seems to be
a number of distortions of fact;
allegations not supported by any kind
of evidence that's produced."
He charged the report was written
by "young men with conclusions in
search of evidence to prove them."
Scott Burke, a junior in philosophy,
chaired the Tresidder investigation. He
conceded he began with the assumption
"something was wrong at Tresidder."
He said he knew that because of
widespread student dissatisfaction and
because "I've eaten there."
But he denied that the committee
arrived at its verdict of inept manage
ment before its investigation began.
Committee Dispansion
In addition to its demand for a
change of management, the report
called for disbanding the nine member
Committee on Tresidder Union. It said
the committee does not effectively
supervise the Union because of its
"rubber stamp attitude."
Burke, who is also on the Tresidder
Union committee, said the three other
student members agree with the ASSU
report.
Burke also said the four students
will attempt to meet with President
Lyman and to circulate a petition
backing the report's recommendations.
But Tresidder committee chairman
Mason Yearian, a physics professor,
said, "I personally would like to
reiterate my confidence in Mr. Tregea's
direction of Tresidder, and I believe the

majority of the committee feels the
same way.
"Steps are being taken to improve
the Union every day," Yearian added.
Unfriendly Attitudes
The report said students complained
about the unfriendly attitudes of
Tresidder employees. Employees must
have a better attitude, the report said,
and this "cannot occur so long as
Tresidder's present management and its
present system of policy-making con
tinues, for they . . . are the source of
the problem"
The report claims employees' low
morale is caused by administrative
attitudes. It said the hiring of the
coffee house manager's wife as a coffee
house employee violates University
rules and is "the source of extreme
antagonism among coffee house work
ers toward the manager."
The investigators said employees are
often hired in a "completely arbitrary
fashion." They described the manage
ment attitude toward most workers as
"harsh, autocratic, and condescend
ing," but said personal friends of the
bosses receive special favors.
Asked about the report's charge that
one woman was given a Tresidder
owned TV set to use in her home,
Tregea said a woman who had "fallen
ill was provided with a television set for
a few days during her recuperative
period." He denied that favoritism was
involved.
Student Workers
The report said Tregea has failed to
back up his promise to review the
status of student workers, who are not
considered regular employees. The
students currently do not receive some
benefits available to other workers.
Beyond the specific allegations, the
report charges that decisions concern

ing workers are made without any
employee participation, "in the finest
tradition of the divine right kinds of
the 15th and 16th centuries."
Moving from personnel to finance,
the report said Tresidder is operating at
a loss because of "colossal blunders" in
financial decisions.
The report states that the February
layoffs, called an economy measure,
backfired and led to increased losses.
After the layoffs, monthly sales volume
was 20 percent lower in March than

one year before and 37 percent lower
in April, according to the committee.
The report claims the Tresidder
management neither understands nor
cares about the financial problems. It
quotes Tregea as saying, "It does not
really matter what the Food Service
makes. We don't need to know how
much an operation is making or
losing."
The committee recommended that
the University first fire Tregea and
Duffy and disband the Committee on
Tresidder Union. Then, the report said,

while a University office takes interim
responsibility for the Union, a student
worker-expert commission should de
sign a new organization for Tresidder.
Finally, the commission said final
approval for the reorganization of the
Union should come in a community
wide referendum.
The report was presented yesterday
morning to President Lyman with a
letter from Senate Chairman Mike
Dawson, who emphasized the "urgent
necessity for immediate action."
Tresidder Union's director and busi
ness manager should be fired because of
"their record of ineptitude in every
field of management," states an ASSU
committee report issued yesterday.
