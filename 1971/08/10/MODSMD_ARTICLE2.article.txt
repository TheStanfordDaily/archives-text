# Grievance Stalled By Resignations
## 
### 
The grievance hearing for John
Dolly remained stalled this week after
two of the three members of his
grievance committee resigned.
Dolly and four other workers have
asked for grievance hearings after
having been fired for their alleged
participation in the April 9 hospital
sit-in.
At a hearing Friday Dolly asked his
representative, Roland Finston, to
resign when Finston refused to chal
lenge the right of Byron Sher, the
administration appointed member, to
act as chairman for the committee.
Yesterday, Harry Miller, the Medical
School appointee, quit, saying, "It is
my contention that Mr. Dolly has so
undermined and deceived the attempts
of this committee to hear testimony
and collect information, that I person
ally feel compromised in not being able
to offer an unbiased decision."
The hearing Friday was supposed to
have continued the grievance after an
earlier delay was caused by the
resignation of H. Kieth H. Brodie, the
original administration appointee.
Hearings for the four other fired
workers have not yet begun, but
according to Sher, who will serve in all
the committees, "we hope to have one,
and maybe two, of the others started
within the next week."
Three Picked
Grievance committees have been
picked in three of the four remaining
cases. Serving on all the committees
along with Sher will be Elwood Pierce,
an assistant controller in the dean's
office of the medical school who will
act as the departmental representative.
The employee representative in each
case will be as follows; for Anthony
Chatmon, John T. Wilson, an assistant
professor at the Medical Center; for
John Kielch, Roy E. Boggs, a library
service assistant; and for Devera Satis
key, James Breedlove, a curator of
Latin American materials at the library.
Dolly's hearing Friday never even
reached as far as his first hearing, the
stage of taking testimony. Instead it got

bogged down in procedural questions
for over an hour, and finally collapsed
when Finston resigned at Dolly's
request.
Finston's resignation came after
Dolly challenged Sher's right to act as
chairman at the hearings. Sher assumed
that his authority was specified in the
grievance procedure guidelines, but
upon reading it aloud realized that
there were no provisions for a chairman.
He then said he would assume the
role if there were no objections from
the other members of the committee.
At this point Dolly asked Finston to
register an objection, which he refused
to do.
Dolly then said he wanted a new
representative, and after consulting
with Finston they both agreed that
Dolly should pick someone else.
Dolly Appointee
Dolly announced he would appoint
fellow Venceremos member John
Flores, assistant professor of German,
as his new representative, but Sher said
that the committee would have to meet
in private before they could continue
the hearing. He and Miller then walked
out.
Throughout the hearing Dolly had
objected to the procedures which Sher
explained had been decided by the
committee. Both Miller and Finston
accepted the rules, which were quite
different from those used under Brodie,
but Dolly argued that he was being
"railroaded" by the new chairman.
The new procedures included ac
ceptance of hearsay evidence, no right
to cross examine witnesses, and the
committee's acceptance of Provost
William Miller's ruling that Bruce
Franklin cannot act as Dolly's counsel.
The committee also tried to clarify
the exact charges against Dolly, and his
specific grievance. Personnel Director
Robert Nelson contends that Dolly was
fired for "unacceptable behaviour" for
his participation in the hospital sit-in.
Dolly, however, says that he was
fired for inadequate cause, in that
Nelson did not have proper evidence of
his guilt, that Nelson did not disclose

the evidence against him before he was
fired, that there was no review of the
dismissal, and that it was improper to
force him to leave on only one days
notice.
Miller Objects
Miller explained after the hearing
that he thought Dolly's objections were
not valid. He said that for the past year
and a half the administration appointee
has always acted as chairman. "Some
one has to act as spokesman," he said,
"and we would have spoken up if there
were things that we disagreed with."
Finston afterward said that Dolly
chose a new representative because he
"could not accept my style of operat
ing on a committee." He would not
comment on Dolly's charge that Sher
was railroading the committ. e, but said
that "he brings a legal mind that none
of us in there had. The hearing has been
tightened up for a more legal like
approach."

Dolly said that he would now
demand that Miller be replaced by
someone in his department. He also
suggested that since the administration
had fired him, the neutral party to the
committee in his case is the department
representative, and thus he should be
the chairman.
Sher, when asked about this, said,
"That's an interesting idea."
Class Action
In a related action yesterday a group
of library employees attempted to get
signatures on a "class action" grievance
on behalf of "all those employed by
Stanford University."
It protests the "unacceptable behav
ior" clause as "vague, and applied in an
arbitrary manner," and charges that
"The Stanford Administration in Dol
ly's August 6th hearing, contrived to
deny him, and thereby all Stanford
employees," of basic rights.

Class Action
In a related action yesterday a group

arbitrary manner," and charges that

HOSPITAL SIT-INâ€”The sixteen persons charged with misdemeanors for their
alleged participation in the 8-9 sit-in, have conditionally plead guilty to a
lesser number of charges.
The grievance hearing for John
Dolly remained stalled this week after
two of the three members of his
grievance committee resigned.
Dolly and four other workers have
asked for grievance hearings after
having been fired for their alleged
participation in the April 9 hospital
sit-in.
At a hearing Friday Dolly asked his
representative, Roland Finston, to
resign when Finston refused to chal
lenge the right of Byron Sher, the
administration appointed member, to
act as chairman for the committee.
Yesterday, Harry Miller, the Medical
School appointee, quit, saying, "It is
my contention that Mr. Dolly has so
undermined and deceived the attempts
of this committee to hear testimony
and collect information, that I person
ally feel compromised in not being able
to offer an unbiased decision."
The hearing Friday was supposed to
have continued the grievance after an
earlier delay was caused by the
resignation of H. Kieth H. Brodie, the
original administration appointee.
Hearings for the four other fired
workers have not yet begun, but
according to Sher, who will serve in all
the committees, "we hope to have one,
and maybe two, of the others started
within the next week."
Three Picked
Grievance committees have been
picked in three of the four remaining
cases. Serving on all the committees
along with Sher will be Elwood Pierce,
an assistant controller in the dean's
office of the medical school who will
act as the departmental representative.
The employee representative in each
case will be as follows; for Anthony
Chatmon, John T. Wilson, an assistant
professor at the Medical Center; for
John Kielch, Roy E. Boggs, a library
service assistant; and for Devera Satis
key, James Breedlove, a curator of
Latin American materials at the library.
Dolly's hearing Friday never even
reached as far as his first hearing, the
stage of taking testimony. Instead it got

bogged down in procedural questions
for over an hour, and finally collapsed
when Finston resigned at Dolly's
request.
Finston's resignation came after
Dolly challenged Sher's right to act as
chairman at the hearings. Sher assumed
that his authority was specified in the
grievance procedure guidelines, but
upon reading it aloud realized that
there were no provisions for a chairman.
He then said he would assume the
role if there were no objections from
the other members of the committee.
At this point Dolly asked Finston to
register an objection, which he refused
to do.
Dolly then said he wanted a new
representative, and after consulting
with Finston they both agreed that
Dolly should pick someone else.
Dolly Appointee
Dolly announced he would appoint
fellow Venceremos member John
Flores, assistant professor of German,
as his new representative, but Sher said
that the committee would have to meet
in private before they could continue
the hearing. He and Miller then walked
out.
Throughout the hearing Dolly had
objected to the procedures which Sher
explained had been decided by the
committee. Both Miller and Finston
accepted the rules, which were quite
different from those used under Brodie,
but Dolly argued that he was being
"railroaded" by the new chairman.
The new procedures included ac
ceptance of hearsay evidence, no right
to cross examine witnesses, and the
committee's acceptance of Provost
William Miller's ruling that Bruce
Franklin cannot act as Dolly's counsel.
The committee also tried to clarify
the exact charges against Dolly, and his
specific grievance. Personnel Director
Robert Nelson contends that Dolly was
fired for "unacceptable behaviour" for
his participation in the hospital sit-in.
Dolly, however, says that he was
fired for inadequate cause, in that
Nelson did not have proper evidence of
his guilt, that Nelson did not disclose

the evidence against him before he was
fired, that there was no review of the
dismissal, and that it was improper to
force him to leave on only one days
notice.
Miller Objects
Miller explained after the hearing
that he thought Dolly's objections were
not valid. He said that for the past year
and a half the administration appointee
has always acted as chairman. "Some
one has to act as spokesman," he said,
"and we would have spoken up if there
were things that we disagreed with."
Finston afterward said that Dolly
chose a new representative because he
"could not accept my style of operat
ing on a committee." He would not

Dolly Appointee
Dolly announced he would appoint
fellow Venceremos member John
Flores, assistant professor of German,
as his new representative, but Sher said
that the committee would have to meet
in private before they could continue
the hearing. He and Miller then walked
out.
Throughout the hearing Dolly had
objected to the procedures which Sher
explained had been decided by the
committee. Both Miller and Finston
accepted the rules, which were quite
different from those used under Brodie,
but Dolly argued that he was being
"railroaded" by the new chairman.
The new procedures included ac
ceptance of hearsay evidence, no right
to cross examine witnesses, and the
committee's acceptance of Provost
William Miller's ruling that Bruce
Franklin cannot act as Dolly's counsel.
The committee also tried to clarify
the exact charges against Dolly, and his
specific grievance. Personnel Director
Robert Nelson contends that Dolly was
fired for "unacceptable behaviour" for
his participation in the hospital sit-in.
Dolly, however, says that he was
fired for inadequate cause, in that
Nelson did not have proper evidence of
his guilt, that Nelson did not disclose

the evidence against him before he was
fired, that there was no review of the
dismissal, and that it was improper to
force him to leave on only one days
notice.
Miller Objects
Miller explained after the hearing
that he thought Dolly's objections were
not valid. He said that for the past year
and a half the administration appointee
has always acted as chairman. "Some
one has to act as spokesman," he said,
"and we would have spoken up if there
were things that we disagreed with."
Finston afterward said that Dolly
chose a new representative because he
"could not accept my style of operat
ing on a committee." He would not
comment on Dolly's charge that Sher
was railroading the committ. e, but said
that "he brings a legal mind that none
of us in there had. The hearing has been
tightened up for a more legal like
approach."

Dolly said that he would now
demand that Miller be replaced by
someone in his department. He also
suggested that since the administration
had fired him, the neutral party to the
committee in his case is the department
representative, and thus he should be
the chairman.
Sher, when asked about this, said,
"That's an interesting idea."
Class Action
In a related action yesterday a group
of library employees attempted to get
signatures on a "class action" grievance
on behalf of "all those employed by
Stanford University."
It protests the "unacceptable behav
ior" clause as "vague, and applied in an
arbitrary manner," and charges that
"The Stanford Administration in Dol
ly's August 6th hearing, contrived to
deny him, and thereby all Stanford
employees," of basic rights.

HOSPITAL SIT-INâ€”The sixteen persons charged with misdemeanors for their
alleged participation in the 8-9 sit-in, have conditionally plead guilty to a
lesser number of charges.
The grievance hearing for John
Dolly remained stalled this week after
two of the three members of his
grievance committee resigned.
Dolly and four other workers have
asked for grievance hearings after
having been fired for their alleged
participation in the April 9 hospital
sit-in.
At a hearing Friday Dolly asked his
representative, Roland Finston, to
resign when Finston refused to chal
lenge the right of Byron Sher, the
administration appointed member, to
act as chairman for the committee.
Yesterday, Harry Miller, the Medical
School appointee, quit, saying, "It is
my contention that Mr. Dolly has so
undermined and deceived the attempts
of this committee to hear testimony
and collect information, that I person
ally feel compromised in not being able
to offer an unbiased decision."
The hearing Friday was supposed to
have continued the grievance after an
earlier delay was caused by the
resignation of H. Kieth H. Brodie, the
original administration appointee.
Hearings for the four other fired
workers have not yet begun, but
according to Sher, who will serve in all
the committees, "we hope to have one,
and maybe two, of the others started
within the next week."
Three Picked
Grievance committees have been
picked in three of the four remaining
cases. Serving on all the committees
along with Sher will be Elwood Pierce,
an assistant controller in the dean's
office of the medical school who will
act as the departmental representative.
The employee representative in each
case will be as follows; for Anthony
Chatmon, John T. Wilson, an assistant
professor at the Medical Center; for
John Kielch, Roy E. Boggs, a library
service assistant; and for Devera Satis
key, James Breedlove, a curator of
Latin American materials at the library.
Dolly's hearing Friday never even
reached as far as his first hearing, the
stage of taking testimony. Instead it got

bogged down in procedural questions
for over an hour, and finally collapsed
when Finston resigned at Dolly's
request.
Finston's resignation came after
Dolly challenged Sher's right to act as
chairman at the hearings. Sher assumed
that his authority was specified in the
grievance procedure guidelines, but
upon reading it aloud realized that
there were no provisions for a chairman.
He then said he would assume the
role if there were no objections from
the other members of the committee.
At this point Dolly asked Finston to
register an objection, which he refused
to do.
Dolly then said he wanted a new
representative, and after consulting
with Finston they both agreed that
Dolly should pick someone else.
