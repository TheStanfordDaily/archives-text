# Dolly's Follies...
## 
### BOB LITTERMAN Commentary 
It's too bad more people don't go
see it—they really ought to advertise for
it and then charge admission—one of
the funniest shows on campus, it's
Dolly's Follies.
With only two hastily arranged
engagements so far, and no one willing
to guess when the next one will be, it's
going to be hard to find. But if you're
going to be around all summer and like
something different, you certainly
should go see one of John Dolly's
Grievance Hearings.
Although the plot is rather compli
cated [see story above] the acting is
great, and the characters simply unreal.
First, of course, is Dolly himself.
Stereotyped a bit too much as the
typical radical, Dolly stars as the poor
worker, fired without cause, can't find
a job anywhere, wife pregnant, a victim
of The Administration.
Then on the other side is Bob

Nelson. Quiet, nervous on the stand,
the administration representative,
taking every minute of it seriously.
Central figure of the committee is
the chairman. Under Keith Brodie the
play got far enough to hear the
administration case—some really funny
material.
But with Byron Sher it was even
better.
Tension built up throughout Act I as
Sher presented the new rules. Dolly
tried to hold his ground but seemed to
be losing.
Then as the game was set to start
(i.e., have Nelson testify) Dolly chal
lenged Sher's very right to call the
shots.
Unfazed, Sher countered with his
rules again. "It's right here in Guide
Memo 22-10." But when he finished
reading the rules, it wasn't there. The
face—unshakable, but shaken—the ash
en color as his blood drained. But even
without the rule he carried on.
"Hearing no objection from my col
leagues, I'll continue as chairman."
