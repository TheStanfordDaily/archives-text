# Hospital Sit-In
## 16 Enter Conditional Guilty Pleas 
### 
Sixteen persons—each facing nine misdemeanor
charges for his alleged participation in the April 8-9
hospital sit-in, which ended in a near-riot—condition
ally have pleaded guilty to a lesser number of
charges.
The 16, who originally pleaded innocent on all
charges, say their change of pleas is dependent on the
outcome of a hearing scheduled Wednesday at 9 a.m.
in San Jose Superior Court for six other defendants
facing both felony and misdemeanor charges
stemming from the sit-in.
Most of the 16 have pleaded guilty on various
charges of trespass, unlawful assembly or refusal to
disperse.
If the six defendants charged with felonies are
unable to plead to reduced charges, sources close to
the defense indicated, the 16 persons charged only
with misdemeanors will withdraw their guilty pleas
and will ask for jury trials on the original nine
charges, which include several trespass charges,
participating in a riot, remaining at the scene of a
riot, refusal to disperse, unlawful assembly, and
others.
Each trial would take between one and two weeks.
Some May Choose Jail
One misdemeanor trial, involving six defendants,
originally was scheduled to begin yesterday, but was
postponed pending the outcome of the San Jose
hearing.

If the guilty pleas to the lesser number of charges
stand, the 16 will receive fines ranging between $100
and $200 and one to two years probation. Probation
violations could result in two to four month jail
sentences, according to James Wolpman, one of the
defendants' attorneys.
Wolpman also said that some members of the
group may choose to go to jail for 30 to 60 days
rather than accept probation. The group will be
sentenced Sept. 21 in Palo Alto.
Group Includes Fired Workers
Among the 16 are the five University workers fired
June 21 on the grounds of "unacceptable behavior"
for their alleged participation in the sit-in. [See
related story, this page.] Three students—Molly
Dougherty, Phil Lind and Katherine Kurtz—and Asst.
Prof, of German John Flores are also in the group.
A total of 31 persons have been arrested in
connection with the sit-in; they face a total of more
than 240 charges. About 50 persons, including 13 of
the 170 policemen and sheriff's deputies called to the
scene, were injured, and damage to the hospital
corridor where the melee broke out was estimated at
$100,000.
In another case stemming from the sit-in, former
BSU Chairman Leo Bazile has pleaded innocent to
charges of failure to disperse, resisting a peace officer.

unlawful assembly and participation in an unlawful
assembly.
Bazile Appearance Set
Bazile is scheduled to appear Thursday in Palo
Alto Municipal Court either to settle his case or to set
a trial date. Asst. Law School Dean Thelton E.
Henderson, his attorney, is negotiating with the
district attorney's office to have all of the charges
against Bazile dropped. The case has already been
continued several times.
Bazile and Black Liberation Front member
Christopher Laury are scheduled to stand trial Sept.
20 in San Mateo Superior Court on charges of beating
Mary Jane Schmidt, a Medical Center records
supervisor, on May 2. Both have pleaded innocent to
these charges.
Janelle James, a member of the Law Commune
and active in Legal Defense, will appear Thursday in
Palo Alto Municipal Court to set a trial date on a
charge of battery at the sit-in. She was arrested
outside the hospital; nine other charges against her
have been dropped for lack of evidence.
