# Tolly's Follies
## If You're Going To Be Around 
### Don Tollefson 
The month and a half between
now and the next Daily will
naturally be filled with an incred
ible number of entertainment
events. Obviously space limita
tions prevent a complete listing,
but I can at least mention some of
the particularly notable things
which will be going on in the Bay
Area between now and the begin
ning of Fall Quarter.

I preface this article with a
warning that this column will have
to omit many worthwile events
which I either do not yet know
about or do not have room to
mention. There are sure to be an
incredible amount of other things
popping up in the next few weeks,
so again it should be pointed out
that this is a very, very incomplete
article.
To wrapup the summer quarter
on-campus schedule, we have a
couple of more performances of
Robin, a concert featuring Arthur
Fiedler and a couple of movies.
Robin will close out its run in
the Branner Dining Room this
week with 8:30 p.m. performance
on Thursday through Sunday
nights. Tickets for the multi
media production are $2.
This Sunday at 5 p.m. in Frost
Ampitheater the San Francisco
Symphony under the direction of
Arthur Fiedler will present a

Health Council. Jazz pianist
George Shearing and his quartet

going for $3 on the lawn and $5
in chairs.

The Anderson Exhibit current
ly being shown at the Stanford
Museum will continue through

Moving off campus one is
predictably confronted with a
mountain of entertainment. For
what it's worth, here are some of
the highlights presently being or
about to be presented.

Strong Production
This festival may not be as
large and well-known as the

by their production of Much
Ado.. . this is a high-quality festi

to go to Oregon, you ought to at
least venture as far as San Rafael.

tion which deserves mention is

September 28th, goodbye.
