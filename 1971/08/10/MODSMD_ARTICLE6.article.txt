Editor, The Daily:
It's strange that nobody men
tioned political and economic
systems in the Daily's forum on
Women's Liberation. Women in
socialistic countries have a status
unequaled in capitalistic societies.
Compared to the U.S. You find
large percentages in law and
medical schools, in professions
and as heads of enterprises. They
have child-care centers, more
equal pay and access to almost all
levels of political decision making.
Compare the Life articles
about China, where women are
paid the same as men and where
there is no prostitution, with the
Chronicle's headlines of the pro
posed "pleasure" tax on using a
prostitute.
In our society, contrary to
popular myth, capital controls the
political economic and social
system, and white men control
the capital. Where they will pay
the 6,000,000+ women heads of
families no more than an average
wage of $400/ mo, they will pay
these women much, much more
to be commercial sexual objects
for their gratification.
Many women, Third World
women especially, have the choice
here of poverty level wages, or
prostitution of one form or
another. In China they have the
choice of equal wages.
As long as the white power
structure can profit from the
exploitation of cheap woman and
third world labor, here and
throughout the U.S. Empire, ex
ploitation will continue.
From the large number of
women in revolutionary leader

ship (and where else will you find
women's leadership?) it is clear
that women don't want to share
equally in this exploitation, but to
end it.
Their liberation, which is the
monumental liberation of half the
people in the world, is going hand
in hand with the liberation of all
exploited people's and nations.

Editor, The Daily:
I find the letter from the ASSU
Council of Presidents in the
August 3, 1971 Daily, praising
Assemblyman Brown for his stand
on the private college and univer
sity peace officer bill, troubling to
say the least.
There is a strong suggestion of
bad faith on the part of the
administration and an emotional
broadside at the bill itself. Neither
of these is in my view warranted.
Last spring, at the suggestion
of the ASSU Council of President,
President Lyman established a
Commission on the Status of the
Stanford Police. That Commis
sion, upon which one of the
ASSU Presidents serves, has been
hard at work considering the
question of whether or not our
police should have peace officer
status and, if so, how to get from
here to there.
The President, in his letter of
May 28, 1971, establishing the
Commission, stated that "I need
advice from the University com
munity before reaching any firm
conclusions on these questions."
It awaits that advice from the

Commission.
If it were so clear that "the
maintenance of a free society"
requires "control of the campus
police force by an elected local
official or body" the matter
would be much simpler than the
Commission apparently finds it.
Rather, it has been thought,
and nothing in the ASSU Presi
dents' rhetoric affects the
thought, that there are a number
of ways to structure the police
services at Stanford so as to make
them responsive to community
needs, and that such responsive
ness need not necessarily come
through control by elected offi
cials.
The bill, which contrary to
reports is not dead, is not in any
way inconsistent with creation of
a police force responsive to and
responsible to the University com
munity. I am confident that the
Commission will illuminate the
whole matter more than the
ASSU Presidents' letter.
At the same meeting with the
ASSU Presidents at which Presi
dent Lyman received the request
to establish the Commission, he
described the proposed legislation,
and it was made known that the
administration intended to sup

port the legislation in Sacramento.
The Commission has been kept
apprised of the status of the bill.
It has also been made quite
clear that the legislation merely
creates an option and that the
administration has not decided, as
it will not decide until the
Commission has an opportunity
to be heard, whether or not that
option is preferable to others
which are under continuing exam
ination and exploration.

the President
(Editor's Note: Mr. Siena is
correct to point out that the
police bill is not technically
"dead." But virtually all informed
observers believe it starts no
practical chance of passage in this
session of the legislature.)
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to correct an error
in your August 6 article, "Report
Documents DOD Research." I did
not say "Over 20 percent of the
Department of Defense sponsored
research activity at this university
is directed toward solving phe

nemona that do have direct
military importance."
I said that virtually all the
DOD supported research here is
directed toward solving problems
that have direct military impor
tance.

Editor, The Daily:
On September 15, 1970 the
University Administration pro
mulgated, without consultation of
those affected, a grievance proce
dure for non-academic employees.
' This procedure, outlined in
University Guide Memo 22.10, is
the one which John Keilch had to
use after his suspension last
January and has been used more
recently by John Dolly. Many
members of the library staff
became aware of several impor
tant objections to the present
procedure during the Keilch hear
ings.
A joint committee was formed
by the Stanford University Librar
ian's Association and the Stanford
University Libraries Staff Associa

tion to wite a new, more
equitable grievance procedure.
The necssity for a new proce
dure has become even more
obvious in light of the arbitrary
manner in which the University
Administration has handled John
Dolly's grievance.
What are the objectionable
features of the present procedure?
Under Guide Memo 22.10 an
employee may be fired or sus
pended without pay before he has
an opportunity to have a hearing
on the charges brought against
him; in other words an employee
can be penalized without proof
that he is guilty of any transgres
sion. Under the present procedure
the manner of selecting a griev
ance committee opens the possi
bility of stacking the committee
two to one in favor of the
Administration.
The SULA/SULSA committee
felt it necessary to write a new
grievance procedure which would
provide for democratic proceed
ings giving both parties equal
rights and requiring equal respon
sibility on both sides.
Under the proposed procedure
an employee could not be fired or

suspended before he has been
found guilty. In those rare cases
where immediate suspension is
necessary it would have to be
suspension with pay. The new
procedure prevents the Adminis
tration from acting as both
prosecutor and judge in those
cases where it is an interested
party.
Also, the findings and recom
mendations of the grievance com
mittee would be binding upon
both parties.
In June, 1971 a secret mail
ballot was sent to the employees
of the University libraries asking
them to approve or disapprove the
new grievance procedure. An
overwhelming majority of the
library staff, 90 percent of those
voting, approved the new proce
dure and has recommended it for
adoption to the Director of
Personnel and University Rela
tions, Robert Nelson.
The proposal is now on Mr.
Nelson's desk. Hopefully, the new
grievance procedure can be adopt
ed, with the approval of the
employees of the University, for
the entire University staff.
(This letter was signed by 19
library employees.)
