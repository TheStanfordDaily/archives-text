# Hearings Scheduled For Fall
## Moratorium Set On Frost Rock Concerts 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Violence and other trouble at a July
18th rock concert in Frost Ampitheater
has apparently expedited a moratorium
on rock concerts in the ampitheater.
The moratorium has evidently been
contemplated for quite awhile, but the
final decision by Director of Public
Events Tom Bacchetti to impose it was
speeded by problems at last month's
Cold Blood—Elvin Bishop concert.
Non-rock events such as the Joan
Baez and Arthur Fiedler concerts will
not be affected, nor will rock concerts
in other locations, such as Maples
Pavilion. But no rock events will be
staged in Frost until after an investiga
tion is made by the Committee of
Public Events this fall.
The Committee, which includes 4
students, 4 faculty members and 3 staff
members, will not be able to meet until
after school begins in late September.
Bacchetti said that he would like to
have open meetings which would allow
"strong input" into the study.

At the Cold Blood show, a number
of problems arose including the bur
glary of a concession truck, the collapse
of a tree limb filled with people and
fighting, which flared up throughout
the later stages of the afternoon.
The fighting involves only a few of
the greater than 12,000 people in
attendance, but what did occur was
bloody and violent. No one was
seriously injured, but a few people had
to be treated at Stanford Hospital.
Bacchetti says that he has been
surprised that his decision has not
stirred up that much negative reaction.
"Most people have told me that they
thought it was a good idea." Bacchetti
said that although he had not been

pressured by the administration, "they
also thought it [the July 18th concert]
was a bad scene."
Diane Fields, member of the ASSU
Council of Presidents said that the
Council "basically supports the deci
sion." She said, "It's unfortunate, but
the way that Frost is built there have to
be ground rules for concerts."
Fields said that the council was
naturally upset by the idea of drug
overdose problems, knifings and people
falling out of trees . . ."We just hope
that there will be enough student input
into the hearings so that the students
won't feel that the administration is
putting on the shows."
No concerts had been scheduled for

the rest of the summer but a rumored
Stanford Legal Defense concert featur
ing the Grateful Dead, which was being
considered for September 26th, will
apprently have to be postponed or
cancelled since Bacchetti says that no
rock shows will be presented until the
committee has studied the situation
this fall.
Bacchetti said that he had been
approached by a potential promoter of
the Dead show who had wanted to
know if the show could be presented if
the Dead performed "folk" music.
Bacchetti said that he considered the
chances "very slim" and added that the
promoters would "have to do a lot of
convincing."
