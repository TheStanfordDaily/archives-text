# Lyman Back From Europe, Japan
## 
### 
President Richard Lyman returned
to his office in Building 10 yesterday
after a six-week trip to Europe and
Japan. Lyman and his wife visited all
five overseas campuses and spent a
week at an Institute for International
Education conference in Nara, Japan.
Lyman said leaders of several major
American universities talked informally
with educators from Asian nations,
including Japan, South Korea, and
South Vietnam He said Asian educa
tors asked for advice on problems
ranging from English language instruc
tion to university finances.
He said the prominent Asian educa
tors are less afraid of American
interference than of neo-isolationism
and "that America might be pulling out
of any significant efforts abroad."
In addition to his own contribution
and University funds to pay for the

official campus visits, Lyman said he
saved money on his trip by cutting
corners. The President said the confer
ence group offered him a first-class
ticket to Japan. When he flew tourist
class instead, they gave him the
difference to use on his European
travels.
Lyman said his visits to the five
overseas campuses will help him in the
tuture "if decisions have to be made
about the campuses."
"It's no secret that there is an
enrollment problem at most of the
campuses," he added.
Lyman remarked, however, that the
students he met at the overseas
campuses showed "a very considerable
amount of enthusiasm" for the Stan
ford program.
Now that he has returned, Lyman
said he must catch up on campus events

which occurred during his absence.
Commenting on the controversy over
efforts to boost the power of campus
police, Lyman said the discussion has
been "not enough in terms of crimes
committed on campus," such as robber
ies.
He said outside police will always
handle "major disorders" because Uni
versity resources could never support a
campus force "adequate to all occa
sions."
