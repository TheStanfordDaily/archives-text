# Napier To Leave In '72; Will Head Seminary
## 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
Dean of the Chapel B. Davie Napier
will leave Stanford in December and
assume his new post as President of the
Pacific School of Religion in March.
Napier, 56, was named head of the
Berkeley seminary in mid-August. He
succeeds Dr. Stuart Leßoy Anderson
who is retiring after 21 years.
Pacific is the oldest theological
seminary west of the Mississippi and is
one of ten seminaries located in
Berkeley.
New Challenges
In leaving Stanford, Napier said he
made his decision "primarily because of
the challenges the new job offered."
His last official function here will
be the Christmas Eve service, and he
then plans to spend two months
raveling to major theological centers of
he country to "look at some of the
experimental things going on in
theological education" before assuming
'lis new duties.
During his five years as dean of the
hapel and professor of religion at
Stanford, Napier has been one of the
more popular and controversial men on
campus. Coming from Yale in the
summer of 1966, he was the first dean
of the chapel in Stanford's history. His
appointment had been the result of a
$1.2 million gift to the university to be
used for the church. At the same time,
a committee headed by then Associate
dean of Humanities and Sciences
Richard Lyman had recommended
broadening the chapel program.
Napier's arrival quickly made the
church a focal point on campus and
both himself and the church a center of
controversy.
Anti-War Views Unpopular
Although a man who speaks quietly,
Napier came to Stanford a strong
anti-war critic. At a time when such
views were not yet widely popular, he
quickly irritated many with his strong
peace stance.
Not only did he himself express
strong opposition to the war, but he
soon helped make Memorial Church a
center for the peace movement. Often
letting left-of-center groups use the
church for meetings, he also sponsored
speakers such as draft resister and
former ASSU president David Harris
and his wife, folksinger Joan Baez.
Also, in trying to "make the church
speak to the university community" he
allowed the church to be used for the
play "Marat Sade," talked about the

Beatles and played Simon and
Garfunkle albums in his sermons, which
'irritated many who conceived of
religion as the nurture of the pious."
Quickly becoming a very popular
campus figure, Napier admits that he
also stepped on a lot of toes—among
them those of the three presidents he
served under.
But Napier adds "that despite the
fact that I stepped on the toes of all
three presidents in the end all three
have given me their support and have
recognized that to have a chapel
program it has to be open and
controversial."
Control of Activities
There were two serious attempts
made to control Napier's activities as
dean.

The first was when Lowell Berry,
the man whose $1.2 million gift had
enabled Napier to come to Stanford,
attempted to transfer his gift from the
church to other uses in January of
1969. However, President Kenneth
Pitzer backed Napier.
The second attempt was last spring
when the Committee on Public Events
(COPE) attempted to distinguish
between secular and religious uses of
the chapel and tried to take control of
the secular. President Lyman appointed
an arbiter who decided largely in
Napier's favor.
Some friends say Napier had been
somewhat unhappy with the Public
Events controversy last spring and also
with the increasing militancy on campus

and what he felt was increasing
resistance on the part of the university
toward change. But, Napier says he's
going to his new job for
"overwhelmingly positive reasons."
"Stanford has been awfuliy good to
me," he says.
Search For Values
Commenting on Napier's decision to
leave, President Lyman said, "Regret is
hardly an adequate word to express my
feeling about Dean Napier's decision to
leave Stanford. In his five years here he
has responded eloquently to the
growing student search for religious
meaning and values.
"I can certainly understand why the
challenge represented by the Pacific
School of Religion would appeal to a
man of his abilities, but he will be
greatly missed at Stanford." Lyman
added that a search committee of
faculty and students will be formed
shortly to find a replacement for
Napier.
Concerning his new duties, Napier is
slightly apprehensive. "It's one thing to
be a critic and troubler and play the
prophetic role but now I've got to keep
the thing afloat," he laughs.

Napier's religion seems a
combination of a strong sense of self
criticism from the Old Testament
prophets along with an equally intense
New Testament humanism.
"I am more largely influenced by
the Old Testament than any other
single entity,"he says. To stand in the
prophetic tradition is to unconsciously
if not consciously construct a total
program which is prophetic in the sense
that it looks at the community of
which it is a part and makes it realize
its greatest potential."
Loss of Humanity
Napier also says he strongly believes
in the second commandment of the
New Testament, to "love thy neighbor
as thyself" which means "that any
compassion and concern for the human
family is a legitimate part of religion."
It is his concern with the
"dehumanization going on today"
which perhaps more than anything else
explains his total involvement in the
peace movement, including blocking a
San Mateo draft board last spring.
Napier was born in China in 1915,
the son of missionaries. He received his
Ph.D. in divinity from Yale in 1944.
Appointed assistant professor at Yale in
1949, he was a professor of Old
Testament criticism and interpretation

former ASSU president David Harris
and his wife, folksinger Joan Baez.
Also, in trying to "make the church
speak to the university community" he
allowed the church to be used for the
play "Marat Sade," talked about the

Beatles and played Simon and
Garfunkle albums in his sermons, which
'irritated many who conceived of
religion as the nurture of the pious."
Quickly becoming a very popular
campus figure, Napier admits that he
also stepped on a lot of toes—among

served under.
But Napier adds "that despite the
fact that I stepped on the toes of all
three presidents in the end all three
have given me their support and have
recognized that to have a chapel
program it has to be open and
controversial."
Control of Activities
There were two serious attempts
made to control Napier's activities as
dean.

The first was when Lowell Berry,
the man whose $1.2 million gift had
enabled Napier to come to Stanford,
attempted to transfer his gift from the
church to other uses in January of
1969. However, President Kenneth
Pitzer backed Napier.
The second attempt was last spring
when the Committee on Public Events
(COPE) attempted to distinguish
between secular and religious uses of
the chapel and tried to take control of
the secular. President Lyman appointed
an arbiter who decided largely in
Napier's favor.
Some friends say Napier had been
somewhat unhappy with the Public
Events controversy last spring and also
with the increasing militancy on campus

and what he felt was increasing
resistance on the part of the university
toward change. But, Napier says he's
going to his new job for
"overwhelmingly positive reasons."
"Stanford has been awfuliy good to
me," he says.
Search For Values
Commenting on Napier's decision to
leave, President Lyman said, "Regret is
hardly an adequate word to express my
feeling about Dean Napier's decision to
leave Stanford. In his five years here he
has responded eloquently to the
growing student search for religious
meaning and values.
"I can certainly understand why the
challenge represented by the Pacific
School of Religion would appeal to a
man of his abilities, but he will be
greatly missed at Stanford." Lyman
added that a search committee of
faculty and students will be formed
shortly to find a replacement for
Napier.
Concerning his new duties, Napier is
slightly apprehensive. "It's one thing to
be a critic and troubler and play the
prophetic role but now I've got to keep
the thing afloat," he laughs.

Napier's religion seems a
combination of a strong sense of self
criticism from the Old Testament
prophets along with an equally intense
New Testament humanism.
"I am more largely influenced by
the Old Testament than any other
single entity,"he says. To stand in the
prophetic tradition is to unconsciously
if not consciously construct a total
program which is prophetic in the sense
that it looks at the community of
which it is a part and makes it realize
its greatest potential."
Loss of Humanity
Napier also says he strongly believes
in the second commandment of the
New Testament, to "love thy neighbor
as thyself" which means "that any
compassion and concern for the human
family is a legitimate part of religion."
It is his concern with the
"dehumanization going on today"
which perhaps more than anything else
explains his total involvement in the
peace movement, including blocking a
San Mateo draft board last spring.
Napier was born in China in 1915,
the son of missionaries. He received his
Ph.D. in divinity from Yale in 1944.
Appointed assistant professor at Yale in
1949, he was a professor of Old
Testament criticism and interpretation
and master of one of Yale's 12 colleges
when he came to Stanford in 1966.
Dean of the Chapel B. Davie Napier
will leave Stanford in December and
assume his new post as President of the
Pacific School of Religion in March.
Napier, 56, was named head of the
Berkeley seminary in mid-August. He
succeeds Dr. Stuart Leßoy Anderson
who is retiring after 21 years.
Pacific is the oldest theological
seminary west of the Mississippi and is
one of ten seminaries located in
Berkeley.
New Challenges
In leaving Stanford, Napier said he
made his decision "primarily because of
the challenges the new job offered."
His last official function here will
be the Christmas Eve service, and he
then plans to spend two months
raveling to major theological centers of
he country to "look at some of the
experimental things going on in
theological education" before assuming
'lis new duties.
During his five years as dean of the
hapel and professor of religion at
Stanford, Napier has been one of the
more popular and controversial men on
campus. Coming from Yale in the
summer of 1966, he was the first dean
of the chapel in Stanford's history. His
appointment had been the result of a
$1.2 million gift to the university to be
used for the church. At the same time,
a committee headed by then Associate
dean of Humanities and Sciences
Richard Lyman had recommended
broadening the chapel program.
Napier's arrival quickly made the
church a focal point on campus and
both himself and the church a center of
controversy.
Anti-War Views Unpopular
Although a man who speaks quietly,
Napier came to Stanford a strong
anti-war critic. At a time when such
views were not yet widely popular, he
quickly irritated many with his strong
peace stance.
Not only did he himself express
strong opposition to the war, but he
soon helped make Memorial Church a
center for the peace movement. Often
letting left-of-center groups use the
church for meetings, he also sponsored
speakers such as draft resister and
former ASSU president David Harris
and his wife, folksinger Joan Baez.
Also, in trying to "make the church
speak to the university community" he

me," he says.
Search For Values
Commenting on Napier's decision to
leave, President Lyman said, "Regret is
hardly an adequate word to express my
feeling about Dean Napier's decision to
leave Stanford. In his five years here he
has responded eloquently to the
growing student search for religious
meaning and values.
"I can certainly understand why the
challenge represented by the Pacific
School of Religion would appeal to a
man of his abilities, but he will be
greatly missed at Stanford." Lyman
added that a search committee of
faculty and students will be formed
shortly to find a replacement for
Napier.
Concerning his new duties, Napier is
slightly apprehensive. "It's one thing to
be a critic and troubler and play the
prophetic role but now I've got to keep
the thing afloat," he laughs.

Napier's religion seems a
combination of a strong sense of self
criticism from the Old Testament
prophets along with an equally intense
New Testament humanism.
"I am more largely influenced by
the Old Testament than any other
single entity,"he says. To stand in the
prophetic tradition is to unconsciously
if not consciously construct a total
program which is prophetic in the sense
that it looks at the community of
which it is a part and makes it realize
its greatest potential."
Loss of Humanity
Napier also says he strongly believes
in the second commandment of the
New Testament, to "love thy neighbor
as thyself" which means "that any
compassion and concern for the human
family is a legitimate part of religion."
It is his concern with the
"dehumanization going on today"
which perhaps more than anything else
explains his total involvement in the
peace movement, including blocking a
San Mateo draft board last spring.
Napier was born in China in 1915,
the son of missionaries. He received his
Ph.D. in divinity from Yale in 1944.
Appointed assistant professor at Yale in
1949, he was a professor of Old
Testament criticism and interpretation
and master of one of Yale's 12 colleges
when he came to Stanford in 1966.
Dean of the Chapel B. Davie Napier
will leave Stanford in December and
assume his new post as President of the
Pacific School of Religion in March.
Napier, 56, was named head of the
Berkeley seminary in mid-August. He
succeeds Dr. Stuart Leßoy Anderson
who is retiring after 21 years.
Pacific is the oldest theological
seminary west of the Mississippi and is
one of ten seminaries located in
Berkeley.
New Challenges
In leaving Stanford, Napier said he
made his decision "primarily because of
the challenges the new job offered."
His last official function here will
be the Christmas Eve service, and he
then plans to spend two months
raveling to major theological centers of
he country to "look at some of the
experimental things going on in
theological education" before assuming
'lis new duties.
During his five years as dean of the
hapel and professor of religion at
Stanford, Napier has been one of the
more popular and controversial men on
campus. Coming from Yale in the
summer of 1966, he was the first dean
of the chapel in Stanford's history. His
appointment had been the result of a
$1.2 million gift to the university to be
used for the church. At the same time,
a committee headed by then Associate
dean of Humanities and Sciences
Richard Lyman had recommended
broadening the chapel program.
Napier's arrival quickly made the
church a focal point on campus and
both himself and the church a center of
controversy.
Anti-War Views Unpopular
Although a man who speaks quietly,
Napier came to Stanford a strong
anti-war critic. At a time when such
views were not yet widely popular, he
quickly irritated many with his strong
peace stance.
Not only did he himself express
strong opposition to the war, but he
soon helped make Memorial Church a
center for the peace movement. Often
letting left-of-center groups use the
church for meetings, he also sponsored
speakers such as draft resister and
former ASSU president David Harris
and his wife, folksinger Joan Baez.
Also, in trying to "make the church
speak to the university community" he
allowed the church to be used for the
play "Marat Sade," talked about the

Beatles and played Simon and
Garfunkle albums in his sermons, which
'irritated many who conceived of
religion as the nurture of the pious."
Quickly becoming a very popular
campus figure, Napier admits that he
also stepped on a lot of toes—among
them those of the three presidents he
served under.
But Napier adds "that despite the
fact that I stepped on the toes of all
three presidents in the end all three
have given me their support and have
recognized that to have a chapel
program it has to be open and
controversial."
Control of Activities
There were two serious attempts
made to control Napier's activities as
dean.

The first was when Lowell Berry,
the man whose $1.2 million gift had
enabled Napier to come to Stanford,
attempted to transfer his gift from the
church to other uses in January of
1969. However, President Kenneth
Pitzer backed Napier.
The second attempt was last spring
when the Committee on Public Events
(COPE) attempted to distinguish
between secular and religious uses of
the chapel and tried to take control of
the secular. President Lyman appointed
an arbiter who decided largely in
Napier's favor.
Some friends say Napier had been
somewhat unhappy with the Public
Events controversy last spring and also
with the increasing militancy on campus

and what he felt was increasing
resistance on the part of the university
toward change. But, Napier says he's
going to his new job for
"overwhelmingly positive reasons."
"Stanford has been awfuliy good to
me," he says.
