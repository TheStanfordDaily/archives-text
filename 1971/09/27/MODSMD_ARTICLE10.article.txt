# 'Our Customers Come First'

I'h.D. momentarily, but advises

One of the ancillary benefits
of being a Daily staffer is the
opportunity to see sneak previews
of dirty movies.
Last week, when Stanford was
still under sedation after a
summer of tranquil tedium, our
regular Pornography Editor (who,
for legal purposes, shall remain
nameless) received a call from the
Manager of the Sutter Cinema,
one of San Francisco's plusher
dens of licentiousness.
"We're having a party at 11:15
Wednesday," she said, "and at
12:15 we'll lock the doors and
show our new movie. Bring your
friends." Snicker.
So, having stuffed ourselves
with homemade ice cream (to
maintain our purity), and armed
with the phone number of the
Daily's high-powered attorney, 14
of us piled into cars and slithered
up the Bayshore to San Francisco.
No one knew why we had been
invited.
Customers First
"Our Customers Come First!"
reads the legend outside the
Sutter Cinema's door. We
marched in and walked bravely up
to the cashier. "We're from the
Stanford Daily," 1 said, quietly.
"Steve!," cried the cashier. "What
are you doing here?"
I thought about it for a few
seconds, and decided to take the
question under submission.
The cashier was Judy, whom I

had met three years ago at the
home of the daughter of a famous
Stanford Administrator. Judy's
sister is Assistant Manager of the
theater, so she fills in when Sis
can't make it.
Honored Guests
We had thus acquired the
status of Honored Guests, and
were ushered into a large room
full of freaky people, large jugs of
cheap wine (red or white, you get
your choice), cheap cheese, a few

dying grapes, a bowl of wilted
peaches, and an occasional hunk
of sourdough bread. It was
apparent that nobody knew why
they had been invited.
Eventually we drifted into the
theater itself. Here was exhibited,
for a mere $3.50 per head
(couples $6, a bargain) the bane
of J. Edgar Hoover, Billy Graham
and Kate Millet: Hard Core. The
Real Stuff.
The regular feature was still on.
Or actually it was the second
feature. The first-run flick, called
"Just Plain Bill," was to follow.
This one, which was just ending,
was called "Glory Story." As far
as I could see, "Glory Story" was

about two contortionists
rehearsing for an audition with
the Ringling Brothers Circus. The
girl was lying on her back in a
shower with the water running
full force, while her partner was
doing the best he could to fold
her into a pretzel. All I could
think was "She'll drown."
Which shows where I was at.
Eventually, the man left the
shower, said something nasty to
the girl, and the movie was over.

Just Plain Bill
"Just Plain Bill," isn't bad as
porno flicks go. The photography
is decent, the actors proficient,
relaxed, and obviously happy.
"Just Plain Bill" is a simple story
of seduction. It involves a boy and
a girl meeting in a park, going up
to his apartment, and copulating.
A classic story simply told.
"Just Plain Bill" was a quickie,
as they say in the trade, and soon
the house lights came up and the
rest of the party guests filed into
the theater for the main
attraction, an epic of
cinema-verite called "Room
Service." ("I told the managers
this wasn't the one with the Marx

Brothers," Judy said, "and they
just stared at me. I guess they
never heard of the Marx
Brothers." You're out of your
league, kid.)
"Room Service," in the
interests of Redeeming Social
Value, pretended to be a
documentary. It began with some
clever erotic drawings by Tomi
Ungerer, and some cute
pornographic puppets, while a
narrator read portions of the
President's Report on Obscenity.
Times Square Hustlers
This was followed by a
discussion on "What pornography

means to me," presumably part of
the research that went into the
report. A group of "average
citizens," most of whom looked
like Times Square hustlers, were
assembled in a room to watch
some porno flicks and give their
reactions to them.
The pornos themselves were
rather interesting, spanning the
decades from 1925 to the
mid-6 O's. If nothing else, they
demonstrated how little biology
has changed in 40 years.
One cute little number was
called "Double Dildo," and
managed to combine Lesbianism,
auto-eroticism, and the
machine-age in an all-too-brief
two minutes. But the climax, as it
were, came with a short film
involving a languid brunette and a
rather large boxer dog who was
doing something very sloppy to
her genitals. At this point a very
fat bearded man sitting behind me
began to laugh hysterically,
screaming "The tongue, the
tongue, look at the tongue!"
Obedience School?
To top it off, the girl managed
to seduce the dog. "That dog
must have gone to a damned good
obedience school," said the Daily
Pornography Editor.
"Room Service" ended with
the members of the discussion
group getting so excited
commenting on the movies that
they have an orgy. It is
well-filmed, as orgies go, but after
two hours of this silliness,
somnolence sets in.
The most penetrating aspect of
sitting through a couple of hours
of dirt, is how dull, and how
much fun, pornography can be.
What a glorious waste of time and
energy we spend in trying to
suppress this harmless nonsense.
How foolish it all is!
This was clearest as we
emerged into the cool night air of
San Francisco, tired but strangely
content, as we quietly tackled our
Pornography Editor, who was
chasing a female boxer dog and
whispering "rape, rape." And as
we stuffed him into the trunk of
the car, glassy-eyed and
slobbering, we thought of how
sweet it could be.

somnolence sets in.

How foolish it all is!
This was clearest as we
emerged into the cool night air of
San Francisco, tired but strangely
content, as we quietly tackled our
Pornography Editor, who was
chasing a female boxer dog and
whispering "rape, rape." And as
we stuffed him into the trunk of
the car, glassy-eyed and
slobbering, we thought of how
sweet it could be.

Last week, when Stanford was
still under sedation after a
summer of tranquil tedium, our
regular Pornography Editor (who,
for legal purposes, shall remain
nameless) received a call from the
Manager of the Sutter Cinema,
one of San Francisco's plusher
dens of licentiousness.
"We're having a party at 11:15
Wednesday," she said, "and at
12:15 we'll lock the doors and
show our new movie. Bring your
friends." Snicker.
So, having stuffed ourselves
with homemade ice cream (to
maintain our purity), and armed
with the phone number of the
Daily's high-powered attorney, 14
of us piled into cars and slithered
up the Bayshore to San Francisco.
No one knew why we had been
invited.
Customers First
"Our Customers Come First!"
reads the legend outside the
Sutter Cinema's door. We
marched in and walked bravely up
to the cashier. "We're from the
Stanford Daily," 1 said, quietly.
"Steve!," cried the cashier. "What
are you doing here?"
I thought about it for a few
seconds, and decided to take the
question under submission.
The cashier was Judy, whom I

had met three years ago at the
home of the daughter of a famous
Stanford Administrator. Judy's
sister is Assistant Manager of the
theater, so she fills in when Sis
can't make it.
Honored Guests
We had thus acquired the
status of Honored Guests, and
were ushered into a large room
full of freaky people, large jugs of
cheap wine (red or white, you get
your choice), cheap cheese, a few

dying grapes, a bowl of wilted
peaches, and an occasional hunk
of sourdough bread. It was
apparent that nobody knew why
they had been invited.
Eventually we drifted into the
theater itself. Here was exhibited,
for a mere $3.50 per head
(couples $6, a bargain) the bane
of J. Edgar Hoover, Billy Graham
and Kate Millet: Hard Core. The
Real Stuff.
The regular feature was still on.
Or actually it was the second
feature. The first-run flick, called
"Just Plain Bill," was to follow.
This one, which was just ending,
was called "Glory Story." As far
as I could see, "Glory Story" was

about two contortionists
rehearsing for an audition with
the Ringling Brothers Circus. The
girl was lying on her back in a
shower with the water running
full force, while her partner was
doing the best he could to fold
her into a pretzel. All I could
think was "She'll drown."
Which shows where I was at.
Eventually, the man left the
shower, said something nasty to
the girl, and the movie was over.

Just Plain Bill
"Just Plain Bill," isn't bad as
porno flicks go. The photography
is decent, the actors proficient,
relaxed, and obviously happy.
"Just Plain Bill" is a simple story
of seduction. It involves a boy and
a girl meeting in a park, going up
to his apartment, and copulating.
A classic story simply told.
"Just Plain Bill" was a quickie,
as they say in the trade, and soon
the house lights came up and the
rest of the party guests filed into
the theater for the main
attraction, an epic of
cinema-verite called "Room
Service." ("I told the managers
this wasn't the one with the Marx

Brothers," Judy said, "and they
just stared at me. I guess they
never heard of the Marx
Brothers." You're out of your
league, kid.)
"Room Service," in the
interests of Redeeming Social
Value, pretended to be a
documentary. It began with some
clever erotic drawings by Tomi
Ungerer, and some cute
pornographic puppets, while a
narrator read portions of the
President's Report on Obscenity.
Times Square Hustlers
This was followed by a
discussion on "What pornography

means to me," presumably part of
the research that went into the
report. A group of "average
citizens," most of whom looked
like Times Square hustlers, were
assembled in a room to watch
some porno flicks and give their
reactions to them.
The pornos themselves were
rather interesting, spanning the
decades from 1925 to the
mid-6 O's. If nothing else, they
demonstrated how little biology
has changed in 40 years.
One cute little number was
called "Double Dildo," and
managed to combine Lesbianism,
auto-eroticism, and the
machine-age in an all-too-brief
two minutes. But the climax, as it
were, came with a short film
involving a languid brunette and a
rather large boxer dog who was
doing something very sloppy to
her genitals. At this point a very
fat bearded man sitting behind me
began to laugh hysterically,
screaming "The tongue, the
tongue, look at the tongue!"
Obedience School?
To top it off, the girl managed
to seduce the dog. "That dog
must have gone to a damned good
obedience school," said the Daily
Pornography Editor.
"Room Service" ended with
the members of the discussion
group getting so excited
commenting on the movies that
they have an orgy. It is
well-filmed, as orgies go, but after
two hours of this silliness,
somnolence sets in.
The most penetrating aspect of

involving a languid brunette and a
rather large boxer dog who was
doing something very sloppy to
her genitals. At this point a very
fat bearded man sitting behind me
began to laugh hysterically,
screaming "The tongue, the
tongue, look at the tongue!"
Obedience School?
To top it off, the girl managed
to seduce the dog. "That dog
must have gone to a damned good
obedience school," said the Daily
Pornography Editor.
"Room Service" ended with
the members of the discussion
group getting so excited
commenting on the movies that
they have an orgy. It is
well-filmed, as orgies go, but after
two hours of this silliness,
somnolence sets in.
The most penetrating aspect of
sitting through a couple of hours
of dirt, is how dull, and how
much fun, pornography can be.
What a glorious waste of time and
energy we spend in trying to
suppress this harmless nonsense.
How foolish it all is!
This was clearest as we
emerged into the cool night air of
San Francisco, tired but strangely
content, as we quietly tackled our
Pornography Editor, who was
chasing a female boxer dog and
whispering "rape, rape." And as
we stuffed him into the trunk of
the car, glassy-eyed and
slobbering, we thought of how
sweet it could be.

Last week, when Stanford was
still under sedation after a
summer of tranquil tedium, our
regular Pornography Editor (who,
for legal purposes, shall remain
nameless) received a call from the
Manager of the Sutter Cinema,
one of San Francisco's plusher
dens of licentiousness.
"We're having a party at 11:15
Wednesday," she said, "and at
12:15 we'll lock the doors and
show our new movie. Bring your
friends." Snicker.
So, having stuffed ourselves
with homemade ice cream (to
maintain our purity), and armed
with the phone number of the
Daily's high-powered attorney, 14
of us piled into cars and slithered
up the Bayshore to San Francisco.
No one knew why we had been
invited.
Customers First
"Our Customers Come First!"
reads the legend outside the
Sutter Cinema's door. We
marched in and walked bravely up
to the cashier. "We're from the
Stanford Daily," 1 said, quietly.
"Steve!," cried the cashier. "What
are you doing here?"
I thought about it for a few
seconds, and decided to take the
question under submission.
The cashier was Judy, whom I

had met three years ago at the
home of the daughter of a famous
Stanford Administrator. Judy's
sister is Assistant Manager of the
theater, so she fills in when Sis
can't make it.
Honored Guests
We had thus acquired the
status of Honored Guests, and
were ushered into a large room
full of freaky people, large jugs of
cheap wine (red or white, you get
your choice), cheap cheese, a few

dying grapes, a bowl of wilted
peaches, and an occasional hunk
of sourdough bread. It was
apparent that nobody knew why
they had been invited.
Eventually we drifted into the
theater itself. Here was exhibited,
for a mere $3.50 per head
(couples $6, a bargain) the bane
of J. Edgar Hoover, Billy Graham
and Kate Millet: Hard Core. The
Real Stuff.
The regular feature was still on.
Or actually it was the second
feature. The first-run flick, called
"Just Plain Bill," was to follow.
This one, which was just ending,
was called "Glory Story." As far
as I could see, "Glory Story" was

about two contortionists
rehearsing for an audition with
the Ringling Brothers Circus. The
girl was lying on her back in a
shower with the water running
full force, while her partner was
doing the best he could to fold
her into a pretzel. All I could
think was "She'll drown."
Which shows where I was at.
Eventually, the man left the
shower, said something nasty to
the girl, and the movie was over.

Just Plain Bill
"Just Plain Bill," isn't bad as
porno flicks go. The photography
is decent, the actors proficient,
relaxed, and obviously happy.
"Just Plain Bill" is a simple story
of seduction. It involves a boy and
a girl meeting in a park, going up
to his apartment, and copulating.
A classic story simply told.
"Just Plain Bill" was a quickie,
as they say in the trade, and soon
the house lights came up and the
rest of the party guests filed into
the theater for the main
attraction, an epic of
cinema-verite called "Room
Service." ("I told the managers
this wasn't the one with the Marx

Brothers," Judy said, "and they
just stared at me. I guess they
never heard of the Marx
Brothers." You're out of your
league, kid.)
"Room Service," in the
interests of Redeeming Social
Value, pretended to be a
documentary. It began with some
clever erotic drawings by Tomi
Ungerer, and some cute
pornographic puppets, while a
narrator read portions of the
President's Report on Obscenity.
Times Square Hustlers
This was followed by a
discussion on "What pornography

means to me," presumably part of
the research that went into the
report. A group of "average
citizens," most of whom looked
like Times Square hustlers, were
assembled in a room to watch
some porno flicks and give their
reactions to them.
The pornos themselves were
rather interesting, spanning the
decades from 1925 to the
mid-6 O's. If nothing else, they
demonstrated how little biology
has changed in 40 years.
One cute little number was
called "Double Dildo," and
managed to combine Lesbianism,
auto-eroticism, and the
machine-age in an all-too-brief
two minutes. But the climax, as it
were, came with a short film
involving a languid brunette and a
rather large boxer dog who was
doing something very sloppy to
her genitals. At this point a very
fat bearded man sitting behind me
began to laugh hysterically,
