# Summer News Summary
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
Stanford's pulse beats much slower in the summertime—at a rate
approaching comatose, some would say. But there are some news
events amid all the sunshine. —The major political event during the
past four months was the firing of five workers allegedly involved in
last spring's Hospital sit-in. The grievance hearings which followed are
still going on. —The summer also included the trials left over from the
campus arrests last year, one major bombing and a minor arson, and a
split in the radical group Venceremos. —A new medical school dean
and a campus police chief were named by administrators. —Street
people held dances at the Plaza on University Avenue, there were
movies on campus and crowded weekends at the beach, and Felt Lake
became a secret haven until police stepped in.
The student body shrinks in the summer from 1 1,000 to about
4,000. Many summer students are visitors from other colleges,
sampling Stanford or attending special summer institutes.
Some summer events—including the raid on MECHA house and a
student report on Defense Department research— will be described in
separate Daily articles this week. But here is a summary of other news
events this summer:
Nelson Home Bombed
A pipe bomb damaged the campus home of Robert M. Nelson,
University Director of Personnel and Employee Relations, July 12.
The late night blast blew a hole in a bedroom wall and damaged a
concrete wall outside the bedroom. There were no injuries to the
three people at home. Nelson's daughter Debbie, 18, was standing in
the bedroom that was damaged.
FBI and police agents began an investigation, but no leads have
been reported.
Nelson, who resigned from his University post last week, was at the
time representing the University in the controversial firing of five
workers allegedly involved in the April 9 Hospital sit-in. He was also
involved in the University's Affirmative Action Program for minority
employment.
FCM Fire
An arson fire slightly damaged the headquarters of the conservative
Free Campus Movement (FCM), July 27. About $100 damage was
caused by the fire, which was apparently set by pouring paint thinner
on a wall of the house, located near the Post Office.
A student sleeping in the building was not injured. The FCM was
not using the building during the summer.
The arson was the third attempt in slightly more than a year to

damage the Free Market, as the FCM house is known. The FCM was
formed in late 1969 when its members split from Young Americans
for Freedom. There have been numerous fights between FCM
members and campus revolutionaries, many of them involving FCM's
attempts to photograph demonstrations and radical trashing.
Medical School Dean Appointed
Dr. Clayton Rich took office Sept. 1 as Dean of Stanford's medical
school. He had been an associate dean of the University of Washington
School of Medicine.
The 4 7-year-old specialist in bone diseases succeeded Acting Dean
John L. Wilson. Wilson has served as acting dean since Dr. Robert L.
Glaser resigned a year ago to become Vice President of the
Commonwealth Fund in New York.
Rich stressed the need to improve health care delivery. "It has
become apparent in the past few years that the system in this country
isn't working very well," he said. "We'll have to devise better ways of
providing proper health care to everyone, not just a few."
Tresidder Report
An ASSU committee report in August demanded the firing of
Tresidder Union's director and business manager for "their record of
ineptitude in every field of management."
The report blasts the current directors of the Union for their
personnel practices and financial management. The ASSU started the
inquiry last spring, after 12 Tresidder workers were laid off in
February. Activists challenged the Union throughout spring quarter
with a boycott and "alternative food service."
The report vociferously denounced the leadership of Tresidder
Director Forrest Tregea and Business Manager Phillip Duffy but
presented few concrete examples of wrongdoing. Tregea said the
report "seems to be a number of distortions of fact, allegations not
supported by any kind of evidence that's produced."
But junior Scott Burke, who chaired the ASSU committee, insisted
the report was based on a fair and exhaustive study. The report urged
disbandment of the Tresidder Union Committee, which oversees the
Union. It called that committee a "rubber stamp" for Tresidder's
management.
Burke, who also belongs to the Tresidder committee, said the three
other student members agree with the ASSU report.
But Tresidder committee chairman Mason Yearian, a physics
professor, said the majority of the committee supports T>egea's
leadership.

events this summer:
Nelson Home Bombed
A pipe bomb damaged the campus home of Robert M. Nelson,
University Director of Personnel and Employee Relations, July 12.
The late night blast blew a hole in a bedroom wall and damaged a
concrete wall outside the bedroom. There were no injuries to the
three people at home. Nelson's daughter Debbie, 18, was standing in
the bedroom that was damaged.
FBI and police agents began an investigation, but no leads have
been reported.
Nelson, who resigned from his University post last week, was at the
time representing the University in the controversial firing of five
workers allegedly involved in the April 9 Hospital sit-in. He was also
involved in the University's Affirmative Action Program for minority
employment.
FCM Fire
An arson fire slightly damaged the headquarters of the conservative
Free Campus Movement (FCM), July 27. About $100 damage was
caused by the fire, which was apparently set by pouring paint thinner
on a wall of the house, located near the Post Office.
A student sleeping in the building was not injured. The FCM was
not using the building during the summer.
The arson was the third attempt in slightly more than a year to

damage the Free Market, as the FCM house is known. The FCM was
formed in late 1969 when its members split from Young Americans
for Freedom. There have been numerous fights between FCM
members and campus revolutionaries, many of them involving FCM's
attempts to photograph demonstrations and radical trashing.
Medical School Dean Appointed
Dr. Clayton Rich took office Sept. 1 as Dean of Stanford's medical
school. He had been an associate dean of the University of Washington
School of Medicine.
The 4 7-year-old specialist in bone diseases succeeded Acting Dean
John L. Wilson. Wilson has served as acting dean since Dr. Robert L.
Glaser resigned a year ago to become Vice President of the
Commonwealth Fund in New York.
Rich stressed the need to improve health care delivery. "It has
become apparent in the past few years that the system in this country
isn't working very well," he said. "We'll have to devise better ways of
providing proper health care to everyone, not just a few."
Tresidder Report
An ASSU committee report in August demanded the firing of
Tresidder Union's director and business manager for "their record of
ineptitude in every field of management."
The report blasts the current directors of the Union for their
personnel practices and financial management. The ASSU started the
inquiry last spring, after 12 Tresidder workers were laid off in
February. Activists challenged the Union throughout spring quarter
with a boycott and "alternative food service."
The report vociferously denounced the leadership of Tresidder
Director Forrest Tregea and Business Manager Phillip Duffy but
presented few concrete examples of wrongdoing. Tregea said the
report "seems to be a number of distortions of fact, allegations not
supported by any kind of evidence that's produced."
But junior Scott Burke, who chaired the ASSU committee, insisted
the report was based on a fair and exhaustive study. The report urged
disbandment of the Tresidder Union Committee, which oversees the
Union. It called that committee a "rubber stamp" for Tresidder's
management.
Burke, who also belongs to the Tresidder committee, said the three
other student members agree with the ASSU report.
But Tresidder committee chairman Mason Yearian, a physics
professor, said the majority of the committee supports T>egea's
leadership.
Stanford's pulse beats much slower in the summertime—at a rate
approaching comatose, some would say. But there are some news
events amid all the sunshine. —The major political event during the
past four months was the firing of five workers allegedly involved in
last spring's Hospital sit-in. The grievance hearings which followed are
still going on. —The summer also included the trials left over from the
campus arrests last year, one major bombing and a minor arson, and a
split in the radical group Venceremos. —A new medical school dean
and a campus police chief were named by administrators. —Street
people held dances at the Plaza on University Avenue, there were
movies on campus and crowded weekends at the beach, and Felt Lake
became a secret haven until police stepped in.
The student body shrinks in the summer from 1 1,000 to about
4,000. Many summer students are visitors from other colleges,
sampling Stanford or attending special summer institutes.

student report on Defense Department research— will be described in
