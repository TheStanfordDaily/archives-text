# More Summer Fun Follies
## 
### 
Felt Lake
By mid-June, gate-crashers were tearing down the fences to reach
the hidden pleasures of Felt Lake on land behind campus. Dairyman
Menuel Piers, who leases the land from Stanford, sighed, "I'm about
to throw in the sponge."
He said hundreds of swimmers, fishermen and campers were
swarming over the land and disturbing his cows. Piers had tough words
for the fence-destroyers: "They ought to be clubbed."
F'or the crashers, Felt Lake's attraction was its secluded location
and natural surroundings. But within a few weeks, even the most
stubborn sun-worshippers had been cleared off of Piers land by a
strike force of police chasing them away in cars, on horses, and even
in helicopters.
Minority Report
Minority group demands issued last year were discussed in a July
statement by the University. A $20,000 grant for a Chicano Studies
program and a $50,000 fund to attract minority faculty members
were the most substantial innovations described in the report. A grant
to study possibilities for a Black Studies Institute was also reported.
The document was written by Associate Provost Raymond
Bacchetti and was a summary of official replies given earlier to
minority groups.
Bacchetti insisted that many of the new projects in the report
would have been granted without protests and absolute demands by
minority groups. Spokesmen for MECHA and the BSU called the
report a token response to their demands.
Major items in the report included: -FACULTY: A $50,000 fund
will help hire new minority faculty members. The University rejected
demands that new minority faculty bo assigned directly to ethnic
studies programs rather than regular departments. —ACADEMICS:
Funds were promised to continue three courses in Asian-American
heritage. Afro-American Studies received a $20,000 budget boost, and
BSU got a $4 ,25 0 planning grant—but no final approval—for a Black
Studies Institute it demanded. MECHA's demand for a Chicano
Studies Program was answered by a $20,000 budget to begin the
project. —ADMISSIONS: Demands to substantially increase minority
admissions won no direct answer. But Bacchetti reported that an
Academic Council committee is studying the topic. —HOUSING:
Asian, Black, Chicano, and American Indian groups all were granted
dorms with high ethnic concentrations. But MECHA and Native
Americans had demanded higher concentrations than the 50 per cent
maximum they were given in two houses. —STAFF: Bacchetti
conceded "a gap exists" between promise and performance in the
Affirmative Action Program for hiring minority staff members. He
said advancement of minority employees to supervisory positions has
seldom occured and will become a priority this year. —COMMUNITY:
Bacchetti said laws prohibit direct University aid to outside
communities. University funds were denied to MECHA for a program
to inform Santa Clara County Chicanos of their legal rights.
The University supplied two van-type vehicles for a MECHA
tutoring program and added a second van to a similar BSU project.
The report pointed to a planned housing project on Stanford land as a
response to local shortages of low and moderate income housing.
Free U Dies
The Midpeninsula Free University quietly died this summer, ending
a six-year-old educational experiment. Members of the revolutionary
groups Venceremos, who had led the Free U for the last year, said the
Free U's esoteric courses in candle-making and encounter groups did
not serve working-class people it wanted to reach. And Venceremos

suggested that those traditionally involved in the programs had lost
interest.
But others involved with the Free U insisted Venceremos had
misdirected the Free U and driven away many of its supporters
through emphasis of radical action over counter-culture classes.
Associate Provost
Prof. Gene F. Franklin, electrical engineering, has been named
associate provost for computing.
Franklin, in the post held by Provost William F. Miller from 1968
to 1970, will serve as staff adviser to the Provost on computing and
related problems. He wil! be responsible for the coordination of the
University's computing facilities and programs.
He will continue to teach with the new position taking
approximately 50 per cent of his time.
Franklin will also continue his work on a demonstration project in
patient monitoring during surgery and he will continue as director of
the Information Systems Laboratory in the Stanford Electronics
Laboratories.
Secretary to the Univenity
Frederic O. Glover has been appointed Secretary to the University,
a new University post.
Glover, who has been executive assistant to the president, will
work primarily with the Board of Trustees and handle much
University correspondence in his new post.

DARE TO STRUGGLE—Summer at Stanford is known for its
high pressure environment. The physics student shown above is
testing the resiliancy of concrete, w'Mle simultaneously measuring
the solar constant and monitoring the rate of flow of water through
the claw. A nine unit course load can really get you down.
