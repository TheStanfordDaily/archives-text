# Campus Venceremos Splits
## 
### BILL EVERS 
About half of the Stanford campus contingent
of Venceremos, a San Francisco Peninsula
revolutionary communist group, left the
organization this summer and re-emerged as an
all-white "intercommunal" subgroup of the
Oakland Black Panther Party.
The division and secession came after the
Venceremos central committee decided that the
activities and policies of the Oakland Panthers
(headed by Huey Newton, David Hilliard and
Bobby Seale) were "revisionist."
The group which left Venceremos is now called
the Intercommunal Survival Committee (ISC) of
the Black Panther Party.
In a decision which may have important
repercussions for events at Stanford this fall, the
newly-formed ISC has decided that its members
will concentrate on the sort of community service
programs and welfare rights advocacy that the
Oakland Panthers have been engaged in since they
broke with Eldridge Cleaver, rather than
organizing around the disciplinary hearing of
suspended Associate Professor of English H. Bruce
Franklin, who is a member of the central
committee of Venceremos.
Franklin faces possible dismissal from his
position on the faculty for his alleged participation
last academic year in the disruption of Henry
Cabot Lodge's speech and in various activities at
the time of campus troubles over the Computation
Center. (See related story, page 1.)
"Other Priorities"
Miriam Cherry, who works on campus in
association with the Roman Catholic Newman
Center in Palo Alto, and who after she left
Venceremos, became a leading figure in the ISC,
told The Daily:
"We have other priorities, We don't see
spending a lot of time fighting—by leafleting, in
rallies, going to Bruce's class—to fight for a white
male intellectual's job, when we know there are
people sitting on death row. We want to free those
people on death row now. That takes a lot of
work, arduous work, every day . . .We have to
question Bruce's contributions, in terms of the
revolution, by staying here at Stanford."
Thus, on campus, the split revolves around the
leadership and practical guidance of two important
Stanford revolutionaries: Franklin and Cherry. In
addition, the split reflects some of the
organizational difficulties inherent in a project
which both those who still remain in Venceremos
and those who have left share as a goal. This
project is the creation of a multi-racial,
revolutionary political organization, which as a
matter of principle for them is to be headed by
non-whites.
"Racist Sissies"
At the time of the split, the brown members of
the Venceremos central committee denounced
those who had left the organization as "racist
sissies" and "oppressors."
They made two major points in their argument.
First, they said that any white radical who is not

in the multi-national—and Third World
controlled—democratic-centralist organization in
his geographical area is objectively a racist and an
oppressor. (This was said before those who left
had affiliated formally with the Oakland
Panthers.)
Venceremos also said that those who left had,
after voluntarily pledging "to be duty-bound by
the Third World leaderhsip and Third World
comrades of Venceremos," gone against the Third
World membership, which unanimously agreed
with the critique of the Oakland Panthers. On the
other hand, the ISC group considered that its
Third World command came from the vanguard
Black Panther Party.
The second point made by the brown members
of the Venceremos central committee was that
those who left Venceremos are "sissies" because
they believe (as the Oakland Black Panthers do)
that in the present situation, political and
"military" (i.e., terrorist) cadre should be separate
from one another and because they have chosen to
be political cadre, working in community service
programs. Venceremos believesthat the "absolutely
correct strategy for revolutionary armed struggle
in the U.S." is "protracted war based on urban
guerrilla warfare."
Panthers Criticized
The Venceremos position paper critiquing the
Oakland Panthers states: "George Jackson [who
before his death was a member of the Oakland
faction of the Panthers] stresses the need for a
total separation between political work, which
consists of serve-the-people programs in no way
related to guns, and military work, which is
undertaken spontaneously by the masses who
form decentralized guerrilla units.
"Any connection between the political and
military aspects would merely give the pigs an
'excuse to attack our political projects.' This line
represents a complete cop-out by the party in its
main responsibility in military affairs to provide
concrete political leadership."
In contrast, members of the ISC see as their
most important political task setting up voluntary
welfare programs, especially in the areas of health
services (sickle-cell anemia tests, training
technicians from out of the poor population),
prisoners' support (busing friends and relatives to
visit those >n jail, writing to prisoners), repair
services (fro repair of broken plumbing,
automobiles, and electrical systems), and
youth-oriented services (for example, their Marie
Hill child care program in Sunnyvale, named after
a mentally-unbalanced young black woman
sentenced to death—but not yet executed—in
North Carolina in 1968 for the murder of a white
grocer).
ISC members say they believe in self-defense,
which for them means defending "survival
programs," like these community service
programs. But they do not approve of
"revolutionary cultists" brandishing guns to
provoke the police.
