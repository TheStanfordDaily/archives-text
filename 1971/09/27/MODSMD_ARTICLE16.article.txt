# Eleven Chicanos Arrested
## 
### Theresa Ramirez 
Thirteen persons, eight of them Stanford
students, face charges of disturbing the peace, and
resisting, as a result of an August 17 clash with
police at the campus headquarters of the Chicano
organization, MECHA.
The arrests were made at approximately 3:30
a.m. by Santa Clara County Sheriff's Deputies
after they answered a call for reinforcements made
by the Stanford Police.
Stanford police officers Charles Blalock and
Carrol Wood, reported that persons on the porch
of the MECHA clubhouse threw rocks and bottles
and shouted obscenities at them as they drove by.
The sheriffs, who arrived about 3:00 a.m., said
someone inside shouted "Don't come in, we're
armed." The persons in the house were then
ordered out, but refused to do so. The deputies
then entered and made the arrests.
Weapons Found
No shots were fired during the incident, however,
and no one was reported injured.
The Stanford police officers had been
investigating a report made between 2:30 and 3:00
a.m. by Assistant Dean of Students for housing,
Larry Horton, that someone had hurled several
large rocks through the windows of his Wilbur Hall
apartment.
Horton said that neither he nor Stanford's new
police chief, Marvin Herrington, who was staying
in Horton's guest room that evening, saw the
persons responsible, nor did they hear any voices.
Controversy Over Arrests
Controversy arose immediately over the
circumstances surrounding the arrests. A statement
released by Gilbert Garcia, president of MECHA,
and Carlos Jackson, assistant dean of students,
charged that arresting officers destroyed property
inside the house, and that sheriff's deputies denied
requests made by several university officials to
enter the house and witness the arrests.
According to the statement, sheriffs turned
over couches and chairs, kicked a wall in, and
damaged expensive photographic equipment.

The statement also said that the students were
transported to police vehicles dressed only in their
underwear, and that sheriffs ignored pleas made by
Jackson, other administrators, and the Stanford
police to permit the students to put on their
clothes.
Acting Dean of Students, Bill Freelan, in a
statement released September 15, says that when
he identified himself to one of the sheriff's officers
at the scene, the officer waved a shotgun at him
and told him to stay on the other side of the
street.
Freelan also reported that he could hear what
sounded like drawers being emptied, coming from
inside the house.
He said he saw the contents of drawers and
"anything else which contained paper, clothing,
etc., had been emptied onto the floor," including a
dark room in which developing paper had been
strewn about.
Police Respond
Questioned as to why university officials were
not allowed inside while the arrests were being
made, one sheriff said that he first talked to Garcia
outside the house. The sheriff said he had asked
Garcia to use the bullhorn to get the people out.
When Garcia refused, the sheriff said he did not
have time to deal with any more administrators.
An official from the sheriff's office said about
the students being transported to jail in their
underwear, that in cases involving weapons,
suspects are not allowed to put their clothes on to
prevent the possible obtaining of weapons.
Those arrested were: Ray Espinoza, Manuel
Sandoval, Joaquin Aranda, Ramon Avalos, Rafael
Robles, Jose Pareles, Jose Razo, Mario Esparza, all
students; Salvador Lopez and Alfonso Rocha,
non-students, and a 15-year-old brother of one of
the students.
Originally arrested on charges ranging from
assault, to assault with intent to commit murder,
ten of those arrested pleaded not guilty September
7 in Palo Alto Municipal Court to disturbing the
peace and resisting and have demanded a jury trial.
The case will be set for trial on October 21, in Palo
Alto.

police to permit the students to put on their
clothes.
Acting Dean of Students, Bill Freelan, in a
statement released September 15, says that when
he identified himself to one of the sheriff's officers
at the scene, the officer waved a shotgun at him
and told him to stay on the other side of the
street.
Freelan also reported that he could hear what
sounded like drawers being emptied, coming from
inside the house.
He said he saw the contents of drawers and
"anything else which contained paper, clothing,
etc., had been emptied onto the floor," including a
dark room in which developing paper had been
strewn about.
Police Respond
Questioned as to why university officials were
not allowed inside while the arrests were being
made, one sheriff said that he first talked to Garcia
outside the house. The sheriff said he had asked
Garcia to use the bullhorn to get the people out.
When Garcia refused, the sheriff said he did not
have time to deal with any more administrators.
An official from the sheriff's office said about
the students being transported to jail in their
underwear, that in cases involving weapons,
suspects are not allowed to put their clothes on to
prevent the possible obtaining of weapons.
Those arrested were: Ray Espinoza, Manuel
Sandoval, Joaquin Aranda, Ramon Avalos, Rafael
Robles, Jose Pareles, Jose Razo, Mario Esparza, all
students; Salvador Lopez and Alfonso Rocha,
non-students, and a 15-year-old brother of one of
the students.
Originally arrested on charges ranging from
assault, to assault with intent to commit murder,
ten of those arrested pleaded not guilty September
7 in Palo Alto Municipal Court to disturbing the
peace and resisting and have demanded a jury trial.
The case will be set for trial on October 21, in Palo
Alto.
Thirteen persons, eight of them Stanford
students, face charges of disturbing the peace, and
resisting, as a result of an August 17 clash with
police at the campus headquarters of the Chicano
organization, MECHA.
The arrests were made at approximately 3:30
a.m. by Santa Clara County Sheriff's Deputies
after they answered a call for reinforcements made
by the Stanford Police.
Stanford police officers Charles Blalock and
Carrol Wood, reported that persons on the porch
of the MECHA clubhouse threw rocks and bottles
and shouted obscenities at them as they drove by.
The sheriffs, who arrived about 3:00 a.m., said
someone inside shouted "Don't come in, we're
armed." The persons in the house were then
ordered out, but refused to do so. The deputies
then entered and made the arrests.
Weapons Found
No shots were fired during the incident, however,
and no one was reported injured.
The Stanford police officers had been
investigating a report made between 2:30 and 3:00
a.m. by Assistant Dean of Students for housing,
Larry Horton, that someone had hurled several
large rocks through the windows of his Wilbur Hall
apartment.
Horton said that neither he nor Stanford's new
police chief, Marvin Herrington, who was staying
in Horton's guest room that evening, saw the
persons responsible, nor did they hear any voices.
Controversy Over Arrests
Controversy arose immediately over the
circumstances surrounding the arrests. A statement
released by Gilbert Garcia, president of MECHA,
and Carlos Jackson, assistant dean of students,
charged that arresting officers destroyed property
inside the house, and that sheriff's deputies denied
requests made by several university officials to
enter the house and witness the arrests.
According to the statement, sheriffs turned
over couches and chairs, kicked a wall in, and
damaged expensive photographic equipment.

The statement also said that the students were
transported to police vehicles dressed only in their
underwear, and that sheriffs ignored pleas made by
Jackson, other administrators, and the Stanford
police to permit the students to put on their
clothes.
