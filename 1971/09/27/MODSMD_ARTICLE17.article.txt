# Grievance Cases Resolved, Continue
## 
### BOB LITTERMAN 
Grievance hearings have been taking place throughout the summer
for five university employees fired in June for their "unacceptable
behaviour" stemming from alleged participation in the April 9
hospital sit-in. Hearings are still continuing in several cases.
The five workers, Anthoney Chatmon, John Dolly, John Keilch,
Barbara Mooney and Devera Satisky, were dismissed by Robert
Nelson, director of personnel. All five filed for grievance procedures
to review the action.
So far, Chatmon has been reinstated, Keilch and Satisky have
started hearings which are continuing, Dolly started hearings, but they
have been temporarily suspended, and Mooney has yet to start.
Several demonstrations in support of the workers, four of whom
belonged to the revolutionary group Venceremos, were held in June.
Procedures Begun
Because the dismissal action was taken by the administration and
not the employee's department, grievance procedures were begun at
the third stage of the normal procedures, that of a hearing before
three other employees appointed one each by the administration, the
department involved, and the employee.
The first grievance committee was formed in July for Dolly, a
genetics lab worker in the hospital. Dolly's committee at first
recommended that he be rehired and the grievance be suspended until
after his pending criminal charges were heard.
These recommendations were denied by Provost Miller and the
hearings began. Meanwhile Nelson's house was attacked with a pipe
bomb (see related story on page 4).
Nelson Testifies
At the first open hearing Nelson testified and was questioned by
Dolly's counsel, Associate Professor H. Bruce Franklin. The hearings
were soon stalled, however, as Franklin was ruled ineligible to appear
as counsel and the chairman of the committee, H. Keith Brodie,
resigned for personal reasons.
In late July Law Professor Byron Sher was appointed by the
administration to head Dolly's committee and also those of Keilch,
Chatmon, and Satisky.
Dolly's grievance soon stalled again, however, as two of the three
members of his committee resigned. The resignations followed a
confrontation over Sher's right to act as chairman of the committee.
From then on the departmental representative, not the administrative
representative, acted as chairman in the hearings.
Closed Hearings
Late in August Chatmon began his hearings in closed session. After
two hearings his committee, which included Sher, Elwood Pierce, and
John T. Wilson, recommended that he be rehired with back pay from
August 1. The basis of the recommendation was reportedly that
Nelson had not shown conclusively that Chatmon's actions in
connection with the sit-in constituted unacceptable behaviour.
Hearings were also begun for John Keilch late in August and are
still continuing. So far there have been five sessions at which Nelson
and University lawyer Corneilius Cullen have testified. The main
problem so far in Keilch's hearings has been the refusal of four
administrators including President Lyman to appear.
After a series of requests from the committee the administration
refused saying, "To permit such an inquiry would invade the
confidences essential to the effective support of responsible University
officers and reek havoc in the operations of the University."
Keilch
Keilch's hearing will resume Thursday in open session at 1:30 p.m.
in room 82 of the graduate school of business. At that time Nelson
and former Acting Dean of the Medical School John L. Wilson, are
scheduled to testify.
Keilch reports that he will attempt to show that the firings were
"conditioned by a reign of over-reaction and political repression on
campus," and that the hospital sit-in was caused by a "background of
institutional racism at Stanford."
The hearings for Satisky were begun earlier this month and are also
continuing. She has had three hearings so far ar which Nelson, Wilson,
and Thomas Gonda, Associate Dean of the Medical School, have
testified. Satisky's hearings will resume tomorrow in open session at 4
p.m. in room 84 of the Graduate School of Business.
Hearings for Dolly have yet to resume, although the administration
has appointed a new representative, Iris Brest. Mooney's grievance has
been held up because she has been arguing that it should include a
departmental review before going to the stage of committee hearings.
Meanwhile, Mooney has continued her work in the biology
department through funds provided outside the University.

for five university employees fired in June for their "unacceptable
behaviour" stemming from alleged participation in the April 9
hospital sit-in. Hearings are still continuing in several cases.
The five workers, Anthoney Chatmon, John Dolly, John Keilch,
Barbara Mooney and Devera Satisky, were dismissed by Robert
Nelson, director of personnel. All five filed for grievance procedures
to review the action.
So far, Chatmon has been reinstated, Keilch and Satisky have
started hearings which are continuing, Dolly started hearings, but they
have been temporarily suspended, and Mooney has yet to start.
Several demonstrations in support of the workers, four of whom
belonged to the revolutionary group Venceremos, were held in June.
Procedures Begun
Because the dismissal action was taken by the administration and
not the employee's department, grievance procedures were begun at
the third stage of the normal procedures, that of a hearing before
three other employees appointed one each by the administration, the
department involved, and the employee.
The first grievance committee was formed in July for Dolly, a
genetics lab worker in the hospital. Dolly's committee at first
recommended that he be rehired and the grievance be suspended until
after his pending criminal charges were heard.
These recommendations were denied by Provost Miller and the
hearings began. Meanwhile Nelson's house was attacked with a pipe
bomb (see related story on page 4).
Nelson Testifies
At the first open hearing Nelson testified and was questioned by
Dolly's counsel, Associate Professor H. Bruce Franklin. The hearings
were soon stalled, however, as Franklin was ruled ineligible to appear
as counsel and the chairman of the committee, H. Keith Brodie,
resigned for personal reasons.
In late July Law Professor Byron Sher was appointed by the
administration to head Dolly's committee and also those of Keilch,
Chatmon, and Satisky.
Dolly's grievance soon stalled again, however, as two of the three
members of his committee resigned. The resignations followed a
confrontation over Sher's right to act as chairman of the committee.
From then on the departmental representative, not the administrative
representative, acted as chairman in the hearings.
Closed Hearings
Late in August Chatmon began his hearings in closed session. After
two hearings his committee, which included Sher, Elwood Pierce, and
John T. Wilson, recommended that he be rehired with back pay from
August 1. The basis of the recommendation was reportedly that
Nelson had not shown conclusively that Chatmon's actions in
connection with the sit-in constituted unacceptable behaviour.
Hearings were also begun for John Keilch late in August and are
still continuing. So far there have been five sessions at which Nelson
and University lawyer Corneilius Cullen have testified. The main
problem so far in Keilch's hearings has been the refusal of four
administrators including President Lyman to appear.
After a series of requests from the committee the administration
refused saying, "To permit such an inquiry would invade the
confidences essential to the effective support of responsible University
officers and reek havoc in the operations of the University."
Keilch
Keilch's hearing will resume Thursday in open session at 1:30 p.m.
in room 82 of the graduate school of business. At that time Nelson
and former Acting Dean of the Medical School John L. Wilson, are
scheduled to testify.
Keilch reports that he will attempt to show that the firings were
"conditioned by a reign of over-reaction and political repression on
campus," and that the hospital sit-in was caused by a "background of
institutional racism at Stanford."
The hearings for Satisky were begun earlier this month and are also
continuing. She has had three hearings so far ar which Nelson, Wilson,
and Thomas Gonda, Associate Dean of the Medical School, have
testified. Satisky's hearings will resume tomorrow in open session at 4
p.m. in room 84 of the Graduate School of Business.
Hearings for Dolly have yet to resume, although the administration
has appointed a new representative, Iris Brest. Mooney's grievance has
been held up because she has been arguing that it should include a
departmental review before going to the stage of committee hearings.
Meanwhile, Mooney has continued her work in the biology
department through funds provided outside the University.
