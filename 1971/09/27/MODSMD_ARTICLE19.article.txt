# Freshmen Ponder 'Why Am I Here?'
## 
### FRANK MILLER BOB BACON 
Amid half-unpacked suitcases,
worrying and scurrying parents,
house advisors trying to find keys
to rooms, and Stanford men
looking for freshman "Dollies," a
number of freshmen surrendered
to inquisitive reporters with their
not very intelligent questions.
But most were very patient and
explained why they came to
Stanford and what they hope to
get out of their time here.
SALLY VAUGHN: "Why am I
here? That's a good question.
"It's been fun so far; it's been a
big party. We had a great football
game out on the lawn today. The
teachers and all the staff seem
friendly.
"I like the liberal, relaxed,
casual community atmosphere.
The eastern schools I applied to
seemed more conservative.
"I liked the European program;
that's one reason I came.
"What do I hope to get out of
it? An education. And happiness."
CRAIG GLASS: "I never really

thought about why I wanted to
come here... It has a good
reputation—it's supposed to be a
good school.
"You talk to anyone on the
street and they know about
Stanford. There are all different
kinds of people here and I want to
see what it's about."
CHRIS GRAY: "I felt that the
most important thing about a
college is the atmosphere.
Stanford has an intellectual
atmosphere. At a Cal campus you

can still get good prolessors but
you can't duplicate the
atmosphere.
"Stanford generates ideas by
its atmosphere—at least I hope it
does. It costs a helluva lot of
money.
"Beyond that, I look forward
to meeting people and establishing
contacts with ideas. I like to play
with ideas and I hope to develop
that and mature."
SUSIE PHILIPS: "It has a better
theory of education—a better

definition of what we're doing
here. It's not quite so serious.
KIKI STALLCUP: "Why am I
here? To get an education, I guess.
I want to make my decision on
what I want to do with my life."
ROD CODE: "It appealed to me
as a place where you could
develop intellectually. It seems
like a good place to diversify."
MIKE NEWMAN: "It's big
enough to offer what you want
and small enough not to feel
lost."

MOVING DAY—Friday was the day Freshmen established residence in the Stanford dorms. The three
fellows in the foreground have just finished hauling the last pieces of luggage for the smiling Dolly. The
older frosh in the background is her cousin who is enrolling under the G.I. Bill of Rights.

Amid half-unpacked suitcases,
worrying and scurrying parents,
house advisors trying to find keys
to rooms, and Stanford men
looking for freshman "Dollies," a
number of freshmen surrendered
to inquisitive reporters with their
not very intelligent questions.
But most were very patient and
explained why they came to
Stanford and what they hope to
get out of their time here.
SALLY VAUGHN: "Why am I
here? That's a good question.
"It's been fun so far; it's been a
big party. We had a great football
game out on the lawn today. The
teachers and all the staff seem
friendly.
"I like the liberal, relaxed,
casual community atmosphere.
The eastern schools I applied to
seemed more conservative.
"I liked the European program;
that's one reason I came.
"What do I hope to get out of
it? An education. And happiness."
CRAIG GLASS: "I never really

thought about why I wanted to
come here... It has a good
reputation—it's supposed to be a
good school.
"You talk to anyone on the
street and they know about
Stanford. There are all different
kinds of people here and I want to
see what it's about."
CHRIS GRAY: "I felt that the
most important thing about a
college is the atmosphere.
Stanford has an intellectual
atmosphere. At a Cal campus you

can still get good prolessors but
you can't duplicate the
atmosphere.
"Stanford generates ideas by
its atmosphere—at least I hope it
does. It costs a helluva lot of
money.
"Beyond that, I look forward
to meeting people and establishing
contacts with ideas. I like to play
with ideas and I hope to develop
that and mature."
SUSIE PHILIPS: "It has a better
theory of education—a better

definition of what we're doing
here. It's not quite so serious.
KIKI STALLCUP: "Why am I
here? To get an education, I guess.
I want to make my decision on
what I want to do with my life."
ROD CODE: "It appealed to me
as a place where you could
develop intellectually. It seems
like a good place to diversify."
MIKE NEWMAN: "It's big
enough to offer what you want
and small enough not to feel
lost."
