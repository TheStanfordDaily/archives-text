# Personnel Head Quits

### SCOTT THACHER 
Robert M. Nelson, Stanford's
director of personnel, who often bore
the brunt of dissatisfaction with
employee firings and lay-offs during
the past year, has resigned.
The decision, announced last
Wednesday, was described as
voluntary. Nelson, 46, says he has "no
immediate plans for the future."
So far no one has been chosen to fill
Nelson's post when he actually leaves
on October 15. He was originally hired
in December 1969 to a newly created
position responsible for all personnel
activities as well as employee
relationships throughout the
University.
No specific reasons have been given
for the resignation, although Nelson
commented that "events have moved
quickly" in recent days.
Administrators both above and
below Nelson who were available for
comment, either were unwilling to
speculate on the reasons or frankly
stated they had no knowledge of the
circumstances.
Bombing
A pipe bomb exploded outside of
Nelson's home last July 12, nearly
injuring his 18-year-old daughter. A
$ 10,000 reward offered by the
University has failed to produce any
arrests.
Earlier, five workers had been fired
by Nelson for their participation in the

April 9 sit-in at the Stanford Hospital.
Nelson was then the object of several
peaceful demonstrations outside his
Encina office.
During the rest of the summer
Nelson took part in grievance hearings
for the fired workers. Recently he
described the grievance procedures as
"a less than satisfactory means of
resolving complaints and problems
presented by employees."
Independent Arbiter
He recommends the use of an
"independent and experienced arbiter"
rather than the three-man committees
now chosen from the University by the
administration, the employee, and the
personnel office.
Before he leaves Nelson expects to
see out the current grievance hearings
which may last two or three weeks.
Nelson's office has been active in
running the affirmative action program
designed to recruit and train minority
employees for a wider range of jobs in
the University. It has made "very real
gains," he says.
Employee Organizations
In addition he has seen the
development of employee
organizations on campus, such as the
United Stanford Employees (USE),
whose official status now depends on
the decision of the National Labor
Relations Board.

On Nelson's resignation, President
Richard Lyman said, "Bob Nelson has
carried a heavy and complex
responsibility in the University at a
time when University personnel work
is more difficult and demanding than
ever before."
Nelson was personnel chief at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator (SLAC)
for a year and a half before coming
here, and held a similar job at the
Lawrence Radiation Laboratories for
12 years prior to that.
He is a graduate of Whitman
College, and received a Master of Arts
degree from the University of Chicago.
A recent reshuffling of the Stanford
administration put the position of
director of personnel under Robert
Augsburger, vice president for business
and finance, who will be responsible
for choosing Nelson's successor.

personnel office.
Before he leaves Nelson expects to
see out the current grievance hearings
which may last two or three weeks.
Nelson's office has been active in
running the affirmative action program
designed to recruit and train minority
employees for a wider range of jobs in
the University. It has made "very real
gains," he says.
Employee Organizations
In addition he has seen the
development of employee
organizations on campus, such as the
United Stanford Employees (USE),
whose official status now depends on
the decision of the National Labor
Relations Board.

On Nelson's resignation, President
Richard Lyman said, "Bob Nelson has
carried a heavy and complex
responsibility in the University at a
time when University personnel work
is more difficult and demanding than
ever before."
Nelson was personnel chief at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator (SLAC)
for a year and a half before coming
here, and held a similar job at the
Lawrence Radiation Laboratories for
12 years prior to that.
He is a graduate of Whitman
College, and received a Master of Arts
degree from the University of Chicago.
A recent reshuffling of the Stanford
administration put the position of
director of personnel under Robert
Augsburger, vice president for business
and finance, who will be responsible
for choosing Nelson's successor.
Robert M. Nelson, Stanford's
director of personnel, who often bore
the brunt of dissatisfaction with
employee firings and lay-offs during
the past year, has resigned.
The decision, announced last
Wednesday, was described as
voluntary. Nelson, 46, says he has "no
immediate plans for the future."
So far no one has been chosen to fill
Nelson's post when he actually leaves
on October 15. He was originally hired
in December 1969 to a newly created
position responsible for all personnel
activities as well as employee
relationships throughout the
University.
No specific reasons have been given
for the resignation, although Nelson
commented that "events have moved
quickly" in recent days.
Administrators both above and
below Nelson who were available for
comment, either were unwilling to
speculate on the reasons or frankly
stated they had no knowledge of the
circumstances.
Bombing
A pipe bomb exploded outside of
Nelson's home last July 12, nearly
injuring his 18-year-old daughter. A
$ 10,000 reward offered by the
University has failed to produce any
arrests.
Earlier, five workers had been fired
by Nelson for their participation in the

April 9 sit-in at the Stanford Hospital.
Nelson was then the object of several
peaceful demonstrations outside his
Encina office.
During the rest of the summer
Nelson took part in grievance hearings
for the fired workers. Recently he
described the grievance procedures as
"a less than satisfactory means of
resolving complaints and problems
presented by employees."
Independent Arbiter
He recommends the use of an
"independent and experienced arbiter"
rather than the three-man committees
now chosen from the University by the
administration, the employee, and the
personnel office.

see out the current grievance hearings
