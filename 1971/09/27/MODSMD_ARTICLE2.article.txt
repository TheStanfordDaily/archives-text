# Personnel Head Quits
## 
### SCOTT THACHER 
Robert M. Nelson, Stanford's
director of personnel, who often bore
the brunt of dissatisfaction with
employee firings and lay-offs during
the past year, has resigned.
The decision, announced last
Wednesday, was described as
voluntary. Nelson, 46, says he has "no
immediate plans for the future."
So far no one has been chosen to fill
Nelson's post when he actually leaves
on October 15. He was originally hired
in December 1969 to a newly created
position responsible for all personnel
activities as well as employee
relationships throughout the
University.
No specific reasons have been given
for the resignation, although Nelson
commented that "events have moved
quickly" in recent days.
Administrators both above and
below Nelson who were available for
comment, either were unwilling to
speculate on the reasons or frankly
stated they had no knowledge of the
circumstances.
Bombing
A pipe bomb exploded outside of
Nelson's home last July 12, nearly
injuring his 18-year-old daughter. A
$ 10,000 reward offered by the
University has failed to produce any
arrests.
Earlier, five workers had been fired
by Nelson for their participation in the

April 9 sit-in at the Stanford Hospital.
Nelson was then the object of several
peaceful demonstrations outside his
Encina office.
During the rest of the summer
Nelson took part in grievance hearings
for the fired workers. Recently he
described the grievance procedures as
"a less than satisfactory means of
resolving complaints and problems
presented by employees."
Independent Arbiter
He recommends the use of an
"independent and experienced arbiter"
rather than the three-man committees
