# Frosh Prereg Reduced
## 
### SCOTT THACHER 
The Class of 1 975 which arrived at Stanford
last Friday, has gone through one of the briefest
and also least politically oriented preregistrations
of recent years.
The welcoming period was cut to three days
last year and further shortened this year by
Saturday's football game. Freshmen had just
enough time to settle in their room, meet their
faculty advisors, grind through placement tests, see
a few movies and enjoy a street dance.
But tonight Assemblyman Willie Brown, of San
Francisco, a black, and an outspoken member of
the California Legislature, will speak on "Justice in
America" in Memorial Church at 7 :30.
Missing this year was a formal convocation for
the whole freshmen class and an address by the
president of the university.
Instead President Richard Lyman and a
member of the ASSU Council of Presidents, Diane
Fields, each gave a few words of welcome
yesterday at a Sunday service in Memorial Church.
Political Paths
Speaking to about 800 of the 1 4 50 newcomers,
Fields told them, "I am not going to lead you
down any political path."
She simply asked them, "During your four or
so years here, please think. Don't take anything
for granted unless you ask question after question
after question."
Fields, a black, and a member of a council of
presidents that often has been described as radical,
stated as she began her talk, "There are a lot of
people who are hesitant about my speaking here

today," conceding that they expected her to talk
politics.
She added afterwards that the pre-reg
committee had had long discussions on how to
keep the service as non-political as possible.
President Lyman took a similar attitude of
restraint in describing what Stanford should be or
do for the freshmen. "Welcome to the Stanford
that you will create in large part for yourself," he
told them.
Colloquy Groups Dropped
Also dropped from the orientation program this
year were the colloquy groups organized for
freshmen with upperclass leaders. The purpose was
to allow the freshman to get to know each other,
and discuss the kind of educational experience
they could expect to find here.
Pre-reg chairman Micheal Fanucehi explained
there was not enough time for this, and interest
had seemed to lag in previous years.
Pre-registration activities also required more
than the usual contribution from the Dean of
Students Office, which totalled $64 00 this year.
The increase was needed since the fee for the
student government for this year was nothing,
"zero dollars," as voted on by the student body
last spring. The only student contribution was
$700 the committee had saved from last year.
Also, this summer the ASSU Senate decided
that the Dean of Students Office had acted
unfairly in appointing Fanucchi chairman without
their approval. They confirmed Mike Dawson as
their choice, although Fanucchi continued to carry
most of the job's responsibilities.
