# Media Don't Print Ecology Facts

### 
The mass media, while
successfully drawing the broad
outlines of environmental
problems in the United States,
have continually failed to provide
the specific, hard-hitting
information the public needs to
do something about these
problems.
This is the conclusion of a
14-month study into mass media
coverage of environmental
problems conducted by a team of
36 Stanford students and
supported by a precedent-setting
National Science Foundation
grant of $53,600.
The NSF grant was the first
ever awarded to a project
instituted and directed by
graduate students.
The principal investigators-
David M. Rubin, who recently
obtained his Ph.D. from the
Department of Communication,
and David P. Sachs, a fifth-year
student at the School of
Medicine—disclosed their findings
today at a conference on mass
media and the environment at
Stanford.

The day-long conference was
attended by national and Bay
Area reporters, editors and other
media personnel responsible for
environmental news.
Three Volumes Published
The project resulted in three
published volumes, including
Rubin's discussion of media
coverage in the San Francisco area
and nationally (Volume II), Sachs'
description of the Bay Area water
system and analysis of the
California Water Plan (Volume I),
and an annotated bibliography of
information sources on
environmental subjects (Volume
III).
Though he feels the media have
succeeded in awakening the public
consciousness to environmental
problems, Rubin emphasizes that
there is still much room for
improvement.
"Generally, the media as a
whole and the media in the Bay
Area have devoted more time and
space to the subject dramatically
since mid-1969," Rubin says.
"There is an increased
awareness-they're pulling men

off other beats and assigning them
environmental stories.
"But they're not hiring people
as environmental reporters, which
would really indicate they give a
damn. If you have no reporter
assigned to cover environmental
problems, newsroom inertia takes
over and only the red hot issue
will get covered."
Rubin makes seven suggestions
for improved media coverage in
his volume. He urges media
executives not only to hire
environmental reporters, but to
consider establishing
environmental news pages and
continuing broadcast features.
'Close to Home'
Perhaps the most pressing
need, as he sees it, is for the media
to begin dealing with problems
close to home and presenting
specific findings the public can
use.
"On occasion, when there is a
local disaster, like the Bay oil
spill, they do a good job," he says.
"But if they're given a chance to
name a company which has a
record of violating anti-pollution
standards, or to point the finger at
a public official who has a poor
voting record on environmental
issues, they don't do it.
"In other words, if they have a
chance to provide the public with
specific information, they cop

out."
Rubin feels advertising
acceptance departments should
reject misleading ads which claims
a product or service will improve
the quality of the environment.
"What we're really talking
about are ads like Chevron
F-310," he says. "We object to
ads like this on two grounds: first,
it's basically fraudulent. It does
no more than any detergent
gasoline. Second, it creates in
thypublic consciousness the belief
that industry is doing something
to solve the problem. Basically,
they're just after favorable
publicity to take the pressure
off."
Many private industries would
stop polluting, Rubin believes, if
the press would extend the
"adversary" relationship from
government to business.
Sachs' interest in
environmental problems was
sparked in the eighth grade, when
he built a working model of a
water reclamation plant while
studying how to eliminate water
pollution. He later won a national
first prize in a Future Scientists of
America contest.
His writing and research led to
a 1968 article in McCall's listing
102 cities whose water supplies
did not meet federal standards.
According to U.S. Public Health
Service officials, that article was
dirertly responsible for initiating
improvement in the water supply
systems in most of those cities.
Rubin, who will teach
journalism at New York
University this fall, did a
follow-up article for Columbia
Journalism Review on how the
media in those 102 cities handled
the water story as revealed in
McCall's.
Faculty sponsors for the
Rubin-Sachs study were Nobel
Laureate Dr. Joshua Lederberg,
chairman of the Department of
Genetics, and William L. Rivers,
professor of communication.
Rubin and Rivers recently
co-authored a book on the
newspapers of the San Francisco
Bay Area.

they're just after favorable
publicity to take the pressure
off."
Many private industries would
stop polluting, Rubin believes, if
the press would extend the
"adversary" relationship from
government to business.
Sachs' interest in
environmental problems was
sparked in the eighth grade, when
he built a working model of a
water reclamation plant while
studying how to eliminate water
pollution. He later won a national
first prize in a Future Scientists of
America contest.
His writing and research led to
a 1968 article in McCall's listing
102 cities whose water supplies
did not meet federal standards.
According to U.S. Public Health
Service officials, that article was
dirertly responsible for initiating
improvement in the water supply
systems in most of those cities.
Rubin, who will teach
journalism at New York
University this fall, did a
follow-up article for Columbia
Journalism Review on how the
media in those 102 cities handled
the water story as revealed in
McCall's.
Faculty sponsors for the
Rubin-Sachs study were Nobel
Laureate Dr. Joshua Lederberg,
chairman of the Department of
Genetics, and William L. Rivers,
professor of communication.
Rubin and Rivers recently
co-authored a book on the
newspapers of the San Francisco
Bay Area.
The mass media, while
successfully drawing the broad
outlines of environmental
problems in the United States,
have continually failed to provide
the specific, hard-hitting
information the public needs to
do something about these
problems.
This is the conclusion of a
14-month study into mass media
coverage of environmental
problems conducted by a team of
36 Stanford students and
supported by a precedent-setting
National Science Foundation
grant of $53,600.
The NSF grant was the first
ever awarded to a project
instituted and directed by
graduate students.
The principal investigators-
David M. Rubin, who recently
obtained his Ph.D. from the
Department of Communication,
and David P. Sachs, a fifth-year
student at the School of
Medicine—disclosed their findings
today at a conference on mass
media and the environment at
Stanford.

The day-long conference was
attended by national and Bay
Area reporters, editors and other
media personnel responsible for
environmental news.
Three Volumes Published
The project resulted in three
published volumes, including
Rubin's discussion of media
coverage in the San Francisco area
and nationally (Volume II), Sachs'
description of the Bay Area water
system and analysis of the
California Water Plan (Volume I),
and an annotated bibliography of
information sources on
environmental subjects (Volume
III).
Though he feels the media have
succeeded in awakening the public
consciousness to environmental
problems, Rubin emphasizes that
there is still much room for
improvement.
"Generally, the media as a
whole and the media in the Bay
Area have devoted more time and
space to the subject dramatically
since mid-1969," Rubin says.
"There is an increased
awareness-they're pulling men

off other beats and assigning them
environmental stories.
"But they're not hiring people
as environmental reporters, which
would really indicate they give a
damn. If you have no reporter
assigned to cover environmental
problems, newsroom inertia takes
over and only the red hot issue
will get covered."
Rubin makes seven suggestions
for improved media coverage in
his volume. He urges media
executives not only to hire
environmental reporters, but to
consider establishing
environmental news pages and
continuing broadcast features.
'Close to Home'
Perhaps the most pressing
need, as he sees it, is for the media
to begin dealing with problems
close to home and presenting
specific findings the public can
use.
"On occasion, when there is a
local disaster, like the Bay oil
spill, they do a good job," he says.
"But if they're given a chance to
name a company which has a
record of violating anti-pollution
standards, or to point the finger at
a public official who has a poor
voting record on environmental
issues, they don't do it.
"In other words, if they have a
chance to provide the public with
specific information, they cop

out."
Rubin feels advertising
acceptance departments should
reject misleading ads which claims
a product or service will improve
the quality of the environment.
"What we're really talking
about are ads like Chevron
F-310," he says. "We object to
ads like this on two grounds: first,
it's basically fraudulent. It does
no more than any detergent
gasoline. Second, it creates in
thypublic consciousness the belief
that industry is doing something
to solve the problem. Basically,
they're just after favorable
publicity to take the pressure
off."
