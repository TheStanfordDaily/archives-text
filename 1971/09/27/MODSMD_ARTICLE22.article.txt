# Daily Cal Goes Independent; Severs University Controls
## 
### SCOTT THACHER 
The Daily Californian,
Berkeley's student newspaper,
which had considered publishing
independently of the university
for a long time, broke loose last
spring following the furor over a
front-page editorial urging readers
to retake the "People's Park."
The "People's Park," an
unused piece of university
property, had been the center of
violence when police had
attempted to force students and
their sympathizers off the
contested territory two years
earlier.
Editors of the paper, speaking
in their newly rented offices two
blocks off campus, are quite
happy with the decision to
publish without the help as well as
the direct control of the
university.
They surmise that the
university administration is
equally delighted to have them off
its hands.

It is by no means true that the
Daily Cal has broken all its ties
with its former host. Two facts
are important; the university very
likely will pay the paper a Hat
sum of $20,000 for 2500 staff
subscriptions; and the new
by-laws of the paper limit the
number of non-student staff to
one-quarter of the total, assuring
that the paper will not suddenly
be run by outsiders.
But the editors see themselves
as avoiding the quite onerous
control which they saw exercised
by the university last spring.
Troubles Flare Up
A few days after the Daily
Cai's editorial, skirmishes flared
up at the park on the second
anniversary of the original
trouble, and its fence was partly
torn down.
The Publications Board of the
university threatened to keep the
paper off the presses unless three
of its five person editorial board
resigned.
A majority of the staff voted
to reinstate the three editors
before a compromise was reached,
and new editors were elected to
complete the few issues which
remained that spring.
According to editor Toni

Martin, the paper's staff then
decided it had to establish its
independence from the university
"right away," rather than in two
years as was the original plan,
conceived before the conflict over
the editorial took place.
The prime disadvantage
involved giving up rent-free offices
and free accounting services at the
Berkeley student union.
Now A Corporation
But since the paper has now
formed itself into a corporation, a
board of directors chosen by the
paper will oversee its operations,
rather than the Publications Board
which reported directly to the
chancellor of the university.
Editor Martin feels from the
paper's point of view that "you
just become a better newspaper,"
given this independence. In her
opinion, the best college
newspapers in the country have
similar ties with their parent
institutions.
Financially the paper will
continue to survive almost
entirely on its advertising
revenues. Last year's paper was
able for the first time to make a
profit without dipping into a
subsidy which the university was
willing to give it each year.

independent.
