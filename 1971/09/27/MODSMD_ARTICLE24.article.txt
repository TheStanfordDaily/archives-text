# Freshman Class Weirder Than Last? Or Is It Just The 'Daily' Reporter
## 
### JON DEDMON 
My name is John Dedmon.
Posing as a reporter for the Daily,
I went into Cedro Saturday night
to find out what freshmen were
thinking. It turned out that they
weren't. Instead they were getting
drunk on some Red Mountain
wine, as I was trying to write this
article.
Hopefully this interview would
have provided a unique insight
into the freshman class, but
unfortunately it merely confirmed
what you've probably guessed all
along about this year's freshman
classâ€”they're horny and weird.
Scene: Five guys and a girl
sitting around in a circle getting
drunk (except for the girl. Good
old Stanford!).
Reporter: Hi there! I'm a
reporter for the Stanford Daily.
Say, does
Northwestern get the Daily"?
Reporter: Yeah.
Herman: I'd like to say hello to
my cousin Rodger.
Irving: Hi Chuck Redman at
Michigan.
Harvey: Hi to Marguerite in
Tijuana.
Reporter: Hey wait a minute.
What's your opinion of Stanford
so far? (Note the carefully
phrased probing question.)
Harvey: If it's not a morals
charge in Tijuana it's not worth
trying.
Irving: I thought I'd just gotten
in here by the skin of my teeth, so
I was really worried when I cam
here figuring there were going to

be all these intellects. (Note the
way our reporter has quickly
delved into the deep psychological
apprehension confronting
freshmen.) But I haven't met an
intellect yet, just football players
and dopers.
Leo from Oakland: Say, is this
school for real?
Reporter: Well what made you
guys decide to come to Stanford?
Herman: I'm from Nebraska
and had never seen the Golden
Gate Bridge.
Irving: I'd heard a lot about

ZAP comics and there aren't
many in Las Vegas.
Harvey: It's the biggest waste
of money on the.West Coast.
Reporter: I suppose the next
question that immediately comes
to mind is how did you guys get
into Stanford?
Herman: (he is about 5'2" and
weighs about 120) I was an
all-state guard.
Irving: I got a 1556 on my
college boards.
Reporter: That's really
fantastic.

Irving: Yeah, but I knew this
one chick who got an 800 on her
math, but got turned down here
because she got knocked up just
before her interview.
Herman: Say, did you know
that Leland Stanford Jr. died of
syphilis in Paris?
Reporter: That's not true. He
died in Florence.
Herman: Yeah, that was the
name of the whore in Paris.
Leo from Oakland: Hey,
instead of writing about us why
don't you write an autobiography
of Jerrv Coleman.
