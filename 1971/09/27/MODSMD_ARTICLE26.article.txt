# Alumni Donations Decline; Big Drop From Foundations
## 
### 
Gifts to the University dropped
about $1 million this year from
last, although the amount is well
over the average amount it has
received during the five preceding
years.
$29,223,850 was received
during the 1970-71 fiscal year
from 22,457 donors, according to
Board of Trustees President
Robert Minge Brown.
This total compares with $30.3
million in 1969-70, $29.5 million
in 1968-69, and $29.7 million in
1967-68. The drop this last year
was mainly because of a
substantial decline in gifts from

large foundations.
The amount donated for the
fiscal year ending August 31,
came from 22,457 donors, the
largest number of donors in a
single year in University history.
Gifts Increase
Gifts from living individuals
increased from $5.6 million to
$6.3 million. There were increases
in both large and small gifts
although for the second
consecutive year Stanford did not
receive a gift of $1 million or
above from a living individual.
Receipts from bequests totaled
$13.5 million and accounted for
45 percent of the total received

from all gift sources. This
represents an increase of nearly
$1.5 million over the previous
year in this category.
Business corporations
contributed $2.8 million, slightly
less than the year before, though
more corporations (537) made
gifts.
John Young, national chairman
of the Stanford Annual Fund—an
organization through which
alumni make annual gifts to the
University—told a gathering of the
fund raisers last Friday that
during 1970-71 the Fund had its
best year ever, receiving
$2,512,663 from 24,433 gifts.
