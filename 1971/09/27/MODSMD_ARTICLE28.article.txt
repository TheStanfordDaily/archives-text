# Bunce Leads Stanford To 38-17 Win Over Oregon
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Led by quarterback Don
Bunce's three touchdown passes
and one touchdown run, Stanford
successfully began the Rose Bowl
race on Saturday with a 38-17 win
over visiting Oregon. In their
home and conference debut, the
Indians used the big play a
number of times to win what was
statistically, a much closer game.
Oregon was able to score the
first touchdown of the season
against a strong Stanford defense,
but they received a major loss
midway through the second
quarter, when quarterback Dan
Fouts strained his knee. Fouts
finished out the half and his last
of 11 completions was good for a
five yard touchdown to Greg
Specht, but his absence in the
second half made a major
difference in the game.
In the first half, both Oregon
and Stanford were stalled on their
first drives. Then midway through
the first quarter, Stanford began a
long drive from their own 18 with
back-to-back flanker reverses by
John Winesberry for 18 and 14
yards. Offensive-player-of-the
game Bunce said that the game
plan called for running the end
around twice if the first one
worked. Both worked.
After reaching midfield, the
Indians seemed intent on
establishing a running game and
they moved as far as the Oregon 3
before being stopped. After a
delay of game penalty, Rod
Garcia kicked a 25 yard field goal
to give Stanford a 3-0 lead.
Then early in the second

period, the Cards went 78 yards in
10 plays, with Bunce running it in
from the five. On the second play
of their next series, Bunce hit split
end Miles Moore on a 78 yard
play-action pass for another
six-pointer.
Oregon Scores
Despite being injured during
the next series, Fouts stayed in
the game and finished up a 68
yard touchdown drive with the
pass to Specht. Oregon could go
into the locker room having cut
the lead to 17-7, but having lost
Fouts.
Early in the third quarter,
Duck cornerback Bill Drake
intercepted a Bunce pass intended
for Winesberry and ran it in for a
28 yard touchdown. When Garcia
missed a 24 yard field goal
attempt, Oregon took over on
their 20 with a good chance to go
ahead.
But Tim Robnett intercepted
the first pass thrown by Fouts'
replacement, Harvey Winn, and
the Indians took over on Oregon's
30. Seven plays later, Jackie
Brown scored from 2 yards out
and Stanford increased their lead
to 24-14. On the first play after an
22 yard Oregon punt, Stanford's
line picked up an Oregon blitz,
allowing Bunce to hit Moore again
for a 41 yard score.
In the final quarter after a 39
yard Oregon field goal,
Winesberry faked a post pattern,
ran a beautiful out pattern and
Bunce hit him for a final 26 yard
touchdown. Garcia added his fifth
PAT and the final score was set at
38-17.

Big Loss
After the game, Oregon coach
Jerry Frei heavily praised
Stanford, but said "I like to think
we're close to Stanford with
Fouts in there." And the loss of
Fouts really did hurt the Ducks.
Winn did a decent job, but he is no
Fouts. And with Fouts out, the
Stanford defense was able to key
even more on highly-touted
tailback Bobby Moore.
Moore was still able to gain
150 yards in 29 carries, but he
never broke one. Stanford's
defensive line contained him well
and after the game he praised that
defense and tackle Pete Lazetich
and linebackers Jeff Siemon and
Mike Simone in particular. "I'd
say that Stanford has a pretty
good defense. No, make that a
very good defense."
When asked to compare
Stanford's overall team with the
top-ranked Nebraska team which
beat Oregon 34-7 two weeks ago,
Moore said, "No comparison.
Nebraska's the best football team
I've played against in my college
career."
The Indians' defensive line had
kept Fouts under fairly heavy
pressure in the first half, making
the secondary's job easier. But he
still hit on 11 of 18 passes and
with three second stringers,
Dennis Bragonier, Jim Ferguson
and Max Goldstein, all injured, he
might have caused considerable
problems in the second half for a
defensive backfield which would
have gotten little relief.
More Injuries
Goldstein, with an injured knee
and fullback Hillary Shockley,
with a sprained ankle, were
Stanford's only major injuries
yesterday.
Even with Shockley getting
hurt after only seven carries, the
Stanford running game was better
than in their previous wins over
Missouri and Army. Head coach
John Ralston said that the offense
showed better balance and that
"our running game is coming up."
But it was the big plays which

won the game and which Ralston
was happiest about. "I was happy
with the big play we were able to
make. The overall output was very
good. Don Bunce's play all the
way around was exceptional."
Exceptional is a pretty good
adjective for a quarterback who
completed 12 of 24 passes for 262
yards and 3 touchdowns and who
ran 12 times for 33 yards and
another touchdown. Frei was
quite impressed with the senior
successor to Heisman Trophy
winner Jim Plunkett.
4 I wasn't misquoted before
when I said Bunce is as good as
Plunkett was," said Frei. "After
this game I still believe. Could I
believe anything else?"
"Those three touchdown
passes Bunce threw just might be
the three best-looking passes I've
ever seen in my life.. . full-tilt,
arm's length, finger-tip, the whole
bit. It was masterful execution."
Highly complimentary
adjectives were also being used to
describe Miles Moore who caught
two of those passes. He caught 4
passes for 152 yards, which gives
him season totals of 11 catches
for 352 yards and 3 touchdowns.
A 32 yard per catch average isn't
too bad for a former defensive
back.
After the game, Moore, who
was sidelined last season with a
neck injury, reflected on the
change to receiver. "I was kind of
a sleeper in the spring. When the
coaches moved me to split end,
they didn't know if I could help
fill the vacancies there."
"And I must confess that I
didn't know if I could do the job
either. I had to depend on my
ability as an athlete to make the
transition. And now every game I
feel more confident in my ability
as a receiver."
This Saturday undefeated
Duke (3-0) comes to Stanford
Stadium. The Blue Devils shut out
Virginia 28-0 on Saturday and
Ralston said that the Indians
weren't goint to look by them to
Washington and USC. "We play
one team at a time.


ON THE MOVE Don Bunce flees the pocket under pressure from Oregon's left end Keith Davis. Evading
enough enemy tacklers to run for 33 yards in 12 carries, Bunce also sprinted five yards for the Indian's
first touchdown. Bunce threw touchdown passes of 26, 41, and 7 8 yards and amassed 262 yards in the air
for the afternoon, connecting on 12 of 24 attempts.
