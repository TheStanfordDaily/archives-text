# Tuition, Room And Board Don't Feel The Freeze
## 
### PHIL REVZIN 
Tuition charges and room and board
rates for most university housing are
exempt from the President's freeze on
wages and prices, according to rulings
of the Cost of Living Council (CLC).
Previously announced tuition rates
of $870 per quarter, and rates for all
university housing rented by quarter
will remain in effect. Escondido village
apartments which rent on a monthly
basis are covered by the freeze, and
rents must remain at the 1970-1971
level.
Most salary increases for faculty and
staff, which had been scheduled to go
into effect September 1 are being
deferred. Those increases, such as bona
fide promotions, increases to correct
inequities based on sex, and increases
for individuals completing special
educational and training programs
which lead to a higher level of
responsibility will be paid as allowed
under CLC rulings.
Money which had been budgeted for
salary increases which are now frozen
will remain in department salary
accounts, and will not be used for any
other purpose, at least until November
15, when Phase 1 of the new economic
program ends, and clarification has
been received regarding the nature of
phase 11.
Cilley Appointed
In a statement issued August 19,
President Lyman said "it is Stanford's
intention to disadvantage no one
individually beyond what is required to
live within the order." Lyman
appointed Earl Cilley, assistant
vice-president for research, to
coordinate university policy regarding
the freeze. Mr. Cilley's office is
handling all questions arising out of
the executive order.
Robert R. Augsberger, newly
appointed vice-president for business
and finance, told incoming students
and their parents, in a letter dated
September 17, that "In order to guard
against any financial hardship which
may result (because of the freeze)
President Lyman has asked the Director
of Financial Aids to respond to the
needs of students who may be caught
in the squeeze."
Cilley said that the university would
do all that it could within the law to
insure even-handed treatment of those
affected. In a statement dated August
27 he said, "At this time it is far from
clear whether we will be allowed to
adjust salaries and wages after the
freeze to reflect the planned
increases. . .or whether-or to what
evtentâ€”they can be paid retroactively.
Thus we have no way of forecasting
whether there v/ill in fact be any
'savings,' much less their magnitude."
Action Unclear
Cilley added that he was "hesitant
to predict what would happen because
the governmental agencies themselves
for the most part do not know what

will happen after this initial 90 day
freeze."
The University has cleared all of its
policy decisions with the Office of
Emergency Preparedness(OEP), which
is handling questions and complaints
of violations regarding the freeze.
The OEP ruling in regard to tuition
and room and board stated "increases
in school tuition and room and board
have been treated as completed
transactions, and thus exempt from the
freeze, if payments of any form were
received from students after
announcement of increased rates.
Where increases in rates were
announced prior to August 15, and
payments were received prior to August
15, but after the increases had been
announced, the increase may remain in
effect for the school year. The
substantial transaction test may be met
by one deposit or payment if it
represented at least 10 per cent of
transactions made during the period."
Increases Needed
Cilley stressed, in a Daily interview,
that it was essential that the rate
increases go into effect so that the
University pjnoo meet commitments
based on budgeting which occurred
months ago. The tuition and room and
board hikes were announced last
October, and this year's budget which
was based on these higher rates, was
approved by the Board of Trustees in

January. Cilley pointed out that the
University's money crisis was severe,
and that the Budget Adjustment
Program, (BAP) which aims at erasing
the budget deficit by 1975, depended
on the scheduled increases.
Cilley said that he estimated that of
the approximately 7000 university
employees, a "small number" would
receive pay increases under the CLC
guidelines.
The United Stanford Employees
(USE) have expressed displeasure over
the freeze, and indicated that they
would seek an exemption. According to
USE member Julia Harvey, the group is
asking the OEP to exempt Stanford
workers because of the new wage scale
based on a new classification system for
workers. The new system of job
classification was aimed at adjusting
wages to more equitable levels,
according to Harvey, and as such does
not represent wage increases. She said
that the USE had written to the OEP
concerning these issues, but as yet had
not received an answer.
Harvey said that the USE was most
concerned about the fact that workers
were not consulted about University
policy regarding the freeze. She said
that at one point representatives of the
USE had requested a meeting with
Cilley, but that arrangements for such a
meeting became tangled, and it was
never held.
