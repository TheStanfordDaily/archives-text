The complete text of the
October 5 LOOK Magazine article
by former Stanford football
player Tim McClure is reprinted
on page 15 of today's Daily. The
story, released last Monday
afternoon, immediately created
considerable controversy among
Stanford players, coaches, athletic
department employees, the local
press and the local community.
Claims of fabrication,
distortion and journalistic
irresponsibility were leveled
against LOOK, which is going out
of business following its October
19 issue. Some players agreed
with most of what the article said,
others denied its claims. Everyone
had something to say.
Finally in a number of last
Tuesday's newspapers, McClure
emerged to make some statements
about the article. According to
one paper he said, "Firmly
clinging to their primary purpose
of selling magazines, they (LOOK)

successfully sucked all the
subtlety from and totally
rearranged the content of my
article.
"Through this process they
invalidated any possibility of
communicating a constructive
criticism. The original degenerated
into a negative statement of
bitterness and frustration .. .
(But) if 1 decided to cancel
publication, I would be
inadvertently condoning the
present conditions."
Charges and countercharges
continued throughout the rest of
the week. Last night, in an
exclusive interview, the Daily
tried to clear up some questions
about the article.
How would you answer the
charges that n.uch of the article
was fallacious? Every incident in
the article is factual. But LOOK
just skimmed the events off the
top. They decided to keep my
manuscript because it was written
by a former Stanford football
player. They took the skeletal
outline and filled it out wherever
they wanted.
Why did you write the original
article? The original reason why I
wrote the football article was
because I felt that people should
have an alternative viewpoint
presented to them about the
football program, because all you
ever hear about is from the
athletic department—obviously a
biased account... 1 just felt it
was important that everyone
found out what a lot of guys on
the football team have to say.
How did you actually get into
writing it? There is a large
contingent of players on the team
that felt the way I did. I like
literature and the thought struck
me that I might want to do some

writing. And I turned to the most
intimate, intense experience that
I'd ever had which would be of
interest to people, and that was
football. I thought this would be a
perfect situation for me to write
about. I finished the original
fifteen page manuscript sometime
around April.
What was the chronology of your
relationship with LOOK? After
having submitted the article to
LOOK, I met Jared Lebow in the
Mark Hopkins Hotel in San
Francisco. He said that we would
have to change the article around
quite a bit. Something about it
being too mythological. I don't
know the implications of that. I
guess maybe it was too intricate
or something like that. He taped a
conversation with me and asked
me a lot about drugs, because as 1
was to find out later, this was to
be the major thrust of the article.
The selling point. The headlines
and all that. So he just tape
recorded this thing and split. And
I didn't hear from him for three
months. Then 1 called him and
asked him if this thing was going
to happen. And he said, yeah,
yeah, 1 got a couple of other
stories to do. On and on until two
weeks before publication date,
when he sends me this abortion.
He asks me if it's cool to print
this. First of all, I wrote just a
venemous letter to them saying
that he totally missed the point,
that it was totally negativistic and
totally detrimental to everybody
concerned and that it was poor
writing. 1 didn't have the guts to

send the letter because right when
I was going to mail it, he called
me up and I just recited it to him
over the phone verbally and he
says, well what do you want to do
about it, 1 can't change it. Then I
had to decide whether I should let
this poorly-written, negative thing
actually happen. And 1 decided
that people really never did hear
about the more sordid aspects of
football and that there was really
no way they could because no one
had means of communicating
through the mass media like I did
at that time. So I just had to
decide whether I would present
this totally polarized, sensational
version or not. If I cancelled
publication, no one would've
heard about what was wrong with
football and everyone would've
gone along pretty blissfully
ignorant of what football was
really about. So that was how I
made my decision. I knew I was
making a concession, a personal
concession if nothing else.
After the LOOK story appeared
didn't you say that your intention
was to criticize football and
society as a whole more than just
Stanford and Ralston? Obviously,
my intent was not just an
indictment of Stanford. The point
is that football itself is mistaken
because it's become just unwieldy.
It's just become too big. Because
there are too many alumni,
administrators and fans, and the
pressure is put on the coach
because of a huge spectacle in
front of 60,0 00 people—people
just go there to have a good time.

And the coach has to produce a
winner and in order to do that he
has to make a lot of concessions
in his relations with the players.
How would you look back on
your own experiences with
Ralston and Stanford football as
weighed aginst what you possibly
would've gone through elsewhere?
Well I've heard a lot of horror
stories about other schools and 1
guess on the spectrum of football
coaches and their leniency
spectrum, so to speak, I would say
Raiston's pretty lenient. But
that's in a given environment, a
given circumstance. On a wider
spectrum, sort of everyday life,
he's totally restrictive. It's really
not that important that Raiston's
a nice football coach, if you know
what I mean. Because football
demands so much, that no matter
where you are, you're going to get
screwed.
At a Football Writer's luncheon
on Tuesday, Stanford Sports
Information Director Bob Murphy
claimed that a number of points
in the LOOK article were
completely erroneous. Would you
comment on the following
statements in the article which he
claimed were untrue. Murphy said
that you did not receive "room,
board, a little spending money"
as the article says. I just received
tuition. Murphy also says that the
trip to Las Vegas following the
Arkansas game was his idea and
not a player's demand. I just
know that there were several
demands. And incredibly trivial
things. Like during two-a-day
practices having clean jocks and
having the athletic department
reimburse us for our traveling
jackets. We wanted to stop
somewhere after the game, but it's
possible that Vegas was Murphy's
suggestion.
In your original manuscript wasn't

there quite a bit written about
Murphy which LOOK left out of
their article? That's true because
that was one of my main
concerns. Definitely the main
concern I had for writing the
article was the psychological
indoctrination. And he is the chief
proponent and instigator of that
propaganda ... We go to a dinner
and he gets up and he goes
through this comical routine
thing, you know, you've heard
him, afid he just bandies the
players' names around as if they
were some kind of toy or machine
or something—something playful
for all the alumni to get some
kind of vicarious athletic thrill
from. And I went through the
press book he hands out and I
selected salient passages from each
player and put them up on a
board and they were incredibly
similar. .. Like there were four
categories—intelligent student of
the game; smart player; loves to
hit ... I just sort of laid it down
and put it in context and laid it
on the table. And just got a real
straight shot of what he was
doing. That's just a manifestation
of the state of football because
that's demanded of
everybody—the simplistic sort of
one-dimensional portrait of what
football players are like. You
know it's all tied in and you can't
extract one part and do away with
it and still maintain the program
the way it exists. Because it's
impossible.
What do you see as the future
hope for improving football?
What changes can be made to
make football into a more positive
thing? You can't isolate one
factor in a football program. You
really can't isolate one factor in
society. This is a very complicated
question. It gets to the whole
Protestant-Western ethic thing.
This competitive thing. And
football is a crystalization of
society—of the drives in society. A
lot of football players—as a lot of
young people—are going through a

sort of metamorphisis, and sort of
replacing this hyper-competitive
thing with sort of a more mellow
approach. Not this dog-eat-dog
type thing. Football is a very
explainable phenomenon in
capitalistic society because of this
competition. People can go on
Saturday and see everyone
fighting on the field, which is
what they experience in a
somewhat more diluted, more
subtle form five days a week at
the job. So 1 really think it's going
to be a pretty tough job to change
football in the society the way it
is right now. Definitely.
How many players on the team
would you say agree with what
you're saying? I don't know a lot
of the young guys . . . But I have a
lot of friends on the team. 1
would say 10 to 15 are solid. The
rest are sort of equivocal about it.
And there are some people who
are totally involved in the football
trip and these people don't agree
with what I have to say. It's
definitely not as if I was sort of a
bad egg or something like that.
Would you go through playing
football here all over again if you
had known what you know now
about Stanford football? No. No I
wouldn't. First of all, I couldn't.
Knowing what I know now, it
would be suicidal, if you know
what I mean. It would just be a
waste of time. A very poor
allocation of time.
What are your future plans? I
would like to write, but I don't
think anything I've done as of yet
is any indication as to whether I
can or not. I mean this thing is
kind of, well speaking in terms of
writing expertise, it's a joke.
Really, it's a joke.

And there are some people who
are totally involved in the football
trip and these people don't agree
with what I have to say. It's
definitely not as if I was sort of a
bad egg or something like that.
Would you go through playing
football here all over again if you
had known what you know now
about Stanford football? No. No I
wouldn't. First of all, I couldn't.
Knowing what I know now, it
would be suicidal, if you know
what I mean. It would just be a
waste of time. A very poor
allocation of time.
What are your future plans? I
would like to write, but I don't
think anything I've done as of yet
is any indication as to whether I
can or not. I mean this thing is
kind of, well speaking in terms of
writing expertise, it's a joke.
Really, it's a joke.

The complete text of the
October 5 LOOK Magazine article
by former Stanford football
player Tim McClure is reprinted
on page 15 of today's Daily. The
story, released last Monday
afternoon, immediately created
considerable controversy among
Stanford players, coaches, athletic
department employees, the local
press and the local community.
Claims of fabrication,
distortion and journalistic
irresponsibility were leveled
against LOOK, which is going out
of business following its October
19 issue. Some players agreed
with most of what the article said,
others denied its claims. Everyone
had something to say.
Finally in a number of last
Tuesday's newspapers, McClure
emerged to make some statements
about the article. According to
one paper he said, "Firmly
clinging to their primary purpose
of selling magazines, they (LOOK)

successfully sucked all the
subtlety from and totally
rearranged the content of my
article.
"Through this process they
invalidated any possibility of
communicating a constructive
criticism. The original degenerated
into a negative statement of
bitterness and frustration .. .
(But) if 1 decided to cancel
publication, I would be
inadvertently condoning the
present conditions."
Charges and countercharges
continued throughout the rest of
the week. Last night, in an
exclusive interview, the Daily
tried to clear up some questions
about the article.
How would you answer the
charges that n.uch of the article
was fallacious? Every incident in
the article is factual. But LOOK
just skimmed the events off the
top. They decided to keep my
manuscript because it was written
by a former Stanford football
player. They took the skeletal
outline and filled it out wherever
they wanted.
Why did you write the original
article? The original reason why I
wrote the football article was
because I felt that people should
have an alternative viewpoint
presented to them about the
football program, because all you
ever hear about is from the
athletic department—obviously a
biased account... 1 just felt it
was important that everyone
found out what a lot of guys on
the football team have to say.
How did you actually get into
writing it? There is a large
contingent of players on the team
that felt the way I did. I like
literature and the thought struck
me that I might want to do some

writing. And I turned to the most
intimate, intense experience that
I'd ever had which would be of
interest to people, and that was
football. I thought this would be a
perfect situation for me to write
about. I finished the original
fifteen page manuscript sometime
around April.
What was the chronology of your
relationship with LOOK? After
having submitted the article to
LOOK, I met Jared Lebow in the
Mark Hopkins Hotel in San
Francisco. He said that we would
have to change the article around
quite a bit. Something about it
being too mythological. I don't
know the implications of that. I
guess maybe it was too intricate
or something like that. He taped a
conversation with me and asked
me a lot about drugs, because as 1
was to find out later, this was to
be the major thrust of the article.
The selling point. The headlines
and all that. So he just tape
recorded this thing and split. And
I didn't hear from him for three
months. Then 1 called him and
asked him if this thing was going
to happen. And he said, yeah,
yeah, 1 got a couple of other
stories to do. On and on until two
weeks before publication date,
when he sends me this abortion.
He asks me if it's cool to print
this. First of all, I wrote just a
venemous letter to them saying
that he totally missed the point,
that it was totally negativistic and
totally detrimental to everybody
concerned and that it was poor
writing. 1 didn't have the guts to

send the letter because right when
I was going to mail it, he called
me up and I just recited it to him
over the phone verbally and he
says, well what do you want to do
about it, 1 can't change it. Then I
had to decide whether I should let
this poorly-written, negative thing
actually happen. And 1 decided
that people really never did hear
about the more sordid aspects of
football and that there was really
no way they could because no one
had means of communicating
through the mass media like I did
at that time. So I just had to
decide whether I would present
this totally polarized, sensational
version or not. If I cancelled
publication, no one would've
heard about what was wrong with
football and everyone would've
gone along pretty blissfully
ignorant of what football was
really about. So that was how I
made my decision. I knew I was
making a concession, a personal
concession if nothing else.
After the LOOK story appeared
didn't you say that your intention
was to criticize football and
society as a whole more than just
Stanford and Ralston? Obviously,
my intent was not just an
indictment of Stanford. The point
is that football itself is mistaken
because it's become just unwieldy.
It's just become too big. Because
there are too many alumni,
administrators and fans, and the
pressure is put on the coach
because of a huge spectacle in
front of 60,0 00 people—people
just go there to have a good time.

And the coach has to produce a
winner and in order to do that he
has to make a lot of concessions
in his relations with the players.
How would you look back on
your own experiences with
Ralston and Stanford football as
weighed aginst what you possibly
would've gone through elsewhere?
Well I've heard a lot of horror
stories about other schools and 1
guess on the spectrum of football
coaches and their leniency
spectrum, so to speak, I would say
Raiston's pretty lenient. But
that's in a given environment, a
given circumstance. On a wider
spectrum, sort of everyday life,
he's totally restrictive. It's really
not that important that Raiston's
a nice football coach, if you know
what I mean. Because football
demands so much, that no matter
where you are, you're going to get
screwed.
At a Football Writer's luncheon
on Tuesday, Stanford Sports
Information Director Bob Murphy
claimed that a number of points
in the LOOK article were
completely erroneous. Would you
comment on the following
statements in the article which he
claimed were untrue. Murphy said
that you did not receive "room,
board, a little spending money"
as the article says. I just received
tuition. Murphy also says that the
trip to Las Vegas following the
Arkansas game was his idea and
not a player's demand. I just
know that there were several
demands. And incredibly trivial
things. Like during two-a-day
practices having clean jocks and
having the athletic department
reimburse us for our traveling
jackets. We wanted to stop
somewhere after the game, but it's
possible that Vegas was Murphy's
suggestion.
In your original manuscript wasn't

there quite a bit written about
Murphy which LOOK left out of
their article? That's true because
that was one of my main
concerns. Definitely the main
concern I had for writing the
article was the psychological
indoctrination. And he is the chief
proponent and instigator of that
propaganda ... We go to a dinner
and he gets up and he goes
through this comical routine
thing, you know, you've heard
him, afid he just bandies the
players' names around as if they
were some kind of toy or machine
or something—something playful
for all the alumni to get some
kind of vicarious athletic thrill
from. And I went through the
press book he hands out and I
selected salient passages from each
player and put them up on a
board and they were incredibly
similar. .. Like there were four
categories—intelligent student of
the game; smart player; loves to
hit ... I just sort of laid it down
and put it in context and laid it
on the table. And just got a real
straight shot of what he was
doing. That's just a manifestation
of the state of football because
that's demanded of
everybody—the simplistic sort of
one-dimensional portrait of what
football players are like. You
know it's all tied in and you can't
extract one part and do away with
it and still maintain the program
the way it exists. Because it's
impossible.
What do you see as the future
hope for improving football?
What changes can be made to
make football into a more positive
thing? You can't isolate one
factor in a football program. You
really can't isolate one factor in
society. This is a very complicated
question. It gets to the whole
Protestant-Western ethic thing.
This competitive thing. And
football is a crystalization of
society—of the drives in society. A
lot of football players—as a lot of
young people—are going through a

sort of metamorphisis, and sort of
replacing this hyper-competitive
thing with sort of a more mellow
approach. Not this dog-eat-dog
type thing. Football is a very
explainable phenomenon in
capitalistic society because of this
competition. People can go on
Saturday and see everyone
fighting on the field, which is
what they experience in a
somewhat more diluted, more
subtle form five days a week at
the job. So 1 really think it's going
to be a pretty tough job to change
football in the society the way it
is right now. Definitely.
How many players on the team
would you say agree with what
you're saying? I don't know a lot
of the young guys . . . But I have a
lot of friends on the team. 1
would say 10 to 15 are solid. The
rest are sort of equivocal about it.
And there are some people who
are totally involved in the football
trip and these people don't agree
with what I have to say. It's

young people—are going through a

sort of metamorphisis, and sort of
replacing this hyper-competitive
thing with sort of a more mellow
approach. Not this dog-eat-dog
type thing. Football is a very
explainable phenomenon in
capitalistic society because of this
competition. People can go on
Saturday and see everyone
fighting on the field, which is
what they experience in a
somewhat more diluted, more
subtle form five days a week at
the job. So 1 really think it's going
to be a pretty tough job to change
football in the society the way it
is right now. Definitely.
How many players on the team
would you say agree with what
you're saying? I don't know a lot
of the young guys . . . But I have a
lot of friends on the team. 1
would say 10 to 15 are solid. The
rest are sort of equivocal about it.
And there are some people who
are totally involved in the football
trip and these people don't agree
with what I have to say. It's
definitely not as if I was sort of a
bad egg or something like that.
Would you go through playing
football here all over again if you
had known what you know now
about Stanford football? No. No I
wouldn't. First of all, I couldn't.
Knowing what I know now, it
would be suicidal, if you know
what I mean. It would just be a
waste of time. A very poor
allocation of time.
What are your future plans? I
would like to write, but I don't
think anything I've done as of yet
is any indication as to whether I
can or not. I mean this thing is
kind of, well speaking in terms of
writing expertise, it's a joke.
Really, it's a joke.

The complete text of the
October 5 LOOK Magazine article
by former Stanford football
player Tim McClure is reprinted
on page 15 of today's Daily. The
story, released last Monday
afternoon, immediately created
considerable controversy among
Stanford players, coaches, athletic
department employees, the local
press and the local community.
Claims of fabrication,
distortion and journalistic
irresponsibility were leveled
against LOOK, which is going out
of business following its October
19 issue. Some players agreed
with most of what the article said,
others denied its claims. Everyone
had something to say.
Finally in a number of last
Tuesday's newspapers, McClure
emerged to make some statements
about the article. According to
one paper he said, "Firmly
clinging to their primary purpose
of selling magazines, they (LOOK)

successfully sucked all the
subtlety from and totally
rearranged the content of my
article.
"Through this process they
invalidated any possibility of
communicating a constructive
criticism. The original degenerated
into a negative statement of
bitterness and frustration .. .
(But) if 1 decided to cancel
publication, I would be
inadvertently condoning the
present conditions."
Charges and countercharges
continued throughout the rest of
the week. Last night, in an
exclusive interview, the Daily
tried to clear up some questions
about the article.
How would you answer the
charges that n.uch of the article
was fallacious? Every incident in
the article is factual. But LOOK
just skimmed the events off the
top. They decided to keep my
manuscript because it was written
by a former Stanford football
player. They took the skeletal
outline and filled it out wherever
they wanted.
Why did you write the original
article? The original reason why I
wrote the football article was
because I felt that people should
have an alternative viewpoint
presented to them about the
football program, because all you
ever hear about is from the
athletic department—obviously a
biased account... 1 just felt it
was important that everyone
found out what a lot of guys on
the football team have to say.
How did you actually get into
writing it? There is a large
contingent of players on the team
that felt the way I did. I like
literature and the thought struck
me that I might want to do some

writing. And I turned to the most
intimate, intense experience that
I'd ever had which would be of
interest to people, and that was
football. I thought this would be a
perfect situation for me to write
about. I finished the original
fifteen page manuscript sometime
around April.
What was the chronology of your
relationship with LOOK? After
having submitted the article to
LOOK, I met Jared Lebow in the
Mark Hopkins Hotel in San
Francisco. He said that we would
have to change the article around
quite a bit. Something about it
being too mythological. I don't
know the implications of that. I
guess maybe it was too intricate
or something like that. He taped a
conversation with me and asked
me a lot about drugs, because as 1
was to find out later, this was to
be the major thrust of the article.
The selling point. The headlines
and all that. So he just tape
recorded this thing and split. And
I didn't hear from him for three
months. Then 1 called him and
asked him if this thing was going
to happen. And he said, yeah,
yeah, 1 got a couple of other
stories to do. On and on until two
weeks before publication date,
when he sends me this abortion.
He asks me if it's cool to print
this. First of all, I wrote just a
venemous letter to them saying
that he totally missed the point,
that it was totally negativistic and
totally detrimental to everybody
concerned and that it was poor
writing. 1 didn't have the guts to

send the letter because right when
I was going to mail it, he called
me up and I just recited it to him
over the phone verbally and he
says, well what do you want to do
about it, 1 can't change it. Then I
had to decide whether I should let
this poorly-written, negative thing
actually happen. And 1 decided
that people really never did hear
about the more sordid aspects of
football and that there was really
no way they could because no one
had means of communicating
through the mass media like I did
at that time. So I just had to
decide whether I would present
this totally polarized, sensational
version or not. If I cancelled
publication, no one would've
heard about what was wrong with
football and everyone would've
gone along pretty blissfully
ignorant of what football was
really about. So that was how I
made my decision. I knew I was
making a concession, a personal
concession if nothing else.
After the LOOK story appeared
didn't you say that your intention
was to criticize football and
society as a whole more than just
Stanford and Ralston? Obviously,
my intent was not just an
indictment of Stanford. The point
is that football itself is mistaken
because it's become just unwieldy.
It's just become too big. Because
there are too many alumni,
administrators and fans, and the
pressure is put on the coach
because of a huge spectacle in
front of 60,0 00 people—people
just go there to have a good time.

And the coach has to produce a
winner and in order to do that he
has to make a lot of concessions
in his relations with the players.
How would you look back on
your own experiences with
Ralston and Stanford football as
weighed aginst what you possibly
would've gone through elsewhere?
Well I've heard a lot of horror
stories about other schools and 1
guess on the spectrum of football
coaches and their leniency
spectrum, so to speak, I would say
Raiston's pretty lenient. But
that's in a given environment, a
given circumstance. On a wider
spectrum, sort of everyday life,
he's totally restrictive. It's really
not that important that Raiston's
a nice football coach, if you know
what I mean. Because football
demands so much, that no matter
where you are, you're going to get
screwed.
At a Football Writer's luncheon
on Tuesday, Stanford Sports
Information Director Bob Murphy
claimed that a number of points
in the LOOK article were
completely erroneous. Would you
comment on the following
statements in the article which he
claimed were untrue. Murphy said
that you did not receive "room,
board, a little spending money"
as the article says. I just received
tuition. Murphy also says that the
trip to Las Vegas following the
Arkansas game was his idea and
not a player's demand. I just
know that there were several
demands. And incredibly trivial
things. Like during two-a-day
practices having clean jocks and
having the athletic department
reimburse us for our traveling
jackets. We wanted to stop
somewhere after the game, but it's
possible that Vegas was Murphy's
suggestion.
In your original manuscript wasn't

there quite a bit written about
Murphy which LOOK left out of
their article? That's true because
that was one of my main
concerns. Definitely the main
concern I had for writing the
article was the psychological
indoctrination. And he is the chief
proponent and instigator of that
propaganda ... We go to a dinner
and he gets up and he goes
through this comical routine
thing, you know, you've heard
him, afid he just bandies the
players' names around as if they
were some kind of toy or machine
or something—something playful
for all the alumni to get some
kind of vicarious athletic thrill
from. And I went through the
press book he hands out and I
selected salient passages from each
player and put them up on a
board and they were incredibly
similar. .. Like there were four
categories—intelligent student of
the game; smart player; loves to
hit ... I just sort of laid it down
and put it in context and laid it
on the table. And just got a real
straight shot of what he was
doing. That's just a manifestation
of the state of football because
that's demanded of
everybody—the simplistic sort of
one-dimensional portrait of what
football players are like. You
know it's all tied in and you can't
extract one part and do away with
it and still maintain the program
the way it exists. Because it's
impossible.
What do you see as the future
hope for improving football?
What changes can be made to
make football into a more positive
thing? You can't isolate one
factor in a football program. You
really can't isolate one factor in
society. This is a very complicated
question. It gets to the whole
Protestant-Western ethic thing.
This competitive thing. And
football is a crystalization of
society—of the drives in society. A
lot of football players—as a lot of
young people—are going through a

sort of metamorphisis, and sort of
replacing this hyper-competitive
thing with sort of a more mellow
approach. Not this dog-eat-dog

on the table. And just got a real
straight shot of what he was
doing. That's just a manifestation
of the state of football because
that's demanded of
everybody—the simplistic sort of
one-dimensional portrait of what
football players are like. You
know it's all tied in and you can't
extract one part and do away with
it and still maintain the program
the way it exists. Because it's
impossible.
What do you see as the future
hope for improving football?
What changes can be made to
make football into a more positive
thing? You can't isolate one
factor in a football program. You
really can't isolate one factor in
society. This is a very complicated
question. It gets to the whole
Protestant-Western ethic thing.
This competitive thing. And
football is a crystalization of
society—of the drives in society. A
lot of football players—as a lot of
young people—are going through a

sort of metamorphisis, and sort of
replacing this hyper-competitive
thing with sort of a more mellow
approach. Not this dog-eat-dog
type thing. Football is a very
explainable phenomenon in
capitalistic society because of this
competition. People can go on
Saturday and see everyone
fighting on the field, which is
what they experience in a
somewhat more diluted, more
subtle form five days a week at
the job. So 1 really think it's going
to be a pretty tough job to change
football in the society the way it
is right now. Definitely.
How many players on the team
would you say agree with what
you're saying? I don't know a lot
of the young guys . . . But I have a
lot of friends on the team. 1
would say 10 to 15 are solid. The
rest are sort of equivocal about it.
And there are some people who
are totally involved in the football
trip and these people don't agree
with what I have to say. It's
definitely not as if I was sort of a
bad egg or something like that.
Would you go through playing
football here all over again if you
had known what you know now
about Stanford football? No. No I
wouldn't. First of all, I couldn't.
Knowing what I know now, it
would be suicidal, if you know
what I mean. It would just be a
waste of time. A very poor
allocation of time.
What are your future plans? I
would like to write, but I don't
think anything I've done as of yet
is any indication as to whether I
can or not. I mean this thing is
kind of, well speaking in terms of
writing expertise, it's a joke.
Really, it's a joke.

The complete text of the
October 5 LOOK Magazine article
by former Stanford football
player Tim McClure is reprinted
on page 15 of today's Daily. The
story, released last Monday
afternoon, immediately created
considerable controversy among
Stanford players, coaches, athletic
department employees, the local
press and the local community.
Claims of fabrication,
distortion and journalistic
irresponsibility were leveled
against LOOK, which is going out
of business following its October
19 issue. Some players agreed
with most of what the article said,
others denied its claims. Everyone
had something to say.
Finally in a number of last
Tuesday's newspapers, McClure
emerged to make some statements
about the article. According to
one paper he said, "Firmly
clinging to their primary purpose
of selling magazines, they (LOOK)

successfully sucked all the
subtlety from and totally
rearranged the content of my
article.
"Through this process they
invalidated any possibility of
communicating a constructive
criticism. The original degenerated
into a negative statement of
bitterness and frustration .. .
(But) if 1 decided to cancel
publication, I would be
inadvertently condoning the
present conditions."
Charges and countercharges
continued throughout the rest of
the week. Last night, in an
exclusive interview, the Daily
tried to clear up some questions
about the article.
How would you answer the
charges that n.uch of the article
was fallacious? Every incident in
the article is factual. But LOOK
just skimmed the events off the
top. They decided to keep my
manuscript because it was written
by a former Stanford football
player. They took the skeletal
outline and filled it out wherever
they wanted.
Why did you write the original
article? The original reason why I
wrote the football article was
because I felt that people should
have an alternative viewpoint
presented to them about the
football program, because all you
ever hear about is from the
athletic department—obviously a
biased account... 1 just felt it
was important that everyone
found out what a lot of guys on
the football team have to say.
How did you actually get into
writing it? There is a large
contingent of players on the team
that felt the way I did. I like
literature and the thought struck
me that I might want to do some

writing. And I turned to the most
intimate, intense experience that
I'd ever had which would be of
interest to people, and that was
football. I thought this would be a
perfect situation for me to write
about. I finished the original
fifteen page manuscript sometime
around April.
What was the chronology of your
relationship with LOOK? After
having submitted the article to
LOOK, I met Jared Lebow in the
Mark Hopkins Hotel in San
Francisco. He said that we would
have to change the article around
quite a bit. Something about it
being too mythological. I don't
know the implications of that. I
guess maybe it was too intricate
or something like that. He taped a
conversation with me and asked
me a lot about drugs, because as 1
was to find out later, this was to
be the major thrust of the article.
The selling point. The headlines
and all that. So he just tape
recorded this thing and split. And
I didn't hear from him for three
months. Then 1 called him and
asked him if this thing was going
to happen. And he said, yeah,
yeah, 1 got a couple of other
stories to do. On and on until two
weeks before publication date,
when he sends me this abortion.
He asks me if it's cool to print
this. First of all, I wrote just a
venemous letter to them saying
that he totally missed the point,
that it was totally negativistic and
totally detrimental to everybody
concerned and that it was poor
writing. 1 didn't have the guts to

send the letter because right when
I was going to mail it, he called
me up and I just recited it to him
over the phone verbally and he
says, well what do you want to do
about it, 1 can't change it. Then I
had to decide whether I should let
this poorly-written, negative thing
actually happen. And 1 decided
that people really never did hear
about the more sordid aspects of
football and that there was really
no way they could because no one
had means of communicating
through the mass media like I did
at that time. So I just had to
decide whether I would present
this totally polarized, sensational
version or not. If I cancelled
publication, no one would've
heard about what was wrong with
football and everyone would've
gone along pretty blissfully
ignorant of what football was
really about. So that was how I
made my decision. I knew I was
making a concession, a personal
concession if nothing else.
After the LOOK story appeared
didn't you say that your intention
was to criticize football and
society as a whole more than just
Stanford and Ralston? Obviously,
my intent was not just an
indictment of Stanford. The point
is that football itself is mistaken
because it's become just unwieldy.
It's just become too big. Because
there are too many alumni,
administrators and fans, and the
pressure is put on the coach
because of a huge spectacle in
front of 60,0 00 people—people
just go there to have a good time.

And the coach has to produce a
winner and in order to do that he
has to make a lot of concessions
in his relations with the players.
How would you look back on
your own experiences with
Ralston and Stanford football as
weighed aginst what you possibly
would've gone through elsewhere?
Well I've heard a lot of horror
stories about other schools and 1
guess on the spectrum of football
coaches and their leniency
spectrum, so to speak, I would say
Raiston's pretty lenient. But
that's in a given environment, a
given circumstance. On a wider
spectrum, sort of everyday life,
he's totally restrictive. It's really
not that important that Raiston's
a nice football coach, if you know
what I mean. Because football
demands so much, that no matter
where you are, you're going to get
screwed.
At a Football Writer's luncheon
on Tuesday, Stanford Sports
Information Director Bob Murphy
claimed that a number of points
in the LOOK article were
completely erroneous. Would you
comment on the following
statements in the article which he
claimed were untrue. Murphy said
that you did not receive "room,
board, a little spending money"
as the article says. I just received
tuition. Murphy also says that the
trip to Las Vegas following the
Arkansas game was his idea and
not a player's demand. I just
know that there were several
demands. And incredibly trivial
things. Like during two-a-day
practices having clean jocks and
having the athletic department
reimburse us for our traveling
jackets. We wanted to stop
somewhere after the game, but it's
possible that Vegas was Murphy's
suggestion.
In your original manuscript wasn't

there quite a bit written about
Murphy which LOOK left out of
their article? That's true because
that was one of my main
concerns. Definitely the main
concern I had for writing the
article was the psychological
indoctrination. And he is the chief
proponent and instigator of that
propaganda ... We go to a dinner
and he gets up and he goes
through this comical routine
thing, you know, you've heard
him, afid he just bandies the
players' names around as if they
were some kind of toy or machine
or something—something playful
for all the alumni to get some
kind of vicarious athletic thrill
from. And I went through the
press book he hands out and I
selected salient passages from each
player and put them up on a
board and they were incredibly
similar. .. Like there were four
categories—intelligent student of
the game; smart player; loves to
hit ... I just sort of laid it down
and put it in context and laid it
on the table. And just got a real
straight shot of what he was
doing. That's just a manifestation
of the state of football because
that's demanded of
everybody—the simplistic sort of
one-dimensional portrait of what
football players are like. You
know it's all tied in and you can't
extract one part and do away with

their article? That's true because
that was one of my main
concerns. Definitely the main
concern I had for writing the
article was the psychological
indoctrination. And he is the chief
proponent and instigator of that
propaganda ... We go to a dinner
and he gets up and he goes
through this comical routine
thing, you know, you've heard
him, afid he just bandies the
players' names around as if they
were some kind of toy or machine
or something—something playful
for all the alumni to get some
kind of vicarious athletic thrill
from. And I went through the
press book he hands out and I
selected salient passages from each
player and put them up on a
board and they were incredibly
similar. .. Like there were four
categories—intelligent student of
the game; smart player; loves to
hit ... I just sort of laid it down
and put it in context and laid it
on the table. And just got a real
straight shot of what he was
doing. That's just a manifestation
of the state of football because
that's demanded of
everybody—the simplistic sort of
one-dimensional portrait of what
football players are like. You
know it's all tied in and you can't
extract one part and do away with
it and still maintain the program
the way it exists. Because it's
impossible.
What do you see as the future
hope for improving football?
What changes can be made to
make football into a more positive
thing? You can't isolate one
factor in a football program. You
really can't isolate one factor in
society. This is a very complicated
question. It gets to the whole
Protestant-Western ethic thing.
This competitive thing. And
football is a crystalization of
society—of the drives in society. A
lot of football players—as a lot of
young people—are going through a

sort of metamorphisis, and sort of
replacing this hyper-competitive
thing with sort of a more mellow
approach. Not this dog-eat-dog
type thing. Football is a very
explainable phenomenon in
capitalistic society because of this
competition. People can go on
Saturday and see everyone
fighting on the field, which is
what they experience in a
somewhat more diluted, more
subtle form five days a week at
the job. So 1 really think it's going
to be a pretty tough job to change
football in the society the way it
is right now. Definitely.
How many players on the team
would you say agree with what
you're saying? I don't know a lot
of the young guys . . . But I have a
lot of friends on the team. 1
would say 10 to 15 are solid. The
rest are sort of equivocal about it.
And there are some people who
are totally involved in the football
trip and these people don't agree
with what I have to say. It's
definitely not as if I was sort of a
bad egg or something like that.
Would you go through playing
football here all over again if you
had known what you know now
about Stanford football? No. No I
wouldn't. First of all, I couldn't.
Knowing what I know now, it
would be suicidal, if you know
what I mean. It would just be a
waste of time. A very poor
allocation of time.
What are your future plans? I
would like to write, but I don't
think anything I've done as of yet
is any indication as to whether I
can or not. I mean this thing is
kind of, well speaking in terms of
writing expertise, it's a joke.
Really, it's a joke.

The complete text of the
October 5 LOOK Magazine article
by former Stanford football
player Tim McClure is reprinted
on page 15 of today's Daily. The
story, released last Monday
afternoon, immediately created
considerable controversy among
Stanford players, coaches, athletic
department employees, the local
press and the local community.
Claims of fabrication,
distortion and journalistic
irresponsibility were leveled
against LOOK, which is going out
of business following its October
19 issue. Some players agreed
with most of what the article said,
others denied its claims. Everyone
had something to say.
Finally in a number of last
Tuesday's newspapers, McClure
emerged to make some statements
about the article. According to
one paper he said, "Firmly
clinging to their primary purpose
of selling magazines, they (LOOK)

successfully sucked all the
subtlety from and totally
rearranged the content of my
article.
"Through this process they
invalidated any possibility of
communicating a constructive
criticism. The original degenerated
into a negative statement of
bitterness and frustration .. .
(But) if 1 decided to cancel
publication, I would be
inadvertently condoning the
present conditions."
Charges and countercharges
continued throughout the rest of
the week. Last night, in an
exclusive interview, the Daily
tried to clear up some questions
about the article.
How would you answer the
charges that n.uch of the article
was fallacious? Every incident in
the article is factual. But LOOK
just skimmed the events off the
top. They decided to keep my
manuscript because it was written
by a former Stanford football
player. They took the skeletal
outline and filled it out wherever
they wanted.
Why did you write the original
article? The original reason why I
wrote the football article was
because I felt that people should
have an alternative viewpoint
presented to them about the
football program, because all you
ever hear about is from the
athletic department—obviously a
biased account... 1 just felt it
was important that everyone
found out what a lot of guys on
the football team have to say.
How did you actually get into
writing it? There is a large
contingent of players on the team
that felt the way I did. I like
literature and the thought struck
me that I might want to do some

writing. And I turned to the most
intimate, intense experience that
I'd ever had which would be of
interest to people, and that was
football. I thought this would be a
perfect situation for me to write
about. I finished the original
fifteen page manuscript sometime
around April.
What was the chronology of your
relationship with LOOK? After
having submitted the article to
LOOK, I met Jared Lebow in the
Mark Hopkins Hotel in San
Francisco. He said that we would
have to change the article around
quite a bit. Something about it
being too mythological. I don't
know the implications of that. I
guess maybe it was too intricate
or something like that. He taped a
conversation with me and asked
me a lot about drugs, because as 1
was to find out later, this was to
be the major thrust of the article.
The selling point. The headlines
and all that. So he just tape
recorded this thing and split. And
I didn't hear from him for three
months. Then 1 called him and
asked him if this thing was going
to happen. And he said, yeah,
yeah, 1 got a couple of other
stories to do. On and on until two
weeks before publication date,
when he sends me this abortion.
He asks me if it's cool to print
this. First of all, I wrote just a
venemous letter to them saying
that he totally missed the point,
that it was totally negativistic and
totally detrimental to everybody
concerned and that it was poor
writing. 1 didn't have the guts to

send the letter because right when
I was going to mail it, he called
me up and I just recited it to him
over the phone verbally and he
says, well what do you want to do
about it, 1 can't change it. Then I
had to decide whether I should let
this poorly-written, negative thing
actually happen. And 1 decided
that people really never did hear
about the more sordid aspects of
football and that there was really
no way they could because no one
had means of communicating
through the mass media like I did
at that time. So I just had to
decide whether I would present
this totally polarized, sensational
version or not. If I cancelled
publication, no one would've
heard about what was wrong with
football and everyone would've
gone along pretty blissfully
ignorant of what football was
really about. So that was how I
made my decision. I knew I was
making a concession, a personal
concession if nothing else.
After the LOOK story appeared
didn't you say that your intention
was to criticize football and
society as a whole more than just
Stanford and Ralston? Obviously,
my intent was not just an
indictment of Stanford. The point
is that football itself is mistaken
because it's become just unwieldy.
It's just become too big. Because
there are too many alumni,
administrators and fans, and the
pressure is put on the coach
because of a huge spectacle in
front of 60,0 00 people—people
just go there to have a good time.

And the coach has to produce a
winner and in order to do that he
has to make a lot of concessions
in his relations with the players.
How would you look back on
your own experiences with
Ralston and Stanford football as
weighed aginst what you possibly
would've gone through elsewhere?
Well I've heard a lot of horror
stories about other schools and 1
guess on the spectrum of football
coaches and their leniency
spectrum, so to speak, I would say
Raiston's pretty lenient. But
that's in a given environment, a
given circumstance. On a wider
spectrum, sort of everyday life,
he's totally restrictive. It's really
not that important that Raiston's
a nice football coach, if you know
what I mean. Because football
demands so much, that no matter
where you are, you're going to get
screwed.
At a Football Writer's luncheon
on Tuesday, Stanford Sports
Information Director Bob Murphy
claimed that a number of points
in the LOOK article were
completely erroneous. Would you
comment on the following
statements in the article which he
claimed were untrue. Murphy said
that you did not receive "room,
board, a little spending money"
as the article says. I just received
tuition. Murphy also says that the
trip to Las Vegas following the
Arkansas game was his idea and
not a player's demand. I just
know that there were several
demands. And incredibly trivial
things. Like during two-a-day
practices having clean jocks and
having the athletic department
reimburse us for our traveling
jackets. We wanted to stop
somewhere after the game, but it's
possible that Vegas was Murphy's
suggestion.
