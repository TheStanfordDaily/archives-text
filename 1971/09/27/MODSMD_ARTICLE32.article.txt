"Good-bye to ail that RAH,
RAH!" LOOK Magazine, October
5, 19 71 issue, by Tim McClure
with Jared Lebow, LOOK
Associate Sports Editor.

At this time last year, Tim
McClure was a defensive tackle on
the Stanford University football
team. A sinewy six-foot-two, he
was hardworking, intelligent and
aggressive. Everything a coach
could ash for. But something was
bothering him as he went through
the motions of blocking and
tackling in practice and in games.
"Playing football just wasn't
fun any more," he said, "and
when I sat down and thought
about it seriously, I realized that
at Stanford, it never had been
fun."
It bothered Tim that people
weren't seeing what they thought
they were seeing when they
watched a college football game,
that few realized how tightly
coaches controlled the lives of
their players or knew about the
drugs and the callous treatment of
injured athletes.

So he contacted LOOK and
asked us to help him tell his story.
"It appears to be accepted
doctrine that the coach must be a
tyrant," said McClure. "Merely
conditioning athletes is no longer
enough. Coaches feel they must
tell a player how to think. I went
through many changes in the last
four years, changes every college
student goes through.
Unfortunately, coaches don't like
to deal with change. It frightens
them. They don't seem to realize
that a real crisis faces them as
more and more athletes refuse to
become pawns in their silly games.
To survive, football will have to
undergo some radical changes. A
good beginning might be to give
control of the sport back to the
athletes. "
In high school, McClure had
been, in his words, "into
football." All that changed at
Stanford, where he found an
employee-employer relationship
between the staff and the team.
"It was strictly business. We really
didn't know the coaches, and they
really didn't know us except on
the most superficial level. "

Armed with a degree in
English, McClure was happy to
say goodbye to his four years of,
college foot jail last spring. This is
his farewell message:
Picture this: it's half time at
the 1971 Rose Bowl game,
Stanford versus Ohio State, and as
millions of football fans stare
blankly at their television sets, the
NCAA seal flashes across the
screen and the suddenly solemn
voice of Curt Gowdy reads the
following announcement: "Fie like
America's college athletes. Turn
on to sports, not to drugs."
Now let's switch to the
Stanford dressing room. Tired
young men in sweat-stained red
jerseys pull off their helmets and
collapse on wooden benches.
What's this? The pressure to win is
so great that some of the players,
without the coach's knowledge,
are removing little green capsules
from their lockers and popping
them into their mouths. Minutes
later, they begin to feel waves of
exhilaration. Their pupils dilate,

their eyes assume a saucer-like
shape. They are turning on.
But not to sports.
At Stanford, we called it
"beaning up," taking
amphetamines to get the heart
pumping faster and the body
functioning at an accelerated
pace. Most players swallow speed
out of self-defense, since the odds
are their opponents are also taking
the drug.
Last season, after the
University of California turned in
a particularly lackluster
performance against San Jose
State, a small-time football school
with big-time aspirations, I asked
a friend of mine on the Cal team
what happened. "Oh, it was
simple," he said. "We just ran out
of beans."
Sometimes even beans don't
help. Like when we were playing
Washington State in Spokane last
year and I wrecked my knee on
the artificial turf. Its boosters say
this kind of playing surface
reduces injuries, but that's not
what happened in my case. No
one hit me, I just slipped and
went flying, tearing ligaments and
cartilage. After that, I was just a
piece of broken machinery as far
as the coaching staff was
concerned. Not even my defensive

line coach stopped by the hospital
to say hello.
That was one of many reasons
1 was happy to graduate last June
and say good-bye to my four-year
career as a college football player.
But before I go into any more
details, let me set the record
straight. I'm no hippie-radical
dope-fiend-troublemaker. I was
just a guy trying to get a college
education who'd been misled.
You see, I always thought football
was a great game, and that games
were supposed to be for the
enjoyment of the athletes
involved. It didn't take me long to
discover that at the college level,
at least at those institutions in the
"major college football team"
category, football is not fun at all.
It is business, a very serious
business.
Well then, you may rightly ask,
if it was so horrible, how did a
bright young fellow like me get
sucked into it? For the answer, I
have to go back to my senior year

at Will C. Crawford High in San
Diego.
I was the ail-American kid,
captain of the football team, vice
president of the student body,
catcher on the baseball team. I
even dated the captain of the
cheerleader squad. It wasn't long
after my final high school game
that football recruiters from
various universities started
dropping by my home, buying me
steak dinners, inviting me on
all-expense-paid trips to their
campuses, when l they got me
dates and invitations to fraternity
parties. It was a pretty heady
experience for an 18-year-old boy.
But even then, naive as I was, I
began to suspect something was
wrong. Here were these
square-shouldered, close-cropped,
middle-aged men, clad in blue
blazers with their university's
insignia emblazoned on the
left-hand pocket, all trying to
convince me that the entire
athletic department and a sizable

portion of the student body were
desperately concerned that 1
choose their school.
One of the more unusual sales
pitches came from the Navy head
coach, Bill Elias. He was in San
Diego to visit some prospects and
invited me up to his hotel room.
My dad's a lieutenant
commander in the naval reserve,
and the idea of having a son at
Annapolis appealed to him, so he
came along.
There was Elias, sprawled
across a bed, elbow propped up
on a pillow, rapping about the
Academy's traditions, its
distinguished graduates and the
comradeship of the brigade of
midshipmen. Then, with a wry
smile, he informed us that getting
an appointment would be no
hassle since the athletic
department got those
appointments originally intended
for predominantly black
congressional districts. I guess
nobody gave a damn about
recruiting future black officers for
the Navy.
Anyway, I finally ended up at
Stanford, signing what was in
effect a four-year contract. I'd
play ball, and they'd give me
room, board, a little spending
money and, oh yes, a college
education.
I chose Stanford for a variety
of reasons. It's a prestige school,
one of the best in the nation, with
a strong academic program that
gives students the opportunity to
spend their junior year in Europe.
Later on I learned the football
coaches, who bragged about this
program when recruiting players,
weren't happy when players took
advantage of it, especially if spring
practice or, even worse, the
football season was missed.
In fact, the coaches had very
little concern with academics.
Football players are at Stanford
to play football. If they get an
education in the time that's left
over, fine. If not, well, they had
the chance, didn't they?
We reported for practice in
mid-August last year, a week
earlier than usual because an extra
game had been added to our
schedule. Costs had gone up, and
a new source of revenue had to be
found to balance the books. An
eleventh regular-season game was
that source. At first there was a
tinge of excitement, because we
were going to play Arkansas on
national television and it was a
chance to catapult Stanford into
the Top Ten. But once the
two-a-day practice sessions began,
that glow quickly wore off.
This was weeks before classes
started, and we were spending
about seven hours a day
practicing. Before it all began,
Head Coach John Ralston gave us
a little speech about how this was
the year Stanford was going to the
Rose Bowl and about how the
coaching staff was going to break
down our minds and bodies and
rebuild us.
Coach Ralston just loved little
homilies like that. Give him half a
chance, and he'd launch into his
"pain is a blessing because it keeps
players awake and alert" speech.

Let him catch a player easing
aching muscles in a whirlpool bath
and out came, "You can't make
the club in the tub." If a practice
session were being filmed, he'd
walk around saying, "You can't
get away from the eye in the
sky."
Sure it was all kind of funny,
but the thing was Ralston was
absolutely serious. He really
believed what he was saying.
At the gym entrance there's a
display of ex-Stanford greats now
in pro football. Each picture is a
testament to the coach's program,
implying that you, too, can be
like these famous pros if you just
follow our simple four-year,
knuckle-down planâ€”the unstated,
but implicit message being that
the ultimate goal of any college
athlete should be a career as a
professional athlete.
One of the Coach's major
concerns was hair. He hated it.
When Terrell Smith, an offensive
guard, showed up with a beard

and long locks, Ralston went into
his annual shape-up-or-get-out
tantrum. You can always tell the
football players at Stanford.
They're the guys with short hair.
This does wonders in further
segregating us from the rest of the
student body, many of whom
think we're dolts anyway. When
one of the football players, Steve
Jubb, hurt his ankle playing rugby
in the off season, the footbail
trainer refused to treat him
because he'd let his hair grow too
long, so he had to drag his
throbbing ankle to the barber
before he could get it taped by
the trainer.
This concern with hair is just a
part of Coach Ralston's effort to
control how his players look and
think. His attempts at
indoctrination reached absurd
heights before the Arkansas game,
when he hired a troop of
professional incentive builders to
psych us up for the season opener.
It was absurd because he'd
tried the same thing and failed
before the previous season's
Southern Cal game. Actually, we
all kind of look forward to the
USC match. Many players on both
teams went to high school in
Southern California and knew
each other off the field. USC
always has one of the nation's
strongest teams, and it's enjoyable
to play against the best. Besides,
the game is a sellout, and each
player is usually able to scalp his
four free tickets for about a
hundred dollars.
Anyway, we were all herded
into a meeting room and faced

with a fellow in a business suit,
surrounded by charts.
"What kind of cow are you?"
he shouts. "Are you a praise cow?
I'm a praise cow. I want people to
give me praise; that's why I work
hard. Now, if you work hard,
you're going to get praise from all
your friends for beating USC."
Well, right there, the meeting
started going downhill. Guys were
laughing at him, and he began
getting desperate. Finally, he just
lost control and started doing an
imitation of Daffy Duck, like he
was Daffy Duck on a TV show
before he became an incentive
builder.
To be honest, he did a pretty
good Daffy Duck, but we lost to
USC anyway.
Not one to admit defeat,
Ralston invited a different crew of
pitchmen to build us up for the
Arkansas game. He introduced the
main speaker and mentioned that
after a single session, such as the
one we were about to experience,
sales usually shot up 12 percent.
Maybe we were supposed to sell
our kneepads to the Arkansas
players.
"Who's going to win
Saturday?" shouted Mr. Incentive.
Dead silence. It was one o'clock,
hot and right in the middle of
two-a-day practices. When he
realized there would be no pep
rally, he changed tactics by
passing out blank cards and asking
us to write down what Coach
Ralston would say after the game.
He handed one to linebacker
Dennis Moore, and Dennis
dropped it. He tried to give
Dennis a second card but was
fixed with such a blood-chilling
stare that he stumbled back to the
platform. In a last-ditch effort, he
called on our All America
quarterback, a guy who was to
win the Heisman Trophy, to stand
as an example of one who had
overcome hardships to achieve
success. Not a bad idea, except he
introduced him as Jerry Plunkett.
Even Jim, a straight arrow liked
by both players and coaches,
broke up.
The first signs of rebellion
appeared when two of my
teammates, Jim Kauffman and
Dan Lightfoot, paid a visit to
Athletic Director Chuck Taylor.
The feeling was that if the players
had to report back early for an
extra game to make the athletic
department extra money, they
should get something in return.
The demands were trivialâ€”clean
athletic supporters and socks for
every practice, free blazers for our
road trips and a stop in Las Vegas
on the way back from Arkansas.

After much haggling, the demands
were met.
Well, we beat Arkansas, San
Jose State and Oregon before
losing to Purdue. Then we upset
USC, and flew up to Spokane to
play Washington State. It was a
pleasant afternoon for the
teamâ€”Stanford won 63-16â€”but a
painful one for me, because it was
that day my left knee was
wrecked.
I was still in the hospital when
Stanford won its next three
conference games before losing to
a non-conference opponent, the
Air Force Academy. The game
wasn't very important, and
Charles Saibel, one of our guards,
dropped by to say he was kind of
glad we lost, because Air Force
wanted to win so badly and it
made them so happy when they
did.
All in all, the season was a huge
success for the coaches. We
finished with an 8-3 record, won
the Pacific Coast Conference title
and received Stanford's first Rose
Bowl invitation in 19 years. When
we had our annual end-of-season
banquet following the Cal game,
everyone was in a good mood.
Coach Ralston needed only a few
minutes to shatter it.
As in the past, we all gathered
in a Cantonese restaurant, ate all
we could hold, kidded around and
in general relaxed after four
months of hard work.
Dinner completed, Bob
Murphy, the sports publicity
director, introduced Coach
Ralston as the West Coast Coach
of the Year and candidate for
national coach of the year.
Ralston thanked Murphy and then
declared he had little chance to
win the latter award with our 8-3
record since Bob Devaney of
Nebraska was 10-0 and Darrel
Royal of Texas was undefeated
and Ara Parseghian had lost only
one. Then he began berating us
for the two late-season losses to
Air Force and California. By now,
we had braced ourselves for a
most unpleasant evening.
After condemning us for those
losses, Ralston dismissed the past
11 games and launched into an
account of what the future held.
There would be 20 days of
practice in preparation for the
Rose Bowl, including six days of
two-a-day workouts during our
Christmas vacations. Bitterly, he
added there were rumors about
our being unhappy with two-a-day
workouts and that this disgusted
him.
We began practice two days
before finals' week. Since football
takes from four to five hours a
day during the regular season,
most of the players felt this
climactic imposition was a bit
much. Because of it, many found
themselves in academic trouble.
We arrived in Pasadena on
December 22, and a strict 10:30
p.m. curfew was imposed. A fleet
of fancy cars provided for our use
never left their parking spaces.
Other than a visit to Disneyland
and an awards banquet, we had to
spend our free time between
practice sessions viewing football
films of ourselves and Ohio State.
After five days of this, Dan
Lightfoot, an offensive guard, and
I called a meeting to discuss our
grievances. Thirty-five members of
the 50-man squad showed up; the
rest had failed to hear about the
meeting. All present, except
co-captains Jack Shultz and
Plunkett, felt two practice
sessions a day was one too many
and that the curfew was too early.
Demea Washington, split end,
suggested sending a delegation to

Ralston to urge an end to daily
double-practice sessions.
So Demea, Ron Kadziel, a
linebacker, and Schultz and
Plunkett were chosen to visit
Ralston's suite. Sending the
captains along was a bad decision.
Throughout the season both had
been Ralston's strongest
supporters. Although sincere in
offering to communicate the
team's grievances, they found it
an impossible task because neither

one could understand why any
player would contradict his coach
in the first place.
Sensing the outcome, Demea
spoke up. He told Ralston of the
team's dissatisfaction, and the
Coach promised a conciliatory
message the next morning.
Before his talk, we held
another meeting. By this time,
sentiment was running high in
favor of refusing to practice if our
complaints weren't taken into
account. We decided to hear
Ralston out, then, depending on
his message, plan a course of
action.
A master of the emotional
appeal, Ralston managed to abort
our rebellion without losing a
minute of practice time. He
simply threatened to resign if he
couldn't have complete control of
the team. We just caved in.
He made a short, but very
effective, speech and then left the
locker room. For several minutes
we sat in silence, until Jim
Kauffman said something to the
effect that we should let him have
his way this time. Then, just
before the whole squad swung
passively behind the Coach, Dan
Lightfoot tried to swing the team
back to its original position. He
warned against bowing to Coach
Ralston when we thought our
grievances were justified.
Demea Washington followed
with a fiery answer to Ralston.
"As long as football players stay
lily-white, men like Ralston will
continue to coach. And I'm not
talking about skin color," he
shouted. "When ballplayers start
realizing they don't have to take
everything that comes down on
them, things are really gonna
change."
Seconds after Demea's fierv

oration, Ralston stuck his head in
and shouted, "Two minutes!"
With that, everyone fied his
shoelaces and trudged out to
practice.
If only we had known what
had already taken place at Ohio
State, we probably wouldn't have
folded so easily. Ohio State Coach
Woody Hayes had taken his team
to the 1969 Rose Bowl and ran
what amounted to a military
camp while preparing for the

game. The sophomores on that
team were seniors now and
wanted no part of a repeat
performance when they came to
California this time.
I met several Ohio State
players during our trip to
Disneyland, and they told me that
all the seniors on the squad had
gone to Hayes with an ultimatum:
no two-a-day practices before the
game. When he heard that, Hayes
went a little crazy, he began
ranting and raving, but the players
knew they held the trump card
and refused to cave in. This time,
it was the coach who was forced
to compromise.
I'm repeating this story to
correct an illusion created by the
press before the Rose Bowl game.
It seems that Stanford's
reputation as the "Harvard of the
West" and Haves' reputation as a
hard-nosed martinet affected the
way both training camps were
covered.
According to the media, Ohio
State was holding rugged practice
sessions behind closed doors,
while the Stanford team was
taking it easy, treating the Rose
Bowl game as fun, just a way to
enjoy Christmas vacation. Woody
Hayes became the bad guy, and
easy-going John Ralston the good
guy-
It just wasn't so. In their
approach to college football, they
are both "bad guys."
Actually, it isn't all the coach's
fault. If he doesn't produce a
winner, he loses his job. An
unsettling prospect for a man like
Ralston with a wife and three
kids. I'm sure if the players had a
chance to know Ralston better
they would find him a very decent
guy, but he simply can't afford to
have that kind of relationship
with the team. Stanford must
average 40,000 paid spectators for
each home game to make money
with football. It's an economic
fact of life the coach has to live
with.
So football, which began as a
game run by students for
students, has, at several hundred
colleges and universities, been
wrested away from the players'
control. At Stanford, football is a
large and serious undertaking,
with eight full-time coaches, a
publicity man and numerous
other employees. The result is a
frantic coach and a squad of
understandably disgruntled
players.
These changing attitudes have
finally become obvious to the
coaches, and they are taking
precautions against a full-scale
â€¢rebellion. At least that's the case
at Stanford, which appears headed
for the ultimate bad-trip football
scene. They've begun recruiting
junior-college players in large
numbers. Most of these are
fellows who couldn't have gotten
into Stanford as freshmen, but
after two years at a junior college,
they can enter as juniors, with
two years of football eligibility
left.
Of course, things aren't all bad.
The other day, someone said that
college football must be fun at
some school.
I said, yes, it must be fun at
Pomona State. He said he'd never
heard of Pomona State.
That's why, I said, it must be
fun to play football there.


Okay guys this
is a tough one. lets
all swallow hard
and try to win one
for the pus her.

that source. At first there was a
tinge of excitement, because we
were going to play Arkansas on
national television and it was a
chance to catapult Stanford into
the Top Ten. But once the
two-a-day practice sessions began,
that glow quickly wore off.
This was weeks before classes
started, and we were spending
about seven hours a day
practicing. Before it all began,
Head Coach John Ralston gave us
a little speech about how this was
the year Stanford was going to the
Rose Bowl and about how the
coaching staff was going to break
down our minds and bodies and
rebuild us.
Coach Ralston just loved little
homilies like that. Give him half a
chance, and he'd launch into his
"pain is a blessing because it keeps
players awake and alert" speech.

Let him catch a player easing
aching muscles in a whirlpool bath
and out came, "You can't make
the club in the tub." If a practice
session were being filmed, he'd
walk around saying, "You can't
get away from the eye in the
sky."
Sure it was all kind of funny,
but the thing was Ralston was
absolutely serious. He really
believed what he was saying.
At the gym entrance there's a
display of ex-Stanford greats now
in pro football. Each picture is a
testament to the coach's program,
implying that you, too, can be
like these famous pros if you just
follow our simple four-year,
knuckle-down planâ€”the unstated,
but implicit message being that
the ultimate goal of any college
athlete should be a career as a
professional athlete.
One of the Coach's major
concerns was hair. He hated it.
When Terrell Smith, an offensive
guard, showed up with a beard

and long locks, Ralston went into
his annual shape-up-or-get-out
tantrum. You can always tell the
football players at Stanford.
They're the guys with short hair.
This does wonders in further
segregating us from the rest of the
student body, many of whom
think we're dolts anyway. When
one of the football players, Steve
Jubb, hurt his ankle playing rugby
in the off season, the footbail
trainer refused to treat him
because he'd let his hair grow too
long, so he had to drag his
throbbing ankle to the barber
before he could get it taped by
the trainer.
This concern with hair is just a
part of Coach Ralston's effort to
control how his players look and
think. His attempts at
indoctrination reached absurd
heights before the Arkansas game,
when he hired a troop of
professional incentive builders to
psych us up for the season opener.
It was absurd because he'd
tried the same thing and failed
before the previous season's
Southern Cal game. Actually, we
all kind of look forward to the
USC match. Many players on both
teams went to high school in
Southern California and knew
each other off the field. USC
always has one of the nation's
strongest teams, and it's enjoyable
to play against the best. Besides,
the game is a sellout, and each
player is usually able to scalp his
four free tickets for about a
hundred dollars.
Anyway, we were all herded
into a meeting room and faced

with a fellow in a business suit,
surrounded by charts.
"What kind of cow are you?"
he shouts. "Are you a praise cow?
I'm a praise cow. I want people to
give me praise; that's why I work
hard. Now, if you work hard,
you're going to get praise from all
your friends for beating USC."
Well, right there, the meeting
started going downhill. Guys were
laughing at him, and he began
getting desperate. Finally, he just
lost control and started doing an
imitation of Daffy Duck, like he
was Daffy Duck on a TV show
before he became an incentive
builder.
To be honest, he did a pretty
good Daffy Duck, but we lost to
USC anyway.
Not one to admit defeat,
Ralston invited a different crew of
pitchmen to build us up for the
Arkansas game. He introduced the
main speaker and mentioned that
after a single session, such as the
one we were about to experience,
sales usually shot up 12 percent.
Maybe we were supposed to sell
our kneepads to the Arkansas
players.
"Who's going to win
Saturday?" shouted Mr. Incentive.
Dead silence. It was one o'clock,
hot and right in the middle of
two-a-day practices. When he
realized there would be no pep
rally, he changed tactics by
passing out blank cards and asking
us to write down what Coach
Ralston would say after the game.
He handed one to linebacker
Dennis Moore, and Dennis
dropped it. He tried to give
Dennis a second card but was
fixed with such a blood-chilling
stare that he stumbled back to the
platform. In a last-ditch effort, he
called on our All America
quarterback, a guy who was to
win the Heisman Trophy, to stand
as an example of one who had
overcome hardships to achieve
success. Not a bad idea, except he
introduced him as Jerry Plunkett.
Even Jim, a straight arrow liked
by both players and coaches,
broke up.
The first signs of rebellion
appeared when two of my
teammates, Jim Kauffman and
Dan Lightfoot, paid a visit to
Athletic Director Chuck Taylor.
The feeling was that if the players
had to report back early for an
extra game to make the athletic
department extra money, they
should get something in return.
The demands were trivialâ€”clean
athletic supporters and socks for
every practice, free blazers for our
road trips and a stop in Las Vegas
on the way back from Arkansas.

After much haggling, the demands
were met.
Well, we beat Arkansas, San
Jose State and Oregon before
losing to Purdue. Then we upset
USC, and flew up to Spokane to
play Washington State. It was a
pleasant afternoon for the
teamâ€”Stanford won 63-16â€”but a
painful one for me, because it was
that day my left knee was
wrecked.
I was still in the hospital when
Stanford won its next three
conference games before losing to
a non-conference opponent, the
Air Force Academy. The game
wasn't very important, and
Charles Saibel, one of our guards,
dropped by to say he was kind of
glad we lost, because Air Force
wanted to win so badly and it
made them so happy when they
did.
All in all, the season was a huge
success for the coaches. We
finished with an 8-3 record, won
the Pacific Coast Conference title
and received Stanford's first Rose
Bowl invitation in 19 years. When
we had our annual end-of-season
banquet following the Cal game,
everyone was in a good mood.
Coach Ralston needed only a few
minutes to shatter it.
As in the past, we all gathered
in a Cantonese restaurant, ate all
we could hold, kidded around and
in general relaxed after four
months of hard work.
Dinner completed, Bob
Murphy, the sports publicity
director, introduced Coach
Ralston as the West Coast Coach
of the Year and candidate for
national coach of the year.
Ralston thanked Murphy and then
declared he had little chance to
win the latter award with our 8-3
record since Bob Devaney of
Nebraska was 10-0 and Darrel
Royal of Texas was undefeated
and Ara Parseghian had lost only
one. Then he began berating us
for the two late-season losses to
Air Force and California. By now,
we had braced ourselves for a
most unpleasant evening.
After condemning us for those
losses, Ralston dismissed the past
11 games and launched into an
account of what the future held.
There would be 20 days of
practice in preparation for the
Rose Bowl, including six days of
two-a-day workouts during our
Christmas vacations. Bitterly, he
added there were rumors about
our being unhappy with two-a-day
workouts and that this disgusted
him.
We began practice two days
before finals' week. Since football
takes from four to five hours a
day during the regular season,
most of the players felt this
climactic imposition was a bit
much. Because of it, many found
themselves in academic trouble.
We arrived in Pasadena on
December 22, and a strict 10:30
p.m. curfew was imposed. A fleet
of fancy cars provided for our use
never left their parking spaces.
Other than a visit to Disneyland
and an awards banquet, we had to
spend our free time between
practice sessions viewing football
films of ourselves and Ohio State.
After five days of this, Dan
Lightfoot, an offensive guard, and
I called a meeting to discuss our
grievances. Thirty-five members of
the 50-man squad showed up; the
rest had failed to hear about the
meeting. All present, except
co-captains Jack Shultz and
Plunkett, felt two practice
sessions a day was one too many
and that the curfew was too early.
Demea Washington, split end,
suggested sending a delegation to

Ralston to urge an end to daily
double-practice sessions.
So Demea, Ron Kadziel, a
linebacker, and Schultz and
Plunkett were chosen to visit
Ralston's suite. Sending the
captains along was a bad decision.
Throughout the season both had
been Ralston's strongest
supporters. Although sincere in
offering to communicate the
team's grievances, they found it
an impossible task because neither

one could understand why any
player would contradict his coach
in the first place.
Sensing the outcome, Demea
spoke up. He told Ralston of the
team's dissatisfaction, and the
Coach promised a conciliatory
message the next morning.
Before his talk, we held
another meeting. By this time,
sentiment was running high in
favor of refusing to practice if our
complaints weren't taken into
account. We decided to hear
Ralston out, then, depending on
his message, plan a course of
action.
A master of the emotional
appeal, Ralston managed to abort
our rebellion without losing a
minute of practice time. He
simply threatened to resign if he
couldn't have complete control of
the team. We just caved in.
He made a short, but very
effective, speech and then left the
locker room. For several minutes
we sat in silence, until Jim
Kauffman said something to the
effect that we should let him have
his way this time. Then, just
before the whole squad swung
passively behind the Coach, Dan
Lightfoot tried to swing the team
back to its original position. He
warned against bowing to Coach
Ralston when we thought our
grievances were justified.
Demea Washington followed
with a fiery answer to Ralston.
"As long as football players stay
lily-white, men like Ralston will
continue to coach. And I'm not
talking about skin color," he
shouted. "When ballplayers start
realizing they don't have to take
everything that comes down on
them, things are really gonna
change."
Seconds after Demea's fierv

oration, Ralston stuck his head in
and shouted, "Two minutes!"
With that, everyone fied his
shoelaces and trudged out to
practice.
If only we had known what
had already taken place at Ohio
State, we probably wouldn't have
folded so easily. Ohio State Coach
Woody Hayes had taken his team
to the 1969 Rose Bowl and ran
what amounted to a military
camp while preparing for the

game. The sophomores on that
team were seniors now and
wanted no part of a repeat
performance when they came to
California this time.
I met several Ohio State
players during our trip to
Disneyland, and they told me that
all the seniors on the squad had
gone to Hayes with an ultimatum:
no two-a-day practices before the
game. When he heard that, Hayes
went a little crazy, he began
ranting and raving, but the players
knew they held the trump card
and refused to cave in. This time,
it was the coach who was forced
to compromise.
I'm repeating this story to
correct an illusion created by the
press before the Rose Bowl game.
It seems that Stanford's
reputation as the "Harvard of the
West" and Haves' reputation as a
hard-nosed martinet affected the
way both training camps were
covered.
According to the media, Ohio
State was holding rugged practice
sessions behind closed doors,
while the Stanford team was
taking it easy, treating the Rose
Bowl game as fun, just a way to
enjoy Christmas vacation. Woody
Hayes became the bad guy, and
easy-going John Ralston the good
guy-
It just wasn't so. In their
approach to college football, they
are both "bad guys."
Actually, it isn't all the coach's
fault. If he doesn't produce a
winner, he loses his job. An
unsettling prospect for a man like
Ralston with a wife and three
kids. I'm sure if the players had a
chance to know Ralston better
they would find him a very decent
guy, but he simply can't afford to
have that kind of relationship
with the team. Stanford must
average 40,000 paid spectators for
each home game to make money
with football. It's an economic
fact of life the coach has to live
with.
So football, which began as a
game run by students for
students, has, at several hundred
colleges and universities, been
wrested away from the players'
control. At Stanford, football is a
large and serious undertaking,
with eight full-time coaches, a
publicity man and numerous
other employees. The result is a
frantic coach and a squad of
understandably disgruntled
players.
These changing attitudes have
finally become obvious to the
coaches, and they are taking
precautions against a full-scale
â€¢rebellion. At least that's the case
at Stanford, which appears headed
for the ultimate bad-trip football
scene. They've begun recruiting
junior-college players in large
numbers. Most of these are
fellows who couldn't have gotten
into Stanford as freshmen, but
after two years at a junior college,
they can enter as juniors, with
two years of football eligibility
left.
Of course, things aren't all bad.
The other day, someone said that
college football must be fun at
some school.
I said, yes, it must be fun at
Pomona State. He said he'd never
heard of Pomona State.
That's why, I said, it must be
fun to play football there.


Okay guys this
is a tough one. lets
all swallow hard
and try to win one
for the pus her.

"Good-bye to ail that RAH,
RAH!" LOOK Magazine, October
5, 19 71 issue, by Tim McClure
with Jared Lebow, LOOK
Associate Sports Editor.
Reprinted with permission from
LOOK Magazine.
At this time last year, Tim
McClure was a defensive tackle on
the Stanford University football
team. A sinewy six-foot-two, he
was hardworking, intelligent and
aggressive. Everything a coach
could ash for. But something was
bothering him as he went through
the motions of blocking and
tackling in practice and in games.
"Playing football just wasn't
fun any more," he said, "and
when I sat down and thought
about it seriously, I realized that
at Stanford, it never had been
fun."
It bothered Tim that people
weren't seeing what they thought
they were seeing when they
watched a college football game,
that few realized how tightly
coaches controlled the lives of
their players or knew about the
drugs and the callous treatment of
injured athletes.

So he contacted LOOK and
asked us to help him tell his story.
"It appears to be accepted
doctrine that the coach must be a
tyrant," said McClure. "Merely
conditioning athletes is no longer
enough. Coaches feel they must
tell a player how to think. I went
through many changes in the last
four years, changes every college
student goes through.
Unfortunately, coaches don't like
to deal with change. It frightens
them. They don't seem to realize
that a real crisis faces them as
more and more athletes refuse to
become pawns in their silly games.
To survive, football will have to
undergo some radical changes. A
good beginning might be to give
control of the sport back to the
athletes. "
In high school, McClure had
been, in his words, "into
football." All that changed at
Stanford, where he found an
employee-employer relationship
between the staff and the team.
"It was strictly business. We really
didn't know the coaches, and they
really didn't know us except on
the most superficial level. "

Armed with a degree in
English, McClure was happy to
say goodbye to his four years of,
college foot jail last spring. This is
his farewell message:
Picture this: it's half time at
the 1971 Rose Bowl game,
Stanford versus Ohio State, and as
millions of football fans stare
blankly at their television sets, the
NCAA seal flashes across the
screen and the suddenly solemn
voice of Curt Gowdy reads the
following announcement: "Fie like
America's college athletes. Turn
on to sports, not to drugs."
Now let's switch to the
Stanford dressing room. Tired
young men in sweat-stained red
jerseys pull off their helmets and
collapse on wooden benches.
What's this? The pressure to win is
so great that some of the players,
without the coach's knowledge,
are removing little green capsules
from their lockers and popping
them into their mouths. Minutes
later, they begin to feel waves of
exhilaration. Their pupils dilate,

their eyes assume a saucer-like
shape. They are turning on.
But not to sports.
At Stanford, we called it
"beaning up," taking
amphetamines to get the heart
pumping faster and the body
functioning at an accelerated
pace. Most players swallow speed
out of self-defense, since the odds
are their opponents are also taking
the drug.
Last season, after the
University of California turned in
a particularly lackluster
performance against San Jose
State, a small-time football school
with big-time aspirations, I asked
a friend of mine on the Cal team
what happened. "Oh, it was
simple," he said. "We just ran out
of beans."
Sometimes even beans don't
help. Like when we were playing
Washington State in Spokane last
year and I wrecked my knee on
the artificial turf. Its boosters say
this kind of playing surface
reduces injuries, but that's not
what happened in my case. No
one hit me, I just slipped and
went flying, tearing ligaments and
cartilage. After that, I was just a
piece of broken machinery as far
as the coaching staff was
concerned. Not even my defensive

line coach stopped by the hospital
to say hello.
That was one of many reasons
1 was happy to graduate last June
and say good-bye to my four-year
career as a college football player.
But before I go into any more
details, let me set the record
straight. I'm no hippie-radical
dope-fiend-troublemaker. I was
just a guy trying to get a college
education who'd been misled.
You see, I always thought football
was a great game, and that games
were supposed to be for the
enjoyment of the athletes
involved. It didn't take me long to
discover that at the college level,
at least at those institutions in the
"major college football team"
category, football is not fun at all.
It is business, a very serious
business.
Well then, you may rightly ask,
if it was so horrible, how did a
bright young fellow like me get
sucked into it? For the answer, I
have to go back to my senior year

at Will C. Crawford High in San
Diego.
I was the ail-American kid,
captain of the football team, vice
president of the student body,
catcher on the baseball team. I
even dated the captain of the
cheerleader squad. It wasn't long
after my final high school game
that football recruiters from
various universities started
dropping by my home, buying me
steak dinners, inviting me on
all-expense-paid trips to their
campuses, when l they got me
dates and invitations to fraternity
parties. It was a pretty heady
experience for an 18-year-old boy.
But even then, naive as I was, I
began to suspect something was
wrong. Here were these
square-shouldered, close-cropped,
middle-aged men, clad in blue
blazers with their university's
insignia emblazoned on the
left-hand pocket, all trying to
convince me that the entire
athletic department and a sizable

portion of the student body were
desperately concerned that 1
choose their school.
One of the more unusual sales
pitches came from the Navy head
coach, Bill Elias. He was in San
Diego to visit some prospects and
invited me up to his hotel room.
My dad's a lieutenant
commander in the naval reserve,
and the idea of having a son at
Annapolis appealed to him, so he
came along.
There was Elias, sprawled
across a bed, elbow propped up
on a pillow, rapping about the
Academy's traditions, its
distinguished graduates and the
comradeship of the brigade of
midshipmen. Then, with a wry
smile, he informed us that getting
an appointment would be no
hassle since the athletic
department got those
appointments originally intended
for predominantly black
congressional districts. I guess
nobody gave a damn about
recruiting future black officers for
the Navy.
Anyway, I finally ended up at
Stanford, signing what was in
effect a four-year contract. I'd
play ball, and they'd give me
room, board, a little spending
money and, oh yes, a college
education.
I chose Stanford for a variety
of reasons. It's a prestige school,
one of the best in the nation, with
a strong academic program that
gives students the opportunity to
spend their junior year in Europe.
Later on I learned the football
coaches, who bragged about this
program when recruiting players,
weren't happy when players took
advantage of it, especially if spring
practice or, even worse, the
football season was missed.
In fact, the coaches had very
little concern with academics.
Football players are at Stanford
to play football. If they get an
education in the time that's left
over, fine. If not, well, they had
the chance, didn't they?
We reported for practice in
mid-August last year, a week
earlier than usual because an extra
game had been added to our
schedule. Costs had gone up, and
a new source of revenue had to be
found to balance the books. An
eleventh regular-season game was
that source. At first there was a
tinge of excitement, because we
were going to play Arkansas on
national television and it was a
chance to catapult Stanford into
the Top Ten. But once the
two-a-day practice sessions began,
that glow quickly wore off.
This was weeks before classes
started, and we were spending
about seven hours a day

Head Coach John Ralston gave us

day during the regular season,
most of the players felt this
climactic imposition was a bit
much. Because of it, many found
themselves in academic trouble.
We arrived in Pasadena on
December 22, and a strict 10:30
p.m. curfew was imposed. A fleet
of fancy cars provided for our use
never left their parking spaces.
Other than a visit to Disneyland
and an awards banquet, we had to
spend our free time between
practice sessions viewing football
films of ourselves and Ohio State.
After five days of this, Dan
Lightfoot, an offensive guard, and
I called a meeting to discuss our
grievances. Thirty-five members of
the 50-man squad showed up; the
rest had failed to hear about the
meeting. All present, except
co-captains Jack Shultz and
Plunkett, felt two practice
sessions a day was one too many
and that the curfew was too early.
Demea Washington, split end,
suggested sending a delegation to

Ralston to urge an end to daily
double-practice sessions.
So Demea, Ron Kadziel, a
linebacker, and Schultz and
Plunkett were chosen to visit
Ralston's suite. Sending the
captains along was a bad decision.
Throughout the season both had
been Ralston's strongest
supporters. Although sincere in
offering to communicate the
team's grievances, they found it
an impossible task because neither

one could understand why any
player would contradict his coach
in the first place.
Sensing the outcome, Demea
spoke up. He told Ralston of the
team's dissatisfaction, and the
Coach promised a conciliatory
message the next morning.
Before his talk, we held
another meeting. By this time,
sentiment was running high in
favor of refusing to practice if our
complaints weren't taken into
account. We decided to hear
Ralston out, then, depending on
his message, plan a course of
action.
A master of the emotional
appeal, Ralston managed to abort
our rebellion without losing a
minute of practice time. He
simply threatened to resign if he
couldn't have complete control of
the team. We just caved in.
He made a short, but very
effective, speech and then left the
locker room. For several minutes
we sat in silence, until Jim
Kauffman said something to the
effect that we should let him have
his way this time. Then, just
before the whole squad swung
passively behind the Coach, Dan
Lightfoot tried to swing the team
back to its original position. He
warned against bowing to Coach
Ralston when we thought our
grievances were justified.
Demea Washington followed
with a fiery answer to Ralston.
"As long as football players stay
lily-white, men like Ralston will
continue to coach. And I'm not
talking about skin color," he
shouted. "When ballplayers start
realizing they don't have to take
everything that comes down on
them, things are really gonna
change."

oration, Ralston stuck his head in
and shouted, "Two minutes!"
With that, everyone fied his
shoelaces and trudged out to
practice.
If only we had known what
had already taken place at Ohio
State, we probably wouldn't have
folded so easily. Ohio State Coach
Woody Hayes had taken his team
to the 1969 Rose Bowl and ran
what amounted to a military
camp while preparing for the

game. The sophomores on that
team were seniors now and
wanted no part of a repeat
performance when they came to
California this time.
I met several Ohio State
players during our trip to
Disneyland, and they told me that
all the seniors on the squad had
gone to Hayes with an ultimatum:
no two-a-day practices before the
game. When he heard that, Hayes
went a little crazy, he began
ranting and raving, but the players
knew they held the trump card
and refused to cave in. This time,
it was the coach who was forced
to compromise.
I'm repeating this story to
correct an illusion created by the
press before the Rose Bowl game.
It seems that Stanford's
reputation as the "Harvard of the
West" and Haves' reputation as a
hard-nosed martinet affected the
way both training camps were
covered.
According to the media, Ohio
State was holding rugged practice
sessions behind closed doors,
while the Stanford team was
taking it easy, treating the Rose
Bowl game as fun, just a way to
enjoy Christmas vacation. Woody
Hayes became the bad guy, and
easy-going John Ralston the good
guy-
It just wasn't so. In their
approach to college football, they
are both "bad guys."
Actually, it isn't all the coach's
fault. If he doesn't produce a
winner, he loses his job. An
unsettling prospect for a man like
Ralston with a wife and three
kids. I'm sure if the players had a
chance to know Ralston better
they would find him a very decent
guy, but he simply can't afford to
have that kind of relationship
with the team. Stanford must
average 40,000 paid spectators for
each home game to make money
with football. It's an economic
fact of life the coach has to live
with.
So football, which began as a
game run by students for
students, has, at several hundred
colleges and universities, been
wrested away from the players'
control. At Stanford, football is a
large and serious undertaking,
with eight full-time coaches, a
publicity man and numerous
other employees. The result is a
frantic coach and a squad of
understandably disgruntled
players.
These changing attitudes have
finally become obvious to the
coaches, and they are taking
precautions against a full-scale
â€¢rebellion. At least that's the case
at Stanford, which appears headed
for the ultimate bad-trip football
scene. They've begun recruiting
junior-college players in large
numbers. Most of these are
fellows who couldn't have gotten
into Stanford as freshmen, but
after two years at a junior college,
they can enter as juniors, with
two years of football eligibility
left.
Of course, things aren't all bad.
The other day, someone said that
college football must be fun at
some school.
I said, yes, it must be fun at
Pomona State. He said he'd never
heard of Pomona State.
That's why, I said, it must be
fun to play football there.

"Good-bye to ail that RAH,
RAH!" LOOK Magazine, October
5, 19 71 issue, by Tim McClure
with Jared Lebow, LOOK
Associate Sports Editor.
Reprinted with permission from
LOOK Magazine.
At this time last year, Tim
McClure was a defensive tackle on
the Stanford University football
team. A sinewy six-foot-two, he
was hardworking, intelligent and
aggressive. Everything a coach
could ash for. But something was
bothering him as he went through
the motions of blocking and
tackling in practice and in games.
"Playing football just wasn't
fun any more," he said, "and
when I sat down and thought
about it seriously, I realized that
at Stanford, it never had been
fun."
It bothered Tim that people
weren't seeing what they thought
they were seeing when they
watched a college football game,
that few realized how tightly
coaches controlled the lives of
their players or knew about the
drugs and the callous treatment of
injured athletes.

So he contacted LOOK and
asked us to help him tell his story.
"It appears to be accepted
doctrine that the coach must be a
tyrant," said McClure. "Merely
conditioning athletes is no longer
enough. Coaches feel they must
tell a player how to think. I went
through many changes in the last
four years, changes every college
student goes through.
Unfortunately, coaches don't like
to deal with change. It frightens
them. They don't seem to realize
that a real crisis faces them as
more and more athletes refuse to
become pawns in their silly games.
To survive, football will have to
undergo some radical changes. A
good beginning might be to give
control of the sport back to the
athletes. "
In high school, McClure had
been, in his words, "into
football." All that changed at
Stanford, where he found an
employee-employer relationship
between the staff and the team.
"It was strictly business. We really
didn't know the coaches, and they
really didn't know us except on
the most superficial level. "

Armed with a degree in
English, McClure was happy to
say goodbye to his four years of,
college foot jail last spring. This is
his farewell message:
Picture this: it's half time at
the 1971 Rose Bowl game,
Stanford versus Ohio State, and as
millions of football fans stare
blankly at their television sets, the
NCAA seal flashes across the
screen and the suddenly solemn
voice of Curt Gowdy reads the
following announcement: "Fie like
America's college athletes. Turn
on to sports, not to drugs."
Now let's switch to the
Stanford dressing room. Tired
young men in sweat-stained red
jerseys pull off their helmets and
collapse on wooden benches.
What's this? The pressure to win is
so great that some of the players,
without the coach's knowledge,
are removing little green capsules
from their lockers and popping
them into their mouths. Minutes
later, they begin to feel waves of
exhilaration. Their pupils dilate,

their eyes assume a saucer-like
shape. They are turning on.
But not to sports.
At Stanford, we called it
"beaning up," taking
amphetamines to get the heart
pumping faster and the body
functioning at an accelerated
pace. Most players swallow speed
out of self-defense, since the odds
are their opponents are also taking
the drug.
Last season, after the
University of California turned in
a particularly lackluster
performance against San Jose
State, a small-time football school
with big-time aspirations, I asked
a friend of mine on the Cal team
what happened. "Oh, it was
simple," he said. "We just ran out
of beans."
Sometimes even beans don't
help. Like when we were playing
Washington State in Spokane last
year and I wrecked my knee on
the artificial turf. Its boosters say
this kind of playing surface
reduces injuries, but that's not
what happened in my case. No
one hit me, I just slipped and
went flying, tearing ligaments and
cartilage. After that, I was just a
piece of broken machinery as far
as the coaching staff was
concerned. Not even my defensive

line coach stopped by the hospital
to say hello.
That was one of many reasons
1 was happy to graduate last June
and say good-bye to my four-year
career as a college football player.
But before I go into any more
details, let me set the record
straight. I'm no hippie-radical
dope-fiend-troublemaker. I was
just a guy trying to get a college
education who'd been misled.
You see, I always thought football
was a great game, and that games
were supposed to be for the
enjoyment of the athletes
involved. It didn't take me long to
discover that at the college level,
at least at those institutions in the
"major college football team"
category, football is not fun at all.
It is business, a very serious
business.
Well then, you may rightly ask,
if it was so horrible, how did a
bright young fellow like me get
sucked into it? For the answer, I
have to go back to my senior year

at Will C. Crawford High in San
Diego.
I was the ail-American kid,
captain of the football team, vice
president of the student body,
catcher on the baseball team. I
even dated the captain of the
cheerleader squad. It wasn't long
after my final high school game
that football recruiters from
various universities started
dropping by my home, buying me
steak dinners, inviting me on
all-expense-paid trips to their
campuses, when l they got me
dates and invitations to fraternity
parties. It was a pretty heady
experience for an 18-year-old boy.
But even then, naive as I was, I
began to suspect something was
wrong. Here were these
square-shouldered, close-cropped,
middle-aged men, clad in blue
blazers with their university's
insignia emblazoned on the
left-hand pocket, all trying to
convince me that the entire
athletic department and a sizable

portion of the student body were
desperately concerned that 1
choose their school.
One of the more unusual sales
pitches came from the Navy head
coach, Bill Elias. He was in San
Diego to visit some prospects and
invited me up to his hotel room.
My dad's a lieutenant
commander in the naval reserve,
and the idea of having a son at
Annapolis appealed to him, so he
came along.
There was Elias, sprawled
across a bed, elbow propped up
on a pillow, rapping about the
Academy's traditions, its
distinguished graduates and the
comradeship of the brigade of
midshipmen. Then, with a wry
smile, he informed us that getting
an appointment would be no
hassle since the athletic
department got those
appointments originally intended
for predominantly black
congressional districts. I guess
nobody gave a damn about
recruiting future black officers for
the Navy.
Anyway, I finally ended up at
Stanford, signing what was in
effect a four-year contract. I'd
play ball, and they'd give me
room, board, a little spending
money and, oh yes, a college
education.
I chose Stanford for a variety
of reasons. It's a prestige school,
one of the best in the nation, with
a strong academic program that
gives students the opportunity to
spend their junior year in Europe.
Later on I learned the football
coaches, who bragged about this
program when recruiting players,
weren't happy when players took
advantage of it, especially if spring
practice or, even worse, the
football season was missed.
In fact, the coaches had very
little concern with academics.
Football players are at Stanford
to play football. If they get an
education in the time that's left
over, fine. If not, well, they had
the chance, didn't they?
We reported for practice in
mid-August last year, a week
earlier than usual because an extra
game had been added to our
schedule. Costs had gone up, and
a new source of revenue had to be
found to balance the books. An
eleventh regular-season game was
that source. At first there was a
tinge of excitement, because we
were going to play Arkansas on
national television and it was a
chance to catapult Stanford into
the Top Ten. But once the
two-a-day practice sessions began,
that glow quickly wore off.
This was weeks before classes
started, and we were spending
about seven hours a day
practicing. Before it all began,
Head Coach John Ralston gave us
a little speech about how this was
the year Stanford was going to the
Rose Bowl and about how the
coaching staff was going to break
down our minds and bodies and
rebuild us.
Coach Ralston just loved little
homilies like that. Give him half a
chance, and he'd launch into his
"pain is a blessing because it keeps
players awake and alert" speech.

Let him catch a player easing
aching muscles in a whirlpool bath
and out came, "You can't make
the club in the tub." If a practice
session were being filmed, he'd
walk around saying, "You can't
get away from the eye in the
sky."
Sure it was all kind of funny,
but the thing was Ralston was
absolutely serious. He really
believed what he was saying.
At the gym entrance there's a
display of ex-Stanford greats now
in pro football. Each picture is a
testament to the coach's program,
implying that you, too, can be
like these famous pros if you just
follow our simple four-year,
knuckle-down planâ€”the unstated,
but implicit message being that
the ultimate goal of any college
athlete should be a career as a
professional athlete.
One of the Coach's major
concerns was hair. He hated it.
When Terrell Smith, an offensive
guard, showed up with a beard

and long locks, Ralston went into
his annual shape-up-or-get-out
tantrum. You can always tell the
football players at Stanford.
They're the guys with short hair.
This does wonders in further
segregating us from the rest of the
student body, many of whom
think we're dolts anyway. When
one of the football players, Steve
Jubb, hurt his ankle playing rugby
in the off season, the footbail
trainer refused to treat him
because he'd let his hair grow too
long, so he had to drag his
throbbing ankle to the barber
before he could get it taped by
the trainer.
This concern with hair is just a
part of Coach Ralston's effort to
control how his players look and
think. His attempts at
indoctrination reached absurd
heights before the Arkansas game,
when he hired a troop of
professional incentive builders to
psych us up for the season opener.
It was absurd because he'd
tried the same thing and failed
before the previous season's
Southern Cal game. Actually, we
all kind of look forward to the
USC match. Many players on both
teams went to high school in
Southern California and knew
each other off the field. USC
always has one of the nation's
strongest teams, and it's enjoyable
to play against the best. Besides,
the game is a sellout, and each
player is usually able to scalp his
four free tickets for about a
hundred dollars.
Anyway, we were all herded
into a meeting room and faced

with a fellow in a business suit,
surrounded by charts.
"What kind of cow are you?"
he shouts. "Are you a praise cow?
I'm a praise cow. I want people to
give me praise; that's why I work
hard. Now, if you work hard,
you're going to get praise from all
your friends for beating USC."
Well, right there, the meeting
started going downhill. Guys were
laughing at him, and he began
getting desperate. Finally, he just
lost control and started doing an
imitation of Daffy Duck, like he
was Daffy Duck on a TV show
before he became an incentive
builder.
To be honest, he did a pretty
good Daffy Duck, but we lost to
USC anyway.
Not one to admit defeat,
Ralston invited a different crew of
pitchmen to build us up for the
Arkansas game. He introduced the
main speaker and mentioned that
after a single session, such as the
one we were about to experience,
sales usually shot up 12 percent.
Maybe we were supposed to sell
our kneepads to the Arkansas
players.
"Who's going to win
Saturday?" shouted Mr. Incentive.
Dead silence. It was one o'clock,
hot and right in the middle of
two-a-day practices. When he
realized there would be no pep
rally, he changed tactics by
passing out blank cards and asking
us to write down what Coach
Ralston would say after the game.
He handed one to linebacker
Dennis Moore, and Dennis
dropped it. He tried to give
Dennis a second card but was
fixed with such a blood-chilling
stare that he stumbled back to the
platform. In a last-ditch effort, he
called on our All America
quarterback, a guy who was to
win the Heisman Trophy, to stand
as an example of one who had
overcome hardships to achieve
success. Not a bad idea, except he
introduced him as Jerry Plunkett.
Even Jim, a straight arrow liked
by both players and coaches,
broke up.
The first signs of rebellion
appeared when two of my
teammates, Jim Kauffman and
Dan Lightfoot, paid a visit to
Athletic Director Chuck Taylor.
The feeling was that if the players
had to report back early for an
extra game to make the athletic
department extra money, they
should get something in return.
The demands were trivialâ€”clean
athletic supporters and socks for
every practice, free blazers for our
road trips and a stop in Las Vegas
on the way back from Arkansas.

After much haggling, the demands
were met.
Well, we beat Arkansas, San
Jose State and Oregon before
losing to Purdue. Then we upset
USC, and flew up to Spokane to
play Washington State. It was a
pleasant afternoon for the
teamâ€”Stanford won 63-16â€”but a
painful one for me, because it was
that day my left knee was
wrecked.
I was still in the hospital when
Stanford won its next three
conference games before losing to
a non-conference opponent, the
Air Force Academy. The game
wasn't very important, and
Charles Saibel, one of our guards,
dropped by to say he was kind of
glad we lost, because Air Force
wanted to win so badly and it
made them so happy when they
did.
All in all, the season was a huge
success for the coaches. We
finished with an 8-3 record, won
the Pacific Coast Conference title
and received Stanford's first Rose
Bowl invitation in 19 years. When
we had our annual end-of-season
banquet following the Cal game,
everyone was in a good mood.
Coach Ralston needed only a few
minutes to shatter it.
As in the past, we all gathered
in a Cantonese restaurant, ate all
we could hold, kidded around and
in general relaxed after four
months of hard work.
Dinner completed, Bob
Murphy, the sports publicity
director, introduced Coach
Ralston as the West Coast Coach
of the Year and candidate for
national coach of the year.
Ralston thanked Murphy and then
declared he had little chance to
win the latter award with our 8-3
record since Bob Devaney of
Nebraska was 10-0 and Darrel
Royal of Texas was undefeated
and Ara Parseghian had lost only
one. Then he began berating us
for the two late-season losses to
Air Force and California. By now,
we had braced ourselves for a
most unpleasant evening.
After condemning us for those
losses, Ralston dismissed the past
11 games and launched into an
account of what the future held.
There would be 20 days of
practice in preparation for the
Rose Bowl, including six days of
two-a-day workouts during our
Christmas vacations. Bitterly, he
added there were rumors about
our being unhappy with two-a-day
workouts and that this disgusted
him.
We began practice two days
before finals' week. Since football
takes from four to five hours a
day during the regular season,
most of the players felt this
climactic imposition was a bit
much. Because of it, many found
themselves in academic trouble.
We arrived in Pasadena on
December 22, and a strict 10:30
p.m. curfew was imposed. A fleet
of fancy cars provided for our use
never left their parking spaces.
Other than a visit to Disneyland
and an awards banquet, we had to
spend our free time between
practice sessions viewing football
films of ourselves and Ohio State.
After five days of this, Dan
Lightfoot, an offensive guard, and
I called a meeting to discuss our
grievances. Thirty-five members of
the 50-man squad showed up; the

Unfortunately, coaches don't like
to deal with change. It frightens
them. They don't seem to realize
that a real crisis faces them as
more and more athletes refuse to
become pawns in their silly games.
To survive, football will have to
undergo some radical changes. A
good beginning might be to give
control of the sport back to the
athletes. "
In high school, McClure had
been, in his words, "into
football." All that changed at
Stanford, where he found an
employee-employer relationship
between the staff and the team.
"It was strictly business. We really
didn't know the coaches, and they
really didn't know us except on
the most superficial level. "

Armed with a degree in
English, McClure was happy to
say goodbye to his four years of,
college foot jail last spring. This is
his farewell message:
Picture this: it's half time at
the 1971 Rose Bowl game,
Stanford versus Ohio State, and as
millions of football fans stare
blankly at their television sets, the
NCAA seal flashes across the
screen and the suddenly solemn
voice of Curt Gowdy reads the
following announcement: "Fie like
America's college athletes. Turn
on to sports, not to drugs."
Now let's switch to the
Stanford dressing room. Tired
young men in sweat-stained red
jerseys pull off their helmets and
collapse on wooden benches.
What's this? The pressure to win is
so great that some of the players,
without the coach's knowledge,
are removing little green capsules
from their lockers and popping
them into their mouths. Minutes
later, they begin to feel waves of
exhilaration. Their pupils dilate,

their eyes assume a saucer-like
shape. They are turning on.
But not to sports.
At Stanford, we called it
"beaning up," taking
amphetamines to get the heart
pumping faster and the body
functioning at an accelerated
pace. Most players swallow speed
out of self-defense, since the odds
are their opponents are also taking
the drug.
Last season, after the
University of California turned in
a particularly lackluster
performance against San Jose
State, a small-time football school
with big-time aspirations, I asked
a friend of mine on the Cal team
what happened. "Oh, it was
simple," he said. "We just ran out
of beans."
Sometimes even beans don't
help. Like when we were playing
Washington State in Spokane last
year and I wrecked my knee on
the artificial turf. Its boosters say
this kind of playing surface
reduces injuries, but that's not
what happened in my case. No
one hit me, I just slipped and
went flying, tearing ligaments and
cartilage. After that, I was just a
piece of broken machinery as far
as the coaching staff was
concerned. Not even my defensive

line coach stopped by the hospital
to say hello.
That was one of many reasons
1 was happy to graduate last June
and say good-bye to my four-year
career as a college football player.
But before I go into any more
details, let me set the record
straight. I'm no hippie-radical
dope-fiend-troublemaker. I was
just a guy trying to get a college
education who'd been misled.
You see, I always thought football
was a great game, and that games
were supposed to be for the
enjoyment of the athletes
involved. It didn't take me long to
discover that at the college level,
at least at those institutions in the
"major college football team"
category, football is not fun at all.
It is business, a very serious
business.
Well then, you may rightly ask,
if it was so horrible, how did a
bright young fellow like me get
sucked into it? For the answer, I
have to go back to my senior year

at Will C. Crawford High in San
Diego.
I was the ail-American kid,
captain of the football team, vice
president of the student body,
catcher on the baseball team. I
even dated the captain of the
cheerleader squad. It wasn't long
after my final high school game
that football recruiters from
various universities started
dropping by my home, buying me
steak dinners, inviting me on
all-expense-paid trips to their
campuses, when l they got me
dates and invitations to fraternity
parties. It was a pretty heady
experience for an 18-year-old boy.
But even then, naive as I was, I
began to suspect something was
wrong. Here were these
square-shouldered, close-cropped,
middle-aged men, clad in blue
blazers with their university's
insignia emblazoned on the
left-hand pocket, all trying to
convince me that the entire
athletic department and a sizable

portion of the student body were
desperately concerned that 1
choose their school.
One of the more unusual sales
pitches came from the Navy head
coach, Bill Elias. He was in San
Diego to visit some prospects and
invited me up to his hotel room.
My dad's a lieutenant
commander in the naval reserve,
and the idea of having a son at
Annapolis appealed to him, so he
came along.
There was Elias, sprawled
across a bed, elbow propped up
on a pillow, rapping about the
Academy's traditions, its
distinguished graduates and the
comradeship of the brigade of
midshipmen. Then, with a wry
smile, he informed us that getting
an appointment would be no
hassle since the athletic
department got those
appointments originally intended
for predominantly black
congressional districts. I guess
nobody gave a damn about
recruiting future black officers for
the Navy.
Anyway, I finally ended up at
Stanford, signing what was in
effect a four-year contract. I'd
play ball, and they'd give me
room, board, a little spending
money and, oh yes, a college
education.
I chose Stanford for a variety
of reasons. It's a prestige school,
one of the best in the nation, with
a strong academic program that
gives students the opportunity to
spend their junior year in Europe.
Later on I learned the football
coaches, who bragged about this
program when recruiting players,
weren't happy when players took
advantage of it, especially if spring
practice or, even worse, the
football season was missed.
In fact, the coaches had very
little concern with academics.
Football players are at Stanford
to play football. If they get an
education in the time that's left
over, fine. If not, well, they had
the chance, didn't they?
We reported for practice in
mid-August last year, a week
earlier than usual because an extra
game had been added to our
schedule. Costs had gone up, and
a new source of revenue had to be
found to balance the books. An
eleventh regular-season game was
that source. At first there was a
tinge of excitement, because we
were going to play Arkansas on
national television and it was a
chance to catapult Stanford into
the Top Ten. But once the
two-a-day practice sessions began,
that glow quickly wore off.
This was weeks before classes
started, and we were spending
about seven hours a day
practicing. Before it all began,
Head Coach John Ralston gave us
a little speech about how this was
the year Stanford was going to the
Rose Bowl and about how the
coaching staff was going to break
down our minds and bodies and
rebuild us.
Coach Ralston just loved little
homilies like that. Give him half a
chance, and he'd launch into his
"pain is a blessing because it keeps
players awake and alert" speech.

Let him catch a player easing
aching muscles in a whirlpool bath
and out came, "You can't make
the club in the tub." If a practice
session were being filmed, he'd
walk around saying, "You can't
get away from the eye in the
sky."
Sure it was all kind of funny,
but the thing was Ralston was
absolutely serious. He really
believed what he was saying.
At the gym entrance there's a
display of ex-Stanford greats now
in pro football. Each picture is a
testament to the coach's program,
implying that you, too, can be
like these famous pros if you just
follow our simple four-year,
knuckle-down planâ€”the unstated,
but implicit message being that
the ultimate goal of any college
athlete should be a career as a
professional athlete.
One of the Coach's major
concerns was hair. He hated it.
When Terrell Smith, an offensive
guard, showed up with a beard

and long locks, Ralston went into
his annual shape-up-or-get-out
tantrum. You can always tell the
football players at Stanford.
They're the guys with short hair.
This does wonders in further
segregating us from the rest of the
student body, many of whom
think we're dolts anyway. When
one of the football players, Steve
Jubb, hurt his ankle playing rugby
in the off season, the footbail
trainer refused to treat him
because he'd let his hair grow too
long, so he had to drag his
throbbing ankle to the barber
before he could get it taped by
the trainer.
This concern with hair is just a
part of Coach Ralston's effort to
control how his players look and
think. His attempts at
indoctrination reached absurd
heights before the Arkansas game,
when he hired a troop of
professional incentive builders to
psych us up for the season opener.
It was absurd because he'd
tried the same thing and failed
before the previous season's
Southern Cal game. Actually, we
all kind of look forward to the
USC match. Many players on both
teams went to high school in
Southern California and knew
each other off the field. USC
always has one of the nation's
strongest teams, and it's enjoyable
to play against the best. Besides,
the game is a sellout, and each
player is usually able to scalp his
four free tickets for about a
hundred dollars.
Anyway, we were all herded
into a meeting room and faced

with a fellow in a business suit,
surrounded by charts.
"What kind of cow are you?"
he shouts. "Are you a praise cow?
I'm a praise cow. I want people to
give me praise; that's why I work
hard. Now, if you work hard,
you're going to get praise from all
your friends for beating USC."
Well, right there, the meeting
started going downhill. Guys were
laughing at him, and he began
getting desperate. Finally, he just
lost control and started doing an
imitation of Daffy Duck, like he
was Daffy Duck on a TV show
before he became an incentive
builder.
To be honest, he did a pretty
good Daffy Duck, but we lost to
USC anyway.
Not one to admit defeat,
Ralston invited a different crew of
pitchmen to build us up for the
Arkansas game. He introduced the
main speaker and mentioned that
after a single session, such as the
one we were about to experience,
sales usually shot up 12 percent.
Maybe we were supposed to sell
our kneepads to the Arkansas
players.
"Who's going to win
Saturday?" shouted Mr. Incentive.
Dead silence. It was one o'clock,
hot and right in the middle of
two-a-day practices. When he
realized there would be no pep
rally, he changed tactics by
passing out blank cards and asking
us to write down what Coach
Ralston would say after the game.
He handed one to linebacker
Dennis Moore, and Dennis
dropped it. He tried to give
Dennis a second card but was
fixed with such a blood-chilling
stare that he stumbled back to the
platform. In a last-ditch effort, he
called on our All America
quarterback, a guy who was to
win the Heisman Trophy, to stand
as an example of one who had
overcome hardships to achieve
success. Not a bad idea, except he
introduced him as Jerry Plunkett.
Even Jim, a straight arrow liked
by both players and coaches,
broke up.
The first signs of rebellion
appeared when two of my
teammates, Jim Kauffman and
Dan Lightfoot, paid a visit to
Athletic Director Chuck Taylor.
The feeling was that if the players
had to report back early for an
extra game to make the athletic
department extra money, they
should get something in return.
The demands were trivialâ€”clean
athletic supporters and socks for
every practice, free blazers for our
road trips and a stop in Las Vegas
on the way back from Arkansas.

After much haggling, the demands
were met.
Well, we beat Arkansas, San
Jose State and Oregon before
losing to Purdue. Then we upset
USC, and flew up to Spokane to
play Washington State. It was a
pleasant afternoon for the
teamâ€”Stanford won 63-16â€”but a
painful one for me, because it was
that day my left knee was
wrecked.
I was still in the hospital when
Stanford won its next three
conference games before losing to
a non-conference opponent, the
Air Force Academy. The game
wasn't very important, and
Charles Saibel, one of our guards,
dropped by to say he was kind of
glad we lost, because Air Force
wanted to win so badly and it
made them so happy when they
did.
All in all, the season was a huge
success for the coaches. We
finished with an 8-3 record, won
the Pacific Coast Conference title
and received Stanford's first Rose
Bowl invitation in 19 years. When
we had our annual end-of-season
banquet following the Cal game,
everyone was in a good mood.
Coach Ralston needed only a few
minutes to shatter it.
As in the past, we all gathered
in a Cantonese restaurant, ate all
we could hold, kidded around and
in general relaxed after four
months of hard work.
Dinner completed, Bob
Murphy, the sports publicity
director, introduced Coach
Ralston as the West Coast Coach
of the Year and candidate for
national coach of the year.
Ralston thanked Murphy and then
declared he had little chance to
win the latter award with our 8-3
record since Bob Devaney of
Nebraska was 10-0 and Darrel
Royal of Texas was undefeated
and Ara Parseghian had lost only
one. Then he began berating us
for the two late-season losses to
Air Force and California. By now,
we had braced ourselves for a
most unpleasant evening.
After condemning us for those
losses, Ralston dismissed the past
11 games and launched into an
account of what the future held.
There would be 20 days of
practice in preparation for the
Rose Bowl, including six days of
two-a-day workouts during our
Christmas vacations. Bitterly, he
added there were rumors about
our being unhappy with two-a-day
workouts and that this disgusted
him.
We began practice two days
before finals' week. Since football
takes from four to five hours a
day during the regular season,
most of the players felt this
climactic imposition was a bit
much. Because of it, many found
themselves in academic trouble.
We arrived in Pasadena on
December 22, and a strict 10:30
p.m. curfew was imposed. A fleet
of fancy cars provided for our use
never left their parking spaces.
Other than a visit to Disneyland
and an awards banquet, we had to
spend our free time between
practice sessions viewing football
films of ourselves and Ohio State.
After five days of this, Dan
Lightfoot, an offensive guard, and
I called a meeting to discuss our
grievances. Thirty-five members of
the 50-man squad showed up; the
rest had failed to hear about the
meeting. All present, except
co-captains Jack Shultz and
Plunkett, felt two practice
sessions a day was one too many
and that the curfew was too early.
Demea Washington, split end,
suggested sending a delegation to

Ralston to urge an end to daily
double-practice sessions.
So Demea, Ron Kadziel, a
linebacker, and Schultz and
Plunkett were chosen to visit
Ralston's suite. Sending the
captains along was a bad decision.
Throughout the season both had
been Ralston's strongest
supporters. Although sincere in
offering to communicate the
team's grievances, they found it
an impossible task because neither

one could understand why any
player would contradict his coach
in the first place.
Sensing the outcome, Demea
spoke up. He told Ralston of the
team's dissatisfaction, and the
Coach promised a conciliatory
message the next morning.
Before his talk, we held
another meeting. By this time,
sentiment was running high in
favor of refusing to practice if our
complaints weren't taken into
account. We decided to hear
Ralston out, then, depending on
his message, plan a course of
action.
A master of the emotional
appeal, Ralston managed to abort
our rebellion without losing a
minute of practice time. He
simply threatened to resign if he
couldn't have complete control of
the team. We just caved in.
He made a short, but very
effective, speech and then left the
locker room. For several minutes
we sat in silence, until Jim
Kauffman said something to the
effect that we should let him have
his way this time. Then, just
before the whole squad swung
passively behind the Coach, Dan
Lightfoot tried to swing the team
back to its original position. He
warned against bowing to Coach
Ralston when we thought our
grievances were justified.
Demea Washington followed
with a fiery answer to Ralston.
"As long as football players stay
lily-white, men like Ralston will
continue to coach. And I'm not
talking about skin color," he
shouted. "When ballplayers start
realizing they don't have to take
everything that comes down on
them, things are really gonna
change."
Seconds after Demea's fierv

oration, Ralston stuck his head in
and shouted, "Two minutes!"
With that, everyone fied his
shoelaces and trudged out to
practice.
If only we had known what
had already taken place at Ohio
State, we probably wouldn't have
folded so easily. Ohio State Coach
Woody Hayes had taken his team
to the 1969 Rose Bowl and ran
what amounted to a military
camp while preparing for the

game. The sophomores on that
team were seniors now and
wanted no part of a repeat
performance when they came to
California this time.
I met several Ohio State
players during our trip to
Disneyland, and they told me that
all the seniors on the squad had
gone to Hayes with an ultimatum:
no two-a-day practices before the
game. When he heard that, Hayes
went a little crazy, he began
ranting and raving, but the players
knew they held the trump card
and refused to cave in. This time,
it was the coach who was forced
to compromise.
I'm repeating this story to
correct an illusion created by the
press before the Rose Bowl game.
It seems that Stanford's
reputation as the "Harvard of the
West" and Haves' reputation as a
hard-nosed martinet affected the
way both training camps were
covered.
According to the media, Ohio
State was holding rugged practice
sessions behind closed doors,
while the Stanford team was
taking it easy, treating the Rose
Bowl game as fun, just a way to
enjoy Christmas vacation. Woody
Hayes became the bad guy, and
easy-going John Ralston the good
guy-
It just wasn't so. In their
approach to college football, they
are both "bad guys."
Actually, it isn't all the coach's
fault. If he doesn't produce a
winner, he loses his job. An
unsettling prospect for a man like
Ralston with a wife and three
kids. I'm sure if the players had a
chance to know Ralston better
they would find him a very decent
guy, but he simply can't afford to
have that kind of relationship
with the team. Stanford must
average 40,000 paid spectators for
each home game to make money
with football. It's an economic
fact of life the coach has to live
with.
So football, which began as a
game run by students for
students, has, at several hundred
colleges and universities, been
wrested away from the players'
control. At Stanford, football is a
large and serious undertaking,
with eight full-time coaches, a
publicity man and numerous
other employees. The result is a
frantic coach and a squad of
understandably disgruntled
players.
These changing attitudes have
finally become obvious to the
coaches, and they are taking
precautions against a full-scale
â€¢rebellion. At least that's the case
at Stanford, which appears headed
for the ultimate bad-trip football
scene. They've begun recruiting
junior-college players in large
numbers. Most of these are
fellows who couldn't have gotten
into Stanford as freshmen, but
after two years at a junior college,
they can enter as juniors, with
two years of football eligibility
left.
Of course, things aren't all bad.
The other day, someone said that
college football must be fun at
some school.
I said, yes, it must be fun at
Pomona State. He said he'd never
heard of Pomona State.
That's why, I said, it must be
fun to play football there.


Okay guys this
is a tough one. lets
all swallow hard
and try to win one
for the pus her.

"Good-bye to ail that RAH,
RAH!" LOOK Magazine, October
5, 19 71 issue, by Tim McClure
with Jared Lebow, LOOK
Associate Sports Editor.
Reprinted with permission from
LOOK Magazine.
At this time last year, Tim
McClure was a defensive tackle on
the Stanford University football
team. A sinewy six-foot-two, he
was hardworking, intelligent and
aggressive. Everything a coach
could ash for. But something was
bothering him as he went through
the motions of blocking and
tackling in practice and in games.
"Playing football just wasn't
fun any more," he said, "and
when I sat down and thought
about it seriously, I realized that
at Stanford, it never had been
fun."
It bothered Tim that people
weren't seeing what they thought
they were seeing when they
watched a college football game,
that few realized how tightly
coaches controlled the lives of
their players or knew about the
drugs and the callous treatment of
injured athletes.

So he contacted LOOK and
asked us to help him tell his story.
"It appears to be accepted
doctrine that the coach must be a
tyrant," said McClure. "Merely
conditioning athletes is no longer
enough. Coaches feel they must
tell a player how to think. I went
through many changes in the last
four years, changes every college
student goes through.
Unfortunately, coaches don't like
to deal with change. It frightens
them. They don't seem to realize
that a real crisis faces them as
more and more athletes refuse to
become pawns in their silly games.
To survive, football will have to
undergo some radical changes. A
good beginning might be to give

In high school, McClure had

"It was strictly business. We really

like these famous pros if you just
follow our simple four-year,
knuckle-down planâ€”the unstated,
but implicit message being that
the ultimate goal of any college
athlete should be a career as a
professional athlete.
One of the Coach's major
concerns was hair. He hated it.
When Terrell Smith, an offensive
guard, showed up with a beard

and long locks, Ralston went into
his annual shape-up-or-get-out
tantrum. You can always tell the
football players at Stanford.
They're the guys with short hair.
This does wonders in further
segregating us from the rest of the
student body, many of whom
think we're dolts anyway. When
one of the football players, Steve
Jubb, hurt his ankle playing rugby
in the off season, the footbail
trainer refused to treat him
because he'd let his hair grow too
long, so he had to drag his
throbbing ankle to the barber
before he could get it taped by
the trainer.
This concern with hair is just a
part of Coach Ralston's effort to
control how his players look and
think. His attempts at
indoctrination reached absurd
heights before the Arkansas game,
when he hired a troop of
professional incentive builders to
psych us up for the season opener.
It was absurd because he'd
tried the same thing and failed
before the previous season's
Southern Cal game. Actually, we
all kind of look forward to the
USC match. Many players on both
teams went to high school in
Southern California and knew
each other off the field. USC
always has one of the nation's
strongest teams, and it's enjoyable
to play against the best. Besides,
the game is a sellout, and each
player is usually able to scalp his
four free tickets for about a
hundred dollars.
Anyway, we were all herded
into a meeting room and faced

with a fellow in a business suit,
surrounded by charts.
"What kind of cow are you?"
he shouts. "Are you a praise cow?
I'm a praise cow. I want people to
give me praise; that's why I work
hard. Now, if you work hard,
you're going to get praise from all
your friends for beating USC."
Well, right there, the meeting
started going downhill. Guys were
laughing at him, and he began
getting desperate. Finally, he just
lost control and started doing an
imitation of Daffy Duck, like he
was Daffy Duck on a TV show
before he became an incentive
builder.
To be honest, he did a pretty
good Daffy Duck, but we lost to
USC anyway.
Not one to admit defeat,
Ralston invited a different crew of
pitchmen to build us up for the
Arkansas game. He introduced the
main speaker and mentioned that
after a single session, such as the
one we were about to experience,
sales usually shot up 12 percent.
Maybe we were supposed to sell
our kneepads to the Arkansas
players.
"Who's going to win
Saturday?" shouted Mr. Incentive.
Dead silence. It was one o'clock,
hot and right in the middle of
two-a-day practices. When he
realized there would be no pep
rally, he changed tactics by
passing out blank cards and asking
us to write down what Coach
Ralston would say after the game.
He handed one to linebacker
Dennis Moore, and Dennis
dropped it. He tried to give
Dennis a second card but was
fixed with such a blood-chilling
stare that he stumbled back to the
platform. In a last-ditch effort, he
called on our All America
quarterback, a guy who was to
win the Heisman Trophy, to stand
as an example of one who had
overcome hardships to achieve
success. Not a bad idea, except he
introduced him as Jerry Plunkett.
Even Jim, a straight arrow liked
by both players and coaches,
broke up.
The first signs of rebellion
appeared when two of my
teammates, Jim Kauffman and
Dan Lightfoot, paid a visit to
Athletic Director Chuck Taylor.
The feeling was that if the players
had to report back early for an
extra game to make the athletic
department extra money, they
should get something in return.
The demands were trivialâ€”clean
athletic supporters and socks for
every practice, free blazers for our
road trips and a stop in Las Vegas
on the way back from Arkansas.

After much haggling, the demands
were met.
Well, we beat Arkansas, San
Jose State and Oregon before
losing to Purdue. Then we upset
USC, and flew up to Spokane to
play Washington State. It was a
pleasant afternoon for the
teamâ€”Stanford won 63-16â€”but a
painful one for me, because it was
that day my left knee was
wrecked.
I was still in the hospital when
Stanford won its next three
conference games before losing to
a non-conference opponent, the
Air Force Academy. The game
wasn't very important, and
Charles Saibel, one of our guards,
dropped by to say he was kind of
glad we lost, because Air Force
wanted to win so badly and it
made them so happy when they
did.
All in all, the season was a huge
success for the coaches. We
finished with an 8-3 record, won
the Pacific Coast Conference title
and received Stanford's first Rose
Bowl invitation in 19 years. When
we had our annual end-of-season
banquet following the Cal game,
everyone was in a good mood.
Coach Ralston needed only a few
minutes to shatter it.
As in the past, we all gathered
in a Cantonese restaurant, ate all
we could hold, kidded around and
in general relaxed after four
months of hard work.
Dinner completed, Bob
Murphy, the sports publicity
director, introduced Coach
Ralston as the West Coast Coach
of the Year and candidate for
national coach of the year.
Ralston thanked Murphy and then
declared he had little chance to
win the latter award with our 8-3
record since Bob Devaney of
Nebraska was 10-0 and Darrel
Royal of Texas was undefeated
and Ara Parseghian had lost only
one. Then he began berating us
for the two late-season losses to
Air Force and California. By now,
we had braced ourselves for a
most unpleasant evening.
After condemning us for those
losses, Ralston dismissed the past
11 games and launched into an
account of what the future held.
There would be 20 days of
practice in preparation for the
Rose Bowl, including six days of
two-a-day workouts during our
Christmas vacations. Bitterly, he
added there were rumors about
our being unhappy with two-a-day
workouts and that this disgusted
him.
We began practice two days
before finals' week. Since football
takes from four to five hours a
day during the regular season,
most of the players felt this
climactic imposition was a bit
much. Because of it, many found
themselves in academic trouble.
We arrived in Pasadena on
December 22, and a strict 10:30
p.m. curfew was imposed. A fleet
of fancy cars provided for our use
never left their parking spaces.
Other than a visit to Disneyland
and an awards banquet, we had to
spend our free time between
practice sessions viewing football
films of ourselves and Ohio State.
After five days of this, Dan
Lightfoot, an offensive guard, and
I called a meeting to discuss our
grievances. Thirty-five members of
the 50-man squad showed up; the
rest had failed to hear about the
meeting. All present, except
co-captains Jack Shultz and
Plunkett, felt two practice
sessions a day was one too many
and that the curfew was too early.
Demea Washington, split end,
suggested sending a delegation to

Ralston to urge an end to daily
double-practice sessions.
So Demea, Ron Kadziel, a
linebacker, and Schultz and
Plunkett were chosen to visit
Ralston's suite. Sending the
captains along was a bad decision.
Throughout the season both had
been Ralston's strongest
supporters. Although sincere in
offering to communicate the
team's grievances, they found it
an impossible task because neither

one could understand why any
player would contradict his coach
in the first place.
Sensing the outcome, Demea
spoke up. He told Ralston of the
team's dissatisfaction, and the
Coach promised a conciliatory
message the next morning.
Before his talk, we held
another meeting. By this time,
sentiment was running high in
favor of refusing to practice if our
complaints weren't taken into
account. We decided to hear
Ralston out, then, depending on
his message, plan a course of
action.
A master of the emotional
appeal, Ralston managed to abort
our rebellion without losing a
minute of practice time. He
simply threatened to resign if he
couldn't have complete control of
the team. We just caved in.
He made a short, but very
effective, speech and then left the
locker room. For several minutes
we sat in silence, until Jim
Kauffman said something to the
effect that we should let him have
his way this time. Then, just
before the whole squad swung
passively behind the Coach, Dan
Lightfoot tried to swing the team
back to its original position. He
warned against bowing to Coach
Ralston when we thought our
grievances were justified.
Demea Washington followed
with a fiery answer to Ralston.
"As long as football players stay
lily-white, men like Ralston will
continue to coach. And I'm not
talking about skin color," he
shouted. "When ballplayers start
realizing they don't have to take
everything that comes down on
them, things are really gonna
change."
Seconds after Demea's fierv

oration, Ralston stuck his head in
and shouted, "Two minutes!"
With that, everyone fied his
shoelaces and trudged out to
practice.
If only we had known what
had already taken place at Ohio
State, we probably wouldn't have
folded so easily. Ohio State Coach
Woody Hayes had taken his team
to the 1969 Rose Bowl and ran
what amounted to a military
camp while preparing for the

game. The sophomores on that
team were seniors now and
wanted no part of a repeat
performance when they came to
California this time.
I met several Ohio State
players during our trip to
Disneyland, and they told me that
all the seniors on the squad had
gone to Hayes with an ultimatum:
no two-a-day practices before the
game. When he heard that, Hayes
went a little crazy, he began
ranting and raving, but the players
knew they held the trump card
and refused to cave in. This time,
it was the coach who was forced
to compromise.
I'm repeating this story to
correct an illusion created by the
press before the Rose Bowl game.
It seems that Stanford's
reputation as the "Harvard of the
West" and Haves' reputation as a
hard-nosed martinet affected the
way both training camps were
covered.
According to the media, Ohio
State was holding rugged practice
sessions behind closed doors,
while the Stanford team was
taking it easy, treating the Rose
Bowl game as fun, just a way to
enjoy Christmas vacation. Woody
Hayes became the bad guy, and
easy-going John Ralston the good
guy-
It just wasn't so. In their
approach to college football, they
are both "bad guys."
Actually, it isn't all the coach's
fault. If he doesn't produce a
winner, he loses his job. An
unsettling prospect for a man like
Ralston with a wife and three
kids. I'm sure if the players had a
chance to know Ralston better
they would find him a very decent
guy, but he simply can't afford to
have that kind of relationship
with the team. Stanford must
average 40,000 paid spectators for
each home game to make money
with football. It's an economic
fact of life the coach has to live
with.
So football, which began as a
game run by students for
students, has, at several hundred
colleges and universities, been
wrested away from the players'
control. At Stanford, football is a
large and serious undertaking,
with eight full-time coaches, a
publicity man and numerous
other employees. The result is a
frantic coach and a squad of
understandably disgruntled
players.
These changing attitudes have
finally become obvious to the
coaches, and they are taking
precautions against a full-scale
â€¢rebellion. At least that's the case
at Stanford, which appears headed
for the ultimate bad-trip football
scene. They've begun recruiting
junior-college players in large
numbers. Most of these are
fellows who couldn't have gotten
into Stanford as freshmen, but
after two years at a junior college,
they can enter as juniors, with
two years of football eligibility
left.
Of course, things aren't all bad.
The other day, someone said that
college football must be fun at
some school.
I said, yes, it must be fun at
Pomona State. He said he'd never
heard of Pomona State.
That's why, I said, it must be
fun to play football there.


Okay guys this
is a tough one. lets
all swallow hard
and try to win one
for the pus her.

"Good-bye to ail that RAH,
RAH!" LOOK Magazine, October
5, 19 71 issue, by Tim McClure
with Jared Lebow, LOOK
Associate Sports Editor.
Reprinted with permission from
LOOK Magazine.
At this time last year, Tim
McClure was a defensive tackle on
the Stanford University football
team. A sinewy six-foot-two, he
was hardworking, intelligent and
aggressive. Everything a coach
could ash for. But something was
bothering him as he went through
the motions of blocking and
tackling in practice and in games.
"Playing football just wasn't
fun any more," he said, "and
when I sat down and thought
about it seriously, I realized that
at Stanford, it never had been
fun."
It bothered Tim that people
weren't seeing what they thought
they were seeing when they
watched a college football game,
that few realized how tightly
coaches controlled the lives of
their players or knew about the
drugs and the callous treatment of
injured athletes.

So he contacted LOOK and
asked us to help him tell his story.
"It appears to be accepted
doctrine that the coach must be a
tyrant," said McClure. "Merely
conditioning athletes is no longer
enough. Coaches feel they must
tell a player how to think. I went
through many changes in the last
four years, changes every college
student goes through.
Unfortunately, coaches don't like
to deal with change. It frightens
them. They don't seem to realize
that a real crisis faces them as
more and more athletes refuse to
become pawns in their silly games.
To survive, football will have to
undergo some radical changes. A
good beginning might be to give
control of the sport back to the
athletes. "
In high school, McClure had
been, in his words, "into
football." All that changed at
Stanford, where he found an
employee-employer relationship
between the staff and the team.
"It was strictly business. We really
didn't know the coaches, and they
really didn't know us except on
the most superficial level. "

Armed with a degree in
English, McClure was happy to
say goodbye to his four years of,
college foot jail last spring. This is
his farewell message:
Picture this: it's half time at
the 1971 Rose Bowl game,
Stanford versus Ohio State, and as
millions of football fans stare
blankly at their television sets, the
NCAA seal flashes across the
screen and the suddenly solemn
voice of Curt Gowdy reads the
following announcement: "Fie like
America's college athletes. Turn
on to sports, not to drugs."
Now let's switch to the
Stanford dressing room. Tired
young men in sweat-stained red
jerseys pull off their helmets and
collapse on wooden benches.
What's this? The pressure to win is
so great that some of the players,
without the coach's knowledge,
are removing little green capsules
from their lockers and popping
them into their mouths. Minutes
later, they begin to feel waves of
exhilaration. Their pupils dilate,

their eyes assume a saucer-like
shape. They are turning on.
But not to sports.
At Stanford, we called it
"beaning up," taking
amphetamines to get the heart
pumping faster and the body
functioning at an accelerated
pace. Most players swallow speed
out of self-defense, since the odds
are their opponents are also taking
the drug.
Last season, after the
University of California turned in
a particularly lackluster
performance against San Jose
State, a small-time football school
with big-time aspirations, I asked
a friend of mine on the Cal team
what happened. "Oh, it was
simple," he said. "We just ran out
of beans."
Sometimes even beans don't
help. Like when we were playing
Washington State in Spokane last
year and I wrecked my knee on
the artificial turf. Its boosters say
this kind of playing surface
reduces injuries, but that's not
what happened in my case. No
one hit me, I just slipped and
went flying, tearing ligaments and
cartilage. After that, I was just a
piece of broken machinery as far
as the coaching staff was
concerned. Not even my defensive

line coach stopped by the hospital
to say hello.
That was one of many reasons
1 was happy to graduate last June
and say good-bye to my four-year
career as a college football player.
But before I go into any more
details, let me set the record
straight. I'm no hippie-radical
dope-fiend-troublemaker. I was
just a guy trying to get a college
education who'd been misled.
You see, I always thought football
was a great game, and that games
were supposed to be for the
enjoyment of the athletes
involved. It didn't take me long to
discover that at the college level,
at least at those institutions in the
"major college football team"
category, football is not fun at all.
It is business, a very serious
business.
Well then, you may rightly ask,
if it was so horrible, how did a
bright young fellow like me get
sucked into it? For the answer, I
have to go back to my senior year

at Will C. Crawford High in San
Diego.
I was the ail-American kid,
captain of the football team, vice
president of the student body,
catcher on the baseball team. I
even dated the captain of the
cheerleader squad. It wasn't long
after my final high school game
that football recruiters from
various universities started
dropping by my home, buying me
steak dinners, inviting me on
all-expense-paid trips to their
campuses, when l they got me
dates and invitations to fraternity
parties. It was a pretty heady
experience for an 18-year-old boy.
But even then, naive as I was, I
began to suspect something was
wrong. Here were these
square-shouldered, close-cropped,
middle-aged men, clad in blue
blazers with their university's
insignia emblazoned on the
left-hand pocket, all trying to
convince me that the entire
athletic department and a sizable

portion of the student body were
desperately concerned that 1
choose their school.
One of the more unusual sales
pitches came from the Navy head
coach, Bill Elias. He was in San
Diego to visit some prospects and
invited me up to his hotel room.
My dad's a lieutenant
commander in the naval reserve,
and the idea of having a son at
Annapolis appealed to him, so he
came along.
There was Elias, sprawled
across a bed, elbow propped up
on a pillow, rapping about the
Academy's traditions, its
distinguished graduates and the
comradeship of the brigade of
midshipmen. Then, with a wry
smile, he informed us that getting
an appointment would be no
hassle since the athletic
department got those
appointments originally intended
for predominantly black
congressional districts. I guess
nobody gave a damn about
recruiting future black officers for
the Navy.
Anyway, I finally ended up at
Stanford, signing what was in
effect a four-year contract. I'd
play ball, and they'd give me
room, board, a little spending
money and, oh yes, a college
education.
I chose Stanford for a variety
of reasons. It's a prestige school,
one of the best in the nation, with
a strong academic program that
gives students the opportunity to
spend their junior year in Europe.
Later on I learned the football
coaches, who bragged about this
program when recruiting players,
weren't happy when players took
advantage of it, especially if spring
practice or, even worse, the
football season was missed.
In fact, the coaches had very
little concern with academics.
Football players are at Stanford
to play football. If they get an
education in the time that's left
over, fine. If not, well, they had
the chance, didn't they?
We reported for practice in
mid-August last year, a week
earlier than usual because an extra
game had been added to our
schedule. Costs had gone up, and
a new source of revenue had to be
found to balance the books. An
eleventh regular-season game was
that source. At first there was a
tinge of excitement, because we
were going to play Arkansas on
national television and it was a
chance to catapult Stanford into
the Top Ten. But once the
two-a-day practice sessions began,
that glow quickly wore off.
This was weeks before classes
started, and we were spending
about seven hours a day
practicing. Before it all began,
Head Coach John Ralston gave us
a little speech about how this was
the year Stanford was going to the
Rose Bowl and about how the
coaching staff was going to break
down our minds and bodies and
rebuild us.
Coach Ralston just loved little
homilies like that. Give him half a
chance, and he'd launch into his
"pain is a blessing because it keeps
players awake and alert" speech.

Let him catch a player easing
aching muscles in a whirlpool bath
and out came, "You can't make
the club in the tub." If a practice
session were being filmed, he'd
walk around saying, "You can't
get away from the eye in the
sky."
Sure it was all kind of funny,
but the thing was Ralston was
absolutely serious. He really
believed what he was saying.
At the gym entrance there's a
display of ex-Stanford greats now
in pro football. Each picture is a
testament to the coach's program,
implying that you, too, can be
like these famous pros if you just
follow our simple four-year,
knuckle-down planâ€”the unstated,
but implicit message being that
the ultimate goal of any college
athlete should be a career as a
professional athlete.
One of the Coach's major
concerns was hair. He hated it.
When Terrell Smith, an offensive
guard, showed up with a beard

and long locks, Ralston went into
his annual shape-up-or-get-out

This does wonders in further
segregating us from the rest of the
student body, many of whom
think we're dolts anyway. When
one of the football players, Steve
Jubb, hurt his ankle playing rugby
in the off season, the footbail
trainer refused to treat him
because he'd let his hair grow too
long, so he had to drag his
throbbing ankle to the barber
before he could get it taped by
the trainer.
This concern with hair is just a
part of Coach Ralston's effort to
control how his players look and
think. His attempts at
indoctrination reached absurd
heights before the Arkansas game,
when he hired a troop of
professional incentive builders to

before the previous season's

all kind of look forward to the

Anyway, we were all herded
into a meeting room and faced

with a fellow in a business suit,

he shouts. "Are you a praise cow?
I'm a praise cow. I want people to

USC anyway.

one could understand why any
player would contradict his coach
in the first place.
Sensing the outcome, Demea
spoke up. He told Ralston of the
team's dissatisfaction, and the
Coach promised a conciliatory
message the next morning.
Before his talk, we held
another meeting. By this time,
sentiment was running high in
favor of refusing to practice if our
complaints weren't taken into
account. We decided to hear
Ralston out, then, depending on
his message, plan a course of
action.
A master of the emotional
appeal, Ralston managed to abort
our rebellion without losing a
minute of practice time. He
simply threatened to resign if he
couldn't have complete control of
the team. We just caved in.
He made a short, but very
effective, speech and then left the
locker room. For several minutes
we sat in silence, until Jim
Kauffman said something to the
effect that we should let him have
his way this time. Then, just
before the whole squad swung
passively behind the Coach, Dan
Lightfoot tried to swing the team
back to its original position. He
warned against bowing to Coach
Ralston when we thought our
grievances were justified.
Demea Washington followed
with a fiery answer to Ralston.
"As long as football players stay
lily-white, men like Ralston will
continue to coach. And I'm not
talking about skin color," he
shouted. "When ballplayers start
realizing they don't have to take
everything that comes down on
them, things are really gonna
change."

oration, Ralston stuck his head in
and shouted, "Two minutes!"
With that, everyone fied his
shoelaces and trudged out to
practice.
If only we had known what
had already taken place at Ohio
State, we probably wouldn't have
folded so easily. Ohio State Coach
Woody Hayes had taken his team
to the 1969 Rose Bowl and ran
what amounted to a military
camp while preparing for the

game. The sophomores on that
team were seniors now and
wanted no part of a repeat
performance when they came to
California this time.
I met several Ohio State
players during our trip to
Disneyland, and they told me that
all the seniors on the squad had
gone to Hayes with an ultimatum:
no two-a-day practices before the
game. When he heard that, Hayes
went a little crazy, he began
ranting and raving, but the players
knew they held the trump card
and refused to cave in. This time,
it was the coach who was forced
to compromise.
I'm repeating this story to
correct an illusion created by the
press before the Rose Bowl game.
It seems that Stanford's
reputation as the "Harvard of the
West" and Haves' reputation as a
hard-nosed martinet affected the
way both training camps were
covered.
According to the media, Ohio
State was holding rugged practice
sessions behind closed doors,
while the Stanford team was
taking it easy, treating the Rose
Bowl game as fun, just a way to
enjoy Christmas vacation. Woody
Hayes became the bad guy, and
easy-going John Ralston the good
guy-
It just wasn't so. In their
approach to college football, they
are both "bad guys."
Actually, it isn't all the coach's
fault. If he doesn't produce a
winner, he loses his job. An
unsettling prospect for a man like
Ralston with a wife and three
kids. I'm sure if the players had a
chance to know Ralston better
they would find him a very decent
guy, but he simply can't afford to
have that kind of relationship
with the team. Stanford must
average 40,000 paid spectators for
each home game to make money
with football. It's an economic
fact of life the coach has to live
with.
So football, which began as a
game run by students for
students, has, at several hundred
colleges and universities, been
wrested away from the players'
control. At Stanford, football is a
large and serious undertaking,
with eight full-time coaches, a
publicity man and numerous
other employees. The result is a
frantic coach and a squad of
understandably disgruntled
players.
These changing attitudes have
finally become obvious to the
coaches, and they are taking
precautions against a full-scale
â€¢rebellion. At least that's the case
at Stanford, which appears headed
for the ultimate bad-trip football
scene. They've begun recruiting
junior-college players in large
numbers. Most of these are
fellows who couldn't have gotten
into Stanford as freshmen, but
after two years at a junior college,
they can enter as juniors, with
two years of football eligibility
left.
Of course, things aren't all bad.
The other day, someone said that
college football must be fun at
some school.
I said, yes, it must be fun at
Pomona State. He said he'd never
heard of Pomona State.
That's why, I said, it must be
fun to play football there.

"Good-bye to ail that RAH,
RAH!" LOOK Magazine, October
5, 19 71 issue, by Tim McClure
with Jared Lebow, LOOK
Associate Sports Editor.
Reprinted with permission from
LOOK Magazine.
At this time last year, Tim
McClure was a defensive tackle on
the Stanford University football
team. A sinewy six-foot-two, he
was hardworking, intelligent and
aggressive. Everything a coach
could ash for. But something was
bothering him as he went through
the motions of blocking and
tackling in practice and in games.
"Playing football just wasn't
fun any more," he said, "and
when I sat down and thought
about it seriously, I realized that
at Stanford, it never had been
fun."
It bothered Tim that people
weren't seeing what they thought
they were seeing when they
watched a college football game,
that few realized how tightly
coaches controlled the lives of
their players or knew about the
drugs and the callous treatment of
injured athletes.

So he contacted LOOK and
asked us to help him tell his story.
"It appears to be accepted
doctrine that the coach must be a
tyrant," said McClure. "Merely
conditioning athletes is no longer
enough. Coaches feel they must
tell a player how to think. I went
through many changes in the last
four years, changes every college
student goes through.
Unfortunately, coaches don't like
to deal with change. It frightens
them. They don't seem to realize
that a real crisis faces them as
more and more athletes refuse to
become pawns in their silly games.
To survive, football will have to
undergo some radical changes. A
good beginning might be to give
control of the sport back to the
athletes. "
In high school, McClure had
been, in his words, "into
football." All that changed at
Stanford, where he found an
employee-employer relationship
between the staff and the team.
"It was strictly business. We really
didn't know the coaches, and they
really didn't know us except on
the most superficial level. "

Armed with a degree in
English, McClure was happy to
say goodbye to his four years of,
college foot jail last spring. This is
his farewell message:
Picture this: it's half time at
the 1971 Rose Bowl game,
Stanford versus Ohio State, and as
millions of football fans stare
blankly at their television sets, the
NCAA seal flashes across the
screen and the suddenly solemn
voice of Curt Gowdy reads the
following announcement: "Fie like
America's college athletes. Turn
on to sports, not to drugs."
Now let's switch to the
Stanford dressing room. Tired
young men in sweat-stained red
jerseys pull off their helmets and
collapse on wooden benches.
What's this? The pressure to win is
so great that some of the players,
without the coach's knowledge,
are removing little green capsules
from their lockers and popping
them into their mouths. Minutes
later, they begin to feel waves of
exhilaration. Their pupils dilate,

their eyes assume a saucer-like
shape. They are turning on.
But not to sports.
At Stanford, we called it
"beaning up," taking
amphetamines to get the heart
pumping faster and the body
functioning at an accelerated
pace. Most players swallow speed
out of self-defense, since the odds
are their opponents are also taking
the drug.
Last season, after the
University of California turned in
a particularly lackluster
performance against San Jose
State, a small-time football school
with big-time aspirations, I asked
a friend of mine on the Cal team
what happened. "Oh, it was
simple," he said. "We just ran out
of beans."
Sometimes even beans don't
help. Like when we were playing
Washington State in Spokane last
year and I wrecked my knee on
the artificial turf. Its boosters say
this kind of playing surface
reduces injuries, but that's not
what happened in my case. No
one hit me, I just slipped and
went flying, tearing ligaments and
cartilage. After that, I was just a
piece of broken machinery as far
as the coaching staff was
concerned. Not even my defensive

line coach stopped by the hospital
to say hello.
That was one of many reasons
1 was happy to graduate last June
and say good-bye to my four-year
career as a college football player.
But before I go into any more
details, let me set the record
straight. I'm no hippie-radical
dope-fiend-troublemaker. I was
just a guy trying to get a college
education who'd been misled.
You see, I always thought football
was a great game, and that games
were supposed to be for the
enjoyment of the athletes
involved. It didn't take me long to
discover that at the college level,
at least at those institutions in the
"major college football team"
category, football is not fun at all.
It is business, a very serious
business.
Well then, you may rightly ask,
if it was so horrible, how did a
bright young fellow like me get
sucked into it? For the answer, I
have to go back to my senior year

at Will C. Crawford High in San
Diego.
I was the ail-American kid,
captain of the football team, vice
president of the student body,
catcher on the baseball team. I
even dated the captain of the
cheerleader squad. It wasn't long
after my final high school game
that football recruiters from
various universities started
dropping by my home, buying me
steak dinners, inviting me on
all-expense-paid trips to their
campuses, when l they got me
dates and invitations to fraternity
parties. It was a pretty heady
experience for an 18-year-old boy.
But even then, naive as I was, I
began to suspect something was
wrong. Here were these
square-shouldered, close-cropped,
middle-aged men, clad in blue
blazers with their university's
insignia emblazoned on the
left-hand pocket, all trying to
convince me that the entire
athletic department and a sizable

portion of the student body were
desperately concerned that 1
choose their school.
One of the more unusual sales
pitches came from the Navy head
coach, Bill Elias. He was in San
Diego to visit some prospects and
invited me up to his hotel room.
My dad's a lieutenant
commander in the naval reserve,
and the idea of having a son at
Annapolis appealed to him, so he
came along.
There was Elias, sprawled
across a bed, elbow propped up
on a pillow, rapping about the
Academy's traditions, its
distinguished graduates and the
comradeship of the brigade of
midshipmen. Then, with a wry
smile, he informed us that getting
an appointment would be no
hassle since the athletic
department got those
appointments originally intended
for predominantly black
congressional districts. I guess
nobody gave a damn about
recruiting future black officers for
the Navy.
Anyway, I finally ended up at
Stanford, signing what was in
effect a four-year contract. I'd
play ball, and they'd give me
room, board, a little spending
money and, oh yes, a college
education.
I chose Stanford for a variety
of reasons. It's a prestige school,
one of the best in the nation, with
a strong academic program that
gives students the opportunity to
spend their junior year in Europe.
Later on I learned the football
coaches, who bragged about this
program when recruiting players,
weren't happy when players took
advantage of it, especially if spring
practice or, even worse, the
football season was missed.
In fact, the coaches had very
little concern with academics.
Football players are at Stanford
to play football. If they get an
education in the time that's left
over, fine. If not, well, they had
the chance, didn't they?
We reported for practice in
mid-August last year, a week
earlier than usual because an extra
game had been added to our
schedule. Costs had gone up, and
a new source of revenue had to be
found to balance the books. An
eleventh regular-season game was
that source. At first there was a
tinge of excitement, because we
were going to play Arkansas on
national television and it was a
chance to catapult Stanford into
the Top Ten. But once the
two-a-day practice sessions began,
that glow quickly wore off.
This was weeks before classes
started, and we were spending
about seven hours a day
practicing. Before it all began,
Head Coach John Ralston gave us
a little speech about how this was
the year Stanford was going to the
Rose Bowl and about how the
coaching staff was going to break
down our minds and bodies and
rebuild us.
Coach Ralston just loved little
homilies like that. Give him half a
chance, and he'd launch into his
"pain is a blessing because it keeps
players awake and alert" speech.

Let him catch a player easing
aching muscles in a whirlpool bath
and out came, "You can't make
the club in the tub." If a practice
session were being filmed, he'd
walk around saying, "You can't
get away from the eye in the
sky."
Sure it was all kind of funny,
but the thing was Ralston was
absolutely serious. He really
believed what he was saying.
At the gym entrance there's a
display of ex-Stanford greats now
in pro football. Each picture is a
testament to the coach's program,
implying that you, too, can be
like these famous pros if you just
follow our simple four-year,
knuckle-down planâ€”the unstated,
but implicit message being that
the ultimate goal of any college
athlete should be a career as a
professional athlete.
One of the Coach's major
concerns was hair. He hated it.
When Terrell Smith, an offensive
guard, showed up with a beard

and long locks, Ralston went into
his annual shape-up-or-get-out
tantrum. You can always tell the
football players at Stanford.
They're the guys with short hair.
This does wonders in further
segregating us from the rest of the
student body, many of whom
think we're dolts anyway. When
one of the football players, Steve
Jubb, hurt his ankle playing rugby
in the off season, the footbail
trainer refused to treat him
because he'd let his hair grow too
long, so he had to drag his
throbbing ankle to the barber
before he could get it taped by
the trainer.
This concern with hair is just a
part of Coach Ralston's effort to
control how his players look and
think. His attempts at
indoctrination reached absurd
heights before the Arkansas game,
when he hired a troop of
professional incentive builders to
psych us up for the season opener.
It was absurd because he'd
tried the same thing and failed
before the previous season's
Southern Cal game. Actually, we
all kind of look forward to the
USC match. Many players on both
teams went to high school in
Southern California and knew
each other off the field. USC
always has one of the nation's
strongest teams, and it's enjoyable
to play against the best. Besides,
the game is a sellout, and each
player is usually able to scalp his
four free tickets for about a
hundred dollars.
Anyway, we were all herded
into a meeting room and faced

with a fellow in a business suit,
surrounded by charts.
"What kind of cow are you?"
he shouts. "Are you a praise cow?
I'm a praise cow. I want people to
give me praise; that's why I work
hard. Now, if you work hard,
you're going to get praise from all
your friends for beating USC."
Well, right there, the meeting
started going downhill. Guys were
laughing at him, and he began
getting desperate. Finally, he just
lost control and started doing an
imitation of Daffy Duck, like he
was Daffy Duck on a TV show
before he became an incentive
builder.
To be honest, he did a pretty
good Daffy Duck, but we lost to
USC anyway.
Not one to admit defeat,
Ralston invited a different crew of
pitchmen to build us up for the
Arkansas game. He introduced the
main speaker and mentioned that
after a single session, such as the
one we were about to experience,
sales usually shot up 12 percent.
Maybe we were supposed to sell
our kneepads to the Arkansas
players.
"Who's going to win
Saturday?" shouted Mr. Incentive.
Dead silence. It was one o'clock,
hot and right in the middle of
two-a-day practices. When he
realized there would be no pep
rally, he changed tactics by
passing out blank cards and asking
us to write down what Coach
Ralston would say after the game.
He handed one to linebacker
Dennis Moore, and Dennis
dropped it. He tried to give
Dennis a second card but was
fixed with such a blood-chilling
stare that he stumbled back to the
platform. In a last-ditch effort, he
called on our All America
quarterback, a guy who was to
win the Heisman Trophy, to stand
as an example of one who had
overcome hardships to achieve
success. Not a bad idea, except he
introduced him as Jerry Plunkett.
Even Jim, a straight arrow liked
by both players and coaches,
broke up.
The first signs of rebellion
appeared when two of my
teammates, Jim Kauffman and
Dan Lightfoot, paid a visit to
Athletic Director Chuck Taylor.
The feeling was that if the players
had to report back early for an
extra game to make the athletic
department extra money, they
should get something in return.
The demands were trivialâ€”clean
athletic supporters and socks for
every practice, free blazers for our
road trips and a stop in Las Vegas
on the way back from Arkansas.

After much haggling, the demands
were met.
Well, we beat Arkansas, San
Jose State and Oregon before
losing to Purdue. Then we upset
USC, and flew up to Spokane to
play Washington State. It was a
pleasant afternoon for the
teamâ€”Stanford won 63-16â€”but a
painful one for me, because it was
that day my left knee was
wrecked.
I was still in the hospital when
Stanford won its next three
conference games before losing to
a non-conference opponent, the
Air Force Academy. The game
wasn't very important, and
Charles Saibel, one of our guards,
dropped by to say he was kind of
glad we lost, because Air Force
wanted to win so badly and it
made them so happy when they
did.
All in all, the season was a huge
success for the coaches. We
finished with an 8-3 record, won
the Pacific Coast Conference title
and received Stanford's first Rose
Bowl invitation in 19 years. When
we had our annual end-of-season
banquet following the Cal game,
everyone was in a good mood.
Coach Ralston needed only a few
minutes to shatter it.
As in the past, we all gathered
in a Cantonese restaurant, ate all
we could hold, kidded around and
in general relaxed after four
months of hard work.
Dinner completed, Bob
Murphy, the sports publicity
director, introduced Coach
Ralston as the West Coast Coach
of the Year and candidate for
national coach of the year.
Ralston thanked Murphy and then
declared he had little chance to
win the latter award with our 8-3
record since Bob Devaney of
Nebraska was 10-0 and Darrel
Royal of Texas was undefeated
and Ara Parseghian had lost only
one. Then he began berating us
for the two late-season losses to
Air Force and California. By now,
we had braced ourselves for a
most unpleasant evening.
After condemning us for those
losses, Ralston dismissed the past
11 games and launched into an
account of what the future held.
There would be 20 days of
practice in preparation for the
Rose Bowl, including six days of
two-a-day workouts during our
Christmas vacations. Bitterly, he
added there were rumors about
our being unhappy with two-a-day
workouts and that this disgusted
him.
We began practice two days
before finals' week. Since football
takes from four to five hours a
day during the regular season,
most of the players felt this
climactic imposition was a bit
much. Because of it, many found
themselves in academic trouble.
We arrived in Pasadena on
December 22, and a strict 10:30
p.m. curfew was imposed. A fleet
of fancy cars provided for our use
never left their parking spaces.
Other than a visit to Disneyland
and an awards banquet, we had to
spend our free time between
practice sessions viewing football
films of ourselves and Ohio State.
After five days of this, Dan
Lightfoot, an offensive guard, and
I called a meeting to discuss our
grievances. Thirty-five members of
the 50-man squad showed up; the
rest had failed to hear about the
meeting. All present, except
co-captains Jack Shultz and
Plunkett, felt two practice
sessions a day was one too many
and that the curfew was too early.
Demea Washington, split end,
suggested sending a delegation to

Ralston to urge an end to daily
double-practice sessions.
So Demea, Ron Kadziel, a
linebacker, and Schultz and
Plunkett were chosen to visit
Ralston's suite. Sending the
captains along was a bad decision.
Throughout the season both had
been Ralston's strongest
supporters. Although sincere in
offering to communicate the
team's grievances, they found it
an impossible task because neither

one could understand why any
player would contradict his coach
in the first place.
Sensing the outcome, Demea
spoke up. He told Ralston of the
team's dissatisfaction, and the
Coach promised a conciliatory
message the next morning.
Before his talk, we held
another meeting. By this time,
sentiment was running high in
favor of refusing to practice if our
complaints weren't taken into
account. We decided to hear
Ralston out, then, depending on
his message, plan a course of
action.
A master of the emotional
appeal, Ralston managed to abort
our rebellion without losing a
minute of practice time. He
simply threatened to resign if he
couldn't have complete control of
the team. We just caved in.
He made a short, but very
effective, speech and then left the
locker room. For several minutes
we sat in silence, until Jim
Kauffman said something to the

What's this? The pressure to win is
so great that some of the players,
without the coach's knowledge,
are removing little green capsules
from their lockers and popping
them into their mouths. Minutes
later, they begin to feel waves of
exhilaration. Their pupils dilate,

their eyes assume a saucer-like
shape. They are turning on.
But not to sports.
At Stanford, we called it
"beaning up," taking
amphetamines to get the heart
pumping faster and the body
functioning at an accelerated
pace. Most players swallow speed
out of self-defense, since the odds
are their opponents are also taking
the drug.
Last season, after the
University of California turned in
a particularly lackluster
performance against San Jose
State, a small-time football school
with big-time aspirations, I asked
a friend of mine on the Cal team
what happened. "Oh, it was
simple," he said. "We just ran out
of beans."
Sometimes even beans don't
help. Like when we were playing
Washington State in Spokane last
year and I wrecked my knee on
the artificial turf. Its boosters say
this kind of playing surface
reduces injuries, but that's not
what happened in my case. No
one hit me, I just slipped and
went flying, tearing ligaments and
cartilage. After that, I was just a
piece of broken machinery as far
as the coaching staff was
concerned. Not even my defensive

line coach stopped by the hospital
to say hello.
That was one of many reasons
1 was happy to graduate last June
and say good-bye to my four-year
career as a college football player.
But before I go into any more
details, let me set the record
straight. I'm no hippie-radical
dope-fiend-troublemaker. I was
just a guy trying to get a college
education who'd been misled.
You see, I always thought football
was a great game, and that games
were supposed to be for the
enjoyment of the athletes
involved. It didn't take me long to
discover that at the college level,
at least at those institutions in the
"major college football team"
category, football is not fun at all.
It is business, a very serious
business.
Well then, you may rightly ask,
if it was so horrible, how did a
bright young fellow like me get
sucked into it? For the answer, I
have to go back to my senior year

at Will C. Crawford High in San
Diego.
I was the ail-American kid,
captain of the football team, vice
president of the student body,
catcher on the baseball team. I
even dated the captain of the
cheerleader squad. It wasn't long
after my final high school game
that football recruiters from
various universities started
dropping by my home, buying me
steak dinners, inviting me on
all-expense-paid trips to their
campuses, when l they got me
dates and invitations to fraternity
parties. It was a pretty heady
experience for an 18-year-old boy.
But even then, naive as I was, I
began to suspect something was
wrong. Here were these
square-shouldered, close-cropped,
middle-aged men, clad in blue
blazers with their university's
insignia emblazoned on the
left-hand pocket, all trying to
convince me that the entire
athletic department and a sizable

portion of the student body were
desperately concerned that 1
choose their school.
One of the more unusual sales
pitches came from the Navy head
coach, Bill Elias. He was in San
Diego to visit some prospects and
invited me up to his hotel room.
My dad's a lieutenant
commander in the naval reserve,
and the idea of having a son at
Annapolis appealed to him, so he
came along.
There was Elias, sprawled
across a bed, elbow propped up
on a pillow, rapping about the
Academy's traditions, its
distinguished graduates and the
comradeship of the brigade of
midshipmen. Then, with a wry
smile, he informed us that getting
an appointment would be no
hassle since the athletic
department got those
appointments originally intended
for predominantly black
congressional districts. I guess
nobody gave a damn about
recruiting future black officers for
the Navy.
Anyway, I finally ended up at
Stanford, signing what was in
effect a four-year contract. I'd
play ball, and they'd give me
room, board, a little spending
money and, oh yes, a college
education.
I chose Stanford for a variety
of reasons. It's a prestige school,
one of the best in the nation, with
a strong academic program that
gives students the opportunity to
spend their junior year in Europe.
Later on I learned the football
coaches, who bragged about this
program when recruiting players,
weren't happy when players took
advantage of it, especially if spring
practice or, even worse, the
football season was missed.
In fact, the coaches had very
little concern with academics.
Football players are at Stanford
to play football. If they get an
education in the time that's left
over, fine. If not, well, they had
the chance, didn't they?
We reported for practice in
mid-August last year, a week
earlier than usual because an extra
game had been added to our
schedule. Costs had gone up, and
a new source of revenue had to be
found to balance the books. An
eleventh regular-season game was
that source. At first there was a
tinge of excitement, because we
were going to play Arkansas on
national television and it was a
chance to catapult Stanford into
the Top Ten. But once the
two-a-day practice sessions began,
that glow quickly wore off.
This was weeks before classes
started, and we were spending
about seven hours a day
practicing. Before it all began,
Head Coach John Ralston gave us
a little speech about how this was
the year Stanford was going to the
Rose Bowl and about how the
coaching staff was going to break
down our minds and bodies and
rebuild us.
Coach Ralston just loved little
homilies like that. Give him half a
chance, and he'd launch into his
"pain is a blessing because it keeps
players awake and alert" speech.

Let him catch a player easing
aching muscles in a whirlpool bath
and out came, "You can't make
the club in the tub." If a practice
session were being filmed, he'd
walk around saying, "You can't
get away from the eye in the
sky."
Sure it was all kind of funny,
but the thing was Ralston was
absolutely serious. He really
believed what he was saying.
At the gym entrance there's a
display of ex-Stanford greats now
in pro football. Each picture is a
testament to the coach's program,
implying that you, too, can be
like these famous pros if you just
follow our simple four-year,
knuckle-down planâ€”the unstated,
but implicit message being that
the ultimate goal of any college
athlete should be a career as a
professional athlete.
One of the Coach's major
concerns was hair. He hated it.
When Terrell Smith, an offensive
guard, showed up with a beard

and long locks, Ralston went into
his annual shape-up-or-get-out
tantrum. You can always tell the
football players at Stanford.
They're the guys with short hair.
This does wonders in further
segregating us from the rest of the
student body, many of whom
think we're dolts anyway. When
one of the football players, Steve
Jubb, hurt his ankle playing rugby
in the off season, the footbail
trainer refused to treat him
because he'd let his hair grow too
long, so he had to drag his
throbbing ankle to the barber
before he could get it taped by
the trainer.
This concern with hair is just a
part of Coach Ralston's effort to
control how his players look and
think. His attempts at
indoctrination reached absurd
heights before the Arkansas game,
when he hired a troop of
professional incentive builders to
psych us up for the season opener.
It was absurd because he'd
tried the same thing and failed
before the previous season's
Southern Cal game. Actually, we
all kind of look forward to the
USC match. Many players on both
teams went to high school in
Southern California and knew
each other off the field. USC
always has one of the nation's
strongest teams, and it's enjoyable
to play against the best. Besides,
the game is a sellout, and each
player is usually able to scalp his
four free tickets for about a
hundred dollars.
Anyway, we were all herded
into a meeting room and faced

with a fellow in a business suit,
surrounded by charts.
"What kind of cow are you?"
he shouts. "Are you a praise cow?
I'm a praise cow. I want people to
give me praise; that's why I work
hard. Now, if you work hard,
you're going to get praise from all
your friends for beating USC."
Well, right there, the meeting
started going downhill. Guys were
laughing at him, and he began
getting desperate. Finally, he just
lost control and started doing an
imitation of Daffy Duck, like he
was Daffy Duck on a TV show
before he became an incentive
builder.
To be honest, he did a pretty
good Daffy Duck, but we lost to
USC anyway.
Not one to admit defeat,
Ralston invited a different crew of
pitchmen to build us up for the
Arkansas game. He introduced the
main speaker and mentioned that
after a single session, such as the
one we were about to experience,
sales usually shot up 12 percent.
Maybe we were supposed to sell
our kneepads to the Arkansas
players.
"Who's going to win
Saturday?" shouted Mr. Incentive.
Dead silence. It was one o'clock,
hot and right in the middle of
two-a-day practices. When he
realized there would be no pep
rally, he changed tactics by
passing out blank cards and asking
us to write down what Coach
Ralston would say after the game.
He handed one to linebacker
Dennis Moore, and Dennis
dropped it. He tried to give
Dennis a second card but was
fixed with such a blood-chilling
stare that he stumbled back to the
platform. In a last-ditch effort, he
called on our All America
quarterback, a guy who was to
win the Heisman Trophy, to stand
as an example of one who had
overcome hardships to achieve
success. Not a bad idea, except he
introduced him as Jerry Plunkett.
Even Jim, a straight arrow liked
by both players and coaches,
broke up.
The first signs of rebellion
appeared when two of my
teammates, Jim Kauffman and
Dan Lightfoot, paid a visit to
Athletic Director Chuck Taylor.
The feeling was that if the players
had to report back early for an
extra game to make the athletic
department extra money, they
should get something in return.
The demands were trivialâ€”clean
athletic supporters and socks for
every practice, free blazers for our
road trips and a stop in Las Vegas
on the way back from Arkansas.

After much haggling, the demands
were met.
Well, we beat Arkansas, San
Jose State and Oregon before
losing to Purdue. Then we upset
USC, and flew up to Spokane to
play Washington State. It was a
pleasant afternoon for the
teamâ€”Stanford won 63-16â€”but a
painful one for me, because it was
that day my left knee was
wrecked.
I was still in the hospital when
Stanford won its next three
conference games before losing to
a non-conference opponent, the
Air Force Academy. The game
wasn't very important, and
Charles Saibel, one of our guards,
dropped by to say he was kind of
glad we lost, because Air Force
wanted to win so badly and it
made them so happy when they
did.
All in all, the season was a huge
success for the coaches. We
finished with an 8-3 record, won
the Pacific Coast Conference title
and received Stanford's first Rose
Bowl invitation in 19 years. When
we had our annual end-of-season
banquet following the Cal game,
everyone was in a good mood.
Coach Ralston needed only a few
minutes to shatter it.
As in the past, we all gathered
in a Cantonese restaurant, ate all
we could hold, kidded around and
in general relaxed after four
months of hard work.
Dinner completed, Bob
Murphy, the sports publicity
director, introduced Coach
Ralston as the West Coast Coach
of the Year and candidate for
national coach of the year.
Ralston thanked Murphy and then
declared he had little chance to
win the latter award with our 8-3
record since Bob Devaney of
Nebraska was 10-0 and Darrel
Royal of Texas was undefeated
and Ara Parseghian had lost only
one. Then he began berating us
for the two late-season losses to
Air Force and California. By now,
we had braced ourselves for a
most unpleasant evening.
After condemning us for those
losses, Ralston dismissed the past
11 games and launched into an
account of what the future held.
There would be 20 days of
practice in preparation for the
Rose Bowl, including six days of
two-a-day workouts during our
Christmas vacations. Bitterly, he
added there were rumors about
our being unhappy with two-a-day
workouts and that this disgusted
him.
We began practice two days
before finals' week. Since football
takes from four to five hours a
day during the regular season,
most of the players felt this
climactic imposition was a bit
much. Because of it, many found
themselves in academic trouble.
We arrived in Pasadena on
December 22, and a strict 10:30
p.m. curfew was imposed. A fleet
of fancy cars provided for our use
never left their parking spaces.
Other than a visit to Disneyland
and an awards banquet, we had to
spend our free time between
practice sessions viewing football
films of ourselves and Ohio State.
After five days of this, Dan
Lightfoot, an offensive guard, and
I called a meeting to discuss our
grievances. Thirty-five members of
the 50-man squad showed up; the
rest had failed to hear about the
meeting. All present, except
co-captains Jack Shultz and
Plunkett, felt two practice
sessions a day was one too many
and that the curfew was too early.
Demea Washington, split end,
suggested sending a delegation to

Ralston to urge an end to daily
double-practice sessions.
So Demea, Ron Kadziel, a
linebacker, and Schultz and
Plunkett were chosen to visit
Ralston's suite. Sending the
captains along was a bad decision.
Throughout the season both had
been Ralston's strongest
supporters. Although sincere in
offering to communicate the
team's grievances, they found it
an impossible task because neither

one could understand why any
player would contradict his coach
in the first place.
Sensing the outcome, Demea
spoke up. He told Ralston of the
team's dissatisfaction, and the
Coach promised a conciliatory
message the next morning.
Before his talk, we held
another meeting. By this time,
sentiment was running high in
favor of refusing to practice if our
complaints weren't taken into
account. We decided to hear
Ralston out, then, depending on
his message, plan a course of
action.
A master of the emotional
appeal, Ralston managed to abort
our rebellion without losing a
minute of practice time. He
simply threatened to resign if he
couldn't have complete control of
the team. We just caved in.
He made a short, but very
effective, speech and then left the
locker room. For several minutes
we sat in silence, until Jim
Kauffman said something to the
effect that we should let him have
his way this time. Then, just
before the whole squad swung
passively behind the Coach, Dan
Lightfoot tried to swing the team
back to its original position. He
warned against bowing to Coach
Ralston when we thought our
grievances were justified.
Demea Washington followed
with a fiery answer to Ralston.
"As long as football players stay
lily-white, men like Ralston will
continue to coach. And I'm not
talking about skin color," he
shouted. "When ballplayers start
realizing they don't have to take
everything that comes down on
them, things are really gonna
change."
Seconds after Demea's fierv

oration, Ralston stuck his head in
and shouted, "Two minutes!"
With that, everyone fied his
shoelaces and trudged out to
practice.
If only we had known what
had already taken place at Ohio
State, we probably wouldn't have
folded so easily. Ohio State Coach
Woody Hayes had taken his team
to the 1969 Rose Bowl and ran
what amounted to a military
camp while preparing for the

game. The sophomores on that
team were seniors now and
wanted no part of a repeat
performance when they came to
California this time.
I met several Ohio State
players during our trip to
Disneyland, and they told me that
all the seniors on the squad had
gone to Hayes with an ultimatum:
no two-a-day practices before the
game. When he heard that, Hayes
went a little crazy, he began
ranting and raving, but the players
knew they held the trump card
and refused to cave in. This time,
it was the coach who was forced
to compromise.
I'm repeating this story to
correct an illusion created by the
press before the Rose Bowl game.
It seems that Stanford's
reputation as the "Harvard of the
West" and Haves' reputation as a
hard-nosed martinet affected the
way both training camps were
covered.
According to the media, Ohio
State was holding rugged practice
sessions behind closed doors,
while the Stanford team was
taking it easy, treating the Rose
Bowl game as fun, just a way to
enjoy Christmas vacation. Woody
Hayes became the bad guy, and
easy-going John Ralston the good
guy-
It just wasn't so. In their
approach to college football, they
are both "bad guys."
Actually, it isn't all the coach's
fault. If he doesn't produce a
winner, he loses his job. An
unsettling prospect for a man like
Ralston with a wife and three
kids. I'm sure if the players had a
chance to know Ralston better
they would find him a very decent
guy, but he simply can't afford to
have that kind of relationship
with the team. Stanford must
average 40,000 paid spectators for
each home game to make money
with football. It's an economic
fact of life the coach has to live
with.
So football, which began as a
game run by students for
students, has, at several hundred
colleges and universities, been
wrested away from the players'
control. At Stanford, football is a
large and serious undertaking,
with eight full-time coaches, a
publicity man and numerous
other employees. The result is a
frantic coach and a squad of
understandably disgruntled
players.
These changing attitudes have
finally become obvious to the
coaches, and they are taking
precautions against a full-scale
â€¢rebellion. At least that's the case
at Stanford, which appears headed
for the ultimate bad-trip football
scene. They've begun recruiting
junior-college players in large
numbers. Most of these are
fellows who couldn't have gotten
into Stanford as freshmen, but
after two years at a junior college,
they can enter as juniors, with
two years of football eligibility
left.
Of course, things aren't all bad.
The other day, someone said that
college football must be fun at
some school.
I said, yes, it must be fun at
Pomona State. He said he'd never
heard of Pomona State.
That's why, I said, it must be
fun to play football there.


Okay guys this
is a tough one. lets
all swallow hard
and try to win one
for the pus her.

"Good-bye to ail that RAH,
RAH!" LOOK Magazine, October
5, 19 71 issue, by Tim McClure
with Jared Lebow, LOOK
Associate Sports Editor.
Reprinted with permission from
LOOK Magazine.
At this time last year, Tim
McClure was a defensive tackle on
the Stanford University football
team. A sinewy six-foot-two, he
was hardworking, intelligent and
aggressive. Everything a coach
could ash for. But something was
bothering him as he went through
the motions of blocking and
tackling in practice and in games.
"Playing football just wasn't
fun any more," he said, "and
when I sat down and thought
about it seriously, I realized that
at Stanford, it never had been
fun."
It bothered Tim that people
weren't seeing what they thought
they were seeing when they
watched a college football game,
that few realized how tightly
coaches controlled the lives of
their players or knew about the
drugs and the callous treatment of
injured athletes.

So he contacted LOOK and
asked us to help him tell his story.
"It appears to be accepted
doctrine that the coach must be a
tyrant," said McClure. "Merely
conditioning athletes is no longer
enough. Coaches feel they must
tell a player how to think. I went
through many changes in the last
four years, changes every college
student goes through.
Unfortunately, coaches don't like
to deal with change. It frightens
them. They don't seem to realize
that a real crisis faces them as
more and more athletes refuse to
become pawns in their silly games.
To survive, football will have to
undergo some radical changes. A
good beginning might be to give
control of the sport back to the
athletes. "
In high school, McClure had
been, in his words, "into
football." All that changed at
Stanford, where he found an
employee-employer relationship
between the staff and the team.
"It was strictly business. We really
didn't know the coaches, and they
really didn't know us except on
the most superficial level. "

Armed with a degree in
English, McClure was happy to
say goodbye to his four years of,
college foot jail last spring. This is
his farewell message:
Picture this: it's half time at
the 1971 Rose Bowl game,
Stanford versus Ohio State, and as
millions of football fans stare
blankly at their television sets, the
NCAA seal flashes across the
screen and the suddenly solemn
voice of Curt Gowdy reads the
following announcement: "Fie like
America's college athletes. Turn
on to sports, not to drugs."
Now let's switch to the
Stanford dressing room. Tired
young men in sweat-stained red
jerseys pull off their helmets and
collapse on wooden benches.
What's this? The pressure to win is
so great that some of the players,
without the coach's knowledge,
are removing little green capsules
from their lockers and popping
them into their mouths. Minutes
later, they begin to feel waves of
exhilaration. Their pupils dilate,

their eyes assume a saucer-like
shape. They are turning on.
But not to sports.
At Stanford, we called it
"beaning up," taking
amphetamines to get the heart
pumping faster and the body
functioning at an accelerated
pace. Most players swallow speed
out of self-defense, since the odds
are their opponents are also taking
the drug.
Last season, after the
University of California turned in
a particularly lackluster
performance against San Jose
State, a small-time football school

a friend of mine on the Cal team

all kind of look forward to the
USC match. Many players on both
teams went to high school in
Southern California and knew
each other off the field. USC
always has one of the nation's
strongest teams, and it's enjoyable
to play against the best. Besides,
the game is a sellout, and each
player is usually able to scalp his
four free tickets for about a
hundred dollars.
Anyway, we were all herded
into a meeting room and faced

with a fellow in a business suit,
surrounded by charts.
"What kind of cow are you?"
he shouts. "Are you a praise cow?
I'm a praise cow. I want people to
give me praise; that's why I work
hard. Now, if you work hard,
you're going to get praise from all
your friends for beating USC."
Well, right there, the meeting
started going downhill. Guys were
laughing at him, and he began
getting desperate. Finally, he just
lost control and started doing an
imitation of Daffy Duck, like he
was Daffy Duck on a TV show
before he became an incentive
builder.
To be honest, he did a pretty
good Daffy Duck, but we lost to
USC anyway.
Not one to admit defeat,
Ralston invited a different crew of
pitchmen to build us up for the
Arkansas game. He introduced the
main speaker and mentioned that
after a single session, such as the
one we were about to experience,
sales usually shot up 12 percent.
Maybe we were supposed to sell
our kneepads to the Arkansas
players.
"Who's going to win
Saturday?" shouted Mr. Incentive.
Dead silence. It was one o'clock,
hot and right in the middle of
two-a-day practices. When he
realized there would be no pep
rally, he changed tactics by
passing out blank cards and asking
us to write down what Coach
Ralston would say after the game.
He handed one to linebacker
Dennis Moore, and Dennis
dropped it. He tried to give
Dennis a second card but was
fixed with such a blood-chilling
stare that he stumbled back to the
platform. In a last-ditch effort, he
called on our All America
quarterback, a guy who was to
win the Heisman Trophy, to stand
as an example of one who had
overcome hardships to achieve
success. Not a bad idea, except he
introduced him as Jerry Plunkett.
Even Jim, a straight arrow liked
by both players and coaches,
broke up.
The first signs of rebellion
appeared when two of my
teammates, Jim Kauffman and
Dan Lightfoot, paid a visit to
Athletic Director Chuck Taylor.
The feeling was that if the players
had to report back early for an
extra game to make the athletic
department extra money, they
should get something in return.
The demands were trivialâ€”clean
athletic supporters and socks for
every practice, free blazers for our
road trips and a stop in Las Vegas
on the way back from Arkansas.

After much haggling, the demands
were met.
Well, we beat Arkansas, San
Jose State and Oregon before
losing to Purdue. Then we upset
USC, and flew up to Spokane to
play Washington State. It was a
pleasant afternoon for the
teamâ€”Stanford won 63-16â€”but a
painful one for me, because it was
that day my left knee was
wrecked.
I was still in the hospital when
Stanford won its next three
conference games before losing to
a non-conference opponent, the
Air Force Academy. The game
wasn't very important, and
Charles Saibel, one of our guards,
dropped by to say he was kind of
glad we lost, because Air Force
wanted to win so badly and it
made them so happy when they
did.
All in all, the season was a huge
success for the coaches. We
finished with an 8-3 record, won
the Pacific Coast Conference title
and received Stanford's first Rose
Bowl invitation in 19 years. When
we had our annual end-of-season
banquet following the Cal game,
everyone was in a good mood.
Coach Ralston needed only a few
minutes to shatter it.
As in the past, we all gathered
in a Cantonese restaurant, ate all
we could hold, kidded around and
in general relaxed after four
months of hard work.
Dinner completed, Bob
Murphy, the sports publicity
director, introduced Coach
Ralston as the West Coast Coach
of the Year and candidate for
national coach of the year.
Ralston thanked Murphy and then
declared he had little chance to
win the latter award with our 8-3
record since Bob Devaney of
Nebraska was 10-0 and Darrel
Royal of Texas was undefeated
and Ara Parseghian had lost only
one. Then he began berating us
for the two late-season losses to
Air Force and California. By now,
we had braced ourselves for a
most unpleasant evening.
After condemning us for those
losses, Ralston dismissed the past
11 games and launched into an
account of what the future held.
There would be 20 days of
practice in preparation for the
Rose Bowl, including six days of
two-a-day workouts during our
Christmas vacations. Bitterly, he
added there were rumors about
our being unhappy with two-a-day
workouts and that this disgusted
him.
We began practice two days
before finals' week. Since football
takes from four to five hours a
day during the regular season,
most of the players felt this
climactic imposition was a bit
much. Because of it, many found
themselves in academic trouble.
We arrived in Pasadena on
December 22, and a strict 10:30
p.m. curfew was imposed. A fleet
of fancy cars provided for our use
never left their parking spaces.
Other than a visit to Disneyland
and an awards banquet, we had to
spend our free time between
practice sessions viewing football
films of ourselves and Ohio State.
After five days of this, Dan
Lightfoot, an offensive guard, and
I called a meeting to discuss our
grievances. Thirty-five members of
the 50-man squad showed up; the
rest had failed to hear about the
meeting. All present, except
co-captains Jack Shultz and
Plunkett, felt two practice
sessions a day was one too many
and that the curfew was too early.
Demea Washington, split end,
suggested sending a delegation to

Ralston to urge an end to daily
double-practice sessions.
So Demea, Ron Kadziel, a
linebacker, and Schultz and
Plunkett were chosen to visit
Ralston's suite. Sending the
captains along was a bad decision.
Throughout the season both had
been Ralston's strongest
supporters. Although sincere in
offering to communicate the
team's grievances, they found it
an impossible task because neither

one could understand why any
player would contradict his coach
in the first place.
Sensing the outcome, Demea
spoke up. He told Ralston of the
team's dissatisfaction, and the
Coach promised a conciliatory
message the next morning.
Before his talk, we held
another meeting. By this time,
sentiment was running high in
favor of refusing to practice if our
complaints weren't taken into
account. We decided to hear
Ralston out, then, depending on
his message, plan a course of
action.
A master of the emotional
appeal, Ralston managed to abort
our rebellion without losing a
minute of practice time. He
simply threatened to resign if he
couldn't have complete control of
the team. We just caved in.
He made a short, but very
effective, speech and then left the
locker room. For several minutes
we sat in silence, until Jim
Kauffman said something to the
effect that we should let him have
his way this time. Then, just
before the whole squad swung
passively behind the Coach, Dan
Lightfoot tried to swing the team
back to its original position. He
warned against bowing to Coach
Ralston when we thought our
grievances were justified.
Demea Washington followed
with a fiery answer to Ralston.
"As long as football players stay
lily-white, men like Ralston will
continue to coach. And I'm not
talking about skin color," he
shouted. "When ballplayers start
realizing they don't have to take
everything that comes down on
them, things are really gonna
change."
Seconds after Demea's fierv

oration, Ralston stuck his head in
and shouted, "Two minutes!"
With that, everyone fied his
shoelaces and trudged out to
practice.
If only we had known what
had already taken place at Ohio
State, we probably wouldn't have
folded so easily. Ohio State Coach
Woody Hayes had taken his team
to the 1969 Rose Bowl and ran
what amounted to a military
camp while preparing for the

game. The sophomores on that
team were seniors now and
wanted no part of a repeat
performance when they came to
California this time.
I met several Ohio State
players during our trip to
Disneyland, and they told me that
all the seniors on the squad had
gone to Hayes with an ultimatum:
no two-a-day practices before the
game. When he heard that, Hayes
went a little crazy, he began
ranting and raving, but the players
knew they held the trump card
and refused to cave in. This time,
it was the coach who was forced
to compromise.
I'm repeating this story to
correct an illusion created by the
press before the Rose Bowl game.
It seems that Stanford's
reputation as the "Harvard of the
West" and Haves' reputation as a
hard-nosed martinet affected the
way both training camps were
covered.
According to the media, Ohio
State was holding rugged practice
sessions behind closed doors,
while the Stanford team was
taking it easy, treating the Rose
Bowl game as fun, just a way to
enjoy Christmas vacation. Woody
Hayes became the bad guy, and
easy-going John Ralston the good
guy-
It just wasn't so. In their
approach to college football, they
are both "bad guys."
Actually, it isn't all the coach's
fault. If he doesn't produce a
winner, he loses his job. An
unsettling prospect for a man like
Ralston with a wife and three
kids. I'm sure if the players had a
chance to know Ralston better
they would find him a very decent
guy, but he simply can't afford to
have that kind of relationship
with the team. Stanford must
average 40,000 paid spectators for
each home game to make money
with football. It's an economic
fact of life the coach has to live
with.
So football, which began as a
game run by students for
students, has, at several hundred
colleges and universities, been
wrested away from the players'
control. At Stanford, football is a
large and serious undertaking,
with eight full-time coaches, a
publicity man and numerous
other employees. The result is a
frantic coach and a squad of
understandably disgruntled
players.
These changing attitudes have
finally become obvious to the
coaches, and they are taking
precautions against a full-scale
â€¢rebellion. At least that's the case
at Stanford, which appears headed
for the ultimate bad-trip football
scene. They've begun recruiting
junior-college players in large
numbers. Most of these are
fellows who couldn't have gotten
into Stanford as freshmen, but
after two years at a junior college,
they can enter as juniors, with
two years of football eligibility
left.
Of course, things aren't all bad.
The other day, someone said that
college football must be fun at
some school.
I said, yes, it must be fun at
Pomona State. He said he'd never
heard of Pomona State.
That's why, I said, it must be
fun to play football there.


Okay guys this
is a tough one. lets
all swallow hard
and try to win one
for the pus her.

"Good-bye to ail that RAH,
RAH!" LOOK Magazine, October
5, 19 71 issue, by Tim McClure
with Jared Lebow, LOOK
Associate Sports Editor.
Reprinted with permission from
LOOK Magazine.
At this time last year, Tim
McClure was a defensive tackle on
the Stanford University football
team. A sinewy six-foot-two, he
was hardworking, intelligent and
aggressive. Everything a coach
could ash for. But something was
bothering him as he went through
the motions of blocking and
tackling in practice and in games.
"Playing football just wasn't
fun any more," he said, "and
when I sat down and thought
about it seriously, I realized that
at Stanford, it never had been
fun."
It bothered Tim that people
weren't seeing what they thought
they were seeing when they
watched a college football game,
that few realized how tightly
coaches controlled the lives of
their players or knew about the
drugs and the callous treatment of
injured athletes.

So he contacted LOOK and
asked us to help him tell his story.
"It appears to be accepted
doctrine that the coach must be a
tyrant," said McClure. "Merely
conditioning athletes is no longer
enough. Coaches feel they must
tell a player how to think. I went
through many changes in the last
four years, changes every college
student goes through.
Unfortunately, coaches don't like
to deal with change. It frightens
them. They don't seem to realize
that a real crisis faces them as
more and more athletes refuse to
become pawns in their silly games.
To survive, football will have to
undergo some radical changes. A
good beginning might be to give
control of the sport back to the
athletes. "
In high school, McClure had
been, in his words, "into
football." All that changed at
Stanford, where he found an
employee-employer relationship
between the staff and the team.
"It was strictly business. We really
didn't know the coaches, and they
really didn't know us except on
the most superficial level. "

Armed with a degree in
English, McClure was happy to
say goodbye to his four years of,
college foot jail last spring. This is
his farewell message:
Picture this: it's half time at
the 1971 Rose Bowl game,
Stanford versus Ohio State, and as
millions of football fans stare
blankly at their television sets, the
NCAA seal flashes across the
screen and the suddenly solemn
voice of Curt Gowdy reads the
following announcement: "Fie like
America's college athletes. Turn
on to sports, not to drugs."
Now let's switch to the
Stanford dressing room. Tired
young men in sweat-stained red
jerseys pull off their helmets and
collapse on wooden benches.
What's this? The pressure to win is
so great that some of the players,
without the coach's knowledge,
are removing little green capsules
from their lockers and popping
them into their mouths. Minutes
later, they begin to feel waves of
exhilaration. Their pupils dilate,

their eyes assume a saucer-like
shape. They are turning on.
But not to sports.
At Stanford, we called it
"beaning up," taking
amphetamines to get the heart
pumping faster and the body
functioning at an accelerated
pace. Most players swallow speed
out of self-defense, since the odds
are their opponents are also taking
the drug.
Last season, after the
University of California turned in
a particularly lackluster
performance against San Jose
State, a small-time football school
with big-time aspirations, I asked
a friend of mine on the Cal team
what happened. "Oh, it was
simple," he said. "We just ran out
of beans."
Sometimes even beans don't
help. Like when we were playing
Washington State in Spokane last
year and I wrecked my knee on
the artificial turf. Its boosters say
this kind of playing surface
reduces injuries, but that's not
what happened in my case. No
one hit me, I just slipped and
went flying, tearing ligaments and
cartilage. After that, I was just a
piece of broken machinery as far
as the coaching staff was
concerned. Not even my defensive

line coach stopped by the hospital
to say hello.
That was one of many reasons
1 was happy to graduate last June
and say good-bye to my four-year
career as a college football player.
But before I go into any more
details, let me set the record
straight. I'm no hippie-radical
dope-fiend-troublemaker. I was
just a guy trying to get a college
education who'd been misled.
You see, I always thought football
was a great game, and that games
were supposed to be for the
enjoyment of the athletes
involved. It didn't take me long to
discover that at the college level,
at least at those institutions in the
"major college football team"
category, football is not fun at all.
It is business, a very serious
business.
Well then, you may rightly ask,
if it was so horrible, how did a
bright young fellow like me get
sucked into it? For the answer, I
have to go back to my senior year

at Will C. Crawford High in San
Diego.
I was the ail-American kid,
captain of the football team, vice
president of the student body,
catcher on the baseball team. I
even dated the captain of the
cheerleader squad. It wasn't long
after my final high school game
that football recruiters from
various universities started
dropping by my home, buying me
steak dinners, inviting me on
all-expense-paid trips to their
campuses, when l they got me
dates and invitations to fraternity
parties. It was a pretty heady
experience for an 18-year-old boy.
But even then, naive as I was, I
began to suspect something was
wrong. Here were these
square-shouldered, close-cropped,
middle-aged men, clad in blue
blazers with their university's
insignia emblazoned on the
left-hand pocket, all trying to
convince me that the entire
athletic department and a sizable

portion of the student body were
desperately concerned that 1
choose their school.
One of the more unusual sales
pitches came from the Navy head
coach, Bill Elias. He was in San
Diego to visit some prospects and
invited me up to his hotel room.
My dad's a lieutenant
commander in the naval reserve,
and the idea of having a son at
Annapolis appealed to him, so he
came along.
There was Elias, sprawled
across a bed, elbow propped up
on a pillow, rapping about the
Academy's traditions, its
distinguished graduates and the
comradeship of the brigade of
midshipmen. Then, with a wry
smile, he informed us that getting
an appointment would be no
hassle since the athletic
department got those
appointments originally intended
for predominantly black
congressional districts. I guess
nobody gave a damn about
recruiting future black officers for
the Navy.
Anyway, I finally ended up at
Stanford, signing what was in
effect a four-year contract. I'd
play ball, and they'd give me
room, board, a little spending
money and, oh yes, a college
education.
I chose Stanford for a variety
of reasons. It's a prestige school,
one of the best in the nation, with
a strong academic program that
gives students the opportunity to
spend their junior year in Europe.
Later on I learned the football
coaches, who bragged about this
program when recruiting players,
weren't happy when players took
advantage of it, especially if spring
practice or, even worse, the
football season was missed.
In fact, the coaches had very
little concern with academics.
Football players are at Stanford
to play football. If they get an
education in the time that's left
over, fine. If not, well, they had
the chance, didn't they?
We reported for practice in
mid-August last year, a week
earlier than usual because an extra
game had been added to our
schedule. Costs had gone up, and
a new source of revenue had to be
found to balance the books. An
eleventh regular-season game was
that source. At first there was a
tinge of excitement, because we
were going to play Arkansas on
national television and it was a
chance to catapult Stanford into
the Top Ten. But once the
two-a-day practice sessions began,
that glow quickly wore off.
This was weeks before classes
started, and we were spending
about seven hours a day
practicing. Before it all began,
Head Coach John Ralston gave us
a little speech about how this was
the year Stanford was going to the
Rose Bowl and about how the
coaching staff was going to break
down our minds and bodies and
rebuild us.
Coach Ralston just loved little
homilies like that. Give him half a
chance, and he'd launch into his
"pain is a blessing because it keeps
players awake and alert" speech.

Let him catch a player easing
aching muscles in a whirlpool bath
and out came, "You can't make
the club in the tub." If a practice
session were being filmed, he'd
walk around saying, "You can't
get away from the eye in the
sky."
Sure it was all kind of funny,
but the thing was Ralston was
absolutely serious. He really
believed what he was saying.
At the gym entrance there's a
display of ex-Stanford greats now
in pro football. Each picture is a
testament to the coach's program,
implying that you, too, can be
like these famous pros if you just
follow our simple four-year,
knuckle-down planâ€”the unstated,
but implicit message being that
the ultimate goal of any college
athlete should be a career as a
professional athlete.
One of the Coach's major
concerns was hair. He hated it.
When Terrell Smith, an offensive
guard, showed up with a beard

and long locks, Ralston went into
his annual shape-up-or-get-out
tantrum. You can always tell the
football players at Stanford.
They're the guys with short hair.
This does wonders in further
segregating us from the rest of the
student body, many of whom
think we're dolts anyway. When
one of the football players, Steve
Jubb, hurt his ankle playing rugby
in the off season, the footbail
trainer refused to treat him
because he'd let his hair grow too
long, so he had to drag his
throbbing ankle to the barber
before he could get it taped by
the trainer.
This concern with hair is just a
part of Coach Ralston's effort to
control how his players look and
think. His attempts at
indoctrination reached absurd
heights before the Arkansas game,
when he hired a troop of
professional incentive builders to
psych us up for the season opener.
It was absurd because he'd
tried the same thing and failed
before the previous season's
Southern Cal game. Actually, we
all kind of look forward to the
USC match. Many players on both
teams went to high school in
Southern California and knew
each other off the field. USC
always has one of the nation's
strongest teams, and it's enjoyable
to play against the best. Besides,
the game is a sellout, and each
player is usually able to scalp his
four free tickets for about a
hundred dollars.
Anyway, we were all herded
into a meeting room and faced

with a fellow in a business suit,
surrounded by charts.
"What kind of cow are you?"
he shouts. "Are you a praise cow?
I'm a praise cow. I want people to
give me praise; that's why I work
hard. Now, if you work hard,
you're going to get praise from all
your friends for beating USC."
Well, right there, the meeting
started going downhill. Guys were
laughing at him, and he began
getting desperate. Finally, he just
lost control and started doing an
imitation of Daffy Duck, like he
was Daffy Duck on a TV show
before he became an incentive
builder.
To be honest, he did a pretty
good Daffy Duck, but we lost to
USC anyway.
Not one to admit defeat,
Ralston invited a different crew of
pitchmen to build us up for the
Arkansas game. He introduced the
main speaker and mentioned that
after a single session, such as the
one we were about to experience,
sales usually shot up 12 percent.
Maybe we were supposed to sell

He handed one to linebacker
Dennis Moore, and Dennis

Dennis a second card but was
fixed with such a blood-chilling
stare that he stumbled back to the

called on our All America
quarterback, a guy who was to
win the Heisman Trophy, to stand
as an example of one who had
overcome hardships to achieve
success. Not a bad idea, except he
introduced him as Jerry Plunkett.
Even Jim, a straight arrow liked

broke up.
The first signs of rebellion

oration, Ralston stuck his head in
and shouted, "Two minutes!"
With that, everyone fied his
shoelaces and trudged out to
practice.
If only we had known what
had already taken place at Ohio
State, we probably wouldn't have
folded so easily. Ohio State Coach
Woody Hayes had taken his team
to the 1969 Rose Bowl and ran
what amounted to a military
camp while preparing for the

game. The sophomores on that
team were seniors now and
wanted no part of a repeat
performance when they came to
California this time.
I met several Ohio State
players during our trip to
Disneyland, and they told me that
all the seniors on the squad had
gone to Hayes with an ultimatum:
no two-a-day practices before the
game. When he heard that, Hayes
went a little crazy, he began
ranting and raving, but the players
knew they held the trump card
and refused to cave in. This time,
it was the coach who was forced
to compromise.
I'm repeating this story to
correct an illusion created by the
press before the Rose Bowl game.
It seems that Stanford's
reputation as the "Harvard of the
West" and Haves' reputation as a
hard-nosed martinet affected the
way both training camps were
covered.
According to the media, Ohio
State was holding rugged practice
sessions behind closed doors,
while the Stanford team was
taking it easy, treating the Rose
Bowl game as fun, just a way to
enjoy Christmas vacation. Woody
Hayes became the bad guy, and
easy-going John Ralston the good
guy-
It just wasn't so. In their
approach to college football, they
are both "bad guys."
Actually, it isn't all the coach's
fault. If he doesn't produce a
winner, he loses his job. An
unsettling prospect for a man like
Ralston with a wife and three
kids. I'm sure if the players had a
chance to know Ralston better
they would find him a very decent
guy, but he simply can't afford to
have that kind of relationship
with the team. Stanford must
average 40,000 paid spectators for
each home game to make money
with football. It's an economic
fact of life the coach has to live
with.
So football, which began as a
game run by students for
students, has, at several hundred
colleges and universities, been
wrested away from the players'
control. At Stanford, football is a
large and serious undertaking,
with eight full-time coaches, a
publicity man and numerous
other employees. The result is a
frantic coach and a squad of
understandably disgruntled
players.
These changing attitudes have
finally become obvious to the
coaches, and they are taking
precautions against a full-scale
â€¢rebellion. At least that's the case
at Stanford, which appears headed
for the ultimate bad-trip football
scene. They've begun recruiting
junior-college players in large
numbers. Most of these are
fellows who couldn't have gotten
into Stanford as freshmen, but
after two years at a junior college,
they can enter as juniors, with
two years of football eligibility
left.
Of course, things aren't all bad.
The other day, someone said that
college football must be fun at
some school.
I said, yes, it must be fun at
Pomona State. He said he'd never
heard of Pomona State.
That's why, I said, it must be
fun to play football there.

"Good-bye to ail that RAH,
RAH!" LOOK Magazine, October
5, 19 71 issue, by Tim McClure
with Jared Lebow, LOOK
Associate Sports Editor.
Reprinted with permission from
LOOK Magazine.
At this time last year, Tim
McClure was a defensive tackle on
the Stanford University football
team. A sinewy six-foot-two, he
was hardworking, intelligent and
aggressive. Everything a coach
could ash for. But something was
bothering him as he went through
the motions of blocking and
tackling in practice and in games.
"Playing football just wasn't
fun any more," he said, "and
when I sat down and thought
about it seriously, I realized that
at Stanford, it never had been
fun."
It bothered Tim that people
weren't seeing what they thought
they were seeing when they
watched a college football game,
that few realized how tightly
coaches controlled the lives of
their players or knew about the
drugs and the callous treatment of
injured athletes.

So he contacted LOOK and
asked us to help him tell his story.
"It appears to be accepted
doctrine that the coach must be a
tyrant," said McClure. "Merely
conditioning athletes is no longer
enough. Coaches feel they must
tell a player how to think. I went
through many changes in the last
four years, changes every college
student goes through.
Unfortunately, coaches don't like
to deal with change. It frightens
them. They don't seem to realize
that a real crisis faces them as
more and more athletes refuse to
become pawns in their silly games.
To survive, football will have to
undergo some radical changes. A
good beginning might be to give
control of the sport back to the
athletes. "
In high school, McClure had
been, in his words, "into
football." All that changed at
Stanford, where he found an
employee-employer relationship
between the staff and the team.
"It was strictly business. We really
didn't know the coaches, and they
really didn't know us except on
the most superficial level. "

Armed with a degree in
English, McClure was happy to
say goodbye to his four years of,
college foot jail last spring. This is
his farewell message:
Picture this: it's half time at
the 1971 Rose Bowl game,
Stanford versus Ohio State, and as
millions of football fans stare
blankly at their television sets, the
NCAA seal flashes across the
screen and the suddenly solemn
voice of Curt Gowdy reads the
following announcement: "Fie like
America's college athletes. Turn
on to sports, not to drugs."
Now let's switch to the
Stanford dressing room. Tired
young men in sweat-stained red
jerseys pull off their helmets and
collapse on wooden benches.
What's this? The pressure to win is
so great that some of the players,
without the coach's knowledge,
are removing little green capsules
from their lockers and popping
them into their mouths. Minutes
later, they begin to feel waves of
exhilaration. Their pupils dilate,

their eyes assume a saucer-like
shape. They are turning on.
But not to sports.
At Stanford, we called it
"beaning up," taking
amphetamines to get the heart
pumping faster and the body
functioning at an accelerated
pace. Most players swallow speed
out of self-defense, since the odds
are their opponents are also taking
the drug.
Last season, after the
University of California turned in
a particularly lackluster
performance against San Jose
State, a small-time football school
with big-time aspirations, I asked
a friend of mine on the Cal team
what happened. "Oh, it was
simple," he said. "We just ran out
of beans."
Sometimes even beans don't
help. Like when we were playing
Washington State in Spokane last
year and I wrecked my knee on
the artificial turf. Its boosters say
this kind of playing surface
reduces injuries, but that's not
what happened in my case. No
one hit me, I just slipped and
went flying, tearing ligaments and
cartilage. After that, I was just a
piece of broken machinery as far
as the coaching staff was
concerned. Not even my defensive

line coach stopped by the hospital
to say hello.
That was one of many reasons
1 was happy to graduate last June
and say good-bye to my four-year
career as a college football player.
But before I go into any more
details, let me set the record
straight. I'm no hippie-radical
dope-fiend-troublemaker. I was
just a guy trying to get a college
education who'd been misled.
You see, I always thought football
was a great game, and that games
were supposed to be for the
enjoyment of the athletes
involved. It didn't take me long to
discover that at the college level,
at least at those institutions in the
"major college football team"
category, football is not fun at all.
It is business, a very serious
business.
Well then, you may rightly ask,
if it was so horrible, how did a
bright young fellow like me get
sucked into it? For the answer, I
have to go back to my senior year

at Will C. Crawford High in San
Diego.
I was the ail-American kid,
captain of the football team, vice
president of the student body,
catcher on the baseball team. I
even dated the captain of the
cheerleader squad. It wasn't long
after my final high school game
that football recruiters from
various universities started
dropping by my home, buying me
steak dinners, inviting me on
all-expense-paid trips to their
campuses, when l they got me
dates and invitations to fraternity
parties. It was a pretty heady
experience for an 18-year-old boy.
But even then, naive as I was, I
began to suspect something was
wrong. Here were these
square-shouldered, close-cropped,
middle-aged men, clad in blue
blazers with their university's
insignia emblazoned on the
left-hand pocket, all trying to
convince me that the entire
athletic department and a sizable

portion of the student body were
desperately concerned that 1
choose their school.
One of the more unusual sales
pitches came from the Navy head
coach, Bill Elias. He was in San
Diego to visit some prospects and
invited me up to his hotel room.
My dad's a lieutenant
commander in the naval reserve,
and the idea of having a son at
Annapolis appealed to him, so he
came along.
There was Elias, sprawled
across a bed, elbow propped up
on a pillow, rapping about the
Academy's traditions, its
distinguished graduates and the
comradeship of the brigade of
midshipmen. Then, with a wry
smile, he informed us that getting
an appointment would be no
hassle since the athletic
department got those
appointments originally intended
for predominantly black
congressional districts. I guess
nobody gave a damn about
recruiting future black officers for
the Navy.
Anyway, I finally ended up at
Stanford, signing what was in
effect a four-year contract. I'd
play ball, and they'd give me
room, board, a little spending
money and, oh yes, a college
education.
I chose Stanford for a variety
of reasons. It's a prestige school,
one of the best in the nation, with
a strong academic program that
gives students the opportunity to
spend their junior year in Europe.
Later on I learned the football
coaches, who bragged about this
program when recruiting players,
weren't happy when players took
advantage of it, especially if spring
practice or, even worse, the
football season was missed.
In fact, the coaches had very
little concern with academics.
Football players are at Stanford
to play football. If they get an
education in the time that's left
over, fine. If not, well, they had
the chance, didn't they?
We reported for practice in
mid-August last year, a week
earlier than usual because an extra
game had been added to our
schedule. Costs had gone up, and
a new source of revenue had to be
found to balance the books. An
eleventh regular-season game was
that source. At first there was a
tinge of excitement, because we
were going to play Arkansas on
national television and it was a
chance to catapult Stanford into
the Top Ten. But once the
two-a-day practice sessions began,
that glow quickly wore off.
This was weeks before classes
started, and we were spending
about seven hours a day
practicing. Before it all began,
Head Coach John Ralston gave us
a little speech about how this was
the year Stanford was going to the
Rose Bowl and about how the
coaching staff was going to break
down our minds and bodies and
rebuild us.
Coach Ralston just loved little
homilies like that. Give him half a
chance, and he'd launch into his
"pain is a blessing because it keeps
players awake and alert" speech.

Let him catch a player easing
aching muscles in a whirlpool bath
and out came, "You can't make
the club in the tub." If a practice
session were being filmed, he'd
walk around saying, "You can't
get away from the eye in the
sky."
Sure it was all kind of funny,
but the thing was Ralston was
absolutely serious. He really
believed what he was saying.
At the gym entrance there's a
display of ex-Stanford greats now
in pro football. Each picture is a
testament to the coach's program,
implying that you, too, can be
like these famous pros if you just
follow our simple four-year,
knuckle-down planâ€”the unstated,
but implicit message being that
the ultimate goal of any college
athlete should be a career as a
professional athlete.
One of the Coach's major
concerns was hair. He hated it.
When Terrell Smith, an offensive
guard, showed up with a beard

and long locks, Ralston went into
his annual shape-up-or-get-out
tantrum. You can always tell the
football players at Stanford.
They're the guys with short hair.
This does wonders in further
segregating us from the rest of the
student body, many of whom
think we're dolts anyway. When
one of the football players, Steve
Jubb, hurt his ankle playing rugby
in the off season, the footbail
trainer refused to treat him
because he'd let his hair grow too
long, so he had to drag his
throbbing ankle to the barber
before he could get it taped by
the trainer.
This concern with hair is just a
part of Coach Ralston's effort to
control how his players look and
think. His attempts at
indoctrination reached absurd
heights before the Arkansas game,
when he hired a troop of
professional incentive builders to
psych us up for the season opener.
It was absurd because he'd
tried the same thing and failed
before the previous season's
Southern Cal game. Actually, we
all kind of look forward to the
USC match. Many players on both
teams went to high school in
Southern California and knew
each other off the field. USC
always has one of the nation's
strongest teams, and it's enjoyable
to play against the best. Besides,
the game is a sellout, and each
player is usually able to scalp his
four free tickets for about a
hundred dollars.
Anyway, we were all herded
into a meeting room and faced

with a fellow in a business suit,
surrounded by charts.
"What kind of cow are you?"
he shouts. "Are you a praise cow?
I'm a praise cow. I want people to
give me praise; that's why I work
hard. Now, if you work hard,
you're going to get praise from all
your friends for beating USC."
Well, right there, the meeting
started going downhill. Guys were
laughing at him, and he began
getting desperate. Finally, he just
lost control and started doing an
imitation of Daffy Duck, like he
was Daffy Duck on a TV show
before he became an incentive
builder.
To be honest, he did a pretty
good Daffy Duck, but we lost to
USC anyway.
Not one to admit defeat,
Ralston invited a different crew of
pitchmen to build us up for the
Arkansas game. He introduced the
main speaker and mentioned that
after a single session, such as the
one we were about to experience,
sales usually shot up 12 percent.
Maybe we were supposed to sell
our kneepads to the Arkansas
players.
"Who's going to win
Saturday?" shouted Mr. Incentive.
Dead silence. It was one o'clock,
hot and right in the middle of
two-a-day practices. When he
realized there would be no pep
rally, he changed tactics by
passing out blank cards and asking
us to write down what Coach
Ralston would say after the game.
He handed one to linebacker
Dennis Moore, and Dennis
dropped it. He tried to give
Dennis a second card but was
fixed with such a blood-chilling
stare that he stumbled back to the
platform. In a last-ditch effort, he
called on our All America
quarterback, a guy who was to
win the Heisman Trophy, to stand
as an example of one who had
overcome hardships to achieve
success. Not a bad idea, except he
introduced him as Jerry Plunkett.
Even Jim, a straight arrow liked
by both players and coaches,
broke up.
The first signs of rebellion
appeared when two of my
teammates, Jim Kauffman and
Dan Lightfoot, paid a visit to
Athletic Director Chuck Taylor.
The feeling was that if the players
had to report back early for an
extra game to make the athletic
department extra money, they
should get something in return.
The demands were trivialâ€”clean
athletic supporters and socks for
every practice, free blazers for our
road trips and a stop in Las Vegas
on the way back from Arkansas.

After much haggling, the demands
were met.
Well, we beat Arkansas, San
Jose State and Oregon before
losing to Purdue. Then we upset
USC, and flew up to Spokane to
play Washington State. It was a
pleasant afternoon for the
teamâ€”Stanford won 63-16â€”but a
painful one for me, because it was
that day my left knee was
wrecked.
I was still in the hospital when
Stanford won its next three
conference games before losing to
a non-conference opponent, the
Air Force Academy. The game
wasn't very important, and
Charles Saibel, one of our guards,
dropped by to say he was kind of
glad we lost, because Air Force
wanted to win so badly and it
made them so happy when they
did.
All in all, the season was a huge
success for the coaches. We
finished with an 8-3 record, won
the Pacific Coast Conference title
and received Stanford's first Rose
Bowl invitation in 19 years. When
we had our annual end-of-season
banquet following the Cal game,
everyone was in a good mood.
Coach Ralston needed only a few
minutes to shatter it.
As in the past, we all gathered
in a Cantonese restaurant, ate all
we could hold, kidded around and
in general relaxed after four
months of hard work.
Dinner completed, Bob
Murphy, the sports publicity
director, introduced Coach
Ralston as the West Coast Coach
of the Year and candidate for
national coach of the year.
Ralston thanked Murphy and then
declared he had little chance to
win the latter award with our 8-3
record since Bob Devaney of
Nebraska was 10-0 and Darrel
Royal of Texas was undefeated
and Ara Parseghian had lost only
one. Then he began berating us
for the two late-season losses to
Air Force and California. By now,
we had braced ourselves for a
most unpleasant evening.
After condemning us for those
losses, Ralston dismissed the past
11 games and launched into an
account of what the future held.
There would be 20 days of
practice in preparation for the
Rose Bowl, including six days of
two-a-day workouts during our
Christmas vacations. Bitterly, he
added there were rumors about
our being unhappy with two-a-day
workouts and that this disgusted
him.
We began practice two days
before finals' week. Since football
takes from four to five hours a
day during the regular season,
most of the players felt this
climactic imposition was a bit
much. Because of it, many found
themselves in academic trouble.
We arrived in Pasadena on
December 22, and a strict 10:30
p.m. curfew was imposed. A fleet
of fancy cars provided for our use
never left their parking spaces.
Other than a visit to Disneyland
and an awards banquet, we had to
spend our free time between
practice sessions viewing football
films of ourselves and Ohio State.
After five days of this, Dan
Lightfoot, an offensive guard, and
I called a meeting to discuss our
grievances. Thirty-five members of
the 50-man squad showed up; the
rest had failed to hear about the
meeting. All present, except
co-captains Jack Shultz and
Plunkett, felt two practice
sessions a day was one too many
and that the curfew was too early.
Demea Washington, split end,
suggested sending a delegation to

Ralston to urge an end to daily
double-practice sessions.
So Demea, Ron Kadziel, a
linebacker, and Schultz and
Plunkett were chosen to visit
Ralston's suite. Sending the
captains along was a bad decision.
Throughout the season both had
been Ralston's strongest
supporters. Although sincere in
offering to communicate the
team's grievances, they found it
an impossible task because neither

one could understand why any
player would contradict his coach
in the first place.
Sensing the outcome, Demea
spoke up. He told Ralston of the
team's dissatisfaction, and the
Coach promised a conciliatory
message the next morning.
Before his talk, we held
another meeting. By this time,
sentiment was running high in
favor of refusing to practice if our
complaints weren't taken into
account. We decided to hear
Ralston out, then, depending on
his message, plan a course of
action.
A master of the emotional
appeal, Ralston managed to abort
our rebellion without losing a
minute of practice time. He
simply threatened to resign if he
couldn't have complete control of
the team. We just caved in.
He made a short, but very
effective, speech and then left the
locker room. For several minutes
we sat in silence, until Jim
Kauffman said something to the
effect that we should let him have
his way this time. Then, just
before the whole squad swung
passively behind the Coach, Dan
Lightfoot tried to swing the team
back to its original position. He
warned against bowing to Coach
Ralston when we thought our
grievances were justified.
Demea Washington followed
with a fiery answer to Ralston.
"As long as football players stay
lily-white, men like Ralston will
continue to coach. And I'm not
talking about skin color," he
shouted. "When ballplayers start
realizing they don't have to take
everything that comes down on
them, things are really gonna
change."

concerned. Not even my defensive

line coach stopped by the hospital
to say hello.
That was one of many reasons
1 was happy to graduate last June
and say good-bye to my four-year
career as a college football player.
But before I go into any more
details, let me set the record
straight. I'm no hippie-radical
dope-fiend-troublemaker. I was
just a guy trying to get a college
education who'd been misled.
You see, I always thought football
was a great game, and that games
were supposed to be for the
enjoyment of the athletes
involved. It didn't take me long to
discover that at the college level,
at least at those institutions in the
"major college football team"
category, football is not fun at all.
It is business, a very serious
business.
Well then, you may rightly ask,
if it was so horrible, how did a
bright young fellow like me get
sucked into it? For the answer, I
have to go back to my senior year

at Will C. Crawford High in San
Diego.
I was the ail-American kid,
captain of the football team, vice
president of the student body,
catcher on the baseball team. I
even dated the captain of the
cheerleader squad. It wasn't long
after my final high school game
that football recruiters from
various universities started
dropping by my home, buying me
steak dinners, inviting me on
all-expense-paid trips to their
campuses, when l they got me
dates and invitations to fraternity
parties. It was a pretty heady
experience for an 18-year-old boy.
But even then, naive as I was, I
began to suspect something was
wrong. Here were these
square-shouldered, close-cropped,
middle-aged men, clad in blue
blazers with their university's
insignia emblazoned on the
left-hand pocket, all trying to
convince me that the entire
athletic department and a sizable

portion of the student body were
desperately concerned that 1
choose their school.
One of the more unusual sales
pitches came from the Navy head
coach, Bill Elias. He was in San
Diego to visit some prospects and
invited me up to his hotel room.
My dad's a lieutenant
commander in the naval reserve,
and the idea of having a son at
Annapolis appealed to him, so he
came along.
There was Elias, sprawled
across a bed, elbow propped up
on a pillow, rapping about the
Academy's traditions, its
distinguished graduates and the
comradeship of the brigade of
midshipmen. Then, with a wry
smile, he informed us that getting
an appointment would be no
hassle since the athletic
department got those
appointments originally intended
for predominantly black
congressional districts. I guess
nobody gave a damn about
recruiting future black officers for
the Navy.
Anyway, I finally ended up at
Stanford, signing what was in
effect a four-year contract. I'd
play ball, and they'd give me
room, board, a little spending
money and, oh yes, a college
education.
I chose Stanford for a variety
of reasons. It's a prestige school,
one of the best in the nation, with
a strong academic program that
gives students the opportunity to
spend their junior year in Europe.
Later on I learned the football
coaches, who bragged about this
program when recruiting players,
weren't happy when players took
advantage of it, especially if spring
practice or, even worse, the
football season was missed.
In fact, the coaches had very
little concern with academics.
Football players are at Stanford
to play football. If they get an
education in the time that's left
over, fine. If not, well, they had
the chance, didn't they?
We reported for practice in
mid-August last year, a week
earlier than usual because an extra
game had been added to our
schedule. Costs had gone up, and
a new source of revenue had to be
found to balance the books. An
eleventh regular-season game was
that source. At first there was a
tinge of excitement, because we
were going to play Arkansas on
national television and it was a
chance to catapult Stanford into
the Top Ten. But once the
two-a-day practice sessions began,
that glow quickly wore off.
This was weeks before classes
started, and we were spending
about seven hours a day
practicing. Before it all began,
Head Coach John Ralston gave us
a little speech about how this was
the year Stanford was going to the
Rose Bowl and about how the
coaching staff was going to break
down our minds and bodies and
rebuild us.
Coach Ralston just loved little
homilies like that. Give him half a
chance, and he'd launch into his
"pain is a blessing because it keeps
players awake and alert" speech.

Let him catch a player easing
aching muscles in a whirlpool bath
and out came, "You can't make
the club in the tub." If a practice
session were being filmed, he'd
walk around saying, "You can't
get away from the eye in the
sky."
Sure it was all kind of funny,
but the thing was Ralston was
absolutely serious. He really
believed what he was saying.
At the gym entrance there's a
display of ex-Stanford greats now
in pro football. Each picture is a
testament to the coach's program,
implying that you, too, can be
like these famous pros if you just
follow our simple four-year,
knuckle-down planâ€”the unstated,
but implicit message being that
the ultimate goal of any college
athlete should be a career as a
professional athlete.
One of the Coach's major
concerns was hair. He hated it.
When Terrell Smith, an offensive
guard, showed up with a beard

and long locks, Ralston went into
his annual shape-up-or-get-out
tantrum. You can always tell the
football players at Stanford.
They're the guys with short hair.
This does wonders in further
segregating us from the rest of the
student body, many of whom
think we're dolts anyway. When
one of the football players, Steve
Jubb, hurt his ankle playing rugby
in the off season, the footbail
trainer refused to treat him
because he'd let his hair grow too
long, so he had to drag his
throbbing ankle to the barber
before he could get it taped by
the trainer.
This concern with hair is just a
part of Coach Ralston's effort to
control how his players look and
think. His attempts at
indoctrination reached absurd
heights before the Arkansas game,
when he hired a troop of
professional incentive builders to
psych us up for the season opener.
It was absurd because he'd
tried the same thing and failed
before the previous season's
Southern Cal game. Actually, we
all kind of look forward to the
USC match. Many players on both
teams went to high school in
Southern California and knew
each other off the field. USC
always has one of the nation's
strongest teams, and it's enjoyable
to play against the best. Besides,
the game is a sellout, and each
player is usually able to scalp his
four free tickets for about a
hundred dollars.
Anyway, we were all herded
into a meeting room and faced

with a fellow in a business suit,
surrounded by charts.
"What kind of cow are you?"
he shouts. "Are you a praise cow?
I'm a praise cow. I want people to
give me praise; that's why I work
hard. Now, if you work hard,
you're going to get praise from all
your friends for beating USC."
Well, right there, the meeting
started going downhill. Guys were
laughing at him, and he began
getting desperate. Finally, he just
lost control and started doing an
imitation of Daffy Duck, like he
was Daffy Duck on a TV show
before he became an incentive
builder.
To be honest, he did a pretty
good Daffy Duck, but we lost to
USC anyway.
Not one to admit defeat,
Ralston invited a different crew of
pitchmen to build us up for the
Arkansas game. He introduced the
main speaker and mentioned that
after a single session, such as the
one we were about to experience,
sales usually shot up 12 percent.
Maybe we were supposed to sell
our kneepads to the Arkansas
players.
"Who's going to win
Saturday?" shouted Mr. Incentive.
Dead silence. It was one o'clock,
hot and right in the middle of
two-a-day practices. When he
realized there would be no pep
rally, he changed tactics by
passing out blank cards and asking
us to write down what Coach
Ralston would say after the game.
He handed one to linebacker
Dennis Moore, and Dennis
dropped it. He tried to give
Dennis a second card but was
fixed with such a blood-chilling
stare that he stumbled back to the
platform. In a last-ditch effort, he
called on our All America
quarterback, a guy who was to
win the Heisman Trophy, to stand
as an example of one who had
overcome hardships to achieve
success. Not a bad idea, except he
introduced him as Jerry Plunkett.
Even Jim, a straight arrow liked
by both players and coaches,
broke up.
The first signs of rebellion
appeared when two of my
teammates, Jim Kauffman and
Dan Lightfoot, paid a visit to
Athletic Director Chuck Taylor.
The feeling was that if the players
had to report back early for an
extra game to make the athletic
department extra money, they
should get something in return.
The demands were trivialâ€”clean
athletic supporters and socks for
every practice, free blazers for our
road trips and a stop in Las Vegas
on the way back from Arkansas.

After much haggling, the demands
were met.
Well, we beat Arkansas, San
Jose State and Oregon before
losing to Purdue. Then we upset
USC, and flew up to Spokane to
play Washington State. It was a
pleasant afternoon for the
teamâ€”Stanford won 63-16â€”but a
painful one for me, because it was
that day my left knee was
wrecked.
I was still in the hospital when
Stanford won its next three
conference games before losing to
a non-conference opponent, the
Air Force Academy. The game
wasn't very important, and
Charles Saibel, one of our guards,
dropped by to say he was kind of
glad we lost, because Air Force
wanted to win so badly and it
made them so happy when they
did.
All in all, the season was a huge
success for the coaches. We
finished with an 8-3 record, won
the Pacific Coast Conference title
and received Stanford's first Rose
Bowl invitation in 19 years. When
we had our annual end-of-season
banquet following the Cal game,
everyone was in a good mood.
Coach Ralston needed only a few
minutes to shatter it.
As in the past, we all gathered
in a Cantonese restaurant, ate all
we could hold, kidded around and
in general relaxed after four
months of hard work.
Dinner completed, Bob
Murphy, the sports publicity
director, introduced Coach
Ralston as the West Coast Coach
of the Year and candidate for
national coach of the year.
Ralston thanked Murphy and then
declared he had little chance to
win the latter award with our 8-3
record since Bob Devaney of
Nebraska was 10-0 and Darrel
Royal of Texas was undefeated
and Ara Parseghian had lost only
one. Then he began berating us
for the two late-season losses to
Air Force and California. By now,
we had braced ourselves for a
most unpleasant evening.
After condemning us for those
losses, Ralston dismissed the past
11 games and launched into an
account of what the future held.
There would be 20 days of
practice in preparation for the
Rose Bowl, including six days of
two-a-day workouts during our
Christmas vacations. Bitterly, he
added there were rumors about
our being unhappy with two-a-day
workouts and that this disgusted
him.
We began practice two days
before finals' week. Since football
takes from four to five hours a
day during the regular season,
most of the players felt this
climactic imposition was a bit
much. Because of it, many found
themselves in academic trouble.
We arrived in Pasadena on
December 22, and a strict 10:30
p.m. curfew was imposed. A fleet
of fancy cars provided for our use
never left their parking spaces.
Other than a visit to Disneyland
and an awards banquet, we had to
spend our free time between
practice sessions viewing football
films of ourselves and Ohio State.
After five days of this, Dan
Lightfoot, an offensive guard, and
I called a meeting to discuss our
grievances. Thirty-five members of
the 50-man squad showed up; the
rest had failed to hear about the
meeting. All present, except
co-captains Jack Shultz and
Plunkett, felt two practice
sessions a day was one too many
and that the curfew was too early.
Demea Washington, split end,
suggested sending a delegation to

Ralston to urge an end to daily
double-practice sessions.
So Demea, Ron Kadziel, a
linebacker, and Schultz and
Plunkett were chosen to visit
Ralston's suite. Sending the
captains along was a bad decision.
Throughout the season both had
been Ralston's strongest
supporters. Although sincere in
offering to communicate the
team's grievances, they found it
an impossible task because neither

one could understand why any
player would contradict his coach
in the first place.
Sensing the outcome, Demea
spoke up. He told Ralston of the
team's dissatisfaction, and the
Coach promised a conciliatory
message the next morning.
Before his talk, we held
another meeting. By this time,
sentiment was running high in
favor of refusing to practice if our
complaints weren't taken into
account. We decided to hear
Ralston out, then, depending on
his message, plan a course of
action.
A master of the emotional
appeal, Ralston managed to abort
our rebellion without losing a
minute of practice time. He
simply threatened to resign if he
couldn't have complete control of
the team. We just caved in.
He made a short, but very
effective, speech and then left the
locker room. For several minutes
we sat in silence, until Jim
Kauffman said something to the
effect that we should let him have
his way this time. Then, just
before the whole squad swung
passively behind the Coach, Dan
Lightfoot tried to swing the team
back to its original position. He
warned against bowing to Coach
Ralston when we thought our
grievances were justified.
Demea Washington followed
with a fiery answer to Ralston.
"As long as football players stay
lily-white, men like Ralston will
continue to coach. And I'm not
talking about skin color," he
shouted. "When ballplayers start
realizing they don't have to take
everything that comes down on
them, things are really gonna
change."
Seconds after Demea's fierv

oration, Ralston stuck his head in
and shouted, "Two minutes!"
With that, everyone fied his
shoelaces and trudged out to
practice.
If only we had known what
had already taken place at Ohio
State, we probably wouldn't have
folded so easily. Ohio State Coach
Woody Hayes had taken his team
to the 1969 Rose Bowl and ran
what amounted to a military
camp while preparing for the

game. The sophomores on that
team were seniors now and
wanted no part of a repeat
performance when they came to
California this time.
I met several Ohio State
players during our trip to
Disneyland, and they told me that
all the seniors on the squad had
gone to Hayes with an ultimatum:
no two-a-day practices before the
game. When he heard that, Hayes
went a little crazy, he began
ranting and raving, but the players
knew they held the trump card
and refused to cave in. This time,
it was the coach who was forced
to compromise.
I'm repeating this story to
correct an illusion created by the
press before the Rose Bowl game.
It seems that Stanford's
reputation as the "Harvard of the
West" and Haves' reputation as a
hard-nosed martinet affected the
way both training camps were
covered.
According to the media, Ohio
State was holding rugged practice
sessions behind closed doors,
while the Stanford team was
taking it easy, treating the Rose
Bowl game as fun, just a way to
enjoy Christmas vacation. Woody
Hayes became the bad guy, and
easy-going John Ralston the good
guy-
It just wasn't so. In their
approach to college football, they
are both "bad guys."
Actually, it isn't all the coach's
fault. If he doesn't produce a
winner, he loses his job. An
unsettling prospect for a man like
Ralston with a wife and three
kids. I'm sure if the players had a
chance to know Ralston better
they would find him a very decent
guy, but he simply can't afford to
have that kind of relationship
with the team. Stanford must
average 40,000 paid spectators for
each home game to make money
with football. It's an economic
fact of life the coach has to live
with.
So football, which began as a
game run by students for
students, has, at several hundred
colleges and universities, been
wrested away from the players'
control. At Stanford, football is a
large and serious undertaking,
with eight full-time coaches, a
publicity man and numerous
other employees. The result is a
frantic coach and a squad of
understandably disgruntled
players.
These changing attitudes have
finally become obvious to the
coaches, and they are taking
precautions against a full-scale
â€¢rebellion. At least that's the case
at Stanford, which appears headed
for the ultimate bad-trip football
scene. They've begun recruiting
junior-college players in large
numbers. Most of these are
fellows who couldn't have gotten
into Stanford as freshmen, but
after two years at a junior college,
they can enter as juniors, with
two years of football eligibility
left.
Of course, things aren't all bad.
The other day, someone said that
college football must be fun at
some school.
I said, yes, it must be fun at
Pomona State. He said he'd never
heard of Pomona State.
That's why, I said, it must be
fun to play football there.


Okay guys this
is a tough one. lets
all swallow hard
and try to win one
for the pus her.
