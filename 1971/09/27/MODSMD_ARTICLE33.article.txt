Alaska Pipeline Delayed
WASHINGTON — Secretary of the Interior Rogers C.
B. Morton in effect ruled out Sunday any 1971 start
on a transalaska oil pipeline. And he hinted strongly
that oil from Alaska's North Slope may ultimately go
to market through Canada.
Morton acknowledged that he would be unable to
meet his tentative deadline of October for a decision
on the much-disputed project to bring oil down from
the new field on the North Slope. And he implied
that it may be months before the decision is m;>de.
He said he would not act until he consults other
federal agencies and until "I am sure that the total
spirit of the Environmental Policy Act has been
complied with."
Morton said that one thing holding up the final
decision is that in the mass of material submitted by
the Alyeska Company which wants to build the
pipeline there were "some discrepancies and some
elements that were not congruent with the
stipulations which we had made and which we
thought the company had agreed to."
He said another delaying factor is the study of
alternative routes as required by the Environmental
Policy Act. He added "The major viable alternative is
a pipeline over another route, most of which would
actually be on Canadian land." This would be an
alternative to the Alaska plan to run the pipeline to
the Alaska port of Valdez and then ship it by tanker
to the West Coast.
Morton said that a routing through Canada would
require extensive negotiations with Canadian
authorities and added that, as far as he knows, no
application for construction of a pipeline from the
North Slope through Canada has even been lodged
with the Interior Department or with Canada.
But he said that there apparently is going to be a
gas pipeline from the North Slope through Canada

"because compressing the gas and transporting it by
ship is not practical."
Nixon To Meet Hirohito
PORTLAND, Ore. — President Nixon, heading for
Alaska and his historic meeting with Emperor
Hirohito of Japan, scheduled two stops at an atomic
plant at Richland, Wash., to make an unspecified
announcement Sunday about nuclear energy.
The President meets Emperor Hirohito at
Elmendorf Air Force Base near Anchorage. It will be
the first time in history that a Japanese ruler has
stepped on foreign soil. The meeting with the
emperor indicates the beginning of a totally new era
in the relationship between the United States and
Japan, Nixon said.
"The people who were enemies," he said, "can and
must be friends. Japan and the United States must
never be enemies again."
The President also will attend in Anchorage a
reception at the home of the man he fired as
secretary of the interior, Walter J. Hickel, the former
governor of Alaska. It will be their first meeting since
Hickel was removed from the job last year.
Chinese Newscast Expected
TOKYO — Communist China maintained a lid
Sunday on unexplained developments in the country,
but Canton television said it would carry a "special
and important" newscast Tuesday night after
"circumstances of the commemoration" of the Red
Regime's National Day.
Abrupt cancellation of the massive celebration led
to rumors that Communist party Chairman Mao
Tse-tung was either dead or seriously ill.

Canton radio indicated the telecast would
originate in Peking.
It was believed in Hong Kong that the telecast
would give Peking's official reasons for sudden
cancellation of the traditional celebration and parade,
which has been staged in Peking and attended by Mao
every Oct. 1 since the Communists took over the
mainland.
A Chinese traveler just returned from Canton to
Hong Kong said the Sunday television announcement
described the telecast as "of great importance to the
people" and urged that "all persons should make
arrangements to see and hear it."
New Wage Increase Sought
WASHINGTON — The Senate Labor Committee is
proceeding with plans to try to boost the
$1.60-an-hour minimum wage to $2.25 even though
this might run afoul of President Nixon's Phase 2
economic program.
Sen. Harrison A. Williams Jr., D-N.J. the
committee chairman and chief sponsor of the $2.25
proposal, said in a statement Sunday his panel will
wind up public hearings this week. "Then we will go
into executive session and start to work on the bill.
"We will have to see what impact the President's
program will have on our legislation when it is
announced.
"But we still see a strong need for a higher
minimum wage. The present minimum does not even
provide a poverty-level income."
Congress almost certainly will not complete action
on such a bill before the present wage-price freeze
expires in mid-November.
However, there have been indications the Phase 2
program will include wage stabilization measures
which might be tied to annual productivity increases.

that oil from Alaska's North Slope may ultimately go
to market through Canada.
Morton acknowledged that he would be unable to
meet his tentative deadline of October for a decision
on the much-disputed project to bring oil down from
the new field on the North Slope. And he implied
that it may be months before the decision is m;>de.
He said he would not act until he consults other
federal agencies and until "I am sure that the total
spirit of the Environmental Policy Act has been
complied with."
Morton said that one thing holding up the final
decision is that in the mass of material submitted by
the Alyeska Company which wants to build the
pipeline there were "some discrepancies and some
elements that were not congruent with the
stipulations which we had made and which we
thought the company had agreed to."
He said another delaying factor is the study of
alternative routes as required by the Environmental
Policy Act. He added "The major viable alternative is
a pipeline over another route, most of which would
actually be on Canadian land." This would be an
alternative to the Alaska plan to run the pipeline to
the Alaska port of Valdez and then ship it by tanker
to the West Coast.
Morton said that a routing through Canada would
require extensive negotiations with Canadian
authorities and added that, as far as he knows, no
application for construction of a pipeline from the
North Slope through Canada has even been lodged
with the Interior Department or with Canada.
But he said that there apparently is going to be a
gas pipeline from the North Slope through Canada

"because compressing the gas and transporting it by
ship is not practical."
Nixon To Meet Hirohito
PORTLAND, Ore. — President Nixon, heading for
Alaska and his historic meeting with Emperor
Hirohito of Japan, scheduled two stops at an atomic
plant at Richland, Wash., to make an unspecified
announcement Sunday about nuclear energy.
The President meets Emperor Hirohito at
Elmendorf Air Force Base near Anchorage. It will be
the first time in history that a Japanese ruler has
stepped on foreign soil. The meeting with the
emperor indicates the beginning of a totally new era
in the relationship between the United States and
Japan, Nixon said.
"The people who were enemies," he said, "can and
must be friends. Japan and the United States must
never be enemies again."
The President also will attend in Anchorage a
reception at the home of the man he fired as
secretary of the interior, Walter J. Hickel, the former
governor of Alaska. It will be their first meeting since
Hickel was removed from the job last year.
Chinese Newscast Expected
TOKYO — Communist China maintained a lid
Sunday on unexplained developments in the country,
but Canton television said it would carry a "special
and important" newscast Tuesday night after
"circumstances of the commemoration" of the Red
Regime's National Day.
Abrupt cancellation of the massive celebration led
to rumors that Communist party Chairman Mao
Tse-tung was either dead or seriously ill.

Canton radio indicated the telecast would
originate in Peking.
It was believed in Hong Kong that the telecast
would give Peking's official reasons for sudden
cancellation of the traditional celebration and parade,
which has been staged in Peking and attended by Mao
every Oct. 1 since the Communists took over the
mainland.
A Chinese traveler just returned from Canton to
Hong Kong said the Sunday television announcement
described the telecast as "of great importance to the
people" and urged that "all persons should make
arrangements to see and hear it."
New Wage Increase Sought
WASHINGTON — The Senate Labor Committee is
proceeding with plans to try to boost the
$1.60-an-hour minimum wage to $2.25 even though
this might run afoul of President Nixon's Phase 2
economic program.
Sen. Harrison A. Williams Jr., D-N.J. the
committee chairman and chief sponsor of the $2.25
proposal, said in a statement Sunday his panel will
wind up public hearings this week. "Then we will go
into executive session and start to work on the bill.
"We will have to see what impact the President's
program will have on our legislation when it is
announced.
"But we still see a strong need for a higher
minimum wage. The present minimum does not even
provide a poverty-level income."
Congress almost certainly will not complete action
on such a bill before the present wage-price freeze
expires in mid-November.
However, there have been indications the Phase 2
program will include wage stabilization measures
which might be tied to annual productivity increases.
