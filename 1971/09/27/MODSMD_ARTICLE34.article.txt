# Freshmen Uncertain Over New Draft Law
## 
### 
The recently passed military draft
extension law most likely will not
significantly affect college and
university enrollment this year or next.
But it will immediately increase the
uncertainty felt by unclassified
incoming freshmen males.
The law, passed by the U.S. Senate,
55-30, last Tuesday, reinstates the
President's power to induct men into
the armed forces, a privilege
suspended since the previous draft law
had expired last July 1. The new law
ends the granting of student deferments
to college undergraduates beginning
with this year's incoming class.
(Deferments for graduate students were
dropped three years ago.)
Men who currently hold student
(2-S) deferments will be allowed to
keep them, but men entering their first
year now will not be guaranteed four
years to finish college before being
drafted. Medical disability and extreme
hardship deferments will still be
available.
Selective service officials have
announced those holding lottery
numbers over 140 will not be called
this year, and those over 100 will be
safe during 1 9 72. By July of 1 973 ,
when the new draft law expires, draft
calls are expected to fall to zero
according to the Department of
Defense.
Since the majority of incoming
freshmen have not yet turned 19, 40
percent are under 18, they have not
been tabbed by the lottery system, and

their immediate concern over the draft
is distant. As freshman Larry Reed, 18 ,
of Barrington, New Jersey, said, "I
haven't let the draft interfere with any
of my thinking. I'm a long way away
from receiving a lottery number, and
I'm here (at Stanford) to go to school,
not worry about what will happen next
year."
Jim Davies, 19, of Lancaster, Pa.,
expressed fear over being drafted out of
college due to the new law and his low
lottery number. "I'm dead," he
mumbled. But Roy Slice, 18, of
Livermore, stated the new law came as
no surprise. He voiced the feelings of
most of those freshmen questioned,
saying, "We had all heard of this bill at
the time we were starting to apply for
college. But since I won't find out for a
while what my draft number will be,
I'm enrolling in school for as long as I
can. That's at least one year."
"The government is beginning to
defuse the draft as an issue," said Alan
Strain, head of the draft counseling
services headquartered in the Old
Union. "But the problems with the
system are still overwhelming.
"We are certainly moving in the
direction of at least a zero draft call,
but I'm afraid that moving toward an
all-volunteer force by mid-1 973 , with
the power of the President to induct
men still intact, would result in
preserving the worst of both systems.
The dangers inherent in the volunteer
system are evident to everyone . . . and
with induction powers remaining, the
potential of a draft still remains."

Strain, whose office usually counsels
30 to 50 men per day, is personally
opposed to the entire institution of
selective service. "Most of the changes
in the draft laws are merely tinkering
by the government to make the thing
less controversial. We hope our office
can clarify some of the mysteries facing
men of draft age."
He also has serious reservations
about the fairness of operating a draft
counseling service at Stanford, where

men are more apt to be already
knowledgeable about the intracacies of
the draft. "I often get the feeling that
we are increasing the inequities of the
draft by helping the advantaged with
more advantages," Strain said.
In order to spread knowledge of the
draft laws around more equitably, paid
interns are trained through the
Stanford office and urged to go set up
their own draft counseling centers in
minority communities.

hardship deferments will still be
available.
Selective service officials have
announced those holding lottery
numbers over 140 will not be called
this year, and those over 100 will be
safe during 1 9 72. By July of 1 973 ,
when the new draft law expires, draft
calls are expected to fall to zero
according to the Department of
Defense.
Since the majority of incoming
freshmen have not yet turned 19, 40
percent are under 18, they have not
been tabbed by the lottery system, and

their immediate concern over the draft
is distant. As freshman Larry Reed, 18 ,
of Barrington, New Jersey, said, "I
haven't let the draft interfere with any
of my thinking. I'm a long way away
from receiving a lottery number, and
I'm here (at Stanford) to go to school,
not worry about what will happen next
year."
Jim Davies, 19, of Lancaster, Pa.,
expressed fear over being drafted out of
college due to the new law and his low
lottery number. "I'm dead," he
mumbled. But Roy Slice, 18, of
Livermore, stated the new law came as
no surprise. He voiced the feelings of
most of those freshmen questioned,
saying, "We had all heard of this bill at
the time we were starting to apply for
college. But since I won't find out for a
while what my draft number will be,
I'm enrolling in school for as long as I
can. That's at least one year."
"The government is beginning to
defuse the draft as an issue," said Alan
Strain, head of the draft counseling
services headquartered in the Old
Union. "But the problems with the
system are still overwhelming.
"We are certainly moving in the
direction of at least a zero draft call,
but I'm afraid that moving toward an
all-volunteer force by mid-1 973 , with
the power of the President to induct
men still intact, would result in
preserving the worst of both systems.
The dangers inherent in the volunteer
system are evident to everyone . . . and
with induction powers remaining, the
potential of a draft still remains."

Strain, whose office usually counsels
30 to 50 men per day, is personally
opposed to the entire institution of
selective service. "Most of the changes
in the draft laws are merely tinkering
by the government to make the thing
less controversial. We hope our office
can clarify some of the mysteries facing
men of draft age."
He also has serious reservations
about the fairness of operating a draft
counseling service at Stanford, where

men are more apt to be already
knowledgeable about the intracacies of
the draft. "I often get the feeling that
we are increasing the inequities of the
draft by helping the advantaged with
more advantages," Strain said.
In order to spread knowledge of the
draft laws around more equitably, paid
interns are trained through the
Stanford office and urged to go set up
their own draft counseling centers in
minority communities.
The recently passed military draft
extension law most likely will not
significantly affect college and
university enrollment this year or next.
But it will immediately increase the
uncertainty felt by unclassified
incoming freshmen males.
The law, passed by the U.S. Senate,
55-30, last Tuesday, reinstates the
President's power to induct men into
the armed forces, a privilege
suspended since the previous draft law
had expired last July 1. The new law
ends the granting of student deferments
to college undergraduates beginning
with this year's incoming class.
(Deferments for graduate students were
dropped three years ago.)
Men who currently hold student
(2-S) deferments will be allowed to
keep them, but men entering their first
year now will not be guaranteed four
years to finish college before being
drafted. Medical disability and extreme
hardship deferments will still be
available.
