# Housing Shortage
## 
### 
Unlike most major universities in the
nation, Stanford is faced with a
large-scale deficit of campus housing
spaces this year. According to assistant
dean of students in charge of housing
Larry Horton, there are 354 students
on the current waiting list, including 29
unassigned males- from last spring's
draw, 132 male transfers, 8 4 female
transfers, 61 off campus males, and 48
off-campus females.
With 80 percent of Stanford's
undergraduates living on campus this
fall, Horton views his two major
problems as housing for graduate
students and for transfers. To overcome
the high waiting list, Horton has
instituted several innovations into the
campus housing picture.
"First of all," explains Horton,
"we've changed the notification system
for students waiting for space on
campus. These on the list must now
check the list in the Residence Office
to confirm their housing. Before, this
was the responsibility of the individual
houses, and they often couldn't contact
the replacements.
"The other major change," Horton
continued, "is that the current waiting
list expires at 5 p.m. on Tuesday, the
second day of registration. Students
wishing to remain on the list must
contact me by then to maintain their
priority on the updated list.
"Our objective this year is to fill
each opening in four hours," Horton
declared.
Last week in Campus Report, the
housing office issued an appeal to the
faculty for temporary living quarters.
So far, Horton said he had received
three replies—one of those offering
space was Larry Horton.
College Management, a journal for
administrators, reported early this
month that "dormitories 25 percent
empty are commonplace" across the
country.
Horton attributed empty dorms in

some other places to the fact that
"other schools' dorms are run like
penitentiaries. 1 credit our campus
housing's popularity to the
extraordinary degree of local autonomy
they wield. We must be doing
something right."
Preparations are already underway
for the construction of Escondido V.
The fifth increment to the Escondido
complex should be ready for
occupation by fall quarter, 1 972. Unit
IV, opening this fall, will provide spaces
for 500 persons in two 11 -story
high-rise apartment buildings and six
two-story residence units.
"I'm looking forward to a good year
and I'm living off campus," Horton
concluded.
