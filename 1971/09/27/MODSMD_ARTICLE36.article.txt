The California Supreme Court
last week unanimously upheld the
conviction of Stanford student
John Lanthier for possession of
marijuana in the Stanford library
on January 13, 1969.
Joseph Riley, a guard in the
library, discovered the evil weed
in Lanthier's locker after students
in the study hall complained of a
foul odor. Opening all the student
lockers, Riley discovered 38 lids
in the last locker he searched.
A preservative added to the
grass caused it to project a
powerful and unpleasant odor.
Lanthier claimed that his
constitutional right preventing
unreasonable search and seizure
was violated by Riley's opening of
the locker without a warrant.
The High Court did not agree
with Lanthier, however, ruling
that the foul smell coming from
Lanthier's locker created an
emergency, justifying Riley's
search without a warrant.
