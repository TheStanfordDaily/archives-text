# Tenure To Be Tested
## Franklin Case Begins 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
Associate English Professor H. Bruce
Franklin will fight the administration's
attempt to fire him in a dismissal
hearing beginning tomorrow.
Franklin, a well-known leader of the
revolutionary group Venceremos, has
been charged by administrators with
inciting violence, failure to disperse
Horn a disturbance, and disrupting
campus activities in events last January
and February.
The charges will be heard by a
seven-man Advisory Board of full
professors, chaired by Biology
Professor Donald Kennedy. The Board
has announced an extensive thirty-hour
a week schedule for public hearings in
the complicated case. Beginning
tomorrow, hearings will be held every
afternoon, Monday through Saturday,
1 to 6 p.m.
Physics Room 101 has been turned
into a courtroom for the hearing. Forty
seats in the lecture hall will be reserved
for Academic Council members every
day, and another 40 seats will be
available to the general public on a
first-come, first-served basis. The
hearing will be telecast by closed-circuit
television to two other classrooms
seating about 350, and it will be
broadcast on KZSU.
President Richard Lyman suspended

Franklin with pay, February 13, and
asked for his dismissal. The Advisory
Board had scheduled hearings during
the summer, but Franklin obtained a
delay by arguing witnesses he needed
would be out of town during the
summer.
Lyman charged Franklin with
activities "which have constituted a
substantial and manifest neglect" of his
duties at the University. The alleged
acts include participation in a
disruption of a speech by Henry Cabot
Lodge, former ambassador to South
Vietnam. Franklin also is charged with
encouraging a mill-in at the
Computation Center, urging
participants to refuse to disperse from
that protest, and inciting disruption at
a nighttime rally.
Franklin, a Stanford professor since
1961, charges the University is trying
to oust him on false charges because
"people are starting to listen" to his
revolutionary philosophy. He said he
will use the hearing as "a course in US
imperialism and the university under
imperialism."
The case is expected to receive
nationwide attention as a test of the
extent of academic freedom and the
protections of faculty tenure.
(Tomorrow's Daily will include a
special section on the Franklin case.)
