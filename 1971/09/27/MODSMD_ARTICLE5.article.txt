# Massive Registration Begins Today
## Student Voters Sign Up 
### CHRIS PECK News Analysis 
This summer's ratification of the 26 th amendment
allowing 18, 19 and 20-year-olds to vote in all
elections and the recent California Supreme Court
ruling that college students may vote in the town
where they attend college have set the stage for a
massive student voter registration campaign at
Stanford.
The Student Committee for Involvement in
Politics (SCIP), plus representatives from the
Republican, Democratic and Peace and Freedom
parties will be on campus today and Tuesday to
register voters who want to declare California as their
home state.
As long as new voters will have lived in California
90 days prior to the State presidential primary next
June, they are eligible to register to vote in Santa
Clara County.
It is estimated that as many as 2.5 million new
young voters will be added to the California
electorate for the 1 97 2 presidential primaries and
Santa Clara Republican Party Executive Director Bob
Walker says, "There is no denying that the young
people will have a great impact on the coming
elections."
Most surveys of voter registration patterns show
that the Republican party will not profit by the
addition of young voters to the election rolls. Bob
Grant, coordinator of the Stanford-based Student

Committee for Involvement in Politics which
registered nearly 55 0 new voters during the summer
session at Stanford says that "more than 60 percent
of the new voters registered Democratic."
Santa Clara County coordinator for the
Democratic party, Madge Overhouse, notes that
"more than 70 percent of the young voters who
we've registered have been Democrats."
The rush to sign up young voters isn't confined to
the two major parties however. Paul Loeb, a Stanford
sophomore and organizer of a new Peace and
Freedom Party chapter on campus says that P and F
"has about 1 000 new voters registered in the Palo
Alto area."
Although the Peace and Freedom Party is best
known for its intimate ties with the Black Panthers,
Loeb insists that "the alliance with the Panthers isn't
that active anymore and the aim of the Peace and
Freedom Party is simply to get more people involved
in electoral politics by offering candidates that are
alternatives to the present power structure."
In the Palo Alto area, the impact of the student
vote probably will not change the balance of power
significantly according to county Democratic
coordinator Overhouse.
"We see that the young voters don't turn out in
very great numbers," Mrs. Overhouse says,"and they
usually don't vote much differently than the older
generation anyway. As for the radical elements of the
area, they'll either vote Peace and Freedom or not

vote at all and that won't affect the electoral system
much."
In some college communities however, the fear
that student power will become all-powerful has led
older voters to oppose allowing students to vote in
the town where they attend school.
Amherst, Massachusetts is perhaps the most
extreme example of how students could virtually take
over the electoral system. The town population is
only 13,000 compared to a student population of
more than 21,000 .
More than 20 other college communities face a
similar situationâ€”students composing the largest
single population block. The Association of Students
for Voter Registration reports that 14 student
governments have received a cool response from local
election boards when they tried to register students in
their college town election rolls.
Even if students across the county are forced in
large numbers to vote absentee in the 1972 elections,
the impact of the newly franchised voters could be
tremendous. SCIP coordinator Grant predicts that
"even if only 3 0 percent of the students who can vote
in the coming election do vote, and assuming that 60
percent of them vote Democratic, that's 1.5 million
more votes for that party and that would have swung
both the 1 960 and 1 968 elections the other way."
"But," Grant continued, "all of that hinges on the
question of whether the Democrats can offer a
candidate that is even marginally acceptable to the
youncer voters."
