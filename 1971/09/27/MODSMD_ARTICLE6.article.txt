# All Things Must Pass

### FRED MANN 
Editor's Note: Through these
Doors is a column for the use of
Daily staffers to try to provide
some insight into the newspaper's
operation.
Eighteen years ago, in 1953,
The Stanford Daily opened the
academic year by welcoming the
new freshmen "to the Farm—the
greatest place on earth." In their
first edition, the staff of the paper
j made six references to "The
• Stanford Spirit," three to Herbert

Hoover, and one to the newly
raised tuition—s22o per quarter.
Since that time, both The
Daily and the issues have changed
considerably. With the growing
complexity of life at Stanford and
in the world, the problems faced
by the aspiring young reporter
today are enough to blow the
minds of many a Daily scribe back
in the days of Ike and Joe
McCarthy. Rarely, if ever, do
football, school plays, and
sophomore mixers receive front
page coverage any more. Those
writing stories are asked to do
more than merely copy over PR
pap for a campus department or

organization. Today, they are
required to think.
Most Difficult Role
Walter Lippmann wrote that,
in his opinion, the modern college
press has the most difficult of all
roles to play. It must report the
truth—without offending the
students who pay its bills, it must
investigate the hidden workings of
the university—without raising the
ire of the administrators who are
its legal guardians, and it must
tackle complex, diverse

subjects—in the midst of a most
knowledgeable and critical
audience of experts.
The reporting of issues that
make this year's front pages will
hopefully represent Lippmann's
ideals of truth, investigation, and
diversity. But the 1953 impression
of the Daily as "accurate,
complete, and representative of
student views" is undoubtedly
lost forever, as it must be.
The topics in
dictate the change. The
complicated maneuverings
involved in, for instance, the BAP
program, and the delicate dealings
of faculty and student politics

make accurate and objective
reporting a matter of judgment.
The overwhelming quantity of
interesting and important news
being made every day in political,
social, and academic circles,
combined with the space
restrictions caused by financial
conditions rules out what used to
be considered a "complete"
paper. More is happening today,
and decisions must be made as to
what is covered and what is not.
The concept of The Daily as
"representative of student views"
was a farcical one in 1953, and is
even more so today. The Daily
serves more than just the students.
As many faculty, staff, and
community people read the paper
as do students. And no one views
today's news the same way. There
was probably even controversy 18
years ago over the reporting of the
vicious competition on the Row
during Greek Week. But that was
nothing compared to the feelings
surrounding the adjudged
importance of tomorrow's Bruce
Franklin hearing.
As the Daily has moved
towards legal and financial
independence from the ASSU and
the University administration, the
restraints that plague Lippmann's
conception of the college press
have- decreased. Daily reporters
stilr work under the critical gaze
of a community of experts, and
the pressure remains strong for
news coverage to be as
far-reaching and comprehensive as
the issues will allow. Such
pressure is valuable, and we hope
it will be the spark that will keep
us on top of the issues and events
affecting the Stanford
community.

overheard mutteriiu "I am the
Daily. ")
