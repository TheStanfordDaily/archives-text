# Sudden Death In San Jose
## 
### 
Robert h. shepherd

A man was slain by a police
officer during the early morning
hours of Sunday September 19.
Here is a summary of events
condensed from various articles
appearing in The San Jose
Mercury this past week.
John Henry Smith, a chemist
working for IBM, had just taken
his date home from a party and
was apparently on the way home.
Near Kiely Boulevard and
Saratoga Avenue Officer Rocklin
Wooley, on patrol with his dog,
observed him make an illegal turn
against a red light, pursued with
red light and siren, stopped him at
the rear of an apartment complex,
Meridian Corners, at 4 221
Norwalk Drive.
Smith got out of his car, was
abusive, used obscene language,

calmed down, accepted his ticket
and was about to drive on when
two off-duty, out of uniform
policemen (Officers Darrel
Richter and Robert Watts),
stopped to see if Wooley required
any assistance.
Smith then went berserk, got
out of his car, threatened the
police with a tire iron, was
squirted with mace, subdued,
placed under arrest and requested
to submit to a search. This he
started to do, then suddenly
refused to cooperate. (From here
on the story begins to get
confusing, if it hasn't already.)
Cries For Help
Somewhere along the way
Smith once again made
threatening gestures with the tire
iron, was set upon by the police
dog, ran across the street to a
chain link fence, tried to climb
over, was once more attacked by
the dog. Residents of the nearby
apartment buildings, where he and
the two off duty men all lived,
state that they heard moaning and
cries for help.
He then returned to the police
car, placed his hands on it and
agreed to be searched. (Officer
Wooley was unable to put hand
cuffs on him because, for some

reason, he didn't have any.) Again
Smith broke iway, running
toward the entrance of the
buildings. At this time Wooley
drew his gun, and fearing Smith
intended to enter the apartment
and re-arm himself, shot him in
the chest.
The coroner's report states the
body was found bare to the waist,
bore marks probably made by the
dog, and had a split lip, as well as
the fatal gunshot wound. (An
x-marks the spot type photo
shows the location of the body as
being several feet inside a
pass-through, or hall way).
Not Drunk, No Drugs
An autopsy later proved Smith
to be "clean," he'd had a few
drinks but was not drunk, nor was
he under the influence of
drugs—contrary to an earlier
statement of opinion by Chief of
Police Robert Murphy. Briefly,
these are the facts of a sad,
melancholy, mess, as presented in
the papers. Now for some
personal views ana comments.
Assuming (which I do not),
that the officers' account is
substantially correct, I hold the
shooting to be inexcusable; if
what I have good reason to
suspect, did in fact, occur, then it

is criminal. If three men, plus a
trained dog, could not cope with
one man, of medium height and
rather slight build, in a less
permanent manner, then they are
not the calibre men (or dogs),
needed on an up to date
metropolitan police force.
I was somewhat acquainted
with John Smith; a few years back
we belonged to the same social
organization, the Servetus Club, a
singles group affiliated with the
First Unitarian Church of San
Jose. He was a handsome,
intelligent and sensitive man,
out-going and friendly. At parties
he had a few drinks, liked to talk,
was a mixer; neither I, nor anyone
I've talked to, ever saw him drunk
or acting other than a gentleman.
Actions Not Possible
He was not, by nature, violent
or pugnacious in any way.
Therefore, 1 find it most difficult
to believe Mr. Smith could
possibly have acted in the manner
described by Officers Wooley,
Richter, and Watts, except under
conditions of extreme
provocation and/or duress.
I ask all members of the
Stanford community, especially
residents of San Jose, to write to
Mr. Thomas W. Fletcher, City
Manager, 801 North First Street,
San Jose; urging that; (1 ) a
thorough and impartial inquiry be
held by an agency independent of
the governments of San Jose and
Santa Clara County, (2 ) the three
police officers involved be
suspended from duty, with or
without pay, until such time as an
investigation can be completed.
I'd like to close with one more
incontrovertible fact. John Henry
Smith was a black.

substantially correct, I hold the
shooting to be inexcusable; if
what I have good reason to
suspect, did in fact, occur, then it

is criminal. If three men, plus a
trained dog, could not cope with
one man, of medium height and
rather slight build, in a less
permanent manner, then they are
not the calibre men (or dogs),
needed on an up to date
metropolitan police force.
I was somewhat acquainted
with John Smith; a few years back
we belonged to the same social
organization, the Servetus Club, a
singles group affiliated with the
First Unitarian Church of San
Jose. He was a handsome,
intelligent and sensitive man,
out-going and friendly. At parties
he had a few drinks, liked to talk,
was a mixer; neither I, nor anyone
I've talked to, ever saw him drunk
or acting other than a gentleman.
Actions Not Possible
He was not, by nature, violent
or pugnacious in any way.
Therefore, 1 find it most difficult
to believe Mr. Smith could
possibly have acted in the manner
described by Officers Wooley,
Richter, and Watts, except under
conditions of extreme
provocation and/or duress.
I ask all members of the
Stanford community, especially
residents of San Jose, to write to
Mr. Thomas W. Fletcher, City
Manager, 801 North First Street,
San Jose; urging that; (1 ) a
thorough and impartial inquiry be
held by an agency independent of
the governments of San Jose and
Santa Clara County, (2 ) the three
police officers involved be
suspended from duty, with or
without pay, until such time as an
investigation can be completed.
I'd like to close with one more
incontrovertible fact. John Henry
Smith was a black.

A man was slain by a police
officer during the early morning
hours of Sunday September 19.
Here is a summary of events
condensed from various articles
appearing in The San Jose
Mercury this past week.
John Henry Smith, a chemist
working for IBM, had just taken
his date home from a party and
was apparently on the way home.
Near Kiely Boulevard and
Saratoga Avenue Officer Rocklin
Wooley, on patrol with his dog,
observed him make an illegal turn
against a red light, pursued with
red light and siren, stopped him at
the rear of an apartment complex,
Meridian Corners, at 4 221
Norwalk Drive.
Smith got out of his car, was
abusive, used obscene language,

calmed down, accepted his ticket
and was about to drive on when
two off-duty, out of uniform
policemen (Officers Darrel
Richter and Robert Watts),
stopped to see if Wooley required
any assistance.
Smith then went berserk, got
out of his car, threatened the
police with a tire iron, was
squirted with mace, subdued,
placed under arrest and requested
to submit to a search. This he
started to do, then suddenly
refused to cooperate. (From here
on the story begins to get
confusing, if it hasn't already.)
Cries For Help
Somewhere along the way
Smith once again made
threatening gestures with the tire
iron, was set upon by the police
dog, ran across the street to a
chain link fence, tried to climb
over, was once more attacked by
the dog. Residents of the nearby
apartment buildings, where he and
the two off duty men all lived,
state that they heard moaning and
cries for help.
He then returned to the police
car, placed his hands on it and
agreed to be searched. (Officer
Wooley was unable to put hand
cuffs on him because, for some

reason, he didn't have any.) Again
Smith broke iway, running
toward the entrance of the
buildings. At this time Wooley
drew his gun, and fearing Smith
intended to enter the apartment
and re-arm himself, shot him in
the chest.
The coroner's report states the
body was found bare to the waist,
bore marks probably made by the
dog, and had a split lip, as well as
the fatal gunshot wound. (An
x-marks the spot type photo
shows the location of the body as
being several feet inside a
pass-through, or hall way).
Not Drunk, No Drugs
An autopsy later proved Smith
to be "clean," he'd had a few
drinks but was not drunk, nor was
he under the influence of
drugs—contrary to an earlier
statement of opinion by Chief of
Police Robert Murphy. Briefly,
these are the facts of a sad,
melancholy, mess, as presented in
the papers. Now for some
personal views ana comments.
Assuming (which I do not),
that the officers' account is
substantially correct, I hold the
shooting to be inexcusable; if
what I have good reason to
suspect, did in fact, occur, then it

is criminal. If three men, plus a
trained dog, could not cope with
