# Attica—More Heads To Roll

WASHINGTON-Even from this
distant vantage point, it is
impossible to write about the
Atica Correctional Facility
massacre without developing a
sour taste in one's mouth and a
certain involuntary twitching in
one's fingers.
"Massacre," however, seems to
be too gentle a word to accurately
describe the events in that upstate
New York "correctional facility"
("prison" to most of us). Perhaps
"butchery," "slaughter,"
"carnage," "decimation," "mass
murder," "pogrom," "genocide,"
"racial extermination," or
"liquidation" might more
accurately describe that situation.
Men and women of the social

sciences tell us that prisons in
many ways accurately reflect
society as a whole. If so,
Americans have plenty to worry
about, because many aspects of
the Attica tragedy seemingly give
sharp insight into the condition of
our society:
—The term "correctional
facility" is a laughable one.
Unfortunately, it is sick laughter.
Prison reformers, those
dewey-eyed (white) liberals
recently joined by radical and
revolutionary lawyers seeking to
publicize the plight of their
clients, have been telling us that
for years. Now maybe we'll begin
to believe them. And just maybe
we'll be stirred to action. If we are
not, the odds are excellent that
there'll be an Attica 11, an Attica
111, an Attica IV, and so on until

America—and white Americans
especially—gets the word.
Couldn't Wait
—That old American adage,
"actions speak louder than
words," is still with us. The State
of New York just couldn't wait.
As one of the negotiators
remarked after the police forces
had stormed Cell block D, "As far
as I am concerned, there's always
time to die." Some problems in
this society can still be talked
out—this situation very well could
have been one of them. An
appearance by Gov. Nelson
Rockefeller might have saved a
few lives—perhaps 40 or more
All the prisoners were asking for
was to talk to the man; certainly
he could have taken a first-hand
look at the situation before
agreeing to send in all those
troopers.
—Prison officials are not the
most trustworthy governmental
employees in this world. So many
untruths, distortions and outright
lies (such as the tales of
castrations and slit throats) were
bandied about as "official"
statements that it may take
months just to reconstruct where
some of them came from.
Reporters on the scene must have
recognized some of the
impossibilities (such as the fairy
tale about the guard being thrown
through a window—an
impossibility because all such
windows at the prison are
equipped with metal bars), but
they continued to print the
untruths anyway, because at least
they sounded "official" and that's

what their editors like.
Killing a prison guard (Quinn)
is a capital crime in New York.
The hearings for the prisoners will
no doubt start within a couple of
months. And the closing words of
one of the negotiating team
members and New York Times
Associate p]ditor Tom Wicker's
columns sound horrifyingly
realistic:

"But time is for men, not for
prisoners and animals. Now the
dead lie tagged in the morgue, and
the men with guns are counting
their kill. They may even be
looking forward to the same
highly practical form of amnesty
American society has already
granted to the killers at Kent
State and Orangeburg and Jackson
State."
The troopers' guns are silent
now. But the bitter memory of
their accomplishments will live on
for decades, for generations. I
don't think we've heard the last of
Attica, for someday the true story
of what happened on that grim
September morning will come to
light. And then, although perhaps
not literally, a few more heads
will roll.

This list could go on and on:
how the President called
Rockefeller to offer his support
for the governor's calling the
troopers; how Rockefeller was
quite surprised to hear that even
one hostage got out alive; how the
state police shouted "white
power" as they emerged from the
bloodied prison yard; how local

Foreign Speculation

shopkeepers closed their
businesses rather than serve the
prisoners' relatives and black
reporters; how badly-needed
doctors and nurses (and legal
observers) were denied entrance
after the shootings . . .
Race War
One of the National
Guardsmen involved in
recapturing the prison, a white
man from New York City, later
told reporters that the uprising
was obviously a "race war" and
that the white guards and
policemen had repeatedly clubbed
inmates hours after the situation
was under control. The situation
he described was the same day the
prison was retaken; imagine what
it has been like since Attica has
dropped (at least temporarily)
from the media's spotlight.
