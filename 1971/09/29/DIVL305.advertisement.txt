YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR A LOT OF
BULLSHIT ABOUT RECORDS
THIS SEMESTER
WORLD'S INDOOR RECORDS
W
Would like to set the record straight right off.
1. We have the Lowest everyday price on
everything. That means not this weekend on
just these records, but everyday on all records.
2. We have an in-depth selection of rock,
soul, jazz and classical music, not just the bits.
3. We special order records at no extra cost.
That means if we don't have a particular record,
we'll try to get it fast and at no charge.
4. We always have 500 or more brand new
LPS at 1.99 in our garden of delights. Check
them out for the best bargain around.
5. We play records for you. to give you
some idea of what y>u may be getting into.
After all we're the good guys.
