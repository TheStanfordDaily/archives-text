Introducing stationery /CSssk
for people who think
saving a tree is important.
Earthnotes is 100% recycled quality stationery. It's made entirely
from waste material. Trash.
Using recycled paper saves trees, reduces pollution, and cuts
down on waste.
But recycling only works when there is a demand for waste material.
And this demand is created only when people buy recycled products.
By buying Earthnotes, and other recycled paper products, you create |T i »uILY«*
a market for recycled paper. And help to save more trees. |\ |
Each box contains 50 Monarch size sheets, 30 matching |
envelopes and 30 "Save-a-Tree" L
stickers so you can spread the buy
recycling message. It's available
in while or pastel "earth colors". I ilffPl!
and help save-a-tree
