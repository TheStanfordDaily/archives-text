# Chief Wants Full Powers
## 
### LANG ATWOOD 
In late July, Marvin L. Herrington,
35, was selected as the new campus
police chief even as uncertianty
continued over the sometimes
controversial role of the Stanford
Police Department.
Stanford police are not peace
officers, which means that although
they carry guns and drive
official-looking cars they can only
make citizens' arrests. The Santa Clara
County Sheriff's Department handles
all criminal investigations on campus, as
well as riot control.
Herrington's predecessor, Thomas
Bell, resigned in April when
administrators reportedly became
dissatisfied with his work and he
criticized them for indecision about the
department's status.
The new chief, who formerly headed
security for the California State
Colleges, wants the department to have
full police powers.
"The question of the department's
status has to be resolved one way or
another," Herrington said. "Uppermost
in my mind is the welfarp of the
community. We would be in a position
to do a better job if we had the
responsibility."

Before becoming security chief for
the 19 state colleges in December,
1970, Herrington was Chief of Police at
Northwestern University for two years.
During that time he built up a strong
40-man police force from what had
been a weak 8-man security group.
Selection of a new campus chief had
been delayed after the Committee on
the Role fo the Campus Police split
evenly between Herrington and another
candidate who had been submitted by
the administration.
All three student members of the
committee had preferred the other
candidate, reportedly a teacher of
police science, ova 1 Herrington. The
students had doubts about Herrington's
ability to work well with students and
his understanding of Stanford's
political climate.
Many of these doubts diminished
after a former Northwestern University
student leader praised him. He has also
impressed some students here as
sincerely wanting to get to know the
Stanford community.
Former Northwestern Student Body
President Eva Jefferson told the Daily
in a telephone interview, "I think
Herrington's a fair man and an honest

man and one who's willing to listen to
you."
Asked about his contacts with
students, Herrington said, "I've had my
ups and downs, but I always got along
with the people in the community I've
worked for. And for the past 10 years,
students have been that community.'
In order to obtain police powers for
the department, the administration had
a bill introduced in the State Assembly
last spring that would have given
Stanford officers peace officer status.
The bill was opposed by Santa Clara
County Sheriff James Geary and the
ASSU, primarily on the grounds that
the police would not be responsible to
any elected official, only University
administrators.
Herrington refutes this charge,
saying that the officers would have to
adhere to the laws of the state and
meet requirements set by the state
commision on Peace Officers'
Standards and Training (POST).
"As a practical matter, we're going
to have to be responsive to the
community," he added.
The new chief also said that he
would be willing to work with an
advisory board from the community, as

administration table at yesterday afternoon's advisory board hearing.
long as it wasn't a review board, if the
department received full police status.
When the Sheriff's opposition
became known, negotiations began
between the University and the
Sheriff's Department. The Assembly
bill was shelved at the request of its
sponsors, although it has little chance
of being passed if reintroduced.
Sheriff Geary proposed deputizing
part of Stanford's 48-man force,
making them reserve deputies with full
police powers. They would be under
the University's operational control on
normal duty, but would take orders
from the Sheriff duirng crisis periods or
whenever the Sheriff deemed it
necessary.
Administrators are opposed to this
plan because they would lose control of
those men and would be unable to set
police policy on the campus.
Meeting the POST standards is
another problem facing the campus
police if they get peace officer status.
The present security guard training is
not sufficient and few of the men have
advanced degrees.
Should full enforcement status be
granted, Stanford would probably have
to pay more to attract better men,
Herrington said.
Asked if the campus has sufficient

police protection, Sheriff's Sergeant
Don Tamm said, "Yes, we feel that the
campus is covered adequately. We still
need more, but our patrols have
increased since last spring.
Herrington disagrees, saying that he
<s not satisfied with the Sheriff's
coverage that now exists. The two

forces together are adequate, he stated,
but the question of the campus
officers' powers reduces effectiveness.
No decision on the police
department status is expected until
around the first of the year according
to both Stanford and Santa Clara
officials.

During that time he built up a strong
40-man police force from what had
been a weak 8-man security group.
Selection of a new campus chief had
been delayed after the Committee on
the Role fo the Campus Police split
evenly between Herrington and another
candidate who had been submitted by
the administration.
All three student members of the
committee had preferred the other
candidate, reportedly a teacher of
police science, ova 1 Herrington. The
students had doubts about Herrington's
ability to work well with students and
his understanding of Stanford's
political climate.
Many of these doubts diminished
after a former Northwestern University
student leader praised him. He has also
impressed some students here as
sincerely wanting to get to know the
Stanford community.
Former Northwestern Student Body
President Eva Jefferson told the Daily
in a telephone interview, "I think
Herrington's a fair man and an honest

man and one who's willing to listen to
you."
Asked about his contacts with
students, Herrington said, "I've had my
ups and downs, but I always got along
with the people in the community I've
worked for. And for the past 10 years,
students have been that community.'
In order to obtain police powers for
the department, the administration had
a bill introduced in the State Assembly
last spring that would have given
Stanford officers peace officer status.
The bill was opposed by Santa Clara
County Sheriff James Geary and the
ASSU, primarily on the grounds that
the police would not be responsible to
any elected official, only University
administrators.
Herrington refutes this charge,
saying that the officers would have to
adhere to the laws of the state and
meet requirements set by the state
commision on Peace Officers'
Standards and Training (POST).
"As a practical matter, we're going
to have to be responsive to the
community," he added.
The new chief also said that he
would be willing to work with an
advisory board from the community, as

administration table at yesterday afternoon's advisory board hearing.
long as it wasn't a review board, if the
department received full police status.
When the Sheriff's opposition
became known, negotiations began
between the University and the
Sheriff's Department. The Assembly
bill was shelved at the request of its
sponsors, although it has little chance
of being passed if reintroduced.
Sheriff Geary proposed deputizing
part of Stanford's 48-man force,
making them reserve deputies with full
police powers. They would be under
the University's operational control on
normal duty, but would take orders
from the Sheriff duirng crisis periods or
whenever the Sheriff deemed it
necessary.
Administrators are opposed to this
plan because they would lose control of
those men and would be unable to set
police policy on the campus.
Meeting the POST standards is
another problem facing the campus
police if they get peace officer status.
The present security guard training is
not sufficient and few of the men have
advanced degrees.
Should full enforcement status be
granted, Stanford would probably have
to pay more to attract better men,
Herrington said.
Asked if the campus has sufficient

police protection, Sheriff's Sergeant
Don Tamm said, "Yes, we feel that the
campus is covered adequately. We still
need more, but our patrols have
increased since last spring.
Herrington disagrees, saying that he
<s not satisfied with the Sheriff's
coverage that now exists. The two

forces together are adequate, he stated,
but the question of the campus
officers' powers reduces effectiveness.
No decision on the police
department status is expected until
around the first of the year according
to both Stanford and Santa Clara
officials.

NEW CHlEF—Marvin Herrington, new Stanford Police Chief, is uncertain about
the future status of his department.
In late July, Marvin L. Herrington,
35, was selected as the new campus
police chief even as uncertianty
continued over the sometimes
controversial role of the Stanford
Police Department.
Stanford police are not peace
officers, which means that although
they carry guns and drive
official-looking cars they can only
make citizens' arrests. The Santa Clara
County Sheriff's Department handles
all criminal investigations on campus, as
well as riot control.
Herrington's predecessor, Thomas
Bell, resigned in April when
administrators reportedly became
dissatisfied with his work and he
criticized them for indecision about the
department's status.
The new chief, who formerly headed
security for the California State
Colleges, wants the department to have
full police powers.
"The question of the department's
status has to be resolved one way or
another," Herrington said. "Uppermost
in my mind is the welfarp of the
community. We would be in a position
to do a better job if we had the
responsibility."

Before becoming security chief for
the 19 state colleges in December,
1970, Herrington was Chief of Police at

worked for. And for the past 10 years,
students have been that community.'
In order to obtain police powers for
the department, the administration had
a bill introduced in the State Assembly
last spring that would have given
Stanford officers peace officer status.
The bill was opposed by Santa Clara
County Sheriff James Geary and the
ASSU, primarily on the grounds that
the police would not be responsible to
any elected official, only University
administrators.
Herrington refutes this charge,
saying that the officers would have to
adhere to the laws of the state and
meet requirements set by the state
commision on Peace Officers'
Standards and Training (POST).
"As a practical matter, we're going
to have to be responsive to the
community," he added.
The new chief also said that he
would be willing to work with an
advisory board from the community, as

long as it wasn't a review board, if the
department received full police status.
When the Sheriff's opposition
became known, negotiations began
between the University and the
Sheriff's Department. The Assembly
bill was shelved at the request of its
sponsors, although it has little chance
of being passed if reintroduced.
Sheriff Geary proposed deputizing
part of Stanford's 48-man force,
making them reserve deputies with full
police powers. They would be under
the University's operational control on
normal duty, but would take orders
from the Sheriff duirng crisis periods or
whenever the Sheriff deemed it
necessary.
Administrators are opposed to this
plan because they would lose control of
those men and would be unable to set
police policy on the campus.
Meeting the POST standards is
another problem facing the campus
police if they get peace officer status.
The present security guard training is
not sufficient and few of the men have
advanced degrees.
Should full enforcement status be
granted, Stanford would probably have
to pay more to attract better men,
Herrington said.
Asked if the campus has sufficient

police protection, Sheriff's Sergeant
Don Tamm said, "Yes, we feel that the
campus is covered adequately. We still
need more, but our patrols have
increased since last spring.
Herrington disagrees, saying that he
<s not satisfied with the Sheriff's
coverage that now exists. The two

forces together are adequate, he stated,
but the question of the campus
officers' powers reduces effectiveness.
No decision on the police
department status is expected until
around the first of the year according
to both Stanford and Santa Clara
officials.
