# Chief Wants Full Powers
## 
### LANG ATWOOD 
In late July, Marvin L. Herrington,
35, was selected as the new campus
police chief even as uncertianty
continued over the sometimes
controversial role of the Stanford
Police Department.
Stanford police are not peace
officers, which means that although
they carry guns and drive
official-looking cars they can only
make citizens' arrests. The Santa Clara
County Sheriff's Department handles
all criminal investigations on campus, as
well as riot control.
Herrington's predecessor, Thomas
Bell, resigned in April when
administrators reportedly became
dissatisfied with his work and he
criticized them for indecision about the
department's status.
The new chief, who formerly headed
security for the California State
Colleges, wants the department to have
full police powers.
"The question of the department's
status has to be resolved one way or
another," Herrington said. "Uppermost
in my mind is the welfarp of the
community. We would be in a position
to do a better job if we had the
responsibility."

Before becoming security chief for
the 19 state colleges in December,
1970, Herrington was Chief of Police at
Northwestern University for two years.
During that time he built up a strong
40-man police force from what had
been a weak 8-man security group.
Selection of a new campus chief had
been delayed after the Committee on
the Role fo the Campus Police split
evenly between Herrington and another
candidate who had been submitted by
the administration.
All three student members of the
committee had preferred the other
candidate, reportedly a teacher of
police science, ova 1 Herrington. The
students had doubts about Herrington's
ability to work well with students and
his understanding of Stanford's
political climate.
Many of these doubts diminished
after a former Northwestern University
student leader praised him. He has also
impressed some students here as
sincerely wanting to get to know the
Stanford community.
Former Northwestern Student Body
President Eva Jefferson told the Daily
in a telephone interview, "I think
Herrington's a fair man and an honest

man and one who's willing to listen to
you."
Asked about his contacts with
students, Herrington said, "I've had my
ups and downs, but I always got along
with the people in the community I've
worked for. And for the past 10 years,
students have been that community.'
In order to obtain police powers for
the department, the administration had
a bill introduced in the State Assembly
last spring that would have given
Stanford officers peace officer status.
The bill was opposed by Santa Clara
County Sheriff James Geary and the
ASSU, primarily on the grounds that
the police would not be responsible to
any elected official, only University
administrators.
Herrington refutes this charge,
saying that the officers would have to
adhere to the laws of the state and
meet requirements set by the state
commision on Peace Officers'
Standards and Training (POST).
"As a practical matter, we're going
to have to be responsive to the
community," he added.
The new chief also said that he
would be willing to work with an
advisory board from the community, as
