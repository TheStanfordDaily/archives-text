# Now That Selective Service Is Back

Editors Note: Rough Draft, a
column written by the Special
Services Office, will appear
regularly in the Daily.
NEW DRAFT LEGISLATION
On Sept. 22, 1971 the
President signed a new draft act
which extends the power of
induction until June 30, 1973.
There have been no inductions
since June 30, 1971, but we
expect calls to be resumed by
early October.
The law provides for a number
of changes in Selective Service
procedure, among which are
several new rights for registrants
who are appealing their
classification. A man is now
allowed to present witnesses
before the local board at a
personal appearance. He is now
entitled to make a personal

appearance before a state appeal
board (which formerly received
only a written appeal). A local
board must also now inform a
registrant in writing of reasons for
rejecting a claim for
re-classification if the registrant
requests it.
Under the new law, inductions
will be on a national call basis.
This means that every board in
the country will reach the same
lottery number each month
(starting in 1972). Also, the
National Director's Office of
Selective Service will now approve
civilian work for conscientious
objectors, formerly the
responsibility of local boards.
LOTTERY NUMBERS FOR 1971
Selective Service and Pentagon
officials have announced that men
with lottery numbers over 140
will not be called during 1971.
They offer the possibility that the
present ceiling can be held at
number 125. We expect this to be
clarified before the end of
October.
Students who will be 20 or
older during 1971 may want to
consider exposing themselves to
the 1971 lottery pool IF THEIR
NUMBER WILL CLEARLY NOT
BE REACHED. For a student
holding a 11-S deferment, this can
be done by writing a letter to the
local board before December 31,
1971, requesting to drop the 11-S,
to be re-classified I-A (or I-O,
I-AO), and to be exposed to the
1971 lottery pool. We emphasize
that only those students who
definitely have safe lottery
numbers should consider giving up
their deferment this year. We now
consider numbers over 140 safe
for 1971. A student who exposes
himself to the 1971 lottery, and
whose number is not reached, will
be placed in the Second Priority
Group for 1972. Short of a
general mobilization, men in the
Second Priority Group or lower
will never bv drafted.
STATUS OF FRESHMEN
Deferments: Under the new
draft law there will be no new
student deferments for men who
were not in college during the
school year which ended in June

1971. This means that the class of
1975 will not be guaranteed four
years in which to complete college
before being drafted. Instead, men
entering college this fall will be
subject to call according to their
lottery numbers unless they are
deferred for some other reason
such as a physical disability or an
extreme hardship situation. We
are prepared to help students

ROUGH DRAFT

define all of their draft
alternatives, and to explain the
conditions under which they may
be drafted out of school.
Lottery: A man receives a
lottery number during the
calendar year in which he turns
19. He is first eligible for
induction if his number is reached
during the calendar year in which
he turns 20, providing he is I-A,
available for induction. Depending
on his age, a student may be able
to finish a year or two of college
before becoming eligible for
induction. If he holds a deferment
or exemption during the calendar
year in which he turns 20, he will
become eligible for induction if
his lottery number is reached
during the calendar year in which
he becomes I-A. In order to
determine the chance of his
number being reached, he should
consider the year that he will
become eligible and the projected
calls for that year.
Registration: The law requires
every male citizen and all male
aliens who are permanent
residents to register with Selective
Service within five days after their
eighteenth birthdays. A man who
is not yet 18 when he enters
Stanford may have a choice about
the draft board which will have
jurisdiction over him during the
entire period that he is registered.
If a man registers under his
family's home address, he will be
assigned to a board in that area. If

he registers under his Stanford
address, he will be assigned to
Board 62 in San Jose. A man can
register in the Special Services
Office without having to go to a
local board.
STATUS OF STUDENTS
Although the new law denies
student deferments to entering
college freshmen, men in college

prior to this year are still entitled
to student deferments until
graduation, provided they have
met and continue to meet the old
Selective Service requirements for
student deferments. This is true
even for those men who were in
school last year, but were not yet
old enough to be registered with a
local board.
The IS-C deferment, formerly
granted to students who receive
an induction order while a full
time student in school, will no
longer be granted. Instead,
undergraduates will now be
allowed only a postponement of
induction until the end of the
term in which the induction order

is received or until the end of the
school year, if they are seniors.
Graduates will continue to be
given postponements of induction
until the end of the academic year
unless these postponements arjp
shortened by an expected
Executive Order.
FUTURE OF THE DRAFT
It has been announced that lottery
numbers over 140 will be safe for
1971, and our prediction is that
numbers over 100 will probably
be safe for 1972. The current
Administration has announced
plans for a zero-draft-call by July
1973. Thus, lottery numbers
called during 1973 will likely stay
well under 100. A number of
consideration, however, indicate
that the next two years of the
draft may be unpredictable. A
large pay increase for first term
enlisted men in the new draft law
will affect future enlistments. The
unemployment situation may also
affect the enlistment rate.
National elections have
historically elicited low draft calls,
and the current public focus on
the draft could give it large
significance for the 1972
elections. Finally, a change in the
number of troops in Southeast
Asia would definitely affect the
present reliance on the draft. We
hope to keep up with these
changes as they affect Selective
Service, and will continue to
provide you with new
information.
