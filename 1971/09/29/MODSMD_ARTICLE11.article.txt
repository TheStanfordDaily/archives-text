# Chase Away No Mail Blues
## 
### 
An empty mailbox can be a big
down. There are ways to avoid
this disappointment, like never
checking your mailbox. Or you
can check the minimum amount
of times with the greatest chance
for success. Here's how:
Mail comes to Stanford three
times a day, but first class mail
comes only at 5 and 8:30 a.m.
There is one more delivery at
noon of third class mail. Acting
Assistant Stanford Supervisor
Kenneth Mar says the mail is
placed in the boxes by three
workers starting as soon as it
arrives.
This is called "poking" the
mail. Up to five men poke the
mail until 2:30 in the afternoon.
But the first class mail is almost
always in your box by 9 or 9:30
a.m.

Anything else in your box later
in the day is probably third class
stuff like ads and junk mail. If
there are unusually large amounts
of mail, substitutes are called in to
poke in the afternoon.
As a rule of thumb, you could
check your box at 9 :30 a.m. and
get the important mail. If you
wanted to get all your mail you
could check again at 3 p.m. If you
check after that you're just
looking for an excuse to walk to
the post office. Sorry to blow
your cover.
One other problem you'll run
into right away is the long lines.
Tony Cinegran has been working
at the Stanford post office for 22
years, or as he says, "Too long."
He's a counter man and while he
won't recommend a best time to
do your posting, Cinegran will tell

you not to come between 12 and
2 p.m. or 4 :30 and 5 p.m.
Finally, he will plead with you
to keep a single file line and not
butt in even to ask a simple
question. Just wait. You'll wait
faster that way.
One nice thing about mailing
this year. If you buy an air mail
stamp and send a letter to New
York by 8:30 a.m. one day, the
letter might just arrive in New
York the next day.
Letters sent airmail to major
urban centers within 600 miles of
San Francisco also have a good
chance to get there the next day,
too. Plus, most letters mailed at
the regular eight cent rate to New
York are airlifted anyway.

RiPOFFS CONTINUE— An enraged student is seen here breaking into top secret mail documents. A hidden
camera helped make possible his speedy apprehension by the Stanford Police. Questioned by
psychologists at the Stanford Med Center, the suspect replied, "I hadn't gotten mail for a week! I just had
to see if there was anything they forgot to put in my box!"

poke in the afternoon.
As a rule of thumb, you could
check your box at 9 :30 a.m. and
get the important mail. If you
wanted to get all your mail you
could check again at 3 p.m. If you
check after that you're just
looking for an excuse to walk to
the post office. Sorry to blow
your cover.
One other problem you'll run
into right away is the long lines.
Tony Cinegran has been working
at the Stanford post office for 22
years, or as he says, "Too long."
He's a counter man and while he
won't recommend a best time to
do your posting, Cinegran will tell

you not to come between 12 and
2 p.m. or 4 :30 and 5 p.m.
Finally, he will plead with you
to keep a single file line and not
butt in even to ask a simple
question. Just wait. You'll wait
faster that way.
One nice thing about mailing
this year. If you buy an air mail
stamp and send a letter to New
York by 8:30 a.m. one day, the
letter might just arrive in New
York the next day.
Letters sent airmail to major
urban centers within 600 miles of
San Francisco also have a good
chance to get there the next day,
too. Plus, most letters mailed at
the regular eight cent rate to New
York are airlifted anyway.

RiPOFFS CONTINUE— An enraged student is seen here breaking into top secret mail documents. A hidden
camera helped make possible his speedy apprehension by the Stanford Police. Questioned by
psychologists at the Stanford Med Center, the suspect replied, "I hadn't gotten mail for a week! I just had
to see if there was anything they forgot to put in my box!"
An empty mailbox can be a big
down. There are ways to avoid
this disappointment, like never
checking your mailbox. Or you
can check the minimum amount
of times with the greatest chance
for success. Here's how:
Mail comes to Stanford three
times a day, but first class mail
comes only at 5 and 8:30 a.m.
There is one more delivery at
noon of third class mail. Acting
Assistant Stanford Supervisor
Kenneth Mar says the mail is
placed in the boxes by three
workers starting as soon as it
arrives.
This is called "poking" the
mail. Up to five men poke the
mail until 2:30 in the afternoon.
But the first class mail is almost
always in your box by 9 or 9:30
a.m.

Anything else in your box later
in the day is probably third class
stuff like ads and junk mail. If
there are unusually large amounts
of mail, substitutes are called in to
poke in the afternoon.
As a rule of thumb, you could
check your box at 9 :30 a.m. and
get the important mail. If you
wanted to get all your mail you
could check again at 3 p.m. If you
check after that you're just
looking for an excuse to walk to
the post office. Sorry to blow
your cover.
