##

Radical C a I ifornia
Assemblyman Willie L. Brown
toid incoming Stanford freshmen
Monday night that "students can
ultimately make the difference in
the life style of the American
people" if they will "think in
terms of how to replace the
decisionmakers of this country."
Following the general theme
"Justice in America,"the black
San Francisco Assemblyman
asked the Class of 1975 "not to
disassemble America until we've
given democracy a real chance to
work." Brown told the crowd of
about 500 freshmen that "there
was no justice in America today,"
only because "the nation's
decisionmakers are choosing to
distribute justice unevenly."

After his formal address,
Brown answered questions from
the audience. When one freshman
asked if Brown thought President
Nixon would be re-elected in
1972, the flamboyant
assemblyman drew a laugh when
he said "Yes, I certainly do. That
man is an incredible politician,
never missing an opportunity to
gain a few points on his
popularity scale. I guess you could
say he's always looking for a
quick fix."
Apathy of students and deep
seeded racism against Blacks and
the Third World were cited by
Brown as the reason the American
system has failed to make what he
feels is adequate progress towards
real social justice.
