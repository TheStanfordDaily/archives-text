## Eat Your Way Thru School 
### jerry coleman 
A leading nationwide survey
conducted at college campuses
over the last half century has
pinpointed the center of most
student unrest: the students' own
stomachs!
Yes, it appears that students
are no longer eating with gusto,
and mealtime lines are more a
result of physical need than
epicurean anticipation. In an
effort to remove the lid from this
boiling cauldron of student gripes,

I made a tour of the various eating
establishments available here at
Stanford.
What follows is a chronicle of
that incredible journey,
substantiated by the many minds
and stomachs I met on teh way.
As I walked up the steps of
Lucie Stern Hall, I practiced to
myself the question I would be
asking scores of people before the
morning was over: "What do you
think of the food here?" The
answers speak for themselves:
Likes Vegetables
Stern freshman male: "It's
better than I expected."
Stern freshman female:

"Tresidder is good. I like the
vegetables a lot. I haven't eaten
much here? I hear Wilbur's
supposed to be better."
Taking this as my cue, I rushed
next door to Wilbur, expecting to
find happy, well-adjusted students
politely serving themselves from
platters heaped high with gourmet
delights. My question got me
stunning replies here:
Sophomore female: "You
know what you're getting into?

Don't buy a meal ticket!"
Senior male: "I eat her as little
as I can."
The search was on again. This
time it led to Branner, where I got
these comments:
Freshman female: "Starchy
but good. . .well, I can eat
anything."
Freshman male: "Pretty good.
The only meal I had I didn't like
was at Wilbur."
Prosecution Rests
A pattern seemed to be
forming. These comments
suggested to me that
upperclassmen have had a long
time to discover and relate their

prejudices about the Food
Service, and to keep up to date on
the latest tasty rumors.
Freshmen may know what
they like, but they just haven't
been around long enough to
experience the whole range of
food service quality.
Now that the prosecution had
finished its case, it was time to
hear the closing statements of the
defense. I chose to question Mrs.
Varkonyi, Stern Hall Food Service
Director. "We're willing to talk
and to listen to the students,"
began Mrs. Varkonyi, "and we
will be glad to change if that
change makes people happy."
The same menu, designed by
dieticians, is used all over the
campus at Food Service Outlets.
Mrs. Varkonyi added, "If a
student chooses wisely from
what's offered, he gets a balanced
meal. We try to run an efficient,
friendly service, but it does get
busy, averaging 500-700 people
each meal."
I then decided to head off
toward Toyon, to learn the
residents' reactions to their eating
clubs. The eating clubs offer
complete meals and social
activities (for a minimal social fee)
rolled into one.
'Stuff My Face'
A group of upperclass
residents, apparently on their way
to an early lunch described the
food as "great" and "excellent,"
said the short-order breakfast
looked as good as it tasted, and
thought the eating atmosphere
was more personal than in the
dorms.
"Having the key to the
refrigerator means you can eat
any time!" shouted one Toyonite
over his shoulder. The interview
was terminated when the last
member of the group ran off,
saying, "No time to talk now—l
got to stuff my face."
It being lunch time, I made my

way over to one of the trailers,
hoping to find my friends at
home. I knocked at the door and
heard a weak voice tell me to
come in.
My friends looked haggard and
laughed nervously. When I asked
how they'd been, one replied,
"We've been eating breakfast
cereal for the last three days."
The other 3 males just licked their
lips feverishly.
1 questioned the most coherent
of my friends about the pleasures
of cooking for oneself. (The
trailers have no food service of
their own; residents cook their
own meals, eat out, or purchase a
University plan.)
"Well—things are more relaxed.
You can eat anytime. You can
experience the joy of midnight

and yell at your friends," added
another. A third friend began to
bang wildly on the walls, and,
grunting, made his way into the
bedroom. Someone commented,
"Empty stomachs are the cause of
much disruption."
As I got up to leave, the third
friend returned from the bedroom
shouting something that sounded
like "Chicken Delight, ha ha."
The last words I heard leaving the
trailer were, "Oh—Banana time
now!"
My travels then led me to
Tresidder where I asked random
snackers, "Why are you eating
here 1 " The answers:
"Convenient."
"I was desperate for food."
"It was lunch time and I was
walking by."

good, never boring, and more
interesting than dorm food.
Both Columbae and Eco House
are open communities—anyone is
invited to come to meals, but

Well, there you have a good
idea of the variety of food and
food plans offered at Stanford.
Remember that not only are your
meal cards good at any Food
Service Outlet, but you can turn
in your card in exchange for a
pass good at Fraternities and
Eating Clubs for any one meal.
I would urge everyone to eat at
as many places as he can—not to
get into a rut. And if you would
like to conduct a survey like mine,
you have my blessings. Just be
polite when you ask your
questions, don't talk with your
mouth full, and be sure to thank
the hostess.
Use discretion, too, because
such a survey is, after all, only a
matter of taste.

HOE, HOE, HOE—Columbae residents turn up all thumbs here as they
garden their way into organic goodness. Notice the ripe, juicy,
succulent tomatoes in the foreground. The garden is also famous for
its mammoth zucchinis (not pictured). What a better way to spend a
sunny afternoon?

FRAT JOCKS MUNCH GRUB-Mike "Spiro" Agnew and his buddies
are seen here greedily consuming a delicious home cooked breakfast in
their fraternity dining room. The breakfast is entirely short order so
that each day brings new wonders. Mike's serious attitude reflects the
fact that breakfast is his one big meal for the day.(And his early
morning mind can only cope with one project at a time.)
