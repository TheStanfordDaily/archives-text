# S.F. Film Festival Opens
## 
### TODD McCARTHY 
Usually, Stanford's fall quarter gets a head start on the San
Francisco Film Festival by a couple of weeks but this year, film
addicts will have to perform a balancing act between festival events
and new classes, as the festival begins Saturday night.
This fifteenth annual event, which runs for 16 days, is being
coupled with San Francisco's British Trade Week and will take place
in the newly improved Palace of Fine Arts. As usual, all performances
are open to the public, with tickets available at the Downtown Center
Box Office at 325 Mason and later at the Palace itself.
All morning and afternoon events, including tributes (at which
personalities appear with film clips of their work), are free of charge.
The festival has always gone out of its way to encourage the
attendance of students. In fact, it was the presence of so many hippies
on Nob Hill during the festival that disturbed some of the moneyed
festival patrons in the late sixties, thus helping to prompt the move
from lush Masonic Auditorium to the Palace of Fine Arts.
The going rate for evening tickets, $3.75, is obviously a bit steep,
but then I've always considered festival-going a real event, much more
than just going to the movies. It's worth practically anyone's time, not
only film buffs', to give the festival a try.
So far, none of the showings are completely sold out, though some,
like the Schlesinger and films of John and Yoko, are going quickly.

BLEAK VISION—Peter Watkins,

which will be shown next
Wednesday at the Film Festival.
The film is a political allegory
examining the decay of the
United States and what Watkins
calls "that downward spiral called
history."

Berger, the revelation of Luchino
Visconti's "The Damned," as he
appeared at the Cannes Film
