# Pamoja Concert In Frost
## Jazz, Garcia On Tap Sunday 
### PAUL GRUSHKIN 
The renowned Bobby
Hutcherson-Harold Land Quintet,
Big Black, and Jerry Garcia &
Friends will appear this Sunday
afternoon in the first of a series of
Sunday jazz concerts sponsored
by Pamoja, a group of five
Stanford black students
endeavoring to raise scholarship
funds.
The concert is slated to begin
at 2:00 p.m. Tickets will be $2.00
at the gate.
This first concert will not be
affected by the University's
current moratorium on rock
concerts in Frost, imposed after
violence marred a summer Cold
Blood-Elvin Bishop concert there.
A Grateful Dead concert that
had been tentatively planned for
this week has been indefinitely
postponed until the Committee of
Public Events studies the situation
this fall. There is a slight
possibility the Dead will play in
Maples Pavilion this fall.
Director of Public Events, Tom
Bacchetti, feels that the type of
music offered this Sunday
presents no problems in crowd
control. "It should be a very
happy, enjoyable afternoon," he
noted. "However, we will be
obviously watching this and every
concert in Frost very carefully."
The student sponsors of the
Sunday jazz concerts have taken
the Swahili name "Pamoja Na

Nafase," which means "together
with opportunity." Their aim is to
provide a steady source of funds
for minority scholarships through
a string of concerts and a
nightclub for black artists in the
campus Women's Clubhouse.
"Pamoja hopes to get the
support of the entire Stanford
community for the Sunday
afternoon concerts and hopes to
make them a Stanford tradition in
the manner of the Children's
Health Council concerts,"
explained Channing Johnson.
"Everyone should bring
blankets, a picnic lunch and be
ready to enjoy a rewarding
afternoon of authentic, up-to-date
black jazz from the finest artists
available," he noted.
The Hutcherson-Land Quintet,
formed in the late 1960'5, features
a unique sound utilizing the
combination of vibraphone and
marimba, tenor saxophone, flute
and oboe. Hutcherson is featured
on vibraphone and marimba, Land
on tenor sax. They have two
albums released on the Blue Note
label; many critics of the jazz
scene have acclaimed the quintet.
Big Black, known as a master
of the conga drums, was originally
the backup band for trumpeter
Hugh Masakela. He has two
well-received albums featuring his
pounding rhythms.
Jerry Garcia is no stranger to
Stanford. Lead guitarist with the
Grateful Dead and pedal steel

artist with the New Riders, Garcia
is one of the very finest guitarists
in America today. He has just
released a solo album with pianist
Howard Wales and has another
recorded.
Playing with Garcia is San
Francisco's venerable organist,
Merle Saunders, who assisted the
Dead in their most recent live
double album. He and Garcia
played a memorable week long
stand at the Matrix last spring.
Tom Fogerty, a guitarist late of
Creedence Clearwater Revival and
drummer Bill Vitt will also be
featured.
