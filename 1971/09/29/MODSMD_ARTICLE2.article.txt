# Football Hassles
## New Status Brings New Pressures 
### FRED MANN Second in a Series 
The athletic triumphs of last year marked the
dawning of a new age for the Stanford football
program. With a reputation for academic quality, and
viewed by the nation's press as one of the centers of
political activism (especially last year), the University
finally gained recognition as a legitimate football
power as well.
Membership in the alumni booster club immedi
ately soared, as did season ticket sales. The football
coaching staff attended post-season coaching clinics
as guest speakers rather than as a part of the
audience.
Some of the members of the championship team
shared the wealth of success—Jim Plunkett became a
super-hero, and other stars received fat contracts for
turning professional. But for other players, the
transformation from a group that could never win the
big ones to one that was champion of the West Coast
was an unpleasant one.
For most of the players in this category,
disillusionment with the game of college football as it
is known today, and unhappiness with the treatment
they received at the hands of the coaches, publicists,
fans, and students did not start as a result of
becoming winners. That merely intensified it.
In recent years, social pressure on the athlete here
had been growing. With everyone no longer wrapped
up in the adventures of the football team, players
were challenged by students and faculty members
who questioned their value to the University. Student
tastes changed, and the new social awareness that
spread across college campuses engulfed Stanford.
While the football team enjoyed its greatest
national attention ever, the school was also making
headlines as the campus that refused to cool down
politically. Although a few athletes had participated
in the massive anti-war activity here in the spring of
1 970, the majority of them either took no active part
in the demonstrations or physically barred the doors
to the radicals. The image of the law and order jock
never seemed stronger.

Some members of the University community
criticized football and those who played it over the
social and political issues of racial and sexual
discrimination.
The Colonist (predecessor to The Real News),
published by black students on campus hit the
coaching staff for stacking black players behind one
another at certain positions, and questioned why a
black was not put in the position which called for the
most thought and judgment, and got the most
glory—namely, quarterback. (Stanford had previously
had a black quarterback, Gene Washington, but
moved him to receiver at his own request. With plans
of turning professional, Washington knew his chances
of becoming the first black pro quarterback were
slim.)
Some people began to protest the obvious sexual
discrimination in the game, and objected to the
archaic ideals of strong, virile manhood it supported.
Others resented the attitude towards women held by
many men connected with the sport.
For example, Andy Sidaris, director of television's
college football game of the week was reported to
have said, "I have come to appreciate the face of a
pretty girl—spectator or cheerleader—at a game. In
fact, during our weekly telecast, I assign one of our
10 cameras to do nothing but focus on what we call
'honey shots." He then went on to rate the schools
with the most beautiful co-eds. (Stanford finished
sixth.)
With the team suddenly a winner, players drew
more attention from everyone, both supporters and
antagonists. Questions that most students had always
wondered about began to be asked more openly:
What are athletes promised to get them to come to
Stanford? How often are admission standards
dropped to allow a potential star to enroll? Are they
encouraged to take Mickey Mouse courses? How are
they treated by their coaches?
Many players were anxious to answer.
Yellow Brick Road
From the time he makes a reputation as a
promising high school football star, a player is on the
road to a supposed paradise via an athletic
scholarship. A top-notch 18-year old will have to
make sure there is plenty of space in his living room
at home to accomodate all the recruiters who will be
anxious to sell him on their school.
Mind-boggling promises have been made in such
bargaining sessions. Occasionally a university will find
itself in trouble for offering too much too openly,
but most schools are discreet with their favors.
No one was able to find out exactly how three
USC football Ail-Americans each managed to cruise
around the Coliseum parking lot in a new car every
year. Nor could it be determined how a University of
Texas fullback and his girlfriend were able to
maintain such stylish and complete wardrobes. But
then again, no one really wanted to know.

At Stanford, recruiting practices seem abnormally
clean. Jim Plunkett never flashed too much money
during his collegiate days. Like at many other
universities, summer jobs and work during the
off-season is arranged by the Stanford athletic
department for what one player termed "incredibly
high wages." But still, such bonuses can't compare to
other schools, such as Southern California, where
football starters are made members of the Screen
Extras Guild and given background parts in
Hollywood films for $30 pay per day.
Honest John?
Stanford's biggest problem, according to some
recruits, is keeping its promises. Although head
football coach John Ralston says he'll "never make a
promise I can't keep," some players felt recruiting
practices were deceitful.
"If they promise you a certain type of offense in
which you will play a major part, and then they
switch it on you, you're being cheated," said former
wide receiver Demea Washington."And now that
Stanford thinks it is a big-time football school,
recruiting can only get worse. They'll have to promise
more, especially to black players in the
Southwest—because they're the ones everybody
wants—and they'll never live up to their promises."
Two black players, Mike Gilyard and Rufus Shaw
claimed they had been promised more than was
delivered. Coach Ralston dismissed their claims as
problems in semantics. "They unfortunately didn't
understand the definition of the term 'full ride' as we
use it out here on the West Coast," he said. "It means
different things in the Southwest Conference. (Both
Shaw and Gilyard are from Texas.) They just
expected too much."
Shaw has left Stanford to play football at
Southern Methodist University (in the Southwest
Conference). Gilyard, after failing to meet with
Ralston following spring practice—a duty of all
players wishing to continue in the fall—was cut from
the squad.
Discussing the claims, Washington remarkea
"That's one of the reasons Stanford did so poorly in
recruiting this year. Once a black brother talks to any
of the black players here now, he's going to find out a
Stanford promise ain't worth nothing. And that's just
what they found out." (Ralston admitted that
Stanford had been able to land less players in
recruiting this year—one that was expected to be their
best ever in view of the Rose Bowl victory—but he
cited the added burden of preparation for post-season
games and the coaching staff's lack of time for
recruiting as the major reason.)
Other criticisms of Stanford recruiting center
around the overseas campus program. It is a major
point in Stanford's favor for recruiting purposes, and
is invariably stressed by the visiting coaches. But once
a football player decides to take advantage of the
opportunity, he finds himself in the dog house with
the athletic department. Kalston is never pleased
when an athlete misses spring practice or part of the
season by studying in Europe.
More Than A Formality
Once recruited, the athlete becomes a part of the
student body just like everyone else. Well, not exactly
like everyone else. The recruit must first be admitted
to the University, but this is hardly more than a
formality at most schools if the athletic department
really wants him. Since Stanford has no official
"admissions standards," there would seem to be no
major obstacles to his acceptance. If he has taken the
proper tests and sent in enough high school grades, he
is eligible to become a student.
No grade point average or test score cutoff points
are used to determine who gets in and who does not.
In fact. Dean of Admissions Fred Hargadon stated
that "Outstanding skills and talents, whether in
athletics, music, art or whatever, are given
consideration in admissions . .
But Hargadon is no pushover for athletic
department recruiters. A strong-minded man with a
reputation for not bowing to outside pressures, he
has, on occasion, made it difficult for the football
coaches. Ralston must cringe when the star of a
Pacific-8 opponent turns out to be a player he
recruited but couldn't get in. "No student is admitted
for whom we do not think there is a reasonable
chance of their successfully pursuing our academic
program," Hargadon said.
Although both the director of athletics and his
assistant deny there is any pressure put on the
admissions committee to accept an outstanding
athlete, Hargadon stated that such pressure exists,
and comes from all sides, not only the athletic
department. He termed their attempts at persuasion
"neither flagrant nor excessive." But a spokesman in
the admissions office went further, saying, "There is
lots of pressure from the athletic department. The
admissions office is made constantly aware of guys'
talents on the field, and it is often the case that they
are admitted with considerably lower credentials than
most of those in the applicant pool."
Buck Club Bucks
For many recruits, the financial burden of playing
at Stanford is very high. Tuition alone runs nearly
$2,700 per year. But many find relief through

"grand-in-aid" scholarships from the alumni booster
group, the Buck Club, and from the $70,000 of
endowed funds earmarked for athletic scholarships.
Last year, the Buck Club contributed $253,524 to
80 football players seeking aid, and added almost
$200 ,000 more for athletes competing in other
sports.
Of course once a football player is admitted, he
must maintain at least a 1.6 grade point average
according to league rules. Stories of universities
getting around such problems are familiar to
everyone. The tutors, ghostwriters and basket
weaving classes are as much a part of college football
as are half-time shows. A favorite class for athletes at
UCLA is Gypsy Folklore where "the professor tells
fairy tales, and plays the fiddle." Often when the
player's final season is over and the scholarship has
run out, the tutors disappear, the required classes
remain, and the athlete leaves without a diploma.
Although the athletic department supplies the
tutors, and it is widely rumored that more than a few
papers supposedly done by the University's so-called
"student-athletes" actually flow from other pens,
Stanford again appears to be relatively clean. In the
fall of 1 967 , the Daily uncovered a class called Health
Education 4 00 which the athletic department had
encouraged players to take if their grades needed
lifting. The class, which required no term papers and
no exams, could be taken for up to 16 units per
quarter. Grading was done simply by the number of
"abstracts" handed in; the more abstracts, the higher
the grade.
At the time the content of the course was
publicized, Athletic Director Chuck Taylor defended
his action of recommending the course saying that he
had taken the same course as an undergraduate at
Stanford. He called it"the best class I ever took."
Social Segregation
Today, Health Ed 400 is dead and buried, and the
athletic department is not making any more such
recommendations. In fact, over 90 percent of all
Stanford athletes do graduate, a percentage
unmatched among rival football schools. But even if
players are now diversifying their academic load
more, and coming in contact more often with the
general student body in classes and at sit-ins, they are
still very much segregated socially.
Stanford does not have an athletic dormatory like

many other universities do, but it does nave the
normal substitute—the jock house. In this case, the
fraternity is Delta Tau Delta, or simply the Delts. The
coaches encourage the freshmen football players to
pledge the Delt house because, according to former
back-up quarterback Ron Fujikawa, "They (the
coaches) feel this will help them get the 100 percent
dedication and go-go spirit they like."
Close to 4 0 members of the football team reside
there annually, although a larger and larger number of
the players are moving out after only a short stay.
Tim McClure, for three years a hard-hitting defensive
guard for Stanford, now an equally tough critic of the
college football system and recently the author of a
controversial LOOK Magazine article condemning the
sport, called the Delt house, "a center for numbing
insensitivity and just plain dumbness." A former Delt
himself, he added, "The emphasis there is placed on
stupidity and ignornace. Everyone conforms to a
numbing mean. There is no interest in individuality,
initiative, study, or reading. The Delt house is the
epitome of what is wrong with all fraternities."
Hairy Problem
Another segregating factor is hair. It is still an issue
with football coaches everywhere who fear that
alumni and older fans would feel uneasy about
bringing their young hero-worshipping children to the
stadium if the quarterback looked like a freak. Or
even like today's average student. Haircuts out of the
195 0 's are still standard on every football field, but
off the field, they make even a small defensive back a
little noticeable.
Stanford's new quarterback Don Bunce has hair
that shows out the back of his helmet, and his coach
tolerates it. But any longer, and the athletic staff is
unhappy. When lineman Steve Jubb hurt an ankle
playing rugby during the off-season, his newly grown
long locks reportedly bothered the Stanford trainer
enough to make him refuse to treat Jubb until he got
a haircut.
"It's only natural for people to treat us (football
players) as if we were only as deep as a page in a
football program," said McClure. "We are supposed
to be an isolated, closed group, whose only purpose
in being at Stanford is to give people vicarious thrills
on a Saturday afternoon." But he feels the fans are
not the only ones who use the players.

No one was able to find out exactly how three
USC football Ail-Americans each managed to cruise
around the Coliseum parking lot in a new car every
year. Nor could it be determined how a University of
Texas fullback and his girlfriend were able to
maintain such stylish and complete wardrobes. But
then again, no one really wanted to know.

At Stanford, recruiting practices seem abnormally
clean. Jim Plunkett never flashed too much money
during his collegiate days. Like at many other
universities, summer jobs and work during the
off-season is arranged by the Stanford athletic
department for what one player termed "incredibly
high wages." But still, such bonuses can't compare to
other schools, such as Southern California, where
football starters are made members of the Screen
Extras Guild and given background parts in
Hollywood films for $30 pay per day.
Honest John?
Stanford's biggest problem, according to some
recruits, is keeping its promises. Although head
football coach John Ralston says he'll "never make a
promise I can't keep," some players felt recruiting
practices were deceitful.
"If they promise you a certain type of offense in
which you will play a major part, and then they
switch it on you, you're being cheated," said former
wide receiver Demea Washington."And now that
Stanford thinks it is a big-time football school,
recruiting can only get worse. They'll have to promise
more, especially to black players in the
Southwest—because they're the ones everybody
wants—and they'll never live up to their promises."
Two black players, Mike Gilyard and Rufus Shaw
claimed they had been promised more than was
delivered. Coach Ralston dismissed their claims as
problems in semantics. "They unfortunately didn't
understand the definition of the term 'full ride' as we
use it out here on the West Coast," he said. "It means
different things in the Southwest Conference. (Both
Shaw and Gilyard are from Texas.) They just
expected too much."
Shaw has left Stanford to play football at
Southern Methodist University (in the Southwest
Conference). Gilyard, after failing to meet with
Ralston following spring practice—a duty of all
players wishing to continue in the fall—was cut from
the squad.
Discussing the claims, Washington remarkea
"That's one of the reasons Stanford did so poorly in
recruiting this year. Once a black brother talks to any
of the black players here now, he's going to find out a
Stanford promise ain't worth nothing. And that's just
what they found out." (Ralston admitted that
Stanford had been able to land less players in
recruiting this year—one that was expected to be their
best ever in view of the Rose Bowl victory—but he
cited the added burden of preparation for post-season
games and the coaching staff's lack of time for
recruiting as the major reason.)
Other criticisms of Stanford recruiting center
around the overseas campus program. It is a major
point in Stanford's favor for recruiting purposes, and
is invariably stressed by the visiting coaches. But once
a football player decides to take advantage of the
opportunity, he finds himself in the dog house with
the athletic department. Kalston is never pleased
when an athlete misses spring practice or part of the
season by studying in Europe.
More Than A Formality
Once recruited, the athlete becomes a part of the
student body just like everyone else. Well, not exactly
like everyone else. The recruit must first be admitted
to the University, but this is hardly more than a
formality at most schools if the athletic department
really wants him. Since Stanford has no official
"admissions standards," there would seem to be no
major obstacles to his acceptance. If he has taken the
proper tests and sent in enough high school grades, he
is eligible to become a student.
No grade point average or test score cutoff points
are used to determine who gets in and who does not.
In fact. Dean of Admissions Fred Hargadon stated
that "Outstanding skills and talents, whether in
athletics, music, art or whatever, are given
consideration in admissions . .
But Hargadon is no pushover for athletic
department recruiters. A strong-minded man with a
reputation for not bowing to outside pressures, he
has, on occasion, made it difficult for the football
coaches. Ralston must cringe when the star of a
Pacific-8 opponent turns out to be a player he
recruited but couldn't get in. "No student is admitted
for whom we do not think there is a reasonable
chance of their successfully pursuing our academic
program," Hargadon said.
Although both the director of athletics and his
assistant deny there is any pressure put on the
admissions committee to accept an outstanding
athlete, Hargadon stated that such pressure exists,
and comes from all sides, not only the athletic
department. He termed their attempts at persuasion
"neither flagrant nor excessive." But a spokesman in
the admissions office went further, saying, "There is
lots of pressure from the athletic department. The
admissions office is made constantly aware of guys'
talents on the field, and it is often the case that they
are admitted with considerably lower credentials than
most of those in the applicant pool."
Buck Club Bucks
For many recruits, the financial burden of playing
at Stanford is very high. Tuition alone runs nearly
$2,700 per year. But many find relief through

"grand-in-aid" scholarships from the alumni booster
group, the Buck Club, and from the $70,000 of
endowed funds earmarked for athletic scholarships.
Last year, the Buck Club contributed $253,524 to
80 football players seeking aid, and added almost
$200 ,000 more for athletes competing in other
sports.
Of course once a football player is admitted, he
must maintain at least a 1.6 grade point average
according to league rules. Stories of universities
getting around such problems are familiar to
everyone. The tutors, ghostwriters and basket
weaving classes are as much a part of college football
as are half-time shows. A favorite class for athletes at
UCLA is Gypsy Folklore where "the professor tells
fairy tales, and plays the fiddle." Often when the
player's final season is over and the scholarship has
run out, the tutors disappear, the required classes
remain, and the athlete leaves without a diploma.
Although the athletic department supplies the
tutors, and it is widely rumored that more than a few
papers supposedly done by the University's so-called
"student-athletes" actually flow from other pens,
Stanford again appears to be relatively clean. In the
fall of 1 967 , the Daily uncovered a class called Health
Education 4 00 which the athletic department had
encouraged players to take if their grades needed
lifting. The class, which required no term papers and
no exams, could be taken for up to 16 units per
quarter. Grading was done simply by the number of
"abstracts" handed in; the more abstracts, the higher
the grade.
At the time the content of the course was
publicized, Athletic Director Chuck Taylor defended
his action of recommending the course saying that he
had taken the same course as an undergraduate at
Stanford. He called it"the best class I ever took."
Social Segregation
Today, Health Ed 400 is dead and buried, and the
athletic department is not making any more such
recommendations. In fact, over 90 percent of all
Stanford athletes do graduate, a percentage
unmatched among rival football schools. But even if
players are now diversifying their academic load
more, and coming in contact more often with the
general student body in classes and at sit-ins, they are
still very much segregated socially.
Stanford does not have an athletic dormatory like

many other universities do, but it does nave the
normal substitute—the jock house. In this case, the
fraternity is Delta Tau Delta, or simply the Delts. The
coaches encourage the freshmen football players to
pledge the Delt house because, according to former
back-up quarterback Ron Fujikawa, "They (the
coaches) feel this will help them get the 100 percent
dedication and go-go spirit they like."
Close to 4 0 members of the football team reside
there annually, although a larger and larger number of
the players are moving out after only a short stay.
Tim McClure, for three years a hard-hitting defensive
guard for Stanford, now an equally tough critic of the
college football system and recently the author of a
controversial LOOK Magazine article condemning the
sport, called the Delt house, "a center for numbing
insensitivity and just plain dumbness." A former Delt
himself, he added, "The emphasis there is placed on
stupidity and ignornace. Everyone conforms to a
numbing mean. There is no interest in individuality,
initiative, study, or reading. The Delt house is the
epitome of what is wrong with all fraternities."
Hairy Problem
Another segregating factor is hair. It is still an issue
with football coaches everywhere who fear that
alumni and older fans would feel uneasy about
bringing their young hero-worshipping children to the
stadium if the quarterback looked like a freak. Or
even like today's average student. Haircuts out of the
195 0 's are still standard on every football field, but
off the field, they make even a small defensive back a
little noticeable.
Stanford's new quarterback Don Bunce has hair
that shows out the back of his helmet, and his coach
tolerates it. But any longer, and the athletic staff is
unhappy. When lineman Steve Jubb hurt an ankle
playing rugby during the off-season, his newly grown
long locks reportedly bothered the Stanford trainer
enough to make him refuse to treat Jubb until he got
a haircut.
"It's only natural for people to treat us (football
players) as if we were only as deep as a page in a
football program," said McClure. "We are supposed
to be an isolated, closed group, whose only purpose
in being at Stanford is to give people vicarious thrills
on a Saturday afternoon." But he feels the fans are
not the only ones who use the players.

CORNERED—Jackie Brown runs into trouble in the form of Oregon defenders
Bill Drake and Greg Brosterhous in Stanford's 38-17 win last Saturday. With
Hillary Shockley coming off a slight ankle injury, Brown will lead the Indian
rushers against Duke.
The athletic triumphs of last year marked the
dawning of a new age for the Stanford football
program. With a reputation for academic quality, and
viewed by the nation's press as one of the centers of
political activism (especially last year), the University
finally gained recognition as a legitimate football
power as well.
Membership in the alumni booster club immedi
ately soared, as did season ticket sales. The football
coaching staff attended post-season coaching clinics
as guest speakers rather than as a part of the
audience.
Some of the members of the championship team
shared the wealth of success—Jim Plunkett became a
super-hero, and other stars received fat contracts for
turning professional. But for other players, the
transformation from a group that could never win the
big ones to one that was champion of the West Coast
was an unpleasant one.
For most of the players in this category,
disillusionment with the game of college football as it
is known today, and unhappiness with the treatment
they received at the hands of the coaches, publicists,
fans, and students did not start as a result of
becoming winners. That merely intensified it.
In recent years, social pressure on the athlete here
had been growing. With everyone no longer wrapped
up in the adventures of the football team, players
were challenged by students and faculty members
who questioned their value to the University. Student
tastes changed, and the new social awareness that
spread across college campuses engulfed Stanford.
While the football team enjoyed its greatest
national attention ever, the school was also making
headlines as the campus that refused to cool down
politically. Although a few athletes had participated
in the massive anti-war activity here in the spring of
1 970, the majority of them either took no active part
in the demonstrations or physically barred the doors
to the radicals. The image of the law and order jock
never seemed stronger.

Some members of the University community
criticized football and those who played it over the
social and political issues of racial and sexual
discrimination.
The Colonist (predecessor to The Real News),
published by black students on campus hit the
coaching staff for stacking black players behind one
another at certain positions, and questioned why a
black was not put in the position which called for the
most thought and judgment, and got the most
glory—namely, quarterback. (Stanford had previously
had a black quarterback, Gene Washington, but
moved him to receiver at his own request. With plans
of turning professional, Washington knew his chances
of becoming the first black pro quarterback were
slim.)
Some people began to protest the obvious sexual
discrimination in the game, and objected to the
archaic ideals of strong, virile manhood it supported.
Others resented the attitude towards women held by
many men connected with the sport.
For example, Andy Sidaris, director of television's
college football game of the week was reported to
have said, "I have come to appreciate the face of a
pretty girl—spectator or cheerleader—at a game. In
fact, during our weekly telecast, I assign one of our
10 cameras to do nothing but focus on what we call
'honey shots." He then went on to rate the schools
with the most beautiful co-eds. (Stanford finished
sixth.)
With the team suddenly a winner, players drew
more attention from everyone, both supporters and
antagonists. Questions that most students had always
wondered about began to be asked more openly:
What are athletes promised to get them to come to
Stanford? How often are admission standards
dropped to allow a potential star to enroll? Are they
encouraged to take Mickey Mouse courses? How are
they treated by their coaches?
Many players were anxious to answer.
Yellow Brick Road
From the time he makes a reputation as a
promising high school football star, a player is on the
road to a supposed paradise via an athletic
scholarship. A top-notch 18-year old will have to
make sure there is plenty of space in his living room
at home to accomodate all the recruiters who will be
anxious to sell him on their school.
Mind-boggling promises have been made in such
bargaining sessions. Occasionally a university will find
itself in trouble for offering too much too openly,
but most schools are discreet with their favors.
No one was able to find out exactly how three
USC football Ail-Americans each managed to cruise
around the Coliseum parking lot in a new car every

has, on occasion, made it difficult for the football
coaches. Ralston must cringe when the star of a
Pacific-8 opponent turns out to be a player he
recruited but couldn't get in. "No student is admitted
for whom we do not think there is a reasonable
chance of their successfully pursuing our academic
program," Hargadon said.
Although both the director of athletics and his
assistant deny there is any pressure put on the
admissions committee to accept an outstanding
athlete, Hargadon stated that such pressure exists,
and comes from all sides, not only the athletic
department. He termed their attempts at persuasion
"neither flagrant nor excessive." But a spokesman in
the admissions office went further, saying, "There is
lots of pressure from the athletic department. The
admissions office is made constantly aware of guys'
talents on the field, and it is often the case that they
are admitted with considerably lower credentials than
most of those in the applicant pool."
Buck Club Bucks
For many recruits, the financial burden of playing
at Stanford is very high. Tuition alone runs nearly
$2,700 per year. But many find relief through

"grand-in-aid" scholarships from the alumni booster
group, the Buck Club, and from the $70,000 of
endowed funds earmarked for athletic scholarships.
Last year, the Buck Club contributed $253,524 to
80 football players seeking aid, and added almost
$200 ,000 more for athletes competing in other
sports.
Of course once a football player is admitted, he
must maintain at least a 1.6 grade point average
according to league rules. Stories of universities
getting around such problems are familiar to
everyone. The tutors, ghostwriters and basket
weaving classes are as much a part of college football
as are half-time shows. A favorite class for athletes at
UCLA is Gypsy Folklore where "the professor tells
fairy tales, and plays the fiddle." Often when the
player's final season is over and the scholarship has
run out, the tutors disappear, the required classes
remain, and the athlete leaves without a diploma.
Although the athletic department supplies the
tutors, and it is widely rumored that more than a few
papers supposedly done by the University's so-called
"student-athletes" actually flow from other pens,
Stanford again appears to be relatively clean. In the
fall of 1 967 , the Daily uncovered a class called Health
Education 4 00 which the athletic department had
encouraged players to take if their grades needed
lifting. The class, which required no term papers and
no exams, could be taken for up to 16 units per
quarter. Grading was done simply by the number of
"abstracts" handed in; the more abstracts, the higher
the grade.
At the time the content of the course was
publicized, Athletic Director Chuck Taylor defended
his action of recommending the course saying that he
had taken the same course as an undergraduate at
Stanford. He called it"the best class I ever took."
Social Segregation
Today, Health Ed 400 is dead and buried, and the
athletic department is not making any more such
recommendations. In fact, over 90 percent of all
Stanford athletes do graduate, a percentage
unmatched among rival football schools. But even if
players are now diversifying their academic load
more, and coming in contact more often with the
general student body in classes and at sit-ins, they are
still very much segregated socially.
Stanford does not have an athletic dormatory like

many other universities do, but it does nave the
normal substitute—the jock house. In this case, the
fraternity is Delta Tau Delta, or simply the Delts. The
coaches encourage the freshmen football players to
pledge the Delt house because, according to former
back-up quarterback Ron Fujikawa, "They (the
coaches) feel this will help them get the 100 percent
dedication and go-go spirit they like."
Close to 4 0 members of the football team reside
there annually, although a larger and larger number of
the players are moving out after only a short stay.
Tim McClure, for three years a hard-hitting defensive
guard for Stanford, now an equally tough critic of the
college football system and recently the author of a
controversial LOOK Magazine article condemning the
sport, called the Delt house, "a center for numbing
insensitivity and just plain dumbness." A former Delt
himself, he added, "The emphasis there is placed on
stupidity and ignornace. Everyone conforms to a
numbing mean. There is no interest in individuality,
initiative, study, or reading. The Delt house is the
epitome of what is wrong with all fraternities."
Hairy Problem
Another segregating factor is hair. It is still an issue
with football coaches everywhere who fear that
alumni and older fans would feel uneasy about
bringing their young hero-worshipping children to the
stadium if the quarterback looked like a freak. Or
even like today's average student. Haircuts out of the
195 0 's are still standard on every football field, but
off the field, they make even a small defensive back a
little noticeable.
Stanford's new quarterback Don Bunce has hair
that shows out the back of his helmet, and his coach
tolerates it. But any longer, and the athletic staff is
unhappy. When lineman Steve Jubb hurt an ankle
playing rugby during the off-season, his newly grown
long locks reportedly bothered the Stanford trainer
enough to make him refuse to treat Jubb until he got
a haircut.
"It's only natural for people to treat us (football
players) as if we were only as deep as a page in a
football program," said McClure. "We are supposed
to be an isolated, closed group, whose only purpose
in being at Stanford is to give people vicarious thrills
on a Saturday afternoon." But he feels the fans are
not the only ones who use the players.

CORNERED—Jackie Brown runs into trouble in the form of Oregon defenders
Bill Drake and Greg Brosterhous in Stanford's 38-17 win last Saturday. With
Hillary Shockley coming off a slight ankle injury, Brown will lead the Indian
rushers against Duke.
The athletic triumphs of last year marked the
dawning of a new age for the Stanford football
program. With a reputation for academic quality, and
viewed by the nation's press as one of the centers of
political activism (especially last year), the University
finally gained recognition as a legitimate football
power as well.
Membership in the alumni booster club immedi
ately soared, as did season ticket sales. The football
coaching staff attended post-season coaching clinics
as guest speakers rather than as a part of the
audience.
Some of the members of the championship team
shared the wealth of success—Jim Plunkett became a
super-hero, and other stars received fat contracts for
turning professional. But for other players, the
transformation from a group that could never win the
big ones to one that was champion of the West Coast
was an unpleasant one.
For most of the players in this category,
disillusionment with the game of college football as it
is known today, and unhappiness with the treatment
they received at the hands of the coaches, publicists,
fans, and students did not start as a result of
becoming winners. That merely intensified it.
In recent years, social pressure on the athlete here
had been growing. With everyone no longer wrapped
up in the adventures of the football team, players
were challenged by students and faculty members
who questioned their value to the University. Student
tastes changed, and the new social awareness that
spread across college campuses engulfed Stanford.
While the football team enjoyed its greatest
national attention ever, the school was also making
headlines as the campus that refused to cool down
politically. Although a few athletes had participated
in the massive anti-war activity here in the spring of
1 970, the majority of them either took no active part
in the demonstrations or physically barred the doors
to the radicals. The image of the law and order jock
never seemed stronger.

Some members of the University community
criticized football and those who played it over the
social and political issues of racial and sexual
discrimination.
The Colonist (predecessor to The Real News),
published by black students on campus hit the
coaching staff for stacking black players behind one
another at certain positions, and questioned why a
black was not put in the position which called for the
most thought and judgment, and got the most
glory—namely, quarterback. (Stanford had previously
had a black quarterback, Gene Washington, but
moved him to receiver at his own request. With plans
of turning professional, Washington knew his chances
of becoming the first black pro quarterback were
slim.)
Some people began to protest the obvious sexual
discrimination in the game, and objected to the
archaic ideals of strong, virile manhood it supported.
Others resented the attitude towards women held by
many men connected with the sport.
For example, Andy Sidaris, director of television's
college football game of the week was reported to
have said, "I have come to appreciate the face of a
pretty girl—spectator or cheerleader—at a game. In
fact, during our weekly telecast, I assign one of our
10 cameras to do nothing but focus on what we call
'honey shots." He then went on to rate the schools
with the most beautiful co-eds. (Stanford finished
sixth.)
With the team suddenly a winner, players drew
more attention from everyone, both supporters and
antagonists. Questions that most students had always
wondered about began to be asked more openly:
What are athletes promised to get them to come to
Stanford? How often are admission standards
dropped to allow a potential star to enroll? Are they
encouraged to take Mickey Mouse courses? How are
they treated by their coaches?
Many players were anxious to answer.
Yellow Brick Road
From the time he makes a reputation as a
promising high school football star, a player is on the
road to a supposed paradise via an athletic
scholarship. A top-notch 18-year old will have to
make sure there is plenty of space in his living room
at home to accomodate all the recruiters who will be
anxious to sell him on their school.
Mind-boggling promises have been made in such
bargaining sessions. Occasionally a university will find
itself in trouble for offering too much too openly,
but most schools are discreet with their favors.
No one was able to find out exactly how three
USC football Ail-Americans each managed to cruise
around the Coliseum parking lot in a new car every
year. Nor could it be determined how a University of
Texas fullback and his girlfriend were able to
maintain such stylish and complete wardrobes. But
then again, no one really wanted to know.

At Stanford, recruiting practices seem abnormally
clean. Jim Plunkett never flashed too much money
during his collegiate days. Like at many other
universities, summer jobs and work during the
off-season is arranged by the Stanford athletic
department for what one player termed "incredibly
high wages." But still, such bonuses can't compare to
other schools, such as Southern California, where
football starters are made members of the Screen
Extras Guild and given background parts in
Hollywood films for $30 pay per day.
Honest John?
Stanford's biggest problem, according to some
recruits, is keeping its promises. Although head
football coach John Ralston says he'll "never make a
promise I can't keep," some players felt recruiting
practices were deceitful.
"If they promise you a certain type of offense in
which you will play a major part, and then they
switch it on you, you're being cheated," said former
wide receiver Demea Washington."And now that
Stanford thinks it is a big-time football school,
recruiting can only get worse. They'll have to promise
more, especially to black players in the
Southwest—because they're the ones everybody
wants—and they'll never live up to their promises."
Two black players, Mike Gilyard and Rufus Shaw
claimed they had been promised more than was
delivered. Coach Ralston dismissed their claims as
problems in semantics. "They unfortunately didn't
understand the definition of the term 'full ride' as we
use it out here on the West Coast," he said. "It means
different things in the Southwest Conference. (Both
Shaw and Gilyard are from Texas.) They just
expected too much."
Shaw has left Stanford to play football at
Southern Methodist University (in the Southwest
Conference). Gilyard, after failing to meet with
Ralston following spring practice—a duty of all
players wishing to continue in the fall—was cut from
the squad.
Discussing the claims, Washington remarkea
"That's one of the reasons Stanford did so poorly in
recruiting this year. Once a black brother talks to any
of the black players here now, he's going to find out a
Stanford promise ain't worth nothing. And that's just
what they found out." (Ralston admitted that
Stanford had been able to land less players in
recruiting this year—one that was expected to be their
best ever in view of the Rose Bowl victory—but he
cited the added burden of preparation for post-season
games and the coaching staff's lack of time for
recruiting as the major reason.)
Other criticisms of Stanford recruiting center
around the overseas campus program. It is a major
point in Stanford's favor for recruiting purposes, and
is invariably stressed by the visiting coaches. But once
a football player decides to take advantage of the
opportunity, he finds himself in the dog house with
the athletic department. Kalston is never pleased
when an athlete misses spring practice or part of the
season by studying in Europe.
More Than A Formality
Once recruited, the athlete becomes a part of the
student body just like everyone else. Well, not exactly
like everyone else. The recruit must first be admitted
to the University, but this is hardly more than a
formality at most schools if the athletic department
really wants him. Since Stanford has no official
"admissions standards," there would seem to be no
major obstacles to his acceptance. If he has taken the
proper tests and sent in enough high school grades, he
is eligible to become a student.
No grade point average or test score cutoff points
are used to determine who gets in and who does not.
In fact. Dean of Admissions Fred Hargadon stated
that "Outstanding skills and talents, whether in
athletics, music, art or whatever, are given
consideration in admissions . .
But Hargadon is no pushover for athletic
department recruiters. A strong-minded man with a
reputation for not bowing to outside pressures, he
has, on occasion, made it difficult for the football
coaches. Ralston must cringe when the star of a
Pacific-8 opponent turns out to be a player he
recruited but couldn't get in. "No student is admitted

controversial LOOK Magazine article condemning the
sport, called the Delt house, "a center for numbing
insensitivity and just plain dumbness." A former Delt
himself, he added, "The emphasis there is placed on
stupidity and ignornace. Everyone conforms to a
numbing mean. There is no interest in individuality,
initiative, study, or reading. The Delt house is the
epitome of what is wrong with all fraternities."
Hairy Problem
Another segregating factor is hair. It is still an issue
with football coaches everywhere who fear that
alumni and older fans would feel uneasy about
bringing their young hero-worshipping children to the
stadium if the quarterback looked like a freak. Or
even like today's average student. Haircuts out of the
195 0 's are still standard on every football field, but
off the field, they make even a small defensive back a
little noticeable.
Stanford's new quarterback Don Bunce has hair
that shows out the back of his helmet, and his coach
tolerates it. But any longer, and the athletic staff is
unhappy. When lineman Steve Jubb hurt an ankle
playing rugby during the off-season, his newly grown
long locks reportedly bothered the Stanford trainer
enough to make him refuse to treat Jubb until he got
a haircut.
"It's only natural for people to treat us (football
players) as if we were only as deep as a page in a
football program," said McClure. "We are supposed
to be an isolated, closed group, whose only purpose
in being at Stanford is to give people vicarious thrills
on a Saturday afternoon." But he feels the fans are
not the only ones who use the players.

Bill Drake and Greg Brosterhous in Stanford's 38-17 win last Saturday. With
Hillary Shockley coming off a slight ankle injury, Brown will lead the Indian
rushers against Duke.
The athletic triumphs of last year marked the
dawning of a new age for the Stanford football
program. With a reputation for academic quality, and
viewed by the nation's press as one of the centers of
political activism (especially last year), the University
finally gained recognition as a legitimate football
power as well.
Membership in the alumni booster club immedi
ately soared, as did season ticket sales. The football
coaching staff attended post-season coaching clinics
as guest speakers rather than as a part of the
audience.
Some of the members of the championship team
shared the wealth of success—Jim Plunkett became a
super-hero, and other stars received fat contracts for
turning professional. But for other players, the
transformation from a group that could never win the
big ones to one that was champion of the West Coast
was an unpleasant one.
For most of the players in this category,
disillusionment with the game of college football as it
is known today, and unhappiness with the treatment
they received at the hands of the coaches, publicists,
fans, and students did not start as a result of
becoming winners. That merely intensified it.
In recent years, social pressure on the athlete here
had been growing. With everyone no longer wrapped
up in the adventures of the football team, players
were challenged by students and faculty members
who questioned their value to the University. Student
tastes changed, and the new social awareness that
spread across college campuses engulfed Stanford.
While the football team enjoyed its greatest
national attention ever, the school was also making
headlines as the campus that refused to cool down
politically. Although a few athletes had participated
in the massive anti-war activity here in the spring of
1 970, the majority of them either took no active part
in the demonstrations or physically barred the doors
to the radicals. The image of the law and order jock
never seemed stronger.

Some members of the University community
criticized football and those who played it over the
social and political issues of racial and sexual
discrimination.
The Colonist (predecessor to The Real News),
published by black students on campus hit the
coaching staff for stacking black players behind one
another at certain positions, and questioned why a
black was not put in the position which called for the
most thought and judgment, and got the most
glory—namely, quarterback. (Stanford had previously
had a black quarterback, Gene Washington, but
moved him to receiver at his own request. With plans
of turning professional, Washington knew his chances
of becoming the first black pro quarterback were
slim.)
Some people began to protest the obvious sexual
discrimination in the game, and objected to the
archaic ideals of strong, virile manhood it supported.
Others resented the attitude towards women held by
many men connected with the sport.
For example, Andy Sidaris, director of television's
college football game of the week was reported to
have said, "I have come to appreciate the face of a
pretty girl—spectator or cheerleader—at a game. In
fact, during our weekly telecast, I assign one of our
10 cameras to do nothing but focus on what we call
'honey shots." He then went on to rate the schools
with the most beautiful co-eds. (Stanford finished
sixth.)
With the team suddenly a winner, players drew
more attention from everyone, both supporters and
antagonists. Questions that most students had always
wondered about began to be asked more openly:
What are athletes promised to get them to come to
Stanford? How often are admission standards
dropped to allow a potential star to enroll? Are they
encouraged to take Mickey Mouse courses? How are
they treated by their coaches?
Many players were anxious to answer.
Yellow Brick Road
From the time he makes a reputation as a
promising high school football star, a player is on the
road to a supposed paradise via an athletic
scholarship. A top-notch 18-year old will have to
make sure there is plenty of space in his living room
at home to accomodate all the recruiters who will be
anxious to sell him on their school.
Mind-boggling promises have been made in such
bargaining sessions. Occasionally a university will find
itself in trouble for offering too much too openly,
but most schools are discreet with their favors.
No one was able to find out exactly how three
USC football Ail-Americans each managed to cruise
around the Coliseum parking lot in a new car every
year. Nor could it be determined how a University of
Texas fullback and his girlfriend were able to
maintain such stylish and complete wardrobes. But
then again, no one really wanted to know.

At Stanford, recruiting practices seem abnormally
clean. Jim Plunkett never flashed too much money
during his collegiate days. Like at many other
universities, summer jobs and work during the
off-season is arranged by the Stanford athletic
department for what one player termed "incredibly
high wages." But still, such bonuses can't compare to
other schools, such as Southern California, where
football starters are made members of the Screen
Extras Guild and given background parts in
Hollywood films for $30 pay per day.
Honest John?
Stanford's biggest problem, according to some
recruits, is keeping its promises. Although head
football coach John Ralston says he'll "never make a
promise I can't keep," some players felt recruiting
practices were deceitful.
"If they promise you a certain type of offense in
which you will play a major part, and then they
switch it on you, you're being cheated," said former
wide receiver Demea Washington."And now that
Stanford thinks it is a big-time football school,
recruiting can only get worse. They'll have to promise
more, especially to black players in the
Southwest—because they're the ones everybody
wants—and they'll never live up to their promises."
Two black players, Mike Gilyard and Rufus Shaw
claimed they had been promised more than was
delivered. Coach Ralston dismissed their claims as
problems in semantics. "They unfortunately didn't
understand the definition of the term 'full ride' as we
use it out here on the West Coast," he said. "It means
different things in the Southwest Conference. (Both
Shaw and Gilyard are from Texas.) They just
expected too much."
Shaw has left Stanford to play football at
Southern Methodist University (in the Southwest
Conference). Gilyard, after failing to meet with
Ralston following spring practice—a duty of all
players wishing to continue in the fall—was cut from
the squad.
Discussing the claims, Washington remarkea
"That's one of the reasons Stanford did so poorly in
recruiting this year. Once a black brother talks to any
of the black players here now, he's going to find out a
Stanford promise ain't worth nothing. And that's just
what they found out." (Ralston admitted that
Stanford had been able to land less players in
recruiting this year—one that was expected to be their
best ever in view of the Rose Bowl victory—but he
cited the added burden of preparation for post-season
games and the coaching staff's lack of time for
recruiting as the major reason.)
Other criticisms of Stanford recruiting center
around the overseas campus program. It is a major
point in Stanford's favor for recruiting purposes, and
is invariably stressed by the visiting coaches. But once
a football player decides to take advantage of the
opportunity, he finds himself in the dog house with
the athletic department. Kalston is never pleased
when an athlete misses spring practice or part of the
season by studying in Europe.
More Than A Formality
Once recruited, the athlete becomes a part of the
student body just like everyone else. Well, not exactly
like everyone else. The recruit must first be admitted
to the University, but this is hardly more than a
formality at most schools if the athletic department
really wants him. Since Stanford has no official
"admissions standards," there would seem to be no
major obstacles to his acceptance. If he has taken the
proper tests and sent in enough high school grades, he
is eligible to become a student.
No grade point average or test score cutoff points
are used to determine who gets in and who does not.
In fact. Dean of Admissions Fred Hargadon stated
that "Outstanding skills and talents, whether in
athletics, music, art or whatever, are given
consideration in admissions . .
But Hargadon is no pushover for athletic
department recruiters. A strong-minded man with a
reputation for not bowing to outside pressures, he
has, on occasion, made it difficult for the football
coaches. Ralston must cringe when the star of a
Pacific-8 opponent turns out to be a player he
recruited but couldn't get in. "No student is admitted
for whom we do not think there is a reasonable
chance of their successfully pursuing our academic
program," Hargadon said.
Although both the director of athletics and his
assistant deny there is any pressure put on the
admissions committee to accept an outstanding
athlete, Hargadon stated that such pressure exists,
and comes from all sides, not only the athletic
department. He termed their attempts at persuasion
"neither flagrant nor excessive." But a spokesman in
the admissions office went further, saying, "There is
lots of pressure from the athletic department. The
admissions office is made constantly aware of guys'
talents on the field, and it is often the case that they
are admitted with considerably lower credentials than
most of those in the applicant pool."
Buck Club Bucks
For many recruits, the financial burden of playing
at Stanford is very high. Tuition alone runs nearly
$2,700 per year. But many find relief through

"grand-in-aid" scholarships from the alumni booster
group, the Buck Club, and from the $70,000 of
endowed funds earmarked for athletic scholarships.
Last year, the Buck Club contributed $253,524 to
80 football players seeking aid, and added almost
$200 ,000 more for athletes competing in other
sports.
Of course once a football player is admitted, he
must maintain at least a 1.6 grade point average
according to league rules. Stories of universities
getting around such problems are familiar to
everyone. The tutors, ghostwriters and basket
weaving classes are as much a part of college football
as are half-time shows. A favorite class for athletes at
UCLA is Gypsy Folklore where "the professor tells
fairy tales, and plays the fiddle." Often when the
player's final season is over and the scholarship has
run out, the tutors disappear, the required classes
remain, and the athlete leaves without a diploma.
Although the athletic department supplies the
tutors, and it is widely rumored that more than a few
papers supposedly done by the University's so-called
"student-athletes" actually flow from other pens,
Stanford again appears to be relatively clean. In the
fall of 1 967 , the Daily uncovered a class called Health
Education 4 00 which the athletic department had
encouraged players to take if their grades needed
lifting. The class, which required no term papers and
no exams, could be taken for up to 16 units per
quarter. Grading was done simply by the number of
"abstracts" handed in; the more abstracts, the higher
the grade.
At the time the content of the course was
publicized, Athletic Director Chuck Taylor defended
his action of recommending the course saying that he
had taken the same course as an undergraduate at
Stanford. He called it"the best class I ever took."
Social Segregation
Today, Health Ed 400 is dead and buried, and the
athletic department is not making any more such
recommendations. In fact, over 90 percent of all
Stanford athletes do graduate, a percentage
unmatched among rival football schools. But even if
players are now diversifying their academic load
more, and coming in contact more often with the
general student body in classes and at sit-ins, they are
still very much segregated socially.
Stanford does not have an athletic dormatory like

many other universities do, but it does nave the
normal substitute—the jock house. In this case, the
fraternity is Delta Tau Delta, or simply the Delts. The
coaches encourage the freshmen football players to
pledge the Delt house because, according to former
back-up quarterback Ron Fujikawa, "They (the
coaches) feel this will help them get the 100 percent
dedication and go-go spirit they like."
Close to 4 0 members of the football team reside
there annually, although a larger and larger number of
the players are moving out after only a short stay.
Tim McClure, for three years a hard-hitting defensive
guard for Stanford, now an equally tough critic of the
college football system and recently the author of a
controversial LOOK Magazine article condemning the
sport, called the Delt house, "a center for numbing
insensitivity and just plain dumbness." A former Delt
himself, he added, "The emphasis there is placed on
stupidity and ignornace. Everyone conforms to a
numbing mean. There is no interest in individuality,
initiative, study, or reading. The Delt house is the

black was not put in the position which called for the
most thought and judgment, and got the most
glory—namely, quarterback. (Stanford had previously
had a black quarterback, Gene Washington, but
moved him to receiver at his own request. With plans
of turning professional, Washington knew his chances
of becoming the first black pro quarterback were
slim.)
Some people began to protest the obvious sexual
discrimination in the game, and objected to the
archaic ideals of strong, virile manhood it supported.
Others resented the attitude towards women held by
many men connected with the sport.
For example, Andy Sidaris, director of television's
college football game of the week was reported to
have said, "I have come to appreciate the face of a
pretty girl—spectator or cheerleader—at a game. In
fact, during our weekly telecast, I assign one of our
10 cameras to do nothing but focus on what we call
'honey shots." He then went on to rate the schools
with the most beautiful co-eds. (Stanford finished
sixth.)
With the team suddenly a winner, players drew
more attention from everyone, both supporters and
antagonists. Questions that most students had always
wondered about began to be asked more openly:
What are athletes promised to get them to come to
Stanford? How often are admission standards
dropped to allow a potential star to enroll? Are they
encouraged to take Mickey Mouse courses? How are
they treated by their coaches?
Many players were anxious to answer.
Yellow Brick Road
From the time he makes a reputation as a
promising high school football star, a player is on the
road to a supposed paradise via an athletic
scholarship. A top-notch 18-year old will have to
make sure there is plenty of space in his living room
at home to accomodate all the recruiters who will be
anxious to sell him on their school.
Mind-boggling promises have been made in such
bargaining sessions. Occasionally a university will find
itself in trouble for offering too much too openly,
but most schools are discreet with their favors.
No one was able to find out exactly how three
USC football Ail-Americans each managed to cruise
around the Coliseum parking lot in a new car every
year. Nor could it be determined how a University of
Texas fullback and his girlfriend were able to
maintain such stylish and complete wardrobes. But
then again, no one really wanted to know.

At Stanford, recruiting practices seem abnormally
clean. Jim Plunkett never flashed too much money
during his collegiate days. Like at many other
universities, summer jobs and work during the
off-season is arranged by the Stanford athletic
department for what one player termed "incredibly
high wages." But still, such bonuses can't compare to
other schools, such as Southern California, where
football starters are made members of the Screen
Extras Guild and given background parts in
Hollywood films for $30 pay per day.
Honest John?
Stanford's biggest problem, according to some
recruits, is keeping its promises. Although head
football coach John Ralston says he'll "never make a
promise I can't keep," some players felt recruiting
practices were deceitful.
"If they promise you a certain type of offense in
which you will play a major part, and then they
switch it on you, you're being cheated," said former
wide receiver Demea Washington."And now that
Stanford thinks it is a big-time football school,
recruiting can only get worse. They'll have to promise
more, especially to black players in the
Southwest—because they're the ones everybody
wants—and they'll never live up to their promises."
Two black players, Mike Gilyard and Rufus Shaw
claimed they had been promised more than was
delivered. Coach Ralston dismissed their claims as
problems in semantics. "They unfortunately didn't
understand the definition of the term 'full ride' as we
use it out here on the West Coast," he said. "It means
different things in the Southwest Conference. (Both
Shaw and Gilyard are from Texas.) They just
expected too much."
Shaw has left Stanford to play football at
Southern Methodist University (in the Southwest
Conference). Gilyard, after failing to meet with
Ralston following spring practice—a duty of all
players wishing to continue in the fall—was cut from
the squad.
Discussing the claims, Washington remarkea
"That's one of the reasons Stanford did so poorly in
recruiting this year. Once a black brother talks to any
of the black players here now, he's going to find out a
Stanford promise ain't worth nothing. And that's just
what they found out." (Ralston admitted that
Stanford had been able to land less players in
recruiting this year—one that was expected to be their
best ever in view of the Rose Bowl victory—but he
cited the added burden of preparation for post-season
games and the coaching staff's lack of time for
recruiting as the major reason.)
Other criticisms of Stanford recruiting center
around the overseas campus program. It is a major
point in Stanford's favor for recruiting purposes, and
is invariably stressed by the visiting coaches. But once
a football player decides to take advantage of the
opportunity, he finds himself in the dog house with
the athletic department. Kalston is never pleased
when an athlete misses spring practice or part of the
season by studying in Europe.
More Than A Formality
Once recruited, the athlete becomes a part of the
student body just like everyone else. Well, not exactly
like everyone else. The recruit must first be admitted
to the University, but this is hardly more than a
formality at most schools if the athletic department
really wants him. Since Stanford has no official
"admissions standards," there would seem to be no
major obstacles to his acceptance. If he has taken the
proper tests and sent in enough high school grades, he
is eligible to become a student.
No grade point average or test score cutoff points
are used to determine who gets in and who does not.
In fact. Dean of Admissions Fred Hargadon stated
that "Outstanding skills and talents, whether in
athletics, music, art or whatever, are given
consideration in admissions . .
But Hargadon is no pushover for athletic
department recruiters. A strong-minded man with a
reputation for not bowing to outside pressures, he
has, on occasion, made it difficult for the football
coaches. Ralston must cringe when the star of a
Pacific-8 opponent turns out to be a player he
recruited but couldn't get in. "No student is admitted
for whom we do not think there is a reasonable
chance of their successfully pursuing our academic
program," Hargadon said.
Although both the director of athletics and his
assistant deny there is any pressure put on the
admissions committee to accept an outstanding
athlete, Hargadon stated that such pressure exists,
and comes from all sides, not only the athletic
department. He termed their attempts at persuasion
"neither flagrant nor excessive." But a spokesman in
the admissions office went further, saying, "There is
lots of pressure from the athletic department. The
admissions office is made constantly aware of guys'
talents on the field, and it is often the case that they
are admitted with considerably lower credentials than
most of those in the applicant pool."
Buck Club Bucks
For many recruits, the financial burden of playing
at Stanford is very high. Tuition alone runs nearly
$2,700 per year. But many find relief through

"grand-in-aid" scholarships from the alumni booster
group, the Buck Club, and from the $70,000 of
endowed funds earmarked for athletic scholarships.
Last year, the Buck Club contributed $253,524 to
80 football players seeking aid, and added almost
$200 ,000 more for athletes competing in other
sports.
Of course once a football player is admitted, he
must maintain at least a 1.6 grade point average
according to league rules. Stories of universities
getting around such problems are familiar to
everyone. The tutors, ghostwriters and basket
weaving classes are as much a part of college football
as are half-time shows. A favorite class for athletes at
UCLA is Gypsy Folklore where "the professor tells
fairy tales, and plays the fiddle." Often when the
player's final season is over and the scholarship has
run out, the tutors disappear, the required classes
remain, and the athlete leaves without a diploma.
Although the athletic department supplies the
tutors, and it is widely rumored that more than a few
papers supposedly done by the University's so-called
"student-athletes" actually flow from other pens,
Stanford again appears to be relatively clean. In the
fall of 1 967 , the Daily uncovered a class called Health
Education 4 00 which the athletic department had
encouraged players to take if their grades needed
lifting. The class, which required no term papers and
no exams, could be taken for up to 16 units per
quarter. Grading was done simply by the number of
"abstracts" handed in; the more abstracts, the higher
the grade.
At the time the content of the course was
publicized, Athletic Director Chuck Taylor defended
his action of recommending the course saying that he
had taken the same course as an undergraduate at
Stanford. He called it"the best class I ever took."
Social Segregation
Today, Health Ed 400 is dead and buried, and the
athletic department is not making any more such
recommendations. In fact, over 90 percent of all
Stanford athletes do graduate, a percentage
unmatched among rival football schools. But even if
players are now diversifying their academic load
more, and coming in contact more often with the
general student body in classes and at sit-ins, they are
still very much segregated socially.
Stanford does not have an athletic dormatory like

many other universities do, but it does nave the
normal substitute—the jock house. In this case, the
fraternity is Delta Tau Delta, or simply the Delts. The
coaches encourage the freshmen football players to
pledge the Delt house because, according to former
back-up quarterback Ron Fujikawa, "They (the
coaches) feel this will help them get the 100 percent
dedication and go-go spirit they like."
Close to 4 0 members of the football team reside
there annually, although a larger and larger number of
the players are moving out after only a short stay.
Tim McClure, for three years a hard-hitting defensive
guard for Stanford, now an equally tough critic of the
college football system and recently the author of a
controversial LOOK Magazine article condemning the
sport, called the Delt house, "a center for numbing
insensitivity and just plain dumbness." A former Delt
himself, he added, "The emphasis there is placed on
stupidity and ignornace. Everyone conforms to a
numbing mean. There is no interest in individuality,
initiative, study, or reading. The Delt house is the
epitome of what is wrong with all fraternities."
Hairy Problem
Another segregating factor is hair. It is still an issue
with football coaches everywhere who fear that
alumni and older fans would feel uneasy about
bringing their young hero-worshipping children to the
stadium if the quarterback looked like a freak. Or
even like today's average student. Haircuts out of the
195 0 's are still standard on every football field, but
off the field, they make even a small defensive back a
little noticeable.
Stanford's new quarterback Don Bunce has hair
that shows out the back of his helmet, and his coach
tolerates it. But any longer, and the athletic staff is
unhappy. When lineman Steve Jubb hurt an ankle
playing rugby during the off-season, his newly grown
long locks reportedly bothered the Stanford trainer
enough to make him refuse to treat Jubb until he got
a haircut.
"It's only natural for people to treat us (football
players) as if we were only as deep as a page in a
football program," said McClure. "We are supposed
to be an isolated, closed group, whose only purpose
in being at Stanford is to give people vicarious thrills
on a Saturday afternoon." But he feels the fans are
not the only ones who use the players.

CORNERED—Jackie Brown runs into trouble in the form of Oregon defenders
Bill Drake and Greg Brosterhous in Stanford's 38-17 win last Saturday. With
Hillary Shockley coming off a slight ankle injury, Brown will lead the Indian
rushers against Duke.
The athletic triumphs of last year marked the
dawning of a new age for the Stanford football
program. With a reputation for academic quality, and
viewed by the nation's press as one of the centers of
political activism (especially last year), the University
finally gained recognition as a legitimate football
power as well.
Membership in the alumni booster club immedi
ately soared, as did season ticket sales. The football
coaching staff attended post-season coaching clinics
as guest speakers rather than as a part of the
audience.
Some of the members of the championship team
shared the wealth of success—Jim Plunkett became a
super-hero, and other stars received fat contracts for
turning professional. But for other players, the
transformation from a group that could never win the
big ones to one that was champion of the West Coast
was an unpleasant one.
For most of the players in this category,
disillusionment with the game of college football as it
is known today, and unhappiness with the treatment
they received at the hands of the coaches, publicists,
fans, and students did not start as a result of
becoming winners. That merely intensified it.
In recent years, social pressure on the athlete here
had been growing. With everyone no longer wrapped
up in the adventures of the football team, players
were challenged by students and faculty members
who questioned their value to the University. Student
tastes changed, and the new social awareness that
spread across college campuses engulfed Stanford.
While the football team enjoyed its greatest
national attention ever, the school was also making
headlines as the campus that refused to cool down
politically. Although a few athletes had participated
in the massive anti-war activity here in the spring of
1 970, the majority of them either took no active part
in the demonstrations or physically barred the doors
to the radicals. The image of the law and order jock
never seemed stronger.

Some members of the University community
criticized football and those who played it over the
social and political issues of racial and sexual
discrimination.
The Colonist (predecessor to The Real News),
published by black students on campus hit the
coaching staff for stacking black players behind one
another at certain positions, and questioned why a
black was not put in the position which called for the
most thought and judgment, and got the most
glory—namely, quarterback. (Stanford had previously
had a black quarterback, Gene Washington, but

players wishing to continue in the fall—was cut from
the squad.
Discussing the claims, Washington remarkea
"That's one of the reasons Stanford did so poorly in
recruiting this year. Once a black brother talks to any
of the black players here now, he's going to find out a
Stanford promise ain't worth nothing. And that's just
what they found out." (Ralston admitted that
Stanford had been able to land less players in
recruiting this year—one that was expected to be their
best ever in view of the Rose Bowl victory—but he
cited the added burden of preparation for post-season
games and the coaching staff's lack of time for
recruiting as the major reason.)
Other criticisms of Stanford recruiting center
around the overseas campus program. It is a major
point in Stanford's favor for recruiting purposes, and
is invariably stressed by the visiting coaches. But once
a football player decides to take advantage of the
opportunity, he finds himself in the dog house with
the athletic department. Kalston is never pleased
when an athlete misses spring practice or part of the
season by studying in Europe.
More Than A Formality
Once recruited, the athlete becomes a part of the
student body just like everyone else. Well, not exactly
like everyone else. The recruit must first be admitted
to the University, but this is hardly more than a
formality at most schools if the athletic department
really wants him. Since Stanford has no official
"admissions standards," there would seem to be no
major obstacles to his acceptance. If he has taken the
proper tests and sent in enough high school grades, he
is eligible to become a student.
No grade point average or test score cutoff points
are used to determine who gets in and who does not.
In fact. Dean of Admissions Fred Hargadon stated
that "Outstanding skills and talents, whether in
athletics, music, art or whatever, are given
consideration in admissions . .
But Hargadon is no pushover for athletic
department recruiters. A strong-minded man with a
reputation for not bowing to outside pressures, he
has, on occasion, made it difficult for the football
coaches. Ralston must cringe when the star of a
Pacific-8 opponent turns out to be a player he
recruited but couldn't get in. "No student is admitted
for whom we do not think there is a reasonable
chance of their successfully pursuing our academic
program," Hargadon said.
Although both the director of athletics and his
assistant deny there is any pressure put on the
admissions committee to accept an outstanding
athlete, Hargadon stated that such pressure exists,
and comes from all sides, not only the athletic
department. He termed their attempts at persuasion
"neither flagrant nor excessive." But a spokesman in
the admissions office went further, saying, "There is
lots of pressure from the athletic department. The
admissions office is made constantly aware of guys'
talents on the field, and it is often the case that they
are admitted with considerably lower credentials than
most of those in the applicant pool."
Buck Club Bucks
For many recruits, the financial burden of playing
at Stanford is very high. Tuition alone runs nearly
$2,700 per year. But many find relief through

"grand-in-aid" scholarships from the alumni booster
group, the Buck Club, and from the $70,000 of
endowed funds earmarked for athletic scholarships.
Last year, the Buck Club contributed $253,524 to
80 football players seeking aid, and added almost
$200 ,000 more for athletes competing in other
sports.
Of course once a football player is admitted, he
must maintain at least a 1.6 grade point average
according to league rules. Stories of universities
getting around such problems are familiar to
everyone. The tutors, ghostwriters and basket
weaving classes are as much a part of college football
as are half-time shows. A favorite class for athletes at
UCLA is Gypsy Folklore where "the professor tells
fairy tales, and plays the fiddle." Often when the
player's final season is over and the scholarship has
run out, the tutors disappear, the required classes
remain, and the athlete leaves without a diploma.
Although the athletic department supplies the
tutors, and it is widely rumored that more than a few
papers supposedly done by the University's so-called
"student-athletes" actually flow from other pens,
Stanford again appears to be relatively clean. In the
fall of 1 967 , the Daily uncovered a class called Health
Education 4 00 which the athletic department had
encouraged players to take if their grades needed
lifting. The class, which required no term papers and
no exams, could be taken for up to 16 units per
quarter. Grading was done simply by the number of
"abstracts" handed in; the more abstracts, the higher
the grade.
At the time the content of the course was
publicized, Athletic Director Chuck Taylor defended
his action of recommending the course saying that he
had taken the same course as an undergraduate at
Stanford. He called it"the best class I ever took."
Social Segregation
Today, Health Ed 400 is dead and buried, and the
athletic department is not making any more such
recommendations. In fact, over 90 percent of all
Stanford athletes do graduate, a percentage
unmatched among rival football schools. But even if
players are now diversifying their academic load
more, and coming in contact more often with the
general student body in classes and at sit-ins, they are
still very much segregated socially.
Stanford does not have an athletic dormatory like

many other universities do, but it does nave the
normal substitute—the jock house. In this case, the
fraternity is Delta Tau Delta, or simply the Delts. The
coaches encourage the freshmen football players to
pledge the Delt house because, according to former
back-up quarterback Ron Fujikawa, "They (the
coaches) feel this will help them get the 100 percent
dedication and go-go spirit they like."
Close to 4 0 members of the football team reside
there annually, although a larger and larger number of
the players are moving out after only a short stay.
Tim McClure, for three years a hard-hitting defensive
guard for Stanford, now an equally tough critic of the
college football system and recently the author of a
controversial LOOK Magazine article condemning the
sport, called the Delt house, "a center for numbing
insensitivity and just plain dumbness." A former Delt
himself, he added, "The emphasis there is placed on
stupidity and ignornace. Everyone conforms to a
numbing mean. There is no interest in individuality,
initiative, study, or reading. The Delt house is the
epitome of what is wrong with all fraternities."
Hairy Problem
Another segregating factor is hair. It is still an issue
with football coaches everywhere who fear that
alumni and older fans would feel uneasy about
bringing their young hero-worshipping children to the
stadium if the quarterback looked like a freak. Or
even like today's average student. Haircuts out of the
195 0 's are still standard on every football field, but
off the field, they make even a small defensive back a
little noticeable.
Stanford's new quarterback Don Bunce has hair
that shows out the back of his helmet, and his coach
tolerates it. But any longer, and the athletic staff is
unhappy. When lineman Steve Jubb hurt an ankle
playing rugby during the off-season, his newly grown
long locks reportedly bothered the Stanford trainer
enough to make him refuse to treat Jubb until he got
a haircut.
"It's only natural for people to treat us (football
players) as if we were only as deep as a page in a
football program," said McClure. "We are supposed
to be an isolated, closed group, whose only purpose
in being at Stanford is to give people vicarious thrills
on a Saturday afternoon." But he feels the fans are
not the only ones who use the players.

CORNERED—Jackie Brown runs into trouble in the form of Oregon defenders
Bill Drake and Greg Brosterhous in Stanford's 38-17 win last Saturday. With
Hillary Shockley coming off a slight ankle injury, Brown will lead the Indian
rushers against Duke.
The athletic triumphs of last year marked the
dawning of a new age for the Stanford football
program. With a reputation for academic quality, and
viewed by the nation's press as one of the centers of
political activism (especially last year), the University
finally gained recognition as a legitimate football
power as well.
Membership in the alumni booster club immedi
ately soared, as did season ticket sales. The football
coaching staff attended post-season coaching clinics
as guest speakers rather than as a part of the
audience.
Some of the members of the championship team
shared the wealth of success—Jim Plunkett became a
super-hero, and other stars received fat contracts for
turning professional. But for other players, the
transformation from a group that could never win the
big ones to one that was champion of the West Coast
was an unpleasant one.
For most of the players in this category,
disillusionment with the game of college football as it
is known today, and unhappiness with the treatment
they received at the hands of the coaches, publicists,
fans, and students did not start as a result of
becoming winners. That merely intensified it.
In recent years, social pressure on the athlete here
had been growing. With everyone no longer wrapped
up in the adventures of the football team, players
were challenged by students and faculty members
who questioned their value to the University. Student
tastes changed, and the new social awareness that
spread across college campuses engulfed Stanford.
While the football team enjoyed its greatest
national attention ever, the school was also making
headlines as the campus that refused to cool down
politically. Although a few athletes had participated
in the massive anti-war activity here in the spring of
1 970, the majority of them either took no active part
in the demonstrations or physically barred the doors
to the radicals. The image of the law and order jock
never seemed stronger.

Some members of the University community
criticized football and those who played it over the
social and political issues of racial and sexual
discrimination.
The Colonist (predecessor to The Real News),
published by black students on campus hit the
coaching staff for stacking black players behind one
another at certain positions, and questioned why a
black was not put in the position which called for the
most thought and judgment, and got the most
glory—namely, quarterback. (Stanford had previously
had a black quarterback, Gene Washington, but
moved him to receiver at his own request. With plans
of turning professional, Washington knew his chances
of becoming the first black pro quarterback were
slim.)
Some people began to protest the obvious sexual
discrimination in the game, and objected to the
archaic ideals of strong, virile manhood it supported.
Others resented the attitude towards women held by
many men connected with the sport.
For example, Andy Sidaris, director of television's
college football game of the week was reported to
have said, "I have come to appreciate the face of a
pretty girl—spectator or cheerleader—at a game. In
fact, during our weekly telecast, I assign one of our
10 cameras to do nothing but focus on what we call
'honey shots." He then went on to rate the schools
with the most beautiful co-eds. (Stanford finished
sixth.)
With the team suddenly a winner, players drew
more attention from everyone, both supporters and
antagonists. Questions that most students had always
wondered about began to be asked more openly:
What are athletes promised to get them to come to
Stanford? How often are admission standards
dropped to allow a potential star to enroll? Are they
encouraged to take Mickey Mouse courses? How are
they treated by their coaches?
Many players were anxious to answer.
Yellow Brick Road
From the time he makes a reputation as a
promising high school football star, a player is on the
road to a supposed paradise via an athletic
scholarship. A top-notch 18-year old will have to
make sure there is plenty of space in his living room
at home to accomodate all the recruiters who will be
anxious to sell him on their school.
Mind-boggling promises have been made in such
bargaining sessions. Occasionally a university will find
itself in trouble for offering too much too openly,
but most schools are discreet with their favors.
No one was able to find out exactly how three
USC football Ail-Americans each managed to cruise
around the Coliseum parking lot in a new car every
year. Nor could it be determined how a University of
Texas fullback and his girlfriend were able to
maintain such stylish and complete wardrobes. But
then again, no one really wanted to know.

At Stanford, recruiting practices seem abnormally
clean. Jim Plunkett never flashed too much money
during his collegiate days. Like at many other
universities, summer jobs and work during the
off-season is arranged by the Stanford athletic
department for what one player termed "incredibly
high wages." But still, such bonuses can't compare to
other schools, such as Southern California, where
football starters are made members of the Screen
Extras Guild and given background parts in
Hollywood films for $30 pay per day.
Honest John?
Stanford's biggest problem, according to some
recruits, is keeping its promises. Although head
football coach John Ralston says he'll "never make a
promise I can't keep," some players felt recruiting
practices were deceitful.
"If they promise you a certain type of offense in
which you will play a major part, and then they
switch it on you, you're being cheated," said former
wide receiver Demea Washington."And now that
Stanford thinks it is a big-time football school,
recruiting can only get worse. They'll have to promise
more, especially to black players in the
Southwest—because they're the ones everybody
wants—and they'll never live up to their promises."
Two black players, Mike Gilyard and Rufus Shaw
claimed they had been promised more than was
delivered. Coach Ralston dismissed their claims as
problems in semantics. "They unfortunately didn't
understand the definition of the term 'full ride' as we
use it out here on the West Coast," he said. "It means
different things in the Southwest Conference. (Both
Shaw and Gilyard are from Texas.) They just
expected too much."
Shaw has left Stanford to play football at
Southern Methodist University (in the Southwest
Conference). Gilyard, after failing to meet with
Ralston following spring practice—a duty of all
players wishing to continue in the fall—was cut from
the squad.
Discussing the claims, Washington remarkea
"That's one of the reasons Stanford did so poorly in
recruiting this year. Once a black brother talks to any
of the black players here now, he's going to find out a
Stanford promise ain't worth nothing. And that's just
what they found out." (Ralston admitted that
