# Football Hassles
## New Status Brings New Pressures 
### FRED MANN Second in a Series 
The athletic triumphs of last year marked the
dawning of a new age for the Stanford football
program. With a reputation for academic quality, and
viewed by the nation's press as one of the centers of
political activism (especially last year), the University
finally gained recognition as a legitimate football
power as well.
Membership in the alumni booster club immedi
ately soared, as did season ticket sales. The football
coaching staff attended post-season coaching clinics
as guest speakers rather than as a part of the
audience.
Some of the members of the championship team
shared the wealth of success—Jim Plunkett became a
super-hero, and other stars received fat contracts for
turning professional. But for other players, the
transformation from a group that could never win the
big ones to one that was champion of the West Coast
was an unpleasant one.
For most of the players in this category,
disillusionment with the game of college football as it
is known today, and unhappiness with the treatment
they received at the hands of the coaches, publicists,
fans, and students did not start as a result of
becoming winners. That merely intensified it.
In recent years, social pressure on the athlete here
had been growing. With everyone no longer wrapped
up in the adventures of the football team, players
were challenged by students and faculty members
who questioned their value to the University. Student
tastes changed, and the new social awareness that
spread across college campuses engulfed Stanford.
While the football team enjoyed its greatest
national attention ever, the school was also making
headlines as the campus that refused to cool down
politically. Although a few athletes had participated
in the massive anti-war activity here in the spring of
1 970, the majority of them either took no active part
in the demonstrations or physically barred the doors
to the radicals. The image of the law and order jock
never seemed stronger.

Some members of the University community
criticized football and those who played it over the
social and political issues of racial and sexual
discrimination.
The Colonist (predecessor to The Real News),
published by black students on campus hit the
coaching staff for stacking black players behind one
another at certain positions, and questioned why a
black was not put in the position which called for the
most thought and judgment, and got the most
glory—namely, quarterback. (Stanford had previously
had a black quarterback, Gene Washington, but
moved him to receiver at his own request. With plans
of turning professional, Washington knew his chances
of becoming the first black pro quarterback were
slim.)
Some people began to protest the obvious sexual
discrimination in the game, and objected to the
archaic ideals of strong, virile manhood it supported.
Others resented the attitude towards women held by
many men connected with the sport.
For example, Andy Sidaris, director of television's
college football game of the week was reported to
have said, "I have come to appreciate the face of a
pretty girl—spectator or cheerleader—at a game. In
fact, during our weekly telecast, I assign one of our
10 cameras to do nothing but focus on what we call
'honey shots." He then went on to rate the schools
with the most beautiful co-eds. (Stanford finished
sixth.)
With the team suddenly a winner, players drew
more attention from everyone, both supporters and
antagonists. Questions that most students had always
wondered about began to be asked more openly:
What are athletes promised to get them to come to
Stanford? How often are admission standards
dropped to allow a potential star to enroll? Are they
encouraged to take Mickey Mouse courses? How are
they treated by their coaches?
Many players were anxious to answer.
Yellow Brick Road
From the time he makes a reputation as a
promising high school football star, a player is on the
road to a supposed paradise via an athletic
scholarship. A top-notch 18-year old will have to
make sure there is plenty of space in his living room
at home to accomodate all the recruiters who will be
anxious to sell him on their school.
Mind-boggling promises have been made in such
bargaining sessions. Occasionally a university will find
itself in trouble for offering too much too openly,
but most schools are discreet with their favors.
No one was able to find out exactly how three
USC football Ail-Americans each managed to cruise
around the Coliseum parking lot in a new car every
year. Nor could it be determined how a University of
Texas fullback and his girlfriend were able to
maintain such stylish and complete wardrobes. But
then again, no one really wanted to know.

At Stanford, recruiting practices seem abnormally
clean. Jim Plunkett never flashed too much money
during his collegiate days. Like at many other
universities, summer jobs and work during the
off-season is arranged by the Stanford athletic
department for what one player termed "incredibly
high wages." But still, such bonuses can't compare to
other schools, such as Southern California, where
football starters are made members of the Screen
Extras Guild and given background parts in
Hollywood films for $30 pay per day.
Honest John?
Stanford's biggest problem, according to some
recruits, is keeping its promises. Although head
football coach John Ralston says he'll "never make a
promise I can't keep," some players felt recruiting
practices were deceitful.
"If they promise you a certain type of offense in
which you will play a major part, and then they
switch it on you, you're being cheated," said former
wide receiver Demea Washington."And now that
Stanford thinks it is a big-time football school,
recruiting can only get worse. They'll have to promise
more, especially to black players in the
Southwest—because they're the ones everybody
wants—and they'll never live up to their promises."
Two black players, Mike Gilyard and Rufus Shaw
claimed they had been promised more than was
delivered. Coach Ralston dismissed their claims as
problems in semantics. "They unfortunately didn't
understand the definition of the term 'full ride' as we
use it out here on the West Coast," he said. "It means
different things in the Southwest Conference. (Both
Shaw and Gilyard are from Texas.) They just
expected too much."
Shaw has left Stanford to play football at
Southern Methodist University (in the Southwest
Conference). Gilyard, after failing to meet with
Ralston following spring practice—a duty of all
players wishing to continue in the fall—was cut from
the squad.
Discussing the claims, Washington remarkea
"That's one of the reasons Stanford did so poorly in
recruiting this year. Once a black brother talks to any
of the black players here now, he's going to find out a
Stanford promise ain't worth nothing. And that's just
what they found out." (Ralston admitted that
Stanford had been able to land less players in
recruiting this year—one that was expected to be their
best ever in view of the Rose Bowl victory—but he
cited the added burden of preparation for post-season
games and the coaching staff's lack of time for
recruiting as the major reason.)
Other criticisms of Stanford recruiting center
around the overseas campus program. It is a major
point in Stanford's favor for recruiting purposes, and
is invariably stressed by the visiting coaches. But once
a football player decides to take advantage of the
opportunity, he finds himself in the dog house with
