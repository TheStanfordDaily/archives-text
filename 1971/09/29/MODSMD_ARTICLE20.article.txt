# Injuries Hamper Stanford Workouts
## 
### 
Working in full pads yesterday, the Stanford football team
completed their second workout in preparation for Saturday's big
intersectional contest against the Duke Blue Devils. According to
Coach John Ralston, the Indians did general work yesterday.
Today's schedule calling for specific work on the kicking and goal
line games.
Both Stanford and Duke will enter this Saturday's game with 3-0
records. The Indians are currently ranked 9th and 10 th respectively in
this week's UPI and AP polls, with Duke 19 th in AP and unranked in
UPI. Stanford officials are hoping for a crowd of around 70,000 for
Saturday's game at Stanford Stadium.
Stanford, who has been heavily hit with injuries this year, has
received both good and bad news in that area this week. Sophomore
reserve defensive back Max Goldstein's knee injury from the Oregon
game has been diagnosed as torn knee ligaments and he will undergo
surgery today. Ralston thinks he will be lost for the rest of the season.
Starting fullback Hillary Shockley, who suffered a slight ankle
sprain in that game, will begin running today, but must be considered
doubtful for Saturday. Senior Jim Kehl is currently working out as
the first string fullback.
According to Ralston, split end Eric Cross, who missed the Oregon
game with a pulled hamstring muscle is "feeling pretty good, but he
needs a lot of conditioning work." Linebacker Pat Moore, who has
missed the last two games with an ankle sprain, was in full uniform
yesterday and he says he hopes to see action this Saturday.
Ralston says that most of the others who have been slowed by
injuries will see action against Duke. Finally, 2400 student tickets for
the USC game on October 16 in Los Angeles will go on sale this
morning at 8:30 a.m. at the Old Pavilion. A limit of one ticket per
card and two cards per person will be in effect. The tickets are priced
at $3.25 and married students can purchase a ticket for their spouse.
