Duke football, which once
enjoyed the same national
prominence as today's Nebraskas
and Notre Dames, is recovering
form an eight year draught.
The last time that the Blue
Devils played more than .600
football was 1962, when the
Dukes lost only to Southern Cal
and Georgia Tech, en route to an
8-2 season. But then, Blue Devil
fortunes took a sudden turn
downward, and last season's 6-5
slate was the first winning season
since 1965.
Coach Fired
Though Duke finished in a
second place tie in the Atlantic
Coast Conference last year, Coach
Tom Harp was released at the end
of his five year contract. Along
with Harp went quarterback Leo
Hart, receiver Wes Chesson, and
linebacker Dick Biddle—via the
graduation route.
Hart amassed the fourth
greatest passing record in NCAA
history; Chesson, along with Hart,
virtually rewrote the ACC record
books and Biddle was chosen to
the Associated Press third team
All-American.
But returning is sensational
fullback Steve Jones, and he,
along with new Coach Mike
McGee (a former Duke
All-American) , has been the story
of the 1971 Blue Devils.
Admittedly, the talent this
year is not as great as it was last
season, but the arrival of McGee
has more than made up for that
difference.
Florida Dumped
In Duke's season opener, the
Devils served notice that they are
not to be taken lightly, as they
defeated heavily favored Florida
at Tampa, 12-6.
The Blue Devil secondary, all
veterans, stopped John Reaves for

the second straight season, picking
off three passes. Jones rushed for
over 200 yards in 37 carries, and
placekicker David Wright provided
the scoring with four field goals,
two of which were over 40 yards.
Gamecocks Beaten
Next, playing before the largest
home opener crowd in 24 years,
the Devils upset 19th ranked
South Carolina, 28-12. In this
game, it was all defensive back
Ernie Jackson.
The fleet senior not only
returned a punt 74 yards for a
touchdown but also intercepted
two passes, one for a 30 yard
touchdown. The offense was again
all Jones: 125 yards rushing and
two touchdowns.
Cavaliers Fall
A letdown might have been
expected the next week, when
Duke traveled to Charlottesville,
Va., to take on Virginia's
Cavaliers. But again, led by Jones'
140 yards in just 23 carries, the
Devils shut out Virginia, 28-0.
That was Duke's first shutout
since a 6-0 whitewash of Army in
1964.
Of course, a team cannot
compile a 3-0 record against major
college competition with just one
player, and the Blue Devils do
have several other standouts.
Defensive back Jackson and
Rich Searl were both selected to
this year's pre-season
all-conference team. Jackson,
though just 5-10, uses blazing
speed to his advantage. He also
returns kick-offs and punts.
Searl A Standout
Searl, a tri-captain this year,
was all-ACC as a sophomore and a
junior. Last season, he intercepted
seven passes and also led the team
in tackles from his safety position.
In addition, Searl throws the ball
better than anyone on the team.
Up front, Duke may be hurting
a bit. Though the defense has
allowed just two touchdowns all
season, the ranks are thinning out.
All-Conference end Bruce Mills is
out for the season with a broken
ankle.
Melvin Parker, a defensive end,
is also a doubtful performer this
week, as he sustained an ankle
injury in the season opener. His
replacement, C.G. Newsome,

injured a leg against Virginia and
will not play.
Defensive Shifts
Jerry Griffin has been moved
from his linebacker spot to an end
position to help fill the void. The
linebacking crew now includes
Paul Johnstone, tri-captain Lanny
Murdock, and Bob Fitch. All are
seniors, though Fitch was an
offensive lineman prior to this
season.
Offensively, tackles Ed
Newman and Willie Clayton are
the stalwarts. Clayton, at 250
pounds is the biggest and the
fastest of the linemen. Newman
was picked to the first team on
Football News Sophomore
All-American Team last season.
These two are also called upon
when Duke uses a goal line
defense.
The quarterback is Dennis
Satyshur, who runs Duke's version
of the veer offense very well. He is
the key to McGee's philosophy of
no-error football.
Weak Passing
After two poor games passing,
Satyshur connected on five of five
passes against Virginia, including a
31 yard touchdown strike to
flanker Brad Evans. Most
importantly, Satyshur has not
thrown an interception in three
games.

When Satyshur does throw, he
has fine talent on the receiving
end. Evans starred in basketball
and baseball at Duke before giving
them up to devote full time to
football. He is ably backed up by
Tom Ussery.
Tight end Bill Baker was
second to Chesson on last year's
squad with 27 catches for 294
yards and one touchdown. Two
year letterman Dan Phelan plays
behind Baker.
In the Duke backfield, either
Bill Thompson or Bob Zwirko
plays alongside Jones. Thompson
is finally at 100 per cent after a
pre-season injury, as he showed by
galloping 31 yards for a score
against Virginia. Zwirko, a senior,
is also a capable runner, as he
proved by rushing for over 500
yards as a sophomore.
Unfortunately, he is injury prone.
Art Bosetti, who was to be the
starting tailback this season, came
up with a leg injury just before
the Florida game and has yet to
see action. His status is uncertain.
Duke To Run
Overall, Duke must be
considered a running football
team. The Devils have attempted
just 24 passes this year,
completing 11. But why throw
more? Jones and the defense do
the rest.

LOOK OUT FOR JONES—Star Duke fullback Steve Jones falls ove| a South Carolina defender for six
points in the Blue Devil's 2 8-12 victory over the Gamecocks. Jones has gained 480 yards in three games
this season and has averaged 4.8 yards per carry. He leads a Duke ground game that has averaged over 200
yards per game. Duke opponents have been able to throw Jones for a total of only 11 yards of losses. The
Thunder Chickens will not be able to key on Jones without ignoring two other fine runners who alternate
at the halfback position, Bill Thompson and Bob Zwirko.
