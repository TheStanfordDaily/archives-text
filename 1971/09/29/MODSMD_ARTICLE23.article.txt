# Indian Water Polo Team Begins Year Against De Anza College
## 
### DOUG WILSON 
The 1970-71 Stanford water
polo team—minus three starters
who have graduated—returns to
action for the '71-'72 season when
Coach Jim Gaughran's varsity
squad meets De Anza in Friday's
opening game of the Northern
California Water Polo
Tournament. The match,
scheduled for 1 p.m. at De Anza
College, will be followed at 4 p.m.
by a Stanford-Cal State Fullerton
game, also at De Anza. Saturday,
Stanford meets San Jose State in a
1 p.m. match at Foothill College,
and tests defending NCAA
champion UC Irvine at 4 p.m.
Gaughran counts Stanford as a
member of this season's "water
polo elite," largely on the basis of
a strong returning squad,
bolstered by a couple of top
freshman prospects. Gone from
last year's team which placed 6th
in the national collegiate
tournament, are Ray Collins and
Rick Eagleston. Leading the
returnees, however, are Rick
Massamino and Pete Gadd, seniors
with two years of experience
behind them and both prospects

for All-America honors this year.
Massamino, the team's top
offensive player, was a member of
the United States water polo team
which played in the Pan-American
Games in Cali, Colombia this
summer. Gadd, who has served as
team goalie for two seasons, is
considered one fo the finest
defensive players on the Pacific
Coast.
Seniors Mike Davis, Bill
Simpkins, Randy Wilkins and Rob
Wooley, all starters on last year's
squad, will add depth to the field,
as will junior players Dan
Powlison and Bob Warren.
Coach Gaughran also lists
freshmen Greg Loit.z as one of the
team's top players, and feels that
the Corona del Mar, Calif.,
standout will be a probable starter
this Friday. Other talented
freshman prospects include Stan
Johnson and Larry Mann, both
field players.
In addition, Gaughran
welcomes back Ken Hammer to
the squad. Hammer, returning to
Stanford after two years in the
military, is an outstanding sprinter
(21.2 for the 50; 46-plus for the

100) who will add needed speed
in the field.
Of his varsity squad, Gaughran
says,"I feel we have a very good
team, but the tournament should
give us a good indication on
whether or not we really are
strong. Although we lost last
week's scrimmage against Concord
(a top AAU team), in the quarters
where we played our top ten guys,
we outscored the opponent on a
2-1 basis."
Although Gaughran feels that
Stanford will battle perennial
southern powers USC and UCLA
for top water polo honors, an
immediate test to that prediction
should come Saturday, when
Stanford meets San Jose State and
UC Irvine, both of whom finished
higher than Stanford in the 1970
NCAA tournament.

Coach Gaughran also lists
freshmen Greg Loit.z as one of the
team's top players, and feels that
the Corona del Mar, Calif.,
standout will be a probable starter
this Friday. Other talented
freshman prospects include Stan
Johnson and Larry Mann, both
field players.
In addition, Gaughran
welcomes back Ken Hammer to
the squad. Hammer, returning to
Stanford after two years in the
military, is an outstanding sprinter
(21.2 for the 50; 46-plus for the

100) who will add needed speed
in the field.
Of his varsity squad, Gaughran
says,"I feel we have a very good
team, but the tournament should
give us a good indication on
whether or not we really are
strong. Although we lost last
week's scrimmage against Concord
(a top AAU team), in the quarters
where we played our top ten guys,
we outscored the opponent on a
2-1 basis."
Although Gaughran feels that
Stanford will battle perennial
southern powers USC and UCLA
for top water polo honors, an
immediate test to that prediction
should come Saturday, when
Stanford meets San Jose State and
UC Irvine, both of whom finished
higher than Stanford in the 1970
NCAA tournament.
The 1970-71 Stanford water
polo team—minus three starters
who have graduated—returns to
action for the '71-'72 season when
Coach Jim Gaughran's varsity
squad meets De Anza in Friday's
opening game of the Northern
California Water Polo
Tournament. The match,
scheduled for 1 p.m. at De Anza
College, will be followed at 4 p.m.
by a Stanford-Cal State Fullerton
game, also at De Anza. Saturday,
Stanford meets San Jose State in a
1 p.m. match at Foothill College,
and tests defending NCAA
champion UC Irvine at 4 p.m.
Gaughran counts Stanford as a
member of this season's "water
polo elite," largely on the basis of
a strong returning squad,
bolstered by a couple of top
freshman prospects. Gone from
last year's team which placed 6th
in the national collegiate
tournament, are Ray Collins and
Rick Eagleston. Leading the
returnees, however, are Rick
Massamino and Pete Gadd, seniors
with two years of experience
behind them and both prospects

for All-America honors this year.
Massamino, the team's top
offensive player, was a member of
the United States water polo team
which played in the Pan-American
Games in Cali, Colombia this
summer. Gadd, who has served as
team goalie for two seasons, is
considered one fo the finest
defensive players on the Pacific
Coast.
Seniors Mike Davis, Bill
Simpkins, Randy Wilkins and Rob
Wooley, all starters on last year's
squad, will add depth to the field,
as will junior players Dan
Powlison and Bob Warren.
