Prelate Ends Seclusion
ROME — Free at last, Josef Cardinal Mindszenty of
Hungary flew into Rome today.
For the last 15 years the Roman Catholic primate of
Hungary had been insolitary exile in the U.S. Diplomatic
mission at Budapest. He lied there in 195 6 after five days'
freedom during the Hungarian uprising. The Communists in
Hungary had sentenced him to life imprisonment on
charges of treason, tracing to his opposition to their
takeover.
The prelate, who is 79, arrived on a flight from Vienna.
This evidently signaled the end of a long dispute
between the Catholic Church and the Communist
government of Hungary.
Allies Attacked in Cambodia
SAIGON — South Vietnamese troops withstood six enemy
shellings Tuesday in the three-day-old battle to keep their
toehold in eastern Cambodia and their frontier defenses
inside Vietnam.
Elements of two North Vietnamese divisions are
exerting heavy pressure on the South Vietnamese deployed
in and around Krek in eastern Cambodia seven miles from
the Border and around Tay Ninh in South Vietnam
northwest of Saigon.
The North Vietnamese began their attacks Sunday over
a wide area ranging from 5 0 to 80 miles west and northwest
of Saigon.
'Paper Gold' Coining?
WASHINGTON — Major financial powers—Britain, Japan,
Italy and France—declared their support Tuesday for

development of a new international money system in which
paper gold" would dethrone the dollar as the principal
fiscal base for world trade.
British Chancellor of the Exchequer Anthony Barber
described in some detail one plan for drastic change, under
which gold would be displaced eventually as the sole
standard of value for national currencies of the
non-Communist world.
American authorities concur at least unofficially in the
desirability ot such a shift, to provide greater stability for a
system that has proved increasingly vulnerable to
disruption and speculative attack.
Rising concern was voiced, by large and small nations,
over the plight of under-developed countries which have
been damaged by the money crisis-and particularly by the
U.S. 10 percent tariff surcharge-though they had done
nothing to cause the disorders.
Soviets Launch Luna 19
MOSCOW — Rebounding from three consecutive space
failures, the Soviet Union launched another unmanned
moon probe Tuesday.
The Soviet news agency Tass said the main purpose of
the spacecraft Luna 19 "is to conduct scientific
investigation of the moon and near-lunar space from the
orbit of an artificial t;atelliie."
Some scientific observers in Moscow said this wording of
the spacecraft's mission indicated that it would not land on
the lunar surface. They said it may be on an aerial survey
mission to get a better idea of the lunar terrain before
attempting another soft landing.
The official news agency, Tass, said that Luna 19-like
its three predecessors-was sent into earth orbit on a special
moon launch satellite that then shot it out of earth orbit
and toward the moon. Western specialists say this
procedure indicates a heavy load of scientific equipment.

IN YOUR EAR—Rumor has it that Lassie will be appearing on campus with Rin Tin Tin next Saturday
night at the fire hydrant in White Plaza. This German shepherd looks like he's licking the problem of
getting a date early.
