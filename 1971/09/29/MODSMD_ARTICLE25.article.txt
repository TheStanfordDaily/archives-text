## Satisky Hearing Ends 
### BOB BACON 
Hearings in the case of Devera Satisky, a law school
secretary fired for participating in the April 9 th Stanford
Hospital sit-in, concluded yesterday before a three-man
grievance committee.
A verdict is due "as soon as possible," committee
member Byron Sher said.
Yesterday's debate centered on the integrity and
relevance of the evidence that University Personnel
Director Robert M. Nelson presented to justify Satisky's
dismissal, and on the lack of worker participation in the
formation of personnel policy.
'Unacceptable Behavior'
Satisky was dismissed by Nelson on June 28 on charges
of "unacceptable behavior" after an investigation by
Nelson of her part in the hospital dispute. The evidence
presented by Nelson consisted of four statements by
medical school faculty observers present at the hospital,
together with Satisky's "mug shot" from sheriff's files. She
denied that the evidence implicated her in any way, and
claimed it was contradictory.
Meanwhile, another of the five employees fired after the
sit-in, John Dolly, announced that he may withdraw his
grievance and seek other work. His hearing has been stalled
since midsummer when a dispute broke out over the
composition of the committee. He told the Daily that
unless a hearing was held "within a week or so," he would

be forced to abandon his attempt to regain his medical
center laboratory job.
Library worker John Keilch, a third employee seeking
reinstatement under similar circumstances, continues a
presentation to his grievance panel tomorrow at 1:30 in
Room 82 of the Graduate School of Business. Nelson and
John L. Wilson, Acting Dean of the Medical School last
spring, are scheduled to testify.
Satisky's case will now be decided by the 3-man
grievance committee, El wood Pierce, Assistant Controller
of the Medical School, Jim Breedlove, Curator of Latin
American materials in the libraries, and Byron Sher,
Professor of Law.
Satisky Makes Demands
In addition to reinstatement and back pay, Satisky has
asked assurance that workers would be involved in the
formulation of future grievance procedures and rules of
conduct for Stanford employees.
She is charged with nine misdemeanors arising out of the
hospital incident, and is free on bail pending trial.
During her hearing Satisky repeatedly claimed that the
"unacceptable behavior" charge was overly vague and gave
the administration leeway to dismiss anyone who
challenged its authority. At one point a member of the
audience interjected, "No one who works at Stanford
knows what unacceptable behavior is."
She also complained that Nelson had suppressed other
eyewitness statements regarding the April 9 confrontation
which contradicted those introduced as evidence.
