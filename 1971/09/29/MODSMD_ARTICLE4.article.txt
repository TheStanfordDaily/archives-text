# Franklin Hearing Begins With Uneventful Session
## 
### JON DEDMON 
The long awaited hearing of
suspended English Professor H. Bruce
Franklin on charges of misconduct as a
professor finally began Tuesday before
a full but relatively quiet audience in
Physics 101.
In a fairly uneventful s'/2 hour
session both Franklin and
administration attorneys made their
opening remarks, and late in the day
the prosecution was able to begin
presenting evidence.
Administration attorney William
Norris opened the hearing, the first of
its kind in Stanford's history, stating
that "the issue in this case is violence,
violence in the sense of injury to
people, damage to property, and
violence to the principle of academic
freedom."
Franklin, in lengthy opening
remarks, made good his earlier
statement that he would use the
hearing as a "class in imperialism." The
Marxist scholar, representing himself,
spoke for 2V2 hours with only a brief
recess and gave a lengthy Marxist
analysis of the University and the State.
Charges 'Phony'
Franklin said that the charges were
actually "phony" since they are based
on the assumption that the university is
dedicated to "the disinterested pursuit
of truth, when in reality it is an
imperialist institution dedicated to
expanding and maintaining an empire
in the Pacific basin."
Seated with Franklin at the defense
table as co-counsels were his wife Jane,
attorney Dennis Roberts, and graduate
economics student Yale Braunstein.
At the outset of Tuesday's hearing
there was a brief controversy over
whether the prosecution could
introduce evidence that showed
Franklin present at fights and property
damage after an evening speech on
February 10. Franklin has been charged
for inciting violence with that speech.
New Charges
Franklin argued that such evidence
was a new charge in disguise, accusing

him of aiding and abetting violence and
that this was not in the original
statement of charges. Advisory Board
Chairman Donald Kennedy agreed and
such evidence was ruled out over the
protest of Norris who said it was a part
of the original charges.
Outside Physics 101 some 10
minutes before the hearing began about
25 faculty members including Nobel
Laureate Linus Pauling, picketed the
building carrying signs reading "Faculty
Opposed to Political Firings" and "Try
Lodge For Disturbing the Peace."
Pauling commented, "I have been
opposed to the war since the beginning,
and I have made public statements to
that effect for the past 10 years. I have
been vigorously opposing it since 1964.
I believe Lodge is guilty of crimes
against humanity and I think he and
some of our other leaders might be
found if they were ever tried for these
crimes. . If Professor Franklin broke
the law he should be prosecuted in the
courts. But I don't think he broke any
Stanford laws."
Closed Circuits
Tuesday's proceedings were
broadcast over closed circuit television
to rooms 320 and 370, which were for
the most part quiet.
At their most popular moment,
about an hour after the hearing started,
a total of nearly 160 students and
faculty were in the rooms, some
watching the monitors intently, some
reading newspapers.
Both rooms were dead silent except
for occasional bursts of laughter.
There was some problem with

distorted images on the screen and a
static-ridden audio track shrank the
audience rapidly. By 3:30 p.m. the
audience was down to about 25 and
when word came that there were seats
available in Physics 101 it virtually
wiped out the television viewers.
Following opening arguments at
yesterday's proceedings the prosecution
presented photographs and tapes of the
Lodge incident in Dinkelspiel on
January 11. Then the prosecution
called Mrs. Frances Beckwith, a
Stanford alumnus from Menlo Park
who said she saw Franklin in "a dark
turtleneck sweater sitting on the edge
of his seat" at the scheduled Lodge
speech and when the noise would begin
to subside "he (Franklin) would try to
get everyone started again." She said he
aJso yelled "murderer" and "napalm."
Franklin later commented that he
had been dressed in an open-necked
shirt and white T-shirt and that
concerning the elderly white-haired
lady's testimony "to be charitable, she
is hopelessly confused about who was
sitting whereand who was who."
He then went into a long analysis of
the development of the medieval
academy to the present-day university
which Franklin said was an instrument
of monopoly capitalism and of the
military-industrial-educational complex.
Franklin also singled out Advisory
Board member Robert McAfee Brown
for his anti-communist writings and
SLAC director Wolfgang Panofsky for
his statements in the spring of 1969 on
the dichotomy of the mind and bodv.
The hearings will resume today at 1
p.m.
