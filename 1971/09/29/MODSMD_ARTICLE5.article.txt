# Drive Registers 1600 Voters On Campus
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Over 160 0 new voters will be added
to the registration lists of Santa Clara
and San Mateo Counties as the result of
a registration week drive sponsored by
the Student Committee for
Involvement in Politics (SCIP).
The number of new voters in Santa
Clara County will drastically increase
the rolls in the Stanford community,
which, according to the Assistant
Registrar of Voters of Santa Clara
County, had numbered only 2,145
before the drive.
About 69 percent of the 1632 new
registrants are Democrats, according to
Robert Grant, former ASSU
co-president who heads SClP,while 20
percent signed the GOP rolls, 10
percent indicated no party preference,
and one percent joined the Peace and
Freedom Party.
Independent Spirit
Grant figures about a quarter of
those registering Democratic are really
independent in spirit, but want to vote
in the primaries. A campaign by Pete
McCloskey workers to get students to
register Republican so they could "help
end the war" by voting against
President Nixon probably attracted
about a third of those who signed the
GOP list, he added.
Grant said that the registration drive
was originated by SCIP, which
contacted a number of persons and
organizations in the area to act as

registrars and arranged with the
University registrar for space in the
lobby of the Old Pavilion.
Among the voting registrars were
members of both the Santa Clara and
Southern San Mateo League of Women
Voters (LWV).
Registration 'Overwhelming'
A«'Coru«. >; to Sar. J'ctco I V.'V
member Cynthi? Roberts, tbc student
turnout was "overwhelming. I've been
busy ever since I got here, wh : ch has
been two and ? ii»lf hours i.ow,"
A-iothc Registrar. Joyce Berger,
claimed that slie had "turned away as
mr.jiy as I've registered." She said that
she had been telling students that they
should not register in the Stanford area
if "they have some other place that
they refer to as 'home,' instead of
here."
She also said that many students had
been "misled" by Assemblyman Willie
Brown (Dem.-S.F.), a recent campus
speaker, who claimed that they should
register here when "in their conscience
they thought of some place else as
home."
However, students are allowed to
register at their college campuses by
order of the California State Supreme
Court.
Along with the registration booths,
there were stations where students
could offer money or help to the
presidential campaigns of George
McGovern and John Lindsay, both
Democrats.

THE IMAGE—College football can do amazing things for a guy—like put him in
drug store windows in places like Salem, Oregon. For others, it is a different story.
Disallusionmenl with the game is growing as pressures on players multiply.
