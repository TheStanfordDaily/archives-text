## Self Defense Begins In The Gas Station 
### 
There is no reason for women
to pay rip-off prices for gasoline
because they are either unwilling
or unable to utilize self-service gas
stations. The advantages, in terms
of bread, for using these stations
is apparent to anyone: compare
the cost of rip-off Super Shell on
the campus (39.9 cents a gallon)
or even very cheap Beacon Ethyl
(35.9 cents a gallon) with the
same Beacon Ethyl at a self
service station (31.9 cents a
gallon).
Or, if you prefer Regular, 28.9
cents a gallon. In terms of a fill-up
for a small car, this amounts to a
savings of at least 50 cents; for big
American cars, $1.50.
Yet I very seldom see women
using the self service gas station
closest to Stanford (El Camino
Gas, next to the health spa on El
Camino opposite Escondido
Village).
Women, it is very easy to pour
gas into your car; you do not need
biceps or any other male
equipment to do it. You do not
need a man to do it for you. The
following steps should enable you
to tackle any self service gas
station without fear of making a
fool of yourself.

1. Locate the cap to your car's
fuel tank (if you don't know
where it is, you can't begin.)
2. Go to a self service gas
station.
3. Get out of your car
(remember, you are doing it
yourself; don't be afraid, no one
will be watching more than
casually. You can take on any
male chauvinists that offer to help
you. Tell them politely that you
can do it yourself. Then DO IT.
4. Open your gas tank (take
off the gas cap).
5. Go over to the fuel pump
that sells the type of gas you want
(regular, supreme or whatever).
There will be a hose and a nozzle
hanging on the side of the pump.
Lift the nozzle by the handle and
remove it from the pump. Don't
squeeze the pistol grip. There will
be a handle-sort-of-thing under
where the nozzle was. It will be
turned toward OFF. You push it
hard over to ON. The pump will
begin to make a noise. Don't
panic. Don't turn it OFF. The gas
will not start flowing out until
you squeeze the pistol grip on the
nozzle handle.
6. Slide the nozzle into the
opening of your gas tank (Now
you know why putting gas into a
car has been a male thing). Then
squeeze the pistol grip of the
nozzle. If you do not wish to
stand around while your tank fills
(and you won't want to after a
while) there is a tricky little
gadget on the handle of the nozzle
which you can flip down and
which holds the pistol grip
gripped. This will let the gas pour
into your tank until the gas starts
to come up around and into the
nozzle.
Then it automatically shuts
off. Really. The tank will be
nearly filled. You can either let it
go at that or you can feed in a
little by hand until you see the gas
in the throat of the tank, at which
point it is time to stop filling your
tank.

7. Remove the nozzle
completely (you have already
partially removed the nozzle to
check if the gas is in the throat of
the tank) and turn the pump
OFF. Replace the nozzle on the
pump. Put the gas cap back on
your car. You have now filled
your gas tank.
8. If an attendant does not
come around to collect for the
gas, assert yourself, walk over to
wherever he is and tell him the
amount of the purchase and pay
him. He'll just call the police if
you try to leave without paying,
no matter how tempted you may
be to do so after being ignored.
Besides, you have some other
things to do, now that you are
here.
9. While your tank is filling,
wash your windshields. There will
be a spray bottle and some paper
towels near the pump.
10. Then open your hood and
check your oil, the water in the
radiator (air cooled engines do not
have water to check—a VW is air
cooled), and the water in your
battery. All this takes a couple of
minutes and it will make you feel
very good. If you think you
cannot follow the following
directions for doing these
operations, next time you buy gas
at a regular filling station, get out
and watch when the attendant
checks your oil, water and water.
Otherwise:
—the oil dipstick is down
toward the bottom of the engine.
You twist it, pull it out, and clean
it on a paper towel. Then you
push it back firmly into the hole
you pulled it out of (there's the
male thing again) and again
remove it. The oil will (hopefully)
be at the top notch on the stick.
If it is lower than that, you are
down some oil If it is at the
bottom notch or less, you need to
add oil. You should know what
kind of oil you put into your car.
If you do not know, make a point
of finding out; even if you have a
very cooperative car, at some
point in its life it will begin
digesting oil and will want some
more put in. Do not put in
detergent oil if you have been
putting in non-detergent;
non-detergent oil can be added to
detergent oil with no hassle.

—the radiator is at the front of
the engine, behind the grill. At the
top is a screw top. It will be
warm, so use a paper towel or
cloth when you open it. Unscrew
it very slowly if your car has been
running hot, otherwise you will
have a lot of steam on your face
or a lot of hot water all over the
place. It is a little like a pressure
cooker; you want to let the
pressure down slowly. On late
model cars, the radiator may be
sealed. Do not open unless cooled
for several hours.
If the water is not up to the
mouth of the radiator, put water
into it. Ask where the water hose
is, if it is not apparent. Never put
water into an overheated engine
without having the engine

running; you will split the block,
in which case a new engine is in
order.
—the battery is a box with
some caps on the top and some
wires leading to and from it. It
needs distilled water in it to work.
Generally there is distilled water
in it. But if you take off the little
caps and see there is no water, add
some—distilled only.
11. You can also check the
pressure on the tires and add air if
you need to. (The owner's manual
will tell you what is the correct
pressure for your tires—it's hard
to remember, as well as
unnecessary.)
The benefits of doing all these
little things cannot be
overestimated. First, you have

marlaine lookheed

saved yourself anywhere from
$0.50 to $1.50. Second, you have
done something that up to this
time you have had to depend
upon men to do for you. You
have learned that, despite what
may have been laid on you by any
number of men, you are quite
capable of doing this simple
operation.
Third, you are beginning to
have doubts about some of the
other exclusively male domains—if
gassing up your car is such a snap,
maybe changing a light bulb isn't
much trouble either. Maybe going
to law school is no more of a
challenge than getting a teaching
credential. Maybe you could pick
up karate or learn how to shoot a
gun.

American cars, $1.50.
Yet I very seldom see women
using the self service gas station
closest to Stanford (El Camino
Gas, next to the health spa on El
Camino opposite Escondido
Village).
Women, it is very easy to pour
gas into your car; you do not need
biceps or any other male
equipment to do it. You do not
need a man to do it for you. The
following steps should enable you
to tackle any self service gas
station without fear of making a
fool of yourself.

1. Locate the cap to your car's
fuel tank (if you don't know
where it is, you can't begin.)
2. Go to a self service gas
station.
3. Get out of your car
(remember, you are doing it
yourself; don't be afraid, no one
will be watching more than
casually. You can take on any
male chauvinists that offer to help
you. Tell them politely that you
can do it yourself. Then DO IT.
4. Open your gas tank (take
off the gas cap).
5. Go over to the fuel pump
that sells the type of gas you want
(regular, supreme or whatever).
There will be a hose and a nozzle
hanging on the side of the pump.
Lift the nozzle by the handle and
remove it from the pump. Don't
squeeze the pistol grip. There will
be a handle-sort-of-thing under
where the nozzle was. It will be
turned toward OFF. You push it
hard over to ON. The pump will
begin to make a noise. Don't
panic. Don't turn it OFF. The gas
will not start flowing out until
you squeeze the pistol grip on the
nozzle handle.
6. Slide the nozzle into the
opening of your gas tank (Now
you know why putting gas into a
car has been a male thing). Then
squeeze the pistol grip of the
nozzle. If you do not wish to
stand around while your tank fills
(and you won't want to after a
while) there is a tricky little
gadget on the handle of the nozzle
which you can flip down and
which holds the pistol grip
gripped. This will let the gas pour
into your tank until the gas starts
to come up around and into the
nozzle.
Then it automatically shuts
off. Really. The tank will be
nearly filled. You can either let it
go at that or you can feed in a
little by hand until you see the gas
in the throat of the tank, at which
point it is time to stop filling your
tank.

7. Remove the nozzle
completely (you have already
partially removed the nozzle to
check if the gas is in the throat of
the tank) and turn the pump
OFF. Replace the nozzle on the
pump. Put the gas cap back on
your car. You have now filled
your gas tank.
8. If an attendant does not
come around to collect for the
gas, assert yourself, walk over to
wherever he is and tell him the
amount of the purchase and pay
him. He'll just call the police if
you try to leave without paying,
no matter how tempted you may
be to do so after being ignored.
Besides, you have some other
things to do, now that you are
here.
9. While your tank is filling,
wash your windshields. There will
be a spray bottle and some paper
towels near the pump.
10. Then open your hood and
check your oil, the water in the
radiator (air cooled engines do not
have water to check—a VW is air
cooled), and the water in your
battery. All this takes a couple of
minutes and it will make you feel
very good. If you think you
cannot follow the following
directions for doing these
operations, next time you buy gas
at a regular filling station, get out
and watch when the attendant
checks your oil, water and water.
Otherwise:
—the oil dipstick is down
toward the bottom of the engine.
You twist it, pull it out, and clean
it on a paper towel. Then you
push it back firmly into the hole
you pulled it out of (there's the
male thing again) and again
remove it. The oil will (hopefully)
be at the top notch on the stick.
If it is lower than that, you are
down some oil If it is at the
bottom notch or less, you need to
add oil. You should know what
kind of oil you put into your car.
If you do not know, make a point
of finding out; even if you have a
very cooperative car, at some
point in its life it will begin
digesting oil and will want some
more put in. Do not put in
detergent oil if you have been
putting in non-detergent;
non-detergent oil can be added to
detergent oil with no hassle.

—the radiator is at the front of
the engine, behind the grill. At the
top is a screw top. It will be
warm, so use a paper towel or
cloth when you open it. Unscrew
it very slowly if your car has been
running hot, otherwise you will
have a lot of steam on your face
or a lot of hot water all over the
place. It is a little like a pressure
cooker; you want to let the
pressure down slowly. On late
model cars, the radiator may be
sealed. Do not open unless cooled
for several hours.
If the water is not up to the
mouth of the radiator, put water
into it. Ask where the water hose
is, if it is not apparent. Never put
water into an overheated engine
without having the engine

running; you will split the block,
in which case a new engine is in
order.
—the battery is a box with
some caps on the top and some
wires leading to and from it. It
needs distilled water in it to work.
Generally there is distilled water
in it. But if you take off the little
caps and see there is no water, add
some—distilled only.
11. You can also check the
pressure on the tires and add air if
you need to. (The owner's manual
will tell you what is the correct
pressure for your tires—it's hard
to remember, as well as
unnecessary.)
The benefits of doing all these
little things cannot be
overestimated. First, you have

marlaine lookheed

saved yourself anywhere from
$0.50 to $1.50. Second, you have
done something that up to this
time you have had to depend
upon men to do for you. You
have learned that, despite what
may have been laid on you by any
number of men, you are quite
capable of doing this simple
operation.
Third, you are beginning to
have doubts about some of the
other exclusively male domains—if
gassing up your car is such a snap,
maybe changing a light bulb isn't
much trouble either. Maybe going
to law school is no more of a
challenge than getting a teaching
credential. Maybe you could pick
up karate or learn how to shoot a
gun.
There is no reason for women
to pay rip-off prices for gasoline
because they are either unwilling
or unable to utilize self-service gas
stations. The advantages, in terms
of bread, for using these stations
is apparent to anyone: compare
the cost of rip-off Super Shell on
the campus (39.9 cents a gallon)
or even very cheap Beacon Ethyl
(35.9 cents a gallon) with the
same Beacon Ethyl at a self
service station (31.9 cents a
gallon).
Or, if you prefer Regular, 28.9
cents a gallon. In terms of a fill-up
for a small car, this amounts to a
savings of at least 50 cents; for big
American cars, $1.50.

2. Go to a self service gas
station.
3. Get out of your car
(remember, you are doing it
yourself; don't be afraid, no one
will be watching more than
casually. You can take on any
male chauvinists that offer to help
you. Tell them politely that you
can do it yourself. Then DO IT.
4. Open your gas tank (take
off the gas cap).
5. Go over to the fuel pump
that sells the type of gas you want
(regular, supreme or whatever).
There will be a hose and a nozzle
hanging on the side of the pump.
Lift the nozzle by the handle and
remove it from the pump. Don't
squeeze the pistol grip. There will
be a handle-sort-of-thing under
where the nozzle was. It will be
turned toward OFF. You push it
hard over to ON. The pump will
begin to make a noise. Don't
panic. Don't turn it OFF. The gas
will not start flowing out until
you squeeze the pistol grip on the
nozzle handle.
6. Slide the nozzle into the
opening of your gas tank (Now
you know why putting gas into a
car has been a male thing). Then
squeeze the pistol grip of the
nozzle. If you do not wish to
stand around while your tank fills
(and you won't want to after a
while) there is a tricky little
gadget on the handle of the nozzle
which you can flip down and
which holds the pistol grip
gripped. This will let the gas pour
into your tank until the gas starts
to come up around and into the
nozzle.
Then it automatically shuts
off. Really. The tank will be
nearly filled. You can either let it
go at that or you can feed in a
little by hand until you see the gas
in the throat of the tank, at which
point it is time to stop filling your
tank.

7. Remove the nozzle
completely (you have already
partially removed the nozzle to
check if the gas is in the throat of
the tank) and turn the pump
OFF. Replace the nozzle on the
pump. Put the gas cap back on
your car. You have now filled
your gas tank.
8. If an attendant does not
come around to collect for the
gas, assert yourself, walk over to
wherever he is and tell him the
amount of the purchase and pay
him. He'll just call the police if
you try to leave without paying,
no matter how tempted you may
be to do so after being ignored.
Besides, you have some other
things to do, now that you are
here.
9. While your tank is filling,
wash your windshields. There will
be a spray bottle and some paper
towels near the pump.
10. Then open your hood and
check your oil, the water in the
radiator (air cooled engines do not
have water to check—a VW is air
cooled), and the water in your
battery. All this takes a couple of
minutes and it will make you feel
very good. If you think you
cannot follow the following
directions for doing these
operations, next time you buy gas
at a regular filling station, get out
and watch when the attendant
checks your oil, water and water.
Otherwise:
—the oil dipstick is down
toward the bottom of the engine.
You twist it, pull it out, and clean
it on a paper towel. Then you
push it back firmly into the hole
you pulled it out of (there's the
male thing again) and again
remove it. The oil will (hopefully)
be at the top notch on the stick.
If it is lower than that, you are
down some oil If it is at the
bottom notch or less, you need to
add oil. You should know what
kind of oil you put into your car.
If you do not know, make a point
of finding out; even if you have a
very cooperative car, at some
point in its life it will begin
digesting oil and will want some
more put in. Do not put in
detergent oil if you have been
putting in non-detergent;
non-detergent oil can be added to
detergent oil with no hassle.

—the radiator is at the front of
the engine, behind the grill. At the
top is a screw top. It will be
warm, so use a paper towel or
cloth when you open it. Unscrew
it very slowly if your car has been
running hot, otherwise you will
have a lot of steam on your face
or a lot of hot water all over the
place. It is a little like a pressure
cooker; you want to let the
pressure down slowly. On late
model cars, the radiator may be
sealed. Do not open unless cooled
for several hours.
If the water is not up to the
mouth of the radiator, put water
into it. Ask where the water hose
is, if it is not apparent. Never put
water into an overheated engine
without having the engine

running; you will split the block,
in which case a new engine is in
order.
—the battery is a box with
some caps on the top and some
wires leading to and from it. It
needs distilled water in it to work.
Generally there is distilled water
in it. But if you take off the little
caps and see there is no water, add
some—distilled only.
11. You can also check the
pressure on the tires and add air if
you need to. (The owner's manual
will tell you what is the correct
pressure for your tires—it's hard
to remember, as well as
unnecessary.)
The benefits of doing all these
little things cannot be
overestimated. First, you have

marlaine lookheed

saved yourself anywhere from
$0.50 to $1.50. Second, you have
done something that up to this
time you have had to depend
upon men to do for you. You
have learned that, despite what
may have been laid on you by any
number of men, you are quite
capable of doing this simple
operation.
Third, you are beginning to
have doubts about some of the
other exclusively male domains—if
gassing up your car is such a snap,
maybe changing a light bulb isn't
much trouble either. Maybe going
to law school is no more of a
challenge than getting a teaching
credential. Maybe you could pick
up karate or learn how to shoot a
gun.
There is no reason for women
to pay rip-off prices for gasoline
because they are either unwilling
or unable to utilize self-service gas
stations. The advantages, in terms
of bread, for using these stations
is apparent to anyone: compare
the cost of rip-off Super Shell on
the campus (39.9 cents a gallon)
or even very cheap Beacon Ethyl
(35.9 cents a gallon) with the
same Beacon Ethyl at a self
service station (31.9 cents a
gallon).
Or, if you prefer Regular, 28.9
cents a gallon. In terms of a fill-up
for a small car, this amounts to a
savings of at least 50 cents; for big
American cars, $1.50.
Yet I very seldom see women
using the self service gas station
closest to Stanford (El Camino
Gas, next to the health spa on El
Camino opposite Escondido
Village).
Women, it is very easy to pour
gas into your car; you do not need
biceps or any other male
equipment to do it. You do not

remove it from the pump. Don't
squeeze the pistol grip. There will
be a handle-sort-of-thing under
where the nozzle was. It will be
turned toward OFF. You push it
hard over to ON. The pump will
begin to make a noise. Don't
panic. Don't turn it OFF. The gas
will not start flowing out until
you squeeze the pistol grip on the
nozzle handle.
6. Slide the nozzle into the
opening of your gas tank (Now
you know why putting gas into a
car has been a male thing). Then
squeeze the pistol grip of the
nozzle. If you do not wish to
stand around while your tank fills
(and you won't want to after a
while) there is a tricky little
gadget on the handle of the nozzle
which you can flip down and
which holds the pistol grip
gripped. This will let the gas pour
into your tank until the gas starts
to come up around and into the
nozzle.
Then it automatically shuts
off. Really. The tank will be
nearly filled. You can either let it
go at that or you can feed in a
little by hand until you see the gas
in the throat of the tank, at which
point it is time to stop filling your
tank.

7. Remove the nozzle
completely (you have already
partially removed the nozzle to
check if the gas is in the throat of
the tank) and turn the pump
OFF. Replace the nozzle on the
pump. Put the gas cap back on
your car. You have now filled
your gas tank.
8. If an attendant does not
come around to collect for the
gas, assert yourself, walk over to
wherever he is and tell him the
amount of the purchase and pay
him. He'll just call the police if
you try to leave without paying,
no matter how tempted you may
be to do so after being ignored.
Besides, you have some other
things to do, now that you are
here.
9. While your tank is filling,
wash your windshields. There will
be a spray bottle and some paper
towels near the pump.
10. Then open your hood and
check your oil, the water in the
radiator (air cooled engines do not
have water to check—a VW is air
cooled), and the water in your
battery. All this takes a couple of
minutes and it will make you feel
very good. If you think you
cannot follow the following
directions for doing these
operations, next time you buy gas
at a regular filling station, get out
and watch when the attendant
checks your oil, water and water.
Otherwise:
—the oil dipstick is down
toward the bottom of the engine.
You twist it, pull it out, and clean
it on a paper towel. Then you
push it back firmly into the hole
you pulled it out of (there's the
male thing again) and again
remove it. The oil will (hopefully)
be at the top notch on the stick.
If it is lower than that, you are
down some oil If it is at the
bottom notch or less, you need to
add oil. You should know what
kind of oil you put into your car.
If you do not know, make a point
of finding out; even if you have a
very cooperative car, at some
point in its life it will begin
digesting oil and will want some
more put in. Do not put in
detergent oil if you have been
putting in non-detergent;
non-detergent oil can be added to
detergent oil with no hassle.

—the radiator is at the front of
the engine, behind the grill. At the
top is a screw top. It will be
warm, so use a paper towel or
cloth when you open it. Unscrew
it very slowly if your car has been
running hot, otherwise you will
have a lot of steam on your face
or a lot of hot water all over the
place. It is a little like a pressure
cooker; you want to let the
pressure down slowly. On late
model cars, the radiator may be
sealed. Do not open unless cooled
for several hours.
If the water is not up to the
mouth of the radiator, put water
into it. Ask where the water hose
is, if it is not apparent. Never put
water into an overheated engine
without having the engine

running; you will split the block,
in which case a new engine is in
order.
—the battery is a box with
some caps on the top and some
wires leading to and from it. It
needs distilled water in it to work.
Generally there is distilled water
in it. But if you take off the little
caps and see there is no water, add
some—distilled only.
11. You can also check the
pressure on the tires and add air if
you need to. (The owner's manual
will tell you what is the correct
pressure for your tires—it's hard
to remember, as well as
unnecessary.)
The benefits of doing all these
little things cannot be
overestimated. First, you have

marlaine lookheed

saved yourself anywhere from
$0.50 to $1.50. Second, you have
done something that up to this
time you have had to depend
upon men to do for you. You
have learned that, despite what
may have been laid on you by any
number of men, you are quite
capable of doing this simple
operation.
Third, you are beginning to
have doubts about some of the
other exclusively male domains—if
gassing up your car is such a snap,
maybe changing a light bulb isn't
much trouble either. Maybe going
to law school is no more of a
challenge than getting a teaching
credential. Maybe you could pick
up karate or learn how to shoot a
gun.
