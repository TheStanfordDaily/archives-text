Editor, The Daily:
For those to whom the Word
has not yet gone forth, let it be
made known that the first day of
classes this autumn falls on Yom
Kippur, the Day of Atonement,
the holiest day of the year for the
Jewish community. To observe
the holiday means not to attend
classes. Although we might wish
that the Lord would schedule his
holy days so as not to conflict
with our profane calendar, his
schedule came first. The
adjustment must be made on our
part.
I interpret the failure to make
any adjustment to be a
demonstration of the University's
insensitivity to the convictions of
the Jewish community, and 1
register my protest. If classes
began on Thursday, in the words
of Tevye, the Dairyman, "would
it spoil some vast, Eternal plan?"
