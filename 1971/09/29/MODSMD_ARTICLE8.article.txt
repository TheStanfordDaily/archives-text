# Student Positions Still Open
## 
### 
Editors Note: Council Notes, a
column written by the ASSU
Council of Presidents, is presented
as a service by the Daily.
During our campaign in the
spring of 1971, we pledged that,
as a Council, we would make an
effort to open up the decision
making process of Stanford
University. Since that time we
have been working to make that
promise a reality.
When we took office we were
faced with the job of filling
student positions on the various
Academic Council, University,
and Presidential Committees.
Under the previous Council of
Presidents this work was delayed
until the Fall. Several vacancies
had remained throughout the year
1971. We decided to fill most of
the openings during the Spring.
The Committee on
Nominations worked many long
hours to find qualified students
for committee openings. We feel
that they were successful in their
work. The following positions
remain open: two positions on the
Committee on Student Services,
two on Public Events, one
graduate on University Library
Council. All students are
encouraged to apply for positions
which interest them. Applications
are available in the ASSU office.
Bccause we filled most
positions last spring, we
disenfranchised the incoming
students. During the summer we
sought to develop a means for
correcting this situation. The
result of our work is the new
Intern Program. The Program is
open to all Freshmen, Transfers
and new Graduate Students. On
each University, Presidential, and
Academic Council Committee,
one student will be placed as an
intern.
That student will serve as a

member without vote. He or she
will participate in meetings, help
the regular student members with
their work, and be a strong
candidate for subcommittee
appointment. We hope that new
students will take advantage of
this opportunity to become
involved in University governance.
Applications were given to all
freshmen during pre-reg. All other
new students can pick them up in
the ASSU office.

COUNCIL NOTES

We have also created new
ASSU Presidential Committees.
These committees will be
composed of only students. They
will be primarily of an
investigatory nature. We plan to
use their work as a source of
information for our Council, the
Student Senate, Student
Committee members, and the
student body at large. There are
four such committees: Education;
Room, Board and Tuition Rates;
Ecology; and War Complicity.
Their charges are listed below. All
interested students are more than
welcome.
Education Committee—Course
evaluation at Stanford is light
years behind the course review
and evaluation programs at other
institutions. The first objective of
this committee will be to prepare
a comprehensive evaluation of the
major courses offered at Stanford
(beginning with the large
introductory courses). The
committee will be considering
standards by which courses should
be judged, questions that should
be asked of them, and will then
seek to develop methods of
applying, collecting and
cataloguing these criteria. The

committee will also hopefully
consider the larger question of the
effectiveness of any
student-oriented course review.
And, finally, whether the
evaluation program that does
emerge should attempt to
integrate with the present
program under the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies.
Tuition, Room, and Board
Rates Committee—Will investigate
why these rates are rising and

where costs might be
cut—especially in the dormitories.
This committee will seek to enlist
the aid of the office of Business
and Finance, the Residence
Manager's office, and the
dormitory staffs in a
comprehensive study of the
problem. The committee will
hopefully include a few energetic
Business students.
Ecology Committee—Will
disseminate information about
Stanford's new recycling program
and seek to make it work in each
of the dorms. The Ecology
committee will probably be
responsible for the recycling
centers at the Boathouse and in
the Wilbur Parking Lot, and for
the life of the program itself
War Complicity—Will study
Stanford's complicity in the war
effort in Southeast Asia and the
general escalation of militarism in
America. This committee will seek
to develop an objective catalogue
of facts and data on how Stanford
is using its investment potential,
its research capabilities, and its
land in the cause of the War.

The Committee on War

Complicity will recommend ways
in which the University might
reduce its involvement with war
related activities and devote its
academic resources, research
facilities, land and endowment
more strongly in the direction of
Peace.
Another committee of a
different nature also came into
being this summer. It will be
known as the Ad Hoc Advisory
Committee on Investment
Responsibility. For years students
have been complaining about
Stanford's investment policy. In
response the Board of Trustees
adopted a new policy of
investment responsibility last
April. In this statement they
pledged to "give independent
consideration and weight to the
possible social, economic, and
political implications of the
University's Investment policy"
when certain conditions are met.
This September the Trustees
finally adopted a mechanism for
implementing that policy. Under
Vice President Augsburger
(Business and Finance) the Ad
Hoc Committee will channel views
and practices concerning
investment responsibility which
may become policy. The
Committee will consist of three
students, three alumni
representatives, and three faculty.
We consider the creation of this
committee to be an important
first step towards a more humane
investment policy for Stanford
University.
In the past Committee work
has been dismissed as petty and
uninteresting. This year we are
instituting a new program of
coordination and communication.
We hope to have students working
together throughout the
University structure to affect
needed change.

Ecology Committee—Will
disseminate information about
Stanford's new recycling program
and seek to make it work in each
of the dorms. The Ecology
committee will probably be
responsible for the recycling
centers at the Boathouse and in
the Wilbur Parking Lot, and for
the life of the program itself
War Complicity—Will study
Stanford's complicity in the war
effort in Southeast Asia and the
general escalation of militarism in
America. This committee will seek
to develop an objective catalogue
of facts and data on how Stanford
is using its investment potential,
its research capabilities, and its
land in the cause of the War.

The Committee on War

Complicity will recommend ways
in which the University might
reduce its involvement with war
related activities and devote its
academic resources, research
facilities, land and endowment
more strongly in the direction of
Peace.
Another committee of a
different nature also came into
being this summer. It will be
known as the Ad Hoc Advisory
Committee on Investment
Responsibility. For years students
have been complaining about
Stanford's investment policy. In
response the Board of Trustees
adopted a new policy of
investment responsibility last
April. In this statement they
pledged to "give independent
consideration and weight to the
possible social, economic, and
political implications of the
University's Investment policy"
when certain conditions are met.
This September the Trustees
finally adopted a mechanism for
implementing that policy. Under
Vice President Augsburger
(Business and Finance) the Ad
Hoc Committee will channel views
and practices concerning
investment responsibility which
may become policy. The
Committee will consist of three
students, three alumni
representatives, and three faculty.
We consider the creation of this
committee to be an important
first step towards a more humane
investment policy for Stanford
University.
In the past Committee work
has been dismissed as petty and
uninteresting. This year we are
instituting a new program of
coordination and communication.
We hope to have students working
together throughout the
University structure to affect
needed change.

During our campaign in the
spring of 1971, we pledged that,
as a Council, we would make an
effort to open up the decision
making process of Stanford
University. Since that time we
have been working to make that
promise a reality.
When we took office we were
faced with the job of filling
student positions on the various
Academic Council, University,
and Presidential Committees.
Under the previous Council of
Presidents this work was delayed
until the Fall. Several vacancies
had remained throughout the year
1971. We decided to fill most of
the openings during the Spring.
The Committee on
Nominations worked many long
hours to find qualified students
for committee openings. We feel
that they were successful in their
work. The following positions
remain open: two positions on the
Committee on Student Services,
two on Public Events, one
graduate on University Library
Council. All students are
encouraged to apply for positions
which interest them. Applications
are available in the ASSU office.
Bccause we filled most
positions last spring, we
disenfranchised the incoming
students. During the summer we
sought to develop a means for
correcting this situation. The
result of our work is the new
Intern Program. The Program is
open to all Freshmen, Transfers
and new Graduate Students. On
each University, Presidential, and
Academic Council Committee,
one student will be placed as an
intern.
That student will serve as a

member without vote. He or she
will participate in meetings, help
the regular student members with
their work, and be a strong
candidate for subcommittee
appointment. We hope that new
students will take advantage of
this opportunity to become
involved in University governance.
Applications were given to all
freshmen during pre-reg. All other
new students can pick them up in
the ASSU office.

COUNCIL NOTES

We have also created new
ASSU Presidential Committees.
These committees will be
composed of only students. They
will be primarily of an
investigatory nature. We plan to
use their work as a source of
information for our Council, the
Student Senate, Student
Committee members, and the
student body at large. There are
four such committees: Education;
Room, Board and Tuition Rates;
Ecology; and War Complicity.
Their charges are listed below. All
interested students are more than
welcome.
Education Committee—Course
evaluation at Stanford is light
years behind the course review
and evaluation programs at other
institutions. The first objective of
this committee will be to prepare
a comprehensive evaluation of the
major courses offered at Stanford
(beginning with the large
introductory courses). The
committee will be considering
standards by which courses should
be judged, questions that should
be asked of them, and will then
seek to develop methods of
applying, collecting and
cataloguing these criteria. The

committee will also hopefully
consider the larger question of the
effectiveness of any
student-oriented course review.
And, finally, whether the
evaluation program that does
emerge should attempt to
integrate with the present
program under the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies.
Tuition, Room, and Board
Rates Committee—Will investigate
why these rates are rising and

where costs might be
cut—especially in the dormitories.
This committee will seek to enlist
the aid of the office of Business
and Finance, the Residence
Manager's office, and the
dormitory staffs in a
comprehensive study of the
problem. The committee will
hopefully include a few energetic
Business students.
Ecology Committee—Will
disseminate information about
Stanford's new recycling program
and seek to make it work in each
of the dorms. The Ecology

member without vote. He or she
will participate in meetings, help
the regular student members with
their work, and be a strong
candidate for subcommittee
appointment. We hope that new
students will take advantage of
this opportunity to become
involved in University governance.
Applications were given to all
freshmen during pre-reg. All other
new students can pick them up in
the ASSU office.

COUNCIL NOTES

We have also created new
ASSU Presidential Committees.
These committees will be
composed of only students. They
will be primarily of an
investigatory nature. We plan to
use their work as a source of
information for our Council, the
Student Senate, Student
Committee members, and the
student body at large. There are
four such committees: Education;
Room, Board and Tuition Rates;
Ecology; and War Complicity.
Their charges are listed below. All
interested students are more than
welcome.
Education Committee—Course
evaluation at Stanford is light
years behind the course review
and evaluation programs at other
institutions. The first objective of
this committee will be to prepare
a comprehensive evaluation of the
major courses offered at Stanford
(beginning with the large
introductory courses). The
committee will be considering
standards by which courses should
be judged, questions that should
be asked of them, and will then
seek to develop methods of
applying, collecting and
cataloguing these criteria. The

committee will also hopefully
consider the larger question of the
effectiveness of any
student-oriented course review.
And, finally, whether the
evaluation program that does
emerge should attempt to
integrate with the present
program under the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies.
Tuition, Room, and Board
Rates Committee—Will investigate
why these rates are rising and

where costs might be
cut—especially in the dormitories.
This committee will seek to enlist
the aid of the office of Business
and Finance, the Residence
Manager's office, and the
dormitory staffs in a
comprehensive study of the
problem. The committee will
hopefully include a few energetic
Business students.
Ecology Committee—Will
disseminate information about
Stanford's new recycling program
and seek to make it work in each
of the dorms. The Ecology
committee will probably be
responsible for the recycling
centers at the Boathouse and in
the Wilbur Parking Lot, and for
the life of the program itself
War Complicity—Will study
Stanford's complicity in the war
effort in Southeast Asia and the
general escalation of militarism in
America. This committee will seek
to develop an objective catalogue
of facts and data on how Stanford
is using its investment potential,
its research capabilities, and its
land in the cause of the War.

The Committee on War

Complicity will recommend ways
in which the University might
reduce its involvement with war
related activities and devote its
academic resources, research
facilities, land and endowment
more strongly in the direction of
Peace.
Another committee of a
different nature also came into
being this summer. It will be
known as the Ad Hoc Advisory
Committee on Investment
Responsibility. For years students
have been complaining about
Stanford's investment policy. In
response the Board of Trustees
adopted a new policy of
investment responsibility last
April. In this statement they
pledged to "give independent
consideration and weight to the
possible social, economic, and
political implications of the
University's Investment policy"
when certain conditions are met.
This September the Trustees
finally adopted a mechanism for
implementing that policy. Under
Vice President Augsburger
(Business and Finance) the Ad
Hoc Committee will channel views
and practices concerning
investment responsibility which
may become policy. The
Committee will consist of three
students, three alumni
representatives, and three faculty.
We consider the creation of this
committee to be an important
first step towards a more humane
investment policy for Stanford
University.
In the past Committee work
has been dismissed as petty and
uninteresting. This year we are
instituting a new program of
coordination and communication.
We hope to have students working
together throughout the
University structure to affect
needed change.
Editors Note: Council Notes, a
column written by the ASSU
Council of Presidents, is presented
as a service by the Daily.
During our campaign in the
spring of 1971, we pledged that,
as a Council, we would make an
effort to open up the decision
making process of Stanford
University. Since that time we
have been working to make that
promise a reality.
When we took office we were
faced with the job of filling
student positions on the various
Academic Council, University,
and Presidential Committees.
Under the previous Council of
Presidents this work was delayed
until the Fall. Several vacancies
had remained throughout the year
1971. We decided to fill most of
the openings during the Spring.
The Committee on
Nominations worked many long
hours to find qualified students
for committee openings. We feel
that they were successful in their
work. The following positions
remain open: two positions on the
Committee on Student Services,
two on Public Events, one
graduate on University Library
Council. All students are
encouraged to apply for positions
which interest them. Applications
are available in the ASSU office.
Bccause we filled most
positions last spring, we
disenfranchised the incoming
students. During the summer we
sought to develop a means for
correcting this situation. The
result of our work is the new
Intern Program. The Program is
open to all Freshmen, Transfers
and new Graduate Students. On
each University, Presidential, and
Academic Council Committee,
one student will be placed as an
intern.
That student will serve as a

member without vote. He or she
will participate in meetings, help
the regular student members with
their work, and be a strong
candidate for subcommittee
appointment. We hope that new
students will take advantage of
this opportunity to become
involved in University governance.

new students can pick them up in
