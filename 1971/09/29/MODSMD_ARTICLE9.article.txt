## Wage Price Freeze 
### 
Editor's Note: The following column is reprinted
from the September 4 issue of the Neu> York
Times.
On Aug. 15, 1971, fascism came to America.
And everyone cheered, hailing the fact that a
"strong President" was once again at the helm.
The word fascism is scarcely an exaggeration to
describe the New Economic Policy. The trend had
been there for years, in the encroachment of Big
Government over all aspects of the economy and
society, in growing taxes, subsidies and controls,
and in the shift of economic decision-making from
the free market to the Federal Government. The
most recent ominous development was the bailout
of Lockheed, which established the principle that
no major corporation, no matter how inefficient,
can be allowed to go under.
But the wage-price freeze, imposed in sudden
hysteria on Aug. 15, spells the end of the free
price system, and therefore of the entire system of
free enterprise and free markets that have been the
heart of the American economy.
The main horror of the wage-price freeze is that
this is totalitarianism, and nobody seems to care.
For it is an open secret in Washington that wages
and prices cannot bt simply and starkly frozen
forever, and that ninety days will scarcely be
enough to solve any economic problem. It is an
open secret that the Administration is planning to
use the ninety days to prepare a permanent
bureaucracy to administer permanent wage and
price controls.
The first challenge to hurl at our Caesar in the
White House is not economic but moral: quo
warranto? By what right do you use coercion to
tell buyers and sellers what prices they may or
may not agree upon, or employers and workers
what wages they may pay?
The supposed across-the-board freeze is, in any
case, a fraud and a hoax. If it is really universal,
why is the President deliberately raising the prices
of imported goods, both by the sudden 10 percent
surcharge and by devaluing the dollar? If it is
really universal, why is the scheduled Oregon
cigarette tax increase going into effect? Or is the

-murry rolhbard

President saying that a tax is not a price? Why are
interest rates not frozen?
The worst part of our leap into fascism is that
no one and no group, left, right or center,
Democrat or Republican, businessman, journalist
or economist, has attacked the principle of the
move itself. The unions and the Democrats are
only concerned that the policy wasn't total
enough, that it didn't cover interest and profits.
The ranks of business seem to have completely
forgotten all their old rhetoric about free
enterprise and the free price system; indeed, The
Washington Post reported that the mood of
business and the banks is "almost euphoric." Small
wonder, when stocks are rising , and General
Motors and Ford gain a large rise in the prices of
competing foreign cars and a reduction in their
own excise taxes. The conservatives, too, seem to
have forgotten their free enterprise rhetoric and
are willing to join in the patriotic hoopla. The New
Left and the practitioners of the New Politics seem
to have forgotten all of their rhetoric about the
evils of central control of the economy and
society. Academic economists, in perhaps the
greatest betrayal of all, seem to have forgotten one
of their finest economic truths: that price controls
only cause shortages and misallocations and do not
work in checking inflation.
All the old convictions, all the old devotion to
free enterprise, to economic truth, to the
Constitution, have been blithely tossed aside by all
sectors of the population. How much does it take?
Is the American public prepared to swallow any
despotism, as long as it is presented forcefully and
dramatically? Is there no spunk, no love of
freedom left in America? In the last analysis, only
the American public can break the new chains that
our Caesar has forged. Only the American public
can render the wage-price controls unenforceable,
by "voting with their feet" in their everyday lives.
But to do this, they must be awakened from their
torpor by some voice of dissent, someone
somewhere who is willing to raise the cry: "This
shall not pass." (Murray N. Rothbard is professor
of economics at the Polytechnic Institute of
Brooklyn.)

Is the American public prepared to swallow any
despotism, as long as it is presented forcefully and
dramatically? Is there no spunk, no love of
freedom left in America? In the last analysis, only
the American public can break the new chains that
our Caesar has forged. Only the American public
can render the wage-price controls unenforceable,
by "voting with their feet" in their everyday lives.
But to do this, they must be awakened from their
torpor by some voice of dissent, someone
somewhere who is willing to raise the cry: "This
shall not pass." (Murray N. Rothbard is professor
of economics at the Polytechnic Institute of
Brooklyn.)

On Aug. 15, 1971, fascism came to America.
And everyone cheered, hailing the fact that a
"strong President" was once again at the helm.
The word fascism is scarcely an exaggeration to
describe the New Economic Policy. The trend had
been there for years, in the encroachment of Big
Government over all aspects of the economy and
society, in growing taxes, subsidies and controls,
and in the shift of economic decision-making from
the free market to the Federal Government. The
most recent ominous development was the bailout
of Lockheed, which established the principle that
no major corporation, no matter how inefficient,
can be allowed to go under.
But the wage-price freeze, imposed in sudden
hysteria on Aug. 15, spells the end of the free
price system, and therefore of the entire system of
free enterprise and free markets that have been the
heart of the American economy.
The main horror of the wage-price freeze is that
this is totalitarianism, and nobody seems to care.
For it is an open secret in Washington that wages
and prices cannot bt simply and starkly frozen
forever, and that ninety days will scarcely be
enough to solve any economic problem. It is an
open secret that the Administration is planning to
use the ninety days to prepare a permanent
bureaucracy to administer permanent wage and
price controls.
The first challenge to hurl at our Caesar in the
White House is not economic but moral: quo
warranto? By what right do you use coercion to
tell buyers and sellers what prices they may or
may not agree upon, or employers and workers
what wages they may pay?
The supposed across-the-board freeze is, in any
case, a fraud and a hoax. If it is really universal,
why is the President deliberately raising the prices
of imported goods, both by the sudden 10 percent
surcharge and by devaluing the dollar? If it is
really universal, why is the scheduled Oregon
cigarette tax increase going into effect? Or is the

-murry rolhbard

President saying that a tax is not a price? Why are
interest rates not frozen?
The worst part of our leap into fascism is that
no one and no group, left, right or center,
Democrat or Republican, businessman, journalist
or economist, has attacked the principle of the
move itself. The unions and the Democrats are
only concerned that the policy wasn't total
enough, that it didn't cover interest and profits.
The ranks of business seem to have completely
forgotten all their old rhetoric about free
enterprise and the free price system; indeed, The
Washington Post reported that the mood of
business and the banks is "almost euphoric." Small
wonder, when stocks are rising , and General
Motors and Ford gain a large rise in the prices of
competing foreign cars and a reduction in their
own excise taxes. The conservatives, too, seem to
have forgotten their free enterprise rhetoric and
are willing to join in the patriotic hoopla. The New
Left and the practitioners of the New Politics seem
to have forgotten all of their rhetoric about the
evils of central control of the economy and
society. Academic economists, in perhaps the
greatest betrayal of all, seem to have forgotten one
of their finest economic truths: that price controls
only cause shortages and misallocations and do not
work in checking inflation.
All the old convictions, all the old devotion to
free enterprise, to economic truth, to the
Constitution, have been blithely tossed aside by all
sectors of the population. How much does it take?
