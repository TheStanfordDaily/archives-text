# New Ombudsman
## Amsterdam Hopes For Support 
### BOB MICHELET 
For a person anxious to help people
with their problems, Stanford's new
ombudsman finds her biggest task is
getting them to know the office even
exists.
Mrs. Lois Amsterdam, who
succeeded Dr. Herant Katchadourian
Sept. 1, has spent most of her time
talking to groups and individuals
around campus about her job.
The office was proposed by the
Committee of Fifteen in May, 1969,
and Katchadourian became the first
ombudsman in February, 1970. In his
final report he noted that one problem
was that few people knew what the
office of ombudsman was or did.
In the words of the Committee's
recommendation, "the ombudsman
exists to receive, examine and channel
the complaints and grievances of
members of the Stanford community,
and to secure expeditious and impartial
redress."

Mrs. Amsterdam adds that the work
of the ombudsman is "not a duplicate"
of other channels or procedures. It is
not, she claims, even a procedure itself,
but rather a recommendation to the
involved parties.
The ombudsman's office is used,
Mrs. Amsterdam notes, when there is
no existing channel to deal with a
complaint, that channel does not
respond satisfactorily or simply when
the person does not know where to
turn with his problem.
She adds that her office is open to
anyone with any kind of question or
complaint, asserting "if it affects one
individual, it's important."
Both Mrs. Amsterdam and the
committee's proposal stress that the
ombudsman's office is not a final
solution, but rather a means to one.
Persuasion & Criticism Important
The Committee says the
ombudsman's "remedial weapons are
persuasion and private or public

criticism," and Mrs. Amsterdam hopes
to stress the "educative function" of
the office, claiming that many a
problem can be resolved just by
publicizing it.
Another facet of the job is that of
mediation. While recognizing that
"compromise is often difficult," Mrs.
Amsterdam adds that it is important
for a third person (the ombudsman) to
look at the situation with an objective
view.
The business of compromise and of
dealing directly with people is not new
to her. A graduate of the New York
University Law School, Mrs.
Amsterdam has long been active in
social aspects of law.
She is a former instructor of the
N.Y.U. Graduate School of Social Work
and associate director of the N.Y.U.
Law School Project on Social Welfare
Law. Upon arriving in California, she
became director of the Law Reform

Unit of the Legal Aid Society of San
Mateo County.
Mrs. Amsterdam, wife of law
professor Anthony Amsterdam, claims
that the lawyer-client type of
relationship is valuable in her work and
that "the tools of my profession" are
also helpful.
Office Independent
She strongly asserts the
independence of her office. "No one
directs me," she says, adding that her
office is an independent one, and that
it cannot function unless it remains so.
She says her job is only to see that
there is an impartial and fair hearing of
the matter and that she has no reason
to take sides on any issue.
Mrs. Amsterdam's own policy would
seem in line with the Committee's
original hopes when they said "the
ombudsman's power rests on his
reputation for fairness, objectivity,

and for the well-being of the
university."
"There's a little in all of us that
wants to serve," Mrs. Amsterdam says,
"and I enjoy that." Of her new post,
she comments, "I think it's an
important one."
Though conceding there's "a bit of

Don Quixote in me," she is realistic
about the outlook for the office,
stressing the key matter right now is to
get everyone to realize the existence
and function of the job.
Mrs. Amsterdam, viewing the
university as "a small society within a
larger one," added "if I can do
anything to help the university
function in a fair and just manner, then
I'll be helping the large society as well."

larger one," added "if I can do
anything to help the university
function in a fair and just manner, then
I'll be helping the large society as well."
For a person anxious to help people
with their problems, Stanford's new
ombudsman finds her biggest task is
getting them to know the office even
exists.
Mrs. Lois Amsterdam, who
succeeded Dr. Herant Katchadourian
Sept. 1, has spent most of her time
talking to groups and individuals
around campus about her job.
The office was proposed by the
Committee of Fifteen in May, 1969,
and Katchadourian became the first
ombudsman in February, 1970. In his
final report he noted that one problem
was that few people knew what the
office of ombudsman was or did.
In the words of the Committee's
recommendation, "the ombudsman
exists to receive, examine and channel
the complaints and grievances of
members of the Stanford community,
and to secure expeditious and impartial
redress."

Mrs. Amsterdam adds that the work
of the ombudsman is "not a duplicate"
of other channels or procedures. It is
not, she claims, even a procedure itself,
but rather a recommendation to the
involved parties.
The ombudsman's office is used,
Mrs. Amsterdam notes, when there is
no existing channel to deal with a
complaint, that channel does not
respond satisfactorily or simply when
the person does not know where to
turn with his problem.
She adds that her office is open to
anyone with any kind of question or
complaint, asserting "if it affects one
individual, it's important."
Both Mrs. Amsterdam and the
committee's proposal stress that the
ombudsman's office is not a final
solution, but rather a means to one.
Persuasion & Criticism Important
The Committee says the
ombudsman's "remedial weapons are
persuasion and private or public

criticism," and Mrs. Amsterdam hopes
to stress the "educative function" of
the office, claiming that many a
problem can be resolved just by
publicizing it.
Another facet of the job is that of
mediation. While recognizing that
"compromise is often difficult," Mrs.
Amsterdam adds that it is important
for a third person (the ombudsman) to
look at the situation with an objective
view.
The business of compromise and of
dealing directly with people is not new
to her. A graduate of the New York
University Law School, Mrs.
Amsterdam has long been active in
social aspects of law.
She is a former instructor of the
N.Y.U. Graduate School of Social Work
and associate director of the N.Y.U.
Law School Project on Social Welfare
Law. Upon arriving in California, she
became director of the Law Reform

Unit of the Legal Aid Society of San
Mateo County.
Mrs. Amsterdam, wife of law
professor Anthony Amsterdam, claims
that the lawyer-client type of
relationship is valuable in her work and
that "the tools of my profession" are
also helpful.
Office Independent
She strongly asserts the
independence of her office. "No one
directs me," she says, adding that her
office is an independent one, and that
it cannot function unless it remains so.
She says her job is only to see that
there is an impartial and fair hearing of
the matter and that she has no reason
to take sides on any issue.
Mrs. Amsterdam's own policy would
seem in line with the Committee's
original hopes when they said "the
ombudsman's power rests on his
reputation for fairness, objectivity,

Don Quixote in me," she is realistic
about the outlook for the office,
