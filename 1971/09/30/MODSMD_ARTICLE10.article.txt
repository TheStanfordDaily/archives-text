## The 						War Winds On 
### 
katherine barkley

During the last year, the United States' military
and political position in Vietnam has been rapidly
deteriorating. Thieu's election travesty (upcoming
October 3rd), and the resultant growth of strong
anti war, anti-Thitu, anti-American forces in South
Vietnam; the incompetence of the ARVN troops,
and the 'freaking out' of American G.l.'s; the
Provisional Revolutionary Government's seven
point peace proposal, as well as strong domestic
pressure for acceptance of the PRG proposal—all
these factors increase the precariousness and
obvious illegitimacy of Nixon's position.
A new chapter in the tragedy of Vietnam is
being written. But, it's unclear whether or not it
will be the last. Many speculate that the year's
failures will force Nixon to withdraw, laying aside
long-held hopes for a Korea-type settlement.
This column, written by members of the
Indochina Study Group, will provide a weekly
analysis of the events in Indochina—the prospects
for peace, and the possibility of escalation. We
welcome comment, controversy, and contribution.
America's political position in Vietnam has
reached an unprecedented low. Thieu's election
fixing and repression of political opposition have
revealed in stark relief the illegitimacy of his
"democratic" rule. Since the beginning of the year
he has tried to manipulate a riskless 2-man race
which would appear democratic, but would be
rigged to assure his victory. He first forced
restrictive electoral laws through the legislature
which eliminated Vice-president Ky as a possible
opponent. At the same time he sent out a 10-page
secret directive to his administrative chiefs with a
detailed program for mobilizing the army and the
"political warfare specialists" to systematically
slander and harass opposition candidates, and to
intimidate the voters.
Discovering this document, peace candidate
General Minh (the only opposition candidate who
had been able to qualify), pulled out of the race
charging that the elections were rigged and that his
name was being used so it would look like the
South Vietnamese actively supported continuation
of the war. (Thieu's platform is the Four No's: No
neutrality, no coalition government, no concession
of any South Vietnamese territory to the
Communists, no Communist activity anywhere in
South Vietnam).

Responding to American pressure, Thieu got
Ky reinstated on the ballot in a last-minute
attempt to give the elections an air of legitimacy.
But Ky, like Minh refused to play the game.
Meanwhile, behind the Saigon scenes, American
diplomats were frantically working to salvage the
sham. Reputable rumors disclosed that Bunker, in
a last desperate effort offered a "campaign
assistance" of $3 million to General Minh and $5
million to Vice-president Ky.
Thieu, running on a "Democracy Slate," is
determined to win his one-man race. To legitimize
the election he has publically stated that he will
step down if he gets less than 50% of the vote.
Meanwhile, he implies that anyone boycotting the
election will be suspected to be a communist.
Whatever happens on October 3rd there is no
doubt that Thieu's administrative and military
apparatus will provide the necessary percentage.
The White House, though thoroughly
embarrassed by Thieu's political chicanery, is still
his staunch supporter, there is no other figure in
South Vietnam with the power and the will to
Vietnamize Nixon's inhumane programs of
pacification and forced urbanization.
Covering for Thieu, Washington has lauded him
for introducing an "element of popular choice" to
the elections. And South Vietnamese generals have
been given the word that a coup d'etat would
mean the end of U.S. aid.
Nixon himself recently lamented that the
democratic process in Vietnam "will not be met
perhaps for several generations." But the
widespread feeling in Vietnam is that it is the
Americans—not the Vietnamese—that are
responsible for the election farce.
Opposition to Thieu's illegitimate regime has
been growing rapidly over the last three months.
The anti-American, anti-Thieu, anti-war forces are
the strongest, most widespread in the history of
the war. Even Diem had more support.
Attend the Vietnam election vigil.

During the last year, the United States' military
and political position in Vietnam has been rapidly
deteriorating. Thieu's election travesty (upcoming
October 3rd), and the resultant growth of strong
anti war, anti-Thitu, anti-American forces in South
Vietnam; the incompetence of the ARVN troops,
and the 'freaking out' of American G.l.'s; the
Provisional Revolutionary Government's seven
point peace proposal, as well as strong domestic
pressure for acceptance of the PRG proposal—all
these factors increase the precariousness and
obvious illegitimacy of Nixon's position.
A new chapter in the tragedy of Vietnam is
being written. But, it's unclear whether or not it
will be the last. Many speculate that the year's
failures will force Nixon to withdraw, laying aside
long-held hopes for a Korea-type settlement.
This column, written by members of the
Indochina Study Group, will provide a weekly
analysis of the events in Indochina—the prospects
for peace, and the possibility of escalation. We
welcome comment, controversy, and contribution.
America's political position in Vietnam has
reached an unprecedented low. Thieu's election
fixing and repression of political opposition have
revealed in stark relief the illegitimacy of his
"democratic" rule. Since the beginning of the year
he has tried to manipulate a riskless 2-man race
which would appear democratic, but would be
rigged to assure his victory. He first forced
restrictive electoral laws through the legislature
which eliminated Vice-president Ky as a possible
opponent. At the same time he sent out a 10-page
secret directive to his administrative chiefs with a
detailed program for mobilizing the army and the
"political warfare specialists" to systematically
slander and harass opposition candidates, and to
intimidate the voters.
Discovering this document, peace candidate
General Minh (the only opposition candidate who
had been able to qualify), pulled out of the race
charging that the elections were rigged and that his
name was being used so it would look like the
South Vietnamese actively supported continuation
of the war. (Thieu's platform is the Four No's: No
neutrality, no coalition government, no concession
of any South Vietnamese territory to the
Communists, no Communist activity anywhere in
South Vietnam).

Responding to American pressure, Thieu got
Ky reinstated on the ballot in a last-minute
attempt to give the elections an air of legitimacy.
But Ky, like Minh refused to play the game.
Meanwhile, behind the Saigon scenes, American
diplomats were frantically working to salvage the
sham. Reputable rumors disclosed that Bunker, in
a last desperate effort offered a "campaign
assistance" of $3 million to General Minh and $5
million to Vice-president Ky.
