# KZSU Expanding Into Community Now Broadcasts Franklin Trial Live

(Ed's Note: This is the first in a
series of three articles on KZSU.
Analysis of programming and
public affairs will appear next
week.)
Good things are happening this
fall at KZSU, the community
radio station at 90.1 FM. Armed
with $11,000 which the student
body voted it last spring, the
station is expanding both its
physical plant and its
programming.

The first organizational
meeting is tonight at 7:30 p.m. in
the KZSU studios in the left rear
basement of the auditorium.
Positions are open in all areas,
from d.j.'s to secretaries and
salesmen.
In addition to the student
body financial support, KZSU is
getting aid from the Department
of Humanities and Sciences to
bring studio A downstairs with
the rest of the station.

Chief Engineer Mark Lawrence
is overseeing a remodeling
program which has moved in the
walls and will eventually see a
bathroom in the studios, much to
the relief of d.j.'s who used to
have to put on a long record and
dash up two flights of stairs.
The station is being run by a
core of people who kept KZSU on
the air this summer. According to
station manager Will Pape, the
staff matured as broadcasters this
summer and it will show up in the
station's sound this fall.
New programming will include
the broadcasts of Palo Alto City
Council meetings every two weeks
and four newscasts each evening,
with one at 5 p.m. aimed at
students and one at 6:00 p.m.
tailored for staff. The other news
shows are scheduled for 8:00 and
10:00 p.m.
KZSU will broadcast the
Franklin hearing live until its
conclusion. The station made the
decision yesterday after receiving
over 200 calls from listeners in a
two hour period. Pape says, "A
lot of stations are broadcasting
rock; no one is carrying Bruce
Franklin."
The public affairs hour will
return at 7:00 p.m. with President
Lyman every other Tuesday and
other university officials on
alternate weeks. A magazine

format on Thursday nights,
directed by Public Affairs head
Bob Fuss, will feature five or six
short features.
An hour each week will be
devoted to black programming,
possibly Johnny Scott's "Let's
Fight About It" show. There may
also be a show patterned on
"Meet the Press" with the ASSU
Council of Presidents facing
newsmen.
KZSU sports plans are not
definite yet, but they will be
broadcasting the home varsity
football games and possibly the
frosh games.
The station will start its AM
broadcasts Monday to the Wilbur,
Branner, Stern and Toyon
complexes at 88 0 AM and will
split their broadcasts several hours
daily to allow on the air training
of d.i.'s on the AM programs.
With the new FM transmitter site,
KZSU can be heard from
Sunnyvale to San Carlos and
further, depending on the
receiver.
Pape sees a trend, not yet
finalized, to fewer d.j.'s and
longer shifts. This will allow
longer training time for new
people and better air sound. Pape
thinks there is no station doing
the things KZSU is doing. He
adds, "We have a unique sound."
