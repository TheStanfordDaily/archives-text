# Telescope Near Completion
## 
### 
One of the world's most
advanced radio telescopes,
technically known as a
" high-resolution radio
interferometer," is undergoing
final tests in a placid meadow
behind the campus.
It is expected to be capable of
precise observations of all the
quasars, nebulae, galaxies and
other celestial microwave radio
sources catalogued so far. The
new array of five 60-foot dish
antennas was described by four of
its designer-builders in the July
issue of Sky and Telescope, radio
astronomy journal.
The authors are Prof. Ronald
N. Bracewell, director of the
Stanford Radio Astronomy

Institute; senior research
associates Dr. Roger S. Colving
and Dr. A. Richard Thompson;
and research associate Kent M.
Price.
Most of the development and
construction was done by
Stanford scientists, engineers and
students. The project was funded
by the Air Force Office of
Scientific Research and the
National Science Foundation.
The five antennas can be
pointed simultaneously at any
radio source in the sky. Their
fan-shaped observation beam is
just one-third of one minute of
arc in width, giving it resolving
power up to 10 times better than
single dish antennas.
