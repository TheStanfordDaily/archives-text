### 
Competition for the 1972-73
Fulbright-Hays Grants for graduate
study abroad and teaching
assistantships in English will close
October 4, according to A. Lee
Zeigler, campus Fulbright
Adviser.
Candidates must be U.S.
citizens, have a bachelor's degree
before the beginning date of the
grant, and must in most cases be
proficient in the language of the
host country.
Selection is based on the
academic and/or professional
record of the applicant, the
feasibility of his proposed study
plan, his language preparation,
and personal qualifications.
Full grants are available to 29
countries and travel grants are
available to 12 countries.
Teaching assistantships in English
are available in France, Italy, and
Japan. In last year's competition,
9 out of the 18 Stanford students
who completed applications were
given awards.
Application forms and
information may be obtained
from the Campus Fulbright
Adviser, Mr. Zeigler, in the
Bechtel International Center. The
deadline for completed
applications is October 4, 1971.
Candidates will then be
interviewed by faculty teams.
This fall, for the first time in
twenty years, there will be no
Woodrow Wilson Fellowship
competition.

In announcing the temporary
suspension of the program, H.
Ronald Rouse, National Director
of the Woodrow Wilson National
Fellowship Foundation, said
"Funds currently available are
being used to support over 200
Fellows during the 1971-72
academic year. Prospects for new
funds are uncertain."
The Wilson Fellowships are
only one of a number of programs

throughout the country which
have suffered from the recent
decline in fellowship support. The
U.S. government has reduced or
eliminated several programs.
At the same time many state
governments have similarly
reduced the amount of support
they provide, and a number of
programs financed by
corporations have been
discontinued.


IT KEEPS PILING UP—Here's a riddle for you: what's something you overlook every day? No, it's not
your nose. Give up? The answer is: Garbage. Some may dispute that the Coors can pictured is garbage, but
the fact remains that every day, thoughtless people are destroying the natural beauty that is Stanford's.
Like the people at Ecology House, you should do your share to help stop this problem. Try giving up
Coors for a starter.
