# McClure-Zeta Psi, Not Dells
## 
### 
Tim McClure, identified in yesterday's Daily as a former
member of Delta Tau Delta, and quoted as saying the fraternity
placed an emphasis on "stupidity and ignorance," is a former
member of Zeta Psi, not the Delts. (Fifteen football players
currently reside in the Delt house.)
Commenting on his reported remarks, McClure yesterday said,
"I think including my statements concerning the Delt house was
an unfortunate decision. It failed to reinforce my criticisms of the
football program. Publicly condemning others' life style has never
been my intent. This isolated detraction hopefully will not dilute
my basic criticisms of football."
