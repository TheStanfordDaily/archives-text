# Metal, Glass Pickups
## Ecology House To Begin Recycling 
### 
"Recycling alone can't solve
problems caused by
over-consumption," according to
Terry Fotre, a member of the
Ecology House. However, as a
start the house, located in the old
DKE fraternity building in the
Cowell cluster, plans to initiate a
campus-wide recycling program

sometime during October.
Once the new program is
established, pickups of metal and
glass will be made on Friday,
Saturday, and Sunday in both the
Wilbur and Roble parking lots
between noon and 4:00 pm. The
program will be unable to accept
any newsprint for recycling,

however, because existing pulp
facilities are glutted.
The Ecology House, together
with Alpha Phi Omega, a service
organization, and the Stanford
Conservation Group, also plans to
operate a recycling project again
this year at all home football
games.
Last year, about 35 ,000 cans
were collected during each game,
according to Jim Isaak of Alpha
Phi Omega, who will coordinate
the project. He expects about
175,000 cans from this year's
program.
About 100 volunteers will
move through the aisles during
each game, asking fans to crush
their cans and place them in large
plastic bags. Jim Cawse and
Stacey Fitzsimmons, co-presidents
of the Conservation Group, noted
that Athletic Director Chuck
Taylor enthusiastically supports
the project, since his staff will not
have to pick up as many cans after
each game.
Organized last spring, the
Ecology group moved into the
DKE house last summer, but has
only recently coalesced into an
active, environment-oriented
group.

"I get a feeling of organic
growth," commented Richard
Jerome, a member of the
fifty-person co-op.
Hampered by a lack of both
people and money, the house is
soliciting funds from the ASSU
and the physical plant for its
recycling project, the first campus
effort to establish a permanent
project.
House members have received
support and encouragement from
the administration, the physical
plant, the business office, the
housing office, and the University
food service, according to Fotre.
Ecology House offers courses,
seminars, and directed reading in
environmental living, which may
soon receive academic credit. It
composts all organic garbage
generated by the house, using it as
fertilizer on gardens it shares with
Columbae House.
The members of the house
maintain that the best indication
of the success or failure of the
group will be its membership and
its impact on the Stanford
environment. All regard the
house, its courses, and its
recycling program as a learning
experience.

house, its courses, and its
recycling program as a learning
experience.
"Recycling alone can't solve
problems caused by
over-consumption," according to
Terry Fotre, a member of the
Ecology House. However, as a
start the house, located in the old
DKE fraternity building in the
Cowell cluster, plans to initiate a
campus-wide recycling program

sometime during October.
Once the new program is
established, pickups of metal and
glass will be made on Friday,
Saturday, and Sunday in both the
Wilbur and Roble parking lots
between noon and 4:00 pm. The
program will be unable to accept
any newsprint for recycling,

however, because existing pulp
facilities are glutted.
The Ecology House, together
with Alpha Phi Omega, a service
organization, and the Stanford
Conservation Group, also plans to
operate a recycling project again
this year at all home football
games.
Last year, about 35 ,000 cans
were collected during each game,
according to Jim Isaak of Alpha
Phi Omega, who will coordinate
the project. He expects about
175,000 cans from this year's
program.
About 100 volunteers will
move through the aisles during
each game, asking fans to crush
their cans and place them in large
plastic bags. Jim Cawse and
Stacey Fitzsimmons, co-presidents
of the Conservation Group, noted
that Athletic Director Chuck
Taylor enthusiastically supports
the project, since his staff will not
have to pick up as many cans after
each game.
Organized last spring, the
Ecology group moved into the
DKE house last summer, but has
only recently coalesced into an
active, environment-oriented
group.

"I get a feeling of organic
growth," commented Richard
Jerome, a member of the
fifty-person co-op.
Hampered by a lack of both
people and money, the house is
soliciting funds from the ASSU
and the physical plant for its
recycling project, the first campus
effort to establish a permanent
project.
House members have received
support and encouragement from
the administration, the physical
plant, the business office, the
housing office, and the University
food service, according to Fotre.
Ecology House offers courses,
seminars, and directed reading in
environmental living, which may
soon receive academic credit. It
composts all organic garbage
generated by the house, using it as
fertilizer on gardens it shares with
Columbae House.
The members of the house
maintain that the best indication
of the success or failure of the
group will be its membership and
its impact on the Stanford
environment. All regard the
house, its courses, and its
recycling program as a learning
experience.
