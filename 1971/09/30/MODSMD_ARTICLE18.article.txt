A new office designed to
provide basic information about
Stanford and to provide analysis
for institutional planning was
established in July, with Associate
Provost Raymond F. Bacchetti as
its director.
The Academic Planning Office
(APO), as the new office is called,
will engage in institution
problem-solving, especially the
problems of how the University
can extend its resources,financial
and otherwise, to cover the
activities it needs and wants to
undertake.
"Our principal objective is to
provide the kind of analytical
support which informs judgment
and provides both historical and
contemporary perspective."
The APO will become a central
resource for answering general
questions about the people,
programs, and plans of the
University and about the ways in
which these do or might interact.

The office is now involved in
studies of grading in
undergraduate courses, the effects
of the new grading system
extradepartmental programs, and
the office is compiling a Faculty
Data File, which will make basic
descriptive information about the
Faculty as a group available from
a central source.
Other studies now in progress
include a review of early
retirement plans and a systems
study of the factors which
influence the age and rank
composition of the faculty.
Besides Bacchetti, the APO
staff includes:
L. Wayne Price, assistant
director and assistant to the
Provost, who will devote
approximately half his time to
APO activities, principally
self-contained studies and those
derivative from larger systems
efforts.
