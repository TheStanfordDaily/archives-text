Continued Belfast Bombings
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — A bomb ripped through a crowded Belfast bar
Wednesday night, killing two persons and wounding 14, as terrorists spurned
appeals for peace.
Another bomb wrecked a trucking warehouse in the Roman Catholic Lower
Falls Road area of the strife-torn capital.
Defying appeals by three prime ministers for an end to the violence, terrorists
launched other attacks, including sniper fire on troops patrolling the Catholic
Ardoyne area.
New Induction Quote
WASHINGTON — Resuming the draft after a three-month lapse, the Pentagon will
announce today a new induction quota that will bring 1971 call-ups to the lowest
annual total in nearly a decade.
A Pentagon spokesman, Jerry W. Friedheim, said the new call will cover
inductions for October, November and December, and that this year's draft total
will end up below 100,000 men.
Canton Broadcast Canceled
HONG KONG — Canton television failed to deliver its promised "important new
program," Wednesday, disappointing Western observers who hoped to get a clue
to recent unusual events in Red China.
Peking's announcement a week ago that the National Day parade this Friday
had been canceled stirred speculation that something was happening inside China.
The cancellation led to speculation that Mao was ill or dying, but Chinese
officials insisted he was in excellent health.
Two other recent events also puzzled Western specialists. One was the
grounding of all planes in China for several days this month.
The other was an order canceling all army leaves and furloughs, intercepted in
Tokyo by Japanese government monitors of interior Chinese radio broadcasts.
Senate Refuses To Cut Fl4 Funds
WASHINGTON — The Senate gave lopsided votes of confidence Wednesday to
two of the Pentagon's most-criticized weapons projects by refusing to cut funds

for the Navy's Fl 4 fighter and the Safeguard Missile Defense System.
The votes on the Fl4 and Safeguard, latest in a string of victories for the Nixon
administration on major weapons proposals, appeared to insure approval without
major reduction of the $21-billion military procurement bill. Final action is likely
next week.
Counteroffensive Launched
TAY NINH, Vietnam — Reinforced government troops launched a
counteroffensivc- Wednesday against parts of two North Vietnamese divisions
along the South Vietnam-Cambodia border, and the United States hurled its air
might into the drive.
The U.S. Command moved about 1,500 American troops and a squadron of
armored vehicles from rear bases to the front.
They reinforced two U.S. artillery bases on the Cambodian border and filled a
void at the Tay Ninh West base left vacant by South Vietnamese troops pushing
out of the counteroffensive.
