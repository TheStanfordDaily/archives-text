# Large Violence Research Grant Awarded To Stanford Med Center
## 
### 
The Medical School has received half
a million dollars to support a
University-wide program of research
and education on the problem of
human aggression and violence.
Dr. David A. Hamburg, chairman of
the Department of Psychiatry, will
direct the new program. One
consequence of the new funds,
Hamburg ays, will be to put more
material on stress and conflict in the
Human Biology series.
The teaching part of the program is
"one of the most exciting," he adds.
We hope to set up a curriculum on
problems of violence and aggression
that would provide a working model
for other universities—both at the
undergraduate level and in medical
education."
Money for the program comes from
the Commonwealth Fund, a New York
philanthropic organization. In a letter
to Stanford, its president Quigg
Newton wrote, "It is both appropriate
and imperative for medical schools to
concern themselves with the
consequences to our society and
civilization of the alarming rise in
dominant, assertive, and violent
behavior."
"Medical schools are in a favorable
position to take the initiative," he
added, "because in its broadest sense
medical learning is addressed to
understanding the biological,
psychological and sociological
determinants of human functioning."
The Laboratory of Stress and
Conflict will embody the program's
work in the Department of Psychiatry.

At the same time specialists from the
biological, psychological and social
sciences will take on other research.
For instance, Dr. Hamburg says he is
collaborating with Jan van
Lawick-Goodall, a scientist noted for
work on chimpanzee aggressive
behavior conducted in Tanzania since
1960.
Animal studies are essential to
obtain evolutionary perspective,
Hamburg says. This way, we "can
dimly perceive how man came to be the
way he is, and search for subtle legacies
of his ancient past."
Drs. Goodall and Hamburg began
planning joint research on aggressive
behavior in primates in 1968, for both
Africa and Stanford. Goodall will be a
visiting professor here this fall.
Stress and conflict in adolescence is
one area where the research end of the
program will be concentrated. "The
hormonal changes of puberty and how
they affect the brain during the years
12 to 15," is one topic says Hamburg.
"The prevalence of profoundly
pervasive hostile attitudes, the
extraordinary spread of drugs, and the
upsurge of violence in this age group
sharply highlight the need for deeper
understanding of adolescence," he
adds.
Hamburg is interested in "what
happens to people socially at that age."
The hormonal changes of puberty
occur at the same time a person is
making a social adjustment to high
school, so their interrelationship is
important.
The study is not just limited by the

word "violence," he says. Stress and
conflict "might not involve violence,
but just hatred."
Other directions of research include:
—Development of aggressive
behavior in the early stages of life,
involving both human and animal
studies on the role of the early social
environment on later life.
—Problems of crowding, contact
between strangers, and the
psychobiology of modern living. The
relationships of population density to
body chemistry and behavior is also
covered.

The Medical School has received half
a million dollars to support a
University-wide program of research
and education on the problem of
human aggression and violence.
Dr. David A. Hamburg, chairman of
the Department of Psychiatry, will
direct the new program. One
consequence of the new funds,
Hamburg ays, will be to put more
material on stress and conflict in the
Human Biology series.
The teaching part of the program is
"one of the most exciting," he adds.
We hope to set up a curriculum on
problems of violence and aggression
that would provide a working model
for other universities—both at the
undergraduate level and in medical
education."
Money for the program comes from
the Commonwealth Fund, a New York
philanthropic organization. In a letter
to Stanford, its president Quigg
Newton wrote, "It is both appropriate
and imperative for medical schools to
concern themselves with the
consequences to our society and
civilization of the alarming rise in
dominant, assertive, and violent
behavior."
"Medical schools are in a favorable
position to take the initiative," he
added, "because in its broadest sense
medical learning is addressed to
understanding the biological,
psychological and sociological
determinants of human functioning."
The Laboratory of Stress and
Conflict will embody the program's
work in the Department of Psychiatry.

At the same time specialists from the
biological, psychological and social
sciences will take on other research.
For instance, Dr. Hamburg says he is
collaborating with Jan van
Lawick-Goodall, a scientist noted for
work on chimpanzee aggressive
behavior conducted in Tanzania since
1960.
Animal studies are essential to
obtain evolutionary perspective,
Hamburg says. This way, we "can
dimly perceive how man came to be the
way he is, and search for subtle legacies
of his ancient past."
Drs. Goodall and Hamburg began
planning joint research on aggressive
behavior in primates in 1968, for both
Africa and Stanford. Goodall will be a
visiting professor here this fall.
Stress and conflict in adolescence is
one area where the research end of the
program will be concentrated. "The
hormonal changes of puberty and how
they affect the brain during the years
12 to 15," is one topic says Hamburg.
"The prevalence of profoundly
pervasive hostile attitudes, the
extraordinary spread of drugs, and the
upsurge of violence in this age group
sharply highlight the need for deeper
understanding of adolescence," he
adds.
Hamburg is interested in "what
happens to people socially at that age."
The hormonal changes of puberty
occur at the same time a person is
making a social adjustment to high
school, so their interrelationship is
important.
The study is not just limited by the

word "violence," he says. Stress and
conflict "might not involve violence,
but just hatred."
Other directions of research include:
—Development of aggressive
behavior in the early stages of life,
involving both human and animal
studies on the role of the early social
environment on later life.
—Problems of crowding, contact
between strangers, and the
psychobiology of modern living. The
relationships of population density to
body chemistry and behavior is also
covered.
