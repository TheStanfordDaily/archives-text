# Duke Star Injured
## 
### 
The outlook for the Duke-Stanford game this Saturday changed
drastically Tuesday night when Blue Devil fullback Steve Jones was injured
in a one car accident on the Duke campus.
Coach Mike McGee claims that Jones' car rolled three times after
blowing a tire. According to Duke officials, the star fullback suffered a
ruptured sternum. McGee speculated, however, that Jones might do the
punting against the Indians and be ready to run against Clemson next
weekend.
Jones is the nation's second leading rusher after three games and his loss
renders the Duke offense impotent. Injuries that have made all of the Blue
Devil's defensive front four doubtful starters, plus the loss of Jones, make
the Indians heavy favorites on Saturday.
