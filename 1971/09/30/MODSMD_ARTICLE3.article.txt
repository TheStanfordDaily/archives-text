# Prosecution Witnesses' Testify As Franklin's Hearing Continues
## 
### JON DEDMON 
The associate director of Stanford's overseas campuses,
Paul Hanley, yesterday provided the administration with its
strongest testimony thus far in the trial of suspended
English Professor H. Bruce Franklin.
Hanley claimed that Franklin participated in "chanting
and rhythmic clapping with increasing intensity" in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium the day the cancellation of Henry
Cabot Lodge's speech was forced.
In the early part of yesterday's five hour session, the
prosecution continued to present its evidence concerning
Professor Franklin's role in forcing the cancellation of that
speech on January 11.
Mrs. Catherine Mathews, an elderly gray-haired lady
from Palo Alto testified that she had seen Franklin stand
up and "call out about 'guilt in Vietnam'" which
Ambassador Lodge was trying to make his speech.
She added that Franklin's voice was "loud and
emphatic" and continued "throughout the program."
Testimony Discredited
Mrs. Mathew's testimony was weakened however when
she was unable to identify Franklin in the hearing room.
After a burst of laughter from the audience Franklin,
having been seated at the defense table throughout the
testimony, commented that he "appreciated Mrs. Mathews'
honesty."
A sophomore Christine Jacobs later said that Franklin
had repeatedly shouted "Remember My Lai" and "What
about My Lai?" while Lodge was speaking. She added that
"in my opinion he tried to shout the speaker down."
Yesterday's hearing had opened with an angry charge by
Franklin that there was a "conscious withholding of
evidence on the part of the administration."
Franklin Irked
Visibly irritated, the Marxist scholar charged that he had
been trying since April to get a tape of events near the
computation center on February 10 and that only two days
ago the prosecution had admitted that such evidence
existed and was available.
Franklin accused the Administration of being
"dishonest" and angrily commented that "what we are
talking about is how this case has been framed and framed
is the right word."
The administration attorney responded that he "didn't
know what Franklin was squawking about."

Advisory Board Chairman Donald Kennedy ruled that
Franklin should consult with attorney Fisher about getting
a copy of the tape and that the matter of withholding
evidence should wait until such a time as the prosecution
tries to admit such evidence.
Surprise
One of the day's surprises came when the prosecution
suddenly ended its presentation of witnesses concerning the
Lodge incident midway through the hearing.
A bewildered Franklin commented that he was
"surprised that the administration had not been able to
conjure up more witnesses."
He then entered two motions to dismiss the charges
concerning the Lodge incident and also to sever those
charges from the ones arising out of events on February 10.
Franklin said that the administration had only been able
to show that he was "heckling" Lodge which was permitted
by a recent Supreme Court decision. He added that he
wished severance because he didn't wish the January 11
and February 10 charges to "slop over."
The board denied both motions unanimously.
Prosecution Thwarted
The prosecution then attempted to move to the events
of February 10 but a controversy soon developed over the
photographs Fisher wished to submit as evidence.
Several extended arguments and consultations followed
as to whether Franklin had been provided with all the
photos being presented. Finally Lauren Heck, a
photographer hired by the university to photograph events
on the 10 th, began explaining what he had photographed
that day until adjournment of the hearing at 6 p.m.
Although KZSU was not planning to broadcast
yesterday's procedings, the hearing was put on the air after
about two hours due to over 200 phone calls requesting the
broadcast which poured into the station. The Stanford
station now plans to broadcast all the hearings.
"We just didn't want to be answering the phone all
day," commented one KZSU staffer.
KZSU To Meet
At a meeting tonight the station will decide whether to
broadcast the hearing on Saturday instead of the football
game.
One plan under consideration is to tape the football
game and play the tape on Sunday.
The Franklin hearing resumes today at 1 p.m.

Mrs. Mathew's testimony was weakened however when
she was unable to identify Franklin in the hearing room.
After a burst of laughter from the audience Franklin,
having been seated at the defense table throughout the
testimony, commented that he "appreciated Mrs. Mathews'
honesty."
A sophomore Christine Jacobs later said that Franklin
had repeatedly shouted "Remember My Lai" and "What
about My Lai?" while Lodge was speaking. She added that
"in my opinion he tried to shout the speaker down."
Yesterday's hearing had opened with an angry charge by
Franklin that there was a "conscious withholding of
evidence on the part of the administration."
Franklin Irked
Visibly irritated, the Marxist scholar charged that he had
been trying since April to get a tape of events near the
computation center on February 10 and that only two days
ago the prosecution had admitted that such evidence
existed and was available.
Franklin accused the Administration of being
"dishonest" and angrily commented that "what we are
talking about is how this case has been framed and framed
is the right word."
The administration attorney responded that he "didn't
know what Franklin was squawking about."

Advisory Board Chairman Donald Kennedy ruled that
Franklin should consult with attorney Fisher about getting
a copy of the tape and that the matter of withholding
evidence should wait until such a time as the prosecution
tries to admit such evidence.
Surprise
One of the day's surprises came when the prosecution
suddenly ended its presentation of witnesses concerning the
Lodge incident midway through the hearing.
A bewildered Franklin commented that he was
"surprised that the administration had not been able to
conjure up more witnesses."
He then entered two motions to dismiss the charges
concerning the Lodge incident and also to sever those
charges from the ones arising out of events on February 10.
Franklin said that the administration had only been able
to show that he was "heckling" Lodge which was permitted
by a recent Supreme Court decision. He added that he
wished severance because he didn't wish the January 11
and February 10 charges to "slop over."
The board denied both motions unanimously.
Prosecution Thwarted
The prosecution then attempted to move to the events
of February 10 but a controversy soon developed over the
photographs Fisher wished to submit as evidence.
Several extended arguments and consultations followed
as to whether Franklin had been provided with all the
photos being presented. Finally Lauren Heck, a
photographer hired by the university to photograph events
on the 10 th, began explaining what he had photographed
that day until adjournment of the hearing at 6 p.m.
Although KZSU was not planning to broadcast
yesterday's procedings, the hearing was put on the air after
about two hours due to over 200 phone calls requesting the
broadcast which poured into the station. The Stanford
station now plans to broadcast all the hearings.
"We just didn't want to be answering the phone all
day," commented one KZSU staffer.
KZSU To Meet
At a meeting tonight the station will decide whether to
broadcast the hearing on Saturday instead of the football
game.
One plan under consideration is to tape the football
game and play the tape on Sunday.
The Franklin hearing resumes today at 1 p.m.
The associate director of Stanford's overseas campuses,
Paul Hanley, yesterday provided the administration with its
strongest testimony thus far in the trial of suspended
English Professor H. Bruce Franklin.
Hanley claimed that Franklin participated in "chanting
and rhythmic clapping with increasing intensity" in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium the day the cancellation of Henry
Cabot Lodge's speech was forced.
In the early part of yesterday's five hour session, the
prosecution continued to present its evidence concerning
Professor Franklin's role in forcing the cancellation of that
speech on January 11.
Mrs. Catherine Mathews, an elderly gray-haired lady
from Palo Alto testified that she had seen Franklin stand
up and "call out about 'guilt in Vietnam'" which
Ambassador Lodge was trying to make his speech.
She added that Franklin's voice was "loud and
emphatic" and continued "throughout the program."
