## Course On Franklin Case Begins 
### KATHY WEINBERGER 
Bruce Franklin's case, currently being heard by the
University Advisory Board, will also be tested in the
classroom this quarter and next in a new course being
offered by SWOPSI.
Entitled Unrest in the Academy—The Case of H.
Bruce Franklin, the course will attempt to study the
awakening of political consciousness in the University
and the interest in the problems of academic freedom
that has resulted.
The course, a conception of anthropology
graduate student Enid Hunkeler, will take pains not
to interfere with or bias the Advisory Board verdict.
Alberta Siegel, Associate Dean of Undergraduate
Studies, commented, "with an issue as sensitive as
this we have had to have a large number of
consultations about the details of the course. My
major concern is to not prejudice the hearing and to
ensure that it will run as smoothly as possible."
"People need to become aware of the boundaries
of academic freedom in an institution that depends
for its existence on the sanctions of government,
industry, and alumni with money," said Henry Levin,
Professor of Education and course sponsor. "It is
important that we define what is meant by freedom
to express ideas and at what point that freedom
comes in conflict with the political stance of the
University."
Three Sections
The class will meet one night a week for three
hours. The first two hours will feature a lecture or
general discussion; for the third hour the group will
divide into three sections which will deal with specific
aspects of the case; historical and political, legal, and
sociological. Each section will have its own instructor
and faculty sponsor. In addition, other faculty
members have expressed interest in participating in
the course.

Like most SWOPSI courses, this one will culminate
with the publication of a report.
"The report will be good for people in this area to
find out what's happening, and will be of use to other
people across the country as people change and
become more politically active," said Walter
Hunkeler, law student and an instructor in the course.
The Hunkelers are husband and wife.
Political Analysis
The historical and political section of the course,
led by Walter Hunkeler and Charles Drekmeier,
professor of political science will "historically analyze
other cases on the point of academic firing and try to
understand what social and economic forces were at
work there, as well as what conditions were present,"
explains Professor Hunkeler.
"The political section will deal with current
history—that is, what forces were brought to bear on
the Administration and what are the conditions now.
Is there a political struggle developing in this country
and is Bruce part of that struggle? Why is it that the
University would move against Bruce? We have to
understand the university's structure and interests to
get some understanding of these questions," he said.
Zack Wasserman, a law student and leader of the
legal section of the course, said he plans, among other
things, to examine the basic principles of freedom of
expression and speech, using past cases concerned
with and relating to academic freedom.
Like the Loyalty Oath
"I think the research and publication aspect of the
course is extremely important," he said. "This case
will be a national landmark in this area of free
expression, like the loyalty oath in the 5 o's. Also, if
the case is decided against Bruce, it may be tested in
court and a detailed and accurate analysis like we
intend to publish could be important to such a case.'"
Thelton Henderson, Assistant Dean of the Law

School, and Tom Grey, Law School Professor, will be
the faculty sponsors directly connected with
Wasserman's section.
The sociological section will be led by Enid
Hunkeler; Levin will be the sponsor. The main thrust
of this section, according to Mrs. Hunkeler, will be a
content analysis of what went on during the hearings.
As soon as the Board of Trustees have made a
decision on Franklin's case, the sociological section
members will begin interviewing the people involved
in the case "in order to analyze the social class
assumptions and biases exhibited in what they say,
trying to make the point that what people do and say
is a function of their class backgrounds," Mrs.
Hunkeler said. "This includes us as interviewers as
well as the people we interview," she added.
Concerned With Issue
Levin admitted that everyone involved in planning
the course has a definite point of view concerning the
case: "We are all deeply concerned with the issue and
are not pretending to be neutral," he said. But Enid
Hunkeler made it clear that people will be enc juraged
to openly bring out their views, even if they differ
from the leaders, "so we can discuss them
politically," she said.
Dan Lewis, director of SWOPSI, has a great deal of
confidence in the course. Siegel agreed: "We in the
Undergraduate Studies office have a lot of confidence
in the sponsors of the course. They assured us they
will be actively involved, and our view is that the
more the faculty sponsors are involved in the course,
the more assurance we have that the course will be of
higher quality."
Bruce Franklin also agreed that the course should
be good. "People will probably learn more in that
course than in other courses in the University," he
said.
The first meeting of the course will be tonight at
7 :30 p.m. in the Tresidder large lounge.

aspects of the case; historical and political, legal, and
sociological. Each section will have its own instructor
and faculty sponsor. In addition, other faculty
members have expressed interest in participating in
the course.

Like most SWOPSI courses, this one will culminate
with the publication of a report.
"The report will be good for people in this area to
find out what's happening, and will be of use to other
people across the country as people change and
become more politically active," said Walter
Hunkeler, law student and an instructor in the course.
The Hunkelers are husband and wife.
Political Analysis
The historical and political section of the course,
led by Walter Hunkeler and Charles Drekmeier,
professor of political science will "historically analyze
other cases on the point of academic firing and try to
understand what social and economic forces were at
work there, as well as what conditions were present,"
explains Professor Hunkeler.
"The political section will deal with current
history—that is, what forces were brought to bear on
the Administration and what are the conditions now.
Is there a political struggle developing in this country
and is Bruce part of that struggle? Why is it that the
University would move against Bruce? We have to
understand the university's structure and interests to
get some understanding of these questions," he said.
Zack Wasserman, a law student and leader of the
legal section of the course, said he plans, among other
things, to examine the basic principles of freedom of
expression and speech, using past cases concerned
with and relating to academic freedom.
Like the Loyalty Oath
"I think the research and publication aspect of the
course is extremely important," he said. "This case
will be a national landmark in this area of free
expression, like the loyalty oath in the 5 o's. Also, if
the case is decided against Bruce, it may be tested in
court and a detailed and accurate analysis like we
intend to publish could be important to such a case.'"
Thelton Henderson, Assistant Dean of the Law

School, and Tom Grey, Law School Professor, will be
the faculty sponsors directly connected with
Wasserman's section.
The sociological section will be led by Enid
Hunkeler; Levin will be the sponsor. The main thrust
of this section, according to Mrs. Hunkeler, will be a
content analysis of what went on during the hearings.
As soon as the Board of Trustees have made a
decision on Franklin's case, the sociological section
members will begin interviewing the people involved
in the case "in order to analyze the social class
assumptions and biases exhibited in what they say,
trying to make the point that what people do and say
is a function of their class backgrounds," Mrs.
Hunkeler said. "This includes us as interviewers as
well as the people we interview," she added.
Concerned With Issue
Levin admitted that everyone involved in planning
the course has a definite point of view concerning the
case: "We are all deeply concerned with the issue and
are not pretending to be neutral," he said. But Enid
Hunkeler made it clear that people will be enc juraged
to openly bring out their views, even if they differ
from the leaders, "so we can discuss them
politically," she said.
Dan Lewis, director of SWOPSI, has a great deal of
confidence in the course. Siegel agreed: "We in the
Undergraduate Studies office have a lot of confidence
in the sponsors of the course. They assured us they
will be actively involved, and our view is that the
more the faculty sponsors are involved in the course,
the more assurance we have that the course will be of
higher quality."
Bruce Franklin also agreed that the course should
be good. "People will probably learn more in that
course than in other courses in the University," he
said.
The first meeting of the course will be tonight at
7 :30 p.m. in the Tresidder large lounge.
Bruce Franklin's case, currently being heard by the
University Advisory Board, will also be tested in the
classroom this quarter and next in a new course being
offered by SWOPSI.
Entitled Unrest in the Academy—The Case of H.
Bruce Franklin, the course will attempt to study the
awakening of political consciousness in the University
and the interest in the problems of academic freedom
that has resulted.
The course, a conception of anthropology
graduate student Enid Hunkeler, will take pains not
to interfere with or bias the Advisory Board verdict.
Alberta Siegel, Associate Dean of Undergraduate
Studies, commented, "with an issue as sensitive as
this we have had to have a large number of
consultations about the details of the course. My
major concern is to not prejudice the hearing and to
ensure that it will run as smoothly as possible."
"People need to become aware of the boundaries
of academic freedom in an institution that depends
for its existence on the sanctions of government,
industry, and alumni with money," said Henry Levin,
Professor of Education and course sponsor. "It is
important that we define what is meant by freedom
to express ideas and at what point that freedom
comes in conflict with the political stance of the
University."

The class will meet one night a week for three
hours. The first two hours will feature a lecture or
general discussion; for the third hour the group will

things, to examine the basic principles of freedom of
expression and speech, using past cases concerned
with and relating to academic freedom.
Like the Loyalty Oath
"I think the research and publication aspect of the
course is extremely important," he said. "This case
will be a national landmark in this area of free
expression, like the loyalty oath in the 5 o's. Also, if
the case is decided against Bruce, it may be tested in
court and a detailed and accurate analysis like we
intend to publish could be important to such a case.'"
Thelton Henderson, Assistant Dean of the Law

School, and Tom Grey, Law School Professor, will be
the faculty sponsors directly connected with
Wasserman's section.
The sociological section will be led by Enid
Hunkeler; Levin will be the sponsor. The main thrust
of this section, according to Mrs. Hunkeler, will be a
content analysis of what went on during the hearings.
As soon as the Board of Trustees have made a
decision on Franklin's case, the sociological section
members will begin interviewing the people involved
in the case "in order to analyze the social class
assumptions and biases exhibited in what they say,
trying to make the point that what people do and say
is a function of their class backgrounds," Mrs.
Hunkeler said. "This includes us as interviewers as
well as the people we interview," she added.
Concerned With Issue
Levin admitted that everyone involved in planning
the course has a definite point of view concerning the
case: "We are all deeply concerned with the issue and
are not pretending to be neutral," he said. But Enid
Hunkeler made it clear that people will be enc juraged
to openly bring out their views, even if they differ
from the leaders, "so we can discuss them
politically," she said.
Dan Lewis, director of SWOPSI, has a great deal of
confidence in the course. Siegel agreed: "We in the
Undergraduate Studies office have a lot of confidence
in the sponsors of the course. They assured us they
will be actively involved, and our view is that the
more the faculty sponsors are involved in the course,
the more assurance we have that the course will be of
higher quality."
Bruce Franklin also agreed that the course should
be good. "People will probably learn more in that
course than in other courses in the University," he
said.
The first meeting of the course will be tonight at
7 :30 p.m. in the Tresidder large lounge.
