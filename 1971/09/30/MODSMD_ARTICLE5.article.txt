Editor, THE DAILY:
The ad by five faculty members in Tuesday's
Daily implies, with support from the Daily's own
editorial, that they have some views on the issues
they see in the case which they are being
prevented from expressing. That is, of course,
nonsense. They can express their views by
communications to the Daily, as they have been
doing for some time, and by holding various
meetings on campus, as they indicate they will
continue to do, and by submitting written
statements or briefs to the Advisory Board, in
accordance with its ruling.
What they have been denied is solely the right
to act as a party to the hearing itself, with the
concomitant rights to call any witnesses they may
desire, cross examine all of the witnesses offered
by the other parties and so on. It is, they suggest,
unjust and arbitrary to limit participation in the
conduct of the hearing and exclude any group
which feels it should be allowed to speak.
Such a policy has never been followed, either
by courts or administrative tribunals, since it would
prevent them from performing their functions
even as slowly as they now do. It has always been
found necessary to limit intervention, defining the
role of the would-be intervenor in terms of the
extent of any contribution he may have to make
to the purposes of the hearing.
The main purpose of hearing witnesses in this,
like most, trial hearings is to afford a basis for
ruling on disputes over the facts of what actually
occurred—for example, what Professor Franklin
did or said on the occasions that are cited as

affording grounds for his discharge. If the Faculty
Political Action Group has any witnesses to offer
or contribution to make in this sense, they should
immediately so inform Professor Franklin or the
Administration. But if their "witnesses" and desire
for cross examination are intended simply to
expound their personal views on "questions of war
criminality" and "Stanford's complicity in the
war" and similar matters, it would make very little
sense to afford them the status of parties to the
case. Such matters, to the extent they are relevant
to the case at all, enter in to a determination of
the legal and contractual standards to be applied
to Professor Franklin's conduct; arguments
addressed to questions of law and standards are
customarily, and indeed most effectively,
presented by means of coherent, reasoned written
briefs, not in the forced and artificial form of
"testimony" by witnesses.
The hearing exists only because Professor
Franklin desires it, and is directed toward
establishing the facts of his personal conduct, as a
basis for an advisory judgment by an elected
faculty Board as to whether grounds for his
discharge exist under the terms of paragraph 3 of
the Tenure Statement. The signatories of the Daily
ad might very understandably like to be able to
take over yet another forum to air their views, but
it is hardly any suppression of debate to confine
their role in the hearing to one that gives it some
small chance of performing the function for which
it was established.

they see in the case which they are being
prevented from expressing. That is, of course,
nonsense. They can express their views by
communications to the Daily, as they have been
doing for some time, and by holding various
meetings on campus, as they indicate they will
continue to do, and by submitting written
statements or briefs to the Advisory Board, in
accordance with its ruling.
What they have been denied is solely the right
to act as a party to the hearing itself, with the
concomitant rights to call any witnesses they may
desire, cross examine all of the witnesses offered
by the other parties and so on. It is, they suggest,
unjust and arbitrary to limit participation in the
conduct of the hearing and exclude any group
which feels it should be allowed to speak.
Such a policy has never been followed, either
by courts or administrative tribunals, since it would
prevent them from performing their functions
even as slowly as they now do. It has always been
found necessary to limit intervention, defining the
role of the would-be intervenor in terms of the
extent of any contribution he may have to make
to the purposes of the hearing.
The main purpose of hearing witnesses in this,
like most, trial hearings is to afford a basis for
ruling on disputes over the facts of what actually
occurred—for example, what Professor Franklin
did or said on the occasions that are cited as

affording grounds for his discharge. If the Faculty
Political Action Group has any witnesses to offer
or contribution to make in this sense, they should
immediately so inform Professor Franklin or the
Administration. But if their "witnesses" and desire
for cross examination are intended simply to
expound their personal views on "questions of war
criminality" and "Stanford's complicity in the
war" and similar matters, it would make very little
sense to afford them the status of parties to the
case. Such matters, to the extent they are relevant
to the case at all, enter in to a determination of
the legal and contractual standards to be applied
to Professor Franklin's conduct; arguments
addressed to questions of law and standards are
customarily, and indeed most effectively,
presented by means of coherent, reasoned written
briefs, not in the forced and artificial form of
"testimony" by witnesses.
The hearing exists only because Professor
Franklin desires it, and is directed toward
establishing the facts of his personal conduct, as a
basis for an advisory judgment by an elected
faculty Board as to whether grounds for his
discharge exist under the terms of paragraph 3 of
the Tenure Statement. The signatories of the Daily
ad might very understandably like to be able to
take over yet another forum to air their views, but
it is hardly any suppression of debate to confine
their role in the hearing to one that gives it some
small chance of performing the function for which
it was established.

Editor, THE DAILY:
The ad by five faculty members in Tuesday's
Daily implies, with support from the Daily's own
editorial, that they have some views on the issues
they see in the case which they are being
prevented from expressing. That is, of course,
nonsense. They can express their views by
communications to the Daily, as they have been
doing for some time, and by holding various
meetings on campus, as they indicate they will
continue to do, and by submitting written
statements or briefs to the Advisory Board, in
accordance with its ruling.
What they have been denied is solely the right
to act as a party to the hearing itself, with the
concomitant rights to call any witnesses they may
desire, cross examine all of the witnesses offered
by the other parties and so on. It is, they suggest,
unjust and arbitrary to limit participation in the
