# Hugo Black, Ecology, And The Press
## 
### 
Supreme Court Justice Hugo
Black, who died September 25,
will be remembered as a champion
of civil liberties. His absolutist,
literal interpretation of the words
of the Bill of Rights was an
important influence in producing
the libertarian decisions of the
Warren Court.
Black believed in a strict
construction of the Constitution's
language. He did not recognize, as
he should have, that human rights
are founded in natural law and
that any legal code (including the
U.S. Constitution) depends for its
legitimacy on its conformity to
natural law.
But Black's judicial
philosophy, even though he had
no standard of justice outside of
the plain meaning of the literal
terms of the Constitution, did
reflect the natural rights
philosophical atmosphere of the
eighteenth century in which the
Bill of Rights was written, because
of Black's reliance on the exact
words of the Constitution.
Nonetheless, Black's
dependence on the letter of the
fundamental law led him to adopt
illiberal positions, not in accord
with justice, in cases involving
wiretapping, illegal searches,
economic issues, and
dissemination of birth control
information. The most famous

instance of Black adopting a
non-libertarian position was his
opinion in the 1944 Korematsu
case, upholding the government's
internment of Japanese-American
citizens during World War 11. In
the overwhelming majority of
cases, however, Black upheld the
rights of the individual.
Mere Admonitions
In a lecture at NYU Law
School in 1960, Black
summarized his view of the U.S.
Constitution:
"Some people regard the
prohibitions of the Constitution,
even its most unequivocal
commands, as mere admonitions
which Congress need not always

must 'compete' for survival
against general powers expressly
granted to Congress and that the
individual's right must, if
outweighed by the public interest,
be subordinated to the
Government's competing interest
in denying the right ....
"I cannot accept this approach
to the Bill of Rights. It is my
belief that there are 'absolutes' in
our Bill of Rights, and that they
were put there on purpose by men
who knew what words meant, and
meant their prohibitions to be
'absolute."
No Libel Suits
Black opposed libel suits and
believed that the First and

subordinate, and thus must
abandon what is best for himself
in order to do what is right for the
earth." Sehall goes on to point
out that for Marxists too, "the
root is man."
In the Summer 1971 issue of
Modern Age, Murray N. Rothbard
says:"From the time of Aristotle,
the classical philosophy presented
man as only fulfilling himself, his
nature, and his personality
through purposive action upon
the world. It is from such rational
and purposive action that the
works of civilization have
developed."
Rothbard compares the
Counter-Culture with "its wish to
live simply and in 'harmony' with
'the earth' and the alleged
rhythms of nature" to
Rousseauist Romanticism. At last
the intellectual honeymoon
granted to the ecology
movement's profoundly inhumane
cult of the hunting and-gathering
society is coming to a close.

The September-October
Columbia Journalism Review
contains this exchange on the
Pentagon Papers between Philip L.
Geyelin, editor of the editorial
page of the Washington Post, and
Tom Wicker, who writes the "In
the Nation" column on the
editorial page of the New York
Times.
Geyelin: "... I would like to
ask what would the Times have
done if this administration had
not had the record of a campaign
against the press, if President
Nixon could have brought himself
to call up the publisher of the
Times and say, 'My experts tell
me that in the Pentagon Papers
there is much material that is
dynamite, and I would like to
take the opportunity to have my
experts talk to your editors.' The
Times would have been in the
same box as it was on the Bay of
Pigs and in the missile crisis. It
might not have wanted to
cooperate, but the government
could have made a convincing
case. But they (the government)
went with a club instead, and it
didn't work."
Wicker: "If for some reason
the government had known that
we were getting ready to publish
these documents and had done
precisely as you suggest before we
published them, then I can't
answer for what would have
happened. I assume that there
would have been some degree of
cooperation ..
