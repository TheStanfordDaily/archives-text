# Miss Jingo Likes The Meatloaf Kid
## 
### 
(Editor's Note: From week to
week, 'The Collegiate Papers"
will endeavor to bring to The
Farm, the BIG news stories from
the college newspapers that
stubbornly remain on our
exchange list or fail to read this
feature.)
Unitarians are grokking
violence this week in lowa City,
Funds are missing at Georgetown,
Miss America is speaking truth to
power, and the collegiate papers
are out to improve on last year's
record for stolen FBI files, police
raids, and censorship struggles.
Jingoism Department: Miss
America's latest dictum to the
masses, according to North
Carolina's Daily Tar Heel,
included such taboo busters as "It
would be good to end the war but
I believe we have a right to be in
Vietnam." On premarrital sex, she
smiled purely, "It's not for me."
Other such mind-bogglers as
"He should be allowed to follow
his program because he knows a
lot more about it than the
majority of normal citizen." Who
does she think knows a lot more
than us? Richard Nixon, the
Meatloaf Kid, of course.
She also revealed that she
doesn't own a single pair of

bluejeans. The Daily Tar Heel
likened her as a spokeswoman for
youth to Hitler representing B'nai
B'rith. Crude, but korrect.
Winner of the Gravity Award
for the heaviest edit of the week is
the University Daily from Texas
Tech. The Red Raider writers
called for action (!)—'"revision of

athletic seating system not only
for football next year but for
basketball this year, better snack
bar facilities, a discount gas
station for students, and a review
of school songs."
The Daily Tar Heel's editorials
got the greatest response, though.
September 7, the Sticky Feet
opined on "Cold Campus Needs
Our Personal Warmth." The
reaction necessitated an essay "On

Hot Feelings" a week later.
In the Zig Zag news, the
University Daily Kansan—daring
to struggle—editorialized in favor
of the legalization of marijuana.
Meanwhile in Cougar country,
Washington State's Daily
Evergreen ran a story on Andy
Moes (a.k.a. "Happy Andy"), the

21-year-old narc who nabbed
Robert Kennedy, Jr. two summers
back.
All Moes could say about it
was that "it was a dirty, stinking
job. I found the work distasteful,
sneaky, dirty, underhanded
distasteful both personally and
professionally." Explaining why
he became an undercover cop,
Happy Andy moaned, "I had to
see what it felt like to be hated,

detested, spat upon—all for $2.79
an hour." Strike One for the
Counter Culture.
Speaking of Exploitation, the
Daily lowan recently reported on
"Seventeen" magazine's revelation
that "teenage girls have the most,
by the most and are now buying
more than ever."
The mag continued addressing
itself to everything you always
wanted to know about women's
rags by polling 1,102 teenage
females on what they wear.
Results: the average teener fem
spends $542.07 a year on clothes.
Rip-Off Details: "a resounding
98.6 percent own bras," 97.8
percent own slips, and 91.8
percent "possess panties."
"Seventeen" somberly concluded
that "Innerwear (i.e.—Under
wear) rests on a firm foundation
with teenage girls."
G one-But-Forgotten
Department: Last weekend, Texas
Tech's SAE House had its annual
Watermelon Bust Queen contest
before a dance featuring the
"Traveling Salesmen."

Washington State's Daily
Evergreen ran a story on Andy
Moes (a.k.a. "Happy Andy"), the

21-year-old narc who nabbed
Robert Kennedy, Jr. two summers
back.
All Moes could say about it
was that "it was a dirty, stinking
job. I found the work distasteful,
sneaky, dirty, underhanded
distasteful both personally and
professionally." Explaining why
he became an undercover cop,
Happy Andy moaned, "I had to
see what it felt like to be hated,

detested, spat upon—all for $2.79
an hour." Strike One for the
Counter Culture.
Speaking of Exploitation, the
Daily lowan recently reported on
"Seventeen" magazine's revelation
that "teenage girls have the most,
by the most and are now buying
more than ever."
The mag continued addressing
itself to everything you always
wanted to know about women's
rags by polling 1,102 teenage
females on what they wear.
Results: the average teener fem
spends $542.07 a year on clothes.
Rip-Off Details: "a resounding
98.6 percent own bras," 97.8
percent own slips, and 91.8
percent "possess panties."
"Seventeen" somberly concluded
that "Innerwear (i.e.—Under
wear) rests on a firm foundation
with teenage girls."
G one-But-Forgotten
Department: Last weekend, Texas
Tech's SAE House had its annual
Watermelon Bust Queen contest
before a dance featuring the
"Traveling Salesmen."

(Editor's Note: From week to
week, 'The Collegiate Papers"
will endeavor to bring to The
Farm, the BIG news stories from
the college newspapers that
stubbornly remain on our
exchange list or fail to read this
feature.)
Unitarians are grokking
violence this week in lowa City,
Funds are missing at Georgetown,
Miss America is speaking truth to
power, and the collegiate papers
are out to improve on last year's
record for stolen FBI files, police
raids, and censorship struggles.
Jingoism Department: Miss
America's latest dictum to the
masses, according to North
Carolina's Daily Tar Heel,
included such taboo busters as "It
would be good to end the war but
I believe we have a right to be in
Vietnam." On premarrital sex, she
smiled purely, "It's not for me."
Other such mind-bogglers as
"He should be allowed to follow
his program because he knows a
lot more about it than the
majority of normal citizen." Who
does she think knows a lot more
than us? Richard Nixon, the
Meatloaf Kid, of course.
She also revealed that she
doesn't own a single pair of

bluejeans. The Daily Tar Heel
likened her as a spokeswoman for
youth to Hitler representing B'nai
B'rith. Crude, but korrect.
Winner of the Gravity Award
for the heaviest edit of the week is
the University Daily from Texas
Tech. The Red Raider writers
called for action (!)—'"revision of

athletic seating system not only
for football next year but for
basketball this year, better snack
bar facilities, a discount gas
station for students, and a review
of school songs."
The Daily Tar Heel's editorials
got the greatest response, though.
September 7, the Sticky Feet
opined on "Cold Campus Needs
Our Personal Warmth." The
reaction necessitated an essay "On

Hot Feelings" a week later.
In the Zig Zag news, the
University Daily Kansan—daring
to struggle—editorialized in favor
of the legalization of marijuana.

Washington State's Daily
