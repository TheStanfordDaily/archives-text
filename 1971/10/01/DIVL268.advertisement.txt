Name one
thing that
hasn't gone up
since 1950.
1
Try. Try hard.
The only thing we can think of .
is what we make. The Swingline
"Tot 50" Stapler. 98C in 1950.
980 in 1971.
And it still comes with 1000 free
staples and a handy carrying
pouch. It staples, tacks and
mends. It's unconditionally
guaranteed. It's one of the
world's smallest staplers.
And it's the world's biggest
seller. Could be that's why it
hasn't gone up in price in
21 years.
If you're interested in something
a little bigger, our Cub Desk
Stapler and Cub Hand Stapler
are only $1.98. Both Tot and
Cub Staplers are available at
Stationery, Variety and College
Bookstores.
The Swingline "Tot 50"
98C in 1950. 98C in 1971.
If you can name something else
that hasn't gone up in price
since 1950, let us know. We'll
send you a free Tot Stapler with
1000 staples and a vinyl pouch.
Enclose 25e to cover postage
and handling.
