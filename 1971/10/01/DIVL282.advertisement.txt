For a While
It was Hard to Say—
which was growing faster
— the Peninsula's war
industries or Kepler's
Books. The balance may
be tipping: Lockheed
recently had to get a
Government-backed loan
just to stay in business,
while Kepler's went right
on expanding helped
only by book-reading
friends.
Drop in this week to
see the new, enlarged
Kepler's store in Menlo
Park. You'll find, not
one, but two, new
offstreet parking lots for
Kepler's customers.
For all the paperbacks
it's
Kepler's Books
& Magazines
No. 1 - 825 El Camino
Menlo Park
No. 2 - Village Corner
El Camino & San Antonio
Los Altos
"The Peninsula's
largest anti-missile
bookstore"
