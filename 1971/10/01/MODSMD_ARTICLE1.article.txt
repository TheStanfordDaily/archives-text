# Players Feel Coaching Pressures
## 
### FRED MANN Last in a series 
The pressures facing college football players from
the academic community are obvious and in plain
sight of the average football fan. Socially and
academically, athletes—especially big ones that stand
out as athletes—are scorned, stereotyped, penalized,
and abused by sophisticated students and faculty who
can see them only as numbers and positions.
Hut students and professors are not the only
ones who, in the opinion of many players, use them
for their muscle and disregard them as individuals. A
number of players at Stanford cite an additional
source.
"The coaches are really to blame," said former
defensive lineman Tim McClure. "They treat the
players like machines—instruments to be
manipulated. The same situation exists at every
school that is a big-time football power, and
compared to someplace like USC or Alabama,
Stanford coaches probably show some degree of
awareness. But for the players, it's still unbearable."
Dissent among the last year's players was not made
public until just recently. Athletes, concerned about
possible reprisals and repercussions, tend to grin and
bear it rather than open team problems to outsiders.
Although some members of the team, noteably the
team captains Jim Plunkett and Jack Schultz, voiced
no real discontent with the football program,
McClure states the majority of players were
extremely unhappy during the entire season. "But the
signs of open hostility didn't appear until Head Coach
John Ralston started berating the team for losing the
last two meaningless games of the season, and

promised he would 'break us all down' in practice for
the Rose Bowl," he said. "His insistance on treating
Rose Bowl practice and preparation as a punishment
rather than an honor caused a minor player rebellion
just before the game. Luckily, we straightened it all
out, at least enough to get excited about the Rose
Bowl, and win it."
McClure's story is supported by that of former
place kicker Steve Horowitz. Quick to point out that
the Stanford coaches were probably some of the most
reasonable men in their field, he then added, "But
nevertheless, the most unifying factor on last year's
team was the feeling of the players for one
another-not the coaches."
Alumni Control
Horowitz believes however that antagonism
between coach and player is not really the fault of
either one of them. "The coach is paid to win, and he
goes about doing that the best way he knows how,"
he said. "If he doesn't succeed, he won't be able to
support his family. So long as the emphasis in
organized football is on victory and nothing else, and
so long as the alumni hold all the cards, players will
always be under pressure."
Ralston claims he recognizes the unhappiness felt
by those players who say they are nothing more than
machines to their coaches, but he calls their
complaints groundless. "We certainly see the boys as
individuals," he said. "Today's style is to coach the
mind more than the body." The author of a
soon-to-be released book tentatively titled Coaching
Today's Athlete, Ralston admits that "that do-or-die
for the old alma mater is gone," but he feels a team
unity based on players' individual pride and their
desire to win for each other lives on.

"It's true that we want to do our best for each
other," commented Horowitz, "because the feelings
of friendship and comradery that you build with
teammates are about all that you can get out of the
sport. Unfortunately it's difficult for the coaches to
do anything to foster those relationships."
No Rapport
The cry is the same as that heard at every
successful football school. As former safety Jim
Kauffman put it,"The coaches here, especially the
head coach, have absolutely no rapport with the
players. From the moment you arrive on campus,
they expect you to fit into a certain mold, and if you
are the slightest bit different, they don't want you.
There's lots of pressures on an athlete at Stanford,
and lots of discrimination. But when it comes to
stereotyping, the coaches are much more guilty than
the students."
Kauffman was never one to fit the football image,
and he admits it."I was a real dissenter by my
sophomore year," he said. "I used to do little things
like sing around the coaches, and act goofy, just to
show them 1 wasn't into their seriousness trip. They
hated me for it."
Demea Washington, former wide receiver agrees
with Kauffman that "The coaches just can't cope
with individuality. If you're not going around with
fire in your eyes, frothing at the mouth, having
epileptic fits about football, they don't want you.
They claim to teach pride and poise, but except for
one or two of them, they don't have any of either.
"It's really criminal," Washington added, "that
men like that are allowed to mess up the minds of so
many 18-year old kids. When everyone knows you're

ADVICE—Head football Coach John Ralston is described by most players on his
team as one of the most understanding coaches in the college game today. But
many also detest his position and those of his assistants, calling them "nothing
more than muscle-bound indoctrinators."
