# Players Feel Coaching Pressures
## 
### FRED MANN Last in a series 
The pressures facing college football players from
the academic community are obvious and in plain
sight of the average football fan. Socially and
academically, athletes—especially big ones that stand
out as athletes—are scorned, stereotyped, penalized,
and abused by sophisticated students and faculty who
can see them only as numbers and positions.
Hut students and professors are not the only
ones who, in the opinion of many players, use them
for their muscle and disregard them as individuals. A
number of players at Stanford cite an additional
source.
"The coaches are really to blame," said former
defensive lineman Tim McClure. "They treat the
players like machines—instruments to be
manipulated. The same situation exists at every
school that is a big-time football power, and
compared to someplace like USC or Alabama,
Stanford coaches probably show some degree of
awareness. But for the players, it's still unbearable."
Dissent among the last year's players was not made
public until just recently. Athletes, concerned about
possible reprisals and repercussions, tend to grin and
bear it rather than open team problems to outsiders.
Although some members of the team, noteably the
team captains Jim Plunkett and Jack Schultz, voiced
no real discontent with the football program,
McClure states the majority of players were
extremely unhappy during the entire season. "But the
signs of open hostility didn't appear until Head Coach
John Ralston started berating the team for losing the
last two meaningless games of the season, and

promised he would 'break us all down' in practice for
the Rose Bowl," he said. "His insistance on treating
Rose Bowl practice and preparation as a punishment
rather than an honor caused a minor player rebellion
just before the game. Luckily, we straightened it all
out, at least enough to get excited about the Rose
Bowl, and win it."
McClure's story is supported by that of former
place kicker Steve Horowitz. Quick to point out that
the Stanford coaches were probably some of the most
reasonable men in their field, he then added, "But
nevertheless, the most unifying factor on last year's
team was the feeling of the players for one
another-not the coaches."
Alumni Control
Horowitz believes however that antagonism
between coach and player is not really the fault of
either one of them. "The coach is paid to win, and he
goes about doing that the best way he knows how,"
he said. "If he doesn't succeed, he won't be able to
support his family. So long as the emphasis in
organized football is on victory and nothing else, and
so long as the alumni hold all the cards, players will
always be under pressure."
Ralston claims he recognizes the unhappiness felt
by those players who say they are nothing more than
machines to their coaches, but he calls their
complaints groundless. "We certainly see the boys as
individuals," he said. "Today's style is to coach the
mind more than the body." The author of a
soon-to-be released book tentatively titled Coaching
Today's Athlete, Ralston admits that "that do-or-die
for the old alma mater is gone," but he feels a team
unity based on players' individual pride and their
desire to win for each other lives on.

"It's true that we want to do our best for each
other," commented Horowitz, "because the feelings
of friendship and comradery that you build with
teammates are about all that you can get out of the
sport. Unfortunately it's difficult for the coaches to
do anything to foster those relationships."
No Rapport
The cry is the same as that heard at every
successful football school. As former safety Jim
Kauffman put it,"The coaches here, especially the
head coach, have absolutely no rapport with the
players. From the moment you arrive on campus,
they expect you to fit into a certain mold, and if you
are the slightest bit different, they don't want you.
There's lots of pressures on an athlete at Stanford,
and lots of discrimination. But when it comes to
stereotyping, the coaches are much more guilty than
the students."
Kauffman was never one to fit the football image,
and he admits it."I was a real dissenter by my
sophomore year," he said. "I used to do little things
like sing around the coaches, and act goofy, just to
show them 1 wasn't into their seriousness trip. They
hated me for it."
Demea Washington, former wide receiver agrees
with Kauffman that "The coaches just can't cope
with individuality. If you're not going around with
fire in your eyes, frothing at the mouth, having
epileptic fits about football, they don't want you.
They claim to teach pride and poise, but except for
one or two of them, they don't have any of either.
"It's really criminal," Washington added, "that
men like that are allowed to mess up the minds of so
many 18-year old kids. When everyone knows you're

ADVICE—Head football Coach John Ralston is described by most players on his
team as one of the most understanding coaches in the college game today. But
many also detest his position and those of his assistants, calling them "nothing
more than muscle-bound indoctrinators."
the best at your position, and they (the coaches)
don't give you a chance because you can't bring,
yourself to slap them on the back and laugh at their
dumb jokes like some other players do, it really hurts
you psychologically.
Practice and Preach
"If you preach 100 percent effort, you must live
it. But the coaches are basically lazy—they never
absorb anything you tell them. Especially if you're
black. They are in a position to create a fair and
equitable system of dealing with players, but they
always screw it up."
Currently studying at the University of California's
Boalt Law School, Washington stated he, like most
everyone on the team, played football because he
enjoyed the sport and the competition that goes
along with it."I had too many positive
reinforcements to ever make me feel that I should
quit playing," he said. "I never quit anything. But if
anything would have made me want to quit, it would
have been the Stanford coaches."
In defense of Ralston, the local press described
him as, "far ahead of most coaches in his realization
that athletes have changed." One football dropout,
Steve Jubb, called him, "the most honest, sincere,
hardest working coach I've ever seen around," and
although many players detested the position he holds,
no one had a bad word to say about him personally.
Ralston answers the critics of football saying he
and his staff do not abuse a player's personal rights.
"There are certain things uniform to football," he
said. "We believe every athlete should develop a
strong self-image, and we try to help them develop
this." He added laughingly, "I think these lessons
learned on the football field are more important than
all that trash they learn over there (in the
classrooms)."
Although the coach went on to say he encourages
new ideas from his players and welcomes feedback,
accounts of the hushed-up Rose Bowl rebellion
indicate just the opposite. More than 20 members of
the team reportedly decided that they had had
enough of the grinding two-a-day practices, early

curfew, and alleged restrictions of freedom imposed
by Ralston while the team was quartered in Long
Beach prior to the New Year's Day game. Practice
had begun in a driving rain on the first day of final
exam week in Palo Alto, and did not let up until the
players confronted the coach.
Resignation Threat
Although team co-captain Schultz was described as
"shook up" by the dissent and co-captain Plunkett
termed "befuddled," the majority were reported to
have supported the suggestion of refusing to practice
until restrictions were eased. Numerous sources state
that when informed of the team's decision, Ralston
threatened to resign.
"We all wanted to win the Rose Bowl," said
McClure, "so we just gave in. We souldn't have, but
we did. Ralston is a powerful personality who easily
intimidates you when he speaks. Some guys felt sorry
for him. Others got scared. We just simply caved in."
A compromise of sorts was reached, and Stanford
buried its difficulties in order to win the Rose Bowl.
(Ralston later brushed off the minor rebellion, calling
the player demands "as natural as blueberry pie.")
The victory made every Stanford football fan, player,
and coach happy—at least for a while. It also pushed
the membership of Stanford's alumni boosters, the
Buck Club, higher than ever before.
The group jumped from a total of 3,600
supporters to 4,200 in the successful year of 1970-71,
and is growing every day—much to the consternation
of the opponents of organized football. "The power
of the alumni over college football everywhere is the
key problem with the sport today," said McClure,
"And Stanford is no exception.
"Sure, the Buck Club provides lots of money for
athletic scholarships. They are very generous, there is
no doubt. But they are all a bunch of old Stanford
athletes who insist on having today's football player
go through the same wringers to gain the same glory
that they did. They don't realize that athletes today
are different. We don't want the pressures and the
hero-worshipers and the phoney stereotypes created
by publicity men's typewriters. We just want control
of our own sport."

Clark B. Graham of Sacramento, chairman of the
Buck Club, defended the group and explained, "Many
alums believe there is a role in the academic world for
intercollegiate athletics. We realize that the program
as it stands today is not perfect, but we still strongly
support the philosophy behind it."
Certainly not every player at Stanford (or at any
other school that shares the common goals of
academic quality and athletic excellence) is unhappy
in his surroundings. "I enjoyed the academic
atmosphere of Stanford," said Jim Plunkett recently.
"It was a challenge to me. The social pressures might
have been eased if I had gone to USC or some other
big-time football school, but I don't think 1 would
have been as happy. I'm glad to have played for
Coach Ralston, and I'm glad to have played with the
teammates that I did. It all worked out fine."
The simplicity in sports that the average fan enjoys
is rapidly dying. There is no stopping it. The complex
interpersonal problems suffered by athletes and their
critics are manifesting themselves as player unions
and strikes, racial protests, women's protests, Gay Lib
protests, drug problems, and more. The complex
nature that athletics is assuming may prove terribly
frustrating to the simplicity seekers who thrive only
on sports, but the frustration must be dealt with.
Football is a microcosm of today's troubled
American society, and the problems that surround it
must be solved as thoroughly as those that plague the
society itself.
Meanwhile, the ranks of the discontented continue
to swell. Those players whose unhappiness
overshadows their desire to play will undoubtedly
give the college game up, and will probably not do so
quietly. Others will swallow their problems, at least
from August through November, and will continue to
ask themselves why they are putting up with it all.
Yet it is clear that unless the powers that be in college
football begin to understand the complaints of the
modern, independent athlete and start to do
something about them—more than is currently being
done—the institution of alumni-run university
football rests on shaky ground. The era of Knute
Rockne and the subservient slaves is gone forever.
