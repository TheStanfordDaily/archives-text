"The National Geographic
Society has found that U.S.
females utter about 175
syllables per minute to the
U.S. male's 150. But the
French (both sexes) gallop
along at 350!"
—Fielding's Super Economy
(Guide to) Europe, 1971
TOURS, France, Sunday,
Sept. 26—Earlier this week,
after grabbing a lightweight

typewriter and stuffing a few
pieces of clothing into a
suitcase, I found myself aboard
Pan American World Airways
charter flight 32,621 (San
Francisco-New York-Paris-
Vienna). A full plane; first
class for the faculty and staff;
cargo class for the students.
Not too much sleep, but
movies (lousy) and lots of
Schlitz (cold, even), hash and
Pan Am's famous vintage '67.
Orly Airport at 4 a.m.
(EDST, or 9 a.m. Paris time) is
not such a bad place; it's full
of funny-looking businessmen
assaulting one's senses by
speaking unintelligible
mumble-jumble hell bent for
leather. French Customs were
practically non-existant; they
didn't even look at me (so
who wants to be stared at at
that hour of the day,
anyway?). A quick stop at the
Societe Generate for some
funny money (worth more and
more as the value of the dollar
declines—so far, some nine
percent in less than one
month); then a two and one
half hour bus ride to the
campus at Tours.
Glassy-eyed, we stumble off
the bus. According to the
clock, it's lunch-time; according
to our stomachs (which we
have been stuffing for the past
10 hours or so), it's either
bed- or breakfast-time.
Sleep, sleep, beautiful sleep
all afternoon. Seldom have
soggy matresses felt so good.
Some people reported as many
as 19 consecutive hours in the
rack. Others awoke to eat some

more. Evening—a quick stroll
through an obnoxious
thunderstorm. Then more sleep.
* * *
Life goes on. Sightseeing in
and around Tours and its
famous chateaux. A speaker
from the Sorbonne. "Life at
Stanford-in-France." A trip to
the Post Office (postage is very
expensive here); one to
Monoprix, the equivalent of
Macy's or Sears. The
Bookstore's typical screw-ups:
too many copies of an
economics textbook; too few
copies of Passage To India. A
challenge; talking-or attempting
to talk—with some French
students. Placement tests.
Registration and informational
meetings.
The most overwhelming
feeling now (at least to an
ex-newsman of sorts) is that of
isolation. Le Monde, in keeping
with its reputation as an
international newspaper, usually
carries less than 10 inches of
news dealing with the U.S.
daily. The Attica Correctional
Facility is mentioned only in
connection with French prison
uprisings. The International
Herald-Tribune is a joke—more
financial news (i.e., N.Y. stock
quotations) than anything else.
All the news is stale; we get
Friday's news on Monday. (The
same seems to be true of
French radio news.) Perhaps we
will get the Stanford-Oregon
score tomorrow. Who knows?
Our classes start at 8 a.m.
tomorrow. To achieve a
four-day class week, there are
classes from 8 until noon;
12:45-7; and 7:45-9:15. The
day will start for perhaps half
of the group at 8 a.m. with
Prof. Gurley's famed Econ 1.
This weekend, 35 of our group
are going en masse to the
Oktoberfest in Munich; next
weekend, most of our little
band of 80 are going to
Dordogne, in the southern part
of the country.
Even in France, though, you
can tell you're at Stanford;
people already are starting to
rip off the travel guides. It
looks like an interesting six
months.

uprisings. The International
Herald-Tribune is a joke—more
financial news (i.e., N.Y. stock
quotations) than anything else.
All the news is stale; we get
Friday's news on Monday. (The
same seems to be true of
French radio news.) Perhaps we
will get the Stanford-Oregon
score tomorrow. Who knows?
Our classes start at 8 a.m.
tomorrow. To achieve a
four-day class week, there are
classes from 8 until noon;
12:45-7; and 7:45-9:15. The
day will start for perhaps half
of the group at 8 a.m. with
Prof. Gurley's famed Econ 1.
This weekend, 35 of our group
are going en masse to the
Oktoberfest in Munich; next
weekend, most of our little
band of 80 are going to
Dordogne, in the southern part
of the country.
Even in France, though, you
can tell you're at Stanford;
people already are starting to
rip off the travel guides. It
looks like an interesting six
months.

TOURS, France, Sunday,
Sept. 26—Earlier this week,
after grabbing a lightweight

typewriter and stuffing a few
pieces of clothing into a
suitcase, I found myself aboard
Pan American World Airways
charter flight 32,621 (San
Francisco-New York-Paris-
Vienna). A full plane; first
class for the faculty and staff;
cargo class for the students.
Not too much sleep, but
movies (lousy) and lots of
Schlitz (cold, even), hash and
Pan Am's famous vintage '67.
Orly Airport at 4 a.m.
(EDST, or 9 a.m. Paris time) is
not such a bad place; it's full
of funny-looking businessmen
assaulting one's senses by
speaking unintelligible
mumble-jumble hell bent for
leather. French Customs were
practically non-existant; they
didn't even look at me (so
who wants to be stared at at
that hour of the day,
anyway?). A quick stop at the
Societe Generate for some
funny money (worth more and
more as the value of the dollar
declines—so far, some nine
percent in less than one
month); then a two and one
half hour bus ride to the
campus at Tours.
Glassy-eyed, we stumble off
the bus. According to the
clock, it's lunch-time; according
to our stomachs (which we
have been stuffing for the past
10 hours or so), it's either
bed- or breakfast-time.
Sleep, sleep, beautiful sleep
all afternoon. Seldom have
soggy matresses felt so good.
Some people reported as many
as 19 consecutive hours in the
rack. Others awoke to eat some

more. Evening—a quick stroll
through an obnoxious
thunderstorm. Then more sleep.

Life goes on. Sightseeing in
and around Tours and its
famous chateaux. A speaker
from the Sorbonne. "Life at
Stanford-in-France." A trip to
the Post Office (postage is very
expensive here); one to
Monoprix, the equivalent of
Macy's or Sears. The
Bookstore's typical screw-ups:
too many copies of an
economics textbook; too few
copies of Passage To India. A
challenge; talking-or attempting
to talk—with some French
students. Placement tests.
Registration and informational
meetings.
The most overwhelming
feeling now (at least to an
ex-newsman of sorts) is that of
isolation. Le Monde, in keeping
with its reputation as an
international newspaper, usually
carries less than 10 inches of
news dealing with the U.S.
daily. The Attica Correctional
Facility is mentioned only in
connection with French prison
uprisings. The International

more as the value of the dollar
declines—so far, some nine
percent in less than one
month); then a two and one
half hour bus ride to the
campus at Tours.
Glassy-eyed, we stumble off
the bus. According to the
clock, it's lunch-time; according
to our stomachs (which we
have been stuffing for the past
10 hours or so), it's either
bed- or breakfast-time.
Sleep, sleep, beautiful sleep
all afternoon. Seldom have
soggy matresses felt so good.
Some people reported as many
as 19 consecutive hours in the
rack. Others awoke to eat some

more. Evening—a quick stroll
through an obnoxious
thunderstorm. Then more sleep.

Life goes on. Sightseeing in
and around Tours and its
famous chateaux. A speaker
from the Sorbonne. "Life at
Stanford-in-France." A trip to
the Post Office (postage is very
expensive here); one to
Monoprix, the equivalent of
Macy's or Sears. The
Bookstore's typical screw-ups:
too many copies of an
economics textbook; too few
copies of Passage To India. A
challenge; talking-or attempting
to talk—with some French
students. Placement tests.
Registration and informational
meetings.
The most overwhelming
feeling now (at least to an
ex-newsman of sorts) is that of
isolation. Le Monde, in keeping
with its reputation as an
international newspaper, usually
carries less than 10 inches of
news dealing with the U.S.
daily. The Attica Correctional
Facility is mentioned only in
connection with French prison
uprisings. The International
Herald-Tribune is a joke—more
financial news (i.e., N.Y. stock
quotations) than anything else.
All the news is stale; we get
Friday's news on Monday. (The
same seems to be true of
French radio news.) Perhaps we
will get the Stanford-Oregon
score tomorrow. Who knows?
Our classes start at 8 a.m.
tomorrow. To achieve a
four-day class week, there are
classes from 8 until noon;
12:45-7; and 7:45-9:15. The
day will start for perhaps half
of the group at 8 a.m. with
Prof. Gurley's famed Econ 1.
This weekend, 35 of our group
are going en masse to the
Oktoberfest in Munich; next
weekend, most of our little
band of 80 are going to
Dordogne, in the southern part
of the country.
Even in France, though, you
can tell you're at Stanford;
people already are starting to
rip off the travel guides. It
looks like an interesting six
months.
