There are at least six broad
options open to America's private
universities to save them from
extinction, a Stanford educator
told a Founder's Day audience at
Breighton University here
Thursday, Sept. 30.
Lewis B. Mayhew, professor of
education, said the past decade of
rapid expansion, together with
steadily rising costs, deficit
spending, and a loss of
"distinctiveness," were among the
problems facing America's private
colleges and universities.
"Despite past glories and
notable contemporary
achievements," Professor Mayhew
warned the Creighton audience,
"privately controlled higher
education is currently facing such
serious crises as to leave its very
existence in considerable doubt."
One avenue to salvation, he
said, is for the larger institutions
at least to go totally or partially
"public"—to become part of or
affiliated with the public system,
as in the cases of the Universities
of Buffalo, Kansas City,
Pittsburgh or Temple.
Another option, he noted, is
for private universities to analyze
their difficulties and institute a
wide-ranging program of reform
"which could if successful restore
financial health, intellectual
power, and institutional
visibility."
This option involves "serious
efforts to cut instructional costs,"
he said, which could produce a
gain in quality without serious
side effects.
Professor Mayhew, a specialist
in the governance and operation
of smaller liberal arts colleges,
suggested that these institutions
could revise and intensify their
admissions activity.
