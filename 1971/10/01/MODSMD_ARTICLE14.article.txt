# Minority Enrollment Up At Stanford Law School

### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Minority enrollment at the Stanford Law
School has either risen substantially for the new
semester or has merely gone from one
undesirable level to another, depending on who
is speaking.
Enrollment in the school now stands at
approximately 160 students, of which 19 are
members of minority groups. The figure
represents an increase of nine students over the
previous semester's 10.
Ed Hayes, president of the Law Association,
blasted the figure as "deplorable." He said that
the number of minority students was "not
significant enough to represent any commitment
or particular interest on the part of the
Administration in making legal education
available to nonwhite students!
"A lot remains to be done to bring minority
students to Stanford, and that work should be

done now, in earnest," said Hayes, who is
Black.
Assistant Dean Thelton Henderson defended
the Administration, saying that he himself
"didn't feel too good about the number" of
minority students until he contacted other
schools comparable to Stanford.
Victor Vilaplana, chairman of the Chicano
Law Students Association, was considerably less
outspoken than Hayes in his comments on the
number.
"I'm generally pleased with the results," said
Vilaplana. "Although I would like more, I am
not tied to any particular number. I'd rather
have 20 who can do the work here, and do it
well, than a larger number who couldn't be
able to compete.'
Of the 19 minority students, eight are
Black, eight are Chicano, and eight are
American Indians. Figures on the number of
students of Oriental extraction were not
released.
