# Opera Season Looks Very Promising
## 
### GARY SCHMIDGALL 
What will probably be the most
successful opera season - "both
artistically and financially in the
S.F. Opera's history opened
September 11 and is now going
strong. This will also be the
longest season ever with 5 6
performances of 12 operas.
Certain of the operas are clearly
destined for success. The
season-opening, new production
of Massenet's Manon boasts in the
title role Beverly Sills, the only
current competition lor Joan
Sutherland these days, and
perhaps the best French-language
operatic tenor now singing,
Nicolai Gedda, as Des Grieux.
Another titillating prospect is
the first production in America
since Go d - k nows-w hen of

Donizetti's Maria Stuarda (how
opera composers loved the history
of English royalty!). The opera
has been in vogue in Europe, and
no less than two recordings are
said to be in preparation: one by
Sills and the other by this
production's Queen Mary, Joan
Sutherland.
Die Meistersinger
Wagner will be represented by
his only comedy and, I should
think, his greatest work: Die
Meistersinger.
The English Opera Group will
fly in to present the difficult but
thoroughly delightful operatic
version of A Midsummer Night's
Dream by Benjamin Britten.
The other English-language
item will be Tchaikovksy's Eugene
Onegin. Sets have been borrowed

from the Dortmund Opera House,
and costumes from the New York
Met. _
Female Omnivore
The season's "modern" entrant
will be Berg's tense,
blood-freezing tale about a female
omnivore, Lulu. Anja Silja, who
has made a big name in Europe
for her portrayal of erotic roles
(like Salome), is the Lulu. Also on
the more adventurous side is a
double-bill of Puccini's 11 tabarro
and Orff's Carmina Burana. To
my mind, this is the darkhorse hit
of the season.
Orff at his best can be
surpassed by no one in the
twentieth century, not even
Stravinsky, for sheer galvanic
excitement, and Carmina is his
best. SFO's production of it is
perhaps the most exhilirating in
its entire repertory. Puccini's
grand-guignol mood-piece gets a
new production and a
power-house cast of Leontyne
Price and Gabriel Bacquier (his
S.F. debut). II tabarro is, I think
the tautest, most evocative
musical drama Puccini ever wrote;
that it is so rarely done will
surprise those who see it.
Returning to main-traveled
roads, two examples of middle
Verdi will appear later in the

season with casts comprised of
great Verdian exponents. 11
trovatore brings Leontyne Price
back in one of her specialty roles;
and James King will attempt to
switch from his rather Teutonic
metier to take the tenor lead.
The Met's greatest current
Verdi soprano, Martina Arroyo,
makes her S.F. debut as Amelia in
Un ballo in maschera; and the
preminent young Italian tenor
Luciano Pavtotti will be the
ill-fated King.
The two remaining
productionsâ€”Madama Butterfly
and Der Rosenkavalier will be
thoroughly examined in a later
Daily review.
Ticket Availability
Sales for this season have
broken all records: 3/4 of the
house was sold before
single-tickets went on sale. And all
performances of Manon, Maria
Stuarda, and Price's 11 trovatore's
are already sold-out.
Meistersinger, Ballo, and the
double-bill may also become a
problem soon. If you want to buy
tickets, now is the hour.
Student Rush
Two possibilities for the

budget-minded remain. The first is
a new program of Student Hush
tickets, whereby all unsold tickets
will go for $3.50 starting axk hour
before each performance. Call the
ticket office (626-8345) for
schedule information and
availability of tickets. This
program may be most helpful for
the slow movers at the box office -
Lulu, Midsummer Night's Dream,
and Eugene Onegin.
Standing Room
Standing room in the orchestra
and balcony is available (at $3.00
per) whenever the house is
sold-out. Compared to European
houses, the hassle for standing
room at SKO is minimal: tickets
go on sale 2 hours before each
performance. Be there much
earlier for Manon, Maria Stuarda.
Radio Telecasts
Finally, the ultimate in budget
opera are the live, stereophonic
(for the first time in any opera
house) broadcasts of most of the
season's operas on station KKHI
on Friday evenings.
(This evening's performance of
"Die M e istersinger" will be
broadcast over KKHI, 1550 AM,
95.7 FM, beginning at 6:55 p.m.)
