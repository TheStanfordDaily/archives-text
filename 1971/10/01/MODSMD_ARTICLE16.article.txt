Music highlights the
entertainment schedule both
on-campus and off-campus on this
first weekend of the fall quarter.
Three movies and a Sunday jazz
concert fill out an extremely light
on-campus weekend program.
Tonight at 7 :30 and 9:30 p.m.
in Bishop Auditorium, Volunteers
in Asia presents The Seven
Samurai. Admission to the film
will be $ 1.
ASSU Sunday Flicks will show
Woodstock on Saturday and
Sunday nights at 5:50 and 9:10
p.m. in Memorial Auditorium.
Admission will be 75c and the
film will be open to the public.
Last year the Flicks incurred a
loss of over $4000 and Flicks
manager Bob Sisson says he hopes
a surplus can be raised this quarter
to wipe out the debt.
According to Sisson, "In the
past, many people have attempted
to gain admission to the Flicks
without obtaining a ticket.
Anyone who does this in 1971-72
is both delaying the time when
ticket prices can be reduced and
ripping off everyone else
attending the Flicks." Admission

to all other Flicks will be 50c.
Cool Hand Luke will be shown
by Stanford-in-Washington
tomorrow night at 7 and 9:30
p.m. in Cubberley Auditorium.

admission charge and proceeds
will go to scholarship funds being
raised by "Pamoja Na Nafase."
