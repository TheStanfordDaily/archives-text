# 'Alchemist' Opens
## 
### STEVEN UNGAR 
Perhaps to celebrate the arrival
of former Stanford president
Kenneth Pitzer as a professor of
chemistry at Cal, the Berkeley
Repertory Theater last week
opened its first production of the
season, an energetic but somewhat
disappointing rendition of Ben
Jonson's comedy, "The
Alchemist."
I say "strangely disappointing"
because "The Alchemist" has all
the ingredients necessary for a
successful comedy. The script has
been recognized as first-rate for
the last 370 years or so, the acting
is lively and the actors appealing,
and the show moves quickly with
no extended periods of tedium.
But somehow, Director Rod
Alexander has failed to discover
the Directors' Stone that would
turn this base metal into gold. All
the ingredients are there, but they
don't interact in such a way as to
make comedy. You went to laugh,
you feel you should laugh, you
decide to laugh, and then you
smile.
You smile quite a bit, as a
matter of fact. "The Alchemist" is
amusing. It's a shame it isn't
funny.
And I can't explain why it isn't
funny. If I could make plays
funny, I'd be something of an
alchemist myself. And I wouldn't
waste my time pecking out

reviews at Stanford University,
either.
Wait Awhile
It's quite possible that all "The
Alchemist" needs is time. I saw
the show on opening night, and
comedies are notorious for being
below par early in their run. For
that reason, I would recommend
that if you decide to see this
production, you wait a few weeks
until the cast has had a chance to
guage audience reaction and
perfect its timing.
"The Alchemist" concerns a
trio of swindlers who set out to
get rich by selling charms,
potions, and what—not to
whoever is stupid enough to pay
for them. The sometime-leader of
the three is Face, a housekeeper
who takes advantage of his
master's absence to give the use of
the house of Subtle, the
"alchemist," and Dol Common,
Subtle's female accomplice.
The various fools they manage
to cozzen represent the full
sßectrum of human greed, from
the simpleton who wants to break
the bank at blackjack (or the
Elizabethan equivalent), to the
glutton who wants the
Philosophers' Stone and is busy
buying up all the pewter in
London in anticipation of its
delivery.
The cast is semi-professional,
which is to say about half of the

actors carry Equity cards. It is
interesting that the Equity
members (including the three
leads) are easily the better actors.
Michael Leibert and Patricia
Bower make a handsomely
underhanded couple as Subtle and
Dol Common, although I found
Mr. Leibert a bit too harsh at
times. Miss Bower, who has seen
quite a bit of work off-Broadway
in New York, is delicious.
Charming
Robert Mooney, as the fat Sir
Mammon Epicure, comes close to
stealing the show, but he is
finessed (as is appropriate) by
David Coxwell as Face, who
dominates every scene in which he
appears, and manages to charm
the audience as readily as he
charms his victims.
"The Alchemist" is playing at
the Berkeley Repertory Theater,
College Avenue just south of
Ashby, in Berkeley through
November 13.

Ben Jonson's comedy "The Alchemist," mixes some brew for a
gullible customer. "The Alchemist" is being shown at the Berkeley
Repertory Theater.
