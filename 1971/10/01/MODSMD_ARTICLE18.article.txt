# Tribe Faces Crippled Devils
## Shockley Doubtful 
### 
The Indians completed their
heavy workouts yesterday in
preparation for the Duke game
tomorrow at 1:30 p.m. and it
appears as if they might be
without the services of Hillary
Shockley.
Shockley sprained his ankle in
the Oregon game and the coaches
might choose not to play him
against the Blue Devils. If so, Jim
Kehl will take Shockley's place
next to Jackie Brown in the
backfield. Both runners should
rack up impressive yardage against
an injury-ridden Duke front four
which will be made up of second
stringers and a converted
linebacker.
Passing Stymied
Stanford's passing game may
not enjoy the success it has had in
the past three games as Bunce and
his receivers will face a Duke
secondary that has picked off
eight passes in three games and
stymied the highly touted Florida
passing duo of John Reaves and
Carlos Alvarez.
The Indian secondary will
spend most of its time moving up
to help out on tackles unless the
Blue Devils significantly change

the pattern they have established
thus far this season. Duke
quarterback Dennis Satyshur has
passed only 23 times, completing
11 for 150 yards without an
interception.
Duke Will Run
It is fortunate that Duke is a
running team, because the
Stanford secondary has lost all its
depth due to injuries and could
use a rest. The latest injury came
last week to sophomore defensive
back Max Goldstein who injured
his knee in the Oregon game.
Goldstein was operated on
Wednesday and will be lost to the
team for the season.
Early in the week, the Indian
coaches were putting together a
game plan designed to stop Duke
fullback Jones who comprises
most of the Blue Devil offense.
Now it is uncertain whether
Coach Mike McGee will keep
running the ball with Bob Zwirko
and BiH Thompson, or open up a
passing game. It seems likely,
however, that McGee will stick
with a conservative style of play
designed to eliminate turnovers.
