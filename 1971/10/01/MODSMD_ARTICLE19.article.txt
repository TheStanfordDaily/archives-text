### CHARLIE HOFFMAN Commentary 
Earlier this week, it appeared as if the Duke-Stanford game would
be a truly great inter sectional battle. The Blue Devils were coming to
Palo Alto with a 3-0 record and a well deserved national ranking of
19 th. The nation's second leading rusher, Steve Jones, was to lead the
Duke offense in what promised to be a close and exciting game.
One senseless accident, however, has put an end to all speculation
concerning the outcome of the battle of the unbeatens. Jones, driving
Blue Devil quarterback Dennis Satyshur's car, allegedly blew a tire
while traveling on the mile and a half stretch of road between Duke's
two campuses last Tuesday night, causing the car to roll three times.
The car was destroyed, but Jones miraculously suffered only what has
been termed a ruptured sternum.
Fortunately for Duke, coach Mike McGee predicts that Jones will
be ready for the Blue Devil's crucial conference battle with Clemson
on October 9th. The star fullback who has racked up 469 yards in
three games this year will not face the Indians unless he is able to do
the punting.
There are many questions to be answered about the nature of
Jones' accident and injury, but the sad fact that he will not be able to
test his skills against the Indians is inescapable.
The importance of the game has been further reduced by the
possibility that none of Duke's defense front four will see action.
All-Conference defense end, Bruce Mills, broke his ankle against South
Carolina and his replacement is also sidelined with a leg injury. McGee
will probably move a linebacker up to the line to fill in.
Bob Zwirko will replace Jones, and although he is a fine runner, he
will not be able to carry the Blue Devil attack line his injured
predecessor. Since Duke has not attempted to establish a passing
game, it is hard to say where their offense is going to come from.
The Indians are now a solid. 15+ point favorite, and although the
Blue Devils will fight hard, it appears as if the Stanford players will
have to concern themselves with maintaining the right attitude for the
severe test they will receive at Washington next week.
