# New Program Aids Transfers In Adjustment To Stanford
## 
### TONY BOLLEN 
Every September, a horde of new
students swarms onto Stanford campus.
The largest segment of these—the
freshmen—receive plenty of attention
and aid. They're guaranteed housing
space, advisors, and lots of orientation.
But most of the rest of the new arrivals
are transfers from other schools, and,
traditionally, transfers are turned loose
to fend for themselves, standing last in
line for housing, classes, and money.
Thanks to a program begun last
spring, however, things may be looking
up this fall. The Transfer
Post-Registration Orientation Program
promises to make things at least a little
easier for a transfer student trying to
adjus to the Stanford environment.
This, coupled with the Dean of
Students Office's new efforts to locate
transfer housing, could finally make the
"plight of the transfer student" a
forgotten phenomenon.
The goal of post-registration
orientation is to pair up transfers with
old Stanford students of similar majors
and interests, hopefully on a one-to-one
basis. Organizers began recruiting last
spring and renewed the drive during
this week's registration days.
Chris Gray, one of two prime
movers of the project, said she was
"surprised at the turnout." About 170
established students have volunteered
to act as transfer "sponsors," and over
half of the transfers—about 260 of a

total of 425— indicated an interest in
the orientation plan.
Old students will be notified by mail
of the name of their transfer student,
and it will be the old student's
responsibility to contact the
to invite the
transfer to meals and campus activities.
Program Thought Unnecessary
Even though the notification has
begun, Chris Gray emphasized, more
volunteer students are
needed—particularly male students, as
well as students in political science and
pre-med.
Dan Evans, a sophomore transfer
from Cal Tech and a music major,
explained why he thought some
transfer students would not want to
take advantage of the orientation
program.
"The fact that students have
transferred indicates that they're
independent enough to know what
they want," he said. "What we really
want to know is what our options are,
what's available to us."
He added that he didn't really feel
the need to "be oriented."
But Chris Gray, herself a transfer
from USC a year ago, felt otherwise.
She pointed out that the orientation
program is not intended for transfer
students who don't want to be part of
it, and she indicated that such a
program would have been welcome
when she arrived here in the fall of
1970.

The orientation program wasn't the
only good news for new transfers,
however. According to Shirley Peppers,
Assistant to the Dean of Students, the
customary transfer housing crisis has
been avoided this year and "an
overwhelming majority" of transfers
have found living space.
Although exact housing figures are
not yet available, virtually all of the
425 new transfers are now housed, at
least temporarily, in the Stanford area.
The Dean's Office attributes this year's
brighter picture to a summertime
advertising campaign throughout the
community, as well as efforts by
students and administrators alike in
operating the Transfer Clearing House,
which opened in the Clubhouse on
September 11 and closed just before
registration.

ZONKED?—If he's an average Stanford student, he most assuredly is. More likely, however, he is one of the many transfer
students unable to find housing. To alleviate this and other problems transfer students face, Stanford has instituted a i.ew
Transfer Post-Orientation Program.
