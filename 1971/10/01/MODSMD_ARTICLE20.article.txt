# Harriers Begin Title Chase

### CHRIS COUNIHAN 
The Stanford Cross Country
team should look forward to a
high finish in the Pac-8 with six
returning lettermen. Besides four
other upperclassmen with varsity
experience, Coach Marshall Clark
has four freshmen who will
compete for a place among the
top seven.
A good example is top
returning letterman Arvid Kretz.
Kretz finished eighth in the Pac-8
chamionships last year and should
be the Cards' top runner. But lack
of summer conditioning has hurt
him. "He's not in real good
shape," says coach Clark.

Kretz will progress slowly and
may miss the first two meets. Two
other lettermen, senior Robert
Coe and junior Decker
Underwood have had injuries and
they too must be slowly returned
to top shape.
Kardong Gone
The loss of all-American Don
Kardong will hurt the Indians.
However, seniors Duncan
Mac Donald and Bernie Lahde will
be the anchormen of the squad.
Mac Donald finished ninth in the
Pac-B's last year. The other
returning lettermen is junior Brian
Mittelstaedt.

Two of the four top freshmen
Kurt Schoenrock and Mark
McConnell, will most likely break
into the ranks of the top seven.
The squad's first outside
competition starts Saturday at 10
a.m. against the Pacific Coast Club
and West Valley Track Club. Clark
stated that no points will be
recorded. "From this (meet) we'll
determine our actual freshman
and varsity teams. The first varsity
meet is against UCLA and USC at
Westwood on October lGth."
Tough Competition
The Indians' strongest
opponents will be national powers
Oregon and Washington State.
Oregon, whom Clark calls "a
talented group" and Villanova are
ranked 1-2 nationally. Clark sees
Stanford, UCLA, and Cal, as
competing for third place in the
Pac-8 but says the Indian squad
could beat out Washington State
"if we come around."


INDIANS WON'T GET THE CHANCEâ€”Stanford's defensive squad will not be able to try and trip up
Duke fullback Steve Jones as a South Carolina defender is doing in the picture above.
