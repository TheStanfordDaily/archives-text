Leslie Bacon's Arrest Warrant Killed
SAN FRANCISCO — A federal appeals court Thursday quashed the arrest warrant
for antiwar activist Leslie Bacon as a material witness in the government's
investigation of the March 1 bombing of the U.S. Capitol.
Acting on a habeas corpus petition, the 9 th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said
the government should have subpenaed her first, before seeking a warrant of
arrest.
Then she would have had the opportunity to decide whether or not to answer,
the 24-page opinion said.
Miss Bacon, 19, of Atherton, Calif., was arrested last April 2 7 in Washington,
D.C., and originally held on $1 00,000 bail as a material witness in the Capitol
bombing.
New Draft Quota Set
WASHINGTON — The Pentagon Thursday set a 1 0,000-man draft quota for the
next three months and indicated next year's inductions will level off at about
1 971 's nine-year record low of 98,000.
The first men to be inducted under the renewed draft likely will wear the
Army uniform in mid-October, the Defense Department said. These inductees
probably will be taken from among college and junior college graduates whose
deferments have expired. Selective Service officials have said nearly every
qualified man with lottery No. 125 or lower will be called.

the teachers to agree to end their walkout by 2 p.m. Friday or face contempt
citations.

disarmament side-agreements Thursday and pledged to pursue their efforts for a
