# Chaparral Publishes Again
## 
### 
The Chaparral, a humor publication of long standing at
Stanford, reappeared yesterday as a weekly news magazine
after a year and a half of erratic publication and difficulty
with finances.
Tina Swent, present editor of the Chaparral, says simply
that "there was a group who wanted a weekly magazine."
During the last academic year it appeared only three times.
"We felt that there were things going on at Stanford that
couldn't be covered well by the Daily," she adds.
As a second page article in yesterday's issue puts it, the
Chaparral's days as a "slick humor magazine" belong to the
past. New news magazine then, "The Chaparral delighted
the beer drinking audience with parodies, satire, and all too
frequently, sexist and racist jokes," the article adds.
Union Report
This week's lead story reveals the content of a
University report on Tresidder Memorial Union, apparently
requested by the Union's director. The Chaparral says in
addition that the report, prepared for the Internal Audit
Office, is quite critical of the Union's operation.
Swent says the material in future Chaparrals will be
mainly oriented towards issues involving Stanford. The
magazine might be more likely to print a description of
Stanford's involvement in Taiwan than a general piece on
American involvement in Asia, she added.

Besides the Tresidder article, the rest of the paper ranges
from a report on a SWOPSI course which describes the
mass media's attempts to follow environmental issues, to a
section entitled "Kultur" listing live entertainment and
movies in the area.
Local Guide
Other varied material may include a guide to local
restaurants, and the economics of auto repair and
insurance.
This year the Chaparral will survive mainly on its regular
advertising, which should support it on a weekly basis
throughout the year.
The "slick magazine" is definitely out the window,
however. The last issues of that sort were published during
the '68 -'69 academic year. Then Michael Sweeney, a former
Daily editor, brought the publication out of debt and used
it mostly as an arena for radical politics and hip culture.
In the spring of 1 970, when a large issue was published
condemning ROTC at Stanford, the magazine ran out of
money.
The magazine is published by the Chaparral chapter of
the Hammer and Coffin Society, founded at Stanford 65
years ago, which during its heyday had perhaps 30 chapters
throughout the country, similarly publishing humor
magazines. At present, the Chaparral is the Society's sole
remaining chapter.

As a second page article in yesterday's issue puts it, the
Chaparral's days as a "slick humor magazine" belong to the
past. New news magazine then, "The Chaparral delighted
the beer drinking audience with parodies, satire, and all too
frequently, sexist and racist jokes," the article adds.
Union Report
This week's lead story reveals the content of a
University report on Tresidder Memorial Union, apparently
requested by the Union's director. The Chaparral says in
addition that the report, prepared for the Internal Audit
Office, is quite critical of the Union's operation.
Swent says the material in future Chaparrals will be
mainly oriented towards issues involving Stanford. The
magazine might be more likely to print a description of
Stanford's involvement in Taiwan than a general piece on
American involvement in Asia, she added.

Besides the Tresidder article, the rest of the paper ranges
from a report on a SWOPSI course which describes the
mass media's attempts to follow environmental issues, to a
section entitled "Kultur" listing live entertainment and
movies in the area.
Local Guide
Other varied material may include a guide to local
restaurants, and the economics of auto repair and
insurance.
This year the Chaparral will survive mainly on its regular
advertising, which should support it on a weekly basis
throughout the year.
The "slick magazine" is definitely out the window,
however. The last issues of that sort were published during
the '68 -'69 academic year. Then Michael Sweeney, a former
Daily editor, brought the publication out of debt and used
it mostly as an arena for radical politics and hip culture.
In the spring of 1 970, when a large issue was published
condemning ROTC at Stanford, the magazine ran out of
money.
The magazine is published by the Chaparral chapter of
the Hammer and Coffin Society, founded at Stanford 65
years ago, which during its heyday had perhaps 30 chapters
throughout the country, similarly publishing humor
magazines. At present, the Chaparral is the Society's sole
remaining chapter.
