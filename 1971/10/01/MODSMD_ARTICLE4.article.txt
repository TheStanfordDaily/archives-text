# Franklin At Comp Center
## Photographers Testify 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
Prof. H. Bruce Franklin was shown
vigorously arguing with police officials
outside the Feb. 10 Computation
Center occupation in photos
introduced yesterday at his campus
dismissal hearing.
But under cross-examination by
Franklin, one of the photographers said
that during the confrontation the
Maoist professor was "presenting some
arguments about his right to be there as
a professor." Franklin is expected to
tell the Advisory Board he was entitled
to be on the scene as a faculty
observor.
Administration charges against
Franklin include encouraging the
occupation of the computer facility
and inciting resistance to a police
dispersal order. An occupation of the
center was ended by riot police after
several hours. Police then called the
crowd outside an illegal assembly and
swept through the demonstrators.
Most of yesterday's third session
before the Advisory Board of seven full
professors involved complicated
maneuvers to identify and keep track
of photos taken by University
photographers and placed in evidence
by the Administration's lawyers. There
were long delays as opposing lawyers
assigned numbers to photos and
debated the sequence in which the
photos were shot.
Boring For All
When the audience became restless,
Board Chairman Donald Kennedy
commented, "I understand the
temptation to talk during these things.
It's just as boring for us as it is for
you."
The long session did reveal the
prosecution's photo evidence of
Franklin's activities at the Computation
Center. University News Service
photographer Jose Mercado brought
pictures showing Franklin in the crowd
outside the Center before the order to
disperse. Under Franklin's questioning,
Mercado conceded, "There were a lot
of faculty observers around, too."

Mercado then showed photos of
Franklin in a heated debate with Santa
Clara Sheriffs Sgt. Donald Tamm after
the dispersal order. Mercado said
Franklin was shouting to be heard
above a bullhorn defending his presence
as a professor.
The photographer testified that
Franklin was arguing with Tamm but
that he did not hear or see Franklin
addressing the crowd or urging it to
resist the dispersal order.
The Great Escape
The only comic relief in the session
came when the suspended professor
asked Mercado if he saw what Franklin
did when police charged the
demonstrators. Mercado answered,
"That's something I've always
wondered, how you got away."
Although Mercado saw Franklin
commit no illegal acts, he said several
other demonstrators aimlessly hurled
rocks after the sweep.
Charles Painter was one of two other
photographers testifying. He said he
saw no illegal acts outside the
Computation Center before the sweep
but added that the atmosphere was
tense and "anybody could see or feel
that there could be violence."
Franklin's questions repeatedly
suggested that demonstrators had no
weapons while police were wearing riot
gear. One photographer, Richard Ray,
said he saw a woman carrying a rock at
one point but remembered no law
violations outside of the Computation
Center
At the beginning of the 5+ hour
session, Franklin repeated his claims
that the administration lawyers had
deliberately failed to supply the
defense with copies of tapes, film, and
other evidence it planned to introduce.
Prosecution attorney Raymond Fisher
insisted that any omissions were
"inadvertant" and caused by the
hearing's informal procedures.
Kennedy, chairman of the Biology
Department, told Franklin "I'm going
to tolerate no more charges of
duplicity."

Chief administration lawyer William
Norris announced that San Jose
television station KNTV has films of
the Computation Center disturbance
which it will only make available if
both sides agree.
Franklin said he would agree only if
an unedited version of the footage were
supplied along with similar footage
from two San Francisco television
stations. Franklin charged the films had
"mysteriously" disappeared when he
requested them at those stations. (An
official at one of the stations last night
told the Daily the film was "misplaced"
but "is now in the building.")
China Celebration
At the end of the session, Franklin
unsuccessfully requested the
cancellation of today's hearing because
of the 2 2 nd anniversary of the People's
Republic of China. Franklin told
reporters he and supporters "will
commemorate it appropriately" in the
courtroom.
The hearing room had already taken
on revolutionary decor yesterday. The
flag of Venceremos, the militant group
to which Franklin belongs, was hung
over the defense table. Pictures of
Marx, Stalin, Lenin, and Mao were
taped on Franklin's table in the campus
courtroom. Mao's portrait was on a
wall, as was a hand-lettered poster
announcing, "Since this trial began
1 ,437 Vietnamese civilians were killed
or wounded."
There were empty seats in Physics
101 throughout the session, and the
crowd never topped 8 0 persons. There
were only a few viewers in an
additional room receiving the hearing
on closed-circuit television, and the TV
broadcast may be discontinued.
Asked why the hearing was not
attracting a bigger audience, Franklin
said, "Who the hell is interested in a
case that isn't a case. It's a farce. Each
day (the prosecution's) own witnesses
testify that I wasn't doing anything."
Identification problems
Several of the prosecution witnesses
have had trouble identifying Franklin
or the clothes he was wearing. But
Norris insisted, "There are no
discrepancies of any consequence in the
testimony of those witnesses.
"We're confident that the Board will
not make up its mind until it hears all
of the evidence and the final arguments
tying the evidence together in a single
package."
An advertisement in yesterday's
Daily, signed by 18 professors, opposed
bringing "irrelevant references," such as
the Nuremberg Principle on war crimes,
into the case.
And, although sessions thus far have
been quiet and orderly, the professors
warned the hearings "may be subject to
attack and disruption."
One of those signing was Prof. Paul
Ehrlich, who said, "There has been too
much violence on campus, and I would
hate to see more." But he said he also
opposed institutional violence by the
University.
Concerning the hearing itself,
Ehrlich said, "It's almost impossible to
select a group of professors from any
university in America that would be
fairer."

hearing will be held today and
Saturday, 1 to 6 p.m.

crowd outside an illegal assembly and
swept through the demonstrators.
Most of yesterday's third session
before the Advisory Board of seven full
professors involved complicated
maneuvers to identify and keep track
of photos taken by University
photographers and placed in evidence
by the Administration's lawyers. There
were long delays as opposing lawyers
assigned numbers to photos and
debated the sequence in which the
photos were shot.
Boring For All
When the audience became restless,
Board Chairman Donald Kennedy
commented, "I understand the
temptation to talk during these things.
It's just as boring for us as it is for
you."
The long session did reveal the
prosecution's photo evidence of
Franklin's activities at the Computation
Center. University News Service
photographer Jose Mercado brought
pictures showing Franklin in the crowd
outside the Center before the order to
disperse. Under Franklin's questioning,
Mercado conceded, "There were a lot
of faculty observers around, too."

Mercado then showed photos of
Franklin in a heated debate with Santa
Clara Sheriffs Sgt. Donald Tamm after
the dispersal order. Mercado said
Franklin was shouting to be heard
above a bullhorn defending his presence
as a professor.
The photographer testified that
Franklin was arguing with Tamm but
that he did not hear or see Franklin
addressing the crowd or urging it to
resist the dispersal order.
The Great Escape
The only comic relief in the session
came when the suspended professor
asked Mercado if he saw what Franklin
did when police charged the
demonstrators. Mercado answered,
"That's something I've always
wondered, how you got away."
Although Mercado saw Franklin
commit no illegal acts, he said several
other demonstrators aimlessly hurled
rocks after the sweep.
Charles Painter was one of two other
photographers testifying. He said he
saw no illegal acts outside the
Computation Center before the sweep
but added that the atmosphere was
tense and "anybody could see or feel
that there could be violence."
Franklin's questions repeatedly
suggested that demonstrators had no
weapons while police were wearing riot
gear. One photographer, Richard Ray,
said he saw a woman carrying a rock at
one point but remembered no law
violations outside of the Computation
Center
At the beginning of the 5+ hour
session, Franklin repeated his claims
that the administration lawyers had
deliberately failed to supply the
defense with copies of tapes, film, and
other evidence it planned to introduce.
Prosecution attorney Raymond Fisher
insisted that any omissions were
"inadvertant" and caused by the
hearing's informal procedures.
Kennedy, chairman of the Biology
Department, told Franklin "I'm going
to tolerate no more charges of
duplicity."

Chief administration lawyer William
Norris announced that San Jose
television station KNTV has films of
the Computation Center disturbance
which it will only make available if
both sides agree.
Franklin said he would agree only if
an unedited version of the footage were
supplied along with similar footage
from two San Francisco television
stations. Franklin charged the films had
"mysteriously" disappeared when he
requested them at those stations. (An
official at one of the stations last night
told the Daily the film was "misplaced"
but "is now in the building.")
China Celebration
At the end of the session, Franklin
unsuccessfully requested the
cancellation of today's hearing because
of the 2 2 nd anniversary of the People's
Republic of China. Franklin told
reporters he and supporters "will
commemorate it appropriately" in the
courtroom.
The hearing room had already taken
on revolutionary decor yesterday. The
flag of Venceremos, the militant group
to which Franklin belongs, was hung
over the defense table. Pictures of
Marx, Stalin, Lenin, and Mao were
taped on Franklin's table in the campus
courtroom. Mao's portrait was on a
wall, as was a hand-lettered poster
announcing, "Since this trial began
1 ,437 Vietnamese civilians were killed
or wounded."
There were empty seats in Physics
101 throughout the session, and the
crowd never topped 8 0 persons. There
were only a few viewers in an
additional room receiving the hearing
on closed-circuit television, and the TV
broadcast may be discontinued.
Asked why the hearing was not
attracting a bigger audience, Franklin
said, "Who the hell is interested in a
case that isn't a case. It's a farce. Each
day (the prosecution's) own witnesses
testify that I wasn't doing anything."
Identification problems
Several of the prosecution witnesses
have had trouble identifying Franklin
or the clothes he was wearing. But
Norris insisted, "There are no
discrepancies of any consequence in the
testimony of those witnesses.
"We're confident that the Board will
not make up its mind until it hears all
of the evidence and the final arguments
tying the evidence together in a single
package."
An advertisement in yesterday's
Daily, signed by 18 professors, opposed
bringing "irrelevant references," such as
the Nuremberg Principle on war crimes,
into the case.
And, although sessions thus far have
been quiet and orderly, the professors
warned the hearings "may be subject to
attack and disruption."
One of those signing was Prof. Paul
Ehrlich, who said, "There has been too
much violence on campus, and I would
hate to see more." But he said he also
opposed institutional violence by the
University.
Concerning the hearing itself,
Ehrlich said, "It's almost impossible to
select a group of professors from any
university in America that would be
fairer."
Weekend sessions of the Franklin
hearing will be held today and
Saturday, 1 to 6 p.m.
Prof. H. Bruce Franklin was shown
vigorously arguing with police officials
outside the Feb. 10 Computation
Center occupation in photos
introduced yesterday at his campus
dismissal hearing.
But under cross-examination by
Franklin, one of the photographers said
that during the confrontation the
Maoist professor was "presenting some
arguments about his right to be there as
a professor." Franklin is expected to
tell the Advisory Board he was entitled
to be on the scene as a faculty
observor.
Administration charges against
Franklin include encouraging the
occupation of the computer facility
and inciting resistance to a police
dispersal order. An occupation of the
center was ended by riot police after
several hours. Police then called the
crowd outside an illegal assembly and
swept through the demonstrators.

Center. University News Service
photographer Jose Mercado brought
pictures showing Franklin in the crowd
outside the Center before the order to
disperse. Under Franklin's questioning,
Mercado conceded, "There were a lot
of faculty observers around, too."

Mercado then showed photos of
Franklin in a heated debate with Santa
Clara Sheriffs Sgt. Donald Tamm after
the dispersal order. Mercado said
Franklin was shouting to be heard
above a bullhorn defending his presence
as a professor.
The photographer testified that
Franklin was arguing with Tamm but
that he did not hear or see Franklin
addressing the crowd or urging it to
resist the dispersal order.
The Great Escape
The only comic relief in the session
came when the suspended professor
asked Mercado if he saw what Franklin
did when police charged the
demonstrators. Mercado answered,
"That's something I've always
wondered, how you got away."
Although Mercado saw Franklin
commit no illegal acts, he said several
other demonstrators aimlessly hurled
rocks after the sweep.
Charles Painter was one of two other
photographers testifying. He said he
saw no illegal acts outside the
Computation Center before the sweep
but added that the atmosphere was
tense and "anybody could see or feel
that there could be violence."
Franklin's questions repeatedly
suggested that demonstrators had no
weapons while police were wearing riot
gear. One photographer, Richard Ray,
said he saw a woman carrying a rock at
one point but remembered no law
violations outside of the Computation
Center
At the beginning of the 5+ hour
session, Franklin repeated his claims
that the administration lawyers had
deliberately failed to supply the
defense with copies of tapes, film, and
other evidence it planned to introduce.
Prosecution attorney Raymond Fisher
insisted that any omissions were
"inadvertant" and caused by the
hearing's informal procedures.
Kennedy, chairman of the Biology
Department, told Franklin "I'm going
to tolerate no more charges of
duplicity."

Chief administration lawyer William
Norris announced that San Jose
television station KNTV has films of
the Computation Center disturbance
which it will only make available if
both sides agree.
Franklin said he would agree only if
an unedited version of the footage were
supplied along with similar footage
from two San Francisco television
stations. Franklin charged the films had
"mysteriously" disappeared when he
requested them at those stations. (An
official at one of the stations last night
told the Daily the film was "misplaced"
but "is now in the building.")
China Celebration
At the end of the session, Franklin
unsuccessfully requested the
cancellation of today's hearing because
of the 2 2 nd anniversary of the People's
Republic of China. Franklin told
reporters he and supporters "will
commemorate it appropriately" in the
courtroom.
The hearing room had already taken
on revolutionary decor yesterday. The
flag of Venceremos, the militant group
to which Franklin belongs, was hung
over the defense table. Pictures of
Marx, Stalin, Lenin, and Mao were
taped on Franklin's table in the campus
courtroom. Mao's portrait was on a
wall, as was a hand-lettered poster
announcing, "Since this trial began
1 ,437 Vietnamese civilians were killed
or wounded."
There were empty seats in Physics
101 throughout the session, and the
crowd never topped 8 0 persons. There
were only a few viewers in an
additional room receiving the hearing
on closed-circuit television, and the TV
broadcast may be discontinued.
Asked why the hearing was not
attracting a bigger audience, Franklin
said, "Who the hell is interested in a
case that isn't a case. It's a farce. Each
day (the prosecution's) own witnesses
testify that I wasn't doing anything."
Identification problems
Several of the prosecution witnesses
have had trouble identifying Franklin
or the clothes he was wearing. But
Norris insisted, "There are no
discrepancies of any consequence in the
testimony of those witnesses.
"We're confident that the Board will
not make up its mind until it hears all
of the evidence and the final arguments
tying the evidence together in a single
package."
An advertisement in yesterday's
Daily, signed by 18 professors, opposed
bringing "irrelevant references," such as
the Nuremberg Principle on war crimes,
into the case.
And, although sessions thus far have
been quiet and orderly, the professors
warned the hearings "may be subject to
attack and disruption."
One of those signing was Prof. Paul
Ehrlich, who said, "There has been too
much violence on campus, and I would
hate to see more." But he said he also
opposed institutional violence by the
University.
Concerning the hearing itself,
Ehrlich said, "It's almost impossible to
select a group of professors from any
university in America that would be
fairer."
Weekend sessions of the Franklin
hearing will be held today and
Saturday, 1 to 6 p.m.
Prof. H. Bruce Franklin was shown
vigorously arguing with police officials
outside the Feb. 10 Computation
Center occupation in photos
introduced yesterday at his campus
dismissal hearing.
But under cross-examination by
Franklin, one of the photographers said
that during the confrontation the
Maoist professor was "presenting some
arguments about his right to be there as
a professor." Franklin is expected to
tell the Advisory Board he was entitled
to be on the scene as a faculty
observor.
Administration charges against
Franklin include encouraging the
occupation of the computer facility
and inciting resistance to a police
dispersal order. An occupation of the
center was ended by riot police after
several hours. Police then called the
crowd outside an illegal assembly and
swept through the demonstrators.
Most of yesterday's third session
before the Advisory Board of seven full
professors involved complicated
maneuvers to identify and keep track
of photos taken by University
photographers and placed in evidence
by the Administration's lawyers. There
were long delays as opposing lawyers
assigned numbers to photos and
debated the sequence in which the
photos were shot.
Boring For All
When the audience became restless,
Board Chairman Donald Kennedy
commented, "I understand the
temptation to talk during these things.
It's just as boring for us as it is for
you."
The long session did reveal the
prosecution's photo evidence of
Franklin's activities at the Computation
Center. University News Service
photographer Jose Mercado brought
pictures showing Franklin in the crowd
outside the Center before the order to
