## Self Defense Begins In The Auto Parts Store

The other day as I was
changing the headlight on my car
I had it demonstrated to me what
an insidious thing male
chauvinism is. But first—that's
right, I was changing the headlight
on my car. I had stupidly bashed
it out. Chauvinists would say
"woman driver" and throw up
their hands in dismay.
I say bullshit; men bash out
their headlights, too. Only when
they do it, they go right to the
parts store and pay around $3.00
for a new headlight and replace it
Women (married ones especially)
go to their man and ask him to do
it for them, thus laying another
chore on the male while not in the
least assuaging their own guilt
about the stupid thing they did.
or discovering that the world does
not end over a bashed headlight,
and that to repair it costs next to
nothing.
So, as I said, I was changing the
headlight on my car, and a male
mechanic from the auto parts
store breezed up to me with "Do
you know what you are doing?
and before I collected myselt

enough to assure him that I did
know what I was doing (next time
I'll try to be on top of the
situation with a quick refusal of
help), he had taken over my
screwdriver, my headlight, and the
whole operation.
I was steaming, raging inside at
the gall of that chauvinist to push
me aside from my little project
without a how-do-you-do. But did
I say anything? No. I had "sense"
enough to realize that anything I
would say would sound roughly
like "What the fuck do you think
you are doing? I jolly well know
how to change a stupid headlight
and I'll be damned if I need your
help. When I need help I'll ask for
it!"
This, 1 realized, would hurt the
feelings of the good Samaritan, so
I shut up. What a mistake. Here
my feelings were cut into pretty
severely by this chauvinist, who
felt not the least remorse about
cutting into my project—in fact,
he felt good about reinforcing my
dependency. And I shut up
because if I told him off, it would
have hurt his feelings.

Self defense, I'm beginning to
realize, begins at the gas station
and the auto parts store, and
every other place where men are
likely to insidiously put you down
by helping you. Sisters, we have
to learn to defend ourselves
against our own kind selves. We
spend too many hours up-tight
because we are afraid to or are
conditioned not to put men
up-tight. Every time you think "I
can't say that; it might hurt his
feelings" when your feelings are at
stake, you are telling the
chauvinists that they are right;
that women are not as important
as men. Every time you say "My
feelings are just as important as
his: even more important" you
are practicing self defense.
How to Change a Headlight
First thing to hold in mind is
that changing a headlight is not a
big deal. It involves one new
headlight ($3.00), four screws and
a plus—more or less, depending on
the type of car you have. That's
how it is on my old Volvo. When
you go to get a new headlight, you
will need to know if yours is a six

volt or twelve volt battery. The
parts man will be able to tell you
when you tell him the year and
type of car you have, but you will
feel more confident if you know
before hand. Your owners
manual in the glove compartment
will tell you.
A bashed out headlight
involves a lot of sharp glass;
caution is in order. There will be
an outer rim around the remnants
of the headlight; this will be
attached with one or more screws.

Unscrew it (them). Then pull this
off; lift up from where the screws
were and you will see where the
rim hooks on the car. Unhook it.
Put this rim somewhere safe and
use it to put the screws into.
There will be an inner rim actually
around the smashed headlight,
probably attached with three
screws. Unscrew them and put
them into the outer rim. Take off
the inner rim gently and avoid a
shower of glass.
The remnants of the headlight

will be plugged into a plug.
Unplug it without severing an
artery with the headlight. Get rid
of all the glass in the new empty
socket. Plug the new headlight
into the plug. Notice on the back
of the headlight there are three
glass bumps. These bumps fit into
three slots around the socket of
the headlight. Make sure the
headlight is right side up, or when
you flick on your high beams,
they will beam super low.
After you have fitted the

bumps into the slots, the inner
rim fits neatly around the new
headlight and you can screw the
three screws back in place. Then
all you have to do is hook the
outer rim in place and screw the
remaining screw in. That's all
there is to it. Next time your
particular male chauvinist goes
into hystrionics about a bashed-in
headlight, you can tell him that 1)
you'd rather fix it yourself,
anyhow, and 2) what's the big
deal about four screws?
