# let's make a deal
## The 						High Loss Of Trying 
### 
â–º Adam bennion & lee herzenberg

If you are accused of a crime,
whether you are guilty or
innocent you essentially have Vh
possibilities. You can either try
(1) to defend yourself and hope
you can convince a judge or jury
that you are innocent or (V2) you
can do what most people do in
such a situation, that is, talk to
the D.A. and see if he will let you
make a deal whereby you plead
guilty in return for a promise that
you'll get a lesser sentence.
To give a common scenario:
Suppose through a crazy set of
circumstances you are busted for
grass. Your lawyer goes to the
D.A. and after several conferences
comes back and recommends that
you make a deal and plead guilty

to a misdemeanor. Otherwise, he
says, the D.A. will try you for a
felony.
"But I'm innocent!" you
exclaim. "Well," your lawyer
answers, "You have a pretty good
case. If you want to try to beat
the rap, we can go to trial. But
what I must point out to you is
that you have to decide between a
sure $450 cost and no jail time if
you give up now versus $1000 for
my fee alone and a possible five
years if we go on but don't win."
Given these circumstances, is it
any wonder that 90% of criminal
cases never go to trial? Very few
people, even when they know
they are innocent, are willing to
take the risk of a long sentence in

the state penitentiary. And fewer
yet, even if they are willing to try
to prove their innocence, actually
have the money to do so.
Public defenders in some
counties do a creditable job, but
they are tremendously
overworked, and their incentive to
deal where possible is very high.
Acting as your own lawyer is a
very dangerous game.
What it all boils down to is that
if there is the flimsiest excuse to
bust you, the state can, if it wants
to, effectively fine you the cost of
your defense, and, if you arc not
wealthy enough to pay that cost
without hardship, probably force
you to plead guilty on a deal (in
the vernacular "cop a plea")'
This week we're seeing a little
of this here at Stanford. Associate
Professor Bruce Franklin is
appealing to the Advisory Board
to advise President Lyman not to
fire him. Franklin as a tenured
professor has the right to try to
defend himself in this way before
the University breaks his contract
(a privilege, by the way, not
afforded to those who simply
work here). However, the
University apparently has no
obligation to help with the legal
fees Franklin must of necessity
incur in the process of exercising
this right.
Stanford on its own behalf has
retained a high-powered Los
Angeles legal firm to act as
prosecutor. Two full-time lawyers
are active at the hearings, plus an
attorney serving as an aide, and at
least a part-time secretary. In
addition, Jamer Sienna, President
Lyman's legal advisor, a former
Washington heavy, is on the team.
Estimates for the cost of the
prosecution run $250 a day,
which is what a law commune
might charge to a more realistic
$1,000 a day which is what

lawyers from a classy firm like the
one being used might charge.
On top of that, a lawyer from
the Berkeley faculty has been
engaged as counsel for the
Advisory Board, to give the board
legal advice apart from what the
University lawyers provide. It isn't
quite clear who is paying his fees,
since we have been told that the
Advisory Board has no budget to
cover such an item. Presumably,
somehow the University will pay
him as well, which does raise some
questions.
When Lyman made charges
against Franklin, he offered no
deals. Franklin could either
request a hearing and defend
himself, or accept Lyman's
decision and leave. In effect,
though, the deal was offered years
ago, when the University made it
clear, by turning down (despite
the recommendation, without
dissent, of all full professors in his
department) a promotion for
Franklin, that they would just as
soon he left. At that time, had
Franklin moven, he would
probably have found it possible to
get another academic (or for that
matter non-academic) job, an
option fairly remote now if he is
openly fired as a result of these
charges.
But Franklin decided not to
yield to the pressure. Admirably,
whether viewed from a
revolutionary point of view or a
civil liberties point of view, he
decided to commit the academic
boo-boo of staying when the more
powerful forces in the University
would prefer he left. And further,
of continuing, in his own way (a
way which one may or may not
find appropriate), to stand up to
those forces and expose them for
what he feels them to be:
oppressive, dictatorial, bent on
creating a University, and indeed a
world where the only options
open to people will be shades of
one color (think 1968 and 1972).
The result of Franklin's
decision to stay is the "trial"
going on in Physics 101. Franklin
has been abrasive, challenging,
colorful, and unquestionably
intellectually creative. He has
made many friends and perhaps
many more enemies, even among
those who agree with the basics of
his political philosophy. But now
he is forced to bear the brunt of
defending himself, and through
himself all those who would
espouse unpopular ideas and
actions on this and other
campuses in the U.S. today: a job
he is doing for all of us, as a
protection against tomorrow
when suddenly we may find that
acting on our principles puts us at
odds with the people in power.
To start his defense, Franklin
engaged attorney Michael
Kennedy, from the firm which
defended Los Siete, but after
running up a $3,000 bill just for
pretrial activities, he announced
to the Daily that he could no
longer afford to retain the firm.
With a family to support and no
outside resources, a professor's
salary doesn't go far in paying
legal fees at current rates, which
puts Franklin essentially in the
same position as anyone else
forced to defend himself against a
well-backed legal network.
So far as we know, there is no
Franklin defense fund. Instead of
high-powered lawyers he will rely
on his own not inconsiderable
talents and the help of his wife,
Jane, and members of the
Stanford community who
volunteer to work on the defense
team, both with courtroom and
outside work. Nonetheless, it will
still cost money. It seems
somehow ironic that even if Bruce
wins at the hearing, and even if
Lyman accepts the Advisory
Board's favorable
recommendation, in the end he
will wind up "fined" at least a
quarter of his yearly salary.
