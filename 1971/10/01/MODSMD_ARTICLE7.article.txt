Editor, THE DAILY:
Again this year, as in years
past, we witness the hypocrisy
surrounding the distribution of
student football tickets. Of
particular concern to me is the
double standard upon which
tickets are sold, namely the
privilege given to married students
to purchase an additional set of
tickets at student discount rates.
Why must single students be
discriminated against? We pay the
same tuition, obtain the same
degrees, and have as great a need
and desire to take a guest to
watch a ballgame! There is no
basis for penalizing the single
student.
The Athletic Department may
cite other discriminatory practices
as precedents such as Federal and
State Income Tax Schedules,
housing priorities, and the fact
that other Universities have the
same policy. But these merely
serve to emphasize the hypocrisy
of the double standard. There is
also the often quoted sympathy
argument which goes something
like, "pity the poor struggling
married student with a family to
suppo.t . . ." Bull! Pity the poor
single student who does not have
a working wife to support him.
In this time of talk about
population pressure it is
incongruous to continue to
penalize the single individual. This
year I have violated the
"Fundamental Standard" in
protest of this policy and have
falsified the Athletic
Department's "Marriage
Certification" form. Therefore I
have been able to purchase an
additional set of tickets for the
games. This is dishonest, as are all
of the other means commonly
used by single students in coping
with this dilemma.
A more rational policy needs
to be inaugurated. If any students
are to have guest privileges, then
all students ought to have guest
privileges. The second set of
tickets should cost more than the
first but less than the normal
public price. This would make
possible the expansion of the
student section without loss of
revenue to the University. It
would also give every student the
prerogative of deciding if having a
guest sit next to him in the
student section was worth the
added cost.

When I was an undergraduate
and a football player at Stanford,
a constant source of annoyment
to me was the Stanford Daily's
blatant prejudice against the
football program and the
fraternity system. After three
years in the Navy, I return to find,
to my dismay, that things have
hardly changed.
Witness Fred Mann's article
entitled "New Status Brings New
Pressures" in Wednesday's Daily. I
would like to comment on a few
of the points mentioned in this
piece of writing. First, to my own
personal knowledge, no one has
ever been in the "doghouse" with
the football coaches for taking
advantage of Stanford's fine
overseas program. Along with two
other football players, Dave
Nelson and Dennis Heffley, I
attended Stanford-in-Britain in
1968, missing spring practice
before my senior season. We were
not greeted by any dismay when
we told Coach Ralston of our
plans, nor were we penalized
when we returned to practice in
the fall. I have known several
other athletes who went overseas
and heard no complaints from
them about unfair treatment upon
return.
Second, Mr. Mann quotes
several unflattering statements
from Tim McClure about the Delt
house, claiming that Tim was a
Delt himself. I know this fact to
be untrue becuase I attempted to
rush him for the Delt house, and
was very disappointed when he
joined Zeta Psi. He is certainly
entitled to his opinions about the
house, but when reading them one
should remember that they are
the views of an outsider and not a
member.
Finally, the author quotes Ron
Fujihawa, a former Delt, about
why coaches encourage athletes to
join the Delt house. Perhaps he
might have asked Ron why he
himself joined the house. He
would have discovered that it was
not because of its athletic
reputation, but because Ron
found the members of the house
the most congeniel of any living
group he visited. Ron himself is a
second year law student at
Stanford, so it would appear that
he managed to escape the
"stupidity and ignorance" of the '

Delt house. Another who
managed is John Sande, center on
last years Rose Bowl Squad, who
spurned pro football to attend
Harvard Law School.
I realize, of course, that there
are many people at Stanford who
couldn't care less about football
and who resent some of the
preferential treatment given
football players. They are
certainly entitled to their
opinions. Nevertheless, it would
seem only proper for them when
they write articles lambasting the
football program and the
fraternity system, to get their
facts straight and not deal in
haJf-truths and hyperbole.

Editor, THE DAILY:
It is perfectly clear that the
Advisory Board Hearing now in
progress will excite much
comment and debate. That is not
only unavoidable, but properly
conducted, can be useful to the
community. An early
contribution to the discussion,
called "A Faculty View on the
Franklin Hearings," signed by
Professor Clifford Barnett and
thirteen other members of the
faculty and distributed at
Registration does not meet the
standard required if we want the
debate to inform us all on the
facts and issues involved.
A minimum requirement
would seem to be that the facts of
the case be fairly stated before an
attempt is made to characterize
them or to argue the meaning and
weight that should be assigned to
them. In point of fact, "A Faculty
View" rests on a characterization
of the charges against Professor
Franklin that not only misstates

those charges but so trivializes
them as to make one wonder how
any serious person could ever have
entertained them in the first
place. That a number of serious
people take them very seriously,
indeed, seems to me to need no
argument.
In the interest, then, of trying
to keep the discussion
surrounding the case as close as
possible to an accurate statement
of the case, let me list the charges
against Professor Franklin as they
actually stand before the Advisory
Board. The specifics of the
charges are (all quotations are
from President Lyman's statement
of charges to the Advisory Board,
dated March 22,1971):
1. "Professor Franklin was in
the audience and knowingly and
intentionally participated in the
disruptive conduct (at the Lodge
speech of January 11, 1971)
significantly contributing thereby
to the disruption which prevented
Ambassador Lodge from speaking
and which forced the cancellation
of the program."
2 At noon on Feruary 10,
1971 at White Plaza, "Professor
Franklin intentionally urged and
incited students and other persons
present at the rally to .. . shut
down a University computer
facility known as the
Computation Center." Shortly
thereafter, the crowd moved to
the Computation Center,
occupied it and closed it down.
3. Later on that same day,
"Professor Franklin significantly
interfered with orderly dispersal
by intentionally urging and
inciting students and other
persons present at the
Computation Center to disregard
or disobey such orders to
disperse."
4. On the evening of February
10, 1971 at a rally at the Old
Union Courtyard, ". .. Professor
Franklin intentionally urged and

incited students and other persons
present to engage in conduct
calculated to disrupt activities of
the University and of members of
the University community and
which threatened injury to
individuals and property. Shortly
thereafter students and other
persons were assaulted by persons
present at the rally, and later that
evening other acts of violence
occurred."
Those are the charges. It is the
University's case that they add up
to "substantial and manifest
neglect of duty and a substantial
impairment of his performance of
his appropriate functions within
this University community . ..",
one of the bases on which
dismissal of a tenured member of
the faculty can rest. It should be
noticed that the charges are not
heckling Ambassador Lodge, or
simply participating in a protest
over a classified weapons research
project, or merely addressing a
rally in the Old Union courtyard.
Still less do they allege, as this
group of faculty would have it,
that Professor Franklin engaged in
legal, albeit unpopular, political
activities.
It does no service to the people
in this University to address the
issues of the case in caricature.
Let there be full and open
discussion of the issues, but let it
also be accurate and fair. That
should not be asking too much.

View" rests on a characterization
of the charges against Professor
Franklin that not only misstates

those charges but so trivializes
them as to make one wonder how
any serious person could ever have
entertained them in the first
place. That a number of serious
people take them very seriously,
indeed, seems to me to need no
argument.
In the interest, then, of trying
to keep the discussion
surrounding the case as close as
possible to an accurate statement
of the case, let me list the charges
against Professor Franklin as they
actually stand before the Advisory
Board. The specifics of the
charges are (all quotations are
from President Lyman's statement
of charges to the Advisory Board,
dated March 22,1971):
1. "Professor Franklin was in
the audience and knowingly and
intentionally participated in the
disruptive conduct (at the Lodge
speech of January 11, 1971)
significantly contributing thereby
to the disruption which prevented
Ambassador Lodge from speaking
and which forced the cancellation
of the program."
2 At noon on Feruary 10,
1971 at White Plaza, "Professor
Franklin intentionally urged and
incited students and other persons
present at the rally to .. . shut
down a University computer
facility known as the
Computation Center." Shortly
thereafter, the crowd moved to
the Computation Center,
occupied it and closed it down.
3. Later on that same day,
"Professor Franklin significantly
interfered with orderly dispersal
by intentionally urging and
inciting students and other
persons present at the
Computation Center to disregard
or disobey such orders to
disperse."
4. On the evening of February
10, 1971 at a rally at the Old
Union Courtyard, ". .. Professor
Franklin intentionally urged and

incited students and other persons
present to engage in conduct
calculated to disrupt activities of
the University and of members of
the University community and
which threatened injury to
individuals and property. Shortly
thereafter students and other
persons were assaulted by persons
present at the rally, and later that
evening other acts of violence
occurred."
Those are the charges. It is the
University's case that they add up
to "substantial and manifest
neglect of duty and a substantial
impairment of his performance of
his appropriate functions within
this University community . ..",
one of the bases on which
dismissal of a tenured member of
the faculty can rest. It should be
noticed that the charges are not
heckling Ambassador Lodge, or
simply participating in a protest
over a classified weapons research
project, or merely addressing a
rally in the Old Union courtyard.
Still less do they allege, as this
group of faculty would have it,
that Professor Franklin engaged in
legal, albeit unpopular, political
activities.
It does no service to the people
in this University to address the
issues of the case in caricature.
Let there be full and open
discussion of the issues, but let it
also be accurate and fair. That
should not be asking too much.

Again this year, as in years
past, we witness the hypocrisy
surrounding the distribution of
student football tickets. Of
particular concern to me is the
double standard upon which
tickets are sold, namely the
privilege given to married students
to purchase an additional set of
tickets at student discount rates.
Why must single students be
discriminated against? We pay the
same tuition, obtain the same
degrees, and have as great a need
and desire to take a guest to
watch a ballgame! There is no
basis for penalizing the single
student.
The Athletic Department may
cite other discriminatory practices
as precedents such as Federal and
State Income Tax Schedules,
housing priorities, and the fact
that other Universities have the
same policy. But these merely
serve to emphasize the hypocrisy
of the double standard. There is
also the often quoted sympathy
argument which goes something
like, "pity the poor struggling
married student with a family to
suppo.t . . ." Bull! Pity the poor
single student who does not have
a working wife to support him.
In this time of talk about
population pressure it is
incongruous to continue to
penalize the single individual. This
year I have violated the
"Fundamental Standard" in
protest of this policy and have
falsified the Athletic
Department's "Marriage
Certification" form. Therefore I
have been able to purchase an
additional set of tickets for the
games. This is dishonest, as are all
of the other means commonly
used by single students in coping
with this dilemma.
A more rational policy needs
to be inaugurated. If any students
are to have guest privileges, then
all students ought to have guest
privileges. The second set of
tickets should cost more than the
first but less than the normal
public price. This would make
possible the expansion of the
student section without loss of
revenue to the University. It
would also give every student the
prerogative of deciding if having a
guest sit next to him in the
student section was worth the

When I was an undergraduate
and a football player at Stanford,
a constant source of annoyment
to me was the Stanford Daily's
blatant prejudice against the
football program and the
fraternity system. After three
years in the Navy, I return to find,
to my dismay, that things have
hardly changed.
Witness Fred Mann's article
entitled "New Status Brings New
Pressures" in Wednesday's Daily. I
would like to comment on a few
of the points mentioned in this
piece of writing. First, to my own
personal knowledge, no one has
ever been in the "doghouse" with
the football coaches for taking
advantage of Stanford's fine
overseas program. Along with two
other football players, Dave
Nelson and Dennis Heffley, I
attended Stanford-in-Britain in
1968, missing spring practice
before my senior season. We were
not greeted by any dismay when
we told Coach Ralston of our
plans, nor were we penalized
when we returned to practice in
the fall. I have known several
other athletes who went overseas
and heard no complaints from
them about unfair treatment upon
return.
Second, Mr. Mann quotes
several unflattering statements
from Tim McClure about the Delt
house, claiming that Tim was a
Delt himself. I know this fact to
be untrue becuase I attempted to
rush him for the Delt house, and
was very disappointed when he
joined Zeta Psi. He is certainly
entitled to his opinions about the
house, but when reading them one
should remember that they are
the views of an outsider and not a
member.
Finally, the author quotes Ron
Fujihawa, a former Delt, about
why coaches encourage athletes to
join the Delt house. Perhaps he
might have asked Ron why he
himself joined the house. He
would have discovered that it was
not because of its athletic
reputation, but because Ron
found the members of the house
the most congeniel of any living
group he visited. Ron himself is a
second year law student at
Stanford, so it would appear that
he managed to escape the
"stupidity and ignorance" of the '

Delt house. Another who
managed is John Sande, center on
last years Rose Bowl Squad, who
spurned pro football to attend
Harvard Law School.
I realize, of course, that there
are many people at Stanford who
couldn't care less about football
and who resent some of the
preferential treatment given
football players. They are
certainly entitled to their
opinions. Nevertheless, it would
seem only proper for them when
they write articles lambasting the
football program and the
fraternity system, to get their
facts straight and not deal in
haJf-truths and hyperbole.

would like to comment on a few
of the points mentioned in this
piece of writing. First, to my own
personal knowledge, no one has
ever been in the "doghouse" with
the football coaches for taking
advantage of Stanford's fine
overseas program. Along with two
other football players, Dave
Nelson and Dennis Heffley, I
attended Stanford-in-Britain in
1968, missing spring practice
before my senior season. We were
not greeted by any dismay when
we told Coach Ralston of our
plans, nor were we penalized
when we returned to practice in
the fall. I have known several
other athletes who went overseas
and heard no complaints from
them about unfair treatment upon
return.
Second, Mr. Mann quotes
several unflattering statements
from Tim McClure about the Delt
house, claiming that Tim was a
Delt himself. I know this fact to
be untrue becuase I attempted to
rush him for the Delt house, and
was very disappointed when he
joined Zeta Psi. He is certainly
entitled to his opinions about the
house, but when reading them one
should remember that they are
the views of an outsider and not a
member.
Finally, the author quotes Ron
Fujihawa, a former Delt, about
why coaches encourage athletes to
join the Delt house. Perhaps he
might have asked Ron why he
himself joined the house. He
would have discovered that it was
not because of its athletic
reputation, but because Ron
found the members of the house
the most congeniel of any living
group he visited. Ron himself is a
second year law student at
Stanford, so it would appear that
he managed to escape the
"stupidity and ignorance" of the '

Delt house. Another who
managed is John Sande, center on
last years Rose Bowl Squad, who
spurned pro football to attend
Harvard Law School.
I realize, of course, that there
are many people at Stanford who
couldn't care less about football
and who resent some of the
preferential treatment given
football players. They are
certainly entitled to their
opinions. Nevertheless, it would
seem only proper for them when
they write articles lambasting the
football program and the

Editor, THE DAILY:
It is perfectly clear that the
Advisory Board Hearing now in
progress will excite much
comment and debate. That is not
only unavoidable, but properly
conducted, can be useful to the
community. An early
contribution to the discussion,
called "A Faculty View on the
Franklin Hearings," signed by
Professor Clifford Barnett and
thirteen other members of the
faculty and distributed at
Registration does not meet the
standard required if we want the
debate to inform us all on the
facts and issues involved.
A minimum requirement
would seem to be that the facts of
the case be fairly stated before an
attempt is made to characterize
them or to argue the meaning and
weight that should be assigned to
them. In point of fact, "A Faculty
View" rests on a characterization
of the charges against Professor
Franklin that not only misstates

those charges but so trivializes
them as to make one wonder how
any serious person could ever have
entertained them in the first
place. That a number of serious
people take them very seriously,
indeed, seems to me to need no
argument.
In the interest, then, of trying
to keep the discussion
surrounding the case as close as
possible to an accurate statement
of the case, let me list the charges
against Professor Franklin as they
actually stand before the Advisory
Board. The specifics of the
charges are (all quotations are
from President Lyman's statement
of charges to the Advisory Board,
dated March 22,1971):
1. "Professor Franklin was in
the audience and knowingly and
intentionally participated in the
disruptive conduct (at the Lodge
speech of January 11, 1971)
significantly contributing thereby
to the disruption which prevented
Ambassador Lodge from speaking
and which forced the cancellation
of the program."
2 At noon on Feruary 10,
1971 at White Plaza, "Professor
Franklin intentionally urged and
incited students and other persons
present at the rally to .. . shut
down a University computer
facility known as the
Computation Center." Shortly
thereafter, the crowd moved to
the Computation Center,
occupied it and closed it down.
3. Later on that same day,
"Professor Franklin significantly
interfered with orderly dispersal
by intentionally urging and
inciting students and other
persons present at the
Computation Center to disregard
or disobey such orders to
disperse."
4. On the evening of February
10, 1971 at a rally at the Old
Union Courtyard, ". .. Professor
Franklin intentionally urged and

incited students and other persons
present to engage in conduct
calculated to disrupt activities of
the University and of members of
the University community and
which threatened injury to
individuals and property. Shortly
thereafter students and other
persons were assaulted by persons
present at the rally, and later that
evening other acts of violence
occurred."
Those are the charges. It is the
University's case that they add up
to "substantial and manifest
neglect of duty and a substantial
impairment of his performance of
his appropriate functions within
this University community . ..",
one of the bases on which
dismissal of a tenured member of
the faculty can rest. It should be
noticed that the charges are not
heckling Ambassador Lodge, or
simply participating in a protest
over a classified weapons research
project, or merely addressing a
rally in the Old Union courtyard.
Still less do they allege, as this
group of faculty would have it,
that Professor Franklin engaged in
legal, albeit unpopular, political
activities.
It does no service to the people
in this University to address the
issues of the case in caricature.
Let there be full and open
discussion of the issues, but let it
also be accurate and fair. That
should not be asking too much.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Again this year, as in years
past, we witness the hypocrisy
surrounding the distribution of
student football tickets. Of
particular concern to me is the
double standard upon which
tickets are sold, namely the
privilege given to married students
to purchase an additional set of
tickets at student discount rates.
Why must single students be
discriminated against? We pay the
same tuition, obtain the same
degrees, and have as great a need
and desire to take a guest to
watch a ballgame! There is no
basis for penalizing the single
student.
The Athletic Department may
cite other discriminatory practices
as precedents such as Federal and
State Income Tax Schedules,
housing priorities, and the fact
that other Universities have the
same policy. But these merely
serve to emphasize the hypocrisy
of the double standard. There is
also the often quoted sympathy
argument which goes something
like, "pity the poor struggling
married student with a family to
suppo.t . . ." Bull! Pity the poor
single student who does not have
a working wife to support him.
In this time of talk about
population pressure it is
incongruous to continue to
penalize the single individual. This
year I have violated the
"Fundamental Standard" in
protest of this policy and have
falsified the Athletic
Department's "Marriage
Certification" form. Therefore I
have been able to purchase an
additional set of tickets for the
games. This is dishonest, as are all
of the other means commonly
used by single students in coping
with this dilemma.
A more rational policy needs
to be inaugurated. If any students
are to have guest privileges, then
all students ought to have guest
privileges. The second set of
tickets should cost more than the
first but less than the normal
public price. This would make
possible the expansion of the
student section without loss of
revenue to the University. It
would also give every student the
prerogative of deciding if having a
guest sit next to him in the
student section was worth the
added cost.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Again this year, as in years
past, we witness the hypocrisy
surrounding the distribution of
student football tickets. Of
particular concern to me is the
double standard upon which
tickets are sold, namely the
privilege given to married students
to purchase an additional set of
tickets at student discount rates.
Why must single students be
discriminated against? We pay the
same tuition, obtain the same
degrees, and have as great a need
and desire to take a guest to
watch a ballgame! There is no
basis for penalizing the single
student.
The Athletic Department may
cite other discriminatory practices
as precedents such as Federal and
State Income Tax Schedules,
housing priorities, and the fact
that other Universities have the
same policy. But these merely
serve to emphasize the hypocrisy
of the double standard. There is
also the often quoted sympathy
argument which goes something
like, "pity the poor struggling
married student with a family to
suppo.t . . ." Bull! Pity the poor
single student who does not have
a working wife to support him.
In this time of talk about
population pressure it is
incongruous to continue to
penalize the single individual. This
year I have violated the
"Fundamental Standard" in
protest of this policy and have
falsified the Athletic
Department's "Marriage
Certification" form. Therefore I
have been able to purchase an
additional set of tickets for the
games. This is dishonest, as are all
of the other means commonly
used by single students in coping
with this dilemma.
A more rational policy needs
to be inaugurated. If any students
are to have guest privileges, then
all students ought to have guest
privileges. The second set of
tickets should cost more than the
first but less than the normal
public price. This would make
possible the expansion of the
student section without loss of
revenue to the University. It
would also give every student the
prerogative of deciding if having a
guest sit next to him in the
student section was worth the
added cost.

When I was an undergraduate
and a football player at Stanford,
a constant source of annoyment
to me was the Stanford Daily's
blatant prejudice against the
football program and the
fraternity system. After three
years in the Navy, I return to find,
to my dismay, that things have
hardly changed.
Witness Fred Mann's article
entitled "New Status Brings New
Pressures" in Wednesday's Daily. I
would like to comment on a few
of the points mentioned in this
piece of writing. First, to my own
personal knowledge, no one has
ever been in the "doghouse" with
the football coaches for taking
advantage of Stanford's fine
overseas program. Along with two
other football players, Dave
Nelson and Dennis Heffley, I
attended Stanford-in-Britain in
1968, missing spring practice
before my senior season. We were
not greeted by any dismay when
we told Coach Ralston of our
plans, nor were we penalized
when we returned to practice in
the fall. I have known several
other athletes who went overseas
and heard no complaints from
them about unfair treatment upon
return.
Second, Mr. Mann quotes
several unflattering statements
from Tim McClure about the Delt
house, claiming that Tim was a
Delt himself. I know this fact to
be untrue becuase I attempted to
rush him for the Delt house, and
was very disappointed when he
joined Zeta Psi. He is certainly
entitled to his opinions about the
house, but when reading them one
should remember that they are
the views of an outsider and not a
member.
Finally, the author quotes Ron
Fujihawa, a former Delt, about
why coaches encourage athletes to
join the Delt house. Perhaps he
might have asked Ron why he
himself joined the house. He
would have discovered that it was
not because of its athletic
reputation, but because Ron
found the members of the house
the most congeniel of any living
group he visited. Ron himself is a
second year law student at
Stanford, so it would appear that
he managed to escape the
"stupidity and ignorance" of the '

Delt house. Another who
managed is John Sande, center on
last years Rose Bowl Squad, who
spurned pro football to attend
Harvard Law School.
I realize, of course, that there
are many people at Stanford who
couldn't care less about football
and who resent some of the
preferential treatment given
football players. They are
certainly entitled to their
opinions. Nevertheless, it would
seem only proper for them when
they write articles lambasting the
football program and the
fraternity system, to get their
facts straight and not deal in
haJf-truths and hyperbole.

Editor, THE DAILY:
It is perfectly clear that the
Advisory Board Hearing now in
progress will excite much
comment and debate. That is not
only unavoidable, but properly
conducted, can be useful to the
community. An early
contribution to the discussion,
called "A Faculty View on the
Franklin Hearings," signed by
Professor Clifford Barnett and
thirteen other members of the
faculty and distributed at
Registration does not meet the
standard required if we want the
debate to inform us all on the
facts and issues involved.
A minimum requirement
would seem to be that the facts of
the case be fairly stated before an
attempt is made to characterize
them or to argue the meaning and
weight that should be assigned to
them. In point of fact, "A Faculty
View" rests on a characterization
of the charges against Professor
Franklin that not only misstates

those charges but so trivializes
them as to make one wonder how
any serious person could ever have
entertained them in the first
place. That a number of serious
people take them very seriously,
indeed, seems to me to need no
argument.
In the interest, then, of trying
to keep the discussion
surrounding the case as close as
possible to an accurate statement
of the case, let me list the charges
against Professor Franklin as they
actually stand before the Advisory
Board. The specifics of the
charges are (all quotations are
from President Lyman's statement
of charges to the Advisory Board,
dated March 22,1971):
1. "Professor Franklin was in
the audience and knowingly and
intentionally participated in the
disruptive conduct (at the Lodge
speech of January 11, 1971)
significantly contributing thereby
to the disruption which prevented
Ambassador Lodge from speaking
and which forced the cancellation
of the program."
2 At noon on Feruary 10,
1971 at White Plaza, "Professor
Franklin intentionally urged and
incited students and other persons
present at the rally to .. . shut
down a University computer
facility known as the
Computation Center." Shortly
thereafter, the crowd moved to
the Computation Center,
occupied it and closed it down.
3. Later on that same day,
"Professor Franklin significantly
interfered with orderly dispersal
by intentionally urging and
inciting students and other
persons present at the
Computation Center to disregard
or disobey such orders to
disperse."
4. On the evening of February
10, 1971 at a rally at the Old
Union Courtyard, ". .. Professor
Franklin intentionally urged and

incited students and other persons
present to engage in conduct
calculated to disrupt activities of
the University and of members of
the University community and
which threatened injury to
individuals and property. Shortly
thereafter students and other
persons were assaulted by persons
present at the rally, and later that
evening other acts of violence
occurred."
Those are the charges. It is the
University's case that they add up
to "substantial and manifest
neglect of duty and a substantial
impairment of his performance of
his appropriate functions within
this University community . ..",
one of the bases on which
dismissal of a tenured member of
the faculty can rest. It should be
noticed that the charges are not
heckling Ambassador Lodge, or
simply participating in a protest
over a classified weapons research
project, or merely addressing a
rally in the Old Union courtyard.
Still less do they allege, as this
