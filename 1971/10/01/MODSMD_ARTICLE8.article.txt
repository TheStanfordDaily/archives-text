# Contraceptive Care & Sexism
## 
### 
When Cowell Student Health
Center gave in to pressure and
began to offer contraceptive
care to Stanford students,
many felt that medical sexism
was a thing of the past at the
Farm. Not so.
Women trying to find out
for the first time about
contraception were still told that
"the best method of
contraception is abstinence."
Women suffering from repeated
yeast infections (a side-effect of
the Fill) and afraid to change
to a less effective method of
contraception were handed a
large "pill", told to place it
firmly between their knees and
say "no."
While these may be clever
quips, they are not solutions to
the problems of young women
who are going to engage in
sexual intercourse and do not
want to become pregnant.
There is no care for
Stanford students who are
pregnant, whether they want to
continue with the pregnancy or

to terminate it. And last year
there was a $7.50 charge on
all PAP smears given for
contraceptive purposes at the
Health Center.
Recognizing this as a
discriminatory charge, individual
women and women's groups
protested to the Health Center,
in person and via the Stanford
Daily. Many women refused to
pay their bills or put them off
as long as possible.
This year there will be no
charge for the PAP smear at
Cowell Health Center. We
believe that this new policy is
a direct result of women
joining together to exert
pressure on the administration.
But we cannot allow
ourselves to sit back, content
in our victory. Discrimination
still exists at Cowell Health
Center. Stanford still has sexist
(and racist) hiring and
admissions policies. These
practices can and must be
ended. And we, as women
united, have the strength and

the power to see that they are
ended. Let the academic year
of 1971-72 be a year of
Sisterhood.
Together we will win!
