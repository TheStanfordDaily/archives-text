## A 						Gay Woman's Summer Vacation 
### 
It seemed somehow right that at the
beginning of the school year the Daily
should have an article on being gay. As 1
already wrote one about the traumas of
being a gay woman at Stanford, I thought
I'd write this one about traveling across the
country or, "how I spent my summer
vacation." Vacationing from school work,
and especially from thinking and talking
about being gay.
And too I was (and am) in love with the
woman I went across the country with. So
all in all the vacation was good. There was
a certain joy in driving into Illinois and
exchanging kisses, for there we are legal,
though our kiss surprised and perhaps
disgusted other motorists.
There is a certain joy in being legal that
a straight person can probably never know.
Just as they probably don't have the
paranoia we live with. Beaches are
romantic and lots of people embrace there,
but in some spots jail or a beating doesn't

seem worth while. Being illegal does funny
things to touch. Having breakfast at a
coffee shop in Kansas and careful, careful
to talk no gay stuff, quite conceivably we'd
be overheard, followed, and shown how to
be women.
So perhaps the silent peace of driving
into Illinois, Idaho, or Oregon where we
can still be hassled, but we're legal, can be
appreciated. Of course we recognized that
it is only in the last ten or so years a man
and a woman could express affection in
public without being considered sluts.
"I'll Still Be Here"
Or in one of the western states we
attended a county fair where almost every
child in the school had one of her or his
pieces of work on display. A thirteen year
old girl wrote a beautiful poem to another
girl that in essense said, "You may love
him now and ignore me, but remember I'm
your friend and I love you, and when he's
left you, I'll still be here." She may turn
out to be gay or straight, but almost
inevitably she will soon be persecuted for
such love, causing Ollie to say, "Poor baby,
the hell she's going to go through, and
what can we do." And once more we think
we've got to keep giving raps in hope
someone might curse their own love a little
less and grow to enjoy it.
Then too there are the joys of any
couple. Camping on a beautiful deserted
lake in Kansas, swimming and then
sleeping, only to discover why no one else
camped nearby. Ollie, who had never been
east, couldn't keep her eyes off the fireflies

that danced all night. So the next morning
I asked her if she'd had the measles and
it's the mosquito bites covering her face.
The next day we went and visited her niece
and nephews and though we had a really
good time playing catch and being family,
they did glace once or twice at Ollie's face.
One of the boys finally asked, "Ollie' have
you always had red freckles?"
Rolling On A French Machine
And my family too; the tension of
bringing home a lover is great for anyone,
and my whole family knows of our
relationship. My brother maintained his
distance for a while and then gave in. My
sister gave in too. Ollie showing her how to
roll cigarettes on her funny french machine
convinced her completely, even if she starts
smoking again. My mother and Ollie got
along best, as two aquarians can. If I hadn't
returned from Puerto Rico, they might still
be sitting at the kitchen table talking and
eating smoked salmon with hundreds of
pepsi's piled before them, each messier
than the other, and Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle
might have had to rescue them.
Once when waking I went into a panic
imagining that I'd have to speak again and
as always someone would ask, "What's the
difference in being gay?" and I couldn't
think of one answer. Except I love Ollie
and she loves me and somehow that's
supposed to be different.
But now, coming back I remember some
of the differences. Once more I can watch
people and their incredible ability to hate
themselves because they have the gift of

maud haimson

love and attraction. The deceptions, the
lies they must tell people to keep their
jobs. The gay person's self-conscious
training of self never to show emotion still
remains even after they are glad to be gay
and perhaps still ties part of the soul shut.
Am I the only one?
Now I remember what 1 had a slight
vacation from this summerâ€”my rage, gay
people's rage. When people are trained to
hate themselves and are continually put
down, it wears into a person's soul and the
rage itself can be terrible. Not only do we
have to deal with our own sense of
degradation but with our rage.
To make anger constructive is hard,
especially when people say, "Oh it's OK
you're gay," but if it came down to their
kids being gay they'd lay the same terrible
trips parents have laid for centuries. O.K.
I've got rage now. Me, 1 was seldom put
down and no one had damn well better try,
but I feel rage for the things coming down
on other people, I feel rage at the things
Ollie's had to take being gay in the 60's.
So once more I guess I'll do speaking at
the dorms for those who are interested.
Gay and straight, and those who aren't
sure. You may be straight, but maybe your
kids won't be, or you may fall in love with
a gay person of the opposite sex, or some
one of your own sex might fall in love with
you and maybe, maybe, you could be
gentle instead of people who say, "Hey
faggot or dyke, keep away." I want no
"'converts." I just know I'm happy being
able to love Ollie and I hope other people
might be happier in loving their Ollie's.
