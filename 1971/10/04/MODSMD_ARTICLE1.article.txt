# Proposal Rejected
## Athletics, PE Stay Wed 
### FRANK MILLER 
In a report released Thursday to the
Faculty Senate, the Committee on
Athletics and Physical Education
(CAPE) rejected for the present a
proposal to divide the Men's
Department of Physical Education and
Athletics into two separate
departments, as recommended by a
1969 report of the Study of Education
at Stanford (SES).
The SES report had recommended
that the Department of Athletics be
divided into two separate
departments—A Department of
Physical Education concerned with
internal athletic activities, and a
Department of Athletics concerned
with intercollegiate sports.
The Senate committee rejected this
recommendation "at the present time,"
reserving the right to recommend the
change later. But it did recommend
establishing a liason committee
between the Men's and Women's
Physical Education Departments to
encourage the sharing of facilities, and
teaching staff, the promotion of
co-educational sports and physical
activity courses, and the study of
possible increased opportunities for
women to participate in extramural
competitive sports.
SES recommended also that
"consideration be given to combining
the Men's and Women's Departments of
Physical Education into one
Department of Physical
Education . . . ."
Academics Overwhelmed
The report to the Faculty Senate
noted that SES felt that academically
oriented activities were overwhelmed
by the larger, more complex
intercollegiate programs and that an
autonomous unit under professional

academic direction would be more
effective in operating an internal
program.
But CAPE observed that "by West
coast and national standards Stanford
has a very good over-all athletic
program," citing the number of
students who participate in intramural
and club sports as well as those who
take physical education courses.
The CAPE report adds that "the
Men's PE portion of the budget of the
Athletic Department is approximately
$450,000 or 22 percent of the total
budget." Of this amount, $84 ,000 "is
provided from earnings by
intercollegiate and related activities."
The report praised "the able
direction" of Athletic Director Chuck
Taylor, noting the intercollegiate
program has generated greater income
than expenses over a period of the past
seven years.
Split Costs More
He also estimated that the added
costs of splitting the Department would
be from $25 ,000 to $75,000 per year
which includes the cost of adding 5 or
6 faculty members.
The committee concluded that
"because of the continuing
uncertainties about the future of
curricular physical education programs,
the efficient functioning of the current
men's and women's departments and
the estimation that insignificant savings
and possibly increased costs might
result from dividing the men's
department," it would not endorse
splitting the department at this time.
After rejecting the SES proposal, the
committee recommended establishing a
liaison committee to "have
responsibility for planning and
coordinating those phases of physical
education and athletics that are internal

to the University." Members of the
committee would include: the directors
of the Men's and Women's Departments
of Athletics, the head of the men's
Physical Education Program, the head
of the men's intramural program, and
several others.
In addition the committee
recommended maintaining and
strengthening the University's "already
very respectable internal athletic
program." Specific areas of need cited
for improved or expanded programs
include greater coeducational efforts at
all levels, more dynamic curricular
offerings . . .and increased
opportunities for faculty and staff
recreation including limited instruction.
The report also assigned a high
priority to the allocation of funds to
internal athletic programs to insure that
support will be maintained "at least at
current levels and increased as soon as
possible."

A DIFFERENCE?—AIthough there appears to be quite a difference between the athletic prowess of the varsity and that of
intramural teams, a faculty senate committee recently decided that the two teams were not so different that they should
become separate administrative units. The committee rejected a proposal to sever the intercollegiate sports program at
Stanford from the intramural and physical education program.
