## Self Defense Begins In The Driver's Seat

The car is a sex symbol—no
doubt about that, but the crucial
question in my mind is "who does
the driving?" It is one thing to
feel competent when you are by
yourself; the true test is when the
Man enters. Are you passive? Do
you defer to his superior driving
ability? Do you let him drive
when you are not in the mood?
Do you demand to drive when he
is not in the mood?
Most males assume that it is
their inalienable right to
drive—and too many women are
complacently co-opted into
passivity in the automobile. (We
were talking about the
automobile, although the same
comments might apply equally to
other places where men and
women meet).
Consider the following
scenario: he and she are walking
toward the car; without any
communication, he automatically
heads for the driver's seat and you
head for the passenger side.
Suddenly you flash back to the
day you got your driver's license:
Far out! Driving was a real trip,
right? All through high school you

drove whenever you possibly
could, and now you feel like
driving.
So you say to him, "I'd like to
drive," and he gives you this wierd
look. He agrees, of course; all
male chauvinists are gentlemen,
but with the agreement goes the
threat "Baby, if you grind my
gears, or if you don't pass just
when I would pass, or if you don't
run the yellow light exactly as I
would run it, then be prepared to
get put down for the rest of the
day."
Of course, this is not
verbalized; it's communicated by
the way he shrugs his shoulders,
gets out to let you slide over, and
says "Uh, sure, if you really want
to."
Don't fall for it. You say, "I
want to drive; it makes me feel
good, and if 1 don't do it the way
you do it, fuck you." When we
know what we want and go out
and get it, we are practicing self
defense. We are saying, "My self is
worth defending; he can take care
of his self."
But the question of who drives

goes beyond us asserting
ourselves. Male chauvinism is
more subtle than that. It becomes
a question of who expects to be
driven. As long as it is your
inalienable right to be treated
with kid gloves, it is also your
inalienable right to be put down.
Consider the second scenario:
It is late at night, like 3 a.m.
You've been to the city and now
it is time to drive home, half
stoned, fully wiped out. You and
he walk toward the car; you
automatically head for the
passenger side. He says, "I'm just
too beat to drive; can you do it?"
How do you feel? If you feel
angry or put upon, you are a
chauvinist dupe. That is, you are
covertly agreeing that he is more
adult, responsible and capable
than you are; if that is true, stop
reading any further. I assume that
you do not actually believe this.
You believe that you are just as
good as he is; you probably
secretly feel that you are a more
careful driver than he is anyway.
So either you are in better shape
than he is and you tell him so and

drive, or you are in no better
shape, and you both stay in the
city overnight.
Unfortunately, scenario
number two seldom arises in real
life, mainly because few men
would ever admit such a
weakness—but that is their
problem. Our problem is how we

respond to the hypothetical
situation.
Self defense gives rise to a
strong self, one which does not
demand pampering as a substitute
for adult communication. A
strong self does not need to be
driven, any more than a weak self
is able to drive.
