## Self Defense Begins In The Kitchen

The other day, I was cooking a
spaghetti dinner—but wait! Did
you hear that right? A guy, a man,
a male, cooking? A spaghetti
dinner? My God!
You see what an insidious
thing female jingoism is? I mean, I
just know all you females out
there sat bolt upright in your
chairs at the idea that one of us
could cook at all, let alone cook a
spaghetti dinner.
Most females, of course, just go
right out and buy some spaghetti,
some ground round, some tomato
sauce, and a bunch of other stuff.
On the other hand, males, if
they're married, ask their wives to
run down to the store and buy all
that for them. If they're not
married, they usually sit around
and make themselves violently ill
on peanut-butter sandwiches.
That is, unless they have
learned some self-defense. As I
was about to say, before I got
carried away by my analysis of
the sexual roles in our society, I
was cooking a spaghetti dinner the
other day when this female
walked into my kitchen and said,
"Hey, what the hell do you think
you're doing?" She then
proceeded to shove me roughly to
the floor and open up a can of my
tomato sauce.

Bewildered, I lay on the floor,
not knowing what to do or say. I
decided to remain silent, because I
didn't want to hurt her feelings.
What a mistake that was! I should
have said what I was thinking,
which was, "Why don't you get
out of here, you stupid bitch? I'm
perfectly capable of making my
own dinner. Now, get out, before
I shove this spaghetti strand up
your nose!"
Female Jingoist
But I didn't. I succumbed to
ths common male mistake of
considering her feelings, not
realizing that my feelings were as
important as hers, and probably
more so. After all, it was this
female jingoist who had
disregarded my feelings.
So I made myself a
peanut-butter sandwich and asked
her what year she was and what
classes she was taking. Forty-five
minutes later, I sat down to what
was probably the worst spaghetti
dinner I've had since I left Stern.
That broad didn't know her
ground round from her bay leaf.
That night, I became violently ill.
Well, brothers, I learned my
lesson then, and I'm now going to
pass the fruits of my learning on
to you. Cooking a spaghetti
dinner is no problem, and it's
really fun.
Female Thing?
To start, get a large frying pan.
,Grasp it firmly by the handle
(now you see why cooking is a
female thing) and place it directly
in front of you on the stove. For
four hungry brothers you'll need

about a pound of hamburger
meat. Get the more expensive
kind if you don't want greasy
spaghetti sauce. Otherwise, be
prepared to pour off most of the
grease when the meat is browned.
Break the meat into small
pieces in the pan. Turn on the
heat. The hamburger will become
warm and change color, from red
to brown. Don't panic. Let the
meat brown, seasoning it with
Lawry's seasoned salt if you like
spicy food, or just plain salt.
When the meat is brown, add a (
16-ounce can of stewed tomatoes
and an 8-ounce can of tomato
sauce, and an equivalent amount
of water.
Dope Look Alike
Next, chop up about a handful
of onions and put them in. Then,
add whatever spices you think
would taste good. I usually put in
some garlic salt, some more
seasoned salt, seasoned pepper, a
little sage, a little oregano (that's
the stuff dope looks like), and
two bay leaves. All these spices
are inexpensive and can be bought
at any store.
Cover the pan and let the sauce
cook for about forty-five minutes;
you can cut it down to thirty if
you're in a rush. Check it
periodically to make sure the
water hasn't boiled out. You'll

have to add water from time to
time.
Now comes the fun part. While
you're waiting for the sauce to
cook, you can throw darts at
pictures of Peg Bracken and stick
pins in Julia Child dolls. Doing
this sort of thing makes you feel
good inside, and, besides, it strikes
a blow against female jingoism.
The Crucial Part
About fifteen minutes before
you're ready to eat, you'll want to
start cooking the spaghetti itself.
Bring lightly salted water to a boil
in a large pot. You'll know when
the water is boiling when bubbles
appear on the surface. Take about
a pound of spaghetti and put it in
the boiling water. This is the
crucial part of the meal. The only
thing worse than undercooked
spaghetti is overcooked spaghetti
(this, by the way, was what was

wrong with this jingoist's stuff. It
tasted like the library paste I used
to eat when I was in
kindergarten). There's no real
definite rule about how long to
cook it. Fifteen minutes is about
right. The spaghetti shouldn't be
tough or stick together.
Now all you have to do is dish
out the spaghetti and put the
meat sauce over it. Serve it with
French bread and a salad, and
you've got as much as you can eat
for less than 50c per serving. Best
of all, you don't feel obligated to
any stupid female, though you
might try to get one to do the
dishes.
