# Lyman Says U.S. Phasing Out Fellowships For Grad Students
## 
### 
"The great structure of federal
support for graduate students is
being dismantled in haste and
with a degree of thoughtlessness
and heartlessness that is no credit
to the nation," President Lyman
said in an address to a meeting of
the Academic Council in
Dinkelspiel Friday.
Lyman noted that Stanford
had 225 National Defense
Education Act (NEDA)
fellowships in 1968-1969, and
that there are 111 now, with no
new grants starting after this fall.
National Science Foundation, and

National Institutes of Health
fellowships are also being phased
out, he said.
The sparsely attended session,
at which there was no quorum,
heard Lyman speak against
legislation pending before
Congress which would provide for
institutional block grants, rather
than the present system of
individually funding projects
regardless of institution.
"We have steadily argued for
programs that would give the aid
directly to the student. He or she
would then choose the institution

best suited to his or her needs and
go there, bringing along a cost of
education allowance that would
help the institution bear the costs
of educating that particular
student," Lyman added.
Newly appointed Vice
President for Business and
Finance Robert Augsberger also
addressed the Council, speaking of
his hopes for improving the
University financial situation in
the future.

LAKK LAG AT LAST?- No, freshmen, if you run over to Lake Lag right now, this soggy sight is not what
you will see. Lake Lag will not be in full splendor until you return from Christmas vacation, sometime at
the end of December. However, if you become really desperate, pick up your best pair of trunks and
goggles around the end of November, head for the Lake Lag imported beach, and with a lot of luck, and
rain, you might be able to get your feet muddy.
