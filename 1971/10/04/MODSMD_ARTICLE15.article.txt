# Mem Aud Madness
## Viewer Participation Excels 
### Jerry Coleman 
Imagine yourself seated in a
darkened movie theater,
enjoying an action-packed
motion picture. Suddenly, a
heavy rope falls out of the air
above you, its end dangling
awkwardly in your lap.
Annoyed and a little
unsettled, you look up 30 feet
to the roof, and what do you
see? This rope in your lap runs
all the way up to where a
skylight is supposed to be, but
which now appears as a square,
black hole.
Even more bizarre, a
shadowy figure can dimly be
perceived shinnying down the
rope. You stand up to get a
better view and at that
moment, a man in dark clothes
drops the last few feet from
the rope into your seat,
crouches, and scurries away.
Muffled shouts of, "sit
down!" come from the people
seated in the row behind you,
totally oblivious to anything
but the movie. As you start to
sit down, a second air-man
drops into your seat, and then
a third, the latter remaining
seated there and calmly
watching the movie.
Down in Front
More shouts of, "down in
front!" make it plain that you
had better act fast. You finally
persuade the third man to
leave your seat and at last you
sit down and begin to relax.
Only the heavy rope swinging
back and forth 2 inches from
your nose prevents you from
fully enjoying the movie.
Could this situation ever
happen to you? Of course not.
The whole idea is absurd. Did
this ever really happen? Yes!
Yes??! Incredible as it seems,
the above far-fetched story did
occur in our very own
Memorial Auditorium during

the Sunday Flicks. The entire
incident was told to me by
one Bob Harbaugh of Toyon
Hall, a man, I might add,
whose word is as reliable as a
stuffed zucchini.
Yet the story of the Sunday
Flicks does not record this
rooftop romp as an isolated
episode. Numerous attempts
have been made to avoid
paying the outrageous admission
price of 50<\
People have scaled sheer
walls along the West (KZSU)
side of Mem Aud, have flung
themselves into tiny garret
windows on the second floor,
and have even hidden, crouched
for hours at a time, in the
scaffolding above the stageâ€”all
just to be able to say, "I've
gotten into the Flicks free!"
Commandos Strike
One of the most pitiful
attempts that I've witnessed
was made by two students
outside the main floor side
exit. These would-be
commandos stuck a piece of
paper through the crack

between door and frame and
proceeded to wave it up and
down in rapid, fluttering
motions.
They apparently hoped
someone sitting nearby would
rush to their aid by opening
the door from the inside. As it
happened, an usher tiptoed
along the wall to the door,
moved his hand in a parallel
motion and, timing his action,
lunged forward, grabbing the
paper. The audience cheered as
repeated similar attempts by
this inept pair to gain entry
were foiled again and again.
Yet such Mem Aud Madness
is not limited to getting in the
auditorium. Once inside, the
real fun begins, as thousands of
tiny paper airplanes sail from
the balcony.
Projectiles Hurled
Their flight mission: hit the
stage! Any that do receive
much applause. This reporter
has not only witnessed, but
participated in the launching of
one of the most formidible
armadas in Sunday Flicks'

history: 12 giant paper planes,
one 10 foot balsa and paper
construction. 30 whirly things,
18 plastic zoom jets, and a
windup, rubberband powered
plane that left a twenty foot
shadow on the screen before
crashing into the wall.
Should you be unfortunate
enough to miss the entire
pre-movie show, don't despair!
Ad-libbed comments from the
audience help perk up any dull
movie. (Most of the comments
come from the balcony, and
tend to get more gross as one
moves further back the
balcony.)
So make your night out at
the Sunday Flicks a real
happening! Run down to the
corner of Galvez and Serra this
Sunday and get caught up in
Mem Aud Madness.
(Unfortunately with those
directions, you 11 end up about
50 yards east of Memorial
Auditorium, but "Dodge the
Car" is also a fun game and
guaranteed to keep you
occupied.)
