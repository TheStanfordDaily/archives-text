# Best Of The Summer Films
## 
### TODD McCARTHY First in a two-part series 
In the Sunday New York
Times a couple of weeks back,
John Simon went on with another
of his screaming diatribes, this
time about how virtually all this
summer's films have been terrible,
pretentious, or, more to the point,
terribly pretentious.
Never have 1 responded so
vehemently to Simon (I even
wrote a letter to the Times), for it
is this sort of across-the-board
panning that has traditionally
earned critics reputations for
seriousness and toughness, hence,
"honesty."
Surprisingly, not only did I
object to Simon's critical
approach but I disagreed with him
as well.
Perhaps partially as a reaction
to Simon's surpassingly depressing
pioce, I, feel like writing a
laudatory' article concentrating on
the best films of the past few

months and will quite willingly
risk being called an "easy" critic
by the likes of the frigid Simon,
impossible (or unwilling) to be
satisfied. If time and space permit,
I'll get to the bilge later.
"McCabe and Mrs. Miller" is by
all counts the best American film
since "Bonnie and Clyde" or "The
Wild Bunch" or "Little Big Man"
or whatever other film you last
thought was great. Despite, or
perhaps because of the strenuous
efforts for increased Western
realism, the mythic proportions of
the film are vast and increase with
distance.
Indeed, it is amazing how
moving the film turns out to be,
for director Robert Altman
distances the audience
considerably at the outset through
the use of heavy filters, whispered
and murmured overlapping
dialogue which often is uttered by
off-screen characters and not
showing much of the vital action
(especially between McCabe and

Mrs. Miller themselves), thus often
forcing the audience to account
for exactly what is happening.
In the end, every thing is
accounted for, even if it doesn"
seem like it, and McCabe manages
to silently accomplish enough
before he dies lyrically in the
snow to adorn his loser status
with genuine American mythic
contours. Perhaps the leap isn't all
that great at that, but the quality
of endearment is important and
McCabe, with all his bumbling,
bluffing and uncertainty beneath
the guise of total assuredness, has
that in abundance. It's Warren
Beatty's best performance yet,
mainly because he now has
enough physical prowess (as an
actor) before he dies lyrically
in the snow to adorn his loser
status with genuine American
mythic contours. Perhaps the leap
isn't all that great at that, but the
quality of endearment is
important and McCabe, with all
his bumbling, bluffing and
uncertainty beneath the guise of
total assuredness, has that in
abundance. It's Warren Beatty's
best performance yet, mainly
because he now has enough
physical prowess (as an actor) to
be able to reverse himself.
Actually, "McCabe and Mrs.
Miller" comes very close to the
spirit of "Shoot the Piano
Player," that film 1 love so much.
In terms of basic plot outline,
both adhere strictly to the formal
demands of their genres, the
western and gangster dramas
respectively, so are satisfying on
the story level. Both have
retreating, malleable heroes who
nonetheless perform when they
must even if action will result in
their own physical or moral
destruction, both have doomed,
tentative romances and both end
with a shoot-out (and, as lyricism
would have it, in the snow).
At the same time, both films
take great and skillful liberties
with the spirits of the genres,
which ultimately leads to their
increased humanity. Altman, like
Truffaut, has loaded his film with
memorable vignettes, such as the
drunk dancing on ice, the young
kid who visits every woman in
Mrs. Miller's bordello and
McCabe's standard dinner of

Whiskey Julius, a double shot
with a raw egg.
As usual, Altman's
ever-growing gallery of faces is
impressive, especially the Bordello
Kid (Keith Carradine), the giant
mercenary and the baby-faced
killer. With "McCabe anil Mrs.
Miller," Altman has carried his
"M*A*S*H" techniques in
ensemble playing and overlapping
sound to the /?th degree, while
immeasurably increasing his visual
and story sense, and it will be
interesting to see where he goes
from here.

earned critics reputations for
seriousness and toughness, hence,
"honesty."
Surprisingly, not only did I
object to Simon's critical
approach but I disagreed with him
as well.
Perhaps partially as a reaction
to Simon's surpassingly depressing
pioce, I, feel like writing a
laudatory' article concentrating on
the best films of the past few

months and will quite willingly
risk being called an "easy" critic
by the likes of the frigid Simon,
impossible (or unwilling) to be
satisfied. If time and space permit,
I'll get to the bilge later.
"McCabe and Mrs. Miller" is by
all counts the best American film
since "Bonnie and Clyde" or "The
Wild Bunch" or "Little Big Man"
or whatever other film you last
thought was great. Despite, or
perhaps because of the strenuous
efforts for increased Western
realism, the mythic proportions of
the film are vast and increase with
distance.
Indeed, it is amazing how
moving the film turns out to be,
for director Robert Altman
distances the audience
considerably at the outset through
the use of heavy filters, whispered
and murmured overlapping
dialogue which often is uttered by
off-screen characters and not
showing much of the vital action
(especially between McCabe and

Mrs. Miller themselves), thus often
forcing the audience to account
for exactly what is happening.
In the end, every thing is
accounted for, even if it doesn"
seem like it, and McCabe manages
to silently accomplish enough
before he dies lyrically in the
snow to adorn his loser status
with genuine American mythic
contours. Perhaps the leap isn't all
that great at that, but the quality
of endearment is important and
McCabe, with all his bumbling,
bluffing and uncertainty beneath
the guise of total assuredness, has
that in abundance. It's Warren
Beatty's best performance yet,
mainly because he now has
enough physical prowess (as an
actor) before he dies lyrically
in the snow to adorn his loser
status with genuine American
mythic contours. Perhaps the leap
isn't all that great at that, but the
quality of endearment is
important and McCabe, with all
his bumbling, bluffing and
uncertainty beneath the guise of
total assuredness, has that in
abundance. It's Warren Beatty's
best performance yet, mainly
because he now has enough
physical prowess (as an actor) to
be able to reverse himself.
Actually, "McCabe and Mrs.
Miller" comes very close to the
spirit of "Shoot the Piano
Player," that film 1 love so much.
In terms of basic plot outline,
both adhere strictly to the formal
demands of their genres, the
western and gangster dramas
respectively, so are satisfying on
the story level. Both have
retreating, malleable heroes who
nonetheless perform when they
must even if action will result in
their own physical or moral
destruction, both have doomed,
tentative romances and both end
with a shoot-out (and, as lyricism
would have it, in the snow).
At the same time, both films
take great and skillful liberties
with the spirits of the genres,
which ultimately leads to their
increased humanity. Altman, like
Truffaut, has loaded his film with
memorable vignettes, such as the
drunk dancing on ice, the young
kid who visits every woman in
Mrs. Miller's bordello and
McCabe's standard dinner of

Whiskey Julius, a double shot
with a raw egg.
As usual, Altman's
ever-growing gallery of faces is
impressive, especially the Bordello
Kid (Keith Carradine), the giant
mercenary and the baby-faced
killer. With "McCabe anil Mrs.
Miller," Altman has carried his
"M*A*S*H" techniques in
ensemble playing and overlapping
sound to the /?th degree, while
immeasurably increasing his visual
and story sense, and it will be
interesting to see where he goes
from here.

SWEATHOG—One of the groups in a show last weekend at San Francisco's Winterland Arena was
Sweathog, featuring drummer Bartholomew Smith-Frost, who formerly played with Lee Michaels. Black

impossible (or unwilling) to be
satisfied. If time and space permit,
I'll get to the bilge later.
"McCabe and Mrs. Miller" is by
all counts the best American film
since "Bonnie and Clyde" or "The
Wild Bunch" or "Little Big Man"
or whatever other film you last
thought was great. Despite, or
perhaps because of the strenuous
efforts for increased Western
realism, the mythic proportions of
the film are vast and increase with
distance.
Indeed, it is amazing how
moving the film turns out to be,
for director Robert Altman
distances the audience
considerably at the outset through
the use of heavy filters, whispered
and murmured overlapping
dialogue which often is uttered by
off-screen characters and not
showing much of the vital action
(especially between McCabe and

Mrs. Miller themselves), thus often
forcing the audience to account
for exactly what is happening.
In the end, every thing is
accounted for, even if it doesn"
seem like it, and McCabe manages
to silently accomplish enough
before he dies lyrically in the
snow to adorn his loser status
with genuine American mythic
contours. Perhaps the leap isn't all
that great at that, but the quality
of endearment is important and
McCabe, with all his bumbling,
bluffing and uncertainty beneath
the guise of total assuredness, has
that in abundance. It's Warren
Beatty's best performance yet,
mainly because he now has
enough physical prowess (as an
actor) before he dies lyrically
in the snow to adorn his loser
status with genuine American
mythic contours. Perhaps the leap
isn't all that great at that, but the
quality of endearment is
important and McCabe, with all
his bumbling, bluffing and
uncertainty beneath the guise of
total assuredness, has that in
abundance. It's Warren Beatty's
best performance yet, mainly
because he now has enough
physical prowess (as an actor) to
be able to reverse himself.
Actually, "McCabe and Mrs.
Miller" comes very close to the
spirit of "Shoot the Piano
Player," that film 1 love so much.
In terms of basic plot outline,
both adhere strictly to the formal
demands of their genres, the
western and gangster dramas
respectively, so are satisfying on
the story level. Both have
retreating, malleable heroes who
nonetheless perform when they
must even if action will result in
their own physical or moral
destruction, both have doomed,
tentative romances and both end
with a shoot-out (and, as lyricism
would have it, in the snow).
At the same time, both films
take great and skillful liberties
with the spirits of the genres,
which ultimately leads to their
increased humanity. Altman, like
Truffaut, has loaded his film with
memorable vignettes, such as the
drunk dancing on ice, the young
kid who visits every woman in
Mrs. Miller's bordello and
McCabe's standard dinner of

Whiskey Julius, a double shot
with a raw egg.
As usual, Altman's
ever-growing gallery of faces is
impressive, especially the Bordello
Kid (Keith Carradine), the giant
mercenary and the baby-faced
killer. With "McCabe anil Mrs.
Miller," Altman has carried his
"M*A*S*H" techniques in
ensemble playing and overlapping
sound to the /?th degree, while
immeasurably increasing his visual
and story sense, and it will be
interesting to see where he goes
from here.

SWEATHOG—One of the groups in a show last weekend at San Francisco's Winterland Arena was
Sweathog, featuring drummer Bartholomew Smith-Frost, who formerly played with Lee Michaels. Black
Sabbath and Edgar Winter's White lYash were also on the bill in a show which Daily reviewer Joe Fiksel
thought was less than perfect. See his review below.
In the Sunday New York
Times a couple of weeks back,
John Simon went on with another
of his screaming diatribes, this
time about how virtually all this
summer's films have been terrible,
pretentious, or, more to the point,
terribly pretentious.
Never have 1 responded so
vehemently to Simon (I even
wrote a letter to the Times), for it
is this sort of across-the-board
panning that has traditionally
earned critics reputations for
seriousness and toughness, hence,
"honesty."
Surprisingly, not only did I
object to Simon's critical
approach but I disagreed with him
as well.
Perhaps partially as a reaction
to Simon's surpassingly depressing
pioce, I, feel like writing a
laudatory' article concentrating on
the best films of the past few

months and will quite willingly
risk being called an "easy" critic
by the likes of the frigid Simon,
impossible (or unwilling) to be
satisfied. If time and space permit,
I'll get to the bilge later.
