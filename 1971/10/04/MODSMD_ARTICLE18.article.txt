# Bad Vibes At Winterland Concert
## 
### JOE FIKSEL 
As we mourn the closing of the
Fillmores West and East and the end of the
rock culture's joyous era of innocence, the
deatli throes continue at San Francisco's
Winterland Arena.
Last Saturday night, Black Sabbath,
Sweathog, and Edgar Winter's White Trash
performed there before a full house of
valiant die-hards, and so frenzied were their
efforts that few people noticed the sad
absence of good music.
Winterland is the real thing—black light,
balloons floating and bouncing above the
crowd, music and film clips to fill the lull
between acts, and an elaborate light show
continuously projected onto a huge screen
above the stage. As the audience filters in,
the sweet smell of grass creates an
atmosphere of warmth, and many spirits
are high.
The concert bagan with Sweathog, a Los
Angeles group featuring Bartholemew
Smith-Frost ("Frosty") former drummer
with Lee Michaels. Theirs is an antiquated
straight rock sound with a great deal of
energy. It soon becomes clear that their
central purpose is to see that the audience
gets off, and they resort to gimmickry
rather than music.

"Frosty" produces a freaky, shrieky
little gadget—a black box with one
antenna-like rod projecting from it—which
he attacks and manipulates wildly, causing
some truly mind-blowing electronic wails
and hums.
This earns him a standing ovation from
the stoned crowd.
Then the lead guitarist slowly and
dramatically runs a sword through his
guitar, raises it aloft, and ignites it like a
torch. Apparently this sort of ritual has
become a prerequisite for aspiring rock
stars, a la Hendrix at Monterey Pop.
Next on the bill was Edgar Winter's
White Trash, a seven-man group that
surpasses Sweathog both in volume and in
physical contortion. They are even more
intent on exhorting the crowd into genuine
participation: "ALL RIGHT YOU
MOTHERS-ARE YOU READY IF YOU
FEEL LIKE LETTING IT OUT, LET IT
OUT!" There is much blaring of brass and
tortured screaming; the kids respond
enthusiastically.
The center of attention is Edgar Winter
himself, a thin, fair-haired albino (Brother
of Johnny) with a remarkable voice, sliding
from an insane falsetto to a throaty tenor,
ululating, clucking and trilling through his
acrobatics.

Again, the histrionics were successful.
The kids were on their feet, and moving
earnestly to anything that sounded
remotely rhythmic. They were ready for
the main event.
Black Sabbath is a British group, who,
like Grand Funk, have been put down by
most critics, yet are selling thousands of
records to an abundant and loyal
following. They came reeling onto the
stage as if to prove that they were
undisputedlv the four most zonked freaks
in the entire arena, and the impatient
crowd greeted them with a roar. Their
vocalist hopped around giddily, flashing
V-signs and clenched-fist salutes almost
constantly, smiling and blowing kisses at
his fans. He and the lead guitarist are into a
body-twitching, hair-tossing routing that
smacks of a very heavy trip.
Their sound was deafening and
ponderous, loaded with bass, coming across
like a particularly leaden Led Zeppelin.
They sing in flat, monotonic cadences
about themes as gloomy as their name
suggests—black magic, death and
destruction, children of the grave.
"Paranoid," their only well-known
number—and title of their latest LP—is
typically morbid; it's the best they've done

and probably the best they'll ever do. They
show no promise of achieving some of the
musical virtuosity or imagination of Led
Zeppelin; a lone solo by their rhythm
guitarist was the only relief from their
pounding, laborious style.
But that night the lyrics were
unintelligible and unimportant, the crude
melodies were lost in a booming ocean of
amplifier feedback. The kids were not
there to listen, but to feel, to experience. A
massive fix of hysteria is what they crave,
and Black Sabbath is eager and able to
deliver.
How ironic, how ominous is the black
content of their songs, in the light of their
drugged, euphoric message:
"EVERYBODY GET HIGH! I AM, YOU
SHOULD BE TOO!"
This is not where rock music is at. There
is no meaning here, nothing to admire,
nothing to cherish.
Like a deranged witch doctor, Black
Sabbath has betrayed its tribe, seduced
them into a macabre dance of death.
Yes, rock music's era of innocence has
ended, but after innocence come growth
and discovery.
And that bleak Saturday night at
Winterland is not the way.
