# 'Surf's Up'
## Beach Boys Show Maturation 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
SURF'S UP, The Beach Boys,
Warner/Reprise/Brother RS 6 45 3
"Excuse me, sir, but do you
carry the new Beach Boys
album?"
"What's that, son? Now Beatles
album?"
"No, sir. Beach Boys. You
know, Brian Wilson and them."
" Well, we don't have it, but
step right over here. 1 can give you
a great buy on some used Jan &
Dean records. . . "
For all those who were hesitant
of going out and buying the new
Beach Boys record for fear of
going through a similar scene with
your friendly neighborhood
•ecord dealer, take heart! "Surf's
Up" is definitely worth any hassle
you have to go through to get a
copy.
This album, a follow-up to the
group's similarly outstanding
"Sunflower" contains many of

the same elements found in the
earlier record, but it also marks
the maturation of virtually the
entire group as songwriters.
Every member except Dennis
Wilson is represented with at least
one composition, and these
represent not only the best Beach
Boys cuts ever, but also some of
the best recorded material
released this year. Side one,
perhaps the stronger of the two
sides, contains no Brian Wilson
material whatsoever, but manages
to combine the group's
always-in-evidence vocal talents,
with a new-found sense of
direction in songwriting.
"Don't Go Near the Water," a
Mike Love-Alan Jardine
composition, is an ecological ditty
on the sad state of the world's
polluted water. The
electronically-altered background
vocals actually sound like they're

being sung through water, while
the lead voice admonishes us that
"Toothpaste and soap will make
our oceans a bubble bath/so let's
avoid an ecological
aftermath/beginning with me,
beginning with you."
"Long Promised Road,"
co-authored by Carl Wilson and
non-Beach Boy Jack Rieley, is a
much more serious piece, dealing
with a nice, easy, narrow topic
like The Meaning of Life.
However, the song stops short of
being cloying in its lyrics, and is
actually very enjoyable. And
listening to the group harmonize
on the word "down" will set the
record straight as to the best
harmonization in rock. Take that,
Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young.
One of the best songs on the
album is Bruce Johnston's gently
satirical and gently wistful
"Disney Girls (1957)." Evoking
memories of the "good old days"
for this generation, the song will
warm the hearts of anyone who
used to watch Annette on the
Mickey Mouse Club, or who used
to thrill to the weekly adventures
of Ozzie and Harriet and darling
Ricky.
Another cut evoking memories
of days gone by, these not quite
as good, is "Student
Demonstration Time," Mike
Love's updating of the old
Lieber-Stoller hit, "Riot on Cell
Block Number Nine." This traces
the student movement from
Berkeley's FSM to Kent State,

where "four martyrs earned a new
degree/The Bachelor of Bullets."
The song also warns that "the pen
is mightier than the sword but no
match for a gun."
Side two is more free form,
with Carl Wilson's "Feel Flows"
and Brian Wilson's "A Day in the
Life of a Tree" both containing
some interesting lyrics. But by far
the dominant cut on the side is
the near-legendary title song.
"Surf's Up," which was co-written
by Brian Wilson and Van Dyke
Parks, he of the Ip "Song Cycle"
and undeserved anonymity.
The song was written several
years ago, at a time when Parks
was involved in a couple of Beach
Boys albums for Capitol Records.
At that time, the song was either
not released by the group as
being "too far ahead of its time,"
or not released by Capitol as being
"too far out" for the group's
audience, depending on which
story you hear.
The song itself is a free-form
matching of words, having very
little to do with surfing, but
having a lot to do with something.
The problem is, apparently no
one, outside of the group, knows
what with. If anybody discovers
what "eolumnated ruin domino"
means, please let me know.
Also interesting in the song is
the final line, "The child is father
to the man." It perhaps embodies
what the rest of the song tries to
say, and was written before All
Kooper's first Blood, Sweat and
Tears album of the similar name.

is mightier than the sword but no
match for a gun."
Side two is more free form,
with Carl Wilson's "Feel Flows"
and Brian Wilson's "A Day in the
Life of a Tree" both containing
some interesting lyrics. But by far
the dominant cut on the side is
the near-legendary title song.
"Surf's Up," which was co-written
by Brian Wilson and Van Dyke
Parks, he of the Ip "Song Cycle"
and undeserved anonymity.
The song was written several
years ago, at a time when Parks
was involved in a couple of Beach
Boys albums for Capitol Records.
At that time, the song was either
not released by the group as
being "too far ahead of its time,"
or not released by Capitol as being
"too far out" for the group's
audience, depending on which
story you hear.
The song itself is a free-form
matching of words, having very
little to do with surfing, but
having a lot to do with something.
The problem is, apparently no
one, outside of the group, knows
what with. If anybody discovers
what "eolumnated ruin domino"
means, please let me know.
Also interesting in the song is
the final line, "The child is father
to the man." It perhaps embodies
what the rest of the song tries to
say, and was written before All
Kooper's first Blood, Sweat and
Tears album of the similar name.

SURF'S UP, The Beach Boys,
Warner/Reprise/Brother RS 6 45 3
"Excuse me, sir, but do you
carry the new Beach Boys
album?"
"What's that, son? Now Beatles
album?"
"No, sir. Beach Boys. You
know, Brian Wilson and them."
" Well, we don't have it, but
step right over here. 1 can give you
a great buy on some used Jan &
Dean records. . . "
For all those who were hesitant
of going out and buying the new
Beach Boys record for fear of
going through a similar scene with
your friendly neighborhood
•ecord dealer, take heart! "Surf's
Up" is definitely worth any hassle
you have to go through to get a
copy.
This album, a follow-up to the
group's similarly outstanding
"Sunflower" contains many of

the same elements found in the
earlier record, but it also marks
the maturation of virtually the
entire group as songwriters.
Every member except Dennis
Wilson is represented with at least
one composition, and these
represent not only the best Beach
Boys cuts ever, but also some of
the best recorded material
released this year. Side one,
perhaps the stronger of the two
sides, contains no Brian Wilson
material whatsoever, but manages
to combine the group's
always-in-evidence vocal talents,
with a new-found sense of
direction in songwriting.
"Don't Go Near the Water," a
Mike Love-Alan Jardine
composition, is an ecological ditty
on the sad state of the world's
polluted water. The
electronically-altered background
vocals actually sound like they're

being sung through water, while
the lead voice admonishes us that
"Toothpaste and soap will make
our oceans a bubble bath/so let's
avoid an ecological
aftermath/beginning with me,
beginning with you."
"Long Promised Road,"
co-authored by Carl Wilson and
non-Beach Boy Jack Rieley, is a
much more serious piece, dealing
with a nice, easy, narrow topic
like The Meaning of Life.
However, the song stops short of
being cloying in its lyrics, and is
actually very enjoyable. And
listening to the group harmonize
on the word "down" will set the
record straight as to the best
harmonization in rock. Take that,
Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young.
One of the best songs on the
album is Bruce Johnston's gently
satirical and gently wistful
"Disney Girls (1957)." Evoking
memories of the "good old days"
for this generation, the song will
warm the hearts of anyone who
used to watch Annette on the
Mickey Mouse Club, or who used
to thrill to the weekly adventures
of Ozzie and Harriet and darling
Ricky.
Another cut evoking memories
of days gone by, these not quite
as good, is "Student
Demonstration Time," Mike
Love's updating of the old
Lieber-Stoller hit, "Riot on Cell
Block Number Nine." This traces
the student movement from
Berkeley's FSM to Kent State,

where "four martyrs earned a new
degree/The Bachelor of Bullets."
The song also warns that "the pen
is mightier than the sword but no
match for a gun."
Side two is more free form,
with Carl Wilson's "Feel Flows"
and Brian Wilson's "A Day in the
Life of a Tree" both containing

copy.
This album, a follow-up to the
group's similarly outstanding
"Sunflower" contains many of

the same elements found in the
earlier record, but it also marks
the maturation of virtually the
entire group as songwriters.
Every member except Dennis
Wilson is represented with at least
one composition, and these
represent not only the best Beach
Boys cuts ever, but also some of
the best recorded material
released this year. Side one,
perhaps the stronger of the two
sides, contains no Brian Wilson
material whatsoever, but manages
to combine the group's
always-in-evidence vocal talents,
with a new-found sense of
direction in songwriting.
"Don't Go Near the Water," a
Mike Love-Alan Jardine
composition, is an ecological ditty
on the sad state of the world's
polluted water. The
electronically-altered background
vocals actually sound like they're

being sung through water, while
the lead voice admonishes us that
"Toothpaste and soap will make
our oceans a bubble bath/so let's
avoid an ecological
aftermath/beginning with me,
beginning with you."
"Long Promised Road,"
co-authored by Carl Wilson and
non-Beach Boy Jack Rieley, is a
much more serious piece, dealing
with a nice, easy, narrow topic
like The Meaning of Life.
However, the song stops short of
being cloying in its lyrics, and is
actually very enjoyable. And
listening to the group harmonize
on the word "down" will set the
record straight as to the best
harmonization in rock. Take that,
Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young.
One of the best songs on the
album is Bruce Johnston's gently
satirical and gently wistful
"Disney Girls (1957)." Evoking
memories of the "good old days"
for this generation, the song will
warm the hearts of anyone who
used to watch Annette on the
Mickey Mouse Club, or who used
to thrill to the weekly adventures
of Ozzie and Harriet and darling
Ricky.
Another cut evoking memories
of days gone by, these not quite
as good, is "Student
Demonstration Time," Mike
Love's updating of the old
Lieber-Stoller hit, "Riot on Cell
Block Number Nine." This traces
the student movement from
Berkeley's FSM to Kent State,

where "four martyrs earned a new
degree/The Bachelor of Bullets."
The song also warns that "the pen
is mightier than the sword but no
match for a gun."
Side two is more free form,
with Carl Wilson's "Feel Flows"
and Brian Wilson's "A Day in the
Life of a Tree" both containing
some interesting lyrics. But by far
the dominant cut on the side is
the near-legendary title song.
"Surf's Up," which was co-written
by Brian Wilson and Van Dyke
Parks, he of the Ip "Song Cycle"
and undeserved anonymity.
The song was written several
years ago, at a time when Parks
was involved in a couple of Beach
Boys albums for Capitol Records.
At that time, the song was either
not released by the group as
being "too far ahead of its time,"
or not released by Capitol as being
"too far out" for the group's
audience, depending on which
story you hear.
The song itself is a free-form
matching of words, having very
little to do with surfing, but
having a lot to do with something.
The problem is, apparently no
one, outside of the group, knows
what with. If anybody discovers
what "eolumnated ruin domino"
means, please let me know.
Also interesting in the song is
the final line, "The child is father
to the man." It perhaps embodies
what the rest of the song tries to
say, and was written before All
Kooper's first Blood, Sweat and
Tears album of the similar name.
