# SWOPSI Course Reveals 119 Defense Contracts
## 
### PHIL REVZIN 
There were 795 research contracts
with the federal government here as of
February 9,1971 and roughly the same
number now, according to a report of a
Stanford Workshop on Political and
Social Issues (SWOPSI) class issued this
summer. The Department of Defense
(DOD) is the contracting agency for
119 of these grants.
The report looks at all of the DOD
contracts and 20 contracts with other
government agencies. Each entry
consists of a list of participating
researchers, a graph of the funding
history of the project, a summary of
the work being done based on the
investigator's proposal to the DOD, the
contract itself, and a questionnaire each
researcher was asked to fill out.
Each entry also contained a
description of the work obtained from
the Defense Department.
The principle researcher was given
an opportunity to read the descriptions
of the work and comment as he wished.
Aims of Report
Stanton Glantz, a member of the
class, and a graduate student in Applied
Mechanics stated that "the aim of this
report was to present a collection of
data on DOD sponsored research,
without reaching conclusions or
interpretations."
The data will be interpreted in
Volume 2, which is currently in the
drafting stage, and should be published
in six weeks, according to Glantz.
In a statement to the press released
July 29, the class said that our
"judgements do not deny the existence
of non-military applications of DOD
sponsored research. However, many of
these applications seemed to have been
dreamed up after the fact."
Goals Differ
Among the contracts mentioned is
one being researched by Professor
Pnilip Zimbardo of Psychology. His
title for the project is "Individual and
Group Variables Influencing Emotional
Arousal, Violence, and Behavior." The
Defense Department title is "Personnel
Technology Factors Influencing
Disruptive Behavior Among Military
Trainees."
Zimbardo's research proposal
outlined the goal of the work as "the
discovery of the causal variables
underlying violence and other forms of
ant'-social behavior. Not only is this
class of behavior of tremendous social
and practical concern, but it has vast
theoretical significance for
understanding the interaction of group
and individual variables."
The DOD's stated purpose is more
specific as to the applications of this
research. "U.S. military forces have

recently experienced an apparent
upsurge of problems involving negative
reactions to authority, insufficient
loyalty to the organization, failure to
maintain (and even sabotage of)
valuable government property, and
racial conflict. This research aims at the
production of a set of behavioral
principles which could reduce the
incidence of such undesirable behavior
in the Navy and Marine Corps."
Zimbardo's comments stress the
civilian applications of his work.
Military Applications
Many of the projects, which are
discussed in terms of pure scientific
benefits, are described by the Defense

Department for their military
applications in weapon systems and
military logistics.
Professor T.W. Anderson of
Statistics is doing work on "time series,
which describe cyclical or periodic
phenomena. Examples of these are
business cycles, sunspot cycles, and
commodity prices . . . work under this
contract is primarily theoretical."
The DOD sums up the research more
succinctly. "Improve the Navy's
weaponry by creating improved
probabilistic and statistical
methodology for evaluating, modelling,
and designing weapon systems."
The SWOPSI report also contains a
section on the history of DOD funding
at universities. This section contains
data on some of the Congressional
restraints on sponsored research, which
offers a possible explanation for some
of the discrepancies in purposes
between the researcher and the funding
agency.
Section 203 of the 1 970 Military
Procurement Bill, often known as the
Mansfield Amendment, states, "None
of the funds authorized to be
appropriated by this act may be used to
carry out any research project or study
unless such project or study has a direct
and apparent relationship to a specific
military function or operation."

Glantz commented that "some of
the researchers were genuinely
surprised to discover the applications
which the military attributed to their
work. By and large, though, they
seemed to know what their research
could be used for."
Glantz added that the class has sent
copies to Senators Mansfield, Stennis,
Mclntyre, Proxmire, Cranston, and
McGovern, in addition to Congressmen
Dellums and McCloskey. The DOD has
also ordered several copies, according
to Glantz.
"People seem to be accepting this
report as a fair compendium of
information concerning this research,
and this reaction pleases the class,"
Glantz noted.
