# Offense Dies Against Duke
## 
### CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
Duke's assistant football coach,
Carmen Falcone, summarized his
scouting report to the Durham
press last week, saying "We're
going to need bats, clubs, my
rosary, and Reverend Clelland's
(the Duke Chaplain) prayer book
to beat Stanford." As it turned
out, the Blue Devils did not have
to go to those lengths to beat an
Indian team that could not
generate any offense inside the
Duke 20 or execute a kicking
game.
Stanford overwhelmed Duke
statistically in nearly every
category, but the opportunistic
visitors triumphed in the most
important statistic and took a 9-3
upset victory home with them to
Durham.
Without their star fullback
Steve Jones and three of their
front four on defense, the Blue
Devils were expected to crumble
before the mighty Indian offense
and be stymied by a defense that
had allowed only one touchdown
in three games.
Defense Magnificent
As promised, the Stanford
defense did a magnificent job,
allowing Duke only 139 yards and
a field goal. The offense, however,
moved the ball for 362 yards but
could not sustain a consistent
attack and score.
Duke could not move the ball
against the Thunder Chickens, but
their defense provided all the
scoring needed to defeat Stanford
and its sputtering attack. With the
game five minutes old, defensive
back Ernie Jackson gathered in an

errant Bunce pass and ran 5 4
yards for Duke's only touchdown.
Jackson used his tremendous
speed to pull away from the
pursuing Indians, running the last
4 0 yards in 4.35 seconds.
Larry Butler blocked Dave
Wright's extra point attempt and
the Indians found themselves
down by six points and unable to
score. Stanford mounted five
threatening drives in the first half
after Duke's touchdown, but
every drive was stalled by
penalties and an inability to adjust
to the Blue Devil's defensive
set-up that featured five linemen
and two linebackers.
The Card offense piled up 130
yards during the rest of the half
but could not score. The defense
did its part, however, and held the
Devils to 29 yards.
Frustration
The second half proved to be
just as frustrating for John
Ralston and his team. Stanford
could not establish a running
game through Duke's five man
line. Jackie Brown was held to a
2.6 rushing average and 4 7 yards
and Reggie Sanderson could do no
better. The only successes that the
Indian running game had all day
were flanker John Winesberry's
inside reverses.
Ralston called the Duke team
"opportunistic" in a post game
interview, and the Blue Devils
relied heavily on this quality in
the second half. Early in the third
quarter, Duke took advantage of a
short Stanford punt which Rich
Searl returned to the Indian 3 7
yard line. Quarterback Dennis

Satyshur had only thrown two
passes up to this point, but he
fired three straight aerials,
completing two for a total of 30
yards. The Card Defense stiffened,
but Wright made good on a 21
yard field goal to give his team a
9-0 advantage.
Bunce engineered four drives
after this, but penalties and an
interception cut them all short.
Stanford got down to the Duke
five yard line early in the fourth
quarter but Bunce was thrown for
a ten yard loss while waiting to
pass and the Indians had to settle
for a field goal.
Ball Control
The key to Duke's victory was
the ball control they exhibited in
the second half. Bill Thompson
and Bob Zwirko began hitting the
Stanford line for three to five
yards every time as the Blue
Devils kept the ball away from the
Cards for five minutes at a time.
The Stanford offense had its
chances but could not produce a
touchdown.
Ralston complimented the
Devils, insisting that they are
"very sound in the kicking game,
and have a scrambling defense and
a conservative offense that wins
football games."
Coach Mike McGee of Duke
made the best use of what talent
he had by placing talented
offensive linemen Ed Newman
and Willie Clayton on the
defensive line as well. Linebacker
Jerry Giffin also played on the
defensive front line.
The Indians lost to a well
coached, conservative football

team that takes advantage of
opponents mistakes. This is borne
out by the Blue Devils record
which shows that they have been
soundly beaten statistically in
three out of their first four games,
but they have a perfect 4-0
record.

GOT IT—Miles Moore leaps high to catch a Don Bunce pass as Duke's defending Rich Searl undercuts him
for the tackle. Two other Blue Devil defenders, Ernie Jackson and Bill Hanenberg, watch the action.
Moore hauled down four passes for 6 9 yards in the first half alone against the Devils.

SCOOTING AWAY—Reggie Sanderson breaks through the Duke line and is being pursued by Skeet Harris,
Dean Greenawalt, and Jerry Giffin. Sanderson, filling in for the injured Hillary Shockley, ran for 4 5 yards
in 13 carries against the Blue Devils.
