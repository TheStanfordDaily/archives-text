# Poloists Dump NCAA Champ
## 
### DOUG WILSON 
Top-rated teams in NCAA
water polo competition are
usually California squads, and the
Stanford varsity established itself
as one of those to be reckoned
with this season as the Indian
poloists made an impressive
showing in the Northern
California Water Polo
Tournament, held this past
weekend at De Anza College. A
5-4 victory over defending NCAA
champ UC-Irvine highlighted
action in the two-day tournament,
in which Stanford placed second
to San Jose State College.
En route to the Irvine victory,
Stanford also managed to
overpower De Anza, 11-3, and tie
Cal State-Fullerton, 4-4. The
Indians lost to San Jose's
tournament champions, 6-5.
Gadd Outstanding
Stanford Coach Jim Gaughran
singled out Mike Davis and Pete
Gadd as "probably the most
outstanding" players in the
tournament. Davis, who scored in
all but the Fullerton games,
managed three goals in seven tries
in the De Anza game to lead
Stanford scorers.
Rick Massamino Stanford's
All-America poloist also added
three points to the Indian tally,
one for each shot he attempted.
Seniors Bill Simpkins and Ken
Hammer, and junior Bob Warren,
accounted for the remainder of
the Stanford goals.
Tough Defense
A tough defense against De
Anza provided goalie Pete Gadd
with a relatively easy game; De
Anza's offense could only manage
one shot, which Gadd blocked, in
the final quarter. Gadd, however,
was a crucial factor in the Irvine
win. His 13 saves in the contest
included a block of a
fourth-quarter goal attempt by
Irvine's Jim Bradburn, which kept
the score 5-4 in favor of the
Indians.
The Stanford goalie, a leading
prospect for All-America honors
this season, also figured in a tough
match with San Jose State on
Saturday, however, his 11 saves of
the game were not enough to
prevent the eventual tournament
winners from posting a 6-5 victory

over Gaughran's varsity squad.
Davis, Massamino and senior
Randy Wilkins accounted for the
Stanford goals, which the
Spartans managed to top by one
in the closing minutes of the
game. Junior Stu Rowe and
freshman Greg Loitz joined
Massamino in providing the four
goals which opponent Cal
State-Fullerton managed to equal
on successful penalty throw
attempts.
Gaughran Confident
Commenting on his team's
weekend performance, Gaughran
said "It was a good tournament,
and the Irvine victory especially

was a real good win for us. They
beat USC and UCLA in their
tournament down south, so it
looks like we have an excellent
chance to have a really fine
season."
Of this Friday's game against
Cal, Gaughran stated "Berkeley is
also real strong this year. They
lost to Irvine in the tournament,
4 -2, but they are nevertheless very
strong. It looks like there will be
five or six teams in contention for
the national championship, and
Cal is one of them. However, we
have better scoring potential than
they do, and I think we can play
defense with anybody."

strong. It looks like there will be
five or six teams in contention for
the national championship, and
Cal is one of them. However, we
have better scoring potential than
they do, and I think we can play
defense with anybody."
Top-rated teams in NCAA
water polo competition are
usually California squads, and the
Stanford varsity established itself
as one of those to be reckoned
with this season as the Indian
poloists made an impressive
showing in the Northern
California Water Polo
Tournament, held this past
weekend at De Anza College. A
5-4 victory over defending NCAA
champ UC-Irvine highlighted
action in the two-day tournament,
in which Stanford placed second
to San Jose State College.
En route to the Irvine victory,
Stanford also managed to
overpower De Anza, 11-3, and tie
Cal State-Fullerton, 4-4. The
Indians lost to San Jose's
tournament champions, 6-5.
Gadd Outstanding
Stanford Coach Jim Gaughran
singled out Mike Davis and Pete
Gadd as "probably the most
outstanding" players in the
tournament. Davis, who scored in
all but the Fullerton games,
managed three goals in seven tries
in the De Anza game to lead
Stanford scorers.
Rick Massamino Stanford's
All-America poloist also added
three points to the Indian tally,
one for each shot he attempted.
Seniors Bill Simpkins and Ken
Hammer, and junior Bob Warren,
accounted for the remainder of
the Stanford goals.
Tough Defense
A tough defense against De
Anza provided goalie Pete Gadd
with a relatively easy game; De
Anza's offense could only manage
one shot, which Gadd blocked, in
the final quarter. Gadd, however,
was a crucial factor in the Irvine
win. His 13 saves in the contest
included a block of a
fourth-quarter goal attempt by
Irvine's Jim Bradburn, which kept
the score 5-4 in favor of the
Indians.
The Stanford goalie, a leading
prospect for All-America honors
this season, also figured in a tough
match with San Jose State on
Saturday, however, his 11 saves of
the game were not enough to
prevent the eventual tournament
winners from posting a 6-5 victory

over Gaughran's varsity squad.
Davis, Massamino and senior
Randy Wilkins accounted for the
Stanford goals, which the
Spartans managed to top by one
in the closing minutes of the
game. Junior Stu Rowe and
freshman Greg Loitz joined
Massamino in providing the four
goals which opponent Cal
State-Fullerton managed to equal
on successful penalty throw
attempts.
Gaughran Confident
Commenting on his team's
weekend performance, Gaughran
said "It was a good tournament,
and the Irvine victory especially

was a real good win for us. They
beat USC and UCLA in their
tournament down south, so it
looks like we have an excellent
chance to have a really fine
season."
Of this Friday's game against
Cal, Gaughran stated "Berkeley is
also real strong this year. They
lost to Irvine in the tournament,
4 -2, but they are nevertheless very
strong. It looks like there will be
five or six teams in contention for
the national championship, and
Cal is one of them. However, we
have better scoring potential than
they do, and I think we can play
