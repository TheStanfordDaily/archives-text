country men opened their 1971

Golf Course, running against the
West Valley Track Club over a 4 .2
mile layout.
There was no scoring in the
meet which served as a warm-up
for the .Stanford runners who will
get their first sampling of

Saturday in the Sacramento State
Invitational.
Duncan Mac Donald finished in
a first place tie with Don Kardong
who is now running for the West
Valley Track Club and Robert
Coe who was running unattached
Saturday. Mac Donald's time of
20:20 was one of the fastest times
ever recorded by an Indian runner
in the first competition of the
season.

behind the winning trio in the
time of 20:53. Arvid Kretz and
freshman Kurt Schoenrock placed
in a tie for tenth.

start slow, but as our more
experienced runners improve their
conditioning we will become a
threat."
