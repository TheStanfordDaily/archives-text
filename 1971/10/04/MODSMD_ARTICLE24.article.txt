## Time To Evaluate 
### Charlie Hoffman 
The Indians are going on the road for these next two weekends to
meet their principal rivals for a trip to the Rose Bowl and it appears to
be a good time to evaluate the 1971 Cards and their 3-1 record.
Don Bunce, Miles Moore, and John Winesberry have come up with
the big play on numerous occasions this year. Although last year's
passing attack led by Jim Plunkett was brilliant, Bunce and his
talented receivers have come up with more long and exciting pass
plays than last season's offense.
The most persistent problem that this years squad has displayed
has been its inability to sustain a consistent attack. This problem was
not as apparent in the Indian's first three wins because of the less
polished defenses they faced. When Stanford came up against a
spirited defense in the Duke game, however, the offense could not
drive the ball over the line.
Senseless Penalties
Execution errors caused penalties that stalled almost every one of
the Indian's first quarter drives. Senseless illegal procedure and offside
penalties hampered the offense at crucial times. Stanford could not
establish a running game through a Duke defensive line that boasted
only one starter.
The performance of Reggie Sanderson against Duke was
encouraging, but there is no way to evaluate the loss of Hillary
Shockley who will be needed to help the Cards overcome Washington
and USC.
Must Spot Receivers
In the passing department, Bunce has not used the time he has had
in the pocket to spot his secondary and tertiary receivers. Against a
stunting old defense, he showed less talent for scrambling than he had
in previous outings.
Significantly, scattered boos could be heard coming from
Saturday's crowd as Bunce failed to find his open receiver play after
play. Even when Plunkett ran into trouble last year against Purdue,
the crowd did not vocally vent their ire.
John Ralston commented that an important factor in Saturday's
loss was the 17.5 yard difference in punting averages. Poor punting
gave Duke good field position time after time and led to their field
goal in the third quarter. The Indians cannot afford to give Sonny
Sixkiller and Jimmy Jones field position.
Defense Magnificent
Defensively, Stanford has been magnificent this season. The
defensive team has proven itself the most effective unit on the West
Coast and Stanford will have to rely heavily upon it in order to win.
The only potential weakness lies in the defense secondary which
has been robbed of all its depth by injuries.
Hopefully, the team can come off the Duke defeat and drive to the
Pac-8 title like they did last year after Purdue. This will only come to
pass if the offense can begin to make those third down plays.
