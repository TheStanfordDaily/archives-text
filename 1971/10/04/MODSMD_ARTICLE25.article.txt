Thieu Gets Viet Vote
SAIGON — Early results from South
Vietnam's presidential ballotting
indicated Sunday night an
overwhelming "vote of confidence" for
President Nguyen Van Thieu in an
election marred by enemy shellings,
terrorism and bloody street rioting.
Final results from 13 of 56 electoral
constituencies, posted before the
National Election Center closed for the
night, showed an average of 9 5.2
percent of the votes for Thieu and 4 .8
percent against him.
Thieu was the only presidential
candidate. Citizens could vote against
him by mutilating or defacing the
ballot or by putting an empty envelope
in the ballot box.
Gunfire rattled in the streets of Da
Nang, South Vietnam's second largest
city, yesterday and armored cars
rumbled in to quell the bloodiest
antigovernment demonstration on
election day.
Hundreds of monks in saffron robes,
high school students, disabled veterans,
Vietnamese Boy Scouts and teen-age
girls clashed repeatedly with police and
army troops in savage street fighting.
By day's end, local hospitals
reported treating at least 5 7 wounded,
three of them by gunshot and 26 by
shrapnel from hand grenades. All but
nine were civilians.
Taiwan Seat
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. - Delegates
of many nationalities and convictions
were agreed Sunday that the United
States faces hard going with its
proposal to keep Nationalist China in
the United Nations while inviting
Communist China to come in.

With the cosponsorship of 16 other
countries, the United States is pushing
a resolution to leave Nationalist China
seated in the assembly and seat
Communist China both in the assembly
and on the Security Council.
But its main hope of saving the
Nationalists' assembly seat lies in
another resolution, cosponsored with
19 other countries, that would
designate the ouster of Nationalist
China an "important question,"
requiring a two-thirds vote for a
decision.
That proposal is directed against the
so-called "albanian resolution,"
sponsored by 21 countries, to oust the
Nationalist while giving everything to
the Communists.
Day-Care Centers
WASHINGTON — Congress generally
takes years to enact programs with a
wide social sweep, but in a couple of
hours last week the House approved
one that could have a tremendous
impact on the nation's future.
It has as its goal nothing less than
seeing to it that each child born in the
United States is given an opportunity
to develop to his full potential.
In pursuit of that goal it would
establish a nationwide network of
day-care centers where the preschool
children of working mothers, or those
from impoverished families, would
receive a wide variety of health,
educational and nutritional services.
No one knows how much it would
cost. Before the House trimmed the
number of children who would be
eligible for free services—to those from
families with incomes under
$4 ,32 o—the administration estimated it
at $20 billion a year.
The Senate, which passed a similar
program a few months ago, thinks it
might cost $2 billion. The managers of
the House bill talked vaguely of $25 0
million or $350 million.
