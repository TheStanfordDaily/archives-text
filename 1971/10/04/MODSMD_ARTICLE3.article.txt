# Temperatures Rise As Franklin, Deputy Vie
## 
### JON DEDMON LARRY LIEBERT 
Two prosecution witnesses told of
damage to the Computation Center and
a confrontation between students and
police outside on February 10, as the
hearing of suspended English Professor
H. Bruce Franklin entered its fifth day
Saturday.
But most of the afternoon was spent
by Franklin in an explosive two and
one-half hour cross examination of the
Santa Clara Sheriff's third ranking
officer, C.D. Marron.
Marron had been at the
Computation Center throughout the
afternoon of the 10th. He had also
declared a group outside the center an
illegal assembly. Soon after, police
charged and arrested four persons.
Franklin's lengthy questioning of
Marron grew so heated at times that
Advisory Board Chairman Donald
Kennedy recessed the hearing for 10
minutes after one particularly angry
outburst.
Bill of Rights
Franklin had just asked Marron if he
was as familiar with the Bill of Rights
as he was with the section of the penal
code on unlawful assembly.
A prosectuion objection to the
question was sustained and Franklin,
irritated, charged that "we're just as
concerned with the right of free
assembly as we are with free speech,
and we don't want no pigs telling us we
can't have a peaceful assembly when we
are a peaceful assembly."
Kennedy interrupted saying, "In
your own interest, Professor Franklin,
I'm going to recess the hearing while
you recover your temper."
Franklin was later allowed to ask the
same question more calmly and
received a "no."
Franklin Continues
In further cross examination
Franklin asked Marron about his
feelings toward revolutionaries and why
people outside the Com Center had
been declared an unlawful assembly.
He also repeatedly questioned
Marron as to why he had not been
allowed to remain on the scene as a
faculty observer after he had identified
himself to police as such.
"Because you're a nothing," Marron
burst out at one point.
Marron later qualified his statement,
saying that he meant that Franklin had
never before been identified to him as a
faculty observer.

When asked how he identified
faculty observers, Marron said at one
point that they "had coats and ties
on." He later added that Franklin had
been "aggressive, belligerent, and
demanding," and that his stride had
been one of "aggressive
determination."
Meeting
In his direct testimony the Santa
Clara officer said that the decision to
clear the Comp Center had been made
after he attended a meeting with
Stanford Director of Public Safety
Bruce Wiggins, Deputy District
Attorney Craig Brown, Assistant to the
President John Schwartz, and Associate
Provost Robert Rosenzweig about 3
p.m.
At that time the group had
considered the situation "serious," said
Marron.
Marron then said that after police
had cleared and secured the Comp
Center, people were dispersing from the
area fairly well when "from somewhere
Professor Franklin came striding
forward directly at me. As he advanced
the group seemed to fall in behind him
and there was a buildup of people in
the square again."
It was after this buildup that police
swept the area and made arrests.
Damages
Earlier in Saturday's proceedings,
Richard Montgomery, computation
operations manager at the Comp
Center, had said that after occupation
of the center and its subsequent
clearing by police, there had been $800
damage, $250 to the computer and
$5 5 0 to the physical plant.
But under cross examination
Montgomery admitted that since the

computer was so vulnerable, one man
with a screwdriver could do
incalculable damage in one minute.
"My thought is that there was no intent
to destroy the computer," Montgomery
said.
In his direct testimony, Montgomery
said he had closed and locked the
Comp Center at 12:30 p.m. on the
10 th after a call from Provost William
Miller.
Montgomery added that Miller had
told him to close the facility since
people from a White Plaza rally were
"heading in your direction."
On Friday
At Friday's session, Assistant
General Secretary Dave Glen testified
that a speech by Franklin at that rally
encouraged many spectators to move
toward the Computation Center.
Charges against Franklin include
inciting the Comp Center shutdown.
Glen said, "I personally felt that
Prof. Franklin acted as a catalyst to get
the group moving in the direction of
the Computation Center."
And Harry Press of the University

News Service said that Franklin's
speech "moved" the crowd, although
those at the rally later "headed in many
directions."
Descriptions of the Comp Center
occupation itself were admitted over
Franklin's objections that the
occupation was "irrelevant" to the case
because he is not charged with being in
the building.
Photographers Barred
Press said that after protesters broke
into the building they barred
photographers and shouted down an
administrator who demanded that they
leave.
Franklin told the Advisory' Board
that the real cause of the occupation
was the news that the computer was
being used by Stanford Research
Institute (SRI) to plan an amphibious
invasion. Quoting a Stanford News
release, Franklin said that more than
500 persons had voted at a rally the
night before his speech to hold a sit-in
or "mobile strike."
The seven faculty judges listened to
a taped KZSU broadcast of Franklin's
speech. According to the
tape—recorded by a dispatcher for the
campus fire and police
departments—Franklin urged a "little
tiny gesture ... to begin to shut down
the most obvious machinery of war,
such as—l think it is a good target—that
Computation Center."
But in earlier parts of the speech,
Franklin referred to a shutdown in
terms of a "fake-strike" and "a
voluntary boycott."
'Like Cambodia'
The suspended professor said,
"Every member of the Advisory Board
knows I was calling for the strike, a
fake-strike just like the one we had
about Cambodia the year before."
During the Friday session, Franklin
asked for a one-minute extension of a
recess for his promised courtroom
tribute to the 22 nd anniversary of the
People's Republic of China. About 15

persons in the crowd stood up and
waved little red flags.
A near full-house of 110 persons
attended Friday's session, but the
crowd was down to about 80 on
Saturday.
Because of a request by
administration attorney Raymond
Fisher, the hearings in Physics 101 will
resume at 2 p.m. today instead of the
usual 1 p.m.
