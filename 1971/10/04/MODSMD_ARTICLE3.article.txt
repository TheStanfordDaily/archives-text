# Temperatures Rise As Franklin, Deputy Vie
## 
### JON DEDMON LARRY LIEBERT 
Two prosecution witnesses told of
damage to the Computation Center and
a confrontation between students and
police outside on February 10, as the
hearing of suspended English Professor
H. Bruce Franklin entered its fifth day
Saturday.
But most of the afternoon was spent
by Franklin in an explosive two and
one-half hour cross examination of the
Santa Clara Sheriff's third ranking
officer, C.D. Marron.
Marron had been at the
Computation Center throughout the
afternoon of the 10th. He had also
declared a group outside the center an
illegal assembly. Soon after, police
charged and arrested four persons.
Franklin's lengthy questioning of
Marron grew so heated at times that
Advisory Board Chairman Donald
Kennedy recessed the hearing for 10
minutes after one particularly angry
outburst.
Bill of Rights
Franklin had just asked Marron if he
was as familiar with the Bill of Rights
as he was with the section of the penal
code on unlawful assembly.
A prosectuion objection to the
question was sustained and Franklin,
irritated, charged that "we're just as
concerned with the right of free
assembly as we are with free speech,
and we don't want no pigs telling us we
can't have a peaceful assembly when we
are a peaceful assembly."
Kennedy interrupted saying, "In
your own interest, Professor Franklin,
I'm going to recess the hearing while
you recover your temper."
Franklin was later allowed to ask the
same question more calmly and
received a "no."
Franklin Continues
In further cross examination
Franklin asked Marron about his
feelings toward revolutionaries and why
people outside the Com Center had
been declared an unlawful assembly.
He also repeatedly questioned
Marron as to why he had not been
allowed to remain on the scene as a
faculty observer after he had identified
himself to police as such.
"Because you're a nothing," Marron
burst out at one point.
Marron later qualified his statement,
saying that he meant that Franklin had
never before been identified to him as a
faculty observer.

When asked how he identified
faculty observers, Marron said at one
point that they "had coats and ties
on." He later added that Franklin had
been "aggressive, belligerent, and
demanding," and that his stride had
been one of "aggressive
determination."
Meeting
In his direct testimony the Santa
Clara officer said that the decision to
clear the Comp Center had been made
after he attended a meeting with
Stanford Director of Public Safety
Bruce Wiggins, Deputy District
Attorney Craig Brown, Assistant to the
President John Schwartz, and Associate
