# Costs Grow For Hearing
## 
### 
Facilities for a three-week hearing in
the Franklin case would cost $21,000
according to Assistant Provost Alan
Grundmann. But the hearing may last
longer, at $5,300 for each additional
week.
And those figures for the courtroom
and hearing staff do not include the
biggest costs of all—lawyer's fees and
man-hours of administrators and
defendants who are spending more than
thirty hours a week in Physics Room
101.
Grundmann, who is handling the
physical arrangements for the
unprecedented campus hearing, said his
estimates include fixed costs of $ 3,9 75 .
That category involves construction of
the courtroom, phone extensions, and
other supplies.
Weekly costs of $5,300 cover
bailiffs, a secretary, audio, and a court
reporter who charges $4,000 a week.
Closed-circuit TV costs an additional
$950 a month.
Lawyer Fees
Presidential Legal Adviser James
Siena, who spends every afternoon at
the administration table in the
courtroom, has refused to release costs
for the administration's lawyers, who
belong to the well-known Los Angeles
firm of Tuttle and Taylor. Prestigious
lawyers charge as much as $5 0 or more
per hour.
