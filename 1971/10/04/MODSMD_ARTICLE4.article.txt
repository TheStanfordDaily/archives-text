# Costs Grow For Hearing
## 
### 
Facilities for a three-week hearing in
the Franklin case would cost $21,000
according to Assistant Provost Alan
Grundmann. But the hearing may last
longer, at $5,300 for each additional
week.
And those figures for the courtroom
and hearing staff do not include the
biggest costs of all—lawyer's fees and
man-hours of administrators and
defendants who are spending more than
thirty hours a week in Physics Room
101.
Grundmann, who is handling the
physical arrangements for the
unprecedented campus hearing, said his
estimates include fixed costs of $ 3,9 75 .
That category involves construction of
the courtroom, phone extensions, and
other supplies.
Weekly costs of $5,300 cover
bailiffs, a secretary, audio, and a court
reporter who charges $4,000 a week.
Closed-circuit TV costs an additional
$950 a month.
Lawyer Fees
Presidential Legal Adviser James
Siena, who spends every afternoon at
the administration table in the
courtroom, has refused to release costs
for the administration's lawyers, who
belong to the well-known Los Angeles
firm of Tuttle and Taylor. Prestigious
lawyers charge as much as $5 0 or more
per hour.
Bruce Franklin has been leading his
own defense, saying that he cannot
afford a full-time lawyer and attacking
the administration's refusal to pay his
court costs. He said lawyer Dennis
Roberts, who has appeared at several of
the sessions, is working voluntarily.
Well-known attorney Michael
Kennedy represented Franklin in
pre-trial arrangements. But Kennedy
charged no fees for his work and is not
pressuring for collection of $2,7 00 in
other pre-trial costs according to
Franklin.
One additional cost is the fee paid to
Prof. Jan Vetter, lawyer for the
Advisory Board. Vetter's salary has not
been disclosed, but one source said the
UC Berkeley law professor is charging
only a minimal fee because of his
interest in the case.
