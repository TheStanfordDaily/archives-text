# Law Competition Stiffens As Applications Rise
## 
### DANIEL BRENNER 
As easy-going seniors begin to ponder their plans for next
year, the thought of going into law school is becoming
increasingly attractive to more of them. But, if admissions
policies at Hastings, Boalt, and Stanford schools of law are any
indication, competition for places will be more rigorous than
ever before.
Legal training has offered traditional temptations ever since
law schools were founded in the Renaissance: money, prestige,
access to politics, security in a craft that can be individually
practiced. But with the recent decline in industrial demands
for engineers, the bottom falling out of the Ph.D. market, and
the insistence to engage oneself in a task that addresses itself
to social problems, law has become nearly everyone's choice as
the field to enter.
"More and more people are becoming aware of where the
action is," notes William Keogh, associate Dean of Admissions
for the Stanford Law School. This awareness plays an
increasing role in the motivation for minority groups to apply,
a situation which comes at a time when law schools are
themselves seeking to increase minority representation in
first-year class lists. Teamed with this new demographic input
into the freshman class is the surge of applications by women
who have in the past felt that law was restricted to men.

So with a variety of talented people, previously disposed to
laboratories, churches, or kitchens, entering the competition
for places in law school, the above-average student who might
have been assured of a place somewhere five years ago will
discover that it might be tough going.
How tough?
Ann Kingman, Associate Admissions Officer at University
of San Francisco's Hastings School of Law, reports that 5400
applicants applied for 470 spots in their first year class, or
about an 11-1 ratio. To expedite the application process
Hastings uses a ten-point system. Fifty per cent of the
application weight goes to the Law boards (the LSAT), 50 per
cent to the grade point average. The LSAT scores and the GPA
are weighted on the ten point scale; if the applicants receive
less than 15 points, they are usually rejected summarily. I* rom
16 to 18 points will send the application to committee. 19 or
20-point applicants are automatically accepted.
This system, while it permits the admissions staff to
effectively analyze the thousands of applications, takes in
little of those "extra" inputs that are part of the
undergraduate file. In fact, Kingman notes that the GPA is
weighted equally whether the applicant is from a community
college or from the most prestigious private institution. Of
course, if the application gets into committee, such factors
become relevant.

As for Hastings, the most valuable thing, Kingman suggests,
is to get the application in early—no later than December. In
the face of the greater number of applicants, three letters of
recommendation are required. A few years ago, none were
necessary.
Across the Bay at Boalt Law School, the applicant can
expect little relief. Five or six years ago, the number of
applications ran about 1500. It was up to 5700 last year with
even more expected this year. However, the size of the class
has not increased much. Wonda Smith, assistant admissions
officer, predicts that there will be a 10-to-l ratio of
acceptance.
A large part of the stiffer competition comes from the
increasing percentage of minority applicants accepted into the
first year class. The percentage enrolled has increased from 18
per cent to 29 per cent in this year's class. For Boalt, those
persons getting below 650 on the LSAT.or having less than a
3.6 GPA may very well be eliminated from the competition at
the start. But Smith notes that the committee is "very
flexible."
If these facts have convinced anyone that law school is an
unattractive possibility because of its competitive admissions
posture, the practice of law - the goal of law school—has
become increasingly attractive. The growth of pro bono law
practice, such as rural legal assistance or "poverty law,' is

faster as more public and private money is tapped to pay for
the lawyer. Now the prospective lawyer need not accept the
low pay or meager professional status that accompanied such
dedicated litigation. Nor will indigents resign their legal
matters to incompetent attorneys who have been unable to
attract a well-heeled clientele to offer their legal abilities.
So as law becomes a more relevant profession consistent
with a new developing social consciousness and one which
permits minorities a crack at challenging social structure
through its own laws, the chase for a seat in law class becomes
more competitive.
Stanford Law School, which is the most flexible of the
three in terms of minimal requirements, has the highest
competition ratio: 8 out of every 100 applicants will be in the
first-year class if last year's application rate is any indication.
However, as Dean Keogh states, each application is given
particular attention as to the total record achieved as an
undergraduate. Unlike Boalt or Hastings, Stanford examines
the GPA with respect to the school issuing the transcript.
It is Keogh's belief that "any serious student at an
American university can receive an education in the legal
field" if he consistently applies himself. He urges students who
do not get into law school the first time around to continue to
apply the next year.

less than 15 points, they are usually rejected summarily. I* rom
16 to 18 points will send the application to committee. 19 or
20-point applicants are automatically accepted.
This system, while it permits the admissions staff to
effectively analyze the thousands of applications, takes in
little of those "extra" inputs that are part of the
undergraduate file. In fact, Kingman notes that the GPA is
weighted equally whether the applicant is from a community
college or from the most prestigious private institution. Of
course, if the application gets into committee, such factors
become relevant.

As for Hastings, the most valuable thing, Kingman suggests,
is to get the application in early—no later than December. In
the face of the greater number of applicants, three letters of
recommendation are required. A few years ago, none were
necessary.
Across the Bay at Boalt Law School, the applicant can
expect little relief. Five or six years ago, the number of
applications ran about 1500. It was up to 5700 last year with
even more expected this year. However, the size of the class
has not increased much. Wonda Smith, assistant admissions
officer, predicts that there will be a 10-to-l ratio of
acceptance.
A large part of the stiffer competition comes from the
increasing percentage of minority applicants accepted into the
first year class. The percentage enrolled has increased from 18
per cent to 29 per cent in this year's class. For Boalt, those
persons getting below 650 on the LSAT.or having less than a
3.6 GPA may very well be eliminated from the competition at
the start. But Smith notes that the committee is "very
flexible."
If these facts have convinced anyone that law school is an
unattractive possibility because of its competitive admissions
posture, the practice of law - the goal of law school—has
become increasingly attractive. The growth of pro bono law
practice, such as rural legal assistance or "poverty law,' is

faster as more public and private money is tapped to pay for
the lawyer. Now the prospective lawyer need not accept the
low pay or meager professional status that accompanied such
dedicated litigation. Nor will indigents resign their legal
matters to incompetent attorneys who have been unable to
attract a well-heeled clientele to offer their legal abilities.
So as law becomes a more relevant profession consistent
with a new developing social consciousness and one which
permits minorities a crack at challenging social structure
through its own laws, the chase for a seat in law class becomes
more competitive.
Stanford Law School, which is the most flexible of the
three in terms of minimal requirements, has the highest
competition ratio: 8 out of every 100 applicants will be in the
first-year class if last year's application rate is any indication.
However, as Dean Keogh states, each application is given
particular attention as to the total record achieved as an
undergraduate. Unlike Boalt or Hastings, Stanford examines
the GPA with respect to the school issuing the transcript.
It is Keogh's belief that "any serious student at an
American university can receive an education in the legal
field" if he consistently applies himself. He urges students who
do not get into law school the first time around to continue to
apply the next year.
As easy-going seniors begin to ponder their plans for next
year, the thought of going into law school is becoming
increasingly attractive to more of them. But, if admissions
policies at Hastings, Boalt, and Stanford schools of law are any
indication, competition for places will be more rigorous than
ever before.
Legal training has offered traditional temptations ever since
law schools were founded in the Renaissance: money, prestige,
access to politics, security in a craft that can be individually
practiced. But with the recent decline in industrial demands
for engineers, the bottom falling out of the Ph.D. market, and
the insistence to engage oneself in a task that addresses itself
to social problems, law has become nearly everyone's choice as
the field to enter.
"More and more people are becoming aware of where the
action is," notes William Keogh, associate Dean of Admissions
for the Stanford Law School. This awareness plays an
increasing role in the motivation for minority groups to apply,
a situation which comes at a time when law schools are
themselves seeking to increase minority representation in
first-year class lists. Teamed with this new demographic input
into the freshman class is the surge of applications by women
who have in the past felt that law was restricted to men.

So with a variety of talented people, previously disposed to
laboratories, churches, or kitchens, entering the competition
for places in law school, the above-average student who might
have been assured of a place somewhere five years ago will
discover that it might be tough going.
How tough?
Ann Kingman, Associate Admissions Officer at University
of San Francisco's Hastings School of Law, reports that 5400
applicants applied for 470 spots in their first year class, or
about an 11-1 ratio. To expedite the application process
Hastings uses a ten-point system. Fifty per cent of the
application weight goes to the Law boards (the LSAT), 50 per
cent to the grade point average. The LSAT scores and the GPA
are weighted on the ten point scale; if the applicants receive
less than 15 points, they are usually rejected summarily. I* rom

faster as more public and private money is tapped to pay for
the lawyer. Now the prospective lawyer need not accept the
low pay or meager professional status that accompanied such
dedicated litigation. Nor will indigents resign their legal
matters to incompetent attorneys who have been unable to
attract a well-heeled clientele to offer their legal abilities.
So as law becomes a more relevant profession consistent
with a new developing social consciousness and one which
permits minorities a crack at challenging social structure
through its own laws, the chase for a seat in law class becomes
more competitive.
Stanford Law School, which is the most flexible of the
three in terms of minimal requirements, has the highest
competition ratio: 8 out of every 100 applicants will be in the
first-year class if last year's application rate is any indication.
However, as Dean Keogh states, each application is given
particular attention as to the total record achieved as an
undergraduate. Unlike Boalt or Hastings, Stanford examines
the GPA with respect to the school issuing the transcript.
It is Keogh's belief that "any serious student at an
American university can receive an education in the legal
field" if he consistently applies himself. He urges students who
do not get into law school the first time around to continue to
apply the next year.
As easy-going seniors begin to ponder their plans for next
year, the thought of going into law school is becoming
increasingly attractive to more of them. But, if admissions
policies at Hastings, Boalt, and Stanford schools of law are any
indication, competition for places will be more rigorous than
ever before.
Legal training has offered traditional temptations ever since
law schools were founded in the Renaissance: money, prestige,
access to politics, security in a craft that can be individually
practiced. But with the recent decline in industrial demands
for engineers, the bottom falling out of the Ph.D. market, and
the insistence to engage oneself in a task that addresses itself
to social problems, law has become nearly everyone's choice as
the field to enter.
"More and more people are becoming aware of where the
action is," notes William Keogh, associate Dean of Admissions
for the Stanford Law School. This awareness plays an
increasing role in the motivation for minority groups to apply,
a situation which comes at a time when law schools are
themselves seeking to increase minority representation in
first-year class lists. Teamed with this new demographic input
into the freshman class is the surge of applications by women
who have in the past felt that law was restricted to men.

So with a variety of talented people, previously disposed to
laboratories, churches, or kitchens, entering the competition
for places in law school, the above-average student who might
have been assured of a place somewhere five years ago will
discover that it might be tough going.
How tough?
Ann Kingman, Associate Admissions Officer at University
of San Francisco's Hastings School of Law, reports that 5400
applicants applied for 470 spots in their first year class, or
about an 11-1 ratio. To expedite the application process
Hastings uses a ten-point system. Fifty per cent of the
application weight goes to the Law boards (the LSAT), 50 per
cent to the grade point average. The LSAT scores and the GPA
are weighted on the ten point scale; if the applicants receive
less than 15 points, they are usually rejected summarily. I* rom
16 to 18 points will send the application to committee. 19 or
20-point applicants are automatically accepted.
This system, while it permits the admissions staff to
effectively analyze the thousands of applications, takes in
little of those "extra" inputs that are part of the
undergraduate file. In fact, Kingman notes that the GPA is
weighted equally whether the applicant is from a community
college or from the most prestigious private institution. Of
course, if the application gets into committee, such factors
become relevant.

As for Hastings, the most valuable thing, Kingman suggests,
is to get the application in early—no later than December. In
the face of the greater number of applicants, three letters of
recommendation are required. A few years ago, none were
necessary.
Across the Bay at Boalt Law School, the applicant can
expect little relief. Five or six years ago, the number of
applications ran about 1500. It was up to 5700 last year with
even more expected this year. However, the size of the class
has not increased much. Wonda Smith, assistant admissions
officer, predicts that there will be a 10-to-l ratio of
acceptance.
A large part of the stiffer competition comes from the
increasing percentage of minority applicants accepted into the
first year class. The percentage enrolled has increased from 18
per cent to 29 per cent in this year's class. For Boalt, those
persons getting below 650 on the LSAT.or having less than a
3.6 GPA may very well be eliminated from the competition at
the start. But Smith notes that the committee is "very
flexible."
If these facts have convinced anyone that law school is an
unattractive possibility because of its competitive admissions
posture, the practice of law - the goal of law school—has
become increasingly attractive. The growth of pro bono law
practice, such as rural legal assistance or "poverty law,' is

faster as more public and private money is tapped to pay for
the lawyer. Now the prospective lawyer need not accept the
low pay or meager professional status that accompanied such
dedicated litigation. Nor will indigents resign their legal
matters to incompetent attorneys who have been unable to
attract a well-heeled clientele to offer their legal abilities.
