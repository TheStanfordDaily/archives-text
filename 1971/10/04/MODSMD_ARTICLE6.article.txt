## Nuremberg, Free Speech, & Lodge 
### 
halsted holman

Following the Second World War,
at tribunals in Nuremberg and Tokyo,
the allied powers tried and convicted
civilian and military leaders of
Germany and Japan for war crimes. In
1945, on the initiative of the United
States, the General Assembly of the
United Nations affirmed unanimously
"the principles of international law
recognized by the Charter of the
Nuremberg Tribunal."
In 1950 the International Law
Commission of the United Nations
formulated the Principles of Nuremberg
which offer the most complete set of
guidelines presently available on the
relationship between personable
responsibility and war crimes. When
the speech of Henry Cabot Lodge was
disturbed last spring the issue emerged
of competing obligations of citizens to
the Nuremberg Principles and to the
Principle of freedom of speech. Partly
ecause of his participation in this
event Professor Bruce Franklin now
faces dismissal. This article (Part two of
which will appear tomorrow), will
explore some of the relationships
between free speech and the
Nuremberg Principles. It is the
contention of this article that the
disrupters of the Lodge speech acted in
concert with the Nuremberg Principles
and hence have a partial if not
complete defense.
It is equally contended that the
University Administration and many of
its supporters, by failing to recognize
obligations under the Nuremberg
Principles, have not met their
responsibilities as citizens and have
inaccurately and unfairly restricted the
scope of the case.
Nurembe.g Principles
Certain of the Nuremberg Principles
are germane to this discussion. Principle
II states, "The fact that internal law
does not impose a penalty for an act
which constitutes a crime under
international law does not relieve the
person who committed the act from

responsibility under international law."
This principle establishes the
supremacy of international
responsibility over national law.
Principle 111 states, "The fact that a
person who committed an act which
constitutes a crime under international
law acted as head of state or
responsible government official does
not relieve him from responsibility
under international law." This principle
applies to the actions of Henry Cabot
Lodge as a member of the government
and a responsible official in Vietnam.
His role has now been well established
by the Pentagon Papers.
Principle IV states, "The fact that a
person acted pursuant to an order of
his government or of a superior does
not relieve him from responsibility
under international law, provided a
moral choice was in fact possible for
him." This principle establishes that
each person in government and the
military is responsible directly for his
actions or inactions
The Crimes In Vienam
Under Principle VI of Nuremberg
certain crimes are identified as
punishable under international law.
These include a) planning, preparation,
initiation or waging of a war of
aggression or participation in a
common plan or conspiracy for the
accomplishment of the above and b)
violations of the laws or customs of a
war which include, but are not limited
to, murder, ill treatment of civilians, ill
treatment or murder of prisoners of
war, killing of hostages, plunder of
public or private property, wanton
destruction of cities, towns or villages,
or devastation not justified by military
necessity.
It is now established that the United
States has commited at least some of
these crimes in Vietnam. It is also clear
that, though he has yet to be found
guilty in court, Henry Cabot Lodge had
a deep personal involvement in the
actions defined as war crimes above.

The Nuremberg Principles do not
specifically delineate the
responsibilities of private citizens or
institutions when confronted with a
government guilty of war crimes.
However, they provide a powerful
moral requirement and basis for
citizens to act. Principle VII states,
"Complicity in the commission of a
crime against humanity as set forth in
Principle VI is a crime under
international law." Silent citizens or
universities which assist the government
might be considered complicitous.
In 1944 President Franklin
Roosevelt spoke forcefully on the
matter to the German people: "Hitler is
committing these crimes against
humanity in the name of the German
people. I ask every German and every
man everywhere under Nazi
domination to show the world that he
does not share theÂ«e insane criminal
desires. . . 1 ask him also to keep watch,
and to record the evidence that will one
day be used to convict the guilty."
Governments almost never act
against themselves. Unless the citizens
do, there is little hope of terminating
war crimes short of military defeat. In

Nazi Germany citizens took no action
and millions paid the price.
Freedom Of Speech
Freedom of speech, a cornerstone of
the Bill of Rights, has as its purpose the
protection of democratic liberties. It
guarantees to all the right to hear
diverse and unusual views; it guarantees
to each freedom from prosecution for
unpopular views.
Custom and law place certain limits
on speaking rights. A citizen may not
speak at any time and in any volume as,
for example, at midnight with a
loudspeaker und;r a neighbor's
window. However he may not be
limited from speaking frequently on
any subject in a public forum.
In the United States, precedent has
established that freedom of speech may
be abridged when it presents a "clear
and present danger" to the social order.
Specific decisions under this precedent
have been highly controversial.
Nonetheless in particular ways freedom
of speech has been subject to
restriction in the interests of other
purposes. Tomorrow: The Lodge
Incident.

Following the Second World War,
at tribunals in Nuremberg and Tokyo,
the allied powers tried and convicted
civilian and military leaders of
Germany and Japan for war crimes. In
1945, on the initiative of the United
States, the General Assembly of the
United Nations affirmed unanimously
"the principles of international law
recognized by the Charter of the
Nuremberg Tribunal."
In 1950 the International Law
Commission of the United Nations
formulated the Principles of Nuremberg
which offer the most complete set of
guidelines presently available on the
relationship between personable
responsibility and war crimes. When
the speech of Henry Cabot Lodge was
disturbed last spring the issue emerged
of competing obligations of citizens to
the Nuremberg Principles and to the
Principle of freedom of speech. Partly
ecause of his participation in this
event Professor Bruce Franklin now
faces dismissal. This article (Part two of
which will appear tomorrow), will
explore some of the relationships
between free speech and the
Nuremberg Principles. It is the
contention of this article that the
disrupters of the Lodge speech acted in
concert with the Nuremberg Principles
and hence have a partial if not
complete defense.
It is equally contended that the
University Administration and many of
its supporters, by failing to recognize
obligations under the Nuremberg
Principles, have not met their
responsibilities as citizens and have
inaccurately and unfairly restricted the
scope of the case.
Nurembe.g Principles
Certain of the Nuremberg Principles
are germane to this discussion. Principle
II states, "The fact that internal law
does not impose a penalty for an act
which constitutes a crime under
international law does not relieve the
person who committed the act from

responsibility under international law."
This principle establishes the
supremacy of international
responsibility over national law.
Principle 111 states, "The fact that a
person who committed an act which
constitutes a crime under international
law acted as head of state or
responsible government official does
not relieve him from responsibility
under international law." This principle
applies to the actions of Henry Cabot
Lodge as a member of the government
and a responsible official in Vietnam.
His role has now been well established
by the Pentagon Papers.
Principle IV states, "The fact that a
person acted pursuant to an order of
his government or of a superior does
not relieve him from responsibility
under international law, provided a
moral choice was in fact possible for
him." This principle establishes that
each person in government and the
military is responsible directly for his
actions or inactions
The Crimes In Vienam
Under Principle VI of Nuremberg
certain crimes are identified as
punishable under international law.
These include a) planning, preparation,
initiation or waging of a war of
aggression or participation in a
common plan or conspiracy for the
accomplishment of the above and b)
violations of the laws or customs of a
war which include, but are not limited
to, murder, ill treatment of civilians, ill
treatment or murder of prisoners of
war, killing of hostages, plunder of
public or private property, wanton
destruction of cities, towns or villages,
or devastation not justified by military
necessity.
It is now established that the United
States has commited at least some of
these crimes in Vietnam. It is also clear
that, though he has yet to be found
guilty in court, Henry Cabot Lodge had
a deep personal involvement in the
actions defined as war crimes above.

The Nuremberg Principles do not
specifically delineate the
responsibilities of private citizens or
institutions when confronted with a
government guilty of war crimes.
However, they provide a powerful
moral requirement and basis for
citizens to act. Principle VII states,
"Complicity in the commission of a
crime against humanity as set forth in
Principle VI is a crime under
international law." Silent citizens or
universities which assist the government
might be considered complicitous.
In 1944 President Franklin
Roosevelt spoke forcefully on the
matter to the German people: "Hitler is
committing these crimes against
humanity in the name of the German
people. I ask every German and every
man everywhere under Nazi
domination to show the world that he
does not share theÂ«e insane criminal
desires. . . 1 ask him also to keep watch,
and to record the evidence that will one
day be used to convict the guilty."
Governments almost never act
against themselves. Unless the citizens
do, there is little hope of terminating
war crimes short of military defeat. In

Nazi Germany citizens took no action
and millions paid the price.
Freedom Of Speech
Freedom of speech, a cornerstone of
the Bill of Rights, has as its purpose the
protection of democratic liberties. It
guarantees to all the right to hear
diverse and unusual views; it guarantees
to each freedom from prosecution for
unpopular views.
Custom and law place certain limits
on speaking rights. A citizen may not
speak at any time and in any volume as,
for example, at midnight with a
loudspeaker und;r a neighbor's
window. However he may not be
limited from speaking frequently on
any subject in a public forum.
In the United States, precedent has
established that freedom of speech may
be abridged when it presents a "clear
and present danger" to the social order.
Specific decisions under this precedent
have been highly controversial.
Nonetheless in particular ways freedom
of speech has been subject to
restriction in the interests of other
purposes. Tomorrow: The Lodge

Following the Second World War,
at tribunals in Nuremberg and Tokyo,
the allied powers tried and convicted
civilian and military leaders of
Germany and Japan for war crimes. In
1945, on the initiative of the United
States, the General Assembly of the
United Nations affirmed unanimously
"the principles of international law
recognized by the Charter of the
Nuremberg Tribunal."
In 1950 the International Law
Commission of the United Nations
formulated the Principles of Nuremberg
which offer the most complete set of
guidelines presently available on the
relationship between personable
responsibility and war crimes. When
the speech of Henry Cabot Lodge was
disturbed last spring the issue emerged
of competing obligations of citizens to
the Nuremberg Principles and to the
Principle of freedom of speech. Partly
ecause of his participation in this
event Professor Bruce Franklin now
faces dismissal. This article (Part two of
which will appear tomorrow), will
explore some of the relationships
between free speech and the
Nuremberg Principles. It is the
contention of this article that the
disrupters of the Lodge speech acted in
concert with the Nuremberg Principles
and hence have a partial if not
complete defense.
It is equally contended that the
University Administration and many of
its supporters, by failing to recognize
obligations under the Nuremberg
Principles, have not met their
responsibilities as citizens and have
inaccurately and unfairly restricted the
scope of the case.
Nurembe.g Principles
Certain of the Nuremberg Principles
are germane to this discussion. Principle
II states, "The fact that internal law
does not impose a penalty for an act
which constitutes a crime under
international law does not relieve the
person who committed the act from

responsibility under international law."
This principle establishes the
supremacy of international
responsibility over national law.
Principle 111 states, "The fact that a
person who committed an act which
constitutes a crime under international
law acted as head of state or
responsible government official does
not relieve him from responsibility
under international law." This principle
applies to the actions of Henry Cabot
Lodge as a member of the government
and a responsible official in Vietnam.
His role has now been well established
by the Pentagon Papers.
Principle IV states, "The fact that a
person acted pursuant to an order of
his government or of a superior does
not relieve him from responsibility
under international law, provided a
moral choice was in fact possible for
him." This principle establishes that
each person in government and the
military is responsible directly for his
actions or inactions
The Crimes In Vienam
Under Principle VI of Nuremberg
certain crimes are identified as
punishable under international law.
These include a) planning, preparation,
initiation or waging of a war of
aggression or participation in a
common plan or conspiracy for the
accomplishment of the above and b)
violations of the laws or customs of a
war which include, but are not limited
to, murder, ill treatment of civilians, ill
treatment or murder of prisoners of
war, killing of hostages, plunder of
public or private property, wanton
destruction of cities, towns or villages,
or devastation not justified by military
necessity.
It is now established that the United
States has commited at least some of
these crimes in Vietnam. It is also clear
that, though he has yet to be found
guilty in court, Henry Cabot Lodge had
a deep personal involvement in the
actions defined as war crimes above.

The Nuremberg Principles do not
specifically delineate the
responsibilities of private citizens or
institutions when confronted with a
government guilty of war crimes.
However, they provide a powerful
moral requirement and basis for
citizens to act. Principle VII states,
"Complicity in the commission of a
crime against humanity as set forth in
Principle VI is a crime under
international law." Silent citizens or
universities which assist the government
might be considered complicitous.
In 1944 President Franklin
Roosevelt spoke forcefully on the
matter to the German people: "Hitler is
committing these crimes against
humanity in the name of the German
people. I ask every German and every
man everywhere under Nazi
domination to show the world that he
does not share theÂ«e insane criminal
desires. . . 1 ask him also to keep watch,
and to record the evidence that will one
day be used to convict the guilty."
Governments almost never act
against themselves. Unless the citizens
do, there is little hope of terminating
war crimes short of military defeat. In

Nazi Germany citizens took no action
and millions paid the price.
Freedom Of Speech
Freedom of speech, a cornerstone of
the Bill of Rights, has as its purpose the
protection of democratic liberties. It
guarantees to all the right to hear
diverse and unusual views; it guarantees
to each freedom from prosecution for
unpopular views.
Custom and law place certain limits
on speaking rights. A citizen may not
speak at any time and in any volume as,
for example, at midnight with a
loudspeaker und;r a neighbor's
window. However he may not be
limited from speaking frequently on
any subject in a public forum.
In the United States, precedent has
established that freedom of speech may
be abridged when it presents a "clear
and present danger" to the social order.
Specific decisions under this precedent
have been highly controversial.
Nonetheless in particular ways freedom
of speech has been subject to
