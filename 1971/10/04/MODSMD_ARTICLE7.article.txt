## Trial Reflects Despair Of Society

An inescapable sense of dispair and frustration
overwhelmed the atmosphere of Physics Room 101. The
trial of H. Bruce Franklin, Ph.D., scholar-revolutionary of
Melville and Marx, inched along into its fourth installment.
Nothing seemed to fit precisely. Prosecution attorney
Ray Fisher, modish and mustached, posed carefully
researched questions with an enthusiasm that often
accompanies divorce cases: in one instance a man and his
wife; in this instance a man and his career.
Defendant-defense attorney Franklin appeared to view the
proceedings as one in which the legitimacy of the charge,
not he, was on trial. Even the seating of the nine-member
Advisory Board was lopsided: chairman Donald Kennedy,
biologist forced into the role of public tribune, was in
uh.>ymmptric seat number six, not five, a physical setting
that justified pathetic fallacy.
Spectators also reflected an uncomfortable ease as they
sat and conscientiously paid attention to the repetitious,
minutely detailed, objection overruled, objection sustained
sounds that came from the front of the amphitheater-like
classroom. Those who had brought themselves to hear cute
or outlandish remarks were occasionally gratified. Students
of the proceedings, antiseptically removed from the
passions of the case, efficiently jotted down testimony they
considered impressive. KZSU reporters worked hard to
provide background on the testimony to listeners who
might have abandoned their radios for a much-needed
escapist venture outdoors.
Here it was, October 2, 1971. A trial nobody wanted
was somehow in irreversible progress on a beautiful autumn
afternoon.
It is a reporter's credo to strive for objectivity in his
task. If he plans to condemn anyone or anything, he ought
to stick to pretty safe ones, like Atilla the Hun or the
Internal Revenue Service. But upon watching this legislative

scenario run its course—each party oh so predictably
playing its fated role, I cannot but condemn the mildew
that has somehow soured the course of democratic values
at this University and, macrocosmically, this nation. For
me, the verdict of this hearing has appeared before.
The verdict was announced when the war on poverty
failed. It was announced when the Peace Corps became
inert in its bureaucratic steelwool. It was announced when
Senator Gravel had to read the Pentagon Papers by
midnight light and midnight tears. It was announced when
Carswell became a nominee to the Supreme Court. It was
announced when Hoffman denounced Hoffman in the
courtroom of Chicago.
Somehow the flickering notion of making America a
good place to live, of making the University a good place to
learn has begun to smoulder. Nobody—not the
administrator in his effort to retain calm and order to his
charge, not the professor in his effort to make silent truths
known—has been able to reignite that notion. In this sense,
no matter what the verdict, both sides of this hearing will
be losers. "Franklin Out, Order Upheld.' "Franklin Stays,
Trustees Resign." Pick a headline.
If these hearings accomplish anything, they must remind
us of how we are losing against time in trying to put this
Humpty Dumpty society back together. We must formulate
reasonable strategies to avoid this type of hassle, this
hearing that serves only to delay us in rebuilding, not
redecorating, misplaced social goals. If these hearings result
in only a verdict, with no advice for avoiding future
"Faculty Advisory Hearings," then the sense of frustration,
of time, money, and energy wasted, will not dissipate. The
hearing verdict of H. Bruce Franklin will just be another
verdict that, like before, reaffirms our dangerous position
of stagnancy to the problems of our society.
