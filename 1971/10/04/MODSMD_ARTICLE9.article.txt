# SJC Reform And Student Selection
## 
### DOUG McHENRY 
One of the most important items on
the Council of President's agenda for
the coming year is an attempt at
much-needed SJC Charter reform. Last
Spring quarter two events occurred
which have particular relevancy to this
effort.
The first event concerns the SJC
resolution which the student body
decisively passed directing the
Committee of Fifteen to make
proposals reflecting outlined student

reservations concerning the present
judicial system.
The second event was the ASSU
Senate refusal to appoint student
members to the SJC Selection
Committee. This is important because
according to the SJC Charter the
process of selecting new students to sit
on the SJC cannot begin until the
ASSU Senate takes this action, and by
logical extension the present SJC does
not exist or cannot begin to function
until this process is completed.
The following is a letter which
reflects my own feelings on the matter.
It was written in response to letters
which I have received from the
administration expressing their concern
that the proper ASSU Senate actions
take place, in order that the present
SJC system of justice can begin to
function again, as soon as possible.
It is my policy that all
correspondence between myself and
the administration is public
information and can be viewed by any
student or for that matter any member
of the community at any time.
Mr. Richard W. Lyman, President of
Stanford University
Mr. John J. Schwartz, Special Assistant
to the President
Gentlemen:
As you may know, technically
neither the ASSU President nor the
Chairman of the ASSU Senate can
force the Senate to entertain any
particular item of business. As part of
the democratic concept of "balance of
power" inherent in the ASSU
Constitution, the ASSU Senate
maintains exclusive control over its
agenda.
Due to the lateness in the quarter
and the apparent priority the Senate
attached to this matter, the SJC
Student Selection Committee, which
only the Senate can appoint, was never
considered last Spring quarter.
However, I have taken immediate steps
to contact the Chairman of that body,
and have requested him to convene a
special meeting of the ASSU Summer
Senate to consider this problem, thus
fulfilling any responsibilities relating to
my office in this matter.
However, I feel I would be
neglecting my responsibilities if I let
this letter end without making the

following comments of student
concern. As you should recall, last
spring the student body passed by an
overwhelming margin a referendum
regarding the SJC. The results clearly
show that a significant portion of the
student body feel the present judicial
system is both inequitable and
unacceptable for the following reasons:
a. Defendants are not being judged
by their peers. Contrary to the
statements when the SJC was
formed, only students have been
subjected to its jurisdiction whereas
faculty and students sit as judges.
b. Individual rights guaranteed by
the Constitutions of both the
United States and the State of
California are not guaranteed, e.g.
students may be subjected to

double jeopardy in that they may
be tried by the SJC as well as by the
civil and criminal courts.
c. The power of the University
President is unchecked. Under the
present charter, he has the power to
overrule or modify the decisions of
the SJC on the authority of his
discretion alone.
I must, in all candor, state that the
Administration's fervor and efforts to
try "a substantial number of cases
already pending before the SJC" stands
in stark contrast to its representatives
seeming recalcitrance to pursue the
substantial reforms expressed by the
student body which I have outlined
above. It is disturbing that the letters I
have received from your office have
only dealt with implementing the
procedures necessary to continue the
present inequitable system and have
not in any way mentioned or indicated
a willingness on your part to comply or
even explore the aforementioned
desires of the student body.
Procedurally, of course, the

Committee of Fifteen must propose
amendments to the Stanford Judicial
Charter, and to date the Committee has
failed to propose any substantive
reforms. Whereas three members of
that Committee are your personal
representatives and whereas your
influence might weigh most heavily
with many other members of the
Committee, I ask you to join with me
and other representatives of the
Student Body to pursue in earnest the
development of a more equitable and
expeditious system of justice for the
Stanford community.
The issue of SJC Charter reform, or
in essence the development of the kind
of legal system that would be just to
the members of the Stanford Student
Body, or others who might be involved

fOMIkNOTES

is an important one. Students can help
initiate its development by electing
student representatives who are
interested in reforming the SJC in the
coming Senate elections and by urging
members of the Committee of Fifteen
and president Lyman's office that this
is a matter which must be settled in the
coming year. A list of Committee of
Fifteen members is available in the
ASSU office.
Again we all must participate in the
creation of a more equitable system of
justice than the present one, if
mandates from the student community
such as last spring's charge to theC-15,
are to mean anything, they must be
acted upon by all of us.
