# State Assembly To Debate Campus Presidents' Power
## 
### DAVID THIEMANN 
A bill which would permit college
presidents to bar from campuses the
people they feel a threat to campus
order will be considered today before
the State Assembly Criminal Justice
Committee.
Senate Bill 818 states that a
university president may bar from a
campus any "person or persons who
have committed or who it reasonably
appears to the chief executive officer
may commit on campus, acts
prejudicial to the order and safety of
the private college."
It provides misdemeanor penalties of
a $250 fine and/or six months in jail
for violators.
Introduced by State Senator Clark
Bradley, R-San Jose, the addition to
the Education Code has already passed
the Senate on a 22-1 vote, but will
encounter stronger opposition in the
Assembly Committee.
Bradley originally advanced the
legislation at the request of Pepperdine
University administrators, along with
officials from "two or three other
colleges" which he would not identify.
He was also unwilling to explain
how he received the request from
Pepperdine, a Los Angeles school.
Should Pass
Neither Bradley nor Pepperdine Vice
president Charles Runnels anticipates
serious opposition to the bill in the
Committee or on the Assembly floor.
Runnels commented that "I don't
think the bill is very strong," while
Bradley would be "very surprised" if
the bill were defeated.
Runnels asserted that this legislation
would enable Pepperdine, an
"independent Christian college," io
maintain "internal discipline" without
resorting to injunctions and other court
proceedings, similar to those used here
during Spring 1971.
Both Stanford President Richard
Lyman and the Council of Presidents
disagree. They support the process of
obtaining court injunctions against
disruptive persons though members of
the Council were critical of Lyman's
decision to obtain one last Spring.
But although Lyman has expressed

opposition to the bill, he indicated that
he would support legislation extending
to private institutions Education Code
provisions punishing the disruption of
public school classes and meetings, and
that he would encourage legislation
making criminal trespass statutes
available to university administrators,
without the cumbersome legal process
now required.
Diamond Speaks Out
Larry Diamond, representing the
ASSU Council of Presidents, has
condemned the bill as
''unconstitutional. . .
unnecessary. . .(and) an invitation to
the violent fringe elements on campus."
In a letter to the Assembly committee,
the Council of Presidents asserted that
the provisions of the bill "assume an
arbitrariness that resembles the worst
kind of dictatorship."
Diamond will testify today against
the bill before the Committee.
While Runnels and Bradley do not
expect a constitutional challenge to the
pending bill, should it become law, the
Council of Presidents indicated that it
would support any effort to invalidate
the bill in the courts.
Law professor Anthony Amsterdam,
after reading a copy of the bill,
suggested that it could be challenged as
void either for vagueness, or because it
imposes an impermissable prior
restraint upon the exercise of free
speech.
Both of these potential objections
are tenable only if the university in
question assumes some of the aspects
of a "company town," and with this
status is bound by some of the
constitutional restraints imposed on
government. If the issue is viewed
merely as a trespass case, the only
possible objection would be that the
legislation delegates an unreasonable
amount of the government's authority
to private individuals.
According to Amsterdam, the law as
written is susceptible to three
interpretations: 1) a decision to bar an
individual from a campus, if made by a
college president, cannot be challenged
in court; 2) the exclusion order could
be challenged and reversed in a civil

proceeding, but cannot be presented as
a defense for an individual violating the
exclusion order; 3) the exclusion order
itself can be challenged in a criminal
trial, and its validity may be raised as
an issue in defense. Bradley, author of
the bill, says he intended the third
interpretation. There is a similar statute
now on the books which authorizes
state college and university officials to
bar individuals from their campuses,
but it does not delegate the sweeping,
more unregulated powers assigned to
administrators in the present bill.
