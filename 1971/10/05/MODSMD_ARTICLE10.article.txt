North Carolina's Daily Tar
Heel, winner of last week's Most
Efficacious Editorial, is presenting
its own awards. The best to date is
"The Sissy and Delilah Award,"
going to UNC Football coach who
explained to his players that,
"'Hie only people who have long
hair are women and
HOMOSEXUALS."
More on the Porcenity beat:
the Tar Heel's "Oh Dad, Poor
Dad" Award goes to Lester
Maddox for finger lickin' good

William Sorum of the Tulane
Catholic Center, cited current
research on monkeys which
proves our hairy primate
counterparts do not develop
normally without a caring
relationship early in life.
Sorum said this research is
easily applicable to man. Sorum's
seminar, "The Challenges of
Love," will presumably trek to
the New Orleans Zoo for its first
field trip. Welcome to the Monkey
House!
