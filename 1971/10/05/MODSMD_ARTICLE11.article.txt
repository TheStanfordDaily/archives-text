staff complaint
Editor, THE DAILY:
Why do employees need a
grievance procedure? We seek
satisfactory working conditions
on the job, equitable wages,
protection against unfair policies,
protection against arbitrary
application of policy- in a word
we seek job satisfaction and job
security.
Historically, grievance
procedures were developed by
labor to protect itself against the
overwhelming power of the
employer. Traditionally, workers,
through their union, write the
grievance policies and mechanics,
submit them to management and
reach agreement through
collective bargaining or through
strikes.
At Stanford, the reverse is true.
The administration determines the
policies. The administration
do fines the ground rules. The
administration writes the
mechanics of the procedure.
Employees are permitted criticism
after the fact. We remain
powerless and at the mercy of a
'' paternalistic," "benevolent"
master. Thus the historical role
and purpose of the grievance
procedure is effectively negated.
Workers can be charged,
judged, punished even fired before
the administration decides
whether a grievance exists and
whether a hearing will be granted.
However, "No hearing will be
granted" in the basis that "a
University rule is inadvisable or
unfair. . Workers are left
defenseless and without funds
before and during adjudication
and decision. Many, in the past,
have been forced onto welfare to
sustain themselves and families.
Tne dollar cost of this harsh
procedure is borne by the
taxpayers in the community. How
can Stanford rationalize such
gross injustice? Even Stanford
Hospital has changed its rules so
that no worker is punished and
deprived of his livelihood before
completion of grievance
procedures.
Workers who have been treated
unfairly have the option of: abject
submission due to hopelessness or
fear; quitting in despair . and
frustration; using ombudswoman
Amsterdam whose informal role is
ambiguous and limited or using a
grievance procedure written by
the University that does not
protect workers. Was it written to
protect the University against
'"troublemakers?"
Employees will secure job
satisfaction and job security only
when united in a strong

University-wide union. Only then
will we have the power to write a
grievance procedure that will
protect us. Only then will we have
the power to interpret and to
enforce it. Until then, employee
groups such as United Stanford
Employees, Alianza Latino, Black
Action Caucus can wrest
concessions from the University
by taking the issues to the people
in the community. With their
understanding and support we will
be able to win equity for workers

delts again
Editor, THE DAILY:
I want to take issue with the
quotation of Tim McClure's
regarding the Delta Tau Delta
house as a "center for numbing
insensitivity and just plain
dumbness."
My first contact with the Delts
was when I wrote their former
president Bill Hagbom, now a
medical student, whom I came to
know and respect, in protest
regarding the David Harris
hair-shaving incident, which',
initiated a good deal of
soul-searching within the house.
Subsequently, I have become
acquainted with many of the
Delts and have had a number of
discussions in the house about
social issues and personal growth.
I spoke to members of the
house about some of my
experiences as a consultant to the
Youth Authority. The Delts
subsequently took in a former
ward of the Youth Authority. He
lived in the Delt house for a

couple of years while attending
Foothill College. He now is a
student at Stanford. He was
treated with great kindness by the
members of the fraternity, and
the experience was extremely
helpful. Another young man from
the Youth Authority is currently
in the house.
I have found many jocks as
sensitive, perceptive, aware and
compassionate as more hip types,
some of whom seem to be more
concerned with humanity as an
abstraction that with human
beings. I think the statements
attributed to Mr. McClure, who I
understand was not a Delt,
exemplify the sort of stereotypic
thinking characteristic of bias in
general (though 1 certainly share
some of his concerns about
organized athleticism and the
traditional fraternity system)
