It's hard work being the Youth
of America and the Hope of
Tomorrow, and nobody should
know it better than us
d i r ty -com m i e-h ip p ie- no -good
punk-students.
Gee whiz, it's not easy being
the Establishment's boogieman
and the scourge of the military
industrial complex when all we
really want is a nice home in the
suburbs where we can settle down
and raise a family. (Huh?)
But "they" have to have an
enemy to feel secure and we
youth are "it," so it's up to us to
do our part for paranoia.
And it is kind of exciting for a
"nice" girl from a
crabgrass-growing, PTA-going
suburb to know that I personally
threaten the American Way of
Life and Everything We (they)
Ever Fought For or Believed In.
Wow. Aud probably Family, Home
and Church, too.Fa rout.
I take generational conflict
very seriously, being a sort of
one-woman gap.
Every morning when I wake up
1 sing three hearty choruses of
Vive Los Huevos before slurping
my Counter-culture Cornflakes
9:55 on a weekday morning at
White Plaza is an experience that
would spook Abbie Hoffman and
uncurl Ronald Reagan's hair.
"Cells, Organisms and Society"
pours out of Dinkelspiel and
"Behavior As Adaptation" pours
in. 5,000 bicycles converge on the
Post Office, each desperate rider
aiming for the six-inch asphalt
ramp with bloodlust in his eyes
and a song in his heart.
The Mad Cyclist (rumored to

be a junior philosophy major from
Pasadena) streaks down the hill in
back of the Ruth Wattis Mitchell
Earth Sciences Building, runs
down four unfortunate freshmen
and a slow-witted graduate
student, and pedals madly
through Meyer Library on his way
to farrest Wilbur.
And I hack my way through
the crowd with my bicycle chain,
stopping for meaningful
communication with a friend here
or there.

" Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaugh. . .Oh,
sorry sir."
He was very understanding
"Quite all right. Hummer. Bad
trip. Dullsville."
"Downer, sir."
"Far out," he beamed.
"Groovy. Hep cat. Power to the
people."
"Raht awn," 1 replied in my
best lower middle-class Souther or
maybe even (oh raptures) Black
accent.
