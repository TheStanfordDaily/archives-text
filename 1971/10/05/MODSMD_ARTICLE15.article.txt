## Peace & Freedom 
### 
Paul loeb

"The Stanford Communisty
For Peace & Freedom" is an
organization created to provide
people with a mass based, loosely
organized and decentralized
framework within which they can
participate in ongoing radical
activities in the Stanford area,
engage in electoral politics in a
manner that educates people as to
the contradictions of the two
major political parties, and
initiate new projects and actions.
People work toward radical
change through many different
methods and at many different
levels. The movement must
recognize that people are
individual human beings, and not
just objects to be moved. Just as
people cannot be coerced into
participating in actions, an open

mass organization cannot try to
enforce a binding discipline or
uniform position on its members.
This organization will not try to
do so.
What is needed is a united
front on basic issues and a
realization that radicals working
on different projects at different
levels are still working for the
same basic goals. Governments
should serve the people and not
rule them; nations have the right
to determine their own future
without U.S. interference; people
possess certain basic human rights
which cannot be denied by an
economic system which serves
only an elite group; economic
systems should serve all the
people justly; no race or sex is
superior to any other, and people

should be treated accordingly and
given freedom to express their
own identity, individually or
communally. When people work
on different projects under one
mass organization thev will be
able to learn from each other and
achieve a better understanding of
the relationships between their
actions and their goals. If a
situation came up where all the
movement groups on this campus
needed to work together (as in the
case of a strike) an existing open
mass organization would prove an
effective vehicle for
communication.
Peace & Freedom Party is part
of a national coalition of groups
and parties which will run a
united 4th party candidate in '72.
It is a loose coalition as none of
these parties are under central
control and most place primary
emphasis on community
organizing activities.
There are several ideas for areas
in which work could be done.
Campus actions can focus on
university complicity in the
Indochinese War and other
imperialist ventures through
research, land-use, and investment
policies, as well as its repression of
forces attempting to change the
basic class bias motivation of the
university. There are many groups
working on many different
projects in this area as well as the
need for extension of basic
constitutional rights (including
some degree of electoral
self-government) to Stanford
students and others living on
campus.
There are several groups
working on building
counterinstitutions in the Palo
Alto area and they are badly in
need of help. People can also
work in electoral politics by
running candidates representative
of our local communities and by
helping to organize or raise money
for the ballot drives of other
states which will need outside
help to get on the ballot.
California Peace & Freedom is
aiso working on a state initiative
that would eliminate the capital
gains tax loophole. All of these
are or can be on-going activities
which Stanford Community for
Peace & Freedom can and will
work on. au / /, oc £ ; s trying to

"The Stanford Communisty
For Peace & Freedom" is an
organization created to provide
people with a mass based, loosely
organized and decentralized
framework within which they can
participate in ongoing radical
activities in the Stanford area,
engage in electoral politics in a
manner that educates people as to
the contradictions of the two
major political parties, and
initiate new projects and actions.
People work toward radical
change through many different
methods and at many different
levels. The movement must
recognize that people are
individual human beings, and not
just objects to be moved. Just as
people cannot be coerced into
participating in actions, an open

mass organization cannot try to
enforce a binding discipline or
uniform position on its members.
This organization will not try to
do so.
What is needed is a united
front on basic issues and a
realization that radicals working
on different projects at different
levels are still working for the
same basic goals. Governments
should serve the people and not
rule them; nations have the right
to determine their own future
without U.S. interference; people
possess certain basic human rights
which cannot be denied by an
economic system which serves
only an elite group; economic
systems should serve all the
people justly; no race or sex is
superior to any other, and people

should be treated accordingly and
given freedom to express their
own identity, individually or
communally. When people work
on different projects under one
mass organization thev will be
able to learn from each other and
achieve a better understanding of
the relationships between their
actions and their goals. If a
situation came up where all the
movement groups on this campus
needed to work together (as in the
case of a strike) an existing open
mass organization would prove an
effective vehicle for
communication.
Peace & Freedom Party is part
of a national coalition of groups
and parties which will run a
united 4th party candidate in '72.
It is a loose coalition as none of
these parties are under central
control and most place primary
emphasis on community
organizing activities.
There are several ideas for areas
in which work could be done.
Campus actions can focus on
university complicity in the
Indochinese War and other
imperialist ventures through
research, land-use, and investment
policies, as well as its repression of
forces attempting to change the
basic class bias motivation of the
university. There are many groups
