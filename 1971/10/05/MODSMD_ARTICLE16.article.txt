## Labedz Writes Solzhenitsyn Saga 
### MADISON GROSE 
Noted authority on Eastern
European ideology and
intellectual thought, Leopold
Labedz is a visiting professor at
Stanford for the Fall Quarter, and
will be instructing both
undergraduate and graduate
colloquia on the topic of
"Literature and Revolution."
In December of this year he
will also assist in directing a major
research conference and seminar
at Stanford, which will concern
itself with "Literature and Politics
in the Soviet Union and Eastern
Europe."
Co-sponsored by Stanford's
Center for Russian and East
European Studies and the
International Association of
Cultural Freedom, Labedz will
continue to edit, expand and
formulate long-term editorial
arrangements for tne publication
Survey, a Journal of East and
West Studies. Labedz has been
editor of the London-based
quarterly (Oxford University
Press) since 1966.
New Board
In conjunction with the
journal's newly acquired
international advisory board,
Labedz will increase the scope and
content of the Survey.
The board includes three
eminent Stanford faculty
members: Ivo J. Lederer, professor
of history and director of
Stanford's Center for Russian and
East European Studies; John W.
Lewis, professor of political
science, and Mark Mancall,
associate professor of history.
Labedz has studied at the
Universities of Warsaw, Paris,
Bologna and London, taking his
post-graduate work at the London
School of Economics. A
contributing editor to Encounter
magazine and author of numerous
books and articles, Labedz holds a
membership in the British Royal
Institute for International Affairs.

He has recently published a
most revealing work concerning
the continuous struggle of Russian
writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn. It
is entitled, Solzhenitsyn: A
Documentary Record
The new S t anford
collaboration with Survey will
also include a series of regular
seminars and international
conferences to be held on the
Campus.
Fecund Novelist
Alexander Solzhenitsyn is
considered by mahy to be the
most fecund Russian novelist of
the twentieth century. Such
chillingly vivid novels as One Day
in the Life of Ivan Denisovich and
Cancer Ward have demonstrated
the talent of this exceptional
artist and thinker.
His literary integrity and
philosophical liberalism however
has enraged the neo-Stalinists
currently ruling the Soviet Union.
In December, 19 70 the literary
world awarded Solzhenitsyn its
most coveted honor, the Nobel
Prize for literature. He has yet to
receive his award.
Dr. Leopold Labedz, visiting
Stanford professor and noted
authority on Soviet affairs, tells
the following story as to why
Solzhenitsyn now faces perhaps
his greatest degradation and
humiliation
When the Academy in

Stockholm announced the
bestowal of the Nobel Prize on
Solzhenitsyn, the literary world
reverberated with applause. A
man truly deserving of the award
had received it. There was little to
contest.
However, twenty-five miles
west of Moscow, a solitary man
exiled within his own nation,
alone amongst his own people,
knew nothing of the proceedings.
For several days thereafter, as
news slowly seeped through the
porous walls of Soviet society,
Alexander Solzhenitsyn refused to
believe the unbelievable.
Regardless of radio reports, he
remained adamant.
'State of Health'
In a letter to the Swedish
Academy, Solzhenitsyn stated his
intentions of going to Stockholm
to receive the prize. He also
claimed that his state of helath
would not impair his travel to
Sweden. (The Soviet government
has refused to allow travel abroad
to her undesireables citing "state
of health" at the reason for their
incarceration within Russian
boundaries).
Later, Solzhenitsyn changed
his mind, knowing full well that
he might be barred re-admittance
to his homeland if he left.
Sometime later Solzhenitsyn
came up with an alternative
proposal. Namely, he decided that

rather than go to Stockholm, he
would receive the award and make
his acceptance speech at the
Swedish embassy in Moscow.
But, to quote Dr. Labedz,
Gunnar Jarring, the Swedish
ambassador to Moscow, refused to
"receive him, even to meet him."
Western observors were incensed
by tliis callous and seemingly
meaningless refusal of
Solzhenitsyn by Jarring.
Western Outrage
As Western outrage surged,
Jarring was shaken from
complacency and finally conceded
to meet with Solzhenitsyn for
fifteen minutes. Solzhenitsyn,
who has so often been belittled
and ridiculed, calmly accepted the
supercilious behavior of the
Swedish ambassador. He did,
however, make one further small
request of Jarring. He wanted an
invitation from the embassy, as
uninvited entry into the embassy
is difficult because of KGB
security guards posted at the
entrance. In this he was once
again refused.
In a series of articles the New
York Times has questioned the
motives of both Jarring and the
Swedish government for such
ambivalent behaviour. One
possible motive for Jarring has
been a professional one.
Secretary General of the U.N.,
U Thant plans to retire this year
and several international figures
are being considered to replace
him.
Jarring's Interests
Jarring, a world acknowledged
mediator and diplomat, is one of
those figures, and Soviet approval
of his nomination would be
imperative to his receiving the
appointment.
While a Jarring-Solzhenitsyn
conference might not have
damaged Swedish-Soviet relations,
it might surely have impaired
Jarring-Soviet relations. The
inference is clear.
Alexander Solzhenitsyn has
been treated with shoddy and
arrogant contempt, but with one
marked difference. Now a Western
diplomat and a Western nation
have ostracized him from the
recognition and acclaim he
deserves.
A man without a home seems
to have become a man without a
world, or so it must appear to
Solzhenitsyn. He joins a long list
of other artisis and geniuses who
have experienced little but
abundant misery within their
lifetimes.
Dr. Labedz concludes liis story
with an inexorable trace of
bitterness on his lips, and the
flasiiing eyes of a man who knows
porfound hatred and pain.
"Jarring," he said, "will be
remembered not as the Secretary
General of the U.N., or as a
go-between the Israelis and the
Arabs, but as the man who
refused to confer the Nobel Prize
on Solzhenitsyn."
