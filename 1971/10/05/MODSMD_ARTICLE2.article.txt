# John Keilch Hearing Continues
## 
### BOB BACON 
Stanford library employee John
Keilch, fired for alleged participation in
the April 9 Stanford Hospital sit-in
continues this week to present his case
for reinstatement to a three-man
grievance committee. In hearings last
Thursday and yesterday, he questioned
three University Administrators
regarding both the sit-in and University
employment practices in general.
The hearing continues Thursday at
1:30 p.m. in Room 82 of the business
school. Keilch is attempting to
subpoena Vice Provost Robert
Rosenzweig to answer questions about
the Administration's role in breaking
up the sit-in and ordering Keilch's
dismissal. Kenneth Dunkle, hospital
personnel officer, is also scheduled to
testify. The proceeding is expected to
conclude after Thursday's session, the
eig'.th to be held since August 19.
Keilch is employing a two-pronged
argument to win back his job. He
contends that "unacceptable behavior,"
for which he was fired, is an overbroad,
abnormal, and unprecedented ground
for dismissal; and he insists that his
behavior at the Hospital must be
considered in the context of the alleged
racist practices at the Medical Center
which prompted the sit-in.
Last Thursday's proceedings opened
with questioning of outgoing University
Personnel Director Robert M. Nelson,
who fired Keilch last June 22. Keilch
grilled Nelson regarding minority hiring

practices at the University, and at one
point accused the administrator of
"unacceptable behavior" for not doing
enough to combat racism at Stanford.
Nelson said that, so far as he knew,
Keilch and the four others fired after
the Hospital sit-in were the first
Stanford employees ousted for
"unacceptable behavior" not directly
related to their regular jobs. Keilch
then argued that, contrary to Nelson's
earlier testimony, the Administration
took an unprecedented step in firing
him on those grounds.
Nelson then testified that the
existence of "unacceptable behavior"
as grounds for dismissal was standard
practice both locally and nationwide, at
which point Keilch introduced two
personnel management textbooks
which stated that the use of specific
grounds for dismissal was the accepted
method, and that the use of categories
such as "unacceptable behavior" and
"misconduct" had fallen out of favor.
Nelson was followed on the stand
Thursday by John L. Wilson, Acting
Dean of the Medical School at the time
of the sit-in. His testimony continued
yesterday. Wilson discussed the events
surrounding the sit-in, and Keilch also
questioned him about institutional
racism at the Medical Center.
At one point Thursday, Wilson
testified that he was not aware of
specific instances of racism in the
University or at the Medical Center.
"You must be kidding,"' Keilch
exclaimed.

Yesterday's final ' witness was
Thomas Gonda, Director of Stanford
Hospital, who conducted negotiations
with the demonstrators during the sit-in
last April. Keiich sought to
demonstrate that the police charge in
which he and 30 others were arrested
was not necessary to end the 30-hour
sit-in, and that it constituted an act of
bad faith on the part of the hospital
administrators.
Keilch tangled with both Gonda and
Wilson regarding the definition of the
events at the Hospital. The fired library
worker insisted that labor negotiations
were taking place, while neither
administrator accepted that
characterization, referring instead to an
"occupation" of the Hospital.
Keilch insisted that the sit-in be
viewed in the "context" of the
accusations of institutional racism
made against the Medical Center and
the University. The administration
witnesses viewed the sit-in, which
resulted in 23 injuries and about
$50,000 in property damage, strictly as
an unlawful takeover of University
property.
Gonda testified that negotiations
broke off on the question of whether
grievance procedures for fired
maintenance man Sam Bridges would
precede or follow evacuation of the
Hospital offices by the demonstrators.
Keilch asked the two Hospital
administrators if any positive results
had come from the sit-in. Initially, both
said thev knew of none, but under

questioning both conceded some policy
changes made last spring were related
to the sit-in, although not necessarily
caused by it. Gonda concluded, "We
didn't need the 'ielp," defending his
role in improving Medical Center
personnel policies over the last two
years.
Gonda, who had opposed bringing
police to the Hospital to break up the
sit-in, defended his refusal to rehire
Bridges, whose dismissal had
precipitated the sit-in. He said that
Bridges, who had been fired for what
he called "just cause," could not be
"rehired under coercion."
The Grievance committee consists of
Elwood Pierce, Assistant Controller of
the Medical School, Professor of Law
Byron Sher, and Roy Boggs a library
employee.

Keilch insisted that the sit-in be
viewed in the "context" of the
accusations of institutional racism
made against the Medical Center and
the University. The administration
witnesses viewed the sit-in, which
resulted in 23 injuries and about
$50,000 in property damage, strictly as
an unlawful takeover of University
property.
Gonda testified that negotiations
broke off on the question of whether
grievance procedures for fired
maintenance man Sam Bridges would
precede or follow evacuation of the
Hospital offices by the demonstrators.
Keilch asked the two Hospital
administrators if any positive results
had come from the sit-in. Initially, both
said thev knew of none, but under

questioning both conceded some policy
changes made last spring were related
to the sit-in, although not necessarily
caused by it. Gonda concluded, "We
didn't need the 'ielp," defending his
role in improving Medical Center
personnel policies over the last two
years.
Gonda, who had opposed bringing
police to the Hospital to break up the
sit-in, defended his refusal to rehire
Bridges, whose dismissal had
precipitated the sit-in. He said that
Bridges, who had been fired for what
he called "just cause," could not be
"rehired under coercion."
The Grievance committee consists of
Elwood Pierce, Assistant Controller of
the Medical School, Professor of Law
Byron Sher, and Roy Boggs a library
employee.
Stanford library employee John
Keilch, fired for alleged participation in
the April 9 Stanford Hospital sit-in
continues this week to present his case
for reinstatement to a three-man
grievance committee. In hearings last
Thursday and yesterday, he questioned
three University Administrators
regarding both the sit-in and University
employment practices in general.
The hearing continues Thursday at
1:30 p.m. in Room 82 of the business
school. Keilch is attempting to
subpoena Vice Provost Robert
Rosenzweig to answer questions about
the Administration's role in breaking
up the sit-in and ordering Keilch's
dismissal. Kenneth Dunkle, hospital
personnel officer, is also scheduled to
testify. The proceeding is expected to
conclude after Thursday's session, the
eig'.th to be held since August 19.
Keilch is employing a two-pronged
argument to win back his job. He
contends that "unacceptable behavior,"
for which he was fired, is an overbroad,
abnormal, and unprecedented ground
for dismissal; and he insists that his
behavior at the Hospital must be
considered in the context of the alleged
racist practices at the Medical Center
which prompted the sit-in.
Last Thursday's proceedings opened
with questioning of outgoing University
Personnel Director Robert M. Nelson,
who fired Keilch last June 22. Keilch
grilled Nelson regarding minority hiring

practices at the University, and at one
point accused the administrator of
"unacceptable behavior" for not doing
enough to combat racism at Stanford.
Nelson said that, so far as he knew,
Keilch and the four others fired after
the Hospital sit-in were the first
Stanford employees ousted for
"unacceptable behavior" not directly
related to their regular jobs. Keilch
then argued that, contrary to Nelson's
earlier testimony, the Administration
took an unprecedented step in firing
him on those grounds.
Nelson then testified that the
existence of "unacceptable behavior"
as grounds for dismissal was standard
practice both locally and nationwide, at
which point Keilch introduced two
personnel management textbooks
which stated that the use of specific
grounds for dismissal was the accepted
method, and that the use of categories
such as "unacceptable behavior" and
"misconduct" had fallen out of favor.
Nelson was followed on the stand
Thursday by John L. Wilson, Acting
Dean of the Medical School at the time
of the sit-in. His testimony continued
yesterday. Wilson discussed the events
surrounding the sit-in, and Keilch also
questioned him about institutional
racism at the Medical Center.
At one point Thursday, Wilson
testified that he was not aware of
specific instances of racism in the
University or at the Medical Center.
"You must be kidding,"' Keilch
exclaimed.

Yesterday's final ' witness was
Thomas Gonda, Director of Stanford
Hospital, who conducted negotiations
with the demonstrators during the sit-in
last April. Keiich sought to
demonstrate that the police charge in
which he and 30 others were arrested
was not necessary to end the 30-hour
sit-in, and that it constituted an act of
bad faith on the part of the hospital
administrators.
Keilch tangled with both Gonda and
Wilson regarding the definition of the
events at the Hospital. The fired library
worker insisted that labor negotiations
were taking place, while neither
administrator accepted that
characterization, referring instead to an
"occupation" of the Hospital.

practice both locally and nationwide, at
which point Keilch introduced two
personnel management textbooks
which stated that the use of specific
grounds for dismissal was the accepted
method, and that the use of categories
such as "unacceptable behavior" and
"misconduct" had fallen out of favor.
Nelson was followed on the stand
Thursday by John L. Wilson, Acting
Dean of the Medical School at the time
of the sit-in. His testimony continued
yesterday. Wilson discussed the events
surrounding the sit-in, and Keilch also
questioned him about institutional
racism at the Medical Center.
At one point Thursday, Wilson
testified that he was not aware of
specific instances of racism in the
University or at the Medical Center.
"You must be kidding,"' Keilch
exclaimed.

Yesterday's final ' witness was
Thomas Gonda, Director of Stanford
Hospital, who conducted negotiations
with the demonstrators during the sit-in
last April. Keiich sought to
demonstrate that the police charge in
which he and 30 others were arrested
was not necessary to end the 30-hour
sit-in, and that it constituted an act of
bad faith on the part of the hospital
administrators.
Keilch tangled with both Gonda and
Wilson regarding the definition of the
events at the Hospital. The fired library
worker insisted that labor negotiations
were taking place, while neither
administrator accepted that
characterization, referring instead to an
"occupation" of the Hospital.
Keilch insisted that the sit-in be
viewed in the "context" of the
accusations of institutional racism
made against the Medical Center and
the University. The administration
witnesses viewed the sit-in, which
resulted in 23 injuries and about
$50,000 in property damage, strictly as
an unlawful takeover of University
property.
Gonda testified that negotiations
broke off on the question of whether
grievance procedures for fired
maintenance man Sam Bridges would
precede or follow evacuation of the
Hospital offices by the demonstrators.
Keilch asked the two Hospital
administrators if any positive results
had come from the sit-in. Initially, both
said thev knew of none, but under

questioning both conceded some policy
changes made last spring were related
to the sit-in, although not necessarily
caused by it. Gonda concluded, "We
didn't need the 'ielp," defending his
role in improving Medical Center
personnel policies over the last two
years.
Gonda, who had opposed bringing
police to the Hospital to break up the
sit-in, defended his refusal to rehire
Bridges, whose dismissal had
precipitated the sit-in. He said that
Bridges, who had been fired for what
he called "just cause," could not be
"rehired under coercion."
The Grievance committee consists of
Elwood Pierce, Assistant Controller of
the Medical School, Professor of Law
Byron Sher, and Roy Boggs a library
employee.
