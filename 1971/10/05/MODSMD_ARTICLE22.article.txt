A total of 11,17 3 students
registered at Stanford for Fall
Quarter study at the end of the
second day of registration,
University officials reported
Wednesday Sept. 29.
There was a net decline of 8 4
students compared to the same
period last year, said Registrar
Harvey Hall.

Of the total, 8 089 were men, a
decline of 246 , and 3084 were
women, an increase of 162. The
increase in women students was at
both the undergraduate and
graduate level, the figures showed.
Late registrants will bring the
total student body to its usual
11,500 level, Dr. Hall predicted.
