# Garcia, Saunders Impressive At Frost
## 
### PAUL GRUSHKIN 
So when is Jerry Garcia going to do a gig with Booker T.? Or, for
that matter, Lee Michaels? As one friend put it Sunday "It'd be
awfully nice!"
It certainly will be- if they ever get together. But for the present
you'll have to content yourselves with merely excellent music from
Jerry and some of his more unknown organist buddies, to wit Howard
Wales and Merle Saunders.
For those of you who didn't make it to the first Pamoja Jazz
Concert-attended by some 2,000 smiling faces-because it wasn't
Jerry and the Grateful Dead or Jerry and the New Riders .. . shame
on you! Jerry and Merle git it on in fine style.
Big Black and the Bobby Hutcherson-Harold Land Quintet—the
other two featured groups-were equally impressive, particularly Big
Black. The latter offered an impressively powerful conga-drum beat
with a surprisingly mellow lead guitar.
I've not heard their only album, but at Frost there was some very
fine music from the group which played with trumpeter Hugh
Masekela. One song, "If you're diggin' what you're doin', go right on
doin' what you're diggin' " featured warm, flowing vocals.
Saunders' Solo Album
The unknown, Saunders, a native San Franciso organist who played
with Miles Davis, assisted the Dead on their new live LP, and spent
some years as a studio musician, will have his first solo album released
within two weeks.
And guess who's very prominently featured? Jerry Garcia.
The two played a memorable week-long stand last April at the
Matrix, the small San Francisco club where the Jefferson Airplane
first revved up in 1965. Then Saunders was pounding out a rolling,
moving bass accompaniment to Garcia's leaping, twisting blues guitar.
Sunday's presentation was somewhat different; Saunders asserted
himself a bit more. The two seemed to play lead at each other in the
manner of the Dead's personnel—backed up by rhythm guitarist Tom
Fogerty (late of Creedence), drummer Bill Vitt, and bassist Charlie
Conn.
Long, Clear Passages
Saunders would hold one note at length, then work quickly away
down the scale, then return to another note and pound away at it. All
the while Garcia was stringing together long, clear passages that
perfectly complemented Saunders' highest and lowest notes.
The Frost accoustics were simply magnificent, and the volume
ample, rare for the amphitheatre—l was sitting in a direct line to
Saunders' amps and his long notes swelled around me hugely.
By their fourth selection the two were driving away in fine
style-Garcia with his bluesy doodle—oos and Saunders with a
pulsating bass bottom. This jam was especially intriguing; the two
employed an almost comic central theme, working away from it, and
returning to re-define it.
Wailing Away
Garcia's lead guitar was absolutely overpowering, wailing away,
with much of the audience happily dancing and smiling.
Playing gigs away from the Dead and the New Riders is something
new for Garcia in the last year. Long recognized as one of America's
finest rock guitarists, with or without the Dead, he assisted the
Airplane, It's a Beautiful Day, and David Crosby with albums.
After months of work in San Francisco recording studios, Garcia
and organist Howard Wales (who plays on the American Beauty
album) released a 'solo' effort, also utilizing a horn section. Another
Garcia album, though not the Saunders effort, should be released
shortly. He has no plans to tour with either artist.

By their fourth selection the two were driving away in fine
style-Garcia with his bluesy doodle—oos and Saunders with a
pulsating bass bottom. This jam was especially intriguing; the two
employed an almost comic central theme, working away from it, and
returning to re-define it.
Wailing Away
Garcia's lead guitar was absolutely overpowering, wailing away,
with much of the audience happily dancing and smiling.
Playing gigs away from the Dead and the New Riders is something
new for Garcia in the last year. Long recognized as one of America's
finest rock guitarists, with or without the Dead, he assisted the
Airplane, It's a Beautiful Day, and David Crosby with albums.
After months of work in San Francisco recording studios, Garcia
and organist Howard Wales (who plays on the American Beauty
album) released a 'solo' effort, also utilizing a horn section. Another
Garcia album, though not the Saunders effort, should be released
shortly. He has no plans to tour with either artist.

TRUCKIN Jerry Garcia of Grateful Dead fame was one of the
performers in the first Pamoja Jazz Concert on Sunday in Frost
Amnit'ieater. Also on the bill were Merle Saunders, Big Black and the
Bobby Mutcherson-Bobby Land Quintet. On-campus music continues
this weekend with a Friday night concert in Memorial Auditorium
featuring Country Joe McDonald and Dan Hicks and His Hot Licks.
So when is Jerry Garcia going to do a gig with Booker T.? Or, for
that matter, Lee Michaels? As one friend put it Sunday "It'd be
awfully nice!"
It certainly will be- if they ever get together. But for the present
you'll have to content yourselves with merely excellent music from
Jerry and some of his more unknown organist buddies, to wit Howard
Wales and Merle Saunders.
For those of you who didn't make it to the first Pamoja Jazz
Concert-attended by some 2,000 smiling faces-because it wasn't
Jerry and the Grateful Dead or Jerry and the New Riders .. . shame
on you! Jerry and Merle git it on in fine style.
Big Black and the Bobby Hutcherson-Harold Land Quintet—the
other two featured groups-were equally impressive, particularly Big
Black. The latter offered an impressively powerful conga-drum beat
with a surprisingly mellow lead guitar.
I've not heard their only album, but at Frost there was some very
fine music from the group which played with trumpeter Hugh
Masekela. One song, "If you're diggin' what you're doin', go right on
doin' what you're diggin' " featured warm, flowing vocals.
Saunders' Solo Album
The unknown, Saunders, a native San Franciso organist who played
with Miles Davis, assisted the Dead on their new live LP, and spent
some years as a studio musician, will have his first solo album released
within two weeks.
And guess who's very prominently featured? Jerry Garcia.
The two played a memorable week-long stand last April at the
Matrix, the small San Francisco club where the Jefferson Airplane
first revved up in 1965. Then Saunders was pounding out a rolling,
moving bass accompaniment to Garcia's leaping, twisting blues guitar.
Sunday's presentation was somewhat different; Saunders asserted
himself a bit more. The two seemed to play lead at each other in the
manner of the Dead's personnel—backed up by rhythm guitarist Tom
Fogerty (late of Creedence), drummer Bill Vitt, and bassist Charlie
Conn.
Long, Clear Passages
Saunders would hold one note at length, then work quickly away
down the scale, then return to another note and pound away at it. All
the while Garcia was stringing together long, clear passages that
perfectly complemented Saunders' highest and lowest notes.
The Frost accoustics were simply magnificent, and the volume
ample, rare for the amphitheatre—l was sitting in a direct line to
Saunders' amps and his long notes swelled around me hugely.
By their fourth selection the two were driving away in fine
