# Fine Flicks For The Folks
## 
### TODD McCARTHY Second in a two-part series 
Enough fanfare preceded the
release of "Two-Lane Blacktop"
to make it a shoo-in for most
popular film of the year with both
audiences and critics. Not too
many people seem to have seen it,
however, and many critics have
used the film as an easy
opportunity to get their digs in at
Esquire as well, which pre-natally
honored the film for possessing
the best screenplay of the year.
Furthermore, considerable cult
interest was built up around
director Monte Hellman due to
the westerns he made with Jack
Nicholson, though nobody 1 know
has seen them.
Regardless of publicity, no
box-office or cults, "Two-Lane
Blacktop" is quite a movie and
has little or nothing to do with
"Easy Rider," with which it has
often been superficially
compared. Hell man's is a highly
austere, specific work, an exercise
in rigorous self-denial.
Even more than Altman with
"McCabe and Mrs. Miller," who at
least leaves in the traditional
dramatic confrontations and
resolutions, Hellman does not
present a great deal of the vital
action, such as a love scene or an
important drag race, choosing
rather to focus upon the face of
an individual aware of the events
taking place but not actively
involved in them.
Hellman constantly upsets our
dramatic expectations but
fortunately is forceful enough to
make us accept a new framework
he creates to serve his own means,
a framework in which virtually
everything is subtext, in which a
seemingly meaningless void is
truly meaningfully filled with
subtle detail and comment.
Modern Existentialism
Hellman has been called the
American Antonioni and while
both have austerity and inaction
in common, I think the
comparison is basically inapt.
Hellman, with the possible
exception of his film's unsettling
final shot, completely avoids the
pretentiousness for which
Antonioni is so ingloriously
famous. Antonioni strives to make
a point, while Hellman is out to
affirm an attitude, one of truly
modern existentialism.
Furthermore, Antonioni has
never drawn a performance the
likes of which Warren Oates gives
as GTO, a resonantly American
character. James Taylor and
Dennis Wilson seem exactly what
was desired in their parts and
Laurie Bird is an almost

extraordinary amalgamation of all
the empty, petulant yet teasing
faces of so many lost girls of the
late sixties.
"Taking Off" represents by far
the most outstanding American
film debut by a foreign director in
the recent rash of such
phenomena. What's more, the use
of American young people is more
believable than in any more
self-consciously "youth" oriented
films.
Milos Forman, director of
"Loves of a Blonde" and
"Firemens Ball," arrived in New
York from Czechoslovakia
speaking no English and a couple
of years later, with the ominous
assistance of three off-Broadway
playwrights, turned out a film of
brittle brilliance.
The story, a trifling one of
parents' physical and
psychological search for a 15
year-old daughter, again is less
important than the way each
scene is filled with telling detail.
Though several sequences are
uproarious, especially the

black-tie pot party for forty-ish
parents conducted by a
memorably adenoidal wire-haired
freak, Forman's light touch is his
crowning touch.
All the faces in the film are
inplanted irrevocably in the
memory, all the performances are
ripe. Forman's visuals are utterly
uncluttered and economical, being
as clean as fashion photographs in
the musical auditions and
perfectly framed to accommodate
the material in the set-pieces.
A project combining a foreign
director with American youth
with suburbia and Greenwich
Village as locales would normally
promise pretentiousness but to
Forman, human foibles are human
foibles whether in Prague or
Gotham. Forman is consistently
unflattering to all his characters
and it would be tempting to call

his treatment of some cruel. But
he relishes his characters as well
and his unblinking presentation of
them makes everyone an engaging
protagonist.
As a footnote, I'd like to add
that I've seen two ditVerent
versions of "Taking Off." In the
version I saw in Palo Alto, all the
words of the outrageous song,
"Ode to a Screw," remained
intact. In Chicago, a vital
obscenity which is repeated many
times is bleeped out, though no
doubts linger as to the word in
question mainly because of the
exacting lip movements of the
singer.
Actually, the bleeped version is
funnier than the original.
Surprisingly, this does not
represent yet another example of
repression in Chicago, as Universal
apparently has offered either
version for distribution, with
censorship duties left up to each
theatre manager.
"The Touch" opened
Wednesday at the Stanford
Theatre and is the best Ingmar
Bergman film I have ever seen.
Many Bergman purists have
already been shocked by the
master's descent into
commercialdom and while it's
easily his most accessible film, it's
also his most emotionally moving.
Bergman's production of
"Hedda Gabler" with Maggie
Smith in London remains one of
the most exciting theatrical
experiences of my life and"The
Touch" comes closest of all his
films to reproducing that
experience.
In two words, the main reason
for the film's stunning success is
Bibi Andersson, just as Maggie
Smith was essential to Bergman's
production of the Ibsen play.
Andersson's is an extraordinary
examination of a domesticated
woman daring to tread ground
outside her secure home and
marriage for the first time and
rarely have I felt that so many
intense feminine feelings have
been transferred to me across the
sex barrier with so much
emotional accuracy and force
intact.
Complete Character
Bibi Andersson creates a
complete character, one of total
believability, with mature
knowlege and security
accompanied by adolescent
defensiveness and hesitancy. Even
up against the extraordinary
challenge of Jane Fonda in
"Klute," Andersson's is by far the
performance of the year.
Elliott Gould's performance

and even presence on Bergman's
sacred territory has been almost
universally frowned upon.
Basically, 1 think it is the part, not
necessarily the actor, that can
most easily be found
objectionable and it must be
remembered that the conception
was Bergman's. I know people like
this man and can certainly believe
that they might treat women as
thoughtlessly as Gould treats
Andersson.
Furthermore, Bergman
suggests, through his part history
and an encounter with his sister,
that the Gould character is
emotionally disturbed or even
slightly mad (I think the inference
of incest is a bit much), thus
explaining his sudden irrational
turns of mood.
I'm frankly glad to see
Bergman desert his isolated
Swedish island for awhile and deal
with human beings in less abstract
situations. He even travels, briefly,
as far as London in "The Touch."
In the end, though, it's all Bibi,
Bibi, Bibi. . .

memory, all the performances are
ripe. Forman's visuals are utterly
uncluttered and economical, being
as clean as fashion photographs in
the musical auditions and
perfectly framed to accommodate
the material in the set-pieces.
A project combining a foreign
director with American youth
with suburbia and Greenwich
Village as locales would normally
promise pretentiousness but to
Forman, human foibles are human
foibles whether in Prague or
Gotham. Forman is consistently
unflattering to all his characters
and it would be tempting to call

his treatment of some cruel. But
he relishes his characters as well
and his unblinking presentation of
them makes everyone an engaging
protagonist.
As a footnote, I'd like to add
that I've seen two ditVerent
versions of "Taking Off." In the
version I saw in Palo Alto, all the
words of the outrageous song,
"Ode to a Screw," remained
intact. In Chicago, a vital
obscenity which is repeated many
times is bleeped out, though no
doubts linger as to the word in
question mainly because of the
exacting lip movements of the
singer.
Actually, the bleeped version is
funnier than the original.
Surprisingly, this does not
represent yet another example of
repression in Chicago, as Universal
apparently has offered either
version for distribution, with
censorship duties left up to each
theatre manager.
"The Touch" opened
Wednesday at the Stanford
Theatre and is the best Ingmar
Bergman film I have ever seen.
Many Bergman purists have
already been shocked by the
master's descent into
commercialdom and while it's
easily his most accessible film, it's
also his most emotionally moving.
Bergman's production of
"Hedda Gabler" with Maggie
Smith in London remains one of
the most exciting theatrical
experiences of my life and"The
Touch" comes closest of all his
films to reproducing that
experience.
In two words, the main reason
for the film's stunning success is
Bibi Andersson, just as Maggie
Smith was essential to Bergman's
production of the Ibsen play.
Andersson's is an extraordinary
examination of a domesticated
woman daring to tread ground
outside her secure home and
marriage for the first time and
rarely have I felt that so many
intense feminine feelings have
been transferred to me across the
sex barrier with so much
emotional accuracy and force
intact.
Complete Character
Bibi Andersson creates a
complete character, one of total
believability, with mature
knowlege and security
accompanied by adolescent
defensiveness and hesitancy. Even
up against the extraordinary
challenge of Jane Fonda in
"Klute," Andersson's is by far the
performance of the year.
Elliott Gould's performance

and even presence on Bergman's
sacred territory has been almost
universally frowned upon.
Basically, 1 think it is the part, not
necessarily the actor, that can
most easily be found
objectionable and it must be
remembered that the conception
was Bergman's. I know people like
this man and can certainly believe
that they might treat women as
thoughtlessly as Gould treats
Andersson.
Furthermore, Bergman
suggests, through his part history
and an encounter with his sister,
that the Gould character is
emotionally disturbed or even
slightly mad (I think the inference
of incest is a bit much), thus
explaining his sudden irrational
turns of mood.
I'm frankly glad to see
Bergman desert his isolated
Swedish island for awhile and deal
with human beings in less abstract
situations. He even travels, briefly,
as far as London in "The Touch."
In the end, though, it's all Bibi,
Bibi, Bibi. . .


Bibi Andersson
Enough fanfare preceded the
release of "Two-Lane Blacktop"
to make it a shoo-in for most
popular film of the year with both
audiences and critics. Not too
many people seem to have seen it,
however, and many critics have
used the film as an easy
opportunity to get their digs in at
Esquire as well, which pre-natally
honored the film for possessing
the best screenplay of the year.
Furthermore, considerable cult
interest was built up around
director Monte Hellman due to
the westerns he made with Jack
Nicholson, though nobody 1 know
has seen them.
Regardless of publicity, no
box-office or cults, "Two-Lane
Blacktop" is quite a movie and
has little or nothing to do with
"Easy Rider," with which it has
often been superficially
compared. Hell man's is a highly
austere, specific work, an exercise
in rigorous self-denial.
Even more than Altman with
"McCabe and Mrs. Miller," who at
least leaves in the traditional
dramatic confrontations and
resolutions, Hellman does not
present a great deal of the vital
action, such as a love scene or an
important drag race, choosing
rather to focus upon the face of
an individual aware of the events
taking place but not actively
involved in them.
Hellman constantly upsets our
dramatic expectations but
fortunately is forceful enough to
make us accept a new framework
he creates to serve his own means,
a framework in which virtually
everything is subtext, in which a
seemingly meaningless void is
truly meaningfully filled with
subtle detail and comment.
Modern Existentialism
Hellman has been called the
American Antonioni and while
both have austerity and inaction
in common, I think the
comparison is basically inapt.
Hellman, with the possible
exception of his film's unsettling
final shot, completely avoids the
pretentiousness for which
Antonioni is so ingloriously
famous. Antonioni strives to make
a point, while Hellman is out to
affirm an attitude, one of truly
modern existentialism.
Furthermore, Antonioni has
never drawn a performance the
likes of which Warren Oates gives
as GTO, a resonantly American
character. James Taylor and
Dennis Wilson seem exactly what
was desired in their parts and
Laurie Bird is an almost

extraordinary amalgamation of all
the empty, petulant yet teasing
faces of so many lost girls of the
late sixties.
"Taking Off" represents by far
the most outstanding American
film debut by a foreign director in
the recent rash of such
phenomena. What's more, the use
of American young people is more
believable than in any more
self-consciously "youth" oriented
films.
Milos Forman, director of
"Loves of a Blonde" and
"Firemens Ball," arrived in New
York from Czechoslovakia
speaking no English and a couple
of years later, with the ominous
assistance of three off-Broadway
playwrights, turned out a film of
brittle brilliance.
The story, a trifling one of
parents' physical and
psychological search for a 15
year-old daughter, again is less
important than the way each
scene is filled with telling detail.
Though several sequences are
uproarious, especially the

black-tie pot party for forty-ish
parents conducted by a
memorably adenoidal wire-haired
freak, Forman's light touch is his
crowning touch.
All the faces in the film are
inplanted irrevocably in the
memory, all the performances are
ripe. Forman's visuals are utterly
uncluttered and economical, being
as clean as fashion photographs in

with human beings in less abstract
situations. He even travels, briefly,
as far as London in "The Touch."
In the end, though, it's all Bibi,
Bibi, Bibi. . .


Bibi Andersson
Enough fanfare preceded the
release of "Two-Lane Blacktop"
to make it a shoo-in for most
popular film of the year with both
audiences and critics. Not too
many people seem to have seen it,
however, and many critics have
used the film as an easy
opportunity to get their digs in at
Esquire as well, which pre-natally
honored the film for possessing
the best screenplay of the year.
Furthermore, considerable cult
interest was built up around
director Monte Hellman due to
the westerns he made with Jack
Nicholson, though nobody 1 know
has seen them.
Regardless of publicity, no
box-office or cults, "Two-Lane
Blacktop" is quite a movie and
has little or nothing to do with
"Easy Rider," with which it has
often been superficially
compared. Hell man's is a highly
austere, specific work, an exercise
in rigorous self-denial.
Even more than Altman with
"McCabe and Mrs. Miller," who at
least leaves in the traditional
dramatic confrontations and
resolutions, Hellman does not
present a great deal of the vital
action, such as a love scene or an
important drag race, choosing
rather to focus upon the face of
an individual aware of the events
taking place but not actively
involved in them.
Hellman constantly upsets our
dramatic expectations but
fortunately is forceful enough to
make us accept a new framework
he creates to serve his own means,
a framework in which virtually
everything is subtext, in which a
seemingly meaningless void is
truly meaningfully filled with
subtle detail and comment.
Modern Existentialism
Hellman has been called the
American Antonioni and while
both have austerity and inaction
in common, I think the
comparison is basically inapt.
Hellman, with the possible
exception of his film's unsettling
final shot, completely avoids the
pretentiousness for which
Antonioni is so ingloriously
famous. Antonioni strives to make
a point, while Hellman is out to
affirm an attitude, one of truly
modern existentialism.
Furthermore, Antonioni has
never drawn a performance the
likes of which Warren Oates gives
as GTO, a resonantly American
character. James Taylor and
Dennis Wilson seem exactly what
was desired in their parts and
Laurie Bird is an almost

extraordinary amalgamation of all
the empty, petulant yet teasing
faces of so many lost girls of the
late sixties.
"Taking Off" represents by far
the most outstanding American
film debut by a foreign director in
the recent rash of such
phenomena. What's more, the use
of American young people is more
believable than in any more
self-consciously "youth" oriented
films.
Milos Forman, director of
"Loves of a Blonde" and
"Firemens Ball," arrived in New
York from Czechoslovakia
speaking no English and a couple
of years later, with the ominous
assistance of three off-Broadway
playwrights, turned out a film of
brittle brilliance.
The story, a trifling one of
parents' physical and
psychological search for a 15
year-old daughter, again is less
important than the way each
scene is filled with telling detail.
Though several sequences are
uproarious, especially the

black-tie pot party for forty-ish
parents conducted by a
memorably adenoidal wire-haired
freak, Forman's light touch is his
crowning touch.
All the faces in the film are
inplanted irrevocably in the
memory, all the performances are
ripe. Forman's visuals are utterly
uncluttered and economical, being
as clean as fashion photographs in
the musical auditions and
perfectly framed to accommodate
the material in the set-pieces.
A project combining a foreign
director with American youth
with suburbia and Greenwich
Village as locales would normally
promise pretentiousness but to
Forman, human foibles are human
foibles whether in Prague or
Gotham. Forman is consistently
unflattering to all his characters
and it would be tempting to call

his treatment of some cruel. But
he relishes his characters as well
and his unblinking presentation of
them makes everyone an engaging
protagonist.
As a footnote, I'd like to add
that I've seen two ditVerent
versions of "Taking Off." In the
version I saw in Palo Alto, all the
words of the outrageous song,
"Ode to a Screw," remained
intact. In Chicago, a vital
obscenity which is repeated many
times is bleeped out, though no
doubts linger as to the word in
question mainly because of the
exacting lip movements of the
singer.
Actually, the bleeped version is
funnier than the original.
Surprisingly, this does not
represent yet another example of
repression in Chicago, as Universal
apparently has offered either
version for distribution, with
censorship duties left up to each
theatre manager.
"The Touch" opened
Wednesday at the Stanford
Theatre and is the best Ingmar
Bergman film I have ever seen.
Many Bergman purists have
already been shocked by the
master's descent into
commercialdom and while it's
easily his most accessible film, it's
also his most emotionally moving.
Bergman's production of
"Hedda Gabler" with Maggie
Smith in London remains one of
the most exciting theatrical
experiences of my life and"The
Touch" comes closest of all his
films to reproducing that
experience.
In two words, the main reason
for the film's stunning success is
Bibi Andersson, just as Maggie
Smith was essential to Bergman's
production of the Ibsen play.
Andersson's is an extraordinary
examination of a domesticated
woman daring to tread ground
outside her secure home and
marriage for the first time and
rarely have I felt that so many
intense feminine feelings have
been transferred to me across the
sex barrier with so much
emotional accuracy and force
intact.
Complete Character
Bibi Andersson creates a
complete character, one of total
believability, with mature
knowlege and security
accompanied by adolescent
defensiveness and hesitancy. Even
up against the extraordinary
challenge of Jane Fonda in
"Klute," Andersson's is by far the
performance of the year.
Elliott Gould's performance

and even presence on Bergman's
sacred territory has been almost
universally frowned upon.
Basically, 1 think it is the part, not
necessarily the actor, that can
most easily be found
objectionable and it must be
remembered that the conception
was Bergman's. I know people like
this man and can certainly believe
that they might treat women as
thoughtlessly as Gould treats
Andersson.
Furthermore, Bergman
suggests, through his part history
and an encounter with his sister,
that the Gould character is
emotionally disturbed or even
slightly mad (I think the inference
of incest is a bit much), thus
explaining his sudden irrational
turns of mood.
I'm frankly glad to see
Bergman desert his isolated
Swedish island for awhile and deal
with human beings in less abstract
situations. He even travels, briefly,
as far as London in "The Touch."

memorably adenoidal wire-haired
freak, Forman's light touch is his
crowning touch.
All the faces in the film are
inplanted irrevocably in the
memory, all the performances are
ripe. Forman's visuals are utterly
uncluttered and economical, being
as clean as fashion photographs in
the musical auditions and
perfectly framed to accommodate
the material in the set-pieces.
A project combining a foreign
director with American youth
with suburbia and Greenwich
Village as locales would normally
promise pretentiousness but to
Forman, human foibles are human
foibles whether in Prague or
Gotham. Forman is consistently
unflattering to all his characters
and it would be tempting to call

his treatment of some cruel. But
he relishes his characters as well
and his unblinking presentation of
them makes everyone an engaging
protagonist.
As a footnote, I'd like to add
that I've seen two ditVerent
versions of "Taking Off." In the
version I saw in Palo Alto, all the
words of the outrageous song,
"Ode to a Screw," remained
intact. In Chicago, a vital
obscenity which is repeated many
times is bleeped out, though no
doubts linger as to the word in
question mainly because of the
exacting lip movements of the
singer.
Actually, the bleeped version is
funnier than the original.
Surprisingly, this does not
represent yet another example of
repression in Chicago, as Universal
apparently has offered either
version for distribution, with
censorship duties left up to each
theatre manager.
"The Touch" opened
Wednesday at the Stanford
Theatre and is the best Ingmar
Bergman film I have ever seen.
Many Bergman purists have
already been shocked by the
master's descent into
commercialdom and while it's
easily his most accessible film, it's
also his most emotionally moving.
Bergman's production of
"Hedda Gabler" with Maggie
Smith in London remains one of
the most exciting theatrical
experiences of my life and"The
Touch" comes closest of all his
films to reproducing that
experience.
In two words, the main reason
for the film's stunning success is
Bibi Andersson, just as Maggie
Smith was essential to Bergman's
production of the Ibsen play.
Andersson's is an extraordinary
examination of a domesticated
woman daring to tread ground
outside her secure home and
marriage for the first time and
rarely have I felt that so many
intense feminine feelings have
been transferred to me across the
sex barrier with so much
emotional accuracy and force
intact.
Complete Character
Bibi Andersson creates a
complete character, one of total
believability, with mature
knowlege and security
accompanied by adolescent
defensiveness and hesitancy. Even
up against the extraordinary
challenge of Jane Fonda in
"Klute," Andersson's is by far the
performance of the year.
Elliott Gould's performance

and even presence on Bergman's
sacred territory has been almost
universally frowned upon.
Basically, 1 think it is the part, not
necessarily the actor, that can
most easily be found
objectionable and it must be
remembered that the conception
was Bergman's. I know people like
this man and can certainly believe
that they might treat women as
thoughtlessly as Gould treats
Andersson.
Furthermore, Bergman
suggests, through his part history
and an encounter with his sister,
that the Gould character is
emotionally disturbed or even
slightly mad (I think the inference
of incest is a bit much), thus
explaining his sudden irrational
turns of mood.
I'm frankly glad to see
Bergman desert his isolated
Swedish island for awhile and deal
with human beings in less abstract
situations. He even travels, briefly,
as far as London in "The Touch."
In the end, though, it's all Bibi,
Bibi, Bibi. . .
