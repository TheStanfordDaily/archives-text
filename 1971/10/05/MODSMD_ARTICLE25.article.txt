Senate Limits Lao Spending
WASHINGTON — The Senate voted yesterday to set the first congressional limit
on US spending in Laos, approving a ceiling at the budgeted level of $350 million
after war critics dropped efforts for a sharp cut.
Sen. John C. Stennis, D-Miss., chairman of the Armed Services Committee,
agreed to support the limit after Sen. Stuart Symington, D-Mo., its sponsor,
narrowed its application.
The limit placed in the $21-billion military procurement bill applies to
economic and military aid plus Central Intelligence Agency support of both
Laotian and Thai irregular forces trying to keep the small landlocked Indochinese
country from falling to North Vietnam.
It excludes all US bombing activities—attacks in and around the Communists'
Ho Chi Minh supply trail and those in support of Laotian forces in the Plain of
Jars and in Northern Laos.
Approval was by a roll-call vote of 67 to 11 with opposition coming from a
handful of war opponents who considered it could be interpreted as an
authorization for US action in Laos and from administration backers opposing
any restrictions.
Symington proposed originally a spending limit of $200 million excluding only
the bombing around the Ho Chi Minh trail.
After a series of conferences, Symington agreed to raise the limit to $35 0
million and omit any ban on the $143 million budgeted for bombing in Northern
Laos.
In addition, the amendment includes provisions requiring the Nixon
administration to keep Congress informed of actual expenditures in Laos on a
quarterly basis and provide written explanations of future requests for funds.
Thieu Claims Big Victory
SAIGON — President Nguyen Van Thieu claimed yesterday his overwhelming
majority in re-election was a defeat for communism in South Vietnam and a
victory for democracy.
But charges of fraud mounted as swiftly as results were posted in Sunday's
uncontested balloting.
Vice President Nguyen Cao Ky and Duong Van Minh, who at first challenged
Thieu but withdrew, remained silent. They had charged that the election was
rigged from the start of the campaign.
The State Department's first reaction, voiced by spokesman Charles W. Bray 111
in Washington, was that "we are pleased so many voted in Vietnam despite efforts
to disrupt the election." This was a reference to enemy terrorist attacks.

The Vietnamese National Election Center gave Thieu 91.5 percent of the
ballots cast. His press secretary estimated the vote against Thieu at 5.5 percent.
No accounting was given for the other 3 percent.
Thieu said "This is really a very good achievement of our nation and our
people in the building and implementing of democracy. Nobody can deny this and
the Communists and their lackeys can no longer distort."
Navy Retrieves Sailors
SAN DIEGO — Nine sailors who were flown to the attack carrier Constellation
after refusing to sail voluntarily are busy working on the ship, the Navy said
yesterday.
The nine are under protective custody helping sailors regularly assigned to
"compartment cleaning task," a spokesman said. They were arrested in Christ the
King Roman Catholic Church a day after the Constellation sailed for Vietnam and
flown 300 miles to the carrier.
The Navy spokesman in San Diego said there's been no word whether the nine
will be court martialed.
David Harris and the Peace Union have been working with the San Diego peace
movement trying to stop the aircraft carrier Constellation from leaving for a tour
of duty in Vietnam.
House Upholds Nixon Plan
WASHINGTON — President Nixon's order for a $1.3-billion six-month delay in a
federal pay raise was upheld by the House yesterday 207 to 174. The Senate has
yet to act.
A host of Southern Democrats joined Republicans in turning back a House
move to make the pay raise effective Jan. 1 instead of next July 1, as Nixon
ordered.
It was the first congressional vote on any of the President's emergency
economic proposals, and he said a veto of his action postponing the pay raise
would torpedo the whole package.
Sen. Frank Moss, D-Utah, plans to press for a vote in the Senate Wednesday or
Thursday. Either the Senate or the House can override the President's pay-raise
deferral action, without concurrence by the other chamber.
The Senate voted 65 to 4 Monday to give members of the armed forces a
$381-million annual pay raise in addition to a $2.4-billion increase included in the
already-enacted legislation to extend the draft.

House Upholds Nixon Plan
WASHINGTON — President Nixon's order for a $1.3-billion six-month delay in a
federal pay raise was upheld by the House yesterday 207 to 174. The Senate has
yet to act.
A host of Southern Democrats joined Republicans in turning back a House
move to make the pay raise effective Jan. 1 instead of next July 1, as Nixon
ordered.
It was the first congressional vote on any of the President's emergency
economic proposals, and he said a veto of his action postponing the pay raise
would torpedo the whole package.
Sen. Frank Moss, D-Utah, plans to press for a vote in the Senate Wednesday or
Thursday. Either the Senate or the House can override the President's pay-raise
deferral action, without concurrence by the other chamber.
The Senate voted 65 to 4 Monday to give members of the armed forces a
$381-million annual pay raise in addition to a $2.4-billion increase included in the
already-enacted legislation to extend the draft.
Senate Limits Lao Spending
WASHINGTON — The Senate voted yesterday to set the first congressional limit
on US spending in Laos, approving a ceiling at the budgeted level of $350 million
after war critics dropped efforts for a sharp cut.
Sen. John C. Stennis, D-Miss., chairman of the Armed Services Committee,
agreed to support the limit after Sen. Stuart Symington, D-Mo., its sponsor,
narrowed its application.
The limit placed in the $21-billion military procurement bill applies to
economic and military aid plus Central Intelligence Agency support of both
Laotian and Thai irregular forces trying to keep the small landlocked Indochinese
country from falling to North Vietnam.
It excludes all US bombing activities—attacks in and around the Communists'
Ho Chi Minh supply trail and those in support of Laotian forces in the Plain of
Jars and in Northern Laos.
Approval was by a roll-call vote of 67 to 11 with opposition coming from a
handful of war opponents who considered it could be interpreted as an
authorization for US action in Laos and from administration backers opposing
any restrictions.
Symington proposed originally a spending limit of $200 million excluding only
the bombing around the Ho Chi Minh trail.
After a series of conferences, Symington agreed to raise the limit to $35 0
million and omit any ban on the $143 million budgeted for bombing in Northern
Laos.
In addition, the amendment includes provisions requiring the Nixon
administration to keep Congress informed of actual expenditures in Laos on a
quarterly basis and provide written explanations of future requests for funds.
Thieu Claims Big Victory
SAIGON — President Nguyen Van Thieu claimed yesterday his overwhelming
majority in re-election was a defeat for communism in South Vietnam and a
victory for democracy.
But charges of fraud mounted as swiftly as results were posted in Sunday's
uncontested balloting.
Vice President Nguyen Cao Ky and Duong Van Minh, who at first challenged
Thieu but withdrew, remained silent. They had charged that the election was
rigged from the start of the campaign.
The State Department's first reaction, voiced by spokesman Charles W. Bray 111
in Washington, was that "we are pleased so many voted in Vietnam despite efforts
to disrupt the election." This was a reference to enemy terrorist attacks.

The Vietnamese National Election Center gave Thieu 91.5 percent of the
ballots cast. His press secretary estimated the vote against Thieu at 5.5 percent.
No accounting was given for the other 3 percent.
Thieu said "This is really a very good achievement of our nation and our
people in the building and implementing of democracy. Nobody can deny this and
the Communists and their lackeys can no longer distort."
Navy Retrieves Sailors
SAN DIEGO — Nine sailors who were flown to the attack carrier Constellation
after refusing to sail voluntarily are busy working on the ship, the Navy said
yesterday.
The nine are under protective custody helping sailors regularly assigned to
"compartment cleaning task," a spokesman said. They were arrested in Christ the
King Roman Catholic Church a day after the Constellation sailed for Vietnam and
flown 300 miles to the carrier.
The Navy spokesman in San Diego said there's been no word whether the nine
will be court martialed.
