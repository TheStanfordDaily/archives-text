# What's Up, Dock?
## Nixon Names Law Prof To Advisory Board 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
President Nixon has named J. Keith
Mann, Associate Dean of the Stanford
Law School, to head a special advisory
board to decide if an injunction should
be sought against striking members of
the International Longshoremen and
Warehousemen's Union.
A 97-day-old strike of West Coast
dockworkers was joined this week by
longshoremen from throughout most of
the nation, prompting the President's
order.
At first, there was some confusion as
to whether the order applied to all
longshoremen, or just those on the
West Coast.
However, Mann told the Daily last
night that "although I have not seen
the exact terms of the executive order,
it is my understanding that it pertains
to the West, East, and Gulf coasts."
He said that he expected the exact
i,erms of the order to be teletyped to
him shortly.
Taft-Hartley Act
Mann explained that the five-man
advisory board was convened under the
terms of the Taft-Hartley Act, which
empowers the board to advise the
President on whether or not to seek an
injunction imposing an 80-day "cooling
off period" that would send the strikers
back to work.
The President specified in his
announcement that he wanted a report
from the committee by Wednesday so
he could plan his next move in the
lengthy labor dispute. As a result, Mann
will convene the board today, although
he would not comment on the early
deadline set by Mr. Nixon.
In summoning the advisory board
Mr. Nixon said that if the dock strike
continues it will "imperil the national
health and safety" and affect a
substantial part of the maritime

industry that involves trade, commerce,
transportation, and communication
between the states and foreign
nations."
The calling of the board marks the
first time President Nixon has invoked
the Taft-Hartley law to intervene in a
strike.
Impasse Announced
The action came after chief federal
mediator J. Curtis Counts announced in
San Francisco yesterday afternoon that
negotiations in the West Coast dock
strike had reached an impasse.
Counts told a news conference he
had notified the White House that
"They have reached an impasse of such
nature that the likelihood of
termination of the work stoppage
seems very unlikely."
Counts had been sitting in on
marathon negotiations concerning the
strike since talks were resumed in San
Francisco on August 25.
At the press conference Counts also
announced that talks between the
International Longshoremen's and
Warehouseman's Union and Pacific
Maritime Association had been recessed
indefinitely.
Associate Dean Mann is no stranger
to Presidential advisory boards, having
served in similar capacities under
Presidents Kennedy and Johnson. A
specialist in transportation labor
matters, he chaired the board that
settled the 1967 strike of electrical
workers against Western shipbuilders.
At Stanford Since '52
A graduate of Indiana University,
Mann has been on the Stanford faculty
since 1952, and has been Associate
Dean of the Law School since 1961.
Before coming to the University, he
clerked for two Supreme Court
Justices, and practiced law in
Washington.

He was a consultant for the Wage
Stabilization Board during the Korean
War, and is an expert in the field of
labor-management relations.
He was also the author of a report
released last year on the phasing out of
ROTC on campus.
Should the President seek, and
receive, the 80-day injunction, the

advisory board would be reconvened by-
Mann after 60 of the 80 days to
examine progress made in the interim.
Mann said Monday night that he had
been deluged by phone calls form the
media since his appointment was
announced. Interviewed on KCBS
radio, he would say only that the board
would recommend any action that it
deemed "necessary and proper."

Mr. Nixon said that if the dock strike
continues it will "imperil the national
health and safety" and affect a
substantial part of the maritime

industry that involves trade, commerce,
transportation, and communication
between the states and foreign
nations."
The calling of the board marks the
first time President Nixon has invoked
the Taft-Hartley law to intervene in a
strike.
Impasse Announced
The action came after chief federal
mediator J. Curtis Counts announced in
San Francisco yesterday afternoon that
negotiations in the West Coast dock
strike had reached an impasse.
Counts told a news conference he
had notified the White House that
"They have reached an impasse of such
nature that the likelihood of
termination of the work stoppage
seems very unlikely."
Counts had been sitting in on
marathon negotiations concerning the
strike since talks were resumed in San
Francisco on August 25.
At the press conference Counts also
announced that talks between the
International Longshoremen's and
Warehouseman's Union and Pacific
Maritime Association had been recessed
indefinitely.
Associate Dean Mann is no stranger
to Presidential advisory boards, having
served in similar capacities under
Presidents Kennedy and Johnson. A
specialist in transportation labor
matters, he chaired the board that
settled the 1967 strike of electrical
workers against Western shipbuilders.
At Stanford Since '52
A graduate of Indiana University,
Mann has been on the Stanford faculty
since 1952, and has been Associate
Dean of the Law School since 1961.
Before coming to the University, he
clerked for two Supreme Court
Justices, and practiced law in
Washington.

He was a consultant for the Wage
Stabilization Board during the Korean
War, and is an expert in the field of
labor-management relations.
He was also the author of a report
released last year on the phasing out of
ROTC on campus.
Should the President seek, and
receive, the 80-day injunction, the

advisory board would be reconvened by-
Mann after 60 of the 80 days to
examine progress made in the interim.
Mann said Monday night that he had
been deluged by phone calls form the
media since his appointment was
announced. Interviewed on KCBS
radio, he would say only that the board
would recommend any action that it
deemed "necessary and proper."
President Nixon has named J. Keith
Mann, Associate Dean of the Stanford
Law School, to head a special advisory
board to decide if an injunction should
be sought against striking members of
the International Longshoremen and
Warehousemen's Union.
A 97-day-old strike of West Coast
dockworkers was joined this week by
longshoremen from throughout most of
the nation, prompting the President's
order.
At first, there was some confusion as
to whether the order applied to all
longshoremen, or just those on the
West Coast.
However, Mann told the Daily last
night that "although I have not seen
the exact terms of the executive order,
it is my understanding that it pertains
to the West, East, and Gulf coasts."
He said that he expected the exact
i,erms of the order to be teletyped to
him shortly.
Taft-Hartley Act
Mann explained that the five-man
advisory board was convened under the
terms of the Taft-Hartley Act, which
empowers the board to advise the
President on whether or not to seek an
injunction imposing an 80-day "cooling
off period" that would send the strikers
back to work.
The President specified in his
announcement that he wanted a report
from the committee by Wednesday so
he could plan his next move in the
lengthy labor dispute. As a result, Mann
will convene the board today, although
he would not comment on the early
deadline set by Mr. Nixon.
