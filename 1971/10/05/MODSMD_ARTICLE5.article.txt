# Grad Dean Testifies Franklin 'Provoked'
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
Lincoln Moses, Dean of the Graduate Division, testified yesterday that he
thought Prof. Bruce Franklin was trying to gather a crowd to confront police at
the Computation Center, Feb. 10. Moses qualified details of his account dying
cross-examination.
Later, Electrical Engineering Professor Alan Waterman testified that Fra.t.«kiin
shouted to the crowd, "telling them to come back" after police ordered them to
disperse.
Franklin charged Waterman was "out-and-out lying" and attacked his work on
Defense Department projects.
A seven-professor Advisory Board is hearing administration charges against
Franklin, including inciting the Feb. 10 occupation of the Comp Center and
encouraging resistance to a police dispersal order after the occupation was ended.
Moses said he had been on the scene as a faculty observer but began to leave
after hearing the dispersal order read four times.
The white-bearded professor testified that Franklin then "accosted" him and
loudly insisted "that I (Moses) was a faculty observer, and I should stay and
observe."
After their encounter, Moses said, Franklin turned and walked toward the
police line with from 5 to 20 persons following him. Moses described Franklin as
shouting while he walked that "this was not in fact an illegal assembly, and people
should be over there."
But he later said he did not hear Franklin urge any specific individuals to
confront the police. He also conceded it was "conceivable" that Franklin's
remarks were aimed at police rather than the crowd.
Moses Left
The Dean said he left the area when he began to feel Franklin had recruited
him as part of a crowd "provocative of the police." Under cross-examination,
Moses admitted he would have stayed as a faculty observer "if I had it to do over
again."
Franklin reminded Moses, who is a professor of both statistics and community
medicine, that they both participated in a 1965 anti-war protest in Berkeley.
Demonstrators in that march had considered confronting police who refused to
allow them into Oakland.
Moses said he would have supported the Oakland confrontation by
"good-humored" marchers as a protest against "an excessive police order." He
added, "When the police can inhibit peaceful demonstrations at will, serious issues
are involved."
He insisted, however, that police had reason to clear the lawn outside the
Comp Center because "violence was a clear and present danger."
Crowd Picture
Franklin showed Moses a picture of a crowd which included them both. But
Moses said the photograph could not have been taken during their argument
because Statistics Prof. Charles Stein was in the photo next to Moses.
"I just can't imagine that conversation could have gone on with Charles
standing next to me and me not knowing it,"he commented.
Board Chairman Donald Kennedy postponed a decision on Franklin's request
that Stein—who is on sabbatical at Cornell—be flown back at administrative
expense to testify.
Waterman in his testimony claimed that after the dispersal order Franklin
"very definitely" turned to the thinning crowd and loudly urged them to face the
police.
"You got them started back," he told Franklin before a near full-house in the
courtroom, Physics 101.
He admitted he could not judge how much of the crowd followed Franklin
simply out of curiosity about what was happening.
DOD Contracts
During cross-examination, Franklin repeatedly asked about Waterman's
research contracts with the Defense Department (DOD). The long-term activist
charged that the electrical engineer was lying because he "has a very dear, personal
interest in getting me the hell out of here."
Waterman said his DOD contracts no longer include studies of "electronic
countermeasures." He denied his research in that field could be used to jam radar
and block detection of planes carrying bombs.
Waterman insisted his research on interception of radar signals would be more
useful in military "information-gathering" than in weapons.
'Addressing Crowd'
Professor of Education Edward Begle testified that he saw Franklin
"addressing" at least a dozen "young people" during the time between the
dispersal order and Franklin's confrontation with police officials.
Begle said he was too far away to hear but that Franklin was "gesticulating"
and was "down on one knee." Begle was the first witness to describe such an
incident.
At the beginning of yesterday's session, University Manager of Operations
Bruce Wiggins said that he was jeered, "pounded" on the back, and hit with the
microphone of his bullhorn as he went through the Computation Center
demanding that demonstrators end their occupation of that facility.
The hearing will continue this afternoon at 1 p.m.
