## Nuremberg, Free Speech And The Lodge Incident 
### 
halsted holman

In the Lodge incident, an
architect of criminal policy spoke
with official sanction on this
campus and was disrupted by
those who perceived and opposed
the criminal policy. Thus was
created the clash between the
principles of Nuremberg and of
free speech. The protesters acted,
at least in part, under Nuremberg.
The University Administration
and its supporters have denied the
relevance of Nuremberg and have
recognized only the aspect of free
speech. Were the Administration
truly concerned with the issues at
stake it would address both
contending principles.
The integrity of the University
demands that the Lodge incident
be examined in its fullest
ramifications and that the actions
of Professor Franklin be judged in
that broad context. Only thus
might understanding and justice
be served.

In recognizing solely the free
speech aspect of the controversy,
the position of the Administration
and its defenders is seriously
deficient. Nonetheless it should be
examined on its merits.
A prime social purpose of free
speech is to guarantee the public's
right to know. We now know
from the Pentagon Papers and
other sources that the government
of the United States has engaged
in a massive campaign of deceit
and distortion in order to prevent
the citizenry from understanding
the facts of the war or the
government's intentions.
Lodge has been a principal
perpetrator of that policy, and
thus a suppressor of information.
In the Lodge incident, in a twist
of circumstance, the public's right
to know was served by
interrupting him and drawing
attention to government crimes
and mendacity.

Application of the clear and
present danger doctrine to the
Lodge case requires some estimate
of the relative dangers implicit in
the actions of Lodge and of the
protesters. Usually it is the
government which argues that it is
endangered by a speaker and
should be allowed to silence him.
In the Lodge incident the roles are
reversed, but there is no reason
why the principle should not
apply.
The protesters contend that
ten years of deception and killing
represent a clear and present
danger to the United States so
great that their disruption is trivial
by comparison. On any fair scale,
that contention has weight.
It has been repeatedly argued
that to countenance denial of free
speech for whatever cause is to
destroy democracy and invite
totalitarianism. There is merit in

this view, and in an ideal situation
it might be controlling. However
in 19 71 its impact is sharply
curtailed.
Decade Of Conspiracy
We stand witness to a decade
of conspiracy by the government
to defraud the people of this
nation, to expend the lives of its
youth on behalf of the deception,
and to deny the rights and needs
of the people of this country. It is
the government which has
practiced and to some extent
accomplished the destruction of
democracy. The protesters spoke
against this.
A critical question concerns
the individuals to whom free
speech applies in this case. Free
speech has meaning when it is
exercised by the individuals most
affected in a given situation.
Historically in the United States
we have thought of free speech in
terms of domestic controversy.

In the Lodge incident, the
circumstances are international.
The issue is the Vietnam war and
the principals are the United
States and Vietnamese people.
However, the people of North and
South Vietnam have never had an
opportunity to express their views
about the war to the American
people. For free speech to
function truly on the question of
the Vietnam war, it would require
participation of the Vietnamese.
Instead, hundreds of thousands of
Vietnamese have been denied
both free speech and their lives.
To ague Lodge's right to free
speech while failing to assert an
even larger right of the
Vietnamese to be heard, is to
manipulate free speech for
partisan purposes and thus to
distort its * intent. How
incongruous for the aggressor to
insist on free speech to defend his
aggression while preventing his
victim from being heard!
Some contend that vigorous
protest was appropriate but
interrupting speech was not.
Again, the context is determining.
After ten years of the Vietnam
war, protest so strong as to
challenge and disturb people is
understandable and may be
necessary. When the government
is relentless in its violation of law
and principle, and deploys its
immense power against the
opposition, the citizen has little
choice but to submit or to act in a
way which is painful to the
government and its supporters.

The persistent unwillingness of
many of the Stanford community
to recognize or even discuss the
relevance of the Nuremberg
Principles underscores this point.
Whatever the merits of the
above views on the free speech
argument, to my mind the
determining considerations lie in
the Nuremberg Principles. Those
principles explicitly establish the
supremacy of international law
over national law.
The citizen must uphold those
international principles whatever
the anguish in seeing his own
nation or institution convicted, or
himself persecuted for his views.
Confronted with the crimes of the
government of the United States,
the citizen has the right and
obligation to act in a way which is
meaningful, a way which disturbs
complacency and vivifies the
problem. For some this is civil
disobedience, for some it is fleeing
the country, for some it is
political organizing and for some
it is disruption of a speech by
Lodge.
Hitler Vs. Lodge
Few would deny that a
German who disrupted a speech
by Hitler would have been acting
in the highest principles of
citizenship. Does not the same
apply to those who stood and
exposed the crimes of Lodge? If
the higher principles of a citizen's
behavior are to be honored only
when abstract and not when
turned to action, then this nation
is not worthy.

The government of this nation
has pursued its political goals by
stealth, deceit, force and
incredible violence. The
University has been party to many
of the government's actions. The
protesters of the Lodge speech
registered their protest
nonviolently and openly. Which is
the honorable party?
In the competition of
principles between Nuremberg
and free speech there is not a
clean intellectual resolution. The
offending practices and the
contending principles must be
weighed. For the individual, the
decision must rest with the
imperatives of conscience. For the
University, at the very least, the
profound mitigating
circumstances in the Lodge
incident should be recognized and
the charge against Franklin
dropped.
Nuremberg cannot be avoided.
For those whose allegiance is
predominantly to the abstraction
of free speech, let them actively,
publicly and vigorously oppose
the war in Vietnam and University
assistance to it, if their position is
to have credibility. If they find
fault with the views in this paper,
let them address the issues
squarely, marshal their
arguments, and allow the
community to benefit from a free
and open airing of the issues.

above views on the free speech
argument, to my mind the
determining considerations lie in
the Nuremberg Principles. Those
principles explicitly establish the
supremacy of international law
over national law.
The citizen must uphold those
international principles whatever
the anguish in seeing his own
nation or institution convicted, or
himself persecuted for his views.
Confronted with the crimes of the
government of the United States,
the citizen has the right and
obligation to act in a way which is
meaningful, a way which disturbs
complacency and vivifies the
problem. For some this is civil
disobedience, for some it is fleeing
the country, for some it is
political organizing and for some
it is disruption of a speech by
Lodge.
Hitler Vs. Lodge
Few would deny that a
German who disrupted a speech
by Hitler would have been acting
in the highest principles of
citizenship. Does not the same
apply to those who stood and
exposed the crimes of Lodge? If
the higher principles of a citizen's
behavior are to be honored only
when abstract and not when
turned to action, then this nation
is not worthy.

The government of this nation
has pursued its political goals by
stealth, deceit, force and
incredible violence. The
University has been party to many
of the government's actions. The
protesters of the Lodge speech
registered their protest
nonviolently and openly. Which is
the honorable party?
In the competition of
principles between Nuremberg
and free speech there is not a
clean intellectual resolution. The
offending practices and the
contending principles must be
weighed. For the individual, the
decision must rest with the
imperatives of conscience. For the
University, at the very least, the
profound mitigating
circumstances in the Lodge
incident should be recognized and
the charge against Franklin
dropped.
Nuremberg cannot be avoided.
For those whose allegiance is
predominantly to the abstraction
of free speech, let them actively,
publicly and vigorously oppose
the war in Vietnam and University
assistance to it, if their position is
to have credibility. If they find
fault with the views in this paper,
let them address the issues
squarely, marshal their
arguments, and allow the
community to benefit from a free
and open airing of the issues.

In the Lodge incident, an
architect of criminal policy spoke
with official sanction on this
campus and was disrupted by
those who perceived and opposed
the criminal policy. Thus was
created the clash between the
principles of Nuremberg and of
free speech. The protesters acted,
at least in part, under Nuremberg.
The University Administration
and its supporters have denied the
relevance of Nuremberg and have
recognized only the aspect of free
speech. Were the Administration
truly concerned with the issues at
stake it would address both
contending principles.
The integrity of the University
demands that the Lodge incident
be examined in its fullest
ramifications and that the actions
of Professor Franklin be judged in
that broad context. Only thus
might understanding and justice
be served.

In recognizing solely the free
speech aspect of the controversy,
the position of the Administration
and its defenders is seriously
deficient. Nonetheless it should be
examined on its merits.
A prime social purpose of free
speech is to guarantee the public's
right to know. We now know
from the Pentagon Papers and
other sources that the government
of the United States has engaged
in a massive campaign of deceit
and distortion in order to prevent
the citizenry from understanding
the facts of the war or the
government's intentions.
Lodge has been a principal
perpetrator of that policy, and
thus a suppressor of information.
In the Lodge incident, in a twist
of circumstance, the public's right
to know was served by
interrupting him and drawing
attention to government crimes
and mendacity.

Application of the clear and
present danger doctrine to the
Lodge case requires some estimate
of the relative dangers implicit in
the actions of Lodge and of the
protesters. Usually it is the
government which argues that it is
endangered by a speaker and
should be allowed to silence him.
In the Lodge incident the roles are
reversed, but there is no reason
why the principle should not
apply.
The protesters contend that
ten years of deception and killing
represent a clear and present
danger to the United States so
great that their disruption is trivial
by comparison. On any fair scale,
that contention has weight.
It has been repeatedly argued
that to countenance denial of free
speech for whatever cause is to
destroy democracy and invite
totalitarianism. There is merit in

this view, and in an ideal situation
it might be controlling. However
in 19 71 its impact is sharply
curtailed.
Decade Of Conspiracy
We stand witness to a decade
of conspiracy by the government
to defraud the people of this
nation, to expend the lives of its
youth on behalf of the deception,
and to deny the rights and needs
of the people of this country. It is
the government which has
practiced and to some extent
accomplished the destruction of
democracy. The protesters spoke
against this.
A critical question concerns
the individuals to whom free
speech applies in this case. Free
speech has meaning when it is
exercised by the individuals most
affected in a given situation.
Historically in the United States
we have thought of free speech in
terms of domestic controversy.

In the Lodge incident, the
circumstances are international.
The issue is the Vietnam war and
the principals are the United
States and Vietnamese people.
However, the people of North and
South Vietnam have never had an
opportunity to express their views
about the war to the American
people. For free speech to
function truly on the question of
the Vietnam war, it would require
participation of the Vietnamese.
Instead, hundreds of thousands of
Vietnamese have been denied
both free speech and their lives.
To ague Lodge's right to free
speech while failing to assert an
even larger right of the
Vietnamese to be heard, is to
manipulate free speech for
partisan purposes and thus to
distort its * intent. How
incongruous for the aggressor to
insist on free speech to defend his
aggression while preventing his
victim from being heard!
Some contend that vigorous
protest was appropriate but
interrupting speech was not.
Again, the context is determining.
After ten years of the Vietnam
war, protest so strong as to
challenge and disturb people is
understandable and may be
necessary. When the government
is relentless in its violation of law
and principle, and deploys its
immense power against the
opposition, the citizen has little
choice but to submit or to act in a
way which is painful to the
government and its supporters.

The persistent unwillingness of
many of the Stanford community
to recognize or even discuss the
relevance of the Nuremberg
Principles underscores this point.

totalitarianism. There is merit in

this view, and in an ideal situation
it might be controlling. However
in 19 71 its impact is sharply
curtailed.
Decade Of Conspiracy
We stand witness to a decade
of conspiracy by the government
to defraud the people of this
nation, to expend the lives of its
youth on behalf of the deception,
and to deny the rights and needs
of the people of this country. It is
the government which has
practiced and to some extent
accomplished the destruction of
democracy. The protesters spoke
against this.
A critical question concerns
the individuals to whom free
speech applies in this case. Free
speech has meaning when it is
exercised by the individuals most
affected in a given situation.
Historically in the United States
we have thought of free speech in
terms of domestic controversy.

In the Lodge incident, the
circumstances are international.
The issue is the Vietnam war and
the principals are the United
States and Vietnamese people.
However, the people of North and
South Vietnam have never had an
opportunity to express their views
about the war to the American
people. For free speech to
function truly on the question of
the Vietnam war, it would require
participation of the Vietnamese.
Instead, hundreds of thousands of
Vietnamese have been denied
both free speech and their lives.
To ague Lodge's right to free
speech while failing to assert an
even larger right of the
Vietnamese to be heard, is to
manipulate free speech for
partisan purposes and thus to
distort its * intent. How
incongruous for the aggressor to
insist on free speech to defend his
aggression while preventing his
victim from being heard!
Some contend that vigorous
protest was appropriate but
interrupting speech was not.
Again, the context is determining.
After ten years of the Vietnam
war, protest so strong as to
challenge and disturb people is
understandable and may be
necessary. When the government
is relentless in its violation of law
and principle, and deploys its
immense power against the
opposition, the citizen has little
choice but to submit or to act in a
way which is painful to the
government and its supporters.

The persistent unwillingness of
many of the Stanford community
to recognize or even discuss the
relevance of the Nuremberg
Principles underscores this point.
Whatever the merits of the
above views on the free speech
argument, to my mind the
determining considerations lie in
the Nuremberg Principles. Those
principles explicitly establish the
supremacy of international law
over national law.
The citizen must uphold those
international principles whatever
the anguish in seeing his own
nation or institution convicted, or
himself persecuted for his views.
Confronted with the crimes of the
government of the United States,
the citizen has the right and
obligation to act in a way which is
meaningful, a way which disturbs
complacency and vivifies the
problem. For some this is civil
disobedience, for some it is fleeing
the country, for some it is
political organizing and for some
it is disruption of a speech by
Lodge.
Hitler Vs. Lodge
Few would deny that a
German who disrupted a speech
by Hitler would have been acting
in the highest principles of
citizenship. Does not the same
apply to those who stood and
exposed the crimes of Lodge? If
the higher principles of a citizen's
behavior are to be honored only
when abstract and not when
turned to action, then this nation
is not worthy.

The government of this nation
has pursued its political goals by
stealth, deceit, force and
incredible violence. The
University has been party to many
of the government's actions. The
protesters of the Lodge speech
registered their protest
nonviolently and openly. Which is
the honorable party?
In the competition of
principles between Nuremberg
and free speech there is not a
clean intellectual resolution. The
offending practices and the
contending principles must be
weighed. For the individual, the
decision must rest with the
imperatives of conscience. For the
University, at the very least, the
profound mitigating
circumstances in the Lodge
incident should be recognized and
the charge against Franklin
dropped.
Nuremberg cannot be avoided.
For those whose allegiance is
predominantly to the abstraction
of free speech, let them actively,
publicly and vigorously oppose
the war in Vietnam and University
assistance to it, if their position is
to have credibility. If they find
fault with the views in this paper,
let them address the issues
squarely, marshal their
arguments, and allow the
community to benefit from a free
and open airing of the issues.

In the Lodge incident, an
architect of criminal policy spoke
with official sanction on this
campus and was disrupted by
those who perceived and opposed
the criminal policy. Thus was
created the clash between the
principles of Nuremberg and of
free speech. The protesters acted,
at least in part, under Nuremberg.
The University Administration
and its supporters have denied the
relevance of Nuremberg and have
recognized only the aspect of free
speech. Were the Administration
truly concerned with the issues at
stake it would address both
contending principles.
The integrity of the University
demands that the Lodge incident
be examined in its fullest
ramifications and that the actions
of Professor Franklin be judged in
that broad context. Only thus
might understanding and justice
be served.

In recognizing solely the free
speech aspect of the controversy,
the position of the Administration
and its defenders is seriously
deficient. Nonetheless it should be
examined on its merits.
A prime social purpose of free
speech is to guarantee the public's
right to know. We now know
from the Pentagon Papers and
other sources that the government
of the United States has engaged
in a massive campaign of deceit
and distortion in order to prevent
the citizenry from understanding
the facts of the war or the
government's intentions.
Lodge has been a principal
perpetrator of that policy, and
thus a suppressor of information.
In the Lodge incident, in a twist
of circumstance, the public's right
to know was served by
interrupting him and drawing
attention to government crimes
and mendacity.

Application of the clear and
present danger doctrine to the
Lodge case requires some estimate
of the relative dangers implicit in
the actions of Lodge and of the
protesters. Usually it is the
government which argues that it is
endangered by a speaker and
should be allowed to silence him.
In the Lodge incident the roles are
reversed, but there is no reason
why the principle should not
apply.
The protesters contend that
ten years of deception and killing
represent a clear and present
danger to the United States so
great that their disruption is trivial
by comparison. On any fair scale,
that contention has weight.
It has been repeatedly argued
that to countenance denial of free
speech for whatever cause is to
destroy democracy and invite
totalitarianism. There is merit in

this view, and in an ideal situation
it might be controlling. However
