# U.S. -- China.. People To People Diplomacy
## 
### MOLLY COYE 
Last Friday night the War
Veteran's Auditorium in San
Francisco was jammed—with an
audience singing the
Internationale, 'The East is Red'
and 'Sailing the Seas Depends on
the Helmsman.' It was October
1 st, and we were celebrating the
22 nd anniversary of the founding
of the People's Republic of China.
This, in a year full of beginnings,
was another first: the first time
citizens of the United States have
come together in this country to
celebrate China's National Day.
Americans are beginning to
read, talk and think about China
in an entirely new way. This is
very commendable—learning more
about other countries, and
offering them friendship, is
generally a good idea—but in the
case of China, there is a good deal
more to it than that. For we are
breaking through fifty years of
lies.

The lies began when
imperialism first felt itself
threatened in China, after the 1911
revolution. Nationalism was rising,
and British, French, German,
Japanese and American interests
recognized a threat to the
stranglehold they had on China's
development. It was a
stranglehold, draining off the
productive force of her labor,
invading her markets with foreign
imports, and denying her the right
of a nation to govern within her
boundaries. These interests
clashed constantly with the new
nationalism, and managed to hold
it at bay.
By the end of the 1920'5, the
foreign interests had a new friend:
the American dream, Chiang
Kai-shek and his American
trained, Methodist wife, Sung
May-ling. While Madame Chiang
traveled back and forth to
negotiate for U.S. aid, her
husband systematically

exterminated as many of the
anti-imperialist forces in China as
he could. Temporarily succeeding,
he greatly weakened the ability of
the Chinese people to withstand
the first onslaughts of Japanese
agression.
During World War 11, even
Chiang's chief American advisor
remarked that both Chiang and
the U.S. seemed more interested
in weakening the Communists
th<m in fighting the Japanese. And
in the two years after the war,
from 19 46-48 , Chiang received
more than twice what he had
received from America during all
of the war—all of it for the civil
war against the Communist
government.
Through all of this, the Chiangs
WERE China in the minds of
many Americans—and when the
people of China drove the
Generalissimo and his parasite
armies out, the reaction in the
United States was tumultuous.
China had been 'lost'—for
imperialist interests—but many
Americans were convinced that
this 'loss' was theirs as well. And
this has been the tragedy of the
last twenty years.
For it laid the basis of two
decades of anti-communism, and
opposition to China, among the
American people. Joe McCarthy

rose on the crest of this
sentiment, and the U.S.
government played to this
sentiment in justifying the Korean
War, the hostile encirclement of
China, support of Chiang and his
regime on Taiwan, fostering of
Japanese economic expansion into
Asia, and military rearmament,
and above all in war against the
peoples of Indochina.
Now China has broken through
the isolation. But whose isolation?
Not hers—she has had friendship
and contact with the peoples of
the world. Instead, it is the
isolation imposed on the
American people by the U.S.
government. Now, with American
citizens traveling in China,
and—soon—with Chinese friends
visiting in America, we are
beginning to bridge the gaps. We
have seen the Chinese pattern
again in Vietnam—as U.S. support
of Diem, Nhu, Ky and Thieu
followed earlier support of
Chiang.
It can happen yet again, in
Asia, Africa, Latin America. But it
will not happen if we oppose it
with the truth, and with true
friendship. This is the real
meaning of people-to-people
diplomacy, and it is the hope we
see in this year's changes.
