# Clarification By Ehrlich

Editor, THE DAILY:
On September 22 nd an
advertisement appeared in the
Daily listing me as one of the
sponsors. As many Daily readers
are aware, signatories to such
political messages may disagree to
a greater or lesser extent with
their exact wording.
In my own case I was strongly
moved by the request that there
be a deliberate and composed
atmosphere for the Advisory
Board hearing. I was much less
convinced, however, by the view
that a "Nuremberg Defense" was
illegitimate for Professor Franklin.
I do not wish to take a stand to

that effect.
It is my personal hope that if
Professor Franklin should choose
to raise that defense, that the
Advisory Board will listen to it
and judge its merits. I reiterate
what I have said before. I believe
the Advisory Board will give
Professor Franklin a fair hearing,
and would urge the entire
Stanford Community to do
everything possible to see that
Professor Franklin receives such a
hearing.
In that context I would like to
call the attention of the
community to the article by
Adam Bennion and Lee
Herzenberg in last Friday's Daily.
The question was raised as to the
need for funds to support
Professor Franklin's defense. In
discussing this with colleagues I
was distressed at the number of
"liberals" who felt Professor
Franklin's defense unworthy of

support, and wish to register in
public my disgust for that
attitude.
Even if Franklin were accused
of the most heinous crimes, the
Stanford Community should be
anxious to see that he had the
best defense available. I was, in
contrast, pleased to find support
for the latter view from some
people who might be expected to
have a strong interest in Franklin's
dismissal.
I am informed that those of all
political persuasions interested in
contributing to the Franklin
defense can do so (anonymously
if they wish) by sending money to
Len or Lee Herzenberg, Dept. of
Genetics. I urge my colleagues,
especially those unsympathetic
with Prof. Franklin's politics, to
examine their consciences and
then do what they think is right.
