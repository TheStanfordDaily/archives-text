WATCH OUT JAYHAWK
GAYS-Recently, the Daily
Kansan opined in favor of the
legalization of marijuana. Last
week, the Sunflower State's
Attorney General Vem Miller led
80 volunteers (with badges) in an
early morning narcotics raid. The
DK's latest crusade is against
Kansas' "Outdated Sex Laws,"
specifically homosexuality,
labelled "sodomy" in Jayhawk
law. If Gen. Miller is still reading
the Daily Kansan, guess who's
next.

commentary. According to
Maddox, the nation must "go
back to the death penalty" to
combat lawlessness and crime
whether the rapist, bomber or
wielder of the knife "be relatives
or friends of yours or mine."
Maddox's son has been arrested
twice for burglary. Abraham, do
your duty!
Oh No,. .Oh Yes, John
Scopes—the Tulane Hullabaloo
headlined page five last week with
"Sex is Barrier to Love." The
purveyor of that contention, Dr.

News, recently editorialized an
endorsement of the goals of the
Temple Women's Rights
Coalition. A few paragraphs later,
the News, talked about finding
"a capable man" for a
newly-created job in the personnel
department. Entering a plea of
guilty, the staff apologized saying,
"We'll try not to let it happen
again."
More on Academic Justice:
Washington State's Daily
Evergreen tells the sad story of
Mark Backman, who wrote a
paper on "Obscenity: Censorship
or Free Choice." The assignment
captured fourth place in the
Greenleaf Publishing Co. contest
on the same topic, and won
$1,000 for Backman. The paper,
originally written for Political
Science 402, managed to get
Backman only a C-plus in the
classroom.
Band Notes: Stanfordians will
never be plagued by the problems
of U Nevada at Las Vegas. From
The Yell, "The UNLV band
successfully thwarted any attempt
the cheerleaders made to revive
the sleepy-eyed crowd, by playing
their sleep-inducing music during
the cheers." While interruption of
Stanford's cheerleaders might very
well be applauded, the LSJUMB
will never be accused of playing
sleep-inducing music. Especially
against Duke or Purdue.
The Idaho Argonaut staff
deserves some accolade for being
such a good loser to the city of

Moscow, Idaho (known as 4 the
city with a smile' and home of UI)
for their edit on Moscow's
disenfranchisement of 18 to
20-year old student voters in city
elections: "So, students, you who
spend nine months of the year
here in Smiles, Idaho, you who
contribute so much to the
economy of Smiles and must live
by the laws of Smiles, you
without whom Smiles would still
be named Hog Haven and have a
population of six, are now legally
unfit (Oops! 1 mean unqualified.)
to vote in Smiles." Cheese,
everybody.

disenfranchisement of 18 to

elections: "So, students, you who
spend nine months of the year
here in Smiles, Idaho, you who
contribute so much to the
economy of Smiles and must live
by the laws of Smiles, you
without whom Smiles would still
be named Hog Haven and have a

GAYS-Recently, the Daily
Kansan opined in favor of the
legalization of marijuana. Last
week, the Sunflower State's
Attorney General Vem Miller led
80 volunteers (with badges) in an
early morning narcotics raid. The
DK's latest crusade is against
Kansas' "Outdated Sex Laws,"
specifically homosexuality,
labelled "sodomy" in Jayhawk
law. If Gen. Miller is still reading

next.

commentary. According to
Maddox, the nation must "go
back to the death penalty" to
combat lawlessness and crime
whether the rapist, bomber or
wielder of the knife "be relatives
or friends of yours or mine."
Maddox's son has been arrested
twice for burglary. Abraham, do
your duty!
Oh No,. .Oh Yes, John
Scopes—the Tulane Hullabaloo
headlined page five last week with
"Sex is Barrier to Love." The
purveyor of that contention, Dr.

News, recently editorialized an
endorsement of the goals of the
Temple Women's Rights
Coalition. A few paragraphs later,
the News, talked about finding
"a capable man" for a
newly-created job in the personnel
department. Entering a plea of

Washington State's Daily
Evergreen tells the sad story of
Mark Backman, who wrote a
paper on "Obscenity: Censorship
or Free Choice." The assignment
captured fourth place in the
Greenleaf Publishing Co. contest
on the same topic, and won
$1,000 for Backman. The paper,
originally written for Political
Science 402, managed to get
Backman only a C-plus in the
classroom.
Band Notes: Stanfordians will
never be plagued by the problems
of U Nevada at Las Vegas. From
The Yell, "The UNLV band
successfully thwarted any attempt
the cheerleaders made to revive
the sleepy-eyed crowd, by playing
their sleep-inducing music during
the cheers." While interruption of
Stanford's cheerleaders might very
well be applauded, the LSJUMB
will never be accused of playing
sleep-inducing music. Especially
against Duke or Purdue.
