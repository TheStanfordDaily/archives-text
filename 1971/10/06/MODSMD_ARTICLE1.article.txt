# Commission Report Recommends Full Powers For Campus Police
## 
### CHRIS PECK 
The Presidential Commission on the
Status of the Stanford Police released
its final report yesterday with the
recommendation that the campus
officers be given full law enforcement
powers.
At the present time, Stanford police
do not have "peace officer" status and
therefore can only citizens make
arrests. The Santa Clara County
Sheriff's office handles law
enforcement on campus.
The five-page list of
recommendations concerning the
Stanford Department concludes that
the present system of having two
security forces operating on campus is
'.'inefficient, conceptually flawed, and
operationally cumbersome."
"A divided responsibility obscures
lines of response and control and
confuses the definition of the police
officer's role for both officer and
citizen," the report continues. In the
past, there has been some dispute
between the Stanford Police and the
Santa Clara Sheriff's office about which
has the final say concerning law
enforcement decisions on campus.

The commission recommendation
that the Police Department assume
"both police service duties and law
enforcement duties on campus" is the
result of a four-month study by ten
faculty and staff members, chaired by
Leon E. Seltzer, director of the
University Press.
In addition to making
recommendations to the President
concerning the Department as a whole,
Seltzer said his commission investigated
possible candidates for Chief of Police
on campus.
"After a new chief was found,"
Seltzer continued, "we turned to the
question of the status of the Stanford
Police and it was the unanimous
conclusion of the commission that the
Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office
isn't by definition the police force for
Stanford University."
'Superior Understanding'
"It is therefore our conclusion that
Stanford should have an indigenous
police force, with peace officer status,"
Seltzer added, "because a local and
familiar police force will have an
understanding of its community clearly
superior to that of an outside force."
Newly named Stanford Police Chief

Marvin L. Herrington is known to favor
a "peace officer" status for his force,
but the chief is not sure how the new
status might be implemented.
Autonomy Remote
A number of possible ways to grant
"peace officer" status to the Stanford
police were investigated by the special
police commission, but only two
possibilities were judged "clearly
practical" by Seltzer's commission.
The police force either will have to
be deputized by the Santa Clara
County Sheriff's Office, the report
notes, or be organized as an
independent body under direct state
control.
This second possibility seems remote
since the California State Assembly
shelved the bill that would have created
a special police precinct for Stanford.

No matter how the Stanford police
attain a peace officer status, the
commission emphasized the importance
of University control over the force.
"It is of first importance that there
be established a new institutional
instrument to assure the ideal of a
responsive police force" on campus, the
report concludes in its last
recommendation. "Such a body would
advise the President and the Director of
Police on issues of general policy and
procedure."
Commission Chairman Seltzer
underscored the importance of this
final recommendation saying "We
believe it is essential that a body is set
up to see that the Stanford police are
responsible to our recommendations.
Our report is only the beginning of this
issue, only a guideline for further
study."

has the final say concerning law
enforcement decisions on campus.

The commission recommendation
that the Police Department assume
"both police service duties and law
enforcement duties on campus" is the
result of a four-month study by ten
faculty and staff members, chaired by
Leon E. Seltzer, director of the
University Press.
In addition to making
recommendations to the President
concerning the Department as a whole,
Seltzer said his commission investigated
possible candidates for Chief of Police
on campus.
"After a new chief was found,"
Seltzer continued, "we turned to the
question of the status of the Stanford
Police and it was the unanimous
conclusion of the commission that the
Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office
isn't by definition the police force for
Stanford University."
'Superior Understanding'
"It is therefore our conclusion that
Stanford should have an indigenous
police force, with peace officer status,"
Seltzer added, "because a local and
familiar police force will have an
understanding of its community clearly
superior to that of an outside force."
Newly named Stanford Police Chief

Marvin L. Herrington is known to favor
a "peace officer" status for his force,
but the chief is not sure how the new
status might be implemented.
Autonomy Remote
A number of possible ways to grant
"peace officer" status to the Stanford
police were investigated by the special
police commission, but only two
possibilities were judged "clearly
practical" by Seltzer's commission.
The police force either will have to
be deputized by the Santa Clara
County Sheriff's Office, the report
notes, or be organized as an
independent body under direct state
control.
This second possibility seems remote
since the California State Assembly
shelved the bill that would have created
a special police precinct for Stanford.

No matter how the Stanford police
attain a peace officer status, the
commission emphasized the importance
of University control over the force.
"It is of first importance that there
be established a new institutional
instrument to assure the ideal of a
responsive police force" on campus, the
report concludes in its last
recommendation. "Such a body would
advise the President and the Director of
Police on issues of general policy and
procedure."
Commission Chairman Seltzer
underscored the importance of this
final recommendation saying "We
believe it is essential that a body is set
up to see that the Stanford police are
responsible to our recommendations.
Our report is only the beginning of this
issue, only a guideline for further
study."

WE SERVE AND PROTECT—This Stanford policeman will be affected oy t'ie
shift in departmental responsibility outlined in the Presidential report released
yesterday.
The Presidential Commission on the
Status of the Stanford Police released
its final report yesterday with the
recommendation that the campus
officers be given full law enforcement
powers.
At the present time, Stanford police
do not have "peace officer" status and
therefore can only citizens make
arrests. The Santa Clara County
Sheriff's office handles law
enforcement on campus.
The five-page list of
recommendations concerning the
Stanford Department concludes that
the present system of having two
security forces operating on campus is
'.'inefficient, conceptually flawed, and
operationally cumbersome."
"A divided responsibility obscures
lines of response and control and
confuses the definition of the police
officer's role for both officer and
citizen," the report continues. In the
past, there has been some dispute
between the Stanford Police and the
Santa Clara Sheriff's office about which
has the final say concerning law
enforcement decisions on campus.
