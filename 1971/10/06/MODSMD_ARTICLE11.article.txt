# Simone Doubtful
## Injuries Plague Indians

their second day of workouts in

John Ralston already will admit
that fullback Hillary Shockley

Simone (sprained ankle) and wide
receiver Eric Cross (pulled
hamstring muscle) are doubtful
participants this weekend.
Moore Improved
According to Ralston,
linebacker Pat Moore, who has
missed the last three games with
an ankle injury is "getting better
and we hope he'll be up to full
effectiveness by Saturday."
The Indians worked for an
hour and 45 minutes yesterday on
all phases of their game and
Ralston termed the practice, "a
good learning session." He also

said that in the workout, the
defense "performed verv, very
well."

BUTLER BLOCKS IT—lndian defensive guard Larry Butler leaps to block Dave Wright's extra point
attempt in the first quarter of Stanford's 9-3 loss to the Blue Devils. Wright was attempting the extra
point after Ernie Jackson intercepted a Don Bunce pass and raced 54 yards for a touchdown. Wright
connected on a field goal later to complete Duke's scoring.
Injuries were still a problem
yesterday as Stanford finished
their second day of workouts in
preparation for Saturday's contest
with Washington in Seattle. Coach
John Ralston already will admit
that fullback Hillary Shockley
(sprained ankle), linebacker Mike
Simone (sprained ankle) and wide
receiver Eric Cross (pulled
hamstring muscle) are doubtful
participants this weekend.
Moore Improved
According to Ralston,
linebacker Pat Moore, who has
missed the last three games with
an ankle injury is "getting better
and we hope he'll be up to full
effectiveness by Saturday."
The Indians worked for an
hour and 45 minutes yesterday on
all phases of their game and
Ralston termed the practice, "a
good learning session." He also

said that in the workout, the
defense "performed verv, very
well."
Polls
In the national rankings this
week, Stanford dropped from
10th to 19th in Associated Press
and fell out of the Top Twenty in
the United Press International
Poll after being ranked 9th last
week.
Meanwhile, Washington coming
off last weekend's 52-14 romp
over Illinois, moved from 15th to
11th in AP and from 10th to 9 th
in UPI.
Tickets for Saturday's
closed-circuit broadcast of the
game in Maples Pavilion are still
available at the Stanford Athletic
Department. All $4.00 reserved
seats are sold out, but unreserved
seats are still being sold at $3.00
for the general public and $2.50
for students.
