In a change of policy, the
former club sport of sailing has
finally joined the ranks of
intercollegiate varsity sports that
the Stanford Athletic Department
offers.
A major result of the new
sailing program will be Stanford's
participation in the Douglas Cup,
a well-known intercollegiate
sailing regatta. The long-awaited
event will be held on October
28-30 at the Long Beach Yacht
Club.
For those persons interested,
there will be a sign-up meeting for
the team tomorrow at 7:30 p.m.
in room 420-041, downstairs in
the Psychology Building. Any
interested student who can not
make the meeting should call Greg
Schwab of KA House (327-9538).
With returning sailors Schwab,
Bob Burr and Craig Laitersdorf,
Stanford should improve on their
record of last year, despite the
heavy challenges of Southern
California and San Diego State.
Last season, the sailing club
managed to finish fourth in the
John F. Kennedy Cup Races held
at the Annapolis Naval Academy.
The Kennedy Cup is emblematic
of the United States keelboat
championship, and thus, the finish
proved to some degree Stanford's
placement in national sailing.
