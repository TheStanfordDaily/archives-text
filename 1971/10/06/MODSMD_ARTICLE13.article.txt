# Pac-8 Teams Begin Roses Quest
## 
### 
Having completed the bulk of
their non-conference schedules,
the Pacific-8 teams will begin their
battle for the Rose Bowl berth
this weekend.
Conference action will be
highlighted by the
Stanford-Washington
confrontation in Seattle this
Saturday. These two squads have
dominated Pac-8 statistics in the
first four games and the winner of
the game will undoubtedly be the
early season favorite to meet the
Big-Ten champion in Pasadena on
New Year's Day.
The other Pac-8 battles this
weekend will feature Oregon State
at California, Oregon at USC, and
UCLA at Washington State.
Oregon State racked up an
impressive 34-17 victory over the
Bruins last weekend and promises
to severely challenge the Bears.
The Pac-B's runaway total
offense leaders, Don Bunce and
Sonny Sixkiller, will get a close
view of each other Saturday.
Bunce leads the conference in
total yards with 978 for an
average of 244.5 per game.
Sixkiller follows Bunce closely
with 899 yards and an average of
224.8. Their nearest competitor
has amassed only 678 yards.
In the passing department,
Sixkiller has a slight edge on
Bunce, with 949 yards to the
Indian quarterback's 909. Bunce's
completion average of .523 tops
Sixkiller, but the Trojan's Jimmy
Jones is the conference leader
with an astounding average of
.621.
Stanford and Washington
dominate the top two spots in

team statistics after four games.
The Indian defense leads the
league, having allowed opponents
only one touchdown and 217
yards per game. The Huskie
defense is second with an average
of 237 yards, but they have given
up 10 touchdowns.
Washington leads the league in
rushing defense and is fourth in
passing defense while Stanford
occupies second place in both
categories. USC is the Pac-8 leader
in pass defense with a game
average of only 56 yards to the
Indian's 93.
The Huskie offense paces the
conference in total yardage with
an average of 456 per game that
have netted them 23 touchdowns.
The Stanford attack is second in
the conference with a game
average 403.8 and a total of 12
touchdowns. The Indian's rate a
lowly sixth in rushing while
Washington could manage only a
fifth place ranking in that
category. Sixkiller and Bunce's
domination of the league's passing
statistics shows up in the team
statistics as Washington and
Stanford pace the conference in
total passing yardage.
Miles Moore is tied for second
in the individual receiving
competition with 18 catches for
470 yards. Leonard Glass of
Oregon has seven more catches

than Moore but has netted only
315 yards to the Indian reciever's
total of 470.
In the individual rushing
department, Jackie Brown ranks
eighth in the conference with a
per game average of 43.8.
Washington's leading runner
occupies tenth place.
