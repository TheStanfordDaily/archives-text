Nixon Awaits Board
WASHINGTON—President Nixon awaited yesterday
the report of an inquiry board before deciding
whether to seek a Taft-Hartley interruption of dock
strikes which have paralyzed most of the deepwater
ports on the East, West and Gulf Coasts.
Meanwhile, 80,000 United Mine Workers were idle
for a fifth day in 20 coal-producing states. A
spokesman for the striking miners said negotiators
were "not even close" on a union demand for a
$13-a-day boost above the current top wage of $37 a
day.
Kissinger To Visit China
WASHINGTON —President Nixon apparently
ready to proceed with plans to visit Communist
China, is sending foreign-policy adviser Henry A.
Kissinger back to Peking this month to "make
concrete arrangements."
The announcement of Kissinger's plans suggests
that whatever group is in control in Communist China
means to establish effective communication with the
United States, regardless of political conflicts.

New Induction Quota
WASHINGTON Selective Service officials
announced yesterday that men classified as IA in this
year's draft pool won't be called if their lottery
numbers are over 125, but all with numbers below
that can expect a summons.
Missile Funds Vetoed
WASHINGTON — The Senate yesterday rejected
three proposals to add funds for major U.S.
offensive-missile systems after Sen. John C. Stannis
cautioned against doing anything to jeopardize
chances for a U.S.-Soviet arms-limitation agreement.
The Senate also voted down a proposal to stop
U.S. air attacks in Indochina as it neared final passage
of a $21-billion military procurement authorization
bill.
Viet Cong Retreat
SAIGON — North Vietnamese forces have withdrawn
from the Cambodian border battle area after suffering
heavy losses in their 10-day offensive, according to
the South Vietnamese commander of the campaign.

Lt. Gen. Nguyen Van Minh said the North
Vietnamese had lost an estimated 450 men in the
campaign on the Cambodian-Vietnam border.
Pakistani Aid Suspended
WASHINGTON— The Senate Foreign Relations
Committee approved yesterday the House-voted
suspension of U.S. aid to Pakistan.
The provision provides that all U.S. economic,
military and other aid, including sales of military
equipment and agricultural commodities, be stopped
until the Pakistani government cooperates in
stabilizing the situation in East Pakistan and permits
refugees to return.
Aid would be resumed when President Nixon
certified to Congress that those actions had taken
place.

WASHINGTON — The Senate yesterday rejected
three proposals to add funds for major U.S.
offensive-missile systems after Sen. John C. Stannis
cautioned against doing anything to jeopardize
chances for a U.S.-Soviet arms-limitation agreement.
The Senate also voted down a proposal to stop
U.S. air attacks in Indochina as it neared final passage
of a $21-billion military procurement authorization
bill.
Viet Cong Retreat
SAIGON — North Vietnamese forces have withdrawn
from the Cambodian border battle area after suffering
heavy losses in their 10-day offensive, according to
the South Vietnamese commander of the campaign.

Lt. Gen. Nguyen Van Minh said the North
Vietnamese had lost an estimated 450 men in the
campaign on the Cambodian-Vietnam border.
Pakistani Aid Suspended
WASHINGTON— The Senate Foreign Relations
Committee approved yesterday the House-voted
suspension of U.S. aid to Pakistan.
The provision provides that all U.S. economic,
military and other aid, including sales of military
equipment and agricultural commodities, be stopped
until the Pakistani government cooperates in
stabilizing the situation in East Pakistan and permits
refugees to return.
Aid would be resumed when President Nixon
certified to Congress that those actions had taken
place.
