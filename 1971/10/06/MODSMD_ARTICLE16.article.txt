# Harrington Proposes Youth, Labor Alliance
## 
### GARY ATKINS 
The achievement of massive social
change in the United States will depend
upon cooperation between the youth
and trade union movements, according
to Michael Harrington, national
chairman of the Socialist Party.
Harrington, in a speech at
Dinkelspiel Auditorium last night, said
he felt an alliance between the two
movements was necessary, first, to
defeat Richard Nixon in 1972; and
second, to build what he called
"democratic collectivism"—a society
concerned with social welfare of people
and not of corporations.
Harrington is the author of The
Other America, a book about poverty
in the United States, and Toward a
Democratic Left.
Speaking to an audience of about
200, Harrington made three major
points:
1) that the youth movement, in its
concern for social welfare, is not a
transitory phenomenon;

2) that the American labor
movement is "the largest, most
cohesive force for social change" iu the
nation;
3)that "the movement by young
people will have significance only if it
relates itself to the labor movement."
"And here," Harrington said, "I'm
talking about the AFL-CIO, not some
imaginary proletarian with a copy of
Das Kapital in his hip pocket. .."
Harrington disputed arguments that
the youth movement was only a
temporary thing, and that the working
class in America was disappearing
Much of Harrington's speech was
aimed at persuading students that
unions were not as conservative as some
might think.
The unions, he said, are really a
"social democratic movement" that
does not call itself by its own name.
When you look under the rhetoric
about pro-capitalist American unions,
you find them doing essentially the
same things as the European socialist
parties.
