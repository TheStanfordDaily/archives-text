# 'Arbitrary' Senate Bill Opposed By Lyman
## 
### TONY BOLLEN 
President Lyman last night
reiterated his opposition to the
California Senate bill which would
grant university presidents the power to
bar potential troublemakers from
campus.
In the first of this year's series of
bi-weekly press conferences broadcast
over KZSU, Lyman said he felt the
powers which would be granted him
under the Bradley Bill (Senate Bill 818 )
to be "over-broad and arbitrary."
Lyman, asked if he would be
tempted to use the power to ban
individuals from campus should the bill
pass, conceded that the temptation
might exist. He added, "The reason
people oppose conferring arbitrary
power on an individual is that he's
likely to use it arbitrarily."
While opposing the Bradley Bill,
which is aimed primarily at
trouble-plagued private colleges and
universities, Lyman has said he favors a
measure outlawing disruptions in the
classroom, a law which he says already
exists for public institutions.
In another segment of the
conference, Lyman said he would
neither comment nor answer questions
regarding the hearing of Professor H.
Bruce Franklin. "I don't wish to
prejudice the case either way," Lyman
said. "That consideration outweighs all
others."
Only after the trial is concluded,

Lyman emphasized, should his own
"personal accountability" for the case
be discussed.
Responding to a question raised by
an article in a national news magazine
reporting that Stanford is seeking
reinstatement of its ROTC programs,
Lyman said the information is
incorrect. The article, titled "ROTC
Stages a Comeback," appears in the
current (October 11) issue of U.S.
News and World Report, and claims
that Stanford "is reported to have
approached the Pentagon" about
having ROTC reestablished here.
Lyman attributed the false
information to the fact that the
Defense Department has asked
Stanford if the university wants ROTC
back. The school's answer is "no,"
Lyman said: "We are proceeding with
the phase-out on schedule." All ROTC
will be gone from campus by June
1973.
President Lyman was also asked if
he feels optimistic concerning
prevention of campus violence this
year.
"The only alternative is to feel
pessimistic," he said. "So I'm
optimistic."
Posing questions at the interview
were Robert Fuss and Robert
Lundstrom of KZSU, Chris Hocker of
the Arena, and Tony Bollen and Mark
Bisnow of the Daily. Pete Williams,
KZSU news director moderated the
program.

to be "over-broad and arbitrary."
Lyman, asked if he would be
tempted to use the power to ban
individuals from campus should the bill
pass, conceded that the temptation
might exist. He added, "The reason
people oppose conferring arbitrary
power on an individual is that he's
likely to use it arbitrarily."
While opposing the Bradley Bill,
which is aimed primarily at
trouble-plagued private colleges and
universities, Lyman has said he favors a
measure outlawing disruptions in the
classroom, a law which he says already
exists for public institutions.
In another segment of the
conference, Lyman said he would
neither comment nor answer questions
regarding the hearing of Professor H.
Bruce Franklin. "I don't wish to
prejudice the case either way," Lyman
said. "That consideration outweighs all
others."
Only after the trial is concluded,

Lyman emphasized, should his own
"personal accountability" for the case
be discussed.
Responding to a question raised by
an article in a national news magazine
reporting that Stanford is seeking
reinstatement of its ROTC programs,
Lyman said the information is
incorrect. The article, titled "ROTC
Stages a Comeback," appears in the
current (October 11) issue of U.S.
News and World Report, and claims
that Stanford "is reported to have
approached the Pentagon" about
having ROTC reestablished here.
Lyman attributed the false
information to the fact that the
Defense Department has asked
Stanford if the university wants ROTC
back. The school's answer is "no,"
Lyman said: "We are proceeding with
the phase-out on schedule." All ROTC
will be gone from campus by June
1973.
President Lyman was also asked if
he feels optimistic concerning
prevention of campus violence this
year.
"The only alternative is to feel
pessimistic," he said. "So I'm
optimistic."
Posing questions at the interview
were Robert Fuss and Robert
Lundstrom of KZSU, Chris Hocker of
the Arena, and Tony Bollen and Mark
Bisnow of the Daily. Pete Williams,
KZSU news director moderated the
program.

bi-weekly KZSU press conferences last night.
President Lyman last night
reiterated his opposition to the
California Senate bill which would
grant university presidents the power to
bar potential troublemakers from
campus.
In the first of this year's series of
bi-weekly press conferences broadcast
over KZSU, Lyman said he felt the
powers which would be granted him
under the Bradley Bill (Senate Bill 818 )
to be "over-broad and arbitrary."
Lyman, asked if he would be
tempted to use the power to ban
individuals from campus should the bill
pass, conceded that the temptation
might exist. He added, "The reason
people oppose conferring arbitrary
power on an individual is that he's
