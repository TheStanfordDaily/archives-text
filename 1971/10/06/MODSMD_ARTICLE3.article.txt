# Dean Pettit To Head Georgia Tech
## 
### DANIEL BRENNER 
Joseph Mayo Pettit, Dean of the
School of Engineering for the last 12
years, has been named president of
Georgia Institute of Technology. The
announcement was made yesterday at
an Institute Board of Regents meeting
in Atlanta.
At his office in the engineering
quad, Pettit, 55, spoke of his new
position "with some favorable
anticipation."
He received his B.S. with honors
from Berkeley in 1938, his Engineering
degree in 1940 and his PhD. from
Stanford in 1942. He taught at
Berkeley and Stanford before World
War 11.
Serving on the staff of the radio
research laboratory at Harvard and with
the Air Force in India and China, he
was awarded in 1949 Presidential
Certificate of Merit.
Appointed Dean
Returning to Stanford in 1947,
Pettit was appointed dean in 1958.
Among other honors, he is
president-elect of the American Society
for Engineering Education, is a
consultant to programs in Latin
America for the Ford Foundation and
the Organization of American States,
and is a member of the national
committee on instructional television,
which advises the Federal
Communications Commission.
President Richard Lyman said: "It
hurts to lose Stanford's senior dean,
Joseph Pettit, and the only
compensation is the thought of the
opportunity he'll have to bring his
formidable abilities to bear as president
of a major institution such as Georgia
Tech."

Assistand dean of the School, Alfred
Kirkland, feels that Pettit has done an
outstanding job, maintaining overall
control of the complete schoo!.
Honest Man
Long time campus activist Yale
Braunstein described Pettit as "a totally
honest man" with whom he disagreed
often but nevertheless "respected."
During the spring of 1969, after the
sit-in at the Applied Electronics
Laboratory, Pettit announced his
decision to phase out all classified work
in the engineering school, regardless of
the stand taken by other departments
in the University.

Among those innovations that are
attributed to Pettit's tenure are the
Undergraduate Council for the
Engineering School, a group of 24
professors, six of whom are directly
elected by students, to plan programs
and resolve problems for undergraduate
engineering students.
Engineering Jobs Available
Pettit also was responsible for the
first student evaluations of teaching
appointments at the tenure level.
He initiated the microwave
television network which facilitates

part-time graduate and continuing
engineering education in the Bay Area.
Although set up on a small scale, this
program is one of the first of its kind.
The dean believes that the recent
concern over lack of jobs for engineers
is not justified. For example, he
commented of the 168 graduates of the
school last year, all but five had been
placed within 30 days of graduation.
During his deanship, more than half
of all Stanford's engineering degrees
have been awarded and over 50 per
cent of the present engineering faculty
have been appointed.

from Berkeley in 1938, his Engineering
degree in 1940 and his PhD. from
Stanford in 1942. He taught at
Berkeley and Stanford before World
War 11.
Serving on the staff of the radio
research laboratory at Harvard and with
the Air Force in India and China, he
was awarded in 1949 Presidential
Certificate of Merit.
Appointed Dean
Returning to Stanford in 1947,
Pettit was appointed dean in 1958.
Among other honors, he is
president-elect of the American Society
for Engineering Education, is a
consultant to programs in Latin
America for the Ford Foundation and
the Organization of American States,
and is a member of the national
committee on instructional television,
which advises the Federal
Communications Commission.
President Richard Lyman said: "It
hurts to lose Stanford's senior dean,
Joseph Pettit, and the only
compensation is the thought of the
opportunity he'll have to bring his
formidable abilities to bear as president
of a major institution such as Georgia
Tech."

Assistand dean of the School, Alfred
Kirkland, feels that Pettit has done an
outstanding job, maintaining overall
control of the complete schoo!.
Honest Man
Long time campus activist Yale
Braunstein described Pettit as "a totally
honest man" with whom he disagreed
often but nevertheless "respected."
During the spring of 1969, after the
sit-in at the Applied Electronics
Laboratory, Pettit announced his
decision to phase out all classified work
in the engineering school, regardless of
the stand taken by other departments
in the University.

Among those innovations that are
attributed to Pettit's tenure are the
Undergraduate Council for the
Engineering School, a group of 24
professors, six of whom are directly
elected by students, to plan programs
and resolve problems for undergraduate
engineering students.
Engineering Jobs Available
Pettit also was responsible for the
first student evaluations of teaching
appointments at the tenure level.
He initiated the microwave
television network which facilitates

part-time graduate and continuing
engineering education in the Bay Area.
Although set up on a small scale, this
program is one of the first of its kind.
The dean believes that the recent
concern over lack of jobs for engineers
is not justified. For example, he
commented of the 168 graduates of the
school last year, all but five had been
placed within 30 days of graduation.
During his deanship, more than half
of all Stanford's engineering degrees
have been awarded and over 50 per
cent of the present engineering faculty
have been appointed.

School of Engineering for the last 12

announcement was made yesterday at
an Institute Board of Regents meeting

quad, Pettit, 55, spoke of his new
position "with some favorable
anticipation."
