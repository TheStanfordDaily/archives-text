# 'Franklin Incited Action'
## Beyers Relates Rally Incidents 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
News Service Director Bob Beyers yesterday told
the Advisory Board that after an evening speech by
suspended English Professor H. Bruce Franklin on
February 10, "there was no doubt in my mind that
there would be some disruptive or illegal acts that
night."
Franklin has been charged with inciting violence in
his evening speech.
Beyers was one of two persons to testify as the
hearing of Franklin on charges of misconduct as a
professor entered its seventh session.
The major portion of yesterday' hearing was spent
in a marathon two and one-half hour
cross-examination of Beyers by Franklin.
Franklin still had not finished when the hearing
adjourned at 6:40 p.m. and he will resume today.
Beyers' Memory
The Marxist scholar questioned Beyers about
speeches and events around February 10, and asked
why Beyers could remember parts of his speeches
very well but other events only vaguely.
Beyers said that he looked at all events as a general
assignment reporter and whether he remembered
things usually depended on how newsworthy they
were.
At one point late in the proceedings Advisory
Board Chairman Donald Kennedy admonished
Franklin for his extended cross-examination and
added that it had been "rather unrevealing and rather
aimless." This statement touched off sharp protests
from the defense table.
Later Franklin told Kennedy "I'm uncomfortable
with you pressing me on time with regard to the
witness. . .A great deal, not all, but a great deal of
your opinion and your views of me have been shaped
by the communication that this man sends to your
office all the time.

In his direct testimony Beyers said that at an
evening rally in the Old Union Courtyard on
February 10 Franklin had "called very specifically for
a people's war against the occupation anny (San Jose
Police), and said that people should go back to their
dorms to meet in small groups to do their own thing
as late at night as possible, to bring more of the
occupation army here to help our brethren in other
parts of the community."
Beyers added that the meeting was "not going
anywhere" until Franklin spoke and then the mood
changed "quite dramatically" and "my very clear
impression at the end of the speech was that there
were going to be numerous small incidents."
But under cross-examination he said that "I don't
remember any specific advocacy of violence at the
meeting."
Beyers also testified that after the evening speech
he saw a beaten Free Campus Movement (FCM)
member lying on the ground between the bookstore
and Mem Claw. The FCMer said he had done nothing
to provoke the attack, Beyers added.

He also said that at a White Plaza rally at noon on
the 10th Franklin had spoken in favor of action on
campus and "called for the audience to shut dow
the most obvious machinery of the war starting wv i
the Computation Center."
Franklin is also charged with inciting an
occupation of the Computation Center laW>r that
afternoon.
Early in yesterday's proceedings Or )avid 1
Torin, the associate director of the C )wtll Health
Center had talked of treating students for head and
face lacerations and contusions the day of i'we 10th.
and treating at midnight a student who r ntly
had been shot in the leg.
At the time Dr. Torn had said that the >
had explained that they received the injuries lr> i
rocks and fists, except for the student who a
was shot.
In other matters concerning the case, it is expected
that the prosecution will finish presenting its evid< :<
before Friday. At that time Franklin will beg •)
defense.
'People's Offense'
During several recesses yesterday Vencerpintr
member Gerry Foote announced that Franklin',
defense was being called "People's Offense.'
She said that when th» Marxist began to preseni
his evidence, either Thursday or Friday, there would
be a rally in White Plaza and a flag-carryir.g march to
the hearing in Physics 101 to "really put some spirit
into this thing."
Meanwhile it has been learned that Franklin
received a $500 gift Monday from a professor who
wishes to remain anonymous. He was "concerned
that Bruce get a fair trial and not be hampered or
penalized by a lack of funds."
The hearing resumes today at 1 p.m.
