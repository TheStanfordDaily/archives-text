## 'Academic Freedom' & Other Myths

Everybody said, year after
year, that it was inevitable.
Most Stanford trustees are rich
corporate liberals. Most Stanford
administrators and professors are
complacent academic liberals.
Bruce Franklin is a noisy
Marxist-Leninist. Today, most
Stanford trustees, administrators
and professors are merrily
preparing to wave good-bye to
Bruce Franklin. Big surprise.
Even the least imaginative
among us must have long ago
expected an intensified liberal
backlash against all those
embarrassing questions
revolutionaries continually raise
about Stanford's multi-million
dollar complicity in the Defense
Department's Asian adventures.
What is more interesting, and
more enlightening, than the
ongoing fulfillment of such
anticipations, is the remarkable
extent to which the circumstances
of the Franklin Case and Bruce
Franklin himself have thrown into
sharp relief a pattern of university
hostility toward left-wing
dissenters stretching throughout
Stanford's history.
Political Origins
The intensely political origins
of Stanford make its particular

sensitivity to radical voices easily
understandable. Leland Stanford
was a rabid Republican, a
Governor of California and a
millionaire businessman. A
prominent "robber baron,"
Stanford accumulated the millions
that made his university's
existence possible through the
profits of the Central Pacific
Railroad system, constructed
largely by underpaid, overworked
Asian laborers, substantial
numbers of whom did not survive
the experience.
Half a century before Bruce
Franklin was born, historians were
documenting the systematic
process of violent exploitation
that was the basis of Leland
Stanford's "institution for the
benefit of mankind" at Palo Alto.
Image Of Creator
The university was fashioned
to the image and likeness of its
creator. Interested mainly in the
"practical" vocations, Leland Sr.,
initially wanted only an
engineering school. Then, David
Starr Jordan was selected as the
first president on the strength of
his firm executive ability to
manage the university "like the
president of a railroad."
Jordan, an unusually autocratic

individual even for the 1890s,
despised faculty deanships,
autonomous departments, the
idea of permanent tenure for any
professor whatsoever, faculty
participation in the selection and
confirmation of new professors,
and faculty meetings held more
than oi.ce a year. At the same
time, Jordan was incapable of
making a speech or composing an
essay without including large
chunks of praise for the concept
of "academic freedom".
Jordan (the most celebrated of
all Stanford's presidents) presided
over the then-famous case of
Professor Edward A. Ross. Ross
was a noted Professor of
Economics who, in May of 1900,
gave a speech opposing cheap
foreign labor and favoring
municipal ownership of public
utilities (which included
Stanford-owned streetcar
systems). The very foundations of
the university had been called into
question, and Mrs. Jane Lathrop
Stanford wrote accordingly to
Jordan, her employee: "I must
confess I am weary of Professor
Ross mixing in political affairs,
and I think he ought not to be
retained at Stanford
University .... God forbid that
Stanford University should ever
favor socialism of any kind."
(Quoted in Elliot, Stanford
University, The First Twenty-Five
Years.)
By autumn, Ross had been
forced out, seven other professors
had resigned in protest, and
faculty participation in political
activity of any kind was officially
forbidden.
For the Wealthy
Although university
restrictions have been necessarily

eased over the years, Mrs.
Stanford's political prescriptions
for her beloved institution have
never lost their hold over
successive presidents and
administrators. Stanford's
reputation in" the twentieth
century as in the nineteenth was
that of a suburban spa for the
offspring of wealthy, conservative
Californians and equally
conservative professors.
With the post-war advent of
the Stanford Research Institute,
the industrial park, and
numerous on-campus
government research projects,
many of the professors became
wealthy as well. Thus, as the
McCarthyist frenzy of the 1950s
made neo-fascists out of
"conservative" and "liberal" alike,
Stanford professors joined
energetically in the renewed
crusade against "socialism of any
kind." As always, "academic
freedom" was a favorite battlecry.
The most obvious target was
Paul Baran, the Professor of
Economics so well-known—
particularly in the poor countries
of the world—for his book on
imperialism and underdevelop
ment, The Political Economy of
Growth. Baran responded to
widespread opposition and
pressure from Stanford trustees,
alumni, administrators, professors,
and some students by taking ever
firmer stands in support of the
Cuban Revolution, at a time when
the American government and
public were near-frantic in their
anti-Communism.
Politics And Pay
The matter came to a head in
1962-63, when a salary increase,
recommended by the economics
department chairman, was denied
apparently due to intervention by
then-President Sterling. Baran
discussed the situation at Stanford
in letters to his friend and fellow
economist Paul Sweezy, on June
39,1961 :
"Had yesterday dinner with
( ). He was shown the whole
mountain of correspondence that
the administration has received in
re: you and me and Cuba.
Apparently an impressive heap.
He also saw the (more or less)
standard letter which was sent to

the writers by the President's
office. Even he remarked that the
letter was despicable.
"It did not point out that the
University was committed to the
principle of academic freedom or
anything of the sort, but stressed
its having the very difficult
problem of my having tenure. The
business of freezing my salary, far
from being treated as a secret, is
being widely advertised (among
donors) to show that nothing
would be done to 'encourage me
to stay here."
And again, more forcefully, on
May 26,1963:
"The University situation,
while rationally understandable
and obvious, contributes to the
emotional misery. Both the
bloody hypocrisy of those sob's as
well as the sheer Schweinerei
involved. For next year I got a
teaching load that is about twice
as large as that of my "peers,"
with pay of about 6 0 % of theirs,
and all this with a broad grin:
'look at us, how democratic and
free and tolerant we are!' The
President (Sterling) observed that
there are no complaints about my
teaching or 'scholarship,' but my
utterances in public are
'irresponsible."
Finally, the university was
spared any difficult decisions on
what to do with Baran, by a
sudden heart attack on the
evening of March 26, 19 64. He
was fifty-three.
After his death, Isaac
Deutscher wrote: "Every now and
then I could not help reflecting on
the sad incongruity of Baran's
position at Stanford. Not only
was he the only Marxist
economist teaching at an
American university, but his
university looked more like a
place of entertainment for
children of rich Americans than
like a seat of learning.. . His
voice was as if muted; sometimes
he could speak only in a whisper."
White Plaza Vigil
One year after Paul Baran's
death, the Stanford movement
against the U.S. war in Vietnam
began in earnest. In October,
1965, Prof. H. Bruce Franklin
took part in a pacifist anti-war
vigil in White Plaza. He and the

others were attacked and beaten
up by right-wing stuHents, then
thrown into the fountain.
The next month, a
student-faculty group began a
blood drive for the many
Vietnamese victims of U.S.
bombing. Speaking in support of
the drive in White Plaza, Franklin
was pelted with garbage and called
a "dirty Jew bastard" by ROTC
students who then received
"leadership credit" to improve
their grades for their actions.
As the movement developed
over the years of protest marches
and sit-ins, the extensive role of
Stanford professors and research
groups in providing advanced
weapons systems and
counterinsurgency programs, like
the Staley Plan for "strategic
hamlets," became more blatantly
obvious (for further information,
see the recently-published
SWOPSI report on Defense Dept.
research at Stanford) to ever
larger numbers of people.
Stanford's Role
This, in turn, led to the
realization of Stanford's central
position in the "Pacific Rim
Strategy", designed to preserve
and increase U.S. corporate
exploitation of the labor and
resources of Third World nations
along the Pacific Basin, thus
insuring their politico-economic
dependence on the major
corporations.
While Stanford researchers
were providing the hardware to
back up this strategy and the
Graduate School of Business'
overseas programs were producing
some of its functionaries, the
many corporation directors on the
Board of Trustees made up a
sizeable portion of its leadership
and its main beneficiaries.
One attention had been
focused on Stanford involvement
in the war, the old pattern of
university opposition to left-wing

dissent became more pronounced
and well-outlined than ever
before. Under the leadership of
Richard Lyman, first as Provost
and now as President, masses of
riot-unit police were called onto
the campus with record-breaking
regularity, beginning with the
dawn assault on an April Third
Movement sit-in at Encina Hall in
May, 1969, and continuing with
full force into 1971.
Throughout this period of
time, Bruce Franklin remained the
most outspoken faculty opponent
to U.S. and Stanford policies. The
protests, in early 1971, against
former U.S. Ambassador to
Saigon Henry Cabot Lodge (see
The Pentagon Papers) and against
Computation Center research on
"amphibious assaults" proved to
be the last straw for Richard
Lyman.
Witlf depressing predictability,
Lyman and his liberal faculty
friends invoked the traditionalist
non-entity — ''academic
freedom"—for the newest
witch-hunt. In pathetically
ridiculous Daily advertisements as
in the university prosecutor's
opening statement at the Franklin
hearing, the "academic freedom"
of Stanford professors to plan
amphibious invasions and design
missiles and electronic warfare
devices is upheld against the right
of Bruce Franklin and others to
oppose them.
The two words which
Stanford's history as a university
have rendered nearly meaningless
are once again thrown at those
few who charge, with Sartre,
"You, who are so liberal and so
humane, who have such an
exaggerated adoration of culture
that it verges on affectation, you
pretend to forget that you own
colonies and that in them men are
massacred in your name."
