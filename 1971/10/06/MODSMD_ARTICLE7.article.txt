## Prolegomena To Any Future Metaphysiques

Editor's Note: Prolegomena is a
three-part series starting today
and continuing tomorrow and
Friday.
There's been a lot of
excitement lately about the plight
of our Damsel-in-Distress, caught
hopelessly in the grips of the Big
Time Machine. Yes, I'm talking
about that Pillar of American
strength—the hard-trying young
athlete. Even Psychology Today
has jumped on the wagon with a
piece entitled, "Sports: If You
Want to Build Character: Try
Something Else," which can be
glossed in a fast minute in the
latest issue of that magazine.
And, as we all know, Mr.
McClure has held the dubious
honor (and probably a
goodly extra sum of money) of
broaching the subject to the press
in a glorious effort to rid us all of
the notion that even the most

traditional strongholds of the old
America are not fast falling into
the web of the new social
consciousness.
I really can't do better than to
quote him: "We don't want the
pressure and the hero-worshippers
and the phoney stereotypes
created by publicity men's
typewriters. We just want control
of our own sport." Great. Fine.
Fashionable feelings are always
fine, if you like the fashion, and
there shouldn't be too much
reason to deny these
bone-breaking boys their share of
the freedom and dignity in their
game that the system claims to
give them in its own.
Why The Pit?
Then why, 1 ask myself, this
pit in the bottom of my stomach?
I've never had ulcers. Never
needed seltzers. And yet there is
something going on in me when I

read these articles that is curiously
like that old rabble-rouser—yes,
I'm talking about fear.
This article is my attempt to
come to terms with this fear and
to express it to you, that is, to
anyone who will hear me out.
And, as with any attempt to
behave rationally under emotional
circumstances, I hope that the
reader will maintain the patience
to wade through the digressions
and misrepresentations that are
bound to occur in the process.
I shall begin with trying to
state the basis for this
apprehension about the growing
trend away from dehumanization
in organized sports. This
apprehension rests upon the far
deeper social and psychological
significance of such activities.
Against The Coach
Regarding the previous year's
scrimmage with the Athletic

Establishment, Mr. Horowitz
maintains that "the most unifying
factor in last year's team was the
feeling of the players for one
another—not the coaches."
Implicit in this statement is the
simultaneously differentiated fact
that an even further unifying
factor was the mutual feeling of
the players against the coach.
It is one of my purposes here
to emphasize the possibility that
this common negative feeling is
perhaps one of the factors which
differentiates a winning team
from a losing one—and, more
importantly—a sane society from
a sick one. I hope I can show how
unparadoxical this statement
really is.
The parallel of modern football
(and any rugged, potentially
destructive "sport" for that
matter) with the military is almost
too obvious to require

mentioning—one would think. But
an often too universal fact is that
it is the obvious that is the last to
be recognized and understood. It
is not enough to recognize that
things are as they are and base
rejection upon this recognition
alone. We must ask why they are
as they are—that is, study the
history of their structural
evolution in order to understand
their function from as broad a
perspective as is possible.
Microcosm?
My reasons for emphasizing the
parallel, therefore, go much
deeper than any attempt to
merely pass judgment on the
actuality of football as a
microcosm of war or of a "sick
society." Rather, it is to state the
probable reasons that organized
sports exist as they do, the
functions they serve for society,
and the great danger which
accrues when a means-ends
reversal, so common to affluent
societies, comes to pass and our
games become our "realities"
while our "realities" fast turn into
games.
The character of "The Coach"
as portrayed by many players of
late has the unmistakable ring of
"The Sargeant" in Sad Sack or a
Gomer Pyle episode. This is not to
belittle the seriousness of the
feelings of these athletes. Quite to
the contrary. Our best
humor—often the only means of
psychological survival—is made
possible by the existence of
realities so deep or forbidden that
the only socially acceptable way
to approach them is through an
often unconscious twist of the
logic. So we shall ask ourselves
not what we can do to rid
ourselves of war or the attitude in
organized sports which resembles
it, but why we might need such
realities and attitudes.
Vicarious Release
Especially in an academic
institution—an environment
purported to be solely devoted to
the pursuit of rational inquiry—is

it necessary to remember that
Man is in great part characterized
by any but rational qualities. He
has undeniably aggressive energies
which will be released—directly, if
a vicarious means for the
channeling of these energies is not
provided. Organized sports
provides just such a vicarious
release-obviously not for the
participants on the field—they
receive their release quite
directly—but for the masses of
spectators whose civilizing
influence their direct expression
of aggression serves. Especially in
an academic community, where so
much of these energies are
sublimated, is an aggressive,
potentially destructive "sport" a
necessity.
In terms of this community,
such activities serve much the
same purpose as "real" battle
games do for the society at large.
But the most important point to
realize is the reciprocal
relationship which exists between
the real-games and the game-games
and the danger which exists when
the implicit goals, or unconscious
motivations, of such games
become either conscious,
suppressed, or impossible to
realize.
What do I mean by "implicit
goals?" The dictionary definition
of a game helps to delineate what
I don't mean:
"A game is a procedure for
gaining an end in physical or
mental competition conducted
according to rules with the
participants, individuals or teams
(compound individuals) in direct
opposition to each other; a play
for a stake." What this definition
leaves out is the most important
fact: the purpose of games is to
achieve one goal while stating
quite another. An example or two
will help to clarify the significance
of this additional, unspoken
"rule." (Though the definition of
a game includes its "rules" and its
"goals," and part of the definition
of a definition is that it be
absolutely explicit).

First of all, the observation
that we take our "games" quite
seriously. Look around at any of
the "important" football games.
The stands are veritably seething
with "fans," the virulent and
impotent alike, carrying on with
the greatest of passion screaming
such subtleties as "Kill Mm!,
Smear 'em!, Murder the Coach!"
And the best part of it all is that
you don't have to concentrate all
your attention on the "enemy,"
as the "friends" will do just as
nicely. You can tear apart either,
verbally of course, with all the
vehemence your deprived little
hearts desire.
So, we take our games quite
seriously, and well so. Tomorrow:
a more "rational" sport.
