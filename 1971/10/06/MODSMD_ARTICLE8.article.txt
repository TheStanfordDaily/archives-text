The flight of ten million East Pakistanis over India's eastern border
and the effect of this flight on the people of Pakistan and India and
their respective economies is cause for intense reaction on two levels.
On the one hand the amount and extent of human suffering is literally
unbelievable. On the other, the political machinations are so complex
and demonic that only more entanglement seems likely.
It is crucial to realize that the two levels are inextricably bound.
The Western media continues to portray, at great cost and with
artistry, the anguish of the refugees. Yet seldom does the Western
press emphasize the political causes or discuss political alternatives.
And the U.S. government expresses concern over the plight of the
refugees but does not back up this concern on the political level and
act to change the situation.
On the first level, I am overwhelmed by the immense proportions
of this human tragedy. At the refugee camp "Salt Lake," where three
of us worked all afternoon distributing one cup of milk to women and
children until the milk ran out, it was hard to comprehend that there
were ten million human refugees in India.
These people had walked two or three hundred miles in as short a
time as a week or two. They have fled from a ruthless, and at times
sadistic, political persecution, from religious persecution, and most
recently from imminent starvation. Communication with family,
friends or events in East Pakistan is rare.
And there is literally nothing to do all day every day but queue for
rations. Unless there is a political settlement between the government
of West Pakistan and the people of Bangla Desh, the future promises
nothing better than permanent living in a refugee camp.
At the political level, the essential reality is that the people of East
Pakistan, whether they have fled to India or remain in East Pakistan,
are victims of the political maneuvers of the Big Powers—Russia,
China, and the U.S.
Since 1950 the U.S. has pursued a policy of a "balance of powers
in Asia." On the Indian subcontinent this means balancing Pakistan
and India against one another such that neither becomes the stronger.
With India's independence from Britain in 1947, the separate
nation of Pakistan was created as an independent Muslim state. After
much bloodshed and a population shift of more than eleven million
people, two areas of Muslim majority were united as Pakistan. These
two areas of East and West are separated by 1000 miles of northern
India.
India under Nehru adopted a firm policy of non-alignment with the
Big Powers. Until last month's friendship treaty with Russia, India has
consistently avoided economic and military alliances and
entanglements with the U.S., Russia and other Powers.
Pakistan, on the other hand, is a member of SEATO and CENTO,
both alliances forged by John Foster Dulles. On the basis of a policy
of "containment" with regard to Communist China and the policy of
"balance of powers in Asia" the U.S. has poured economic and
military aid into Pakistan. Pakistan's other major ally, apart from
SEATO and CENTO, is the People's Republic of China.
China's interests are an effort to increase her strength in Asia and
to find allies against India in the long Sino-Indian border disputes near
the Himalayas.
80% of this foreign aid to Pakistan is spent in the West, an
agriculturally poor land, but the center of political power. However,
three-fifths of Pakistan's foreign exchange is earned in the fertile East.
But per capita income is 30% lower in the East than in the West and
the price of rice and flour is twice as high in the East as it is in the
West.

Over time, a sense of powerlessness and colonization grew in the
East. The fact that East and West speak different languages and have
distinct cultures added to a growing sense of separatism. The Awami
League represented a movement for more self-determination. It was a
moderate movement—not demanding total independence—and an
overwhelmingly popular one.
In the December elections the Awami League won all but two of
the seats from East Pakistan in the National Assembly, and 80% of the
popular votes cast, enough to democratically depose the military
dictatorship of General Yahya Khan.
The story of the efficiency of Yahya Khan's vindictive response
does not need repetition. Three waves of refugees have fled to India.
The first wave was made up of those fleeing from political massacres
of Awami supporters, students, and intellectuals. The second was
mainly composed of Hindus fleeing from religious tensions promoted
and exploited by the Punjabi army.
The third wave of refugees continues now. Forty thousand refugees
cross the Indian border daily—these people are fleeing from starvation.
Crops that should have been harvested this September were never
planted. Floods have further damaged the rice fields. India cannot
nourish and care for these people—millions of her own people are
malnourished. International aid is pathetically inadequate and it is
estimated that two million children will die of starvation unless aid of
massive proportions is supplied immediately.
The U.S. has until recently allowed shipments of arms and supplies
to Pakistan. The State Department's justification for this was that
maintenance of relations with Pakistan will keep the U.S. in a position
to influence Pakistan toward a more humanitarian course. However,
whatever political influencing the U.S. may have done, the results
have been negligible so far.
The situation demands more stringent economic and military
sanctions to bring action. The situation of the refugees in India will
not change (though it will probably gradually worsen) unless there is a
solution at the political level.
The pressure to achieve this kind of political alteration may lay
within the power of the U.S. However, the U.S. has not yet shaken off
containment policy politics. And yet her recent flirtation with China
prevents her from angering the mutual ally, Pakistan. It is this kind of
diplomacy that allows the people of Bangla Desh to starve.
There will be an open meeting Friday in Rm. 271 Tresidder to
discuss the plight of the people of Bangla Desh.

East. The fact that East and West speak different languages and have
distinct cultures added to a growing sense of separatism. The Awami
League represented a movement for more self-determination. It was a
moderate movement—not demanding total independence—and an
overwhelmingly popular one.
In the December elections the Awami League won all but two of
the seats from East Pakistan in the National Assembly, and 80% of the
popular votes cast, enough to democratically depose the military
dictatorship of General Yahya Khan.
The story of the efficiency of Yahya Khan's vindictive response
does not need repetition. Three waves of refugees have fled to India.
The first wave was made up of those fleeing from political massacres
of Awami supporters, students, and intellectuals. The second was
mainly composed of Hindus fleeing from religious tensions promoted
and exploited by the Punjabi army.
The third wave of refugees continues now. Forty thousand refugees
cross the Indian border daily—these people are fleeing from starvation.
Crops that should have been harvested this September were never
planted. Floods have further damaged the rice fields. India cannot
nourish and care for these people—millions of her own people are
malnourished. International aid is pathetically inadequate and it is
estimated that two million children will die of starvation unless aid of
massive proportions is supplied immediately.
The U.S. has until recently allowed shipments of arms and supplies
to Pakistan. The State Department's justification for this was that
maintenance of relations with Pakistan will keep the U.S. in a position
to influence Pakistan toward a more humanitarian course. However,
whatever political influencing the U.S. may have done, the results
have been negligible so far.
The situation demands more stringent economic and military
sanctions to bring action. The situation of the refugees in India will
not change (though it will probably gradually worsen) unless there is a
solution at the political level.
The pressure to achieve this kind of political alteration may lay
within the power of the U.S. However, the U.S. has not yet shaken off
containment policy politics. And yet her recent flirtation with China
prevents her from angering the mutual ally, Pakistan. It is this kind of
diplomacy that allows the people of Bangla Desh to starve.
There will be an open meeting Friday in Rm. 271 Tresidder to
discuss the plight of the people of Bangla Desh.

The flight of ten million East Pakistanis over India's eastern border
and the effect of this flight on the people of Pakistan and India and
their respective economies is cause for intense reaction on two levels.
On the one hand the amount and extent of human suffering is literally
unbelievable. On the other, the political machinations are so complex
and demonic that only more entanglement seems likely.
It is crucial to realize that the two levels are inextricably bound.
The Western media continues to portray, at great cost and with
artistry, the anguish of the refugees. Yet seldom does the Western
press emphasize the political causes or discuss political alternatives.
And the U.S. government expresses concern over the plight of the
refugees but does not back up this concern on the political level and
act to change the situation.
On the first level, I am overwhelmed by the immense proportions
of this human tragedy. At the refugee camp "Salt Lake," where three
of us worked all afternoon distributing one cup of milk to women and
children until the milk ran out, it was hard to comprehend that there
were ten million human refugees in India.
These people had walked two or three hundred miles in as short a
time as a week or two. They have fled from a ruthless, and at times
sadistic, political persecution, from religious persecution, and most
recently from imminent starvation. Communication with family,
friends or events in East Pakistan is rare.
And there is literally nothing to do all day every day but queue for
rations. Unless there is a political settlement between the government
of West Pakistan and the people of Bangla Desh, the future promises
nothing better than permanent living in a refugee camp.
At the political level, the essential reality is that the people of East
Pakistan, whether they have fled to India or remain in East Pakistan,
are victims of the political maneuvers of the Big Powers—Russia,
China, and the U.S.
Since 1950 the U.S. has pursued a policy of a "balance of powers
in Asia." On the Indian subcontinent this means balancing Pakistan
and India against one another such that neither becomes the stronger.
With India's independence from Britain in 1947, the separate
nation of Pakistan was created as an independent Muslim state. After
much bloodshed and a population shift of more than eleven million
people, two areas of Muslim majority were united as Pakistan. These
two areas of East and West are separated by 1000 miles of northern
India.
India under Nehru adopted a firm policy of non-alignment with the
Big Powers. Until last month's friendship treaty with Russia, India has
consistently avoided economic and military alliances and
entanglements with the U.S., Russia and other Powers.
Pakistan, on the other hand, is a member of SEATO and CENTO,
both alliances forged by John Foster Dulles. On the basis of a policy
of "containment" with regard to Communist China and the policy of
"balance of powers in Asia" the U.S. has poured economic and
military aid into Pakistan. Pakistan's other major ally, apart from
SEATO and CENTO, is the People's Republic of China.
China's interests are an effort to increase her strength in Asia and
to find allies against India in the long Sino-Indian border disputes near
the Himalayas.
80% of this foreign aid to Pakistan is spent in the West, an
agriculturally poor land, but the center of political power. However,
three-fifths of Pakistan's foreign exchange is earned in the fertile East.
But per capita income is 30% lower in the East than in the West and
the price of rice and flour is twice as high in the East as it is in the
West.

Over time, a sense of powerlessness and colonization grew in the
East. The fact that East and West speak different languages and have

friends or events in East Pakistan is rare.
And there is literally nothing to do all day every day but queue for
rations. Unless there is a political settlement between the government
of West Pakistan and the people of Bangla Desh, the future promises
nothing better than permanent living in a refugee camp.
At the political level, the essential reality is that the people of East
Pakistan, whether they have fled to India or remain in East Pakistan,
are victims of the political maneuvers of the Big Powers—Russia,
China, and the U.S.
Since 1950 the U.S. has pursued a policy of a "balance of powers
in Asia." On the Indian subcontinent this means balancing Pakistan
and India against one another such that neither becomes the stronger.
With India's independence from Britain in 1947, the separate
nation of Pakistan was created as an independent Muslim state. After
much bloodshed and a population shift of more than eleven million
people, two areas of Muslim majority were united as Pakistan. These
two areas of East and West are separated by 1000 miles of northern
India.
India under Nehru adopted a firm policy of non-alignment with the
Big Powers. Until last month's friendship treaty with Russia, India has
consistently avoided economic and military alliances and
entanglements with the U.S., Russia and other Powers.
Pakistan, on the other hand, is a member of SEATO and CENTO,
both alliances forged by John Foster Dulles. On the basis of a policy
of "containment" with regard to Communist China and the policy of
"balance of powers in Asia" the U.S. has poured economic and
military aid into Pakistan. Pakistan's other major ally, apart from
SEATO and CENTO, is the People's Republic of China.
China's interests are an effort to increase her strength in Asia and
to find allies against India in the long Sino-Indian border disputes near
the Himalayas.
80% of this foreign aid to Pakistan is spent in the West, an
agriculturally poor land, but the center of political power. However,
three-fifths of Pakistan's foreign exchange is earned in the fertile East.
But per capita income is 30% lower in the East than in the West and
the price of rice and flour is twice as high in the East as it is in the
West.

Over time, a sense of powerlessness and colonization grew in the
East. The fact that East and West speak different languages and have
distinct cultures added to a growing sense of separatism. The Awami
League represented a movement for more self-determination. It was a
moderate movement—not demanding total independence—and an
overwhelmingly popular one.
In the December elections the Awami League won all but two of
the seats from East Pakistan in the National Assembly, and 80% of the
popular votes cast, enough to democratically depose the military
dictatorship of General Yahya Khan.
The story of the efficiency of Yahya Khan's vindictive response
does not need repetition. Three waves of refugees have fled to India.
The first wave was made up of those fleeing from political massacres
of Awami supporters, students, and intellectuals. The second was
mainly composed of Hindus fleeing from religious tensions promoted
and exploited by the Punjabi army.
The third wave of refugees continues now. Forty thousand refugees
cross the Indian border daily—these people are fleeing from starvation.
Crops that should have been harvested this September were never
planted. Floods have further damaged the rice fields. India cannot
nourish and care for these people—millions of her own people are
malnourished. International aid is pathetically inadequate and it is
estimated that two million children will die of starvation unless aid of
massive proportions is supplied immediately.
The U.S. has until recently allowed shipments of arms and supplies
to Pakistan. The State Department's justification for this was that
maintenance of relations with Pakistan will keep the U.S. in a position
to influence Pakistan toward a more humanitarian course. However,
whatever political influencing the U.S. may have done, the results
have been negligible so far.
The situation demands more stringent economic and military
sanctions to bring action. The situation of the refugees in India will
not change (though it will probably gradually worsen) unless there is a
solution at the political level.
The pressure to achieve this kind of political alteration may lay
within the power of the U.S. However, the U.S. has not yet shaken off
containment policy politics. And yet her recent flirtation with China
prevents her from angering the mutual ally, Pakistan. It is this kind of
diplomacy that allows the people of Bangla Desh to starve.
There will be an open meeting Friday in Rm. 271 Tresidder to
discuss the plight of the people of Bangla Desh.

The flight of ten million East Pakistanis over India's eastern border
and the effect of this flight on the people of Pakistan and India and
their respective economies is cause for intense reaction on two levels.
On the one hand the amount and extent of human suffering is literally
unbelievable. On the other, the political machinations are so complex
and demonic that only more entanglement seems likely.
It is crucial to realize that the two levels are inextricably bound.
The Western media continues to portray, at great cost and with
artistry, the anguish of the refugees. Yet seldom does the Western
press emphasize the political causes or discuss political alternatives.
And the U.S. government expresses concern over the plight of the
refugees but does not back up this concern on the political level and
act to change the situation.
On the first level, I am overwhelmed by the immense proportions
of this human tragedy. At the refugee camp "Salt Lake," where three
of us worked all afternoon distributing one cup of milk to women and
children until the milk ran out, it was hard to comprehend that there
were ten million human refugees in India.
These people had walked two or three hundred miles in as short a
time as a week or two. They have fled from a ruthless, and at times
sadistic, political persecution, from religious persecution, and most
recently from imminent starvation. Communication with family,
friends or events in East Pakistan is rare.
And there is literally nothing to do all day every day but queue for
rations. Unless there is a political settlement between the government
of West Pakistan and the people of Bangla Desh, the future promises
