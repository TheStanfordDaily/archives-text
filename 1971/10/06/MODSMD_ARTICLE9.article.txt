# SWOPSI Analyzes Peninsula Transit
## 
### 
"Transportation planning needs a creative
approach to problem-solving with an emphasis
on seeking the 'non-obvious' solution,"
declares a detailed SWOPSI report on
Mid-peninsula traffic problems.
Twenty-two graduate and undergraduate
students spent six months on the $600 study.
The report suggests new express bus services
linking Hast Hay BART (Bay Area Rapid
Transit) stations with Peninsula cities; a
three-county transit district to integrate and
modernize existing transit services, including
Southern Pacific commuter trains and
Greyhound buses; and regional cooperation to
stagger work hours and eliminate rush hour
traffic snarls.
Massive Documentation
The students contacted government
officials, industrial executives, institutional
administrators, transportation managers and
planning experts to amass the 230-page
volume.
Its editor-in-chief, Christopher Lovelock,
Business School student of marketing and
transportation, put the report into final form
this summer. Faculty sponsor for the project
was Prof. Michael L. Ray, Graduate School of
Business marketing specialist.
The report, entitled "Balanced
Transportation Planning for Suburban and

Academic Communities," is described by its
authors as a "Case Study of the Midpeninsula
Region of the San Francisco Bay Area." While
noting that the Peninsula is not necessarily a
"typical" suburban area, Lovelock believes
that much of their analysis and findings will
interest suburban communities both inside and
outside California.
Traffic Generators
The student report states that "institutions
such as retail centers, large employers, schools,
hospitals and colleges play a major role in
generating traffic. No suburban transportation
plan can work without their cooperation.
"At the same time, these institutions have a
social responsibility to provide this
cooperation and to work with transport
planners and transit agencies.
The study makes many recommendations
for easing the University's traffic problems and
costs. It "strongly endorses" the Planning
Office's goal of a car-free campus core by
shunting traffic onto peripheral roads and
eliminating on-street parking.
"Stanford University is well placed to act as
a catalyst in Mid-peninsula transportation
planning," the students assert. "Its own
internal actions and policies can serve as an
example to other large institutions in the area,
while the expertise of many of its departments

and graduate schools can be usefully applied to
local and regional planning problems."
Four-day Week
"It is predicted that widespread adoption of
the four-day week and other measures to
stagger working hours will occur during the
next 5-10 years," they write.
"This will have a dramatic effect on peak
travel demands by spreading them over a much
greater period of time, thus allowing for more
efficient use of transportation resources,
reducing or eliminating the need for many
currently proposed new highway projects, and
greatly enhancing the prospects for successful
transit operations."
The SWOPSI report also condemns early
construction of a new Dumbarton Bridge
across the South Bay and the Willow
Expressway which would connect the bridge
to major north-south traffic arteries on the
Peninsula.
Down With Cars
Instead it urges better use of existing streets
by making some one-way and closing off other
less used streets for pedestrians and parking.
"Re-molding the nature and timing of
people's travel needs will play an increasingly
important role in the future, requiring a close
partnership between engineers and social
scientists," the report concludes.

greatly enhancing the prospects for successful
transit operations."
The SWOPSI report also condemns early
construction of a new Dumbarton Bridge
across the South Bay and the Willow
Expressway which would connect the bridge
to major north-south traffic arteries on the
Peninsula.
Down With Cars
Instead it urges better use of existing streets
by making some one-way and closing off other
less used streets for pedestrians and parking.
"Re-molding the nature and timing of
people's travel needs will play an increasingly
important role in the future, requiring a close
partnership between engineers and social
scientists," the report concludes.
"Transportation planning needs a creative
approach to problem-solving with an emphasis
on seeking the 'non-obvious' solution,"
declares a detailed SWOPSI report on
Mid-peninsula traffic problems.
Twenty-two graduate and undergraduate
students spent six months on the $600 study.
The report suggests new express bus services
linking Hast Hay BART (Bay Area Rapid
Transit) stations with Peninsula cities; a
three-county transit district to integrate and
modernize existing transit services, including
Southern Pacific commuter trains and
Greyhound buses; and regional cooperation to
stagger work hours and eliminate rush hour
traffic snarls.
Massive Documentation
The students contacted government
officials, industrial executives, institutional
administrators, transportation managers and
planning experts to amass the 230-page
volume.
Its editor-in-chief, Christopher Lovelock,
Business School student of marketing and
transportation, put the report into final form
this summer. Faculty sponsor for the project
was Prof. Michael L. Ray, Graduate School of
Business marketing specialist.
The report, entitled "Balanced
Transportation Planning for Suburban and

Academic Communities," is described by its
authors as a "Case Study of the Midpeninsula
Region of the San Francisco Bay Area." While
noting that the Peninsula is not necessarily a
"typical" suburban area, Lovelock believes
that much of their analysis and findings will
interest suburban communities both inside and
outside California.
Traffic Generators
The student report states that "institutions
such as retail centers, large employers, schools,
hospitals and colleges play a major role in
generating traffic. No suburban transportation
plan can work without their cooperation.
"At the same time, these institutions have a
social responsibility to provide this
cooperation and to work with transport
planners and transit agencies.
The study makes many recommendations
for easing the University's traffic problems and
costs. It "strongly endorses" the Planning
Office's goal of a car-free campus core by
shunting traffic onto peripheral roads and
eliminating on-street parking.
"Stanford University is well placed to act as
a catalyst in Mid-peninsula transportation
planning," the students assert. "Its own
internal actions and policies can serve as an
example to other large institutions in the area,
while the expertise of many of its departments

and graduate schools can be usefully applied to
local and regional planning problems."
Four-day Week
"It is predicted that widespread adoption of
the four-day week and other measures to
stagger working hours will occur during the
next 5-10 years," they write.
"This will have a dramatic effect on peak
travel demands by spreading them over a much
greater period of time, thus allowing for more
efficient use of transportation resources,
reducing or eliminating the need for many
currently proposed new highway projects, and
greatly enhancing the prospects for successful
transit operations."
