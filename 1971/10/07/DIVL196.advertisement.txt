• East Palo Alto is trying, so Co-op is trying.
Palo Alto Blacks and Whites are working together to provide complete supermarket facilities in
the East Palo Alto-Menlo Park area. No supermarket exists in the 23,000 member community
East of Bayshore.
• The community wants Co-op and Co-op wants to help.
Counterpart (a group of black & white businessmen) has already purchased an existing store
and is in the process of remodeling. Now it's up to Co-op to raise $100,000 for capital and
merchandise.
• Why Co-op?
Co-op will provide a store tailored to the needs of the community, with quality merchandise at
competitive discount prices.
From free child care for parents shopping in the store, to consumer advisors for answering
questions on unit pricing and honest food values, Co-op will help. The traditional Co-op
principles of democratic ownership and participation will contribute to the economic growth
of East Palo Alto.
• To make our grand opening deadline, we need your help now . . . TODAY! Your investment
r in this socially sound program will reward you with more than simple interest.
