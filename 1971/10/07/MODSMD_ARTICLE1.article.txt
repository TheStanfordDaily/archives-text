# Graduate Study Panel Sees 'Waste Of Resources'
## 
### CHRIS PECK 
A preliminary report of the Study of Graduate
Education at Stanford (SGES) suggests that the
present graduate education program "is a waste of
the University's resources," according to the
director of the SGES, Psychology professor J.
Merrill Carlsmith.
Carlsmith and eleven other faculty and student
members have been working since January on the
Study of Graduate Education, and although their
final report isn't due until April 1, 1972, an
interim report to the Faculty Senate was
presented last week.
The SGES committee sees the most serious
problem facing Stanford's graduate program as
being the fact that it currently takes slightly more
than six years on the average for a grad student to
complete the requirements for a Ph.D.
Because so few students can participate in the

graduate programs concurrently and because so
many students drop out of grad school after two
or three years, Carlsmith calls the present
program "a huge waste of the institution's
resources."
Many Quit Early
"Not many students entering the graduate
program envision a six year wait for their
degrees," he commented " and it is because of
this very fact that so many students fall by the
wayside after two or three years."
"At the same time," the associate professor
added, "by keeping some students in grad school
for six, ten, even fifteen years, we're not utilizing
the facilities very well."
The SGES committee was set up in January
after a survey of recent graduates showed that
many of them were dissatisfied with the graduate

program and after many faculty members had
called for an in-depth study of the graduate
program.
Graduate students themselves are not as
concerned about the length of time it takes to get
a Ph.D. from Stanford as they are with the
shortage of financial aid available to them.
Professor Carlsmith notes that "if the SGES
committee were to rely only on complaints
received form graduate students about the
program we'd be spending all of our time dealing
with how to get more financial aid."
Committees Operating
The director says that while there is one topic
committee that is dealing specifically with the
problem of financial aid to graduates, there are
four other small committees set up to deal with
Alternative Programs in Graduate Education,
Ph.D. and Alternate Degrees, Graduate Student

Teaching, and a Committee on Assessment and
Reporting.
This last committee, chaired by Assistant Dean
of Graduate Studies Thorn Rhue, has done the
most fact-finding concerning the question of
speeding up the timetable for acquiring a Ph.D.
Two other major topics are discussed in the
preliminary SGES report besides the length of
time needed for obtaining a Ph.D. The Committee
on Alternative Programs is working on ways to
grant Ph.D.'s to students who cannot attend
graduate school full-time, and the Committee on
the Ph.D. Dissertation and Alternative Degrees is
exploring the possibility of adding Doctor of Arts
and Master of Philosophy degrees to the graduate
program.
Part-time Programs
Director Carlsmith says that the Committee on
Alternative Programs is challenged with the most

difficult series of questions faced by the study."
While the rest of us worry about shortening
the time to a Ph.D., he says, "they must consider
implementing a part-time program for women and
other groups who wish to enter graduate school
but cannot devote all of their time to it."
As to the possibility of adding Doctor of Arts
and Master of Philosophy degrees to the graduate
program, meaning that students could get
teaching degrees in addition to the classical Ph.D.
for research, Carlsmith says"it is a growing
conviction that these degrees are not appropriate
for our graduate programs at this time."
By December 15, all of the five topic
committees should have their final
recommendations turned in to Carlsmith, who in
turn hopes to have the final Study of Graduate
Education at Stanford report submitted to the
Faculty Senate before April 1 , 1972.
