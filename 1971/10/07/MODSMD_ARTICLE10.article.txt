# Psychiatry, Sex, & McGovern's Amnesty Plan
## 
### 
The Sunday New York Times
Magazine of October 3 had an
excellent portrayal of both the
intellectual thought and the
personality of psychiatrist
Thomas Szasz written by Maggie
Scarf.
Szasz is a professor of
psychiatry at the Upstate Medical
Center of the State University of
New York in Syracuse, and he
believes that "mental illness" is a
myth. Szasz considers "mentally
ill" to be a moral or social tag
rather than a medical description.
In addition, Szasz has campaigned
for years against involuntary
mental hospitalization.
This position has its
philosophical origin, Szasz tells

wholly in favor of the former,
which I'd compare to the religious
worship of one's own choosing.
I'm unalterably opposed to the
latter, which I'd consider similar
to forced conversions or
inquisitional practices.
"You know, at this moment
thousands of American citizens
are being forced to submit to
psychiatric 'therapies' against
their will: to loss of liberty, to
lifelong stimatization, to
extremely toxic drugs like
Thorazine, to the birain-damaging
assaults of electroshock, and until
recently, even to such incredible
barbarities as lobotomy. I submit
that this is nothing less than a
crime against humanity."

measure introduced by Willie
Brown (D-San Francisco) which
would have legalized private
homosexual acts and all other
sexual acts between consenting
adults now prohibited by law.
Assemblyman John
Vasconcellos (D-San Jose) gave a
major speech presenting the
libertarian position. As reported
in the October 6 San Jose
Mercury, Vasconcellos said: "I
feel this bill more than any bill
I've seen this year raises the most
basic and emotional question on
freedom.
"There is no kind of freedom
more central or more important
than the freedom of a human
being to use his or her body as he
chooses."
Vasconcellos took
conservatives to task: "I'm very
curious and ask those of you who
claim to be conservatives: You
speak about individual freedom
and (against) government controls
but in the basic freedom of
sexuality you want government to
set the code. A government that
lives in people's bedrooms cannot
be defended."
He concluded, "These aren't
questions for the state. These are
questions for individual and for
the church. To enforce this
(existing) law is to pervert
government and to make it
laughable. Sexuality is between
oneself and others, between
oneself and God if you will, but
not between oneself and
government."

Senator George McGovern,
candidate for the Democratic
nomination for the Presidency,
has been touring college campuses
and giving a speech in which he
calls for amnesty for draft
resisters and those who have gone
into exile to avoid the draft. For
his stand he has been receiving
loud applause.
At the same time, McGovern is
saying that the tradition of
Lincoln's Civil War
Reconstruction plans, those
Americans who are accused or
have been convicted of war
crimes, crimes against peace, or
crimes against humanity in the
Indochina war should also receive
amnesty.

Fugitives from the draft have
committed no crime of aggression
and should not be prosecuted for
refusing to be conscripted into the
military. But justice in the case of
the draft means more than
amnesty.
The four-point platform of the
lowa City Liberator is: Abolition
of the draft (which McGovern is
in favor of), Emancipation
(immediate release of draftees,
reluctant volunteers,
conscientious objectors, and draft
prisoners), Amnesty, and
Retribution.
The Liberator explains the
Retribution plank of its platforms
as follows: "We demand minimum
repayments of $2,000 per
service-year for all draftees and
conscientious objectors, $4,000
per prison-year for all draft
prisoners, and $200 ,000 to the
dependents of each draftee killed
in service.
"We support individual claims
(such as those by doctors and
dentists) for damages in excess of
the preceding claims, which were
based on the median civilian and
military incomes for draft-age
males.
"These repayments are to be
made by all those who freely
advoc?ted, upheld, and

implemented the Selective Service
System."
The government has no moral
right to forgive the debts
individually owed by those who
upheld the conscription apparatus
to its victims. Amnesty or pardons
can rightfully only be given by the
victims, and this is true of all
crimes, including war crimes,
crimes against peace, and crimes
against humanity.
Although he was not writing
about the draft, Jenkin Lloyd
Jones's recent article in the Tulsa
Tribune on crime compensation is
pertinent here: "Crime
compensation at taxpayer expense
is getting popular . .. The idea has
logic. But it can be improved by
going back to the first principle of
ancient lawâ€”that it is
the perpetrator of the crime who
has the primary obligation to the
victim. Prison psychologist Dr.
John Kiehlbach . . . suggests that
the length of sentence be
determined by the time it takes
the convicted to earn full
restitution to the wronged.
"Robbers who have scored big
often smugly sit out their prison
years until they can emerge to
pick up their caches. If full
restitution is insisted on, their
profit vanishes. Job training in
prison would also make more

sense, Kiehlbauch believes, if
inmates were forced to earn
money from marketable trades in
behalf of those they had wronged.
"Instead of loading on the
blameless taxpayer the indemnity
for the victims of crime, why not
charge the criminal himself?
'Paying one's debt to society'
would then take on real
meaning."
McGovern invokes the spirit of
Lincoln's Reconstruction plans.

But one must remember that it
was in Lincoln's reconciliatory
spirit that freed slaves were denied
the "forty acres and a mule" that
Radical Republicans insisted were
owed by the slave-holding
plantation owners to the
emancipated slaves for their years
of servitude. One might add that
McGovern has lately qualified his
call for "amnesty" by saying that
draft resisters and fugitives should
serve time in some sort of
compulsory civilian service.
