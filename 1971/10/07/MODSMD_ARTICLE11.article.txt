Scarf, in the fact that Szasz
believes, "as did John Stuart Mill,
that a man's body and soul are his
own, not the state's. And
furthermore, that each individual
has the 'right,' if you will, to do
with his body as he pleases—so
long as he doesn't harm someone
else, or infringe on someone else's
right."
Last May, Szasz delivered a
paper before the annual meeting
of the American Psychiatric
Association in which he argued
that heroin should be available to
adults in the same mildly
regulated manner that alcohol is
now, and that marijuana ought to
be sold over the counter the way
aspirin and cigarettes are.
Szasz thinks, "We should
worry less about people abusing
their bodies by ingesting harmful
drugs (the toxic effects will be
punishment enough) and more
about people abusing other people
through reckless driving, theft,
assault, somatization and all of
the countless other ways human
beings have devised for injuring
one another."
"Stigmatization" includes, for
Szasz, the labeling of people as
"mentally ill," a practice which he
considers parallel to accusations
of witchery by the medieval
inquisition.
The deprivation of freedom
which often accompanies the
designation of someone as
"mentally ill" has been a major
topic of Szasz's writings. He says:
"One of my main concerns is
trying to make clear the
important distinction between
voluntary and involuntary
psychiatric interventions. I'm

Szasz's position emphasizes the
individual's responsibility for his
acts. He is strongly opposed to the
coalition of lawyers and
psychiatrists, like Judge David
Bazelon and Dr. Karl Manninger,
who want to substitute a
psychiatrist's judgment as to a
person's mental health for a
finding of the legal system's
adversary process about
culpability for overt, aggressive
acts and substitute involuntary
commitment to mental
institutions for court-imposed
punishments befitting the crimes.
Szasz opposes insanity
defenses: "Take the Calley trial
for instance. Why raise the
insanity issue in a case like that?
Many people seemed to assume
that he must have a 'mental
disease' to have perpetrated such a
massacre; but such things have
been going on for centuries;
they're as old as history. Calley
performed a perfectly simple act:
murder. It was bad, not mentally
ill."

designation of someone as
"mentally ill" has been a major
topic of Szasz's writings. He says:
"One of my main concerns is
trying to make clear the
important distinction between
voluntary and involuntary
psychiatric interventions. I'm

Szasz's position emphasizes the
individual's responsibility for his
acts. He is strongly opposed to the
coalition of lawyers and
psychiatrists, like Judge David
Bazelon and Dr. Karl Manninger,
who want to substitute a
psychiatrist's judgment as to a
person's mental health for a
finding of the legal system's
adversary process about
culpability for overt, aggressive
acts and substitute involuntary
commitment to mental
institutions for court-imposed
punishments befitting the crimes.
Szasz opposes insanity
defenses: "Take the Calley trial
for instance. Why raise the
insanity issue in a case like that?
Many people seemed to assume
that he must have a 'mental
disease' to have perpetrated such a
massacre; but such things have
been going on for centuries;
they're as old as history. Calley
performed a perfectly simple act:
murder. It was bad, not mentally
ill."

On October 5, the California
state Assembly defeated, 38-29, a
Scarf, in the fact that Szasz
believes, "as did John Stuart Mill,
that a man's body and soul are his
own, not the state's. And
furthermore, that each individual
has the 'right,' if you will, to do
with his body as he pleases—so
long as he doesn't harm someone
else, or infringe on someone else's
right."
Last May, Szasz delivered a
paper before the annual meeting
of the American Psychiatric
Association in which he argued
that heroin should be available to
adults in the same mildly
regulated manner that alcohol is
now, and that marijuana ought to
be sold over the counter the way
aspirin and cigarettes are.
Szasz thinks, "We should
worry less about people abusing
their bodies by ingesting harmful
drugs (the toxic effects will be
punishment enough) and more
about people abusing other people
through reckless driving, theft,
assault, somatization and all of
the countless other ways human
beings have devised for injuring
one another."
"Stigmatization" includes, for
Szasz, the labeling of people as
"mentally ill," a practice which he
considers parallel to accusations
of witchery by the medieval
inquisition.
The deprivation of freedom
which often accompanies the
designation of someone as
"mentally ill" has been a major
topic of Szasz's writings. He says:
