# Stanford On Ice
## Students Roam Antarctica 
### CARL SUNSHINE 
Antarctica may mean a frozen no-man's
land to most people but for an enthusiastic
group of Stanford radio scientists it evokes far
more positive vibrations.
Head of the research group, Robert
Helliwell, Professor of Electrical Engineering,
has been visiting Antarctica since 195 7 to
study electromagnetic phenomena in the
Earth's upper atmosphere and surrounding
space.
Each year Helliwell and several graduate
students selected for the program have been
recording the long radio waves naturally
emitted by lightning. These waves travel
through space aJong the earth's magnetic field
lines and return to earth where their analysis
yields information on the electrical properties
of the space they have passed through.
Electron Density Varies
Studying these "whistlers" (the waves

sound like a toy slide whistle when played
through a speaker), Helliwell's group has
determined the electron density around earth
and how it varies due to the constantly
changing stream of particles emitted from the
sun.
The Antarctic location was chosen for the
research because it has little local lightning
activity which would make noisy recordings,
and because it is "opposite" a spot on Earth
with a lot of lightning where the radio waves
originate.
The 10,000 feet of ice beneath the station
also provide a much better base than seawater
or rock for a huge antenna now being built.
The 13 mile long antenna will broadcast
carefully tailored radio waves into space so the
experiments will have much more flexibility
than when they relied on natural lightning.
Although scientific activities are foremost
for the researchers, the Antarctic environment
is so different that lifestyles and interpersonal
behavior prove a unique experience. On a
continent larger than the U.S., several
thousand scientists, curious VlP's. and military
support personnel gather during the "warm"
summer months when air travel is possible.
Activities Governed By Treaty
All activities of the dozen or so bases
(staffed from many countries of the world) are
governed by the Antarctic Treaty. A model of
international sanity, it bans any commercial or
military exploitation and requires strict
conservation of the environment.
According to Helliwell. "everybody
cooperates" and there are "hardly any
protocol problems" as Americans may visit a
primarily Russian base to "exchange data and
break out the vodka."
The Antarctic winter is quite another story.
For three to five months, locked in continuous
darkness, 80 degree below zero temperatures
and 70 mile per hour winds, from four to
twenty men carry on the research in shelters
buried in the ice and snow. They know they
are completely on their own. Their only
possible connection with the rest of the world
is radio.
Why does a man choose such an

experience? Chung Park, research associate in
radioscience, spent 1966 at a Stanford station
in Antarctica. "I wanted time to do some
thinking and reading—getting away from it all
in a very different way," he said. After the
experience, Park saw it as "a chance to really
look at the world from the outside."
Tough Journey
Every day Park climbed from the living
shelter onto the surface to cross 3000 feet to
the scientific shelter. In the driving wind and
snow, often unable to see as far as his own feet
or even to stand erect, he grasped a sturdy
guide line and followed it half crawling to the
scientific shelter.
Occasionally the storms abated and the
aurora provided a free light show amidst the
crystal-cold starry sky. "You feel very close to
nature," said Park. "Your everyday life is more
a man-to-nature confrontation." Memories of
daily hassles back home and the occasional
news reports soon "look very silly."
Park went armed with hundreds of books
and what Katsufrakis calls "a 200 percent
workload" to keep him busy. Not all men
survive the experience so well. Occasionally
men spend a few summer months and are
evacuated when they find they can't take it.
Everyone realizes they are stuck together for
the winter, so they try extra hard to get along.
Very infrequently fights do occur. One man
walked out of the station after such an
incident during the winter and was never seen
again.
Whatever direction each individual goes
afterward, Katsufrakis and Park agree that the
Antarctic experience is a powerful one. Some
students have continued in radioscience while
others have taken up such distant careers as
running a resort in the Carribean. Overseeing
the selection and return of several Stanford
grad students each year, Katsufrakis claims
they have "all been successes."
As for women in the Antarctic, there were
essentially none five years ago. Recently a few
husband and wife teams and even single
woman scientists have been allowed into some
areas, although there have been none yet in the
small Stanford group.
