# Class Cards Due
## 
### 
The Registrar's Office advises that
studv-list cards and class cards are due
before 5 p.m. Friday at the Information
Window of the Registrar's Office in the
lobby of the Old Union. A class card is
required for each class listed on a
student's study-list card, and class cards
which have not been available from
instructors may be obtained in the Old
Union lobby Thursday afternoon and all
day Friday.
After turning in his study-list card and
class cards, a student may still change his
program by petitioning.
A charge of $2 for late turn in of class
cards is imposed, and after one week this
is increased to $10. Following that, a
student's registration is subject to
cancellation if he has turned in his
study-list card and class cards.
