# 'Jesus Christ Superstar'
## A 						Work Of Great Importance 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
One of the real values of any
art is the after effect of whatever
is experienced; what a person
takes home and remembers and
thinks about. I'm not trying to
belittle things which are solely
entertaining and oftimes a
beginning and an end in
themselves. People need such
relaxing and enjoyable things very
much. But real art has a more
long-term value.
Naturally one of the rarest and
most beautiful of all experiences
is something which combines
both; something which is both
entertainment and art. The rarity
of such an occurrence makes
something like "Jesus Christ
Superstar" even more beautiful.
The concert version of this
rock-operatic masterpiece by two
young Englishmen, composer
Andrew Lloyd Webber, 23 and
lyricist Tim Rice, 27, was
presented at the Oakland
Coliseum last Saturday and
Sunday nights. I have not seen
many productions more moving
than this one. Webber and Rice
are responsible for one of the
artistic milestones of our time.
Because of its subject matter,
"Superstar" was bound to be
controversial. But Webber and
Rice have purposely avoided any
statement in the play as to
Christ's divinity. Thus they have
avoided making judgment of the
work a political affair, in which
too many people would judge it
mainly on its relationship to their
own religious beliefs or
non-beliefs.
Important Questions
Instead they have formed a
work which, in recounting
thedrama of Christ's passion,
presents many very important
questions about Christ and
religion which everyone can
ponder for long hours. In the
words of the opera's climactic
song, 'Superstar,' Judas gives the

best phrasings of some of these
questions.
"Every time I look at you I
don't understand
Why you let the things you did
get so out of hand
You'd have managed better if
you'd had it planned
Why'd you choose such a
backward time and such a
strange land?
If you 'd come today you
would have reached a whole
nation
Israel in 4 BC had no mass
communication."
Whether Christ was myth or
reality, no one can deny the effect
Christian religion has had on the
world. But Webber and Rice make
you consider that religion in an
important way.
As Judas says, "If you strip
away the myth from the man." Or
as Webber and Rice put it,
"Basically, the idea of the whole
opera is to have Christ seen
through the eyes of Judas, with
Christ as a man, not as a god."
A person can't leave
"Superstar" without thinking for
a long time about the play's
namesake. Many of the vestiges of
Christianity which are usually
taken for granted, become subject
to much thought. And the whole
question of how you personally
feel about Christ can be
thoughtfully re-examined.

But a person also comes away
from "Superstar" thoroughly
entertained. The music is very
widely-varied and almost always
fairly well-written. And the lyrics,
while not always as heavy as those
quoted earlier, are rarely
deficient. The opera moves from
song to song with easy continuity.
It is an incredible work, especially
for two people to have composed
mainly in about six months, from
October 1969 to March 1970.
To work as effectively as it
should, "Superstar" requires quite
a cast. And this "authorized"
touring version has such a cast,
unlike the very amateurish
production of "Music from Jesus
Christ Superstar," which was
staged on September 25 in San
Francisco's Cow Palace.
The Oakland production
included a rock band, a large
orchestra and about 20 singers.
This was not the full operatic
production which officially opens
in New York in about a week, but
the singers did act out to a large v
extent what they sang. The
performers were dressed in
contemporary fashions, which
may actually be the most effective
way to present "Superstar."
From Christ and Judas down,
the cast was excellent. Tom
Westerman was a very effective
Jesus. He has an excellent voice
and he showed considerable facial
emotion, especially when he
knows he has been betrayed and

in the sequence where he receives
39 lashes. At times his movements
were a bit awkward, but
considering who he had to
portray, he did an outstanding
job.
Simply Incredible
Carl Anderson as Judas was
simply incredible. His singing was
powerful, melodic and completely
crisp and intelligible. And his
actions were equally impressive.
The scenes where he decides to
betray Christ and where he dies
were memorable dramatic
performances.
The cast didn't fall off after
the two headliners. Linda Nichols
as Mary Magdalene demonstrated
a beautiful, comforting voice,
which was reinforced well by her
smooth, flowing movements.
Stephen D. Newman as Caiaphas
has a fantastically deep and good
bass voice. And one of the most

incredible things I've ever seen on
the stage was Alan Martin's
slapstick, vaudeville rendition of
the rollicking "King Herod's
Song."
The music of both the large
orchestra and the rock band was
good and it was well balanced by
sound engineers who mastered
very well the difficulties of high
quality sound in a giant coliseum.
Even the lighting, especially a
beautiful sprinkle effect at the
show's climax.
Most importantly, "Jesus
Christ Superstar" worked. It left
you satisfied and entertained, but
thinking and thinking about many
important things. "Superstar" will
definitely i'elp the validity of rock
as a medium of art. As Webber
and Rice said, "Rock has, at least,
been recognized and accepted as a
valid cultural medium of
expression." Amen.
