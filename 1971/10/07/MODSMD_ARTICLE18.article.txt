# Dissent Issues To Be Debated
## 
### 
Three days of campus discussion of
the Bruce Franklin case and the larger
political issues surrounding it will come
to a head tonight with a debate
centering on the Nuremburg principles
and their relation to dissent on campus.
Outspoken anti-war activists
Hallsted Holman of the Medical School
and Pierre Noyes of SLAC will debate
in favor of the proposition "Resolved,
that the Nuremburg principles and
university involvement with the
military are relevant to a definition of
the limits of dissent on campus."
Opposing them will be Associate
Provost Robert Rosenzweig and John
Barton of the Law School. The debate
will be held in Cubberly Auditorium at
8 :00 p.m. and broadcast live on KZSU.
The debate was conceived by the
ASSU Council of Presidents as part of
an information campaign on the
Franklin case. Dorm discussions have
been held for the last two nights to
familiarize students with the issues
involved.
Tonight's debate, however, will be
formal in structure. Each side will

present a seven minute opening
statement followed by rebuttal and
cross examination. Moderator Larry
Diamond of the ASSU Council of
Presidents hopes to open up the debate
for floor questions after one-half hour.
Both Barton and Rosenzwieg are
participating at the invitation of
Diamond and do not claim to represent
any official administration position.
Rosenzweig told the Daily he had
nothing to say on the case itself, but
that, "The issues raised by the Franklin
case and those similar to it are
importatn in and of themselves and
tehy bear discussion in relation to
events both at Stanford and in a wider
context."
In the pre-debate dorm discussions,
pro-administration speakers have
tended to concentrate on issues of
academic freedom and free speech.
Pro-Franklin speakers paralleled Bruce
Franklin's defense by examining
questions of imperialism, the war, and
alleged Stanford complicity in war
crimes.
