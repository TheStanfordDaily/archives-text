Ford To Be Fined
WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency
requested legal action Wednesday against Ford Motor Co.,
accusing the company of violating the Clean Air Act by
shipping new cars to dealers before the cars received
anti-pollution clearance.
Ford conceded it shipped 207,500 uncertified vehicles,
with precautions to prevent their sale until they were
cleared, but said the practice had EPA approval.
In theory, Ford could be fined up to $10,000 for each
vehicle found in violation of the law—a total of more than
$2 billion—but Environmental Protection Administrator
William D. Ruckelshaus said he was not seeking heavy fines
against the company.
Thieu Election Challenged
SAIGON — Opponents of President Nguyen Van Thieu
asked the Supreme Court Wednesday to overturn results of
Sunday's election that election officials claimed gave the
unopposed president an overwhelming vote.
The petition to the court came only hours after Vice
President Nguyen Cao Ky assailed the election as "brazenly
rigged" by Thieu.
The petition was filed by Trinh Quoc Khanh, chairman
of the Committee Against Dictatorship, labor leader

Nguyen Ngoc Loi, and two Saigon city councilmen, Duong
Van Long and Ha TTie Ruyet.
It challenged the legality of the election's organization
by the Interior Ministry, the voters' lack of choice, and the
way in which votes were tabulated and the final results
determined.
Ky issued a statement that said: "The results of the Oct.
3 election, withfigures indicating percentages nearing 100
per cent, revealed a brazen rigging beyond imagination."
Election officials said final official vote totals gave Thieu
94 .3 per cent of the ballots cast, with 5.5 per cent against
him. The remaining .2 per cent was unaccounted for.
Nixon To Explain Phase 2
WASHINGTON — President Nixon will outline the details
of his Phase 2 economic program in a live radio-television
broadcast at 7 :30 p.m. EDT Thursday.
Announcing this Wednesday, the White House said the
President will go on the air from his office and will finish
his talk within half an hour.
Nixon thus will beat by more than a week the
mid-October deadline he set some time ago for laying out
the program that will replace the current 90-day
wage-price-rent freeze.
