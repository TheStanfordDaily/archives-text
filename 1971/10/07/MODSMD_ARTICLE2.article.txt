# 'Red Buttons' Fight With FCMers Described In Franklin Hearing
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
A business student associated with
the conservative Free Campus
Movement (FCM) told the Franklin
hearing yesterday that he witnessed a
"swirling fight" February 10 between
FCM members and a club-wielding
group "wearing red buttons."
Peter Brimelow testified that the
nighttime battle came minutes after
English Professor Bruce Franklin gave a
speech which built "to a sustained
rant."
Another student and an
administrator also described the fight
and Franklin's speech. But under
cross-examination they could not
confirm some details of Brimelow's
graphic account.
A faculty Advisory Board is hearing
an administration request for Franklin's
dismissal based on charges which
include inciting violence during the
February 10 rally at the Old Union.
Speaking in a heavy Northern
English accent, Brimelow said he was
called by the FCM and asked to
accompany a photographer to the rally.
FCM and radicals have clashed
frequently in the past over the
conservatives' attempts to watch and
photograph rallies and "trashing."
Brimelow has worked with FCM several
times since.
Brimelow testified he saw 30
persons at the rally who wore red
buttons and carried poles with red flags
wrapped around them.
"They would slash with them at the
air periodically," he commented.
He said the "red buttons" grouped
near 15 to 20 FCMers wearing "blue
buttons" several times during the rally.
Brimelow said the rally had been
dragging along but during Franklin's
speech "the crowd got quite excited
and punctuated his speech with great
applause, salutes and slogans."

Brimelow added that Franklin urged
a "people's war," which he understood
as "like the Vietnamese War; a civil
war, a savage war." Franklin has
claimed he was only advocating a
"united front" among all anti-war
groups.
The graduate business student said
the "red buttons" chanted, "Street
Fighter" as the rally dispersed and soon
after "a big fight broke out" near the
fountain in White Plaza.
Brimelow claimed that when he
came over to the brawl Aaron
Manganiello—who, like Franklin,
belongs to the revolutionary group
Venceremos—hit him "over the head
with something very hard." He said he
required four stitches.
Under cross-examination, Franklin
showed a police report in which
Brimelow said, "I started fighting with
a guy." But Brhnelow insisted
yesterday that Manganiello threw the
first punch.
In the center of the brawl, Brimelow
said, FCM cameraman Claude Long was
lying still while the "red buttons" were
"standing around him sticking sticks
into him.. .spitting at him, and kicking
at him." He said the attackers were
trying to get the film out of his camera.
Associate General Secretary Richard
Bennett told the faculty judges that
before Franklin spoke he saw the
activist "talking with a group of
students I had previously observed
wearing red Venceremos buttons." He
later conceded that he was not certain
that all o f the red buttons he saw that
night were those of the revolutionary
group.
After the rally, Bennett said he saw
the FCMers and "red buttons" standing
on opposite sides of a lawn near the
fountain. He said the "reds" took
two steps away and "then turned as a
group and ran right toward the people

wearing the blue buttons. . .without
any provocation I could see."
Fights Break Out
He said half a dozen fist fights then
broke out. And he testified that he saw
no camera flashes until after the attack
began.
But Franklin's questioning revealed
that Bennett did not recall seeing
several crucial parts of Brimelow's
account. He remembered no clubs
among the "red buttons" nor any
shouts of "street fighter." He also
conceded he would not have heard any
racial epithets fsorn the FCMers or seen
them throw rocks if either had
occurred before the fist fight.
Franklin challenged Bennett's
credibility because of his job as a
fund-raiser for the University. Bennett
conceded some alumni have threatened
to stop contributing funds unless
Franklin is dismissed.
But he said, "When we look into
letters like that it ends up they're from
non-donors anyway."
James Almas, a senior, said that
during the fight he saw someone
clubbed "with a flag, very distinctly a
flag that was rolled up." But he said he
saw no group carrying sticks earlier as
he looked down at the rally from the
second floor of the Clubhouse in the
Old Union.
Almas Surprised
Almas said Franklin, whom he called
"a charismatic speaker," surprised him
by referring to a "people's war" against
police and urging different levels of
action.
Almas testified he was surprised
because the Maoist was usually "more
careful." Almas said, "Usually, Prof.
Frankli". has never said anything that
would in any way be construed as being
illegal."
But under cross-examination, Almas
conceded Franklin may have referred
to using the "methods of people's war"
rather than to "waging" such a battle.
And Almas said that he had no idea
of the context of Franklin's comments
because he had listened to none of the
other speakers at the rally.
Almas said that sometime after the
rally a group of demonstrators marched
to Wilbut. On their way back a bicycle
rack was placed in a road and several
rocks were thrown toward the
Undergraduate Library, according to
the witness.
Attorney Raymond Fisher predicted
he will finish presenting the
administration case by the beginning of
Friday's session. He said tomorrow's
session,which begins at 1:00 p.m. in
Physics 101, will probably include
testimony by Santa Clara County
Undersheriff Tom Rosa.
