# New Center Plans Dinner
## 
### 
The newly-founded Stanford
Women's Center will hold a giant
pot-luck dinner tonight open to
everyoneâ€”men included. The dinner
will take place at the I-Center backyard
at 5:30 p.m. Everyone who can should
bring food.
The dinner will feature speeches by
members of various women's groups at
Stanford so that women can find out
what is going on in the area.
Registration for the courses which the
Center is offering will also take place.
Right now the chief activity of the
Women's Center is to function as a
co-ordinating body. Women who want
to work on any particular issue can find
other women to work with them
through the Center. Some of the issues
which women are working on include
abortion, job discrimination, child care,
women's admissions, and visiting
women prisoners.
All women, including
undergraduates, graduates, student and
faculty wives, faculty and staff
members, and members of the
community, are welcome at the Center
and at the potluck
