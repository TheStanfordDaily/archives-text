# Kimball, Diamond Hit Campus Police Report
## 
### 
Two members of the ASSU Council
of Presidents, Larry Diamond and
Ann Kimball, expresses dissatisfaction
yesterday with the report of the
Presidential Commission on the Status
of Stanford Police.
Diamond, a member of the
Commission, concurred in its
recommendations, but voiced
reservations about the composition and
choice of the advisory panel to the
University president.
He also expressed doubts aoout the
operational control of the force,
although he has no other viable,
pragmatic alternative to the proposed
plan.
Kimball felt a significant omission in
the report was the failure to thoroughly
investigate the possilbe addition of the
Industrial Park as a supplement to the
University's meager tax base.
She also stated reservations about
the proposed direct University control
of Sheriff's deputies. "I would consider
remaining with the present
arrangement, where [Santa Clara
County Sheriff James Geary is directly
responsible for his deputies' campus
activities rather than allowing the
administration to control its private
police force."
Chaired by Leon Seltzer, director of
the University Press, the
faculty-student-staff commission
unanimously advocated deputizing
Stanford police officers as reserve
members of the Sheriff's Department,
while retaining operational and

financial control fo their activities in
the University administration.
The Commission recommended
"community control" of the newly
credentialed group of peace officers
through a body which would advise the
president and the chief of police, but
could not hold formal hearings or issue
orders. This unnamed body would
evaluate charges and recommendations,
both in general policy and in individual
cases, including disciplinary action.
