### TINA COOPER 
The Summer Senate, in a special
meeting yesterday, appointed Alice
Furumoto Elections Commissioner for
the school year. Her first duty will be
organizing and supervising the Student
Senate elections October 21-22.
Miss Furumoto, a member of
Venceremos and the Asian-American
Student Alliance, said she wanted an
Elections Board that represented all
minority groups. "Lately," she
commented, "they've been
predominantly black. I'd like some
Asian-Americans also. My working staff
will reflect this."
When asked how she heard of the
job,she replied it was all very informal.
"I just talked with one of the Senators
who was in AASA, and then with Doug
McHenry, and decided to apply," she
said. The Senate had no other
applicants."

Miss Furumoto plans to be stringent
concerning elections requirements. She
stressed campaign funding, saying, "In
previous campaigns, little attention has
been paid to how much money some
candidates have spent. I want to make
it known that I intend to invoke certain
laws." Candidates for the Senate are
allowed to spend fifty dollars only on
their campaigns.
Only registered students may vote in
the Student Senate elections and
they may only vote for candidates in
their constituency. Different
constituencies include the graduate
schools, majors in engineering and in
humanities and sciences, and
undeclared majors in general studies.
Candidates may pick up petitions
from the secretary in the ASSU offices.
They well be available from tomorrow,
and must be returned with the required
fifteen signatures before Wednesday.
