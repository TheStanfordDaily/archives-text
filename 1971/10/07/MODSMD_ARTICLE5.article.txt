# Student-Staff Petition Criticizes Proposed New Cancer Center
## 
### SCOTT THACHER 
A new center for clinical and basic
research on the treatment of cancer
may possibly be developed at the
Stanford Medical Center over the next
few years.
Disagreement with the aims of the
project has already been voiced in the
form of a petition, signed by 22
students and staff. It contends that a
very large cancer research project might
hurt other equally important programs
at the Medical Center.
The proposed cancer center, which
the petitioners claim might cost $20 to
$30 million is only in a tentative stage.
A team of experts from the National
Institute of Health came yesterday to
decide whether Stanford Hospital
should receive an initial $200,000
planning grant to study the desirability
and the exact form of the cancer
program
The idea of such a center was first
considered in 1968, according to Henry

Kaplan, professor of radiology, who
heads a committee studying the
project. Interest lagged however and
the committee was not formed until
President Nixon pledged to start a $100
million per year program to cure
cancer. The student-staff petition
expresses fear that in attempting to
attract large amounts of this money,
the Medical Center will concentrate too
heavily on cancer research to the
detriment of other areas of patient
care.
The petition reads, "Wequestion the
priorities for limited health dollars:
money goes for heart transplants, linear
accelerators, and cancer research, but
not for dental care, nutrition, maternal
and child care, health education, and
prevention of auto accidents."
The petition suggests that if the
money is received it should be used for
research on causes of cancer such as
smoking, pollution and food additives.
The 22 petitioners also suggest a
more decentralized means for treating

cancer patients through home-care
programs, greater distribution of
resources throughout the nearby
region for cancer treatment and
building a hospital-hotel for patients
who do not require the full treatmentof
a hospital.
Kaplan, who is considered the prime
mover behind the project, first
explained that there is no commitment
whatever to go ahead with the cancer
center.
Effort will be made to involve
students and other parts of the
institution with the planning, he said.
No one wants the proposed cancer
center to be monolithis or sepa-ate
from the Medical Center, Kaplan
added. At present, a considerable
amount of cancer research is taking
place there.
Medical School Dean Clayton Rich
also felt that the petition is unbalanced
in presenting an "either-or" description
of how the Medical Center might ignore
other programs if the cancer center is
created.
He added that a cancer program
there could be quite small. "We might
add modestly to our present
departments," Rich said.
Halstead Holman, a member of the
committee studying the cancer project
and Chairman of the Department cf
Medecine, admitted that there is a
danger of Stanford succumbing to the
blandishments of a mission-oriented
program that does not encompass a
broad set of objectives.
He stated there should be "a balance
between the needs of the community,
the needs of the Medical Schoo' ?rd
the needs of cancer research" in
receiving extensive funds.
"Cancer research here should be
integrated with that in the cenfcnl
California region," he said, by h- vinj
Stanford's work actively traded with
other physicians in the area.
Most of those who criticized th<-
petition itself, such as Kaplan and Ri< Ii
agreed with the petitioners' ideas c
how the program should develop.
Tom Raffin, a co-president of the
Stanford Medical Students Association,
who agreed with the petition but was
not one of the original signers, felt that
it also represented a list of students'
general misgivings towards the
orientation of the Medical Center.
Stephen Bezruchka, a student signer
of the petition termed Kaplan teh
"chief architect" of the grant proposal
and added, "It's hard to conceive of the
grant not being used for a personal
empire of his. He really has the prestige
for obtaining a grant"
According to Robert Lindee,
associate dean for administration,there
are "no preconceived ideas about the
center." He added,"l can't understand
why they (the petitioners)are upset."

The 22 petitioners also suggest a
more decentralized means for treating

cancer patients through home-care
programs, greater distribution of
resources throughout the nearby
region for cancer treatment and
building a hospital-hotel for patients
who do not require the full treatmentof
a hospital.
Kaplan, who is considered the prime
mover behind the project, first
explained that there is no commitment
whatever to go ahead with the cancer
center.
Effort will be made to involve
students and other parts of the
institution with the planning, he said.
No one wants the proposed cancer
center to be monolithis or sepa-ate
from the Medical Center, Kaplan
added. At present, a considerable
amount of cancer research is taking
place there.
Medical School Dean Clayton Rich
also felt that the petition is unbalanced
in presenting an "either-or" description
of how the Medical Center might ignore
other programs if the cancer center is
created.
He added that a cancer program
there could be quite small. "We might
add modestly to our present
departments," Rich said.
Halstead Holman, a member of the
committee studying the cancer project
and Chairman of the Department cf
Medecine, admitted that there is a
danger of Stanford succumbing to the
blandishments of a mission-oriented
program that does not encompass a
broad set of objectives.
He stated there should be "a balance
between the needs of the community,
the needs of the Medical Schoo' ?rd
the needs of cancer research" in
receiving extensive funds.
"Cancer research here should be
integrated with that in the cenfcnl
California region," he said, by h- vinj
Stanford's work actively traded with
other physicians in the area.
Most of those who criticized th<-
petition itself, such as Kaplan and Ri< Ii
agreed with the petitioners' ideas c
how the program should develop.
Tom Raffin, a co-president of the
Stanford Medical Students Association,
who agreed with the petition but was
not one of the original signers, felt that
it also represented a list of students'
general misgivings towards the
orientation of the Medical Center.
Stephen Bezruchka, a student signer
of the petition termed Kaplan teh
"chief architect" of the grant proposal
and added, "It's hard to conceive of the
grant not being used for a personal
empire of his. He really has the prestige
for obtaining a grant"
According to Robert Lindee,
associate dean for administration,there
are "no preconceived ideas about the
center." He added,"l can't understand
why they (the petitioners)are upset."

A new center for clinical and basic
research on the treatment of cancer
may possibly be developed at the
Stanford Medical Center over the next
few years.
Disagreement with the aims of the
project has already been voiced in the
form of a petition, signed by 22
students and staff. It contends that a
very large cancer research project might
hurt other equally important programs
at the Medical Center.
The proposed cancer center, which
the petitioners claim might cost $20 to
$30 million is only in a tentative stage.
A team of experts from the National
Institute of Health came yesterday to
decide whether Stanford Hospital
should receive an initial $200,000
planning grant to study the desirability
and the exact form of the cancer
program
The idea of such a center was first
considered in 1968, according to Henry

Kaplan, professor of radiology, who
heads a committee studying the
project. Interest lagged however and
the committee was not formed until
President Nixon pledged to start a $100
million per year program to cure
cancer. The student-staff petition
expresses fear that in attempting to
attract large amounts of this money,
the Medical Center will concentrate too
heavily on cancer research to the
detriment of other areas of patient
care.
The petition reads, "Wequestion the
priorities for limited health dollars:
money goes for heart transplants, linear
accelerators, and cancer research, but
not for dental care, nutrition, maternal
and child care, health education, and
prevention of auto accidents."
The petition suggests that if the
money is received it should be used for
research on causes of cancer such as
smoking, pollution and food additives.
The 22 petitioners also suggest a
more decentralized means for treating

cancer patients through home-care
programs, greater distribution of
resources throughout the nearby
