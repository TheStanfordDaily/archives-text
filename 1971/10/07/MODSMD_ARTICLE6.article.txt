# Medical School Dean Plans Growth, Study
## 
### 
Clayton Rich, new Dean of the
Medical School, announced yesterday
afternoon in his first address to the
Med School faculty that he would
increase the number of medical
students at the hospital, institute a
periodic review of academic
departments, and begin a study of the
Med School similar to the 1967-1969
Study of Education at Stanford (SES)'
The 47-year-old doctor, who has
held his post for just over a month,
added that he would like to see
Stanford take "a leadership role in
academic medicine."
He cautioned his audience, saying "I
wouldn't judge that a major expansion
of the Medical School was called for. . .
there are very compelling reasons not
to see this faculty grow by the
hundreds." Class size at the School at
present stands at 80. Rich sees an
increase to somewhere under 150.
In describing his intent to improve
the Med School's academic quality,
Rich announced a periodic review of all
departments which have had (the same)
chairman for over eight years," to be
conducted by professionals from other
schools.
In addition he pledged to use his
influence to improve the quality of the
anatomy and physiology departments,
which he considered to be in poor
condition, even if in the process the
financial flexibility of the Med School
is reduced.

He argued that "the criteria for
academic advancement should be
scholarship and not laboratory work."
"It is difficult to measure
scholarship in other areas such as
teaching, patient care, and delivery of
healthcare," the Dean admitted. He
added that any evaluation of a
department of the School would
depend heavily on its contribution to
the academic program.
Concerning future funding of the
Med School, Rich stated, "Any new
package from Washington contains its
risks." He recognized that strings would
be attached, but added that the risks
should be taken.
In other parts of his speech,
broadcast over closed-circuit television
to overflow crowds in two rooms, Rich
stated that he would encourage greater
use of surrounding institutions in which
clinical faculty already work. His hope
is to tie them in with the Med School.
He described the Stanford Hospital as
"a social institution" and "a regional
resource."
The tone of the Dean's speech, while
filled with references to his
unfamiliarity with the job, also showed
that he was critical of the sluggishness
of decision-making in the Med School
in past years. He said that there are
"many things that ought to be decided
now and not too few that should have
been decided long ago."

"It is difficult to measure
scholarship in other areas such as
teaching, patient care, and delivery of
healthcare," the Dean admitted. He
added that any evaluation of a
department of the School would
depend heavily on its contribution to
the academic program.
Concerning future funding of the
Med School, Rich stated, "Any new
package from Washington contains its
risks." He recognized that strings would
be attached, but added that the risks
should be taken.
In other parts of his speech,
broadcast over closed-circuit television
to overflow crowds in two rooms, Rich
stated that he would encourage greater
use of surrounding institutions in which
clinical faculty already work. His hope
is to tie them in with the Med School.
He described the Stanford Hospital as
"a social institution" and "a regional
resource."
The tone of the Dean's speech, while
filled with references to his
unfamiliarity with the job, also showed
that he was critical of the sluggishness
of decision-making in the Med School
in past years. He said that there are
"many things that ought to be decided
now and not too few that should have
been decided long ago."
Clayton Rich, new Dean of the
Medical School, announced yesterday
afternoon in his first address to the
Med School faculty that he would
increase the number of medical
students at the hospital, institute a
periodic review of academic
departments, and begin a study of the
Med School similar to the 1967-1969
Study of Education at Stanford (SES)'
The 47-year-old doctor, who has
held his post for just over a month,
added that he would like to see
Stanford take "a leadership role in
academic medicine."
He cautioned his audience, saying "I
wouldn't judge that a major expansion
of the Medical School was called for. . .
there are very compelling reasons not
to see this faculty grow by the
hundreds." Class size at the School at
present stands at 80. Rich sees an
increase to somewhere under 150.
In describing his intent to improve
the Med School's academic quality,
Rich announced a periodic review of all
departments which have had (the same)
chairman for over eight years," to be
conducted by professionals from other
schools.
In addition he pledged to use his
influence to improve the quality of the
anatomy and physiology departments,
which he considered to be in poor
condition, even if in the process the
financial flexibility of the Med School
is reduced.

He argued that "the criteria for
academic advancement should be
scholarship and not laboratory work."
"It is difficult to measure
scholarship in other areas such as
teaching, patient care, and delivery of
healthcare," the Dean admitted. He
added that any evaluation of a
department of the School would
depend heavily on its contribution to
the academic program.
