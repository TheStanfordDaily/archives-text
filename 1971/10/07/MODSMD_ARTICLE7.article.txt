Editor's Note: The following
letter is reprinted from the Nov.
4, 1965 Stanford Daily, and refers
to an incident two days before in
which Professor H. Bruce Franklin
was heckled addressing an
anti-war rally in White plaza.
Following it is a reply by one of
those who disrupted his speech.
Editor, THE DAILY:
Those well-meaning people
who have so far gone along with
the U.S. government's war in
Vietnam need to stop and
consider the kind of disgusting
moral pathology and mindless
yahooism that our policy is letting
loose here at home. Stanford had
a shocking example Tuesday noon
of how war-fever and phony
patriotism can degrade and
sabotage the ideals for which the
nation stands. I went to White
Plaza to hear my colleague
Professor Franklin speak in
support of medical aid to the
Vietnamese and against aggressive
U.S. action in Asia.
It seemed, however, that the
part of the crowd that I first
wandered into couldn't stand the
idea of free speech. In any
community - even in an academic
community I suppose— there will
always be those fearful, ignorant,
sadistic people who feel their
smelly little existences to be
somehow threatened by ideas
different from their own. Usually,
though, the university tradition of
free inquiry and discussion
manages to keep their neurotic
tendencies towards
anti-intellectual, sheep-like
orthodoxy and violence in check,
at least until they get out of
college.
But now I watched a mob of
these mental pygmies whose sick
and unpatriotic intolerance had
found a seemingly "legitimate"
outlet in ugly, xenophobic
chauvinism. They threw various
objects and debris at Dr. Franklin
and then ducked behind each
other (that's the old American
way for you!); they called
him—l'm not making this up—a
"yellow V.C."; they called
him—but not very loud, just for

each other to hear—a "dirty jew
bastard."
I saw and heard these
indecencies at this school where
the winds of freedom are
supposed to blow. And the main
point is that if this sort of thing is
happening here, it is happening all
over. The fact that the infamous
Hell's Angels won gobs of public
good-will for brutally assaulting
Berkeley peace demonstrators and
that the Ku Klux Klan stands
four-square behind our military
venture in Asia ought to make
anybody pause and thing: this war
is making rotten and obscene
behavior respectable in America.
I'm told that some people
think those who oppose the war
in Vietnam are traitors, but if a
traitor is one who betrays our
country, its marvelous ideals, and
its great republican values, then I
suggest that the treason lies
elsewhere.

Editor, THE DAILY:
I am tired of hearing those
elements in our midst who would
make of Stanford what it is not.
We have had enough of the
impotent crying and lofty
idealism that yearns for an
academic community.
Stanford is not an academic
community; at most only a small
portion of us here have any such
pretensions. For an academic
community would undoubtedly
apply intellectual conclusions to
its behavior. As one of us this
noon demanded an American
accent for a change, others of us
bombed the speaker with wads of
paper. A cohort composed
anti-Semitic epithets.
We enjoy ourselves, and until
something powerful enough
comes along to deny our
enthusiasm and zest for joy, we
are not forced to think about the
issues, so why should we behave
consistently with the norms
established by a mythical
academic community.
