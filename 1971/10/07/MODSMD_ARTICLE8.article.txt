Editor, THE DAILY:
I would like to point out some
recent mistakes on front page
photographs.
Friday, I noted that a front
page picture showed someone
labeled as a "transfer student
looking for housing" asleep in a
car. Strangely, that so-called
graduate student had a remarkable
resemblance to the undergraduate
Daily head photographer, Charlie
Lyle, who lives comfortably in a "
fraternity.
Monday I noted with interest
the picture supposedly showing an
intramural football game. Again I
found it strange to note that
several of those pictured had
never played IM football, but
rather were part of last year's
Daily football team.
Tuesday, the front page
pictured two oil tankers which it
said were prevented from
unloading by the three-month-old
longshoremen's waikout. Strange
though, that one of the tankers
was sinking, that the ILWU
doesn't unload oil tankers, and

that there is a tugboat obviously
at work in the picture. One
wonders whether this may not
have been a picture left over from
the collision of two oil tankers
last year.
Finally, yesterday I noticed a
t r uly valueless picture of a
policeman standing in front of the
President's office. The cutline
said, "This Stanford Policeman
will be affected by the shift in
departmental responsibility . .
but strangely the story
accompanying the picture made
' no mention of any such shift, and
in fact, there isn't one.
Enough is enough. Four days
in a row we have not only had
misleading pictures, but actual
fabrications in the cutlines that go
with them. Does the Daily really
have to be that irresponsible?

pictured two oil tankers which it
said were prevented from
unloading by the three-month-old
longshoremen's waikout. Strange
though, that one of the tankers
was sinking, that the ILWU
doesn't unload oil tankers, and

that there is a tugboat obviously
at work in the picture. One
wonders whether this may not
have been a picture left over from
the collision of two oil tankers
last year.
Finally, yesterday I noticed a
t r uly valueless picture of a
policeman standing in front of the
President's office. The cutline
said, "This Stanford Policeman
will be affected by the shift in
departmental responsibility . .
but strangely the story
accompanying the picture made
' no mention of any such shift, and
in fact, there isn't one.
Enough is enough. Four days
in a row we have not only had
misleading pictures, but actual
fabrications in the cutlines that go
with them. Does the Daily really
have to be that irresponsible?

daily photos
Editor, THE DAILY:
I would like to point out some
recent mistakes on front page
photographs.
Friday, I noted that a front
page picture showed someone
labeled as a "transfer student
looking for housing" asleep in a
car. Strangely, that so-called
graduate student had a remarkable
resemblance to the undergraduate
Daily head photographer, Charlie
Lyle, who lives comfortably in a "
fraternity.
Monday I noted with interest
the picture supposedly showing an
intramural football game. Again I
found it strange to note that
several of those pictured had
never played IM football, but
rather were part of last year's
Daily football team.
Tuesday, the front page
pictured two oil tankers which it
said were prevented from
unloading by the three-month-old
longshoremen's waikout. Strange
though, that one of the tankers
was sinking, that the ILWU
doesn't unload oil tankers, and

that there is a tugboat obviously
