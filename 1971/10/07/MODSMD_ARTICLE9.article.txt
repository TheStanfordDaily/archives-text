Second of Three Parts
Religiously in the afternoons a
small group of Stanford students
open their boards and sit down to
rounds of chess in the relaxing
atmosphere of the Coffeehouse.
All very nice. But then the
interesting things start to happen.
In fact, part of the stimulus for
this article grew out of my
overhearing the increased ire in
one novice's voice as he lost game
after game in one spiraling round
of enlightening frustration.

After each dismal bout came to
its end, he could be heard to
proclaim with greater and greater
agressiveness "What the Hell, man.
It's only a game, right? Play
again." And just as certain as his
voice gained in its vigor, was it
certain that his growing energies
would not be released until he had
mastered not the game, but his
opponent. His concentration was
captured and his concentration
narrowed upon learning how to
play that game to win.
Now, seething beneath the
surface of all this are some very
important and hardly obvious
facts. First, that it is through
games—through goal-directed,
competitive activities—that our
most serious pits of ability are
conducted, where the learning
process is compacted, and with
the emotional intensity to

guarantee retention. What is even
less obvious is the fact mentioned
earlier, that "games-games" differ
from "real-games" in that the
purpose of games is to realize one
goal while stating another. Let's
take a more universal example.
In the context of mammalian
life, "battle games" serve a crucial
biological purpose. At the opening
of mating season one elk bellows
what sounds at first like a mating
call, although he is answered only
by the appearance of another
male. A "battle" then ensues in
what would at first appear to be a
show of strength for the purpose
of establishing a victory and
winning the attention of the
females in the herd. But all this is
too obvious. The actual purpose
of this match is to guarantee the
physical survival of the species, as
the male who does not win also
does not mate with the females.
Now, we don't really play
games to win either. We play chess
to increase our mental capacities
and engage in physical sports as
individuals to increase our
strength, endurance and the
understanding of our bodies. But
the point is that we don't really
do any of these things very
well—we don't accomplish those
all-important implicit
goals—unless we play as if winning
were the all-important thing. In
other words: No, we don't play to
win, we play to win. How you
play the game is only
important—gets results—for the
individual, and, as we shall see, for
the society—if it is played-to-win
in the first place.

At first glance this appears
ridiculous. "What do you mean?
Why not just play to increase your
mental or physical abilities? How
absurd." And the answer is
ridiculously simple. Then it
wouldn't be a game. It would be
"serious," and nobody would
play. This is not just a play on
words, either; if so, "semantics" is
a far more serious matter than
debate-weary opponents often
care to realize. Can you imagine
going to an Agression Release and
yelling "Kill the Killers!" "Smear
the Smearers!" or Bunce is an Ass
and I'm r.n Ass calling him an
Ass!" No. The whole point is to
create a situation in which we can
be less self-conscious about our
agressiveness, not more so. (And
stay safe from each other while
we're doing it)
Which all comes down to the
peculiar fact that "experience is
the best teacher" and that we
only really experience something
when we are not consciously
aware of what we are doing.
Children don't concentrate on
learning language when the
important part of learning is
taking place. If they did, they'd
never learn it. They concentrate
on gaining control of their
world —of winning a
competition—and learn language
naturally while they are doing it,
the very thing which is the
prerequisite for really gaining
control of their environment. (See
Watts on this very subject of
games, Einstein on creative
thought and spontaneity, or finish
this article)

The lesson sneaks in through
the back door, so to speak and
rearranges all the furniture while
we are still at the front door,
peering out. Playing-to-win
— concentrating on
winning—guarantees as much as
possible that achieving the
implicit goals, the real ends of an
activity will occur.
But we haven't really
considered football. Organized
team sports, and expecially an
agressive, popular sport such as
this, share both similarities and
differences with individualized
competitions. The implicit goals
of such games transcend the needs
of the individuals who participate
in them. In fact, I would venture
to say that the sport is not even
organized with the ultimate good
of the players in mind. Certainly
they gain in athletic and mental
ability, and release a lot of
agression on the side. But the
point is that all of us who get to
glory in the victory and defeat of
the sport reap the real benefit.
Human society depends upon
its ability to provide vicarious
means for the channeling of
agressive energies. As those means
become blocked, OR THE
TRUTH ABOUT WHAT IS
HAPPENING BECOMES
EXPLICIT, the society slowly
collapses from within.
