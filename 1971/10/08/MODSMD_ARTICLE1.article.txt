# Administration, Sheriff's Office Work Toward Fact
## 
### DAVID THIEMANN 
After three months of meetings, Santa
Clara County Sheriff's officials and
University representatives have agreed
upon the general components of a plan to
deputize Stanford policemen as reserve
officers in the Sheriff's Department.
Under the provisions of the proposal,
Stanford policemen would be accorded
complete peace officer status, while
University administrators, through their
Director of Police Services, would retain
operational control of the Stanford police
force though the Sheriff would have
ultimate, if nominal, control.
If awarded official status, Stanford
policemen could legally make searches and
arrests with warrants or probable cause,
declare unlawful assemblies, make
misdemeanor arrests, and perform other
duties reserved exclusively to peace
officers. Stanford policemen now have no

special powers, and can make only
citizen's arrests.
The University would finance all
activities of the newly deputized officers,
converting them into full-time reservists,
and would control hiring and firing, but
the Sheriff would reserve the right to issue
and revoke the deputies' badges.
University representatives have met
privately with Sheriff James Geary and his
staff approximately twice a month since
midsummer to negotiate the terms of the
proposal. According to Stanford Police
Chief Marvin Herrington and Assistant to
the Provost John Schwartz, the University,
after deciding upon details in further
meetings with representatives of the
Sheriff's Office, will make a final decision
by early January on whether to proceed
with the deputization plan.
Schwartz maintained that the

University is "some distance away" from a
"mutual agreement" with the Sheriff's
Office.
Herrington refused comment on the
proposal, in an attempt to "allow as much
free exchange as possible," without
"arguing the issues in the newspapers."
Future discussions, including one
scheduled for next week, will probably
focus on the as yet unresolved specifics
and mechanics of command and control,
insurance liability, mutual aid calls, and
similar topics.
The Presidential Committee on the
Status of the Stanford Police rejected all
possible forms of contractual agreements,
arguing that "it is unlikely that the
Trustees would agree to an arrangement
that turned over to any outside agency
operational control—and therefore
responsibility—of a police force paid
wholly and voluntarily by the University."

Sheriff's officials, though they
apparently have accepted a version of the
deputization plan, still favor a contractual
arrangement with the University, similar
to those it now has with Los Altos Hills
and three other cities, providing
"extended service," beyond the coverage
it must give to all unincorporated areas
within the county. Undersheriff Tom Rosa
sharply criticized the report of the
advisory panel, commenting that "the
Commission did not make an in-depth
stidy of the various alternatives
available," and based its recommendations
upon "insufficient evidence."
Herrington estimated that his
department would need six months to
convert all of its men into peace officers,
since each member of the force must
complete a six to eight week basic training
course.
University policemen -would be

deputized pursuant to section 830.6 of the
California Penal Code, which provides that
"whenever any qualified person is
deputized or appointed by the proper
authority as a reserve or auxiliary sheriff
or city policeman, or as a deputy sheriff,
and is assigned specific police functions by
such authority, such person is a peace
officer; provided, that the authority of
such person as a peace officer shall extend
only for the duration of such specific
assignment."
While there is no legal precedent in
California for reserve deputies, paid and
directed by a private authority but
authorized by the Sheriff, there is no
obvious legal prohibition of this action.
Any legal disputes will probably focus on
the "specific police functions" and the
"duration of such specific assignment"
provided for in the Penal Code.

Commission did not make an in-depth

Herrington estimated that his
department would need six months to
convert all of its men into peace officers,
since each member of the force must
complete a six to eight week basic training
course.
University policemen -would be

deputized pursuant to section 830.6 of the
California Penal Code, which provides that
"whenever any qualified person is
deputized or appointed by the proper
authority as a reserve or auxiliary sheriff
or city policeman, or as a deputy sheriff,
and is assigned specific police functions by
such authority, such person is a peace
officer; provided, that the authority of
such person as a peace officer shall extend
only for the duration of such specific
assignment."
While there is no legal precedent in
California for reserve deputies, paid and
directed by a private authority but
authorized by the Sheriff, there is no
obvious legal prohibition of this action.
Any legal disputes will probably focus on
the "specific police functions" and the
"duration of such specific assignment"
provided for in the Penal Code.
After three months of meetings, Santa
Clara County Sheriff's officials and
University representatives have agreed
upon the general components of a plan to
deputize Stanford policemen as reserve
officers in the Sheriff's Department.
Under the provisions of the proposal,
Stanford policemen would be accorded
complete peace officer status, while
University administrators, through their
Director of Police Services, would retain
operational control of the Stanford police
force though the Sheriff would have
ultimate, if nominal, control.
If awarded official status, Stanford
policemen could legally make searches and
arrests with warrants or probable cause,
declare unlawful assemblies, make
misdemeanor arrests, and perform other
duties reserved exclusively to peace
officers. Stanford policemen now have no

special powers, and can make only
citizen's arrests.
The University would finance all
activities of the newly deputized officers,
converting them into full-time reservists,
and would control hiring and firing, but
the Sheriff would reserve the right to issue
and revoke the deputies' badges.
University representatives have met
privately with Sheriff James Geary and his
staff approximately twice a month since
midsummer to negotiate the terms of the
proposal. According to Stanford Police
Chief Marvin Herrington and Assistant to
the Provost John Schwartz, the University,
after deciding upon details in further
meetings with representatives of the
Sheriff's Office, will make a final decision
by early January on whether to proceed
with the deputization plan.
Schwartz maintained that the

University is "some distance away" from a
"mutual agreement" with the Sheriff's
Office.
Herrington refused comment on the
proposal, in an attempt to "allow as much
free exchange as possible," without
"arguing the issues in the newspapers."
Future discussions, including one
scheduled for next week, will probably
focus on the as yet unresolved specifics
and mechanics of command and control,
insurance liability, mutual aid calls, and
similar topics.
The Presidential Committee on the
Status of the Stanford Police rejected all
possible forms of contractual agreements,
arguing that "it is unlikely that the
Trustees would agree to an arrangement
that turned over to any outside agency
operational control—and therefore
responsibility—of a police force paid
wholly and voluntarily by the University."

Sheriff's officials, though they
apparently have accepted a version of the
deputization plan, still favor a contractual
arrangement with the University, similar
to those it now has with Los Altos Hills
and three other cities, providing
"extended service," beyond the coverage
it must give to all unincorporated areas
within the county. Undersheriff Tom Rosa
sharply criticized the report of the
advisory panel, commenting that "the
