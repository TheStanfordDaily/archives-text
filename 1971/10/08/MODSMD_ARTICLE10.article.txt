Present economic society can,
in fact, be viewed very easily as a
monolythic game, complete with
its rules, competitiveness, and
supported in the past by a very
"serious" but vicarious release of
energy in the playing of an
economic game to win. But it was
an empty game. There was no
implicit goal, beneficial to the
individual and society alike. Only
the explicit one. It is only our
game-games which serve both
ends. And so the implicit goal was
missing and the achievement of
the explicit grew to cancerous
proportions—just as any real-game
will do which is really played to
win, as an end in itself.
Unique Selection
It is interesting that exactly the
qualities which the recent study
published in Psychology Today
attributes to "surviving" players
of the game are just those which

guarantee the smooth functioning
of that social organism: 1) the
need for achievement and a
tendency to set high but realistic
goals for themselves and others; 2)
highly organized, orderly,
respectful of authority, and
dominant; and 3) with a large
capacity for trust, psychological
endurance, self-control, a
low-resting lovel of anxiety, and a
slightly greater ability than most
to express agression."
"In fact, competitive organized
sport is unique in the way in
which it compresses the selection
process into a compact space and
time. Few areas of human
endeavor equal the intensity of
human stress and the potential for
laying bare the personality
structure of the individual." The
survivors of organized sports must
be both physically and
psychologically competent, while
at the same time being able to

express agression openly. And for
good reason.
The society demands greater
and greater performance from its
sportsmen to meet its own
psychological needs, having
developed strains, so to speak,
which are resistent to the latest
levels of displayed agressiveness.
Only a strong PERSONALITY, as
well as a strong body, can sacrifice
what is necessary to continue to
give the spectator what he
demands and needs.
I am afraid because the social
and psychological ends of
organized sports will be sacrificed.
Stressing the game as a game takes
all the seriousness out of it and
poses a serious threat to the
society it serves.
Game War, Real War
And then what do we have:
When the very society whose vital
unconscious "rules" bubble on
the surface of social
consciousness, thereby loses the

myths which support its vicarious
release of energies, it looks to
direct means of releasing that
energy. All HELL breaks loose. It
begins to stress its wars as wars, its
game being games, and takes all
the gaming spirit out of
them-that is, the guarantee that a
serious purpose will be served by
combat. Witness this absurd War
we are "fighting."
For you see, the difference
between a real war and a game
war is that the game war states the
purpose of winning while actually
serving a far more universal and
humanitarian purpose. Or at least
the society believes it to be
justified. Where in a real war the
society justifies pure
agression—winning as an end in
itself--with all shapes and forms
of grand and glorious
humanitarian "purposes." But
nobody believes it. If a war is
really being played for
humanitarian purposes, nobody
has to say so.
This Is Absurd
And so there seems to be a
precarious relationship between
self- and other-destructiveness,
and a balance which must be
maintained artificially and with
utmost subtlety, if it must be
conscious at all.
And then we stop and cry—No!
This is absurd. IS Man really
agressive by nature? Perhaps he is
agressive because he is made to
play by the rules of a greater
game, of the society into which he
is born—rules which not only
make it IMPOSSIBLE for him to
win but which are the rules of a
game whose rule-makers insist is
REALLY SERIOUS? And so we
can chaige teh rules of the game.
But this is illusory. Because
THERE MUST BE RULES, or it
wouldn't be a game and nobody
would play. Especially we
wouldn't want to hand our
rule-making over to a group of
agressors who cry Love! and
Peace! at every corner. So what
do we do?
I know this may sound
paradoxical, but it is the only
solution that I foresee for

members of a growing
meta-society whose member
nations insist that the ultimate
game be a serious one. There must
be a vicarious release. The most
peaceful world would be one in
which the member nations would
AGREE to hold war games,for the
agreed-upon purpose of winning,
where quite violent forms of
agressive behavior were exhibited
by some for the benefit of all. In
fact, it might turn out to be the
United Nations' one greatest
contribution to peace that it
organizes, referees and hosts
international tournaments of war.
(We wouldn't call it war).
Created Equal 1
I believe that such an actuality
would serve as a monument to the
maturation of man. Children, we
have refused to accept the FACT
that we are not equal and that we
do have natural agressive
tendencies. Maturity rests in not
only reaching our potentials, but,
once reached, ADMITTING AND
ACCEPTING OUR
LIMITATIONS. Long enough
have we been sheltered under the
God-the-Father-given dictum that
all men are created equal. The
belief is necessary to provide the
confidence which a child needs
until he is mature enough to face
the truth. The time is past. We
aren't equal, even though we are
still playing the game as if we
were. There is bigotry and hatred,
racism and national fervor, all
resting upon the inability of the
INDIVIDUAL to come to grips
with the truth about himself.
But maintaining this arrogance,
we require Coaches and Priests
and Presidents and Sargeants,
placed in positions of artificial
superiority, by us, to make us
forget, our inherent individual
differences and incapacities. If
necessary, they accomplish this by
uniting the "teams" in feelings

against themselves, at all costs
creating a situation in which
individual differences are
forgotten.
Often the only unifying force
is being against, and the
realization of what we are for
fades from consciousness. BUT
THIS IS JUST THE POINT' The
greater the consciousness for
against, the greater the
unconscious assimilation of what
one is for. Socially and politically
we are slowly forming a new
game—not through any direct
study of formulation, whatever
we profess, but through the
painful and quite deadly real game
of protest—of being against,
against, against, until the
conscious elimination of
alternatives slowly shapes an
unconscious image which when it
is perfectly formed in the
blackness bursts into realization
like a Michaelangelo, glistening, all
of a piece, and white from the
bloodstone slab.
The NO-GAME
And what is this new game we
are forming? the NO-GAME. The
organization which defies all
games because it is all of a whole
and has therefore no individuals
who can play. A no-game where
we all realize our place, OF the
whole, BY the whole, and FOR
the whole.
And so the greatest myth of
this society and any like it is that
we are all "equal."There would be
no games it we were, no wars if
we knew we weren't, and none of
us around to think that we were if
Nature had for a second believed
it was true. And as we all know.

Barbara honegger

the world is full of games, full of
wars, and full of men.
But perhaps there is still hope.
The closing lines of the article in
Psychology Today paints a scene
which sounds reassuringly like it
might have been a rough sketch
for a passage from the Iliad.
"Eventually the world of sports is
going to take the emphasis off
winning at any cost. The new
direction will be towards helping
athletes make personally-chosen
modifications of behavior, toward
the joyous pursuit of esthetic
experience." We can sigh a sigh of
relief. With the slow but sure
elimination of coaches who don't
bend to the new social
consciousness and the new
emphasis upon individual
differences, we can rest assured
that the future of organized sports
will give us the all-out fighting we
all so richly need and deserve.
I hope this message has made
itself perfectly clear. It remains
only for you to see, Mr. Physique,
that your sacred game was never
meant to bend to your ideals—just
as long as you forget that,
everything will be perfectly
fine.,. .And, oh— if you're going
to play football in a ****-up
place like a university, you'd
better god damn play it to win,
brother,or not play at all.*
