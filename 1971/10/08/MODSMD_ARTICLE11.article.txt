# Nuremberg Revisited
## 
### 
short-cut
Editor, THE DAILY:
Since I once spent a year
working for the prosecution of
the Nuremberg war crimes trial, I
have been particularly struck by
Dr. Holman's recent articles in the
Daily, in which he attempts to
apply the "principle of
Nuremberg" to last year's
disturbances at Stanford.
It seems to me that Dr.
Holman and others who are
invoking the precedent of
Nuremberg in this connection fail
to emphasize the fact that what
occurred at Nuremberg was a trial.
Under a charter which defined
crimes against peace, war crimes,
and crimes against humanity,
international and American
tribunals at Nuremberg indicted,
tried, and judged—and
occasionally acquitted—leading
figures of the Third Reich, after
considering in detail a vast body
of evidence. If a principle can be
said to have been established at
Nuremberg, it is that the actions
of governments can be subjected
and under certain circumstances
ought to be subjected to the
procedures of criminal law.
But Nuremberg surely did not
produce an easy formula for the
detection and instant conviction
of war criminals. Though the guilt
of such men as Goering, Hess,
Keitel, and Frank seemed evident
before the trial, a trial was held
and a serious attempt made to
base judgment and punishment on
objective findings in the case of
each defendant.
Since 1945, war crimes fitting
the definitions which guided the
Nuremberg trials have very
probably been committed by the
governments and armed forces of
many nations, including besides
the US., the People's Republic of
China, Great Britain, France,
Pakistan, and Russia, to name
only the most probable instances.
Nuremberg provides a precedent
for the legal prosecution of such
crimes. I personally hope that this
precedent will lead to the
establishment of a permanent
international tribunal. But what
happened at Nuremberg does not
entitle individuals who believe—as
I do—that war crimes have been
committed to take into their own
hands the indictment, conviction,
and casual punishment of officials
of the US, Chinese, British,
French, Pakistani, or Russian
governments. To take this

short-cut is not to apply the
lesson of Nuremberg but to
imitate the ugly improvisations of
Joseph McCarthy.

no sense
Editor, THE DAILY:
In the days when Stanford
Medical School was still in San
Francisco, I remember hearing a
story about a luncheon where Dr.
Emile Holman asked Dr. Arthur
Bloomfield, the then Professor of
Medicine, who would be the new
Professor of Medicine when Dr.
Bloomfield retired. Dr.
Bloomfield said, "Oh, they're
looking for some young man who
knows something about research
but nothing about medicine or life
in general." After a thoughtful
interlude, Dr. Emile Holman said,
"You know, I have a son like that
at the Rockefeller Institute." Dr.
Halsted Holman has continued to
entnrtain me all these years by his
out of this world attitudes, and
his recent series on Nuremberg,
Free Speech, and the Lodge
Incident continues in that
tradition.
Now it happens that I was the
medical executive officer to
General Adams at the time the
United States Army captured the
Dachau concentration camp and
the Nuremberg trials were in the
making. During this interesting
experience I had occasion to meet
and discuss the events of the day
with many of the highly placed
and highly educated men who
were prisoners in the camp, since
the medical atrocities at Dachau
were to be taken up at
Nuremberg. The majority opinion
of the Russians, Dutch and
French, whom I dealt with in my
military capacity was that the
philosophy behind the trials at
Nuremberg was completely in
error for just the sort of
observation that Dr. Holman
makes when he compares that a
German who disrupted a speech
by Hitler would have been acting
in the highest principles of
citizenship and therefore the
Americans who interrupted Mr
Lodge before he even opened his
mouth at that particular meeting,
would be similarly justified.
Germany has always had the
tradition of being a highly literate
population. Professors were held

in high respect. According to my
Dachau friends, the rise of Hitler
came about when the universities
began to be involved in politics,
and the attitudes of the various
professors creating so much
uncertainty and antagonism
resulted in the public losing
complete confidence in the
academicians. As Lord Clark has
only recently pointed out in his
discussion of civilization, the end
result of uncertainty and lack of
confidence in a population has
been the rise of an authoritarian
figure, and I am afraid that the
actions and writings of our more
vocal faculty members can only
hasten this day. In my view, Dr.
Holman's attitude on this problem
is historically untrue and makes
no sense in the context in which
he presents it.
