Editor, THE DAILY:
Tuesday it was announced that
Engineering Dean Joseph Pettit
will leave his post at Stanford to
become the head of Georgia Tech.
Immediately • following that
announcement, I declared my
candidacy for the Deanship of
Engineering at Stanford. I am
writing this statement to clarify
certain questions which have
arisen about my platform.
Under the leadership of Dr.
Pettit and his predecessor,
Frederick Terman, the Stanford
Engineering School became
recognized as one of the best—if
not the best—engineering schools
in the nation. Paced by the
Electrical Engineering Department
and Labs and the Aero and Astro
Department, the Engineering
school has been an
invaluable servant of the Pentagon
in its attempt to technologize all
aspects of modern warfare.
If elected I promise to reverse
this trend. Stanford should refuse
all war-related research, as
determined by a review
committee made up of members
of the Stanford communities and
various other communities
affected by the work done at
Stanford.
Recognizing that such a
cutback would free office and lab
space in the Engineering School's

vast physical plant, I promise, if
elected, to convert the Aero and
Astro (Durand) building into a
Child-Care center. There are all
sorts of very fun toys over there.
If elected I will agree to accept
a salary of $20 0 per month (after
taxes). The money saved by this
salary cut should raise enough
money in a few years to pay for
every window ever broken at
Stanford.
Further details of my platform
will be released as the campaign
progresses.
VOTE FOR ME.

open letter
Dear President Lyman:
I am an observant Jewish
student-. I was deeply disturbed by
the coincidence of Yom Kippur,
the holiest day of the Jewish
Year, and the first day of classes
at Stanford. Rabbi Familant told
me that he had brought this
matter to your attention, but that
you responded with a statement
about difficulties that arise when
a variable and a constant calendar
collide. This argument is mere
sophistry.
Faced with the choice of
attending classes or services on
Wednesday, I decided to do both.
This decision was poor; I lost
much of the feeling connected
with the Day of Repentance by

spending time in class. Seeing that
the Clubhouse Auditorium was
overflowing on Tuesday evening
and not quite full on Wednesday,
1 suspect that many other
students pondered that same
question and also suffered by
mixing class attendance with
attendance at services.
What must we do to get the
Administration to move? We are
told that the University is a place
of reason and a place where words
are heard. It is not reasonable to

begin Fall Quarter on Yom
Kippur.
I suspect that the beginning of
Fall Quarter would have been
changed only if students in every
department of the University
called departmental meetings and
convinced their professors not to
teach on Yom Kippur. Such
student action is impossible
during the summer. Perhaps
pressure from a militant Jewish
group, The Jewish Defense
League, would have caused a
change.
I remain amazed at the
insensitivity this University
exhibited by scheduling the
opening of Fall Quarter on the
holiest day of the Jewish Year.
