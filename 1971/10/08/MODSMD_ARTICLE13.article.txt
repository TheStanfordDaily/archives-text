If I am not for myself, who will
be for me?
If I am for myself only, what am
I?
If not now, when ?

There were some hurt and
angry students at Stanford
University last week, and while
the hurt wasn't very deep and the
anger will not last, I think it pays
to look at these students and
examine their case.
The issue was the refusal of the
University to reschedule the
opening day of classes to avoid
conflict with Yom Kippur, the
Day of Atonement.
The group was the Stanford
Jewish community.
What is most important about
this incident, aside from the fact
that it revealed an appalling lack
of diplomacy and sensitivity on
the part of the Administration, is
the latent resentment that
surfaced as a result of the Yom
Kippur squabble.
To understand why this is not
just another instance of a
hypersensitive minority making a
lot of noise over nothing, one
must look first at the Jewish

community, and then at the Yom
Kippur holy day.
According to the best
information I could find, about
seven percent of the
undergraduate student body is
Jewish. The Stanford Hillel
organization claims that this
figure is also reasonably accurate
for graduate students. No estimate
has been made for the faculty or
staff, but at least in the former
case, the percentage is probably
higher.
So the Jews are a small group,
but far from insignificant. For the
last six years or so, they have been
quiet and unobtrusive, blending
into the larger community,
virtually unnoticed.
It was not always so.
Freedom of Religion
It would probably surprise
most students today to learn that
the big campus issue in 1965-66
was Freedom of Religion.
Nowadays we take religion for
granted, when we notice it* at all.
Religion takes on importance for
most people only when it is
challenged.
Six years ago, it was
challenged, and the threatening

sounds reached the wire services
and the pages of The New York
Times, to the deep em harassment
of the University.
The problem, as with many of
Stanford's problems, originated
with the sometimes strange wishes
of Mrs. Leland Stanford. In 1 904,
in a speech to the Board of
Trustees, Mrs. Stanford ordered
that, to keep Stanford University
free of religious controversy,
denominational religious services
be banned from the campus.
Non-denominational
And so, from 1 904 until 1 963,
Stanford was officially
non-denominational, and
Episcopal Protestantism (as
established in the Church which
Mrs. Stanford built smack in the
middle of the University), was the
official non-denomination.
The situation eased a bit in
1963, when the Board of Trustees
decided it would be okay for
non-Protestant clergymen to meet
with non-Protestant groups on
campus—as long as they didn't
pray.
In 1 966, in typical fashion, the
Board decided to move into the
18 th century by permitting
limited "denominational" services
in Memorial Church.
At this point, probably for the
first time in the school's history,
the Jews made a noise. Rabbi
Charles Familant, who had just
arrived at Stanford, refused to
conduct Jewish services in
Memorial Church. This was not a
fit of religious pique on the part
of the Rabbi. The churck is chock
full of Christian religious symbols
that make it entirely unsuitable
for Jewish ceremonies, a fact
understood by the entire Christian
religious hierarchy at Stanford,
but apparently incomprehensible
to the Board of Trustees,
including the Chairman, a fellow
named Guggenheim, who should
have known better.
RABBI BARRED FROM
SERVICES was the headline in
the Daily. The clergymen of the
United Campus Ministry backed
the Rabbi and refused to conduct
any services themselves until the
Board faced reality and stopped
trying to get Jews to pray in a
church.
Surrender
Well, of course, the Board
finally gave in, the Jews were

given the Clubhouse as an ersatz
synagogue, and everyone was
happy.
Until last week.
Now, to understand why Jews
are again talking about
confrontations with the
Administration, one must
understand Yom Kippur.
This is a day that has no
equivalent in any other Western
religion. Jews are required to
abstain entirely from food or
drink for 2 4 hours. It is a day of
contemplation, a day of
forgiveness, of confession, of
remembrance of the dead. Special
prayers are said, not only for
departed relatives, but in
memorium for the millions slain
for having been born Jews.
What makes Yom Kippur so
special, however, is not what it
asks of the religious Jew, but what

because he attended religious
services on the first day of class.
Reaching the People
Unfortunately, Hall's word had
trouble reaching the People. The
Pre-Reg Committee was asked to
announce it to the freshmen.
They didn't. The Daily was asked
to run it prominently. It was
inserted in Tuesday's paper, and
then pulled at the last minute for
space. It ran in Wednesday's
paper, in a special block in Once
Around the Quad. (Not at all
untypical—in this office, Better
Late Than Never is more a creed
than an aphorism.)
Now, one cannot accuse the
Pre-Reg Committee or the Daily
of bias or anti-Semitism. They are
both busy organizations full of
busy people, and they probably
either didn't know, or couldn't
care at the time, about the
