it gets from the non-religious Jew.
Yom Kippur is unique among
religious holidays for the loyalty it
evokes from the non-religious. For
the American Jew, Yom Kippur is
the most important day of the
year. He may not care a hill of
beans for Judaism any other day,
but on that one day he is all of a
sudden a martyr.
Fire Hazard
With no more advertising than
a single Once Around the Quad
notice in the Daily, the Hillel
Yom Kippur services this year
attracted 35 0 persons, filling the
Clubhouse to overflowing and
creating a fire hazard that God
alone could have tolerated. This is
the key point: While the Jew may
not care about administrative
indifference throughout the year,
on Yom Kippur it becomes a very
serious issue.
Now, given this strong
emotional involvement with Yom
Kippur, the Administration can
still make a very strong case for
not changing Stanford's opening
day to accommodate seven
percent of the student body who
find it inconvenient to go to class.
In fact, as far as I am concerned
(and 1 am Jewish, in case anyone
was still wondering), the
University made a proper decision
in this case.
But what is annoying beyond
description is the indifference of
most officials to the problems
faced by the student who is afraid
to miss his first day of class.
According to Harvey Hall, the
Stanford Registrar, every effort is
made to accommodate individuals
or groups who have special
reasons for missing classes or
examinations. A common case is
Seventh Day Adventists who
prefer not to take final exams on
Saturday. And one must credit
Hall for doing his best to ease the
situation by offering to intervene
in the case of any student who
was shut out of a section or a lab

anxiety that resulted, especially
on the part of the entering
student who was torn between his
duty as a Jew and his duty as a
scholar.
Neither can one accuse Robert
Rosenzweig, Assistant to
President Lyman, of prejudice
when he chose to politely but
firmly reject the request of Rabbi
Familant, several faculty
members, and some students, that
classes be cancelled. Certainly not.
But there are times when
indifference and smug callousness
make you want to scream, even if
you are heard for only a moment.
Frustration
You begin to feel frustrated
when you walk into the
Clubhouse one hour before Yom
Kippur services are to begin and
discover that "2100," a
multi-media show about Jesus, has
taken your "synagogue" for a
theater, that the Christian
Scientists are holding a meeting in
the connecting room, and the
Bridge Club has taken most of the
chairs.
Nobody is blaming the Bridge
Club, the Christian Scientists, or
the producers of "21 00But you
still want to scream.
You begin to feel frustrated
when you ask Tresidder to carry a
small supply of matzoh for the
convenience of their Jewish
customers during the week of
Passover (to be provided if
necessary by Hillel), and they
refuse.
And you begin to feel
frustrated when those nasty
rumors of a "Jewish quota" in the
freshman class circulate, and the
Admissions Office denies the
rumor but offers no evidence to
the contrary (the percentage of
Jewish students in private
universities as a whole is 17.9, as
compared to Stanford's 7.3 ).
It seems almost unreal that
Stanford students could become
worked up over a religious issue,
and the probability is very strong
that the anger will fade and the
issue will die. But the seeds of
resentment have been sown, and
the next time the scream may be
louder than this still, small voice
of mine would care to make it.

Familant, several faculty

But there are times when
indifference and smug callousness
make you want to scream, even if
you are heard for only a moment.
Frustration
You begin to feel frustrated
when you walk into the
Clubhouse one hour before Yom
Kippur services are to begin and
discover that "2100," a
multi-media show about Jesus, has
taken your "synagogue" for a
theater, that the Christian
Scientists are holding a meeting in
the connecting room, and the
Bridge Club has taken most of the
chairs.
Nobody is blaming the Bridge
Club, the Christian Scientists, or
the producers of "21 00But you
still want to scream.
You begin to feel frustrated
when you ask Tresidder to carry a
small supply of matzoh for the
convenience of their Jewish
customers during the week of
Passover (to be provided if
necessary by Hillel), and they
refuse.
And you begin to feel
frustrated when those nasty
rumors of a "Jewish quota" in the
freshman class circulate, and the
Admissions Office denies the
rumor but offers no evidence to
the contrary (the percentage of
Jewish students in private
universities as a whole is 17.9, as
compared to Stanford's 7.3 ).
It seems almost unreal that
Stanford students could become
worked up over a religious issue,
and the probability is very strong
that the anger will fade and the
issue will die. But the seeds of
resentment have been sown, and
the next time the scream may be
louder than this still, small voice
of mine would care to make it.
it gets from the non-religious Jew.
Yom Kippur is unique among
religious holidays for the loyalty it
evokes from the non-religious. For
the American Jew, Yom Kippur is
the most important day of the
year. He may not care a hill of
beans for Judaism any other day,
but on that one day he is all of a
sudden a martyr.
Fire Hazard
With no more advertising than
a single Once Around the Quad
notice in the Daily, the Hillel
Yom Kippur services this year
attracted 35 0 persons, filling the
Clubhouse to overflowing and
creating a fire hazard that God
alone could have tolerated. This is
the key point: While the Jew may
not care about administrative
indifference throughout the year,
on Yom Kippur it becomes a very
serious issue.
Now, given this strong
emotional involvement with Yom
Kippur, the Administration can
still make a very strong case for
not changing Stanford's opening
day to accommodate seven
percent of the student body who
find it inconvenient to go to class.
In fact, as far as I am concerned
(and 1 am Jewish, in case anyone
was still wondering), the
University made a proper decision
in this case.
But what is annoying beyond
description is the indifference of
most officials to the problems
faced by the student who is afraid
to miss his first day of class.
According to Harvey Hall, the
Stanford Registrar, every effort is
made to accommodate individuals
or groups who have special
reasons for missing classes or
examinations. A common case is
Seventh Day Adventists who
prefer not to take final exams on
Saturday. And one must credit
Hall for doing his best to ease the
situation by offering to intervene
in the case of any student who
was shut out of a section or a lab

anxiety that resulted, especially
on the part of the entering
student who was torn between his
duty as a Jew and his duty as a
scholar.
