Ever been driving along lately and noticed
one of those new, "say what you want" license
plates? And has your mind wandered, allowing
you to speculate on what you'd put on a
license plate?
Well, stop being so s'T-centered! You
probably don't even care iat the thousands
of happy California motorists have paid $25 to
say on their own plates. It just so happens I
made a study of that very subject.
Looking over the 3 9 page book of
personalized plates already on the road (there
are hundreds of listings on each page), 1 made
some interesting discoveries. This book,
supplied by the California Department of
Motor Vehicles (DMV), is not stimulating
reading by itself, but if one categorizes the
plates, or looks for catchy combinations, one
can have a fairly entertaining afternoon.
To save you the trouble of going all the way
to San Antonio Road to look at the only book
in the area, I have made this handy and
portable reference guide to the State's plates.
Graduate students or persons seriously
interested in pursuing such a study are urged
to read the book in full. The la "man, though,
can satisfy his desires by reading the remainder
of this article.
Eightin' Licenses!
The first category I shall relate is that of
War and Peace. Plates coming under this
heading include: ARMY, USARMY, USMC,
and PANZER vs. PEACE, PAIX, PAX, and
PAXUSA. At least nine people ordered
PEACE, so the DMV gave out PEACE 1,
PEACE 2 , and so forth.
Many people on the road display their
oedipal fantasies through their license plates.

Such cases include numerous MAMAs,
MOMMIGs, and MOMs. Those inclined toward
physics or engineering also have a voice,
displaying such plates as QUARK 3, PARSEC,
and TORQUE. Sport fiends, or jocks if you
prefer, are not far behind, with such marvels
as, TENNIS, GOLF, SWIM, TRACK,
SURFER, and ANGLER.
Now we come to the category on sex. I
suppose I should have put this section first to
stimulate more readers, but then again, those
of you who stuck this far should be rewarded.
Anyway, this sex category provides some
pretty hot combinations, LOVERS BALL for
example. Or try this: UP URANUS.
RAPER and REDHOT arc popular plates,
as is TASTEE. I was even surprised to find
PUSSY. ANIMAL LOVE, EROS, SWINGER,
TRAMP, PIE, PRRR, and PRRRR conclude
this category, except for one plate that stands
by itself: FIIAWK.
It is only fair to give this next category
equal billing; perhaps it can numb the effects
of the last one. Of course you know I'm
speaking about Religion: REPENT, MOSES,
MOSES 2 (Jewish Power!), LOVGOD, and
ALTAR are excellent examples.
Licenses Blow Your Mind
Affectionate names for girls are a common
finding. Such plates range from ANGEL to
ARF. Other plates use hip language, urging
you to RAP, RELATE, and REBEL. Calling
the whole hip scene a PHONEY MIND
BLOWER, these drivers are apt to soon be
RAMBLIN on.
French drivers have ordered their share of
these new plates. I refer to MOUSSE,
TOUCHE (DMV doesn't provide accents), and
QUEBEC. Geography occupies a favorite place

in the License Hall of Fame, counting upon
such winners as TEHRAN, TENAYA (back
packer no doubt), TEXAS, IDAHO (Newell
Lavoy, are you there?), UTAH, UTOPIA, and
MOTOWN.
Speaking of the jungle, plates with such a
natural appeal include your favorites and
mine: TARZAN, JANE, and MONKEY (sorry,
no cheetah). Moving south one encounters
such plates as ALAMO, SWANEE, and
SUGAH. Further south still and you're up
against TACO, TAMALE (urp!), and PIRANA.
Native Americans need not fear they're
being unrepresented; you could be lucky
enough to locate APACHE, REDMAN,
REDMEN, and TPEE. (That last one was a
MINNIE HA HAA.) Doctors should be on the
lookout for such conditions as RASH, MONO,
and PSYCHO. As long as we're on disorders of
the mind, at least one California driver urges us
to THINK, while others, frustrated in their
attempt to purchase THINK, have come up
with such wonders as THIMK, THIKN, and
THNIK.
Squid on Wheels
Those with their mind on their pocket
books inform us through the use of plates:
MONEY 2,4,7 and BUDGET. Some plates are
fairly clever, managing to condense many
words within the six letter limit. Among these
are: QTIPS, ASKME, MODSQD, PEPTUP,
TOPDOG, PAWNIT, MISSME, RECLTD, and
GOHOME.
Others are just plain bizarre, e.g. SQUID.
(Too bad ZUCCHINI won't fit!) The driver
advertising SPEEDY had better watch out for
the CHP if he intends to be true to his word.
I can't think of a better way to end this
article, now that I've exhausted my supply of
examples, than with a quote from one
particularly appropriate personalized license,
"ALOHA."

Ever been driving along lately and noticed
one of those new, "say what you want" license
plates? And has your mind wandered, allowing
you to speculate on what you'd put on a
license plate?
Well, stop being so s'T-centered! You
probably don't even care iat the thousands
of happy California motorists have paid $25 to
say on their own plates. It just so happens I
made a study of that very subject.
Looking over the 3 9 page book of
personalized plates already on the road (there
are hundreds of listings on each page), 1 made
some interesting discoveries. This book,
supplied by the California Department of
Motor Vehicles (DMV), is not stimulating
reading by itself, but if one categorizes the
plates, or looks for catchy combinations, one
can have a fairly entertaining afternoon.
To save you the trouble of going all the way
to San Antonio Road to look at the only book
in the area, I have made this handy and
portable reference guide to the State's plates.
Graduate students or persons seriously
interested in pursuing such a study are urged
to read the book in full. The la "man, though,
can satisfy his desires by reading the remainder
of this article.
Eightin' Licenses!
The first category I shall relate is that of
War and Peace. Plates coming under this
heading include: ARMY, USARMY, USMC,
and PANZER vs. PEACE, PAIX, PAX, and
PAXUSA. At least nine people ordered
PEACE, so the DMV gave out PEACE 1,
PEACE 2 , and so forth.
Many people on the road display their
oedipal fantasies through their license plates.

Such cases include numerous MAMAs,
MOMMIGs, and MOMs. Those inclined toward
physics or engineering also have a voice,
displaying such plates as QUARK 3, PARSEC,
and TORQUE. Sport fiends, or jocks if you
prefer, are not far behind, with such marvels
as, TENNIS, GOLF, SWIM, TRACK,
SURFER, and ANGLER.
Now we come to the category on sex. I
suppose I should have put this section first to
stimulate more readers, but then again, those
of you who stuck this far should be rewarded.
Anyway, this sex category provides some
pretty hot combinations, LOVERS BALL for
example. Or try this: UP URANUS.
RAPER and REDHOT arc popular plates,
as is TASTEE. I was even surprised to find
PUSSY. ANIMAL LOVE, EROS, SWINGER,
TRAMP, PIE, PRRR, and PRRRR conclude
this category, except for one plate that stands
by itself: FIIAWK.
It is only fair to give this next category
equal billing; perhaps it can numb the effects
of the last one. Of course you know I'm
speaking about Religion: REPENT, MOSES,
MOSES 2 (Jewish Power!), LOVGOD, and
ALTAR are excellent examples.
Licenses Blow Your Mind
Affectionate names for girls are a common
finding. Such plates range from ANGEL to
ARF. Other plates use hip language, urging
you to RAP, RELATE, and REBEL. Calling
the whole hip scene a PHONEY MIND
BLOWER, these drivers are apt to soon be
RAMBLIN on.
French drivers have ordered their share of
these new plates. I refer to MOUSSE,
TOUCHE (DMV doesn't provide accents), and
QUEBEC. Geography occupies a favorite place

in the License Hall of Fame, counting upon
such winners as TEHRAN, TENAYA (back
packer no doubt), TEXAS, IDAHO (Newell
Lavoy, are you there?), UTAH, UTOPIA, and
MOTOWN.
Speaking of the jungle, plates with such a
natural appeal include your favorites and
mine: TARZAN, JANE, and MONKEY (sorry,
no cheetah). Moving south one encounters
such plates as ALAMO, SWANEE, and
SUGAH. Further south still and you're up
against TACO, TAMALE (urp!), and PIRANA.
Native Americans need not fear they're
being unrepresented; you could be lucky
enough to locate APACHE, REDMAN,
REDMEN, and TPEE. (That last one was a
MINNIE HA HAA.) Doctors should be on the
lookout for such conditions as RASH, MONO,
and PSYCHO. As long as we're on disorders of
the mind, at least one California driver urges us
to THINK, while others, frustrated in their
attempt to purchase THINK, have come up
with such wonders as THIMK, THIKN, and
THNIK.
Squid on Wheels
Those with their mind on their pocket
books inform us through the use of plates:
MONEY 2,4,7 and BUDGET. Some plates are
fairly clever, managing to condense many
words within the six letter limit. Among these
are: QTIPS, ASKME, MODSQD, PEPTUP,
TOPDOG, PAWNIT, MISSME, RECLTD, and
GOHOME.
Others are just plain bizarre, e.g. SQUID.
(Too bad ZUCCHINI won't fit!) The driver
advertising SPEEDY had better watch out for
the CHP if he intends to be true to his word.

Ever been driving along lately and noticed
one of those new, "say what you want" license
plates? And has your mind wandered, allowing
you to speculate on what you'd put on a
license plate?
Well, stop being so s'T-centered! You
probably don't even care iat the thousands
of happy California motorists have paid $25 to
say on their own plates. It just so happens I
made a study of that very subject.
Looking over the 3 9 page book of
personalized plates already on the road (there
are hundreds of listings on each page), 1 made
some interesting discoveries. This book,
supplied by the California Department of
Motor Vehicles (DMV), is not stimulating
reading by itself, but if one categorizes the
plates, or looks for catchy combinations, one
can have a fairly entertaining afternoon.
To save you the trouble of going all the way
to San Antonio Road to look at the only book
in the area, I have made this handy and
portable reference guide to the State's plates.
Graduate students or persons seriously
interested in pursuing such a study are urged
to read the book in full. The la "man, though,
can satisfy his desires by reading the remainder
of this article.
Eightin' Licenses!
The first category I shall relate is that of
War and Peace. Plates coming under this
heading include: ARMY, USARMY, USMC,
and PANZER vs. PEACE, PAIX, PAX, and
PAXUSA. At least nine people ordered
PEACE, so the DMV gave out PEACE 1,
PEACE 2 , and so forth.
Many people on the road display their
oedipal fantasies through their license plates.

Such cases include numerous MAMAs,
MOMMIGs, and MOMs. Those inclined toward
physics or engineering also have a voice,
displaying such plates as QUARK 3, PARSEC,
and TORQUE. Sport fiends, or jocks if you
prefer, are not far behind, with such marvels
as, TENNIS, GOLF, SWIM, TRACK,
SURFER, and ANGLER.
Now we come to the category on sex. I
suppose I should have put this section first to
stimulate more readers, but then again, those
of you who stuck this far should be rewarded.
Anyway, this sex category provides some
pretty hot combinations, LOVERS BALL for
example. Or try this: UP URANUS.
RAPER and REDHOT arc popular plates,
as is TASTEE. I was even surprised to find
PUSSY. ANIMAL LOVE, EROS, SWINGER,
TRAMP, PIE, PRRR, and PRRRR conclude
this category, except for one plate that stands
by itself: FIIAWK.
It is only fair to give this next category
equal billing; perhaps it can numb the effects
of the last one. Of course you know I'm
speaking about Religion: REPENT, MOSES,
MOSES 2 (Jewish Power!), LOVGOD, and
ALTAR are excellent examples.
Licenses Blow Your Mind
Affectionate names for girls are a common
finding. Such plates range from ANGEL to
ARF. Other plates use hip language, urging
you to RAP, RELATE, and REBEL. Calling
the whole hip scene a PHONEY MIND
BLOWER, these drivers are apt to soon be
RAMBLIN on.
French drivers have ordered their share of
these new plates. I refer to MOUSSE,
TOUCHE (DMV doesn't provide accents), and
QUEBEC. Geography occupies a favorite place

in the License Hall of Fame, counting upon
such winners as TEHRAN, TENAYA (back
packer no doubt), TEXAS, IDAHO (Newell
Lavoy, are you there?), UTAH, UTOPIA, and
MOTOWN.
Speaking of the jungle, plates with such a
natural appeal include your favorites and
mine: TARZAN, JANE, and MONKEY (sorry,
no cheetah). Moving south one encounters
such plates as ALAMO, SWANEE, and
SUGAH. Further south still and you're up
against TACO, TAMALE (urp!), and PIRANA.
Native Americans need not fear they're
being unrepresented; you could be lucky
enough to locate APACHE, REDMAN,
REDMEN, and TPEE. (That last one was a
MINNIE HA HAA.) Doctors should be on the
lookout for such conditions as RASH, MONO,
and PSYCHO. As long as we're on disorders of
the mind, at least one California driver urges us
to THINK, while others, frustrated in their
attempt to purchase THINK, have come up
with such wonders as THIMK, THIKN, and
THNIK.
Squid on Wheels
Those with their mind on their pocket
books inform us through the use of plates:
MONEY 2,4,7 and BUDGET. Some plates are
fairly clever, managing to condense many
words within the six letter limit. Among these
are: QTIPS, ASKME, MODSQD, PEPTUP,
TOPDOG, PAWNIT, MISSME, RECLTD, and
GOHOME.
Others are just plain bizarre, e.g. SQUID.

Ever been driving along lately and noticed
one of those new, "say what you want" license
plates? And has your mind wandered, allowing
you to speculate on what you'd put on a
license plate?
Well, stop being so s'T-centered! You
probably don't even care iat the thousands
of happy California motorists have paid $25 to
say on their own plates. It just so happens I
made a study of that very subject.
Looking over the 3 9 page book of
personalized plates already on the road (there
are hundreds of listings on each page), 1 made
some interesting discoveries. This book,
supplied by the California Department of
Motor Vehicles (DMV), is not stimulating
reading by itself, but if one categorizes the
plates, or looks for catchy combinations, one
can have a fairly entertaining afternoon.
To save you the trouble of going all the way
to San Antonio Road to look at the only book
in the area, I have made this handy and
portable reference guide to the State's plates.
Graduate students or persons seriously
interested in pursuing such a study are urged
to read the book in full. The la "man, though,
can satisfy his desires by reading the remainder
of this article.
Eightin' Licenses!
The first category I shall relate is that of
War and Peace. Plates coming under this
heading include: ARMY, USARMY, USMC,
and PANZER vs. PEACE, PAIX, PAX, and
PAXUSA. At least nine people ordered
PEACE, so the DMV gave out PEACE 1,
PEACE 2 , and so forth.
Many people on the road display their
oedipal fantasies through their license plates.

Such cases include numerous MAMAs,
MOMMIGs, and MOMs. Those inclined toward
physics or engineering also have a voice,
displaying such plates as QUARK 3, PARSEC,
and TORQUE. Sport fiends, or jocks if you
prefer, are not far behind, with such marvels
as, TENNIS, GOLF, SWIM, TRACK,
SURFER, and ANGLER.
Now we come to the category on sex. I
suppose I should have put this section first to
stimulate more readers, but then again, those
of you who stuck this far should be rewarded.
Anyway, this sex category provides some
pretty hot combinations, LOVERS BALL for
example. Or try this: UP URANUS.
RAPER and REDHOT arc popular plates,
as is TASTEE. I was even surprised to find
PUSSY. ANIMAL LOVE, EROS, SWINGER,
TRAMP, PIE, PRRR, and PRRRR conclude
this category, except for one plate that stands
by itself: FIIAWK.
It is only fair to give this next category
equal billing; perhaps it can numb the effects
of the last one. Of course you know I'm
speaking about Religion: REPENT, MOSES,
MOSES 2 (Jewish Power!), LOVGOD, and
ALTAR are excellent examples.
Licenses Blow Your Mind
Affectionate names for girls are a common
finding. Such plates range from ANGEL to
ARF. Other plates use hip language, urging
you to RAP, RELATE, and REBEL. Calling
the whole hip scene a PHONEY MIND
BLOWER, these drivers are apt to soon be
RAMBLIN on.
French drivers have ordered their share of
these new plates. I refer to MOUSSE,
TOUCHE (DMV doesn't provide accents), and
QUEBEC. Geography occupies a favorite place

in the License Hall of Fame, counting upon
such winners as TEHRAN, TENAYA (back
packer no doubt), TEXAS, IDAHO (Newell
Lavoy, are you there?), UTAH, UTOPIA, and
MOTOWN.
Speaking of the jungle, plates with such a
natural appeal include your favorites and
mine: TARZAN, JANE, and MONKEY (sorry,
no cheetah). Moving south one encounters
such plates as ALAMO, SWANEE, and
SUGAH. Further south still and you're up
against TACO, TAMALE (urp!), and PIRANA.
Native Americans need not fear they're
being unrepresented; you could be lucky
enough to locate APACHE, REDMAN,
REDMEN, and TPEE. (That last one was a
MINNIE HA HAA.) Doctors should be on the
lookout for such conditions as RASH, MONO,
and PSYCHO. As long as we're on disorders of
the mind, at least one California driver urges us
to THINK, while others, frustrated in their
attempt to purchase THINK, have come up
with such wonders as THIMK, THIKN, and
THNIK.
Squid on Wheels
Those with their mind on their pocket
books inform us through the use of plates:
MONEY 2,4,7 and BUDGET. Some plates are
fairly clever, managing to condense many
words within the six letter limit. Among these
are: QTIPS, ASKME, MODSQD, PEPTUP,
TOPDOG, PAWNIT, MISSME, RECLTD, and
GOHOME.
Others are just plain bizarre, e.g. SQUID.
