# Fight For Reform
## Berkeley Radicals Change Council 
### 
A P—Conservatives, moderates
and even some radicals say
they are angry and frustrated
about what's been
happening—or not happening—in
Berkeley since three
self-described radicals took seats
on the City Council less than
five months ago.
The radical officials—two
young black attorneys and a
white housewife—set the battle
lines at the start of their first
council meeting May 4, when
they refused to rise for the
customary pledge of allegiance
to the flag.
A week later the council
voted to abolish the pledge at
council meetings, a move which
drew sharp criticism from
hundreds of citizens &nd
numerous civic groups across
the country.
Since then the radicals have
been fighting for big cuts in
the police budget, an end to
Berkeley's city manger form of
government, more city hiring of
minorities and women, and
numerous social programs
including creation of centers
for senior citizens, child care
and drug treatment.
While they fought heated
battles over the budget,
eventually delaying its passage
and leaving Berkeley operating
on emergency appropriations
for two months, the following
things happened:

—Thirty-one policement resigned
from the 190-man force, many
complaining bitterley about
what they called an anti-police
campaign in Berkeley.
—Radical councilmen D'Army
Bailey and Ira Simmons got
into a row with fellow radical
councilwoman Ilona Hancock
over who should have priority
in city hiring—women or
blacks.
— Rep. Ronald Dellums,
D-Calif., a staunch supporter of
the radicals, chided the three
for their lack of unity and
declared they were threatening
the "credibility of the new
politics."
—Bailey and Simmons' former
campaign manager, Eric Morton,
denounced the two as "a
couple of charlatans" interested
in furthering their own
ambitions.
—The Berkeley Black Caucus,
which backed Bailey and
Simmons last spring, accused
them of being out of touch
with the black community and
said "our trust has been
betrayed." Several caucus
members threatened to circulate
petitions for a recall election
against the two.
—Former councilman John K.
Deßonis, a conservative who
ran a poor third for mayor in
the April 6 election, says this
about Berkeley, home of the
University of California;

"If it keeps going as Bailey
and Simmons want it, this city
will consist of nothing more
than black militants and
left-wing radicals that want to
destroy this city.
Worse
"I came through Telegraph
Avenue today and how they
can stand what is going on
there is beyond my
imagination. Every other
doorway was loaded with
empty wine bottles, beer cans
and garbage. It's worse than
Haight-Asbury ever was.
"After the radicals take over
completely in 1973, there'll be
a mass exodus of police,
lawabiding Caucasians and
Negroes. They will have won
the battle of destroying one of
the greatest and nicest cities
anyone ever had the pleasure
of living in—and I've been here
since 1915," Deßonis said.
There appears to be little
doubt that the 18-year-old vote
will give the radicals control of
city government in 1973 but
Bailey said he doesn't
anticipate "any great panic."
"We're all interested
hopefully in making Berkeley a
better community. We're not
interested in destroying the
city," Bailey said.
"What the people of better
incomes have to realize is that
whether it's in Berkeley or
anywhere else they go, there
are going to be poor people
and racial minorities around
and there has to be programs
to serve their needs."
Deadlocked
Since the present council is
usually deadlocked 4-4, the
radicals have had difficulty
getting any of their major
programs through.
Mayor Warren Widener—the
city's first black chief
executive—often teams with the
radicals but swung his support
behind the four moderate
conservative councilmen to pass
the budget.

The compromise budget did
not contain a word about a
senior citizen's center, a child
care program or drug treatment
center. The police budget was
only $40,000 under the current
budget and the three radicals
called the whole package a
"sellout."
Though their major programs
failed to pass, the radicals have
succeeded in gaining new
council policies permitting
policemen and other city
employees to wear long hair,
initiating new police leniency
toward transient young people

and a unanimous vote against
raising the property tax rate.
The council also made a
tentative commitment to have
the city hire more minorities
and women, including women
for regular police patrols, but
this has been held up by a
city hiring freeze—also imposed
by the council.
Simmons, 28, a 1967
Howard Law School graduate,
said statistics indicate Berkeley
will pick up between 15,000
and 20,000 new voters in
1973—primarily from the
18-vear-old vote.
