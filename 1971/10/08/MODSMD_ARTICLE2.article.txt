# Braunstein Cross-Examines White
## 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
Outspoken campus conservative
Raymond R. White described defense
counsel Yale Braunstein as a "smart,
slimy bastard," at yesterday's Franklin
hearing as the administration concluded
its presentation of witnesses.
White's statement came under
intense cross-examination by
Braunstein, who attempted to expose
the former Free Campus Movement
Chairman as the author of a threatening
letter, (see related story.)
Braunstein also questioned White
about the origin of certain anti-radical
tracts that had been posted on kiosks
around campus. Despite pleadings by
Advisory Board Chairman Donald
Kennedy, White refused to answer.
Kennedy finaliy said that the only
action he could take would be to have
White's testimony stricken from the
record.
However, Kennedy said that no
ruling had been reached and the issue is
still "open."
White told the Daily he didn't
answer Braunstein for "safety reasons.
He said that two days after the FCM
had written a tract against the April 9
hospital sit-in, the Free Market (FCM
headquarters) had been firebombed.
Earlier in White's testimony,
Braunstein had asked him about his
bias toward radicals.
At one point he inquired, "What do
you think of me?"
White paused for a moment and
answered, "I think you're a smart slimy
bastard," to a burst of laughter from
the packed gallery.
Kennedy ordered the remark
stricken from the record.
"Getting Warm"
In his direct testimony White told of
having gone to the Old Union rally late
in the evening of February 10 because
he "felt that the rally was getting warm
and that action wasn't far away."

After the rally, said White, he and a
group of about 15 FCMers were
heading back to the Free Market when
a group from the rally "charged us."
One FCM cameraman was beaten
unconscious, he added.
Later that night a group walked by
FCM headquarters, White claimed,
"picking up rock as they came and then
throwing them at us."
Franklin has been charged with
inciting violence the night of the 10th.
Earlier in the afternoon's
proceedings Santa Clara Undersheriff
Thomas J. Rosa told of being at the
police command post on campus the
night of February 10th.
Rosa said that there had been two
reports of felonious assault on a police
officer, and an arrest for interference
with a police officer as well as one
destruction of a University fire alarm.
No Provocation
Also testifying yesterday were
Associate Annual Fund Director David
Glenn who told of the FCM group
being set upon without provocation,
and Food Research Institute professor
Roger Gray, who said Franklin had
"some leadership role with the
audience" at the Old Union rally the
evening of the 10th.
There was also read at the hearing a
deposition taken from a Stanford
junior now in England who described
Franklin's evening speech as
"inflammatory."
The deposition concluded the
Administration's presentation of
witnesses.
At the close of yesterday's hearing,
Administration attorney Raymond
Fisher announced that today he would
play tapes of a Dinkelspiel meeting on
February 9 and of the Old Union rally
on the 10th, as well as introduce
documentary evidence of property
damage on the 10th. After that, the
prosecution will rest.
The hearings resume today at 1 p.m.
