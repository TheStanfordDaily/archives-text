# Games Students Play
## Watch That Persimmon! 
### JERRY COLEMAN 
Here we are in the midst of
football season, and one can see
dorm residents all over campus
tromping out to nearby fields to
practice for the Intramurals.
Such dorm football workouts
have always been a common
feature of the Autumn quarter.
Hut the question that most people
overlook, is "What about the
dorm sports that never make the
Intram urals?"
In the past, dorm residents
have been busily occupied,
practicing for unusual sports that
never get approved by the
Athletic Dept. Many hours a week
were expended to perfect skills in
hallway frisbee, soccer, field
hockey, and golf. The narrow
shape of most dorm hallways puts
a premium on accuracy in these
sports.
In Arroyo last year, two full
teams would gather to play
hallway soccer; most of the
standard rules were used, with the
exception that an extra two
points was awarded for each light
broken. Hallway driving, chipping,
and putting practice also resulted
in smashed lights.
Arroyo 1 97 0 residents built a
strong feeling of comraderie and
sportsmanship around their
sports. In fact, these athletes were
such good sports, they gladly paid
the $800 levied against them for
Autumn quarter damages.
In Florence Moore last year,
residents favored water sports:
"Hose Fight," "Catapult," and

"Water balloon War" filled many
hours of an otherwise dull
quarter. The only disadvantage
with Hose Fight was the expense
incurred to dry out the hose,
reinstall it, replace the glass case,
and remove water stains on the
hall carpet.
Water balloon War offered
much the same fun, but with
hardly any expense risked. Rather
than describe a practice session of
this hardy sport, 1 chose to
include a particularly lucid
account of an actual war between
Gavilan and Loro, two Flo Mo
dorms.
My source is a late autumn
issue of the Gavilan Weekly
Zucchini, a do-m newspaper. The
author of the article, "Report
from the Front," has asked that
he remain anonymous.
"Saturday night was the time
for another devastating attack
from the Lorons. Before the
battle began, both sides
courteously asked each other if
they were ready. At an
appropriately ambiguous signal,
the first balloon (from Loro) hit
the Gavilan door.
Immediately, the air exploded
with the sound of splashing water,
as a colorful array of balloons
whizzed back and forth between
the dorms. Gavilan, restricted to
the defensive, was unprepared for
a sneak attack from the rear of
the third floor hallway.
This reporter was there,
though, and sustained minor
injuries to the hat and face, as a

balloon was pressed against his
head. He did manage to get a shot
back at his attackers before they
hastily lied down the stairs."
The final water sport
mentioned, "Catapult," involved a
clever device capable of firing
waterballoons up to distances of
500 feet. Favorite targets were
passing cars, pedestrians, and
music students ascending the steps
of the Knoll.
Other activities from the
heyday of dorm sporting events
include two floor-to-floor
competitions, "Persimmon
Attack" and "Pistachio Toss."
The object of these rigorous
games was to lean out of your
window and throw either
persimmons (Arroyo) or pistachio
shells (Gavilan) into the room
below or above yours.
Unfortunately, the sports seem
to have disappeared from campus
this year. It may be too early to
tell, but current reports from the
dorms indicate that residents have

found mellower ways to spend
their leisure hours.
In the words of one Arroyo
resident, "People here are usually
too drunk to play games."
Another conceded that only one
game was being played: "Spin the
joint."
When asked about hallway
athletics, a Branner resident
replied, "We're civilized here."
And one of last year's Lorons, still
residing in Flo Mo, laments, "It's
been dead here."
Two choices seem to make
themselves clear to all you people
who live in dorms: you can either
confine these great sports to the
backlogs of history, or you can
start season practice right away,
while petitioning the Athletic
Dept. to put these games on their
approved list. Man has shown time
and time again that he is incapable
of learning from the lessons of
history. At last, Stanford man
now has the chance to choose
correctly.

clever device capable of firing
waterballoons up to distances of
500 feet. Favorite targets were
passing cars, pedestrians, and
music students ascending the steps
of the Knoll.
Other activities from the
heyday of dorm sporting events
include two floor-to-floor
competitions, "Persimmon
Attack" and "Pistachio Toss."
The object of these rigorous
games was to lean out of your
window and throw either
persimmons (Arroyo) or pistachio
shells (Gavilan) into the room
below or above yours.
Unfortunately, the sports seem
to have disappeared from campus
this year. It may be too early to
tell, but current reports from the
dorms indicate that residents have

found mellower ways to spend
their leisure hours.
In the words of one Arroyo
resident, "People here are usually
too drunk to play games."
Another conceded that only one
game was being played: "Spin the
joint."
When asked about hallway
athletics, a Branner resident
replied, "We're civilized here."
And one of last year's Lorons, still
residing in Flo Mo, laments, "It's
been dead here."
Two choices seem to make
themselves clear to all you people
who live in dorms: you can either
confine these great sports to the
backlogs of history, or you can
start season practice right away,
while petitioning the Athletic
Dept. to put these games on their
approved list. Man has shown time
and time again that he is incapable
of learning from the lessons of
history. At last, Stanford man
now has the chance to choose
correctly.


DOG HERO DEVOURS UFO-Bet you thought 1 was going to title this caption, "It's a Dog's Life,"
didn't you? Even campus dogs can get in on the fun of i)onn Sports. Put on your snorkel and your play
smock and arm yourselves with candied yams- the Fall Non-Intramurals are about to begin!
Here we are in the midst of
football season, and one can see
dorm residents all over campus
tromping out to nearby fields to
practice for the Intramurals.
Such dorm football workouts
have always been a common
feature of the Autumn quarter.
Hut the question that most people
overlook, is "What about the
dorm sports that never make the
Intram urals?"
In the past, dorm residents
have been busily occupied,
practicing for unusual sports that
never get approved by the
Athletic Dept. Many hours a week
were expended to perfect skills in
hallway frisbee, soccer, field
hockey, and golf. The narrow
shape of most dorm hallways puts
a premium on accuracy in these
sports.
In Arroyo last year, two full
teams would gather to play
hallway soccer; most of the
standard rules were used, with the
exception that an extra two
points was awarded for each light
broken. Hallway driving, chipping,
and putting practice also resulted
in smashed lights.
Arroyo 1 97 0 residents built a
strong feeling of comraderie and
sportsmanship around their
sports. In fact, these athletes were
such good sports, they gladly paid
the $800 levied against them for
Autumn quarter damages.
In Florence Moore last year,
residents favored water sports:
"Hose Fight," "Catapult," and

"Water balloon War" filled many
hours of an otherwise dull
quarter. The only disadvantage
with Hose Fight was the expense
incurred to dry out the hose,
reinstall it, replace the glass case,
and remove water stains on the
hall carpet.
Water balloon War offered
much the same fun, but with
hardly any expense risked. Rather
than describe a practice session of
this hardy sport, 1 chose to
include a particularly lucid
account of an actual war between
Gavilan and Loro, two Flo Mo
dorms.
My source is a late autumn
issue of the Gavilan Weekly
Zucchini, a do-m newspaper. The
author of the article, "Report
from the Front," has asked that
he remain anonymous.
"Saturday night was the time
for another devastating attack
from the Lorons. Before the
battle began, both sides
courteously asked each other if
they were ready. At an
appropriately ambiguous signal,
the first balloon (from Loro) hit
the Gavilan door.
Immediately, the air exploded
with the sound of splashing water,
as a colorful array of balloons
whizzed back and forth between
the dorms. Gavilan, restricted to
the defensive, was unprepared for
a sneak attack from the rear of
the third floor hallway.
This reporter was there,
though, and sustained minor
injuries to the hat and face, as a

balloon was pressed against his
head. He did manage to get a shot
back at his attackers before they
hastily lied down the stairs."

Arroyo 1 97 0 residents built a
strong feeling of comraderie and
sportsmanship around their
sports. In fact, these athletes were
such good sports, they gladly paid
the $800 levied against them for
Autumn quarter damages.
In Florence Moore last year,
residents favored water sports:
"Hose Fight," "Catapult," and

"Water balloon War" filled many
hours of an otherwise dull
quarter. The only disadvantage
with Hose Fight was the expense
incurred to dry out the hose,
reinstall it, replace the glass case,
and remove water stains on the
hall carpet.
Water balloon War offered
much the same fun, but with
hardly any expense risked. Rather
than describe a practice session of
this hardy sport, 1 chose to
include a particularly lucid
account of an actual war between
Gavilan and Loro, two Flo Mo
dorms.
My source is a late autumn
issue of the Gavilan Weekly
Zucchini, a do-m newspaper. The
author of the article, "Report
from the Front," has asked that
he remain anonymous.
"Saturday night was the time
for another devastating attack
from the Lorons. Before the
battle began, both sides
courteously asked each other if
they were ready. At an
appropriately ambiguous signal,
the first balloon (from Loro) hit
the Gavilan door.
Immediately, the air exploded
with the sound of splashing water,
as a colorful array of balloons
whizzed back and forth between
the dorms. Gavilan, restricted to
the defensive, was unprepared for
a sneak attack from the rear of
the third floor hallway.
This reporter was there,
though, and sustained minor
injuries to the hat and face, as a

balloon was pressed against his
head. He did manage to get a shot
back at his attackers before they
hastily lied down the stairs."
The final water sport
mentioned, "Catapult," involved a
clever device capable of firing
waterballoons up to distances of
500 feet. Favorite targets were
passing cars, pedestrians, and
music students ascending the steps
of the Knoll.
Other activities from the
heyday of dorm sporting events
include two floor-to-floor
competitions, "Persimmon
Attack" and "Pistachio Toss."
The object of these rigorous
games was to lean out of your
window and throw either
persimmons (Arroyo) or pistachio
shells (Gavilan) into the room
below or above yours.
Unfortunately, the sports seem
to have disappeared from campus
this year. It may be too early to
tell, but current reports from the
dorms indicate that residents have

found mellower ways to spend
their leisure hours.
In the words of one Arroyo
resident, "People here are usually
too drunk to play games."
Another conceded that only one
game was being played: "Spin the
joint."
When asked about hallway
athletics, a Branner resident
replied, "We're civilized here."
And one of last year's Lorons, still
residing in Flo Mo, laments, "It's
been dead here."
Two choices seem to make
themselves clear to all you people
who live in dorms: you can either
confine these great sports to the
backlogs of history, or you can
start season practice right away,
while petitioning the Athletic
Dept. to put these games on their
approved list. Man has shown time
and time again that he is incapable
of learning from the lessons of
history. At last, Stanford man
now has the chance to choose
correctly.


DOG HERO DEVOURS UFO-Bet you thought 1 was going to title this caption, "It's a Dog's Life,"
didn't you? Even campus dogs can get in on the fun of i)onn Sports. Put on your snorkel and your play
smock and arm yourselves with candied yams- the Fall Non-Intramurals are about to begin!
