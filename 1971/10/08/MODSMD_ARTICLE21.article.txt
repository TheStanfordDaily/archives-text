away from the Fish, although he
did perform with them in concert
through the spring of 1970. He

has since released three albums on
his own.
Han Hicks and His Hot Licks is
a five-person group whose music is
described as some sort of blend
between western swing, Thirties
jump, shuffles, rags, jazz, country
and blues. I've heard them a
couple of times before and they're
a pretty good and a pretty unique
group.
