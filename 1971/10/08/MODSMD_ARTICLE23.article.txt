# 'The Go-Between' & 'Adrift' Highlight Film Festival
## 
### TODD McCARTHY 
The San Francisco Film
Festival has been in progress
almost one week now and in that
time I've managed to grow quite
sick of Route 2HO, beautiful road
though it is, and see all but one of
the evening feature films, eight in
all. Despite its small seating
capacity and outrageously priced
and under-stocked concessions
stand, the Palace of Fine Arts
seems to be working out decently
enough as a location, the weather
has been great and all the guest
artists are delighted to be in San
Francisco. Most festival-goers have
had little to complain about.
Opening night was the
congenial fiasco it always is, as
there were too few dinner places
set and the regular guests, who
had paid only $75 to attend, had
to wait almost an hour for their
food until after the festival
royalty had been served.
Complaints about the service were
mainly directed at Joe Alioto,
whom everyone wanted to see ask
Dianne Feinstein to dance.
With Rex Harrison as opening
night master of ceremonies and
Princess Alexandra as guest of
honor (much conversation
revolved around figuring out
exactly who she is), one might
have had the right to expect even
more pomp than there was, but
San Francisco seemed to
encourage even the official British
representatives to loosen up.
Actually, Harrison was a
surpassingly bland m.c., except
when he pronounced hizzoner's
name "Ah-li-ah-to" and is actually
much shorter and less imposing,

both physically and vocally, in
person than he is on screen. The
Princess admirably maintained the
tradition of dowdiness in British
royalty, as she was easily the
worst dressed woman at the gala.
The mayor himself seemed to be
perspiring freely.
"The Go-Between"
"The Go-Between" was the
best choice for an opening night
film in years, but this third
collaboration between Harold
Pinter and Joseph Losey remains
problematical. The period details
are all lovingly attended to, and
the performances are fine and
many scenes are subtle and sly but
the dual focus of the film renders
it psychologically unsatisfying.
The main action of the film takes
place in late Edwardian England
where a young boy, well-played
by Dominic Guard, becomes a
messenger for well-to-do Julie
Christie and Alan Bates, a
lower-class farmer with whom
Julie is having an affair. What
transpires out of this role
traumatizes the boy for life, as we
see in brief flash-forwards to
Michael Redgrave as the boy
turned isolated old man.
What ultimately the film
should have dealt with was the
psychology of the old man,
explaining how
What ultimately the film
should have dealt with was the
psychology of the old man,
explaining how he was affected
rather than dramatizing the events
which disturbed him.
The other British film shown so
far was "Sunday Bloody Sunday'

and in the brief period since it was
released in New York, both
director John Schlesinger and
critic-writer turned scenarist
Penelope Gilliatt have been
praised to the heavens for their
work. By and large, I think the
praise is justified. Both are
terribly well served by the final
product. The script is the most
literate, emotionally acute work
for an English language film in
ages and it's by far Schlesinger's
finest achievement.
However, 1 tend to think
Schlesinger is terribly dependent
on his cameramen for the look of
his films, particularly those in
color. The lenses which achieved
the soft, breezy color of "Far
From the Madding Crowd" were
unmistakably those of Nicolas
Roeg, which compared with the
ugly work of a previously
anonymous cinematographer on
"Midnight Cowboy." "Sunday
Bloody Sunday is brilliantly lit by
Billy Williams, who added so
much to "Women in Love."
In fact, the film is of such
hardness and slickness that it
compares visually to the style
Mike Nichols has been working
towards recently and finally
resolved in "Carnal Knowledge."
The film looks absolutely finished
and polished and technically it is
quite beautiful, but for a work
which deals with the attempt at
emotional articulation and
definition by its characters,
leaving no rough edges makes it all

seem perhaps too perfect to be
true.
Outstanding Performances
As usual with Schlesinger, the
performances are superb, with
Peter Finch being particularly
outstanding as a Jewish doctor
homosexual who is one-third of a
sexual triangle in competition
with Glenda Jackson for the
affections of swinging pivot
Murray Head. None of the "Boys
in the Band" "the only happy
faggot is a gay corpse" antics for
Finch. He is quite contented and
resolved in his life style and
suffers quietly in his living room
to the accompaniment of classical
music on the stereo.
Jan Kadar's new film,
"Adrift," was shown at the
festival Sunday and has since
opened at the Century 21. For the
first hour or so I found the film
mysterious to the point of
obfuscation but in the last half
hour, all the intensely personal
psychological undertones with
which Kadar loads his work began
clarifying themselves with
remarkable rapidity and
profundity, ending with one of
the most stunning final images I
have ever encountered.
"Adrift" deals with a simple
fisherman tragically confronting
the truth about himself and the
women in his life. The film has
the intense psychological probing
which "The Go-Between" could
have used more of and also

introduces a stunning new face,
that of Paula Pritchett, who is
positively Amazonian. Kadar's
work is so complex that, as
illuminating as the last half hour
is, some doubts and confusion
remain as to exactly what has
occurred. For me, however,
"Adrift" is a significant
improvement upon Kadar's "The
Shop on Main Street."


DEAR JOHN—Julie Christie stars as the heiress of the wealthy
Maudsley family in "The Go-Between." The movie concerns a
messenger between Christie and her lover, a lower-class farmer
portrayed by Alan Bates.


"ADRIFT" Pritchett is Jan Kadar's new face in his latest
effort, "Adrift." Pritchett is cast as one of the women in the life of a
simple fisherman.

Opening night was the
congenial fiasco it always is, as
there were too few dinner places
set and the regular guests, who
had paid only $75 to attend, had
to wait almost an hour for their
food until after the festival
royalty had been served.
Complaints about the service were
mainly directed at Joe Alioto,
whom everyone wanted to see ask
Dianne Feinstein to dance.
With Rex Harrison as opening
night master of ceremonies and
Princess Alexandra as guest of
honor (much conversation
revolved around figuring out
exactly who she is), one might
have had the right to expect even
more pomp than there was, but
San Francisco seemed to
encourage even the official British
representatives to loosen up.
Actually, Harrison was a
surpassingly bland m.c., except
when he pronounced hizzoner's
name "Ah-li-ah-to" and is actually
much shorter and less imposing,

both physically and vocally, in
person than he is on screen. The
Princess admirably maintained the
tradition of dowdiness in British
royalty, as she was easily the
worst dressed woman at the gala.
The mayor himself seemed to be
perspiring freely.
"The Go-Between"
"The Go-Between" was the
best choice for an opening night
film in years, but this third
collaboration between Harold
Pinter and Joseph Losey remains
problematical. The period details
are all lovingly attended to, and
the performances are fine and
many scenes are subtle and sly but
the dual focus of the film renders
it psychologically unsatisfying.
The main action of the film takes
place in late Edwardian England
where a young boy, well-played
by Dominic Guard, becomes a
messenger for well-to-do Julie
Christie and Alan Bates, a
lower-class farmer with whom
Julie is having an affair. What
transpires out of this role
traumatizes the boy for life, as we
see in brief flash-forwards to
Michael Redgrave as the boy
turned isolated old man.
What ultimately the film
should have dealt with was the
psychology of the old man,
explaining how
What ultimately the film
should have dealt with was the
psychology of the old man,
explaining how he was affected
rather than dramatizing the events
which disturbed him.
The other British film shown so
far was "Sunday Bloody Sunday'

and in the brief period since it was
released in New York, both
director John Schlesinger and
critic-writer turned scenarist
Penelope Gilliatt have been
praised to the heavens for their
work. By and large, I think the
praise is justified. Both are
terribly well served by the final
product. The script is the most
literate, emotionally acute work
for an English language film in
ages and it's by far Schlesinger's
finest achievement.
However, 1 tend to think
Schlesinger is terribly dependent
on his cameramen for the look of
his films, particularly those in
color. The lenses which achieved
the soft, breezy color of "Far
From the Madding Crowd" were
unmistakably those of Nicolas
Roeg, which compared with the
ugly work of a previously
anonymous cinematographer on
"Midnight Cowboy." "Sunday
Bloody Sunday is brilliantly lit by
Billy Williams, who added so
much to "Women in Love."
In fact, the film is of such
hardness and slickness that it
compares visually to the style
Mike Nichols has been working
towards recently and finally
resolved in "Carnal Knowledge."
The film looks absolutely finished
and polished and technically it is
quite beautiful, but for a work
which deals with the attempt at
emotional articulation and
definition by its characters,
leaving no rough edges makes it all

seem perhaps too perfect to be
true.
Outstanding Performances
As usual with Schlesinger, the
performances are superb, with
Peter Finch being particularly
outstanding as a Jewish doctor
homosexual who is one-third of a
sexual triangle in competition
with Glenda Jackson for the
affections of swinging pivot
Murray Head. None of the "Boys
in the Band" "the only happy
faggot is a gay corpse" antics for
Finch. He is quite contented and
resolved in his life style and
suffers quietly in his living room
to the accompaniment of classical
music on the stereo.
Jan Kadar's new film,
"Adrift," was shown at the
festival Sunday and has since
opened at the Century 21. For the
first hour or so I found the film
mysterious to the point of
obfuscation but in the last half
hour, all the intensely personal
psychological undertones with
which Kadar loads his work began
clarifying themselves with
remarkable rapidity and
profundity, ending with one of
the most stunning final images I
have ever encountered.
"Adrift" deals with a simple
fisherman tragically confronting
the truth about himself and the
women in his life. The film has
the intense psychological probing
which "The Go-Between" could
have used more of and also

introduces a stunning new face,
that of Paula Pritchett, who is
positively Amazonian. Kadar's
work is so complex that, as
illuminating as the last half hour
is, some doubts and confusion
remain as to exactly what has
occurred. For me, however,
"Adrift" is a significant
improvement upon Kadar's "The
Shop on Main Street."


DEAR JOHN—Julie Christie stars as the heiress of the wealthy
Maudsley family in "The Go-Between." The movie concerns a
messenger between Christie and her lover, a lower-class farmer
portrayed by Alan Bates.


"ADRIFT" Pritchett is Jan Kadar's new face in his latest
effort, "Adrift." Pritchett is cast as one of the women in the life of a
simple fisherman.
The San Francisco Film
Festival has been in progress
almost one week now and in that
time I've managed to grow quite

the evening feature films, eight in

San Francisco seemed to
encourage even the official British
representatives to loosen up.
Actually, Harrison was a
surpassingly bland m.c., except
when he pronounced hizzoner's
name "Ah-li-ah-to" and is actually
much shorter and less imposing,

both physically and vocally, in
person than he is on screen. The
Princess admirably maintained the
tradition of dowdiness in British
royalty, as she was easily the
worst dressed woman at the gala.
The mayor himself seemed to be
perspiring freely.
"The Go-Between"
"The Go-Between" was the
best choice for an opening night
film in years, but this third
collaboration between Harold
Pinter and Joseph Losey remains
problematical. The period details
are all lovingly attended to, and
the performances are fine and
many scenes are subtle and sly but
the dual focus of the film renders
it psychologically unsatisfying.
The main action of the film takes
place in late Edwardian England
where a young boy, well-played
by Dominic Guard, becomes a
messenger for well-to-do Julie
Christie and Alan Bates, a
lower-class farmer with whom
Julie is having an affair. What
transpires out of this role
traumatizes the boy for life, as we
see in brief flash-forwards to
Michael Redgrave as the boy
turned isolated old man.
What ultimately the film
should have dealt with was the
psychology of the old man,
explaining how
What ultimately the film
should have dealt with was the
psychology of the old man,
explaining how he was affected
rather than dramatizing the events
which disturbed him.
The other British film shown so
far was "Sunday Bloody Sunday'

and in the brief period since it was
released in New York, both
director John Schlesinger and
critic-writer turned scenarist
Penelope Gilliatt have been
praised to the heavens for their
work. By and large, I think the
praise is justified. Both are
terribly well served by the final
product. The script is the most
literate, emotionally acute work
for an English language film in
ages and it's by far Schlesinger's
finest achievement.
However, 1 tend to think
Schlesinger is terribly dependent
on his cameramen for the look of
his films, particularly those in
color. The lenses which achieved
the soft, breezy color of "Far
From the Madding Crowd" were
unmistakably those of Nicolas
Roeg, which compared with the
ugly work of a previously
anonymous cinematographer on
"Midnight Cowboy." "Sunday
Bloody Sunday is brilliantly lit by
Billy Williams, who added so
much to "Women in Love."
In fact, the film is of such
hardness and slickness that it
compares visually to the style
Mike Nichols has been working
towards recently and finally
resolved in "Carnal Knowledge."
The film looks absolutely finished
and polished and technically it is
quite beautiful, but for a work
which deals with the attempt at
emotional articulation and
definition by its characters,
leaving no rough edges makes it all

seem perhaps too perfect to be
true.
Outstanding Performances
As usual with Schlesinger, the
performances are superb, with
Peter Finch being particularly
outstanding as a Jewish doctor
homosexual who is one-third of a
sexual triangle in competition
with Glenda Jackson for the
affections of swinging pivot
Murray Head. None of the "Boys
in the Band" "the only happy
faggot is a gay corpse" antics for
Finch. He is quite contented and
resolved in his life style and
suffers quietly in his living room
to the accompaniment of classical
music on the stereo.
Jan Kadar's new film,
"Adrift," was shown at the
festival Sunday and has since
opened at the Century 21. For the
first hour or so I found the film
mysterious to the point of
obfuscation but in the last half
hour, all the intensely personal
psychological undertones with
which Kadar loads his work began
clarifying themselves with
remarkable rapidity and
profundity, ending with one of
the most stunning final images I
have ever encountered.
"Adrift" deals with a simple
fisherman tragically confronting
the truth about himself and the
women in his life. The film has
the intense psychological probing
which "The Go-Between" could
have used more of and also

introduces a stunning new face,
that of Paula Pritchett, who is
positively Amazonian. Kadar's
work is so complex that, as
illuminating as the last half hour
is, some doubts and confusion
remain as to exactly what has
occurred. For me, however,
"Adrift" is a significant
improvement upon Kadar's "The
Shop on Main Street."


DEAR JOHN—Julie Christie stars as the heiress of the wealthy
Maudsley family in "The Go-Between." The movie concerns a
messenger between Christie and her lover, a lower-class farmer
portrayed by Alan Bates.


"ADRIFT" Pritchett is Jan Kadar's new face in his latest
effort, "Adrift." Pritchett is cast as one of the women in the life of a
simple fisherman.
The San Francisco Film
Festival has been in progress
almost one week now and in that
time I've managed to grow quite
sick of Route 2HO, beautiful road
though it is, and see all but one of
the evening feature films, eight in
all. Despite its small seating
capacity and outrageously priced
and under-stocked concessions
stand, the Palace of Fine Arts
seems to be working out decently
enough as a location, the weather
has been great and all the guest
artists are delighted to be in San
Francisco. Most festival-goers have
had little to complain about.
Opening night was the
congenial fiasco it always is, as
there were too few dinner places
set and the regular guests, who
had paid only $75 to attend, had
to wait almost an hour for their
food until after the festival
royalty had been served.
Complaints about the service were
mainly directed at Joe Alioto,
whom everyone wanted to see ask
Dianne Feinstein to dance.
With Rex Harrison as opening
night master of ceremonies and
Princess Alexandra as guest of
honor (much conversation
revolved around figuring out
exactly who she is), one might
