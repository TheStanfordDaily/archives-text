# Alumni Match To Highlight Weekend Water Polo Action
## 
### DOUG WILSON 
Officially, Stanford's varsity
water polo team is scheduled to
meet UC-Berkeley and Cal
Poly-Pomona this weekend, but a
Sunday match with a bunch of
"old timers" promises to be the
most interesting of the three.
Alumni Match
Coach Jim Gaughran's varsity
squad will meet Coach Jim
Gaughran, assistant coach Jeff
Hammett, and "all the stars from
the past 20 years," as Hammett
puts it, in a varsity-alumni tilt
which begins at 11:00 a.m.
Sunday. Among the alumni
returnees will be Olympians Gary
Sheerer, Mark Parmalee, and Greg
Buckingham, the latter a member
of Stanford's NCAA
championship swimming team of
1967, as well as Bob Momsen,
John Parker, and a famous name
from the dimly-lit past—James
Gaughran, the captain of the 1954
Stanford team.
Stanford's varsity water polo

team, in contention tor a
championship that has eluded
them since 1963, opens its home
season Saturday against Cal
Poly-Pomona, after what is
expected to be a tough contest
with the University of California
at the Berkeley pool this
afternoon.
In addition, the varsity poloists
will meet an all-star alumni squad
on Sunday in a match which
could well prove to be the most
difficult of the weekend.
Second Place
The Indian squad, which
placed second to San Jose State in
last weekend's Northern
California Water Polo Tournament
at De Anza, will be led by
three-time All-Pacific 8 selection
Rick Massamino, and last year's
high scorer, Mike Davis.
Defensively, Stanford boasts
goalie Pete Gadd, a key factor in
last week's tournament victories.
Gadd is also expected to figure in
today's game with Cal, also a

contender for the Pacific 8 title,
and known to be a tough
offensive team.
Face Pomona
Saturday's contest against Cal
Poh will mark the first time
Stanford has met the Pomona
poloists. However, the Stanford
squad will be favored on the basis
of field depth provided by
returning lettermen Ken Hammer,
Dan Powlison, Stu Rowe, Rill
Simpkins, Bob Warren, Handy
Wilkins and Hob Wooley and
freshman Greg Loitz.

meet UC-Berkeley and Cal
Poly-Pomona this weekend, but a
Sunday match with a bunch of
"old timers" promises to be the
most interesting of the three.
Alumni Match
Coach Jim Gaughran's varsity
squad will meet Coach Jim
Gaughran, assistant coach Jeff
Hammett, and "all the stars from
the past 20 years," as Hammett
puts it, in a varsity-alumni tilt
which begins at 11:00 a.m.
Sunday. Among the alumni
returnees will be Olympians Gary
Sheerer, Mark Parmalee, and Greg
Buckingham, the latter a member
of Stanford's NCAA
championship swimming team of
1967, as well as Bob Momsen,
John Parker, and a famous name
from the dimly-lit past—James
Gaughran, the captain of the 1954
Stanford team.
Stanford's varsity water polo

team, in contention tor a
championship that has eluded
them since 1963, opens its home
season Saturday against Cal
Poly-Pomona, after what is
expected to be a tough contest
with the University of California
at the Berkeley pool this
afternoon.
In addition, the varsity poloists
will meet an all-star alumni squad
on Sunday in a match which
could well prove to be the most
difficult of the weekend.
Second Place
The Indian squad, which
placed second to San Jose State in
last weekend's Northern
California Water Polo Tournament
at De Anza, will be led by
three-time All-Pacific 8 selection
Rick Massamino, and last year's
high scorer, Mike Davis.
Defensively, Stanford boasts
goalie Pete Gadd, a key factor in
last week's tournament victories.
Gadd is also expected to figure in
today's game with Cal, also a

contender for the Pacific 8 title,
and known to be a tough
offensive team.
Face Pomona
Saturday's contest against Cal
Poh will mark the first time
Stanford has met the Pomona
poloists. However, the Stanford
squad will be favored on the basis
of field depth provided by
returning lettermen Ken Hammer,
Dan Powlison, Stu Rowe, Rill
Simpkins, Bob Warren, Handy
Wilkins and Hob Wooley and
freshman Greg Loitz.

Fhe Berkeley game today
begins at 3:30 p.m. The Indians
