# Runners Compete At Sacramento
## 
### 
By MIKE CHASSON
The Stanford Cross Country
team in its last test before it opens
the Pacific Eight season against
UCLA and USC, travels to
Sacramento this Saturday for the
Sacramento State Invitational.
Coach Marshall Clark does not
expect his runners to win their
fourth straight Sacramento title
however. Clark is using this meet
as a tune-up for the Bruins and

Trojans the following weekend,
sending a squad that does not
include all his best runners.
Leading the Indians is senior
Duncan Macdonald, who is off to
an excellent start. Macdonald,
who was slowed during the last
track season due to illness, wishes
to make his last season for
Stanford a great one. He clipped
17 seconds off his previous best
on the Stanford course in the
competitive time trial against West

Valley Track Club last weekend.
Lahde Improved
Close on the heels of
Macdonald is senior Bernie Lahde,
who ran well against West Valley,
taking 42 seconds off his previous
best on the Stanford course to
finish 3 seconds behind
Macdonald.
Freshman Kurt Schoenrock is a
bright prospect for the future,
having placed among Stanford's
top seven ru liners for this
weekend's meet. Joining these
three runners at Sacramento are
senior Dave Whiteing, junior Brian
Mittelstaed and junior Decker
Underwood who hopes to regain
the form he exhibited as a
freshman, and freshman Mark
McConnell.
Kretz Held Out
Clark is holding out one of his
best runners from last year, Arvid
Kretz, who is still rounding into
shape. Kretz is expected to be at

full strength for UCLA and USC.
With Stanford considering this
meet just a tune-up, Clark looks
for Cat State Kullerton, which is
in fine early season shape and the
winner of the Long Beach State
Invitational last weekend, to win
at Sacramento. Also expected to
be tough arc San Diego State,
West Valley Track Club, and San
Jose State.
Evaluation
In evaluating this year's team.
Clark believes that although it is
not as strong overall as previous
squads, the frontline runners are
very strong. With everyone at full
strength Stanford should do well,
though Washington State and
Oregon are still the powerhouses
in the Pacific Eight. No squad in
the Pac-8 can realistically expect
to defeat these two teams who are
expected to dominate national
competition as well. The battle
for piacings behind the Cougars
and Ducks is wide-open, however.

Sacramento State Invitational.
Coach Marshall Clark does not
expect his runners to win their
fourth straight Sacramento title
however. Clark is using this meet
as a tune-up for the Bruins and

Trojans the following weekend,
sending a squad that does not
include all his best runners.
Leading the Indians is senior
Duncan Macdonald, who is off to
an excellent start. Macdonald,
who was slowed during the last
track season due to illness, wishes
to make his last season for
Stanford a great one. He clipped
17 seconds off his previous best
on the Stanford course in the
competitive time trial against West

Valley Track Club last weekend.
Lahde Improved
Close on the heels of
Macdonald is senior Bernie Lahde,
who ran well against West Valley,
taking 42 seconds off his previous
best on the Stanford course to
finish 3 seconds behind
Macdonald.
Freshman Kurt Schoenrock is a
bright prospect for the future,
having placed among Stanford's
top seven ru liners for this
weekend's meet. Joining these
three runners at Sacramento are
senior Dave Whiteing, junior Brian
Mittelstaed and junior Decker
Underwood who hopes to regain
the form he exhibited as a
freshman, and freshman Mark
McConnell.
Kretz Held Out
Clark is holding out one of his
best runners from last year, Arvid
Kretz, who is still rounding into
shape. Kretz is expected to be at

full strength for UCLA and USC.
With Stanford considering this
meet just a tune-up, Clark looks
for Cat State Kullerton, which is
in fine early season shape and the
winner of the Long Beach State
Invitational last weekend, to win
at Sacramento. Also expected to
be tough arc San Diego State,
West Valley Track Club, and San
Jose State.
Evaluation
In evaluating this year's team.
Clark believes that although it is
not as strong overall as previous
squads, the frontline runners are
very strong. With everyone at full
strength Stanford should do well,
though Washington State and
Oregon are still the powerhouses
in the Pacific Eight. No squad in
the Pac-8 can realistically expect
to defeat these two teams who are
expected to dominate national
competition as well. The battle
for piacings behind the Cougars
and Ducks is wide-open, however.
