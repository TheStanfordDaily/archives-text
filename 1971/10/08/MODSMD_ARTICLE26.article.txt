# Indians Challenge Sixkiller
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
When Stanford finally won
that long elusive Rose Bowl bid
with a 29-22 win over Washington
last November, a lot of people left
Stanford Stadium talking about
something other than the final
score. They left talking about a
small sophomore Washington
quarterback who had come off
the bench and led the Huskies to
their second and third
touchdowns.
Sonny Sixkiller's statistics
weren't that impressive that
day—lB of 41 for 158 yards. But
although he had reportedly been
sick the week before the game,
Sixkiller still played and showed a
lot of potential. I'm sure that
some eager Husky fans were
already prematurely comparing
him to the Heisman Trophy
winner he opposed that day and
were saying "Just wait a year."
That year has gone by and now
Sixkiller gets his chance against
the Indians again. In his first four
games this season he has
completed 5 4 of 106 passes for
94 9 yards and eight touchdowns,
as Washington has won its first
four games easily. The Huskies
have averaged almost 4 5 points a
game in beating UC-Santa

Barbara, Purdue, Texas Christian
and Illinois.
Stanford coach John Ralston
admits that stopping Sixkiller has
to be the Indians number one goal
tomorrow. It won't be easy.
Ralston says he is quite impressed
with two of the Huskies' ends,
Jim Krieg and Tom Scott who he
compared to Randy Vataha.
Washington's defense isn't very
weak either. In league statistics,
they are second behind Stanford
in team defense, allowing an
average of only 237 yards per
game. A big question on Saturday,
however, will be the effectiveness
of defensive back Calvin Jones
who has been slowed with a
hamstring injury. When healthy,
Jones is one of the best defensive
backs on the coast.
But if any defense will stop
Sixkiller, Stanford's will be it. The
Indian defense has given up only
one touchdown in four games.
Last week in the loss to Duke, no
one could fault that defense. They
played a fine game.
But as Ralston said after the
Duke game, you have to put
points on the board to win.
Stanford's offense showed a lot of
explosiveness in their first three
games. But then the Duke game

happened. To win tomorrow, the
Stanford offense must regain the
ability to make the big play,
which they didn't have last
Saturday.
Stanford's offense will be
operating without starting
fullback Hillary Shockley and
wide receiver Eric Cross, both of
whom will miss the trip with
injuries, as will linebacker Mike
Simone.
A lot rides on tomorrow's
game. A big edge in the
conference race and a lot of
momentum are the primary
objects. But regaining national
ranking and ending claims that
Stanford's first three wins were
meaningless also are important to
the Indians.
A sellout crowd will fill
Washington's Stadium tomorrow
afternoon. Some U of W students
couldn't even buy tickets and will
have to watch on closed-circuit
TV which will be patched off the
telecast coming back here to
Maples Pavjlion. Tickets at $3 for

the general public and $2.50 lor
students will still be available
tomorrow at the Pavillion.
Kickoff is 1 :30 p.m.

CAN THIS MAN BE BEA TEN AGAIN?—Last year, the Indians managed to beat Sonny Sixkiller and his
cohorts. Sixkiller is shown above having one of his passes blocked and in the picture below he is being
chased out of the pocket. The story may be different this year, but the Indian defensive unit hopes to give
Sixkiller some of t le problems they beset him with last year.
