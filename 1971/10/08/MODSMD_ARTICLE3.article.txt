### EMMA PRICE 
The newly-founded Stanford
Women's Center last night held its first
meeting of the year. About 25 0 women
and a sprinkling of men attended the
flpot-luck picnic on the I-Center lawn.
The event had several purposes,
according to Janie Turner, co-ordinator
of the Center. "First, several very brief
talks by members of women's groups
were given so that women could find
out what is going on at Stanford," she
explained. "In addition, groups were on
hand with literature."
The speeches, all emphasized that
the Center exists to serve all women of
the community. Several women from
off-campus groups, such as the Problem
Pregnancy Information Center and the
Committee to Defend the Right to Live
(a woman's anti-war group), also spoke.
"The most important function of
the dinner, was for women to come
together and talk and eat food,"
according to Turner.
"There are many women who are
sympathetic to the movement but who
have found no means to participate. We
hope they came," she added.
This welcoming attitude is echoed
by Cora Lee Mack, Director of the
Stanford YWCA, which is funding the
Center. "We want all women from
freshmen to staff members to faculty
wives to residents of the community,"
she said.
So far the response is good, Sharon
Winslow, sponsor in a freshman dorm,
reported. "When I first talked to the
freshmen about the Women's Center I
got some negative responses. However,
once I showed them the brochure thev

got very enthusiastic and wanted to
take courses."
One problem in reaching women,
according to Mack, is that many older
women assume that the Center is run
by and for students. "We are very
interested in getting women of all ages
involved," Mack emphasized.
At the moment the Center is
primarily co-ordinating women projects
focusing on child care, discrimination
at Stanford, abortion, work with the
media, visiting women prisoners,
changing the "ratio," and instituting
women's studies programs.
The women working with the Center
all emphasize the contrast they see
between their movement and
male-dominated movements.
"Right now we're working on the
principle that everyone helps with both
the leadership decisions and with the
typing. We want the decisions of the
Center to be based on groundswells of
feeling rather than on a hierarchy
which works from the top down,"
Turner said.
The Center encourages men to
participate in certain activities. All of
the classes except self-defense are open
to men, but priority is given to women.
Men do not, however, participate in
any of the leadership aspects of the
Center.
The courses to be offered by the
Center are: Home Repair, Self-Defense,
Medical Problems of Women, Bread
Baking, Basic Auto Care and Repair,
Ix'gal Rights of Women, Self-Awareness
Through Literature, and an Inter-Racial
Discussion Group.

Baking, Basic Auto Care and Repair,
Ix'gal Rights of Women, Self-Awareness
Through Literature, and an Inter-Racial
Discussion Group.
The newly-founded Stanford
Women's Center last night held its first
meeting of the year. About 25 0 women
and a sprinkling of men attended the
flpot-luck picnic on the I-Center lawn.
The event had several purposes,
according to Janie Turner, co-ordinator
of the Center. "First, several very brief
talks by members of women's groups
were given so that women could find
out what is going on at Stanford," she
explained. "In addition, groups were on
hand with literature."
The speeches, all emphasized that
the Center exists to serve all women of
the community. Several women from
off-campus groups, such as the Problem
Pregnancy Information Center and the
Committee to Defend the Right to Live
(a woman's anti-war group), also spoke.
"The most important function of
the dinner, was for women to come
together and talk and eat food,"
according to Turner.
"There are many women who are
sympathetic to the movement but who
have found no means to participate. We
hope they came," she added.
This welcoming attitude is echoed
by Cora Lee Mack, Director of the
Stanford YWCA, which is funding the
Center. "We want all women from
freshmen to staff members to faculty
wives to residents of the community,"
she said.
So far the response is good, Sharon
Winslow, sponsor in a freshman dorm,
reported. "When I first talked to the
freshmen about the Women's Center I
got some negative responses. However,
once I showed them the brochure thev

got very enthusiastic and wanted to
take courses."
One problem in reaching women,
according to Mack, is that many older
women assume that the Center is run
by and for students. "We are very
interested in getting women of all ages
involved," Mack emphasized.
At the moment the Center is
primarily co-ordinating women projects
focusing on child care, discrimination
at Stanford, abortion, work with the
media, visiting women prisoners,
changing the "ratio," and instituting
women's studies programs.
The women working with the Center
all emphasize the contrast they see
between their movement and
male-dominated movements.
"Right now we're working on the
principle that everyone helps with both
the leadership decisions and with the
typing. We want the decisions of the
Center to be based on groundswells of
feeling rather than on a hierarchy
which works from the top down,"
Turner said.
The Center encourages men to
participate in certain activities. All of
the classes except self-defense are open
to men, but priority is given to women.
Men do not, however, participate in
any of the leadership aspects of the
Center.
The courses to be offered by the
Center are: Home Repair, Self-Defense,
Medical Problems of Women, Bread
Baking, Basic Auto Care and Repair,
Ix'gal Rights of Women, Self-Awareness
Through Literature, and an Inter-Racial
Discussion Group.
