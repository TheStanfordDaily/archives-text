# Keilch Raps Hearing As Farce In Remarks
## 
### BOB BACON 
John Keilch, fired Stanford library
worker seeking to win back his job in a
University grievance procedure,
denounced in his closing arguments
yesterday the three-man committee
hearing his case.
Keilch was fired for "unacceptable
behavior" after being arrested in the
April 8 and 9 Stanford hospital sit-in.
He claims that "unacceptable behavior"
is overly vague and, furthermore, the
sit-in was justified as a response to
"institutional racism" at the hospital.
His case will now be decided by a
three-man committee chaired by
Elwood Pierce, Assistant Controller of
the Medical School. Testimony has
been taken at eight sessions since
August 19.
Pierce also heads the committee
which is currently deliberating the case
of Devera Satisky, a law school
employee fired under similar
circumstances.
In his 4 5-minute closing statement,
Keilch branded the grievance procedure
"a farce; there's a verdict first and then
the trial." He accused committee
member Byron Sher, Professor of Law,of
having his mind made up against Keilch
before the hearings began. Sher
vigorously denied the charge.
Prior to Keilch's closing statement,
Kenneth Dunkle, personnel officer of
the Stanford Hospital, testified as to his
view of events during the sit-in, and to
hospital personnel policy.

The university administration,
represented by Associate Staff Counsel
Daryl Dawson, made no closing
argument.
He stated that in contrast to
University personnel chief Robert M.
Nelson (who fired Keilch), he (Dunkle)
conducted no investigation of hospital
employees participating in the sit-in
"because I knew of none." But, under
questioning, he said that "If 1 had
understood that there were employees
there, 1 would have tried to find out
the circumstances." Keilch insisted that
there had been hospital employees
present.
In his closing remarks, the fired
library employee repeated his charge
that the University Administration was
guilty of "unacceptable behavior" for
"perpetrating institutional racism." He
added the charges that administrators
were "arrogant, concerned with power
for its own sake, and reactionary."
Keilch had sought to subpoena
several administrators, including
President Richard Lyman and Provost
William Miller, to question them
regarding the decisions to end the sit-in
and to fire him. They all refused to
appear.
Keilch told the committee that if
the sit-in and firings had taken place in
Alabama in 1961, it was his opinion
that "law professors and university
presidents" would have been outraged
and would have backed the fired
workers.
