# Franklin Defense Names White Author Of Threatening Letters
## 
### BOB LITTERMAN 
University witness . Raymond R.
White, former Chairman of the Free
Campus Movement (FCM), was accused
during cross-examination in the
Franklin Advisory Board hearing
yesterday of having written a
threatening letter and two anonymous
leaflets.
White denied having written the
letter, but refused to answer when
asked if hehad produced the leaflets.
The unusual evidence, introduced in
a surprise move by Franklin counsel
Yale Braunstein, included a threatening
letter to former Stanford graduate
student Tom Forstenzer, a leaflet
entitled "Black Rage from Honkies?" a
leaflet entitled "More Facts On The
Hospital Five," and several samples of
handwriting, handprinting and
typewriting that White identified as his
own.
Also introduced was a "Document
Report Concerning Raymond R.
White," signed by "Sherwood Morrill,
Examiner of Questioned Documents"
which identified the letter and both
leaflets as having been "definitely"
produced by Ray White.
Morrill, who has worked for the
state in the Zodiac, Angela Davis, and
George Jackson cases, last night
confirmed that he had done the
analysis.
The threatening letter was stuffed in
the mailbox of Forstenzer, a former
chairman of the LASSU under Davis
Harris, on April 1 2 , 1 970. Two days
earlier he had made a speech at an
anti-ROTC rally in White Plaza.
The letter said, "My dear Tom
Forstenzer: Perhaps you should know
(as an open advocate of terrorism) that
I (or we) possess knowledge of your
home address." It was signed "Local
latent rednecksâ€”P.S. cool it."
White, a biology graduate student,
has testified against several radicals in
the past, including Diarmuid Maguire
who was subsequently sent to jail.
Released on probation, Maguire was
sent back to jail when a letter he sent
to the Daily identified White as a
"snitch," and later stated "Take care of
snitches."
Contacted last night, White again
stated that he did not write the
Forstenzer letter, and further claimed
that he was "framed." White also
alleged that at least two of the
documents which he admitted having
written may have been obtained
illegally.
"I doubt that they could legally take
the check request from the ASSU files,
and secondly I know the Free
University catalogue |both of which

included a sample of White's printing]
was just flat stolen from the coffee
table in the biology department
lounge."
As to Morrill's letter, White said,
"Their handwriting expert will
probably come to any conclusion that
the people who pay him want him to."
White explained his refusing to
answer questions about his having
produced the leaflet on the grounds
that he is afraid of violence such as the
firebombing of the FCM headquarters
which occurred this summer.
At that time, in an interview with
the Daily White did deny having
written the leaflets saying "but I
wouldn't admit it if I had written
them." He mentioned the same fears of
violence then, also.
Braunstein, who collected much of
the data, admitted that he had been
working on the case for some time
before the Franklin hearing. He said he
was first aroused by the Forstenzer
letter, and then "I was dumbfounded
when I started seeing leaflets in the
same handwriting."
Braunstein said he has gone to the
Dean of Student's office twice with the
evidence, "and both times they said
they would look into it." Later he
After the appearance of the "More
Facts," leaflet, Devera Satisky, a
Venceremos member mentioned in the
document considered suing White for
libel and sent the documents to the
Lipset Agency, a well known private
detective firm in San Francisco, for
verification.
Lipset sent the documents on to
Morrill, who concluded, "The
handwritten letter addressed to Tom
Forstenzer is definitely in the
handwriting of Ray White as it appears
on the Stanford University Associated
Students Check Request, the Affidavit
and the postcard addressed to Mr.
Sullivan." (Other documents White
admits having written.)
"The typewriting appearing on the
leaflet entitled More Facts on the
Hospital Five is from the same
typewriter which prepared the two
sheets of paper attached to page 3 of
the Midpeninsula Free University
booklet.
"The handprinting on the
photocopy of the leaflet entitled Black
Rage from Honkies is also definitely
that of Ray White when compared with
the handprinting appearing on the
Stanford University Associated
Students Check Request Number,
Registration of Voluntary
Organizations and on the face of the
Midpeninsula Free University Booklet."

According to Law Professor Jack
Friedenthal, for such evidence to be
admitted and considered in a court of
law "you do not need a tour-de-force
proof that makes it beyond a
reasonable doubt. All you need is some
evidence that a reasonable man could
find it genuine on that evidence alone."
Although Friedenthal suggested that
usually an expert must appear in person
to testify, last night Franklin reported
to the Daily that he has been
negotiating with University counsel
Raymond Fischer, who may be willing
to stipulate to the authenticity of
Morrill's letter in return for Franklin's
accepting an unrelated University
document.
