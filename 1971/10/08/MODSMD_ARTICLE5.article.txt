# New Study Criticizes Tresidder Operations
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
A report highly critical of many
aspects of the operation of Tresidder
Memorial Union was released last week
by the University Internal Audit Office.
The 95-page report, authored by
Carl Hitchm'r, a CPA and second-year
law student at Notre Dame, was
prepared at the request of Union
Director Forrest Tregea after the ASSU
Senate released a stinging report calling
for his dismissal.
Tregea, while cautioning that he had
not had time to fully digest the
Hitchner Report, commented that he
felt the report contains "many
excellent, constructive
recommendations."
Tregea has been the center of
growing controversy since the bitter
ASSU report, authored by Sen. Scott
Burke, which charged that "Tresidder is
suffering from a disease .. . inept
management."
The Hitchner Report contains
recommendations for improvement of
virtually all Tresidder functions
centering on the food service, coffee
house, retail store, and administrative
operations.
The Union is currently administered
by Director Tregea, who is directly
answerable to the Committee on

Tresidder Union. This committee is in
turn responsible to the University
administration for its actions.
The report advocates scrapping the
operational committee, which currently
is composed of half students and half
non-students, and replacing it with an
advisory board of a similar make-up.
Tregea would then be directly under
University control.
Scott Burke, author of the ASSU
report, said that although dissolution of
the current board would eliminate any
direct student control over the Union,
it would have a beneficial effect
because "they (Tregea and Business
Manager Philip Duffy) would be
directly accountable to the University
administration, and would no longer be
able to act like little dictators. It would
put the pressure on them."
'Rubber Stamp'
Burke said that under the current
system, although the committee
theoretically holds power over Tregea,
they more often than not serve as "a
rubber stamp" for him.
Tregea said of the plan, "I wouldn't
have an opinion on that. It's something
that the board will have to study and
decide for itself."
The food service, according to
Hitchner, is the key for returning
Tresidder to what he terms "a
respectable financial base."
He cited the fact that while tastes
have changed considerably over the
past few years, the food service menu
has been on the same five-week cycle
for the past six years. Also, it had been
the practice to serve the same hot dish
at both lunch and dinner, thus
discouraging students from eating two
meals at the cafeteria on the same day.
However, under new Food Service
Director Lee Schafer, a substantial
number of the recommendations have
already been adopted, including
updating and variation of the menu.
Inventory Reduction
The retail store also came under
attack for its poor utilization of space
and its lack of merchandising
techniques.
Suggested for a long-range plan was
the possibility of building an
on-campus late-night food store. This
would fulfill the dual purposes of
providing a convenient place for
students with their own kitchens, and
of freeing more space in the retail store.
