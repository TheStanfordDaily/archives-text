# New Study Criticizes Tresidder Operations
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
A report highly critical of many
aspects of the operation of Tresidder
Memorial Union was released last week
by the University Internal Audit Office.
The 95-page report, authored by
Carl Hitchm'r, a CPA and second-year
law student at Notre Dame, was
prepared at the request of Union
Director Forrest Tregea after the ASSU
Senate released a stinging report calling
for his dismissal.
Tregea, while cautioning that he had
not had time to fully digest the
Hitchner Report, commented that he
felt the report contains "many
excellent, constructive
recommendations."
Tregea has been the center of
growing controversy since the bitter
ASSU report, authored by Sen. Scott
Burke, which charged that "Tresidder is
suffering from a disease .. . inept
management."
The Hitchner Report contains
recommendations for improvement of
virtually all Tresidder functions
centering on the food service, coffee
house, retail store, and administrative
operations.
The Union is currently administered
by Director Tregea, who is directly
answerable to the Committee on

Tresidder Union. This committee is in
turn responsible to the University
administration for its actions.
The report advocates scrapping the
operational committee, which currently
is composed of half students and half
non-students, and replacing it with an
advisory board of a similar make-up.
Tregea would then be directly under
University control.
Scott Burke, author of the ASSU
report, said that although dissolution of
the current board would eliminate any
direct student control over the Union,
it would have a beneficial effect
because "they (Tregea and Business
Manager Philip Duffy) would be
directly accountable to the University
administration, and would no longer be
able to act like little dictators. It would
put the pressure on them."
'Rubber Stamp'
Burke said that under the current
system, although the committee
theoretically holds power over Tregea,
they more often than not serve as "a
rubber stamp" for him.
Tregea said of the plan, "I wouldn't
have an opinion on that. It's something
that the board will have to study and
decide for itself."
The food service, according to
Hitchner, is the key for returning
Tresidder to what he terms "a
respectable financial base."
He cited the fact that while tastes
have changed considerably over the
past few years, the food service menu
has been on the same five-week cycle
for the past six years. Also, it had been
the practice to serve the same hot dish
at both lunch and dinner, thus
discouraging students from eating two
meals at the cafeteria on the same day.
However, under new Food Service
Director Lee Schafer, a substantial
number of the recommendations have
already been adopted, including
updating and variation of the menu.
Inventory Reduction
The retail store also came under
attack for its poor utilization of space
and its lack of merchandising
techniques.
Suggested for a long-range plan was
the possibility of building an
on-campus late-night food store. This
would fulfill the dual purposes of
providing a convenient place for
students with their own kitchens, and
of freeing more space in the retail store.
The Coffee House came in for both
praise and criticims. It was lauded for
filling "a contemporary need in the
Stanford community," but was scored
for numerous unfair employment
practices.
For instance, under the current
system, two payrolls are required, one
for student employees and one for
non-students. Non-student employees
are actually better off, because they are
considered regular rather than part-time
employees. Thus, they are paid at a
higher rate than students who are
performing exactly the same tasks.
Tregea promised that the salary
situation would be equalized.
Hitchner also scored the existence of
nepotism in the Coffee House, citing
the case of Mrs. Raphael Henao, wife of
the Coffee House manager, who was
employed as a sandwich maker.
Tregea's Future
Looming over the Hitchner Report,
although not explicitly mentioned, is
the fate of the often-embattled Tregea
himself.
No stranger to student displeasure
with his work, Tregea formerly headed
the student union at UC Berkeley. In
1968, after a long-standing dispute with
his legal employer, the ASSU Senate,
anti-Tregea forces failed by just one
vote to muster the necessary
three-fourths majority to oust him. Ten
days later, it was announced that he
had resigned to come to Stanford.

The difference in the Stanford and
Berkeley situations, of course, is that at
UC the union is owned and operated by
the Associated Students, while at
Stanford, Tregea is officially employed
by the University administration.
Nevertheless, student criticism of
Tregea's administrative reign has been
vocal.
Improvement
Burke, perhaps Tregea's most severe
critic, while admitting that Tresidder
has been improved since the ASSU and
Hitchner Reports, attributed the
improvement to the new Food Service
Director rather than to Tregea.
"The fact that he (Tregea) didn't do
a thing until we put the pressure on is
proof that he is unfit to hold his
position."
"He's got to act on these programs,
and frankly, I think he's incapable of
doing it."
Burke cited one particular passage
from the Hitchner Report, which he
said was "clearly directed at Tregea and
Duffy."
The passage says that a "positive
management attitude" will be needed
to implement the recommendations of
the report, and that, this will
"necessitate a reversal of philosophy
for some individuals. Those who cannot
or will not adapt to these conditions
should be removed from the
organization.
"If he (Tregea) does make these
changes, I'd be in favor of not only
keeping him here, but giving him a raise
in salary," said Burke. "But I don't
think he can, and I don't think he
will."
