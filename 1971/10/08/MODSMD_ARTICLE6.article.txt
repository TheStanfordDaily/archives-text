# Faculty Members Debate Nuremberg War Principles
## 
### KATHY WEINBERGER 
The Nuremberg Principles and
aspects of Stanford's complicity in the
war were subjects of a faculty debate
last night in Cubberley Auditorium.
Halsted Holman, professor of
medicine, and Pierre Noyes of SLAC
argued against Professor of Law John
Barton and Vice Provost Robert
Rosenzweig before an audience of
nearly 100.
In Holman's opening statement, he
said, "The Nuremberg Principles are
established law and supersede local and
national law. If the local or national
government violates the Nuremberg
Principles, and if a person acts against
the local or national government,
within the Principles of Nuremberg,
then the Nuremberg Principles act as a
shield for the individual
"The University doesn't have a right
to establish more restrictive codes of
personal behavior than we already have
as citizens of a community," he added.
Barton insisted that the Nuremberg
Principles don't provide a defense in
this issue. He pointed out that Principle
VII defines complicity as a crime under
international law. "Does sitting,
listening to Henry Cabot Lodge, and
not disrupting him mean
complicity? . . . Does passivity make a
person an accomplice?" he asked.
Noyes said he views the current
situation as "comparable to the
Germans at the end of the war when
they realized their government had
been committing genocide. Only we
have added a new crime of ecocide to
the genocide."

"The proper limit of our
involvement with the war and the
military is no involvement at all," he
added.
Rosenzweig disagreed. "The
University is definitely involved in the
war—on both sides. How could it be
otherwise? The University is in the
middle of the activity," he said. He
explained that the University is large,
with a faculty of over 1000, organized
in various schools and departments.
"The schools and departments are
largely autonomous, and it is no
accident," he added.
Geraldine Foote, participating fro 1 :)
the audience, asked, "If the
departments are too autonomous for
Administrative control, why did the
Administration fire people in five
departments over the summer,
neglecting the wishes of thfc
departments?" She pointed out a clas:,
distinction—that workers don't have
the same rights as faculty.
Rosenzweig explained that students,
faculty and staff have different
positions in the University. "I don't
know what to do about it. It's a fact,"
he said.
Other audience discussion included a
question from ASSU Council of
Presidents member Diane Fields about
William Shockley, Professor of
Engineering Sciences; "Shockley has
suggested offering a $1 000 bonus to
welfare people who will be sterilized.
Why doesn't he get slapped like
Franklin? His ideas could lead to a race
war in the U.S."

middle of the activity," he said. He
explained that the University is large,
with a faculty of over 1000, organized
in various schools and departments.
"The schools and departments are
largely autonomous, and it is no
accident," he added.
Geraldine Foote, participating fro 1 :)
the audience, asked, "If the
departments are too autonomous for
Administrative control, why did the
Administration fire people in five
departments over the summer,
neglecting the wishes of thfc
departments?" She pointed out a clas:,
distinction—that workers don't have
the same rights as faculty.
Rosenzweig explained that students,
faculty and staff have different
positions in the University. "I don't
know what to do about it. It's a fact,"
he said.
Other audience discussion included a
question from ASSU Council of
Presidents member Diane Fields about
William Shockley, Professor of
Engineering Sciences; "Shockley has
suggested offering a $1 000 bonus to
welfare people who will be sterilized.
Why doesn't he get slapped like
Franklin? His ideas could lead to a race
war in the U.S."
The Nuremberg Principles and
aspects of Stanford's complicity in the
war were subjects of a faculty debate
last night in Cubberley Auditorium.
Halsted Holman, professor of
medicine, and Pierre Noyes of SLAC
argued against Professor of Law John
Barton and Vice Provost Robert
Rosenzweig before an audience of
nearly 100.
In Holman's opening statement, he
said, "The Nuremberg Principles are
established law and supersede local and
national law. If the local or national
government violates the Nuremberg
Principles, and if a person acts against
the local or national government,
within the Principles of Nuremberg,
then the Nuremberg Principles act as a
shield for the individual
"The University doesn't have a right
to establish more restrictive codes of
personal behavior than we already have
as citizens of a community," he added.
Barton insisted that the Nuremberg
Principles don't provide a defense in
this issue. He pointed out that Principle
VII defines complicity as a crime under
international law. "Does sitting,
listening to Henry Cabot Lodge, and
not disrupting him mean
complicity? . . . Does passivity make a
person an accomplice?" he asked.
Noyes said he views the current
situation as "comparable to the
Germans at the end of the war when
they realized their government had
been committing genocide. Only we
have added a new crime of ecocide to
the genocide."

"The proper limit of our
involvement with the war and the
military is no involvement at all," he
added.
Rosenzweig disagreed. "The
University is definitely involved in the
war—on both sides. How could it be
otherwise? The University is in the
middle of the activity," he said. He
explained that the University is large,
with a faculty of over 1000, organized
in various schools and departments.
"The schools and departments are
