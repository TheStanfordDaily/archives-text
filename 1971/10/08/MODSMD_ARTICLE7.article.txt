## China And Nuremberg 
### 
On Oct. 5 the Daily printed
two different articles which I feel
should not go by without
comment. First there is the article
on Red China by Molly Coye.
During her general ramble through
recent Chinese history she gives
the distinct impression that a
heroic people have finally broken
into a new dawn of peace and
enlightenment. She then goes on
to urge a warm and lasting
friendship between China and the
people of the United States.
It is in her omissions rather
than the distorted history given
that she is found most lacking.
Why aren't we told of the
conquest of Tibet and the
genocide of her people? Why is
there no mention of the great
agricultural purges? And how can
we ignore the fine Chairman Mao
who might seem to resemble
Hitler or Stalin but in his
pervasiveness is revealed to be no

other than Big Brother himself?
While a China under Chiang
Kai-Shek would have been
inreality a very corrupt and
generally oppressive government I
can see no reason to therefore
accept the China of Mao. Where
all freedom and individuality are
treated as "counter-productive"
concepts such as "free will" and
"abstract justice" lose all value. I
will not say that Red China is not
efficient. Yes it can feed its
people and clean the streets of
Shanghai but is this worth the
demise of individuality?
The two articles by Mr.
Holman on"Nuremberg, Free
Speech and the Lodge Incident"
are interesting because the whole
argument is based on the premise
that two wrongs make one right.
With effort I will restrict myself
to two points:
l)Both Holman and Franklin
assume Lodge to be a war
criminal. Quite obviously Lodge

has yet to be brought to trial. But
1 would like to dispute the
assumption that his guilt is so
obvious.
To think of Lodge as a
consciously evil and wicked being
is a jaunt into the realms of
paranoia that Joe McCarthy
visited, except with
"communists" being replaced by
anyone involved in the decisions
on Vietnam. This can be seen in
the witch hunt now in progress
whose aim is to remove one such
unfortunate from his job as editor
of the Foreign Affairs Quarterly
only because he helped decide
American policy in Vietnam. I can
see the televised trials already.
2)But what if these men really
are absolute evil incarnate? What
if they planned the whole thing
just so Calley could kill babies?
What would you do if some
German said to you "once I yelled
at Hitler?" This is not the action
of someore faced with a great
injustice. If I felt these men to be
the successors of Hitler my
conscience would not be salved by
shouting.
1 can't help feeling that men
like Franklin are playing out some
game which might at times
blunder into the real world but
usually stays safe behind its own
interpretation of who is "Good"
and who is "Bad." Just maybe
most people are both, and as
people do they might lose sight of
what is really right in a confusion
of motives and decisions. Perhaps
this is what happened to Lodge.
Perhaps it has happened to his
detractors as well.
