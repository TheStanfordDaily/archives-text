# Vietnam Election & Peace Proposal
## 
### DRU CORWELL KATHERINE BARKLEY 
You think the war is winding down? Well, it isn't. Nixon has
dropped more bombs in South Vietnam since he took over than
Johnson dropped in four years over all of Indochina. And there are no
plans to stop. In fact, Nixon has continued to support Thieu's
illegitimate regime, and has avoided responding to the new peace
proposal which clearly answers what he had said before were his terms
for settlement.
Over the past year Nixon has used the POW issue to justify his
refusal to set a date for total U.S. withdrawal from South Vietnam.
He has continually stated that as long as release of POW's is in doubt,
he cannot jeopardize his bargaining position by setting a final date for
withdrawal. As long as POW's remained, American troops would
remain.
The new peace proposal of the Provisional Revolutionary
Government of South Vietnam settles this problem. On July 1,
Madame Binh, chief negotiator for the PRG, introduced at Paris the
new seven point proposal. It answers all Nixon's stated objections to
previous proposals. The First Point provides for a phased withdrawal
ot all U.S. and foreign troops, equipment and supplies at a rate
commensurate with the return of all POW's held in both north and
south. It states unambiguously: "The two operations will start on the
same date and be completed on the same date." Insuring return of all
POW's, it also insures troop safety by proposing a cease-fire between
the National Liberation Front forces and the withdrawing American
military.
Offering a plan that meets Nixon's professed terms for peace, the
Vietnamese once again have demonstrated their sincere desire to
negotiate a just peace. Stressing that the plan is not a "take it or leave
it" proposition, they have stated that Point One can be settled
separately, before the other six are agreed upon. They have even
indicated the possibility of moving the original withdrawal
deadline—Dec. 31st—to mid-year 1972.
While the world waited for Washington's response to the new
breakthrough at the peace talks, the White House was silent.
Meanwhile, Ambassador Bruce "mysteriously" left Paris immediately
after conferring with Kissinger who stopped over on his way home
from Peking and Saigon. Soon after, Washington announced that
Bruce had resigned for "health reasons," although at that time he
denied these reports to American journalists. Nevertheless, 2 weeks
later Nixon had Bruce's written resignation—for reasons of health.
Rumors reported in the Paris press were that there had been a row
between Kissinger and Bruce. Piecing together the stories, it seems
that the Ambassador had insisted that the new peace plan should be
seriously considered since it satisfied the two essential points of POW
release and security of withdrawing troops. But Kissinger and Nixon
would have none of it.
When Bruce was precipitously removed, Phillip Habib, a
third-ranking CIA representative, who has no power to negotiate, was

left in charge. When the North Vietnamese agreed to enter into private
talks, Washington did not respond. In September, the new U.S.
negotiator, William Porter, finally arrived in Paris. The appointment of
Porter, a former head of pacification programs and psychological
warfare expert, indicates an implicit rejection of all Vietnamese peace
overtures. Recently, when the Vietnamese insisted on an answer to
the terms of their proposal, he answered: "You are, in fact, farther
from military victory than ever. In such circumstances, your use of
peremptory language seems rather pretentions." [Chronicle]
Although there has been no official response to the PRG peace
plan, Nixon's answer is already clear. He has ignored the increasing
flexibility of the Vietnamese liberation forces, refusing any open
discussion of their proposal. Instead he has been using the talks as a
diplomatic ploy, rather than a serious arena for negotiations.
By stalling and maneuvering at Paris, by trying to shift the public's
hopes for peace fromParis to Peking, Nixon has been buying time for
his Vietnamization policy, hoping to insure American control of
Vietnam's affairs. President Theiu is the only Vietnamese who is able
to implement Washington's plans.
But in Vietnam, Thieu is unpopular. He is known throughout as
the latest in a long line of Japanese, French, and American puppets.

refusal to set a date for total U.S. withdrawal from South Vietnam.
He has continually stated that as long as release of POW's is in doubt,
he cannot jeopardize his bargaining position by setting a final date for
withdrawal. As long as POW's remained, American troops would
remain.
The new peace proposal of the Provisional Revolutionary
Government of South Vietnam settles this problem. On July 1,
Madame Binh, chief negotiator for the PRG, introduced at Paris the
new seven point proposal. It answers all Nixon's stated objections to
previous proposals. The First Point provides for a phased withdrawal
ot all U.S. and foreign troops, equipment and supplies at a rate
commensurate with the return of all POW's held in both north and
south. It states unambiguously: "The two operations will start on the
same date and be completed on the same date." Insuring return of all
POW's, it also insures troop safety by proposing a cease-fire between
the National Liberation Front forces and the withdrawing American
military.
Offering a plan that meets Nixon's professed terms for peace, the
Vietnamese once again have demonstrated their sincere desire to
negotiate a just peace. Stressing that the plan is not a "take it or leave
it" proposition, they have stated that Point One can be settled
separately, before the other six are agreed upon. They have even
indicated the possibility of moving the original withdrawal
deadline—Dec. 31st—to mid-year 1972.
While the world waited for Washington's response to the new
breakthrough at the peace talks, the White House was silent.
Meanwhile, Ambassador Bruce "mysteriously" left Paris immediately
after conferring with Kissinger who stopped over on his way home
from Peking and Saigon. Soon after, Washington announced that
Bruce had resigned for "health reasons," although at that time he
denied these reports to American journalists. Nevertheless, 2 weeks
later Nixon had Bruce's written resignation—for reasons of health.
Rumors reported in the Paris press were that there had been a row
between Kissinger and Bruce. Piecing together the stories, it seems
that the Ambassador had insisted that the new peace plan should be
seriously considered since it satisfied the two essential points of POW
release and security of withdrawing troops. But Kissinger and Nixon
would have none of it.
When Bruce was precipitously removed, Phillip Habib, a
third-ranking CIA representative, who has no power to negotiate, was

left in charge. When the North Vietnamese agreed to enter into private
talks, Washington did not respond. In September, the new U.S.
negotiator, William Porter, finally arrived in Paris. The appointment of
Porter, a former head of pacification programs and psychological
warfare expert, indicates an implicit rejection of all Vietnamese peace
overtures. Recently, when the Vietnamese insisted on an answer to
the terms of their proposal, he answered: "You are, in fact, farther
from military victory than ever. In such circumstances, your use of
peremptory language seems rather pretentions." [Chronicle]
Although there has been no official response to the PRG peace
plan, Nixon's answer is already clear. He has ignored the increasing
flexibility of the Vietnamese liberation forces, refusing any open
discussion of their proposal. Instead he has been using the talks as a
diplomatic ploy, rather than a serious arena for negotiations.
By stalling and maneuvering at Paris, by trying to shift the public's
hopes for peace fromParis to Peking, Nixon has been buying time for
his Vietnamization policy, hoping to insure American control of
Vietnam's affairs. President Theiu is the only Vietnamese who is able
to implement Washington's plans.
But in Vietnam, Thieu is unpopular. He is known throughout as
the latest in a long line of Japanese, French, and American puppets.
You think the war is winding down? Well, it isn't. Nixon has
dropped more bombs in South Vietnam since he took over than
Johnson dropped in four years over all of Indochina. And there are no
plans to stop. In fact, Nixon has continued to support Thieu's
illegitimate regime, and has avoided responding to the new peace
proposal which clearly answers what he had said before were his terms
for settlement.
Over the past year Nixon has used the POW issue to justify his
refusal to set a date for total U.S. withdrawal from South Vietnam.
