# INDO-CHINA The War Winds On INDO-CHINA STUDY GROUP

Equally unpopular is his platform of the "Four No's" no neutrality,
no coalition government, no concession of any South Vietnamese
territory to the Communists, no Communist activity anywhere in
South Vietnam.
For the war-weary Vietnamese his election banner-"There is only
peace in victory"-suggests only more bombardment. Broad anti-war
and anti-government forces are widespread and rapidly growing among
the civilian population.
But Thieu's power lies, not in his popularity, but in his immense
administrative and military machinery that is cemented by his
patronage. Over the past 4 years he has maneuvered potential
opponents out of positions, replacing them with relatives or others
loyal to his American-funded handouts.
The pacification program—key to the success of
Vietnamization—depends on continued stability of Thieu's police
state. Any change at this crucial time would mean the collapse of
Vietnamization and force Nixon to a final showdown.
And Thieu is well aware of his indispensibility. Stating that he
would resign if the U.S. cut back aid, he cooled any chance of Nixon
pressuring him about his election machinations. As the New York
Times commented, "Nixon is no more indifferent to a South
Vietnamese collapse than Thieu is."
