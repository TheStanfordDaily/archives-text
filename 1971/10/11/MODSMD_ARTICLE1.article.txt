# Franklin To Begin Defense Today
## Will Move For Dismissal; May Call 226 Witnesses 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
Suspended English Professor H.
Bruce Franklin revealed yesterday that
he has 226 witnesses to testify "on the
facts alone," as he begins his defense
today against charges of misconduct as
a professor.
But the Marixst scholar has
indicated that he will initially seek to
have all the charges against him
dismissed.
"They haven't proven anything," he
said Friday, after the Administration
concluded its presentation of witnesses.
Administration Witnesses
The testimony of Administration
witnesses has ranged from events inside
the Computation Center, when it was
occupied on February 10, to false
alarms turned in that night.
Franklin told the Daily yesterday
that should his motions for dismissal be
denied he will attempt to get the Board
to limit the evidence it is considering in
connection with the charges against
him.
But should motions for limitation of
the evidence also be denied, Franklin
feels it will be necessary to call all 226
witnesses. In two weeks of hearings, the
Administration presented about 25
witnesses.
A noon rally has been scheduled in
White Plaza today in support of
Franklin's defense, which is being
called "People's Offense." Following
the rally the group plans to march with
flags to the hearing room.
At Friday's hearing the
Administration played tapes of the Old
Union rally on February 10 and a
Dinkelspiel meeting on February 9,
amid new charges by Franklin that
Administration evidence had been
"doctored."
Rally Tape
The charge came as the Advisory
Board listened to a tape of a KZSU
broadcast at the Old Union courtyard
rally the evening of the 10 th.
Franklin has been charged with
inciting violence in a speech at that
rally.
The Administration originally
wished to play a tape of the broadcast
made by a policeman, but Franklin
objected saying that his set of KZSU
tapes were more complete.
The KZSU tape was played,
revealing that a transcript of the police
tape omitted a major portion of the
rally.
'No Coincidence'
Franklin charged that "this was no
coincidence," since the part deleted
had provided the context for his
speech. Police had said that they were
changing reels.
Franklin argued that the KZSU tape
showed that the evening rally had
revolved around two proposals:
"whether to go on a mass militant
trashing march or to block a freeway,"
or "to go back to the dorms and rap all
night, as one girl suggested."
Franklin says that he was
encouraging the second proposal.
The Advisory Board also heard a
3-1 /2-hour tape of a meeting at
Dinkelspiel Auditorium on the evening
of February 9.
The meeting was to formulate a set

of demands and to plan protest action
over the invasion of Laos.
Administration Rests
Administration attorney Raymond
Fisher played the tape as background
to the events of the ]oth. Following
the tape, the Administration rested its
case.
Earlier in the afternoon, the last
Administration witness, Assistant Fire
Chief John Barr, told of eight false
alarms on campus the night of the
10 th.
Also at Friday's session, Fisher
announced that he would allow the
letter of handwriting expert Sherwood
Morrill to be introduced as hearsay. On
Thursday defense counsel Yale
Braunstcin had presented the Morril
communication, which identified the
handwriting of Administration witness
Raymond White as being the same as
that in a threat letter to an anti-war
activist.
There was no hearing Saturday
following the requests of both Franklin
and Fisher.
Chairman Mao
In asking for postponement of the
hearing until Monday Franklin told the
Advisory Board that he needed the
time to prepare his defense, and that
Chairman Mao tells us "Fight no battle
unprepared, fight no battle you are not
sure of winning; make every effort to
be well prepared for each battle."
Kennedy responded that Mao also
tells us that we need "an enthusiastic
but calm state of mind and intense
orderly work." There was applause and
laughter from the hearing room.
Kennedy later allowed the motion
for no hearing Saturday, but said that
he took a "dim view of it."
The hearing resumes today at 1 p.m.

POINT OF ORDER-Los Angeles lawyer Raymond Fisher has spent 54 hours
prosecuting Bruce Franklin over the past two weeks, and feels the Advisory Board
will rule in his favor when the hearing ends. The defense has other ideas.
