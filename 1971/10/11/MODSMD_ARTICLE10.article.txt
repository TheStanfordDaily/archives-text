## San Quentin Prisoners Indicted 
### 
Six inmates of the San Quentin
adjustment center have been
indicted for murder and
conspiracy along with attorney
Stephan Bingham involving the
deaths of three guards and two
inmates and the wounding of
three other guards on August
21st.
The six inmates, Fleeta
Drumgo (one of the Soledad
Brothers), Hugo Pinell, David
Johnson, John Larry Spain, Louis
Talamantes and Willie Tate are
accused of joining a conspiracy
between Bingham and George
Jackson. The conspiracy between
the men allegedly consists of a
ploy to escape by force and
violence and to specifically kidnap
guards and possess firearms. Each
of the six accused is specifically
accused of direct assault or
murder in connection with the
deaths of three guards, two
inmates, and the wounding of
three other guards.
It seems unlikely however, that
the 9 millimeter pistol George
Jackson allegedly had was ever
taken in. First, all inmates are
thoroughly searched before and
after each visit and secondly as to
the story that he hid it in a
wig—all inmates are required to
keep their hair a certain
length—very short—and a wig
would be quite noticeable. An
experiment was later done with a
wig and a similar pistol and the
pistol was found to protrude
visibly from the wig. Nevertheless
the indictments have been
obtained.
One member of the Grand Jury
that indicted the six resigned in
protest. Jerry Hawes, 30, of San
Rafael wrote in his letter of
resignation to Jury Foreman
Dempster, "The indictments of
the last few days have reinforced
my decision to resign. . .The
unwillingness of this jury to seek
impartial legal advice during
indicting sessions makes
impossible a fair and just
procedure which can mete out
genuine justice."
Another oT the jurors, 23 year
old Richard Beban walked out of
deliberations before the vote was
taken. "I was disgusted," Beban
announced. "It was not justice,
but vengeance" said the College of

Marin campus leader. He said the
Grand Jury reflected the "racism,
paranoia, and economic bias" of
Marin County.
In light of these comments it's
not too surprising that all the
witnesses the jury questioned
were either guards or district
attorney's investigators. The key
witnesses were the three guards
who had been wounded. No
inmates were questioned.
The Marin hearing for the six
defendants has been postponed
until 9 a.m. October 15th (the
first hearing was October sth) to
allow the defendants to consult
with attorneys. They were not
allowed to consult with fellow
defendants however.
Each was brought into court
with wrists shackled and legs
hobbled. Each testified that he
had been refused free access to his
attorney and each repeated
charges of brutality since August
21st. Hugo Pinell had had three
teeth broken in one of four
beatings in the last month.
The 27 men on the first floor
of the Adjustment Center wrote
an affidavit to the United States
District Court of California—-
Northern District. This of course
was not used as evidence before
the Grand Jury.
"We, the 27 slave-convicts,
Black, Brown, and White alike, of
San Quentin State Prison
Adjustment Center, stand
victimized through a plot of
conspiracy to murder. Just as our
comrade George L. Jackson was
murdered on August 21, 1971.
The scene was made to look as an

escape attempt, but it was a
conspiracy to murder the Soledad
Brothers and Ruchell Magee. . ."
Sometime prior to the August
21st incident A 1 Mancino—one of
the 27 inmates in the Adjustment
Center was told by a Lieutenant
Moody to kill George Jackson as
they did not want another
Eldridge Cleaver on their hands.
Mancino refused to do this and
was summarily beaten.
On August 21st, he was shot in
the leg by a guard while lying
naked and chained on the ground.
He allegedly made a move to
escape! A 1 Mancino has now been
shipped to a prison in Nevada. He
cannot be extradicted back to
California and thus his important
testimony will not be heard in any
court or by anyone.
"This whole mass murder
conspiracy," continues the
statement of the inmates, "was
the State's desperate, but feeble
attempt to alleviate prominent
political prisoners and save court
cost."
"Since August 21st, 1971,
Warden Parks has disseminated to
the people false propaganda and
lies. . . We were deprived of pencil
and paper for a lengthy period of
time." The first document these
prisoners were able to write was
written with smuggled materials.
There have since been stringent
restrictions on visits, and no
books, magazines, or newspapers
are allowed. The inmates are in
constant hunger and their lives are
threatened daily—in an attempt to
silence them. Each time
investigators leave the prison they

(the prisoners) are brutalized and
put on restricted diets. Because of
these inhuman conditions they
have all requested to be
transferred to federal institutions.
These requests have not been
heeded.
"What we are saying is that we
need help from anybody. . .It is
time for the people to come
together in spite of our political
beliefs."
All power to the People!
Long live George Jackson!
