# On Neo-Liberalism
## 
### 
The article by Chris Gray on
Oct. 8 th to the Daily cannot go
unheeded. His defense of the men
who helped to shape and
implement American policy in
Indo-China is a patently
neo-liberal argument, one which
has conditioned the oppressive
and exploitative policies of the
Euro-American world toward the
mass of the world's poor folk.
That is, Mr. Gray is really saying
"Let's look at both sides" before
we bum oppressors and criminals
whose power machinations have
been the major moving force
behind the poverty of the people
of the world.
His argument misses the point
that these managers and
manipulators of the technology of
death welcome such neo-liberal
positions because it allows them
an opportunity to not only bring
to bear the power and influence
they wield in the upper sectors of
society to shift blame from
themselves, but also to set up
more subtle ways to continue
their policies and actions.
The "demise of individualism"
referred to by Mr. Gray does not
really require much comment. I
will only present a few critical
points. It was Euro-American
liberalism and individualism which
could (in the 194 o 's) congratulate
themselves and the Chinese
bourgeoisie when the treaty port
of Tientsin achieved its highest
profit level since it was taken over
by Euro-American interests in
1858.
The soul of the neo-liberal
cannot admit of the fact that this
happened while the majority of
the Chinese folk in the
countryside surrounding Tientsin
were suffering under one of the
most massive famines to hit north
China. It is also this

Euro-American individualsim
under the guise of
import-substitution and concern
for the future of the Latin
American folk that rips off profits
while promoting the idea that
Latin America is "finally"
approaching a "take-off stage."
The neo-liberal position closes
its eyes to the fact that in many
cases the initial investments in
Latin America are indigenous;
hence profit-taking by
multi-national corporations is an
act of theft. It is just such
neo-liberalism which closes its
eyes and soul to the repression
being carried out by Portugal and
the other racist regimes in
southern Africa against the just
struggles of the black folk in
Africa. More fundamentally, the
neo-liberal argument refuses to
recognize that Portugal, for
example is merely a surrogate for
Euro-American imperialism
(which can be identified in the
multi-national corporations and
the CIA agents who fly missions
in Mozambique).
In sum the demise of
individualism is necessary. It is
only then that the present
exploited and oppressed folk of
the world will be liberated and
can obtain justice and democracy.

points. It was Euro-American
liberalism and individualism which
could (in the 194 o 's) congratulate
themselves and the Chinese
bourgeoisie when the treaty port
of Tientsin achieved its highest
profit level since it was taken over
by Euro-American interests in
1858.
The soul of the neo-liberal
cannot admit of the fact that this
happened while the majority of
the Chinese folk in the
countryside surrounding Tientsin
were suffering under one of the
most massive famines to hit north
China. It is also this

Euro-American individualsim
under the guise of
import-substitution and concern
for the future of the Latin
American folk that rips off profits
while promoting the idea that
Latin America is "finally"
approaching a "take-off stage."
The neo-liberal position closes
its eyes to the fact that in many
cases the initial investments in
Latin America are indigenous;
hence profit-taking by
multi-national corporations is an
act of theft. It is just such
neo-liberalism which closes its
eyes and soul to the repression
being carried out by Portugal and
the other racist regimes in
southern Africa against the just
struggles of the black folk in
Africa. More fundamentally, the
neo-liberal argument refuses to
recognize that Portugal, for
example is merely a surrogate for
Euro-American imperialism
(which can be identified in the
multi-national corporations and
the CIA agents who fly missions
in Mozambique).
In sum the demise of
individualism is necessary. It is
only then that the present
exploited and oppressed folk of
the world will be liberated and
can obtain justice and democracy.

The article by Chris Gray on
Oct. 8 th to the Daily cannot go
unheeded. His defense of the men
who helped to shape and
implement American policy in
Indo-China is a patently
neo-liberal argument, one which
has conditioned the oppressive
and exploitative policies of the
Euro-American world toward the
mass of the world's poor folk.
That is, Mr. Gray is really saying
"Let's look at both sides" before
we bum oppressors and criminals
whose power machinations have
been the major moving force
behind the poverty of the people
of the world.
His argument misses the point
that these managers and
manipulators of the technology of
death welcome such neo-liberal
positions because it allows them
an opportunity to not only bring
to bear the power and influence
they wield in the upper sectors of
society to shift blame from
themselves, but also to set up
more subtle ways to continue
their policies and actions.
The "demise of individualism"
referred to by Mr. Gray does not
really require much comment. I
will only present a few critical
points. It was Euro-American
liberalism and individualism which
could (in the 194 o 's) congratulate
themselves and the Chinese
bourgeoisie when the treaty port
of Tientsin achieved its highest
profit level since it was taken over
