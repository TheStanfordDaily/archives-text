# In Support Of Franklin
## 
### 
To the people of the Stanford community:
I want to direct what I have to say primarily to
the vast majority of people at Stanford who are
apparently disinterested and indifferent to what is
happening to Bruce Franklin. This man is getting
messed over by a system which prohibits the
members of that system to ACT on what they
believe, to struggle against what they find unjust, to
be free to express themselves the way they find
necessary. Bruce Franklin found it necessary to act
on his strong beliefs against Stanford's involvement
in U.S. Defense Department projects.
He acted according to what his conscience, his
sense of justice, dictated to him, namely, to fight
and to struggle to stop this involvement which he
and many other people found wrong because of the
fact that this research at Stanford was and still is
contributing to and benefiting American
imperialism in Vietnam and in many other areas in
the world, in other words, contributing to the
slaughter of human lives every day. Bruce Franklin
said "NO! THIS IS WRONG!" and people were
behind him and there was a confrontation with
police and now Bruce Franklin faces expulsion from
the University.
Why is it that there are 12,000 people on this
campus and nobody's asking why this hearing is
going on? Why aren't we getting together and saying
that this suppression of political freedom has GOT
TO STOP? Political suppression is an old story at
Stanford.
Maybe you know of Paul Baran, a Marxist
economist at Stanford until his death in 1 964. He
returned from Cuba and gave a lecture at Cubberley
Hall in which he stated that Fidel Castro was one of
the great leaders of this century. For expressing his

sincere admiration of the Cuban Revolution, he was
humiliated and scorned by this University until his
death. He was refused salary raises while all his
colleagues received them, although Baran's
contribution academically was unquestionably quite
considerable.
Paul Baran was my father and 1 saw quite clearly
what Stanford did to him, made him a very bitter,
and very unhappy individual. They are doing the
same thing to Bruce Franklin and perhaps the fact
that I saw this happen to my own father arouses
such strong feelings in me about Bruce Franklin's
situation. I want to see an end to this kind of
intolerance and suppression at Stanford!
Are we going to sit back and let this type of
thing keep on happening?!!! Don't you feel
something inside when you spend 870 bills to go
here and they are using 12,000 dollars to justify
firing Bruce Franklin?! Doesn't it make you sick
that they have hired an entire L.A. Law Firm to
prosecute and humiliate a man who stood up for his
beliefs?!! Don't you want to do something or do
you want to sit back and make it a little easier for
Stanford to make a clean job of it and fire him
without a fight? Do you want to see this man's
career as a teacher completely ruined, a man with
good ideas and a lot of things to teach young people
who are struggling to make this world a little better
for all of us? If you don't want to see this, then let's
get together!! There's a rally on Monday (today) at
12 noon at White plaza and let's all be there and
show this University that we're behind Bruce
Franklin. We must let them know how we, the
students, feel about this thing!!!
