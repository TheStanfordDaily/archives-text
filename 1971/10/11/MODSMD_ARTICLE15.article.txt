# Molecules Movie Made For Masses
## 
### JOANNE JACOBS 
"Look, Frank! There I am in the ribosome."
"What the hell are you doing there?"
"Synthesizing."
An overflow crowd munched popcorn and laughed delightedly as
the film, "A Molecular Happening," happened in MlO6 Thursday
night.
The "human choreography of protein synthesis" was filmed last
spring in Escondido Village by Phlogiston Productions, starring 300
dancing, tumbling, crawling, swaying students.
Expressing the joyful and dynamic nature of a molecular reaction
was the goal of director Robert Weiss, a second year medical student.
Indeed, many of the shots might depict a Halloween orgy or Field
Day at the Nut House.
Frugging freaks with head balloons represent different bases of
transfer RNA, with each color coding a nucleotide. The amino acids,
who put in a particularly spirited performance, wear body paint.
Members of the ribosome are dressed in hospital scrub suits, while
various initiating and energizing factors sport flamboyant feathers and
capes.
Rhythmic chants reminiscent of Sesame Street identify the cast of
characters. "Initiator factor—number two. Oh yeah."
An excellent "protein jive sutra" complements the exuberant
dancers, while a mutilated form of "Jabberwocky" explains the
action. As the completed protein chain snake-dances ("Oh frabtious
day. . .") the silken-voiced narrator recites: "All mimsy was
mRNA/and protein chain outgrabe."
In all the excitement, an ignorant observer would have a hard time
following the biochemical goings-on. The film is undoubtedly for
those with some knowledge of protein synthesis, although the second
time around the process starts to fall into place even for an English
major.
Dr. Paul Berg, chairman of the biochemistry department, prefaces
the cellular extravaganza with a traditional explanation of protein
synthesis, almost a parody of the high school science movie.
Scientist in front of blackboard. Chalk diagram behind him, wire
and wood model in front of him. "Rarely," he says gravely, "do we
get a chance to participate in a molecular happening."
And then you see all those freaks making like molecules.
The 12-minute film is being distributed to high schools and colleges
across the country by the McGraw-Hill textbook company. It has
been shown in the medical school here, and may be seen by biology
and chemistry classes here soon.
It may also be screened as a short preceding "The Andromeda
Strain" for the Sunday Flicks.
Weiss worked with a UC-San Diego film group known as the Senses
Bureau, as well as a broad group of Stanford community people,
inlcuding assistant directors Greg Redding and Gordon Norman,
medical students, and Greg O'Leary, a graduate student in English.
Dick Palmiter, of the pharmacology department, is one of the
sponsors.
Following "A Molecular Happening" Weiss screened a beautiful
computer-generated film, also made with the Senses Bureau, which
showed the dynamic and three dimensional structure of myoglobin.
While colored lines and circles replaced the joyous human element,
the movie did an excellent job of expressing the fluidity of a
molecular structure. It proved far more effective and easy to
understand than a static model.
Original moog synthesizer music provided a background for the
short movie. Fred Heidrich, a medical student, did all the computer
programming, while Weiss directed the myoglobin epic.

In all the excitement, an ignorant observer would have a hard time
following the biochemical goings-on. The film is undoubtedly for
those with some knowledge of protein synthesis, although the second
time around the process starts to fall into place even for an English
major.
Dr. Paul Berg, chairman of the biochemistry department, prefaces
the cellular extravaganza with a traditional explanation of protein
synthesis, almost a parody of the high school science movie.
Scientist in front of blackboard. Chalk diagram behind him, wire
and wood model in front of him. "Rarely," he says gravely, "do we
get a chance to participate in a molecular happening."
And then you see all those freaks making like molecules.
The 12-minute film is being distributed to high schools and colleges
across the country by the McGraw-Hill textbook company. It has
been shown in the medical school here, and may be seen by biology
and chemistry classes here soon.
It may also be screened as a short preceding "The Andromeda
Strain" for the Sunday Flicks.
Weiss worked with a UC-San Diego film group known as the Senses
Bureau, as well as a broad group of Stanford community people,
inlcuding assistant directors Greg Redding and Gordon Norman,
medical students, and Greg O'Leary, a graduate student in English.
Dick Palmiter, of the pharmacology department, is one of the
sponsors.
Following "A Molecular Happening" Weiss screened a beautiful
computer-generated film, also made with the Senses Bureau, which
showed the dynamic and three dimensional structure of myoglobin.
While colored lines and circles replaced the joyous human element,
the movie did an excellent job of expressing the fluidity of a
molecular structure. It proved far more effective and easy to
understand than a static model.
Original moog synthesizer music provided a background for the
short movie. Fred Heidrich, a medical student, did all the computer
programming, while Weiss directed the myoglobin epic.

"Look, Frank! There I am in the ribosome."
"What the hell are you doing there?"
"Synthesizing."
An overflow crowd munched popcorn and laughed delightedly as
the film, "A Molecular Happening," happened in MlO6 Thursday
night.
The "human choreography of protein synthesis" was filmed last
spring in Escondido Village by Phlogiston Productions, starring 300
dancing, tumbling, crawling, swaying students.
Expressing the joyful and dynamic nature of a molecular reaction
was the goal of director Robert Weiss, a second year medical student.
Indeed, many of the shots might depict a Halloween orgy or Field
Day at the Nut House.
Frugging freaks with head balloons represent different bases of
transfer RNA, with each color coding a nucleotide. The amino acids,
who put in a particularly spirited performance, wear body paint.
Members of the ribosome are dressed in hospital scrub suits, while
various initiating and energizing factors sport flamboyant feathers and
capes.
Rhythmic chants reminiscent of Sesame Street identify the cast of
characters. "Initiator factor—number two. Oh yeah."
An excellent "protein jive sutra" complements the exuberant
dancers, while a mutilated form of "Jabberwocky" explains the
action. As the completed protein chain snake-dances ("Oh frabtious
day. . .") the silken-voiced narrator recites: "All mimsy was
mRNA/and protein chain outgrabe."
