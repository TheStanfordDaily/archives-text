# Hicks & His Licks Boggle The Mind
## 
### JOSEPH FIKSEL 
Dan Hicks and his Hot Licks were
expected to precede Country Joe
McDonald in a Memorial Auditorium
concert last Friday evening. But many of
the spectators spent a good half of the
show wondering: "Did they or didn't
they?"
The author of all this confusion was a
tall, mustachioed cat, sporting a Catholic
priest's stole as a headband, who ambled
onto the stage and deadpanned: "I'm Joe
McDonald; Dan Hicks didn't show up
tonight, so I'm going to do the whole show
myself with the Hot Licks. I don't know
what's wrong with Danâ€”he's crazy, he's
flipped out."
Though slightly bewildered, the
audience grew excited when he promised
to do some old Country Joe and the Fish
numbers. They began assailing him with
requests for "Fixin' to Die Rag" and "Not
so Sweet Martha Lorraine."
Apparently few realized that this clever
impostor, who does bear a strong
resemblance to the old Country Joe, was
actually Dan Hicks himself.
Flummoxed
By the time the truth dawned on them,
they no longer cared, for they had become
thoroughly engrossed in the music laid out
by Dan and his Licks, one of the most
unusual groups in all of California.
The group consists of Hicks, two rather

svelte female vocalists, and three other
musicians on bass fiddle, violin, banjo and
guitar. Hicks wrote and arranged most of
the music, a curious, nostalgic mixture of
styles from past decades.
Hicks was the leader of the very first
San Francisco rock-'n-roll band, the
Charlatans, who along with the Dead and
the Airplane put the Fillmore Auditorium,
the Avalon Ballroom, and the Matrix in the
class with Q-Tips and Kleenex.
If you can believe it, he's been doing
this same sort of trip since early 1965. Two
years ago he and the Hot Licks played with
It's A Beautiful Day, Santana, Quicksilver,
and the Airplane at a benefit for the
Grateful Dead.
Bill Graham explained that night why
they were included: "Look, these guys
started it all off. Dig it!"
Their songs are whimsical narratives,
delightful little ditties that evoke a sense of
days gone by. "Traffic Jam" is the
mock-mournful complaint of a mired
commuter; "Milk-Shaking Mama" is the
colorful saga of an ice-cream parlor love
affair.
Excellent Vocals
Couched in fresh, captivating melodies,
and backed by excellent vocal harmony
from the girls, such lyrics are surprisingly
entertaining. The real show-stoppers,
however, were some fine vocal

improvisations, and brilliant musical
passages, especially from Sid Page's fiery
violin.
Between numbers, Hicks maintained a
glib stream of low-key banter, sometimes
verging on insult (as when he mocked the
intellectual sophistication of Stanford
students), but always collapsing into
good-natured nonsense. His facetious,
baffling personality is the extra touch that
makes the Hot Licks' live performance
truly memorable.
After the frivolous gaiety of Hicks &
Co., soft-spoken Country Joe McDonald
was a sober contrast, even though his
material also seemed rooted in the past.
Ever since he separated from the Fish in
1970, Joe has been evolving considerably,
abandoning electric rock for a return to the
folk-protest style of the early sixties.
He has become involved in films, both
composing scores and appearing as an
actor. One of the songs that he performed
Friday night is from the film "What Is to
Be Done," which deals with the
revolutionary movement in Chile.
Simple Songs
Accompanied only by his own guitar,
Joe sang clear, simple songs about freedom,
revolution, and the evils of war. Always a
political activist, he seems to have
committed himself more firmly and
seriously to this role.
Unlike Bob Dylan, whose transition into

maturity has drawn him away from direct
involvement with political issues. Joe has
mellowed into a concerned, articulate
spokesman of the people.
His process of self-definition has led him
away from drugs, andhe warned the
audience, "Don't confuse smack with love;
the two have nothing in common."
Some of his compositions seemed to
reflect his own experiences: "I Done My
Duty" sounds like a bitter retrospective on
his service in the Navy, and"I Think I'll
Change My Style" speaks for itself.
Stirring Ballad
One of his most stirring numbers was
"The Ballad of Jean Dupre," from his new
album "War, War, Wa'," which is a
collection of World War 1 poetry set to
music. The ballad deals with the heroism of
a young French boy in the face of the
Prussians.
The audience dug his message, but were
not to be denied their old favorites. And
so, almost reluctantly, Joe agreed to lead
his famed 'Gimme an F" cheer, and
launched into the rousing "Fixin' to Die
Ras " : One, Two Three
What're we fightin' for
Don 7 ask me I don't give a damn
Next stop is Vict Nam. . .
In his own quiet, understated way, Joe
won over his listeners, encouraging them to
sing and clap along. Yet he himself seemed
a bit paternal, a bit remote. I suppose
sooner or later everyone has to grow old.
