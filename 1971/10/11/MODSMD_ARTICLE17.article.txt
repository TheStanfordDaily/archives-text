# Sebastian Album Full Of Problems
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
THE FOUR OF US, John
Sebastian, Reprise MS 204 1
Seldom in a lifetime does a
record of such monumental
insignificance come to the fore. In
the tradition of "The Monkees'
Greatest Hits" and Paul
McCartney's "Ram," the first
completely new John Sebastian
album was hardly worth waiting
for.
By way of information, it must
be noted that this reviewer has
long been a devoted Lovin'
Spoonful-Sebastian freak. So if 1
dislike this record, it can't be too
hot.
The saga of John Sebastian
goes back to the early days of the
Knglish music invasion. One of
numerous groups to be billed as
"America's answer to the
Beatles," the Lovin' Spoonful, led
by Sebastian, survived the tag to
put out a number of fine albums
and singles, among them
"Daydream," "Do You Believe in
Magic?" and the incredible album
"Hums," which included
"Summer in the City" and
"Nashville Cats."
Dope Problems
After the "Hums" album was
released, however, the group
started to disintegrate. Lead
guitarist Zal Yanovsky, a
Canadian, was picked up for
possession of grass before it
became "fashionable," and was
threatened with deportation
unless he fingered his source.
When word got around that he
had named his source, Spoonful
records were boycotted.
Yanovsky then quit the group,
his place being taken by folksinger
Jerry Yester. (When last heard
from, Yanovsky was playing for
Kris Kristofferson.) In view of the
bad vibes surrounding the
situation, it is not surprising that
the group's next album,
"Everything Playing," lacked the
good-timey music that had been
their hallmark.
Sebastian, the guiding source,
then left the group. It remained
for studio musicians and drummer
Joe Butler to put out the last
record under the Spoonful name,
the disastrous "Revolution-
Revelation '69."
Sebastian, now a solo, then
released a single, "She's a Lady
b/w The Room Nobody Lives In,"
on the Spoonful's old label, Kama
Sutra/MGM.
Record Confusion
Now, things start to get
confusing. Kama Sutra/M(SM
released "The Best of the Lovin'
Spoonful," "The Best of the
Lovin' Spoonful Vol. 2," and "24
Karat Hits," all comprised of
basically the same songs.
Then, the Kama Sutra label
switched its distribution deal to
Buddah Records, which promptly
released "The Very Best of the
Lovin' Spoonful," "In the
Beginning," and"The John
Sebastian Songbook as Performed
by the Lovin' Spoonful Vol. 1 ."
Once again, these were the same
songs that appeared on the MGM
greatest hits albums.
In the meantime, Sebastian
signed with Reprise, and released
his first solo Ip, "John B.
Sebastian." This was not

completely new, in that it
included both sides of the
year-old Kama Sutra single, as
well as a remake of an old
Spoonful song.
MGM Records, claiming that it
somehow had rights to Sebastian
under a Spoonful contract,
promptly released its own version
of "J. 8.5.," inferior in sound
quality to the Reprise version.
Then, without Sebastian's
knowledge or consent, MGM
recorded and released a horrible
live album. However, Reprise
finally landed a court order
pulling the MGM "J. 8.5." and
"John Sebastian—Live" off the
shelves.
So now, early this summer,
with all legal hassles finally
decided in his favor, what does
Sebastian do?
Right. He released another live
album, containing mostly remakes
of Spoonful songs (remember
those six greatest hits albums?).
Spoonful Flood
"Cheapo Cheapo Productions
Presents Real Live John
Sebastian," although a good
performance, stretched the
Spoonful Hood to the saturation
point. I mean, the group hasn't
been together in almost four
years!
So now, finally, comes the first
all-new record Sebastian has ever
done.
After the first few listenings,
all of side one seems to melt into
a shapeless blob. "Well Well Well"
and "Black Snake Blues" are
poorly done rocker types. "I
Don't Want Nobody Else" is
probably the best song on the
side, but only by comparison with
some of the other crap. It's at
least inoffensive.
"Apple Hill" could well have
come from "Ram." It has that
peculiarly McCartney tunefulness
that soon becomes tiring.
"Black Satin Kid" had
possibilities. The lyrics, about a
Texas Johnny B. Goode, were
nothing spectacular, but the
combination of ingredients that
made "Red-Eye Express" off
"J. 8.5." so good are present.
However, due to a poor
arrangement hr*re, the song just
doesn't quite make it. And
"Sweet Muse" proves conclusively
that John Sebastian can't play da
blooze.
Side two includes "The Four
of Us," a musical anthology of his
cross-country trip. "Lashes
Laßue" is the only semi-decent
cut on the side.
In short, an extremely
disappointing album from
someone who can do much better.
In the meantime, where's my
copy of "Hums of the Lovin'
Spoonful"?

SUNDAY MUSIC -Yesterday
afternoon, music of two tvpes was
heard on the Stanford campus.
The Utah Symphony Orchestra

wit'n Brahms and Stravinsky in a
late afternoon picnic concert.
Over at the Beta Mouse (right),
the music was more electric and
the crowd a bit rowdier. 15 fr»M>
kegs of beer at the
"Falstaff-Beta-Sunbust" probably
made the crowd pretty
appreciative. At least, nobody was
thirsty.
