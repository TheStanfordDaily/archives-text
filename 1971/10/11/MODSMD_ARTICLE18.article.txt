# Indians Stifle Washington
## 
### 
SEATTLE—Sparked by a
defensive rush which continually
pressured Washington quarterback
Sonny Sixkiller, Stanford scored
early to win a crucial 17-6
decision over the Huskies on
Saturday.
The junior, who recently gaced
the cover of Sports Illustrated,
was knocked down for a loss six
times and had five of his passes
either deflected or knocked down
by on-rushing linemen.
Sixkiller Dumped
Sixkiller could complete only
12 of 46 passes for 182 yards and
four of his passes were
intercepted, three of them by
junior free safety Bennie Barnes
who gained defensive-player-of
the-game honors for his
performance. Sixkiller lost 40
yards on the ground and the
Huskies as a team ended up with
an amazing total of -13 yards
rushing.
An indication of what would
happen all day came on the first
series of the game when Sixkiller
had his first pass knocked down
by defensive guard Larry Butler
and then two plays later lost nine
yards when Butler and tackle Greg
Sampson smashed into him while
he was attempting to pass.
The Indians were stalled on
Washington's 48 yard line on
their first offensive attempt. But
after another three play
Washington series in which
Sixkiller was hit for an 11 yard
loss and a near safety on his one
yard line, the Indians began their
first scoring drive from 32 yards
out.
Winesberry Scores
Quarterback Don Bunce ran an
option for 10, and fullback Reggie
Sanderson gained two before
fumbling, but the Stanford line
recovered the ball. Then
sophomore flanker John
Winesberry beat Charles Buckland
on a sideline pattern and stepped

by him to go the final five yards
for the score.
On their next offensive
attempt, Washington could
manage only two plays and no
yards, before Barnes got his tirst
interception at the Washington
49. Sixkiller had looped a pass
intended for flanker Jim Krieg
and Barnes was able to wait for it
to come down. He pulled it in like
a fly ball and his fifteen yard
return put Stanford on the
Huskies' 34.
Sanderson Excels
After three runs moved them
down to the 20, Sanderson broke
a slant off left tackle for another
20 yard score. Stanford had their
second TD in three minutes and it
would be all they would need as
the Indian defense continued a
pattern of stinginess which has
characterized their play all year.
Rod Garcia added a 47 yard field
goal early in the second period to
give Stanford a 17 -0 halftime lead.
In the second half,
Washington's defense toughened
considerably. They were
particularly impressive when they
held against the Indians on their
own one yard line midway
through the third quarter. With
first and goal at the three,
fullback Jim Kehl, running back
Jackie Brown, Winesberry and
Sanderson all tried to run it in,
but none could
Defense Holds
But Stanford's defense didn't
let up at all and Sixkiller just
couldn't move his club. It wasn't
all his fault. The Washington
offensive line were unable to keep
Stanford's rushing linemen away
from their quarterback. And the
Husky running attack provided
little, if any, balance.
Washington finally scored on a
long drive late in the game. The
key play was a pass from Sixkiller
which went off of tight end John
Brady's arms and into split end

Scott Loomis' for a 37 yard gain
to the Stanford 38. The Indian
defense had apparently stopped
the Huskies when Sixkiller was
dropped for .«.n 11 yard loss on a
fourth and seven play from the
nine, but Stanford was called for
holding. On the next play,
halfback Luther Sligh scored from
the one. A two point conversion
attempt failed and the final score
was set at 17 -6.
Ralston Pleased
After the game, Ralston was
predictably pleased with his
defense. All week long he had said
that the team's major goal was to
stop Sixkiller and they had.
Ralston put it this way:
"Washington's strength was in
their outside receivers and
Sixkiller. We practiced all week to
contain this strength and I think
we demonstrated it today."
"We have a pretty good
defensive team. Our boys—this
team—is the best prepared team
mentally that I've ever coached."
Offensive player of the game
Bunce, who completed 9 of 24 for
141 yards and ran for 27 more
also talked about the mental
aspect of the game. "We were
really super keyed for this
game .... The whole team felt
that we had to beat Washington
today ... if we were to have a
chance at the Rose Bowl."
Another thing Stanford had
worked on all week long was their
punting game. Stanford's punting
hurt them considerably in their
loss last week to Duke, and
Ralston and his staff worked all
week after practice with kicker
Steve Murray. It paid off.
Despite getting off one 23 yard
kick, Murray averaged 4 0.5 yards
for nine kicks. Murray's
improvement gave the Indians a
considerably better field positioh
situation than they had a week
ago.
The only real major problem in

yesterday's game was a knee
injury of uncertain seriousness
sufferred by middle linebacker
Jeff Siemon. The extent of his
injury will be known better today.
With USC and the Los Angeles
Coliseum less than a week away, it
would be nice if he recovers
quickly.

DEFENSIVE POWER-Middle linebacker Jeff Siemon (92) calls signals in the defensive huddle in last
week's Duke game. On Saturday, the Indian defense held a previously high-scoring Washington offense to
only six points, as the Indians won 17-6. A tenacious rush led by the defensive front four of Larry Butler,
Roger Cowan, Pete Lazetich and Greg Sampson dumped Husky quarterback Sonny Sixkiller six times and
knocked down five of his passes. Free safety Bennie Barnes made three interceptions and executed some
very effective safety blitzes. Washington's score, only the second touchdown scored on Stanford's defense
this year, came on a drive which included a controversial 37 yard pass play in which the ball was
seemingly touched consecutively by two Washington receivers. Later the Indians had apparently stopped
Washington on a fourth and seven from the Stanford nine, but a holding penalty put the ball on the one
and the Huskies scored a play later. In Saturday's game, Siemon suffered a knee injury of uncertain
seriousness.

DEFENSIVE POWER-Middle linebacker Jeff Siemon (92) calls signals in the defensive huddle in last
week's Duke game. On Saturday, the Indian defense held a previously high-scoring Washington offense to
only six points, as the Indians won 17-6. A tenacious rush led by the defensive front four of Larry Butler,
Roger Cowan, Pete Lazetich and Greg Sampson dumped Husky quarterback Sonny Sixkiller six times and
knocked down five of his passes. Free safety Bennie Barnes made three interceptions and executed some
very effective safety blitzes. Washington's score, only the second touchdown scored on Stanford's defense
this year, came on a drive which included a controversial 37 yard pass play in which the ball was
seemingly touched consecutively by two Washington receivers. Later the Indians had apparently stopped
Washington on a fourth and seven from the Stanford nine, but a holding penalty put the ball on the one
and the Huskies scored a play later. In Saturday's game, Siemon suffered a knee injury of uncertain
seriousness.
SEATTLE—Sparked by a
defensive rush which continually
pressured Washington quarterback
Sonny Sixkiller, Stanford scored
early to win a crucial 17-6
decision over the Huskies on
Saturday.
The junior, who recently gaced
the cover of Sports Illustrated,
was knocked down for a loss six
times and had five of his passes
either deflected or knocked down
by on-rushing linemen.
Sixkiller Dumped
Sixkiller could complete only
12 of 46 passes for 182 yards and
four of his passes were
intercepted, three of them by
junior free safety Bennie Barnes
who gained defensive-player-of
the-game honors for his
performance. Sixkiller lost 40
yards on the ground and the
Huskies as a team ended up with
an amazing total of -13 yards
rushing.
An indication of what would
happen all day came on the first
series of the game when Sixkiller
had his first pass knocked down
by defensive guard Larry Butler
and then two plays later lost nine
yards when Butler and tackle Greg
Sampson smashed into him while
he was attempting to pass.
The Indians were stalled on
Washington's 48 yard line on
their first offensive attempt. But
after another three play
Washington series in which
Sixkiller was hit for an 11 yard
loss and a near safety on his one
yard line, the Indians began their
first scoring drive from 32 yards
out.
Winesberry Scores
Quarterback Don Bunce ran an
option for 10, and fullback Reggie
Sanderson gained two before
fumbling, but the Stanford line
recovered the ball. Then
sophomore flanker John
Winesberry beat Charles Buckland
on a sideline pattern and stepped

by him to go the final five yards
for the score.
On their next offensive
attempt, Washington could
manage only two plays and no
yards, before Barnes got his tirst
interception at the Washington
49. Sixkiller had looped a pass
intended for flanker Jim Krieg
and Barnes was able to wait for it
to come down. He pulled it in like
a fly ball and his fifteen yard
return put Stanford on the
Huskies' 34.
Sanderson Excels
After three runs moved them
down to the 20, Sanderson broke
a slant off left tackle for another
20 yard score. Stanford had their
second TD in three minutes and it
would be all they would need as
the Indian defense continued a
pattern of stinginess which has
characterized their play all year.
Rod Garcia added a 47 yard field
goal early in the second period to
give Stanford a 17 -0 halftime lead.
In the second half,
Washington's defense toughened
considerably. They were
particularly impressive when they
held against the Indians on their
own one yard line midway
through the third quarter. With
first and goal at the three,
fullback Jim Kehl, running back
Jackie Brown, Winesberry and
Sanderson all tried to run it in,
but none could
Defense Holds
But Stanford's defense didn't
let up at all and Sixkiller just
couldn't move his club. It wasn't
all his fault. The Washington
offensive line were unable to keep
Stanford's rushing linemen away
from their quarterback. And the
Husky running attack provided
little, if any, balance.
Washington finally scored on a
long drive late in the game. The
key play was a pass from Sixkiller
which went off of tight end John
Brady's arms and into split end

Scott Loomis' for a 37 yard gain
to the Stanford 38. The Indian
defense had apparently stopped
the Huskies when Sixkiller was
dropped for .«.n 11 yard loss on a
fourth and seven play from the
nine, but Stanford was called for
holding. On the next play,
halfback Luther Sligh scored from
the one. A two point conversion
attempt failed and the final score
was set at 17 -6.
Ralston Pleased
After the game, Ralston was
predictably pleased with his
defense. All week long he had said
that the team's major goal was to
stop Sixkiller and they had.
Ralston put it this way:
"Washington's strength was in
their outside receivers and
Sixkiller. We practiced all week to
contain this strength and I think
we demonstrated it today."
"We have a pretty good
defensive team. Our boys—this
team—is the best prepared team
mentally that I've ever coached."
Offensive player of the game
Bunce, who completed 9 of 24 for
141 yards and ran for 27 more
also talked about the mental
aspect of the game. "We were
really super keyed for this
game .... The whole team felt
that we had to beat Washington
today ... if we were to have a
chance at the Rose Bowl."
Another thing Stanford had
worked on all week long was their
punting game. Stanford's punting
hurt them considerably in their
loss last week to Duke, and
Ralston and his staff worked all
week after practice with kicker
Steve Murray. It paid off.
Despite getting off one 23 yard
kick, Murray averaged 4 0.5 yards
for nine kicks. Murray's
improvement gave the Indians a
considerably better field positioh
situation than they had a week
ago.
The only real major problem in

yesterday's game was a knee
injury of uncertain seriousness
sufferred by middle linebacker
Jeff Siemon. The extent of his
injury will be known better today.
With USC and the Los Angeles
Coliseum less than a week away, it
would be nice if he recovers
quickly.

aspect of the game. "We were
really super keyed for this
game .... The whole team felt
that we had to beat Washington
today ... if we were to have a
chance at the Rose Bowl."
Another thing Stanford had
worked on all week long was their
punting game. Stanford's punting
hurt them considerably in their
loss last week to Duke, and
Ralston and his staff worked all
week after practice with kicker
Steve Murray. It paid off.
Despite getting off one 23 yard
kick, Murray averaged 4 0.5 yards
for nine kicks. Murray's
improvement gave the Indians a
considerably better field positioh
situation than they had a week
ago.
The only real major problem in

yesterday's game was a knee
injury of uncertain seriousness
sufferred by middle linebacker
Jeff Siemon. The extent of his
injury will be known better today.
With USC and the Los Angeles
Coliseum less than a week away, it
would be nice if he recovers
quickly.

DEFENSIVE POWER-Middle linebacker Jeff Siemon (92) calls signals in the defensive huddle in last
week's Duke game. On Saturday, the Indian defense held a previously high-scoring Washington offense to
only six points, as the Indians won 17-6. A tenacious rush led by the defensive front four of Larry Butler,
Roger Cowan, Pete Lazetich and Greg Sampson dumped Husky quarterback Sonny Sixkiller six times and
knocked down five of his passes. Free safety Bennie Barnes made three interceptions and executed some
very effective safety blitzes. Washington's score, only the second touchdown scored on Stanford's defense
this year, came on a drive which included a controversial 37 yard pass play in which the ball was
seemingly touched consecutively by two Washington receivers. Later the Indians had apparently stopped
Washington on a fourth and seven from the Stanford nine, but a holding penalty put the ball on the one
and the Huskies scored a play later. In Saturday's game, Siemon suffered a knee injury of uncertain
seriousness.
SEATTLE—Sparked by a
defensive rush which continually
pressured Washington quarterback
Sonny Sixkiller, Stanford scored
early to win a crucial 17-6
decision over the Huskies on
Saturday.
The junior, who recently gaced
the cover of Sports Illustrated,
was knocked down for a loss six
times and had five of his passes
either deflected or knocked down
by on-rushing linemen.
Sixkiller Dumped
Sixkiller could complete only
12 of 46 passes for 182 yards and
four of his passes were
intercepted, three of them by
junior free safety Bennie Barnes
who gained defensive-player-of
the-game honors for his
performance. Sixkiller lost 40
yards on the ground and the
Huskies as a team ended up with
an amazing total of -13 yards
rushing.
An indication of what would
happen all day came on the first
series of the game when Sixkiller
had his first pass knocked down
by defensive guard Larry Butler
and then two plays later lost nine
yards when Butler and tackle Greg
Sampson smashed into him while
he was attempting to pass.
The Indians were stalled on
Washington's 48 yard line on
their first offensive attempt. But
after another three play
Washington series in which
Sixkiller was hit for an 11 yard
loss and a near safety on his one
yard line, the Indians began their
first scoring drive from 32 yards
out.
Winesberry Scores
Quarterback Don Bunce ran an
option for 10, and fullback Reggie
Sanderson gained two before
fumbling, but the Stanford line
recovered the ball. Then
sophomore flanker John
Winesberry beat Charles Buckland
on a sideline pattern and stepped

by him to go the final five yards
for the score.
On their next offensive
attempt, Washington could
manage only two plays and no
yards, before Barnes got his tirst
interception at the Washington
49. Sixkiller had looped a pass
intended for flanker Jim Krieg
and Barnes was able to wait for it
to come down. He pulled it in like
a fly ball and his fifteen yard
return put Stanford on the
Huskies' 34.
Sanderson Excels
After three runs moved them
down to the 20, Sanderson broke
a slant off left tackle for another
20 yard score. Stanford had their
second TD in three minutes and it
would be all they would need as
the Indian defense continued a
pattern of stinginess which has
characterized their play all year.
Rod Garcia added a 47 yard field
goal early in the second period to
give Stanford a 17 -0 halftime lead.
In the second half,
Washington's defense toughened
considerably. They were
particularly impressive when they
held against the Indians on their
own one yard line midway
through the third quarter. With
first and goal at the three,
fullback Jim Kehl, running back
Jackie Brown, Winesberry and
Sanderson all tried to run it in,
but none could
Defense Holds
But Stanford's defense didn't
let up at all and Sixkiller just
couldn't move his club. It wasn't
all his fault. The Washington
offensive line were unable to keep
Stanford's rushing linemen away
from their quarterback. And the
Husky running attack provided
little, if any, balance.
Washington finally scored on a
long drive late in the game. The
key play was a pass from Sixkiller
which went off of tight end John
Brady's arms and into split end

Scott Loomis' for a 37 yard gain
to the Stanford 38. The Indian
defense had apparently stopped
the Huskies when Sixkiller was
dropped for .«.n 11 yard loss on a
fourth and seven play from the
nine, but Stanford was called for
holding. On the next play,
halfback Luther Sligh scored from
the one. A two point conversion
attempt failed and the final score
was set at 17 -6.
Ralston Pleased
After the game, Ralston was
predictably pleased with his
defense. All week long he had said
that the team's major goal was to
stop Sixkiller and they had.
Ralston put it this way:
"Washington's strength was in
their outside receivers and
Sixkiller. We practiced all week to
contain this strength and I think
we demonstrated it today."
"We have a pretty good
defensive team. Our boys—this
team—is the best prepared team
mentally that I've ever coached."
Offensive player of the game
Bunce, who completed 9 of 24 for
141 yards and ran for 27 more
also talked about the mental
aspect of the game. "We were
really super keyed for this
game .... The whole team felt
that we had to beat Washington
today ... if we were to have a
