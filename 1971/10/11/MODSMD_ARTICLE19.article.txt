# Upsets Dominate Pacific-8 Action
## 
### 
The Indians' 17 -6 "upset"
victory over Washington
highlighted a weekend of upsets
and near upsets in the Pac-8 last
weekend. The Associated Press
predicted last week that the score
of the Indian-Husky game would
be "Washington 34-Stanford 7.
The Huskies' Sonny Sixkiller
fattens his statistics."
Oregon knocked off favored
USC, 28-23, on Saturday night.
Led by their second string
quarterback Harvey Winn, the

Ducks passed for 25 3 yards and
three touchdowns.
Cal's Steve Sweeney caught Jay
Cruze's pass for a touchdown with
no time left to slip by Oregon
State, 30-27.
Washington State's ground
attack kept pressure on UCLA all
afternoon and racked up 21
points, but the Bruins led by Marv
Kendrick's three touchdown runs,
held off the Cougar challenge to
win, 34-21.
This year's Rose Bowl race has
been clouded by the Pac-B's

decision to bar California from
the Rose Bowl this season. All the
Pac-8 teams' clashes with the
Bears will be considered
non-conference games and will
not have any bearing on choosing
the Rose Bowl representative.
The Pac-8 voted Friday to
discipline Cal for playing Isaac
Curtis who was suspended by the
NCAA for the season. The vote
was 5-3 by the Pac-8
representatives, with Stanford
voting against the disciplinary
action.
