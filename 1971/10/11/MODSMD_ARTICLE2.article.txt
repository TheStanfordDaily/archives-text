# Both Sides Show Confidence After 10 Days Of Testimony
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT News Analysis 
"I think our case has come in very
strong," University lawyer Ray Fisher
said Friday, after winding up the
administration's presentation of
witnesses in the dismissal hearing of
English Professor H. Bruce Franklin.
A jubilant Franklin had a very
different view: "They ain't proved
shit." And the Maoist professor will
demand today that the administration's
charges against him be dropped.
Fr„nklin has certainly won any
struggle for domination of the hearing
sessions. His constant objections and
insistent questioning have attracted
most of the attention in the mock
courtroom. And observers of the
hearing, including most reporters, agree
that the suspended teacher has
frustrated and challenged many
administration witnesses.
The revolutionary professor claims
he has already shown the case to be a
"farce." He said it is clear that he is on
trial for being a revolutionary rather
than for specific crimes.
But Fisher, a young and personable
Los Angeles lawyer, answers that
courtroom theatrics and legal evidence
are very different matters. He charges
that Franklin's challenges to
administration witnesses were only
superficial. "At this point, there aren't
any contradictions" to the
administration case, Fisher added.
Different Case
"If you're looking for a case where a
guy says, 'Go burn down a building'
and somebody burns it down, that's a
dramatic case," Fisher said. "But that's
not the only Kind of case. Franklin
clearly urged people to participate in
unlawful behavior."
Franklin is charged with inciting and

participating in campus disruptions,
Jan. 11 and Feb. 10.
Whoever will win in the end, it
appears unlikely the Advisory Board
will grant Franklin's motion to drop
the case before hearing the suspended
professor's witnesses. And that
probably means a minimum of three
more weeks of five and a half hour
sessions in Physics 101.
The daily routine is now
well-established. Franklin gestures and
speaks tirelessly. Fisher usually
maintains the trained calm of a lawyer,
but sometimes he is plainly irked by his
unpredictable opponent. Board
Chairman Donald Kennedy, a biology
professor, has confidently adopted his
role as judge. He only occasionally
leans over for whispered advice from
the Board's lawyer, UC professor Jan
Vetter.
Quiet Chats
Other board members never make
statements during the sessions and only
rarely pass Kennedy a written question
for a witness. The seven professors
listen carefully and take notes during
the testimony, although Professors
San ford Dornbusch and Wolfgang
Panofsky sometimes chat quietly.
Panofsky, director of SLAC, smiles a<)d
occasionally shakes his head in
amusement.
The audience size has varied with
the often-tedious pace of the hearings,
but an overflow crowd is expected as
Franklin begins his "People's Offense"
today. Holding to his pledge to make
the hearings a revolutionary education,
Franklin has asked supporters to march
from a noon rally to watch the opening
of his case.
And he promises to keep up interest
with "a surprise every day."
Tomorrow's special guest may be
Princeton professor Richard Falk,
appearing as either witness or
co-co vnsel.
Franklin said, "We're going to try to
recreate the reality of the movement,
so people can really understand where
we're coming from."
Other Side
He promises to show "that we're not
a bunch of crazies bent on looney acts
of destruction. The mindlessness is
going to be on the other side."
And he insisted, "We're going to
prove scientifically that some of their
witnesses are lying."
Franklin and Fisher will approach
the Board today with very different
ideas about how to keep Franklin's
arguments from extending far beyond
the 10 days that Fisher took. Franklin
threatens to call all of 226 witnesses
unless the Board eliminates many
details introduced by the
administration witnesses. He said it will
require months to give his version of
such "irrelevant" details as exactly
what happened inside a Computation
Center shutdown which Franklin
allegedly provoked.
'Anarchistic' Argument
Fisher instead wants to eliminate as
"irrelevant" evidence concerning the
Nuremberg Principle and Stanford's
complicity in the Vietnam War. Fisher
said Franklin's arguments that he acted
to prevent war crimes is " anarchistic.

That would just result in a lot of ad hoc
judgments by a lot of people."
Even when Franklin's defense is
complete, the hearing will have at least
another week to go. Final arguments
will be followed by rebuttal and
testimony from "rebuttal witnesses."
Then, the Advisory Board will at last
be left with thousands of pages of
testimony and the problem of deciding
whether there is "substantial evidence"
that Franklin committed acts which
violated his "appropriate function" in
the academic community.
Fisher said the administration case
will prove itself when "the real crunch
comes," during the Board's study of
the evidence. But Franklin is sure that
he has already won.

rarely pass Kennedy a written question
for a witness. The seven professors
listen carefully and take notes during
the testimony, although Professors
San ford Dornbusch and Wolfgang
Panofsky sometimes chat quietly.
Panofsky, director of SLAC, smiles a<)d
occasionally shakes his head in
amusement.
The audience size has varied with
the often-tedious pace of the hearings,
but an overflow crowd is expected as
Franklin begins his "People's Offense"
today. Holding to his pledge to make
the hearings a revolutionary education,
Franklin has asked supporters to march
from a noon rally to watch the opening
of his case.
And he promises to keep up interest
with "a surprise every day."
Tomorrow's special guest may be
Princeton professor Richard Falk,
appearing as either witness or
co-co vnsel.
Franklin said, "We're going to try to
recreate the reality of the movement,
so people can really understand where
we're coming from."
Other Side
He promises to show "that we're not
a bunch of crazies bent on looney acts
of destruction. The mindlessness is
going to be on the other side."
And he insisted, "We're going to
prove scientifically that some of their
witnesses are lying."
Franklin and Fisher will approach
the Board today with very different
ideas about how to keep Franklin's
arguments from extending far beyond
the 10 days that Fisher took. Franklin
threatens to call all of 226 witnesses
unless the Board eliminates many
details introduced by the
administration witnesses. He said it will
require months to give his version of
such "irrelevant" details as exactly
what happened inside a Computation
Center shutdown which Franklin
allegedly provoked.
'Anarchistic' Argument
Fisher instead wants to eliminate as
"irrelevant" evidence concerning the
Nuremberg Principle and Stanford's
complicity in the Vietnam War. Fisher
said Franklin's arguments that he acted
to prevent war crimes is " anarchistic.

That would just result in a lot of ad hoc
judgments by a lot of people."
Even when Franklin's defense is
complete, the hearing will have at least
another week to go. Final arguments
will be followed by rebuttal and
testimony from "rebuttal witnesses."
Then, the Advisory Board will at last
be left with thousands of pages of
testimony and the problem of deciding
whether there is "substantial evidence"
that Franklin committed acts which
violated his "appropriate function" in
the academic community.
Fisher said the administration case
will prove itself when "the real crunch
comes," during the Board's study of
the evidence. But Franklin is sure that
he has already won.
"I think our case has come in very
strong," University lawyer Ray Fisher
said Friday, after winding up the
administration's presentation of
witnesses in the dismissal hearing of
English Professor H. Bruce Franklin.
A jubilant Franklin had a very
different view: "They ain't proved
shit." And the Maoist professor will
demand today that the administration's
charges against him be dropped.
Fr„nklin has certainly won any
struggle for domination of the hearing
sessions. His constant objections and
insistent questioning have attracted
most of the attention in the mock
courtroom. And observers of the
hearing, including most reporters, agree
that the suspended teacher has
frustrated and challenged many
administration witnesses.
The revolutionary professor claims
he has already shown the case to be a
"farce." He said it is clear that he is on
trial for being a revolutionary rather
than for specific crimes.
But Fisher, a young and personable
Los Angeles lawyer, answers that
courtroom theatrics and legal evidence
are very different matters. He charges
that Franklin's challenges to
administration witnesses were only
superficial. "At this point, there aren't
any contradictions" to the
administration case, Fisher added.
Different Case
"If you're looking for a case where a
guy says, 'Go burn down a building'
and somebody burns it down, that's a
dramatic case," Fisher said. "But that's
not the only Kind of case. Franklin
clearly urged people to participate in
unlawful behavior."
Franklin is charged with inciting and

participating in campus disruptions,
Jan. 11 and Feb. 10.
Whoever will win in the end, it
appears unlikely the Advisory Board
will grant Franklin's motion to drop
the case before hearing the suspended
professor's witnesses. And that
probably means a minimum of three
more weeks of five and a half hour
sessions in Physics 101.
The daily routine is now
well-established. Franklin gestures and
speaks tirelessly. Fisher usually
maintains the trained calm of a lawyer,
but sometimes he is plainly irked by his
unpredictable opponent. Board
Chairman Donald Kennedy, a biology
professor, has confidently adopted his
role as judge. He only occasionally
leans over for whispered advice from
the Board's lawyer, UC professor Jan
Vetter.

the academic community.
Fisher said the administration case
will prove itself when "the real crunch
comes," during the Board's study of
the evidence. But Franklin is sure that
he has already won.
"I think our case has come in very
strong," University lawyer Ray Fisher
said Friday, after winding up the
administration's presentation of
witnesses in the dismissal hearing of
English Professor H. Bruce Franklin.
A jubilant Franklin had a very
different view: "They ain't proved
shit." And the Maoist professor will
demand today that the administration's
charges against him be dropped.
Fr„nklin has certainly won any
struggle for domination of the hearing
sessions. His constant objections and
insistent questioning have attracted
most of the attention in the mock
courtroom. And observers of the
hearing, including most reporters, agree
that the suspended teacher has
frustrated and challenged many
administration witnesses.
The revolutionary professor claims
he has already shown the case to be a
"farce." He said it is clear that he is on
trial for being a revolutionary rather
than for specific crimes.
But Fisher, a young and personable
Los Angeles lawyer, answers that
courtroom theatrics and legal evidence
are very different matters. He charges
that Franklin's challenges to
administration witnesses were only
superficial. "At this point, there aren't
any contradictions" to the
administration case, Fisher added.
Different Case
"If you're looking for a case where a
guy says, 'Go burn down a building'
and somebody burns it down, that's a
dramatic case," Fisher said. "But that's
not the only Kind of case. Franklin
clearly urged people to participate in
unlawful behavior."
Franklin is charged with inciting and

participating in campus disruptions,
Jan. 11 and Feb. 10.
Whoever will win in the end, it
appears unlikely the Advisory Board
will grant Franklin's motion to drop
the case before hearing the suspended
professor's witnesses. And that
probably means a minimum of three
more weeks of five and a half hour
sessions in Physics 101.
The daily routine is now
well-established. Franklin gestures and
speaks tirelessly. Fisher usually
maintains the trained calm of a lawyer,
but sometimes he is plainly irked by his
unpredictable opponent. Board
Chairman Donald Kennedy, a biology
professor, has confidently adopted his
role as judge. He only occasionally
leans over for whispered advice from
the Board's lawyer, UC professor Jan
Vetter.
Quiet Chats
Other board members never make
statements during the sessions and only
rarely pass Kennedy a written question
for a witness. The seven professors
listen carefully and take notes during
the testimony, although Professors
San ford Dornbusch and Wolfgang
Panofsky sometimes chat quietly.
Panofsky, director of SLAC, smiles a<)d
occasionally shakes his head in
amusement.
The audience size has varied with
the often-tedious pace of the hearings,
but an overflow crowd is expected as
Franklin begins his "People's Offense"
today. Holding to his pledge to make
the hearings a revolutionary education,
Franklin has asked supporters to march
from a noon rally to watch the opening
of his case.
And he promises to keep up interest
with "a surprise every day."
Tomorrow's special guest may be
Princeton professor Richard Falk,
appearing as either witness or
co-co vnsel.
Franklin said, "We're going to try to
recreate the reality of the movement,
so people can really understand where
we're coming from."
Other Side
He promises to show "that we're not
a bunch of crazies bent on looney acts
of destruction. The mindlessness is
going to be on the other side."
And he insisted, "We're going to
prove scientifically that some of their
witnesses are lying."
Franklin and Fisher will approach
the Board today with very different
ideas about how to keep Franklin's
arguments from extending far beyond
the 10 days that Fisher took. Franklin
threatens to call all of 226 witnesses
unless the Board eliminates many
details introduced by the
administration witnesses. He said it will
require months to give his version of
such "irrelevant" details as exactly
what happened inside a Computation
Center shutdown which Franklin
allegedly provoked.
'Anarchistic' Argument
Fisher instead wants to eliminate as
"irrelevant" evidence concerning the
Nuremberg Principle and Stanford's
complicity in the Vietnam War. Fisher
said Franklin's arguments that he acted
to prevent war crimes is " anarchistic.

That would just result in a lot of ad hoc
judgments by a lot of people."
Even when Franklin's defense is
complete, the hearing will have at least
another week to go. Final arguments
will be followed by rebuttal and
testimony from "rebuttal witnesses."
Then, the Advisory Board will at last
be left with thousands of pages of
testimony and the problem of deciding
whether there is "substantial evidence"
that Franklin committed acts which
violated his "appropriate function" in
the academic community.
Fisher said the administration case
will prove itself when "the real crunch
comes," during the Board's study of
the evidence. But Franklin is sure that
he has already won.
