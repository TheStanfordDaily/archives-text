## Despair In The Northwest 
### Don Tollefson 
For most of the 1 960 's, life
was pretty good for University of
Washington football teams and
their young coach Jim Owens.
The decade began with the
Huskies winning the '60 and '61
Rose Bowls over Wisconsin and
Minnesota after having compiled
identical 9-1 regular season
records. Washington lost to
Illinois in the '64 Rose Bowl, but
between '60 and '67, the Huskies
had a regular season record of
49-28-3.
Then in 1968, Washington's
fortunes changed. The Huskies
dropped to 3-7 in '68 and 1-9
in '69. Problems were also
occurring off the field. Charges of
racism were made against Owens
and members of his staff.
Dissension was strong and a
number of blacks quit the squad.
But even when they were
having very serious problems, the
fans still turned out to support
the team. Seattle doesn't have a
pro football team and their pro
baseball and basketball teams have
'been only recent additions to the
local sports scene. So during the
thin years the fans were still there
in large numbers "waiting for next
year."
Sixkiller Arrives
In 19 70 a young Oregonian
Indian named Sonny Sixkiller
entered the picture. Eight black
players quit this squad, but
Sixkiller led Washington to a 6-4
record and a second place league
finish. The sophomore completed
186 of 362 passes for 2,303 yards
and 15 touchdowns. The fans
could hardly wait for '71.
And this season started off
very successfully. The racial
problems have either been solved
or are no longer «ery public. So
behind Sixkiller's arm,
Washington won their first four

games easily, averaging nearly 4 5
points and gaining over 450 yards
a game. The opponents (Santa
Barbara, Texas Christian, Purdue,
Illinois) hadn't been that tough,
but the statistics were incredible.
Sixkiller had completed 54 of 106
passes for 94 9 yards and eight
touchdowns.
It wasn't too much of a shock
on Friday to discover that Seattle
was a city pretty crazy about
Washington football. Stores sold
"Sonny Sixkiller Headbands."
And almost everyone was talking
about Saturday's game. Most
Seattleans thought Washington
would win.
No Tickets
If you didn't have a ticket on
Friday, your chances ol seeing the
game were very slim. The personal
column of the want ads in a
Friday paper was filled with ads
from people wanting tickets.
Tickets were reportedly being
scalped for up to $50 or $60, but
even at that price, people claimed
they were hard to buy.
Around 11 :30, the fog was so
thick in the stadium that it was
difficult to see the field from the
press box. One reason was that
the press box is about two miles
and a three minute elevator ride
above the field. It is probably the
only press box in which reporters
have to get depressurized before
leaving so that they don't get the
bends on the way down.
After lunch, the fog burned
off. It was a beautiful Saturday in
the Great Northwest. The 60,77 7
fans who set a new stadium record
finished their tailgaters in their
cars or boats and got ready for the
game. When the Huskies appeared
in their purple and gold uniforms,
the noise was very, very loud. It
got louder when they won the
toss.

Now Sonny was supposed to
pass his way down the field,
across the sound and end up in
Pasadena. But something
happened. Somebody threw out
the movie script. Over and over
again, the Stanford defense kept
Sixkiller from going anywhere. He
ended up spending almost as
much time looking up into the
blue Seattle sky as he did looking
into the Stanford end zone.
At around 4:30, Sixkiller's
mouth and face expressed the
disappointment the day had
brought. The bruised and bitter
quarterback even had trouble
ripping the tape off his socks in
the lockeroom. It wasn't Sonny's
day. It wasn't Seattle's day.
Owens talked about how he
agreed that no team would go
through the league season with
only one loss. But he knew they
had lost a really big one. With
USC losing to Oregon on Saturday
night, a win by Stanford over the
Trojans this Saturday would make
the Indians heavy favorites to
make it to Pasadena again.
Poetically, it should be raining
today in Seattle.

into the Stanford end zone.
At around 4:30, Sixkiller's
mouth and face expressed the
disappointment the day had
brought. The bruised and bitter
quarterback even had trouble
ripping the tape off his socks in
the lockeroom. It wasn't Sonny's
day. It wasn't Seattle's day.
Owens talked about how he
agreed that no team would go
through the league season with
only one loss. But he knew they
had lost a really big one. With
USC losing to Oregon on Saturday
night, a win by Stanford over the
Trojans this Saturday would make
the Indians heavy favorites to
make it to Pasadena again.
Poetically, it should be raining
today in Seattle.
For most of the 1 960 's, life
was pretty good for University of
Washington football teams and
their young coach Jim Owens.
The decade began with the
Huskies winning the '60 and '61
Rose Bowls over Wisconsin and
Minnesota after having compiled
identical 9-1 regular season
records. Washington lost to
Illinois in the '64 Rose Bowl, but
between '60 and '67, the Huskies
had a regular season record of
49-28-3.
Then in 1968, Washington's
fortunes changed. The Huskies
dropped to 3-7 in '68 and 1-9
in '69. Problems were also
occurring off the field. Charges of
racism were made against Owens
and members of his staff.
Dissension was strong and a
number of blacks quit the squad.
But even when they were
having very serious problems, the
fans still turned out to support
the team. Seattle doesn't have a
pro football team and their pro
baseball and basketball teams have
'been only recent additions to the
local sports scene. So during the
thin years the fans were still there
in large numbers "waiting for next
year."
Sixkiller Arrives
In 19 70 a young Oregonian
Indian named Sonny Sixkiller
entered the picture. Eight black
players quit this squad, but
Sixkiller led Washington to a 6-4
record and a second place league
finish. The sophomore completed
186 of 362 passes for 2,303 yards
and 15 touchdowns. The fans
could hardly wait for '71.
And this season started off
very successfully. The racial
problems have either been solved
or are no longer «ery public. So
behind Sixkiller's arm,
Washington won their first four

games easily, averaging nearly 4 5
points and gaining over 450 yards
a game. The opponents (Santa
Barbara, Texas Christian, Purdue,
Illinois) hadn't been that tough,
but the statistics were incredible.
Sixkiller had completed 54 of 106
passes for 94 9 yards and eight
touchdowns.
It wasn't too much of a shock
on Friday to discover that Seattle
was a city pretty crazy about
Washington football. Stores sold
"Sonny Sixkiller Headbands."
And almost everyone was talking
about Saturday's game. Most
Seattleans thought Washington
would win.
No Tickets
If you didn't have a ticket on
Friday, your chances ol seeing the
game were very slim. The personal
column of the want ads in a
Friday paper was filled with ads
from people wanting tickets.
Tickets were reportedly being
scalped for up to $50 or $60, but
even at that price, people claimed
they were hard to buy.
Around 11 :30, the fog was so
thick in the stadium that it was
difficult to see the field from the
press box. One reason was that
the press box is about two miles
and a three minute elevator ride
above the field. It is probably the
only press box in which reporters
have to get depressurized before
leaving so that they don't get the
bends on the way down.
After lunch, the fog burned
off. It was a beautiful Saturday in
the Great Northwest. The 60,77 7
fans who set a new stadium record
finished their tailgaters in their
cars or boats and got ready for the
game. When the Huskies appeared
in their purple and gold uniforms,
the noise was very, very loud. It
got louder when they won the
toss.

Now Sonny was supposed to
pass his way down the field,
across the sound and end up in
Pasadena. But something
happened. Somebody threw out
the movie script. Over and over
again, the Stanford defense kept
Sixkiller from going anywhere. He
ended up spending almost as
much time looking up into the
blue Seattle sky as he did looking
into the Stanford end zone.

the Great Northwest. The 60,77 7
fans who set a new stadium record
finished their tailgaters in their
cars or boats and got ready for the
game. When the Huskies appeared
in their purple and gold uniforms,
the noise was very, very loud. It
got louder when they won the
toss.

Now Sonny was supposed to
pass his way down the field,
across the sound and end up in
Pasadena. But something
happened. Somebody threw out
the movie script. Over and over
again, the Stanford defense kept
Sixkiller from going anywhere. He
ended up spending almost as
much time looking up into the
blue Seattle sky as he did looking
into the Stanford end zone.
At around 4:30, Sixkiller's
mouth and face expressed the
disappointment the day had
brought. The bruised and bitter
quarterback even had trouble
ripping the tape off his socks in
the lockeroom. It wasn't Sonny's
day. It wasn't Seattle's day.
Owens talked about how he
agreed that no team would go
through the league season with
only one loss. But he knew they
had lost a really big one. With
USC losing to Oregon on Saturday
night, a win by Stanford over the
Trojans this Saturday would make
the Indians heavy favorites to
make it to Pasadena again.
Poetically, it should be raining
today in Seattle.
