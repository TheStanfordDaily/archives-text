McCloskey Campaigns
EXETER, N.H. - Rep. Paul N. McCloskey Jr. of
California, who seeks to wrest the Republican
presidential nomination from President Nixon in
1972, said Saturday he would be willing to run with a
black running mate.
Speaking to a crowd in the town square,
McCloskey was asked what he thought about Maine
Sen. Kdmund S. Muskie's statement that he did not
think a black could be elected a vice president at this
time.
"1 can only say what I said when they first told
me," McCloskey replied. "If Ed Brooke (U.S. Sen.
Edward W. Brooke, R-Mass.) was willing to run as my
vice president I'd be honored to have him and I
would be glad to run as his vice president.
"I think race doesn't mean much any more, I
don't think party means much any more. I think
people are looking for the best human being, man or
woman."
In response to another question, McCloskey said
he voted to end student deferment in the draft "for
this reason: what was happening was that if a person
did not get a good primary and secondary education,
elementary and high school, he couldn't get into
college and the end result is that the people who grow
up in the poverty areas and can't get into college were
forming the bulk of the draftees. And for this reason
it wasn't fair."
The Californian said he voted no a year ago on a
proposed constitutional amendment to protect the
rights of women because "the amendment did not
just give equal rights to women; it ended all
distinctions between sexes. And I don't think that is
right. There are certain distinctions that I think are
worth preserving. . .
"What we're trying to end is discrimination—jobs,
job opportunities, employment advancement, equal

pay, educational opportunity. That sums up what
women are upset about, most of them."
McCloskey was asked if he thought President
Nixon's projected trip to Peking would cause
Nationalist China to lose its seat in the United
Nations.
"Well, regardless of the trip, I think we are now
pledged to get mainland China the seat on the
Security Council,"he replied. "Whether or not that
costs Nationalist China its seat in the U.N. total I
would doubt very much."
Cops Kill Ex-Panther
DENVER — An expelled member of the Black
Panther Party was shot and killed by police Saturday
night after he reportedly stabbed three women,
knocked down one officer with a panel tmck and
exchanged shots with officers.
He was identified as James A. Young, 30, of
Denver, listed by police as early as 1965 as
"dangerous. . .especially to law enforcement
officers."
Bishops Debate Celibacy
VATICAN CITY - A succession of cardinals and
bishops faced Pope Paul VI i" the World Bishop's
Synod Saturday and asked him to allow married men
to become priests. Others pleaded for total priestly
celibacy.
As the pontiff sat without responding, Dutch
Cardinal Bernard Jan Alfrink declared: "Marriage is
not repugnant to the priesthood."
He asked: "What is better, to preach the gospel
with the help also of married men, or not to preach it
at all?"
A Malaysian bishop warned the Pope that an
"authoritarian refusal" by him of local demands for

the ordination of married men would have
"catastrophic consequences."
The Pope sat through the speeches of 21 members
in the 10-day World Synod of Bishops. He did not
take the floor himself.
The speakers seemed evenly divided between those
seeking the ordination of married men—in some parts
of the world and those who wanted this forbidden.
Most of the 209 delegates have been reported
opposed to letting men marry once they are priests.
Chicanos Oppose Nominee

Banuelos nfter federal immigration agents last week

Angeles food processing plant.

nominated for the Supreme Court.

on the matter, although he would not submit Byrd's
name for nomination if he were president. McGovern

McCloskey Campaigns
EXETER, N.H. - Rep. Paul N. McCloskey Jr. of
California, who seeks to wrest the Republican
presidential nomination from President Nixon in
1972, said Saturday he would be willing to run with a
black running mate.
Speaking to a crowd in the town square,
McCloskey was asked what he thought about Maine
Sen. Kdmund S. Muskie's statement that he did not
think a black could be elected a vice president at this
time.
"1 can only say what I said when they first told
me," McCloskey replied. "If Ed Brooke (U.S. Sen.
Edward W. Brooke, R-Mass.) was willing to run as my
vice president I'd be honored to have him and I
would be glad to run as his vice president.
"I think race doesn't mean much any more, I
don't think party means much any more. I think
people are looking for the best human being, man or
woman."
In response to another question, McCloskey said
he voted to end student deferment in the draft "for
this reason: what was happening was that if a person
did not get a good primary and secondary education,
elementary and high school, he couldn't get into
college and the end result is that the people who grow
up in the poverty areas and can't get into college were
forming the bulk of the draftees. And for this reason
it wasn't fair."
The Californian said he voted no a year ago on a
proposed constitutional amendment to protect the
rights of women because "the amendment did not
just give equal rights to women; it ended all
distinctions between sexes. And I don't think that is
right. There are certain distinctions that I think are
worth preserving. . .
"What we're trying to end is discrimination—jobs,
job opportunities, employment advancement, equal

pay, educational opportunity. That sums up what
women are upset about, most of them."
McCloskey was asked if he thought President
Nixon's projected trip to Peking would cause
Nationalist China to lose its seat in the United
Nations.
"Well, regardless of the trip, I think we are now
pledged to get mainland China the seat on the
Security Council,"he replied. "Whether or not that
costs Nationalist China its seat in the U.N. total I
would doubt very much."

Bishops Debate Celibacy
VATICAN CITY - A succession of cardinals and
bishops faced Pope Paul VI i" the World Bishop's
Synod Saturday and asked him to allow married men
to become priests. Others pleaded for total priestly
celibacy.
As the pontiff sat without responding, Dutch
Cardinal Bernard Jan Alfrink declared: "Marriage is
not repugnant to the priesthood."
He asked: "What is better, to preach the gospel
with the help also of married men, or not to preach it
at all?"
A Malaysian bishop warned the Pope that an
"authoritarian refusal" by him of local demands for

the ordination of married men would have
"catastrophic consequences."
The Pope sat through the speeches of 21 members
in the 10-day World Synod of Bishops. He did not
take the floor himself.
The speakers seemed evenly divided between those
seeking the ordination of married men—in some parts
of the world and those who wanted this forbidden.
Most of the 209 delegates have been reported
opposed to letting men marry once they are priests.
