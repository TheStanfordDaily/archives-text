# Overseas Week
## 
### 
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday of
this week, White Plaza will be the scene
of an informational program for
Overseas Campuses Week. The center of
this activity, sponsored by the Overseas
Campuses Board, will be a pavilion
located near Tresidder Union.
The Overseas Campuses Board,
composed of former students from
Stanford's overseas campuses, has
arranged to have slide showings,
posters, music, and a variety of
booklets and handouts.

In order to concentrate on each
campus more effectively, each day will
be oriented towards one part of the
overseas campus program. The schedule
is as follows: Monday—the British
overseas campus and the
Programs in Spain, Italy, Mexico,
Germany, and France; Tuesday—the
overseas campuses in Italy and France;
Wednesday—the German and Austrian
campuses. The programs will run from
10 a.m. to 2 p.m. each day.
