# Water You Say?
## University Legalizes Wetbedding 
### 
Stanford is fraught with many lurking temptations and
dangers which threaten the moral fiber of our God-fearing,
upright Youth, the Daily learned recently.
And yet another sensual and seductive pleasure has
insinuated itself into the minds and hearts of Stanford
students.
This one, however, has the unusual quality of being
legal. Stanford University has officially allowed the
presence of the demon Waterbed on campus. (If they are in
a frame, heating units are approved, and the owner agrees
to be responsible for damages resulting from leaks.)
Unlike the University of Pennsylvania, which recently
banished the waterbed from campus, or the University of
Michigan, which requires a $200 deposit for possession of a

waterbed, Stanford has allowed students in University
housing to possess, alas, to use the waterbed.
Alan Cummings, Director of Residences, reports that
structural specifications indicate that University residences
are easily capable of supporting the massive weight of a
waterbed. Pride goeth before a fall, Mr. Cummings: the
average weight of a mature waterbed is 9300 lbs.
Historically Speaking
Historically, the waterbed was intended to serve the
cause of Good. During World War 11, British hospitals used
the waterbed to promote the healing of bed sores and to
ease the pain of burn victims.
But only in the last two or three years has a veritable
boom in water beds occurred, and waterbed stores have
sprung up like toadstools all across our nation.
Waterbed addicts admit that their embryonic journeys
are not without price. One owner sprained his neck while
atop his bed, and another (obviously not a Stanford
student) complained that sex was nearly impossible on one.
He also stated that filling his liquid lovenest was a
time-consuming process, which leads one to wonder
precisely what he was filling it with (molasses, perhaps?).
Still, these same persons maintain that the waterbed
affords a more luxurious and complete slumber, and that it
serves a social function, luring many of the innocent into
their rooms.
The waterbed has only been in widespread use for
several years, and caution and discretion is advised for
those who must possess the waterbed. It should be
remembered that only time will tell whether or not the
violent rippling action of the waterbed does indeed cause
chromosome breakage.
