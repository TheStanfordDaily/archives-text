# Congressional Amendment Weakens Anti-Sexism Bill
## 
### 
A House bill to prevent sex
discrimination in co-educational
colleges and universities which is being
considered by Congress this fall has
been amended to exempt "the
under-graduate admissions policy of
any institution of higher education."
The bill, as originally designed by
Representative Edith Green
(Dem.-Ore.), would have required that
Stanford abolish its 40 percent ceiling
on undergraduate women's admission
within five years or forfeit federal
funds. As amended, the bill would
apply only to graduate school
admissions and teacher salaries.
The amendment was passed after an
anti-sexist rider on an educational
appropriations bill was defeated by the
House because of fears that it might
force admission of women to military
schools.
"This type of amendment is a
well-known device used by a decreasing
number of men who would like to
hatchet efforts for women to obtain
equal citizenship," said Dr. Nancy
Jewell Cross, Stanford alimna and
plaintiff in the case of Cross and Crouse
vs. Stanford University.
Court Decision Nears
Dr. Cross and Linda Crouse, a
systems programmer at the Medical
Center, filed a suit against the
University last April which challenges
alleged sexist-racist policies in
Stanford's admissions, employment,
and financial aid distribution. "A court
decision will probably be reached
within a few weeks," said Dr. Cross.
She noted that the House
Anti-Discrimination Bill is not an
entirely new concept in equal rights.
She cited the 14 th Amendment, the
1 96 4 Civil Rights Act: title seven, the
California Fair Employment Practice

Act and the California State
Constitution as all containing reasons
for non-sexist University policy.
The bill, to be considered by
Congress this fall, would be for
Stanford the latest development in a
series of changing sentiments and rules
concerning University women.
Stanford's founding grant states,
"The trustees shall have power and it
shall be their duty ... to afford equal
facilities and give equal advantages in
the University to both sexes." In 1 933,
the trustees passed a resolution limiting
the total enrollment of women to 4 0
percent.
In 1 957 , Dr. Cross began writing to
trustees, and in 19 70 petitioning in the
community to revise University
policies.
This year, Stanford has established a
committee to study the status of
women in the University and what the
impact of the admission of more
women would be.
Change Here?
"As long as the Mouse bill does not
establish a 50-50 quota system,
Stanford's general admission ratio
might not be altered," said Dean Fred
Hargadon of admissions.
Hargadon noted that the percentage
of women accepted to Stanford is only
slightly lower than that of women
applicants, because "a large percentage
of the women accepted enrolls."
"It's hard to say if a no-quota
system would encourage more women
to apply. Our total number of freshman
applications went down this last year,"
he added.
Hargadon cited housing, student
distribution among departments, and
changes in the use of facilities and
instructors as possible problems
concerning increased women
enrollment.

anti-sexist rider on an educational
appropriations bill was defeated by the
House because of fears that it might
force admission of women to military
schools.
"This type of amendment is a
well-known device used by a decreasing
number of men who would like to
hatchet efforts for women to obtain
equal citizenship," said Dr. Nancy
Jewell Cross, Stanford alimna and
plaintiff in the case of Cross and Crouse
vs. Stanford University.
Court Decision Nears
Dr. Cross and Linda Crouse, a
systems programmer at the Medical
Center, filed a suit against the
University last April which challenges
alleged sexist-racist policies in
Stanford's admissions, employment,
and financial aid distribution. "A court
decision will probably be reached
within a few weeks," said Dr. Cross.
She noted that the House
Anti-Discrimination Bill is not an
entirely new concept in equal rights.
She cited the 14 th Amendment, the
1 96 4 Civil Rights Act: title seven, the
California Fair Employment Practice

Act and the California State
Constitution as all containing reasons
for non-sexist University policy.
The bill, to be considered by
Congress this fall, would be for
Stanford the latest development in a
series of changing sentiments and rules
concerning University women.
Stanford's founding grant states,
"The trustees shall have power and it
shall be their duty ... to afford equal
facilities and give equal advantages in
the University to both sexes." In 1 933,
the trustees passed a resolution limiting
the total enrollment of women to 4 0
percent.
In 1 957 , Dr. Cross began writing to
trustees, and in 19 70 petitioning in the
community to revise University
policies.
This year, Stanford has established a
committee to study the status of
women in the University and what the
impact of the admission of more
women would be.
Change Here?
"As long as the Mouse bill does not
establish a 50-50 quota system,
Stanford's general admission ratio
might not be altered," said Dean Fred
Hargadon of admissions.
Hargadon noted that the percentage
of women accepted to Stanford is only
slightly lower than that of women
applicants, because "a large percentage
of the women accepted enrolls."
"It's hard to say if a no-quota
system would encourage more women
to apply. Our total number of freshman
applications went down this last year,"
he added.
Hargadon cited housing, student
distribution among departments, and
changes in the use of facilities and
instructors as possible problems
concerning increased women
enrollment.
A House bill to prevent sex
discrimination in co-educational
colleges and universities which is being
considered by Congress this fall has
been amended to exempt "the
under-graduate admissions policy of
any institution of higher education."
The bill, as originally designed by
Representative Edith Green
(Dem.-Ore.), would have required that
Stanford abolish its 40 percent ceiling
on undergraduate women's admission
within five years or forfeit federal
funds. As amended, the bill would
apply only to graduate school
admissions and teacher salaries.
The amendment was passed after an
anti-sexist rider on an educational
appropriations bill was defeated by the
House because of fears that it might
force admission of women to military
schools.
