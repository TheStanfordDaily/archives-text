# Stanford Grads Find More Jobs Than Most
## 
### JAN FELDMAN 
Stanford's graduates are faring
better in the tight job market than
most college graduates, according to
Ralph W. Keller, placement director.
He attributes this success to the
prestige of Stanford, its highly selected
body of students and their exposure to
a good faculty.
"Our graduates are flexible," he
said. "Their intuitive qualities can often
overcome any lack of technical
competence in a field."
Stanford graduates have rated on
top in recent studies of employee-job
compatability, made by the Western
College Placement Association, of
which Keller is a member.
Fewer Job Recruiters
Although he is optimistic about
permanent placement of graduates,
Keller admitted that only about 185
job recruiters will visit the campus this
year, compared to 4 56 three years ago.
He predicted that students will
probably receive only three or four job

offers instead of the 10 choices
graduates once expected.
He anticipates possible placement
problems in the teaching field, where
limited school budgets are causing
reductions in hiring, and in the
biological sciences, where there is a job
shortage. However, Keller feels that
Stanford graduates will find
employment even in these fields.
The basic philosophy of the Career
Planning and Placement Center is "to
provde service in response to the needs
of each individual student," Keller said.
The addition of a Director of
Humanities Placement was a significant
and successful step in planning careers
for liberal arts students whose needs are
"less well defined than those of
graduates of the other schools," he
said.
Minority Needs
The Center is now engaged in a
study to determine the specific
counseling needs of minority students
who will be graduating in significant
numbers for the first time this year.
Last year the Center put in 3,000
hours of individual career counseling
and approximately 5,000 hours of
group counseling. The annual report to
be compiled by December, will show
the detailed results of this work,
including the place of employment of
each graduate.
A 60 percent return on a survey of
seniors prepared by the Academic
Information Center showed that while
28 percent of last year's male graduates
and 39 percent of women graduates
will start work this fall, 50 percent of
the men and 41 percent of the women
will enter graduate school.
80& To Grad School
Keller said that traditionally 80
percent of the entire class goes on to
graduate school. There is a recent trend
toward working for a year or two
before obtaining a doctora' degree, he
noted.
Most graduate schools are accepting
fewer doctoral candidates, as the
supply of M.A.'s and Ph.D.'s exceeds
the demand.
Some graduates blame
overqualification for their job
problems. One student commented that
the reasons for obtaining a doctoral
degree are not economic. "The
University is being transformed back to
the original educational concept of an
academy," he said.
Keller said that the problem of
overqualification can only be solved by
preparing graduate students for jobs on
a more appropriate level. Graduate
schools are now in the process of
adjusting their programs to provide
more emphasis on the technical and
vocational, rather than the theoretical
aspects of education, he observed.
Keller stressed that helping students
with their future plans is an integral
part of the University's function and
not just an appendage to the
educational process.
He urged all students to visit the
Placement Center early in their
academic career to examine the
opportunities available to them after
graduation.

him be dismissed. If this fails, the Marxist scholar says he may be forced to call

Keller admitted that only about 185
job recruiters will visit the campus this
year, compared to 4 56 three years ago.
He predicted that students will
probably receive only three or four job

offers instead of the 10 choices
graduates once expected.
He anticipates possible placement
problems in the teaching field, where
limited school budgets are causing
reductions in hiring, and in the
biological sciences, where there is a job
shortage. However, Keller feels that
Stanford graduates will find
employment even in these fields.
The basic philosophy of the Career
Planning and Placement Center is "to
provde service in response to the needs
of each individual student," Keller said.
The addition of a Director of
Humanities Placement was a significant
and successful step in planning careers
for liberal arts students whose needs are
"less well defined than those of
graduates of the other schools," he
said.
Minority Needs
The Center is now engaged in a
study to determine the specific
counseling needs of minority students
who will be graduating in significant
numbers for the first time this year.
Last year the Center put in 3,000
hours of individual career counseling
and approximately 5,000 hours of
group counseling. The annual report to
be compiled by December, will show
the detailed results of this work,
including the place of employment of
each graduate.
A 60 percent return on a survey of
seniors prepared by the Academic
Information Center showed that while
28 percent of last year's male graduates
and 39 percent of women graduates
will start work this fall, 50 percent of
the men and 41 percent of the women
will enter graduate school.
80& To Grad School
Keller said that traditionally 80
percent of the entire class goes on to
graduate school. There is a recent trend
toward working for a year or two
before obtaining a doctora' degree, he
noted.
Most graduate schools are accepting
fewer doctoral candidates, as the
supply of M.A.'s and Ph.D.'s exceeds
the demand.
Some graduates blame
overqualification for their job
problems. One student commented that
the reasons for obtaining a doctoral
degree are not economic. "The
University is being transformed back to
the original educational concept of an
academy," he said.
Keller said that the problem of
overqualification can only be solved by
preparing graduate students for jobs on
a more appropriate level. Graduate
schools are now in the process of
adjusting their programs to provide
more emphasis on the technical and
vocational, rather than the theoretical
aspects of education, he observed.
Keller stressed that helping students
with their future plans is an integral
part of the University's function and
not just an appendage to the
educational process.
He urged all students to visit the
Placement Center early in their
academic career to examine the
opportunities available to them after
graduation.

DEFENSE—Suspended English Professor H. Bruce Franklin, here seen standing at
the postered defense table, will begin his defense today against charges of
misconduct as a professor. Franklin says he plans to move that all c'larges against
him be dismissed. If this fails, the Marxist scholar says he may be forced to call
226 witnesses. Seen standing with Franklin at the defense table is fellow
Venceremos Central Committee member Aaron Manganiello.
Stanford's graduates are faring
better in the tight job market than
most college graduates, according to
Ralph W. Keller, placement director.
He attributes this success to the
prestige of Stanford, its highly selected
body of students and their exposure to
a good faculty.
"Our graduates are flexible," he
said. "Their intuitive qualities can often
overcome any lack of technical
competence in a field."
Stanford graduates have rated on
top in recent studies of employee-job
compatability, made by the Western
College Placement Association, of
which Keller is a member.

permanent placement of graduates,
Keller admitted that only about 185
job recruiters will visit the campus this
