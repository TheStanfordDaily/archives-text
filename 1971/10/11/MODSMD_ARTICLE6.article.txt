## Lawyers Argue Against Nuremberg Defense 
### 
Editor's Note: Following is the first part of the
"University's objection to admission of evidence
by Bruce Franklin bearing on a defense based on
->Nuremberg or Necessity. This argument was
submitted to Franklin's Advisory Hoard hearing
Friday by Stanford Attorney Raymond Fisher.
M Part Two will appear tomorrow.
Professor Franklin defends his actions by
raising two interrelated defenses: Nuremberg and
"necessity and justification." Professor Franklin
has refused to elaborate on his defense. However,
'it must be that he will argue that Nuremberg
established a defense to offenses against the state
_ or other entities, and possibly that he had a duty
"to act as he did. Professor Franklin will no doubt
proffer evidence in support of his so-called
Nuremberg and necessity defenses. However,
these defenses, as a matter of law, either do not
exist or are not applicable to this proceeding.
The Board should therefore refuse to accept
evidence relating to war crimes in Vietnam or
Stanford's alleged complicity in them.
I. Nuremberg "Defense"
There is no defense available to Professor
Franklin arising out of the Nuremberg principles,
and any attempt to construct such a defense by
the development of new and novel principles
threatens anarchy, both in the society at large
and on the campus.
Nuremberg did not establish so much a legal
defense as three novel prosecutorial principles.
The Nuremberg tribunal held, for the first time,
that the civil heads of government could be held
responsible for war crimes committed by their
states:
"The official position of defenders, whether
as Heads of State or responsible officials in
Government departments, shall not be
considered as freeing them from
responsibility ..." (Charter of the International
Military Tribunal, quoted in Ferencz, War Crimes

Law and the Vietnam War, 17 American
University L. Rev. 403,409 (1 968 ).)
The second innovation of Nuremberg was to
deny under international law the defense of
"superior orders":
"The fact that defendant acted pursuant to
order of his government or of a superior shall not
free him from responsibility but may be
considered in mitigation of punishment, if the
Tribunal determines that justice so requires." (Id.
at 409).
The third innovation at Nuremberg was to
expand the definition of war crimes beyond
traditional boundaries. In addition to "war
crimes," which consisted of violating the Rules
of Land Warfare or other military conventions,
the Nuremberg Tribunal added "Crimes Against
Peace (which includes wars of aggression)" and
"Crimes Against Humanity (which includes
enslavement and genocide)." (Id. at 405-06.)
What Nuremberg Did Not Establish
Nuremberg did not establish that citizens in
non-directory positions could be punished for
failing to stop war crimes, but only those in
directory positions. "Directory" positions were
narrowly defined. Thus, of the tens of thousands
involved in civil government in Germany and
Japan, and the millions in the armed forces, only
15 Germans and 24 Japanese were convicted of
planning or waging aggressive war. Fifty-nine
Germans were acquitted of the charge. Taylor,
Nuremberg and Vietnam: An American Tragedy
pp. 87-88 (1969 ).
Nor did Nuremberg establish that criminal
acts intended to stop war crimes could be
defended against by raising the "necessity" of
preventing war crimes.
Some have argued that both propositions

should be implemented as a natural extension of
the Nuremberg innovations. Yet both would raise
enormous problems for society and for the
university community in particular.
The proposition that ordinary citizens should
be punished for failing to stop war crimes is
unlikely to be implemented so long as the guilty
nation retains its sovereignty. For no government
will punish its own citizens for their failure to
object to government policy. In reality, such
punishments could only occur when—as in the
case of Germany after World War ll—a nation has
temporarily lost its sovereignty to others. And,
of course, even if the principle is accepted by a
conquering nation, it is difficult to know just
what "acts" by citizens would constitute
attempts to stop war crimes. Would voting
against the party in power be sufficient? Would
the citizen be required to refuse to pay taxes or
serve in the armed forces? Or would positive acts,
such as sabotage or assassination, be required in
order to absolve him of guilt?
The same difficulty would arise in attempting
to apply the principle of citizen punishment to
the university community. Universities
contribute to a country's strength in many ways,
and, therefore, inevitably contribute to its
military potential. Would absolution from war
guilt come from opposing only activities which
contribute directly to offensive war capabilities
or would members of the academic community
need to oppose any and all activities which
contribute in any way to military strength—such
as much medical research?
The second proposition, that citizens may
raise "war crimes" as a defense to criminal acts,
is also fraught with difficulty. A country which
maintains its sovereignty cannot be expected to
permit the defense to crimes of

commission—especially when those crimes result
in physical harm to others. Allowing such a
defense would leave the criminal code a
shambles—crime would be defined only by
individual conscience, and anarchy would result.
Adoption of such a principle at Stanford
would bring about a kind of academic anarchy. A
small group, acting under the direction of its own
conscience, would determine who could and
could not speak here. And it is by no means clear
that only "establishment" speakers would be
affected. There is great diversity of opinion on
the campus, and there are doubtless groups who
feel that other sorts of speakers have committed
one crime or another. Nor would anarchy be
limited to speakers. The principle Professor
Franklin seems to embrace would give
self-declared tribunals the right to disrupt any
university facility which they had determined to
be in violation of some principle of international
law. Such a principle cannot logically be
confined to research. Classroom activity, too,
might fall under the jurisdiction of the
self-proclaimed war crimes tribunals which would
be roving the com pus.
In other words, if Professor Franklin and
others may disrupt the Lodge speech because
they have "convicted" Lodge of war crimes or
shut down the Computation Center because they
have "determined" that it does war research, no
activity on the Stanford campus will be immune
to such ad hoc judgments in the future. The
Board must recognize, therefore, that the
acceptance here of the mythical "Nuremberg"
defenses would be a clear invitation to many
groups to shut down, harass and disrupt the
entire range of the University's activities, from
teaching to research to public events.

Nuremberg, in reality, created no defenses. It
did, however, strengthen a previously existing
defense: a defense to crimes of omission. A
person ordered to commit a war crime may
refuse to do so and defend on the ground that he
would have been committing a war crime had he
complied with the order. Thus, a soldier ordered
to shoot a prisoner might refuse and raise as a
defense for failure to obey orders the
international treaty which prohibits the killing of
prisoners.
Such a defense was accepted, on principle, in
the trial of Captain Howard Levy. However, it
was disallowed because Levy could not show a
direct relation between what he was asked to do
(train medics) and the war crimes he sought to
prove. Judgment at Fort Jackson: The
Court-Martial of Captain Howard B. Levy, 4 Law
in Transition Quarterly 123, 146-147 (1967 ).
Thus, a citizen who would raise the Nuremberg
principle in defense must be able to show a direct
connection between his coerced acts and a war
crime in order successfully to raise a defense to a
crime of omission.
Professor Franklin cannot raise a defense by
relying on Nuremberg because none of its
prosecutorial principles apply to him. He is not a
director of the country so as to be exposed to
war-crimes guilt under the Nuremberg principles.
Nor would he face punishment for failure to
oppose alleged war crimes since Nuremberg
requires no such intervention of ordinary
citizens.
Finally, Professor Franklin cannot raise the
older defense to crimes of omission. He has not
shown and cannot show that he was being forced
directly to contribute to or participate in war
crimes.

submitted to Franklin's Advisory Hoard hearing
Friday by Stanford Attorney Raymond Fisher.
M Part Two will appear tomorrow.
Professor Franklin defends his actions by
raising two interrelated defenses: Nuremberg and
"necessity and justification." Professor Franklin
has refused to elaborate on his defense. However,
'it must be that he will argue that Nuremberg
established a defense to offenses against the state
_ or other entities, and possibly that he had a duty
"to act as he did. Professor Franklin will no doubt
proffer evidence in support of his so-called
Nuremberg and necessity defenses. However,
these defenses, as a matter of law, either do not
exist or are not applicable to this proceeding.
The Board should therefore refuse to accept
evidence relating to war crimes in Vietnam or
Stanford's alleged complicity in them.
I. Nuremberg "Defense"
There is no defense available to Professor
Franklin arising out of the Nuremberg principles,
and any attempt to construct such a defense by
the development of new and novel principles
threatens anarchy, both in the society at large
and on the campus.
Nuremberg did not establish so much a legal
defense as three novel prosecutorial principles.
The Nuremberg tribunal held, for the first time,
that the civil heads of government could be held
responsible for war crimes committed by their
states:
"The official position of defenders, whether
as Heads of State or responsible officials in
Government departments, shall not be
considered as freeing them from
responsibility ..." (Charter of the International
Military Tribunal, quoted in Ferencz, War Crimes

Law and the Vietnam War, 17 American
University L. Rev. 403,409 (1 968 ).)
The second innovation of Nuremberg was to
deny under international law the defense of
"superior orders":
"The fact that defendant acted pursuant to
order of his government or of a superior shall not
free him from responsibility but may be
considered in mitigation of punishment, if the
Tribunal determines that justice so requires." (Id.
at 409).
The third innovation at Nuremberg was to
expand the definition of war crimes beyond
traditional boundaries. In addition to "war
crimes," which consisted of violating the Rules
of Land Warfare or other military conventions,
the Nuremberg Tribunal added "Crimes Against
Peace (which includes wars of aggression)" and
"Crimes Against Humanity (which includes
enslavement and genocide)." (Id. at 405-06.)
What Nuremberg Did Not Establish
Nuremberg did not establish that citizens in
non-directory positions could be punished for
failing to stop war crimes, but only those in
directory positions. "Directory" positions were
narrowly defined. Thus, of the tens of thousands
involved in civil government in Germany and
Japan, and the millions in the armed forces, only
15 Germans and 24 Japanese were convicted of
planning or waging aggressive war. Fifty-nine
Germans were acquitted of the charge. Taylor,
Nuremberg and Vietnam: An American Tragedy
pp. 87-88 (1969 ).
Nor did Nuremberg establish that criminal
acts intended to stop war crimes could be
defended against by raising the "necessity" of
preventing war crimes.
Some have argued that both propositions

should be implemented as a natural extension of
the Nuremberg innovations. Yet both would raise
enormous problems for society and for the
university community in particular.
The proposition that ordinary citizens should
be punished for failing to stop war crimes is
unlikely to be implemented so long as the guilty
nation retains its sovereignty. For no government
will punish its own citizens for their failure to
object to government policy. In reality, such
punishments could only occur when—as in the
case of Germany after World War ll—a nation has
temporarily lost its sovereignty to others. And,
of course, even if the principle is accepted by a
conquering nation, it is difficult to know just
what "acts" by citizens would constitute
attempts to stop war crimes. Would voting
against the party in power be sufficient? Would
the citizen be required to refuse to pay taxes or
serve in the armed forces? Or would positive acts,
such as sabotage or assassination, be required in
order to absolve him of guilt?
The same difficulty would arise in attempting
to apply the principle of citizen punishment to
the university community. Universities
contribute to a country's strength in many ways,
and, therefore, inevitably contribute to its
military potential. Would absolution from war
guilt come from opposing only activities which
contribute directly to offensive war capabilities
or would members of the academic community
need to oppose any and all activities which
contribute in any way to military strength—such
as much medical research?
The second proposition, that citizens may
raise "war crimes" as a defense to criminal acts,
is also fraught with difficulty. A country which
maintains its sovereignty cannot be expected to
permit the defense to crimes of

commission—especially when those crimes result
in physical harm to others. Allowing such a
defense would leave the criminal code a
shambles—crime would be defined only by
individual conscience, and anarchy would result.
Adoption of such a principle at Stanford
would bring about a kind of academic anarchy. A
small group, acting under the direction of its own
conscience, would determine who could and
could not speak here. And it is by no means clear
that only "establishment" speakers would be
affected. There is great diversity of opinion on
the campus, and there are doubtless groups who
feel that other sorts of speakers have committed
one crime or another. Nor would anarchy be
limited to speakers. The principle Professor
Franklin seems to embrace would give
self-declared tribunals the right to disrupt any
university facility which they had determined to
be in violation of some principle of international
law. Such a principle cannot logically be
confined to research. Classroom activity, too,
might fall under the jurisdiction of the
self-proclaimed war crimes tribunals which would
be roving the com pus.
In other words, if Professor Franklin and
others may disrupt the Lodge speech because
they have "convicted" Lodge of war crimes or
shut down the Computation Center because they
have "determined" that it does war research, no
activity on the Stanford campus will be immune
to such ad hoc judgments in the future. The
Board must recognize, therefore, that the
acceptance here of the mythical "Nuremberg"
defenses would be a clear invitation to many
groups to shut down, harass and disrupt the
entire range of the University's activities, from
teaching to research to public events.

Nuremberg, in reality, created no defenses. It
did, however, strengthen a previously existing
defense: a defense to crimes of omission. A
person ordered to commit a war crime may
refuse to do so and defend on the ground that he
would have been committing a war crime had he
complied with the order. Thus, a soldier ordered
to shoot a prisoner might refuse and raise as a
defense for failure to obey orders the
international treaty which prohibits the killing of
prisoners.
Such a defense was accepted, on principle, in
the trial of Captain Howard Levy. However, it
was disallowed because Levy could not show a
direct relation between what he was asked to do
(train medics) and the war crimes he sought to
prove. Judgment at Fort Jackson: The
Court-Martial of Captain Howard B. Levy, 4 Law
in Transition Quarterly 123, 146-147 (1967 ).
Thus, a citizen who would raise the Nuremberg
principle in defense must be able to show a direct
connection between his coerced acts and a war
crime in order successfully to raise a defense to a
crime of omission.
Professor Franklin cannot raise a defense by
relying on Nuremberg because none of its
prosecutorial principles apply to him. He is not a
director of the country so as to be exposed to
war-crimes guilt under the Nuremberg principles.
Nor would he face punishment for failure to
oppose alleged war crimes since Nuremberg
requires no such intervention of ordinary
citizens.
Finally, Professor Franklin cannot raise the
older defense to crimes of omission. He has not
shown and cannot show that he was being forced
directly to contribute to or participate in war
crimes.

"necessity and justification." Professor Franklin
has refused to elaborate on his defense. However,
'it must be that he will argue that Nuremberg
established a defense to offenses against the state
_ or other entities, and possibly that he had a duty
"to act as he did. Professor Franklin will no doubt
proffer evidence in support of his so-called
Nuremberg and necessity defenses. However,
these defenses, as a matter of law, either do not
exist or are not applicable to this proceeding.
The Board should therefore refuse to accept
evidence relating to war crimes in Vietnam or
Stanford's alleged complicity in them.
I. Nuremberg "Defense"
There is no defense available to Professor
Franklin arising out of the Nuremberg principles,
and any attempt to construct such a defense by
the development of new and novel principles
threatens anarchy, both in the society at large
and on the campus.
Nuremberg did not establish so much a legal
defense as three novel prosecutorial principles.
The Nuremberg tribunal held, for the first time,
that the civil heads of government could be held
responsible for war crimes committed by their
states:
"The official position of defenders, whether
as Heads of State or responsible officials in
Government departments, shall not be
considered as freeing them from
responsibility ..." (Charter of the International
Military Tribunal, quoted in Ferencz, War Crimes

Law and the Vietnam War, 17 American
University L. Rev. 403,409 (1 968 ).)
The second innovation of Nuremberg was to
deny under international law the defense of
"superior orders":
"The fact that defendant acted pursuant to
order of his government or of a superior shall not
free him from responsibility but may be
considered in mitigation of punishment, if the
Tribunal determines that justice so requires." (Id.
at 409).
The third innovation at Nuremberg was to
expand the definition of war crimes beyond
traditional boundaries. In addition to "war
crimes," which consisted of violating the Rules
of Land Warfare or other military conventions,
the Nuremberg Tribunal added "Crimes Against
Peace (which includes wars of aggression)" and
"Crimes Against Humanity (which includes
enslavement and genocide)." (Id. at 405-06.)
What Nuremberg Did Not Establish
Nuremberg did not establish that citizens in
non-directory positions could be punished for
failing to stop war crimes, but only those in
directory positions. "Directory" positions were
narrowly defined. Thus, of the tens of thousands
involved in civil government in Germany and
Japan, and the millions in the armed forces, only
15 Germans and 24 Japanese were convicted of
planning or waging aggressive war. Fifty-nine
Germans were acquitted of the charge. Taylor,
Nuremberg and Vietnam: An American Tragedy
pp. 87-88 (1969 ).
Nor did Nuremberg establish that criminal
acts intended to stop war crimes could be
defended against by raising the "necessity" of
preventing war crimes.
Some have argued that both propositions

should be implemented as a natural extension of
the Nuremberg innovations. Yet both would raise
enormous problems for society and for the
university community in particular.
The proposition that ordinary citizens should
be punished for failing to stop war crimes is
unlikely to be implemented so long as the guilty
nation retains its sovereignty. For no government
will punish its own citizens for their failure to
object to government policy. In reality, such
punishments could only occur when—as in the
case of Germany after World War ll—a nation has
temporarily lost its sovereignty to others. And,
of course, even if the principle is accepted by a
conquering nation, it is difficult to know just
what "acts" by citizens would constitute
attempts to stop war crimes. Would voting
against the party in power be sufficient? Would
the citizen be required to refuse to pay taxes or
serve in the armed forces? Or would positive acts,
such as sabotage or assassination, be required in
order to absolve him of guilt?
The same difficulty would arise in attempting
to apply the principle of citizen punishment to
the university community. Universities
contribute to a country's strength in many ways,
and, therefore, inevitably contribute to its
military potential. Would absolution from war
guilt come from opposing only activities which
contribute directly to offensive war capabilities
or would members of the academic community
need to oppose any and all activities which
contribute in any way to military strength—such
as much medical research?
The second proposition, that citizens may
raise "war crimes" as a defense to criminal acts,
is also fraught with difficulty. A country which
maintains its sovereignty cannot be expected to
permit the defense to crimes of

commission—especially when those crimes result
in physical harm to others. Allowing such a
defense would leave the criminal code a
shambles—crime would be defined only by
individual conscience, and anarchy would result.
Adoption of such a principle at Stanford
would bring about a kind of academic anarchy. A
small group, acting under the direction of its own
conscience, would determine who could and
could not speak here. And it is by no means clear
that only "establishment" speakers would be
affected. There is great diversity of opinion on
the campus, and there are doubtless groups who
feel that other sorts of speakers have committed
one crime or another. Nor would anarchy be
limited to speakers. The principle Professor
Franklin seems to embrace would give
self-declared tribunals the right to disrupt any
university facility which they had determined to
be in violation of some principle of international
law. Such a principle cannot logically be
confined to research. Classroom activity, too,
might fall under the jurisdiction of the
self-proclaimed war crimes tribunals which would
be roving the com pus.
In other words, if Professor Franklin and
others may disrupt the Lodge speech because
they have "convicted" Lodge of war crimes or
shut down the Computation Center because they
have "determined" that it does war research, no
activity on the Stanford campus will be immune
to such ad hoc judgments in the future. The
Board must recognize, therefore, that the
acceptance here of the mythical "Nuremberg"
defenses would be a clear invitation to many
groups to shut down, harass and disrupt the
entire range of the University's activities, from
teaching to research to public events.

Nuremberg, in reality, created no defenses. It
did, however, strengthen a previously existing
defense: a defense to crimes of omission. A
person ordered to commit a war crime may
refuse to do so and defend on the ground that he
would have been committing a war crime had he
complied with the order. Thus, a soldier ordered
to shoot a prisoner might refuse and raise as a
defense for failure to obey orders the
international treaty which prohibits the killing of
prisoners.
Such a defense was accepted, on principle, in
the trial of Captain Howard Levy. However, it
was disallowed because Levy could not show a
direct relation between what he was asked to do
(train medics) and the war crimes he sought to
prove. Judgment at Fort Jackson: The
Court-Martial of Captain Howard B. Levy, 4 Law
in Transition Quarterly 123, 146-147 (1967 ).
Thus, a citizen who would raise the Nuremberg
principle in defense must be able to show a direct
connection between his coerced acts and a war
crime in order successfully to raise a defense to a
crime of omission.
Professor Franklin cannot raise a defense by
relying on Nuremberg because none of its
prosecutorial principles apply to him. He is not a
director of the country so as to be exposed to
war-crimes guilt under the Nuremberg principles.
Nor would he face punishment for failure to
oppose alleged war crimes since Nuremberg
requires no such intervention of ordinary
citizens.
Finally, Professor Franklin cannot raise the
older defense to crimes of omission. He has not
shown and cannot show that he was being forced
directly to contribute to or participate in war
crimes.

_ or other entities, and possibly that he had a duty
"to act as he did. Professor Franklin will no doubt
proffer evidence in support of his so-called
Nuremberg and necessity defenses. However,
these defenses, as a matter of law, either do not
exist or are not applicable to this proceeding.
The Board should therefore refuse to accept
evidence relating to war crimes in Vietnam or
Stanford's alleged complicity in them.
I. Nuremberg "Defense"
There is no defense available to Professor
Franklin arising out of the Nuremberg principles,
and any attempt to construct such a defense by
the development of new and novel principles
threatens anarchy, both in the society at large
and on the campus.
Nuremberg did not establish so much a legal
defense as three novel prosecutorial principles.
The Nuremberg tribunal held, for the first time,
that the civil heads of government could be held
responsible for war crimes committed by their
states:
"The official position of defenders, whether
as Heads of State or responsible officials in
Government departments, shall not be
considered as freeing them from
responsibility ..." (Charter of the International
Military Tribunal, quoted in Ferencz, War Crimes

Law and the Vietnam War, 17 American
University L. Rev. 403,409 (1 968 ).)
The second innovation of Nuremberg was to
deny under international law the defense of
"superior orders":
"The fact that defendant acted pursuant to
order of his government or of a superior shall not
free him from responsibility but may be
considered in mitigation of punishment, if the
Tribunal determines that justice so requires." (Id.
at 409).
The third innovation at Nuremberg was to
expand the definition of war crimes beyond
traditional boundaries. In addition to "war
crimes," which consisted of violating the Rules
of Land Warfare or other military conventions,
the Nuremberg Tribunal added "Crimes Against
Peace (which includes wars of aggression)" and
"Crimes Against Humanity (which includes
enslavement and genocide)." (Id. at 405-06.)
What Nuremberg Did Not Establish
Nuremberg did not establish that citizens in
non-directory positions could be punished for
failing to stop war crimes, but only those in
directory positions. "Directory" positions were
narrowly defined. Thus, of the tens of thousands
involved in civil government in Germany and
Japan, and the millions in the armed forces, only
15 Germans and 24 Japanese were convicted of
planning or waging aggressive war. Fifty-nine
Germans were acquitted of the charge. Taylor,
Nuremberg and Vietnam: An American Tragedy
pp. 87-88 (1969 ).
Nor did Nuremberg establish that criminal
acts intended to stop war crimes could be
defended against by raising the "necessity" of
preventing war crimes.
Some have argued that both propositions

should be implemented as a natural extension of
the Nuremberg innovations. Yet both would raise
enormous problems for society and for the
university community in particular.
The proposition that ordinary citizens should
be punished for failing to stop war crimes is
unlikely to be implemented so long as the guilty
nation retains its sovereignty. For no government
will punish its own citizens for their failure to
object to government policy. In reality, such
punishments could only occur when—as in the
case of Germany after World War ll—a nation has
temporarily lost its sovereignty to others. And,
of course, even if the principle is accepted by a
conquering nation, it is difficult to know just
what "acts" by citizens would constitute
attempts to stop war crimes. Would voting
against the party in power be sufficient? Would
the citizen be required to refuse to pay taxes or
serve in the armed forces? Or would positive acts,
such as sabotage or assassination, be required in
order to absolve him of guilt?
The same difficulty would arise in attempting
to apply the principle of citizen punishment to
the university community. Universities
contribute to a country's strength in many ways,
and, therefore, inevitably contribute to its
military potential. Would absolution from war
guilt come from opposing only activities which
contribute directly to offensive war capabilities
or would members of the academic community
need to oppose any and all activities which
contribute in any way to military strength—such
as much medical research?
The second proposition, that citizens may
raise "war crimes" as a defense to criminal acts,
is also fraught with difficulty. A country which
maintains its sovereignty cannot be expected to
permit the defense to crimes of

commission—especially when those crimes result
in physical harm to others. Allowing such a
defense would leave the criminal code a
shambles—crime would be defined only by
individual conscience, and anarchy would result.
Adoption of such a principle at Stanford
would bring about a kind of academic anarchy. A
small group, acting under the direction of its own
conscience, would determine who could and
could not speak here. And it is by no means clear
that only "establishment" speakers would be
affected. There is great diversity of opinion on
the campus, and there are doubtless groups who
feel that other sorts of speakers have committed
one crime or another. Nor would anarchy be
limited to speakers. The principle Professor
Franklin seems to embrace would give
self-declared tribunals the right to disrupt any
university facility which they had determined to
be in violation of some principle of international
law. Such a principle cannot logically be
confined to research. Classroom activity, too,
might fall under the jurisdiction of the
self-proclaimed war crimes tribunals which would
be roving the com pus.
In other words, if Professor Franklin and
others may disrupt the Lodge speech because
they have "convicted" Lodge of war crimes or
shut down the Computation Center because they
have "determined" that it does war research, no
activity on the Stanford campus will be immune
to such ad hoc judgments in the future. The
Board must recognize, therefore, that the
acceptance here of the mythical "Nuremberg"
defenses would be a clear invitation to many
groups to shut down, harass and disrupt the
entire range of the University's activities, from
teaching to research to public events.

Nuremberg, in reality, created no defenses. It
did, however, strengthen a previously existing
defense: a defense to crimes of omission. A
person ordered to commit a war crime may
refuse to do so and defend on the ground that he
would have been committing a war crime had he
complied with the order. Thus, a soldier ordered
to shoot a prisoner might refuse and raise as a
defense for failure to obey orders the
international treaty which prohibits the killing of
prisoners.
Such a defense was accepted, on principle, in
the trial of Captain Howard Levy. However, it
was disallowed because Levy could not show a
direct relation between what he was asked to do
(train medics) and the war crimes he sought to
prove. Judgment at Fort Jackson: The
Court-Martial of Captain Howard B. Levy, 4 Law
in Transition Quarterly 123, 146-147 (1967 ).
Thus, a citizen who would raise the Nuremberg
principle in defense must be able to show a direct
connection between his coerced acts and a war
crime in order successfully to raise a defense to a
crime of omission.
Professor Franklin cannot raise a defense by
relying on Nuremberg because none of its
prosecutorial principles apply to him. He is not a
director of the country so as to be exposed to
war-crimes guilt under the Nuremberg principles.
Nor would he face punishment for failure to
oppose alleged war crimes since Nuremberg
requires no such intervention of ordinary
citizens.
Finally, Professor Franklin cannot raise the
older defense to crimes of omission. He has not
shown and cannot show that he was being forced
directly to contribute to or participate in war
crimes.
Editor's Note: Following is the first part of the
"University's objection to admission of evidence
by Bruce Franklin bearing on a defense based on
->Nuremberg or Necessity. This argument was
submitted to Franklin's Advisory Hoard hearing
Friday by Stanford Attorney Raymond Fisher.
M Part Two will appear tomorrow.
Professor Franklin defends his actions by
raising two interrelated defenses: Nuremberg and
"necessity and justification." Professor Franklin
has refused to elaborate on his defense. However,
'it must be that he will argue that Nuremberg
established a defense to offenses against the state
_ or other entities, and possibly that he had a duty
