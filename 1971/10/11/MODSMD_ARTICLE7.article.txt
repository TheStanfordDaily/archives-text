# Selective Service Questions And Answers
## 
### PETER HANAWALT SUSAN SWARINGEN 
Q. I.m a freshman. Is there any
way I can get a student deferment
under the new law?
A. No. You are in the first
college class not entitled to 11-S
deferments. If you receive an
induction order while you are
registered in school, you will be
allowed a postponement until the
end of the quarter.
Q. I had a student deferment
last year and am going into my
junior year. I saw in the paper
that there would be no more
student deferments after Congress
passed the draft law in September.
But there was still a student
deferment card in my registration
packet. What is my situation?
A. Since you had a college
deferment last year, you re
entitled to continue with that
deferment until graduation,
provided you have met and
continue to meet the old Selective
Service requirements for student
deferments. In order to have your

student status certified to local
board, you should fill out both
the yellow and the white Selective
Service Information cards in your
reg. packet.
Q. I was at Stanford last year,
but I didn't have a student
deferment because 1 had not yet
registered for the draft. I have a
friend who was also at Stanford
last year, and who was registered
for the draft, but he didn't think
he needed a 11-S until after his
lottery number was drawn this
summer. Can either of us get a
student deferment now?
A. Yes. You are both eligible
to receive a 11-S deferment until
you graduate, provided you have
met and continue to meet the old
Selective Service requirements for
student deferment.
Q. I'm a first year graduate
student working for a MA next
Spring. My number is 86. What
will happen to me under the new
law?
A. Because you are a graduate
student, you are not entitled to a

student deferment. If you receive
an induction order while you are
registered in school, you may have
your induction postponed until
the end of the academic year (no
later than June 15). Because your
lottery number has already been
reached this year, you are eligible
to receive an induction order as
soon as you become I-A and are
not in the process of appeal. If
you were a graduate student not
in your last year of study, you
would be entitled to a
postponement of induction only
until the end of the quarter.
Q. I'm a junior. My number is
124. What can I expect under the
new law?
A. The new law does not affect
your student deferment, as long as
you continue to be fully
registered and make normal
progress toward your degree,
which you would normally receive
in June, 19 73. If you lost your
deferment and were reclassified
I-A during 1971, you would be
eligible to receive an induction
order, since your number has been
reached this year. If you were to
lose your deferment and become
I-A during 19 72 , your number
would likely not come up, and
therefore you would not receive
an induction order. If you
graduate as expected, in 1 973 ,
your number should also make
you safe from induction.
Q. I graduated last June. Last
week I got a I-A notice in the
mail. However, I'm a
conscientious objector and filed a
Form 15 0 two years ago, so I
guess I need to appeal now. Does
the new law change my appeal
rights or the procedures outlined
in the CO Handbook?
A. You're right that you need
to appeal now. because the I-A
classification indicates that your
CO claim has been initially
rejected. The new law does give
you several new rights in this
appeal procedure.
As was formerly the case, you
have 30 days from the date
stamped on the I-A card to
request a personal appearance
and/or an appeal. If you make the
personal appearance you will be
issued another classification card
which entitles you to a 30-day
period in which to request an

appeal to the state appeal board.
The new law now allows you to
present a reasonable number of
witnesses before the local board at
your personal appearance. This
was formerly allowed only at the
discretion of the local board. You
are now also entitled to make a
personal appearance before the
state appeal board, which
formerly received only a written
appeal. In addition, you may
request a written statement of
reasons from the local board after
any unfavorable classification. If
your CO is granted you may be
ordered to do civilian work. The
decision regarding appropriate
work will now be made by
national headquarters of Selective

Service rather than by your local
board. All of these changes are
theoretically in effect as part of
the new law, but it may take
several months for Selective
Service to implement them.
Regardless of whether their
availability is made public, you
should request these rights in
writing from your local board as
part of the appeal process that
you are legally entitled to.
Q. I am beginning my sixth
year of graduate study. I was in
the last class of graduate students
to qualify for deferment, entering
in Fall 1966. My 11-S expires this
October and I will be 26 in late
November. My lottery number is
2. Am I going to be drafted?
A. The graduate school
deferment that you were granted
in 1967 is good for a maximum of
five years. Therefore, you do not
qualify to continue with your 11-S
during this academic year,
1 971 -7 2. If you turn 26, however,
without having a valid induction
order mailed to you, you are not
eligible to receive one after that
(unless you are a M.D. or there is
a national mobilization). Suppose
you turn I-A this month: your

lottery number would allow you
to be drafted 3 0 days after the
issuance of that I-A, provided you
have passed a pre-induction
physical exam and have not
requested any of your appeal
rights. If you are in the process of
appealing or are taking a physical
when you turn 26, you cannot be
issued an induction order
afterwards.
Q. I'm a citizen of (Argentina)
and hold a permanent resident
visa. I'm 20 and have not yet
registered with Selective Service.
What are my obligations?
A. Permanent resident aliens
are now subject to the draft

eÂ«A!.yH

almost like U.S. citizens, but they
may not be inducted during their
first year in this country. The law
requires that you register for the
draft at any local board office
within 6 months of your arrival.
Permanent resident aliens who are
not yet 18 must register within 5
days after their 1 8 th birthday.
Aliens may be exempt from
U.S. military service by executing
a waiver to future U.S.
citizenship. This waiver, once
signed, may not, however, allow
reentry to this country on a
permanent resident visa. The
waiver does not need to be signed
at the time of registration, and a
man may wish to determine his
actual liability by lottery number
before he decides whether to sign
the waiver.
Aliens who have served 12
months in an allied foreign army
will be classified IV-A and are
thus not liable for induction.
All non-immigrant aliens
admitted on various temporary
visas, such as the "F" or "J" visas,
are exempt from registration and
service unless they become
permanent residents.
