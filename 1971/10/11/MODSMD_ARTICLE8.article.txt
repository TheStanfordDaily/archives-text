# 'Daily' Criticism & Response

Editor, THE DAILY:
It is written: "Garcia, Saunders
Impressive at Frost" (oh?);
"Saunders would hold one note at
length, then work quickly away
down the scale, then return to
another note and pound away at
it—duh" (that one is beyond
belief); and, "Big Black and the
Bobby Hutcherson-Harold Land
Quintet—the other two featured
groups—were equally impressive,
particularly Big Black." As much
as I would like to present a
lengthy expose concerning the
banal superficiality and
incompetency usually displayed in
reviews of rock records and
concerts, and would like to
include in that discussion a series
of well-warranted attacks levelled
at Daily reporter Paul Grushkin's
torpid, cliched prose, I will not; I
will merely comment on the
substance of the third passage
quoted above.
Sunday's concert in Frost
Amphitheater was advertised as a
jazz concert; the featured
group—the group which got top
billing and played the prime-time
third set-Avas an extremely intense,
sophosticated jazz quintet. The
Daily reviewer of this concert, in
all of his name-in-pront glory, was
gracious enough to imbed the
phrase, "the Bobby Hutcherson-
Harold Land Quintet" in the middle
of an entire column of dribble; of
the group's incredibly exciting,
energetic, and creative music, he
said nothing.
Hey, Paul, were you even
listening? Or did you decide that
yours was to "write to the
people"--the people whom you
walked out of the third set
with—and was not to listen (with
an open heart and a
critically-open intellect) to an
unfamiliar musical idiom? Or were
you merely too busy thinking up
tasty gems like, "Garcia with his

bluesy doodle-oos" to have time
to listen to the featured artists?
Enough defamation. No, not
quite enough, although it
contradicts my introduction: I
cannot understand how anyone in
the position of a music reviewer
could call Big Black particularly
impressive when their rhythm
guitar player could not (i.e., did
not, for the entire hour) even
come close to getting his
instrument tuned
corrpctly—unless, of course, that
individuals borders on the
tone-deaf.
In conclusion: No mention of
Harold Land's outstanding tenor
saxophone playing, no mention of
Bobby Hutcherson's outstanding
vibrophone playing, no mention
of one of the heaviest jazz sets
I've been to; excessive praise of
Garcia's now exhausted and
stumbling style; and ignorance of
western tonality involved in
tuning a simple six-string guitar. I
propose that future reviewers be
more competant.

My reaction to all this is a long
yawn.
Fact is, I didn't walk out on
the Hutcherson-Land Quintet. I
feel, simply, that I don't have the
expertise to critique progressive
jazz. I wish I did.
I think that we on the Daily
entertainment staff should have
labeled my review "notes on the
Garcia-Saunders portion of the
show." However, the Daily will
shortly offer (albeit a bit late) a
very knowledgeable review by
Marc Barman of the
Hutcherson-Land presentation, as
well as an overview of their album
material. Hold your fire till then.
As far as Jerry Garcia goes. . .
Look, pal, Jerry's one of the best

in his business—even you might
agree with that. With or without
the Dead. Whenever an artist of
his stature gets into something
new—like playing gigs with
unknown organist friends—it's
worth every bit of the space we
gave him.
''Now - exhausted-and
stumbling-style?" Come on now.
Obviously you didn't have the
courtesy, the interest-or the
tolerance—to listen very closely.
The man's good. And after all,
Steve, you can't get any better
than the best.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Naturally, I do not like to
describe myself, to use Professor
Halsted Holman's words, as one
"whose allegiance is
predominantly to the abstraction
of free speech." I like to think I
am more concrete ana pragmatic
than that phrase implies. But I
would like to take up his
invitation to "marshal the
argument" in behalf of free
speech in order to encourage a
"free and open airing of the
issues."
As I understand Mr. Holman's
argument, his justification for
Bruce Franklin's disruption of
Lodge's speech was that Lodge is
a recognized war criminal under
the Nuremberg precedent. This
argument, it seems to me, misses
several points. First of all, the
point of Nuremberg was that a
trial was to be held in order to
ascertain whether a person was in
fact a war criminal; regardless of
how convinced the world was of
the Nazi's crimes, a trial was
necessary. No matter how sure
Mr. Holman or Mr. Franklin may
be of Lodge's criminality, that
fact has not been ascertained as

Nuremberg required. And the
necessity of a trial is not a mere
technicality, for if an individual or
a group of individuals can make
the same determination as would
be made in a trial, how does the
action of Franklin and his
supporters at Dinkelspiel differ in
principle from that of a lynch
mob? Such mobs also determine
that a suspected criminal ought to
be punished without a trial
because everyone "knows" his
guilt.
To my mind, however, the
question of a trial is no more
relevant to the issue of free speech
than anything else in Nuremberg.
What was there in the Nuremberg
principles that required the
defendants, or the convicted for

that matter, to remain silent? Yet
that is what Mr. Holman's
justification for stopping Lodge
seems to imply. Would Mr.
Holman argue that if Albert
Speer, or Rudolf Hess came to the
Stanford campus to speak, an
individual would be justified in
stopping either of them because
he was a convicted war criminal?
If Mr. Holman would not justify
that, then on what grounds is the
stopping of Lodge justified since
he is at least not yet convicted of
being a war criminal? If Mr.
Holman would justify the
stopping of all war criminals,
would he also want to silence
other kinds of criminals? If not,
why not? (I listened without
interruption to the Barbed Wire
Theater, the cast of which was

made up entirely of convicted
criminals, in Dinkelspiel two years
ago.
What 1 conclude from this is
that the behavior of a speaker
prior to his appearing on a
platform provides no basis for
judging whether a person ought to
be heard or not. (The only
exception would be if previous
behavior indicated that a speaker
would cry "fire" in a crowded
theater and thereby present a
"clear and present danger" to his
audience and society.) The matter
of previous activity is simply
irrelevant if one is going to have a
free airing of views on a university
campus. I believe that Mr. Holman
has erected an argument that is
more a tribute to his deeply felt
desire to bring the principle of

Nuremberg to bear upon Henry
Cabot Lodge than it is to his
concern for freedom of speech. In
the process of trying to use
enforced silence as a sanction of
the Nuremberg principle Mr.
Holman does not really punish
Lodge though he seriously
weakens the most effective
justification for free speech. After
all, it is that principle which
justifies Mr. Franklin's right to
preach revolution. The
near-absolute right to hear
divergent views is too precious to
be sacrificed to Mr. Holman's or
Mr. Franklin's need for the
expression of moral outrage or for
the expiation of guilt.

another note and pound away at
it—duh" (that one is beyond
belief); and, "Big Black and the
Bobby Hutcherson-Harold Land
Quintet—the other two featured
groups—were equally impressive,
particularly Big Black." As much
as I would like to present a
lengthy expose concerning the
banal superficiality and
incompetency usually displayed in
reviews of rock records and
concerts, and would like to
include in that discussion a series
of well-warranted attacks levelled
at Daily reporter Paul Grushkin's
torpid, cliched prose, I will not; I
will merely comment on the
substance of the third passage
quoted above.
Sunday's concert in Frost
Amphitheater was advertised as a
jazz concert; the featured
group—the group which got top
billing and played the prime-time
third set-Avas an extremely intense,
sophosticated jazz quintet. The
Daily reviewer of this concert, in
all of his name-in-pront glory, was
gracious enough to imbed the
phrase, "the Bobby Hutcherson-
Harold Land Quintet" in the middle
of an entire column of dribble; of
the group's incredibly exciting,
energetic, and creative music, he
said nothing.
Hey, Paul, were you even
listening? Or did you decide that
yours was to "write to the
people"--the people whom you
walked out of the third set
with—and was not to listen (with
an open heart and a
critically-open intellect) to an
unfamiliar musical idiom? Or were
you merely too busy thinking up
tasty gems like, "Garcia with his

bluesy doodle-oos" to have time
to listen to the featured artists?
Enough defamation. No, not
quite enough, although it
contradicts my introduction: I
cannot understand how anyone in
the position of a music reviewer
could call Big Black particularly
impressive when their rhythm
guitar player could not (i.e., did
not, for the entire hour) even
come close to getting his
instrument tuned
corrpctly—unless, of course, that
individuals borders on the
tone-deaf.
In conclusion: No mention of
Harold Land's outstanding tenor
saxophone playing, no mention of
Bobby Hutcherson's outstanding
vibrophone playing, no mention
of one of the heaviest jazz sets
I've been to; excessive praise of
Garcia's now exhausted and
stumbling style; and ignorance of
western tonality involved in
tuning a simple six-string guitar. I
propose that future reviewers be
more competant.

My reaction to all this is a long
yawn.
Fact is, I didn't walk out on
the Hutcherson-Land Quintet. I
feel, simply, that I don't have the
expertise to critique progressive
jazz. I wish I did.
I think that we on the Daily
entertainment staff should have
labeled my review "notes on the
Garcia-Saunders portion of the
show." However, the Daily will
shortly offer (albeit a bit late) a
very knowledgeable review by
Marc Barman of the
Hutcherson-Land presentation, as
well as an overview of their album
material. Hold your fire till then.
As far as Jerry Garcia goes. . .
Look, pal, Jerry's one of the best

in his business—even you might
agree with that. With or without
the Dead. Whenever an artist of
his stature gets into something
new—like playing gigs with
unknown organist friends—it's
worth every bit of the space we
gave him.
''Now - exhausted-and
stumbling-style?" Come on now.
Obviously you didn't have the
courtesy, the interest-or the
tolerance—to listen very closely.
The man's good. And after all,
Steve, you can't get any better
than the best.

Naturally, I do not like to
describe myself, to use Professor
Halsted Holman's words, as one
"whose allegiance is
predominantly to the abstraction
of free speech." I like to think I
am more concrete ana pragmatic
than that phrase implies. But I
would like to take up his
invitation to "marshal the
argument" in behalf of free
speech in order to encourage a
"free and open airing of the
issues."
As I understand Mr. Holman's
argument, his justification for
Bruce Franklin's disruption of
Lodge's speech was that Lodge is
a recognized war criminal under
the Nuremberg precedent. This
argument, it seems to me, misses
several points. First of all, the
point of Nuremberg was that a
trial was to be held in order to
ascertain whether a person was in
fact a war criminal; regardless of
how convinced the world was of
the Nazi's crimes, a trial was
necessary. No matter how sure
Mr. Holman or Mr. Franklin may
be of Lodge's criminality, that
fact has not been ascertained as

Nuremberg required. And the
necessity of a trial is not a mere
technicality, for if an individual or
a group of individuals can make
the same determination as would
be made in a trial, how does the
action of Franklin and his
supporters at Dinkelspiel differ in
principle from that of a lynch
mob? Such mobs also determine
that a suspected criminal ought to
be punished without a trial
because everyone "knows" his
guilt.
To my mind, however, the
question of a trial is no more
relevant to the issue of free speech
than anything else in Nuremberg.
What was there in the Nuremberg
principles that required the
defendants, or the convicted for

that matter, to remain silent? Yet
that is what Mr. Holman's
justification for stopping Lodge
seems to imply. Would Mr.
Holman argue that if Albert
Speer, or Rudolf Hess came to the
Stanford campus to speak, an
individual would be justified in
stopping either of them because
he was a convicted war criminal?
If Mr. Holman would not justify
that, then on what grounds is the
stopping of Lodge justified since
he is at least not yet convicted of
being a war criminal? If Mr.
Holman would justify the
stopping of all war criminals,
would he also want to silence
other kinds of criminals? If not,
why not? (I listened without
interruption to the Barbed Wire
Theater, the cast of which was

made up entirely of convicted
criminals, in Dinkelspiel two years
ago.
What 1 conclude from this is
that the behavior of a speaker
prior to his appearing on a
platform provides no basis for
judging whether a person ought to
be heard or not. (The only
exception would be if previous
behavior indicated that a speaker
would cry "fire" in a crowded
theater and thereby present a
"clear and present danger" to his
audience and society.) The matter
of previous activity is simply
irrelevant if one is going to have a
free airing of views on a university
campus. I believe that Mr. Holman
has erected an argument that is
more a tribute to his deeply felt
desire to bring the principle of

Nuremberg to bear upon Henry
Cabot Lodge than it is to his
concern for freedom of speech. In
the process of trying to use
enforced silence as a sanction of
the Nuremberg principle Mr.
Holman does not really punish
Lodge though he seriously
weakens the most effective
justification for free speech. After
all, it is that principle which
justifies Mr. Franklin's right to
preach revolution. The
near-absolute right to hear
divergent views is too precious to
be sacrificed to Mr. Holman's or
Mr. Franklin's need for the
expression of moral outrage or for
the expiation of guilt.

particularly Big Black." As much
as I would like to present a
lengthy expose concerning the
banal superficiality and
incompetency usually displayed in
reviews of rock records and
concerts, and would like to
include in that discussion a series
of well-warranted attacks levelled
at Daily reporter Paul Grushkin's
torpid, cliched prose, I will not; I
will merely comment on the
substance of the third passage
quoted above.
Sunday's concert in Frost
Amphitheater was advertised as a
jazz concert; the featured
group—the group which got top
billing and played the prime-time
third set-Avas an extremely intense,
sophosticated jazz quintet. The
Daily reviewer of this concert, in
all of his name-in-pront glory, was
gracious enough to imbed the
phrase, "the Bobby Hutcherson-
Harold Land Quintet" in the middle
of an entire column of dribble; of
the group's incredibly exciting,
energetic, and creative music, he
said nothing.
Hey, Paul, were you even
listening? Or did you decide that
yours was to "write to the
people"--the people whom you
walked out of the third set
with—and was not to listen (with
an open heart and a
critically-open intellect) to an
unfamiliar musical idiom? Or were
you merely too busy thinking up
tasty gems like, "Garcia with his

bluesy doodle-oos" to have time
to listen to the featured artists?
Enough defamation. No, not
quite enough, although it
contradicts my introduction: I
cannot understand how anyone in
the position of a music reviewer
could call Big Black particularly
impressive when their rhythm
guitar player could not (i.e., did
not, for the entire hour) even
come close to getting his
instrument tuned
corrpctly—unless, of course, that
individuals borders on the
tone-deaf.
In conclusion: No mention of
Harold Land's outstanding tenor
saxophone playing, no mention of
Bobby Hutcherson's outstanding
vibrophone playing, no mention
of one of the heaviest jazz sets
I've been to; excessive praise of
Garcia's now exhausted and
stumbling style; and ignorance of
western tonality involved in
tuning a simple six-string guitar. I
propose that future reviewers be
more competant.

My reaction to all this is a long
yawn.
Fact is, I didn't walk out on
the Hutcherson-Land Quintet. I
feel, simply, that I don't have the
expertise to critique progressive
jazz. I wish I did.
I think that we on the Daily
entertainment staff should have
labeled my review "notes on the
Garcia-Saunders portion of the
show." However, the Daily will
shortly offer (albeit a bit late) a
very knowledgeable review by
Marc Barman of the
Hutcherson-Land presentation, as
well as an overview of their album
material. Hold your fire till then.
As far as Jerry Garcia goes. . .
Look, pal, Jerry's one of the best

in his business—even you might
agree with that. With or without
the Dead. Whenever an artist of
his stature gets into something
new—like playing gigs with
unknown organist friends—it's
worth every bit of the space we
gave him.
''Now - exhausted-and
stumbling-style?" Come on now.
Obviously you didn't have the
courtesy, the interest-or the
tolerance—to listen very closely.
The man's good. And after all,
Steve, you can't get any better
than the best.

Naturally, I do not like to
describe myself, to use Professor
Halsted Holman's words, as one
"whose allegiance is
predominantly to the abstraction
of free speech." I like to think I
am more concrete ana pragmatic
than that phrase implies. But I
would like to take up his
invitation to "marshal the
argument" in behalf of free
speech in order to encourage a
"free and open airing of the
issues."
As I understand Mr. Holman's
argument, his justification for
Bruce Franklin's disruption of
Lodge's speech was that Lodge is
a recognized war criminal under
the Nuremberg precedent. This
argument, it seems to me, misses
several points. First of all, the
point of Nuremberg was that a
trial was to be held in order to
ascertain whether a person was in
fact a war criminal; regardless of
how convinced the world was of
the Nazi's crimes, a trial was
necessary. No matter how sure
Mr. Holman or Mr. Franklin may
be of Lodge's criminality, that
fact has not been ascertained as

Nuremberg required. And the
necessity of a trial is not a mere
technicality, for if an individual or
a group of individuals can make
the same determination as would
be made in a trial, how does the
action of Franklin and his
supporters at Dinkelspiel differ in
principle from that of a lynch
mob? Such mobs also determine
that a suspected criminal ought to
be punished without a trial
because everyone "knows" his
guilt.
To my mind, however, the
question of a trial is no more
relevant to the issue of free speech
than anything else in Nuremberg.
What was there in the Nuremberg
principles that required the
defendants, or the convicted for

that matter, to remain silent? Yet
that is what Mr. Holman's
justification for stopping Lodge
seems to imply. Would Mr.
Holman argue that if Albert
Speer, or Rudolf Hess came to the
Stanford campus to speak, an
individual would be justified in
stopping either of them because
he was a convicted war criminal?
If Mr. Holman would not justify
that, then on what grounds is the
stopping of Lodge justified since
he is at least not yet convicted of
being a war criminal? If Mr.
Holman would justify the
stopping of all war criminals,
would he also want to silence
other kinds of criminals? If not,
why not? (I listened without
interruption to the Barbed Wire
Theater, the cast of which was

made up entirely of convicted
criminals, in Dinkelspiel two years
ago.
What 1 conclude from this is
that the behavior of a speaker
prior to his appearing on a
platform provides no basis for
judging whether a person ought to
be heard or not. (The only
exception would be if previous
behavior indicated that a speaker
would cry "fire" in a crowded
theater and thereby present a
"clear and present danger" to his
audience and society.) The matter
of previous activity is simply
irrelevant if one is going to have a
free airing of views on a university
campus. I believe that Mr. Holman
has erected an argument that is
more a tribute to his deeply felt
desire to bring the principle of

Nuremberg to bear upon Henry
Cabot Lodge than it is to his
concern for freedom of speech. In
the process of trying to use
enforced silence as a sanction of
the Nuremberg principle Mr.
Holman does not really punish
Lodge though he seriously
weakens the most effective
justification for free speech. After
all, it is that principle which
justifies Mr. Franklin's right to
preach revolution. The
near-absolute right to hear
divergent views is too precious to
be sacrificed to Mr. Holman's or
Mr. Franklin's need for the
expression of moral outrage or for
the expiation of guilt.

include in that discussion a series
of well-warranted attacks levelled
at Daily reporter Paul Grushkin's
torpid, cliched prose, I will not; I
will merely comment on the
substance of the third passage
quoted above.
Sunday's concert in Frost
Amphitheater was advertised as a
jazz concert; the featured
group—the group which got top
billing and played the prime-time
third set-Avas an extremely intense,
sophosticated jazz quintet. The
Daily reviewer of this concert, in
all of his name-in-pront glory, was
gracious enough to imbed the
phrase, "the Bobby Hutcherson-
Harold Land Quintet" in the middle
of an entire column of dribble; of
the group's incredibly exciting,
energetic, and creative music, he
said nothing.
Hey, Paul, were you even
listening? Or did you decide that
yours was to "write to the
people"--the people whom you
walked out of the third set
with—and was not to listen (with
an open heart and a
critically-open intellect) to an
unfamiliar musical idiom? Or were
you merely too busy thinking up
tasty gems like, "Garcia with his

bluesy doodle-oos" to have time
to listen to the featured artists?
Enough defamation. No, not
quite enough, although it
contradicts my introduction: I
cannot understand how anyone in
the position of a music reviewer
could call Big Black particularly
impressive when their rhythm
guitar player could not (i.e., did
not, for the entire hour) even
come close to getting his
instrument tuned
corrpctly—unless, of course, that
individuals borders on the
tone-deaf.
In conclusion: No mention of
Harold Land's outstanding tenor
saxophone playing, no mention of
Bobby Hutcherson's outstanding
vibrophone playing, no mention
of one of the heaviest jazz sets
I've been to; excessive praise of
Garcia's now exhausted and
stumbling style; and ignorance of
western tonality involved in
tuning a simple six-string guitar. I
propose that future reviewers be
more competant.

My reaction to all this is a long
yawn.
Fact is, I didn't walk out on
the Hutcherson-Land Quintet. I
feel, simply, that I don't have the
expertise to critique progressive
jazz. I wish I did.
I think that we on the Daily
entertainment staff should have
labeled my review "notes on the
Garcia-Saunders portion of the
show." However, the Daily will
shortly offer (albeit a bit late) a
very knowledgeable review by
Marc Barman of the
Hutcherson-Land presentation, as
well as an overview of their album
material. Hold your fire till then.
As far as Jerry Garcia goes. . .
Look, pal, Jerry's one of the best

in his business—even you might
agree with that. With or without
the Dead. Whenever an artist of
his stature gets into something
new—like playing gigs with
unknown organist friends—it's
worth every bit of the space we
gave him.
''Now - exhausted-and
stumbling-style?" Come on now.
Obviously you didn't have the
courtesy, the interest-or the
tolerance—to listen very closely.
The man's good. And after all,
Steve, you can't get any better
than the best.

Naturally, I do not like to
describe myself, to use Professor
Halsted Holman's words, as one
"whose allegiance is
predominantly to the abstraction
of free speech." I like to think I
am more concrete ana pragmatic
than that phrase implies. But I
would like to take up his
invitation to "marshal the
argument" in behalf of free
speech in order to encourage a
"free and open airing of the
issues."
As I understand Mr. Holman's
argument, his justification for
Bruce Franklin's disruption of
Lodge's speech was that Lodge is
a recognized war criminal under
the Nuremberg precedent. This
argument, it seems to me, misses
several points. First of all, the
point of Nuremberg was that a
trial was to be held in order to
ascertain whether a person was in
fact a war criminal; regardless of
how convinced the world was of
the Nazi's crimes, a trial was
necessary. No matter how sure
Mr. Holman or Mr. Franklin may
be of Lodge's criminality, that
fact has not been ascertained as

Nuremberg required. And the
necessity of a trial is not a mere
technicality, for if an individual or
a group of individuals can make
the same determination as would
be made in a trial, how does the
action of Franklin and his
supporters at Dinkelspiel differ in
principle from that of a lynch
mob? Such mobs also determine
that a suspected criminal ought to
be punished without a trial
because everyone "knows" his
guilt.
To my mind, however, the
question of a trial is no more
relevant to the issue of free speech
than anything else in Nuremberg.
What was there in the Nuremberg
principles that required the
defendants, or the convicted for

that matter, to remain silent? Yet
that is what Mr. Holman's
justification for stopping Lodge
seems to imply. Would Mr.
Holman argue that if Albert
Speer, or Rudolf Hess came to the
Stanford campus to speak, an
individual would be justified in
stopping either of them because
he was a convicted war criminal?
If Mr. Holman would not justify
that, then on what grounds is the
stopping of Lodge justified since
he is at least not yet convicted of
being a war criminal? If Mr.
Holman would justify the
stopping of all war criminals,
would he also want to silence
other kinds of criminals? If not,
why not? (I listened without
interruption to the Barbed Wire
Theater, the cast of which was

made up entirely of convicted
criminals, in Dinkelspiel two years
ago.
What 1 conclude from this is
that the behavior of a speaker
prior to his appearing on a
platform provides no basis for
judging whether a person ought to
be heard or not. (The only
exception would be if previous
behavior indicated that a speaker
would cry "fire" in a crowded
theater and thereby present a
"clear and present danger" to his
audience and society.) The matter
of previous activity is simply
irrelevant if one is going to have a
free airing of views on a university
campus. I believe that Mr. Holman
has erected an argument that is
more a tribute to his deeply felt
desire to bring the principle of

Nuremberg to bear upon Henry
Cabot Lodge than it is to his
concern for freedom of speech. In
the process of trying to use
enforced silence as a sanction of
the Nuremberg principle Mr.
Holman does not really punish
Lodge though he seriously
weakens the most effective
justification for free speech. After
all, it is that principle which
justifies Mr. Franklin's right to
preach revolution. The
near-absolute right to hear
divergent views is too precious to
be sacrificed to Mr. Holman's or
Mr. Franklin's need for the
expression of moral outrage or for
the expiation of guilt.

It is written: "Garcia, Saunders
Impressive at Frost" (oh?);
"Saunders would hold one note at
length, then work quickly away
down the scale, then return to
another note and pound away at
it—duh" (that one is beyond
belief); and, "Big Black and the
Bobby Hutcherson-Harold Land
Quintet—the other two featured
groups—were equally impressive,
particularly Big Black." As much
as I would like to present a
lengthy expose concerning the
banal superficiality and
incompetency usually displayed in
reviews of rock records and
concerts, and would like to
include in that discussion a series
of well-warranted attacks levelled
at Daily reporter Paul Grushkin's
