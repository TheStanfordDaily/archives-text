Editor, THE DAILY:
I wish to clarify the remarks
attributed to me in the Daily
article of October 7. Although I

burden. Taxation involved in
creating a police district is a much
more equitable means of securing
such funding.
The second point raised against
a police district is that staff and
students who do not live in the
area of campus would be
disenfranchised. I have yet to
come into contact with one
commuter who votes in the
district of his employer, rather
than his home. The people who

ftiWCIkNOTii

appreciate the exhaustive work
done by the Police Commission, I
do not feel that their conclusions
are justified. The proposition in
the report is the most crucial. I
quote: "Stanford is an identifiable
community with some of the
special characteristics of a town or
city and with some of the special
characteristics that bring
community pressure for local
control of the police." This is and
should be an overriding concern
of anyone seriously considering
alternative means of law
enforcement for Stanford.
1 take issue with the conclusion
that a special police district is
infeasible. It is always too easy to
label something which is difficult
to accomplish "Impracticable."
The reluctance of the trustees to
allow a public agency to have the
power to tax its properties seems
to be the primary objection to
such a district. Certainly the
trustees may be reluctant, but the
question has yet to be phrased to
them.
The industry now present on
Stanford lands may be a good
source to explore as a possible tax
base contributor for such a
district. Stanford University will
foot the bill for any police
reorganization which involves
deputization or peace officer
status. The students will feel this
in tuition raises for years to come.
The students are not the only
beneficiaries of improved police
service and should not bear the

will be affected by police policies
the most are those people who
live in the district. Therefore these
people should be the voting
constituents of the Stanford
police district.
Anything along the lines of
"peace officer" status or
deputization should not be
undertaken unless the community
is guaranteed a substantive
amount of control over the police
force. The idea that the President
of the University or Director of

Police should be in control with
only an advisory body assisting
liiem is very dangerous. Even
though there may be a slim
possibility that Richard Lyman
would misuse the power given him
under such an arrangement, this
may not be true of future
presidents. I would rather see
Stanford placed under the control
(as far as police) of a County
Sheriff who comes up for election
periodically rather than a
University president who may be
in office for a decade or more.
It has been said that Stanford
University is not and should not
be a democracy. In dealing with
the issue of Police power on
campus, Stanford must become a
democracy. Those of us who live
here need to have a check on the
policies of any police force in
operation on this campus. The
only way of insuring such control
is through the process of periodic,
democratic elections and not
through an advisory board to the
President of the University. I
don't claim to be any kind of
expert on the Police question, but
I do feel that the kind of principle
involved in this controversy
cannot be disregarded.

It has been said that Stanford
University is not and should not
be a democracy. In dealing with
the issue of Police power on
campus, Stanford must become a
democracy. Those of us who live
here need to have a check on the
policies of any police force in
operation on this campus. The
only way of insuring such control
is through the process of periodic,
democratic elections and not
through an advisory board to the
President of the University. I
don't claim to be any kind of
expert on the Police question, but
I do feel that the kind of principle
involved in this controversy
cannot be disregarded.

Editor, THE DAILY:
I wish to clarify the remarks

article of October 7. Although I

burden. Taxation involved in
creating a police district is a much
more equitable means of securing
such funding.
The second point raised against
a police district is that staff and
students who do not live in the
area of campus would be
disenfranchised. I have yet to
come into contact with one
commuter who votes in the
district of his employer, rather
than his home. The people who

appreciate the exhaustive work
done by the Police Commission, I
do not feel that their conclusions
are justified. The proposition in
the report is the most crucial. I
quote: "Stanford is an identifiable
community with some of the
special characteristics of a town or
city and with some of the special
characteristics that bring
community pressure for local
control of the police." This is and
should be an overriding concern
of anyone seriously considering
alternative means of law
enforcement for Stanford.
1 take issue with the conclusion
that a special police district is
infeasible. It is always too easy to
label something which is difficult
to accomplish "Impracticable."
The reluctance of the trustees to
allow a public agency to have the
power to tax its properties seems
to be the primary objection to
such a district. Certainly the
trustees may be reluctant, but the
question has yet to be phrased to
them.
The industry now present on
Stanford lands may be a good
source to explore as a possible tax
base contributor for such a
district. Stanford University will
foot the bill for any police
reorganization which involves
deputization or peace officer
status. The students will feel this
in tuition raises for years to come.
The students are not the only
beneficiaries of improved police
service and should not bear the

will be affected by police policies
the most are those people who
live in the district. Therefore these
people should be the voting
constituents of the Stanford
police district.
Anything along the lines of
"peace officer" status or
deputization should not be
undertaken unless the community
is guaranteed a substantive
amount of control over the police
force. The idea that the President
of the University or Director of

Police should be in control with
only an advisory body assisting
liiem is very dangerous. Even
though there may be a slim
possibility that Richard Lyman
would misuse the power given him
under such an arrangement, this
may not be true of future
presidents. I would rather see
Stanford placed under the control
(as far as police) of a County
Sheriff who comes up for election
periodically rather than a
University president who may be
in office for a decade or more.
