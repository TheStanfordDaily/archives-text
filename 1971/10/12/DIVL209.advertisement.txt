REWARD,

Starting October 18, look around for somebody wearing
a pair of Levi's with a PSA patch on the seat.
That's your PSA Campus Rep, who'll give you an entry
blank for our big Levi's drawing. Send it in by midnight,
November 1. The winner gets 12 pairs of Levi's (without
patches).
That should set you up for life unless you've got 24 legs.
And even if you don't win, you'll know who can get you a
PSA reservation next time you want one.
