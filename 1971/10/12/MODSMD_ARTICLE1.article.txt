# Prison Experiment Too Realistic
## 
### ANDY ISRAEL 
Take normal, healthy, college age
students; divide them into guards and
prisoners arbitrarily, establish an
experimental "prison," and the results
are devastating.
Such an experiment was performed
this August by Dr. Philip Zimbardo of
the Department of Psychology and
according to him "when the American
people are exposed to the results of this
experiment it could well prove to be
the most significant agent toward
prison reform yet in this country."
In the light of summer prison
uprisings such as Attica, Zimbardo's
experiment takes on special interest.
The study grew out of a summer course
on the "Psychology of the
Imprisoned," taught by Zimbardo
aided by a 16 year ex-con, Carlos
Prescott.
The research project was designed to
help understand what goes into creating
and maintaining a prison and what the
prison experience does to the prisoners,
guards, and power establishment. The
study was in part to examine what are
the effects of arbitrarily labelling one
person "guard" and another
"prisoner."
The study began with an ad in the
city newspaper where applicants were
offered $15 a day for a two week
study. The first 70 applicants were
screened so that the final 24 chosen
were psychologically and medically
well-adjusted college students. By the
flip of the coin they were arbitrarily
divided into guards and prisoners and
the project was ready to begin.
Palo Alto Police Involved
Zimbardo described how the Palo
Alto police got the study rolling. "On a
quiet Sunday morning a Palo Alto
Police car swept through various
neighborhoods of the city, picked up
each of the boys who were going to be
prisoners individually. We had told
them simply to wait at home and
they'd be contacted. The police booked
them, frisked them, fingerprinted them,
blindfolded them, put them in
detention, and the boys still in a state
of surprise were picked up by our men
and brought down to our prison in the
basement of the Psychology
Department.
Each had been arrested for suspicion
of an alleged crime. The prisoners were
stripped naked, deloused, and put into
uniform. A stocking cap covered his
hair and made it look as if he had his
head shaved. A locked chain was
attached to one ankle which was to be
worn at all times, and the prisoner put
into a cell with two others and not
allowed to talk."

What happened the ensuing week
was crushing in its implications. The
group labelled guards, dressed in
uniforms and mirror sunglasses, and put
in charge under the supervision of
Zi.nbardo and his three graduate
student "wardens," became perverted
by the sense of power they felt.
They taunted, upbraided, and
humiliated the prisoners, often making
them stand for long hours and count
off their numbers. By the third day of
the experiment the guards were
controlling prisoners' lives, telling them
when they could go to the toilet, if
indeed they could at all, controlling
their meals, and deciding who should
get blankets or other "privileges."
Prisoners Affected Equally
The prisoners were equally affected
by the experience. On the second day
there was a prisoner rebellion where
some prisoners barricaded themselves
in, refused to eat, ripped off their
numbers, and started screaming
obscenities at the guards in an effort to
assert their freedom and individuality.
This rebellion was put down by a
reinforced group of guards using
physical force and psychological
tactics. After this the prisoners became
increasingly servile, following the
whimsy and arbitrary commands of the
guards. On the fifth day one prisoner
made a last futile attempt to assert his
individuality and freedom by refusing
to eat.
Although he had formerly been a
hero for the other prisoners he now
became a source of trouble. The guards
put this prisoner in the "hole" a small
2x4 closet and told the other prisoners
that if they wanted him out of the hole
for the night they would have to give
up their blankets. Although it wasn't
cold, the prisoners voted to keep their
blankets and let him rot in solitary.
Profound Effect
Zimbardo pointed out another very
profound effect on a prisoner after
only four days of the experiment.
"They had been in prison only four
days at this point, but those 4 days
were enough because their sense of
time had developed, indeed, so had
their sense of moral value. When a
prisoner got sick on this day, before I
released him I put him in a room to
rest.
The guards picking up on this used it
as an opportunity now to set the
prisoners against each other-had the
prisoners chant that 819 was a terrible
prisoner and on and on. When I realized
what was happening I went in to the
prisoner and said "let's leave." He was
falling and crying and couldn't leave
being a bad prisoner so I said "Your

name is Stu Levin, and I'm Dr.
Zimbardo, this is an experiment, you're
not a bad prisoner.
"He stopped crying instantly, looked
up at me and said, "0.K., let's go." It
was as if you had woken from a terrible
dream and at that point we realized the
experiment had gone too far, it had
become a prison."
Before the week was over it was
decided that the experiment would be
ended early. In trying to assert their
freedom the prisoners had become so
upset that three had to be released in
states of virtual emotional shock,
crying hysterically, one broke out in a
psychosomatic rash over his body, and
the others begged to be released,
offering to forfeit their pay for parole.
The guards were also strongly affected
by the experience, upset by what they
had been led to do by their roles.
'Warden' Speaks
Curt Banks, a "warden" of the
prison and a graduate student in
Psychology working under Dr.
Zimbardo explained some of the
significance of the experiment. "The
hypothesis is generally that prison is
bad because of the bad people there.
We have shown that with a group of
normal students a very bad prison
situation can be created.

"These people didn't have the
notoriety of a trial, the threat to life
and limb often found in prison, or the
homosexuality problems to face in
their prisons. The important factors
were the de-individuation of both the
prisoners and guards, the
dehumanization, and the confinement,
not the fact that the prison was formed
with a "bad" group of prisoners or a
group of sadistic guards."
Banks added that the data from the
experiment which is recorded on
movies, tapes, slides, and videotapes is
still being analyzed.
Dr. Zimbardo will be presenting his
project to the public in a forthcoming
NBC show "Chronolog" which will
probably be aired the last Friday in
October or November.
No Simple Solution
The results of his prison experiment
and his other studies regarding
imprisonment lead him to suggest
several basic things which can be done
to improve prison life. Zimbardo
cautions that "there is no simple
solution to this complex social and
psychological problem."
The task must begin before a man
gets into prison for he usually gets
there when he has been excluded from

cells at all hours to count them off. Hospital type gowns and stocking caps were

the rewards system of our society
because of social class or poverty.
"Once in prison the basic assumption
is that a man can be made good
through punishment. Our psychological
studies show that punishment will only
bring about at best a temporary change
which disappears when the punishing
agent is removed."
Zimbardo feels the prisoner/guard
relationship must be changed to a
counselor-trainee relationship. Positive
reinforcement will be necessary and the
prison years should be spent training to
do something which will give the
prisoner self-worth rather than making
license plates or furniture.
If prison could be used to train
people as psychiatric aides or to work
in old age homes, "we would be helping
people in the best way we know how,
by letting them help others," says
Zimbardo.
He added that "a person has been
successfully helped in prison only if he
has been changed in ways which he
thinks are good for him."
Cloak Of Secrecy
Another important step according to
Zimbardo will be to remove the cloak
of secrecy which surrounds prisons by
making their activities accessible to the
public or some neutral ombudsman

type person responsible neither to the
prisoners nor the administration. He
warns "don't take the prisoner out of
the community, the prisoner must feel
a worth and caring if he is to be
helped."
With such simple things as paying the
prisoners more than their present 2-l(i
cents per hour wage, the prisoner's self
worth could be built up and he could
be taken into the reward structure and
the community.
The prison experiment which arose
from Zimbardo's summer class was
funded by the money provided by the
Office of Naval Research for
Zimbardo's larger project titled
"Individual and Group Variables
Influencing Emotional Arousal,
Violence, and Behavior."
This contract has been under attack
lately because of its Department of
Defense funding after it was published
in a SWOPSI workshop booklet last
spring on DOD funding.
Zimbardo noted that all of this and
any other research is public and the
Office of Naval Research gets one copy
of the same report that is released
publicly.
He added that 57% of his funding
goes to Stanford as overhead and that
his research is not dictated by any
military problem nor modified in any
way by the government.

when they could go to the toilet, if
indeed they could at all, controlling
their meals, and deciding who should
get blankets or other "privileges."
Prisoners Affected Equally
The prisoners were equally affected
by the experience. On the second day
there was a prisoner rebellion where
some prisoners barricaded themselves
in, refused to eat, ripped off their
numbers, and started screaming
obscenities at the guards in an effort to
assert their freedom and individuality.
This rebellion was put down by a
reinforced group of guards using
physical force and psychological
tactics. After this the prisoners became
increasingly servile, following the
whimsy and arbitrary commands of the
guards. On the fifth day one prisoner
made a last futile attempt to assert his
individuality and freedom by refusing
to eat.
Although he had formerly been a
hero for the other prisoners he now
became a source of trouble. The guards
put this prisoner in the "hole" a small
2x4 closet and told the other prisoners
that if they wanted him out of the hole
for the night they would have to give
up their blankets. Although it wasn't
cold, the prisoners voted to keep their
blankets and let him rot in solitary.
Profound Effect
Zimbardo pointed out another very
profound effect on a prisoner after
only four days of the experiment.
"They had been in prison only four
days at this point, but those 4 days
were enough because their sense of
time had developed, indeed, so had
their sense of moral value. When a
prisoner got sick on this day, before I
released him I put him in a room to
rest.
The guards picking up on this used it
as an opportunity now to set the
prisoners against each other-had the
prisoners chant that 819 was a terrible
prisoner and on and on. When I realized
what was happening I went in to the
prisoner and said "let's leave." He was
falling and crying and couldn't leave
being a bad prisoner so I said "Your

name is Stu Levin, and I'm Dr.
Zimbardo, this is an experiment, you're
not a bad prisoner.
"He stopped crying instantly, looked
up at me and said, "0.K., let's go." It
was as if you had woken from a terrible
dream and at that point we realized the
experiment had gone too far, it had
become a prison."
Before the week was over it was
decided that the experiment would be
ended early. In trying to assert their
freedom the prisoners had become so
upset that three had to be released in
states of virtual emotional shock,
crying hysterically, one broke out in a
psychosomatic rash over his body, and
the others begged to be released,
offering to forfeit their pay for parole.
The guards were also strongly affected
by the experience, upset by what they
had been led to do by their roles.
'Warden' Speaks
Curt Banks, a "warden" of the
prison and a graduate student in
Psychology working under Dr.
Zimbardo explained some of the
significance of the experiment. "The
hypothesis is generally that prison is
bad because of the bad people there.
We have shown that with a group of
normal students a very bad prison
situation can be created.

"These people didn't have the
notoriety of a trial, the threat to life
and limb often found in prison, or the
homosexuality problems to face in
their prisons. The important factors
were the de-individuation of both the
prisoners and guards, the
dehumanization, and the confinement,
not the fact that the prison was formed
with a "bad" group of prisoners or a
group of sadistic guards."
Banks added that the data from the
experiment which is recorded on
movies, tapes, slides, and videotapes is
still being analyzed.
Dr. Zimbardo will be presenting his
project to the public in a forthcoming
NBC show "Chronolog" which will
probably be aired the last Friday in
October or November.
No Simple Solution
The results of his prison experiment
and his other studies regarding
imprisonment lead him to suggest
several basic things which can be done
to improve prison life. Zimbardo
cautions that "there is no simple
solution to this complex social and
psychological problem."
The task must begin before a man
gets into prison for he usually gets
there when he has been excluded from

cells at all hours to count them off. Hospital type gowns and stocking caps were
part of the prison garb.
the rewards system of our society
because of social class or poverty.
"Once in prison the basic assumption
is that a man can be made good
through punishment. Our psychological
studies show that punishment will only
bring about at best a temporary change
which disappears when the punishing
agent is removed."
Zimbardo feels the prisoner/guard
relationship must be changed to a
counselor-trainee relationship. Positive
reinforcement will be necessary and the
prison years should be spent training to
do something which will give the
prisoner self-worth rather than making
license plates or furniture.
If prison could be used to train
people as psychiatric aides or to work
in old age homes, "we would be helping
people in the best way we know how,
by letting them help others," says
Zimbardo.
He added that "a person has been
successfully helped in prison only if he
has been changed in ways which he
thinks are good for him."
Cloak Of Secrecy
Another important step according to
Zimbardo will be to remove the cloak
of secrecy which surrounds prisons by
making their activities accessible to the
public or some neutral ombudsman

type person responsible neither to the
prisoners nor the administration. He
warns "don't take the prisoner out of
the community, the prisoner must feel
a worth and caring if he is to be
helped."
With such simple things as paying the
prisoners more than their present 2-l(i
cents per hour wage, the prisoner's self
worth could be built up and he could
be taken into the reward structure and
the community.
The prison experiment which arose
from Zimbardo's summer class was
funded by the money provided by the
Office of Naval Research for
Zimbardo's larger project titled
"Individual and Group Variables
Influencing Emotional Arousal,
Violence, and Behavior."
This contract has been under attack
lately because of its Department of
Defense funding after it was published
in a SWOPSI workshop booklet last
spring on DOD funding.
Zimbardo noted that all of this and
any other research is public and the
Office of Naval Research gets one copy
of the same report that is released
publicly.
He added that 57% of his funding
goes to Stanford as overhead and that
his research is not dictated by any
military problem nor modified in any
way by the government.
Take normal, healthy, college age
students; divide them into guards and
prisoners arbitrarily, establish an
experimental "prison," and the results
are devastating.
Such an experiment was performed
this August by Dr. Philip Zimbardo of
the Department of Psychology and
according to him "when the American
people are exposed to the results of this
experiment it could well prove to be
the most significant agent toward
prison reform yet in this country."
In the light of summer prison
uprisings such as Attica, Zimbardo's
experiment takes on special interest.
The study grew out of a summer course
on the "Psychology of the
Imprisoned," taught by Zimbardo
aided by a 16 year ex-con, Carlos
Prescott.
The research project was designed to
help understand what goes into creating
and maintaining a prison and what the
prison experience does to the prisoners,
guards, and power establishment. The
study was in part to examine what are
the effects of arbitrarily labelling one
person "guard" and another
"prisoner."
The study began with an ad in the
city newspaper where applicants were
offered $15 a day for a two week
study. The first 70 applicants were
screened so that the final 24 chosen
were psychologically and medically
well-adjusted college students. By the
flip of the coin they were arbitrarily
divided into guards and prisoners and
the project was ready to begin.
Palo Alto Police Involved
Zimbardo described how the Palo
Alto police got the study rolling. "On a
quiet Sunday morning a Palo Alto
Police car swept through various
neighborhoods of the city, picked up
each of the boys who were going to be
prisoners individually. We had told
them simply to wait at home and
they'd be contacted. The police booked
them, frisked them, fingerprinted them,
blindfolded them, put them in
detention, and the boys still in a state
of surprise were picked up by our men
and brought down to our prison in the
basement of the Psychology
Department.
Each had been arrested for suspicion
of an alleged crime. The prisoners were
stripped naked, deloused, and put into
uniform. A stocking cap covered his
hair and made it look as if he had his
head shaved. A locked chain was
attached to one ankle which was to be
worn at all times, and the prisoner put
into a cell with two others and not
allowed to talk."

What happened the ensuing week
was crushing in its implications. The
group labelled guards, dressed in
uniforms and mirror sunglasses, and put
in charge under the supervision of
Zi.nbardo and his three graduate
student "wardens," became perverted
by the sense of power they felt.
They taunted, upbraided, and
humiliated the prisoners, often making
them stand for long hours and count
off their numbers. By the third day of
the experiment the guards were
controlling prisoners' lives, telling them
when they could go to the toilet, if
indeed they could at all, controlling
their meals, and deciding who should
get blankets or other "privileges."

prison and a graduate student in
Psychology working under Dr.
Zimbardo explained some of the
significance of the experiment. "The
hypothesis is generally that prison is
bad because of the bad people there.
We have shown that with a group of
normal students a very bad prison
situation can be created.

"These people didn't have the
notoriety of a trial, the threat to life
and limb often found in prison, or the
homosexuality problems to face in
their prisons. The important factors
were the de-individuation of both the
prisoners and guards, the
dehumanization, and the confinement,
not the fact that the prison was formed
with a "bad" group of prisoners or a
group of sadistic guards."
Banks added that the data from the
experiment which is recorded on
movies, tapes, slides, and videotapes is
still being analyzed.
Dr. Zimbardo will be presenting his
project to the public in a forthcoming
NBC show "Chronolog" which will
probably be aired the last Friday in
October or November.
No Simple Solution
The results of his prison experiment
and his other studies regarding
imprisonment lead him to suggest
several basic things which can be done
to improve prison life. Zimbardo
cautions that "there is no simple
solution to this complex social and
psychological problem."
The task must begin before a man
gets into prison for he usually gets
there when he has been excluded from

part of the prison garb.
the rewards system of our society
because of social class or poverty.
"Once in prison the basic assumption
is that a man can be made good
through punishment. Our psychological
studies show that punishment will only
bring about at best a temporary change
which disappears when the punishing
agent is removed."
Zimbardo feels the prisoner/guard
relationship must be changed to a
counselor-trainee relationship. Positive
reinforcement will be necessary and the
prison years should be spent training to
do something which will give the
prisoner self-worth rather than making
license plates or furniture.
If prison could be used to train
people as psychiatric aides or to work
in old age homes, "we would be helping
people in the best way we know how,
by letting them help others," says
Zimbardo.
He added that "a person has been
successfully helped in prison only if he
has been changed in ways which he
thinks are good for him."
Cloak Of Secrecy
Another important step according to
Zimbardo will be to remove the cloak
of secrecy which surrounds prisons by
making their activities accessible to the
public or some neutral ombudsman

type person responsible neither to the
prisoners nor the administration. He
warns "don't take the prisoner out of
the community, the prisoner must feel
a worth and caring if he is to be
helped."
With such simple things as paying the
prisoners more than their present 2-l(i
cents per hour wage, the prisoner's self
worth could be built up and he could
be taken into the reward structure and
the community.
The prison experiment which arose
from Zimbardo's summer class was
funded by the money provided by the
Office of Naval Research for
Zimbardo's larger project titled
"Individual and Group Variables
Influencing Emotional Arousal,
Violence, and Behavior."
This contract has been under attack
lately because of its Department of
Defense funding after it was published
in a SWOPSI workshop booklet last
spring on DOD funding.
Zimbardo noted that all of this and
any other research is public and the
Office of Naval Research gets one copy
of the same report that is released
publicly.
He added that 57% of his funding
goes to Stanford as overhead and that
his research is not dictated by any
military problem nor modified in any
way by the government.
Take normal, healthy, college age
students; divide them into guards and
prisoners arbitrarily, establish an
experimental "prison," and the results
are devastating.
Such an experiment was performed
this August by Dr. Philip Zimbardo of
the Department of Psychology and
according to him "when the American
people are exposed to the results of this
experiment it could well prove to be
the most significant agent toward
prison reform yet in this country."
In the light of summer prison
uprisings such as Attica, Zimbardo's
experiment takes on special interest.
The study grew out of a summer course
on the "Psychology of the
Imprisoned," taught by Zimbardo
aided by a 16 year ex-con, Carlos
Prescott.
The research project was designed to
help understand what goes into creating
and maintaining a prison and what the
prison experience does to the prisoners,
guards, and power establishment. The
study was in part to examine what are
the effects of arbitrarily labelling one
person "guard" and another
"prisoner."
The study began with an ad in the
city newspaper where applicants were
offered $15 a day for a two week
study. The first 70 applicants were
screened so that the final 24 chosen
were psychologically and medically
well-adjusted college students. By the
flip of the coin they were arbitrarily
divided into guards and prisoners and
the project was ready to begin.
Palo Alto Police Involved
Zimbardo described how the Palo
Alto police got the study rolling. "On a
quiet Sunday morning a Palo Alto
Police car swept through various
neighborhoods of the city, picked up
each of the boys who were going to be
prisoners individually. We had told
them simply to wait at home and
they'd be contacted. The police booked
them, frisked them, fingerprinted them,
blindfolded them, put them in
detention, and the boys still in a state
of surprise were picked up by our men
and brought down to our prison in the
basement of the Psychology
Department.
Each had been arrested for suspicion
of an alleged crime. The prisoners were
stripped naked, deloused, and put into
uniform. A stocking cap covered his
hair and made it look as if he had his
head shaved. A locked chain was
attached to one ankle which was to be
worn at all times, and the prisoner put
into a cell with two others and not
allowed to talk."

What happened the ensuing week
was crushing in its implications. The
group labelled guards, dressed in
uniforms and mirror sunglasses, and put
in charge under the supervision of
Zi.nbardo and his three graduate
student "wardens," became perverted
by the sense of power they felt.
They taunted, upbraided, and
humiliated the prisoners, often making
them stand for long hours and count
off their numbers. By the third day of
the experiment the guards were
controlling prisoners' lives, telling them
when they could go to the toilet, if
indeed they could at all, controlling
their meals, and deciding who should
get blankets or other "privileges."
Prisoners Affected Equally
The prisoners were equally affected
by the experience. On the second day
there was a prisoner rebellion where
some prisoners barricaded themselves
in, refused to eat, ripped off their
numbers, and started screaming
obscenities at the guards in an effort to
assert their freedom and individuality.
This rebellion was put down by a
reinforced group of guards using
physical force and psychological
tactics. After this the prisoners became
increasingly servile, following the
whimsy and arbitrary commands of the
guards. On the fifth day one prisoner
made a last futile attempt to assert his
individuality and freedom by refusing
to eat.
Although he had formerly been a
hero for the other prisoners he now
became a source of trouble. The guards
put this prisoner in the "hole" a small
2x4 closet and told the other prisoners
that if they wanted him out of the hole
for the night they would have to give
up their blankets. Although it wasn't
cold, the prisoners voted to keep their
blankets and let him rot in solitary.
Profound Effect
Zimbardo pointed out another very
profound effect on a prisoner after
only four days of the experiment.
"They had been in prison only four
days at this point, but those 4 days
were enough because their sense of
time had developed, indeed, so had
their sense of moral value. When a
prisoner got sick on this day, before I
released him I put him in a room to
rest.
The guards picking up on this used it
as an opportunity now to set the
prisoners against each other-had the
prisoners chant that 819 was a terrible
prisoner and on and on. When I realized
what was happening I went in to the
prisoner and said "let's leave." He was
falling and crying and couldn't leave
being a bad prisoner so I said "Your

name is Stu Levin, and I'm Dr.
Zimbardo, this is an experiment, you're
not a bad prisoner.
"He stopped crying instantly, looked
up at me and said, "0.K., let's go." It
was as if you had woken from a terrible
dream and at that point we realized the
experiment had gone too far, it had
become a prison."
Before the week was over it was
decided that the experiment would be
ended early. In trying to assert their
freedom the prisoners had become so
upset that three had to be released in
states of virtual emotional shock,
crying hysterically, one broke out in a
psychosomatic rash over his body, and
the others begged to be released,
offering to forfeit their pay for parole.
The guards were also strongly affected
by the experience, upset by what they
had been led to do by their roles.

the community, the prisoner must feel
a worth and caring if he is to be
helped."
With such simple things as paying the
prisoners more than their present 2-l(i
cents per hour wage, the prisoner's self
worth could be built up and he could
be taken into the reward structure and
the community.
The prison experiment which arose
from Zimbardo's summer class was
funded by the money provided by the
Office of Naval Research for
Zimbardo's larger project titled
"Individual and Group Variables
Influencing Emotional Arousal,
Violence, and Behavior."
This contract has been under attack
lately because of its Department of
Defense funding after it was published
in a SWOPSI workshop booklet last
spring on DOD funding.
Zimbardo noted that all of this and
any other research is public and the
Office of Naval Research gets one copy
of the same report that is released
publicly.
He added that 57% of his funding
goes to Stanford as overhead and that
his research is not dictated by any
military problem nor modified in any
way by the government.
Take normal, healthy, college age
students; divide them into guards and
prisoners arbitrarily, establish an
experimental "prison," and the results
are devastating.
Such an experiment was performed
this August by Dr. Philip Zimbardo of
the Department of Psychology and
according to him "when the American
people are exposed to the results of this
experiment it could well prove to be
the most significant agent toward
prison reform yet in this country."
In the light of summer prison
uprisings such as Attica, Zimbardo's
experiment takes on special interest.
The study grew out of a summer course
on the "Psychology of the
Imprisoned," taught by Zimbardo
aided by a 16 year ex-con, Carlos
Prescott.
The research project was designed to
help understand what goes into creating
and maintaining a prison and what the
prison experience does to the prisoners,
guards, and power establishment. The
study was in part to examine what are
the effects of arbitrarily labelling one
person "guard" and another
"prisoner."
The study began with an ad in the
city newspaper where applicants were
offered $15 a day for a two week
study. The first 70 applicants were
screened so that the final 24 chosen
were psychologically and medically
well-adjusted college students. By the
flip of the coin they were arbitrarily
divided into guards and prisoners and
the project was ready to begin.
Palo Alto Police Involved
Zimbardo described how the Palo
Alto police got the study rolling. "On a
quiet Sunday morning a Palo Alto
Police car swept through various
neighborhoods of the city, picked up
each of the boys who were going to be
prisoners individually. We had told
them simply to wait at home and
they'd be contacted. The police booked
them, frisked them, fingerprinted them,
blindfolded them, put them in
detention, and the boys still in a state
of surprise were picked up by our men
and brought down to our prison in the
basement of the Psychology
Department.
Each had been arrested for suspicion
of an alleged crime. The prisoners were
stripped naked, deloused, and put into
uniform. A stocking cap covered his
hair and made it look as if he had his
head shaved. A locked chain was
attached to one ankle which was to be
worn at all times, and the prisoner put
into a cell with two others and not
allowed to talk."

What happened the ensuing week
was crushing in its implications. The
group labelled guards, dressed in
uniforms and mirror sunglasses, and put
in charge under the supervision of
Zi.nbardo and his three graduate
student "wardens," became perverted
by the sense of power they felt.
They taunted, upbraided, and
humiliated the prisoners, often making
them stand for long hours and count
off their numbers. By the third day of
the experiment the guards were
controlling prisoners' lives, telling them
when they could go to the toilet, if
indeed they could at all, controlling
their meals, and deciding who should
get blankets or other "privileges."
Prisoners Affected Equally
The prisoners were equally affected
by the experience. On the second day
there was a prisoner rebellion where
some prisoners barricaded themselves
in, refused to eat, ripped off their
numbers, and started screaming
obscenities at the guards in an effort to
assert their freedom and individuality.
This rebellion was put down by a
reinforced group of guards using
physical force and psychological
tactics. After this the prisoners became
increasingly servile, following the
whimsy and arbitrary commands of the
guards. On the fifth day one prisoner
made a last futile attempt to assert his
individuality and freedom by refusing
to eat.
Although he had formerly been a
hero for the other prisoners he now
became a source of trouble. The guards
put this prisoner in the "hole" a small
2x4 closet and told the other prisoners
that if they wanted him out of the hole
for the night they would have to give
up their blankets. Although it wasn't
cold, the prisoners voted to keep their
blankets and let him rot in solitary.
Profound Effect
Zimbardo pointed out another very
profound effect on a prisoner after
only four days of the experiment.
"They had been in prison only four
days at this point, but those 4 days
were enough because their sense of
time had developed, indeed, so had
their sense of moral value. When a
prisoner got sick on this day, before I
released him I put him in a room to
rest.
The guards picking up on this used it
as an opportunity now to set the
prisoners against each other-had the
prisoners chant that 819 was a terrible
prisoner and on and on. When I realized
what was happening I went in to the
prisoner and said "let's leave." He was
falling and crying and couldn't leave
being a bad prisoner so I said "Your

name is Stu Levin, and I'm Dr.
Zimbardo, this is an experiment, you're
not a bad prisoner.
"He stopped crying instantly, looked
up at me and said, "0.K., let's go." It
was as if you had woken from a terrible
dream and at that point we realized the
experiment had gone too far, it had
become a prison."
Before the week was over it was
decided that the experiment would be
ended early. In trying to assert their
freedom the prisoners had become so
upset that three had to be released in
states of virtual emotional shock,
crying hysterically, one broke out in a
psychosomatic rash over his body, and
the others begged to be released,
offering to forfeit their pay for parole.
The guards were also strongly affected
by the experience, upset by what they
had been led to do by their roles.
'Warden' Speaks
Curt Banks, a "warden" of the
prison and a graduate student in
Psychology working under Dr.
Zimbardo explained some of the
significance of the experiment. "The
hypothesis is generally that prison is
bad because of the bad people there.
We have shown that with a group of
normal students a very bad prison
situation can be created.

"These people didn't have the
notoriety of a trial, the threat to life
and limb often found in prison, or the
homosexuality problems to face in
their prisons. The important factors
were the de-individuation of both the
prisoners and guards, the
dehumanization, and the confinement,
not the fact that the prison was formed
with a "bad" group of prisoners or a
group of sadistic guards."
Banks added that the data from the
experiment which is recorded on
movies, tapes, slides, and videotapes is
still being analyzed.
Dr. Zimbardo will be presenting his
project to the public in a forthcoming
NBC show "Chronolog" which will
probably be aired the last Friday in
October or November.
No Simple Solution
The results of his prison experiment
and his other studies regarding
imprisonment lead him to suggest
several basic things which can be done
to improve prison life. Zimbardo
cautions that "there is no simple
solution to this complex social and
psychological problem."
The task must begin before a man
gets into prison for he usually gets
there when he has been excluded from

prisoners were required to memorize their numbers and were removed from their
cells at all hours to count them off. Hospital type gowns and stocking caps were

the rewards system of our society
because of social class or poverty.
"Once in prison the basic assumption
is that a man can be made good
through punishment. Our psychological
studies show that punishment will only
bring about at best a temporary change
which disappears when the punishing
agent is removed."
Zimbardo feels the prisoner/guard
relationship must be changed to a
counselor-trainee relationship. Positive
reinforcement will be necessary and the
prison years should be spent training to
do something which will give the
prisoner self-worth rather than making
license plates or furniture.
If prison could be used to train
people as psychiatric aides or to work
in old age homes, "we would be helping
people in the best way we know how,
by letting them help others," says
Zimbardo.
He added that "a person has been
successfully helped in prison only if he
has been changed in ways which he
thinks are good for him."
Cloak Of Secrecy
Another important step according to
Zimbardo will be to remove the cloak
of secrecy which surrounds prisons by
making their activities accessible to the
public or some neutral ombudsman

type person responsible neither to the
prisoners nor the administration. He
warns "don't take the prisoner out of
the community, the prisoner must feel
a worth and caring if he is to be
helped."
With such simple things as paying the
prisoners more than their present 2-l(i

blindfolded them, put them in
detention, and the boys still in a state
of surprise were picked up by our men
and brought down to our prison in the
basement of the Psychology
Department.
Each had been arrested for suspicion
of an alleged crime. The prisoners were
stripped naked, deloused, and put into
uniform. A stocking cap covered his
hair and made it look as if he had his
head shaved. A locked chain was
attached to one ankle which was to be
worn at all times, and the prisoner put
into a cell with two others and not
allowed to talk."

What happened the ensuing week
was crushing in its implications. The
group labelled guards, dressed in
uniforms and mirror sunglasses, and put
in charge under the supervision of
Zi.nbardo and his three graduate
student "wardens," became perverted
by the sense of power they felt.
They taunted, upbraided, and
humiliated the prisoners, often making
them stand for long hours and count
off their numbers. By the third day of
the experiment the guards were
controlling prisoners' lives, telling them
when they could go to the toilet, if
indeed they could at all, controlling
their meals, and deciding who should
get blankets or other "privileges."
Prisoners Affected Equally
The prisoners were equally affected
by the experience. On the second day
there was a prisoner rebellion where
some prisoners barricaded themselves
in, refused to eat, ripped off their
numbers, and started screaming
obscenities at the guards in an effort to
assert their freedom and individuality.
This rebellion was put down by a
reinforced group of guards using
physical force and psychological
tactics. After this the prisoners became
increasingly servile, following the
whimsy and arbitrary commands of the
guards. On the fifth day one prisoner
made a last futile attempt to assert his
individuality and freedom by refusing
to eat.
Although he had formerly been a
hero for the other prisoners he now
became a source of trouble. The guards
put this prisoner in the "hole" a small
2x4 closet and told the other prisoners
that if they wanted him out of the hole
for the night they would have to give
up their blankets. Although it wasn't
cold, the prisoners voted to keep their
blankets and let him rot in solitary.
Profound Effect
Zimbardo pointed out another very
profound effect on a prisoner after
only four days of the experiment.
"They had been in prison only four
days at this point, but those 4 days
were enough because their sense of
time had developed, indeed, so had
their sense of moral value. When a
prisoner got sick on this day, before I
released him I put him in a room to
rest.
The guards picking up on this used it
as an opportunity now to set the
prisoners against each other-had the
prisoners chant that 819 was a terrible
prisoner and on and on. When I realized
what was happening I went in to the
prisoner and said "let's leave." He was
falling and crying and couldn't leave
being a bad prisoner so I said "Your

name is Stu Levin, and I'm Dr.
Zimbardo, this is an experiment, you're
not a bad prisoner.
"He stopped crying instantly, looked
up at me and said, "0.K., let's go." It
was as if you had woken from a terrible
dream and at that point we realized the
experiment had gone too far, it had
become a prison."
Before the week was over it was
decided that the experiment would be
ended early. In trying to assert their
freedom the prisoners had become so
upset that three had to be released in
states of virtual emotional shock,
crying hysterically, one broke out in a
psychosomatic rash over his body, and
the others begged to be released,
offering to forfeit their pay for parole.
The guards were also strongly affected
by the experience, upset by what they
had been led to do by their roles.
'Warden' Speaks
Curt Banks, a "warden" of the
prison and a graduate student in
Psychology working under Dr.
Zimbardo explained some of the
significance of the experiment. "The
hypothesis is generally that prison is
bad because of the bad people there.
We have shown that with a group of
normal students a very bad prison
situation can be created.

"These people didn't have the
notoriety of a trial, the threat to life
and limb often found in prison, or the
homosexuality problems to face in
their prisons. The important factors
were the de-individuation of both the
prisoners and guards, the
dehumanization, and the confinement,
not the fact that the prison was formed
with a "bad" group of prisoners or a
group of sadistic guards."
Banks added that the data from the
experiment which is recorded on
movies, tapes, slides, and videotapes is
still being analyzed.
Dr. Zimbardo will be presenting his
project to the public in a forthcoming
NBC show "Chronolog" which will
probably be aired the last Friday in
October or November.
No Simple Solution
The results of his prison experiment
and his other studies regarding
imprisonment lead him to suggest
several basic things which can be done
to improve prison life. Zimbardo
cautions that "there is no simple
solution to this complex social and
psychological problem."
The task must begin before a man
gets into prison for he usually gets
there when he has been excluded from

cells at all hours to count them off. Hospital type gowns and stocking caps were
part of the prison garb.
the rewards system of our society
because of social class or poverty.
"Once in prison the basic assumption
is that a man can be made good
through punishment. Our psychological
studies show that punishment will only
bring about at best a temporary change
which disappears when the punishing
agent is removed."
Zimbardo feels the prisoner/guard
relationship must be changed to a
counselor-trainee relationship. Positive
reinforcement will be necessary and the
prison years should be spent training to
do something which will give the
prisoner self-worth rather than making
license plates or furniture.
If prison could be used to train
people as psychiatric aides or to work
in old age homes, "we would be helping
people in the best way we know how,
by letting them help others," says
Zimbardo.
He added that "a person has been
successfully helped in prison only if he
has been changed in ways which he
thinks are good for him."
Cloak Of Secrecy
Another important step according to
Zimbardo will be to remove the cloak
of secrecy which surrounds prisons by
making their activities accessible to the
public or some neutral ombudsman

type person responsible neither to the
prisoners nor the administration. He
warns "don't take the prisoner out of
the community, the prisoner must feel
a worth and caring if he is to be
helped."
With such simple things as paying the
prisoners more than their present 2-l(i
cents per hour wage, the prisoner's self
worth could be built up and he could
be taken into the reward structure and
the community.
The prison experiment which arose
from Zimbardo's summer class was
funded by the money provided by the
Office of Naval Research for
Zimbardo's larger project titled
"Individual and Group Variables
Influencing Emotional Arousal,
Violence, and Behavior."
This contract has been under attack
lately because of its Department of
Defense funding after it was published
in a SWOPSI workshop booklet last
spring on DOD funding.
Zimbardo noted that all of this and
any other research is public and the
Office of Naval Research gets one copy
of the same report that is released
publicly.
He added that 57% of his funding
goes to Stanford as overhead and that
his research is not dictated by any
military problem nor modified in any
way by the government.
