# In A Dorm Saturday Night
## 
### 
Hanging around the dorm on a
Saturday night. Oh don't mind
me, just waiting for my wild
gypsy lover to show up, and what
are you doing hanging around the
dorm on a Saturday night? You
some kind of social re-ject?

Prince Charming, due any second
now. God knows it's about time;
he's two weeks late already.
Prince Charming? Does he live
in the trailers?
He's a junior in philosophy
from Pasadena.

Well if you can't do it. . .
You can always talk about it
and think about it and eat a
couple candy bars and get fat and
ugly and take a shower and get
clean and fat and ugly and sit
around being depressed.
Yeah, the old Saturday night
standby. Where are you when we
need you, Mad Rapist?
When?
Who?
How?
If you have to ask. . .
Shut up and wait.
