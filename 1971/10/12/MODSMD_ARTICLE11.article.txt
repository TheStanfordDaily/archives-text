Well, gee, I gotta lotta work to
do.
On a Saturday night?
Oh yeah, lotta work. Gotta
read my history, psych. Write
some letters.
On a Saturday night?
Shut up, you.
Well me I got lots of things I
could do if I wanted. Just too
tired. Yeah, that's it. Had a ' real
busy week, parties every night.
Yeah, I know how it is, being a
Stanford Dollie. 2:1 ratio, one
date after another. Boys just
knocking on my door all the time.
Hey what's that?
That? What?
You hear something?
No.
Oh. Well, like I say. All these
reckless love affairs can really get
you. . .
Nowhere.
I know where. I've been there.

long walks in the rain—and
suddenly we'll feel like we've
known each other for years.
"Stewart," I'll say to him, "I
feel like I've known you for
years."
"Gosh, That's funny," he'll
respond warmly. "I feel the same
way." Then he'll take me in his
arms. ..
Don't stop now. You're getting
to the good part.
What are you, some kind of
voyeur?
