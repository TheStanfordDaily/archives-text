# Pre-Med Students Receive Redone Advisory Program
## 
### ANDY ISRAEL 
The Stanford pre-med can look
forward to an improved advising
program in the eoming years.
Coordinated by the Academic
Information Center and staffed by
advisors from the Medical School,
the program will be one of "more
definitive thought and action"
than the ones in the past,
according to pre-professional
advisor Peter Pansing of the AIC.
The Pre-Medical Advising
Program will be centered in the
AIC and independent of the
pre-medical society, Sigma Phi
Sigma. A file will be kept on each
student including information
about which medical schools he is
applying to, letters of
recommendation from instructors,
a duplicate record of his advisor's
file, a record of responses from
schools, and possibly letters of
evaluation from teachers of
various courses.
A board will be established to
screen this file (kept up to date by
the student) and write a central
Pre-Medical Advisory Committee
letter of recommendation. Many
medical schools request a letter
from such a committee and other
schools such as Yale have them in
operation. There are an estimated
75 0 pre-meds according to
Pansing, so the bookkeeping will

be a "task, to say the least," he
notes.
Dr. Henry Jones of the
Department of Radiology is
faculty representative to the
advising committee. He related
that there are "about 35 faculty
advisors with student loads from 3
to over fifty. We are trying to add
people to the advising staff."
Jones explained that most of
the upperclassmen and transfers
who decide to go pre-med are
assigned to a small group of
experienced but overworked
advisors who can handle their
special circumstances. So, while
the freshman student indicating a
pre-med preference is assigned an
advisor, the upperclassman must
go to the AIC where he will be
assigned one.
The new Pre Medical Advisory
Program will encourage other
information sources besides
student/advisor sessions. It is
planning a forum October 14, at
7:30 p.m., Room Mlo6 at the
Medical School on the techniques
of medical school application and
interview aimed primarily at
juniors and seniors involved in this
process.
Two weeks later on October
28, at 7:30 p.m. in Room MlO6
at the medical school a panel
discussion to orient freshmen and

sophomores to a career in
medicine will be held featuring
the Dean of the Medical School,
the Dean of Admissions, and
several doctors representing
different departments.
