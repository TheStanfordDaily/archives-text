# Presidential Commission Report on Status of Stanford Police
## 
### 
The Presidential Commission on the
Status of the Stanford Police, which was
appointed hy President Lyman last May,
issued its final report Monday, Oct. 4, in
which it unanimously set forth /1 recom
mendations.
President Lyman noted that he and his
staff would be studying the report over
the next few weeks and that, in view of
the importance of the matter and the
concerns expressed by so many members
of the community, the entire report is
being released immediately.
The text follows:
In response to your memorandum of
May 28, I 1, the Commission has over a
period of four months interviewed experi
enced police officials here and elsewhere,
read deeply in the literature on this and
other such police forces, collected infor
mation on particular points of law and
finance, and deliberated on these matters
at 17 lengthy meetings. Though we have
familiarized ourselves with the complex
legal, operational, fiscal, and political as
pects of the question, we do not in this
memorandum set out the background of
fact and history with which you are of
course familiar. What we have done is to
agree on a rationale for the relationship
between any community and its police
force and then to apply it to the Stanford
situation. This analysis resulted in the fol
lowing sequence of 1 I "propositions," on
which we have unanimously agreed, and
which constitutes our formal report to
you.
1. One security force in any community
should handle both police service duties
and law-enforcement duties.
Most of the time (a figure of 80% has
frequently been mentioned) of a police
force is spent on service matters traffic
control, checking vacant houses, first-aid,
finding lost children, crowd control at
public events, noise abatement, register
ing bicycles, etc. It is inefficient, concep
tionally flawed, and operationally cum
bersome for the security function to be
divided between an "inside service unit"
and an "outside law-enforcement unit."
A divided responsibility obscures lines of
response and control and confuses the
definition of the police officer's role for
both officer and citizen. Consequences of
divided responsibility run from unaccep
table delays in police responses to reports
of crime to lack of authority to move
damaged vehicles tying up traffic. While
unity of responsibility requires peace
officer status for such a force, not all
personnel need be sworn.
2. A police force should be identified, by
both officers and citizenry, with the com
munity it serves.
The virtue of this with respect to ser
vice matters is obvious. Nearly as obvious
is its importance in law-enforcement: a
local and familiar police force will have
an understanding of its community clear
ly superior to that of an outside force
about the nature of particular conduct,
about the way of life and sensibilities of
the different parts of the community,
about the role and characteristics of parti
cular individuals in it. There can be no
doubt that in matters of law-enforce
ment both in day-to-day protection of
the community and in volatile situations
a local force, with operational control
over mutual-aid forces, would make for
lessened tensions, more accurate percep
tions, anil more controlled responses.
3. Stanford is an identifiable community
with some of the special characteristics
of a town or city and with some of the
special characteristics that bring commun
ity pressure for local control of the
police.
4. It follows from these three proposi
tions that Stanford ideally should have an
indigenous police force, with peace
officer status.
In asserting this, the Commission re
cognizes two facts with respect to the
establishment of police forces in com
munities elsewhere: (a) That a county
sheriff's office primarily provides custo
dial and procedural police services (serv

ing warrants and other official papers,
taking custody of prisoners, etc.) and in
vestigates crimes in certain areas; it can
not provide for Stanford those commun
ity police services that involve continuous
local law enforcement and protection and
the studied and constant development of
good local community relations and com
munication. (b) That the promptness
with which all communities upon incor
poration establish their own police forces
reflects what is clearly an operational and
philosophical need for "community con
trol." That is also a reason for the peace
officer status of the campus police forces
at state university and college campuses.
And it is also the reason why the Com
mission comes naturally to the conclusion
that there are practical and social advan
tages to having a police force responsive
more to the perceptions of the local com
munity than, say, to those of a commun
ity 60 miles away.
5. Not all members of the force need be
sworn officers, but the general authority
and the general standards of the depart
ment should be those of a sworn force.
The most striking effect of peace
officer status would be on recruitment
practices, on the quality of personnel
who would be attracted, on training, and
on the working relationships with other
law-enforcement agencies. A Stanford
police force should if possible draw some
of its character and strength from an in
volvement in the academic lile of the
University. The special characteristic of
the University as a place of learning offers
an opportunity to some members of the
police force froth to further their general
education and to study those problems of
society on which the police role often so
significantly impinges. There are oppor
tunities for a student role in part-time
police service as well as for an officer role
as part-time student; at Berkeley students
act as dispatchers, service equipment,
maintain fixed traffic posts, and assist in
crowd control at public events. Peace
officer status would give Stanford access
to state police-training programs; there
would be the possibility of admitting to a
B.A. program (perhaps with points on
admission given for police experience) al
ready trained and sworn junior-college
graduates; and, because of the higher
standards and status of peace officers,
Stanford could compete more effectively
in the recruitment of black and chicano
officers and supervisors, something the
Commission feels is of great importance.
6. There is no possibility, under the
scheme providing full police services by a
local Stanford force having peace-otticer
status, that taxes can relieve the Univer
sity of the bulk of the financial burden.
All of the options that provide tor a
taxing unit define the taxing base for the
whole campus as consisting largely ot the
faculty residential area; either law or
practicality prevents sufficient taxes from
being raised from that base. Defraying the
cost for any police district would accord
ingly depend on an agreement with the
University.
7. It is doubtful that the Board of Trus
tees would voluntarily turn over to any
public agency that legal power to tax its
properties-or otherwise to call upon its
financial resources—without its consent.
As a practical matter, this rules out
some of the options theoretically possi
ble such as incorporation or a separate
police district—for the establishment ot a
sworn police force. Other reasons as well
persuade us of the complete impractica
bility of a separate police district, the
possibilities for which the ( ommission
examined carefully. With respect to voter
control, for example, it is clear that such
a district however its voting residents
might be defined would disenfranchise
the entire staff, a good portion of the
faculty, and a large number of students.
The municipal analogy was considered in
apposite, given the signficant diflerences
between the attachment to the institution
of Stanford's nonresident daytime popu
lation and the typical nonresident com
muter's lack of involvement in govern
ment affairs of the community in which
he works.
Again, in order for such a district to be
formed, both the Local Agency For
mation Commission (LAFCO) and the
Board of Supervisors would have to be

(Published with financial support from the University Relations OJJk

satisfied that there is no other more
reasonable possibility to obtain the de
sired service, that no special interest
group would be given the status ot a
governmental agency, that the district is
economically feasible, and, after appro
priate hearings, that the formation of the
district is in the public interest. The Com
mission saw no possibility of obtaining
the necessary approval, absent solutions
to the tax-base problem, the voter
constituency problem, and the problem
posed by the unitary ownership of all
property in the district.
8. It is unlikely that the Trustees would
agree to an arrangement that turned over
to any outside agency operational con
trol—and therefore responsibility—of a
police force paid wholly and voluntarily
by the University.
Since the Trustees cannot legally di
vest themselves of the total fiscal and
operational responsibility that is theirs
for the University, any delegation of
authority would have to be to an internal
mechanism that included both a large role
for the University administration and per
haps a legal as well as a functional option
to dissolve the mechanism.
9. In any plan giving peace-officer status
to members of a Stanford police force
paid for by the University, the overall
performance of the force must be over
seen in some fashion, prescribed by law,
by a public official.
There is no contrary view about the
necessity for this partial "public" over
sight. Differences have to do with the
particulars of operational control.
10. There are therefore as a practical
matter two possible methods of obtaining
a sworn Stanford police force: (a> depu
tation by the Sheriff and <b; organiza
tion as an independent force under new
State legislation.
Deputization has the virtue of requir
ing no new legislation, but in the context
of the foregoing analysis it poses difficult
problems of finance and control, particu
larly with respect to accommodating the
internal Universtiy procedures for the
governing of conduct on campus.
An independent police department
would require special legislation, building
into the structure the elements of legal
oversight by some elected government of
ficial at state, county, or municipal level
and operational control by the Univer
sity. The over-arching law-enforcement
system of the county-state laws; county
prosecutor, magistrate, and grand jury;
and peace-officer oath would act to in
sure uniform standards of police
behavior.
11. Whatever the configuration of form
and responsibility for police services on
campus, it is o first importance that there
be established a new institutional instru
ment to assure the ideal of a responsive
force.
Such a body would advise the Presi
dent and the Director of Police on issues
of general policy and procedure. The
question of the representativeness of the
members of such a body (whose make-up
might be nearly that of the Commission
itself) would require careful attention,
particularly with respect to those consti
tuencies such as the blue-collar, clerical,
and other staff without formal represen
tative bodies like the Faculty and Student
Senates. While it would have no power to
hold formal hearings or to issue orders,
such a body could look into charges and
make recommendations, advising the Pre
sident whether there is probable cause to
institute disciplinary procedures, whether
an incident revealed the need for a change
in general policy, or whether the charges
appeared to be unfounded. If the body
worked well, it would be instrumental in
sustaining a police force that was more
responsive to the multifarious groups
making up the Stanford community than
is true in practice of any municipal police
department.
