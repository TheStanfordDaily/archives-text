# Weekend Campus Cruising
## 
### JERRY COLEMAN 
Come Friday and Saturday
night, what sight is becoming
increasingly common among
campus residences? The answer:
an ever-growing number of
student transients, whom for
journalistic simplicity shall be
called "Campus Cruisers."
Such campus cruisers usually
form in groups of three to six
males and can be observed
roaming aimlessly from dorm to
dorm, looking for, in one cruiser's
words, "some action." Inevitably,
the action sought after is never
found, prompting these males to
move on to new hunting grounds
at periodic intervals.
A small cruise can cover a
limited number of dorms, usually
in the same complex (e.g.:
Junipero--Arroyo—Cedro).
Stern—Wilbur—Branner is a
common loop, with Toyon as an

alternate. Lagunita—Roble, and
Flo Mo—Lakeshore Frats are also
well frequented routes.
Easy to Spot
Cruisers are often observed
grasping cans of beer; their
nervous laughter and their habit
of wandering without destination
or goal in mind make such groups
easy to spot.
Places these students will not
be found if they are known to be
on the prowl include their own
residences, the library, SLAC, and
at any movies being shown that
night.
Since this practice appears to
be growing in interest, three new
techniques of "creative cruising"
have been offered as a way for
each potential cruier to carve out
his own niche in the field.
Creative Cruising Method No.
1: "The Sneaky Cruise." Take one
garbage can and cut out holes in

the bottom for your feet. Climb
in and put on the cover, allowing
only a tiny crack for vision. Then
begin your cruise.
Try These Variations
Inane variations—try following
someone, always freezing when he
turns around; close the cover and
shout "hello" when someone
walks by: reach your hand out of
the can and shake hands with
passers-by.
Creative Cruising Method No.
2: "The Scary Cruise." Put on a
frightening rubber mask and
cruise women's dorms. Window
ledges and skylights are especially
effective and useful for this
method.
Creative Cruising Method No.
3: "The Zonked Cruise." Either
drink yourself silly, or pretend
that you have. Then crawl
through various dorms until the
world around you stops spinning.
