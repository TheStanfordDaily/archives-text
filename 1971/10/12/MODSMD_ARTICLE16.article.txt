# Hutcherson – Land: Extraordinaire
## 
### MARC BARMAN 
SAN FRANCISCO BLUE BOOK
(BST-- 84362) A NEW SHADE
OF BLUE (Mainstream MLR--314)
Bobby Hutcherson-Harold Land
Quintet
These two albums came out at
about the same time last spring.
San Francisco is under Bobby's
name on Blue Note Records, and
A New Shade of Blue is recorded
under Harold's name on the
Mainstream label.
Jazz is probably the most
unusual piece on the album. Not
at all what you'd expect from the
title, it floats to you like clouds in
the spring; rolls in like the surf at,
sunrise. Land plays oboe on this
one, and until you've heard it,

you don't know what love sounds
like.
Procession is one of those
songs you can't keep from
dancing to. One of Bobby's tunes,
it illustrates what a genius can do
with chords and modulations.
This one runs through all
harmonic boundaries in its course,
and the Quintet really digs in on
it. Land dissects the harmonic
maze at breakneck speed in an
especially meaty solo.
Ummh is one of those songs
about the better things in life. It's
really called Ummmmmmm
mmmh, which is what you say
when you've got it all together
and the whole world lays like it's
supposed to lay. Ummmmm
mmmmmh for 10 year olds is a

banana split with 24 gallons of ice
cream.
On A New Shade of Blue, the
title song of the other album,
Land grabs his tenor and takes
everyone for a long, fine ride. A
blues, this one, but with some
wrinkles you haven't heard
before. Soft. Extended. This
group can do more things to a
blues For example, the
second number they played at
Frost was a blues, medium tempo
and not as far out harmonically as
the one on the record.
But the melody was beyond
belief, full of twists and turns, so

as you began to sing along
(because you thought you knew
which way the song was going to
go) WHAM! The melody did a
triple reverse on the back side of
your mind and went somewhere
else! A brand new composition by
Bobby.
A lot of tenor saxophonists
these days spend all their time
trying to imitate John Coltrane,
which is like trying to build
Heaven and Earth in five days,
and resting on the sixth.
But Land is a monster! Land is
his own man. Unique. An
innovator. He knows where 'Trane

was at. Just listen. He knows
about Newk and Bird and Archis
and Pharoah. But his thing, man,
is subtle. Land sneaks up on you.
Then he tears your guts out,-all of
them. And your throat. But
subtle.
Hutcherson, they say, is the
best vibraphone player around. (A
vibraphone, by the way, is a
xylophone with a fancy electric
tremolo gadget hanging on it that
gives it a ringing, chimelike,
God-like sound.) Sitting in Frost
Sunday, you knew it was true.
Watching Bobby Hutcherson
play vibes and watching
Jean-Claude Killy ski straight
downhill at 70 miles an hour have
one thing in common—7 0 miles an
hour. You always spend the first
10 minutes of a Bobby
Hutcherson concert convincing
yourself that it really is possible
for his hands to move that fast.
Their last number was Herbie
Hancock's composition Maiden
Voyage, one of the most
expansive and beautiful songs in
music. It's based on only 4
chords, but they have a relation to
each other unmatched in any
other piece of music. To hear the
combination of vibes, tenor, and
electric piano on those chords
over the crackling rhythm 9et up
by the drums and Reggie
Johnson's bass.... well, if it
could be described there would
only be writers instead of
musicians.
There still are things in this
world well worth the search it
takes to find them. Music by the
Bobby Hutcherson—Harold Land
Quintet, recorded or live, is one of
those things, and it's closer to you
than you think.
