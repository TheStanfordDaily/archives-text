# 'King Lear' Is A Bit Heavy
## 
### DOUG ARTHUR 
One doesn't have to be the pattern of all patience to endure the
Russian version of "King Lear" which was screened at the San
Francisco Film Festival on Sunday night, but I felt weary upon
leaving the Palace of Fine Arts.
The program notes on the adaptation (based on Boris Pasternak's
translation) describe it as "sweepingly vast." Vast maybe, but
sweeping it ain't. It is certainly less daring and experimental than the
"Hamlet" by the same director, Grigori Kozintsev.
As might be expected, the text was severely cut although most
scenes remained intact. Flute music accompanies a view of the cold,
barren landscape at the onset. The Fool plays the flute throughout the
movie, which renders the travelling scenes somewhat more bearable
and adds to the epic effect. Hordes of earthen-garbed peasants march
toward a huge, grey castle which appears hewn from the rocky
hillside. I was impressed by the immensity of the settings, the
enormous space that the director utilized. The film does capture the
vastness of the drama: the effect of chaos on the entire society in the
crowd, battle, and even storm scenes.
All through the film we glimpse the travels of characters: royal
retinues, peasants, animals, madmen. Indeed, I wonder if some of the
footage of horses, dogs, and peasants moving from place to place
might have been cut. Wandering became a metaphor for the film (no
sarcasm intended): wandering through space, values, and sanity.
Kozintsev accentuated the language by magnificent settings. His
forte consisted of setting a scene visually, then adding words. This was
especially true in the heath scene when a ferocious storm called
attention to Lear's words. I enjoyed several touches: Regan and the
Duke listen through the door when Lear first arrives, later they
literally shut the door in his face; a stampede of wild horses signals the
coming of the storm, and a pan of the sky turns increasingly bleaker
and more menacing; a mass of "poor, naked wretches" are in the
hovel; Edmund has sunk in the mud when he shouts to save Lear and
Cordelia. His shouts are too late, and we hear a long agonizing scream.
The camera finds Lear atop a great battlement, the body of Cordelia
hanging in the background and set against the sea. Lear's cries echo
again and again from the hillsides; it is cosmic anguish. When the
bodies are carried off, first Lear and Cordelia together, then Regan,
then Goneril, the troops kick the fool, who is again playing his flute,
out of the way.
It was a somewhat younger, though bitter Fool. His part was less
diminished than the others, and in relation to them, he seemed to be a
complement to Lear. The fool sang many of his lines, but oddly did
not amuse the court very much. His motley was discarded for dark

clothing, and he came off more as a philosophical fool.
The most striking daughter was Golina Volcheck's Regan. Besides
being a viper like her elder sister (Elsa Radzin), she could also appear
quite compassionate towards her father. The actress was almost
motherly in calming Lear on his first journey to her castle. She did
have quite a weight problem however, which tended to make the
passionate scene with Edmund ludicrous. The actors playing Edmund
and Edgar resembled each other, this was a little disconcerting at first.
The actor playing Edgar created a convincingly mad appearance as
Poor Tom. The entire scene with Poor Tom, Lear, and the fool in the
hovel with the other wretches was played with a fine ensemble effect.
The Lear of Juri Jarvet was generally low-keyed emotionally,
especially when Gloucester recognizes him on the field. One
exception: the old king appears mad when he divides the kingdom and
tears the map in his rage. Jarvet appeared as a brooding, thoughtful,
quiet man except when he is first seen with his hundred knights in a
jovial state. It is easy to see, given this scene, why he becomes enraged
at his daughters' attempts to reduce the number of his retinue. The
director did achieve an epic effect visually, but at the cost of a stolid
heaviness in the adaptation.

crowd, battle, and even storm scenes.
All through the film we glimpse the travels of characters: royal
retinues, peasants, animals, madmen. Indeed, I wonder if some of the
footage of horses, dogs, and peasants moving from place to place
might have been cut. Wandering became a metaphor for the film (no
sarcasm intended): wandering through space, values, and sanity.
Kozintsev accentuated the language by magnificent settings. His
forte consisted of setting a scene visually, then adding words. This was
especially true in the heath scene when a ferocious storm called
attention to Lear's words. I enjoyed several touches: Regan and the
Duke listen through the door when Lear first arrives, later they
literally shut the door in his face; a stampede of wild horses signals the
coming of the storm, and a pan of the sky turns increasingly bleaker
and more menacing; a mass of "poor, naked wretches" are in the
hovel; Edmund has sunk in the mud when he shouts to save Lear and
Cordelia. His shouts are too late, and we hear a long agonizing scream.
The camera finds Lear atop a great battlement, the body of Cordelia
hanging in the background and set against the sea. Lear's cries echo
again and again from the hillsides; it is cosmic anguish. When the
bodies are carried off, first Lear and Cordelia together, then Regan,
then Goneril, the troops kick the fool, who is again playing his flute,
out of the way.
It was a somewhat younger, though bitter Fool. His part was less
diminished than the others, and in relation to them, he seemed to be a
complement to Lear. The fool sang many of his lines, but oddly did
not amuse the court very much. His motley was discarded for dark

clothing, and he came off more as a philosophical fool.
The most striking daughter was Golina Volcheck's Regan. Besides
being a viper like her elder sister (Elsa Radzin), she could also appear
quite compassionate towards her father. The actress was almost
motherly in calming Lear on his first journey to her castle. She did
have quite a weight problem however, which tended to make the
passionate scene with Edmund ludicrous. The actors playing Edmund
and Edgar resembled each other, this was a little disconcerting at first.
The actor playing Edgar created a convincingly mad appearance as
Poor Tom. The entire scene with Poor Tom, Lear, and the fool in the
hovel with the other wretches was played with a fine ensemble effect.
The Lear of Juri Jarvet was generally low-keyed emotionally,
especially when Gloucester recognizes him on the field. One
exception: the old king appears mad when he divides the kingdom and
tears the map in his rage. Jarvet appeared as a brooding, thoughtful,
quiet man except when he is first seen with his hundred knights in a
jovial state. It is easy to see, given this scene, why he becomes enraged
at his daughters' attempts to reduce the number of his retinue. The
director did achieve an epic effect visually, but at the cost of a stolid
heaviness in the adaptation.
One doesn't have to be the pattern of all patience to endure the
Russian version of "King Lear" which was screened at the San
Francisco Film Festival on Sunday night, but I felt weary upon
leaving the Palace of Fine Arts.
The program notes on the adaptation (based on Boris Pasternak's
translation) describe it as "sweepingly vast." Vast maybe, but
sweeping it ain't. It is certainly less daring and experimental than the
"Hamlet" by the same director, Grigori Kozintsev.
As might be expected, the text was severely cut although most
scenes remained intact. Flute music accompanies a view of the cold,
barren landscape at the onset. The Fool plays the flute throughout the
movie, which renders the travelling scenes somewhat more bearable
and adds to the epic effect. Hordes of earthen-garbed peasants march
toward a huge, grey castle which appears hewn from the rocky
hillside. I was impressed by the immensity of the settings, the
enormous space that the director utilized. The film does capture the
vastness of the drama: the effect of chaos on the entire society in the
crowd, battle, and even storm scenes.
