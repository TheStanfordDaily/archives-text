### LAURIE SMITH 
"Unless they (European countries)
unite, they will probably become
satellites of the two super-powers. . .
the Soviet Union and the United
States," said British Liberal elder
statesman, Lord Gladwyn, in a speech
at Bishop Auditorium yesterday.
His Lordship, who is an expert on
the Common Market and was the first
acting Secretary General of the United
Nations, commented on "Britain and
the European Communities." He
emphasized Britain's probable entry
into the Common Market and the need
for political as well as economic unity
in Europe.
He noted that the united Europe he
proposed would not be modeled after
the United States and would preserve
the identities of the separate countries.
A council of delegates from the
countries would establish a common
defense system which would permit the
U.S. withdrawal of troops from the
area and prevent Soviet "Finlandization
of Europe."
"There would be no need for the
U.S. to fear the third power of a united
Europe," he said.
