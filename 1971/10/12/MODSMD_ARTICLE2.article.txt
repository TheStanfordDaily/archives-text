# 'Daily' Turns Down 'Dear Ronnie' Column
## 
### 
A weekly question and answer
column entitled "Dear Ronnie" written
by California's Governor Ronald
Reagan is being offered for publication
to collegiate newspapers throughout
the state starting this week.
According to reports by a Reagan
press aide and the United Press
International, 14 California papers will
carry the series on a regular basis. But
according to the Daily, only 13 will.
"The Daily is not ruling out ever
running the Governor's column," said
Kditor Fred Mann, "but we feel
committing ourselves as regular caitiers
of the series is a terrible idea."
The column, put together and
distributed by the Claremont Collegian,
has been published once thus far (by
the Collegian), and included questions
about the Attica prison riot, Reagan's
thoughts on abortion laws, and his
interest in seeking the Presidency in
1972.
"None of his answers are anything
new or noteworthy," said Mann. "They
are just the type of thing we expected
him to say, and that's why we don't
plan to use the column.
"Reagan's ideas get more exposure in
the media than those of practically
anybody in the country, and we see no
great need to push his public relations
work for him by publishing a weekly

release full of the same old predictable
answers to the same old predictable
questions."
Both UPI and Rudi Garcia, a Reagan
aide, included The Daily in a list of
subscribers to the column released over
the weekend to papers across the
country. According to Chip Goodman,
publisher of the Collegian and
originator of the column idea, The
Daily is thus far the only paper to turn
down "Dear Ronnie."
"If Dear Ronnie happens to ever say
something new and different, or
unusually absurd, we would certainly
run it," continued Mann. "But the odds
of that happening seem slim. We feel it
is more important to reserve space in
our paper for the opinions of those in
the Stanford community than for those
of the Governor."
Mann felt that while it was desirable
for The )aily to include opinion
columns and letters from a conservative
perspective, that could best be done
through solicitation of articles from
campus figures, rather than outside
sources.
"Since Stanford is not a state
university," added Mann, "Reagan's
opinions have less direct bearing on us
than they might have. We will regard
the Governor as we would any other
non-local columnist, and nothing
more."

PEOPLE'S OFFENSE—Supporters of suspended professor H. Bruce Franklin
marched from a noon rally in White Plaza to Physics 101 yesterday and staged a
4 5-minute show of solidarity with Franklin, leaving voluntarily afterwards.
A weekly question and answer
column entitled "Dear Ronnie" written
by California's Governor Ronald
Reagan is being offered for publication
to collegiate newspapers throughout
the state starting this week.
According to reports by a Reagan
press aide and the United Press
International, 14 California papers will
carry the series on a regular basis. But
according to the Daily, only 13 will.
"The Daily is not ruling out ever
running the Governor's column," said
Kditor Fred Mann, "but we feel
committing ourselves as regular caitiers
of the series is a terrible idea."
The column, put together and
distributed by the Claremont Collegian,
has been published once thus far (by
the Collegian), and included questions
about the Attica prison riot, Reagan's
thoughts on abortion laws, and his
interest in seeking the Presidency in
1972.
"None of his answers are anything
new or noteworthy," said Mann. "They
are just the type of thing we expected
him to say, and that's why we don't
plan to use the column.
"Reagan's ideas get more exposure in
the media than those of practically
anybody in the country, and we see no
great need to push his public relations
work for him by publishing a weekly

release full of the same old predictable
answers to the same old predictable
questions."
Both UPI and Rudi Garcia, a Reagan
aide, included The Daily in a list of
subscribers to the column released over
the weekend to papers across the
country. According to Chip Goodman,
publisher of the Collegian and
originator of the column idea, The
Daily is thus far the only paper to turn
down "Dear Ronnie."
"If Dear Ronnie happens to ever say
something new and different, or
unusually absurd, we would certainly
run it," continued Mann. "But the odds
of that happening seem slim. We feel it
is more important to reserve space in
our paper for the opinions of those in
the Stanford community than for those
of the Governor."
Mann felt that while it was desirable
for The )aily to include opinion
columns and letters from a conservative
perspective, that could best be done
through solicitation of articles from
campus figures, rather than outside
sources.
"Since Stanford is not a state
university," added Mann, "Reagan's
opinions have less direct bearing on us
than they might have. We will regard
the Governor as we would any other
non-local columnist, and nothing
more."
