Brush Fire Slows
SANTA BARBARA — Fire fighters gained ground
yesterday against a large, five-day-old brush fire burning in
the hills near here, raising hopes it can be contained in
another day.
The south end of the fire's east flank reached a fire break
and began cooling down, leaving only a V/i mile front out
of control.
But this front was advancing through heavy brush in
nearly inaccessible canyon and the 2,100 fire fighters were
counting heavily on favorable winds and the fire break they
have cut across Rincon Ridge.
Turkey Bombs Agnew
ANKARA — Bombs hurled at two American targets
marked the beginning yesterday of Vice President Spiro T.
Agnew's 13-day mission to Turkey, Iran and Greece. The
bombs exploded in Istanbul, 220 miles northwest of here, a
few hours before Agnew's plane landed.
U.S. officials in Istanbul said an attempt was made to
throw a bomb over the fence of the U.S. Consulate General
grounds, but the device fell short and exploded, causing no
damage. The second bomb blew up the car of Kenton
Keith, a U.S. cultural attache. The car was parked in front
of his home.

Assembly debate next week on whether to offer the Red
regime membership and expel the Nationalists, listed 60
members that recognize Peking and 56 that recognize the
Taiwan government.
