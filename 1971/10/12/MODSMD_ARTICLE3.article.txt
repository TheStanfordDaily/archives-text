# 600 Unsold Books
## Debts Force 'Quad' To Close 
### PATTY FELS 
Dead is the only word for the
Stanford yearbook. After 78 years of
continuous publication, the Quad may
be finished.
With debts of $8,500 to a publishing
company and $2,900 to the ASSU,
prospects for a 1972 Quad appear dim.
Ed Riddell, would-be editor of the next
publication, has already ruled out a
book similar to the hardcover editions
of past years.
Instead, the staff is considering
publishing a senior book and a sports
magazine.
Out of the 2,500 annuals printed last
year, only 1,900 were sold. Riddell
said, "There just isn't enough interest
in college yearbooks anymore. Out of
6,500 undergraduates, only 1,200 truly
care about the book. There doesn't
seem to be any future in a Quad."
The Quad's financial problems began
in 1970 when a large number of books
were not sold. That yearbook lost
$2,900 which was covered by ASSU.
Six hundred unsold 1971 Quad's
resulted in a massive $8,500 debt to
Taylor Publishing Company, still
unpaid.
Legal Dispute
A legal dispute with Wheelwright
Publishing Company began after the
staff maintained that the 1970 books
were delivered with "scuff marks on
the cover" and refused to pay the
$2,700 fee. Negotiations dragged on
until summer, 1971, when Wheelwright
threatened to sue. ASSU Financial
manager Tom Huseby settled the cas"
out of court for $1,200.
According to Riddell, the yearbook's
greatest problem stems from the
uncertain student market. Yearbooks
must be ordered near the start of the

year and"it is impossible to outguess
Stanford students." Lack of interest
caused fewer than half the seniors, the
book's biggest market, to have their
portraits made last year. Riddell also
complained about a lack of working

staff for the yearbook. Only seven
students produced the book last year
and few experienced members
remain.
The proposed senior book
would be similar to the froshbooks

which have traditionally made money
and will continue to be published. The
senior book would include senior
portraits and student action shots. The
Quad would profit from portrait sitting
charges and the photographer's rebate
on additional pictures ordered.
Before the senior book is published,
however, financing and some type of
guarantee are needed. The froshbooks
are purchased by the Dean's office and
sold to all freshmen. 1970's froshbooks
will go toward repaying the debt.
Sports Magazine Proposed
Modelled after Sports Illustrated, the
proposed sports magazine would be
sold on a subscription basis after the
first issue. The staff is seeking support
from the athletic department to help
finance the initial issue, which would
supplement the publicity that the
department sends out. The magazine
would be primarily for alumni.
The Quad's problems are shared by
college yearbooks all over the country
which are modifying their format or
closing altogether. The size of
universities makes it impossible to
include pictures of all students. Few
clubs want to pay the required $50 fee
to be pictured in the yearbook.
A continuous publication since
1895, the Quad's price has risen only
two dollars in the last 20 years. From
1949 to 1967 sales remained constant
at about 3,200 in spite of the increase
in the student body from 8,365 to
11,432. The first color pictures
appeared in 1945 and the longest book
was 1968'5, with 544 pages.
A Publications Board meeting on
Thursday will decide how the Quad will
pay its debts and what will be
published this year.

college yearbooks all over the country
which are modifying their format or
closing altogether. The size of
universities makes it impossible to
include pictures of all students. Few
clubs want to pay the required $50 fee
to be pictured in the yearbook.
A continuous publication since
1895, the Quad's price has risen only
two dollars in the last 20 years. From
1949 to 1967 sales remained constant
at about 3,200 in spite of the increase
in the student body from 8,365 to
11,432. The first color pictures
appeared in 1945 and the longest book
was 1968'5, with 544 pages.
A Publications Board meeting on
Thursday will decide how the Quad will
pay its debts and what will be
published this year.

'QUAD' DlES—Stanford's traditional yearbook which boasts a 7 8-year history of
publication will not print this year due to the accumulation of $12,000 in debts
and 600 unsold books from last year.
Dead is the only word for the
Stanford yearbook. After 78 years of
continuous publication, the Quad may
be finished.
With debts of $8,500 to a publishing
company and $2,900 to the ASSU,
prospects for a 1972 Quad appear dim.
Ed Riddell, would-be editor of the next
publication, has already ruled out a
book similar to the hardcover editions
of past years.
Instead, the staff is considering
publishing a senior book and a sports
magazine.
Out of the 2,500 annuals printed last
year, only 1,900 were sold. Riddell
said, "There just isn't enough interest
in college yearbooks anymore. Out of
6,500 undergraduates, only 1,200 truly
care about the book. There doesn't
seem to be any future in a Quad."
The Quad's financial problems began
in 1970 when a large number of books
were not sold. That yearbook lost
$2,900 which was covered by ASSU.
Six hundred unsold 1971 Quad's
resulted in a massive $8,500 debt to
Taylor Publishing Company, still
unpaid.
Legal Dispute
A legal dispute with Wheelwright
Publishing Company began after the
staff maintained that the 1970 books
were delivered with "scuff marks on
the cover" and refused to pay the
$2,700 fee. Negotiations dragged on
until summer, 1971, when Wheelwright
threatened to sue. ASSU Financial
manager Tom Huseby settled the cas"
out of court for $1,200.
According to Riddell, the yearbook's
greatest problem stems from the
uncertain student market. Yearbooks
must be ordered near the start of the

year and"it is impossible to outguess
Stanford students." Lack of interest
caused fewer than half the seniors, the
book's biggest market, to have their
portraits made last year. Riddell also
complained about a lack of working

staff for the yearbook. Only seven
students produced the book last year
and few experienced members
remain.
The proposed senior book
would be similar to the froshbooks

which have traditionally made money
and will continue to be published. The
senior book would include senior
portraits and student action shots. The
Quad would profit from portrait sitting
charges and the photographer's rebate
on additional pictures ordered.
Before the senior book is published,
however, financing and some type of
guarantee are needed. The froshbooks
are purchased by the Dean's office and
sold to all freshmen. 1970's froshbooks
will go toward repaying the debt.
Sports Magazine Proposed
Modelled after Sports Illustrated, the
proposed sports magazine would be
sold on a subscription basis after the
first issue. The staff is seeking support
from the athletic department to help
finance the initial issue, which would
supplement the publicity that the
department sends out. The magazine
would be primarily for alumni.
The Quad's problems are shared by
