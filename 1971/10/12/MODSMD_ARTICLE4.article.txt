# Franklin Requests Case Dropped
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
Prof. H. Bruce Franklin moved for dismissal of
charges against him yesterday after the Advisory
Board waited through a 45-minute show of support
for the suspended English Professor.
Chairman Donald Kennedy said the Board
members "continued to be patient" in a nearby
classroom while demonstrators coming from a White
Plaza rally posted red flags and banners and
conducted their own mock hearing.
After the enthusiastic demonstrators left
voluntarily, the Board returned and Franklin made
the request for dismissal. A decision on the motion is
expected todav, after an administration response.
In a spirited two and a half hour speech, the Maoist
also asked the Board to recommend that President
Richard Lyman end Franklin's suspension from
teaching during the remainder of the hearing.
By the 1 p.m. starting time, the hearing room,
which normally seats 120, was filled by over 200
spectators. The pro-Franklin contingent of about 70
persons had marched to the hearing from a small
White Plaza rally.
Kennedy failed in his first requests that those
carrying flags or sitting in aisles leave the room.
Franklin protested, "We asked for a bigger room in
the first place. They made the decision arbitrarily to
have a tiny room, so that's their problem.'
The board then waited while the demonstrators
satirized the hearing. Franklin participated in the
joking only several times.
Before the demonstrators voluntarily filed out,
Venceremos member Juan Flores warned We can do
this whenever we want, whenever we feet the hearing
is going in a way that is not in accordance with
justice."

When the board returned, Franklin asked for
dismissal "of each and every charge" against him. He
said the administration's lawyers had failed to offer
enough "prima facie" evidence to continue the case.
Franklin later added that the motion is "not
frivolous" and said "the only thing standing in the
way now is the board being embarrassed about
slapping the administration in the face. I think that's
(the administration's) problem."
He also asked the Board to investigate the
administration and to demand an apology for
charging him in the first place.
University lawyer Raymond Fisher will answer
Franklin's arguments for several hours today, then
the Board will recess to consider the dismissal
motion. The hearing was recessed after Franklin's
long statement yesterday to give Fisher time to
prepare his rebuttal.
In his second motion to the Board, Franklin asked
the seven professors to recommend that Lyman allow
Franklin to resume teaching duties until the hearing is
over. He pointed out that tenure policy allows
suspending a professor during a dismissal hearing
"only if immediate harm to himself or others is
threatened by his continuance in his regular duties."
Franklin denied he poses such a threat and
explained that he is already barred from participation
in campus disruptions by an injunction obtained by
the University last February.
Kennedy said the Board will consider the request
but added that its powers only cover the dismissal
hearing itself.
In his argument for dropping the case. Franklin
charged that the tenure policy under which he is
charged is dangerously "vague." He said continuing
his case would have a "chilling effect" on free speech

at Stanford.
Franklin denounced the administration's case on
each of the four charges against him. He said Fisher's
witnesses had at most shown Franklin "heckling'
former Ambassador Cabot Lodge, Jan. 11. Franklin
said "heckling" has been judged "free speech" in a
case before the California Supreme Court.
The suspended professor is also charged with
violating a police order to disperse outside a
Computation Center demonstration, Feb. 10.
Franklin insisted the order was illegal and that he
argued with police officials in an attempt to prevent a
confrontation.
He also charged there was "no basis of causality"
established to link two speeches he gave to campus
disruptions Feb. 10. He insisted he was advocating a
strike at the Computation Center, rather than the
occupation that occurred. And he said he had
advocated dorm organizing at the rally that night
rather than violence.
Franklin at one point said that he had always tried
to "stay within the rules" on campus because he and
fellow revolutionaries had made a "collective
decision" that he should hold on to his Stanford job
"for political reasons."
He charged the "phoney charges" were
"characteristic of a class in its time of collapse."
Kennedy said Franklin had "made complex
arguments worthy of consideration" and ruled that
the Board will discuss the motion for as long as it
requires after Fisher's statement.
Fisher will begin the review of his case when the
hearing resumes, today at 1 p.m. in Physics 101. He
said he will show that Franklin "misstated first
amendment rights of free speech" and distorted
testimony of administration witnesses.

members "continued to be patient" in a nearby
classroom while demonstrators coming from a White
Plaza rally posted red flags and banners and
conducted their own mock hearing.
After the enthusiastic demonstrators left
voluntarily, the Board returned and Franklin made
the request for dismissal. A decision on the motion is
expected todav, after an administration response.
In a spirited two and a half hour speech, the Maoist
also asked the Board to recommend that President
Richard Lyman end Franklin's suspension from
teaching during the remainder of the hearing.
By the 1 p.m. starting time, the hearing room,
which normally seats 120, was filled by over 200
spectators. The pro-Franklin contingent of about 70
persons had marched to the hearing from a small
White Plaza rally.
Kennedy failed in his first requests that those
carrying flags or sitting in aisles leave the room.
Franklin protested, "We asked for a bigger room in
the first place. They made the decision arbitrarily to
have a tiny room, so that's their problem.'
The board then waited while the demonstrators
satirized the hearing. Franklin participated in the
joking only several times.
Before the demonstrators voluntarily filed out,
Venceremos member Juan Flores warned We can do
this whenever we want, whenever we feet the hearing
is going in a way that is not in accordance with
justice."

When the board returned, Franklin asked for
dismissal "of each and every charge" against him. He
said the administration's lawyers had failed to offer
enough "prima facie" evidence to continue the case.
Franklin later added that the motion is "not
frivolous" and said "the only thing standing in the
way now is the board being embarrassed about
slapping the administration in the face. I think that's
(the administration's) problem."
He also asked the Board to investigate the
administration and to demand an apology for
charging him in the first place.
University lawyer Raymond Fisher will answer
Franklin's arguments for several hours today, then
the Board will recess to consider the dismissal
motion. The hearing was recessed after Franklin's
long statement yesterday to give Fisher time to
prepare his rebuttal.
In his second motion to the Board, Franklin asked
the seven professors to recommend that Lyman allow
Franklin to resume teaching duties until the hearing is
over. He pointed out that tenure policy allows
suspending a professor during a dismissal hearing
"only if immediate harm to himself or others is
threatened by his continuance in his regular duties."
Franklin denied he poses such a threat and
explained that he is already barred from participation
in campus disruptions by an injunction obtained by
the University last February.
Kennedy said the Board will consider the request
but added that its powers only cover the dismissal
hearing itself.
In his argument for dropping the case. Franklin
charged that the tenure policy under which he is
charged is dangerously "vague." He said continuing
his case would have a "chilling effect" on free speech

at Stanford.
Franklin denounced the administration's case on
each of the four charges against him. He said Fisher's
witnesses had at most shown Franklin "heckling'
former Ambassador Cabot Lodge, Jan. 11. Franklin
said "heckling" has been judged "free speech" in a
case before the California Supreme Court.
The suspended professor is also charged with
violating a police order to disperse outside a
Computation Center demonstration, Feb. 10.
Franklin insisted the order was illegal and that he
argued with police officials in an attempt to prevent a
confrontation.
He also charged there was "no basis of causality"
established to link two speeches he gave to campus
disruptions Feb. 10. He insisted he was advocating a
strike at the Computation Center, rather than the
occupation that occurred. And he said he had
advocated dorm organizing at the rally that night
rather than violence.
Franklin at one point said that he had always tried
to "stay within the rules" on campus because he and
fellow revolutionaries had made a "collective
decision" that he should hold on to his Stanford job
"for political reasons."
He charged the "phoney charges" were
"characteristic of a class in its time of collapse."
Kennedy said Franklin had "made complex
arguments worthy of consideration" and ruled that
the Board will discuss the motion for as long as it
requires after Fisher's statement.
Fisher will begin the review of his case when the
hearing resumes, today at 1 p.m. in Physics 101. He
said he will show that Franklin "misstated first
amendment rights of free speech" and distorted
testimony of administration witnesses.
Prof. H. Bruce Franklin moved for dismissal of
charges against him yesterday after the Advisory
Board waited through a 45-minute show of support
for the suspended English Professor.
