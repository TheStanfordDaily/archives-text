## Critical Decisions 
### 
The Faculty Advisory Hoard will hear critical arguments from the
prosecution today as the Hruce Franklin hearing enters its twelfth and
possibly last day in session.
The defense has moved for dismissal of all charges and an end to
what they term a farcical hearing. And unless University-hired lawyer
Raymond Fisher can come up with an impressive and forceful
summary of the Administration's case this afternoon. Franklin s
motion may be granted.
It would require a bold decision by the seven judging professors to
throw out the prosecution's case even before l-ranklin has begun his
defense, but if the Hoard members reach such a verdict, they must
take that move without regard to the frustration or embarrassment it
would cause the Administration. The Board members must be
responsible primarily to themselves, not to the University officers who
employ them.
At the same time, the Board has been asked to use its status as the
most clearly informed neutral party in the complicated case to
recommend to the Administration the lifting of Franklin's suspension
from teaching duties for the remainder of the hearing. If Franklin's
motion for dismissal is granted, the quest ion of the Board supporting
Franklin's plea becomes moot. But if the hearing does continue, the
Board should and must grant Franklin's request for re-instatement.
Without judging the case or Franklin's "guilt, "it is apparent that
there is no valid reason to continue banning him from teaching while a
decision is being reached. He was originally suspended by I'resident
Lyman under a section of the tenure policy stating that a faculty
member can be suspended during his or her dismissal hearings "Only if
immediate harm to himself or others is threatened by his continuance
in his regular duties. "
Whatever the campus mood at the time of the suspension in
February, it is now clear that Franklin will threaten no harm by being
allowed hack into classrooms and offices. Although he obviously
could not begin instructing a class mid-way through the quarter, he
would he allowed free access to all parts of the campus at all times,
and would be able to begin to serve the academic needs of Stanford
by preparing for future classes he might teach.
As Franklin pointed out in making his request to the Board
yesterday, any potential disruptive behavior by him is already
well-controlled by a still-functioning injunction which bans him on
penalty of a felony conviction from any form of campus disruption,
sit-in, mill-in, trashing, or conspiring to do Siicli things.
Maintaining Franklin's suspension at this point serves no purpose
whatsoever, and the Advisory Board has the responsibility to
recommend alleviation of the suspension to the I'resident by virtue oj
its defined role as impartial judge.

prosecution today as the Hruce Franklin hearing enters its twelfth and
possibly last day in session.
The defense has moved for dismissal of all charges and an end to
what they term a farcical hearing. And unless University-hired lawyer
Raymond Fisher can come up with an impressive and forceful
summary of the Administration's case this afternoon. Franklin s
motion may be granted.
It would require a bold decision by the seven judging professors to
throw out the prosecution's case even before l-ranklin has begun his
defense, but if the Hoard members reach such a verdict, they must
take that move without regard to the frustration or embarrassment it
would cause the Administration. The Board members must be
responsible primarily to themselves, not to the University officers who
employ them.
At the same time, the Board has been asked to use its status as the
most clearly informed neutral party in the complicated case to
recommend to the Administration the lifting of Franklin's suspension
from teaching duties for the remainder of the hearing. If Franklin's
motion for dismissal is granted, the quest ion of the Board supporting
Franklin's plea becomes moot. But if the hearing does continue, the
Board should and must grant Franklin's request for re-instatement.
Without judging the case or Franklin's "guilt, "it is apparent that
there is no valid reason to continue banning him from teaching while a
decision is being reached. He was originally suspended by I'resident
Lyman under a section of the tenure policy stating that a faculty
member can be suspended during his or her dismissal hearings "Only if
immediate harm to himself or others is threatened by his continuance
in his regular duties. "
Whatever the campus mood at the time of the suspension in
February, it is now clear that Franklin will threaten no harm by being
allowed hack into classrooms and offices. Although he obviously
could not begin instructing a class mid-way through the quarter, he
would he allowed free access to all parts of the campus at all times,
and would be able to begin to serve the academic needs of Stanford
by preparing for future classes he might teach.
As Franklin pointed out in making his request to the Board
yesterday, any potential disruptive behavior by him is already
well-controlled by a still-functioning injunction which bans him on
penalty of a felony conviction from any form of campus disruption,
sit-in, mill-in, trashing, or conspiring to do Siicli things.
Maintaining Franklin's suspension at this point serves no purpose
whatsoever, and the Advisory Board has the responsibility to
recommend alleviation of the suspension to the I'resident by virtue oj
its defined role as impartial judge.
