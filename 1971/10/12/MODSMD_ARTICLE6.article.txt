Editor's Note: The following column
concludes the University's argument
objecting to admission of evidence bearing
on possible Nuremberg or Necessity
defenses by I*rofessor Bruce Franklin. It
was submitted by Raymond Fisher last
Friday and was written by Charles
Rosenberg.
The Necessity Defense
Professor Franklin may seek to avoid
the fact that Nuremberg itself created 110
defenses by bringing in the
Anglo-American common law tradition of
"necessity." This tradition forgives the
commission of a crime if it is done in
furtherance of some higher good, often
the prevention of another crime or the
prevention of death or injury. See
generally Packer, The Limits of the
Criminal Sanction, pp. 113-18 (1968).
Professor Franklin may argue that because
his offenses went to preventing complicity
in war crimes, those offenses should be
excused.
Such an interpretation of the doctrine
of necessity, however, distorts it beyond
recognition. Necessity is only permitted as
a defense to offenses committed to
prevent clear wrongs or harm, instantly

recognizable by everyone. To permit the
defense for offenses which do good only
in the eyes of some would destroy any
system of regulation since some people
could always be found to say that the
offense had created a greater good.
Clearly, war crimes which depend on
f?r-reaching notions of complicity are the
sort of shifting, imprecise wrongs to which
the doctrine of necessity is not applicable.
Thus, while necessity might excuse a man
in using force to prevent the murder of a
prisoner of war in his presence, it clearly
cannot be expanded to justify offenses
committed upon some ad hoc
determination that some activity arguable
constitutes a war crime.
Further, necessity is generally accepted
as a defense only where everyone can
agree that there were no alternative means
to prevent the harm or wrong. Here, there
are other corrective means, both within
and without the University, which many
would find adequate to the task of
correcting whatever "war crimes" are
alleged to be involved here.
For these reasons, no court in the land
would recognize the defense of necessity
as applied to the facts here, and there is no
reason for the Advisory Board to do so.
Problems in Determining War Crimes
Yet another reason why the Board

should reject Professor Franklin's effort to
construct a defense out of the principles
of Nuremberg is the evidentiary morass
that would be created. Any such
"defense" would require a factual
determination that the United States has
committed war crimes and that Stanford is
somehow directly connected with them.

A determination whether United States
activities in Vietnam constitute war crimes
under the definitions developed at
Nuremberg involves extremely difficult
evidentiary issues, particularly for a forum
with the limited resources of the Advisory
Board. As Telford Taylor, who was United
States Chief Counsel at Nuremberg, has
said:
"We may best begin by taking a brief
look at the merits of the aggression
issue, not in order to answer it. but for
an understanding of the range and
complexity of its components. An
answer would involve the interpretation
of numerous treaties and other
international documents, including the
United Nations Charter, the Geneva
Declaration of July 21, 1954, the
reports of the International Control
Commission established under the
Geneva agreement, and the Southeast
Asia Collective Defense Treaty

(SEATO). It would involve the
examination of hotly controverted
evidentiary questions, such as when the
infiltration of North Vietnamese
guerrillas into South Vietnam began,
and whether American destroyers were
in fact attacked, or reasonably believed
to have been attacked, by North
Vietnamese torpedo boats in the
Tonkin Gulf in the summer of 1964. It
would involve scrutiny of the
information available to, and the
intentions of, the President of the
United States and the military and
civilian officials who helped him to
shape and execute our policies and
operations in Vietnam." Nuremberg
and Vietnam: An American Tragedy
(1970), pp. 100-101.
In other words, to hear evidence on war.
crime*, the Advisory Board would have to
turn itself into a full-fledged war crimes
tribunal—a role it is clearly not equipped
to play.
Objection to War Crimes Evidence
For the reasons set out above, the
University objects to the introduction of
evidence relating to war crimes in Vietnam
or Stanford's alleged complicity in them,
and asks the Board to exclude such
evidence.
