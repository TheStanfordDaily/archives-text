tenure policy
Editor, THE DAILY:
The precedents of the past
quarter century offer little
assurance of tenure security to a
serious revolutionary advocate on
an American University faculty.
His ultimate appeal will be the
1940-58 Statement of the
American Association of
University Professors (AAUP),
which recommends that dismissal
be only for "cause." It is,
however, left to each University
to clarify for its campus what
shall constitute adequate cause. In
this somewhat ambiguous form
the Statement has become a
national standard against which
tenure procedures are measured.
I think there will be no dispute
that Association activities have

discouraged discipline of tenured
faculty on frivolous grounds, such
as personality conflicts; the gain
for our Universities has certainly
been large. Adoption of the
AAUP principles may also have
protected some faculty of dubious
competence. But the striking
intellectual successes on American
University campuses in recent
years suggest that in this respect
the social price paid was a small
one.
For those professors who chose
not to conform politically, the
AAUP recommendations seem
largely to have been ignored, or to
have been adapted to the
exigencies of the time. In an
unhappy period remembered too
well by many of us, dismissals
without charges or hearings were
frequent; charges when raised
covered the full range of easy
catchwords, and usually centered
on refusal to Inform on one's
colleagues to a Congressional
Committee—an action that,
justified or not, certainly had no
academic relevance. At that time,
the Universities were effectively
purged of basic dissent. And
although Stanford suffered less
than some other campuses, many
of us will recall the furious

reaction and the unceremonious
discipline accorded the single
faculty member who was
outspokenly radical in his views.
Against this background, and
particularly against the AAUP's
failure in the past decade to
strengthen its recommendations,
the tenure policy adopted by
Stanford University in 1967 was a
document calculated to revive a
cynic's faith. It can only have
been with intent that the timid
words of the Association were
replaced by the explicit
requirement of "a finding ... of
substantial and manifest
incompetence, substantial and
manifest neglect of duty or
personal conduct substantially
impairing the individual's
performance of his appropriate
functions within the University
community." The words would
seem to have been carefully
chosen to clarify the notion of
"cause" in a way to minimize
political or personal harassment of
competent scholars.
Unhappily, if one neglects the
historical context of the words,
they too can be interpreted
loosely. For example, one might
say that a professor who doesn't
mix socially with his colleagues is
impairing the performance of his
University functions. Or that this
is the case for a professor whose
openly expressed opinions are
hindering the flow of money to

the University. Or, to bring the
point still closer to home, can one
say that a professor who
repeatedly expresses approval of
revolutionary activity as a redress
for injustice is thereby
substantially impairing the
performance of his University
functions?
This is, essentially, the view
that Stanford's president has
asked his Advisory Board to
adopt, in a case in which there is
no finding of classroom or
scholarly neglect or malfeasance. I
cannot believe that this breadth of
interpretation was envisaged by
those who fonnulated the tenure
policy; if it is adopted as a
precedent, then little further
stretching will be needed to
impart to the words a permissive
quality, and the faculty will be
left with tenure rules whose chief
function will be to protect
mediocrity and subservience.
Let me paraphrase the matter.
Stanford's Advisory Board is
being asked to decide whether
professors here are employees
with the obligation to provide
services as required by their
supervisors (and not to talk back),
or whether they are scholars, who
are to be protected in their duty
to seek the truth as they find it
and to act accordingly. In the
American University tradition,
there are many words paying
homage to the latter view, and too

many actions that respect the
former.
The tenure system, as a
tentative beginning toward
putting substance in the words,
has yielded a limited but
significant success in freeing
scholars from some of the hazards
of capricious reprisal. The system
is now under attack from a
number of directions, from
without and from within. Some of
the attacks seek to divorce the
issue of scholarly independence
from that of political
independence. I do not believe
this can be done. If the attacks
succeed, our Universities will
cease to function as agencies for
independent thought and opinion.
The decision of the Advisory
Board in the present case will do
much to support or to refute the
revolutionary assertion that the
present system can provide no
better.

the University. Or, to bring the
point still closer to home, can one
say that a professor who
repeatedly expresses approval of
revolutionary activity as a redress
for injustice is thereby
substantially impairing the
performance of his University
functions?
This is, essentially, the view
that Stanford's president has
asked his Advisory Board to
adopt, in a case in which there is
no finding of classroom or
scholarly neglect or malfeasance. I
cannot believe that this breadth of
interpretation was envisaged by
those who fonnulated the tenure
policy; if it is adopted as a
precedent, then little further
stretching will be needed to
impart to the words a permissive
quality, and the faculty will be
left with tenure rules whose chief
function will be to protect
mediocrity and subservience.
Let me paraphrase the matter.
Stanford's Advisory Board is
being asked to decide whether
professors here are employees
with the obligation to provide
services as required by their
supervisors (and not to talk back),
or whether they are scholars, who
are to be protected in their duty
to seek the truth as they find it
and to act accordingly. In the
American University tradition,
there are many words paying
homage to the latter view, and too

many actions that respect the
former.
The tenure system, as a
tentative beginning toward
putting substance in the words,
has yielded a limited but
significant success in freeing
scholars from some of the hazards
of capricious reprisal. The system
is now under attack from a
number of directions, from
without and from within. Some of
the attacks seek to divorce the
issue of scholarly independence
from that of political
independence. I do not believe
this can be done. If the attacks
succeed, our Universities will
cease to function as agencies for
independent thought and opinion.
The decision of the Advisory
Board in the present case will do
much to support or to refute the
revolutionary assertion that the
present system can provide no
better.

Editor, THE DAILY:
The precedents of the past
quarter century offer little
assurance of tenure security to a
serious revolutionary advocate on
an American University faculty.
His ultimate appeal will be the
1940-58 Statement of the
American Association of
University Professors (AAUP),
which recommends that dismissal
be only for "cause." It is,
however, left to each University
to clarify for its campus what
shall constitute adequate cause. In
this somewhat ambiguous form
the Statement has become a
national standard against which
tenure procedures are measured.
I think there will be no dispute
that Association activities have

discouraged discipline of tenured
faculty on frivolous grounds, such
as personality conflicts; the gain
for our Universities has certainly
been large. Adoption of the
AAUP principles may also have
protected some faculty of dubious
competence. But the striking
intellectual successes on American
University campuses in recent
years suggest that in this respect
the social price paid was a small
one.
For those professors who chose
not to conform politically, the
AAUP recommendations seem
largely to have been ignored, or to
have been adapted to the
exigencies of the time. In an
unhappy period remembered too
well by many of us, dismissals
without charges or hearings were
frequent; charges when raised
covered the full range of easy
catchwords, and usually centered
on refusal to Inform on one's
colleagues to a Congressional
Committee—an action that,
justified or not, certainly had no
academic relevance. At that time,
the Universities were effectively
purged of basic dissent. And
although Stanford suffered less
than some other campuses, many
of us will recall the furious

reaction and the unceremonious
discipline accorded the single
faculty member who was
outspokenly radical in his views.
Against this background, and
particularly against the AAUP's
failure in the past decade to
strengthen its recommendations,
the tenure policy adopted by
Stanford University in 1967 was a
document calculated to revive a
cynic's faith. It can only have
been with intent that the timid
words of the Association were
replaced by the explicit
requirement of "a finding ... of
substantial and manifest
incompetence, substantial and
manifest neglect of duty or
personal conduct substantially
impairing the individual's
performance of his appropriate
functions within the University
community." The words would
seem to have been carefully
chosen to clarify the notion of
"cause" in a way to minimize
political or personal harassment of
competent scholars.
Unhappily, if one neglects the
historical context of the words,
they too can be interpreted
loosely. For example, one might
say that a professor who doesn't
mix socially with his colleagues is
impairing the performance of his
University functions. Or that this
is the case for a professor whose
openly expressed opinions are
hindering the flow of money to

the University. Or, to bring the

competence. But the striking
intellectual successes on American
University campuses in recent
years suggest that in this respect
the social price paid was a small
one.
For those professors who chose
not to conform politically, the
AAUP recommendations seem
largely to have been ignored, or to
have been adapted to the
exigencies of the time. In an
unhappy period remembered too
well by many of us, dismissals
without charges or hearings were
frequent; charges when raised
covered the full range of easy
catchwords, and usually centered
on refusal to Inform on one's
colleagues to a Congressional
Committee—an action that,
justified or not, certainly had no
academic relevance. At that time,
the Universities were effectively
purged of basic dissent. And
although Stanford suffered less
than some other campuses, many
of us will recall the furious

reaction and the unceremonious
discipline accorded the single
faculty member who was
outspokenly radical in his views.
Against this background, and
particularly against the AAUP's
failure in the past decade to
strengthen its recommendations,
the tenure policy adopted by
Stanford University in 1967 was a
document calculated to revive a
cynic's faith. It can only have
been with intent that the timid
words of the Association were
replaced by the explicit
requirement of "a finding ... of
substantial and manifest
incompetence, substantial and
manifest neglect of duty or
personal conduct substantially
impairing the individual's
performance of his appropriate
functions within the University
community." The words would
seem to have been carefully
chosen to clarify the notion of
"cause" in a way to minimize
political or personal harassment of
competent scholars.
Unhappily, if one neglects the
historical context of the words,
they too can be interpreted
loosely. For example, one might
say that a professor who doesn't
mix socially with his colleagues is
impairing the performance of his
University functions. Or that this
is the case for a professor whose
openly expressed opinions are
hindering the flow of money to

the University. Or, to bring the
point still closer to home, can one
say that a professor who
repeatedly expresses approval of
revolutionary activity as a redress
for injustice is thereby
substantially impairing the
performance of his University
functions?
This is, essentially, the view
that Stanford's president has
asked his Advisory Board to
adopt, in a case in which there is
no finding of classroom or
scholarly neglect or malfeasance. I
cannot believe that this breadth of
interpretation was envisaged by
those who fonnulated the tenure
policy; if it is adopted as a
precedent, then little further
stretching will be needed to
impart to the words a permissive
quality, and the faculty will be
left with tenure rules whose chief
function will be to protect
mediocrity and subservience.
Let me paraphrase the matter.
Stanford's Advisory Board is
being asked to decide whether
professors here are employees
with the obligation to provide
services as required by their
supervisors (and not to talk back),
or whether they are scholars, who
are to be protected in their duty
to seek the truth as they find it
and to act accordingly. In the
American University tradition,
there are many words paying
homage to the latter view, and too

many actions that respect the
former.
The tenure system, as a
tentative beginning toward
putting substance in the words,
has yielded a limited but
significant success in freeing
scholars from some of the hazards
of capricious reprisal. The system
is now under attack from a
number of directions, from
without and from within. Some of
the attacks seek to divorce the
issue of scholarly independence
from that of political
independence. I do not believe
this can be done. If the attacks
succeed, our Universities will
cease to function as agencies for
independent thought and opinion.
The decision of the Advisory
Board in the present case will do
much to support or to refute the
revolutionary assertion that the
present system can provide no
better.
