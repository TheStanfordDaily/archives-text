# Support For Police Proposal
## 
### 
1 would like to clear up the
many misconceptions raised by
last Thursday's Daily article, the
headline of which announced me
as "hitting" the report of the
Commission on the Status of the
Campus Police.
This headline, and the
reporting behind it, were quite
mistaken. As a member of the
Commission, and one who signed
its report, I would like to make
clear again that I endorse the
conclusions and recommendations
of this report.
It was said in the article that I
was dissatisfied with the report.

This is untrue. What I am
dissatisfied with is the reality that
we ran into as a commission. That
reality is this: a special police
district, through which residents
of the campus would have legal,
democratic control over the
operation of the police force, is
not feasible at Stanford. For one,
there is no way such a district
could be financed, as there is
hardly any residential tax base at
Stanford. Second, there is no way
it would be approved by the local
governing agencies.
In order for a Community
Services District to be organized,
the Local Agency Formation
Commission and the County
Board of Supervisors must be
satisfied that there is no other
more reasonable alternative for
obtaining the desired service, that
no special interest would be given
the status of a governmental
agency, and that the district is
economically feasible. Anyone
who understands the politics of
this county and the facts of this
situation can see that these bodies
would surely strike down the
proposed district on at least one
of these counts—and probably on
all three.
My first concern with the
organization of the campus police
is to insure as much community
control and supervision of its
actions as possible. I would have
favored the special police district
if it were economically and
politically feasible precisely for
this reason—it would have, by
definition, insured democratic
community control. The
Commission report states that the
district, had it been created,
would still have had serious
problems of control since "the
entire staff, a good portion of the
faculty, and a large number of
students" would be
disenfranchised, (because they live
off campus). This is the one
implication of the report I take
issue with because it ignores one
very overwhelming fact—right
now, EVERYBODY on this
campus is disenfranchised. No
portion of any of the
constituencies to be protected and
policed at Stanford has any legal
electoral control over the
operations of the Stanford force.
And this kind of control is,
lamentably, not possible. So we
work with what we have.
What do we have? We have
before us now a recommendation
for a Stanford police force with
full public police powers, a force
that the University
Administration will have
operational control over, but that

some elected official—probably
the County Sheriff—will have
ultimate legal responsibility for.
This last provision takes the
Stanford force out of the status of
a private police force by placing a
buffer of ultimate public control
between the private entity—the
University Administration—and
the public entity—its police force.
Tliis buffer of ultimate public
control is not much. It isn't
community control. But it is a
check on a very great fear of
mine: the emergence of a private
police force responsible,
practically, to no one but the

founc/mra

University Administration.
Whatever you think of Richard
Lyman, that kind of power (of
complete control over a public
police force) is one that no private
person should have in a
democratic society.
So we have a check, but what
about community control? I
would argue that this report offers
a mechanism for as much
community control as is possible.
Legally, that mechanism will have
no power, and this must be
understood. But, practically, it
can have much power.
The Advisory Board
recommended in the report, if it
functions as vigorously and
conscientiously as it could, will
offer a very large amount of
community input into the
operation and policies of the
Stanford Police. While its
power—both over general policy
and procedure and in incidents of
individual police conduct—will be
one of recommendation only, the
impact of its recommendations
could be quite powerful.
How much community control
is finally realized through this
Advisory Board will depend on
the quality of the people that
serve on it. The Student and
Faculty Senates will surely
approach these appointments with
special care. And, as the report
makes clear, a new method for
selection of staff members
(including, for the first time,
non-administrative staff) must be
found, a method that will take the
selection process out of the

President's Office. (This is not
intended as a slight on President
Lyman, but merely a recognition
of the fact that a truly
independent Board would be
better able to objectively evaluate
and recommend policy.) Serious
thought ought to be given to
staff-wide elections to choose
through their representatives.
It should be added that Sheriff
Geary, who will have ultimate
legal control over the Stanford
force under the most probable
plan (deputization of the Stanford
Police under the Santa Clara
County Sheriff), has already
expressed enthusiasm about the
idea of a community Advisory
Board. On more than one
occasion he has expressed a
willingness to listen carefully to
its suggestions and
recommendations.
Despite the Advisory Board
and the legal buffer between the
University Administration and its
police, many have still stated that
they are not willing to trust
President Lyman and his aides
with day-to-day control over a
sworn police force, and have
therefore argued against peace
officer status for the Stanford
police.
It must be recognized that we
are going to have sworn police
officers on this campus. They will
be either regular Santa Clara
County Sheriffs, as is now the
case on campus, or sworn
Stanford officers who must meet
the same high training standards.
Which of the two one prefers
depends on whether or not one
believes an indigenous force will
be more effective and sensitive in
policing a community. And it
depends also on who one trusts
more: President Lyman or the
whims of the Santa Clara County
electorate.
I choose Lyman. I think Sheriff
Geary is a fairly good man, but
I'm not prepared to trust that the
County won't elect some thinly
disguised fascist as the next
Sheriff (which it almost did in
1970). We have all had our
differences with President Lyman,
but I think the safest alternative is
to trust that he, and the new
Director of the Stanford Police,
Marvin Herrington, will be
responsive to community
sentiment, and to their Advisory
Board.
The members of this
Commission have spent many long
and difficult hours sorting out,
evaluating, and arguing (often
intensely) over alternatives. Each
conflict has been resolved on the

basis of what would be feasible,
and what would be least
objectionable to all the
constituencies and elements
involved.
The Commission has served
with great care and fairness. It has
offered to the Stanford
community a structure for its
police services that can be fair to
all. It is up now to the community
to seize upon that structure and
place in it people of quality,
people worthy of our trust.
