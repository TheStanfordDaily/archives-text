# 'Here's The World Famous Cartoonist...'
## 
### TERRIE McDONALD 
You're a good man, Charles Schultz, and however much you insist, "I just draw
cartoons," there is a reason that it was Snoopy who went to the moon and not
one of the girls from "Apartment 3-G."
Demonstrating his talents before a communications class and a few of the
Peanuts faithful yesterday afternoon, Schultz chalked a familiar beagle, and bird
companion, on the blackboard "to show I'm not some Hollywood model." Such
is the mystique surrounding the creator of Charlie Brown, Lucy, Linus, Snoopy
and the other inhabitants of his nationally syndicated comic strip.
Schultz fielded questions on the philosophical, educational and commercial
impact of his 'make-believe' characters while maintaining, "I can just draw pretty
well, write pretty well, think of things, turn phrases . . . I'm not trying to save the
world or influence people."
Chairman Snoopy?
Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber, a visiting French journalist, told Schultz that
when recently enrolling his children in a local elementary school, !-e saw Snoopy
or Charlie Brown in every room, as one would see Chairman Mao in Red China.
This, he said, obviously poses a .oral or political quandry.
When the audience quieted after succumbing to the imagery of the analogy,
Servan-Schreiber asked Schultz if he sometimes had a feeling of overwhelming
responsibility towards this country. The cartoonist admitted, "I try not to think
about things like that."
Schultz spoke of searching for new ways of finding "ideas that really get down
to where people are living." He didn't have to do much more than cite Charlie
Brown's obsession with the little red-haired girl or Peppermint Patty's puzzled
affection for "Chuck"to remind the students of his mastery in touching their
lives.
