# 'Here's The World Famous Cartoonist...'
## 
### TERRIE McDONALD 
You're a good man, Charles Schultz, and however much you insist, "I just draw
cartoons," there is a reason that it was Snoopy who went to the moon and not
one of the girls from "Apartment 3-G."
Demonstrating his talents before a communications class and a few of the
Peanuts faithful yesterday afternoon, Schultz chalked a familiar beagle, and bird
companion, on the blackboard "to show I'm not some Hollywood model." Such
is the mystique surrounding the creator of Charlie Brown, Lucy, Linus, Snoopy
and the other inhabitants of his nationally syndicated comic strip.
Schultz fielded questions on the philosophical, educational and commercial
impact of his 'make-believe' characters while maintaining, "I can just draw pretty
well, write pretty well, think of things, turn phrases . . . I'm not trying to save the
world or influence people."
Chairman Snoopy?
Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber, a visiting French journalist, told Schultz that
when recently enrolling his children in a local elementary school, !-e saw Snoopy
or Charlie Brown in every room, as one would see Chairman Mao in Red China.
This, he said, obviously poses a .oral or political quandry.
When the audience quieted after succumbing to the imagery of the analogy,
Servan-Schreiber asked Schultz if he sometimes had a feeling of overwhelming
responsibility towards this country. The cartoonist admitted, "I try not to think
about things like that."
Schultz spoke of searching for new ways of finding "ideas that really get down
to where people are living." He didn't have to do much more than cite Charlie
Brown's obsession with the little red-haired girl or Peppermint Patty's puzzled
affection for "Chuck"to remind the students of his mastery in touching their
lives.

With the burgeoning popularity of Peanuts among college students,
philosophers, psychologists and theologians, it was inevitable that children would
eventually be attracted to the comic strip.
Turning a fad into an educational opportunity, Holt, Reinhardt and Winston
Publishing Company will soon debut a "Peanuts"line of reading texts. Slow
learners find encouragement reading Schultz when little else appeals to them.
Unique Approach
Schultz attributes the success of his characters to the uniqueness of his
approach and feels he was "fortunate to grow up in Minnesota where you have a
bland view of things. New Yorkers and San Franciscans are handicapped because
they think they live in the only places in the world."
One student, distressed that "everything from school supplies to bathroom
accessories" now bears caricatures of the Peanuts family, said he believed the
"purist ideals' of the comic strip had been subverted by commercialism. Schultz
reminded him that a syndicate, not Charles Schultz, owns the feature's copyright,
and that what is already commercial cannot be corrupted by commercialism.
He emphasized that although he has people "watching" the licensed
reproduction of his characters, there are abuses. Particularly difficult to police are
the illegal posters of a pregnant Lucy and such transgressions of the law as lewd
foreign translations of his work.
He Alone
Schultz was careful to stress that for 22 years he alone has thought or spoken
the words attributed to the characters appearing in his comic strips and books. He
is not directly involved in the "Peanuts" line of greeting cards nor in most other
off-shoots of his creations, but notes that there are about 30 groups reproducing
Peanuts and over 800 turning out Disney products.
He disassociates himself from such endeavors as R.L. Short's The Gospel
According to Peanuts and the play, "You're a Good Man Charlie Brown," but
comments that it was great having these fellows going around telling people how
theological I was. Ihe play was the greatest thing that happened to us, except for
Snoopy going to the moon."
Responding to a question on the mechanics of producing a cartoon strip,
Schultz told the audience that he enjoys getting his characters involved in a
continuing story, like Snoopv's exploits with the Red Baron, but the daily idea is
more important than maintaining a story. "That's why you only have to read
"Rex Morgan" once every six months and you still know what's happening," he
said.

or Charlie Brown in every room, as one would see Chairman Mao in Red China.
This, he said, obviously poses a .oral or political quandry.
When the audience quieted after succumbing to the imagery of the analogy,
Servan-Schreiber asked Schultz if he sometimes had a feeling of overwhelming
responsibility towards this country. The cartoonist admitted, "I try not to think
about things like that."
Schultz spoke of searching for new ways of finding "ideas that really get down

Brown's obsession with the little red-haired girl or Peppermint Patty's puzzled
affection for "Chuck"to remind the students of his mastery in touching their

With the burgeoning popularity of Peanuts among college students,
philosophers, psychologists and theologians, it was inevitable that children would
eventually be attracted to the comic strip.
Turning a fad into an educational opportunity, Holt, Reinhardt and Winston
Publishing Company will soon debut a "Peanuts"line of reading texts. Slow
learners find encouragement reading Schultz when little else appeals to them.
Unique Approach
Schultz attributes the success of his characters to the uniqueness of his
approach and feels he was "fortunate to grow up in Minnesota where you have a
bland view of things. New Yorkers and San Franciscans are handicapped because
they think they live in the only places in the world."
One student, distressed that "everything from school supplies to bathroom
accessories" now bears caricatures of the Peanuts family, said he believed the
"purist ideals' of the comic strip had been subverted by commercialism. Schultz
reminded him that a syndicate, not Charles Schultz, owns the feature's copyright,
and that what is already commercial cannot be corrupted by commercialism.
He emphasized that although he has people "watching" the licensed
reproduction of his characters, there are abuses. Particularly difficult to police are
the illegal posters of a pregnant Lucy and such transgressions of the law as lewd
foreign translations of his work.
He Alone
Schultz was careful to stress that for 22 years he alone has thought or spoken
the words attributed to the characters appearing in his comic strips and books. He
is not directly involved in the "Peanuts" line of greeting cards nor in most other
off-shoots of his creations, but notes that there are about 30 groups reproducing
Peanuts and over 800 turning out Disney products.
He disassociates himself from such endeavors as R.L. Short's The Gospel
According to Peanuts and the play, "You're a Good Man Charlie Brown," but
comments that it was great having these fellows going around telling people how
theological I was. Ihe play was the greatest thing that happened to us, except for
Snoopy going to the moon."
Responding to a question on the mechanics of producing a cartoon strip,
Schultz told the audience that he enjoys getting his characters involved in a
continuing story, like Snoopv's exploits with the Red Baron, but the daily idea is
more important than maintaining a story. "That's why you only have to read
"Rex Morgan" once every six months and you still know what's happening," he
said.
You're a good man, Charles Schultz, and however much you insist, "I just draw
cartoons," there is a reason that it was Snoopy who went to the moon and not
one of the girls from "Apartment 3-G."
Demonstrating his talents before a communications class and a few of the
Peanuts faithful yesterday afternoon, Schultz chalked a familiar beagle, and bird
companion, on the blackboard "to show I'm not some Hollywood model." Such
is the mystique surrounding the creator of Charlie Brown, Lucy, Linus, Snoopy
and the other inhabitants of his nationally syndicated comic strip.
Schultz fielded questions on the philosophical, educational and commercial
impact of his 'make-believe' characters while maintaining, "I can just draw pretty
well, write pretty well, think of things, turn phrases . . . I'm not trying to save the
world or influence people."
Chairman Snoopy?
Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber, a visiting French journalist, told Schultz that
when recently enrolling his children in a local elementary school, !-e saw Snoopy
or Charlie Brown in every room, as one would see Chairman Mao in Red China.
This, he said, obviously poses a .oral or political quandry.
