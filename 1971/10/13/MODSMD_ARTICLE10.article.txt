## Students Needed For SJC, Unwarranted Delays 
### 
Doug Mcllenry's article on
Stanford Judicial Council (SJC)
Reforms and Student Selection
(The Daily, October 4, 1971)
dispenses most cavalierly with an
extremely serious matter—the
refusal of the ASSU Senate to
appoint the student members to
the Student Selection Committee
for the SJC, thereby preventing
that selection committee from
appointing the student members
of this year's SJC.
The author makes two points:
first, that it was too late in the
Spring Quarter and too
unimportant a matter for the
ASSU Senate to consider; and
second, that the University
administration ought not to be so
importunate over the matter
anyway, but rather should have
been devoting its energies instead
to the support of certain judicial
"reforms."
Lest the claim of the lateness
of the Spring Quarter be
construed as an assertion that the
administration's exhortations
were ill-timed, it should be noted
that on March 16, 1971—before
the Spring Quarter even began—a
written request was made of the
Chairman of the ASSU Senate
that the matter be placed on the
Senate's agenda.
If, on the other hand, the
reference to lateness was but
intended to imply that it was late
in the Spring Quarter before the
ASSU Senate was able to consider
the matter, one can only note that
the appointments are yet to be
made—despite further letters from
President Lyman—and that a
number of other appointments to
other committees have been made

during the summer and this fall by
the summer committee of the
ASSU Senate.
It is more likely that, as rumors
indicate, the reason for the
Senate's refusal to act is simply a
desire that the appointments to
the Student Selection Committee
not be made so that the student
members of the SJC would not be
appointed in the manner provided
for under the Legislative and
Judicial Charter-presumably in
the hope that this would
incapacitate the SJC and compel
the faculty and administration to
accept certain suggested changes
in the judicial system.
Pending Cases Important
It is true, as the article asserts,
that the University has exhibited
much anxiety to have the cases
currently pending heard and
decided. It is difficult to
understand why one would look
askance at this. The University's
obligation to do its best to
provide for the safety of the
members of this community
requires a reasonably expeditious
method of handling cases
involving serious misconduct.
As President Lyman noted in
his letters to the ASSU Council of
Presidents and the Chairman of
the ASSU Senate in May and
again last month, this cannot be
achieved unless the SJC begins
promptly to dispose of the
present backlog of cases. It should
be noted that a number of these
cases involving serious offenses
(such as major assaults and
burglaries) have already been
pending for more than three
months. In addition, many of the

persons charged in pending cases
are desirous of having their cases
disposed of as soon as possible.
It would be of little
consolation to present and future
victims of serious misconduct and
to defendants wishing to plan
their lives around the possibilities
of serious University sanctions
that further lengthy delays in the
disposition of current and future
cases will hopefully result in
improvements in the judicial
system.
It is also true, as the article
states, that the University
administration has not pursued
certain judicial "reforms." The
"reforms" referred to are those
necessary to: a) alter the
composition of the faculty-student
SJC to an all-student body; b)
prohibit University discipline of
any student criminally or civilly
charged as a result of the same
conduct, and c) reduce or
eliminate the authority of the
President to alter a decision of the
SJC and to alter the entire judicial
system if necessary. The
administration has not pursued
these "reforms" because it does
not agree that they would
improve the judicial sytem.
All-Student Judicial Council
Not Viable
In particular, with regard to an
all-student judicial council, the
apparent effort of the present
ASSU Senate to prevent the
appointment of the student
members to the SJC in order to
facilitate an acceptance of these
suggestions is perhaps the best
testimony against the viability of
such a system.
The historical argument

presented in Mr. McHenry's article
misstates the background of the
Legislative and Judicial Charter in
implying that the composition of
the SJC consisted of faculty as
well as students because the
Charter was originally intended to
apply to faculty as well as
students.
The Charter dealt only with
student dicipline. After the
Charter was promulgated, the
Faculty Senate passed a resolution
endorsing the Policy on Campus
Disruption as binding upon the
faculty, and, in addition, made an
abortive attempt to confer a
limited jurisdiction upon the SJC
for adjudicating faculty violations
of this policy. The latter attempt
was never consummated because
it was never approved by the
Academic Council, the students,
and the President as is required to
amend the Charter.
Aside from the history of the
question, it is asserted that
judgment by peers requires
judgment only by students. This is
at best sophistic. Judgment by
peers is not limited to judgment
by people of the same age,
vocational group, university class,
university living group, or
university department. Under the
present Charter a student is
judged by the students and
faculty of his same academic
community. He need not be
judged only be students any more
than a freshman need be judged
only by freshmen.
Civil, Criminal Remedies
No Substitute
University Discipline
The second proposed "reform,
i.e., prohibiting discipline of
persons charged civilly or
criminally for the same conduct,
finds little support in the
administration because the
purposes of and ends achieved by
civil, criminal, and University
disciplinary measures are not the
same. The University has an
interest in preserving the
functions of the University—an
interest distinct from that of the
State of California—and cani.ot
rely on the application of civil and
criminal laws to fulfill its own
responsibility for maintaining a
campus free of physical violence
and disruption.
For the University to restrict
its disciplinary action to
misconduct which is not likely to
become or has not become the
subject of a civil or criminal
action leads to the anomalous

result that the more serious the
conduct, the less the University,
itself, can or will do about it.
The argument in support of
this suggestion appears to be
based on the notion that because
the constitutions of the United
States and the State of California
prohibit the trial of a person twice
before the same criminal court for
the same offense, a student is
denied his constitutional rights if
the University seeks to discipline
him for conduct for which he has
also been sued civilly or charged
criminally by the State.
The fallacy here is that the
constitutional right against
"double jeopardy" is not nearly as
broad as the conclusion would
require, i.e., in any state a person
may be tried in a criminal court, a
civil court, numerous
administrative courts, and
disciplined privately for the same
misconduct.
As an example, physicians and
attorneys at times are successfully
sued by patients or clients for
malpractice in a civil court, have
their licenses to practice
suspended in an administrative
hearing, are convicted in a
criminal court, and, if employed
by others, are fired by their
employers- all resulting from the
same misconduct. In each case, as
with that of University discipline,
a different interest is being
safeguarded.
Overriding Presidential
Authority Required
The lack of administration
support for the third suggested
"reform," i.e., reducing the
overriding authority of the
President, is based both on legal
restrictions and on experience
with judicial systems at Stanford.
As to the former, the general
responsibilities vested in the
President by the Founding Grant
would likely prevent him frcm
legally delegating his authority to
maintain order on the campus.
As for the latter, suffice it to
say that the practical need for
residual presidential authority to
promulgate alternate means of
government is evidenced most
obviously by the present occasion,
i.e., the refusal of the ASSU
Senate to comply with the
provisions of the Legislative and
Judicial Charter.
It should be noted, however,
that with regard to review of SJC
decisions, in three years of
operation of the present judicial
system, during which over 60
cases were handled by the SJC,

the President has modified a
decision of the SJC only
twice—once at the request of a
defendant and a second time in
order to clarify the meaning of a
penalty previously
imposed—though the President on
several occasions has expressed his
dissatisfaction with
recommendations of the SJC.
Suggested Judicial Changes
Not Mandates
The Charter, which was ratified
by the students, faculty, and the
President in 1968, is the product
of two agonizing years of effort
by a committee composed of
faculty, students and
administrators, i.e., the
Committee of Fifteen (C-15). It
provides that amendments must
be formulated, approved, and
proposed by the C-15 acting on
requests from the ASSU Senate,
the Academic Council or the
President, and then be approved
by the students, faculty, and the
President.
While this process of
amendment is lengthy, it assures
some representative agreement on
propositions before they are
submitted to the three
Constituencies for final approval.
Consequently, the above
"reforms" are not "mandates," as
they are characterized in Mr.

John j. Schwartz

McHenry's article, and an attempt
to force an improvident
acceptance of them by disabling
the judicial system altogether is
hardly consistent with the method
of amendment provide for in the
charter.
The University adminstration
again asks that the members of
student government act
responsibly, promptly comply
with the provisions of the
Legislative and Judicial Charter
and enable the community to be
afforded its "constitutional"
judicial system. At the same time,
the administration, and also, 1 am
sure, the C-15, are certainly
willing, and indeed anxious, to
"pursue in earnest the
development of a more equitable
and expeditious system of justice
for the Stanford community" as
Mr. McHenry requests.
On the other hand, the
administration is not willing either
to abandon University discipline
altogether while participating in
such pursuits, or to be coerced
into the indiscriminate support of
a new judicial system even more
vulnerable to precipitous
renunciations by the ASSU
Senate.

Assistant to the President.)
