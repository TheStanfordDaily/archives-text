weak case
Editor, THE DAILY:
It is clear that Bruce Franklin
is being fired for political reasons
by the administration of this
university. We oppose the use of
law and "quasi-legal" proceedings
for such selective ends.
Now that the prosecution's
v<Â»se has closed, we can see that
the evidence the administration
has been able to gather in the
eight months since it fired Bruce
is very weak. There is no evidence
of Bruce taking any actions. In
fact, he is mainly being charged
with inciting actions. But the links
between his words and others'
actions are tenuous and connected
only by the subjective conclusions
of mistaken, biased or outright
perjured witnesses.
The administration is aware
that Bruce's activities could not
lead to a conviction in state court.
So, they resorted to their
discretionary, private power. Yet,
even in the standardless procedure
now underway, the
administration's action is shown
to be excessive. Certainly the
Advisory Board should recognize
that a liberal academic

environment must grant at least
the minimum protection to
individuals that the government
affords.
We can only conclude that the
administration response was based
on motives other than
disinterested fairness. Repression
of Bruce's political position is not
a proper motive for administrative
action.

speer & hess
Editor, THE DAILY:
In his letter of October 11,
Professor Carl Degler drew a
parallel between the appearance
on campus of Henry Cabot Lodge
and the hypothetical appearance
of Albert Speer and Rudolph
Hess. The parallel seems faulty,
however. Speer and Hess are
convicted war criminals who have
paid heavily for their crimes. More
important, their crimes are over
with, ended.
Henry Cabot Lodge will
probably never be tried for his
acts in a court of law, and the
crimes he instigated go on at this
very moment. The victims cannot

even be counted because their
numbers are being added to hour
by hour. (For those who say that
Lodge should not be considered
guilty before he is tried I suggest a
reading of the Pentagon Papers.)
A closer parallel could be
drawn between Lodge's
appearance in 1971 and the
appearance of Speer and Hess in
1941, when the Nazis had invaded
eastern Europe and had begun the
extermination of Jews and others,
but when it seemed unlikely that
those responsible would ever face
trial. The parallel would be closer
yet if Speer and Hess were to be
introduced as "distinguished
guests" of Stanford University,
with all that this implies. And the
parallel would be complete if
Speer and Hess had announced in
a news conference that they
would refuse to answer questions
about Nazi extermination policies
but would only discuss, say, the
flora and fauna of German forests.
Under these circumstances, if a
Stanford professor and his
students heckled the speakers,
would the university be justified
in punishing them? It is a question
that those old enough to
remember should ask themselves.
