Prof. William F. Massy, 37, of
the Graduate School of Business,
has been named vice provost for
research here.
The announcement was made
by Provost William F. Miller, who
said Massy "brings to academic
administration the perspective of
a behavioral scientist, coupled
with a profound understanding of
mathematical models. When
added to his personal interest in
the physical and engineering
sciences, these qualities will allow
him to be an outstanding principal
research officer."
Massy will be responsible for
University policies regarding
sponsored research, and will share
responsibility for graduate
research in the sciences and
engineering. He will also oversee
those research laboratories not
connected with a department.
"Stanford is a great research
institution, and I believe it has a
social obligation to use that
capability," Massy said he thinks
there is a particular growth
potential in the humanities and
social sciences, especially in social
policy and i iterdiscipli inry

studies.
"Society's need for research in
these areas has broadened the
scope of support for new efforts,
although the major block of
support will probably remain for
some time with the physical
sciences," Massy comments.
He also hopes to increase the
"synergism" or interrelated
effectiveness of teaching and
research.
