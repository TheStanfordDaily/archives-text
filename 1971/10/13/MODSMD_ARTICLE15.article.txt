# USC, UCLA Next
## Poloists Dump Cal, Pomona 
### DOUG WILSON 
Stanford's highly-rated water
polo team, with a key win against
Berkeley, a rout of non-power
Pomona, and a defeat at the hands
of a non-conference power (the
alumni) behind them, faces two of
the strongest water polo squads in
the nation this weekend when
they meet UCLA Friday night and
USC Saturday morning, both in
Los Angeles. The games should be
good previews of the NCAA
Championships to be held at Long
Beach State in November.
Stanford Coach Jim Gaughran,
however, feels his varsity squad
not only will have to improve on
the past weekend's performances,

but will have to start playing its
own game. On the Berkeley win,
Gaughran commented, "We
should have beat them by more
than we did. It seems like we've
been playing according to how the
other team does, playing poorly
when they're poor, and playing
well when they do."
The Indians defeated a tough
California squad last Friday by
one point, 11-10. Stanford was
led by All Pacific 8 selection Rick
Massamino, who scored six of the
eleven goals. The Indian offense
was hampered early, however,
when Randy Wilkins, a strong
Stanford scorer, fouled out in the
first quarter. Other Stanford

scorers were Bill Simpkins, Mike
Davis, and Stu Rowe.
The Indian massacre of Cal
Poly-Pomona marked the first
time the two teams have met—and
possibly the last. A 23-12 dunking
of the Southern California school
was the result of an offensive
scoring spree which included just
about everyone on the Stanford
field team—Massamino, Wilkins,
Davis, Ken Hammer, Greg Loitz,
Rob Wooley, Rowe, Mark Van
Brussel, Simpkins and Bill
Roberts.
The All-Stanford
Varsity-Alumni game resulted in
the varsity poloists' only defeat of
the weekend, as the all-star alumni
won for the first time ever, 14-11.
The match proved for the most
part to be a duel between varsity
goalie Pete Gadd and two-time
Olympian Gary Sheerer, who
managed to put four shofs past
Gadd in the first three quarters of
play. Sheerer headed a
talent-laden offensive unit of
former Stanford stars which
included John Parker and Mark
Parmeley, who scored twice each
for the alumni.
The Indians will need
superlative performances against
their two Los Angeles rivals this
weekend. USC recently managed
to defeat defending NCAA champ
UC-Irvine by 7 points, and UCLA,

in turn, beat their cross-town
rivals, 8-6.
Of the UCLA squad, whom
Stanford meets at 7:00 p.m.
Friday night at Santa Monica High
School pool, Gaughran said,
'They've got a super-long bench
of awfully tough players. Their
goalie, who played in U.S.
National competition and against
the Yugoslav team, is worth three
or four points just by being in
there." Gaughran feels that Gadd
will have to put forth a superlative
effort against UCLA--"one which
he is capable of. If Pete plays a
great game, he's just as good as
Craig (of UCLA)."
The USC-Stanford match is
tentatively scheduled for 10:00
a.m. Saturday at the Southern Cal
campus. "We will face a typical
hard-breaking USC team,"
Gaughran said, "and their shallow
pool will be a great equalizer.
Frank Heckl (six-time gold-medal
winner in the Pan-American
swimming competition at Cali,
Columbia) is not only a strong
swimmer, he's tough in polo,
too."
According to Gaughran, each
match could go far in determining
the eventual Pac-8 (and national)
champion. "In order for us to
figure, we've got to come out of
one or the other pools with a
victory," he stated.

than we did. It seems like we've
been playing according to how the
other team does, playing poorly
when they're poor, and playing
well when they do."
The Indians defeated a tough
California squad last Friday by
one point, 11-10. Stanford was
led by All Pacific 8 selection Rick
Massamino, who scored six of the
eleven goals. The Indian offense
was hampered early, however,
when Randy Wilkins, a strong
Stanford scorer, fouled out in the
first quarter. Other Stanford

scorers were Bill Simpkins, Mike
Davis, and Stu Rowe.
The Indian massacre of Cal
Poly-Pomona marked the first
time the two teams have met—and
possibly the last. A 23-12 dunking
of the Southern California school
was the result of an offensive
scoring spree which included just
about everyone on the Stanford
field team—Massamino, Wilkins,
Davis, Ken Hammer, Greg Loitz,
Rob Wooley, Rowe, Mark Van
Brussel, Simpkins and Bill
Roberts.
The All-Stanford
Varsity-Alumni game resulted in
the varsity poloists' only defeat of
the weekend, as the all-star alumni
won for the first time ever, 14-11.
The match proved for the most
part to be a duel between varsity
goalie Pete Gadd and two-time
Olympian Gary Sheerer, who
managed to put four shofs past
Gadd in the first three quarters of
play. Sheerer headed a
talent-laden offensive unit of
former Stanford stars which
included John Parker and Mark
Parmeley, who scored twice each
for the alumni.
The Indians will need
superlative performances against
their two Los Angeles rivals this
weekend. USC recently managed
to defeat defending NCAA champ
UC-Irvine by 7 points, and UCLA,

in turn, beat their cross-town
rivals, 8-6.
Of the UCLA squad, whom
Stanford meets at 7:00 p.m.
Friday night at Santa Monica High
School pool, Gaughran said,
'They've got a super-long bench
of awfully tough players. Their
goalie, who played in U.S.
National competition and against
the Yugoslav team, is worth three
or four points just by being in
there." Gaughran feels that Gadd
will have to put forth a superlative
effort against UCLA--"one which
he is capable of. If Pete plays a
great game, he's just as good as
Craig (of UCLA)."
The USC-Stanford match is
tentatively scheduled for 10:00
a.m. Saturday at the Southern Cal
campus. "We will face a typical
hard-breaking USC team,"
Gaughran said, "and their shallow
pool will be a great equalizer.
Frank Heckl (six-time gold-medal
winner in the Pan-American
swimming competition at Cali,
Columbia) is not only a strong
swimmer, he's tough in polo,
too."
According to Gaughran, each
match could go far in determining
the eventual Pac-8 (and national)
champion. "In order for us to
figure, we've got to come out of
one or the other pools with a
victory," he stated.

ALUMNI ACTlON—Former Stanford standout John Parker (above)
readies for a goal, one of two he contributed to the alumni effort, as a
squad of ex-Indian stars defeated the varsity poloists, 14-11. Parker is
guarded by varsity member Bill Simpkins. Below, alumnus Mark
Parmeley, guarded by Greg Loitz of the varsity, scrambles for
possession of the ball- -which was subsequently put past Indian goalie
Pete Gadd.

Stanford's highly-rated water
polo team, with a key win against
Berkeley, a rout of non-power
Pomona, and a defeat at the hands
of a non-conference power (the
alumni) behind them, faces two of
the strongest water polo squads in
the nation this weekend when
they meet UCLA Friday night and
USC Saturday morning, both in
Los Angeles. The games should be
good previews of the NCAA
Championships to be held at Long
Beach State in November.
Stanford Coach Jim Gaughran,
however, feels his varsity squad
not only will have to improve on
the past weekend's performances,

but will have to start playing its
own game. On the Berkeley win,
Gaughran commented, "We
