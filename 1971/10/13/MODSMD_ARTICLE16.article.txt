# Runners Place Third In Sacramento Meet
## 
### MIKE CHASSON 
Stanford's cross country team
in its last test before its Pacific-8
opener against UCLA and USC,
finished third behind a strong Cal
State Fullerton team and San
Diego State at the Sacramento
State Invitational last weekend.
Stanford was paced by Bernie
Lahde, who finished second in the
hundred runner field, 25 seconds
behind winner Mark Covert of
Fullerton. Duncan Macdonald did
an excellent job finishing fourth,
5 seconds behind Lahde. Kurt
Schoenrock made a fine showing
for a freshman, finishing 15th,
one minute behind Lahde.
Coach Marshall Clark placed
the blame for the Indians' third
place showing on the large time
spread between Lahde and
Macdonald and the rest of the
Indian runners. In winning,
Fullerton had eight men within
one minute of Covert, while
Stanford's seventh runner was
over three minutes behind Lahde.
Clark believes this is a problem
that must be corrected if Stanford

is to do well during the rest of the
season.
Next weekend Clark sees
UCLA as the team to beat at
Westwood.
The Bruins are led by three top
notch runners who will give
Stanford a real battle. USC, on
the other hand, is a comparatively
weak squad, not having any top
notch runners comparable to
Stanford's and UCLA's. The
outcome of the meet may depend
on how Arvid Kretz has rounded
into shape by race time. Krelz if
he is ready will give the Indians
another top flight runner to go
with Macdonald and Lahde.
If Stanford is to beat UCLA
the Indian runners must stay
much closer to Lahde, Macdonald,
and hopefully Kretz, than they
did at Sacramento.
The USC-UCLA race is of extra
importance to the Indians as the
Pacific Eight Championships,
Stanford's most important meet,
will be run on this same UCLA
course. Stanford's performance
Saturday will be a good indication
of the team's potential.
