# Inexperience Plagues Soccer Squad
## 
### JAY GELLERT 
Although nine starters from
last year's Stanford soccer team
art missing, Coach Fred Priddle is
hopeful that the team can repeat
last season's 9-5-2 record. The
squad, including only four seniors,
expects to develop as the season
progresses.
The inexperience is most

obvious on defense where there
are no returnees. It will be
difficult to fill the holes left by
the departures of Roy Bannerman
ud Phil Fletcher at fullback, and
Carlos Quintana and
Jl conference Ben White at
halfback.
Defense Weakened
Priddle is looking to Sam Casey
to lead the young defense. Casey,
the l*£m captain, is returning
aft«-r year overseas. Filling the
fullback positions are Tom Miller,
a sophomore who did not
compete as a freshman but earned
a smarting assignment in spring
practice and Robert Benedetti,
new on the varsity.
Don Williams and John Riedel
wil 1 jtart at halfbacks with Hunt
lemir.g, Grant Cioffi, Duard
SlatLery, Allen MacDougall and
Phii Salvador backing up the
starting defensive line-up.
The offense is also suffering
from iuexperionce. The loss of
high-scoring Chip Jessup, one of
the conference's leading scorers,
and the players who assisted him,
Linus Lau and Mark Smith, would
hurt any squad. Priddle is hoping
that returning lettermen Mike
Frank and Roc if v Barber along

with some of last year's frosh stars
can helfi ease the loss of Jessup,
Lau and Smith.
Fr:-»r>k will start at one wing
and either Steve Seav or Edward
Caldwell will start at the other
wing position. Since his move
from the defensive left halfback
to left inside, Rocky Barber has
provided all the offensive punch
for the Indians, scoring four goals.
Tom Wattles and Robert
Harbaugh fill out Priddles' starting
offensive squad at the positions of
right inside and center forward.
Both players havo iittle varsity
experience and must prove
themselves at their positions.
Goalie Problems
Goalie Walt Harris has never
played varsity before, and his
inexperience has caused problems.
Priddle feels, however, that Harris
will improve with experience.
Priddle is using a formation of
four forwards, three fullbacks,
and three halfbacks. This
configuration is suited to the
young talent on the squad mainly
because of its simplicity and the
defensive coverage it provides in
allowing for six defensemen and
four attackers.
The team has established a 1-2

record this season, beating the
U.S. Naval Postgraduate School
3-0 and losing to U.O.P. 5-0, and
Chico State 6-1. The scores are
not indicative of the team since it
has been plagued by mistakes
stemming from inexperience.
Games This Week
This Wednesday at 8 p.m., the
Indians will meet the University
of Santa Clara in an away game.
Stanford will host the Cal team
this Saturday at 1:30 p.m.

SlatLery, Allen MacDougall and
Phii Salvador backing up the
starting defensive line-up.
The offense is also suffering
from iuexperionce. The loss of
high-scoring Chip Jessup, one of
the conference's leading scorers,
and the players who assisted him,
Linus Lau and Mark Smith, would
hurt any squad. Priddle is hoping
that returning lettermen Mike
Frank and Roc if v Barber along

with some of last year's frosh stars
can helfi ease the loss of Jessup,
Lau and Smith.
Fr:-»r>k will start at one wing
and either Steve Seav or Edward
Caldwell will start at the other
wing position. Since his move
from the defensive left halfback
to left inside, Rocky Barber has
provided all the offensive punch
for the Indians, scoring four goals.
Tom Wattles and Robert
Harbaugh fill out Priddles' starting
offensive squad at the positions of
right inside and center forward.
Both players havo iittle varsity
experience and must prove
themselves at their positions.
Goalie Problems
Goalie Walt Harris has never
played varsity before, and his
inexperience has caused problems.
Priddle feels, however, that Harris
will improve with experience.
Priddle is using a formation of
four forwards, three fullbacks,
and three halfbacks. This
configuration is suited to the
young talent on the squad mainly
because of its simplicity and the
defensive coverage it provides in
allowing for six defensemen and
four attackers.
The team has established a 1-2

record this season, beating the
U.S. Naval Postgraduate School
3-0 and losing to U.O.P. 5-0, and
Chico State 6-1. The scores are
not indicative of the team since it
has been plagued by mistakes
stemming from inexperience.
Games This Week
This Wednesday at 8 p.m., the
Indians will meet the University
of Santa Clara in an away game.
Stanford will host the Cal team
this Saturday at 1:30 p.m.
Although nine starters from
last year's Stanford soccer team
art missing, Coach Fred Priddle is
hopeful that the team can repeat
last season's 9-5-2 record. The
squad, including only four seniors,
expects to develop as the season
progresses.
The inexperience is most

obvious on defense where there
are no returnees. It will be
difficult to fill the holes left by
the departures of Roy Bannerman
ud Phil Fletcher at fullback, and
Carlos Quintana and
Jl conference Ben White at
halfback.
Defense Weakened
Priddle is looking to Sam Casey
to lead the young defense. Casey,
the l*£m captain, is returning
aft«-r year overseas. Filling the
fullback positions are Tom Miller,
a sophomore who did not
compete as a freshman but earned
a smarting assignment in spring
practice and Robert Benedetti,
new on the varsity.
Don Williams and John Riedel
wil 1 jtart at halfbacks with Hunt
lemir.g, Grant Cioffi, Duard
SlatLery, Allen MacDougall and
Phii Salvador backing up the
starting defensive line-up.
