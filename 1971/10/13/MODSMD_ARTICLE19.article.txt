Nixon Plans Moscow Visit
WASHINGTON — President Nixon announced
yesterday that he is going to Moscow in late May to
meet with top Soviet leaders because there exists now
"a possibility of making significant progress" toward
settling major differences between the superpowers.
His statement said "President Nixon and the
Soviet leaders will review all major issues, with a view
toward further improving their bilateral relations and
enhancing the prospects of world peace."
Nixon took pains to explain that there is no
connection between the projected Moscow trip and
the journey to Communist China which he
announced last summer he would make sometime by
or before next May. And the White House said the
two trips will be separated "by a bridge of time."
Initial response in Congress to the President's
announcement was favorable on both sides of the
party aisle.
The news was announced without comment in
Moscow. Japanese and Western European sources
welcomed the planned trip, although admitting to
being surprised at the announcement.
Aircraft Carrier Sails
ALAMEDA — The aircraft carrier Coral Sea left on an
eight-day shake-down cruise along the West Coast

called "S.O.S.—Stop Our Ship," were aboard for the
shakedown cruise with one exception, said Alan
Miller, director of Pacific Counseling Service of San

Francisco, a civilian group aiding the sailors' protest.
The sailor was identified as 20-year-old Larry Harris.
Harris said at a news conference more than 1,0 00
of the Coral Sea's 4,500-man crew had signed a
petition asking Congress to prevent the Coral Sea
from returning to Vietnam for "an active part in the
conflict."
Bayh Withdraws

enthusiastically support any one of them."

leaders a memorandum personally initialed with his

agencies. But Nixon left open the possibility that he
might take a hand on occasion.

His statement said "President Nixon and the
Soviet leaders will review all major issues, with a view
toward further improving their bilateral relations and

connection between the projected Moscow trip and
the journey to Communist China which he
announced last summer he would make sometime by
or before next May. And the White House said the
two trips will be separated "by a bridge of time."
Initial response in Congress to the President's
announcement was favorable on both sides of the
party aisle.
The news was announced without comment in
Moscow. Japanese and Western European sources
welcomed the planned trip, although admitting to
being surprised at the announcement.
