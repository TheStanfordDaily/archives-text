# Board Denies Dismissal Motions, Franklin To Begin Defense Today
## 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
The Faculty Advisory Board
yesterday denied H. Bruce Franklin's
motions for dismissal of the charges
against him.
The board's decision came late in
the afternoon after Administration
attorney Raymond Fisher had argued
for two and one half hours against
dismissal. The board reached its
decision after an hour of deliberations.
In denying the motions, Advisory
Board Chairman Donald Kennedy said
the board agreed that "the University
has presented a prima facie case that
applicable rules of conduct under the
Statement of Policy on Appointment
and Tenure have been breached by
Professor Franklin."
Kennedy noted that in the first
charge against Franklin, disrupting a
speech by Henry Cabot Lodge on
January 10, the board "had serious

concerns about the conduct alleged,
but at the same time we feel that we
could be more fully informed regarding
its extent."
February 10
Franklin is also charged with inciting
occupation of the computer center and
nighttime violence in speeches on
February 10.
In a hopeful sign for Frnaklin,
Kennedy stated that "some members of
the board are by no means convinced
by the evidence presented that there
was a causal relationship between
Professor Franklin's speeches and
events that followed either of the
February 10 rallies."
But the board also stated that there
was still "the question whether his
speech made significant contributions
to the risk that such events would
occur."
The fourth charge against Franklin is
that he interfered with the dispersal of
persons around the Computation
Center after they had been declared an
unlawful assembly by police.
'Not Persuaded'
The board said that it was "not
persuaded that the order to clear the
area around the Computation Center
was unreasonable in view of the then
existing situation. The board reserves
judgment concerning Professor
Franklin's conduct following the
order."
He had also said Monday that the
regulations he is accused of violating
are "unduly vague."
Kennedy stated that the board had
not yet determined the validity of this
charge, but that "the University has the
right to establish rules of conduct to
assure its functioning and survival."
Suspension Continues
At the beginning of yesterday's
hearing, Kennedy also denied an earlier
request by Franklin that the board ask
President Lyman to lift his suspension.
Kennedy said that such an act by
the board would be "unfortunate and
misleading concerning the issues
currently before it."

Following the denial of this motion,
Fisher began his rebuttal of Franklin's
motions for dismissal.
At the time Franklin had entered his
motions on Monday, he had given two
and one half hours of argument.
Fisher's Rebuttal
In his rebuttal, Fisher said that
Franklin's description of his actions at
the Lodge speech as "heckling," was
"his own characterization and not that
of us or our witnesses."
Fisher added that "it is clear from
the tape of the event that this was not
heckling but a concerted effort to
drown him (Lodge) out, shout him
down, and prevent him from speaking."
Concerning events of February 10
Fisher charged that Franklin "on three
occasions acted to prevent or disrupt
the carrying out of University
functions.
"He deliberately urged shutting
down of the Computation Center when
he could reasonably foresee such events
would occur. He deliberately provoked
a confrontation with police. And he
encouraged the methods of People's
War which meant guerrilla warfare."
In his lengthy rebuttal Fisher made a
strong effort to pull together the
testimony of all the administration
witnesses so far.
Dramatic Close
Ending on a dramatic note, Fisher
concluded, "The issue for this board is
whether a small group of
self-appointed, self-styled
revolutionaries led by Professor
Franklin can bring this University to its
knees to serve their particular brand of
ideology.
"The main question is whether
roving bands of vigilantes with
Professor Franklin as their leader can
take over this University by tactics of
force, coercion, and if necessary, by
violence.
"He's not on trial for his beliefs. The
facts show that he's on trial for
deliberate and successful efforts to
forcefully and violently disrupt
Stanford University.

"If there's going to be freedom for
everyone at this University then
Professor Franklin's conduct on
January 11 and February 10 must be
punished."
Franklin Responds
Franklin was then allowed to speak
to Fisher's rebuttal for 15 minutes.
Joel Klein, a recent Harvard Law
School graduate who is assisting
Franklin in his defense, argued that
Franklin was being tried for his speech
and not his conduct and that his
speeches at best were only "vague calls
for violence" which the first
amendment allows.
Franklin then characterized Fisher's
remarks as "out and out Fascism in
liberal clothes."
He went on to say that "they're
trying to make public discussion of
tactics impossible and so what they'd
do is make discussion of tactics not
public and create Weathermen."
The board recessed to deliberate,
and announced its decision at about 5
p.m.
New Motion
Franklin then entered a new motion
for the board to specify the standards
and evidence which it is considering
important in the charges against him.
"We don't want to spend the rest of
our natural lives here," he added.
Franklin has already indicated he
has 226 witnesses to testify on the facts
alone in the case.
You Asked For It
Franklin then remarked that "you
asked for it," apparently referring to
his lengthy defense.
A perturbed Donald Kennedy
replied, "I'm sorry Professor Franklin,
but I believe it's you who asked for it,"
referring to the hearing which Franklin
requested.
Franklin replied tha that wasn't
right since it was really President
Lyman who asked for it.
At that point the hearing adjourned
for the day.
It resumes today at 1 p.m.
