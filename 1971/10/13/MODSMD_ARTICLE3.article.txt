# Psych Class 'Discrimination' Is Communication Experiment
## 
### CHRIS PECK 
A two-woek-old experiment
involving students enrolled in
Psychology 80 was revealed to the
Stanford community yesterday when
university administrators questioned
professor Cedric Clark about alleged
discrimination in his class—Race,
Communication and Behavior.
A not very well hidden controversy
over the black professor's class has been
swelling on campus since the first
meeting of Psych 80 two weeks ago
when the predominately white
enrollment in the class was informed by
Clark that "this is a 'course designed
primarily for blacks, and I really don't
want any whites in the class."
After last Thursday's meeting of the
class, more than 50 white students had
dropped the course and five or six of
them complained to the Dean of
Humanities and Sciences that, in the
words of one girl "professor Clark
made us feel so uncomfortable that we
cannot return to the class." One
student was even considering filing a
lawsuit against Stanford charging
discrimination in the class.
Last Friday, Professor Clark released
a letter to various administrators and
members of the black community
reinforcing his experiment in class with
a statement that "it is alleged that I
actively discouraged white students
from enrolling in class" and"I will
quickly affirm that this is absolutely
correct."
Meeting
In the eyes of Humanities and
Sciences Dean Albert Hastorf, the
situation became serious enough
Tuesday that he and professor Clark,
along with the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies James Gibbs, Chairman of
Psychology Richard Atkinson, and
Ombudswoman Lois Amsterdam met
to discuss the situation.
It was at this 9:00 a.m. meeting that
Clark first revealed the nature of the
experiment to the administrators.
"While most of you are unaware of it,"
Clark said, "you have been
participating in a communication
experiment. As some of you already
know, a scientific experiment involves

the altering or manipulation of some
external reality, and observing the
effects of that manipulation."
Clark then went on to outline how
he had purposely presented a cultural
nationalists' ideology of black
superiority to his Psych 80 class and
later in the letter addressed to Dean
Hastorf and other administrators. "The
manipulation of events was extended
beyond members of Psychology 80 to
include the university administration
system itself," Clark continued, "and
we're particularly conscious of the fact
that we are setting an academic
precedent in turning our attention
toward the system itself as a research
subject."
White Reaction
In terms of his own research, Clark
says he has two objectives in running
the experiment. "I hope to determine
how the white community got word of
what was going on, and second, how
the white community reacted to the
situation."
Analysis of the experiment will
constitute a good part of the class
discussion in Psych 80 for the rest of
the quarter, Clark says,"and I am
particularly interested in the effects
this has had on black students since
these issues are more directly relevant
to their experiences."
Even though the experiment
apparently is over now, university
administrators aren't ready to drop the
subject. Humanities and Sciences Dean
Hastorf says that in his opinion "some
people were burned badly by this
experiment, including more than 50
white students who dropped the class."
"There is still a question in my mind
as to whether the students who left the
class under pressure should now be
contacted and told of the experiment,"
Hastorf continued. "There is a question
of whether Professor Clark should now
make himself available to these
students."
Not Resolved
Chairman of Psychology Atkinson
adds that "while I really can't make
any comment on this matter at this
time, I can say that it isn't completely
resolved as vet."

Professor Clark has refused to
comment on the experiment, except
for his statement given to the
University administrators. In that
report he concluded that "it will be
interesting to watch and see how the
white newspaper (The Daily) and the
black newspaper (The Real News) treat
this story."
Head of the African and
Afro-American Studies program
St. Claire Drake also refused to
comment.
To all those involved in the
experiment Clark wrote, "I hope you
didn't mind being guinea pigs. More
importantly, I hope you have learned
something about yourself and the social
system in which you are, in one way or
another, deeplv imbedded."

Clark said, "you have been
participating in a communication
experiment. As some of you already
know, a scientific experiment involves

the altering or manipulation of some
external reality, and observing the
effects of that manipulation."
Clark then went on to outline how
he had purposely presented a cultural
nationalists' ideology of black
superiority to his Psych 80 class and
later in the letter addressed to Dean
Hastorf and other administrators. "The
manipulation of events was extended
beyond members of Psychology 80 to
include the university administration
system itself," Clark continued, "and
we're particularly conscious of the fact
that we are setting an academic
precedent in turning our attention
toward the system itself as a research
subject."
White Reaction
In terms of his own research, Clark
says he has two objectives in running
the experiment. "I hope to determine
how the white community got word of
what was going on, and second, how
the white community reacted to the
situation."
Analysis of the experiment will
constitute a good part of the class
discussion in Psych 80 for the rest of
the quarter, Clark says,"and I am
particularly interested in the effects
this has had on black students since
these issues are more directly relevant
to their experiences."
Even though the experiment
apparently is over now, university
administrators aren't ready to drop the
subject. Humanities and Sciences Dean
Hastorf says that in his opinion "some
people were burned badly by this
experiment, including more than 50
white students who dropped the class."
"There is still a question in my mind
as to whether the students who left the
class under pressure should now be
contacted and told of the experiment,"
Hastorf continued. "There is a question
of whether Professor Clark should now
make himself available to these
students."
Not Resolved
Chairman of Psychology Atkinson
adds that "while I really can't make
any comment on this matter at this
time, I can say that it isn't completely
resolved as vet."

Professor Clark has refused to
comment on the experiment, except
for his statement given to the
University administrators. In that
report he concluded that "it will be
interesting to watch and see how the
white newspaper (The Daily) and the
black newspaper (The Real News) treat
this story."
Head of the African and
Afro-American Studies program
St. Claire Drake also refused to
comment.
To all those involved in the
experiment Clark wrote, "I hope you
didn't mind being guinea pigs. More
importantly, I hope you have learned
something about yourself and the social
system in which you are, in one way or
another, deeplv imbedded."
A two-woek-old experiment
involving students enrolled in
Psychology 80 was revealed to the
Stanford community yesterday when
university administrators questioned
professor Cedric Clark about alleged
discrimination in his class—Race,
Communication and Behavior.
A not very well hidden controversy
over the black professor's class has been
swelling on campus since the first
meeting of Psych 80 two weeks ago
when the predominately white
enrollment in the class was informed by
Clark that "this is a 'course designed
primarily for blacks, and I really don't
want any whites in the class."
After last Thursday's meeting of the
class, more than 50 white students had
dropped the course and five or six of
them complained to the Dean of
Humanities and Sciences that, in the
words of one girl "professor Clark
made us feel so uncomfortable that we
cannot return to the class." One
student was even considering filing a
lawsuit against Stanford charging
discrimination in the class.
Last Friday, Professor Clark released
a letter to various administrators and
members of the black community
reinforcing his experiment in class with
a statement that "it is alleged that I
actively discouraged white students
from enrolling in class" and"I will
quickly affirm that this is absolutely
correct."
Meeting
In the eyes of Humanities and
Sciences Dean Albert Hastorf, the
situation became serious enough
Tuesday that he and professor Clark,
along with the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies James Gibbs, Chairman of
Psychology Richard Atkinson, and
Ombudswoman Lois Amsterdam met
to discuss the situation.
It was at this 9:00 a.m. meeting that
Clark first revealed the nature of the
experiment to the administrators.
