# Schafer Spices Up Tresidder Food
## 
### KATHY WEINBERGER 
Limited by the fact that the Tresidder cafeteria
was designed for use 10 years ago, Lee Schafer is
using his talents and imagination to "make the
Union. . .a place that fits with the present
generation."
Schafer, who replaced Ray Herrington as food
service director at Tresidder in August, says he feels
at home among students at Stanford. "I have a real
good indication of what students like—what food
they enjoy, and what atmosphere they like to be in,"
he said.
Schafer says he plans "new menus to include what
we believe are a fine variety of interesting foods. The
eating habits of students have changed in the past six
or seven years. Fun foods, less expensive foods, are
now more popular for lunch."
Shafer would also like to provide "a health-food
type of food service, including fruit and vegetable
juices and natural foods."
Within the near future he hopes to be able to sell
packaged snack-type items. "People could pick up an
item and take it out—like in a supermarket."
Schafer was selected by director of Tresidder
operations Forrest Tregea in August over 50 other
applicants. A student-initiated suggestion for the
establishment of a search committee was voiced too
late, after Tregea had already made the appointment.
Before coming to Stanford, Schafer worked "as a

management consultant for a wide variety of food
operations—for which he has conducted studies and
operational analyses, installed cost control systems,
initiated new and innovative merchandising plans, and
designed facilities," said Tregea.
He has experience in various commercial food
operations, including the position of Director of
Food and Beverage Services at the Clift Hotel in San
Francisco, according to Tregea.
Tregea and Schafer agree that this year's operation
at Tresidder should be smoother and more
satisfactory than last. "I'm sure we won't have to lay
off any more employees, and finances will start
improving. We can't expect magic overnight, but with
more revenue from the food service things should
begin to pick up," expressed Tregea. "The morale of
employees is just tremendous. With a new man, and
the place more attractive, they're all excited."
Scott Burke, junior philosophy major and author
of the controversial ASSU report on Tresidder
operations said that he supports Schafer in what he's
doing. "I was very impressed with his record, and I
think he's done a good job so far."
Burke now thinks that it may be possible for
Tresidder to change, even under Tregea. "Tregea
reacts only under pressure, and now that he realizes
he's in hot water, he'll innovate a lot to protect
himself. If the pressure stops, he will stop the
innovation."

off any more employees, and finances will start
improving. We can't expect magic overnight, but with
more revenue from the food service things should
begin to pick up," expressed Tregea. "The morale of
employees is just tremendous. With a new man, and
the place more attractive, they're all excited."
Scott Burke, junior philosophy major and author
of the controversial ASSU report on Tresidder
operations said that he supports Schafer in what he's
doing. "I was very impressed with his record, and I
think he's done a good job so far."
Burke now thinks that it may be possible for
Tresidder to change, even under Tregea. "Tregea
reacts only under pressure, and now that he realizes
he's in hot water, he'll innovate a lot to protect
himself. If the pressure stops, he will stop the
innovation."

FOOD MAN—Lee Schafer, new head of the Tresidder
food service, is responsible for a number of
innovations in the cafeteria this year, including "new
look" multicolored arrows on the walls, nearly 100
percent lower prices, and a return to the 10 cent cup
of coffee.
Limited by the fact that the Tresidder cafeteria
was designed for use 10 years ago, Lee Schafer is
using his talents and imagination to "make the
Union. . .a place that fits with the present
generation."
Schafer, who replaced Ray Herrington as food
service director at Tresidder in August, says he feels
at home among students at Stanford. "I have a real
good indication of what students like—what food
they enjoy, and what atmosphere they like to be in,"
he said.
Schafer says he plans "new menus to include what
we believe are a fine variety of interesting foods. The
eating habits of students have changed in the past six
or seven years. Fun foods, less expensive foods, are
now more popular for lunch."
Shafer would also like to provide "a health-food
type of food service, including fruit and vegetable
juices and natural foods."
Within the near future he hopes to be able to sell
packaged snack-type items. "People could pick up an
item and take it out—like in a supermarket."
Schafer was selected by director of Tresidder
operations Forrest Tregea in August over 50 other
applicants. A student-initiated suggestion for the
establishment of a search committee was voiced too
late, after Tregea had already made the appointment.
Before coming to Stanford, Schafer worked "as a

management consultant for a wide variety of food
operations—for which he has conducted studies and
operational analyses, installed cost control systems,
initiated new and innovative merchandising plans, and
designed facilities," said Tregea.
He has experience in various commercial food
operations, including the position of Director of
Food and Beverage Services at the Clift Hotel in San
Francisco, according to Tregea.
Tregea and Schafer agree that this year's operation
at Tresidder should be smoother and more
satisfactory than last. "I'm sure we won't have to lay
off any more employees, and finances will start
improving. We can't expect magic overnight, but with
more revenue from the food service things should
begin to pick up," expressed Tregea. "The morale of
employees is just tremendous. With a new man, and
