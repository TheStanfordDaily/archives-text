# on behalf of us all
## Nuremberg Does Apply 
### 
Stanford's Maoist Professor
Bruce Franklin acted in the
highest tradition of American
democracy and on behalf of us all
when he heckled Ambassador
Henry Cabot Lodge in Dinkelspiel
last January. And Professor
Halsted Holman is right also to
invoke the Nuremberg principles,
to which, according to Telford
Taylor, U.S. Chief Counsel at
Nuremberg and now Professor of
Law at Columbia, our country
stands "legally, politically and
morally committed."
That, however, does not mean
taking into our own hands "the
indictment, conviction and casual
punishment" of officials of our
government who we think are
guilty of war crimes, as Professor
Eitner seems to interpret our
position.
1 do not advocate "instant
convictions" or indeed any other
abridgment of due process, and
for that reason among others I
also dispute the appropriateness
of the analogy with McCarthyism
and all it implies of innuendo and
guilt by association in an era when
anyone suspected of sympathy
with communism was vulnerable
to persecution, intimidation or
dismissal from his job. In that
context, Professor Franklin is the
victim and not the perpetrator of
McCarthyism.
Henry Cabot Lodge ought
indeed to be brought to trial. He
was a principal architect of our
policy in Vietnam and directed its
execution on the spot from his

headquarters in Saigon.
Our government, however, has
been no more willing to take
action against its own leaders than
was Nazi Germany, whose
unconditional surrender had to
precede the establishment of the
International War Crimes Tribunal
in Nuremberg in 1 9 45. We know
the distasteful history of how a
succession of administrations of
both political parties have ignored
and sought to suppress
embarrassing revelations of
American war crimes in Vietnam
and have harassed and persecuted
military personnel who tried to
get the truth into the record. The
outcome of the My Lai trials
offers us a fair indication of the
kind of justice that the victims of
that hideous massacre can expect
of military courts in America.
In the absence of government
action, it becomes all the more
incumbent upon private citizens
to confront public officials and
demand an accounting from them,
and citizens who feel that to
refrain from accusing a man like
Lodge of war crimes is
tantamount to complicity will
continue to speak out, even at the
risk of legal (or institutional)
reprisal.
It is even more particularly
incumbent upon this university,
with its own history of complicity
in the conduct of the war, to
insure that the preparation for the
visit of a man like Henry Cabot
Lodge permit probing and
thorough discussion of the issues

Raymond giraud

with which he is inextricably
associated.
The University's failure to do
this, and arrangement for Lodge's
visit under terms that permitted
him to refuse categorically to
answer questions about the war
and his part in it suffice to justify
Professor Franklin's (and others')
confrontation with Lodge at
Dinkelspiel. Moreover, we know
that our country's crimes in
Vietnam have not come to an end.
Our government continues to
bomb, to gas, to destroy, and to
involve itself in sordid
manipulations of its puppet
regime's rigged elections in
Saigon. To confront Lodge was
therefore also a symbolic rebuke
to the President who invaded
Cambodia and Laos and continues
the devastation of all Indochina in
this illegal and genocidal war.

dismissal from his job. In that
context, Professor Franklin is the
victim and not the perpetrator of
McCarthyism.
Henry Cabot Lodge ought
indeed to be brought to trial. He
was a principal architect of our
policy in Vietnam and directed its
execution on the spot from his

headquarters in Saigon.
Our government, however, has
been no more willing to take
action against its own leaders than
was Nazi Germany, whose
unconditional surrender had to
precede the establishment of the
International War Crimes Tribunal
in Nuremberg in 1 9 45. We know
the distasteful history of how a
succession of administrations of
both political parties have ignored
and sought to suppress
embarrassing revelations of
American war crimes in Vietnam
and have harassed and persecuted
military personnel who tried to
get the truth into the record. The
outcome of the My Lai trials
offers us a fair indication of the
kind of justice that the victims of
that hideous massacre can expect
of military courts in America.
In the absence of government
action, it becomes all the more
incumbent upon private citizens
to confront public officials and
demand an accounting from them,
and citizens who feel that to
refrain from accusing a man like
Lodge of war crimes is
tantamount to complicity will
continue to speak out, even at the
risk of legal (or institutional)
reprisal.
It is even more particularly
incumbent upon this university,
with its own history of complicity
in the conduct of the war, to
insure that the preparation for the
visit of a man like Henry Cabot
Lodge permit probing and
thorough discussion of the issues

Raymond giraud

with which he is inextricably
associated.
The University's failure to do
this, and arrangement for Lodge's
visit under terms that permitted
him to refuse categorically to
answer questions about the war
and his part in it suffice to justify
Professor Franklin's (and others')
confrontation with Lodge at
Dinkelspiel. Moreover, we know
that our country's crimes in
Vietnam have not come to an end.
Our government continues to
bomb, to gas, to destroy, and to
involve itself in sordid
manipulations of its puppet
regime's rigged elections in
Saigon. To confront Lodge was
therefore also a symbolic rebuke
to the President who invaded
Cambodia and Laos and continues
the devastation of all Indochina in
this illegal and genocidal war.

Stanford's Maoist Professor
Bruce Franklin acted in the
highest tradition of American
democracy and on behalf of us all
when he heckled Ambassador
Henry Cabot Lodge in Dinkelspiel
last January. And Professor
Halsted Holman is right also to
invoke the Nuremberg principles,
to which, according to Telford
Taylor, U.S. Chief Counsel at
Nuremberg and now Professor of
Law at Columbia, our country
stands "legally, politically and
morally committed."
That, however, does not mean
taking into our own hands "the
indictment, conviction and casual
punishment" of officials of our
government who we think are
guilty of war crimes, as Professor
Eitner seems to interpret our
position.

convictions" or indeed any other
abridgment of due process, and
for that reason among others I
also dispute the appropriateness
of the analogy with McCarthyism
and all it implies of innuendo and
guilt by association in an era when
anyone suspected of sympathy
with communism was vulnerable
to persecution, intimidation or
dismissal from his job. In that
