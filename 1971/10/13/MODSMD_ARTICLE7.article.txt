## Overseas Program Needs Feedback 
### 
Stanford's Overseas Campus
Program is in trouble and needs
your help. An alternative that
claims the participation of over
50 % of undergraduates for some
six month period in their Stanford
careers, the program is faced with
the problem of fewer students
willing to go overseas than beds
available.
The current group in Austria,
for example, contains only 4 9
students, while the facilities are
adequate for 80 students. The
same situation prevails in the
current Italy group, which harbors
58 students, 30 short of capacity.
Moreover, five of the occupants
are women from Mills College as

the result of an agreement
designed to increase the
utilization of facilities.
What is the probiem and when
did it begin? As early as 1 967 , the
Overseas Campus Office
experienced sporadic cases of
difficulty in filling the available
beds, and by 1970, the Austrian
campus faced continual shortages.
The Overseas Campus office
claims that these shortages are
not, at one level, caused by
deficient demand. Each campus
goes through long alternate lists as
applicants drop out of the
program during the interim
between acceptance and
departure. For some reason,
students are being drawn to other
alternatives.
What, then, are the causes of
this attrition rate? For no good
reason, no one knows. The fact is
that without any means of
student r eedback into the
program, no one can tell why
students are dropping out of the
program. Nonetheless, many
explanations have been offered.
The money factor often heads
the list. With transatlantic air fares
lower than ever before, more and
more students find the Stanford
program to be something other
than the low-cost alternative that
it once claimed to be.
Certainly, the academic
program overseas is another target
of criticism. 53% of those who
answered a student-sponsored
questionnaire on their experience
in Britain X related that they had
not gone to Cliveden with the
expectation of doing serious
academic work.
The academic program mirrors
another oft-mentioned area of
discontent. The inability of the
program to provide the
participants with any sense of
integration into the foreign
culture represents at least partial
failure in terms of the goals of the
program. Critics claim that the
academic program actually works
in many ways to keep the student

from contact with the foreign
culture.
The academic program was
named the second least rewarding
facet of the overseas experience in
the Britain X questionnaire.
Interestingly enough, the least
rewarding aspect of the program
that was listed was a
closely-related one: a dearth of
friendships with Britons. Both of
these factors emphasize a feeling
of isolation within the country, a
sense of being an "enclave of
America."
Of course, these possibilities
are only a few of the many
explanations that can be
formulated to explain the present
plight of the overseas campus
program. Similarly, many
solutions have been devised,
ranging from the temperate step
of including other colleges in the
Stanford program to the approach
of radically altering the academic
structure of the campuses to allow
for research projects of much
greater scope.
My purpose in this article,
however, was not to be
informative but rather to ask the
community to offer some
feedback to the present program
by virtue of their overseas campus
experience. The instigation of a
questionnaire will be helpful in
the future, but for change now we
need your ideas now.
I ask each person who has been
on the program or ever considered
the program to participate in a
plebiscite on the present program

by assessing your experience, its
strengths, its weaknesses, and to
add whatever ideas you may have
for the future. Please include your
group number and campus, and
either mail your response to Box
5930, Stanford, or drop it off at
the Overseas Campus Office on
the first floor of the Old Union.
