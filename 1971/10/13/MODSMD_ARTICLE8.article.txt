# whose responsibility?
## Lyman And Police 
### 
The report of the Presidential
Commission on the Status of the
Stanford Police and the articles by
Anne Kimball and Larry Diamond
in Monday's and Tuesday's Daily
obscure the key issue concerning
the configuration of form and
responsibility for police services
on campus.
The key issue is the
identification of the individual or
individuals who have ultimate
authority over the law
enforcement officers who have
responsibility for the day-to-day
protection of the community and
operational control over
mutual-aid forces. The individual
with ultimate authority is the
person who can be held
accountable to the community for
the actions of the police force.
Currently, police service duties
are performed by the Stanford

herb borock

Police, while law enforcement
duties are performed by the Santa
Clara County Sheriff's
Department. Thus, President
Lyman is the individual with
ultimate authority over police
service duties, but Sheriff Geary is
the individual with ultimate
authority over law enforcement
In practice this means that
President Lyman can request the
Sheriff to provide law
enforcement duties and then
claim that he (Lyman) is not
responsible for what the Sheriff's
deputies do. Lyman has taken just
this position whenever mutual-aid
forces have been called onto the
campus.
If a sworn Stanford police
force is organized as an
independent force under new
state legislation, and President
Lyman has
ultimate authority over that force,
then I would prefer that
alternative to deputization of the
force by the Sheriff.
If the Sheriff has ultimate,
even if only nominal, control over
the force, whether organized
under new legislation or deputized
by the Sheriff, then we should
recognize that the Sheriff is the
person who can be held
accountable to the community for
the actions of the police force. In
that case, the Stanford police
force would consist of Sheriff's
deputies in fact, if not in name,
and they should wear the same
uniforms as other deputies and
patrol in cars that are
indistinguishable from those that
other deputies patrol in.
