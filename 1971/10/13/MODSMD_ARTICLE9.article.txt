# statement from china
## Nixon And Attica 
### 
huey p. Newton

A short time ago, the prisoners at Attica requested the Blaqk
Panther Party to negotiate with Nixon, Rockefeller and Oswald for
their freedom. The Black Panther Party at this time asks Chairman
Mao Tsetung of the People's Republic of China to negotiate with
Prison Warden Nixon foi the freedom of the oppressed peoples of the
world.
We recognize that the criminal activities of trigger-happy Nixon
show clearly that he has no respect for peaceful negotiation, when the
victim is divided and weak. He not only killed the prisoners at Attica,
but he also murdered his exploited workers, the prison guarUk
Although most of the prisoners at Attica are Black and all of the
guards are white, Nixon killed regardless of color, because they were
all victims.
When the oppressed people of the world ask for negotiation, such
as the Vietnamese People, Prison Warden Nixon shows again he has no
respect for the people nor his agents, the U.S. Military.,He leaves no
alternative but violent, armed resistance. He is responsible for the
murder of Vietnamese people and the deaths of the U.S. soldiers.
Both the Vietnamese people and the U.S. soldiers are victims of the
reactionary Nixon regime. This is why we approached Chairman Mao
Tsetung, because we know of his peace- and freedom-loving nature.
There can be no peace without freedom.
We are asking all the agents of Prison Warden Nixon (whom he
despises) to join forces with the victims of the world: the U.S. soldiers
to join forces with the victimized Vietnamese People; the guards and
the families of the deceased guards at Attica and the guards of the
state prisons across the U.S. to join forces with the victimized
inmates.
It is clear that Mr. Nixon is trigger-happy and could trigger off
World War 111. And because we know of his impending visit to the
People's Republic of China, we asked the Chinese People to receive us
first, so that we might ask the peace- and freedom-loving Chairman
Mao Tsetung to be the chief negotiator to Mr. Nixon for the peace
and freedom of the oppressed peoples of the world. And this is why
we ask for unity of all the world's victims against the common enemy,
the Nixon-Rockefeller regime.
(Huey P. Newton is the supreme commander and minister of
defense of the Black Panther Party.)
