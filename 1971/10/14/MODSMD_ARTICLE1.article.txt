# Miscarriages Likely
## Study Reveals Anesthetic Hazard 
### CAROL GREENE 
Nurses and female anesthetists who
work daily in hospital operating rooms
contaminated with trace amounts of
anesthetics are exposed to a potentially
serious health hazard, a Stanford
University medical research team
warned today.
Chronic exposure of operating room
staffs to low-grade anesthetic pollution
may cause miscarriage in pregnant
women, the researchers reported.
Their study calls on hospitals to
initiate measures as rapidly as possible
to reduce this operating room
contamination.
The Stanford research was initiated
because several recent studies have
called attention to the presence of trace
concentrations of anesthetic gases in
the operating room environment, and
indicated a potential hazard to
personnel. Until recently these trace
amounts of anesthetics were considered
harmless. Precise measurements of
anesthetic contamination in the
operating room had not been made.
Dr. Ellis N. Cohen, Dr. J. Weldon
Bellville, and Dr. Byron VV. Brown
based their two-part study on personal
interviews with 67 operating room

nurses and 92 general duty nurses in
three large hospitals in Northern
California and on a mail questionnaire
sent to 50 anesthetists and 81 female
physicians practicing in other
specialties.
Significant Increase
"Results indicate that during a
five-year period, 29.7 per cent of
pregnancies in operating room nurses
ended in spontaneous miscarriage
compared with 8.8 per cent in the
control group," the researchers
reported in the October issue of
Anesthesiology, a medical journal.
The increase in spontaneous
abortion was even more significant
among physician anesthetists who
receive a greater exposure to
anesthetics than do nurses, the report
shows.
These findings, according to the
researchers, are especially significant in
view of animal studies which show that
chronic exposure to small
concentrations of certain anesthetics is
lethal to the fetus.
Cohen and his associates are careful
to point out that showing a relationship
between employment in the operating
room and a significant increase in the

incidence of spontaneous abortion is no
proof of causation, and they note some
other possible causes. In the course of
the study, however, they have tried to
examine common factors between the
control and exposed groups, and
conclude that "there remains the
likelihood that trace anesthetic
concentrations do produce fetal
lethality in chronically exposed female
personnel."
Questions Raised
Commenting on the Stanford
research, a journal editorial calls for an
extension of the Cohen- Bellville-Brown
studies to the field of public health in
general.
"These findings are potentially more
far-reaching than operating room staff
and raisa the question of exposure to
volatile agents during pregnancy," the
editorial said.
The editorial also stressed the need
for studies to determine if anesthetics
and other agents cause birth defects.
Companion Report
In a companion report in the same
journal, Stanford researchers Dr.
Charles E. Whitcher, Dr. Ellis N. Cohen,
and Dr. James R. Trudell reported their
measurements of the level of exposure

to certain anesthetics in operating room
staff.
They determined the concentration
of the anesthetic, halothane, and found
a marked increase throughout the day.
Halothane, also known as fluothane,
is a potent anesthetic and is one of the
more frequently used anesthetic gases
in U.S. hospitals.
The report notes that halothane,
along with certain other anesthetic
gases, may be linked to some metabolic
and liver disturbances. One known side
effect of halothane is relaxation of
uterine muscles.
Scavenging System
The Stanford researchers point out
that more work needs to be done, "but
until this is proven or disproven, all
volatile agents present in the operating
room must remain suspect," they said.
"Total elimination of all waste
anesthetic gas is the goal, and should be
attainable," Cohen said. "In the
meantime, we recommend that all
possible corrective measures be
initiated."
One such measure involves
installation of a "scavenging system" in
connection with anesthesia equipment.
The system, developed by Whitcher and
his associates, captures overflow gases
during normal administration of
anesthesia, and vents them out of the
operating room.
Stanford University Hospital was the
first to install this device, Whitcher
reported, and operating room
contamination has been reduced to
about 10 to 15 per cent of the
previously measured.
Further studies on these subjects
will be organized, according to Dr.
Whitcher, but no definite date can be
set for their completion. Studies must
take place on the national level, he said,
in order to "validate the study and get
a larger base number to work with."

called attention to the presence of trace
concentrations of anesthetic gases in
the operating room environment, and
indicated a potential hazard to
personnel. Until recently these trace
amounts of anesthetics were considered
harmless. Precise measurements of
anesthetic contamination in the
operating room had not been made.
Dr. Ellis N. Cohen, Dr. J. Weldon
Bellville, and Dr. Byron VV. Brown
based their two-part study on personal
interviews with 67 operating room

nurses and 92 general duty nurses in
three large hospitals in Northern
California and on a mail questionnaire
sent to 50 anesthetists and 81 female
physicians practicing in other
specialties.
Significant Increase
"Results indicate that during a
five-year period, 29.7 per cent of
pregnancies in operating room nurses
ended in spontaneous miscarriage
compared with 8.8 per cent in the
control group," the researchers
reported in the October issue of
Anesthesiology, a medical journal.
The increase in spontaneous
abortion was even more significant
among physician anesthetists who
receive a greater exposure to
anesthetics than do nurses, the report
shows.
These findings, according to the
researchers, are especially significant in
view of animal studies which show that
chronic exposure to small
concentrations of certain anesthetics is
lethal to the fetus.
Cohen and his associates are careful
to point out that showing a relationship
between employment in the operating
room and a significant increase in the

incidence of spontaneous abortion is no
proof of causation, and they note some
other possible causes. In the course of
the study, however, they have tried to
examine common factors between the
control and exposed groups, and
conclude that "there remains the
likelihood that trace anesthetic
concentrations do produce fetal
lethality in chronically exposed female
personnel."
Questions Raised
Commenting on the Stanford
research, a journal editorial calls for an
extension of the Cohen- Bellville-Brown
studies to the field of public health in
general.
"These findings are potentially more
far-reaching than operating room staff
and raisa the question of exposure to
volatile agents during pregnancy," the
editorial said.
The editorial also stressed the need
for studies to determine if anesthetics
and other agents cause birth defects.
Companion Report
In a companion report in the same
journal, Stanford researchers Dr.
Charles E. Whitcher, Dr. Ellis N. Cohen,
and Dr. James R. Trudell reported their
measurements of the level of exposure

to certain anesthetics in operating room
staff.
They determined the concentration
of the anesthetic, halothane, and found
a marked increase throughout the day.
Halothane, also known as fluothane,
is a potent anesthetic and is one of the
more frequently used anesthetic gases
in U.S. hospitals.
The report notes that halothane,
along with certain other anesthetic
gases, may be linked to some metabolic
and liver disturbances. One known side
effect of halothane is relaxation of
uterine muscles.
Scavenging System
The Stanford researchers point out
that more work needs to be done, "but
until this is proven or disproven, all
volatile agents present in the operating
room must remain suspect," they said.
"Total elimination of all waste
anesthetic gas is the goal, and should be
attainable," Cohen said. "In the
meantime, we recommend that all
possible corrective measures be
initiated."
One such measure involves
installation of a "scavenging system" in
connection with anesthesia equipment.
The system, developed by Whitcher and
his associates, captures overflow gases
during normal administration of
anesthesia, and vents them out of the
operating room.
Stanford University Hospital was the
first to install this device, Whitcher
reported, and operating room
contamination has been reduced to
about 10 to 15 per cent of the
previously measured.
Further studies on these subjects
will be organized, according to Dr.
Whitcher, but no definite date can be
set for their completion. Studies must
take place on the national level, he said,
in order to "validate the study and get
a larger base number to work with."
Nurses and female anesthetists who
work daily in hospital operating rooms
contaminated with trace amounts of
anesthetics are exposed to a potentially
serious health hazard, a Stanford
University medical research team
warned today.
Chronic exposure of operating room
staffs to low-grade anesthetic pollution
may cause miscarriage in pregnant
women, the researchers reported.
Their study calls on hospitals to
initiate measures as rapidly as possible
to reduce this operating room
contamination.
