## 'Hashers' And 'Eaters' 
### 
the lagunita hashers ■

The recent attention given to
the Zimbardo prison experiment
has unfortunately overshadowed
an equally interesting and perhaps
more directly relevant experiment
now unuer way here at Stanford.
Take a group of normal, healthy
college freshmen, divide them
arbitrarily into 'hashers' and
'eaters,' establish Food Service
dining rooms, and the results are
devastating.
Such an experiment is
currently in progress in various
dining rooms across the Stanford
campus. According to the
experimenters, "when Stanford
students are exposed to the results
of this experiment it could well
prove to be the most significant

agent toward food service reform
yet on this campus."
The research project, labelled
" I m p I ications of the
Hasher—Eater Relationship," is
designed to help understand what
the eating experience does to the
hashers, the eaters and the power
establishment. The 'hashing'
group and the 'eating' group were
randomly picked from a sample of
frosh; the experiment began with
the first meal of the academic
year. What happened in the
ensuing week was crushing in its
implications. The group labelled
'hashers,' dressed in white and
yellow uniforms, under the
supervision of returning hashers
and the head hashers, became

perverted by the sense of power
they felt.
They taunted, hassled and
intimidated the eaters, often
making them wait long periods for
their food, refusing to procure
seconds, spilling drinks down the
eaters' backs, and deciding who
would get raspberry sherbert and
other 'privileges.'
The eaters were equally
affected by the experiment. Good
manners were rapidly phased out.
On the second day, there was a
food riot. In the best tradition of
a Hollywood-style pie throwing
contest, the eaters started
throwing paper napkins, potatoes,
and zucchini; screamed at the
hashers for seconds; and stormed

the Food Service Office in an
attempt to assert their hunger and
right to gracious service and
unlimited Sunday night steak.
This rebellion was put down by
a combination of hardened 4th
year hashers and psychological
tactics—the appearance of cheese
cake at a strategic moment. This
effectively ended major symptoms
of rebellion, although a few eaters
persisted. On the seventh day of
the experiment, one eater made a
last futile effort to assert his
problem, by refusing to eat. He is
presently being treated at Cowell
for the effects of overexposure to
Tresidder food.
In view of the fact that the
Food Service system is so
pervasive on the Stanford campus,
the study certainly has important
implications. Given that a normal
group of Stanford frosh can
rapidly be turned into hardened
eaters and hardened hashers, the
prospects for meaningful reform
in the system seem dim at the
present.
Other measures the
experimenters will probably
recommend will include
establishing 'meaningful'
eater-hasher relationships, making
more food available, training the
hashers in techniques of gracious
service, instilling fundamentals of
etiquette in the eaters, and
allowing one ritual food riot per
quarter. Until the experimenters
make their final report, however,
we offer this interim conclusion:
There's a little bit of eater and
hasher in everyone.

pervasive on the Stanford campus,
the study certainly has important
implications. Given that a normal
group of Stanford frosh can
rapidly be turned into hardened
eaters and hardened hashers, the
prospects for meaningful reform
in the system seem dim at the
present.
Other measures the
experimenters will probably
recommend will include
establishing 'meaningful'
eater-hasher relationships, making
more food available, training the
hashers in techniques of gracious
service, instilling fundamentals of
etiquette in the eaters, and
allowing one ritual food riot per
quarter. Until the experimenters
make their final report, however,
we offer this interim conclusion:
There's a little bit of eater and
hasher in everyone.
The Lagunita Hashers
the lagunita hashers ■

The recent attention given to
the Zimbardo prison experiment
has unfortunately overshadowed
an equally interesting and perhaps
more directly relevant experiment
now unuer way here at Stanford.
Take a group of normal, healthy
college freshmen, divide them
arbitrarily into 'hashers' and
'eaters,' establish Food Service
dining rooms, and the results are
devastating.
Such an experiment is
currently in progress in various
dining rooms across the Stanford
campus. According to the
experimenters, "when Stanford
students are exposed to the results
of this experiment it could well
prove to be the most significant

agent toward food service reform
yet on this campus."
The research project, labelled
" I m p I ications of the
Hasher—Eater Relationship," is
designed to help understand what
the eating experience does to the
hashers, the eaters and the power
establishment. The 'hashing'
group and the 'eating' group were
randomly picked from a sample of
frosh; the experiment began with
the first meal of the academic
year. What happened in the
ensuing week was crushing in its
implications. The group labelled
'hashers,' dressed in white and
yellow uniforms, under the
supervision of returning hashers
and the head hashers, became

perverted by the sense of power
they felt.
They taunted, hassled and
intimidated the eaters, often
making them wait long periods for
their food, refusing to procure
seconds, spilling drinks down the
eaters' backs, and deciding who
would get raspberry sherbert and
other 'privileges.'
The eaters were equally
affected by the experiment. Good
manners were rapidly phased out.
On the second day, there was a
food riot. In the best tradition of
a Hollywood-style pie throwing
contest, the eaters started
throwing paper napkins, potatoes,
and zucchini; screamed at the
hashers for seconds; and stormed

the Food Service Office in an
attempt to assert their hunger and
right to gracious service and
unlimited Sunday night steak.
This rebellion was put down by
a combination of hardened 4th
year hashers and psychological
tactics—the appearance of cheese
cake at a strategic moment. This
effectively ended major symptoms
of rebellion, although a few eaters
persisted. On the seventh day of
the experiment, one eater made a
last futile effort to assert his
problem, by refusing to eat. He is
presently being treated at Cowell
for the effects of overexposure to
Tresidder food.
In view of the fact that the
Food Service system is so
pervasive on the Stanford campus,
the study certainly has important
implications. Given that a normal
group of Stanford frosh can
rapidly be turned into hardened
eaters and hardened hashers, the
prospects for meaningful reform
