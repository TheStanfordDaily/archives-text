## Post-Mortem On Individualism

(Editor's Note: This column is
written in response to two
columns which previously
appeared in the Daily.)
The "demise of individualism,"
which has been noted by some
with chagrin, and by others with
exuberance, has evoked a
disturbing one-sided rhetoric that
seems to have characterized
Westerners' conceptions of and
attitudes toward the societies and
politics of Asia for a
discouragingly long time.
Mr. Gray asks whether the
Chinese Communist feat of
feeding 600-700 million hungry
people and cleaning the streets of
Shanghai (and Peking, Canton,
Nanking, Hankow,
Chungking . . .) "is . . . worth the
demise of individuality." Now a
demise pre-supposes viability or
an active presence at some earlier
point in time. But when in the
history of China have the
overwhelming majority of the
Chinese ever enjoyed the luxuries
of ''freedom" and
"individuality"? I'm not just
talking about the gross
exploitation and humiliation they
suffered at the hands of the
Western powers who thronged
greedily to China's Open Door;
and I'm not just talking about the
military conquest and occupation
to which the Imperial Japanese
Government subjected much of

China. Long before Chairman Mao
became quotable, the people of
China lived and starved within a
social system that was itself
exploitative, harsh—the
domination and rule of the
dis-united, powerless multitudes
by the shrewd and ruthless elite
who were able to manipulate to
their considerable advantage their
positions in relation to the central
government, as well as their
advantages as holders of property
and sufficient cash to loan money
at rates so usurious that virtual
serfdom was most often the
borrowers' ultimate lot. Freedom?
Individuality?
Mr. Feurtado critiques the
self-serving phoney humanism of
Euro-American neo-liberalism
very well, but when he states "the
demise of individualism is
necessary," he seems to mean the
demise of neo-liberalism disguised

as "individualism," as practiced
by Europeans and Americans. He
is calling for a change in Western
culture and society without seeing
Mr. Gray's fallacious presumption
of some pre-existing (i.e.,
pre-Mao) individualism in China.
But it is Mr. Gray's kind of
culture-bound assumption which
has fed the rhetoric of people
who've been industriously keeping
the world safe for democracy
during the past two decades.
Rather than enter another plea
for individualism, justice, or
freedom, I would like to ask those
who are prone to criticize that
which is strange to them—or
different—to look at the facts in
the other side's frame of reference
before slapping on a sloopy label
from Western civilization's
repertoire of idealistic verbiage.
