The official U.S. justification
for the death of hundreds of

democratic elections." What has
always been apparent to most
Vietnamese, and has become
apparent to most Americans, is
that Vietnam has been denied the
freedom to determine their own
future precisely because of U.S.
involvement in that country. The
record of elections in South
Vietnam since 1 95 4 attests to this
fact.
With the release of the
Pentagon Papers and from
Eisenhower's own Mandate for
Change, it is now well known that
the U.S. and Ngo Dinh Diem were
frightened by the prospect of free
country-wide elections to be held
in 1956 as stipulated by the
Geneva Accords. Eisenhower's
advisors were telling him that Ho
Chi Minh would have won those
elections with 8 0 percent of the
vote. Hence, it is no surprise that
the U.S. supported Diem in his
refusal to hold that election and
instead backed his South
Vietnamese referendum in
October of 1 955 in which Diem
conveniently "won" 98.2 percent
of the vote. U.S. State

with the U.S. backing the election
of Diem, no Viet Minh or
neutralist candidates weie
permitted to participate in this
referendu m.
In 1967, under the protection
of the U.S. military umbrella, the
Saigon government was again able
to prevent any neutralist or
Communist candidates from
participating in the elections.
Although the U.S.-backed
Thieu-Ky ticket embarassingly
received only one-third of the
vote, much ado was made in the
United States about the high
percentage of voter participation
in the 1 96 7 election. It was clear
to the Vietnamese, however, that
not to vote was inviting
harassment and possibly
imprisonment. Furthermore,
many Vietnamese were quick to
point out that ARVN soldiers
helped to raise the percentage

totals of voter participation as
they were in many cases given
ballots both at their home and at
their barracks. The additional
votes were most likely going to
Generals Thieu and Ky.
With this record of U.S.
manipulation, the cynicism of
Vietnamese in the face of this
year's elections is understandable.
Had the U.S. been really
concerned about political freedom
in South Vietnam they could have
withheld support from Thieu if he
insisted on running (sic) alone.
Nor would the U.S. have stated it
would not tolerate any coup
d'etat. With Thieu so firmly in
control of American military
power, U was news to no one that
he last week claimed a resounding
94 percent popular support for his
regime.
The redeeming aspect of the
political scene in Vietnam is that
the Vietnamese have
demonstrated by their continued
resistance to Thieu and the U.S.
that they are not fooled by
electoral games. They have come
to understand that elections are
not usually designed to choose the
virtuous or popular leader; rather
they are a system of
"legitimizing" the one who has
most effectively manipulated a
foreign electoral process and
exploited foreign military power
to his own advantage. For the
time being, they can only wait
and struggle for the day when the
U.S. military power is removed
from their country, giving them
finally the freedom they need to
shape their own future.

democratic elections." What has
always been apparent to most
Vietnamese, and has become
apparent to most Americans, is
that Vietnam has been denied the
freedom to determine their own
future precisely because of U.S.
involvement in that country. The
record of elections in South
Vietnam since 1 95 4 attests to this
fact.
With the release of the
Pentagon Papers and from
Eisenhower's own Mandate for
Change, it is now well known that
the U.S. and Ngo Dinh Diem were
frightened by the prospect of free
country-wide elections to be held
in 1956 as stipulated by the
Geneva Accords. Eisenhower's
advisors were telling him that Ho
Chi Minh would have won those
elections with 8 0 percent of the
vote. Hence, it is no surprise that
the U.S. supported Diem in his
refusal to hold that election and
instead backed his South
Vietnamese referendum in
October of 1 955 in which Diem
conveniently "won" 98.2 percent
of the vote. U.S. State

with the U.S. backing the election
of Diem, no Viet Minh or
neutralist candidates weie
permitted to participate in this
referendu m.
In 1967, under the protection
of the U.S. military umbrella, the
Saigon government was again able
to prevent any neutralist or
Communist candidates from
participating in the elections.
Although the U.S.-backed
Thieu-Ky ticket embarassingly
received only one-third of the
vote, much ado was made in the
United States about the high
percentage of voter participation
in the 1 96 7 election. It was clear
to the Vietnamese, however, that
not to vote was inviting
harassment and possibly
imprisonment. Furthermore,
many Vietnamese were quick to
point out that ARVN soldiers
helped to raise the percentage

totals of voter participation as
they were in many cases given
ballots both at their home and at
their barracks. The additional
votes were most likely going to
Generals Thieu and Ky.
With this record of U.S.
manipulation, the cynicism of
Vietnamese in the face of this
year's elections is understandable.
Had the U.S. been really
concerned about political freedom
in South Vietnam they could have
withheld support from Thieu if he
insisted on running (sic) alone.
Nor would the U.S. have stated it
would not tolerate any coup
d'etat. With Thieu so firmly in
control of American military
power, U was news to no one that
he last week claimed a resounding
94 percent popular support for his
regime.
The redeeming aspect of the
political scene in Vietnam is that
the Vietnamese have
demonstrated by their continued
resistance to Thieu and the U.S.
that they are not fooled by
electoral games. They have come
to understand that elections are
not usually designed to choose the
virtuous or popular leader; rather
they are a system of
"legitimizing" the one who has
most effectively manipulated a
foreign electoral process and
exploited foreign military power
to his own advantage. For the
time being, they can only wait
and struggle for the day when the
U.S. military power is removed
from their country, giving them
finally the freedom they need to
