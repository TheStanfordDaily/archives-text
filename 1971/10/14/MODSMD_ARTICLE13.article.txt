# Injuries Hurt Tribe, SC
## 
### 
Both Stanford and USC will
probably still be suffering from
injury problems when they face
each other in their crucial Pac-8
meeting this Saturday night in Los
Angeles. USC lost their league
opener to Oregon last weekend
and this game is a must win for
them if they are to stay in
contention behind the Indians
who have won both of their
league contests so far.
The biggest injury worry for
Stanford is middle linebacker Jeff
Siemon. Siemon suffered a
strained knee ligament in the
Washington game and his status

for this Saturday's game is still
uncertain. Coach John Ralston
also says that it is too early to tell
whether any of the three players
who missed the Washington
game -Eric Cross, Hillary
Schockley and Mike Simone—can
play.
The word from Los Angeles is
that USC tailback Lou Harris has
only about a "20%" chance of
playing Saturday. Starting
linebacker Charles Anthony, his
replacement John Papadakas, as
well as starting center Dave Brown
are also on the "doubtful" list.
Wide receiver Lynn Swann has
had some ankle problems, but he
will be able to play this weekend.
Yesterday the Indians held
their second straight workout
behind closed doors in Stanford
Stadium. Ralston said that
yesterday's workout was "not

much better than Tuesday's,"
which he had termed "lousy."
Looking towards Saturday,
Ralston said, "This is our biggest
game."
In this week's football polls,
Stanford is ranked 13th in UPI
and 15th in AP. Defensive guard
Larry Butler was named Pac-8
defensive player of the week for
his performance in the
Washington game.
Saturday's game is not yet a
sellout contrary to earlier reports
and tickets are still available in
LA. For those staying home, the
game will be broadcast via closed
circuit television into Maples
Pavilion beginning at 8 p.m.
Saturday. Tickets are $2.50 for
students and $3 and $4 for the
public.

Varsity football managers are
still needed for the rest of the
season. Interested students should
contact Bob Butler at 321-2300 x
4591.

KNEE PROBLEMS—Stanford's middle linebacker Jeff Siemon (92), who has been one of the main
reasons for the Indians' incredible defensive play, suffered a knee injury in the Washington game and his
status for Saturday's USC game is uncertain. John Ralston has called Siemon "the premier linebacker in
the country today."

which he had termed "lousy."
Looking towards Saturday,
Ralston said, "This is our biggest
game."
In this week's football polls,
Stanford is ranked 13th in UPI
and 15th in AP. Defensive guard
Larry Butler was named Pac-8
defensive player of the week for
his performance in the
Washington game.
Saturday's game is not yet a
sellout contrary to earlier reports
and tickets are still available in
LA. For those staying home, the
game will be broadcast via closed
circuit television into Maples
Pavilion beginning at 8 p.m.
Saturday. Tickets are $2.50 for
students and $3 and $4 for the
public.

KNEE PROBLEMS—Stanford's middle linebacker Jeff Siemon (92), who has been one of the main
reasons for the Indians' incredible defensive play, suffered a knee injury in the Washington game and his
status for Saturday's USC game is uncertain. John Ralston has called Siemon "the premier linebacker in
the country today."
Both Stanford and USC will
probably still be suffering from
injury problems when they face
each other in their crucial Pac-8
meeting this Saturday night in Los
Angeles. USC lost their league
opener to Oregon last weekend
and this game is a must win for
them if they are to stay in
contention behind the Indians
who have won both of their
league contests so far.
The biggest injury worry for
Stanford is middle linebacker Jeff
Siemon. Siemon suffered a
strained knee ligament in the
Washington game and his status

for this Saturday's game is still
uncertain. Coach John Ralston
also says that it is too early to tell
whether any of the three players
who missed the Washington
game -Eric Cross, Hillary
Schockley and Mike Simone—can
play.
The word from Los Angeles is
that USC tailback Lou Harris has
only about a "20%" chance of
playing Saturday. Starting
linebacker Charles Anthony, his
replacement John Papadakas, as
well as starting center Dave Brown
are also on the "doubtful" list.
Wide receiver Lynn Swann has
had some ankle problems, but he
will be able to play this weekend.
Yesterday the Indians held
their second straight workout
behind closed doors in Stanford
Stadium. Ralston said that
yesterday's workout was "not

much better than Tuesday's,"
which he had termed "lousy."
Looking towards Saturday,
Ralston said, "This is our biggest
game."
