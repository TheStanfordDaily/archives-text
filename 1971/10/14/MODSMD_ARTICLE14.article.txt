# Transportation Guide Out
## 
### BOB BACON 
An enlarged second edition of
Ride On!, the student-published
guide to public transportation in
the Bay Area, is now on sale for
75 cents per copy.
The 60-page pocket-sized
pamphlet describes routes and
schedules of trains, buses, and
ferries, and gives information on
surface connections to the three
major Bay Area airports.
In addition, it contains
information on long-distance bus
and train travel, travel agents,
oicycling, taxi and car-rental
services, and the BART (Bay Area
Rapid Transit) system slated to
begin service in the East Bay next
spring. It is illustrated and
contains a number of maps.
The first edition was published
in July and was primarily aimed
toward Stanford students. The
revision is intended for a more
general audience and will be sold
in bookstores throughout the Bay
Area.
First in the Nation
According to Lovelock, Ride
On!, is the first comprehensive
regional transportation guidebook
in the nation. Based on the sales
of the first edition, he is confident
that the booklet will become a
Bay Area best-seller.
With concerns for economy
and ecology motivating an
increased interest in means of
transport other than the private
car, he believes that the idea of
the guide booklet will catch on
elsewhere as well.
The booklet is a product of
SWOPSI (the Stanford Workshops

on Political and Social Issues).
Lovelock, a Business School
student from Devon, England, led
a SWOPSI course on public
transportation last winter. It was
there that the idea for Ride On!
first took shape.
Trade-In Policy
A unique "trade-in" policy will
permit purchasers of the original
edition to exchange their copy of
that pamphlet, plus 4 oc, for a
copy of the revised edition. This
exchange can be made only at the
SWOPSI office, 590-A Old Union.
Lovelock says the old copies
turned in will be recycled, and
notes that in providing for
trade-ins SWOPSI is "taking an
idea from the auto industry."
The second edition, released on
Monday, is being sold in all parts
of the Bay Area. On campus, it is
available at the Bookstore and the
Business School Lounge.
Mail orders may be directed to
SWOPSI but over-the-counter
sales, except for trade-ins, will not
be made at their office. Residence
hall associates will receive free
copies.
Lovelock describes the Bay
Area transportation system as
"possibly the most diversified in
the world" as well as one of the
most extensive in the United
States. "There are a few 'holes' in
the overall network, but claims
that it's totally impossible to get
around without a car simply
aren't true," he adds.
The booklet contains "almost
everything you need to know
about public transportation in the
Bay Area, including how to get

out of the Bay Area," the editor
notes.
A grant from the Dean of
Students' office initially launched
the project. However, the initial
edition netted a slight financial
loss. Lovelock is optimistic that
the second edition, with its wide

circulation, will break even or
perhaps make a profit for
SWOPSI.
Other students involved in the
production of the booklet were
Charles Lisle, Chris Hendrickson,
Keith Moxon, and SWOPSI
publication director David Turner.

the guide booklet will catch on
elsewhere as well.
The booklet is a product of
SWOPSI (the Stanford Workshops

on Political and Social Issues).
Lovelock, a Business School
student from Devon, England, led
a SWOPSI course on public
transportation last winter. It was
there that the idea for Ride On!
first took shape.
Trade-In Policy
A unique "trade-in" policy will
permit purchasers of the original
edition to exchange their copy of
that pamphlet, plus 4 oc, for a
copy of the revised edition. This
exchange can be made only at the
SWOPSI office, 590-A Old Union.
Lovelock says the old copies
turned in will be recycled, and
notes that in providing for
trade-ins SWOPSI is "taking an
idea from the auto industry."
The second edition, released on
Monday, is being sold in all parts
of the Bay Area. On campus, it is
available at the Bookstore and the
Business School Lounge.
Mail orders may be directed to
SWOPSI but over-the-counter
sales, except for trade-ins, will not
be made at their office. Residence
hall associates will receive free
copies.
Lovelock describes the Bay
Area transportation system as
"possibly the most diversified in
the world" as well as one of the
most extensive in the United
States. "There are a few 'holes' in
the overall network, but claims
that it's totally impossible to get
around without a car simply
aren't true," he adds.
The booklet contains "almost
everything you need to know
about public transportation in the
Bay Area, including how to get

out of the Bay Area," the editor
notes.
A grant from the Dean of
Students' office initially launched
the project. However, the initial
edition netted a slight financial
loss. Lovelock is optimistic that
the second edition, with its wide

circulation, will break even or
perhaps make a profit for
SWOPSI.
Other students involved in the
production of the booklet were
Charles Lisle, Chris Hendrickson,
Keith Moxon, and SWOPSI
publication director David Turner.
An enlarged second edition of
Ride On!, the student-published
guide to public transportation in
the Bay Area, is now on sale for
75 cents per copy.
The 60-page pocket-sized
pamphlet describes routes and
schedules of trains, buses, and
ferries, and gives information on
surface connections to the three
major Bay Area airports.
In addition, it contains
information on long-distance bus
and train travel, travel agents,
oicycling, taxi and car-rental
services, and the BART (Bay Area
Rapid Transit) system slated to
begin service in the East Bay next
spring. It is illustrated and
contains a number of maps.
The first edition was published
in July and was primarily aimed
toward Stanford students. The
revision is intended for a more
general audience and will be sold
in bookstores throughout the Bay
Area.
First in the Nation
According to Lovelock, Ride
On!, is the first comprehensive
regional transportation guidebook
in the nation. Based on the sales
of the first edition, he is confident
that the booklet will become a
Bay Area best-seller.
With concerns for economy
and ecology motivating an
increased interest in means of
transport other than the private
car, he believes that the idea of
the guide booklet will catch on
elsewhere as well.
