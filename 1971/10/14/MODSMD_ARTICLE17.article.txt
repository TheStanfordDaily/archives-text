# Children's Center Lacks Money

Commentary
On Mayfield Road sits a shabby old
school with a lot of well-worn play
equipment around it. It doesn't attract
much attention from most people, but
it's terribly important for the children
of Stanford workers, students and
faculty who use it.
The school is known as the
Children's Center of the Stanford
Community and the Little Kids' Place,
and the children say they love it. They
like to play, eat, and ride tricycles,
much more than answer questions from
adults, but parents express enthusiasm
about what the center does for both
them and their children.
"The kids get so much out of it,
even though they learn some wild
things," said Eddi Sneckner, a single
parent who works at Stanford. "They
are unafraid and sociable and learn
from one another. For her son, Joshua,
the center is a wonderful experience.
For herself, "the place is a salvation.
With the salaries Stanford pays, one
can't possibly eat, be clothed, and also
pay for a baby sitter," she said.
No Funds
"The University should take on the
responsibility of childcare for its
workers," she continued. Currently
Stanford provides no funds specifically
for support of the Children's Center.
Joanne Chace, a working faculty
wife, agrees that the University should
share in the responsibility for the
children's center, because of its
importance to the lives of children,
mothers, and society. At the center
"the discipline of the children grows
out of their relations with each other
and not from an idea the parent has,"
said Chace. She feels that child care
centers are "more than just a
convenience."
As a "real institution" the center
fulfills "my sense of what society
should look like rather than what it
does look like." It helps to end "the
segregation between people who work
and people at home, between young
people and old people, between school
and prisons and the community."
Parents Control
Chace and other parents emphasize
that the center is also a "real institution

in the community because the parents
control it, fund it, and work with the
staff on management, improvement,
hiring, and even janitorial work."
For Nora Bennett, the center's head
teacher, all the problems of the
program stem directly or indirectly
from lack of funds. The center needs
equipment, landscaping, and medical
services. Parents have to pay from
$52.50 to 92.50 a month, or 60 cents
an hour. Although these rates are
among the cheapest in the area, many
parents who need childcare most can't
afford it.
Makeshift Equipment
Because much of the makeshift play
equipment is dangerous, the staff of the
center has to think constantly about
the children's safety, rather than giving
their full attention to the children's
growth. Lack of funds forces full-time
working parents to spend what little
leisure time they have doing
administrative and janitorial work for
the center.
Bennett loves the Children's Center
as much as the children do, but she
feels it is not serving the needs of the
Stanford Community. She envisions a
complex of children's centers, provided
with full nutritional and medical
services, where all parents and children
of the community could afford to

come. Considering the support and help
the university has given the center so
far, this vision is not likely to become
reality in the near future.

JUICE TlMEâ€”This little girl waits patiently for her morning juice at the Stanford Children's Center. Although she may not
realize it the Center currently faces financial crisis, due partly to the University's unwillingness to support the Center, ine
Children's Center currently has room for thirty children, who must be the offspring of Stanford staff, faculty or students.
