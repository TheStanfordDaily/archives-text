## How To Fix A Leaky Faucet 
### 
Women aren't supposed to be
mechanical—instead, we're supposed to
collapse every time the washing
machine does. Once this calamity has
happened, presumably some man will
come along—provided we're helpless
enough—and put everything right, for
which, of course, we should be
properly grateful.
The reason that we can't fix things is
simply that we were never taught how.
In the interests of education, therefore,
we present How To Fix It.
Today's topic: How To Fix a
Leaking Faucet.

The only things you need to fix a
faucet are a wrench and a new washer
to replace the old one. You can buy
them at the hardware store.
The first step in fixing a faucet is to
turn off the water. Fancy sinks have a
little valve under the sink just below
the faucet, so you can turn off the
particular faucet you're working on and
leave everything else on. Otherwise,
you have to turn off the main valve
while you make the repair.
The way a faucet works is really
very simple. The screw at the top (1)
holds the handle (2) to the shaft (3).
The hexagonal cap (4) has anti-leak
packing inside it. The washer (5) holds
the packing in place. The big screw
threads (6) at the bottom of the shaft
are what turn the faucet on and off.
There is another washer (8) at the end
of the shaft which is held in place
between the metal cup (7) and the
screw (9). All of the shaft fits inside the
body of the faucet (10).
How To Do It
To fix a leaking faucet you first have
to take it apart. The way to do this is
to fit the wrench to the hexagonal cap
(4) and turn counter-clockwise. If you
don't want to scratch the chrome, put a
piece of adhesive tape around the cap
before you apply the wrench. To get
the cap all the way off you may have to
turn the handle of the faucet in teh on
direction. Once the cap is off, keep
turning the handle in the on direction
until you can lift the whole shaft out of
the faucet bodv.

Now turn the whole business upside
down. The washer (8) which is held in
place by a screw is what is worn out.
Unscrew the screw which holds the
washer in place. Now replace the
washer with a new one the same size as
the old one.
All you have to do now is put the
shaft back in the faucet body and screw
the hexagonal cap back on.

between the metal cup (7) and the
screw (9). All of the shaft fits inside the
body of the faucet (10).
How To Do It
To fix a leaking faucet you first have
to take it apart. The way to do this is
to fit the wrench to the hexagonal cap
(4) and turn counter-clockwise. If you
don't want to scratch the chrome, put a
piece of adhesive tape around the cap
before you apply the wrench. To get
the cap all the way off you may have to
turn the handle of the faucet in teh on
direction. Once the cap is off, keep
turning the handle in the on direction
until you can lift the whole shaft out of
the faucet bodv.

Now turn the whole business upside
down. The washer (8) which is held in
place by a screw is what is worn out.
Unscrew the screw which holds the
washer in place. Now replace the
washer with a new one the same size as
the old one.
All you have to do now is put the
shaft back in the faucet body and screw
the hexagonal cap back on.

Women aren't supposed to be
mechanical—instead, we're supposed to
collapse every time the washing
machine does. Once this calamity has
happened, presumably some man will
come along—provided we're helpless
enough—and put everything right, for
which, of course, we should be
properly grateful.
The reason that we can't fix things is
simply that we were never taught how.
In the interests of education, therefore,
we present How To Fix It.
Today's topic: How To Fix a
Leaking Faucet.

The only things you need to fix a
faucet are a wrench and a new washer
to replace the old one. You can buy
them at the hardware store.
The first step in fixing a faucet is to
turn off the water. Fancy sinks have a
little valve under the sink just below
the faucet, so you can turn off the
particular faucet you're working on and
leave everything else on. Otherwise,
you have to turn off the main valve
while you make the repair.
The way a faucet works is really
very simple. The screw at the top (1)
holds the handle (2) to the shaft (3).
The hexagonal cap (4) has anti-leak
packing inside it. The washer (5) holds
the packing in place. The big screw
threads (6) at the bottom of the shaft
are what turn the faucet on and off.
There is another washer (8) at the end
of the shaft which is held in place
between the metal cup (7) and the
screw (9). All of the shaft fits inside the
body of the faucet (10).
