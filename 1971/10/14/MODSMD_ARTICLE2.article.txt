# Three Witnesses Testify Franklin Singled Out For Lodge Incident
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
Three witnesses for Prof. H. Bruce
Franklin testified yesterday that the
Maoist professor was singled out of the
crowd "for no reason" during the
disruption of a speech by Henry Cabot
Lodge, Jan. 11.
Two of the witnesses told the
Advisory Board considering dismissal
charges against Franklin that they were
watching him and heard him make only
one comment during the incident.
James R. Newcomer, a political
science graduate student and former
foreign service officer, said he watched
Franklin during about a third of the
incident.
"I was a little surprised that you
didn't seem to be saying anything,"
Newcomer said. "I thought discretion
had got the better part of your valor."
He noted that Franklin was "aside
from that main group" that was
"clearly provoking the speaker."
Singled Out
He told Franklin he was surprised
that comments from the podium by
Hoover Institute official Berkeley
Tompkins "singled you out since his
remarks to you weren't based on what
happened."
And Newcomer said he was
"astounded" that the speech was
cancelled when the crowd could have
been handled with "some imagination."
Newcomer, a member of the
Committee of Concerned Asian
Scholars (CCAS), said the group
prepared leaflets with proposed
audience questions for Lodge about the
Vietnam War and U.S. "war criminals."
He testified that he learned of
Lodge's role as "someone in charge of a
major war effort" when Lodge was
Ambassador to South Vietnam and
Newcomer was a foreign service officer
in Taipei.
'Break Dignity'
He said "There was probably a
political necessity for students and
others to be rowdy" in order to break
through "that dignity which is
preserved" around Lodge.
Newcomer said he did not chant or
yell, but conceded, "I may have joined
in rhythmic applause at one time."
Newcomer, a scholar on China,
described a "lucid" analysis of Maoist
theory he once heard Franklin give. "I
can't say I liked him personally," he
explained. "But it seemed he was a
genius."
The crowd laughed and Franklin
bowed his head in embarrassment when
Newcomer applied the words of George
Bernard Shaw to the suspended
professor: "No one can iive with a
saint."
Under cross-examination by
administration lawyer Ray Fisher,
Newcomer said that during a discussion
before the Lodge speech, Venceremos
member Merle Rabine told him "there
may be some disruption" of the event.
(Franklin is a leader of the
revolutionary group Venceremos.)
Barkley Chanted
Graduate student Katherine Barkley,
who said her occupation is "trying to
stop the war," testified that she had
joined in clapping and chants to "really
challenge Lodge's right to lie on behalf
of (he American people."
The activist said about a third of the
crowd was heckling as a "political
statement." She charged those at the

podium taunted the crowd,
encouraging disruption. And she denied
the heckling was sufficient to call off
the speech.
Barkley said she has done full time
research opposing the war for two
years. She testified that she and Prof.
Hal Kahn wrote "The Grand
Inquisitor," an opinion column
published in the Daily the day of the
speech. She saui the column described
Lodge as "one of the main architects"
of U.S. Vietnam policy and urged
"confronting the real war criminals."
But she said that when she went to
White Plaza before the speech she "was
disturbed that nothing had been
planned" by activists to protest Lodge's
appearance.
Under Fisher's questioning, Barkley
said Franklin was "not a friend . .. but
he is a comrade."
Activists Met
Longtime campus radical Lenny
Siegel, who called himself "a candidate
for Dean of Engineering," said he and
about 15 other activists—not including
Franklin—met to plan publicity for a
demonstration against Lodge several
days before the speech.
Siegel said he did not expect Lodge's
speech to be cancelled by a
demonstration, but he added that he
had hoped the crowd "would
imprison" Lodge after the speech.
Siegel testified that he and Barkley
led the chanting on one side of the
room but were overpowered by another
anti-Lodge group across Dinkelspiel
Auditorium.
Franklin was smiling but not joining
in the heckling, according to Siegel,
who said he saw Franklin "ten or
fifteen times" during the incident.
Siegel said Franklin's restraint was
typical of his "political decision" not
to join in demonstrations. And Siegel
charged that both he and Franklin were
often falsely accused of being at
disruptions.
Straight-faced, Siegel added that he
was "incensed" and "hurt" that he was
not charged for participating in the
Lodge incident.
During the hearing, Fisher objected
several times that Franklin's questions
about Lodge's activities in Vietnam
were bringing the "Nuremberg
Principle" on war crimes into the
hearing. Fisher was overruled when
Franklin answered that he was asking
witnesses about Lodge to determine
their "state of mind" at the Lodge
incident.
Address Uproar
At another point, Fisher asked
Barkley's home address when she
testified that someone else in her house
first told her Lodge would be appearing
on campus.
Chairman Donald Kennedy ruled
Barkley was not required to give the
address after Franklin exploded, "The
world we live in is one where the secret
police are watching our homes every
day. It's a question of life or death for
our witnesses."
Pounding on the desk, Franklin
shouted that he and other
revolutionaries "know about the
relation between the administration
and the FBI."
When yesterday's session began,
Kennedy ruled against Franklin's
motion to limit the evidence being
considered in the case. He said such

limitations would be "extraordinary
departures" from customary hearing
procedures.
Franklin will call more witnesses
about the Lodge incident when the
hearing continues, today at 1 p.m. in
Physics 101.
