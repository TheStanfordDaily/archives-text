# WOMEN'S FORUM
## 
### 
The Daily Women's Forum grew
out of a need felt by many women
on the Stanford Campus to
communicate with each other and
with men. It is an open page: we
welcome any and all articles which
relate to issues concerning women.
The Forum will be published
with a minimum of editorial
guidance; there is certainly no
"line" which the page is pushing. In
fact, we would like to publish
articles which will arouse
controversy.
Pieces can take any form. We
would like factual articles,
opinions, fiction, personal
experiences, poems, graphics,
photographs, manifestos, or
anything else you feel like
submitting.
If you would like to contribute
something to the page, or if you
would like to work on editing or
creating the page, please (and if you
have never done journalism before,
but think it might be a good thing
to know how to do, don't hesitate!)
drop in at the Daily and leave your
name, or call us at extension 4632
and ask for Emma Price.

When people learn that I am
involved in the Women's Liberation
Movement, they generally ask
questions. Women usually ask them
because they want to know; men
because they want to catch me in a
logical contradiction and thereby prove
that the entire feminist movement is
worthless.

What is interesting is that in the last
two years, most of the questions have
been the same. They are valid questions
about the women's movement which
have to be answered. Many of them are
concerned with areas of the movement
which have been well-publicized by the
media.
I don't have the answers. I do have
opinions and personal solutions.
Why does the Women's Liberation
movement believe in burning bras?"
In the first place, I want to make an
historical point. The expression
"bra-burning" originated at the 1968
Women's Liberation demonstration at
the Miss America contest. A manifesto
was issued urging all women to destroy
the outward signs of their oppression
(such as bras, girdles, false eyelashes,
representative issues of Cosmopolitan,
and steno pads) by throwing them into
a giant Freedom Trash Can. The media
interpreted this as bra-burning and the
expression has plagued feminists ever
since.
Women's Liberation doesn't care
whether or not women wear bras. Some
women like them and some don't. On a
more theoretical level, I see the basic
argument against bras as being that
they take our beautiful natural bodies
and package them into a shape which is
approved for consumption.
What do Women's Liberationists think
of make-up?"
There are lost of feminists who wear
make-up and lots who never touch the
stuff.
Personally, I think it's fine to wear
make-up, but there are two things that
have to be considered. One is that some
companies are making an awful lot of
money by playing on our insecurities.
The other is that there are different
reasons to wear make-up, which are
usually hard to separate. Sometimes we
wear make-up in order to look nice and
feel good; sometimes we wear it
because we feel that without it we will
be denied masculine approval.
"It's so nice having doors opened for
you."
It is amazing how many women say
this to me. Since this is hardly the most
important aspect of the women's

movement, I think it's a silly thing to
get hung up about one way or the
other. •
I don't like having doors opened for
me. One reason is that it implies that I
am a weak little darling too frail to do
it myself. The second reason is that 1
see it as a terrible bargain. A man holds
a door for me, and in return I get paid
half the money he does for the same
job and/or keep house for him.
"I understand it in personal terms, but
why do you need a movement?"
One reason is that the personal
battle is so hard to fight. Since women
are brought up to judge themselves in
terms of men's opinions, it becomes
really difficult to risk losing masculine
approval. Personally, I often used to
think I was crazy because I couldn't
"adjust" to the woman's role. It was
therefore incredibly satisfying to get
together and talk to other women
about what we're all going through.
The second reason is that there are
very specific demands which the
women's movement is fighting for. We
need to get together as a political unit
to win equal educational opportunities,
equal job opportunities, equal pay for
the same job, removal of the inequities
of the law, free 24-hour child care, and
free abortion.

discussion of the whole question most
basic to the Women's Liberation
Movement—sex.)
