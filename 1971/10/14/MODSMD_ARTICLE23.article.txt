## Gay Manifesto 
### gay women's lib 
Gay Women's Liberation is a loose confederation of small groups whose
common demoninators are that we are female and gay or bisexual (translation: we
can feel love for other women) and we are oriented to Women's Liberation.
We first got together at a Gay Liberation symposium and quickly realized it
was just another male dominated movement, and could only stifle our needs. We
further felt that out presence would slow down any attempts the gay men were
making to raise their consciousnesses about male chauvinism.
Difference from Straights
Probably the only difference between our small groups and groups composed
of "straight" women is that we talk more about relationships between women,
whereas they talk more about relationships between men and women.
This poses a dilemma, since a major feminist tenet (one every woman can relate
to, regardless of her experience) is that sex not be the first priority in a
relationship—with man or woman.
Some gay women see other women as sex objects. Once a woman has identified
herself as gay, many straight women see her as a sex object: i.e. either they are
secretly fascinated or else they fear she will treat them as a sex object. This is an
understandable state of affairs, given that in our society the only legal (allowed)
relationships involving love and affection are marriage and blood. And we know
(are just beginning to find out) how little love, affection or trust is permitted or
possible in these relationships.
Exploitation
It is tempting to make a blanket statement that any sexual activity other than
masturbation leaves one open to exploitation situations. At this time, absolutely
no one in our society is healthy sexually. Even two women can easily fall into the
male/female roles we have begun to find so abhorrent. And yet it is not quite the
same, since any two women will be more able to communicate about, analyze,
and change their behavior-being peers in their common oppression—than any
man and woman. The operative word being change; that's what all this is about.
Additionally, the fact that these relationships are building up through small
group/affinity group interaction means that for the first time in herstory we are
able to explore our attitudes toward each other without secret fear or guilt. This
process is a necessary part of liberation for all women.
In any case, no woman should be close enough physically (in terms of inches
and feet) to experience sex vibrations with anyone who is not a comrade. One's
understanding of the word comrade being relative to the degree of enlightenment
of one's consciousness.
Erotic Games
If you think you are attracted to a woman, let her know. If you feel that
you're getting sex vibes from a woman, ask her. Don't automatically get into the
invisible courtship or invisible running away game. These games build erotic
tension; they were designed to do that.
All women play male/female games on each other, not just homosexual
women. By confronting them openly and nonpejoratively we will learn to
overcome them and will at the same time deepen our analysis of the entire male
oriented/dominated structure. Our ability to overcome the structure will only be
as developed as our analysis and the degree to which we no longer operate in those
terms.
As it stands now, our movement is only a couple of years old. Not all the
women have been heard from; not all our experiences have been pooled.
It is difficult to say what actions our group is performing, since the word
action is in the process of being redefined. Men have defined action for so long,
and we have been "passive" for so long. When the Roman males institutionalized
male dominance they were careful to define their words accordingly. We are still
buried under them.
