British Blast Irish Roads
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — British troops blasted
craters in back roads near the border of the Irish
Republic yesterday in an effort to cut arms
smuggling. The republic protested.
The blasting was intended to shut off arms
supplies to the Irish Republican Army which is
pressing its 50-year fight to detach Northern Ireland
from the United Kingdom. Security forces say most
of the gelignite used in Belfast and other Northern
cities originated in the republic.
Hundreds of troops were deployed in the blasting
operation. One was shot in the head and seriously
wounded by guerilla fire near the border town of
Rosslea in County Fermanagh.
The republic's prime minister, Jack Lynch, said in
a statement in Dublin the blastings are intended to
create "a physical barrier between the people of this
island."
He added: "In my opinion they will aggravate a
deteriorating situation."
The decision to blast roads was announced
Tuesday by Prime Minister Brian Faulkner after talks
with British authorities who have ultimate control of
his province's security.
Russia Ups Egyptian Aid
MOSCOW — The Soviet Union said last night it will
step up military aid to Egypt because of the
"dangerous situation" in the Middle East.
The Kremlin decision to "further strengthen the
military might of Egypt" despite the purge of
Moscow supporters in Cairo was announced in a joint

Soviet-Egyptian communique issued after a summit
meeting of the top Soviet leadership with Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat.
House Vote On War
WASHINGTON — In the face of strong antiwar
lobbying pressure, House opponents of a six-month
congressional deadline on U.S. military involvement
in Indochina were undecided yesterday whether to
risk a showdown vote next week.
Republican Whip Leslie C. Arends of Illinois said
he will decide over the weekend whether to clear the
way for a House vote on the Senate's specific
six-month deadline.
House Armed Services Chairman F. Edward
Hebert, D-La., announced the House action on a
$21-billion weapons procurement bill containing the
war halt amendment will come next Tuesday.
Asked if he thinks the House would again reject a
date-certain war halt as it always has before, Hebert
replied "I don't know" but indicated he believed it
would.
The question Tuesday will be on sending the bill
to a House-Senate compromise conference.
Republicans control the one motion on whether to
instruct conferees to accept the six-month war date
or instruct them on a different subject entirely.
My Lai Hearing Continues
FT. MEAD Md. — Col. Oran K. Henderson's
court-martial was informed yesterday that the colonel
once offered to take full responsibility for a
"command inquiry" he instituted into the My Lai

raid and for a finding that "irresponsible acts of
killing non-combatants did not occur."
Henderson's offer came in a letter he wrote to
Gen. William C. Westmoreland, the Army chief of
staff, on Dec. 10, 1969, just after the start of the
Pentagon inquiry into the My Lai affair.
The 51 year-old career officer told Westmoreland
he was making the offer "in the interest of
strengthening the American people's confidence in its
Army and to halt a growing disenchantment within
the Army officer corps."
Henderson said outside the courtroom that he
received a reply from Westmoreland stating "basically
thanks but no thanks."
Police Threaten Suit
SAN JOSE — The San Jose Peace Officers Association
demanded yesterday that the City Council rescind its
censure of Police Chief Robert B. Murphy and
threatened a law suit if it doesn't.
The seven-member council voted unanimously
early Wednesday to censure Murphy for his
statements following the Sept. 19 fatal shooting of a
research chemist by a policeman.
Phillip Norton, president of the Peace Officers
Association, told a news conference that the city
charter prevents the council from interfering in
administrative matters. He said the association feels
that censure is a "disciplinary matter" to be handled
by the dty manager.
Norton said the association gave the council until
noon Thursday to rescind the action. If it doesn't
comply, he said, the association will go to court to
seek a writ to force withdrawal of the censure.
