# Army Using Giant Bomb In Vietnam

A giant bomb capable of destroying
an area of 770 acres is in use in
Vietnam, University of Montana
zoology professor Bert Pfeiffer claimed
Tuesday.
Pfeiffer, here to attend a seminar of
the Bio-Medical Group, said the
existence of the bomb has never been
acknowledged by the Defense
Department for fear of "adverse public
reaction."
"This bomb (the BLUA2 B) is the
closest thing to nuclear weapons yet,"
declared Pfeiffer, who saw it knock off
the whole top of a mountain while he
was in Vietnam this August. The
weapon, also known as the "Command
Vault" bomb, is used primarily to start
landslides and create instant helicopter
landing pads, but can see action as an
anti-personnel weapon.
The professor also revealed that
massive plowing under of forests is
taking place at the rate of 1000 acres
per day. Immense bulldozers capable of
splitting and knocking down the largest
trees in Vietnam, along with the use of
stepped-up B-52 bombing raids on
forests, are "creating conditions that
are going to make agriculture
impossible," Pfeiffer predicted.

He maintained that there is evidence
that early U.S. defoliation raids in
Cambodia were carried out by the
privately owned, CIA-controlled airline,
"Air America." According to Pfeiffer,
chemical defoliation has stopped
primarily because of the agitations of
the American scientific community.
The zoologist also made an acrid
condemnation of Vietnamization.
Pfeiffer noted, "The only difference is
that the corpses are mostly brown. The
policy of Vietnamization is racist and
immoral."
The war, he added, "is not winding
down," and he feels that President
Nixon's Vietnamization policy has
obscured the continued high intensity
of the fighting.
At a seminar discussion at Ecology
House Tuesday night, Pfeiffer also
questioned the effectiveness of the
ecology movement. "A lot of the
ecological movement has been a
diversionary tactic by the government,"
he noted.
"There was something funny about
Earth Day," suggested Pfeiffer, who
expressed wonder over where money
for the events came from.
Pfeiffer, was accompanied by his
wife, who is also active in the ecology
movement.
