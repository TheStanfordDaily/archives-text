# Professor Envisions 'Emeritus University'

### GLENN GARVIN 
So you're 55. You've retired. Your
children are long gone. What do you
do?
Well, you could go back to school
Humanities Professor Jeffrey Smith
hopes to make that possible sometime
within the next two years.
His plan: Emeritus University, a new
institution of higher education for
anyone between the ages of 55 and 69.
"I want to be a part of life," says
Smith, who is 64 himself and will reach
mandatory University retirement age
next year. And bv opening Emeritus,
he hopes to realize that goal for himself
and others moving into the twilight
years.
The university, still in the pre-natal
stage, would be located in the Bay Area
somewhere and funded through grants
from individuals, foundations, and,
hopefully, some government agencies.
Smith figures it will take some $3
million to get the insitution off the
ground.
Faculty of Retired Professors
The faculty would consist primarily
of professors like Smith who have been
retired gy their schools but who are
"interested in breaking new ground."
Smith doesn't envision "students" as
such, but rather "fellows" who would
"not only study but play some role in
the teaching program—offering courses,
co-leading seminars, directing individual
projects or various creative activities."
The university would offer neither
grades nor degrees, concentrating on

giving "fellows" some idea of what they
may do with their life now that the
working years are over. No one would
maintain residence on campus for more
than three years, after which they
would take their knowledge out into
retirement communities and try to help
others.
Smith believes that retirees are
potentially better students because
they are "relieved of the heavy
demands of making a living and raising
a family" which directly or indirectly
pose a challenge to younger men.
He adds: "If the old are to have a
place in life, they must create it."
