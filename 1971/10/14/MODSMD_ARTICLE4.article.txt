# Holman To Leave Medicine Dept. Post
## 
### BOB LITTERMAN 
Dr. Halsted R. Holman, outspoken
chairman of the department of
medicine, announced yesterday that his
resignation, offered last week, had been
accepted by the new Medical School
Dean, Clayton Rich.
Holman, who has acted as chairman
since 1960, has been critical of
numerous University policies, including
the handling of last year's hospital sit-in
confrontation. He said he had offered
his resignation because he felt it was
the "appropriate thing to do, because
fundamentally I consider it quite right
that he should have the opportunity to
select his chairmen. I think his
acceptance was entirely appropriate.
"On the other hand, I would have
preferred an opportunity to talk to him
about the issues, or to have him talk to
members of the department about the
issues before the decision was
complete," said Holman. "So that I
would say I was disappointed in the
manner whereby it was done."
Rich, when contacted, explained
that he could not understand why
Holman would feel that way. "It's
possible to decide from the emphasis
he's given to the department what kind
of philosophy he has. I have talked to
many of the people in the department,
and through my background in schools
of medicine, know something about
this department.
"Hal has built a good department
according to his point of view and
philosophy, but after that amount of
time there is real merit in a change of
leadership. I think what we need now is
a change in emphasis from research to a
larger balance on patient care and use
of community medical
facilities. . .What we need is a changed
emphasis and different focus."
Rich said that he had accepted all
three of the resignations he had
received when he became dean.
However, when asked about a rumored
fourth resignation he said, "If there was
another resignation then I forgot about
it. That would be four, and I didn't
accept that one."
Holman, in his letter of resignation,

made three main points. "Let me first
repeat in writing my personal pleasure,
and that of the department, at your
acceptance of the position as Dean. . .
Second, I believe that a new Dean
should have the opportunity to select
chairmen of his choice. Though I
realize that chairmanship appointments
are on an annual basis I wish to offer
you my resignation should it suit your
purposes. Third, should you choose not
to accept the resignation, I wish to
offer the Department of Medicine as
one of the first departments to be
reviewed by a visiting committee as you
have proposed to the Executive
Committee."
The letter went on to detail the
activities of the department, its
problems, and ideas for its future. It
ended with another invitation for Rich
to meet with the department, its
executive committee, and Holman
alone "at your earliest convenience."
In responding, Rich wrote, "I do
wish to say that I appreciate the high
integrity behind this offer, and that I
am aware of the many excellent
strengths in your Department. I have
spent a great deal of time considering
this matter, and conclude that it very
much is in the long range interest of the
School to have rotation of executive
leadership after so long a period under
one chairman."
Holman, the Guggenheim Professor
of Medicine, has been particularly
critical of the handling of the April 9
Hospital sit-in calling the
administration actions "in my opinion
unreasonable and unprincipled."
He stressed, however, that he has
never felt his differences with the
administration to reflect themselves "in
any difficulty in my administrative
work," nor in the acceptance of his
resignation.
"I'm pleased with the opportunity
to stop administering so much, and be
able to do more teaching, care of
patients, and research. . .I'm in general
agreement with Dr. Rich on rotation
and review procedures. I stress that the
determining factor is that you keep the
momentum in these complex
organizations."
