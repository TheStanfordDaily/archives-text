# 4 Plead No Contest In Sit-In Case
## 
### 
Four persons, arrested for their
alleged participation in the April 8-9
sit-in at the Stanford Hospital, pleaded
no contest to one count of felony
battery, Tuesday, in San Jose Superior
Court.
The four, which includes Black
Students Union Chairman Willie
Newberry, were originally charged with
at least one felony each, and all were
charged with nine misdemeanors.
Charges were reduced to the one felony
count as a result of long plea
negotiations which have been taking
place since summer.
The four are scheduled to appear in
San Jose Superior Court November 18,
for sentencing.

Jean Dolly, who originally was one
of the persons in the group, faces only
the 9 misdemeanors after the charge of
felony battery against her was dropped.
Fired Hospital worker Anthony
Chatman, however, pleaded guilty to
two misdemeanor charges of
trespassing, and one charge of
possession of a weapon pending the
outcome of a lie detector test.
Chatman was originally charged with
two counts of felony assault on a police
officer, and possession of a weapon.
Jean Dolly now joins the 18 other
persons facing nine misdemeanor
charges also resulting from the Hospital
confrontation. This group will make its
next court appearance October 20, in

Palo Alto.
Among the 1 9 persons are the other
University workers fired June 21, on
the grounds of "unaeeeptable
behavior" for their alleged participation
in the sit-in. Three students—Molly
Dougherty, Phil Lind, and Katherine
Kurtz—and Asst. Prof, of German John
Flores are also in the group.
A total of 31 persons have been
arrested in connection with the sit-in:
they face a total of more than 24 0
charges. About 5 0 persons, including
13 of the 170 policemen and sheriff's
deputies called to the scene, were
injured, and damage to the hospital
corridor where the melee broke out was
estimated at $100,000.
