## 'Beyond Freedom & Dignity' 
### Bill Evers 
Editor's Note: This is the first
in a series of articles reviewing
Beyond Freedom and Dignity.
This article introduces
behaviorism. Later articles will
treat the problem of free will, the
question of what people find
reinforcing, and whether problems
now viewed as arising from human
freedom and values will arise in
Skinner's proposed Utopia.
B.F. Skinner, Beyond Freedom &
Dignity (New York: Alfred A.
Knopf, 1971), $6.95.
Exeerpts from Harvard
psychology professor B.F.
Skinner's new book constituted
the entire contents of the August
issue of Psychology Today. The
book was the subject of a Time
magazine cover story on
September 20. News articles on it
have appeared in the New York
Times and the Christian Science
Monitor.
Beyond Freedom & Dignity is a
continuation of a project of
Skinner's that began in his two
earlier books aimed at the
layman—Science and Human
Behavior and Walden Two. He is
expounding and popularizing the
psychological theory of
behaviorism. As a theory, it must
claim to offer an explanation. As
a theory claiming scientific status,
"an actual and necessary
connection" must be shown
between events "by inference and
actual experience or experiment,"
as John Gasson points out in his
essay, "The Concept of 'Theory'
in Science and in Psychology."
Skinner's books and
behaviorism in general have a
history of provoking gut
reactions, attributions of
diabolical intentions, intuitive
perceptions of ugliness, or a
repugnance based in someone's
personal morality. While these
reactions are understandable, they
do not affect the validity or
invalidity of what Skinner has to
say. As Bruce Goldberg put it, in
reviewing Walden Two for the
New Individualist Review in
1964:
"That a statement or a theory
is true or false is a matter which
is, presumably, to be decided by
the employment of the various
cannons of scientific (in the
widest sense of that term)
observation and inference. A
theory, for example, is tested by
its ability to explain the facts on
the basis of which it was
introduced, and also by its ability
to explain new facts which were
not explicitly taken into account
in its construction.
"And there are considerations
irrelevant in determining the

acceptability of putative truths.
One obviously irrelevant factor is
the aesthetic satisfaction anyone
might get from contemplating a
given theory. Whatever the poet
may have thought, beauty is not
the same as truth.
"Less obvious, and perhaps
worth mentioning for that reason,
is that the moral consequences of

a statement are not relevant
determinants of its truth or
falsity. It may be that the general
acceptance of some statement
would lead to universal misery.
Conceivably this could be a reason
for keeping the statement secret.
It could not be a reason for
concluding that it was false. All
men are mortal, whatever Angst
might be occasioned by
recognition of the fact."
Behaviorism views human
actions in terms of "functional
analysis." In his 1953 book,
Science and Human Behavior,
Skinner writes: "The external
values of which behavior is a
function provide for what may be
called a causal or functional
analysis. We undertake to predict
and control the behavior of the
individual organism. This is our
'dependent variable'—the effect of
which we are to Find the cause.
Our 'independent variable'—the
causes of behavior—are the
external conditions of which
behavior is a function. Relations

between the two—the
'cause-and-effect relationships' in
behavior—are the laws of a
science."
Reading Beyond Freedom &
Dignity, we find Skinner making
the same contention: "As a
science of behavior adopts the
strategy of physics and biology,
the autonomous agent to which

behavior has traditionally been
attributed is replaced by the
environment—the environment in
which the species evolved and in
which the behavior of the
individual is shaped and
maintained" (p. 184). And again,
"There are many varieties of
'behavior modification' and many
different formulations, but they
all agree on the essential point:
behavior can be changed by
changing tne conditions of which
it is a function" (p. 150).
Method & Metaphysics
Before we can proceed further,
we mu§t distinguish at this point
between methodological
behaviorism and metaphysical
behaviorism. (Metaphysics is the
division of philosophy that deals
with the ultimate nature of things.
It considers the question: What is
the world of things we know?)
Mortimer Adler outlines this
distinction in The Difference of
Man and the Difference It Makes:
"Metaphysical behaviorism ... is
simply one form of materialism: it

consists in denying the existence
of anything immaterial, and in
asserting that whatever exists or
occurs is identical with .. . the
existence of bodies and the
occurrence of their actions and
interactions. In contrast,
methodological behaviorism,
understood most generally,
applies to our knowledge of inert
bodies and our knowledge of
plants as well as to our knowledge
of animals and men. It is a general
principle of method that governs
inferences from objectively
observed behavior in the form of
actions or interactions to the
existence of such unobserved
properties as powers, habits, or
dispositions, none of which can be
externally observed."
Behaviorism in psychology
holds that it is necessary to
assume the truth of metaphysical
behaviorism in order to have a
scientific psychology, that
methodological behaviorism is
inseparable from metaphysical
behaviorism.
But metaphysical behaviorism
(i.e., materialism) as a
philosophical position does not
survive close scrutiny. While it is
correct to say that consciousness
depends on material reality and
cannot exist separated from it,
this is not to say that they are the
same thing. Consciousness, ideas,
and choices are natural facts of
reality. As Murray Roth bard puts
it in his essay, "The Mantle of
Science," "each human being
knows universally from
introspection that he chooses. The
positivists and behaviorists may
scoff at introspection all they
wish, but it remains true that the
introspective knowledge of a
conscious man that he is
conscious and acts is a fact of
reality."
