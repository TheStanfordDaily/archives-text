Falk Message
To the Stanford Community:
Only my own legal
involvement in the grand jury
hearings investigating Pentagon
Papers prevents my presence at
this time at Stanford to support
Professor Bruce Franklin's
contention that "the under logic"
of Nuremberg is relevant to a
citizen's duties to oppose the
Vietnam War. As citizens we have
a special obligation to oppose the
commission of war crimes by our
government.
Professor Franklin's case is the
most important academic freedom
case in the country and its
outcome will establish a
nationwide pattern, Nothing less
than the rights of a faculty
member to act politically out of
conscience and conviction is at
stake. Professor Franklin's case
deserves national attention and
the widest possible support.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Perhaps new members of the
Stanford Community experienced
difficulty in making any sense out
of Mr. Schwartz's reply (Daily
10/13/71) to Doug McHenry's
article on the Stanford Judicial
Council. A definition of terms will
quickly remedy the problem:
(1) "John Schwartz":
Chief University Stanford
Judicial Council Prosecutor; A
principal advisor on the "when

should we call the police"
question, e.g. Computer Center;
Medical Center.
(2)" Administration willingness
and anxiousness to pursue
reforms":
Last year Mr. Schwartz walked
out of a Committee of Fifteen
meeting to break the quorum and
thereby PREVENT the passage of
a measure designed to stop the
faculty dominated SJC from
embarking on a rule making
enterprise unauthorized by the
charter. (This information comes
from two members of the
Committee.
With these definitions in mind,
I think Mr. Schwartz's article
makes a great deal of sense.
Finally, Mr. Schwartz's
contention that faculty and
students are members of the same
peer group is extremely
interesting. We should, therefore,
expect the administration to make
the same concerted effort to put
students on the University
Advisory Committee that it is
making to keep faculty on the
SJC.
Always glad to be of service
