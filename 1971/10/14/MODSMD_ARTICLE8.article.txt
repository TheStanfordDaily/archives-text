## We Are Not A Bunch Of Ducks

In the news analysis of the
Franklin case published in
Monday's Daily, Mr. Liebert
stated "Franklin has asked
supporters to march from a noon
rally to watch the opening of his
case." Though probably
unintentional, this is incorrect and
feeds the kind of bourgeois view
Stanford's administration is taking
in its persecution of Bruce
Franklin.
Members of the anti-imperialist
movement, other than Bruce,
called the rally to show their
support, and their resistance to
this latest of attacks on the
movement. The administration's
case rests on the notion that the
movement is a bunch of mindless
idiots who can be hoodwinked
into doing whatever some
charismatic figure suggests.
It's not unusual for this view to
be taken by the administration,
where Lie-man, representing the
Trustees, has the brute force to
back up his decisions and ideas.
But Bruce Franklin does not have
the power of the police or the
power of taking away people's
jobs at his disposal.
The bourgeois press would
have people think that the cause
of Stanford's movement is the
utterances of one man. In the
same way, the press tries to
distort the revolutionary struggle
of the inmates at Attica, stating
that outside propaganda is the
cause. In both cases ignoring the
fact that the people who took
action were consciously
participating in a struggle against
the system which they understand

to be imperialist. Whether they
learned this from directly
experiencing its oppression; or
through study and participation in
the movement.
It must be made clear that the
first cause of movements such as
last year's is the continuing
imperialist war in Indochina and
Stanford's chronic complicity in
that genocidal war. Secondly, that
people understand what's
happening and see the necessity to
act. Given the above they
will direct their energies to the
here and now: Stanford
University.
It's not that we, as members of
the movement, are a bunch of
"ducks who follow when Bruce
goes quack quack." We are
intelligent enough to see what
reality is and want to change it.
We open our eyes to the brutal
murder of our Vietnamese
brothers and sisters and move to
join in their struggle in the most
effective way possible. Bruce
among others helped open our
eyes.
I'm not claiming that the
movement has no leadership. It
must. Certain people emerge as
leaders of a mass movement
because they offer a correct
analysis of the situation and
manage to sum up the ideas of the
people who are committed to
action. Leadership which does not
do this is rejected. I eaders emerge
who are not afraid to expose the
true nature of the university and
the role it plays in U.S.
Imperialism.
Bruce Franklin is a leader in
that he has played an important
role in opening our eyes to the
realities of the struggles of
oppressed people against
imperialism, and the role the
Stanford Empire plays in
oppressing people at home and
throughout the world.
This is where Bruce is a danger
to the men who own this

university, and the fact that he
teaches us reality is the
administration's real charge
against him. I would say that they
have a big job ahead of them; a lot
of people to fire, expel and ban
from campus, before Stanford
University will be a place where
reality and truth are never allowed
to creep in.

Stanford will be unsuccessful
in its purge, because there are too
many of us who will not allow
this to happen. Mao says in
People's War, "What is a true
bastion of iron? It is the masses,
the millions upon millions of
people who genuinely support the
revolution. That is the real iron
bastion which it is impossible . . .

for any force on earth to smash."
We are using the methods of
people's war, organizing and
mobilizing people so that the
movement is a force which is
impossible to repress by the
administration's attacks on a few
leaders.

In the news analysis of the
Franklin case published in
Monday's Daily, Mr. Liebert
stated "Franklin has asked
supporters to march from a noon
rally to watch the opening of his
case." Though probably
unintentional, this is incorrect and
feeds the kind of bourgeois view
Stanford's administration is taking
in its persecution of Bruce
Franklin.
Members of the anti-imperialist
movement, other than Bruce,
called the rally to show their
support, and their resistance to
this latest of attacks on the
movement. The administration's
case rests on the notion that the
movement is a bunch of mindless
idiots who can be hoodwinked
into doing whatever some
charismatic figure suggests.
It's not unusual for this view to
be taken by the administration,
where Lie-man, representing the
Trustees, has the brute force to
back up his decisions and ideas.
But Bruce Franklin does not have
the power of the police or the
power of taking away people's
jobs at his disposal.
The bourgeois press would
have people think that the cause
of Stanford's movement is the
utterances of one man. In the
same way, the press tries to
distort the revolutionary struggle
of the inmates at Attica, stating
that outside propaganda is the
cause. In both cases ignoring the
fact that the people who took
action were consciously
participating in a struggle against
the system which they understand

to be imperialist. Whether they
learned this from directly
experiencing its oppression; or
through study and participation in
the movement.
It must be made clear that the
first cause of movements such as
last year's is the continuing
imperialist war in Indochina and
Stanford's chronic complicity in
that genocidal war. Secondly, that
people understand what's
happening and see the necessity to
act. Given the above they
will direct their energies to the
here and now: Stanford
University.
It's not that we, as members of
the movement, are a bunch of
"ducks who follow when Bruce
goes quack quack." We are
intelligent enough to see what
reality is and want to change it.
We open our eyes to the brutal
murder of our Vietnamese
brothers and sisters and move to
join in their struggle in the most
effective way possible. Bruce
among others helped open our
eyes.
I'm not claiming that the
movement has no leadership. It
must. Certain people emerge as
leaders of a mass movement
because they offer a correct
analysis of the situation and
manage to sum up the ideas of the
people who are committed to
action. Leadership which does not
do this is rejected. I eaders emerge
who are not afraid to expose the
true nature of the university and
the role it plays in U.S.
Imperialism.
Bruce Franklin is a leader in
that he has played an important
role in opening our eyes to the
realities of the struggles of
oppressed people against
imperialism, and the role the
Stanford Empire plays in
oppressing people at home and
throughout the world.
This is where Bruce is a danger
to the men who own this

university, and the fact that he
teaches us reality is the
administration's real charge
against him. I would say that they
have a big job ahead of them; a lot
of people to fire, expel and ban
