Rich Correction
Editor, THE DAILY:
I wish to make three points in
which the meaning I intended in
my address to the School of
Medicine is different from what
appeared in your article of
TTiursday, October 7 th, describing
this address.
I suggested that we should use
evidence of scholarship in fields
such as methods of delivery of
health care and medical education
as criteria for academic
advancement as well as continued
use of criteria based on evidence
of accomplishment in biomedical
and clinical research. Thus,
research contributions to such
important aspects of academic
medicine as methods of delivery
of health services and methods of
medical education could be given
appropriate weight, along with a
continued major emphasis on
research programs in biomedical
research.
My remarks about anatomy
and physiology were not meant to
suggest deficient quality but
rather that the facilities were
outmoded and too far separated
from the rest of the Medical
School. I consider that the faculty
in these departments are doing an
outstanding job under adverse
circumstances. Although I
congratulate them on their

dedication and performance, I do
feel that it is extremely important
that appropriate new facilities be
made available for these
important departments.
I did indicate that we should
have an increase in class size from
76 now to somewhat less than
100. Neither our facilities nor the
number of faculty would support
a program involving 150 students
per class unless there were a
drastic reduction in the quality of
the educational program, which 1
could in no way support.

News Judgment
Editor, THE DAILY:
It is puzzling why you gave no
coverage Tuesday or yesterday to
the hearing for the Hospital
Brothers which took place
Tuesday in San Jose (see the Real
News Oct. 11)— all the more
curious in the light of the
extensive coverage you are giving
the Franklin case.
One suspects the Daily is
following the wishes of the
University; Stanford has a very
successful tactic of letting strong
opponents have a "fair" hearing
(with maximum publicity) while
quietly attempting to eliminate
other protestors with a mass of
trumped-up felony charges. I am
reminded of events two years
ago—the University's "toleration"
and "wisdom" was much
publicized during the morally
invulnerable AEL sit-in, but the
legal action brought after the
subsequent Encina sit-in was
quietly brutal.

The tactic is quite effective:
the public gets the idea that
Stanford is eminently fair, while
the protesting students are
supposed to get the other
message—think twice about acting
when you discover what happened
to your brothers. This tactic has
successfully subdued organized
protest in the past (though it has
also led to frustration and
anonymous protest—trashing
windows, etc.)
The issues raised in the
Franklin case are extremely
important; the coverage the Daily
has given the case is certainly
justified. (As just one reason:
since the government and the
media would have considered an
un-interrupted speech by Lodge
an example of "waning campus
opposition to the war," Franklin
and others opposed to the war
had no choice but to register their
feelings about Lodge's activities in
the terms the media had set up.)
But in considering the Daily's
lack of coverage of the hearings in
San Jose, one must bear in mind
that Bruce Franklin, at the worst,
might lose his job (and would
probably be immediately rehired
by another school wishing to
enhance its "broad-minded"
image—even Tom Hayden is now
teaching at a college in L.A.).
I grant, of course, that the case
must be considered as a matter of
principle. But the strategies
institutions like Stanford have for
dealing with protest are most
often couched in human terms,
and in human terms there is no
comparison between what
Stanford could do to Bruce
Franklin and what a long prison
sentence means for a black
student (San Quentin gives no
preferential treatment to past
students when they are black). I
applaud people who support (in
print and financially) the Franklin
defense, but I also wish people
would support a defense against
the terrorist tactics practiced by
the University and this county.
(Hugh Gladwin is doing post
doctoral research in
an thropology.)
(The lack of coverage of the San
Jose hearing in yesterday's paper
was due to an oversight on the
Daily's part, not due to a lack of
concern for this particular issue.
An article on the outcome of the
hearing appears today.—Ed.)
