FITTERS!
When it comes to boots, all skiers know what
"fitters" are. Fitters are never squeezers, pinchers,
or crushers, Fitters are fitters.
Short Swing guarantees the Trappeur Grand Prix,
pictured above, to be a fitter, why? Becuase each
G.P. is custom fit to your foot by a unique new
injection — foam process. Snug, not too tight, and
with no pinch, cut, or crush. Outer features include
5 adjustable buckles, torsion proof sole, and Deep
Blue plastic bonded to nylon shell. Men's and
Ladies' sizes. Another feature — its great economy
price
