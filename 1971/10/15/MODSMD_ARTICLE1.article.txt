# Band Brings 'Music To The People'
## 
### 
Those students who attended the
Stanford-Duke game may have asked
themselves, "Who were those costumed
clowns playing around on the field
before and after the Stanford Band's
halftime show?" It seems they were the
football team, but they've managed to
change their image since that game.
Fortunately for Saturday afternoon
spectators, one group of football gamp
entertainers hasn't changed its goofy
ii.iago, and looks like it isn't about to
for years to come—the Incomparable
Leland Stanford Junior University
Marching Band.
Anyone who has observed the Band
marching backwards on the field and in
the Rose Parade, or has seen their
"scramble technique" (it looks like
chaos, but everyone seems to know
where he is going), knows that they
certainly are a goofy bunch. They are
unpredictable as well-rumor has it that
a red and white skydiver may drop
onto the 50-yard line at the Big Game.
The Band Shack, home of the
LSJUMB, is one of the campus' most
little known, yet most amazing
monuments. Inside, one can find a
veritable treasure trove of signs taken
from highways, bars, airports, and the
University of California at Berkeley.
Frustrated Libidos
During Monday night rehearsals,
obscenities often punctuate the musical
score. After rehearsal, a group of
Bandsmen known as SMUT (Stanford
Marching Unit Thinkers) comes
together to plan the marching

formations for that week's game.
Once planned, the formations are
practiced Wednesday and Friday
afternoons. The actual marching show
on Saturday often deviates from the
practice.
Drum Major Bob Kurland
comments, "Some bandsmen make
surprising and unexpected moves, but it
lends color to the show." Evidently
these formations lend color to the
audience also, as shown by the
reddening of pretty coeds' ears.
Some of these coeds have been
heard to ask, "Why is the Band so
gross?" According to 1971 Band
Manager Dave Ruiz, "Our grossness
stems from the frustrated libidos
common to Stanford males. The Band
offers a chance to bring this frustration
into the open so it no longer becomes a
force in a bandsman's personal life."
Bring Good Music
Ruiz explains the content of the
Band's controversial halftime shows
this way: "We like to step on toes, but
we don't leave any bruises. Our themes
are contemporary, and what is more
modern than sex and violence? Since
the band is nonviolent, that leaves us
only one choice. Our main object is still
to bring the good music to the people."
Everyone agrees that the Band does
provide good music for their pregame
and halftime shows. More people
should stay after the games to dance or
listen to the Band's mellow post-game
show.
The musical scores for these shows

are always new and varied. Sid Gospe,
Band Librarian, adds, "We have 260
pieces of music to choose from, and
we're playing up to 5 new songs per
game."
Most of these songs are arranged by
Band Director Dr. Arthur P. Barnes;
other arrangements are done by
Assistant Director, Glen Daum.
San Francisco Spree
Last year's band of 130 marchers
has greatly expanded its size to a
present enrollment of 180. Should
Stanford go to the Rose Bowl, the band
expects to march up to 200 people
(including both alumni bandsmen and a
possible wheelchair brigade).
Coming up soon is the Band's annual
pre Big Game San Francisco spree. Last
year, three thousand supporters
followed the Band as it snaked its way
through the City the night before the
Cal game.
That glorious night, there were
rallies at the Fairmont and Mark
Hopkins hotels, in Union Square, and
in North Beach. Those who were there
may remember a sixth dolly joining the
celebration: one of the
topless/bottomless girls from the "Off
Broadway" Club.

As a result of that parade, and some
of the Band's other activities, old wives
tales have sprung up claiming that
listening to the Band will give one warts
and cause insanity. If practiced in
moderation, such listening can actually
help make the student a more well
rounded, healthy individual. And it can
certainly take one's mind off classwork,
this providing temporary relief from
academic pressure.
Student Funds Appreciated
The Stanford Band is deeply grateful
for the student support it receives: $1
per student per quarter for the Autumn
and Winter quarters. This funding was
just started this year, and will be used
only for traveling expenses of the
Band's out of state games (e.g.
Missouri). The remainder of the Band's
funds come from the Athletic and
Music departments, who provide
instruments, uniforms, and
transportation for the USC and Cal
(away) games.
Bandsmen appreciate student
support in other, less tangible ways. As
Dave Ruiz puts it, "If you dig the
Band, let us know and we'll play
sounds for you that you never heard
before."

the San Jose Airport after the Washington game.

rounded, healthy individual. And it can
certainly take one's mind off classwork,
this providing temporary relief from
academic pressure.
Student Funds Appreciated
The Stanford Band is deeply grateful
for the student support it receives: $1
per student per quarter for the Autumn
and Winter quarters. This funding was
just started this year, and will be used
only for traveling expenses of the
Band's out of state games (e.g.
Missouri). The remainder of the Band's
funds come from the Athletic and
Music departments, who provide
instruments, uniforms, and
transportation for the USC and Cal
(away) games.
Bandsmen appreciate student
support in other, less tangible ways. As
Dave Ruiz puts it, "If you dig the
Band, let us know and we'll play
sounds for you that you never heard
before."

SPEAK, ALMIGHTY—No, no, that's not what he's saying at all. And this is not
one of the followers at a Billy Graham revival. It's a Leland Stanford Junior
University Marching Bank, or part of one, anyway, greeting the football team at
the San Jose Airport after the Washington game.
Those students who attended the
Stanford-Duke game may have asked
themselves, "Who were those costumed
clowns playing around on the field
before and after the Stanford Band's
halftime show?" It seems they were the
football team, but they've managed to
change their image since that game.
Fortunately for Saturday afternoon
spectators, one group of football gamp
entertainers hasn't changed its goofy
ii.iago, and looks like it isn't about to
for years to come—the Incomparable
Leland Stanford Junior University
Marching Band.
Anyone who has observed the Band
marching backwards on the field and in
the Rose Parade, or has seen their
"scramble technique" (it looks like
chaos, but everyone seems to know
where he is going), knows that they
certainly are a goofy bunch. They are
unpredictable as well-rumor has it that
a red and white skydiver may drop
onto the 50-yard line at the Big Game.
The Band Shack, home of the
LSJUMB, is one of the campus' most
little known, yet most amazing
monuments. Inside, one can find a
veritable treasure trove of signs taken
from highways, bars, airports, and the
University of California at Berkeley.
Frustrated Libidos
During Monday night rehearsals,
obscenities often punctuate the musical
score. After rehearsal, a group of
Bandsmen known as SMUT (Stanford
Marching Unit Thinkers) comes
together to plan the marching

formations for that week's game.
Once planned, the formations are
practiced Wednesday and Friday
afternoons. The actual marching show
on Saturday often deviates from the
practice.
Drum Major Bob Kurland
comments, "Some bandsmen make
surprising and unexpected moves, but it
lends color to the show." Evidently
these formations lend color to the
audience also, as shown by the
reddening of pretty coeds' ears.
Some of these coeds have been
heard to ask, "Why is the Band so
gross?" According to 1971 Band
Manager Dave Ruiz, "Our grossness
stems from the frustrated libidos
common to Stanford males. The Band
offers a chance to bring this frustration
into the open so it no longer becomes a
force in a bandsman's personal life."
Bring Good Music
Ruiz explains the content of the
Band's controversial halftime shows
this way: "We like to step on toes, but
we don't leave any bruises. Our themes
are contemporary, and what is more
modern than sex and violence? Since
the band is nonviolent, that leaves us
only one choice. Our main object is still
to bring the good music to the people."
Everyone agrees that the Band does
provide good music for their pregame
and halftime shows. More people
should stay after the games to dance or
listen to the Band's mellow post-game
show.
The musical scores for these shows

are always new and varied. Sid Gospe,
Band Librarian, adds, "We have 260
pieces of music to choose from, and
we're playing up to 5 new songs per
game."
Most of these songs are arranged by
Band Director Dr. Arthur P. Barnes;
other arrangements are done by
Assistant Director, Glen Daum.
San Francisco Spree
Last year's band of 130 marchers
has greatly expanded its size to a
present enrollment of 180. Should
Stanford go to the Rose Bowl, the band
expects to march up to 200 people
(including both alumni bandsmen and a
possible wheelchair brigade).
Coming up soon is the Band's annual
pre Big Game San Francisco spree. Last
year, three thousand supporters
followed the Band as it snaked its way
through the City the night before the
Cal game.
That glorious night, there were
rallies at the Fairmont and Mark
Hopkins hotels, in Union Square, and
in North Beach. Those who were there
may remember a sixth dolly joining the
celebration: one of the
topless/bottomless girls from the "Off
Broadway" Club.

As a result of that parade, and some
of the Band's other activities, old wives
tales have sprung up claiming that
listening to the Band will give one warts
and cause insanity. If practiced in
moderation, such listening can actually
help make the student a more well
rounded, healthy individual. And it can
certainly take one's mind off classwork,
this providing temporary relief from

Band Librarian, adds, "We have 260
pieces of music to choose from, and
we're playing up to 5 new songs per
game."
Most of these songs are arranged by
Band Director Dr. Arthur P. Barnes;
other arrangements are done by
Assistant Director, Glen Daum.
San Francisco Spree
Last year's band of 130 marchers
has greatly expanded its size to a
present enrollment of 180. Should
Stanford go to the Rose Bowl, the band
expects to march up to 200 people
(including both alumni bandsmen and a
possible wheelchair brigade).
Coming up soon is the Band's annual
pre Big Game San Francisco spree. Last
year, three thousand supporters
followed the Band as it snaked its way
through the City the night before the
Cal game.
That glorious night, there were
rallies at the Fairmont and Mark
Hopkins hotels, in Union Square, and
in North Beach. Those who were there
may remember a sixth dolly joining the
celebration: one of the
topless/bottomless girls from the "Off
Broadway" Club.

As a result of that parade, and some
of the Band's other activities, old wives
tales have sprung up claiming that
listening to the Band will give one warts
and cause insanity. If practiced in
moderation, such listening can actually
help make the student a more well
rounded, healthy individual. And it can
certainly take one's mind off classwork,
this providing temporary relief from
academic pressure.
Student Funds Appreciated
The Stanford Band is deeply grateful
for the student support it receives: $1
per student per quarter for the Autumn
and Winter quarters. This funding was
just started this year, and will be used
only for traveling expenses of the
Band's out of state games (e.g.
Missouri). The remainder of the Band's
funds come from the Athletic and
Music departments, who provide
instruments, uniforms, and
transportation for the USC and Cal
(away) games.
Bandsmen appreciate student
support in other, less tangible ways. As
Dave Ruiz puts it, "If you dig the
Band, let us know and we'll play
sounds for you that you never heard
before."

SPEAK, ALMIGHTY—No, no, that's not what he's saying at all. And this is not
one of the followers at a Billy Graham revival. It's a Leland Stanford Junior
University Marching Bank, or part of one, anyway, greeting the football team at
the San Jose Airport after the Washington game.
Those students who attended the
Stanford-Duke game may have asked
themselves, "Who were those costumed
clowns playing around on the field
before and after the Stanford Band's
halftime show?" It seems they were the
football team, but they've managed to
change their image since that game.
Fortunately for Saturday afternoon
spectators, one group of football gamp
entertainers hasn't changed its goofy
ii.iago, and looks like it isn't about to
for years to come—the Incomparable
Leland Stanford Junior University
Marching Band.
Anyone who has observed the Band
marching backwards on the field and in
the Rose Parade, or has seen their
"scramble technique" (it looks like
chaos, but everyone seems to know
where he is going), knows that they
certainly are a goofy bunch. They are
unpredictable as well-rumor has it that
a red and white skydiver may drop
onto the 50-yard line at the Big Game.
The Band Shack, home of the
LSJUMB, is one of the campus' most
little known, yet most amazing
monuments. Inside, one can find a
veritable treasure trove of signs taken
from highways, bars, airports, and the
University of California at Berkeley.
Frustrated Libidos
During Monday night rehearsals,
obscenities often punctuate the musical
score. After rehearsal, a group of
Bandsmen known as SMUT (Stanford
Marching Unit Thinkers) comes
together to plan the marching

formations for that week's game.
Once planned, the formations are
practiced Wednesday and Friday
afternoons. The actual marching show
on Saturday often deviates from the
practice.
Drum Major Bob Kurland
comments, "Some bandsmen make
surprising and unexpected moves, but it
lends color to the show." Evidently
these formations lend color to the
audience also, as shown by the
reddening of pretty coeds' ears.
Some of these coeds have been
heard to ask, "Why is the Band so
gross?" According to 1971 Band
Manager Dave Ruiz, "Our grossness
stems from the frustrated libidos
common to Stanford males. The Band
offers a chance to bring this frustration
into the open so it no longer becomes a
force in a bandsman's personal life."
Bring Good Music
Ruiz explains the content of the
Band's controversial halftime shows
this way: "We like to step on toes, but
we don't leave any bruises. Our themes
are contemporary, and what is more
modern than sex and violence? Since
the band is nonviolent, that leaves us
only one choice. Our main object is still
to bring the good music to the people."
Everyone agrees that the Band does
provide good music for their pregame
and halftime shows. More people
should stay after the games to dance or
listen to the Band's mellow post-game
show.

pieces of music to choose from, and
