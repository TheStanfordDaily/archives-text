# Physics Aid Available

### 
The Physics Department at
Stanford has established a
tutoring and counseling center for
use by all students who take
undergraduate physics courses and
particularly for those students
who are in the introductory
physics courses.
The center is located in room
ph 254 (Varian Physics Building)
and is staffed throughout each
quarter Mondays through Fridays
from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. with
one-hour breaks at noon and at 6
p.m.
Teaching assistants and other
physics graduate students will be
available at the center to students
who need help with their physics
assignments or who just wish to
rap about physics.
The center will supplant the
usual office hours of teaching
assistants; it has the advantage
that tutoring and counseling
assistance is available
continuously from morning to
evening each week day.
The center is supported partly
by the regular teaching assistant
budget of the Physics Department
and partly by the University
Progress Fund, recently
established by the University tc
improve undergraduate and
graduate education at Stanford.
