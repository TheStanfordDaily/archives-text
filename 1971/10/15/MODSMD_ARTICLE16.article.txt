# Plans To Equalize Pay
## 
### 
President Richard W. Lyman of
Stanford has initiated a special
project to identify and correct as
soon as possible any cases where
lack of salary parity between men
and women in the same
classification is based on sex.
Provost William F. Miller will
be concerned with faculty and
other teaching personnel, while
Vice President Robert R.
Augsburger will work on staff
personnel.
Edward E. Shaw, executive
assistant to the provost, and
Douglas H. Barton, staff legal
counsel, will meet regularly with
Anne Miner, the President's
consultant on affirmative action

for women, to develop the design
and implementation phases of this
project.
In a Sept. 16 note to Provost
Miller and Vice President
Augsburger, President Lyman
noted that salary increases that
represent corrections to reach
party by sex are exempt from the
current wage-price freeze.
All corrections in salary will be
paid as they are identified, with
payment effective as of Sept. 1.
During the wage-price freeze, the
salary base used for adjustments
will be 1970-71.
President Lyman expressed
hope that an intensified effort
might conclude this project within
three months.
