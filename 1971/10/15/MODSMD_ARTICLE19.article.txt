# Mamoulian, Bondarchuk, Brando
## Film Festival: Revelations, Disappointments 
### TODD McCARTHY 
With the San Francisco Film
Festival now well into its second
week, a couple of significant
disappointments have cropped up,
but the festival has not been
without its revelations as well.
The retrospective tributes are
fun as always, although
exhausting. The work of Rouben
Mamoulian, with the exception of
Garbo's "Queen Christina," is not

terribly well-known no accessible,
but the film clips of his provided
revealed much extraordinary
footage from such films as
"Applause," "City Streets" and
"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" and
proved Mamoulian a master of
light and shadow only a step
below Von Sternberg at
Paramount. "Love Me Tonight,"
shown in its entirety, is nothing
less than one of the greatest films

of the thirties.
Half of San Francisco's Russian
population seemed to be in
attendance for the tribute to
Sergei Bondarchuk, speaking their
native tongue to boot. The many
extraordinary scenes from "War
and Peace" were great to see again
and though Bondarchuk himself
was fairly stern and reserved, it's
always illuminating to have an
emissary from the East in San
Francisco.
The tribute to Arthur Penn was
filled with high school students as
well as the usual film buff crowd
and Penn was his usual articulate,
intelligent and enthusiastic self.
Disappointing Brando
Among the films, the greatest
disappointment was provided by
Marlon Brando's new picture,
"The Nightcomers," which is
gruesome, ludicrous and
downright dull, not a very
appetizing combination. Frogs are
filled with cigar smoke until they
explode, a bound woman is
repeatedly (though willingly)
raped by Brando with his boots
on and characters (including
Brando)are murdered by nice little
English kids. Lots of fun.
I really can't take director
Michael Winner very seriously,
despite the mod frivolity of "The
Jokers," for "The Nightcomers" is
his fourth film in two years and it
shows. The film is based on events
leading up to "The Turn of the
Screw" and Winner admits he
didn't even read the James novel
before production began.
I always approach each new
Brando film with eager
anticipation, hoping that this will
finally be the film that returns
him to pre-eminence among actors
where he belongs, but I'm afraid
"The Nightcomers" is far from
being that film. Perhaps it will be
"The Godfather," which Francis
Ford Coppola is currently editing
at Zoetrope Studios in San
Francisco.
Bertolucci's Disappointment
Another major disappointment
was Bernardo Bertolucci's
"Partner." The film has been
shown only once before in the
United States and having been

made several years ago, very early
in Bertolucci's career, it is
strongly influenced by Godard,
opening with a young man reading
a book in a glass-enclosed cafe and
proceeding from there.
I tend to think any strongly
individualistic director such as
Godard or Welles, inspiring as
they are, can easily be a dangerous
influence on any young film
maker and "Partner" suffers from
the absence of Bertolucci asserting
himself confidently as he does in
"The Conformist." Even with
such unresolved material,
Bertolucci's obsessive lateral
tracking shots are beautiful to
watch, as they are in a short he
made with the Living Theater
called "Agonia."
Julian Beck could be quite an
actor if he deigned to expand his
repertoire from groveling animals.
On the other side of the ledger,
Jacques Demy's "Peau d'Ane"
("Donkey Skin") was a delight.
Though the film marks Demy's
third musical collaboration with
Michel Legrand, it is not a French
musical obsessed with American
musicals the way "The Umbrellas
of Cherbourg" and especially
"The Young Girls of Rochefort"
were. Actually, "Peau d'Ane" is
closer to Cocteau's extraordinary
"The Beauty and the Beast" than
to anything else and indeed,
Cocteau is paid both visual and
peotic homage in the film.
Tacky
Ever since the stunning
virtuosity of "Lola" and "Bay of
Angels," Demy's films have
become less adventurous visually
to the point of becoming, with
"Peau d'Ane," almost tacky
(though beautifully tacky). It's
sometimes easy to understand the
objections of Demy's detractors
and ultimately one must either
love him or hate him.
One of the problems with
Demy is that he often doesn't
accomplish all he sets out to do,
for which he can be criticized, but
one knows that his intentions are
all the best and that his heart is in
the right place, so defense in his
favor often becomes irrationally
impassioned

I, for one, cannot resist Demy's
intentions, nor the actors he
chooses to populate his world nor
Michel Legrand's lyrical scores for
all his films. Fortunately, "Peau
d'Ane" stands up well even from
an objective viewpoint.(unless you
hate fairy tales) and the
enthusiastic response of
Saturday's festival audience would
seem to merit the attention of
America's distributing companies,
who have thus far failed to pick
up Demy's film for release.
"Millhouse"
One of Friday's festival entries
was "Millhouse: A White
Comedy," which is currently
playing at the Presidio Theater
with "Lenny Bruce on TV."
Despite what producer-director
Emile de Antonio ("Point of
Order," "In the Year of the Pig")
claims, I think "Millhouse" is
loaded against Nixon to appeal to
an audience whose attitudes and
reactions are predetermined.
Thus, the film really doesn't prove
anything we didn't already know,
though it does bring the
president's image change, or the
"new Nixon," into clearer focus.
The film seems loaded with
contempt for both political
parties but after endless footage
with the jowley face of RMN
dominating the proceedings, the
brief glimpses of Adlai Stevenson,
JFK and Jackie felt like such
breaths of fresh air that the
audience burst into unrestrained
applause.
Basically, "Millhouse" is worth
seeing for a few priceless clips that
are included. The Checkers speech
was 1952 television at its inept
best and Nixon at his most
personal worst. Pat Nixon sitting
next to him during this debacle
seems to be prematurely declaring
herself for candidacy in Madame
Tussaud's Wax Museum.
An interview with Nixon's
senior prom date is revealing ("I
don't mean to say that he was
cold. . .") as is Nixon at his press
conference after losing his race for
governor of California when he
delivered the unfortunately
unprophetic line, "Gentlemen,
you won't have Nixon to kick
around any more."

his fourth film in two years and it
shows. The film is based on events
leading up to "The Turn of the
Screw" and Winner admits he
didn't even read the James novel
before production began.
I always approach each new
Brando film with eager
anticipation, hoping that this will
finally be the film that returns
him to pre-eminence among actors
where he belongs, but I'm afraid
"The Nightcomers" is far from
being that film. Perhaps it will be
"The Godfather," which Francis
Ford Coppola is currently editing
at Zoetrope Studios in San
Francisco.
Bertolucci's Disappointment
Another major disappointment
was Bernardo Bertolucci's
"Partner." The film has been
shown only once before in the
United States and having been

made several years ago, very early
in Bertolucci's career, it is
strongly influenced by Godard,
opening with a young man reading
a book in a glass-enclosed cafe and
proceeding from there.
I tend to think any strongly
individualistic director such as
Godard or Welles, inspiring as
they are, can easily be a dangerous
influence on any young film
maker and "Partner" suffers from
the absence of Bertolucci asserting
himself confidently as he does in
"The Conformist." Even with
such unresolved material,
Bertolucci's obsessive lateral
tracking shots are beautiful to
watch, as they are in a short he
made with the Living Theater
called "Agonia."
Julian Beck could be quite an
actor if he deigned to expand his
repertoire from groveling animals.
On the other side of the ledger,
Jacques Demy's "Peau d'Ane"
("Donkey Skin") was a delight.
Though the film marks Demy's
third musical collaboration with
Michel Legrand, it is not a French
musical obsessed with American
musicals the way "The Umbrellas
of Cherbourg" and especially
"The Young Girls of Rochefort"
were. Actually, "Peau d'Ane" is
closer to Cocteau's extraordinary
"The Beauty and the Beast" than
to anything else and indeed,
Cocteau is paid both visual and
peotic homage in the film.
Tacky
Ever since the stunning
virtuosity of "Lola" and "Bay of
Angels," Demy's films have
become less adventurous visually
to the point of becoming, with
"Peau d'Ane," almost tacky
(though beautifully tacky). It's
sometimes easy to understand the
objections of Demy's detractors
and ultimately one must either
love him or hate him.
One of the problems with
Demy is that he often doesn't
accomplish all he sets out to do,
for which he can be criticized, but
one knows that his intentions are
all the best and that his heart is in
the right place, so defense in his
favor often becomes irrationally
impassioned

I, for one, cannot resist Demy's
intentions, nor the actors he
chooses to populate his world nor
Michel Legrand's lyrical scores for
all his films. Fortunately, "Peau
d'Ane" stands up well even from
an objective viewpoint.(unless you
hate fairy tales) and the
enthusiastic response of
Saturday's festival audience would
seem to merit the attention of
America's distributing companies,
who have thus far failed to pick
up Demy's film for release.
"Millhouse"
One of Friday's festival entries
was "Millhouse: A White
Comedy," which is currently
playing at the Presidio Theater
with "Lenny Bruce on TV."
Despite what producer-director
Emile de Antonio ("Point of
Order," "In the Year of the Pig")
claims, I think "Millhouse" is
loaded against Nixon to appeal to
an audience whose attitudes and
reactions are predetermined.
Thus, the film really doesn't prove
anything we didn't already know,
though it does bring the
president's image change, or the
"new Nixon," into clearer focus.
The film seems loaded with
contempt for both political
parties but after endless footage
with the jowley face of RMN
dominating the proceedings, the
brief glimpses of Adlai Stevenson,
JFK and Jackie felt like such
breaths of fresh air that the
audience burst into unrestrained
applause.
Basically, "Millhouse" is worth
seeing for a few priceless clips that
are included. The Checkers speech
was 1952 television at its inept
best and Nixon at his most
personal worst. Pat Nixon sitting
next to him during this debacle
seems to be prematurely declaring
herself for candidacy in Madame
Tussaud's Wax Museum.
An interview with Nixon's
senior prom date is revealing ("I
don't mean to say that he was
cold. . .") as is Nixon at his press
conference after losing his race for
governor of California when he
delivered the unfortunately
unprophetic line, "Gentlemen,
you won't have Nixon to kick
around any more."

FESTIVAL HONOREEr-Rouben Mamoulian was one of the directors
honored with an afternoon tribute during the San Francisco Film
Festival. Clips of some of the major works by the director of
"Applause," "City Streets," "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde," were
screened at the festival last Friday.
With the San Francisco Film
Festival now well into its second
week, a couple of significant
disappointments have cropped up,
but the festival has not been
without its revelations as well.
The retrospective tributes are
fun as always, although
exhausting. The work of Rouben
Mamoulian, with the exception of
Garbo's "Queen Christina," is not

terribly well-known no accessible,
but the film clips of his provided
revealed much extraordinary
footage from such films as
"Applause," "City Streets" and
"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" and
proved Mamoulian a master of
light and shadow only a step
below Von Sternberg at
Paramount. "Love Me Tonight,"
shown in its entirety, is nothing
less than one of the greatest films

of the thirties.
Half of San Francisco's Russian
population seemed to be in
attendance for the tribute to
Sergei Bondarchuk, speaking their
native tongue to boot. The many
extraordinary scenes from "War
and Peace" were great to see again
and though Bondarchuk himself
was fairly stern and reserved, it's
always illuminating to have an
emissary from the East in San
Francisco.
The tribute to Arthur Penn was
filled with high school students as
well as the usual film buff crowd
and Penn was his usual articulate,
intelligent and enthusiastic self.
Disappointing Brando
Among the films, the greatest
disappointment was provided by
Marlon Brando's new picture,
"The Nightcomers," which is
gruesome, ludicrous and
downright dull, not a very
appetizing combination. Frogs are
filled with cigar smoke until they
explode, a bound woman is
repeatedly (though willingly)
raped by Brando with his boots
on and characters (including
Brando)are murdered by nice little
English kids. Lots of fun.
I really can't take director
Michael Winner very seriously,
despite the mod frivolity of "The
Jokers," for "The Nightcomers" is
his fourth film in two years and it
shows. The film is based on events
leading up to "The Turn of the
Screw" and Winner admits he
didn't even read the James novel

were. Actually, "Peau d'Ane" is
closer to Cocteau's extraordinary
"The Beauty and the Beast" than
to anything else and indeed,
Cocteau is paid both visual and
peotic homage in the film.
Tacky
Ever since the stunning
virtuosity of "Lola" and "Bay of
Angels," Demy's films have
become less adventurous visually
to the point of becoming, with
"Peau d'Ane," almost tacky
(though beautifully tacky). It's
sometimes easy to understand the
objections of Demy's detractors
and ultimately one must either
love him or hate him.
One of the problems with
Demy is that he often doesn't
accomplish all he sets out to do,
for which he can be criticized, but
one knows that his intentions are
all the best and that his heart is in
the right place, so defense in his
favor often becomes irrationally
impassioned

I, for one, cannot resist Demy's
intentions, nor the actors he
chooses to populate his world nor
Michel Legrand's lyrical scores for
all his films. Fortunately, "Peau
d'Ane" stands up well even from
an objective viewpoint.(unless you
hate fairy tales) and the
enthusiastic response of
Saturday's festival audience would
seem to merit the attention of
America's distributing companies,
who have thus far failed to pick
up Demy's film for release.
"Millhouse"
One of Friday's festival entries
was "Millhouse: A White
Comedy," which is currently
playing at the Presidio Theater
with "Lenny Bruce on TV."
Despite what producer-director
Emile de Antonio ("Point of
Order," "In the Year of the Pig")
claims, I think "Millhouse" is
loaded against Nixon to appeal to
an audience whose attitudes and
reactions are predetermined.
Thus, the film really doesn't prove
anything we didn't already know,
though it does bring the
president's image change, or the
"new Nixon," into clearer focus.
The film seems loaded with
contempt for both political
parties but after endless footage
with the jowley face of RMN
dominating the proceedings, the
brief glimpses of Adlai Stevenson,
JFK and Jackie felt like such
breaths of fresh air that the
audience burst into unrestrained
applause.
Basically, "Millhouse" is worth
seeing for a few priceless clips that
are included. The Checkers speech
was 1952 television at its inept
best and Nixon at his most
personal worst. Pat Nixon sitting
next to him during this debacle
seems to be prematurely declaring
herself for candidacy in Madame
Tussaud's Wax Museum.
An interview with Nixon's
senior prom date is revealing ("I
don't mean to say that he was
cold. . .") as is Nixon at his press
conference after losing his race for
governor of California when he
delivered the unfortunately
unprophetic line, "Gentlemen,
you won't have Nixon to kick
around any more."

FESTIVAL HONOREEr-Rouben Mamoulian was one of the directors
honored with an afternoon tribute during the San Francisco Film
Festival. Clips of some of the major works by the director of
"Applause," "City Streets," "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde," were
screened at the festival last Friday.
With the San Francisco Film
Festival now well into its second
week, a couple of significant
disappointments have cropped up,
but the festival has not been
without its revelations as well.
The retrospective tributes are
fun as always, although
exhausting. The work of Rouben
Mamoulian, with the exception of
Garbo's "Queen Christina," is not

terribly well-known no accessible,
but the film clips of his provided
revealed much extraordinary
footage from such films as
"Applause," "City Streets" and
"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" and
proved Mamoulian a master of
light and shadow only a step
below Von Sternberg at
Paramount. "Love Me Tonight,"
shown in its entirety, is nothing
less than one of the greatest films

of the thirties.
Half of San Francisco's Russian
population seemed to be in
attendance for the tribute to
Sergei Bondarchuk, speaking their
native tongue to boot. The many
extraordinary scenes from "War
and Peace" were great to see again
and though Bondarchuk himself
was fairly stern and reserved, it's
always illuminating to have an
emissary from the East in San
Francisco.
The tribute to Arthur Penn was
filled with high school students as
well as the usual film buff crowd
and Penn was his usual articulate,
intelligent and enthusiastic self.
Disappointing Brando
Among the films, the greatest
disappointment was provided by
Marlon Brando's new picture,
"The Nightcomers," which is
gruesome, ludicrous and
downright dull, not a very
appetizing combination. Frogs are
filled with cigar smoke until they
explode, a bound woman is
repeatedly (though willingly)
raped by Brando with his boots
on and characters (including
Brando)are murdered by nice little
English kids. Lots of fun.
I really can't take director
Michael Winner very seriously,
despite the mod frivolity of "The
Jokers," for "The Nightcomers" is
his fourth film in two years and it
shows. The film is based on events
leading up to "The Turn of the
Screw" and Winner admits he
didn't even read the James novel
before production began.
I always approach each new
Brando film with eager
anticipation, hoping that this will
finally be the film that returns
him to pre-eminence among actors
where he belongs, but I'm afraid
"The Nightcomers" is far from
being that film. Perhaps it will be
"The Godfather," which Francis
Ford Coppola is currently editing
at Zoetrope Studios in San
Francisco.
Bertolucci's Disappointment
Another major disappointment
was Bernardo Bertolucci's
"Partner." The film has been
shown only once before in the
United States and having been

made several years ago, very early
in Bertolucci's career, it is
strongly influenced by Godard,
opening with a young man reading
a book in a glass-enclosed cafe and
proceeding from there.
I tend to think any strongly
individualistic director such as
Godard or Welles, inspiring as
they are, can easily be a dangerous
influence on any young film
maker and "Partner" suffers from
the absence of Bertolucci asserting
himself confidently as he does in
"The Conformist." Even with
such unresolved material,
Bertolucci's obsessive lateral
tracking shots are beautiful to
watch, as they are in a short he
made with the Living Theater
called "Agonia."
Julian Beck could be quite an
actor if he deigned to expand his
repertoire from groveling animals.
On the other side of the ledger,
Jacques Demy's "Peau d'Ane"
("Donkey Skin") was a delight.
Though the film marks Demy's
third musical collaboration with
Michel Legrand, it is not a French
musical obsessed with American
musicals the way "The Umbrellas
of Cherbourg" and especially
"The Young Girls of Rochefort"
were. Actually, "Peau d'Ane" is
closer to Cocteau's extraordinary
"The Beauty and the Beast" than
to anything else and indeed,
Cocteau is paid both visual and
peotic homage in the film.

"new Nixon," into clearer focus.
The film seems loaded with
contempt for both political
parties but after endless footage
with the jowley face of RMN
dominating the proceedings, the
brief glimpses of Adlai Stevenson,
JFK and Jackie felt like such
breaths of fresh air that the
audience burst into unrestrained
applause.
Basically, "Millhouse" is worth
seeing for a few priceless clips that
are included. The Checkers speech
was 1952 television at its inept
best and Nixon at his most
personal worst. Pat Nixon sitting
next to him during this debacle
seems to be prematurely declaring
herself for candidacy in Madame
Tussaud's Wax Museum.
An interview with Nixon's
senior prom date is revealing ("I
don't mean to say that he was
cold. . .") as is Nixon at his press
conference after losing his race for
governor of California when he
delivered the unfortunately
unprophetic line, "Gentlemen,
you won't have Nixon to kick
around any more."

FESTIVAL HONOREEr-Rouben Mamoulian was one of the directors
honored with an afternoon tribute during the San Francisco Film
Festival. Clips of some of the major works by the director of
"Applause," "City Streets," "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde," were
screened at the festival last Friday.
With the San Francisco Film
Festival now well into its second
week, a couple of significant
disappointments have cropped up,
but the festival has not been
without its revelations as well.
The retrospective tributes are
fun as always, although
exhausting. The work of Rouben
Mamoulian, with the exception of
Garbo's "Queen Christina," is not

terribly well-known no accessible,
but the film clips of his provided
revealed much extraordinary
footage from such films as
"Applause," "City Streets" and
"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" and
proved Mamoulian a master of
light and shadow only a step
below Von Sternberg at
Paramount. "Love Me Tonight,"
shown in its entirety, is nothing
less than one of the greatest films

of the thirties.
Half of San Francisco's Russian
population seemed to be in
attendance for the tribute to
Sergei Bondarchuk, speaking their
native tongue to boot. The many
extraordinary scenes from "War
and Peace" were great to see again
and though Bondarchuk himself
was fairly stern and reserved, it's
always illuminating to have an
emissary from the East in San
Francisco.
The tribute to Arthur Penn was
filled with high school students as
well as the usual film buff crowd
and Penn was his usual articulate,
intelligent and enthusiastic self.
Disappointing Brando
Among the films, the greatest
disappointment was provided by
Marlon Brando's new picture,
"The Nightcomers," which is
gruesome, ludicrous and
downright dull, not a very
appetizing combination. Frogs are
filled with cigar smoke until they
explode, a bound woman is
repeatedly (though willingly)
raped by Brando with his boots
on and characters (including
Brando)are murdered by nice little
English kids. Lots of fun.
I really can't take director
Michael Winner very seriously,
despite the mod frivolity of "The
Jokers," for "The Nightcomers" is
his fourth film in two years and it
shows. The film is based on events
leading up to "The Turn of the
Screw" and Winner admits he
didn't even read the James novel
before production began.
I always approach each new
Brando film with eager
anticipation, hoping that this will
finally be the film that returns
him to pre-eminence among actors
where he belongs, but I'm afraid
"The Nightcomers" is far from
being that film. Perhaps it will be
"The Godfather," which Francis
Ford Coppola is currently editing
at Zoetrope Studios in San
Francisco.
Bertolucci's Disappointment
Another major disappointment
was Bernardo Bertolucci's
"Partner." The film has been
shown only once before in the
United States and having been

made several years ago, very early
in Bertolucci's career, it is
strongly influenced by Godard,
opening with a young man reading
a book in a glass-enclosed cafe and
proceeding from there.
I tend to think any strongly
individualistic director such as
Godard or Welles, inspiring as
they are, can easily be a dangerous
influence on any young film
maker and "Partner" suffers from
the absence of Bertolucci asserting
himself confidently as he does in
"The Conformist." Even with
such unresolved material,
Bertolucci's obsessive lateral
tracking shots are beautiful to
watch, as they are in a short he
made with the Living Theater
called "Agonia."
Julian Beck could be quite an
actor if he deigned to expand his
repertoire from groveling animals.
On the other side of the ledger,
Jacques Demy's "Peau d'Ane"
("Donkey Skin") was a delight.
Though the film marks Demy's
third musical collaboration with
Michel Legrand, it is not a French
musical obsessed with American
musicals the way "The Umbrellas
of Cherbourg" and especially
"The Young Girls of Rochefort"
were. Actually, "Peau d'Ane" is
closer to Cocteau's extraordinary
"The Beauty and the Beast" than
to anything else and indeed,
Cocteau is paid both visual and
peotic homage in the film.
Tacky
Ever since the stunning
virtuosity of "Lola" and "Bay of
Angels," Demy's films have
become less adventurous visually
to the point of becoming, with
"Peau d'Ane," almost tacky
(though beautifully tacky). It's
sometimes easy to understand the
objections of Demy's detractors
and ultimately one must either
love him or hate him.
One of the problems with
Demy is that he often doesn't
accomplish all he sets out to do,
for which he can be criticized, but
one knows that his intentions are
all the best and that his heart is in
the right place, so defense in his
favor often becomes irrationally
impassioned

I, for one, cannot resist Demy's
intentions, nor the actors he
chooses to populate his world nor
Michel Legrand's lyrical scores for
all his films. Fortunately, "Peau
d'Ane" stands up well even from
an objective viewpoint.(unless you
hate fairy tales) and the
enthusiastic response of
Saturday's festival audience would
seem to merit the attention of
America's distributing companies,
who have thus far failed to pick
up Demy's film for release.
"Millhouse"
One of Friday's festival entries
was "Millhouse: A White
Comedy," which is currently
playing at the Presidio Theater
with "Lenny Bruce on TV."
Despite what producer-director
Emile de Antonio ("Point of
Order," "In the Year of the Pig")
claims, I think "Millhouse" is
loaded against Nixon to appeal to
an audience whose attitudes and
reactions are predetermined.
Thus, the film really doesn't prove
anything we didn't already know,
though it does bring the
president's image change, or the
"new Nixon," into clearer focus.
The film seems loaded with
contempt for both political
parties but after endless footage
with the jowley face of RMN
dominating the proceedings, the
brief glimpses of Adlai Stevenson,
JFK and Jackie felt like such
breaths of fresh air that the
audience burst into unrestrained
applause.
Basically, "Millhouse" is worth
seeing for a few priceless clips that
are included. The Checkers speech
was 1952 television at its inept
