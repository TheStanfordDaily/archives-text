# Experiment In Living
## Students Set Guidelines 
### 
Six Stanford students participated
this summer in a unique experiment to
not only determine guidelines for the
disbursement of $3.5 million of
environmental funds, but to do it in an
atmosphere not often associated with
governmental bureaucracies.
Working in an experimental
situation, the 12 lived together in a
home in Potomac, Maryland. "We were
working 14 to 16 hours a day on the
project, and were with the same people
24 hours a day" said committee
member Judy Landfield.
In this novel environment, the
committee not only completed their
original goal of categorizing proposals
for review, but also created a new
means of evaluation, and played a
significant part in writing guidelines for
allocating this year's $3.5 million in
funds.
Formation of the committee was
prompted by the enactment of the
Environmental Education Act in 1970,
in which some $1.7 million in
government funds were allotted to
support public programs considered
"ecologically sound" by the
Department of Health, Education, and
Welfare.
Intense Work
However, when 2000 applications
were received requesting some part of

the funds, HEW found that it needed a
more efficient means of evaluating the
proposals.
The committee's work environment
was intense. Reactions to the living
situation were varied, with all admitting
that there were many inter-personal
hassles and a great deal of pressure.
"Most people would have gone out of
their gourds," commented Landfield.
Another member, Gary Reid, feels
that the committee was so successful
that Washington should "wipe out the
whole bureaucracy and do it this way
instead of the eight-hour-a-day trip."
"Really Tense"
Although the original group was
comprised of 12, at one point there
were almost 25 living in the house,
including students who joined the
group over the summer and seven
nationally known environmentalists
who served as senior evaluators.
"At first the situation was really
tense because we felt we had to prove
ourselves to the evaluators," said Reid.
By the end of the week the situation
had eased considerably.
"One of the coolest things this
summer was to see the head changes in
some of those guys," added Reid. One
evaluator reportedly left with tears in
his eyes at the end of the project.

The plans submitted to HEW ranged
from schoolteachers wanting to
organize nature walks to 200-page
reports from universities wanting to
renovate their entire environmental
studies programs.
Point System
All 2000 applications were read and
reread by the committee, and from
them 600 criteria were formulated of
what makes an environmental
education good.
From this research an evaluative
point system was set up placing the
proposals into two major categories: 1)
those dealing directly with educating
the public on environmental concerns,
and 2) those that actually facilitate
such programs.
Another outgrowth of the project
may involve contacting and funding
people who are already operating
outstanding environmental programs to
keep them in operation.
In addition to the immediate effects
of their work, the cofnmittee hopes to
see additional action taken to help
implement the programs whose
applications for funding are denied.
Last year, out of 2000 proposals
only 74 were funded, which means that
some 1,926 got nothing" said Reid. To
prevent the better proposals from being
discarded, the Environmental
Education Office (a part of HEW) plans
to employ consultants to help
applicants revise their programs so as to
be more likely to receive funds from
the government or other organizations.
"Some of the applicants submit
plans to build environmental action
centers and then request several
thousand dollars to cut down trees and
pave the parking lot," spoke committee
member Mary Corff. Consultants would
be employed to correct such
inconsistencies.
However, perhaps the committee
itself could have used a consultant.
According to Reid, "We were living in a
really environmentally unsound way,"
as the group was spending up to $200 a
week on food alone during the first
weeks.
HEW plans to make the evaluation
review an annual program and will
probably continue to experiment with
the intensive living situation.

From this research an evaluative
point system was set up placing the

those dealing directly with educating
the public on environmental concerns,
and 2) those that actually facilitate
such programs.
Another outgrowth of the project
may involve contacting and funding
people who are already operating

In addition to the immediate effects
of their work, the cofnmittee hopes to

Last year, out of 2000 proposals
only 74 were funded, which means that
some 1,926 got nothing" said Reid. To
prevent the better proposals from being
discarded, the Environmental
Education Office (a part of HEW) plans
to employ consultants to help
applicants revise their programs so as to
be more likely to receive funds from
the government or other organizations.
"Some of the applicants submit
plans to build environmental action
centers and then request several
thousand dollars to cut down trees and
pave the parking lot," spoke committee
member Mary Corff. Consultants would
be employed to correct such
inconsistencies.
However, perhaps the committee
itself could have used a consultant.
According to Reid, "We were living in a
really environmentally unsound way,"
as the group was spending up to $200 a
week on food alone during the first
weeks.
HEW plans to make the evaluation
review an annual program and will
probably continue to experiment with
the intensive living situation.
Six Stanford students participated
this summer in a unique experiment to
not only determine guidelines for the
disbursement of $3.5 million of
environmental funds, but to do it in an
atmosphere not often associated with
governmental bureaucracies.
Working in an experimental
situation, the 12 lived together in a
home in Potomac, Maryland. "We were
working 14 to 16 hours a day on the
project, and were with the same people
24 hours a day" said committee
member Judy Landfield.
In this novel environment, the
committee not only completed their
original goal of categorizing proposals
for review, but also created a new
means of evaluation, and played a
significant part in writing guidelines for
allocating this year's $3.5 million in
funds.
Formation of the committee was
prompted by the enactment of the
Environmental Education Act in 1970,
in which some $1.7 million in
government funds were allotted to
support public programs considered
"ecologically sound" by the
Department of Health, Education, and
Welfare.
Intense Work
However, when 2000 applications
were received requesting some part of

the funds, HEW found that it needed a
more efficient means of evaluating the
proposals.
The committee's work environment
was intense. Reactions to the living
situation were varied, with all admitting
that there were many inter-personal
hassles and a great deal of pressure.
"Most people would have gone out of
their gourds," commented Landfield.
Another member, Gary Reid, feels
that the committee was so successful
that Washington should "wipe out the
whole bureaucracy and do it this way
instead of the eight-hour-a-day trip."
"Really Tense"
Although the original group was
comprised of 12, at one point there
were almost 25 living in the house,
including students who joined the
group over the summer and seven
nationally known environmentalists
who served as senior evaluators.
"At first the situation was really
tense because we felt we had to prove
ourselves to the evaluators," said Reid.
By the end of the week the situation
had eased considerably.
"One of the coolest things this
summer was to see the head changes in
some of those guys," added Reid. One
evaluator reportedly left with tears in
his eyes at the end of the project.

The plans submitted to HEW ranged
from schoolteachers wanting to
organize nature walks to 200-page
reports from universities wanting to
renovate their entire environmental
studies programs.
