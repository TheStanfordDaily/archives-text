# Uncomon Theatre, Cafe La Mama Style
## 
### MARC KAYE 
People search for experiences that are more valid than those
received in a medium such as radio. People want to be moved; they
want to be shaken to their very roots. People want excitement.
Indeed, people look for an experience which transcends the
everyday common nature of films and television. They turn to the
theater for an out from the ordinary and routine. They often find the
most precious, outstanding, jewel-like experience that outshines
anything they have ever seen. And so goes the E.T.C. Company of
Cafe La Mama, New York.
It is the uncommon of theater experience. If ever an avid theater
goer should get bored with the common fare, there is Cafe La Mama
and other such experimental groups that will shock one out of
stagnating complacency.
Cafe La Mama induces a different state of consciousness, full of
romanticism, amazement, mind-blowing, fantastical: as if the
hallucinations were happening in front of you. The new perspectives:
only the imagination is the limit. A new kaleidoscope in the hands of
a child; that erotic feeling of creation and discovery and wonder.
It is essentially an experiment in the modes of theatrical technique
and expression. Cafe La Mama, it seems, aims at the audience's ability
to perceive, attacking the traditional, constrictive modes, enlarging
upon them, and consequently making the theatrical experience both
La Mama's production and others, a more vital, valid and rich
experience.
To give some conceptualization of all this, I'll describe the
techniques employed in their production "Carmilla" an adaptation
by Wilford Leach, a member of the Company, of the horror story
novelette written by J.S. LeFanu which may be somewhat obscure for
those of us who are unfamiliar with the genre. There is somewhat of a
cohesive plot to the story, which appropriately occurs in thirteen
scenes.
Also appropriately, is the fact that we are never completely
enlightened as to the true relationship of the two main characters in
the play, Carmilla and Laura. The resolution of the mystery is never
completely consummated, but rather strongly suggested.
Beyond the plot's being a vehicle for showing a complex irony,
which emphasizes ways of seeing or perceiving, the plot similarly acts
as a vehicle for the exhibition of theatrical techniques and ways of
seeing. It gines the Company enough material to work with so that
not only an intellectual perception of irony is available, but also a
visual perception of irony.
The techniques employed for enhancing the audience's ability to
see are absolutely stunning. First, there is almost constant tension
between actors and a screen behind them, on which is projected
images of their very thoughts and feeling. The aesthetic beauty of the
photography blends in nicely with the aesthetic feeling established by
the actors themselves. It was more or less a smooth and enchanting
point-counterpoint, exacerbated only by the tension between media,
between ways of seeing. For the problem was "what do I watch, the
actors or the screen?"
Each individual participates in the drama in that he must keep his
eye in a dynamic movement between the two media, establishing a
balance so that pertinent action in both won't be missed, bouncing his
vision from one media to the other and back again.
I won't go further into the dynamics of "Demon" or "Gertrude"
for fear of spoiling a precious, delicious treat. One thing that might
help though, which was available at the UCLA performances, but is
not available at the Berkeley performance in the program guide, is a
synopsis of the action and a slight interpretation of the situation of
"Demon" and Gertrude". If anything, it might help one follow the
plot or lack of it, without destroying the flavor of the plays.
