# First-rate Conductor
## Spectacular S.F, 'Meistersinger' 
### GARY SCHMIDGALL 
It is hard to think of an opera that tests the
vocal, musical, and sheer financial resources of an
opera company more than does Wagner's "Die
Meistersinger von Neurnberg." In its essential
concept, in the populousness of its cast, in the vocal
endurance and profundity it demands (not to
mention its 5-hour length), "Meistersinger" is the
grandest grand opera.
More importantly, this opera is in effect perhaps
the greatest psalm to the power of music as a means
for the ennoblement of life. "Meistersinger"
celebrates, among other things, a city's realization
of the need for and the glory of its own musicians;
and 1 am happy to report that this new production
was a spectacular musical success S.F. can well be
proud of.
The source of success was an almost inundating
excellence of vocalism synchronized by what should
now be recognized as a first-rate Wagnerian
conductor, Otmar Suitner. Under him the comedy
in the score (unlike that on the stage) never grew
limp; he kept pace and control throughout, with
extreme deference to the slightest nuances.
Full, Compact Voice
Leading the cast in the crowning baritone role of
Hans Sachs was Theo Adam. He looked just right
for the part (not too old, handsome and vigorous)
and sang in a full, compact voice that was easily
equal to this arduous role. Otherwise, Adam
presented a perfect Sachs: capable of a variety of
deeply emotional moments, with a core of awesome
gravity, and yet a thoroughly humane man—ein
guter Mensch.
Geraint Evans' comic spree as Beckmesser was so
unfailingly and extravagantly resourceful as to be
almost nerve-wracking: one's eyes tend to remain
glued on him even when the action is elsewhere. He
made Beckmesser the picture of the man in rage for
rules, all his natural emotions constipated, his nerves
utterly frazzled by his own cunning. As for his
singing, well it is perhaps not too much to say that
Evans is the most brilliant singing comedian now.

Heldentenor James King sang a thrilling Prize
Song and had other fine moments. King clearly has
all the necessary vocal apparatus for Wagner, but
this is his debut in the role of Walther, and it still
remains for him to make this difficult, typically
low-IQ tenor role his own and more believable.
As should be clear, the musical values of the
production left nothing to be wished for; the
situation was less happy visually. The old
production was not an offensive one. Neither is this
one, but given the astronomical expense of new
productions and the many S.F. settings which are
really scandalous ("Don Giovanni," "Trovatore,"
"Faust," to name a few), it is too bad a greater
improvement could not have been made here.
Disappointing Stage Scenery
The street-scene in Act ll—with its ugly cascading
stairs and a painted back-drop (unworthy of Disney,
let alone Durer) with only the vaguest connection
with the stage-perspective -was quite disappointing.
Act 111 had its infelicities: Sachs' study was rather
bare and had tell-tale ripples in the walls; and for
some insane reason the timbers of the study were
left up for the meadow scene (along with an odd
curlicue affair whose purpose evades me). Again, the
backdrop could have been done by any respectable
sixth-grade class.
The stage direction of Paul Hager, as usual with
him, was innocent of any really strikingly successful
moments and had its share of botches. The
street-riot in Act II was ill-timed and looked like a
slightly rowdy pajama party—and a dull one at that.
Most of the ludicrous minutiae Hager came up with
is bome, I think, of a strangle-hold upon the
obvious: translated to the stage this tends to result
in unsubtlety, if not boorishness.
The one thoroughly enjoyable aspect of the
production is its costumery. Indeed, the huge (and
musically superior) chorus, the well-behaved supers,
and the large cast—so splendidly dressed—saved the
grandeur of the opera. They all made the last 30
minutes the supremely affecting and unforgettable
experience it should be.

Most of the ludicrous minutiae Hager came up with
is bome, I think, of a strangle-hold upon the
obvious: translated to the stage this tends to result
in unsubtlety, if not boorishness.
The one thoroughly enjoyable aspect of the
production is its costumery. Indeed, the huge (and
musically superior) chorus, the well-behaved supers,
and the large cast—so splendidly dressed—saved the
grandeur of the opera. They all made the last 30
minutes the supremely affecting and unforgettable
experience it should be.
It is hard to think of an opera that tests the
vocal, musical, and sheer financial resources of an
opera company more than does Wagner's "Die
Meistersinger von Neurnberg." In its essential
concept, in the populousness of its cast, in the vocal
endurance and profundity it demands (not to
mention its 5-hour length), "Meistersinger" is the
grandest grand opera.
More importantly, this opera is in effect perhaps
the greatest psalm to the power of music as a means
for the ennoblement of life. "Meistersinger"
celebrates, among other things, a city's realization
of the need for and the glory of its own musicians;
and 1 am happy to report that this new production
was a spectacular musical success S.F. can well be
proud of.
The source of success was an almost inundating
excellence of vocalism synchronized by what should
now be recognized as a first-rate Wagnerian
conductor, Otmar Suitner. Under him the comedy
in the score (unlike that on the stage) never grew
limp; he kept pace and control throughout, with
extreme deference to the slightest nuances.
Full, Compact Voice
Leading the cast in the crowning baritone role of
Hans Sachs was Theo Adam. He looked just right
for the part (not too old, handsome and vigorous)
and sang in a full, compact voice that was easily
equal to this arduous role. Otherwise, Adam
presented a perfect Sachs: capable of a variety of
deeply emotional moments, with a core of awesome
gravity, and yet a thoroughly humane man—ein
guter Mensch.
Geraint Evans' comic spree as Beckmesser was so
unfailingly and extravagantly resourceful as to be
almost nerve-wracking: one's eyes tend to remain
glued on him even when the action is elsewhere. He
made Beckmesser the picture of the man in rage for
rules, all his natural emotions constipated, his nerves
utterly frazzled by his own cunning. As for his
singing, well it is perhaps not too much to say that
Evans is the most brilliant singing comedian now.

Heldentenor James King sang a thrilling Prize
Song and had other fine moments. King clearly has
all the necessary vocal apparatus for Wagner, but
this is his debut in the role of Walther, and it still
remains for him to make this difficult, typically
low-IQ tenor role his own and more believable.
As should be clear, the musical values of the
production left nothing to be wished for; the
situation was less happy visually. The old
production was not an offensive one. Neither is this
one, but given the astronomical expense of new
productions and the many S.F. settings which are
really scandalous ("Don Giovanni," "Trovatore,"
"Faust," to name a few), it is too bad a greater
improvement could not have been made here.
Disappointing Stage Scenery
The street-scene in Act ll—with its ugly cascading
stairs and a painted back-drop (unworthy of Disney,
let alone Durer) with only the vaguest connection
with the stage-perspective -was quite disappointing.
Act 111 had its infelicities: Sachs' study was rather
bare and had tell-tale ripples in the walls; and for
some insane reason the timbers of the study were
left up for the meadow scene (along with an odd
curlicue affair whose purpose evades me). Again, the
backdrop could have been done by any respectable
sixth-grade class.
The stage direction of Paul Hager, as usual with
him, was innocent of any really strikingly successful
moments and had its share of botches. The
street-riot in Act II was ill-timed and looked like a
slightly rowdy pajama party—and a dull one at that.
