# Showdown In Los Angeles
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Encouraged by the recoveries
of some key injured players,
Stanford's footballers leave this
afternoon for Los Angeles and
tomorrow night's Pac-8 crucial
with USC. In a fairly big surprise,
Coach John Ralston announced
yesterday that middle linebacker
Jeff Siemon, who has been slowed
with a knee injury, will start
against the Trojans.
Siemon suffered a stretched
posterior capsule in last weekend's
17-7 win over Washington and had
been listed as a doubtful
participant earlier in the week.
Ralston has called Siemon "the
premier linebacker in the
country," and his return to the
line-up could prove quite
important tomorrow night.
Three other players who
missed the Washington game,
linebacker Mike Simone, end Eric
Cross and fullback Hillary
Shockley, will all make the trip
and decisions on suiting any or all
of them up for the game will be
made after a workout tonight at
the Los Angeles Coliseum.
According to Ralston, all three
"looked better" in yesterday's
final closed door workout at
Stanford Stadium.
Ralston Displeased
Ralston hadn't been too
pleased with Tuesday's and
Wednesday's practices, but after
yesterday's workout he said, "It
was a good, very spirited workout.
The tempo was good. This is our
biggest game. We shall be ready."
The Indians will be facing a
USC team which for the first time
in many years, faces virtual
elimination from the Rose Bowl
race after only two league games
if they lose tomorrow. The
Trojans were upset 28-23 by
Oregon last Saturday and they
must win tomorrow to stay in
contention.
The Trojans have also lost to
Oklahoma and Alabama, but
Ralston says, "they're the best
team in the nation with three
losses. Trojan coach John McKay
may or may not be flattered by
such an opinion, but one can be
sure that a man who had lost only
29 games in eleven years isn't too
happy with his team right now.
Oregon Loss
In the loss to Oregon, the
Trojans had apparently won the
game in the final minute when
quarterback Jimmy Jones hit split
end Edesel Garrison for an
apparent 77 yard touchdown. But

the score was nullified because
USC's flanker had lined up on the
line of scrimmage, making the
tight end an ineligible receiver.
McKay didn't show up for
Monday's football writer's
luncheon in Los Angeles and the
cause of his reported sore throat
isn't too hard to figure out. I'm
sure his players won't have any
problems getting up for
tomorrow's game.
As usual, the Trojans aren't
lacking in talent. Jones is a
potentially very fine option
quarterback who has started at
USC for two years. Anyone who
saw Stanford's 26-24 loss to the
Trojans two years ago will
remember Jones' last-minute
heroics which led up to the
Trojan's winning field goal with
no time remaining.
Cunningham Stars
And SC has a lot of other
offensive stars. Ralston calls
fullback Sam Cunningham and
tight end Charles Young, "the
best two juniors in the league."
Speedy tailback Lou Harris is
injured and probably won't play,
but Cunningham may also see
action at that position. As far as

receivers go, Garrison is an
outstanding quartermiler with
incredible speed and flanker Lynn
Swann is also very quick. Swann
however has been slowed by ankle
problems.
Defensively, the Trojans face
some injury problems at
linebacker. Starter Charles
Anthony and his replacement
John Papadakis (who started last
year) are both probably out of
Saturday's game.
Strong Offensively
Basically this year, the Trojans
have been strong on offense, but
have had some problems stopping
other teams. The Oregon team
which beat them was
quarterbacked by second-stringer
Harvey Winn, who didn't show
much against Stanford earlier this
season.
Last year was the year
Stanford broke its jinxes. They
beat USC 24-14 for their first win
over the Trojans since 1957. And
later they beat UCLA in the
Coliseum for their first win there
since 1962. These were the two
crucial steps on the way to last
year's conference championship.
Earlier this year, most experts
pointed to these back-to-back

road games against Washington
and USC as the keys to another
trip to Pasadena. The Indians are
halfway there. A win tomorrow
would make Stanford a heavy
favorite for a second straight Rose
Bowl. Everyone knows that,
especially USC.

USC THREATS- The Thunder Chickens will have to stop the great Trojan runner Sam "Bam"
Cunningham (39) who is shown above running interference in last year's Stanford-USC game. Cunningham
has been averaging around 7 5 yards a game and will lead the Trojan running attack since teammate Lou
Harris is injured and is not expected to start in his tailback position. Jimmy Jones, the USC quarterback,
is shown below evading Stanford's Bill Alexander in last year's game. Jones has established by far the best
completion percentage in the Pac-8 with an amazing .6 21 mark, and will undoubtedly challenge the
Indians in tomorrow night's game.
