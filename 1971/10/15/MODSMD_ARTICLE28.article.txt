# Liberals Scored For Viet Role
## 
### 
"Liberalism is the door to fascism"
was the common theme of three
speakers discussing United States
intervention in Southeast Asia last
night in Jordan Hall.
Franz Schurman, UC-Berkeley Far
East specialist; Douglas Dowd, an
economist with the Bay Area School in
San Francisco and formerly a professor
at Cornell University; and Banning
Garrett of the Pacific Studies Center

and Ramparts magazine, addressed the
crowd of about 125 people.
The three recounted the history of
United States policy toward Southeast
Asia. The program was sponsored by
the Indochina Study Group.
Dowd and Garrett both concluded
on a cautiously optimistic note. Dowd
summed it up by saying, "I'm
essentially hopeful-and worried as

hell." Earlier he had described the
United States today as a "cesspool"
and "a right-wing society trembling on
the edge of developing new and 'liberal'
ways of establishing a dictatorship in
this country."
Following their remarks, the
meeting was enlivened by an
interchange between the speakers and
Jerry Warren, a St. Louis, Missouri,
lawyer who questioned the panel on
Chinese and Russian Communist
genocide and told the speakers, "The
Founding Fathers would have
regurgitated on you people." All the
other questioners except one appeared
to agree with the speakers' point of
view.
