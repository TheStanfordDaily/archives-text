# Franklin Walks Out After Witness Queried On Venceremos Membership
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
Prof. H. Bruce Franklin and his
supporters angrily walked out of
Franklin's dismissal hearing yesterday
after a witness was asked if he were a
member of Venceremos, a
revolutionary group to which Franklin
belongs. Franklin denounced the
session as a "witch hunt."
The witness under questioning was
Frank Silvestri, a friend of the Franklin
family. The suspended professor has
charged that two administration
witnesses misidentified Silvestri as
Franklin at the Lodge incident, Jan. 11.
During Franklin's furious objections
to the membership question, Advisory
Board Chairman Donald Kennedy ruled
that Silvestri need not talk about his

"private membership" in a political
group. But he asked him to answer the
amended question, "Have you at any
time publicly identified yourself as a
member of the organization?"
Franklin walked out, warning, "We
won't participate until that ruling is
reversed." But Franklin and
administration lawyers last night
reached a "tentative agreement" and
expect the hearing to resume at 1 p.m.
today in Physics 101.
When Fisher first asked if Silvestri
belonged to Venceremos, Franklin
shouted, "We're just not going to have
this kind of witch hunt here." Kennedy
answered, "We'll tell you exactly what
you're going to have."
Kennedy, biology department
chairman, then said the Board was in
"substantial agreement" that he had
ruled incorrectly the day before by not
requiring Katherine Barkley to say
whether she had friends in Venceremos.
He explained that the Board earlier
had required administration witnesses
to tell Franklin whether they belonged
to the conservative Free Campus
Movement(FCM).
Franklin answered, "The FCM is not
under investigation by the police;
they're not under any threat by the
fascist authorities."
After the hearing broke up, Franklin
added that he would be willing to have
the questions of FCM membership
stricken from the record.
Jane Franklin, Bruce's wife and
co-counsel, charged "peoples' lives are
changed" by police harassment when
it is learned they belong to
Venceremos. She said that police are
"very stupid people" who would be

listening to the testimony but might
not keep track of an article publicly
signed by a Venceremos member.
Kennedy pointed out that no one
would be forced to answer the
membership question but that the
board would "draw conclusions" from
a refusal to answer.
While Franklin and his aides
repeatedly objected. Fisher asked
whether Silvestri had ever had any
"public affiliation" with Venceremos.
The student said he was not a member
but had "been to rallies put on by
them."
Jane Franklin then walked out.
Several minutes later, Franklin and his
other supporters also refused to
continue.
Fisher insisted last night that he was
only attempting to determine Silvestri's
prejudices. But he added he would stop
asking about group memberships if
Franklin agreed not to protest certain
other questions about prejudice.
Silvestri said he sat next to Bruce
and Jane Franklin and their son Robert
at the Jan. 11 speech bv Henry Cabot
Lodge, former Ambassador to South
Vietnam. Charges against Franklin
include participating in a disruption of
that event.
Silvestri, who was a high school
student at the time, said Franklin
"spoke out only once or twice" during
heckling of the speakers. But Silvestri
testified that his own actions involved
vociferous shouting and clapping.
Silvestri said he stood up and
pointed his finger, shouting at one of
the speakers. And he said he called
someone else at the podium "a Fascist
P'S-

Franklin alleged to the Daily that
Silvestri is the "man in a turtleneck
sweater" whom two administration
witnesses had identified as Franklin.
Silvestri testified he was probably
wearing a "blue sweater." Pictures
show Franklin was wearing an
open-necked shirt.
Franklin was two seats away from
his wife and Silvestri was next to her in
the photos. One of the two elderly
women whose testimony Franklin
challenged said she picked Franklin out
because she knew Jane and assumed the
foreign-looking, "fat man" next to her
was not her husband.
Silvestri looks neither fat nor
foreign, but he appeared to be both
because of the angle in one of the
photographs the women saw after the
incident.
The second of those two
administration witnesses said the man
she thought was Franklin was pointed
out to her by the other woman, and she
could not identify Franklin in the
hearing room.
Two witnesses yesterday agreed witli
Wednesday's witnesses for Franklin.
They said Franklin was sitting apart
from main groups of hecklers and
shouted only several comments. They
also testified that speakers at the
podium "baited" the crowd and did
not need to cancel the speech when
they did.
Janet Weiss, a colleague of Franklin
in Venceremos, said she watched
Franklin and saw him yell only twice.
Weiss conceded she yelled frequently,
shouting "oink," "napalm," and other
comments when they were "relevant."
Under cross-examination, Weiss said
she would lie "to the pigs" to protect
Franklin. But she insisted she was
telling the truth at the hearing to
provide the truth "to the people."
Curtis Knecht, a former Wilbur
sponsor now living in Berkeley, said he
watched Franklin during much of the
protest because "I expected Bruce
Franklin to be yelling and making a lot
of commotion. I didn't see it."
Knecht said the Lodge incident was
"educational." Answering a question
by Franklin about a Franklin course he
took, Knecht said there was "a little

more" academic freedom in Franklin's
classroom but "it seemed to me there
was a very solid Marxist-Leninist line
that we were following."
Franklin's angry objections over
Fisher's questioning did not begin with
Silvestri. When Weiss was asked to
identify people in photos of the Lodge
incident, Franklin co-counsel Yale
Braunstein charged administrator John
Schwartz would bring campus judicial
charges against those identified.
Fisher eventually announced, "I'm
authorized to state on behalf of the
University that it has no intention to
prosecute anyone further in the Lodge
incident."
