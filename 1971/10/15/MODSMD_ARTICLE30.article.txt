historic journey to mainland China.
Press secretary Ronald L. Ziegler, announcing Kissinger's
travel plans yesterday, said the presidential assistant would
stop en route in California, Hawaii, Guam and Shanghai.
Although Ziegler said, "I don't want to suggest anything
to you about the President's trip," it was believed
Kissinger's route would closely—if not exactly- parallel the
Nixon itinerary.

Aid To Israel Increased
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. - Secretary of State William P.

military commitments to Israel because of a new Soviet
promise of more military aid to Egypt.
Rogers discussed U.S. aid policy outside his New York
hotel suite after an hour's conference with the Israeli
foreign minister, Abba Eban.
Eban had said earlier the Soviet promises to Egypt made
resumption of the U.S. warplane shipments necessary.
Iranian Consulate Bombed

the sky.
No one was in the building at the time of the blast and
