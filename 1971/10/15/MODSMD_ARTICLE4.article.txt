# Dean Candidates Sought
## 
### TOM GRAY 
A search committee charged with selecting a new
Director of Student Services has asked for suggestions from
the University community on possible candidates for the
position.
Dr. James McClenahan, Director of Cowell Student
Health Center and Chairman of the eight-member
committee, said the apointee to the new post would take
over the duties of the old Dean of Students and probably
several new responsibilities as well.
Dr. McClenahan said candidates should therefore be
prepared for a job with "vice-presidential" responsibility.
The committee, he said, is trying to find candidates with
administrative experience, interest in and sympathy with
students, and a sense of humor.
Beyond these guidelines, he added, there are no strict
requirements. "We're trying to be quite open about any
sort of person," he stated.
The search committee, made up of two administrators,
two faculty members and four students, was appointed by
President Lyman in June to find a permanent successor to
Dean of Students Peter Buckley, who resigned in Spring of
1970.
Candidates Interviewed
Since June, the committee has interviewed over 60
candidates, Dr. McClenahan said, and has narrowed the
field down to about 25. They expect to have decided on
the final choice by the middle of November.
Serving with Dr. McClenahan are students Tina Swent,
Gail Kennard, Harry Mosley and Charles Peterson; Alberta
Siegel, Associate Dean of Undergraduate Studies; Prof.
Michael Ray of the Graduate School of Business, and Prof.
William Reynolds of the Mechanical Engineering
Department.

McClenahan said it will be up to the appointee and
Lyman to decide just how much responsibility will be
assumed in the new office.
The appointee, he said, may take charge of Tresidder
Union and the University Food Service, in addition to
assuming the former Dean of Student's duties.
These include supervision of residences, counseling, the
Placement Office, and student activities.
The new responsibilities were suggested by an earlier
committee, appointed by President L>inan after the
Buckley resignation to study the reorganization of the
Dean of Students position.
McClenahan said candidates need not be from the
Stanford community, nor need they have had experience
with administration at a college or university.
Administrative Experience
The committee, he said, is looking for persons with
"two years experience in a significant administrative role,' 1
whether in or out of the University.
He added, however, that, "In general, we look for
people who have had some experience in higher education,
or at least show appreciation for the values of higher
education."
McClenahan also suggested that a fairly young man or
woman, between the ages of 30 and 40, would be best for
the position.
Committee member Kennard emphasized that the
Director of Student Services would be the administrator
with the greatest responsibility for student interests.
The job will require a person "tuned in to student
needs" and possessing a good sense of humor. "This is one
of those jobs," she said, "where you get phone calls at
three in the morning. You have to keep smiling."

whether in or out of the University.
He added, however, that, "In general, we look for
people who have had some experience in higher education,
or at least show appreciation for the values of higher
education."
McClenahan also suggested that a fairly young man or
woman, between the ages of 30 and 40, would be best for
the position.
Committee member Kennard emphasized that the
Director of Student Services would be the administrator
with the greatest responsibility for student interests.
The job will require a person "tuned in to student
needs" and possessing a good sense of humor. "This is one
of those jobs," she said, "where you get phone calls at
three in the morning. You have to keep smiling."
A search committee charged with selecting a new
Director of Student Services has asked for suggestions from
the University community on possible candidates for the
position.
Dr. James McClenahan, Director of Cowell Student
Health Center and Chairman of the eight-member
committee, said the apointee to the new post would take
over the duties of the old Dean of Students and probably
several new responsibilities as well.
Dr. McClenahan said candidates should therefore be
prepared for a job with "vice-presidential" responsibility.
The committee, he said, is trying to find candidates with
administrative experience, interest in and sympathy with
students, and a sense of humor.
Beyond these guidelines, he added, there are no strict
requirements. "We're trying to be quite open about any
sort of person," he stated.
The search committee, made up of two administrators,
two faculty members and four students, was appointed by
President Lyman in June to find a permanent successor to
Dean of Students Peter Buckley, who resigned in Spring of
1970.
Candidates Interviewed
Since June, the committee has interviewed over 60
candidates, Dr. McClenahan said, and has narrowed the
field down to about 25. They expect to have decided on
the final choice by the middle of November.
Serving with Dr. McClenahan are students Tina Swent,
Gail Kennard, Harry Mosley and Charles Peterson; Alberta
Siegel, Associate Dean of Undergraduate Studies; Prof.
Michael Ray of the Graduate School of Business, and Prof.
William Reynolds of the Mechanical Engineering
Department.

McClenahan said it will be up to the appointee and
Lyman to decide just how much responsibility will be
assumed in the new office.
The appointee, he said, may take charge of Tresidder
Union and the University Food Service, in addition to
assuming the former Dean of Student's duties.
These include supervision of residences, counseling, the
Placement Office, and student activities.
The new responsibilities were suggested by an earlier
committee, appointed by President L>inan after the
Buckley resignation to study the reorganization of the
Dean of Students position.
McClenahan said candidates need not be from the
Stanford community, nor need they have had experience
with administration at a college or university.
Administrative Experience
The committee, he said, is looking for persons with
"two years experience in a significant administrative role,' 1
whether in or out of the University.
He added, however, that, "In general, we look for
people who have had some experience in higher education,
or at least show appreciation for the values of higher
education."
