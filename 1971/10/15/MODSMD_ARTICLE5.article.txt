When Pierre Boulez, the great
avant-garde composer, was asked
what should be done to improve
opera, his answer was "Blow up
the opera houses."
Anyone who has sat through
six hours of Siegfried chatting
with Brunhilde in German, while
the orchestra plays background
music and quick games of
pinochle, knows what the maestro
had in mind.
But opera is too much fun to
be dismissed completely. The
problem is not so much one of
decay as one of dust. I would say,
rather than "blow them up," we
should perhaps blow them out a
bit.
Opera, of all the living arts,
gives the best imitation of being
dead. The average opera patron is
so conservative, so bound by
tradition and afraid of innovation,
that opera in America is
performed today essentially as it
was performed a hundred years
ago.
The basic repertoire of thirty
or so works, most of which were
written between 1 78 0 and 1910,
has become as sacrosanct as the
Roman Catholic liturgy. Except,
of course, that the Catholic
liturgy can now be recited in the
language of the worshiper. In the
United States, the
opera-worshipper has not reached
that state of liberation.
Edith Wharton, in her novel
"The Age of Innocence," gives an
idea of how far opera has
progressed in the last century.
Miss Wharton describes a

performance by the Swedish
soprano Christine Nilsson at New
York's Academy of Music in the
early 1 8 70 's. Miss Nilsson is
singing the role of Marguerite in
Gounod's "Faust":
"She sang, of course, 'M'ama!'
and not 'he loves me,' since an
unalterable and unquestioned law

of the musical world required that
the German text of French operas
sung by Swedish artists should be
translated into Italian for the
clearer understanding of
English-speaking audiences."
It's obvious that we've come a
long way since then. "Faust" is no
longer sung in Italian, which few
Americans understand, but rather
in the original French, which
makes everything a lot clearer.
The description of Christine
Nilsson singing in "Faust"
reminds me of the first time I saw
"Faust" at the Metropolitan
Opera House in New York six
years ago. At that time I was an
undergraduate, and I and a group
of friends used to mount regular
opera expeditions every few
months or so.
It wasn't easy to see the
Metropolitan in those days (it is

even harder now). Tickets went
on sale at 10:00 a.m. on the
Friday six weeks before the
performance. I would cut a Friday
morning class and get to the Met
at 9:00 to stand in line for an
hour. This, and $5.00, would
make me the proud possessor of a
ticket good for a seat in thu

balcony, about 800 feet from the
stage laterally, and 500 feet
vertically. As often as not, the
ticket would be stamped
"Obstructed View," a fair warning
from the management that I was
seated either behind a pole or so
far down the side of the house
that I would have to imagine half
the opera.
(I didn't mind the poles so
much, as they reminded me of
when I used to sit in the upper
deck of Yankee Stadium. I was
fourteen before I realized that
there wasn't a thick vertical line
running across the infield.)
Now, "Faust" is an opera
about a man who sells his soul to
the devil in return for a second
fling at youth. The devil's ace is a
comely village wench named
Marguerite, whom he promises to
Faust in return for Faust's
immortal spirit.
The night we saw it, a famous
European soprano was making her
debut with the Metropolitan.
Now, this girl had a lovely voice,
but she had a serious problem
which seems to afflict sopranos.
In the first act, she is conjured by
Mephistopheles as a vision, to lure

Faust to his doom. I was watching
the stage through binoculars, a
kind of look-out or spotter for my
friends. "Oh my God," I said,
"Marguerite is fat."
And sure enough, come the
second act, when Marguerite
waddled on to the stage, she was a
mite bit overweight. In fact, she
could have been wheeled on stage
in a hand-truck.
From that moment on,
"Faust" was ruined as an opera.
The music was lively, the
production colorful, the acting on
the whole passable. But no one
could suspend disbelief to the
point of accepting that obese
Marguerite as a sex-object that
would lure a man to eternal
damnation. It was absurd.
What these two examples of
opera comique illustrate is the
contempt traditionally shown in
this country for opera as theater.
Our singers are marvelous—they
should be, we import most of
them from Europe. But if opera
were only music, we could
dispense with the expensive
costumes and sets, the stage
director and the props, and
relegate it to inexpensive concert
performances.
Opera began in this country as
a social event in which the new
American grand bourgeois
attempted to ape his European
betters. And opera remains in this
country what it was a hundred
years ago: a ceremony, a cult,
never-changing, eternal.
If you would like to hear Verdi
sung in Italian, you can go to
Italy, or you can go to San
Francisco. If you would like to
hear Carmen sung in French, you
can go to Paris, or you can go to
the Met. If you would like to hear
any of these operas sung in a
language you understand, go to
England, for there, as in all other
European countries, opera is

enjoyed rather than worshiped,
and almost all operas are sung in
the language of the people.
Europeans seem to be less
worr.v < by old European
traditions than are Americans. La
ScaJa in Milan is notorious for
audiences who are willing to pelt a
poor singer with anything they
can sneak into the theater. In San
Francisco, the opera lover is an
over-dressed votary who knows
far less about music than he
pretends, yells "Bravo" for
sopranos and basses alike, and
impresses his friends with his high
level of culture.
There are a few innovative
companies in this country. The
New York City Opera, which
spawned Beverly Sills, charges a
top price in the neighborhood of

$7.00, as compared to the
Metropolitan's $17.50, and
performs many ol its works in
English, including such sacred
cows as "Don Giovanni" and
"The Magic Flute."
As might be expected,
Metropolitan people don't talk to
New York City Opera people,
even though they occupy
neighboring buildings in Lincoln
Center. Beverly Sills has sung in
all the major European houses,
but she has never been invited to
the Met, and to my knowledge, no
invitation is anticipated.
And Blanche Thebom,
formerly a star with the
Metropolitan, is reported to be
doing some interesting innovative
work in a city in the South,

Atlanta I believe. (There was a
time when Blanche Thebom
kissed me on CBS television, but
that's something else again.)
There is a story about La Seal a,
probably apocryphal. A mediocre
tenor sings an aria, and to
everyone's surprise, the audience
cheers. Responding to the cries of
"encore," he sings it again as
badly as before, and again come
cheers and cries of "encore."
Stepping to the footlights, the
delighted singer bows to the
audience and says "Thank you my
friends, but we must continue."
At which point, a voice from the
balcony bellows out, "You keep
singing it till you get it right!"
At La Scala, opera is
invigorating. Here, it is in Italian.
