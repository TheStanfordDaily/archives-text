# Logic Of Intervention

Editor's Note: The Indochina
study group found this article,
which is reprinted from the Oct.
2, New Yorker, to be a cogent
analysis of their position.
Shortly after the Attica
uprising, Governor Rockefeller, in
response to a reporter's question
about why he hadn't visited the
prison, described a breakdown in
negotiations with the prisoners.
And then, to make a final,
clinching point, he spoke of a
belief that the hostages' lives were
in growing jeopardy at the
prisoners' hands.
A question that virtually asks
itself is: How did mounting fear
for the hostages' lives lead the
authorities to make exactly the
move that was most likely,
according to their own
calculations, to get the hostages
killed.
It is hardly necessary to point
out that this isn't the first time in
recent years that American
authorities have killed their own
people as a result of overeager
pursuit of "enemies." Right down
to minute details, the Attica
massacre followed with uncanny
faithfulness a script that has
governed many other recent
American tragedies.
The pattern proceeds as
follows: In the first stage of the
tragedy, some form of
disorder-almost any form of
disorder, from a student sit-in to a
civil war- breaks out. The
authorities receive, and believe,
exaggerated reports of the
trouble. (For example, the stories
of plans to murder Mayor Daley
at the Chicago Convention, the
stories of snipers at Jackson State,
and the stories of guards
murdered at Attica.) The

authorities then invest the
disorder with a symbolic
importance: "If we let the
stu dents/prisoners/blacks/Com
munists get away with it in this
case, they'll start doing it
everywhere." Each outbreak,
however small, is seen as a perhaps
fatal crack in the structure of
constituted American authority.
Usually, "outside agitators" are
blamed, in order to give the
impression that a perfectly good
lot of, say, students have been
corrupted and used by evil forces,
authorities employ overwhelming,
indiscriminate force to restore
"order," usually killing and
injuring people other than the
ones they meant to kill or injure.
(For example, the killing of
bystanders during the Neward and
Detroit riots, the massacre of
villagers at My Lai, the killing of
bystanders at Kent State, and the
massacre of guards at Attica.)
In the third stage, the
authorities publish accounts of
the event from which the
brutality and lawlessness of their
own people have been expurgated.
(For example, the first Army
reports on My Lai, the grand-jury
report on Kent State, Mayor
Daley's version of the Chicago
Convention, and the initial reports
of throats slashed by prisoners at
Attica.) Soon others—the press,
the victims, investigating
committees, or sometimes lone
individuals—publish accurate
accounts. But a large part of the
public—sometimes most of the
public—goes on believing the
official version.
The fact that situations as
disparate as a civil war in Asia, a
civil-rights demonstration in the
southern United States, a student

sit-in at an American university,
and a prison riot in upstate New
York should begin to unfold
according to a single script as soon
as American authorities step in is
in itself disturbing.
There is bad trouble ahead
when a country's problems can all
be rolled together into one
problem. It means that policy is
going blind—is turning
pathological. All over the world,
our authorities have been giving
their men the order to "go in"
and clean things up. When we "go
in," we enter a private,
self-enclosed, fictional world that
doesn't change. We don't like the
complexity of things, and we
want every disorder to be one in
which force is effective as a last
resort.
Why, we keep asking in
bewilderment, are the people on
our side always getting themselves
mixed up with the people on the
other side? Why are the hostages
mixed up with the prisoners? Why
do the friendly villagers wear the
same kind of clothes as the
unfriendly villagers? Why are our
own children marching with that
disorderly mob? By blinding and
deafening ourselves with our own
gunfire, we get past these
confusions and create a
temporary, false simplicity. We
are never so sure of the identity of
our enemies as when we see the
dim figures running through the
tear gas in the sights of our rifles.
After all, if they aren't our
enemies, why are we shooting
them? We override the disorderly
variety of the world with an
indiscriminately uniform type of
violence.
When we go in, all thought
breaks down, and we can speak of
saving villages by destroying them
and of saving hostages by killing
them. We begin to kill our own
allies, to kill our own people who
are being held as hostages, to kill
our own children. We make up
stories to prove that things are
going the way they should be
going, the way they started going
in our minds when we began
firing. Mountains of the plainest
evidence can't convince us of the
truth. And our people and their
people lie together in a common
grave, brothers in death as they
were brothers in life, had we only
known it.
For anyone interested in
working with the Indochina Study
Group—sponsoring films,
speakers, etc., there will be a
meeting Tuesday, at 8 p.m. in
Tresidder Lounge.
