# Free Will And The Behaviorist
## 
### 
Part Two In A Series
We cannot avoid any longer a
treatment of the problem of free
will and determinism for all
behaviorist psychologists
(including Skinner) are frank
exponents of general determinism.
In Beyond Freedom & Dignity,
Skinner says:"It is the
environment which is 'responsible'
for the . . . behavior" (p. 7 4).
As Goldberg discovered in
trying to make sense of Skinner's
position on free will, the fact that
Skinner is a poor English stylist
and an extremely imprecise user
of language makes it difficult to
pin him down. In his writings,
Skinner attacks the doctrine of
free will, but not always in such a
way that it is clear what view he is
attacking. As Goldberg says,
"Sometimes it is the view that
human actions are spontaneous, at
other times it is that their actions
are the actions of responsible
agents, at still other times it is the

view that human actions are
uncaused." Each of these views is
attacked in the pages of Beyond
Freedom & Dignity.
But it is possible to be a
believer in free will and to hold
that men are responsible agents,
while not holding that human
actions are uncaused. In fact, as
Rothbard puts it, "true science

decrees determinism for physical
nature and free will for man."
First, let us consider why it is
correct to accept determinism in
physical nature. As Andrew Van

Melsen writes in The Philosophy
of Nature: "The reason why
generations of scientists and
philosophers as far back as the
Greeks have always accepted
determinism in matter is obvious.
The effort to establish strict and
universal laws presupposes
determinism .... If, for instance,
sodium did not of necessity react

with chloride in exactly the same
way, it would make no sense to
perform experiments to examine
the properties of sodium and
chloride. The inductive method
presupposes . . . the existence of a
fixed order according to which
individual representatives of a
certain species always act in the
same way under the same
circumstances. And this is exactly
what the term 'determinism'
means. The behavior of anything
with a certain nature is entirely
determined by that nature."
Since I have already said that
consciousness depends on material
reality, or as Van Melsen puts it,
"it is quite clear that a free will
can produce effects only through
the medium of matter," and I
have just argued that we should
accept determinism in matter, am
I thereby committed to the
position , of metaphysical
behaviorism (i.e., materialism)?
No, because every entity must
act in accord with its nature.
Human beings differ in kind from
other entities. Free will,
consciousness, having ideas, and
making choices are attributes of
human beings.
Taking a methodologically
behaviorist view of man, one can
find these attributes manifest in
overt acts. Only human beings
show signs of conceptual thought
and have a language which can
express propositions.
Mortimer Adler shows this in
The Difference of Man and the
Difference It Makes: "If animals
had, through perceptual
abstractions, the disposition to do
more than discriminate between
triangles and circles; if they had
the disposition to recognize this

perceived shape as a triangle and
that perceived shape as a circle,
together with the disposition to
understand what triangles and
circles are like; and if they could
manifest by their observed
behavior the latter disposition
quite apart from perceiving any
shapes whatsoever—then we
would be justified in attributing
concepts to them; for without this
theoretical construct, their
behavior could not be explained.
However... no evidence is
available to show that animals,
over and above the disposition to
discrimination between similar
and dissimilars when presented
with sensible particulars, also have
the disposition to recognize this
one sensible particular as being of
a certain kind and to understand
what kind of thing it is, i.e., to
recognize this particular shape as a
triangle and to understand what
kind of shape a triangle is—in the
absence of perceived triangles as
well as in their presence."
In her essay, "A Theory of
Human and Animal Learning,"
psychologist Magda Arnold
reports findings which are in
agreement with Adler's
contention and says: "Concepts
are formed by abstracting the
essential features of an object and
discovering this feature in a whole
class of related objects .. . Ani
mals can learn at best the names
of individuals but not the names
of a class of individuals."
If we recognize the specifically
human nature of man, we can at
once believe in free will and
believe that human actions are
caused. As Ludwig von Mises puts
it in Theory and History: "The
choices a man makes are
determined by the ideas that he
adopts. The determinists are right
in asserting that everything that
happens is the necessary sequel of
the preceding state of
affairs . . . While the animal
cannot help yielding to the
physiological impulse which
prevails at the moment, man
chooses between alternative
modes of conduct. Man has the
power to choose even between
yielding to the most imperative
instinct, that of self-preservation,
and aiming at other ends. All the
sarcasms and sneers of the
positivists cannot annul the fact
that ideas have a real existence
and are genuine factors in shaping
the course of events."

I would contend that Skinner
himself, in order to distinguish
between genuine and simulated
approval (as he does on p. 34 of
Beyond Freedom & Dignity), must
be viewing mental processes as "a
center from which behavior
emanates" (p. 14).
Needless to say, recognizing
that men have free will means
throwing out the behaviorists'
functional analysis of human
actions. In addition, recognizing
consciousness means throwing out
measurements of "reinforcement
strength." There is first of all no
way to measure refusal to
co-operate at all with the
experimenter, an event which
happens in time rather than
through time in the way a rat's
persistence in pressing a lever after
the supply of food pellets has
been stopped happens through
time.
Secondly, the units of
measurement in behaviorist
learning theory are not true units.
Gasson writes that "as measures
of intensity, they conform only to
the simplest form of ordinal
scale." Rothbard also writes:
"The frantic and vain attempts to
measure intensive psychic
magnitudes in psychology and in
economics would disappear if it
were realized that the very
concept of measurement implies
the necessity for an objective
extensive unit to serve as a
measure. But the magnitudes in
consciousness are necessarily
intensive and therefore not
capable of measurement."
Similarly, Skinner in common
with other behaviorists and
positivists misuses statistics.
Skinner writes: "So far as we
know, any species capable of
learning from a few
reinforcements is subject to
superstition, and the
consequences are often
disasterous. A culture corrects for
this defect when it devises
statistical procedures which offset
the effects of adventious
contingencies and bring behavior
under the control of only those
consequences which are
functionally related to it" (p.
177). But as Mises points out:
"What the statistics of human
actions really show is not
regularity but irregularity .. . not
. . . regularity in the sense which
is attached to the term in the
natural sciences."
