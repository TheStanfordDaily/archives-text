Chauvinism Defined
Editor, THE DAILY:
Last weekend I informed some
militant patriots I know (i.e., four
Birchers, two members of the
VFW, an Elk, and a coach) that a
woman had changed her car's
headlight. Not a one threw up his
(or her) hands. In fact, the most
emphatic response was, "Wull,
thet's raht fahn, ah guess."
I am referring, of course to the
woeful butchery of the English
language in the series of articles
by Ms. Lockheed. As most fools
and some journalists know,
chauvinism has nothing to do with
being male. As used by Ms.
Lockheed, the term is apparently
meaningless. I cite The American
Heritage Dictionary of the English
Language:
chau-vin-ism n. Militant and
boastful devotion to and
glorification of one's country;
fanatical patriotism [French,
chauvinisme, after Nicholas
Chauvin, legendary French soldier
extremely devoted to Napoleon.]
-chauvinist n. -chauvinistic adj.
-chauvinistically adv.

Red's Hot Professor Contest
The Association of Young
Crows will present, this Saturday
night following the Performance
of the Dragon Lady's Revenge,

the TOP TWENTY DEFENSE
CONTRACTS at Stanford
University. Saturday night's
presentation is a prelude to the
first annual RED'S HOT
PROFESSOR CONTEST.
Next week members of the
Young Crows will be manning a
table in White Plaza and handing
out information on the Top
Twenty. Members of the Stanford
Community are invited to vote for
their favorite DOD (Department
of Defense) contracts. Each
positive vote will cost one cent.
Each negative vote will cost sc.
Proceeds will go to pay the
expenses of publications in
support of the contest.
At a rally—not yet
scheduled—later in the month we
will invite the five top vote-getters
to appear at a White Plaza rally.
Each principal investigator will be
asked to explain why his contract
should be the NUMBER ONE
DOD CONTRACT AT
STANFORD. Following the rally,
additional voting will continue
amongst the finalists. At a later
date, the Young Crows will
arrange to present awards to the
winners at their labs or offices.

support of the contest.
At a rally—not yet
scheduled—later in the month we
will invite the five top vote-getters
to appear at a White Plaza rally.
Each principal investigator will be
asked to explain why his contract
should be the NUMBER ONE
DOD CONTRACT AT
STANFORD. Following the rally,
additional voting will continue
amongst the finalists. At a later
date, the Young Crows will
arrange to present awards to the
winners at their labs or offices.
