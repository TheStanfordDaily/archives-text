# Trojans Trampled

### DON TOLLEFSON 
LOS ANGELES—With a thunder and lightning filled sky providing an appropriate
background, Stanford used ahigh-powered offense and their usually rugged
Thunder Chicken defense to overwhelm the USC Trojans 33-18 Saturday night.
For the first time since 195 7 , the Indians could leave the Coliseum with a victory
over SC. And more importantly, the win makes them heavy favorites for another
Rose Bowl trip.
Only Oregon State, who the Indians meet in two weeks in Corvallis, still has a
good chance at a Rose Bowl bid. Due to Cal's NCAA probation, the Bears' games
do not count in the Pac-8 standings this season, so the Beavers 30-2 7 loss to Cal a
week ago doesn't really matter. In their only league game so far, the Beavers beat
UCLA to give them a 1 -0 record.
Regardless of what happens in this weekends OSU-Washington and
Stanford-Washington State games, Oregon State would take the conference lead
by beating Stanford. On Saturday, the Beavers beat 11th ranked Arizona State
24-18 and ended the Sun Devils 21 game winning streak. Oregon State is not a
team to be overlooked.
USC doesn't really have to concern themselves with this Rose Bowl matter any
more. Their loss on Saturday gives them an 0-2 record and all but mathematically
eliminates them from the title race. The Trojans have fallen a long way in one
short year. And it all began twelve months ago in Stanford Stadium.
Before October 10 th of last year, the Trojans had not lost in 25 regular season
games, with only a 21-21 tie with Nebraska blemishing their record. But everyone
knows that Stanford beat them 24-14 on that day. SC's troubles had only begun.

CLEAN SWEEP—Jackie Brown sweeps the right end after taking a pitch-out from Don Bunce who is leading the interference. John Winesberry, who carried the ball
successfully on many sweeps against the Trojans, also helps block for Brown. Stanford's surprising implementation of a full-house backfield and a power sweep was the
key to the Indian rushing game that ran over the hapless Trojans for 264 yards.
They lost three of their last six
games last year and are 2-4 this
season. They have some typically
fine athletes playing for them, but
they are not functioning well as a
complete team. The USC
mystique is at least temporarily
gone. Not many traces of it were
evident on Saturday night.
In the typical tradition of USC
injury reports, those players listed
as doubtful all week somehow
recovered around 7:30 Saturday
night. They could've stayed in
bed.

As 65,375 chilled fans looked
on, Stanford started off with a
full-house backfield utilizing
flanker John Winesberry as a
running back. USC had trouble
adjusting to this innovation which
Stanford had worked on in secret
practices all week and the Indians
drove straight down the field in a
13 play, 63 yard touchdown
drive.
Brown Leads March
Halfback Jackie Brown did
most of the running, gaining 4 3
yards in seven carries, as Stanford
threw only once on that drive.
Quarterback Don Bunce did run
twice on that drive, with his
second attempt good for two
yards and the touchdown.
On the following kickoff, Rod
Garcia continued the strategy
used in the Washington game of

kicking low, line-drive kicks to
prevent long runbacks. His first
kick hit a USC lineman and was
recovered by Stanford's Mike
Kloos on the Trojan 4 7.
Stanford moved quickly down
to the one, but on a fourth down
play, Reggie Sanderson was nailed
by linebacker Charles Anthony at
the line of scrimmage.
After short and uneventful
drives by both teams, Steve
Murray's punt was taken by
Trojan flanker Lynn Swarm on his
own seven and returned 7 3 yards
to the Indian 20. Swann had an
incredible wall of blockers going
up the right sideline, but Stanford
fullback Jim Kehl made a
fantastic individual effort to get
to Swann.
Kehl's Big Play
Kehl's saving tackle may have
been the biggest play of the game.
It gave the Thunder Chickens a
chance to prove themselves and
once again they did so amazingly.
After short gains by fullback Sam
Cunningham and tailback Lou
Harris and an illegal procedure
penalty, blitzing defensive
halfback Charlie McLoud nailed
quarterback Jimmy Jones for a 13
yard loss. The Trojans were then
out of their kicker's field goal
range and were forced to punt.
How big Kehl's play looked then.
The Indians didn't move far on
their next drive, but after the
Trojans lost ten yards in four
plays and punted, the Cards took
over on the USC 32. Four plays
later, Garcia converted a 33 yard
field goal for a 10-0 lead.
USC's next drive ended when
defensive back Tim Robnett
intercepted a Jones pass intended
for tight end Chris Vella on the
SC 38 and returned it to the one.
Brown finally scored on his third
running attempt and Stanford
had a 17 -0 halftime lead.
The halftime statistics were

remarkable. USC's league leading
offense came into the game
averaging over 4 00 yards per
game. In the first half, they were
held to 50 yards rushing and 2
yards passing. Stanford's rushing
and passing figures were 102 and
71 respectively.
Neither team was very
successful offensively in the third
period. Garcia missed a 24 yard
field goal, but other than that,
both teams spent much of their
time in their own half of the field.
Near the end of the quarter,
the Indians began a drive at their
own 31 which culminated in a
touchdown three plays into the
fourth quarter. The big play on
the drive was a roughing the
kicker penalty on USC, which
enabled the Indians to retain
possession at their own 45.
Jones Benched
Down 20-0, Coach John
McKay benched his senior
quarterback Jimmy Jones. Jones
had entered the game with a
62.1 % completion figure for the
season. His name had been a
subject of conversation among the
Stanford front four all weekend.
And Jones won't forget those
Thunder Chickens. Their fine rush
and some outstanding coverage
held Jones to a total of 3
completions In 8 attempts for 2
yards.
His replacement, Mike Rae,
was a bit more successful. In less
than a quarter, he completed 7 of
12 passes for 164 yards and 2
TD's. The first score came on a 4 6
yard pass to speedy split end
Edesel Garrison. But Stanford
came right back on an 80 yard
touchdown run in which Bunce
ran for 10 yards before pitching
to Sanderson who went the final
70.
With about five minutes to go,
a good 24 yard punt return by
Charles Hinton and a personal
foul penalty on Stanford gave the
Trojans the ball on the Indian 13.
On their second play, Rae passed
to tight end Charles Young for 11
yards and their second score.
On the next SC drive,
linebacker Jim Merlo intercepted
a Rae pass on the 32 and ran it
back to the Trojan 14. A personal
foul penalty on the Trojans

moved the ball to the 7 and two
plays later, third string running
back Vic Larnmanuzzi, who suited
up in place of the injured Hillary
Shockley, went over from the
one.
With time running out, Rae
passed his team down to the
Stanford one, where Cunningham
scored with only 14 seconds to
go. Rae had led the Trojans to 18
points in less than 15 minutes, but
it didn't make much difference.
As many people had said, the
Trojans had some fine offensive
players and can score. But their
defense has a lot of trouble
stopping people and they are
definitely not a complete team.
At least for now, football
prominence in California has
moved 400 miles north. People
who had said that Stanford won
the league title last year only
because of Jim Plunkett, have
been proven wrong. The talk in
the Coliseum press box was of a
highly-touted USC freshman team
which had destroyed a reportedly
good Cal team, 45 -14 . It was nice
to .see SC people talk about next
year. For the second year in a
row, 1971 belonged to Stanford.

NOT A TROJAN IN SIGHT—Don Bunce faked a handoff into the line
and rolled around his left end unmolested to cap the Indians' 63 yard
touchdown drive in the first quarter. Bunce's statistics (9 of 19 for
123 yards) were not spectacular, but his outstanding leadership earned
him player of the game honors. A Trojan kicked Bunce in the head
late in the game, but the injury is slight and will not prevent him from
starting against the Cougars.

SIGN OF THE TIMES—This ironic note of despair was found on a bulletin board in a USC lounge
immediately after the Indians' cnishing victory over the Trojans, 33-18. After four consecutive trips to the
Rose Bowl, USC ticket office last year began inserting a Rose Bowl Coupon in each season ticket-holder's
booklet. It appears that the Indians have deflated the Trojan's bowl balloon and forced a few policy
changes along the way. Hopefully the Trojans will abandon this annual display of arrogance in the form of
a Rose Bowl coupon in favor of a policy more consistent with their most recent football fortunes.
