# Trojans Trampled

LOS ANGELES—With a thunder and lightning filled sky providing an appropriate
background, Stanford used ahigh-powered offense and their usually rugged
Thunder Chicken defense to overwhelm the USC Trojans 33-18 Saturday night.
For the first time since 195 7 , the Indians could leave the Coliseum with a victory
over SC. And more importantly, the win makes them heavy favorites for another
Rose Bowl trip.
Only Oregon State, who the Indians meet in two weeks in Corvallis, still has a
good chance at a Rose Bowl bid. Due to Cal's NCAA probation, the Bears' games
do not count in the Pac-8 standings this season, so the Beavers 30-2 7 loss to Cal a
week ago doesn't really matter. In their only league game so far, the Beavers beat
UCLA to give them a 1 -0 record.
Regardless of what happens in this weekends OSU-Washington and
Stanford-Washington State games, Oregon State would take the conference lead
by beating Stanford. On Saturday, the Beavers beat 11th ranked Arizona State
24-18 and ended the Sun Devils 21 game winning streak. Oregon State is not a
team to be overlooked.
USC doesn't really have to concern themselves with this Rose Bowl matter any
more. Their loss on Saturday gives them an 0-2 record and all but mathematically
eliminates them from the title race. The Trojans have fallen a long way in one
short year. And it all began twelve months ago in Stanford Stadium.
Before October 10 th of last year, the Trojans had not lost in 25 regular season
games, with only a 21-21 tie with Nebraska blemishing their record. But everyone
knows that Stanford beat them 24-14 on that day. SC's troubles had only begun.

CLEAN SWEEP—Jackie Brown sweeps the right end after taking a pitch-out from Don Bunce who is leading the interference. John Winesberry, who carried the ball
successfully on many sweeps against the Trojans, also helps block for Brown. Stanford's surprising implementation of a full-house backfield and a power sweep was the
key to the Indian rushing game that ran over the hapless Trojans for 264 yards.
