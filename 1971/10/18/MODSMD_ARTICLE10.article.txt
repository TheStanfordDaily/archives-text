# Protest The Hoover Conference
## 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
Members of the Stanford
Community have become aware
this weekend of an unpublicized
two-day conference to be
presented by the Hoover
Institution this Monday and
Tuesday from 9 to 5 in the Large
Lounge of Tresidder Union. Its
title, "Iranâ€”2s Centuries of
Achievement," echoes the theme
of the Shah of Iran's "Big Silk
Tent Bash," as the New York
Times calls the opulent party
(costing perhaps as much as 400
million dollars) that has just
ended at Persepolis and which our
own Vice President Agnew has
left in order to attend other
festivities in fascist Greece.

Iranian students in this country
and others critical of the Shah's
regime, including such aspects of
it as the grinding poverty in which
most Iranians live, the
repressiveness of the government
and the brutality of the Secret
Police, with their massive
imprisonment, torture and
execution of students and workeis
who have criticized the regime,
have been refused an opportunity
to participate in what clearly is
planned by the Hoover Institution
as a closed conference to develop
propagandistic support for the
government of the Shah.
Stanford faculty and students
should join in protest against this
misuse of student facilities and

the attempt to link the prestige of
Stanford University's name with
an event so obviously one-sided in
its political implications. Hoover
should modify its program to
include diverse points of view,
among them that of the Iranian
Student Association of the U.S.
The present program is not only
"unbalanced"; it is an offense
against the ideal of free speech on
campus. It provides no mechanism
for the testing of ideas, for
confrontation of different points
of view, for any of the procedures
of open inquiry and criticism that
are essential to the quest for truth
in a free university.
