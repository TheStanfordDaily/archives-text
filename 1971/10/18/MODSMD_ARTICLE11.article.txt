# Student Senate Candidate's Election Statements
## 
### 
Following are statements
submitted to the Daily by
candidates for the student Senate.
We regret that only about one-half
of the candidates submitted
statements before the Friday
deadline. Elections will be held
Thursday and Friday.
The Coalition for Community
Control believes that every human
being has the right to effectively
participate in the decisions which
directly affect his life.
The Board of Trustees has
the ultimate decision making
authority in the Stanford
Community. Sixty percent of the
Board of Trustees are on the
boards of war related companies,
twenty-three of the twenty-five
are white males, and their
decisions reflect their common
interests.
We are running for the senate
because we think Stanford, and
the Stanford Community, should
be controlled by those who live
and work in it. The university
invests in war companies and does
defense research because it is
profitable. The results of Stanford
research are killing people in
Indochina this very moment. The
companies that are represented by
our Trustees and that Stanford
invests in, are the same companies
that are exploiting the resources
and the people of the third world
and are providing the technology
to protect their "investment." We
reject their attempts to hand us
(and the Stanford faculty and
workers), their definition of an
academic community, tailored for
theif personal gain.
We feel that Stanford land
must be used for day-care centers,
low income housing, and other
purposes that serve the
community, rather than military
industrial development. We will
work to achieve an end to all
DOC) sponsored research at
Stanford.
We support an end to racist
and sexist admissions, hiring, and
pay policies. We support the
struggle of groups attempting to
change Stanford along these lines
and condemn the repression that
Stariford has brought down upon
students, faculty, and workers
who are attempting to change its
class bias nature.

Along these lines we propose
control of police by all the
Stanford Community, rehiring of
workers fired for political reasons,
rehiring of Bruce Franklin, and
abolition of the S.J.C. and all
quasi-legal bodies of its nature.
The people who control Stanford
make the laws in this country, if
their own laws are not sufficient
to surpress campus dissent they
have no right to enforce their own
entirely arbitrary discipline on
dissenting elements.
As members of the ASSU
senate and the Stanford
community we will work to
implement these changes which
will transform this institution into
one that serves and is controlled
by the people that it affects.

Q is comprised of a group of
undergraduates who believe that
the ASSU Senate can establish
programs which will improve the
quality of the physical and
academic environment of the
Stanford community.
To insure quality
representation, we propose that a
regular Senate newsletter be
printed and that bi-weekly
meetings be held by Senators in
their academic constituencies.
To insure quality of
instruction, we believe that the
Senate should sponsor an
independent course evaluation
program which would be made
available to all members of the
academic community. Such public
evaluation programs already exist
at many universities including
Harvard and San Jose State.
The Senate should also
conduct a review of the Study of
Graduate education at Stanford
report, which is due in April, and
aid in the implementation of
programs recommended by the
Senate review.
In face of the University's
obligation to minority education,
the Senate must work for
expanded minority admissions
and also seek the expansion of

minority study and tutorial
programs.
To insure a higher quality of
life for all residents in the
Stanford area, the Senate should
advocate that future land use
planning be designed to emphasize
moderate and low income
housing, open space preservation,
and recreational use.
Finally,, since means tend to
define ends, we feel that violence
on the part of students, outside
elements, or the university is
intolerable.

The representation of Asian
Americans in particular and of
Third World people in general at
Stanford University must be
increased. When Third World
people have been allowed into the
University, they have been

concentrated into subordinate
positions. As the symbolic voice
of the student body, the ASSU
Senate should press for greater
participation in the University by
people of color at all levels,
student, faculty, and staff.
This would be realized in
practice through the student
representatives appointed by the
Senate to the various University
committees, and through studies
and reviews undertaken through
the auspices of the Senate. In
particular, search committees for
faculty and staff openings should
have increased student and Third
World participation to help
correct this situation.
Jeffrey Y. Sue
As an Amerasian, I feel deeply
concerned about the status of all
Third World people. The Senate
should ensure that minority
interests receive proper
consideration at all levels of
University functioning, including
educational programs,
administrative personnel and
policy, and the condition of
workers. I support the struggle of
peoples of color throughout the
University and would work on
their behalf.
One cannot deny that Stanford
land is a valuable asset. Future
plans for undeveloped areas
should reflect consideration of the

entire community. The present
need for low-rent housing must be
met; otherwise land should be
preserved in its natural state and
opened to the community.
Finally, I strongly feel that the
University should put forth a
more concerted effort toward
maintaining the University as a
free and open forum. First, all
Santa Clara County Sheriff's
deputies should be removed from
campus. Second, more clearly
defined guidelines are needed for
determining "threats" to the
University and for subsequent
action by the Administration.

I'm a new student at Stanford.
I don't know what kinds of
bickerings and double-dealings
have gone on in the ASSU in the
past and, quite frankly, I don't
care to know. I DO care about
trying to get the ASSU to
function the way it is supposed to
function—as a body representing
and serving the needs of ALL, not
just certain groups of the students
at Stanford. I can see no reason
why Stanford, having the

intelligent student body that it
has, cannot have a
correspondingly student
government.
As a new student, I'll be less
susceptable to pressures which
might sway others; no one is going
to force me into doing anything
which I don't personally feel is
right. As a senator I intend to
serve as a strong, rational,
moderate voice. I'd appreciate
your help.

The Senate's power trip was
the direct cause of the $0 program
fee adopted by the student body.
Three Senate power blocs,
minority, radical, and right-wing,
formed momentary and politically
expedient alliances to arrive at
decisions that in no way reflected
most students' opinions. The
student body must have a
responsive and responsible Senate
so that we can assume our rightful
power in University decisions. I
oppose all slates; slates were a
main cause of the politicizing of
the Senate last year.
My candidacy is also primarily
for freshmen. I am on the Arroyo
(freshman coed) staff and feel
that Senators should be available
and receptive to their
constituencies. Freshmen have
traditionally provided the energy
for activity at Stanford, but they
have been effectively screened
from power and leadership
positions.
John Coghlan
The Student Senate should
provide positive and intelligent
leadership for students in
endeavors which are of interest to
students. It should also reflect
student opinion and try to
propagate student viewpoints on
local, state, and national issues. In
view of these general goals, my
platform for the 1971 -1972
school year is: 1) to work to
provide leadership for student
endeavors, 2) to work to provide
means of reflecting student
opinion in local, state, and
national issues, and 3) to work to
provide hand-outs explaining
affirmative and negative
arguments on local, state, and

national issues applicable to
students.
Hopefully, all of these points
will be fulfilled during the school
year so that the Student Senate
may draw closer to realizing its
general goals.
Dan Cummings
Vicki Drake ran a few years
ago for ASSU President on her
measurements. I won't run on
mine because "it ain't what you
got but what you do with what
you've got." Last year's dubious
achievement of four female
senators out of the 40 in the
ASSU shows that it's about time
that the female population on
campus be proportionately
represented. That's why I'm
running—Garfield under General
Studies.
Beth Garfield
I am a candidate for the
upcoming ASSU elections because
I am particularly interested in
seeing the Senate become more
responsive to the needs of all
members of the Stanford
community, especially third world
students. For this reason, I fully
endorse the referendum, in which
students will be asked to vote for
a $1 fee, which will go primarily
to cultural activities for 3rd world
groups. I feel that this would be
beneficial to those groups
involved and also to the larger
Stanford community by providing
them with an opportunity to
appreciate more the cultural
plurality of our community.
There is no doubt that the
procedures now associated with
the SJC are inadequate and
cannot provide justice for
students. Lack of student peer
representation, double jeopardy
and the presidential prerogative
are aspects which need
re-examination.
These are only a few of the
aims I would work for if elected
to the ASSU Senate.
