# 'The King Is Dead'
## 
### HALL DAILY CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
Commentary to
The Los Angeles Times seemed to properly assess the new power
from Palo Alto's impact on the decaying fortunes of the USC Trojans
Saturday night. In elucidating upon Pete Lazetich's comment that
playing Troy in the Coliseum was no special thrill anymore, the Times
said, "That's probably because USC, the old king, is dead. And the
new king is beginning to realize how very good he really is."
While it is evident that the Trojans will be back next year, the fact
is that they will have nowhere to go but up after this one. On the
field, the evidences of deterioration included three major incidents:
Mike Rae's uncalled-for assault on former Stanford football player
Wade Killefer along the Indian sidelines, a severe facemasking of Pete
Lazetich late in the game, and John McKay's last minute effort to
have his first string score on Stanford's second string defense.
Off the field, the Trojan fans insulted not only their owi team but
the Palo Alto visitors as well. After booing SC's all-time total offense
leader Jimmy Jones for half a quarter, the ungrateful Trojan fans
greeted his departure from the game with cheers. Earlier, the L.A. fans
had refused to cheer their hometown bands during the half-time show.
In a final note, a campus-wide appeal for ringers brought all the SC
heavies down to Bovard Field Saturday morning as the Daily Trojan
beat up the Stanford Daily 18-7.
Adding insult to injury, the SC students in a magnanimous gesture,
tried to cart away their Stanford visitors in cattle trucks to a free
party ($3) with unlimited beer (17,000 cans) after having pre-sold
5000 tickets to SC students.
