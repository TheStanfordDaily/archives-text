# USC Finds They Can't Win Against Any Stanford Team
## 
### CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
Stanford's water polo and cross
country teams joined the football
squad in the trampling of the
Trojans last weekend as Indian
teams enjoyed a highly successful
two days of competition in
Southern California.
Saturday was a black day for
the University of Southern
California. Coach Marshall Clark's
cross country team ran away from
USC and UCLA on the Bruin's 6.1
mile Westwood course. The Cards
finished first with 27 points,
UCLA placed second with 40, and
the Trojans were a distant third
with a score of 56.
Duncan Mac Donald set a new
course record in winning the race
with a time of 31:11. A USC
runner finished second but
Stanford's Bernie Lahde and
Robert Coe filled third and fourth
places with times of 31:36 and
31:41.
Kretz Improves
Arvid Kretz showed that he is
rounding into shape as he finished
strong to take seventh place for
the Indians in the time of 31:51.

Freshman Kurt Schoenrock closed
out Stanford's scoring with a
twelfth place finish and a clocking
of 32:44.
Clark was pleased with the
team's performance but cautioned
that his men will have to bring
their times closer together in
order to fare well against powerful
Washington State University next
week.
Oregon and WSU have finished
1-2 in the last two Pac-8
championships and are favored to
duplicate that feat again this year.
The Indian's convincing victory
over the Bruins and Trojans places
them right behind the Ducks and
Cougars in the Pac-8 race.
Poloists Split
Coach Jim Gaughran's water
poloists dominated USC Saturday
and breezed to an 8-3 win in the
Trojan pool. The Cards suffered
the only Stanford loss of the
weekend in Southern California
on Friday night when the UCLA
poloists scored in the third
overtime to take home a 12-11
sudden death win.
Rick Massamino scored ten of
Stanford's 19 goals over the
weekend, seven of them coming in
the UCLA game. The Cards
moved into the lead many times
in the contest, but the determined
Bruins always managed to catch
up and scored last-minute goals to
first send the game into overtime
and then into sudden death.
Mike Davis, Rob Wooley, Ken

Hammer, and Randy Wilkins all
scored one goal apiece in the
UCLA game to complete
Stanford's scoring.
Massimino Stars
Massamino scored three goals
in the Indian's decisive victory
over (JSC. Gaughran's squad had
little trouble containing the
Trojans, and it appears as if USC
will not figure in the NCAA
championship competition later in
the season.
Davis netted two goals against
Troy, and Hammer, Bill Simkins,
and Stu Rowe, each scored one.
Stanford will face both
Southern California teams again
when they travel to the Indian
pool later in the season. After this
past weekend's competition,
however, Stanford, UCLA, and
San Jose State, have emerged as
the West Coast squads that will
figure prominently in the NCAA
Championships.
Defending NCAA Champion,
Irvine, has beaten the Bruins, but
has lost to Stanford and USC and
is not favored to defend its title.
San Jose State, on the other hand,
beat the Indians in the finals to
win the De Anza tournament
earlier this season and must be
considered a national power.
Soccer
The Stanford soccer team was
the only squad to stay on campus
this weekend, and they lost to Cal
by the score of 4-1. Rocky Barber
scored the only Indian goal.

West Coast.
