Riot In Pittsburgh
PITTSBURGH — Riot-equipped police seated off
downtown Pittsburgh Sunday night after tens of
thousands of surging, shouting persons mounted a
wild celebration in honor of the Pirates' World Series
victory in Baltimore.
Officers said one person was shot and several
others injured in rock and bottle-throwing as the
celebration grew. The shooting victim was wounded
when an unidentified man began firing a shotgun,
police said.
The uninhibited crowds scaled lightpoles, set olf
fireworks, overturned cars, started bonfires, shattered
store windows and looted some business
establishments at the outburst's height. At least two
police cars were commandeered by pennant-waving
pedestrians, and police said a fire truck was stripped.
At least a dozeft rapes were reported, police said.
In one, witnessed by a newsman unable to prevent it,
a half-dozen youths dragged a dark-haired young
woman from a car and assaulted her in the middle of
fifth avenue.
Another young woman, this one a blonde, stripped
from the waist up and danced atop a car. Several men
stripped completely and danced in the uncontrolled
spray of broken fire hydrants.
Police brought in dogs and used fire hoses in an
attempt to control the masses, but to little avail.

H. Rap Brown Recovering
NEW YORK — H. Rap Brown, the black militant on
the FBl's "mpst wanted" list for 17 months, was
reported in fair condition Sunday after abdominal
surgery following a shoot-out with police during a bar
room-crap game-holdup.
Held in $150,000 bail each for hearings Monday
were Sam Petty, 23, of St. Lo\iis, reportedly Brown's
bodyguard, and two other men.
Brown's attorney, William Kunstler, refused to
identify his client, but police, who took his
fingerprints, said:
"We are going on the assumption that no two sets
of fingerprints are identical and, as far as we are
concerned, this man is H. Rap Brown."
From his bed in Roosevelt hospital, Brown, 28,
was charged by telephone with attempted homicide,
robbery and possession of a dangerous weapon.

Soldier Killed In Ireland
BELFAST 4 Northern Ireland — A British soldier was
shot dead from a guerrilla ambush in a Roman
Catholic district of Belfast Sunday. He was the third
trooper to die in Northern Ireland during a weekend
of riots, bombings and gun battles.
A big army buildup was under way, meanwhile, in
a bid to halt the escalating attacks by outlaws of the
Irish Republican Army.
The latest victim was with a foot patrol in the
Ballymurphy area. He was hit by one of seven bullets
fired from the ambush.
The two other soldiers died during the weekend
after being shot by snipers in Belfast and
Londonderry, Northern Ireland's second city.
In one of the weekend battles, a civilian gunman
was killed and two senior police officers were badly
wounded.
The death toll stood at 126 since this British
province erupted into sectarian violence in the
summer of 1969.

Held in $150,000 bail each for hearings Monday
were Sam Petty, 23, of St. Lo\iis, reportedly Brown's
bodyguard, and two other men.
Brown's attorney, William Kunstler, refused to

of fingerprints are identical and, as far as we are
concerned, this man is H. Rap Brown."

was charged by telephone with attempted homicide,
robbery and possession of a dangerous weapon.

Soldier Killed In Ireland
BELFAST 4 Northern Ireland — A British soldier was
shot dead from a guerrilla ambush in a Roman
Catholic district of Belfast Sunday. He was the third
trooper to die in Northern Ireland during a weekend
of riots, bombings and gun battles.
A big army buildup was under way, meanwhile, in
a bid to halt the escalating attacks by outlaws of the
Irish Republican Army.
The latest victim was with a foot patrol in the
Ballymurphy area. He was hit by one of seven bullets
fired from the ambush.
The two other soldiers died during the weekend
after being shot by snipers in Belfast and
Londonderry, Northern Ireland's second city.
In one of the weekend battles, a civilian gunman
was killed and two senior police officers were badly
wounded.
The death toll stood at 126 since this British
province erupted into sectarian violence in the
summer of 1969.

store windows and looted some business
establishments at the outburst's height. At least two
police cars were commandeered by pennant-waving
pedestrians, and police said a fire truck was stripped.
At least a dozeft rapes were reported, police said.
