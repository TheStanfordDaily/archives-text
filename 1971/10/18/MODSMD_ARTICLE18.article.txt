Speaking at the 16th annual
conference of the American Society for
Quality Control in Cubberley
Auditorium on Saturday, keynote
speaker Christopher Bayley, King
County Prosecuting Attorney claimed
that "enforcement of the law is a spur
to improve the quality of our daily
lives."
Bayley spoke on the theme
"Consumer Protection and Quality
Control for Consumer Products," and
said "Law enforcement and quality
control are part of a national
movement toward quality in the lives
of all U.S. citizens."
He went on to say that the
environmental issue is akin to the
consumer problem and the failure in
these two areas rises from "local law
enforcement people who are not aware
of the laws to police abuses of
environment and consumerism."
Bayley claimed that the solution to
the problem is adequate enforcement
of existing laws on the local level and
not creation of more laws.
Francis Armstrong from the
Department of Transportation's Office
of Standards Enforcement spoke on the

complexity of his office. He claimed
that three of the major constraints his
office faces are "the cost resulting from
laboratory testing and purchase of
samples, difficulty in determining
actual reliability and carrying out
non-compliance action against faulty
manufacturers."
Armstrong stressed that his office is
limited and said "quality is not created
by the sampling plan employed."
