# Potential Nominee List Attacked By Law Profs
## 
### GARY ATKINS 
President Nixon's list of potential
Supreme Court nominees came under
fire from a group of 29 Law School
professors here this weekend.
The group, which includes two
deans and 10 former Supreme Court
clerks, said the names reportedly
submitted to the American Bar
Association for evaluation did not meet
the "appropriate criteria" for Supreme
Court justices.
In a statement issued Saturday, the
faculty members said, "The President
has repeatedly expressed his belief that
Supreme Court vacancies should be
filled with nominees of the highest
possible distinctionâ€”nominees who, for
the sake of the Court and the nation,
should be capable of evoking the widest
possible respect."
"In our judgment, on the evidence
available to us, the present list does not
satisfy the appropriate criteria."
Profs Signing
Among those signing the statement
were Thomas Ehrlich, law school dean;
Carl B. Spaeth, former dean; Herbert L.
Packer, former vice provost for
academic programs; John Kaplan,
author of Marijuana Reconsidered;
Anthony Amsterdam, well-known civil
rights lawyer and Gerald Gunther, a
national expert in constitutional law.
The White House has reportedly
submitted six names for evaluation to
the ABA's Judicial Fitness Committee:
Judge Sylvia Bacon, a trial judge on the
Superior Court for the District of
Columbia; Sen Robert C. Byrd of West
Virginia, Senate Democratic whip;
Judge Charles Clark, a member of the
U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals;
Herschel H. Friday, a municipal bond
lawyer in Little Rock, Ark.; Judge
Mildred Loree Lillie, a member of the
California Court of Appeals in Los
Angeles; and Judge Paul H. Roney, a
member of the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court
of Appeals.
The ABA committee is to study the
qualifications of the six and make a
confidential report to Attorney General
John Mitchell. President Nixon has said
he will announce his nominees for the
two Supreme Court vacancies sometime
this week.
Prof. Gerald Gunther said the 29 law
faculty who signed the statement
critical of the potential nominees had
studied biographical data and cases in
which the nominees who are judges had
been involved.
'Varied Views'
"I'm quite sure those who signed the
statement have varied views of the

exact qualifications" of Supreme Court
justices, Gunther said. But, he said he
thought all agreed that a nominee
should be distinguished and thoughtful.
"I personally support the President's
notion of appointing a strict
constructionist to th? court,"he said.
"My entire objection goes to the
quality of that constitutional
conservative. I think we can have a man
who fills those qualities of
independence and thoughtfulness."
The statement is being sent to
President Nixon, the California
Congressional delegation and the
Senate Judiciary Committee, he said.
Other signers of the statement were:
Michael R. Asimow, Douglas Ayer,
Wayne Barnett, John H. Barton, Paul
M. Bator, Paul Brest, William Cohen,
Dale Collinson, Marc Franklin, Jack
Friedenthal, Lawrence Friedman,
Robert Girard, Thomas Grey, J. Myron
Jacobstein, Richard Markovitz, John
Merryman,
Robert Rabin, Yosal Rogat,
Kenneth Scott, Byron Sher, George
Torzsay-Biber, Howard Williams and
Michael Wald.
