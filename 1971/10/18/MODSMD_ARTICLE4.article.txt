# 'Bruce Wasn't Noisy'
## Jane Franklin Testifies 
### PHIL REVZIN 
Sophomore Peter Geier told the
Advisory Board Saturday that two
prosecution witnesses had "created a
much greater disruption than professor
Franklin" during Henry Cabot Lodge's
speech January 11.
Geier testified that he had sat
directly in front of Franklin during the
speech, and heard Franklin speak only
three times, during the speeches
preceding Lodge's.
He said that he and a friend had not
shouted or clapped during the speeches,
and that "two women seated near us
kept turning around and telling us to be
quiet. After the speech was cancelled
they told us they had seen us yell and
would report us to the police."
Geier identified the women in a
photograph of the Dinkelspiel
audience, and University attorney Ray
Fischer stipulated that the women were
Mrs. Beckwith and Mrs. Matthews, who
had previously testified for the

administration that they had seen
Franklin shout and stand up during
Lodge's speech.
Geier also testified that a middle
aged man who tried to grab a red flag in
front of professor Franklin "created
the biggest disturbance of all."
Campbell Today
Franklin indicated that the defense
plans to call Hoover Institution director
W. Glenn Campbell as its first witness
when the hearing resumes today at 1
p.m.
Other witnesses Friday and Saturday
testified that they had seen Franklin
sitting quietly throughout Lodge's
speech, and had seen him shout once
during Glenn Campbell's speech, and
once during Berkeley Thompkin's
speech.
At the beginning of Friday's session,
Fischer said that the administration
would not ask any further witnesses
about membership in Venceremos.
Jane Franklin, in testimony which
began Friday and carried over to
Saturday, testified that "I was noisy
that day but Bruce wasn't."
Deliberately Refrained
She added that she had been
chanting and clapping, and "wouldn't
necessarily have noticed if you
(Franklin) had been or not. You had
told me afterwards though, that you
had deliberately refrained from making
noise."
Franklin asked his wife if he would
have lied aobut his part in the events,
and she said that he would not have.
Jane Franklin testified that she had
worked at the United Nations in
1955-1956, and had seen Lodge there.
She remembered Lodge's seemingly
aristocratic attitude, and recalled that
he only spoke to the head secretary,
rather than the other secretaries.
Remarks
She also said that during Campbell's
speech, Bruce had shouted "Napalm"

in response to a remark by Campbell,
and "What about politeness at My Lai,"
in response to a remark addressed to
Franklin by Thompkins.
"We had discussed the fact that the
University was trying to find a way to
get rid of Bruce, and had discussed his
being careful in taking part in public
demonstrations," she added.
Other witnesses Saturday included
former Foothill College student
Stephen Kessler, who testified that
"Franklin just sat there the whole time
during the speeches."
Surprise, Surprise
Amber Wolffe, a student at Foothill,
testified that "Franklin wasn't doing
anything during the speeches." She
heard him shout the remarks during
Campbell and Thompkins' speeches.
Wolffe said that she "was surprised that
the straight people in the audience were
surprised that there was heckling."
She added that "nobody's freedom
of speech was denied, and Lodge could
have gone on."
Sophomore Theresa Ramirez,
suspended after the Lodge incident,
testified that she had been seated three
seats from Franklin, and that she had
chanted and clapped throughout the
program.
Ramirez said that "Bruce was
behaving himself" and that Franklin
had shouted twice. She said "I was
ashamed that the straight women
around us were shouting and making
more noise than the chanters were able
to."
Not Ashamed
Ramirez added that she was not
ashamed of her conduct, and if she had
been a Vietnamese student that "would
have been the least that I would have
done to a man like Lodge."
Friday
Friday's witnesses included Sandra
Kahn, staff member of Connections, a
San Francisco based prisoner aid
organization, who testified that "most
of the disruption seemed to come from
the stage."
Also testifying were Paul Wolf, who
said that he noticed "an irate lady"
seated near Franklin during the
speeches, and Mark Savin, graduate
student in English, who said that he
thought "there was not sufficient noise
in the auditorium to prevent a speaker
from speaking if he had wanted to."
Sandra Peterson, a graduate of
Stanford who recently returned from
Cuba, said that she had entered
Dinkelspiel angry, and wished she had
done more to Lodge than just heckle.
She said that she had seen Franklin
shout twice, and had not seen him
clapping or chanting.
