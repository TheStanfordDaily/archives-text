# Few Grad Candidates
## Senate Elections Begin Thursday 
### 
A student election to choose the
new members of the ASSU Senate as
well as to vote on two fee assessments,
one for a minority affairs group and
another for the Stanford Children's
Center, will take place on Thursday and
Friday of this week.
In the election for seats on the
student Senate, however, there are no
candidates who will run from the
constituency comprising the Graduate
School of Engineering and School of
Earth Sciences, which hold six of the
forty seats in the Senate as a whole.
Of the twenty seats which are
designated for graduate students, only

half of these, ten seats, will be filled.
The School of Education, which
holds two seats, has no candidates for
election, and two other graduate
constituencies are lacking a student
candidate to fill their allotment.
Last Year
By contrast, last year's election
filled all the seats of the graduate
student half of the Senate. There are 56
candidates for the 20 undergraduate
seats, while only 13 graduate students
will run for the ten seats they can fill.
Despite the lack of graduate
candidates, Alice Furumoto, Elections
Commissioner, says there will be no

attempt made to find more. The Senate
is already assured of its quorum of 21
senators, she says.
The two fee assessments have been
placed on the ballot partly because last
spring students voted to give "zero
dollars" for student programs, leaving
the ASSU Senate no money to allot to
campus organizations.
A collection of Black, Chicano,
American Indian, and Asian and
Asian-American student groups will ask
for a one dollar per student assessment
for the winter and spring quarters of
this school year.
Equally Divided
The money is to be divided up
equally between four organizations, the
Black Student Union (BSU); the
Chicano Student Organization,
MECHA; the Asian-American Student
Alliance; and the American Indian
Program.
A Minorities Affairs Commission
will be formed upon passage of the fee
assessment in order to supervise the
allotment of the money as well as
providing a framework for future
co-operation between the groups.
A one dollar per student assessment
for the Winter quarter is being asked by
the Children's Center of the Stanford
Community, entering its third year of
operation, in order to provide low-cost
child care for faculty, staff, and
students.

The actual operation of the Senate
will not be hampered by the student
program fee of zero dollars, since the
machinery of the ASSU, including the
Senate and the ASSU offices in
Tresidder, are financed separately by
money received directly from the
University
There are two major announced
slates which are campaigning for seats
in the Senate, besides the different
individuals taking part in the election.
One slate of 15 undergraduates calls
itself "Q" to signify their concern for
quality education and quality student
participation in University governance.
Second Slate
A second slate of 11 candidates,
the Coalition for Community Control,
takes a radical stance advocating the
abolition or drastic reform of the
Stanford Judicial Council, termination
of Department of Defense research at
the University, and an end to racism
and sexism on campus.
The BSU is not running a slate of its
own this year as it has in previous
years, and instead is offering a general
endorsement of all Black and Third
World candidates.
A list of all the Senate candidates,
along with position statements from
those who gave them to the Daily, can
be found inside today and tomorrow's
paper.
