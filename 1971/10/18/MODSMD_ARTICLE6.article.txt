## 
### 
Iranian students protesting th"
elaborate worldwide celebration of the
2500 th anniversary of the Persian
empire, plan to picket a conference on
Iran today sponsored by the Hoover
Institution.
The program titled: "Iran: 25
Centuries of Achievement" is being
presented by the Hoover Institution on
War, Revolution and Peace today and
tomorrow in the Tresidder Large
Lounge.
According to a spokesman from the
Berkeley headquarters of the Iranian
Student's Association in Northern
California, plans call for the students to
start picketing the opening of the
conference at 9 a.m. today. The
spokesman, A. Hobaroz, said the
"Iranian students will attempt to go in
the conference and describe the true
view of Iran."
He contends that the two-day
conference is trying to "show progress
and that life is good in Iran .. . which it
isn t.
The conference sessions, open to the
public and free according to Hoover
Information Officer Jim Hobson, last
from 9 to 1 2 each morning and from 2
to 5 each afternoon.
Hobson noted that questions and
answers will be allowed after each
speaker.
Venceremos Rally
In addition, Venceremos, a
Marxist-Leninist revolutionary
organization based in Redwood City,
has called for a "support rally" at noon
in White Plaza today to protest the
Hoover conference.
The Iranian students have called for
help from "progressive students"
because the "Shah of Iran is a dictator
and a puppet of the U.S. Government,"
according to Mobaroz.
Mobaroz called the international
celebration, of which the conference is
a part, is a "political celebration"
which is trying to "misinform the

people." He contends that the students
will give "the correct view of the
Shah."
This morning's session will be
welcomed by W. Glenn Campbell,
director of Hoover, and Dr. Parviz
Adle, Consul General of Iran in San
Francisco. The consul building in San
Francisco was bombed last Thursday
causing an estimated $800,000 in
damage. Adle has blamed the bombing
on student political radicals who have
demonstrated against the consulate in
the past two years.
Friday, about 275 demonstrators
marched to within a block of the
Iranian consulate protesting the Shah
of Iran's sumptuous banquet of the
century. Many wore paper bags over
their heads attempting to conceal their
identities allegedly to protect
themselves from Iranian secret police.
Bay Area Demonstration
Today's picketing and
demonstration are a part of
demonstrations all over the Bay Area
including the Friday march.
In a guest column in today's Daily
opinion page, Jim Shoch, who
identifies himself as the "Grand
Inquisitor," has charged that the
"Institute (Hoover) is sponsoring a
conference to legitimize the autocratic
rule of the Shah of Iran, U.S.
imperialism's most faithful ally in the
Mid-East."
He sees a correlation between the
Iran Conference and last year's
conference on the United Nations in
which Henry Cabot Lodge, former U.S.
ambassador to South Vietnam, was
prevented from speaking by hecklers.
The conference is funded by the
general funds of the Hoover Institution
"with some support from the Iranian
consulate," according to Hobson.
The conference has mainly speeches
on historical and cultural aspects of
Iran today and on politics in Iran
tomorrow, Hobson said.

Hoover conference.
The Iranian students have called for
help from "progressive students"
because the "Shah of Iran is a dictator
and a puppet of the U.S. Government,"
according to Mobaroz.
Mobaroz called the international
celebration, of which the conference is
a part, is a "political celebration"
which is trying to "misinform the

people." He contends that the students
will give "the correct view of the
Shah."
This morning's session will be
welcomed by W. Glenn Campbell,
director of Hoover, and Dr. Parviz
Adle, Consul General of Iran in San
Francisco. The consul building in San
Francisco was bombed last Thursday
causing an estimated $800,000 in
damage. Adle has blamed the bombing
on student political radicals who have
demonstrated against the consulate in
the past two years.
Friday, about 275 demonstrators
marched to within a block of the
Iranian consulate protesting the Shah
of Iran's sumptuous banquet of the
century. Many wore paper bags over
their heads attempting to conceal their
identities allegedly to protect
themselves from Iranian secret police.
Bay Area Demonstration
Today's picketing and
demonstration are a part of
demonstrations all over the Bay Area
including the Friday march.
In a guest column in today's Daily
opinion page, Jim Shoch, who
identifies himself as the "Grand
Inquisitor," has charged that the
"Institute (Hoover) is sponsoring a
conference to legitimize the autocratic
rule of the Shah of Iran, U.S.
imperialism's most faithful ally in the
Mid-East."
He sees a correlation between the
Iran Conference and last year's
conference on the United Nations in
which Henry Cabot Lodge, former U.S.
ambassador to South Vietnam, was
prevented from speaking by hecklers.
The conference is funded by the
general funds of the Hoover Institution
"with some support from the Iranian
consulate," according to Hobson.
The conference has mainly speeches
on historical and cultural aspects of
Iran today and on politics in Iran
tomorrow, Hobson said.
Iranian students protesting th"
elaborate worldwide celebration of the
2500 th anniversary of the Persian

According to a spokesman from the
Berkeley headquarters of the Iranian
Student's Association in Northern
California, plans call for the students to
start picketing the opening of the
conference at 9 a.m. today. The
spokesman, A. Hobaroz, said the
"Iranian students will attempt to go in
the conference and describe the true
view of Iran."
He contends that the two-day
conference is trying to "show progress
and that life is good in Iran .. . which it
isn t.
The conference sessions, open to the
