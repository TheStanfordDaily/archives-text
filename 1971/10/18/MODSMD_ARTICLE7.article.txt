# B. F. Skinner's Theory Of Values And Emotions
## News in Review 
### Bill Evers 
Third In A Series
Skinner's discussion of values
in Beyond Freedom & Dignity is
confused and self-contradictory.
But it is possible to discern, after
careful examination, that he is
traveling two different avenues in
explaining what the good is.
Traveling along the first
avenue, we proceed as follows:
"good things are positive
reinforcers" (p. 103); "goods are
reinforcers" (p. 145); and "things
are good (positively reinforcing)
or bad (negatively reinforcing)
presumably because of the
contingencies of survival under
which the species evolved" (p.
10 4). That is to say that man as a
species has been evolving so as to
combat anti-survival stimuli.
At times, Skinner is saying that
men do in fact universally
consider stimuli on the basis of an
evolutionally-constructed,
genetically built-in system for
responding to stimuli as either
positively reinforcing or aversive.
In Walden Two, Skinner's
behaviorist hero Frazier says:
"The philosopher in search of a
rational basis for deciding what is
good has always reminded me of
the centipede trying to decide
how to walk. Simply go ahead and
walk! Wc ail know what's good,
until we r.top to think about it."
On the other hand, on the
same avenue we notice Skinner
saying, "Not everyone finds the
same things good" (Beyond
Freedom & Dignity, p. 106). Here
he is saying that evolution isn't
over yet and that the masochists,
martyrs, and suicides who are
positively reinforced by
anti-survival stimuli will weed
themselves out in the meanwhile.
Cultural Relativism
In this case, Skinner is saying
that stimuli should be (as opposed
to are) considered as positively

reinforcing or as aversive in terms
of the survival of the species. On
grounds of strict methodological
behaviorism when he observes a
masochist receiving positive
reinforcement from being
whipped, he has no business
terming this behavior "aversive
self-stimulation" (as he does in
Science and Human Behavior).
It is in this context of the
survival of the species that

Skinner suggests that one can
recognize one culture as better
than another (p. 145 ).
Skinner does travel another
avenue in explaining what the
good is. He takes a position of
cultural relativism: "What is good
in one culture may not be good in
another" (p. 128). Now if goods
are reinforcers and reinforcers
were differentiated into positive
and negative in response to the
contingencies of survival of the
species, then culturally relative
goods are impossible.
Blatant Contradictions
Thus Skinner's system has led
him down these two avenues into
a position where he is blatantly
contradicting himself.
In any case, it is difficult to
take Skinner's philosophical
stance seriously, because the very
scientific method that he lauds
assumes free will. As Rothbard
puts its: "The determinists profess
to be able, some day, to
determine what men's choices and

actions will be. But, on their own
grounds, their own knowledge of
this determining theory is itself
determined. How can they aspire
to know all, if the extent of their
own knowledge is itself
determined, and therefore
arbitrarily delimited? In fact, if
our ideas are determined, then we
have no way of freely revising our
judgments and of learning
truth—whether the truth of

determinism or of anything else."
There is only one route to
finding a standard of good which
is at once scientific, objective, in
accord with the survival of the
human species, and capable of
evaluating every culture. This is
the route Skinner has explicitly
rejected (pp. 5-6). It is the route
of eudaemonistic ethics: One
should live a life that can be
recognized as really (not just
apparently) good, when looked at
as a whole.
Self Examined Life
This is the sum total of the
good that is demanded of one;
and all other goods, as Mortimer
Adler points out in The Time of
Our Lives, "ought to be sought as
constitutive parts of a whole good
life." It is only the self-examined
life, lived in accord with reason,
that is worth living.
I have two more points to
make about Skinner's Utopian
proposals, and I take these points
from Goldberg's thoughtful 196 4
review of Walden Two. One point
concerns the quasi-logical
structure of human emotions; the
other might be called the problem
of levels of value generality.
Feelings and emotions serve a

definite purpose in human beings.
In their essay, "Feelings and
Emotions as Dynamic Factors in
Personality Integration," Arnold
and Gasson say that an emotion is
a "felt tendency toward an object
judged suitable, or away from an
object judged unsuitable" This
felt tendency is accompanied by
"specific bodily changes according
to the type of emotion."
Feelings And Emotions
They go on to say: "The
individual must perceive and judge
the object in relation to himself
(as suitable or unsuitable, good or
bad for himself) before an
emotion can arise. The emotion
will follow this judgment, whether
or not it is correct." For example,
the fact that "emotion does
depend on the evaluation of the
situation, on its meaning for the
individual, can be observed in a
person's reaction to a sudden
sharp noise: the startle reflex
comes first, without any emotion;
if the noise is recognized as that
of a car backfiring, there is no
further disturbance, but if the
person discovers that it was a shot
aimed at him, there will come fear
with its accompanying physical
sensations, which are very
different from the sensations
connected with the startle reflex."
Underlying all such evaluations
of objects as suitable or unsuitable
for one's self (and all subsequent
emotional feelings) is one's
estimation of one's self-worth.
In his novel, Walden Two, a
fictional account of a behaviorist
Utopia, Skinner puts the following
account of emotions and the
possibility of behavioral
conditioning of certain kinds of
emotions, in the mouth of his
behaviorist hero Frazier:
Conditioned Emotions?
"As to emotions—we aren't
free of them all, nor should we
like to be. But the meaner and
more annoying—the emotions
which breed unhappiness—are
almost unknown here, like
unhappiness itself. We don't need
them any longer in our struggle

for existence, and it's easier on
our circulatory system, and
certainly pleasanter, to dispense
with them." To the objection that
emotions are fun, Frazier replies,
"Some of them, yes. The
productive and strengthening
emotions—joy and love. But
sorrow and hate—and the
high-voltage excitements of anger,
fear, and rage—are out of
proportion with the needs of
modern life, and they're wasteful
and dangerous. Mr. Castle has
mentioned jealousy—a minor form
of anger, I think we may call it.
Naturally we avoid it."
It is clear from these passages
that Skinner believes that it is
possible to condition out certain
kinds of emotions. But I would
contend that there is not even a
theoretical possibility of doing
this.
Let us consider an example
which Goldberg uses to show the
difficulty with Skinner's theory of
emotions:
Joy And Sorrow
"Skinner wants to retain joy
(because it is productive) and
eliminate sorrow(because it isn't).
"Under what circumstances
might one experience joy? Well
suppose one has not seen one's
mother for twenty years.

"One goes to meet the plane
on which she is expected to arrive.
The door opens, she descends the
stairs and comes running to meet
one, arms outstretched, tears in
her eyes.
"Presumably, on this occasion
one is happy, joyful, and the
inspiration provided enables one
that very evening to make some
important new contribution to
knowledge.
"But suppose that just as one is
about to embrace one's mother,
an unknown assailant shoots her
in the back. Doesn't one then feel
at least sorrow, or even grief? Is
one neutral? Indifferent?
Atomistic States
"Isn't it obvious that joy and
sorrow are not atomistic states
with no stronger connection than
that they are both emotions? .. .
But if that's true, then it doesn't
even make sense to suppose that
one could condition people never
to experience the one and always
(or almost always) to experience
the other.
"The principle (illustrated by
this example) is that many
emotions have what might be
called quasi-logical counterparts.
Pairs such as love-hate,
joy-sorrow, happiness-unhappiness
are familiar. To suppose that

(whatever technique one might
employ) one could condition out
one member and leave the other
intact is to believe a fiction."
I would further point out that
Skinner is wrong to divide
emotions like joy and sorrow into
the productive and the
unproductive. Arnold and Gasson
say: "We must bear in mind that a
'negative' emotion and the
'negative' movement involved in it
are in fact positive states—there is
actually something going on. The
movement is called negative
because it is away from whatever
provokes it. But this movement is
not simply away from the
undesirable object or state.
"It is reasonable to argue that
this movement is as much positive
(toward something) as it is
negative (away from the
undesirable), because even on the
principle of sheer mechanical
evolution of the organism, survival
is the function of avoidance
reactions. Thus the negative
movement is always toward
something better, not simply
away from the present evil ....
Sadness, which at first glance
seems to be wholly depressing, has
a positive bearing: a heading
toward something—anything—
constructive and elating."

behaviorism when he observes a
masochist receiving positive
reinforcement from being
whipped, he has no business
terming this behavior "aversive
self-stimulation" (as he does in
Science and Human Behavior).
It is in this context of the
survival of the species that

Skinner suggests that one can
recognize one culture as better
than another (p. 145 ).
Skinner does travel another
avenue in explaining what the
good is. He takes a position of
cultural relativism: "What is good
in one culture may not be good in
another" (p. 128). Now if goods
are reinforcers and reinforcers
were differentiated into positive
and negative in response to the
contingencies of survival of the
species, then culturally relative
goods are impossible.
Blatant Contradictions
Thus Skinner's system has led
him down these two avenues into
a position where he is blatantly
contradicting himself.
In any case, it is difficult to
take Skinner's philosophical
stance seriously, because the very
scientific method that he lauds
assumes free will. As Rothbard
puts its: "The determinists profess
to be able, some day, to
determine what men's choices and

actions will be. But, on their own
grounds, their own knowledge of
this determining theory is itself
determined. How can they aspire
to know all, if the extent of their
own knowledge is itself
determined, and therefore
arbitrarily delimited? In fact, if
our ideas are determined, then we
have no way of freely revising our
judgments and of learning
truth—whether the truth of

determinism or of anything else."
There is only one route to
finding a standard of good which
is at once scientific, objective, in
accord with the survival of the
human species, and capable of
evaluating every culture. This is
the route Skinner has explicitly
rejected (pp. 5-6). It is the route
of eudaemonistic ethics: One
should live a life that can be
recognized as really (not just
apparently) good, when looked at
as a whole.
Self Examined Life
This is the sum total of the
good that is demanded of one;
and all other goods, as Mortimer
Adler points out in The Time of
Our Lives, "ought to be sought as
constitutive parts of a whole good
life." It is only the self-examined
life, lived in accord with reason,
that is worth living.
I have two more points to
make about Skinner's Utopian
proposals, and I take these points
from Goldberg's thoughtful 196 4
review of Walden Two. One point
concerns the quasi-logical
structure of human emotions; the
other might be called the problem
of levels of value generality.
Feelings and emotions serve a

definite purpose in human beings.
In their essay, "Feelings and
Emotions as Dynamic Factors in
Personality Integration," Arnold
and Gasson say that an emotion is
a "felt tendency toward an object
judged suitable, or away from an
object judged unsuitable" This
felt tendency is accompanied by
"specific bodily changes according
to the type of emotion."
Feelings And Emotions
They go on to say: "The
individual must perceive and judge
the object in relation to himself
(as suitable or unsuitable, good or
bad for himself) before an
emotion can arise. The emotion
will follow this judgment, whether
or not it is correct." For example,
the fact that "emotion does
depend on the evaluation of the
situation, on its meaning for the
individual, can be observed in a
person's reaction to a sudden
sharp noise: the startle reflex
comes first, without any emotion;
if the noise is recognized as that
of a car backfiring, there is no
further disturbance, but if the
person discovers that it was a shot
aimed at him, there will come fear
with its accompanying physical
sensations, which are very
different from the sensations
connected with the startle reflex."
Underlying all such evaluations
of objects as suitable or unsuitable
for one's self (and all subsequent
emotional feelings) is one's
estimation of one's self-worth.
In his novel, Walden Two, a
fictional account of a behaviorist
Utopia, Skinner puts the following
account of emotions and the
possibility of behavioral
conditioning of certain kinds of
emotions, in the mouth of his
behaviorist hero Frazier:
Conditioned Emotions?
"As to emotions—we aren't
free of them all, nor should we
like to be. But the meaner and
more annoying—the emotions
which breed unhappiness—are
almost unknown here, like
unhappiness itself. We don't need
them any longer in our struggle

for existence, and it's easier on
our circulatory system, and
certainly pleasanter, to dispense
with them." To the objection that
emotions are fun, Frazier replies,
"Some of them, yes. The
productive and strengthening
emotions—joy and love. But
sorrow and hate—and the
high-voltage excitements of anger,
fear, and rage—are out of
proportion with the needs of
modern life, and they're wasteful
and dangerous. Mr. Castle has
mentioned jealousy—a minor form
of anger, I think we may call it.
Naturally we avoid it."
It is clear from these passages
that Skinner believes that it is
possible to condition out certain
kinds of emotions. But I would
contend that there is not even a
theoretical possibility of doing
this.
Let us consider an example
which Goldberg uses to show the
difficulty with Skinner's theory of
emotions:
Joy And Sorrow
"Skinner wants to retain joy
(because it is productive) and
eliminate sorrow(because it isn't).
"Under what circumstances
might one experience joy? Well
suppose one has not seen one's
mother for twenty years.

"One goes to meet the plane
on which she is expected to arrive.
The door opens, she descends the
stairs and comes running to meet
one, arms outstretched, tears in
her eyes.
"Presumably, on this occasion
one is happy, joyful, and the
inspiration provided enables one
that very evening to make some
important new contribution to
knowledge.
"But suppose that just as one is
about to embrace one's mother,
an unknown assailant shoots her
in the back. Doesn't one then feel
at least sorrow, or even grief? Is
one neutral? Indifferent?
Atomistic States
"Isn't it obvious that joy and
sorrow are not atomistic states
with no stronger connection than
that they are both emotions? .. .
But if that's true, then it doesn't
even make sense to suppose that
one could condition people never
to experience the one and always
(or almost always) to experience
the other.
"The principle (illustrated by
this example) is that many
emotions have what might be
called quasi-logical counterparts.
Pairs such as love-hate,
joy-sorrow, happiness-unhappiness
are familiar. To suppose that

(whatever technique one might
employ) one could condition out
one member and leave the other
intact is to believe a fiction."
I would further point out that
Skinner is wrong to divide
emotions like joy and sorrow into
the productive and the
unproductive. Arnold and Gasson
say: "We must bear in mind that a
'negative' emotion and the
'negative' movement involved in it
are in fact positive states—there is
actually something going on. The
movement is called negative
because it is away from whatever
provokes it. But this movement is
not simply away from the
undesirable object or state.
"It is reasonable to argue that
this movement is as much positive
(toward something) as it is
negative (away from the
undesirable), because even on the
principle of sheer mechanical
evolution of the organism, survival
is the function of avoidance
reactions. Thus the negative
movement is always toward
something better, not simply
away from the present evil ....
Sadness, which at first glance
seems to be wholly depressing, has
a positive bearing: a heading
toward something—anything—
constructive and elating."
Third In A Series
Skinner's discussion of values
in Beyond Freedom & Dignity is
confused and self-contradictory.
But it is possible to discern, after
careful examination, that he is
traveling two different avenues in
explaining what the good is.
Traveling along the first
avenue, we proceed as follows:
"good things are positive
reinforcers" (p. 103); "goods are
reinforcers" (p. 145); and "things
are good (positively reinforcing)
or bad (negatively reinforcing)
presumably because of the
contingencies of survival under
which the species evolved" (p.
10 4). That is to say that man as a
species has been evolving so as to
combat anti-survival stimuli.
At times, Skinner is saying that
men do in fact universally
consider stimuli on the basis of an
evolutionally-constructed,
genetically built-in system for
responding to stimuli as either
positively reinforcing or aversive.
In Walden Two, Skinner's
behaviorist hero Frazier says:
"The philosopher in search of a
rational basis for deciding what is
good has always reminded me of
the centipede trying to decide
how to walk. Simply go ahead and
walk! Wc ail know what's good,
until we r.top to think about it."
On the other hand, on the
same avenue we notice Skinner
saying, "Not everyone finds the
same things good" (Beyond
Freedom & Dignity, p. 106). Here
he is saying that evolution isn't
over yet and that the masochists,
martyrs, and suicides who are
positively reinforced by
anti-survival stimuli will weed
themselves out in the meanwhile.
Cultural Relativism
In this case, Skinner is saying
that stimuli should be (as opposed
to are) considered as positively

reinforcing or as aversive in terms
of the survival of the species. On
grounds of strict methodological
behaviorism when he observes a
masochist receiving positive
reinforcement from being
whipped, he has no business
terming this behavior "aversive
self-stimulation" (as he does in
Science and Human Behavior).

should live a life that can be
recognized as really (not just
apparently) good, when looked at
as a whole.
Self Examined Life
This is the sum total of the
good that is demanded of one;
and all other goods, as Mortimer
Adler points out in The Time of
Our Lives, "ought to be sought as
constitutive parts of a whole good
life." It is only the self-examined
life, lived in accord with reason,
that is worth living.
I have two more points to
make about Skinner's Utopian
proposals, and I take these points
from Goldberg's thoughtful 196 4
review of Walden Two. One point
concerns the quasi-logical
structure of human emotions; the
other might be called the problem
of levels of value generality.
Feelings and emotions serve a

definite purpose in human beings.
In their essay, "Feelings and
Emotions as Dynamic Factors in
Personality Integration," Arnold
and Gasson say that an emotion is
a "felt tendency toward an object
judged suitable, or away from an
object judged unsuitable" This
felt tendency is accompanied by
"specific bodily changes according
to the type of emotion."
Feelings And Emotions
They go on to say: "The
individual must perceive and judge
the object in relation to himself
(as suitable or unsuitable, good or
bad for himself) before an
emotion can arise. The emotion
will follow this judgment, whether
or not it is correct." For example,
the fact that "emotion does
depend on the evaluation of the
situation, on its meaning for the
individual, can be observed in a
person's reaction to a sudden
sharp noise: the startle reflex
comes first, without any emotion;
if the noise is recognized as that
of a car backfiring, there is no
further disturbance, but if the
person discovers that it was a shot
aimed at him, there will come fear
with its accompanying physical
sensations, which are very
different from the sensations
connected with the startle reflex."
Underlying all such evaluations
of objects as suitable or unsuitable
for one's self (and all subsequent
emotional feelings) is one's
estimation of one's self-worth.
In his novel, Walden Two, a
fictional account of a behaviorist
Utopia, Skinner puts the following
account of emotions and the
possibility of behavioral
conditioning of certain kinds of
emotions, in the mouth of his
behaviorist hero Frazier:
Conditioned Emotions?
"As to emotions—we aren't
free of them all, nor should we
like to be. But the meaner and
more annoying—the emotions
which breed unhappiness—are
almost unknown here, like
unhappiness itself. We don't need
them any longer in our struggle

for existence, and it's easier on
our circulatory system, and
certainly pleasanter, to dispense
with them." To the objection that
emotions are fun, Frazier replies,
"Some of them, yes. The
productive and strengthening
emotions—joy and love. But
sorrow and hate—and the
high-voltage excitements of anger,
fear, and rage—are out of
proportion with the needs of
modern life, and they're wasteful
and dangerous. Mr. Castle has
mentioned jealousy—a minor form
of anger, I think we may call it.
Naturally we avoid it."
It is clear from these passages
that Skinner believes that it is
possible to condition out certain
kinds of emotions. But I would
contend that there is not even a
theoretical possibility of doing
this.
Let us consider an example
which Goldberg uses to show the
difficulty with Skinner's theory of
emotions:
Joy And Sorrow
"Skinner wants to retain joy
(because it is productive) and
eliminate sorrow(because it isn't).
"Under what circumstances
might one experience joy? Well
suppose one has not seen one's
mother for twenty years.

"One goes to meet the plane
on which she is expected to arrive.
The door opens, she descends the
stairs and comes running to meet
one, arms outstretched, tears in
her eyes.
"Presumably, on this occasion
one is happy, joyful, and the
inspiration provided enables one
that very evening to make some
important new contribution to
knowledge.
"But suppose that just as one is
about to embrace one's mother,
an unknown assailant shoots her
in the back. Doesn't one then feel
at least sorrow, or even grief? Is
one neutral? Indifferent?
Atomistic States
"Isn't it obvious that joy and
sorrow are not atomistic states
with no stronger connection than
that they are both emotions? .. .
But if that's true, then it doesn't
even make sense to suppose that
one could condition people never
to experience the one and always
(or almost always) to experience
the other.
"The principle (illustrated by
this example) is that many
emotions have what might be
called quasi-logical counterparts.
Pairs such as love-hate,
joy-sorrow, happiness-unhappiness
are familiar. To suppose that

(whatever technique one might
employ) one could condition out
one member and leave the other
intact is to believe a fiction."
I would further point out that
Skinner is wrong to divide
emotions like joy and sorrow into
the productive and the
unproductive. Arnold and Gasson
say: "We must bear in mind that a
'negative' emotion and the
'negative' movement involved in it
are in fact positive states—there is
actually something going on. The
movement is called negative
because it is away from whatever
provokes it. But this movement is
not simply away from the
undesirable object or state.
"It is reasonable to argue that
this movement is as much positive
(toward something) as it is
negative (away from the
undesirable), because even on the
principle of sheer mechanical
evolution of the organism, survival
is the function of avoidance
reactions. Thus the negative
movement is always toward
something better, not simply
away from the present evil ....
Sadness, which at first glance
seems to be wholly depressing, has
a positive bearing: a heading
toward something—anything—
constructive and elating."
Third In A Series
Skinner's discussion of values
in Beyond Freedom & Dignity is
confused and self-contradictory.
But it is possible to discern, after
careful examination, that he is
traveling two different avenues in
explaining what the good is.
Traveling along the first
avenue, we proceed as follows:
"good things are positive
reinforcers" (p. 103); "goods are
reinforcers" (p. 145); and "things
are good (positively reinforcing)
or bad (negatively reinforcing)
presumably because of the
contingencies of survival under
which the species evolved" (p.
10 4). That is to say that man as a
species has been evolving so as to
combat anti-survival stimuli.
At times, Skinner is saying that
men do in fact universally
consider stimuli on the basis of an
evolutionally-constructed,
genetically built-in system for
responding to stimuli as either
positively reinforcing or aversive.
In Walden Two, Skinner's
behaviorist hero Frazier says:
"The philosopher in search of a
rational basis for deciding what is
good has always reminded me of
the centipede trying to decide
how to walk. Simply go ahead and
walk! Wc ail know what's good,
until we r.top to think about it."
On the other hand, on the
same avenue we notice Skinner
saying, "Not everyone finds the
same things good" (Beyond
Freedom & Dignity, p. 106). Here
he is saying that evolution isn't
over yet and that the masochists,
martyrs, and suicides who are
positively reinforced by
anti-survival stimuli will weed
themselves out in the meanwhile.
Cultural Relativism
In this case, Skinner is saying
that stimuli should be (as opposed
to are) considered as positively

reinforcing or as aversive in terms
of the survival of the species. On
grounds of strict methodological
behaviorism when he observes a
masochist receiving positive
reinforcement from being
whipped, he has no business
terming this behavior "aversive
self-stimulation" (as he does in
Science and Human Behavior).
It is in this context of the
survival of the species that

Skinner suggests that one can
recognize one culture as better
than another (p. 145 ).
Skinner does travel another
avenue in explaining what the
good is. He takes a position of
cultural relativism: "What is good
in one culture may not be good in
another" (p. 128). Now if goods
are reinforcers and reinforcers
were differentiated into positive
and negative in response to the
contingencies of survival of the
species, then culturally relative
goods are impossible.
Blatant Contradictions
Thus Skinner's system has led
him down these two avenues into
a position where he is blatantly
contradicting himself.
In any case, it is difficult to
take Skinner's philosophical
stance seriously, because the very
scientific method that he lauds
assumes free will. As Rothbard
puts its: "The determinists profess
to be able, some day, to
determine what men's choices and

actions will be. But, on their own
grounds, their own knowledge of
this determining theory is itself
determined. How can they aspire
to know all, if the extent of their
own knowledge is itself
determined, and therefore
arbitrarily delimited? In fact, if
our ideas are determined, then we
have no way of freely revising our
judgments and of learning
truth—whether the truth of

determinism or of anything else."
There is only one route to
finding a standard of good which
is at once scientific, objective, in
accord with the survival of the
human species, and capable of
evaluating every culture. This is
the route Skinner has explicitly
rejected (pp. 5-6). It is the route
of eudaemonistic ethics: One
should live a life that can be
recognized as really (not just
apparently) good, when looked at
as a whole.
Self Examined Life
This is the sum total of the
good that is demanded of one;
and all other goods, as Mortimer

sensations, which are very
different from the sensations
connected with the startle reflex."
Underlying all such evaluations
of objects as suitable or unsuitable
for one's self (and all subsequent
emotional feelings) is one's
estimation of one's self-worth.
In his novel, Walden Two, a
fictional account of a behaviorist
Utopia, Skinner puts the following
account of emotions and the
possibility of behavioral
conditioning of certain kinds of
emotions, in the mouth of his
behaviorist hero Frazier:
Conditioned Emotions?
"As to emotions—we aren't
free of them all, nor should we
like to be. But the meaner and
more annoying—the emotions
which breed unhappiness—are
almost unknown here, like
unhappiness itself. We don't need
them any longer in our struggle

for existence, and it's easier on
our circulatory system, and
certainly pleasanter, to dispense
with them." To the objection that
emotions are fun, Frazier replies,
"Some of them, yes. The
productive and strengthening
emotions—joy and love. But
sorrow and hate—and the
high-voltage excitements of anger,
fear, and rage—are out of
proportion with the needs of
modern life, and they're wasteful
and dangerous. Mr. Castle has
mentioned jealousy—a minor form
of anger, I think we may call it.
Naturally we avoid it."
It is clear from these passages
that Skinner believes that it is
possible to condition out certain
kinds of emotions. But I would
contend that there is not even a
theoretical possibility of doing
this.
Let us consider an example
which Goldberg uses to show the
difficulty with Skinner's theory of
emotions:
Joy And Sorrow
"Skinner wants to retain joy
(because it is productive) and
eliminate sorrow(because it isn't).
"Under what circumstances
might one experience joy? Well
suppose one has not seen one's
mother for twenty years.

"One goes to meet the plane
on which she is expected to arrive.
The door opens, she descends the
stairs and comes running to meet
one, arms outstretched, tears in
her eyes.
"Presumably, on this occasion
one is happy, joyful, and the
inspiration provided enables one
that very evening to make some
important new contribution to
knowledge.
"But suppose that just as one is
about to embrace one's mother,
an unknown assailant shoots her
in the back. Doesn't one then feel
at least sorrow, or even grief? Is
one neutral? Indifferent?
Atomistic States
"Isn't it obvious that joy and
sorrow are not atomistic states
with no stronger connection than
that they are both emotions? .. .
But if that's true, then it doesn't
even make sense to suppose that
one could condition people never
to experience the one and always
(or almost always) to experience
the other.
"The principle (illustrated by
this example) is that many
emotions have what might be
called quasi-logical counterparts.
Pairs such as love-hate,
joy-sorrow, happiness-unhappiness
are familiar. To suppose that

(whatever technique one might
employ) one could condition out
one member and leave the other
intact is to believe a fiction."
I would further point out that
Skinner is wrong to divide
emotions like joy and sorrow into
the productive and the
unproductive. Arnold and Gasson
say: "We must bear in mind that a
'negative' emotion and the
'negative' movement involved in it
are in fact positive states—there is
actually something going on. The
movement is called negative
because it is away from whatever
provokes it. But this movement is
not simply away from the
undesirable object or state.
"It is reasonable to argue that
this movement is as much positive
(toward something) as it is
negative (away from the
undesirable), because even on the
principle of sheer mechanical
evolution of the organism, survival
is the function of avoidance
reactions. Thus the negative
movement is always toward
something better, not simply
away from the present evil ....
Sadness, which at first glance
seems to be wholly depressing, has
a positive bearing: a heading
toward something—anything—
constructive and elating."
Third In A Series
Skinner's discussion of values
in Beyond Freedom & Dignity is
confused and self-contradictory.
But it is possible to discern, after
careful examination, that he is
traveling two different avenues in
explaining what the good is.
Traveling along the first
avenue, we proceed as follows:
"good things are positive
reinforcers" (p. 103); "goods are
reinforcers" (p. 145); and "things
are good (positively reinforcing)
or bad (negatively reinforcing)
presumably because of the
contingencies of survival under
which the species evolved" (p.
10 4). That is to say that man as a
species has been evolving so as to
combat anti-survival stimuli.
At times, Skinner is saying that
men do in fact universally
consider stimuli on the basis of an
evolutionally-constructed,
genetically built-in system for
responding to stimuli as either
positively reinforcing or aversive.
In Walden Two, Skinner's
behaviorist hero Frazier says:
"The philosopher in search of a
rational basis for deciding what is
good has always reminded me of
the centipede trying to decide
how to walk. Simply go ahead and
walk! Wc ail know what's good,
until we r.top to think about it."
On the other hand, on the
same avenue we notice Skinner
saying, "Not everyone finds the
same things good" (Beyond
Freedom & Dignity, p. 106). Here
he is saying that evolution isn't
over yet and that the masochists,
martyrs, and suicides who are
positively reinforced by
anti-survival stimuli will weed
themselves out in the meanwhile.
Cultural Relativism
In this case, Skinner is saying
that stimuli should be (as opposed
to are) considered as positively

reinforcing or as aversive in terms
of the survival of the species. On
grounds of strict methodological
behaviorism when he observes a
masochist receiving positive
reinforcement from being
whipped, he has no business
terming this behavior "aversive
self-stimulation" (as he does in
Science and Human Behavior).
It is in this context of the
survival of the species that

Skinner suggests that one can
recognize one culture as better
than another (p. 145 ).
Skinner does travel another
avenue in explaining what the
good is. He takes a position of
cultural relativism: "What is good
in one culture may not be good in
another" (p. 128). Now if goods
are reinforcers and reinforcers
were differentiated into positive
and negative in response to the
contingencies of survival of the
species, then culturally relative
goods are impossible.
Blatant Contradictions
Thus Skinner's system has led
him down these two avenues into
a position where he is blatantly
contradicting himself.
In any case, it is difficult to
take Skinner's philosophical
stance seriously, because the very
scientific method that he lauds
assumes free will. As Rothbard
puts its: "The determinists profess
to be able, some day, to
determine what men's choices and

actions will be. But, on their own
grounds, their own knowledge of
this determining theory is itself
determined. How can they aspire
to know all, if the extent of their
own knowledge is itself
determined, and therefore
arbitrarily delimited? In fact, if
our ideas are determined, then we
have no way of freely revising our
judgments and of learning
truth—whether the truth of

determinism or of anything else."
There is only one route to
finding a standard of good which
is at once scientific, objective, in
accord with the survival of the
human species, and capable of
evaluating every culture. This is
the route Skinner has explicitly
rejected (pp. 5-6). It is the route
of eudaemonistic ethics: One
should live a life that can be
recognized as really (not just
apparently) good, when looked at
as a whole.
Self Examined Life
This is the sum total of the
good that is demanded of one;
and all other goods, as Mortimer
Adler points out in The Time of
Our Lives, "ought to be sought as
constitutive parts of a whole good
life." It is only the self-examined
life, lived in accord with reason,
that is worth living.
I have two more points to
make about Skinner's Utopian
proposals, and I take these points
from Goldberg's thoughtful 196 4
review of Walden Two. One point
concerns the quasi-logical
structure of human emotions; the
other might be called the problem
of levels of value generality.
Feelings and emotions serve a

definite purpose in human beings.
In their essay, "Feelings and
Emotions as Dynamic Factors in
Personality Integration," Arnold
and Gasson say that an emotion is
a "felt tendency toward an object
judged suitable, or away from an
object judged unsuitable" This
felt tendency is accompanied by
"specific bodily changes according
to the type of emotion."
Feelings And Emotions
They go on to say: "The
individual must perceive and judge
the object in relation to himself
(as suitable or unsuitable, good or
bad for himself) before an
emotion can arise. The emotion
will follow this judgment, whether
or not it is correct." For example,
the fact that "emotion does
depend on the evaluation of the
situation, on its meaning for the
individual, can be observed in a
person's reaction to a sudden
sharp noise: the startle reflex
comes first, without any emotion;
if the noise is recognized as that
of a car backfiring, there is no
further disturbance, but if the
person discovers that it was a shot
aimed at him, there will come fear
with its accompanying physical
sensations, which are very
different from the sensations
connected with the startle reflex."
Underlying all such evaluations
of objects as suitable or unsuitable
for one's self (and all subsequent
emotional feelings) is one's
estimation of one's self-worth.

"One goes to meet the plane
on which she is expected to arrive.
The door opens, she descends the
stairs and comes running to meet
one, arms outstretched, tears in
her eyes.
"Presumably, on this occasion
one is happy, joyful, and the
inspiration provided enables one
that very evening to make some
important new contribution to
knowledge.
"But suppose that just as one is
about to embrace one's mother,
an unknown assailant shoots her
in the back. Doesn't one then feel
at least sorrow, or even grief? Is
one neutral? Indifferent?
Atomistic States
"Isn't it obvious that joy and
sorrow are not atomistic states
with no stronger connection than
that they are both emotions? .. .
But if that's true, then it doesn't
even make sense to suppose that
one could condition people never
to experience the one and always
(or almost always) to experience
the other.
"The principle (illustrated by
this example) is that many
emotions have what might be
called quasi-logical counterparts.
Pairs such as love-hate,
joy-sorrow, happiness-unhappiness
are familiar. To suppose that

(whatever technique one might
employ) one could condition out
one member and leave the other
intact is to believe a fiction."
I would further point out that
Skinner is wrong to divide
emotions like joy and sorrow into
the productive and the
unproductive. Arnold and Gasson
say: "We must bear in mind that a
'negative' emotion and the
'negative' movement involved in it
are in fact positive states—there is
actually something going on. The
movement is called negative
because it is away from whatever
provokes it. But this movement is
not simply away from the
undesirable object or state.
"It is reasonable to argue that
this movement is as much positive
(toward something) as it is
negative (away from the
undesirable), because even on the
principle of sheer mechanical
evolution of the organism, survival
is the function of avoidance
reactions. Thus the negative
movement is always toward
something better, not simply
away from the present evil ....
Sadness, which at first glance
seems to be wholly depressing, has
a positive bearing: a heading
toward something—anything—
constructive and elating."
Third In A Series
Skinner's discussion of values
in Beyond Freedom & Dignity is
confused and self-contradictory.
But it is possible to discern, after
careful examination, that he is
traveling two different avenues in
explaining what the good is.
Traveling along the first
avenue, we proceed as follows:
"good things are positive
reinforcers" (p. 103); "goods are
reinforcers" (p. 145); and "things
are good (positively reinforcing)
or bad (negatively reinforcing)
presumably because of the
contingencies of survival under
which the species evolved" (p.
10 4). That is to say that man as a
species has been evolving so as to
combat anti-survival stimuli.
At times, Skinner is saying that
men do in fact universally
consider stimuli on the basis of an
evolutionally-constructed,
genetically built-in system for
responding to stimuli as either
positively reinforcing or aversive.
In Walden Two, Skinner's
behaviorist hero Frazier says:
"The philosopher in search of a
rational basis for deciding what is
good has always reminded me of
the centipede trying to decide
how to walk. Simply go ahead and
walk! Wc ail know what's good,
until we r.top to think about it."
On the other hand, on the
same avenue we notice Skinner
saying, "Not everyone finds the
same things good" (Beyond
Freedom & Dignity, p. 106). Here
he is saying that evolution isn't
over yet and that the masochists,
martyrs, and suicides who are
positively reinforced by
anti-survival stimuli will weed
themselves out in the meanwhile.
Cultural Relativism
In this case, Skinner is saying
that stimuli should be (as opposed
to are) considered as positively

reinforcing or as aversive in terms
of the survival of the species. On
grounds of strict methodological
behaviorism when he observes a
masochist receiving positive
reinforcement from being
whipped, he has no business
terming this behavior "aversive
self-stimulation" (as he does in
Science and Human Behavior).
It is in this context of the
survival of the species that

Skinner suggests that one can
recognize one culture as better
than another (p. 145 ).
Skinner does travel another
avenue in explaining what the
good is. He takes a position of
cultural relativism: "What is good
in one culture may not be good in
another" (p. 128). Now if goods
are reinforcers and reinforcers
were differentiated into positive
and negative in response to the
contingencies of survival of the
species, then culturally relative
goods are impossible.
Blatant Contradictions
Thus Skinner's system has led
him down these two avenues into
a position where he is blatantly
contradicting himself.
In any case, it is difficult to
take Skinner's philosophical
stance seriously, because the very
scientific method that he lauds
assumes free will. As Rothbard
puts its: "The determinists profess
to be able, some day, to
determine what men's choices and

actions will be. But, on their own
grounds, their own knowledge of
this determining theory is itself
determined. How can they aspire
to know all, if the extent of their
own knowledge is itself
determined, and therefore
arbitrarily delimited? In fact, if
our ideas are determined, then we
have no way of freely revising our
judgments and of learning
truth—whether the truth of

determinism or of anything else."
There is only one route to
finding a standard of good which
is at once scientific, objective, in
accord with the survival of the
human species, and capable of
evaluating every culture. This is
the route Skinner has explicitly
rejected (pp. 5-6). It is the route
of eudaemonistic ethics: One
should live a life that can be
recognized as really (not just
apparently) good, when looked at
as a whole.
Self Examined Life
This is the sum total of the
good that is demanded of one;
and all other goods, as Mortimer
Adler points out in The Time of
Our Lives, "ought to be sought as
constitutive parts of a whole good
life." It is only the self-examined
life, lived in accord with reason,
that is worth living.
I have two more points to
make about Skinner's Utopian
proposals, and I take these points
from Goldberg's thoughtful 196 4
review of Walden Two. One point
concerns the quasi-logical
structure of human emotions; the
other might be called the problem
of levels of value generality.
Feelings and emotions serve a

definite purpose in human beings.
In their essay, "Feelings and
Emotions as Dynamic Factors in
Personality Integration," Arnold
and Gasson say that an emotion is
a "felt tendency toward an object
judged suitable, or away from an
object judged unsuitable" This
felt tendency is accompanied by
"specific bodily changes according
to the type of emotion."
Feelings And Emotions
They go on to say: "The
individual must perceive and judge
the object in relation to himself
(as suitable or unsuitable, good or
bad for himself) before an
emotion can arise. The emotion
will follow this judgment, whether
or not it is correct." For example,
the fact that "emotion does
depend on the evaluation of the
situation, on its meaning for the
individual, can be observed in a
person's reaction to a sudden
sharp noise: the startle reflex
comes first, without any emotion;
if the noise is recognized as that
of a car backfiring, there is no
further disturbance, but if the
person discovers that it was a shot
aimed at him, there will come fear
with its accompanying physical
sensations, which are very
different from the sensations
connected with the startle reflex."
Underlying all such evaluations
of objects as suitable or unsuitable
for one's self (and all subsequent
emotional feelings) is one's
estimation of one's self-worth.
In his novel, Walden Two, a
fictional account of a behaviorist
Utopia, Skinner puts the following
account of emotions and the
possibility of behavioral
conditioning of certain kinds of
emotions, in the mouth of his
behaviorist hero Frazier:
Conditioned Emotions?
"As to emotions—we aren't
free of them all, nor should we
like to be. But the meaner and
more annoying—the emotions
which breed unhappiness—are
almost unknown here, like
unhappiness itself. We don't need
them any longer in our struggle

for existence, and it's easier on
our circulatory system, and
certainly pleasanter, to dispense
with them." To the objection that
emotions are fun, Frazier replies,
"Some of them, yes. The
productive and strengthening
emotions—joy and love. But
sorrow and hate—and the
high-voltage excitements of anger,
fear, and rage—are out of
proportion with the needs of
modern life, and they're wasteful
and dangerous. Mr. Castle has
mentioned jealousy—a minor form
of anger, I think we may call it.
Naturally we avoid it."
It is clear from these passages
that Skinner believes that it is
possible to condition out certain
kinds of emotions. But I would
contend that there is not even a
theoretical possibility of doing
this.
Let us consider an example
which Goldberg uses to show the
difficulty with Skinner's theory of
emotions:
Joy And Sorrow
"Skinner wants to retain joy
(because it is productive) and
eliminate sorrow(because it isn't).
"Under what circumstances
might one experience joy? Well
suppose one has not seen one's
mother for twenty years.

"One goes to meet the plane
on which she is expected to arrive.
The door opens, she descends the
stairs and comes running to meet
one, arms outstretched, tears in
her eyes.
"Presumably, on this occasion
one is happy, joyful, and the
inspiration provided enables one
that very evening to make some
important new contribution to
knowledge.
"But suppose that just as one is
about to embrace one's mother,
an unknown assailant shoots her
in the back. Doesn't one then feel
at least sorrow, or even grief? Is
one neutral? Indifferent?
Atomistic States
"Isn't it obvious that joy and
sorrow are not atomistic states
with no stronger connection than
that they are both emotions? .. .
But if that's true, then it doesn't
even make sense to suppose that
one could condition people never
to experience the one and always
(or almost always) to experience
the other.
"The principle (illustrated by
this example) is that many
emotions have what might be
called quasi-logical counterparts.
Pairs such as love-hate,
joy-sorrow, happiness-unhappiness
are familiar. To suppose that

(whatever technique one might
employ) one could condition out
one member and leave the other
intact is to believe a fiction."
I would further point out that
Skinner is wrong to divide
emotions like joy and sorrow into
the productive and the
unproductive. Arnold and Gasson
say: "We must bear in mind that a
'negative' emotion and the
