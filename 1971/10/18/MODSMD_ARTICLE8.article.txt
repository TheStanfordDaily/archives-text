## Response To Skinner Series

Bill Evers! You set out to
substantiate the hypothesis that
humans have a free will, and
instead proved that you can use a
lot of words to say very little.
You spend a lot of time in
your last article (Fri., Oct. 15)
stating the obvious: that humans
can think abstractly, and that
measuring scales used in
psychology are arbitrary and their
units non-additive. Your
statement that recognizing
consciousness means throwing out
measures of reinforcement is just
not true. The point is, which of
the two is more useful in
formulating hypotheses and
testing predictions in a particular

situation? Worse, you assume 1 /3
through your article what you
should be proving when you state
that "free will is an attribute of
man". And finally you produce
the ultimate quote that "true
science decrees determinism for
physical nature and free will for
man," a statement which reflects
the philosophy of science about
a century ago.
In fact, we can only make
probablistic statements about
nature at any level, and nature
includes inanimate matter, living
organisms including human beings
with their elaborate but physical
brains. It may be as difficult to
predict the behavior of a small

number of atoms, or nuclear
"particles" or "photons" as to
predict the behavior or an animal
in a learning situation.
Since we assume that if we
could predict human behavior
that would mean humans do not
have a free will, does the fact that
we can't predict human behavior
mean that we do have a free will?
No more so than we say that the
above atoms have a free will
because we can't predict their
behavior.
We can only say for sure that
we are limited by our tools of
examination and analysis. The
number, complexity,
non-linearity, and
interdependence of variables in
human behavior make
difficult with our
current tools. It is precisely these
problems which led to the
operational definitions of
behavioral psychology which you
so vigorously attack.
"Free will" is a concept which
reflects the age-old mind/matter
dichotomy of western thought. It
is an interesting but, as of now,
untestable hypothesis, and a
concept which is part mysticism,
part wishful thinking, part human
conceit, and part impatience with
the slow methodical process of
science. What distinguishes
humans isn't free wills, spirits or
souls but the fact that although
they are products of environment
and heredity, they in turn can
modify the environment and thus
alter the impact of the
environment on themselves.
