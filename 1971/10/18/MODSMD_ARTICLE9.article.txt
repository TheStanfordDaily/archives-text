PERSEPOLIS (Iran)—(A P)
—Each with his doggy bag of
caviar packed in dry ice, kings,
presidents and sultans broke camp
yesterday in the desert ruins of
Persia's ancient capital and headed
home from what may well have
been the blast of the century.
Hugh A. Mulligan,
San Francisco Chronicle
October 17,1971
Mohammad Re/.a Pahlavi,
Iran's oil-rich butcher king, threw
a little party for a few of his
friends last week. From October
12-17, the Shah put on a $400
million bash to "celebrate" 2,500
years of Iranian monarchy.
Planning for the festivities
began ten years ago. An exotic
Tent City was built at the ancient
capital of Persepolis in the south
Iranian desert. Hensens of Paris
designed the setting, complete
with private apartments, casinos,
silk and velvet tents, Persian
carpets, a marble bath, and
servants' quarters.
Seventy monarchs and heads of
state were present to make the
party a smashing success. Among
the eminent guests were kings and
queens from eight European
countries, the Emperor of Japan,
American vice-president Spiro T.
Agnew, Nikolai Podgorny of the
Soviet Union, and the
blood-stained kings of Jordan,
Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and
Ethiopia.
The women were dressed in
long, flowing formal gowns and
were adorned with crowns, tiaras,
and other jewels. The men wore
tails. They feasted on partridge
with foie gras and truffle stuffing
prepared by Maxim's of Paris. One
hundred French captains, aided
by 175 other Europeans, prepared
and served the food.
Unbelievable Hypocricy
The Shah himself proposed the
first toast to his glamorous
friends: "Each of us must try as
hard as possible, as much as
circumstances will allow, to turn
the world into one of love, peace
and cooperation for mankind, a
world in which every person may
enjoy the full amenities of science
and civilization."
What unbelievable hypocrisy!
While the kings and queens
feasted, 1,000 Iranian citizens
were imprisoned in special camps,
victims of a pre-party roundup
staged by the Shah's police. This
is only a minor example of the
Shah's bloody despotism.

Poverty and repression are
both widespread in Iran. The
average yearly income in Iran is
$30. 40% of all Iranian families
live in one room. Each Iranian
consumes only 2.7 pounds of
meat per month. There is only
one doctor for every 3,233
persons and only 5% of these
doctors practice in the villages
where 65% of the people live.
There is also a vast shortage of
schools and teachers. Thousands
of young Iranian women are
forced into prostitution, and 20%
of Iranian men under the age of
30 are opium addicts. (The Shah
has a monopoly on opium
plantations.)
20,000 Political Prisoners
Resistance to the Shah's rule is
brutally repressed. There have
been endless show trials,
detentions, instances of torture,
murders and executions in the last
18 years. Over 20,000 political
prisoners are now imprisoned in
Iran.
And all the while, the Shah has
grown ever-richer from his share
of Iran's fabulous oil wealth.
The Shah's celebration was
designed to whitewash the bloody
character of his 29 year old reign.
A similar whitewashing is taking
place here in the United States,
where American public opinion is
being rallied behind the Shah, a
staunch anti-communist and
defender of U.S. oil interests in
the Middle East.
Hoover Institution Involvement
On the West Coast, this
propaganda offensive is being led
by none other than our own
Hoover Institution for the Study
of War, Revolution and Peace.
Today and tomorrow, Hoover
is sponsoring a conference
entitled, "Iran—2s Centuries of
Achievement," to be held in
Tresidder Union's Large Lounge.
The conference will begin at 9:00
this morning with welcoming
addresses by Hoover Director W.
Glenn Campbell and Iran's Consul
General in San Francisco, Parviz
Adle. Iran "scholars" from all
over the country will speak on
subjects ranging from"The Crown
and Some Royal Insignia in Early
Iran" to "Iran and the West."
Members of the militant Iranian
Students Association have been
barred from the conference.
First Hoover brought us Henry
Cabot Lodge in an attempt to
spread the cloak of legitimacy
over U.S. war crimes in Indochina.

Now the Institute is sponsoring a
conference designed to legitimize
the autocratic rule of the Shah of
Iran, U.S. imperialism's most
faithful ally in the Mid-East.
Hoover—Good Choice
Hoover is a particularly good
choice to put on this conference.
In addition to cranking out
influential anti-communist
propaganda over the years (the
Institute was set up "to
demonstrate the evils of the
doctrines of Karl Marx. .
individuals and corporations
connected with the Institute have
played an important role in
Iranian politics. This leads us to a
brief look at American "oil
diplomacy" in Iran during the
past 20 years.
In 1951, the Iranian Majlis
(Parliament), led by Prime
Minister Mohammad Mossadegh,
voted to nationalize Iran's oil,
comprising 13% of the world's
known reserves. The oil had been
owned by the Anglo-Iranian Oil
Corporation (AIOC), 52%
controlled by the British
government. An agreement had
been worked out two years earlier
giving Iran 25-30% of the
petroleum royalties, but the
Parliament in Teheran (the capital
city) rejected the deal and
nationalized the oil. The
international oil giants
immediately proclaimed a boycott
of Iranian oil, and Iran's
petroleum exports virtually
disappeared.
American Involvement
During the same year, the U.S.

government, anxious to obtain a
piece of Iran's oil action for
American firms, sent a team of
negotiators to Iran headed by
former New York investment
banker W. Averill Harriman (later
a negotiator at the Paris "peace"
talks in the late 1960'5).
Accompanying Harriman was
none other than Herbert Hoover,
Jr., a graduate of Stanford
University's School of Petroleum
Engineering and later to become
Under Secretary of State. (The
junior Hoover at the time was a
director of Union Oil of
California. Stanford Trustee
Arthur Stewart is a Union director
and SRI director Fred Hartley is
Union's president.) The
negotiations failed.
As the months passed, the U.S.
began to see "red" in Iran. In his
memoirs, President Eisenhower
describes a discussion he had with
Senator Robert Taft in which he
"referred to the dangers in Iran
and pointed out that Western
Europe and the oil of the Middle
East must in no circumstances fall
to communism."
Direct Action
In 1953, the U.S. took direct
aciton. CIA agents handed out
over $10 million to Iranian Army
officers and lumpen proletarian
elements in Teheran. On August
19, 1953, the bribed officers led a
mob in a clash with Mossadegh's
forces. After nine hours of
fighting, Mossadegh was deposed.
He was replaced by an ex-Nazi
collaborator, General Zahedi,
head of the Shah's police from

1942-48. Zahedi proceeded to
imprison and execute leftist
students, workers, army officers,
politicians, and tribal leaders.
All the while, American
officials (including U.S.
Ambassador to the United
Nations Henry Cabot Lodge)
declared that what was taking
place in Iran was purely the work
of the Iranian people themselves.
American instigation of the
coup did not go unrewarded. In
1954, a new agreement was signed
giving U.S. firms an important
share of Iran'soil. An international
consortium was set up owned 40%
by Anglo-Iranian (later renamed
British Petroleum), 14% by Royal
Dutch/Shell, 6% by Compagnie
Francaise des Petroles, and 40%
by American firms—B% each by
Standard Oil of New Jersey,
Standard Oil of California,
Socony-Vacuum, Gulf, and
Texaco. Eleven other American
firms were later added to the
consortium including, for
example, Standard Oil of Indiana,
& Signal Oil. (Standard Oil of
California and Gulf Oil have been
big contributors to the Hoover
Institute, and SRI director R.G.
Follis is past chairman of the
board of Standard of California.
The Hoover Institution Advisory
Board includes Herman J.
Schmidt, executive vice-president
of Mobil Oil, John E.
Swearingen,, Chairman of the
Board of Standard of Indiana, and
Forest N. Shumway, president of
the Signal Companies. Stanford
Trustee Lawrence Kimpton is a

vice- president of Standard Oil of
Indiana, and Trustee Richard
McCurdy is president of Royal
Dutch/Shell's American branch.)
Lined Pockets
The new contract gave 50% of
the royalties to Iran, but this has
only lined the Shah's pockets. The
Iranian people have received little
benefit from their country's vast
oil riches.
Since the 1953 coup, Iran has
been further opened up to foreign
and particular American firms. As
of April, 1971, 32 of the 171
foreign companies doing business
in Iran were American, accounting
for $215 million of the $350
million worth of foreign
investment. The oil revenues have
produced a 10% annual growth
rate, but this growth has been
mostly in the services sector
(catering primarily to foreign
businessmen and technicians)
which accounts for 40% of the
Iranian Gross National Product.
Industry accounts for only 10% of
the GNP.
White Revolution
The Shah's "White
Revolution," begun in 1961, has
resulted in some land reform, but
it has not been very significant.
2% of the families still own 70%
of the land. While 45 % of the
people are engaged in agricultural
production, this sector accounts
for only 16% of the Iranian GNP.
Landless peasants have swelled the
masses of the unemployed in the
cities.
With Iran's wealth
concentrated in a few hands, it's
no surprise that militant resistance
has developed to the Shah's
regime. To repress that opposition
(as well as to safeguard U.S.
investments throughout the
Middle East), the Shah maintains
a 160,000-man Army, the largest
in the Persian Gulf area.
One-third of the national
budget, or $895 million, is spent
on military outlays. The U.S.
props up the Shah's government
with major military loans. The
Export-Import Bank recently
granted Iran a $120 million arms
credit and another $100 million
credit for the purchase of 135
Phantoms.
60,000-Man Secret Police
The members of the Shah's
60,000-man secret police,
SAVAK, are everywhere. The
present five-year plan includes
$67 million for 84 new SAVAK
buildings and a detention center

for prisoners. Thousands of
Iranians have disappeared, victims
of SAVAK.
A new wave of opposition to
the Shah has begun this year. In
February, a 3-day battle was
fought between guerrillas and
Army troops in the jungle area
near the Caspian Sea. In addition,
police stations have been
attacked.
Last November, militants
almost abducted U.S. Ambassador
Douglas Mac Arthur 11, and in
April, General Forsiu, the chief
military judge at trials of
opposition members, was gunned
down.
Strikes have taken place in
Teheran for the first time in
several years. In May, the
government shot three workers
just north of Karaj.
In April, 500 students were
arrested in Teheran for protesting
the Shah's recent "celebration."
Iranian Students Rally
The Confederation of Iranian
Students, a world-wide
organization, has been in the
leadership of much of the struggle
against the Shah. In January,
1971, the Confederation was
outlawed in Iran.
The local chapter of the
Iranian Students Association, a
member of the Confederation, has
asked members of the Stanford
community to support its demand
that Iranian students be allowed
to speak at the Hoover
Institute-sponsored conference.
The Iranian students have
made it clear that there is a close
relationship between Hoover's
presentation of Henry Cabot
Lodge and the current conference.
And they see the fight to retain
Bruce Franklin's job and the
struggle against U.S. imperialism.
(Ironically, Glenn Campbell is due
to testify at Bruce's hearing on
Monday afternoon.) Last
Thursday night, the most
powerful bomb explosion in San
Francisco's history blew the
Iranian consulate off its
foundation—a clear protest against
the Shah's party.
The very least we can do in
support of the Iranian people is to
attend the support rally planned
by Venceremos today at 12:00
noon at White Plaza.
INTENSIFY THE STRUGGLE!!
