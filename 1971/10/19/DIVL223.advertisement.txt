j Today In The 'Daily 9
Today is Tuesday, October 19, 1971. On this day in 1934,
architects breathlessly unveiled plans for "the most technically
; perfect theatre in the entire United States." If you have a guess
as to its identity, call the Daily office at 321-2300, ext. 4632. If
you guess Mem And, you have a perverted sense of perfection,
but you're right. Call our business office at ext. 4630 to collect
your prize.
P.S., In our comments yesterday about President Lyman, we
totally neglected a much more important occasion, so Happy
Belated Birthday, Chuck Berry.
Staff luncheon today at noon.
