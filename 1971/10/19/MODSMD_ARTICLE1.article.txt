# Students Present Paper
## Iranian Conference Interrupted 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
Fifteen to 20 persons, many of them
identified with Venceremos, heckled
speakers at a Hoover Institute
conference on Iran yesterday calling
out comments, questions and epithets
during speeches.
The heckling was in support of a
request from members of the Iranian
Student Association (ISA) to present a
paper at the conference on the social
and economic problems in Iran.
Hoover is holding a two-day
conference in Tresidder entitled "Iran:
25 Centuries of Achievement." The
conference is in connection with the
celebration of the 2,500 th anniversary

of the Persian monarchy.
Although Hoover director W. Glenn
Campbell told the Iranians that they
would have plenty of time to make
their points in discussion following
speeches, the Iranians continued to ask
for two hours of conference time as the
heckling kept up.
Comments ranged from "Pig" to
"What about the 2,000 political
prisoners in Iran?"
Adjournment
At one point the conference was
adjourned after an expert on Persian
metrics in verse had left the podium
angrily telling hecklers that "I didn't
come here for a political debate."
The Iranians and their supporters
then went downstairs and held a press
conference. They denied an alleged
charge by Iranian Consul General Dr.
Parviz Adle that the ISA had been
responsible for the bombing of the San
Francisco consulate late Thursday
night.
They also said they were taking
"necessary legal actions" against the
"incriminating statement" of Adle and
demanded a public retraction from
him.
While the press conference was going
on the Persian metrics expert had
resumed his talk upstairs.
The Iranians and their supporters
then moved back upstairs to the
conference and shortly afterward it was
announced that the Iranians could
present their paper between 2:00 p.m.
and 3:00 p.m. both days of the
conference.
Campbell told the Daily last night
that he made the decision because "I
got very tired of their charges so I
figuredwhy not let them speak."
The morning began when Hoover
Middle East curator George Rentz was
greeted with boos, hisses and epithets
of "Fascist" and "Pig" as he opened
the conference. However, he continued
his speech over further heckling.

Campbell then spoke briefly over
repeated interruptions from about 15
members in the audience of 45. But no
Iranian students were apparent then.
Following Campbell's remarks SLAC
Professor Pierre Noyes moved that the
Iranians be allowed to speak at the
conference "so that we can hear a
number of other things about the
development of Iran."
A dark skinned man with a
mustache and glasses who would only
identify himself as an Iranian student
from San Jose State strode forward and
told Campbell that "we feel this
conference should go on but we would
like two hours to present the views of
the Iranian people."
Campbell informed him that he
should have brought this up when the
conference was being prepared and
added that there were discussion
periods after the speeches.
Adle Speaks
Dr. Parviz Adle then spoke on Iran's
history over shouts of "feed the people
and not the pigs" and "does your
poodle have a diamond bracelet?"
Adle finished his talk and later said
that "disrupting a cultural event is most
unbecoming for someone who calls
himself a student."
He added that members of the ISA
were "full-time agitators."
Following a short recess in the
proceedings, Rentz announced that the
Iranians could have from 1:00 p.m. to
2:00 p.m. both days of the conference
when no events had been scheduled.
But the Iranians demanded to be
part of the program.
Rentz then said there would be no
further discussion.
Then Venceremos member and
German Professor Juan Flores moved
from the audience that the Chairman
be replaced with a 2/3 majority vote
from the audience.
Members of the audience, now well
over 100, responded with chants of

"vote, vote."
Campbell informed the audience
that if there was any further disruption
the academic conference would have to
be adjourned.
Chairman of the French and Italian
Department Raymond Giraud then
suddenly strode from his seat toward
the front of the room and dramatically
addressed the conference table.
"If you genuinely and sincerely
want to turn this conference into what
it is not," he said. "That is, an
academic conference of a kind that can
be legitimately and honorably
conducted in a free University, you
must invite people of divergent points
of view to participate in the time
allotted for the conference.
"If you don't, you repudiate your
contentions," he concluded to an
ovation.
Charges Possible
Concerning the heckling at
yesterday's hearing, Assistant to the
Provost John Schwartz said last night
that he had not received an accurate
account of the proceedings yet but that
prosecution of students involved in the
heckling was certainly possible.
In the afternoon presentation by the
ISA, A. Hobaroz, a secretary of the
organization, delivered a strong
indictment of his homeland's economic
programs and progress to over 200
persons.
In his presentation the Iranian
criticized the authoritarian methods of
Mohammed Reza Shah Pahlevi's
government, which he said was
supported by "the pillars of a thousand
prisons." He went on to point out that
there were currently 2200 political
prisoners jailed in Iran.
The speaker pointed out that the
government-touted increase in Iran's
Gross National Product was principally
inspired by foreign development of the
country's oil interests rather than by
any government program.
