## Fee Assessments 
### 
What is sneaky, coercive,
and takes your money?
Either a mugger or an ASSU
fee assessment.
No joke. The ASSU Senate
elections contain a little
surprise: the opportunity to
take $2 per quarter from each
student and give it to a Child
Care Center and to the four
organized minority groups on
campus.
We urge you to pass up this
opportunity.
Last spring, the student
body voted for a $0 fee
assessment because it was tired
of being required to pay for
the activities of a few groups.
It recognized the principle that
coercion on any scale and for
any purpose is an evil.
This principle still applies,
and it applies to everyone. If
you want to give to a student
organization, that's fine; if
you're forced to "give," that's
coercion.
Last year's $0 victory also
showed something else: that a
well-informed student body will
not allow themselves to be
taxed. For this reason, the
proposed assessments have not
been publicized. In fact, efforts
have been made to conceal
them. As an example, two of
the four ASSU Presidents were
being interviewed on KZSU last
Thursday. The announcement
was made that listeners were
welcome to phone in questions.
Five minutes after the show
started, the question "Will
there be a fee assessment on
the ballot?" was duly phoned
in.
Strangely enough, that
question was never answered
although many opportunities to
ask it presented themselves, and
the usual KZSU policy is to

Michael fancher

give phone-in questions priority.
The backers of these
assessments are well aware that
if people know about them,
they'll vote against them. But
why should they vote against
them?
To give money to a Child
Care Center is absurd. The
percentage of Stanford students
with pre-school children is
miniscule. To be sure, attending
school and caring for children
at the same time can be a
hassle, but why should 11,500
people be required to alleviate
one's own personal hassle?
Everyone has problems; must
their solutions be financed
unwillingly by the whole?
Unfortunately, to argue
against giving funds to minority
groups is to invite the label of
"racist." However, we must
reiterate that the principle of
voluntarism that was approved
by the student body last year
despite similar labels applies
regardless of the group in
question. The only valid
measure of the legitimacy of
any group is its ability to
acquire funds on its own. In
that way, the value of that
group's activities to the whole
can be evaluated. To force
someone to donate to a group
whose activities are meaningless
to him is, to say the very
least, taking the easy way out.
Why are people so upset
over a couple of dollars?
Because any principle—in this
case, the principle of
voluntarism—holds regardless of
the quantities involved.
We ask that Stanford
students not be duped and
coerced, and not to lose their
grasp on principle.

surprise: the opportunity to
take $2 per quarter from each
student and give it to a Child
Care Center and to the four
organized minority groups on
campus.
We urge you to pass up this
opportunity.
Last spring, the student
body voted for a $0 fee
assessment because it was tired
of being required to pay for
the activities of a few groups.
It recognized the principle that
coercion on any scale and for
any purpose is an evil.
This principle still applies,
and it applies to everyone. If
you want to give to a student
organization, that's fine; if
you're forced to "give," that's
coercion.
Last year's $0 victory also
showed something else: that a
well-informed student body will
not allow themselves to be
taxed. For this reason, the
proposed assessments have not
been publicized. In fact, efforts
have been made to conceal
them. As an example, two of
the four ASSU Presidents were
being interviewed on KZSU last
Thursday. The announcement
was made that listeners were
welcome to phone in questions.
Five minutes after the show
started, the question "Will
there be a fee assessment on
the ballot?" was duly phoned
in.
Strangely enough, that
question was never answered
although many opportunities to
ask it presented themselves, and
the usual KZSU policy is to

Michael fancher

give phone-in questions priority.
The backers of these
assessments are well aware that
if people know about them,
they'll vote against them. But
why should they vote against
them?
To give money to a Child
Care Center is absurd. The
percentage of Stanford students
with pre-school children is
miniscule. To be sure, attending
school and caring for children
at the same time can be a
hassle, but why should 11,500
people be required to alleviate
one's own personal hassle?
Everyone has problems; must
their solutions be financed
unwillingly by the whole?
Unfortunately, to argue
against giving funds to minority
groups is to invite the label of
"racist." However, we must
reiterate that the principle of
voluntarism that was approved
by the student body last year
despite similar labels applies
regardless of the group in
question. The only valid
measure of the legitimacy of
any group is its ability to
acquire funds on its own. In
that way, the value of that
group's activities to the whole
can be evaluated. To force
someone to donate to a group
whose activities are meaningless
to him is, to say the very
least, taking the easy way out.
Why are people so upset
over a couple of dollars?
Because any principle—in this
case, the principle of
voluntarism—holds regardless of
the quantities involved.
We ask that Stanford
students not be duped and
coerced, and not to lose their
grasp on principle.

What is sneaky, coercive,
and takes your money?
Either a mugger or an ASSU
fee assessment.
No joke. The ASSU Senate
elections contain a little
surprise: the opportunity to
take $2 per quarter from each
student and give it to a Child
Care Center and to the four
organized minority groups on
campus.
