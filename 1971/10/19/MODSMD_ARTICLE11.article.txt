The final problem which I
would like to discuss is the
problem of levels of value
generality. In his discussion of
this problem, Goldberg assumes
for the sake of argument that
"we have a scientific procedure
for determining not only how
to condition various abilities,
character traits, and values
[what Skinner calls a
technology of behavior], but
also for determining which ones
we should condition.
"Now, it is not so easy to
know what we are supposing
here. With respect to musical
ability, for example, are we
supposing ourselves to be
conditioning general ability in
this area, ability at baroque
music, ability at Bach, Vivaldi,
or what?
"The same question arises
for musical tastes. Do we
condition people to like
baroque music or do we
condition a fondness for music
in general?"
The question is: At what
value or ability level are our
conditioning procedures
supposed to operate? The
behaviorist "is not going to
condition each miniscule
preference or ability in each
member of society. I mean he
is not going to decide that so
and so many people should be
devotees of the late Beethoven
quartets, and that so and so
many people are going to be
admirers of Bach piano sonatas
played without the pedal."

Let us assume, then, that
the conditioning procedures are
going to be applied at the
most general level: "we are
going to produce so and so
many musicians, so and so
many artists, etc. We are not
going to produce as a matter
of deliberate policy a given

number of baroque pianists, a
given number of impressionists,
and so on."
What can we expect to be
the result in such a situation?
"While the number of people
who have musical interests and
abilities is something that we
can expect to be constant
(because we are fixing it) the
number of people who like any
kind of music and the number
who are skilled in the
production of any kind of
music is something that is
likely to vary."
On the secondary level of
kinds of music, "there is an
area for which we might call a
free interplay of competing
values," and "there is reason to
expect that there will be some
sort of building on what is
already in existence. Gifted

musicians will see the
possibility of innovating, of
building upon the stock of
values and knowledge which
they already possess, in the
same way that this was done
in the old society, in the way
for example, in which Mahler
is said to have built on

Wagner, and Schoenberg on
Mahler. And we can also
expect that some of these
innovations will receive
acceptance on the part of some
of the music lovers of the
society. . . .
"This new sort of music,
when it is performed, is going
to be one of the causal factors
influencing the behavior of the
inhabitants of the society. And
there will be all sorts of
factors, on this [secondary]
level [of generality], which will
be determinants of the behavior
of the inhabitants of the
society—new art forms, new
ways of painting, new ways of
writing and performing plays;
innovations in technology; new
ways of building homes, new
alloys for use in such building.
The possibility of a literally
endless number of changes in
the established order opens
up."
What can we expect the
reaction of the behavioral
engineers, the planners of
Skinner's Utopian future, to be
to such innovations? If, in the
opinion of the planners, an
innovation will be an adverse
influence on the populace, the
planners will have to act to
stamp it out.
At this point, we would do
well to recall that Skinner's

whole argument against the
libertarian position and the
literature of freedom and
dignity is that in what is called
a free society both unplanned
stimuli will appear, leading to
the accidental control of people
in the society, and planned but
unscientific stimuli will appear,
leading to biased control of
people in the society.
In addition, we must
remember that because of
Skinner's mistaken idea that
men do not possess free will,
he believes that there are only
two alternatives: scientific
control by behavioral engineers
or accidental and biased
control.
But now it appears that, in
behaviorist terms, accidental
and biased control will
inevitably be present even in
the Skinner-designed behaviorist
Utopia (as Skinner himself
admits, Beyond Freedom &
Dignity, pp. 162-63).
So we can expect the
behaviorist planners to stamp
out any adverse influences that
arise from levels of value
generality below the levels at
which they have conditioned
people. But this kind of
control differs in an important
way from the kind of control
the behaviorist planners were
exercising earlier.
Part of the attractiveness of
Skinner's behaviorism, to those
who superficially consider what
he has to say, is that in his
Utopia, the planners are not
acting aginst the desires of the
populace because the planners
have created the populace's
desires. But in stamping out
the innovations, the behaviorist
engineers in the Utopia are
acting against the wishes of the
populace and are exercising
"political control pure and
simple."
Once we recognize this, we
can see that freedom is not
the absence of aversive stimuli,
as Skinner would have it (pp.
26, 42-43), but the absence of
chains.

unscientific stimuli will appear,
leading to biased control of
people in the society.
In addition, we must
remember that because of
Skinner's mistaken idea that
men do not possess free will,
he believes that there are only
two alternatives: scientific
control by behavioral engineers
or accidental and biased
control.
But now it appears that, in
behaviorist terms, accidental
and biased control will
inevitably be present even in
the Skinner-designed behaviorist
Utopia (as Skinner himself
admits, Beyond Freedom &
Dignity, pp. 162-63).
So we can expect the
behaviorist planners to stamp
out any adverse influences that
arise from levels of value
generality below the levels at
which they have conditioned
people. But this kind of
control differs in an important
way from the kind of control
the behaviorist planners were
exercising earlier.
Part of the attractiveness of
Skinner's behaviorism, to those
who superficially consider what
he has to say, is that in his
Utopia, the planners are not
acting aginst the desires of the
populace because the planners
have created the populace's
desires. But in stamping out
the innovations, the behaviorist
engineers in the Utopia are
acting against the wishes of the
populace and are exercising
"political control pure and
simple."
Once we recognize this, we
can see that freedom is not
the absence of aversive stimuli,
as Skinner would have it (pp.
26, 42-43), but the absence of
chains.

The final problem which I
would like to discuss is the
problem of levels of value
generality. In his discussion of
this problem, Goldberg assumes
for the sake of argument that
"we have a scientific procedure
for determining not only how
to condition various abilities,
character traits, and values
[what Skinner calls a
technology of behavior], but
also for determining which ones
we should condition.
"Now, it is not so easy to
know what we are supposing
here. With respect to musical
ability, for example, are we
supposing ourselves to be
conditioning general ability in
this area, ability at baroque
music, ability at Bach, Vivaldi,
or what?
"The same question arises
for musical tastes. Do we
condition people to like
baroque music or do we
condition a fondness for music
in general?"
The question is: At what
value or ability level are our
conditioning procedures
supposed to operate? The
behaviorist "is not going to
condition each miniscule
preference or ability in each
member of society. I mean he
is not going to decide that so
and so many people should be
devotees of the late Beethoven
quartets, and that so and so
many people are going to be
admirers of Bach piano sonatas
played without the pedal."

Let us assume, then, that
the conditioning procedures are
going to be applied at the
most general level: "we are
going to produce so and so
many musicians, so and so
many artists, etc. We are not
going to produce as a matter
of deliberate policy a given

News in Review

number of baroque pianists, a
given number of impressionists,
and so on."
What can we expect to be
the result in such a situation?
"While the number of people
who have musical interests and
abilities is something that we
can expect to be constant
(because we are fixing it) the
number of people who like any
kind of music and the number
who are skilled in the
production of any kind of
music is something that is
likely to vary."
On the secondary level of
kinds of music, "there is an
area for which we might call a
free interplay of competing
values," and "there is reason to
expect that there will be some
sort of building on what is
already in existence. Gifted

musicians will see the
possibility of innovating, of
building upon the stock of
values and knowledge which
they already possess, in the
same way that this was done
in the old society, in the way
for example, in which Mahler
is said to have built on

Wagner, and Schoenberg on
Mahler. And we can also
expect that some of these
innovations will receive
acceptance on the part of some
of the music lovers of the
society. . . .
"This new sort of music,
when it is performed, is going
to be one of the causal factors
influencing the behavior of the
inhabitants of the society. And
there will be all sorts of
factors, on this [secondary]
level [of generality], which will
be determinants of the behavior
of the inhabitants of the
society—new art forms, new
ways of painting, new ways of
writing and performing plays;
innovations in technology; new
ways of building homes, new
alloys for use in such building.
The possibility of a literally
endless number of changes in
the established order opens
up."
What can we expect the
reaction of the behavioral
engineers, the planners of
Skinner's Utopian future, to be
to such innovations? If, in the
opinion of the planners, an
innovation will be an adverse
influence on the populace, the
planners will have to act to
stamp it out.
At this point, we would do
well to recall that Skinner's

whole argument against the
libertarian position and the
literature of freedom and
dignity is that in what is called
a free society both unplanned
stimuli will appear, leading to
the accidental control of people
in the society, and planned but
unscientific stimuli will appear,
leading to biased control of
people in the society.
In addition, we must
remember that because of
Skinner's mistaken idea that

same way that this was done
in the old society, in the way
for example, in which Mahler
is said to have built on

Wagner, and Schoenberg on
Mahler. And we can also
expect that some of these
innovations will receive
acceptance on the part of some
of the music lovers of the
society. . . .
"This new sort of music,
when it is performed, is going
to be one of the causal factors
influencing the behavior of the
inhabitants of the society. And
there will be all sorts of
factors, on this [secondary]
level [of generality], which will
be determinants of the behavior
of the inhabitants of the
society—new art forms, new
ways of painting, new ways of
writing and performing plays;
innovations in technology; new
ways of building homes, new
alloys for use in such building.
The possibility of a literally
endless number of changes in
the established order opens
up."
What can we expect the
reaction of the behavioral
engineers, the planners of
Skinner's Utopian future, to be
to such innovations? If, in the
opinion of the planners, an
innovation will be an adverse
influence on the populace, the
planners will have to act to
stamp it out.
At this point, we would do
well to recall that Skinner's

whole argument against the
libertarian position and the
literature of freedom and
dignity is that in what is called
a free society both unplanned
stimuli will appear, leading to
the accidental control of people
in the society, and planned but
unscientific stimuli will appear,
leading to biased control of
people in the society.
In addition, we must
remember that because of
Skinner's mistaken idea that
men do not possess free will,
he believes that there are only
two alternatives: scientific
control by behavioral engineers
or accidental and biased
control.
But now it appears that, in
behaviorist terms, accidental
and biased control will
inevitably be present even in
the Skinner-designed behaviorist
Utopia (as Skinner himself
admits, Beyond Freedom &
Dignity, pp. 162-63).
So we can expect the
behaviorist planners to stamp
out any adverse influences that
arise from levels of value
generality below the levels at
which they have conditioned
people. But this kind of
control differs in an important
way from the kind of control
the behaviorist planners were
exercising earlier.
Part of the attractiveness of
Skinner's behaviorism, to those
who superficially consider what
he has to say, is that in his
Utopia, the planners are not
acting aginst the desires of the
populace because the planners
have created the populace's
desires. But in stamping out
the innovations, the behaviorist
engineers in the Utopia are
acting against the wishes of the
populace and are exercising
"political control pure and
simple."
Once we recognize this, we
can see that freedom is not
the absence of aversive stimuli,
as Skinner would have it (pp.
26, 42-43), but the absence of
chains.

The final problem which I
would like to discuss is the
problem of levels of value
generality. In his discussion of
this problem, Goldberg assumes
for the sake of argument that
"we have a scientific procedure
for determining not only how
to condition various abilities,
character traits, and values
[what Skinner calls a
technology of behavior], but
also for determining which ones
we should condition.
"Now, it is not so easy to
know what we are supposing
here. With respect to musical
ability, for example, are we
supposing ourselves to be
conditioning general ability in
this area, ability at baroque
music, ability at Bach, Vivaldi,
or what?
"The same question arises
for musical tastes. Do we
condition people to like
baroque music or do we
condition a fondness for music
in general?"
The question is: At what
value or ability level are our
conditioning procedures
supposed to operate? The
behaviorist "is not going to
condition each miniscule
preference or ability in each
member of society. I mean he
is not going to decide that so
and so many people should be
devotees of the late Beethoven
quartets, and that so and so
many people are going to be
admirers of Bach piano sonatas
played without the pedal."

Let us assume, then, that
the conditioning procedures are
going to be applied at the
most general level: "we are
going to produce so and so
many musicians, so and so
many artists, etc. We are not
going to produce as a matter
of deliberate policy a given

number of baroque pianists, a
given number of impressionists,
and so on."
What can we expect to be
the result in such a situation?
"While the number of people
who have musical interests and
abilities is something that we
can expect to be constant
(because we are fixing it) the
number of people who like any
kind of music and the number
who are skilled in the
production of any kind of
music is something that is
likely to vary."
On the secondary level of
kinds of music, "there is an
area for which we might call a
free interplay of competing
values," and "there is reason to
expect that there will be some
sort of building on what is
already in existence. Gifted

musicians will see the
possibility of innovating, of
building upon the stock of
values and knowledge which
they already possess, in the
same way that this was done
in the old society, in the way
for example, in which Mahler
is said to have built on

Wagner, and Schoenberg on
Mahler. And we can also
