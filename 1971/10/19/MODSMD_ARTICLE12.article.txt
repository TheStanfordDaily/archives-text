# Melina Mecouri Speaks On Greece

### DANIEL BRENNER 
International film star Melina
Mercouri asserted that the big
powers of the world had sold out
the greek people during an
interview at a reception for the
Greek democratic underground at
Stanford Sunday.
"Now we are betrayed from
everywhere," declared the star of
"Never On Sunday" and
"Phaedra." America (has sold) us
out and imposed military juntas."
Mercouri spoke earlier that
afternoon to about 200 people at
a champagne reception' in the
garden home of Mrs. Paul Wallin.
Among people at the reception
were Joan Baez, Paul Schrade,
national organizer for the United
Auto Workers, and numerous
Stanford professors.
But removed from the radical
chic environment of bubbling
champagne and chilled caviar, the
exiled woman-without-a-country
spoke with intense seriousness and
conviction.
"It is easy here (in America) to
speak out; I express myself. In
Greece it's impossible. If you
speak, if you say un word, you are
in the security police and you are

tortured," she said in her
French-English idiom.
She believes that the real seat
of power in Greece lies in
Washington. Labeling the
American government fascist, she
insisted that it is with the blessing
of the CIA, the State Department,
and the Pentagon that the junta
holds its power.
Her cause is not the idle
preoccupation of a bellweather
revolutionary. She was threatened
with 5-kilo dynamite sticks in a
hotel in Genoa; the FBI has
warned her of threats upon her in
America.
"I am not confident of
governments. I am confident of
people. . .like you," she remarked.
Exiled by her own country, she
refused to take up American
citizenship. "It's not
possible. . .it's like I would accept
the laws of the junta," Mercouri
said of becoming an American.
She uses a special passport issued
by the Swiss government.
She still does films. Her last
picture, "Promise of Doom," was
not what she hoped for. She
wanted to do a political film
about Greece but film studios
refused to take it, claiming it was

"too political."
So she remarked that she will
try to do the film on her own
with the assistance of her
producer/director husband Jules
Dassin. As for "Z," a
documentary-feature about
political repression in Greece, it
was a good film but politically
outdated.
Turning to America's young
people, she challenged them to act
to fight fascism. "Listen," she said
to each of the young reporters in
the room. "Now you have the
power. Now you can do the real
thing. Don't ask me what you can
do. You have the power to do it
and you are the hope of the
world," she said.
"Do it. You have the power.
Vote. Vote with force and
dedication," she implored the
reporters.
Her time for the frankness of a
press conference was over. But
even as she got up from the
bedseat which she had been using
for a podium, she repeated "do
it"and "action" until she was
pulled from the bedroom into the
society of those who had come to
do her honor.

recent book on the Tribe the Spindlers state, "The Menomini way as a distinctive culture, derived from its
own past and independent of Whiteman culture, is nearly gone."
