### JOANNE JACOBS (First in a two part series) 
"Sit quiet like a stone and let
thoughts come to you. Think
about a leaf in a pool."
—Menomini elder speaking to his
grandson.
"The Menomini culture as a
way of thinking, as well as a way
of doing, was discongruent with
Western culture, and no form of
real divergence was tolerated in
the Whiteman American mania for
assimilation and conformity,"
write George and Louise Spindler.
Stanford anthropologists, in their
newly-published book, Dreamers
Without Power (Holt, Rinehart
and Winston).
The couple's case study of the
Wisconsin Indian tribe reflects the
struggles of U.S. minority groups
and Third World cultures to
creatively adapt to "politically
and economically dominant"
America.
The Spindlers focus on a
subordinated people's ways of
coping with an intolerant alien
culture, ways of "recreating the
social and cultural bases of
identity.''
They emphasize that there is
no one Indian language, culture or
way of life. There are 12 major
families, 37 5 specific languages,
more distinct than French and
German, and several thousand
tribes.
Even within one tribe, like the
Menomini, there are five disparate
groups. The book concentrates on
Menomini who have kept some of
their culture, the "native-

oriented" and peyotists.
Only three per cent of the
Menomini can be considered
native-oriented. These people live
back in the woods and maintain
the Dream Dance, the Medicine
Lodge, the War Dance and other
basically religious rituals.
Their life is itself an adaptation
to white culture, the Spindlers
write.
Rituals Seen
The book reports one case
where an initiate to the Medicine
Lodge lacked the inherited
medicine bag and none could be
found to borrow for the ritual.
"A week ago the hock shop
was full of them," one of the
women said, "but everybody must
have got theirs for the dance so
there's none left when we need
one."
At the high point of the
ceremony, participants shoot each
other with small cowrie shells
kept in the stomach of each bag.
Being accidentally shot can be
fatal to the uninitiated, they
believe.
Their first month with the
Menomini, the young
anthropologists discovered a
Medicine Lodge off the highway.
George Spindler "disregarded all
rules of conduct for fieldworkers
and slid in through a narrow slit
between two sections of canvas,
tripped and fell into the action."
He was "shot" during the ritual
and later had to be hospitalized
for a week with a high fever of
"undiagnosed origin."
These traditionalists are
holding their own against the
hostility of accultured Indians,
smalltown whites and the
"ethnocidal" policy of the Bureau
of Indian Affairs (BIA).
Until 1934, the official policy
of the BIA was to "Americanize"
the Indians, to make them think
and act white. Native-oriented

parents fear that their children
will lose their culture.
"1 wonder if I'm going to be
strong enough to get 'urn on my
side," a woman told the Spindlers.
Severe White Schools
The traditional methods of
child-raising, emphasizing respect
and concern, are highly tolerant
and supportive, in stark contrast
to the child's experience in white
schools.
For years children were
severely punished for speaking
their native language in BIA
schools. Child-raising, religion,
dress and behavior were attacked
by officials, teachers and
missionaries, causing cultural
trauma and identity crisis.
"Some Menomini have 'made
it' and are successful businessmen
or skilled laborers," the book
says. "Only a very few of these
have been able to retain any
vestige of their history as
Indians."
The elite accultured who run
Menominee County, "live exactly
like we do," Louise Spindler
comments. "They send their kids
to college, belong to the country
club, have all the conveniences in
their homes." Often fractionally
Menomini, the elite live isolated
from their less assimilated
tribesmen.
The lower-class accultured
often work in the sawmill and live
like working class whites. These
small groups, who have adapted
by giving up their former identity,
are almost entirely Catholic.
Indian Religion
For other Menomini, the
Native American Church, an
integration of Indian and
Christian religion based on the use
of peyote, is a highly effective
way of coping with cultural

conflict, according to the
Spindlers.
The hallucinogenic drug, used
for centuries in the Southwest,
was introduced to the Menomini
in 1911. "The ancient religion had
been weakened or destroyed, yet
they couldn't accept
Christianity," Louise Spindler
explains.
For a people who gain power
through dreams and visions, the
peyote experience was
particularly meaningful. George
Spindler believes, "There are a lot
of positive aspects of the peyote
religion."
Peyote is used for curing,
delivering babies and as a religious
sacrament. "The alternative is
often apathy, drunkenness and
lack of group support," he adds.
Although the drug is banned,
the use of peyote as a religious
sacrament has been declared legal
in a significant number of cases.
The book comments that the
highly supportive atmosphere of
the peyote meeting parallels an
encounter group. Participants feel
a sense of salvation and
redemption.
Cultural Limbo
However, many of the
Menomini live in cultural limbo,
caught between Indian and white
identity.
Frank Bear represents these
in-between people in his
interpretation of a Rorschach
card. "This looks. . .like a totem
pole. . .Seems to tell the story of a
country—them symbols are all up
here—the rest of the people down
here are all dead, like a dead
planet. It seems to tell the story
of a people once mighty, that
have lost. . .like something
happened—and all that's left is the
symbol."
"Sit quiet like a stone and let
thoughts come to you. Think
about a leaf in a pool."
—Menomini elder speaking to his
grandson.
"The Menomini culture as a
way of thinking, as well as a way

back in the woods and maintain
the Dream Dance, the Medicine
Lodge, the War Dance and other
basically religious rituals.
Their life is itself an adaptation
to white culture, the Spindlers
write.
Rituals Seen
The book reports one case
where an initiate to the Medicine
Lodge lacked the inherited
medicine bag and none could be
found to borrow for the ritual.
"A week ago the hock shop
was full of them," one of the
women said, "but everybody must
have got theirs for the dance so
there's none left when we need
one."
At the high point of the
ceremony, participants shoot each
other with small cowrie shells
kept in the stomach of each bag.
Being accidentally shot can be
fatal to the uninitiated, they
believe.
Their first month with the
Menomini, the young
anthropologists discovered a
Medicine Lodge off the highway.
George Spindler "disregarded all
rules of conduct for fieldworkers
and slid in through a narrow slit
between two sections of canvas,
tripped and fell into the action."
He was "shot" during the ritual
and later had to be hospitalized
for a week with a high fever of
"undiagnosed origin."
These traditionalists are
holding their own against the
hostility of accultured Indians,
smalltown whites and the
"ethnocidal" policy of the Bureau
of Indian Affairs (BIA).
Until 1934, the official policy
of the BIA was to "Americanize"
the Indians, to make them think
and act white. Native-oriented

parents fear that their children
will lose their culture.
"1 wonder if I'm going to be
strong enough to get 'urn on my
side," a woman told the Spindlers.
Severe White Schools
The traditional methods of
child-raising, emphasizing respect
and concern, are highly tolerant
and supportive, in stark contrast
to the child's experience in white
schools.
For years children were
severely punished for speaking
their native language in BIA
schools. Child-raising, religion,
dress and behavior were attacked
by officials, teachers and
missionaries, causing cultural
trauma and identity crisis.
"Some Menomini have 'made
it' and are successful businessmen
or skilled laborers," the book
says. "Only a very few of these
have been able to retain any
vestige of their history as
Indians."
The elite accultured who run
Menominee County, "live exactly
like we do," Louise Spindler
comments. "They send their kids
to college, belong to the country
club, have all the conveniences in
their homes." Often fractionally
Menomini, the elite live isolated
from their less assimilated
tribesmen.
The lower-class accultured
often work in the sawmill and live
like working class whites. These
small groups, who have adapted
by giving up their former identity,
are almost entirely Catholic.
Indian Religion
For other Menomini, the
Native American Church, an
integration of Indian and
Christian religion based on the use
of peyote, is a highly effective
way of coping with cultural

conflict, according to the
Spindlers.
The hallucinogenic drug, used
for centuries in the Southwest,
was introduced to the Menomini
in 1911. "The ancient religion had
been weakened or destroyed, yet
they couldn't accept
Christianity," Louise Spindler
explains.
For a people who gain power
through dreams and visions, the
peyote experience was
particularly meaningful. George
Spindler believes, "There are a lot
of positive aspects of the peyote
religion."
Peyote is used for curing,
delivering babies and as a religious
sacrament. "The alternative is
often apathy, drunkenness and
lack of group support," he adds.
Although the drug is banned,
the use of peyote as a religious
sacrament has been declared legal
in a significant number of cases.
The book comments that the
highly supportive atmosphere of
the peyote meeting parallels an
encounter group. Participants feel
a sense of salvation and
redemption.
Cultural Limbo
However, many of the
Menomini live in cultural limbo,
caught between Indian and white
identity.
Frank Bear represents these
in-between people in his
interpretation of a Rorschach
card. "This looks. . .like a totem
pole. . .Seems to tell the story of a
country—them symbols are all up
here—the rest of the people down
here are all dead, like a dead
planet. It seems to tell the story
of a people once mighty, that
have lost. . .like something
happened—and all that's left is the
symbol."
"Sit quiet like a stone and let
thoughts come to you. Think
about a leaf in a pool."
—Menomini elder speaking to his
grandson.
"The Menomini culture as a
way of thinking, as well as a way
of doing, was discongruent with
Western culture, and no form of
real divergence was tolerated in
the Whiteman American mania for
assimilation and conformity,"
write George and Louise Spindler.
Stanford anthropologists, in their
newly-published book, Dreamers
Without Power (Holt, Rinehart
and Winston).
The couple's case study of the
Wisconsin Indian tribe reflects the
struggles of U.S. minority groups
and Third World cultures to
creatively adapt to "politically
and economically dominant"
America.
The Spindlers focus on a
subordinated people's ways of
coping with an intolerant alien
culture, ways of "recreating the
social and cultural bases of
identity.''
They emphasize that there is
no one Indian language, culture or
way of life. There are 12 major
families, 37 5 specific languages,
more distinct than French and
German, and several thousand
tribes.
Even within one tribe, like the
Menomini, there are five disparate
groups. The book concentrates on
Menomini who have kept some of
their culture, the "native-

oriented" and peyotists.
Only three per cent of the
Menomini can be considered
native-oriented. These people live
back in the woods and maintain
the Dream Dance, the Medicine

basically religious rituals.

and act white. Native-oriented

parents fear that their children
will lose their culture.
"1 wonder if I'm going to be
strong enough to get 'urn on my
side," a woman told the Spindlers.
Severe White Schools
The traditional methods of
child-raising, emphasizing respect
and concern, are highly tolerant
and supportive, in stark contrast
to the child's experience in white
schools.
For years children were
severely punished for speaking
their native language in BIA
schools. Child-raising, religion,
dress and behavior were attacked
by officials, teachers and
missionaries, causing cultural
trauma and identity crisis.
"Some Menomini have 'made
it' and are successful businessmen
or skilled laborers," the book
says. "Only a very few of these
have been able to retain any
vestige of their history as
Indians."
The elite accultured who run
Menominee County, "live exactly
like we do," Louise Spindler
comments. "They send their kids
to college, belong to the country
club, have all the conveniences in
their homes." Often fractionally
Menomini, the elite live isolated
from their less assimilated
tribesmen.
The lower-class accultured
often work in the sawmill and live
like working class whites. These
small groups, who have adapted
by giving up their former identity,
are almost entirely Catholic.
Indian Religion
For other Menomini, the
Native American Church, an
integration of Indian and
Christian religion based on the use
of peyote, is a highly effective
way of coping with cultural

conflict, according to the
Spindlers.
The hallucinogenic drug, used
for centuries in the Southwest,
was introduced to the Menomini
in 1911. "The ancient religion had
been weakened or destroyed, yet
they couldn't accept
Christianity," Louise Spindler
explains.
For a people who gain power
through dreams and visions, the
peyote experience was
particularly meaningful. George
Spindler believes, "There are a lot
of positive aspects of the peyote
religion."
Peyote is used for curing,
delivering babies and as a religious
sacrament. "The alternative is
often apathy, drunkenness and
lack of group support," he adds.
Although the drug is banned,
the use of peyote as a religious
sacrament has been declared legal
in a significant number of cases.
The book comments that the
highly supportive atmosphere of
the peyote meeting parallels an
encounter group. Participants feel
a sense of salvation and
redemption.
Cultural Limbo
However, many of the
Menomini live in cultural limbo,
caught between Indian and white
identity.
Frank Bear represents these
in-between people in his
interpretation of a Rorschach
card. "This looks. . .like a totem
pole. . .Seems to tell the story of a
country—them symbols are all up
here—the rest of the people down
here are all dead, like a dead
planet. It seems to tell the story
of a people once mighty, that
have lost. . .like something
happened—and all that's left is the
symbol."
"Sit quiet like a stone and let
thoughts come to you. Think
about a leaf in a pool."
—Menomini elder speaking to his
grandson.
"The Menomini culture as a
way of thinking, as well as a way
of doing, was discongruent with
Western culture, and no form of
real divergence was tolerated in
the Whiteman American mania for
assimilation and conformity,"
write George and Louise Spindler.
Stanford anthropologists, in their
newly-published book, Dreamers
Without Power (Holt, Rinehart
and Winston).
The couple's case study of the
Wisconsin Indian tribe reflects the
struggles of U.S. minority groups
and Third World cultures to
creatively adapt to "politically
and economically dominant"
America.
The Spindlers focus on a
subordinated people's ways of
coping with an intolerant alien
culture, ways of "recreating the
social and cultural bases of
identity.''
They emphasize that there is
no one Indian language, culture or
way of life. There are 12 major
families, 37 5 specific languages,
more distinct than French and
German, and several thousand
tribes.
Even within one tribe, like the
Menomini, there are five disparate
groups. The book concentrates on
Menomini who have kept some of
their culture, the "native-

oriented" and peyotists.
Only three per cent of the
Menomini can be considered
native-oriented. These people live
back in the woods and maintain
the Dream Dance, the Medicine
Lodge, the War Dance and other
basically religious rituals.
Their life is itself an adaptation
to white culture, the Spindlers
write.
Rituals Seen
The book reports one case
where an initiate to the Medicine
Lodge lacked the inherited
medicine bag and none could be
found to borrow for the ritual.
"A week ago the hock shop
was full of them," one of the
women said, "but everybody must
have got theirs for the dance so
there's none left when we need
one."
At the high point of the
ceremony, participants shoot each
other with small cowrie shells
kept in the stomach of each bag.
Being accidentally shot can be
fatal to the uninitiated, they
believe.
Their first month with the
Menomini, the young
anthropologists discovered a
Medicine Lodge off the highway.
George Spindler "disregarded all
rules of conduct for fieldworkers
and slid in through a narrow slit
between two sections of canvas,
tripped and fell into the action."
He was "shot" during the ritual
and later had to be hospitalized
for a week with a high fever of
"undiagnosed origin."
These traditionalists are
holding their own against the
hostility of accultured Indians,
smalltown whites and the
"ethnocidal" policy of the Bureau
of Indian Affairs (BIA).
Until 1934, the official policy
of the BIA was to "Americanize"
the Indians, to make them think
and act white. Native-oriented

parents fear that their children
will lose their culture.
