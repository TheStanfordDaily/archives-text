FILM SERIES: 10:00 p.m. Branner
Dining Room. "Death of Socrates."
Socrates in dying posed a difficult

the philosopher (we might say
academic or intellectual) to the truth
or to society? The problem, as
elaborated by Plato in his dialogues the
Crito and Phaedo, involves the meaning
of death as well as life. The film is a
BBC production, directed by Jonathan
Miller. Done in modern dress, it is both
faithful to the original text and to its
contemporary significance. 45 minutes.
