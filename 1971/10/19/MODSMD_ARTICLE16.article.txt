# Creedence Concert Thrills Thousands
## 
### JOSEPH FIKSEL 
Has success spoiled Creedence Clearwater Revival? The question
was certainly irrelevant to the 14,000 spectators that thronged the
Oakland Coliseum last Saturday night for an electrifying concert by
America's premiere rock group.
But what is happening to Creedence Clearwater? For years they
dominated the pop charts, appealing to a broad audience solely on the
basis of their precise, beautiful rock sound.
Remember "Green River"? That first song which resonated clear
and bell-like across the pop music scene, established a style that has
remained unique and recognizable in a long string of subsequent hits.
John Fogerty, leader and guiding spirit of the group, wrote and
produced almost all of their music. With an amazing creative
consistency, he combined fresh, thoughtful lyrics with superb, tight
and intricate guitar arrangements.
Because of their musical sophistication, and their rustic,
unassuming personal images, Creedence became symbols of purism
and artistry in American rock.
But last January, as they released their newest album, "Pendulum,"
they seemed restless and dissatisfied with their roles.
"What About Us!"
After eleven years together, and six million records sold, they felt
entitled to more public limelight as individual performers. Why should
the Beatles get so much attention? Creedence grumbled that they too
possessed social consciousness; that they too wanted to change
people's heads.
True enough, while their music is übiquitous, their personalities are
invisible. And critics have pointed out that their albums are just
collections of singles, rather thai coherent musical statements. In a
way, this was the beauty of Creedence Clearwater. No personality
cults, no commercialism, just fine, gimmickless music.
But nothing can resist change. Stu Cook, who played bass at the
time, announced that "Pendulum" represented a turning point for the
group. "We'd gone as far in one direction as we wanted and now we're
swinging back."
Well, the album showed more self-consciousness than innovation,
casting doubt upon exactly what this new direction was. And in
March, John's older brother Tom decided to strike out on his own,
shifting to a calmer, more gentle style.
Since then, Creedence has continued as a trio. No one is certain
what form will emerge from this period of transition, but John
Avowed that they would sound considerably different in concert.
Little Magic Lost
On the contrary! Although they looked very different, their sound
was the same—a confident recapitulation of many of their old hits.
With Stu replacing Tom at rhythm guitar, little of the magic was lost,
and they pranced through the concert in their smart new clothes.
New clothes? Wait, fellows, is this your grand metamorphasis?
John looked like an aging British rock idol in a natty
tangerine-colored suit, and even Doug Clifford, the drummer, sported
a shimmering, metallic tank top. Vanished are the country boys who
posed with those black urchins on the cover of "Willie and the Poor
Boys" album.
If it worked for the Beatles, maybe it will work for Creedence.
Rarely does a group generate as much excitement as they did
Saturday night. Each time the first familiar chords of another favorite
rolled form John's guitar, the youthful audience cheered exultantly.
About midway through, as they leaped into an inspired rendition
of "Proud Mary," their fans could resist the magnetism no longer.
Thousands of teen-agers came surging down the aisles like a human
tidal wave, engulfing the ushers, and crowding wildly around the
stage.
John was in triumphant form, delivering his driving vocals, brilliant
guitar passages, and mouth organ solos with unfaltering energy. His
reign of popularity appears secure.
Still, one wonders if this is really the kind of new image that
Creedence Clearwater originally envisioned. Or is physical glamor
merely a means to a more serious end?
As John Fogerty oozed into the final number, he tossed his
handkerchief to the swooning fans, in a gesture reminiscent of Tom
Jones. Now that is a bit hard to take seriously.
