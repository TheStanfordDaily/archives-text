# Exuberant Mime Troupe Drama
## 
### DOUG ARTHUR 
What has CIA agents, a fakir,
and puppets? If you shouted the
Stanford Research Institute,
perhaps. Actually, the San
Francisco Mime Troupe has this,
and much more, in their current
production, "The Dragon Lady's
Revenge." "Revenge. . takes
place in Long Pinh, the capital of
Cochin, which is a small country
in SE Asia. Cochin has been
invaded by Western armies who
have chosen General Rong Q as
the Head of State. The only
problem is the growing drug use
among the troops. The insidious
Dragon Lady, a big supplier, must
be sacrificed by the US
Ambassador (Clyde Dillsworth
Junker III).
Besides the surprise ending
where the revolutionaries win, the
plot contains many clever
intricacies. The perpetual puppet
(Rong Q) is really a masochist
intent upon the Dragon Lady's
foot. A secret weapon, X-90, is
developed to attack only yellow
skin. The White Monkey Bar
provides the scene for much
intrigue. Finally, we have the CIA
and Mr. Big.
Inchoate
It does become involved, and
some of the lines border on the
inchoate. For instance, the
Ambassador explains the troop
withdrawals (to neighboring
countries) to his son, a lieutenant
in the Army. He states that the
army is there because it
desperately wants to get out. Now
who would believe that?
The plot did seem vaguely
familiar, and the audience of
about 500 was quite vocal and
appreciative throughout the
performance. The actors began
with warm-up exercises, juggling
wooden pins, dancing and singing.
The lyrics to the tune of "Money"
especially delighted the crowd.
you need cash
you need it fast
rip it off
from the ruling class
they say the best things
in life are free
when you steal them
from the bourgeoisie
The company then mounted
the raised platform which served
as their stage. The pagoda shape
of the stage, the painted drops
which denoted the locale, and the
broad, mechanical gestures of the
actors all served to give the
impression of a big puppet show.
Music from a variety of
instruments (clarinet, base drum,
chimes, xylophone, accordion,
horn, cymbal) accentuated the

dialog. I suppose I would term the
play a cloak and dagger satire.
To The Rescue!
Spontaneous applause greeted
several moments in the play. At
one point, Blossom, a
revolutionary, is tied up and
threatened by an advancing stave
of knives. The Ambassador's
servant rescues her just in time.
The play appeared most
enjoyable when the actors
acknowledged the humor inherent
in the satire. On the other hand,
the conclusion dragged somewhat
due to a beat-them-over-the-head
propaganda approach. This was
unnecessary for any college

audience, much less so for
Stanford.
The show's star, Dragon
Lady, looked ravishing in her long
purple gown with black
ostrich-feather trim. Her heavy
makeup, purple eyeshadow, and
elaborate hairdo identified her as
a woman of the world. She had
the widest range of facial
expressions in the troupe, and her
gestures were always
comprehensible.
The girl who played Rong Q
gave the type of oddly fervent,
aggressively monomaniacal
performance that we expect from
the petty rulers of small SE Asian

countries. The US Ambassador
was about what I expected,
shrewd, conniving, hypocritical.
The actor made a very convincing
Clyde Junker 11. He could have
been on the evening news, and no
one would have been the wiser.
Another exciting character was
that of the mysterious priest, who
comes up from the trapdoor to
give fixes with his crusi-fix. He
managed to convey the same
scheming character in a host of
different disguises.
The form of toe Troupe has
changed from mines, to comedia,
to the present straight drama
mode. There are still traces of the

mime technique in the gestures,
and I find a definite element of
the circus.
The Mime troupe's goal
involves reaching a broader
constituency, not just the college
audience. To this effect, they have
been entertaining striking dock
workers on the waterfront in San
Francisco. They attempt to reach
diverse spectators to test the
validity of their theatre, and
adopt theatrical vehicles for wider
appeal. Their exuberance is most
refreshing, and 1 hope to see them
back at Stanford soon.

Junker III).
Besides the surprise ending
where the revolutionaries win, the
plot contains many clever
intricacies. The perpetual puppet
(Rong Q) is really a masochist
intent upon the Dragon Lady's
foot. A secret weapon, X-90, is
developed to attack only yellow
skin. The White Monkey Bar
provides the scene for much
intrigue. Finally, we have the CIA
and Mr. Big.
Inchoate
It does become involved, and
some of the lines border on the
inchoate. For instance, the
Ambassador explains the troop
withdrawals (to neighboring
countries) to his son, a lieutenant
in the Army. He states that the
army is there because it
desperately wants to get out. Now
who would believe that?
The plot did seem vaguely
familiar, and the audience of
about 500 was quite vocal and
appreciative throughout the
performance. The actors began
with warm-up exercises, juggling
wooden pins, dancing and singing.
The lyrics to the tune of "Money"
especially delighted the crowd.
you need cash
you need it fast
rip it off
from the ruling class
they say the best things
in life are free
when you steal them
from the bourgeoisie
The company then mounted
the raised platform which served
as their stage. The pagoda shape
of the stage, the painted drops
which denoted the locale, and the
broad, mechanical gestures of the
actors all served to give the
impression of a big puppet show.
Music from a variety of
instruments (clarinet, base drum,
chimes, xylophone, accordion,
horn, cymbal) accentuated the

dialog. I suppose I would term the
play a cloak and dagger satire.
To The Rescue!
Spontaneous applause greeted
several moments in the play. At
one point, Blossom, a
revolutionary, is tied up and
threatened by an advancing stave
of knives. The Ambassador's
servant rescues her just in time.
The play appeared most
enjoyable when the actors
acknowledged the humor inherent
in the satire. On the other hand,
the conclusion dragged somewhat
due to a beat-them-over-the-head
propaganda approach. This was
unnecessary for any college

audience, much less so for
Stanford.
The show's star, Dragon
Lady, looked ravishing in her long
purple gown with black
ostrich-feather trim. Her heavy
makeup, purple eyeshadow, and
elaborate hairdo identified her as
a woman of the world. She had
the widest range of facial
expressions in the troupe, and her
gestures were always
comprehensible.
The girl who played Rong Q
gave the type of oddly fervent,
aggressively monomaniacal
performance that we expect from
the petty rulers of small SE Asian

countries. The US Ambassador
was about what I expected,
shrewd, conniving, hypocritical.
The actor made a very convincing
Clyde Junker 11. He could have
been on the evening news, and no
one would have been the wiser.
Another exciting character was
that of the mysterious priest, who
comes up from the trapdoor to
give fixes with his crusi-fix. He
managed to convey the same
scheming character in a host of
different disguises.
The form of toe Troupe has
changed from mines, to comedia,
to the present straight drama
mode. There are still traces of the

mime technique in the gestures,
and I find a definite element of
the circus.
The Mime troupe's goal
involves reaching a broader
constituency, not just the college
audience. To this effect, they have
been entertaining striking dock
workers on the waterfront in San
Francisco. They attempt to reach
diverse spectators to test the
validity of their theatre, and
adopt theatrical vehicles for wider
appeal. Their exuberance is most
refreshing, and 1 hope to see them
back at Stanford soon.
What has CIA agents, a fakir,
and puppets? If you shouted the
Stanford Research Institute,
perhaps. Actually, the San
Francisco Mime Troupe has this,
and much more, in their current
production, "The Dragon Lady's
Revenge." "Revenge. . takes
place in Long Pinh, the capital of
Cochin, which is a small country
in SE Asia. Cochin has been
invaded by Western armies who
have chosen General Rong Q as
the Head of State. The only
problem is the growing drug use
among the troops. The insidious
Dragon Lady, a big supplier, must
be sacrificed by the US
Ambassador (Clyde Dillsworth
Junker III).
