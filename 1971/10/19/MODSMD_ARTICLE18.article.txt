# Strong SF 'Onegin'
## 
### GARY SCHMIDGALL 
The San Francisco Opera has added a
wonderfully idiomatic new production of
Tchaikovsky's "Eugene Onegin" to its repertory,
and its excellence was enough to make this
essentially second-rate opera a first-rate operatic
experience. Incredibly, this English-language
"Onegin" is the S.F. premiere of the 90-year-old
work. Done in such an unabashedly unpretentious
and stylish manner, the venture was clearly worth
undertaking.
It is so easy to condescend toward Tchaikovsky.
For me, he is the Tennyson of 19th century opera.
He was not a profound composer, and though his
music is invariably pleasant, ingratiating and often
compelling, it is often puddle-deep in intellectual
content. Tchaikovsky was a man of sentiment, not
intellect and great artists with this bias are rare.
"Onegin" shares thoroughly in these
Tchaikovskian hallmarks. Though there are no
overpowering ideas or dramatic high points (or, let it
be said, lowpoints), though some of the interstitial
music is yawn-provoking, still the opera has many
excellences to recommend a hearing. As one might
expect, there is marvelous dance music, including
the familiar waltz and polonaise, highly evocative
folkloristic scoring, a few splendid little ensemble
pieces, the outstanding letter scene and Lensky's
fine aria.
The plot of "Onegin" (based on Pushkin's poem)
is simplicity itself, and the drama of the opera is
generally helped by the new English translation.
This translation has many awkward moments
(especially disyllabizing of monosyllables) and
should not be considered satisfactory in its present
form. Aside from this, I don't suppose anything can
save an English version from the occasionally
uproarious expedience or insipidity of the original
Russian.
The principals all sang and acted to happy effect.
As Tatyana, Evelyn Lear commanded all the
nuances available to love-sick, overwraught youth in
the first scenes and made a nice change to
over-wraught adulthood later on. Vocally, Lear was
at her best in making her role a recognizably
complete entity, relying primarily upon delicate
phrasing and beautiful floated notes. She did not,

however, have quite the power topside at the few
points where it is needed.
Lear's husband, Thomas Stewart, was opposite
her as Onegin. Though perhaps a bit too old for the
part, he was in every other respect marvelous.
Appropriately, he made his vocal and visual
presence overwhelm all others. Stuart Burrows
sounded constricted as Lensky, until he opened up
to stunning effect in his duel-scene aria. This Act II
show-stopper is supposed to require a "white
Russian tenor" voice (whatever this may be);
Burrows must have one.
Given our composer, the ballet deserves special
comment. Though nothing daring was attempted by
the soloists, the corps de ballet (about 20 strong)
was given intelligent choreography and danced with
vigor and charm. Together with Tchaikovsky's
ineluctable rhythms, the dancers were never insipid,
which is usually the best one can expect in operatic
ballet.
The superb costumes came from the Met
"Onegin," and one of the most pleasantly idiomatic,
effective, and elaborate (7 separate scenes) stage
settings S.F. has seen were borrowed from the
Mannheim opera in Germany. What with huge
production costs, perhaps such inter-company
borrowing should become more common. Stage
director Paul Hager rose to the occasion with a
witty, sympathetic and very well timed piece of
work. Partial redemption for his "Meistersinger"
mistakes.
Conductor Charles Mackerras seems to have a
special gift for operas that require careful attention
to unique musical idiom (remember his
"Cenerentola"?), and he certainly helped "Onegin"
along in its intrepid struggle against modern
sensibilities.
If the struggle was not unqualifiedly successful,
the fault cannot be ascribed to the S.F. Opera,
which has given us an "Onegin" hard to improve
upon. Perhaps, the essence of this naive, romantic
opera with its prim novel-reading girls, lavish balls
and dueling is, as Onegin says of himself as the
curtain falls, "lost forever."
Eugene Onegin" will be presented again on
October 19, 22, 31.)
