# French Campus
## Student Busted On Hashish Charge 
### ED KOHN 
Special to the Daily
TOURS, France, Oct. 14 â€” A former
student at the Stanford overseas
campus here was arrested late last
month by French police and charged
with possession and trafficking large
amounts of hashish.
Police said that sophomore Christine
Corcoran, 19, a member of Group XXII
(which ended its six-month stay in
August) had between 300 and 4 00
grams of hashish and smoking
equipment in her possession when she
was arrested in a Tours hotel room at
6:30 a.m. on Sept. 24, just one day
after she returned to Tours to visit the
campus.
If convicted, Corcoran faces
between 2-10 years imprisonment
and/or a fine ranging between $1,000
and $1,000,000. After signing a
confession last week, she was released
on $25 0 bail. She is apparently free to
travel anywhere within Europe, but is
not allowed to return to the United
States.
Corcoran was last reported to be in
Vienna. Police have told her to return
to Tours by Dec. 11 to stand trial,
which is expected to last about one
day.
Campus Surveillance
Corcoran's arrest culminated several
months of intensive investigation
around the Stanford-in-France building,
which, according to Prof. Paul LeMoal,
director of the campus, was under
24-hour surveillance by police agents

stationed at nearby cafes. LeMoal, who
has been subpoenaed to testify as an
identity witness in the trial, said that at
the time he was unaware of the
surveillance and that police officials
have told him that their agents are
forbidden to enter the house without a
warrant.
At least 13 other persons have been
arrested as a result of Corcoran's
confession, in which she reportedly
named a total of 20 persons, all of
them French students. Three of the
French students arrested have
confessed to smoking in the campus's
library and in Corcoran's room. And
several Tours cafes, apparently used as
meeting places for hashish sales by
Corcoran and others, were closed
recently by police.
When they arrested Corcoran, whom
they described as a "major drug
trafficker" in the Tours-Loire region,
the police confiscated the hashish,
which they termed "superior," several
pipes and water-pipes, and other
smoking accessories.
Administration Notified
LeMoal, who repeatedly has told the
present group that the campus will be
closed by French authorities if they
detect drugs 01 dealing here, said that
the Stanford administration in
California has been made aware of the
situation. LeMoal said that this campus
has never had any trouble with the
police, and that police officials have
promised not to harass or monitor the
present group (XXIII).

Accounts of Corcoran's arrest,
which were carried prominently in
newspapers and on French national
radio this morning, did not mention
that Corcoran was a Stanford student;
they said only that she was "an
American student in Tours."
Police said they were first tipped off
about Corcoran's alleged activities
when they heard about an American
student named "Chris" who was
making frequent trips to Holland to
buy large amounts of hashish and then
selling it to students in Tours.
There have been at least two other
incidents involving the arrest of
overseas Stanford students on drug
charges. Several years ago, a student
from the British campus was arrested in
France for possession of hashish, and
two years ago, a student from the
Austrian campus served nearly a year
and a half in a British jail for possession
of hashish.
