# 'Drug Abuse -1970 To 1984'
## Symposium Investigates Drug Scene Aspects 
### 
Drug problems, solutions and positive
developments for the future were the subjects of a
Drug Abuse Symposium held on campus yesterday.
Drs. David Smith, Jerome Jaffe, Leo Hollister and
Donald Kennedy were among the speakers before an
audience of students, teachers, doctors and scientists.
The theory that former drug users cannot
completely return to modern society is nothing new.
However, Smith, director of the Haight-Ashbury Free
Medical Clinic, feels that the drug community can be
a "parallel culture" from which will come "not
presidents of General Motors but people-oriented
humanists."
Entitling his speech, "Youth and Drug Abuse:
Prediction for the Future," Smith outlined the
changing drug philosophy during the 1960'5. He also
discussed the fluctuating popularity of marijuana,
psychedelic drugs, stimulants and narcotics and
solutions to the problem.
Work Ethic A 'Social Dinosaur'
Extensive experimentation has convinced Smith
that drug users experience a dramatic change in life
style, the "psychedelic syndrome." After drugs,
people are less violent and more communal,
subscribing to a philosophy which is "a mixture of
the 19th and 21st centuries." Considering the work
ethic a "social dinosaur," Smith believes that "the
drug community's values can be positively utilized."
The legalization of marijuana, "the new social drug
of the current generation," is in the near future,

according to Smith. He feels that the legalization will
be due to the expense of keeping it illegal.
Calling heroin "the drug of despair," Smith is
pessimistic over the use of methadone treatments. He
feels that drug users distrust methadone as "a tool of
the dominant class to keep them quiet" and
advocates drug counselling rather than a substitute
drug.
Smith cited MDA as the newest psychedelic and
cocaine, "the speed freak's caviar," as the most
popular stimulant.
Presidential Appointee
Opening the evening session of the symposium,
Jaffe, director of the newly-created Specific Action
Office for Drug Abuse Prevention (SAUDAP),
delivered a "preliminary program report" on the goals
and achievements of the agency.
SAUDAP, created by Presidential order last June
17, is a "policy making" and "coordinating"
mechanism. SAUDAP has the authority to formulate
policy for government programs of drug abuse
prevention and to re-program funds from one
organization to another.
Problems facing SAUDAP are to define the
incidence of drug abuse, to monitor the link between
crime and drugs and to determine the treatment
capacity of and manpower available to research and
rehabilitation programs.
Making treatment available to the heroin addict is

SAUDAP's next goal, according to Jaffe.
The military policy change in treatment of drug
abuse as a health problem rather than as a disciplinary
problem was one of SAUDAP's initial
accomplishments. Since then, much of the agency's
attention has been directed to the military.
Since the institution of debarkation screening and
unit sweeps in Vietnam, the rate of "positives"
(positive reactions to tests for heroin) has steadily
dropped. Revised figures, made available by new
tests, should be released soon, according to Jaffe.
New Uses For Drugs
Hollister, of the Veterans Administration Hospital,
mentioned several new uses for drugs, including
combating depression, restoring memory and
enhancing sexuality in the middle-aged. A cure for
boredom might be to induce artificial hibernation .
"Empathy drugs" may be used to enable people to
have intense vicarious experiences although these
drugs make real life seem disappointingly tame.
Electrical intervention in the brain can produce
almost any type of human behavior, according to
Kennedy, chairman of the biology department. In
fact, it is already possible to produce highly
specialized behavior by stimulating specific brain
areas. Brain-wave control techniques are now being
used to produce "instant Zen" or mystical and
contemplative states. Unfortunately, this involves the
issue of who controls brainwave feedback machines.

Jaffe, director of the newly-created Specific Action
Office for Drug Abuse Prevention (SAUDAP),
delivered a "preliminary program report" on the goals
and achievements of the agency.
SAUDAP, created by Presidential order last June
17, is a "policy making" and "coordinating"
mechanism. SAUDAP has the authority to formulate
policy for government programs of drug abuse
prevention and to re-program funds from one
organization to another.
Problems facing SAUDAP are to define the
incidence of drug abuse, to monitor the link between
crime and drugs and to determine the treatment
capacity of and manpower available to research and
rehabilitation programs.
Making treatment available to the heroin addict is

SAUDAP's next goal, according to Jaffe.
The military policy change in treatment of drug
abuse as a health problem rather than as a disciplinary
problem was one of SAUDAP's initial
accomplishments. Since then, much of the agency's
attention has been directed to the military.
Since the institution of debarkation screening and
unit sweeps in Vietnam, the rate of "positives"
(positive reactions to tests for heroin) has steadily
dropped. Revised figures, made available by new
tests, should be released soon, according to Jaffe.
New Uses For Drugs
Hollister, of the Veterans Administration Hospital,
mentioned several new uses for drugs, including
combating depression, restoring memory and
enhancing sexuality in the middle-aged. A cure for
boredom might be to induce artificial hibernation .
"Empathy drugs" may be used to enable people to
have intense vicarious experiences although these
drugs make real life seem disappointingly tame.
Electrical intervention in the brain can produce
almost any type of human behavior, according to
Kennedy, chairman of the biology department. In
fact, it is already possible to produce highly
specialized behavior by stimulating specific brain
areas. Brain-wave control techniques are now being
used to produce "instant Zen" or mystical and
contemplative states. Unfortunately, this involves the
issue of who controls brainwave feedback machines.
Drug problems, solutions and positive
developments for the future were the subjects of a
Drug Abuse Symposium held on campus yesterday.
Drs. David Smith, Jerome Jaffe, Leo Hollister and
Donald Kennedy were among the speakers before an
audience of students, teachers, doctors and scientists.
The theory that former drug users cannot
completely return to modern society is nothing new.
However, Smith, director of the Haight-Ashbury Free
Medical Clinic, feels that the drug community can be
a "parallel culture" from which will come "not
presidents of General Motors but people-oriented
humanists."
Entitling his speech, "Youth and Drug Abuse:
Prediction for the Future," Smith outlined the
changing drug philosophy during the 1960'5. He also
discussed the fluctuating popularity of marijuana,
psychedelic drugs, stimulants and narcotics and
solutions to the problem.
Work Ethic A 'Social Dinosaur'
Extensive experimentation has convinced Smith
that drug users experience a dramatic change in life
style, the "psychedelic syndrome." After drugs,
people are less violent and more communal,
subscribing to a philosophy which is "a mixture of
the 19th and 21st centuries." Considering the work
ethic a "social dinosaur," Smith believes that "the
drug community's values can be positively utilized."
The legalization of marijuana, "the new social drug
of the current generation," is in the near future,

according to Smith. He feels that the legalization will
be due to the expense of keeping it illegal.
Calling heroin "the drug of despair," Smith is
pessimistic over the use of methadone treatments. He
feels that drug users distrust methadone as "a tool of
the dominant class to keep them quiet" and
advocates drug counselling rather than a substitute
drug.
Smith cited MDA as the newest psychedelic and
cocaine, "the speed freak's caviar," as the most
popular stimulant.
