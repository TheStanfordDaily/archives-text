# Franklin Testifies On Own Behalf
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
Associate Professor H. Bruce
Franklin took the stand in his dismissal
hearing yesterday. He testified that he
went to the Lodge speech planning
only to ask a question about the war
which he had been "saving up for
years."
In his testimony, which will
continue today at 1 p.m. in Physics
101, Franklin told the Advisory Board
"Stanford was being used" by Hoover
Institute in hosting a conference on the
United Nations. He said the conference
"systematically excluded" Third World
views.
Dismissal charges against Franklin
include participating in disruption of a
speech by Ambassador Henry Cabot
Lodge which was part of the
conference.
Hoover Institute Chairman W. Glenn
Campbell, the day's first witness, said
he had "not knowingly" invited a
Communist to participate in any of the
Hoover Institute's public conferences.
Campbell insisted, however, that

Hoover selected speakers on their
qualifications and "their record" rather
than their political views.
Franklin asked Campbell, a
University of California regent, about
his vote to oust Communist teacher
Angela Davis. Campbell said, "I think
Communists have a great deal of
difficulty in being objective."
Campbell said he "would just as
soon" not have Communists teaching in
the social sciences at Stanford.
The UN conference included
"widely divergent" viewpoints,
Campbell commented. He testified that
the People's Republic of China and
other Communist countries were not
represented because "it would have
been considerably difficult to get them
here." He added, "We decided against
inviting any ersatz Maoists."
Campbell, who consulted
occasionally with a public relations
assistant seated on the floor beside his
chair, said Lodge was invited because
he "acquitted himself very well" as
U.S. Ambassador to the UN.
Franklin asked whether Lodge, who
was also Ambassador to South
Vietnam, was "universally
commended." Campbell said, "Not
even Jesus Christ was universally
commended for his role." Franklin
objected to the analogy.
Campbell said one did not need
Communists on hand to study
communism. "We discuss Communist
views at the Hoover Institute all the
time."
Campbell, visibly nervous under
Franklin's unfriendly questioning, at
one point asked Board Chairman
Donald Kennedy, "How far, Mr.
Chairman, are we going to go?"
Kennedy several times rebuked
Franklin for "arguing with the
witness." The increasingly irritated
chairman told the snickering audience
he would accept no more "wisecracks
from the Peanut Gallery."
When Franklin himself took the
stand, he charged Campbell violated
University rules requiring a balanced
presentation of controversial issues.
Such programs must be approved in
advance by the Committee on Public
Events (CPE), Franklin said. Campbell
earlier conceded he had not submitted
the speakers' list to CPE because he did
not believe it necessary.
Franklin said he was "very
conscious" that the CPE rules were
being violated because he helped frame
them as chairman of a committee in
1964.
He said his extensive files on the war
showed Lodge was deeply involved in
the assassination of Premier Diem and
personally ordered US planes to help

suppress an internal rebellion in South
Vietnam in 1966.
Franklin said he went to the Lodge
speech wanting to ask only one
question from the floor-whether the
1966 action was linked to Lodge's
request several days earlier that
Congressmen temporarily halt visits to
South Vietnam.
During his comments, Franklin
unsuccessfully moved for dismissal of
the charge concerning the Lodge
incident. Kennedy said all of the
charges will be weighed at the case's
conclusion.
Four witnesses yesterday joined
about 14 other defense witnesses in
saying Franklin heckled only several
times during the Lodge incident.
Janice Alford, a student, said
Franklin was one of the least noisy
people in Dinkelspiel Auditorium,
rating "around 750" in the crowd of
800. She said much more noise came

from the elderly man behind her, who
yelled at protester Janet Weiss, "Shut
up, you damn bitch."
Tom Fricke, a junior not enrolled
this quarter, explained he worked at
Hoover last year and was an usher at
the Lodge incident. Fricke said the
ushers were told beforehand that there
might be disruptions and "to separate
any possible conflicting groups of
people" while seating them.
Venceremos member and student
Don Lee said he was sitting near
Franklin and holding a red flag which
he waved. He said a furious elderly man
in front of him tried to grab the flag
away.
Former Donner sponsor David
Laney said Franklin was "doing
nothing" but that two elderly
women—who were administration
witnesses against Franklin—yelled
furiously at prootesters and other
young people.
