# Board Denies Satisky's Rehiring, Similar Keilch Decision Assumed
## 
### BOB BACON 
A three-man grievance committee has recommended
that fired law school secretary DeVera Satisky not be
reinstated. The same decision is expected in the similar case
of library worker John Keilch.
Both presented evidence to the committee in an attempt
to win back the jobs from which they were fired for alleged
participation in the April 8-9 Stanford Hospital sit-in.
The final decision will be made in each case by Provost
William Miller. Miller told the Daily yesterday afternoon
that he has reached a decision regarding Satisky, but it
would not be made public unless Satisky wished to release
it. She has not yet received notice of the decision, but she
said "I'm sure it's not positive."
The recommendation regarding Keilch has not yet been
submitted to Miller, but Roy Boggs, a member of the
grievance committee in that case, has made public a
40-page minority report which urges that Keilch be rehired.
Boggs reported that the vote was 2-1 against Keilch, and
that the recommendation will be formalized later this
week. He doubts that Miller will overturn this ruling.
In both cases the two-man majority consisted of Elwood
Pierce, assistant controller of the Medical School, and
Byron Sher, Professor of The third, and dissenting,
member of Satisky's committee was library employee Jim
Breed love.
'Unacceptable Behavior'
University personnel director Robert M. Nelson, who
has since resigned, fired the two workers and three others
on June 22 for "unacceptable behavior" arising out of their
alleged part in the hospital demonstration. All five were

arrested at the hospital and have criminal charges pending.
For this reason, neither Keilch nor Satisky answered the
committee's questions regarding their participation in the
sit-in.
Satisky said that the committee's basis for its decision in
her case was that they thought it "reasonable" to infer
from the evidence Nelson gave that she took part in the
sit-in.
She vigorously disputes the inference.
The evidence consisted of four statements from
observers of events after the sit-in, none of which placed
her inside the occupied area.
She denounced the grievance procedure in which an
administrator and a faculty member are able to decide what
is "reasonable" and what consititutes "unacceptable
behavior." During her hearings before the committee she
complained that workers had no voice in formulating
personnel policy.
'Arbitrary Power'
Boggs raised a similar issue in his report on the Keilch
case. He said Keilch was "the object of arbitrary power
acting under the guise of lawful authority .. . Campus
administrators ... carry out policy for the monied interests
that own universities."
Another of the five fired workers, Anthony Chatmon,
was reinstated in August after his grievance proceeding.
Unlike Keilch and Satisky, he had discussed his role in the
activities at the hospital with the committee and was able
to exculpate himself to their satisfaction.
Satisky announced that a rally will be held in support of
her case on the law school steps tomorrow at 12 :15 p.m.
