Editorial
Yesterday was a long day tor Glenn Campbell. It started at 9 a.m.,
when the Director of the Hoover Institution addressed the opening of
a two-day Hoover-sponsored conference on "Iran: 25 Years ot
Achievement." And it continued for an hour and a half in the
afternoon when he submitted to detailed examination by Bruce
Franklin at his Advisory Board hearing.
Both the Iran conference (which was interupted by hecklers), and
the Franklin testimony (which dealt with last January's disruption ol
another Hoover-sponsored conference) once again brought to light the
attitudes and biases of the controversial institution and its
conservative director.
Compared to the size of the crowd and the volume of noise
generated by the hecklers who greeted Henry Cabot Lodge,
yesterday's interuption of speakers at the Iran conference at Tresidder
was minor. But the point made was valid: any so-called scholarly
conference purporting to present a fair study ot a subject is a sham if
it does not include speakers of divergent points of view.
To Campbell's credit, he responded to yesterday's disturbances by
offering Iranian students two hours to present their views of the
economic and social problems confronting their own country-a step
which should have been taken when the conference was in its planning
stages.
But judging from his statements made just two hours after his
decision, it appears Campbell has not been converted to the idea of
providing opposing points of view at "serious, scholarly
conference(s)" presented by the Institution. Especially if those
differing views are those of communists.
As a regent of the University of California, Campbell voted to bar
Angela Davis from the classroom, and he claims allowing a communist
to teach would not be in accordance with "the full exercise of
academic freedom." He went on to claim he has never selected
participants in Hoover conferences on the basis of their political
leanings, but admitted he had never "knowingly" invited a communist
to participate.
When he was appointed director in 1959, Campbell affirmed his
support for the Institution's policy statement reading, "The purpose
of this Institution must be ... to demonstrate the evils of the
doctrines of Karl Marx .. . and to reaffirm the validity of the
American system."
"I see nothing wrong with that do you?" asked Campbell. "There
are evils in Marxism and I hope we expose them." Unfortunately for
the ideal of objective debate and for the Stanford community, neither
Hoover nor its director seems to have changed over the past 12 years.
