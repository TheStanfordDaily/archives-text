The function of a senate is to
serve the interests and needs of its
constituency. I believe that this is
best accomplished through able
representation of specific interest
groups. My name is Edwin K.S.
Ryu and I am a candidate in the
General Studies division.
Essentially, my commitment is
firstly to the Third World, though
Amerasian Student Alliance which
serves to represent needs and
interests of Stanford Amerasians
and Amerasians of the
community. But this specific
representation relates to the
greater Stanford community in
that we all are in dire need of
exposure and understanding of
issues that exist outside
upbringing and outside Stanford.
In this, ethnic organizations
provide opportunity to respond to
this need by representing real
problems and real proposals for
change and solution.
An opportunity to respond to
this issue, is support for the Third
World Referendum which
hopefully will be on the ASSU
ballot. The proposed revenue
would largely go into initiation
and continuing of various cultural
and educational programs within
the Stanford community (e.g.
Ethnic studies) and more
importantly, within the minority
communities (e.g. tutoring
service). Thank you.

Many say I'm too short to be a
senator but I say it's what's up in
front that counts. My shrink said
running for office would be good
for me, better than cold showers
anyway. Besides I love busy work
and remember people's names
even if I don't care who in hell
they are. I hate fascists commies
moderates and self-inflicted
hickeys. I'm liberal—my 6 th grade
teacher was Black.
I think more ASSU money
should go to buying cool clothes
for our favorite teachers and
footballers. Besides politics I am
also interested in whittling and
towel chewing. I am willing to be
photographed anywhere on the
campus and in any position short
of obscenity. I am a good after
dinner speaker when I can keep
my hands on top of the table.
Some say political power comes
from the barrel of a gun. Right
on! Come, fire my musket at the
White House.

Rocky Barber was elected to
the ASSU Senate as a freshman.
He was elected deputy chairman

by the Senate in the spring of
1970. Re-elected last year, he
served on the Rules Committee.
Rocky has experience in other
branches of student government;
he is beginning his second term on
the SCLC (Student Conduct
Legislative Council). He has served
on student committees dealing
with ASSU financing and banking
practices and on one dealing with
the problems of student
administration liaison.
He is well acquainted with the
decision-making apparatus of the
University, and hopes to use his
knowledge to bring necessary
changes to the University and the
ASSU.
He is especially interested in
revising the Stanford judicial
system. Rocky will continue to
promote greater student influence
in the control of the University.

The seriousness with which
people take their social systems is
directly related to the
effectiveness of those systems.
Clearly, in recent years, the
Student Senate has been
discredited by its use as a forum
for -people propagating ideas
which are extraneous to the
essential, issues and needs of the
student body.
This emphasizes that the
Senate has not been taken with
due concern; and recently it has
become apparent to me that my
responsibility as a serious student
is to at least attempt, as best I
can, to bring an end to these
unacceptable circumstances. As
one of the few sincerely
concerned candidates representing
no special interest group but
instead the interests of the entire
student body, I ask for and
desperately need your vote.
Rocky S. Boeken
The Senate is a body which
possesses the potential for
justifying its own existence, but
has been unable to do so for two
major reasons: first, it is cursed
with an inexcusable amount of
petty personal bickering and
hatreds; and second, none of its
members are willing to spend the
time which is necessary in order
to accomplish anything. If I am
elected again, I will first, simply
refuse to engage in any way in
personal feuding, and second, I
will choose one or two attainable
goals and spend whatever time is
necessary to achieve them.
I will continue to try to cause
Tresidder Union administrators to
add to the improvements they
have begun there since I began to
put the pressure on them last
spring. When conditions there
become satisfactory, I will turn to
other areas calling for
attention —the Stanford

Bookstore, the Overseas Campus
Program.

In my two years in student
government here, private interest
power groups have turned the
Senate into a war zone dominated
by mindless political battles for
power and money. By electing
candidates who ran as teams and
then voted as blocks in the
Senate, the student body ensured
the Senate's ineffectiveness and its
unrepresentative nature. To avoid
another unrepresentative and
irresponsible Senate, the students
must elect candidates this year
who are independent of these
private interest groups."
That is why I am running for
the Senate as a representative of
only one body—the members of
my constituency. My aims: a
renewed student voice in
educational reform and fiscal
responsibility in the ASSU. My
experience: member—Student
Legislature (1968-69 ), Student
Education Council (19 69 ),
Student Senate (1969-70 ).
(Overseas last year.)
Chuck Fay
The successful passage of the
$0 fee assessment last spring has
created an opportunity for the
upcoming ASSU Senate to ignore
the temptations of power politics
and to concentrate on the
intended function of the Senate:
bringing about educational reform
where needed. This is not to
suggest that the longsuffering
Stanford student should get his or
her hopes up concerning student
government, which is inherently
nothing more nor less than a
sandbox.
However, useful and important
changes may come about with the
election of enough Senators who
are willing to abide by last year's
edict, "No more money, no more
games." Areas such as educational
reform and appointments to
Trustee Committees have
significance over and above that
of the ASSU and its political
machinery. These are the issues on
which I would concentrate.
Chris Hocker

The insularity of student
politics at Stanford has long been
a sadly recognized fact. And at no
time has this insularity been a
greater source of both
disappointment and dismay to
both the students of Stanford and
members of the outside
community than today. Faced
with an administration
increasingly willing to use force
and heavy-handed bureaucratic
tactics to achieve its own ends,
and with a student body which
refus'es to give the
already-troubled ASSU either its
physical or moral support, it is
necessary to seek out a new, more
dynamic, more relevant role for
the Senate as the representative
body of some 1 2,000 people.
To this end, the Senate must
not only continue in its solidarity
with the black and brown
members of the community, but
must also extend its concern
and protection to all the employees
of Stanford, as well as the people
in the area surrounding the
campus, on whose lives the
administration's actions have a
tremendous effect. As a full-time
employee at Stanford (Tresidder
Union), as well as a student, I feel
that I can help effect this
solidarity, while contributing to
an ASSU Senate the students can
get behind.

For the past three years I have
become increasingly angry at the
wave of intimidation and mob
violence to which we have been
subjected. My principal goals as a
senator will be a condemnation by
the Senate of violence as a
political tool, and Senate support
of the University Administration's
efforts to prosecute students,
staff, and faculty who use
intimidation as a short cut for
reason.
The Senate should press for a
Day Care Center for the children
of women students, staff, and
faculty, and for increased
minority admissions. Stanford's
dormitories are inadequate,
evidenced by our yearly May
draw-panic, which ought to be a
major area of student concern. To

remove the gross pork-barrel
politics with which the Senate is
often preoccupied, I advocate
student referenda or all
allocations of $3000 per year, or
more, in the future.

Do you question?
Do you need representation?
Do you need a Senate? Do you
need someone to tell your view to
so they will be represented in the
Senate?
Are you concerned with the
University, with what it does, and
how it does it? Are you concerned
with the communities around the
University, and how we relate to
them?
If your answer to these
qustions is no, then don't vote.
My answer is YES.
Doug McElwain
I believe the ASSU Senate
should take a position of
leadership in the student
community. Often, it has not.
Rather, it has been the scene of a
squabbling fight for king of the
mountain, with each side saying
"I am interested only in what I
want; what I have will never be
enough." First of all, the Senate
should work to bring the Peace
Movement together and back to
life. I could contribute.
I worked for the April 24 th
March and I am now working to
organize for the March on
November 6. The Senate should
set up a speaker and forum
program dealing with national
problems and community
problems, such as land use. Once
again, I could help. As a member
of the Pre-Reg Commission, I
brought Assemblyman Willy
Brown here to speak. The Senate
should also facilitate more student
programs. Here too, I am
experienced. I set up SWOPSI
102.
