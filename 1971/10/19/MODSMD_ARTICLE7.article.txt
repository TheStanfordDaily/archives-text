Revisionism
Editor, THE DAILY:
In Marxist-Leninist Linda
Crouse's column (18 October
1971), she criticizes the
philosophy of science which I
employed to attack B. F.
Skinner's behaviorism.
It is clear from her column,
and from personal conversations
she has had with me on this topic,
that Crouse believes that her
position is in accord with
dialectical materialism.
In fact, this is not true. In her
column, Crouse says, "We can
only make probabilistic
statements about nature at any
level," and in conversation with
me, she endorsed the Heisenberg
Uncertainty Principle. Crouse's
indeterminist position on physical
nature is the position of
positivism.
While I am neither a positivist
nor a dialectical materialist, the
dialectical materialist position is
much closer to being correct than
the positivist position which
Crouse adopts.
In his book Dialectical
Materialism, Gustav Wetter says,
"On the subject of indeterminism,
the Soviet philosophers... are
strenuous defenders of a
philosophical determinism, in face
of the indeterminism of quantum
physics .... So far as the problem

of quantum statistics is
concerned, Soviet philosophy is
averse to the idea that the merely
statistical character of quantum
laws arises, as the positivists
maintain, from the absence of
lawful connections among the
individual microphenomena."
Dialectical materialists have, as I
do, a deterministic interpretation
of quantum physics.
In socialist countries, Crouse's
position is condemned as
"physical idealism."

Lodge v.s. Soeer & Hess
Editor, THE DAILY:
The parallel Rachelle Marshall
draws between Lodge on the one
hand and Speer and Hess on the
other is totally unconvincing. The
latter were closely associated with
what most historians would agree
was "the greatest crime in
history" (Camus). Nuremberg was
an appropriate response to that.
Few would deny that Vietnam is a
hideous and quite possibly futile
war, but anyone who cannot
distinguish -between the stripe of
man that Lodge is (incidentally, 1
served on a panel with him in
World War 11, in France) and the
absolutely evil character of the
Nazis has a very poor hold on
reality and/or a weak memory.
Lodge, like the rest of us

involved in that bigger war, was
part of a military program that
included the hideous and quite
possibly futile bombing of
Dresden. The parallel obviously is.
between Lodge and Churchill or
Eisenhower or countless others
responsible for that program.
Would we stop Churchill or
Eisenhower from speaking here?
Or Truman because of Hiroshima?
I doubt that Vietnam is uglier
than the latter event.
Wars tend to be ugly. But, in
addition to the Pentagon papers, I
would recommend that Mrs.
Marshall and Professor Giraud
consult those pages in The Rebel
where Camus demonstrates how
the revolt against primordial evil
has led to the totalitarianism of
right and left in our century.
Then, sins of the intellect are
combined wilh ancient blood-guilt
to produce what Isaac Ilosenfeld
called an Age of Enormity. The
purists inevitably become
Terrorists—is their cause of
eradicating evil not absolutely
just, does it not call for the most
radical measures, guillotine,
gas-oven?—as crime is piled on
crime and the finest efforts of
struggling man, his universities, his
art, are pulled to the ground.
Nothing can stop this
vertiginous and well-intentioned
madness except perhaps the grace
of wisdom, which is merely an

enlightened form of common
sense. "Whom the gods would
destroy they first make mad."
Then everything is blurred in an
outburst of righteousness,
fanaticism. But we do not have
the choice of not making choices,
anguishing discriminations. For
this, in the end, we must rely on
our total judgment, our flair if
you will, the kind that "smells" a
difference between a Lodge and a
Hess. This can easily be called
stench against stench. But who
can afford delicate nostrils in an
Age of Enormity?

Tenure Policy Revisited
Editor, THE DAILY:
The article of Professor Robert
Finn on Tenure Policy in the
Letters Section of the Daily for
October 1 2 is the best argument I
have seen for the retention of a
faculty member who is a
competent scholar and teacher
but has eccentricities which
interfere with the operation of the
university. There is a
counter-argument; it goes back to
principles which have worked well
to create some of our great
organizations, both academic and
industrial. These principles I set
down in the form of two little
homilies at the end of the next
paragraph.
Professor Finn writes that
"Stanford's Advisory Board is
being asked to decide whether
professors are employees with
obligation to provide services as
required by their supervisors or
whether they are scholars who are
to be protected in their duty to
seek truth as they find it." He
says that we pay homage to the
latter view but in practice respect
the former, and he regrets the
practice. The question is: Which
system works? My feeling is
expressed by the old saying:
"Better an army of sheep led by a
lion than an army of lions led by a
sheep." It is implemented by a
still older saying: "Whose bread I
eats, his song I sings."
I think a great university
requires a strong president free to

discharge a faculty member whose
conduct as he views it is not in the
best interests of the university.
This is not as fascist a point of
view as some radicals would
maintain, for no one is compelled
to work for the university. One of
course has to assume that the
president is a "good" man, or that
if he proves not to be, the Board
of Trustees will remove him. But
once a teacher has joined the
team, it's up to him to work for it
or to be willing to accept dismissal
should the president find him
wanting.
The real issue in the current
trial is presidential authority. Who
runs the show? Some colorful
lions in the faculty or the
president? I'm in favor of the
Trustees' explicitly giving to a
carefully chosen president a free
hand, and of the president's then
having the strength and character
and, if you will, the magnificence
to exercise it.

SJC Selection Committee
Editor, THE DAILY:
John J. Schwartz in his article
in Wednesday's Daily claims that
the Student Selection Committee
for the SJC is prevented from
appointing the student members
of this year's SJC because of the
refusal of the ASSU Senate to
appoint the student members of
the Student Selection Committee.
Nothing in the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1 968 specifies
the term of office of the three
students appointed by the ASSU
Senate. Presumably, the students
last appointed to the Student
Selection Committee are still
members of that committee.
The ASSU Senate last
appointed students to the Student
Selection Committee in spring
1970. The students appointed
(and their current positions in
campus government) are Ann
Kimball (ASSU Council of
Presidents), Mike Dawson (ASSU
Senate Chairman), and Yale
Braunstein (Student Conduct
Legislative Council).

Tenure Policy Revisited
Editor, THE DAILY:
The article of Professor Robert
Finn on Tenure Policy in the
Letters Section of the Daily for
October 1 2 is the best argument I
have seen for the retention of a
faculty member who is a
competent scholar and teacher
but has eccentricities which
interfere with the operation of the
university. There is a
counter-argument; it goes back to
principles which have worked well
to create some of our great
organizations, both academic and
industrial. These principles I set
down in the form of two little
homilies at the end of the next
paragraph.
Professor Finn writes that
"Stanford's Advisory Board is
being asked to decide whether
professors are employees with
obligation to provide services as
required by their supervisors or
whether they are scholars who are
to be protected in their duty to
seek truth as they find it." He
says that we pay homage to the
latter view but in practice respect
the former, and he regrets the
practice. The question is: Which
system works? My feeling is
expressed by the old saying:
"Better an army of sheep led by a
lion than an army of lions led by a
sheep." It is implemented by a
still older saying: "Whose bread I
eats, his song I sings."
I think a great university
requires a strong president free to

discharge a faculty member whose
conduct as he views it is not in the
best interests of the university.
This is not as fascist a point of
view as some radicals would
maintain, for no one is compelled
to work for the university. One of
course has to assume that the
president is a "good" man, or that
if he proves not to be, the Board
of Trustees will remove him. But
once a teacher has joined the
team, it's up to him to work for it
or to be willing to accept dismissal
should the president find him
wanting.
The real issue in the current
trial is presidential authority. Who
runs the show? Some colorful
lions in the faculty or the
president? I'm in favor of the
Trustees' explicitly giving to a
carefully chosen president a free
hand, and of the president's then
having the strength and character
and, if you will, the magnificence
to exercise it.

SJC Selection Committee
Editor, THE DAILY:
John J. Schwartz in his article
in Wednesday's Daily claims that
the Student Selection Committee
for the SJC is prevented from
appointing the student members
of this year's SJC because of the
refusal of the ASSU Senate to
appoint the student members of
the Student Selection Committee.
Nothing in the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1 968 specifies
the term of office of the three
students appointed by the ASSU
Senate. Presumably, the students
last appointed to the Student
Selection Committee are still
members of that committee.
The ASSU Senate last
appointed students to the Student
Selection Committee in spring
1970. The students appointed
(and their current positions in
campus government) are Ann
Kimball (ASSU Council of
Presidents), Mike Dawson (ASSU
Senate Chairman), and Yale
Braunstein (Student Conduct
Legislative Council).

Revisionism
Editor, THE DAILY:
In Marxist-Leninist Linda
Crouse's column (18 October
1971), she criticizes the
philosophy of science which I
employed to attack B. F.
Skinner's behaviorism.
It is clear from her column,
and from personal conversations
she has had with me on this topic,
that Crouse believes that her
position is in accord with
dialectical materialism.
In fact, this is not true. In her
column, Crouse says, "We can
only make probabilistic
statements about nature at any
level," and in conversation with
me, she endorsed the Heisenberg
Uncertainty Principle. Crouse's
indeterminist position on physical
nature is the position of
positivism.
While I am neither a positivist
nor a dialectical materialist, the
dialectical materialist position is
much closer to being correct than
the positivist position which
Crouse adopts.
In his book Dialectical
Materialism, Gustav Wetter says,
"On the subject of indeterminism,
the Soviet philosophers... are
strenuous defenders of a
philosophical determinism, in face
of the indeterminism of quantum
physics .... So far as the problem

of quantum statistics is
concerned, Soviet philosophy is
averse to the idea that the merely
statistical character of quantum
laws arises, as the positivists
maintain, from the absence of
lawful connections among the
individual microphenomena."
Dialectical materialists have, as I
do, a deterministic interpretation
of quantum physics.
In socialist countries, Crouse's
position is condemned as
"physical idealism."

Finn on Tenure Policy in the
Letters Section of the Daily for
October 1 2 is the best argument I
have seen for the retention of a
faculty member who is a
competent scholar and teacher
but has eccentricities which
interfere with the operation of the
university. There is a
counter-argument; it goes back to
principles which have worked well
to create some of our great
organizations, both academic and
industrial. These principles I set
down in the form of two little
homilies at the end of the next
paragraph.
Professor Finn writes that
"Stanford's Advisory Board is
being asked to decide whether
professors are employees with
obligation to provide services as
required by their supervisors or
whether they are scholars who are
to be protected in their duty to
seek truth as they find it." He
says that we pay homage to the
latter view but in practice respect
the former, and he regrets the
practice. The question is: Which
system works? My feeling is
expressed by the old saying:
"Better an army of sheep led by a
lion than an army of lions led by a
sheep." It is implemented by a
still older saying: "Whose bread I
eats, his song I sings."
I think a great university
requires a strong president free to

discharge a faculty member whose
conduct as he views it is not in the
best interests of the university.
This is not as fascist a point of
view as some radicals would
maintain, for no one is compelled
to work for the university. One of
course has to assume that the
president is a "good" man, or that
if he proves not to be, the Board
of Trustees will remove him. But
once a teacher has joined the
team, it's up to him to work for it
or to be willing to accept dismissal
should the president find him
wanting.
The real issue in the current
trial is presidential authority. Who
runs the show? Some colorful
lions in the faculty or the
president? I'm in favor of the
Trustees' explicitly giving to a
carefully chosen president a free
hand, and of the president's then
having the strength and character
and, if you will, the magnificence
to exercise it.

SJC Selection Committee
Editor, THE DAILY:
John J. Schwartz in his article
in Wednesday's Daily claims that
the Student Selection Committee
for the SJC is prevented from
appointing the student members
of this year's SJC because of the
refusal of the ASSU Senate to
appoint the student members of
the Student Selection Committee.
Nothing in the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1 968 specifies
the term of office of the three
students appointed by the ASSU
Senate. Presumably, the students
last appointed to the Student
Selection Committee are still
members of that committee.
The ASSU Senate last
appointed students to the Student
Selection Committee in spring
1970. The students appointed
(and their current positions in
campus government) are Ann
Kimball (ASSU Council of
Presidents), Mike Dawson (ASSU
Senate Chairman), and Yale
Braunstein (Student Conduct
Legislative Council).

Revisionism
Editor, THE DAILY:
In Marxist-Leninist Linda
Crouse's column (18 October
1971), she criticizes the
philosophy of science which I
employed to attack B. F.
Skinner's behaviorism.
It is clear from her column,
and from personal conversations
she has had with me on this topic,
that Crouse believes that her
position is in accord with
dialectical materialism.
In fact, this is not true. In her
column, Crouse says, "We can
only make probabilistic
statements about nature at any
level," and in conversation with
me, she endorsed the Heisenberg
Uncertainty Principle. Crouse's
indeterminist position on physical
nature is the position of
positivism.
While I am neither a positivist
nor a dialectical materialist, the
dialectical materialist position is
much closer to being correct than
the positivist position which
Crouse adopts.
In his book Dialectical
Materialism, Gustav Wetter says,
"On the subject of indeterminism,
the Soviet philosophers... are
strenuous defenders of a
philosophical determinism, in face
of the indeterminism of quantum
physics .... So far as the problem

of quantum statistics is
concerned, Soviet philosophy is
averse to the idea that the merely
statistical character of quantum
laws arises, as the positivists
maintain, from the absence of
lawful connections among the
individual microphenomena."
Dialectical materialists have, as I
do, a deterministic interpretation
of quantum physics.
In socialist countries, Crouse's
position is condemned as
"physical idealism."

Lodge v.s. Soeer & Hess
Editor, THE DAILY:
The parallel Rachelle Marshall
draws between Lodge on the one
hand and Speer and Hess on the
other is totally unconvincing. The
latter were closely associated with
what most historians would agree
was "the greatest crime in
history" (Camus). Nuremberg was
an appropriate response to that.
Few would deny that Vietnam is a
hideous and quite possibly futile
war, but anyone who cannot
distinguish -between the stripe of
man that Lodge is (incidentally, 1
served on a panel with him in
World War 11, in France) and the
absolutely evil character of the
Nazis has a very poor hold on
reality and/or a weak memory.
Lodge, like the rest of us

involved in that bigger war, was
part of a military program that
included the hideous and quite
possibly futile bombing of
Dresden. The parallel obviously is.
between Lodge and Churchill or
Eisenhower or countless others
responsible for that program.
Would we stop Churchill or
Eisenhower from speaking here?
Or Truman because of Hiroshima?
I doubt that Vietnam is uglier
than the latter event.
Wars tend to be ugly. But, in
addition to the Pentagon papers, I
would recommend that Mrs.
Marshall and Professor Giraud
consult those pages in The Rebel
where Camus demonstrates how
the revolt against primordial evil
has led to the totalitarianism of
right and left in our century.
Then, sins of the intellect are
combined wilh ancient blood-guilt
to produce what Isaac Ilosenfeld
called an Age of Enormity. The
purists inevitably become
Terrorists—is their cause of
eradicating evil not absolutely
just, does it not call for the most
radical measures, guillotine,
gas-oven?—as crime is piled on
crime and the finest efforts of
struggling man, his universities, his
art, are pulled to the ground.
Nothing can stop this
vertiginous and well-intentioned
madness except perhaps the grace
of wisdom, which is merely an

enlightened form of common
sense. "Whom the gods would
destroy they first make mad."
Then everything is blurred in an
outburst of righteousness,
fanaticism. But we do not have
the choice of not making choices,
anguishing discriminations. For
this, in the end, we must rely on
our total judgment, our flair if
you will, the kind that "smells" a
difference between a Lodge and a
Hess. This can easily be called
stench against stench. But who
can afford delicate nostrils in an
Age of Enormity?

SJC Selection Committee
Editor, THE DAILY:
John J. Schwartz in his article
in Wednesday's Daily claims that
the Student Selection Committee
for the SJC is prevented from
appointing the student members
of this year's SJC because of the
refusal of the ASSU Senate to
appoint the student members of
the Student Selection Committee.
Nothing in the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1 968 specifies
the term of office of the three
students appointed by the ASSU
Senate. Presumably, the students
last appointed to the Student
Selection Committee are still
members of that committee.
The ASSU Senate last
appointed students to the Student
Selection Committee in spring
1970. The students appointed
(and their current positions in
campus government) are Ann
Kimball (ASSU Council of
Presidents), Mike Dawson (ASSU
Senate Chairman), and Yale
Braunstein (Student Conduct
Legislative Council).

Revisionism
Editor, THE DAILY:
In Marxist-Leninist Linda
Crouse's column (18 October
1971), she criticizes the
philosophy of science which I
employed to attack B. F.
Skinner's behaviorism.
It is clear from her column,
and from personal conversations
she has had with me on this topic,
that Crouse believes that her
position is in accord with
dialectical materialism.
In fact, this is not true. In her
column, Crouse says, "We can
only make probabilistic
statements about nature at any
level," and in conversation with
me, she endorsed the Heisenberg
Uncertainty Principle. Crouse's
indeterminist position on physical
nature is the position of
positivism.
While I am neither a positivist
nor a dialectical materialist, the
dialectical materialist position is
much closer to being correct than
the positivist position which
Crouse adopts.
In his book Dialectical
Materialism, Gustav Wetter says,
"On the subject of indeterminism,
the Soviet philosophers... are
strenuous defenders of a
philosophical determinism, in face
of the indeterminism of quantum
physics .... So far as the problem

of quantum statistics is
concerned, Soviet philosophy is
averse to the idea that the merely
statistical character of quantum
laws arises, as the positivists
maintain, from the absence of
lawful connections among the
individual microphenomena."
Dialectical materialists have, as I
do, a deterministic interpretation
of quantum physics.
In socialist countries, Crouse's
position is condemned as
"physical idealism."
Bill Evers
Lodge v.s. Soeer & Hess
Editor, THE DAILY:
The parallel Rachelle Marshall
draws between Lodge on the one
hand and Speer and Hess on the
other is totally unconvincing. The
latter were closely associated with
what most historians would agree
was "the greatest crime in
history" (Camus). Nuremberg was
an appropriate response to that.
Few would deny that Vietnam is a
hideous and quite possibly futile
war, but anyone who cannot
distinguish -between the stripe of
man that Lodge is (incidentally, 1
served on a panel with him in
World War 11, in France) and the
absolutely evil character of the
Nazis has a very poor hold on
reality and/or a weak memory.
Lodge, like the rest of us

involved in that bigger war, was
part of a military program that
included the hideous and quite
possibly futile bombing of
Dresden. The parallel obviously is.
between Lodge and Churchill or
Eisenhower or countless others
responsible for that program.
Would we stop Churchill or
Eisenhower from speaking here?
Or Truman because of Hiroshima?
I doubt that Vietnam is uglier
than the latter event.
Wars tend to be ugly. But, in
addition to the Pentagon papers, I
would recommend that Mrs.
Marshall and Professor Giraud
consult those pages in The Rebel
where Camus demonstrates how
the revolt against primordial evil
has led to the totalitarianism of
right and left in our century.
Then, sins of the intellect are
combined wilh ancient blood-guilt
to produce what Isaac Ilosenfeld
called an Age of Enormity. The
purists inevitably become
Terrorists—is their cause of
eradicating evil not absolutely
just, does it not call for the most
radical measures, guillotine,
gas-oven?—as crime is piled on
crime and the finest efforts of
struggling man, his universities, his
art, are pulled to the ground.
Nothing can stop this
vertiginous and well-intentioned
madness except perhaps the grace
of wisdom, which is merely an

enlightened form of common
sense. "Whom the gods would
destroy they first make mad."
Then everything is blurred in an
outburst of righteousness,
fanaticism. But we do not have
the choice of not making choices,
anguishing discriminations. For
this, in the end, we must rely on
our total judgment, our flair if
you will, the kind that "smells" a
difference between a Lodge and a
Hess. This can easily be called
stench against stench. But who
can afford delicate nostrils in an
Age of Enormity?

Professor of French
Tenure Policy Revisited
Editor, THE DAILY:
The article of Professor Robert
Finn on Tenure Policy in the
Letters Section of the Daily for
October 1 2 is the best argument I
have seen for the retention of a
faculty member who is a
competent scholar and teacher
but has eccentricities which
interfere with the operation of the
university. There is a
counter-argument; it goes back to
principles which have worked well
to create some of our great
organizations, both academic and
industrial. These principles I set
down in the form of two little
homilies at the end of the next
paragraph.
Professor Finn writes that
"Stanford's Advisory Board is
being asked to decide whether
professors are employees with
obligation to provide services as
required by their supervisors or
whether they are scholars who are
to be protected in their duty to
seek truth as they find it." He
says that we pay homage to the
latter view but in practice respect
the former, and he regrets the
practice. The question is: Which
system works? My feeling is
expressed by the old saying:
"Better an army of sheep led by a
lion than an army of lions led by a
sheep." It is implemented by a
still older saying: "Whose bread I
eats, his song I sings."
I think a great university
requires a strong president free to

discharge a faculty member whose
conduct as he views it is not in the
best interests of the university.
This is not as fascist a point of
view as some radicals would
maintain, for no one is compelled
to work for the university. One of
course has to assume that the
president is a "good" man, or that
if he proves not to be, the Board
of Trustees will remove him. But
once a teacher has joined the
team, it's up to him to work for it
or to be willing to accept dismissal
should the president find him
wanting.
The real issue in the current
trial is presidential authority. Who
runs the show? Some colorful
lions in the faculty or the
president? I'm in favor of the
Trustees' explicitly giving to a
carefully chosen president a free
hand, and of the president's then
having the strength and character
and, if you will, the magnificence
to exercise it.
