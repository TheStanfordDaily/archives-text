# Dorm Party Whoopee
## 
### 
Corridor party—B:3o—second
floor. Whoopee!
Where's the booze? All right,
two wastebaskets full. Hey,
what do we need all that Coke
for? You can't soften up a girl
with Coke.

Unless you «-
soak her in it. L
Too messy. |
Hey, here's the
beer. All right.
You should have
seen how much
beer we drank
last weekend.
We were really
polluted. Oh

boy, were we ever. ...
All right. Ernest and Julio
come through again.
Where are the pretzels?
Where are the girls? Knock
on every door. Tell them the
Mad Rapist is ready and
waiting. Tell them there's
refreshments.
Say who is this Mad Rapist
fellow?
I think he lives on the third
floor, near the drinking
fountain.
Yeah, but how does he do
it?
Ask your mother.
No, but I mean how does
he do it?
Just does it, I guess.
A girl peers out her door.
Can't study with all this noise.
Might sit down next to that
tall, skinny boy from the third
floor. Oh, I'll just have a
Coke. Thank you.
She's not so bad. Start a
conversation, something original
so she'll remember you. What's
your name? Where are you
from? Hey do you
know ... you live on this floor,
huh? Yeah, I guess you do.
Well, how do you like being a
girl? No, I guess you don't
have much choice. Oh yeah,
she'll remember me, the man
from gay lib.
Joe Stanford with the hair
falling into his face inches next
to Carol with the Coke who is
busy not noticing. He's not
bad. What's his name anyhow?
You're Carol, right?
Oh yes, and you're. . .

Joe.
Yeah, Joe.
Corridor party. Whoopee.
Pass the wine over here, will
you. Any more beer? You
should have seen us last
weekend, we were really

polluted. Oh boy, oh boy.
Anybody got any dope? Have
a refill. Don't mind if I do.
Don't mind. Ernest and Julio,
a man's best friends.
Talk's getting down to the
essentials. High School P.E.
Teachers. I had this really
weird guy for Volleyball.
Waterfights I Have Known—We
ought to have a good
watertight in this dorm, bring
people together. How I Got
Polluted Last Weekend. Boy
you should have seen us.
Joe and Carol are practically
touching now. Vicarious thrill
time. Oh that Joe is really a
mover.
Yeah, but let me tell you
about Carol last weekend.
I know. You were polluted.
Somebody brings out the
popcorn. Everyone reaches in,
burns their hands on the side
of the bowl, spills half of it
on the rug.
Yeah, right outside my
room. Thanks, jerks.
Hey I hear there's a party
at Soto.
Naw, we been there.
I hear there's a party
somewhere in Flo Mo.
Naw, we were there too.
This is where it's at.
Whoopee.
Shriek, splash, the first
water balloon of the season.
And they're in fine form
tonight, as it's a direct hit to
Sally the Squealer.
Oh, you got me all wet.
You are all wet, kid.
Revenge for the slighted
honor of one of our damsels.
Get him. Need ammunition,
nothing like a wastebasket of
melted ice water for a real
thrill.
Watch out. It's a
counterattack from the third
floor and they've got the force
of gravity on their side. Sneak
up the stairs. Sneak, sneak,
sneak, splash. These men are
no fools. How're we going to
get them?
Fire hose. Get out the fire
hose.
Fire hose, sure. Oh boy,
that'll fix 'em. Hey you know
this thing leaks.
Sure does.
Stick an ice cube down her

V^LCOMfig

back. Don't worry, little lady,
I'll get it out for you. No
trouble at all.
Don't use the beer. That's a
waste. So they do have the
water fountain barricaded. Use
the sinks in the bathroom.

It's a girls'
bathroom.
The bath
rooms belong to
the people.
Anybody in
here? Oh, I'm
sorry. No, I'm
really sorry. I'm
really sorry
about that.

What kind of girl would take a
shower when there's a corridor
party going on?
A naked girl.
Yeah, I guess so.
Yeah, and we're out of
beer.
Hey whatever happened to
Carol and Joe?
Whoopee, spash.
Ask your mother.


7 think we've got him right where he wants us!'

on every door. Tell them the
Mad Rapist is ready and
waiting. Tell them there's
refreshments.
Say who is this Mad Rapist
fellow?
I think he lives on the third
floor, near the drinking
fountain.
Yeah, but how does he do
it?
Ask your mother.
No, but I mean how does
he do it?
Just does it, I guess.
A girl peers out her door.
Can't study with all this noise.
Might sit down next to that
tall, skinny boy from the third
floor. Oh, I'll just have a
Coke. Thank you.
She's not so bad. Start a
conversation, something original
so she'll remember you. What's
your name? Where are you
from? Hey do you
know ... you live on this floor,
huh? Yeah, I guess you do.
Well, how do you like being a
girl? No, I guess you don't
have much choice. Oh yeah,
she'll remember me, the man
from gay lib.
Joe Stanford with the hair
falling into his face inches next
to Carol with the Coke who is
busy not noticing. He's not
bad. What's his name anyhow?
You're Carol, right?
Oh yes, and you're. . .

Joe.
Yeah, Joe.
Corridor party. Whoopee.
Pass the wine over here, will
you. Any more beer? You
should have seen us last
weekend, we were really

polluted. Oh boy, oh boy.
Anybody got any dope? Have
a refill. Don't mind if I do.
Don't mind. Ernest and Julio,
a man's best friends.
Talk's getting down to the
essentials. High School P.E.
Teachers. I had this really
weird guy for Volleyball.
Waterfights I Have Known—We
ought to have a good
watertight in this dorm, bring
people together. How I Got
Polluted Last Weekend. Boy
you should have seen us.
Joe and Carol are practically
touching now. Vicarious thrill
time. Oh that Joe is really a
mover.
Yeah, but let me tell you
about Carol last weekend.
I know. You were polluted.
Somebody brings out the
popcorn. Everyone reaches in,
burns their hands on the side
of the bowl, spills half of it
on the rug.
Yeah, right outside my
room. Thanks, jerks.
Hey I hear there's a party
at Soto.
Naw, we been there.
I hear there's a party
somewhere in Flo Mo.
Naw, we were there too.
This is where it's at.
Whoopee.
Shriek, splash, the first
water balloon of the season.
And they're in fine form
tonight, as it's a direct hit to
Sally the Squealer.
Oh, you got me all wet.
You are all wet, kid.
Revenge for the slighted
honor of one of our damsels.
Get him. Need ammunition,
nothing like a wastebasket of
melted ice water for a real
thrill.
Watch out. It's a
counterattack from the third
floor and they've got the force
of gravity on their side. Sneak
up the stairs. Sneak, sneak,
sneak, splash. These men are
no fools. How're we going to
get them?
Fire hose. Get out the fire
hose.
Fire hose, sure. Oh boy,
that'll fix 'em. Hey you know
this thing leaks.
Sure does.
Stick an ice cube down her

V^LCOMfig

back. Don't worry, little lady,
I'll get it out for you. No
trouble at all.
Don't use the beer. That's a
waste. So they do have the
water fountain barricaded. Use
the sinks in the bathroom.

It's a girls'
bathroom.
The bath
rooms belong to
the people.
Anybody in
here? Oh, I'm
sorry. No, I'm
really sorry. I'm
really sorry
about that.

What kind of girl would take a
shower when there's a corridor
party going on?
A naked girl.
Yeah, I guess so.
Yeah, and we're out of
beer.
Hey whatever happened to
Carol and Joe?
Whoopee, spash.
Ask your mother.


7 think we've got him right where he wants us!'
Corridor party—B:3o—second
floor. Whoopee!
Where's the booze? All right,
two wastebaskets full. Hey,
what do we need all that Coke
for? You can't soften up a girl
with Coke.

Unless you «-
soak her in it. L
Too messy. |
Hey, here's the
beer. All right.

conversation, something original
so she'll remember you. What's
your name? Where are you
from? Hey do you
know ... you live on this floor,
huh? Yeah, I guess you do.
Well, how do you like being a
girl? No, I guess you don't
have much choice. Oh yeah,
she'll remember me, the man
from gay lib.
Joe Stanford with the hair
falling into his face inches next
to Carol with the Coke who is
busy not noticing. He's not
bad. What's his name anyhow?
You're Carol, right?
Oh yes, and you're. . .

Joe.
Yeah, Joe.
Corridor party. Whoopee.
Pass the wine over here, will
you. Any more beer? You
should have seen us last
weekend, we were really

polluted. Oh boy, oh boy.
Anybody got any dope? Have
a refill. Don't mind if I do.
Don't mind. Ernest and Julio,
a man's best friends.
Talk's getting down to the
essentials. High School P.E.
Teachers. I had this really
weird guy for Volleyball.
Waterfights I Have Known—We
ought to have a good
watertight in this dorm, bring
people together. How I Got
Polluted Last Weekend. Boy
you should have seen us.
Joe and Carol are practically
touching now. Vicarious thrill
time. Oh that Joe is really a
mover.
Yeah, but let me tell you
about Carol last weekend.
I know. You were polluted.
Somebody brings out the
popcorn. Everyone reaches in,
burns their hands on the side
of the bowl, spills half of it
on the rug.
Yeah, right outside my
room. Thanks, jerks.
Hey I hear there's a party
at Soto.
Naw, we been there.
I hear there's a party
somewhere in Flo Mo.
Naw, we were there too.
This is where it's at.
Whoopee.
Shriek, splash, the first
water balloon of the season.
And they're in fine form
tonight, as it's a direct hit to
Sally the Squealer.
Oh, you got me all wet.
You are all wet, kid.
Revenge for the slighted
honor of one of our damsels.
Get him. Need ammunition,
nothing like a wastebasket of
melted ice water for a real
thrill.
Watch out. It's a
counterattack from the third
floor and they've got the force
of gravity on their side. Sneak
up the stairs. Sneak, sneak,
sneak, splash. These men are
no fools. How're we going to
get them?
Fire hose. Get out the fire
hose.
Fire hose, sure. Oh boy,
that'll fix 'em. Hey you know
this thing leaks.
Sure does.
Stick an ice cube down her

V^LCOMfig

back. Don't worry, little lady,
I'll get it out for you. No
trouble at all.
Don't use the beer. That's a
waste. So they do have the
water fountain barricaded. Use
the sinks in the bathroom.

It's a girls'
bathroom.
The bath
rooms belong to
the people.
Anybody in
here? Oh, I'm
sorry. No, I'm
really sorry. I'm
really sorry
about that.

What kind of girl would take a
shower when there's a corridor
party going on?
A naked girl.
Yeah, I guess so.
Yeah, and we're out of
beer.
Hey whatever happened to
Carol and Joe?
Whoopee, spash.
Ask your mother.


7 think we've got him right where he wants us!'
Corridor party—B:3o—second
floor. Whoopee!
Where's the booze? All right,
two wastebaskets full. Hey,
what do we need all that Coke
for? You can't soften up a girl
with Coke.

Unless you «-
soak her in it. L
Too messy. |
Hey, here's the
beer. All right.
You should have
seen how much
beer we drank
last weekend.
We were really
polluted. Oh

boy, were we ever. ...
All right. Ernest and Julio
come through again.
Where are the pretzels?
Where are the girls? Knock
on every door. Tell them the
Mad Rapist is ready and
waiting. Tell them there's
refreshments.
Say who is this Mad Rapist
fellow?
I think he lives on the third
floor, near the drinking
fountain.
Yeah, but how does he do
it?
Ask your mother.
No, but I mean how does
he do it?
Just does it, I guess.
A girl peers out her door.
Can't study with all this noise.
Might sit down next to that
tall, skinny boy from the third
floor. Oh, I'll just have a
Coke. Thank you.
