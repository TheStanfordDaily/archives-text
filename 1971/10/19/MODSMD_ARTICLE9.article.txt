# prison reality
## A 						Modest Proposal 
### 
I couldn't help but pause
and reflect upon my sojourn in
the San Francisco city jail a
few weeks back when learning
of Professor Zimbardo's studies
of prison behavior graciously
sponsored by the Department
of Defense. Somehow I have
this vision stuck in my mind.
Two Black comrades standing
over me, one with a tin cup
of cold coffee in his hand,
while a third drones on from a
tattered newspaper in the
background. He mispronounces
my name twice reading the
front page story out of the
Sunday Examiner.
I remember forcing a smile
through the white hot pain,
my head swathed in bandages
as I tried to sit up. They said
I looked like a bloody version
of the Son of Mummy. The
coffee tasted like turpentine. I
couldn't see anything, my gold
wireframes had been shattered.
But this is all beside the
point. What I had in mind was
a modest little proposal for
Professor Zimbardo himself. I
suggest that no study of the
effects of prolonged
imprisonment by the Professor
can be valid without the
scholar taking a leading part
himself. I suggest about 90
days.
There are many of use in
the Stanford Community with
a rich, albeit not lengthy,
knowledge of this area. (The
one's serving longer sentences
haven't made it back yet.)
Those of us who have done
time as revolutionaries, radical
or just plain victims of the
system would welcome this
opportunity to share our
collective imagination in a free
interchange of ideas with
Professor Zimbardo on an
intimate and day to day basis.

We'd be happy to serve as
dope pushing medics,
psychopathic guards, snitches,
aggressive homosexuals and
whatnot. Of course we can't
offer the real thing, actual
violence being against the
campus disruption policy.
However we'll do our best to
provide semi regular meals
which are absolutely inedible,
cold showers twice a week and
10 minute visiting privileges on
Sunday if he's good. We
promise to the Professor a
tightly controlled experiment.

(Jan Sutter has been involved
since the days when the
Oakland Police beat back the
first peace marches at the
Berkeley borderline.
He was recently
charged with assaulting a half
dozen members of the San
Francisco Tac Squad
At that time he
received extensive treatment for
head injuries at the North
Point Emergency Hospital. If
convicted of the charges now
pending against him, he could
receive a life sentence.)

Those of us who have done
time as revolutionaries, radical
or just plain victims of the
system would welcome this
opportunity to share our
collective imagination in a free
interchange of ideas with
Professor Zimbardo on an
intimate and day to day basis.

We'd be happy to serve as
dope pushing medics,
psychopathic guards, snitches,
aggressive homosexuals and
whatnot. Of course we can't
offer the real thing, actual
violence being against the
campus disruption policy.
However we'll do our best to
provide semi regular meals
which are absolutely inedible,
cold showers twice a week and
10 minute visiting privileges on
Sunday if he's good. We
promise to the Professor a
tightly controlled experiment.

(Jan Sutter has been involved
since the days when the
Oakland Police beat back the
first peace marches at the
Berkeley borderline.
He was recently
charged with assaulting a half
dozen members of the San
Francisco Tac Squad
At that time he
received extensive treatment for
head injuries at the North
Point Emergency Hospital. If
convicted of the charges now
pending against him, he could
receive a life sentence.)
I couldn't help but pause
and reflect upon my sojourn in
the San Francisco city jail a
few weeks back when learning
of Professor Zimbardo's studies
of prison behavior graciously
sponsored by the Department
of Defense. Somehow I have
this vision stuck in my mind.
Two Black comrades standing
over me, one with a tin cup
of cold coffee in his hand,
while a third drones on from a
tattered newspaper in the
background. He mispronounces
my name twice reading the
front page story out of the
Sunday Examiner.
I remember forcing a smile
through the white hot pain,
my head swathed in bandages
as I tried to sit up. They said
I looked like a bloody version
of the Son of Mummy. The
coffee tasted like turpentine. I
couldn't see anything, my gold
wireframes had been shattered.
But this is all beside the
point. What I had in mind was
a modest little proposal for
Professor Zimbardo himself. I
suggest that no study of the
effects of prolonged
imprisonment by the Professor
can be valid without the
scholar taking a leading part
himself. I suggest about 90
days.
There are many of use in
the Stanford Community with
a rich, albeit not lengthy,
knowledge of this area. (The
one's serving longer sentences
haven't made it back yet.)
