# Franklin Denies Disrupting Lodge
## 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
H. Bruce Franklin told the Advisory
Board yesterday that "I know I didn't
stand up, I'm just about positive that I
didn't participate in any rhythmic
clapping, and 1 don't think I engaged in
any chanting" at Henry Cabot Lodge's
Dinkelspiel speech on January 11.
The suspended English professor's
statement came as he continued to
testify in his own defense about
disruption of the Lodge speech.
Earlier prosecution testimony had
ranged from statements that Franklin
had participated in chanting and
rhythmic clapping with increasing
intensity to allegations that he had
"tried to shout the speaker down."
The Maoist said he could remember
"consciously refraining from rhythmic
clapping" after Hoover Institute fellow
Berkeley Tompkins had singled him out
from the podium as a disruptor.
'Set Up'
"I realized at that moment it was a
set up and 1 felt a revolutionary
obligation to shut up," the Marxist
scholar said.
Franklin later explained that he
made the decision because "it would
have been very foolish to play into the
hands of those who have made it clear

over the years that they were trying to
get rid of me."
He admitted that he had a hard time
refraining from clapping and said it was
difficult "sitting there like a goddamn
professor" but added that he knew
"every local fascist and reactionary
from as far away as Walnut Creek" was
keeping an eye on him.
In his direct testimony Franklin
stipulated that he had called out twice
at the event.
Napalm And Politeness
The suspended professor said he
yelled "napalm" while Hoover Institute
Director W. Glenn Campbell was
speaking on the United Nations and
had also called out "What about
politeness at My Lai" while Tompkins
was attempting to quiet the audience.
He then went into what he himself
termed as "excruciating detail" about
why he made the remarks, giving a
history of napalm and his own personal
involvement against it.
Franklin told of how he organized a
referendum to ban a napalm
production plant in Redwood City in
the mid-60's and of attempts to
persuade companies to quit making the
substance.
He also said that the United States,
acting for United Nations forces in

Korea, had shipped 17 million pounds
of it there and devastated the North.
New Aspect
The Maoist professor said his yelling
of the word signified an aspect of the
United Nations that would not have
ordinarily been brought out at the
conference.
Concerning his remark about
"politeness at My Lai," Franklin went
into a long discussion which, except for
the setting, could have been one of his
lectures on Melville.
He said that if Melville had been
writing today he probably would have
called the Pequod (the ship in "Moby
Dick") the My Lai.
The suspended professor explained
that the Pequod was a group of Indians
in eastern Connecticut who were
annihilated by Whitemen they once
befriended.
"Lodge's ancestors," he added.
State of Mind
In lengthy testimony about his
"state of mind" during the Lodge
speech, Franklin also revealed that he
had a strong reaction to it, charging
that the Hoover Institute was "one of
the main anti-Communist propaganda
centers in the world."
He added that he had felt Hoover
was using the conference in an attempt

to "get Stanford under its control and
manipulate its name and resources for
its own political end in clear violation
of University policy on public events."
Franklin also said that he felt
"surprise" and a "certain amount of
disappointment" when Campbell
adjourned the meeting.
Franklin said that he was
disappointed that on the one hand
Lodge could not be heckled any more
but at the same time he was "pleased to
show our brothers and sisters in
Indochina that the anti-war movement
was not dead."
Cross Examination
Under cross-examination
Administration attorney Raymond
Fisher questioned Franklin about a
statement he made in January that he
had "heckled" and "made demands" of
Lodge and his two "lackeys."
Franklin said this reference was to
the two statements he had already
admitted making. He added he had not
heckled while Lodge was speaking.
The hearing resumes today at 1
p.m., with Franklin having the option
of testifying further. If he declines,
both parties to the case will meet with
the Advisory Board to plan procedure
for the last three charges against
Franklin on which he has yet to present
evidence.
