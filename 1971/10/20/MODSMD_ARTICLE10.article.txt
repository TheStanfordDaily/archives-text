# hospital sit-in fallout
## Devera Gets The Axe 
### 
; john dolly

While the most heavy handed
attempt yet at repression of the
anti-war movement at Stanford
goes on in the Physics Tank, the
Lyman administration quietly
goes about its business at the
Graduate School of Business with
the trail of Devera Satisky, one
of the five Stanford workers
arrested at the Stanford Hospital
last March. The treatment Devera
has received makes a mockery of
any phoney efforts at 'fairness'
used by Lyman to legitimize his
attempted firing of Franklin.
Late last June, just after the
students left for the summer, the
Stanford Five were fired from
their jobs with one day's notice.
Now after four months without
pay Devera's grievance committee
has given her the old Stanford
axe. If you've gone to the
grievance hearings you know that
not even lip service was payed to
the bourgeois freedoms of our
legal system. Devera was not
'innocent until proven guilty,' she
was fired first and then given the
'opportunity' to prove her
innocence (some opportunity
when you consider she still faces
nine misdemeanors in civil court).
But Devera's hearing taught us
much more than just the obvious
lack of justice for those who work
for Stanford. At the hearing Dean
John Wilson testified that he
pushed for the calling of the
police because the sit-in posed a
threat to patient care. But when
asked if the sit-in disrputed
patient care he could only
apologize that the threat was
there. And when asked of the
threat to patient care of 170 riot
police with mace and a battering
ram, he could only reply that that
was no threat at all. That's the
same rationale as the Green Beret
who told the TV cameras that
he'd ordered a Vietnamese village
- i

destroyed by bombs to 'save it'
from the communists. Or that of
Nelson Rockefeller who explained
the assault on Attica prison that
killed 41 convicts and guards as
necessary to save lives. One of the
guards was much more honest
when he said, 'I'm glad they
stormed the prison. If the convicts
here got those demands met, then
this kind of thing would be
happening all over the country.'
The hospital sit-in even had it's
Corrections Comissioner Oswald,
Hospital Director Thomas Gonda,
who testified that while he
neogotiated all day Friday with
the demonstrators in apparent
good faith, he already knew that
the police were to come in that
evening. When asked why that had

been kept a secret to the
demonstrators, he said that 'the
element of surprise' was
considered very important.
The heroic people of Vietnam
and Attica have shown us that the
response of the U.S. government
to self-determination is the
military solution. Devera and the
rest of the Med Center 33 have
shown us that the Stanford brand
of fascism is no different. They
have heightened the contradiction
here, raised the level of struggle in
revolutionary solidarity with their
brothers and sisters in Vietnam
and Attica.

attempted firing of Franklin.
Late last June, just after the
students left for the summer, the
Stanford Five were fired from
their jobs with one day's notice.
Now after four months without
pay Devera's grievance committee
has given her the old Stanford
axe. If you've gone to the
grievance hearings you know that
not even lip service was payed to
the bourgeois freedoms of our
legal system. Devera was not
'innocent until proven guilty,' she
was fired first and then given the
'opportunity' to prove her
innocence (some opportunity
when you consider she still faces
nine misdemeanors in civil court).
But Devera's hearing taught us
much more than just the obvious
lack of justice for those who work
for Stanford. At the hearing Dean
John Wilson testified that he
pushed for the calling of the
police because the sit-in posed a
threat to patient care. But when
asked if the sit-in disrputed
patient care he could only
apologize that the threat was
there. And when asked of the
threat to patient care of 170 riot
police with mace and a battering
ram, he could only reply that that
was no threat at all. That's the
same rationale as the Green Beret
who told the TV cameras that
he'd ordered a Vietnamese village
- i

destroyed by bombs to 'save it'
from the communists. Or that of
Nelson Rockefeller who explained
the assault on Attica prison that
killed 41 convicts and guards as
necessary to save lives. One of the
guards was much more honest
when he said, 'I'm glad they
stormed the prison. If the convicts
here got those demands met, then
this kind of thing would be
happening all over the country.'
The hospital sit-in even had it's
Corrections Comissioner Oswald,
Hospital Director Thomas Gonda,
who testified that while he
neogotiated all day Friday with
the demonstrators in apparent
good faith, he already knew that
the police were to come in that
evening. When asked why that had

been kept a secret to the
demonstrators, he said that 'the
element of surprise' was
considered very important.
The heroic people of Vietnam
and Attica have shown us that the
response of the U.S. government
to self-determination is the
military solution. Devera and the
rest of the Med Center 33 have
shown us that the Stanford brand
of fascism is no different. They
have heightened the contradiction
here, raised the level of struggle in
revolutionary solidarity with their
brothers and sisters in Vietnam
and Attica.

While the most heavy handed
attempt yet at repression of the
anti-war movement at Stanford
goes on in the Physics Tank, the
Lyman administration quietly
goes about its business at the
Graduate School of Business with
the trail of Devera Satisky, one
of the five Stanford workers
arrested at the Stanford Hospital
last March. The treatment Devera
has received makes a mockery of
any phoney efforts at 'fairness'
used by Lyman to legitimize his
attempted firing of Franklin.
