## Petition For Holman 
### 
submitted by linda crouse

Traditionally an incoming dean of a medical school is offered
resignations of department chairmen. Generally these pro forma
resignations are not accepted. ?
Dean Rich's abrupt and unusual acceptance of Hal Holman s
resignation, without even a face to face conversation, raises serious
questions as to whether political rather than wholly professional
considerations underlie this action. We are concerned that
administrative reprisal and extreme discourtesy have become the price
of an outspoken conscience.
(55 members of the Department of Medicine.)
Two things should be noticed about this statement.
(1) It took only 2+ hours to get 55 signatures from doctors,
nurses, housestaff, and people of all categories. We feel this expresses
adequately the feelings of the Dept. of Medicine staff. About ten
people approached felt that the statement was not true, and about 2 0
felt that it was probably true but that there wasn't sufficient proof.
(2) We have indicated the total number rather than individual
signatures. Many wouldn't sign if their names were published because
of the climate of political repression that hangs over the Medical
Center and the campus. While the university administration pays
lipservice to "academic freedom," the people who work here are often
afraid to speak out because of possible reprisal.
Ironically, if this sort of "resignation" had happened to somebody
else, Hal Holman would have been the very first to publicly state his
views.
(Medical students will discuss the Holman resignation at a noon
meeting today, M 127 Med Center.)
