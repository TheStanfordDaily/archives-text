# Bill Drake's List Determines Top 40
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY Commentary 
Although the days have more
than likely passed when a
well-placed payment to a radio
station program director could
make or break a group, one of the
most potent forces in the music
industry remains so-called "top 40
radio."
In the San Francisco area,
easily the prime practitioner of
the art today is KFRC, the
RKO-owned, Bill Drake
programmed "Big 610." And yet,
despite the clout of this
station and others like it, few if
any people ever pay attention to
the behind-the-scenes intrigues
that often decide what you hear
sandwiched in between the pimple
cream commercials.
Bill Drake-RKO stations are
easily recognizable by their
nearly-identical fonnats and
playlists. This should be apparent
to all those from Southern
California, where KHJ not only
has a similar format, but has in
fact operated a working
agreement with KFRC that allows
the two stations to switch d.j.'s.
In this manner, such former Bay
Area personalities as Bill Wade,
Mike Philips, and Dave Diamond
have all found their way to LA.
At the center of this is Bill
Drake himself, who probably has
more to say about the fate of an
individual 45 than anyone on the
west coast.
Drake is the man responsible
for drawing up the basic playlists
for the stations. So, although the
popularity surveys are supposedly
based on the record's sales and
number of requests, Drake has a
lot to do with whether the record
is heard in the first place.
Take, for example, a single
released late in the summer of
1970, "Satin Red and Black
Velvet Woman," by Dave Mason
on Blue Thumb Records. Mason,
ex-guitarist for Traffic, had
written that group's biggest singel,
"Feelin' Alright?" and had had a
moderate success with a single,
"Only You Know and I Know,"
off a very successful lp, "Alone
Together."
"Satin Red" was, in a word,
extremely good. In fact, on
several small local stations where
it was played, it rose to the top
ten. But it was never programmed
by Drake. Possible reason: the
release lacked much of the natural
hype associated with Mason's first
(on which Eric Clapton and
several of Delaney & Bonnie's
Friends played), and Blue Thumb,
at the time an independent (now
affiliated with Capitol), was too
small to manufacture any
pre-release demand for it.
Question: should a record not
be heard simply becausy of a

record company's inability to do a
promo job?
Occasionally, Drake has refused
to program some songs that have
achieved national prominence
anyway. The obvious example is
"Ohio" by Crosby, Stills, Nash &
Young, which blasted Nixon and
the Kent State tragedy in no
uncertain terms.
"Tin soldiers and Nixon
comin'/we're finally on our own,"
is the way Neil Young's song
begins, and Drake apparently
believed it was a mite too radical:
he banned it. However, thanks to
some excellent writeups by critics
such as Ralph J. Gleason, "Ohio"
made it high on the national sales
lists, if not on Bill Drake's
playlist.
No artist is too famous to
escape Drake's wrath. The Beatles'
single "Ballad of John and Yoko"
was never played on KFRC
because it contained the word
"Christ." On the similarly
formatted cross-town station
KYA, "Ballad" hit number one, as
it did on nationwide sales charts.
John Lennon's singles
"Mother" and Cold Turkey" also
never saw the light of day on
KFRC, the former because it was
"too long" and the latter because
of its subject matter.
However, I suppose to show us
he's really hep, uh, I mean hip,
Drake did program "Power to the
People," a bit of ideological drivel
if ever there was.
Still another way of access to
Top 40, and one that many artists
are taking as the importance of
the lp ascends, is to have a good
reputation as an album artist
behind. In this way, Rod
Stewart's "Maggie Mae" and
Gordon Lightfoot's "If You
Could Read My Mind" both hit.
It is this last method that could
in the end be the downfall of Top
40 radio, and Bill Drake. Before,
every artist from Bill Haley and
the Comets to Elvis to the Beatles
needed a hit single to create an
audience for an album. Now
though, the process is being
reversed: the single is frequently
lifted off an already-successful
album.
But until the final dying gasp of
Top 40, I am afraid we will have
to take our "Uncle
Albert/Admiral Halsey" next to
"Maggie Mae," and have "Hey
Jude" fitted in between "Yummy
Yummy Yummy I Got Love in
My Tummy'' and
"Chicka-Boom."

than likely passed when a
well-placed payment to a radio
station program director could
make or break a group, one of the
most potent forces in the music
industry remains so-called "top 40
radio."
In the San Francisco area,
easily the prime practitioner of
the art today is KFRC, the
RKO-owned, Bill Drake
programmed "Big 610." And yet,
despite the clout of this
station and others like it, few if
any people ever pay attention to
the behind-the-scenes intrigues
that often decide what you hear
sandwiched in between the pimple
cream commercials.
Bill Drake-RKO stations are
easily recognizable by their
nearly-identical fonnats and
playlists. This should be apparent
to all those from Southern
California, where KHJ not only
has a similar format, but has in
fact operated a working
agreement with KFRC that allows
the two stations to switch d.j.'s.
In this manner, such former Bay
Area personalities as Bill Wade,
Mike Philips, and Dave Diamond
have all found their way to LA.
At the center of this is Bill
Drake himself, who probably has
more to say about the fate of an
individual 45 than anyone on the
west coast.
Drake is the man responsible
for drawing up the basic playlists
for the stations. So, although the
popularity surveys are supposedly
based on the record's sales and
number of requests, Drake has a
lot to do with whether the record
is heard in the first place.
Take, for example, a single
released late in the summer of
1970, "Satin Red and Black
Velvet Woman," by Dave Mason
on Blue Thumb Records. Mason,
ex-guitarist for Traffic, had
written that group's biggest singel,
"Feelin' Alright?" and had had a
moderate success with a single,
"Only You Know and I Know,"
off a very successful lp, "Alone
Together."
"Satin Red" was, in a word,
extremely good. In fact, on
several small local stations where
it was played, it rose to the top
ten. But it was never programmed
by Drake. Possible reason: the
release lacked much of the natural
hype associated with Mason's first
(on which Eric Clapton and
several of Delaney & Bonnie's
Friends played), and Blue Thumb,
at the time an independent (now
affiliated with Capitol), was too
small to manufacture any
pre-release demand for it.
Question: should a record not
be heard simply becausy of a

record company's inability to do a
promo job?
Occasionally, Drake has refused
to program some songs that have
achieved national prominence
anyway. The obvious example is
"Ohio" by Crosby, Stills, Nash &
Young, which blasted Nixon and
the Kent State tragedy in no
uncertain terms.
"Tin soldiers and Nixon
comin'/we're finally on our own,"
is the way Neil Young's song
begins, and Drake apparently
believed it was a mite too radical:
he banned it. However, thanks to
some excellent writeups by critics
such as Ralph J. Gleason, "Ohio"
made it high on the national sales
lists, if not on Bill Drake's
playlist.
No artist is too famous to
escape Drake's wrath. The Beatles'
single "Ballad of John and Yoko"
was never played on KFRC
because it contained the word
"Christ." On the similarly
formatted cross-town station
KYA, "Ballad" hit number one, as
it did on nationwide sales charts.
John Lennon's singles
"Mother" and Cold Turkey" also
never saw the light of day on
KFRC, the former because it was
"too long" and the latter because
of its subject matter.
However, I suppose to show us
he's really hep, uh, I mean hip,
Drake did program "Power to the
People," a bit of ideological drivel
if ever there was.
Still another way of access to
Top 40, and one that many artists
are taking as the importance of
the lp ascends, is to have a good
reputation as an album artist
behind. In this way, Rod
Stewart's "Maggie Mae" and
Gordon Lightfoot's "If You
Could Read My Mind" both hit.
It is this last method that could
in the end be the downfall of Top
40 radio, and Bill Drake. Before,
every artist from Bill Haley and
the Comets to Elvis to the Beatles
needed a hit single to create an
audience for an album. Now
though, the process is being
reversed: the single is frequently
lifted off an already-successful
album.
But until the final dying gasp of
Top 40, I am afraid we will have
to take our "Uncle
Albert/Admiral Halsey" next to
"Maggie Mae," and have "Hey
Jude" fitted in between "Yummy
Yummy Yummy I Got Love in
My Tummy'' and
"Chicka-Boom."

make or break a group, one of the
most potent forces in the music
industry remains so-called "top 40
radio."
In the San Francisco area,
easily the prime practitioner of
the art today is KFRC, the
RKO-owned, Bill Drake
programmed "Big 610." And yet,
despite the clout of this
station and others like it, few if
any people ever pay attention to
the behind-the-scenes intrigues
that often decide what you hear
sandwiched in between the pimple
cream commercials.
Bill Drake-RKO stations are
easily recognizable by their
nearly-identical fonnats and
playlists. This should be apparent
to all those from Southern
California, where KHJ not only
has a similar format, but has in
fact operated a working
agreement with KFRC that allows
the two stations to switch d.j.'s.
In this manner, such former Bay
Area personalities as Bill Wade,
Mike Philips, and Dave Diamond
have all found their way to LA.
At the center of this is Bill
Drake himself, who probably has
more to say about the fate of an
individual 45 than anyone on the
west coast.
Drake is the man responsible
for drawing up the basic playlists
for the stations. So, although the
popularity surveys are supposedly
based on the record's sales and
number of requests, Drake has a
lot to do with whether the record
is heard in the first place.
Take, for example, a single
released late in the summer of
1970, "Satin Red and Black
Velvet Woman," by Dave Mason
on Blue Thumb Records. Mason,
ex-guitarist for Traffic, had
written that group's biggest singel,
"Feelin' Alright?" and had had a
moderate success with a single,
"Only You Know and I Know,"
off a very successful lp, "Alone
Together."
"Satin Red" was, in a word,
extremely good. In fact, on
several small local stations where
it was played, it rose to the top
ten. But it was never programmed
by Drake. Possible reason: the
release lacked much of the natural
hype associated with Mason's first
(on which Eric Clapton and
several of Delaney & Bonnie's
Friends played), and Blue Thumb,
at the time an independent (now
affiliated with Capitol), was too
small to manufacture any
pre-release demand for it.
Question: should a record not
be heard simply becausy of a

record company's inability to do a
promo job?
Occasionally, Drake has refused
to program some songs that have
achieved national prominence
anyway. The obvious example is
"Ohio" by Crosby, Stills, Nash &
Young, which blasted Nixon and
the Kent State tragedy in no
uncertain terms.
"Tin soldiers and Nixon
comin'/we're finally on our own,"
is the way Neil Young's song
begins, and Drake apparently
believed it was a mite too radical:
he banned it. However, thanks to
some excellent writeups by critics
such as Ralph J. Gleason, "Ohio"
made it high on the national sales
lists, if not on Bill Drake's
playlist.
No artist is too famous to
escape Drake's wrath. The Beatles'
single "Ballad of John and Yoko"
was never played on KFRC
because it contained the word
"Christ." On the similarly
formatted cross-town station
KYA, "Ballad" hit number one, as
it did on nationwide sales charts.
John Lennon's singles
"Mother" and Cold Turkey" also
never saw the light of day on
KFRC, the former because it was
"too long" and the latter because
of its subject matter.
However, I suppose to show us
he's really hep, uh, I mean hip,
Drake did program "Power to the
People," a bit of ideological drivel
if ever there was.
Still another way of access to
Top 40, and one that many artists
are taking as the importance of
the lp ascends, is to have a good
reputation as an album artist
behind. In this way, Rod
Stewart's "Maggie Mae" and
Gordon Lightfoot's "If You
Could Read My Mind" both hit.
It is this last method that could
in the end be the downfall of Top
40 radio, and Bill Drake. Before,
every artist from Bill Haley and
the Comets to Elvis to the Beatles
needed a hit single to create an
audience for an album. Now
though, the process is being
reversed: the single is frequently
lifted off an already-successful
album.
But until the final dying gasp of
Top 40, I am afraid we will have
to take our "Uncle
Albert/Admiral Halsey" next to
"Maggie Mae," and have "Hey
Jude" fitted in between "Yummy
Yummy Yummy I Got Love in
My Tummy'' and
"Chicka-Boom."
