# Superb Weekend Blues
## 
### PAUL GRUSHKIN 
Is it entirely pointless to
mention that Sonny Terry and
Brownie McGhee, who played a
weekend stand at Palo Alto's In
Your Ear, were very, very fine?
Most Bay Area blues freaks,
there or not, won't be at all
surprised—the two venerable
bluesmen have been doing that
sort of thing, separate or together,
since the early 1930'5.
Sonny Terry, for ye of little
faith, is THE finest harmonica
player in the blues tradition living
today. Most harp players today
owe their styles and their 'tricks'
to this musician, who has received
only a portion of the acclaim he
deserves.
Blinded early in life, he
nevertheless traveled the South,
blowin' his harp and payin' all of
life's dues, and somehow came to
the attention of another
wandering minstrel, Woody
Guthrie.
Segments of their 78 r.p.m.
recordings of the late '30's have
been immortalized on the "Sonny
Terry" album on the Archive of
Folk Music label. There Sonny's
blowin' with a vengeance, hard
and rasty.
At the In Your Ear sessions,
portions of which may someday
appear in vinyl, the Terry harp
was on the whole sweet,
melodically gentle. But oh what
absolute artistry! What brilliant
control, with hands artfully
bending and shaping that clean,
pure stream of sound.
There were other numbers,

however, such as a real
down-home version of "John
Henry," where one felt like
stompin' the feet and banging on
the walls. A real fine
country-revivial type atmosphere,
with the Terry harp snorting and
rasping away.
Brownie McGhee, Terry's
clean-picking guitarist vocalist
partner of many years, traded
stanzas—each moving the old
favorite at pounding speed.
"Walk On" had the audience
singing along, but perhaps the
most moving was "The Sun Will
Shine In My Back Door
Someday," which many people
will recognize as a lyrical line
from the traditional "I Know You
Rider.' Here Terry's voice took
on an agonizing, unevenly paced
quality that held the audience
mesmerized.
Truly a rare night of country
blues. But not so rare for Sonny
Terry and Brownie McGhee, and
that's perhaps what's so amazing.
