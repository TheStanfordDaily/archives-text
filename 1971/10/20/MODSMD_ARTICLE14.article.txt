# Lear-Stewart: Vocal Jewels
## 
### GARY SCHMIDGALL 
Three fine musicians—soprano
Evelyn Lear, baritone Thomas
Stewart and pianist Philip
Eisenberg—gave a recital Sunday
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium that
displayed a string of vocal jewels
of exquisite though wildly
differing cut.
Lieder recitalists usually run
amuck in the swift changes of
mood and style which this
ungainly art-form requires, but all
three performers were equal to
the demands of a variety of
musical idioms.
Perhaps unavoidably, Stewart's
splendid voice was the special
treat of the evening; it is a
powerful one in a generous range,
without even a touch of the usual
baritonal inertness. In the duo
numbers he dutifully scaled down
his tone for Lear (his wife, one
should add), who was in less than
her best voice in the initial stages.
Still—and this is her
trademark—Lear achieved some
beautifully introspective vocal
effects, especially in her trio of
Wolf songs and two haunting Ives
pieces.
Fine "Der Wanderer"
The recital opened with the
usual, rather pallid
throat-exercisers of Purcell,
Handel and Haydn, but this
on-stage warming up was
immediately vindicated by
Stewart's version of Schubert's
"Der Wanderer" and Erlkonig,
both paradigms of psychological
fullness and sheer vocal strength.
After the Wolf songs followed a
quartet of lighter-than-air items; a
charming Saint-Saens "Pastorale"
escaped best from the coyness of
it all.
After intermission came a
choice of Charles Ives songs that
suggest this composer was,
spiritually, somewhere between
Grandma Moses and Norman
Rockwell. Ives alone of American
composers was able successfully
to make fun of America and
Americana—fun, that is, borne of
love rather than derisiveness.
These songs were just such fun in

their joyous, unpretentious
sentimentality. Stewart in "Circus
Band" was the very best.
Changing breathlessly from the
pleasantly ridiculous to the
sublime, Lear and Stewart closed
with three Mozart opera duets.
Perhaps a sign of fatigue, the
phrasing and purity of tone
showed a slip in finesse here.
Among the encores, a Dvorak
duet containing daring advice to
lovers (into bed ASAP) was
fetching, as was a nippy
arrangement of a traditional reel.
In summary, both singers amply
proved why they are eminent
among recitalists. And pianist
Eisenberg's exuberant and feeling
accompaniment was on the same
superior level of achievement.
Sparse Audience
A sad footnote: though very
responsive, the audience was

scandalously sparse. This is a slim
recommendation of sophistication
for what ought to be a highly
sophisticated neck of the woods.
Not so surprisingly, students
proved once again their shocking
unadventurousness. Excluding
ushers, they could have been
counted on the fingers of one
maimed hand.
The real reason for this (1 set
gently aside the possibility that
most students are scared stiff of
culture in so unmitigated a form
as a recital) is economical: "West
Side Story" at 50 cents or this
event at $3.75. One answer the
Public Events people should
consider, in light of invariably
poor student attendance at such
events as this, would be much
cheaper Student Rush Tickets.
Better some students than none.
