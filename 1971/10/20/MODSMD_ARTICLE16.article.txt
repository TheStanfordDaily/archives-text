# Water Poloists Seek NCAA Crown
## 
### DOUG WILSON 
Ron Sevara, the coach of the
USC water polo team, was
understandably dejected. "We
were expecting a tough game, so
we weren't surprised," he said,
"but we didn't play well. Why we
didn't play well was as much
Stanford's fault as it was ours."
Peter Gadd, the Stanford
goalie, was, on the other hand,
noticeably jubilant. "Usually
when we come down here, we
don't do so well because it's
difficult to play in this (USC's)
pool. I'm just really happy,
man. .

Stanford's 8-3 victory over USC
was the immediate reason for
Gadd's enthusiasm, but the
unstated goal of the 1971
Stanford water polo team—a
national championship that has
eluded the Indians for eight
years—was just as much behind
the grins and back-slapping which
followed Saturday's Stanford
victory.
With victories over USC, Irvine,
I)e An/a and Berkeley—all
considered top polo teams—and
narrow defeats by San Jose State
and UCLA, (the latter in
sudden-death play) Coach Jim

Gaughran's squad is aiming for
this year's "Big Game" against
San Jose State on Friday
determined to avenge their defeat
at the hands of the Spartans in the
last eight seconds of play two
weeks ago in the finals of the
Northern California Water Polo
Tournament.
Gaughran Pleased
Gaughran, after last weekend's
actiorf down south, is naturally
pleased with his squad's
performance. "With the job we
did against UCLA, and then to
come back against USC and win
like this, I think we have a very
solid team." The squad agrees the
atmosphere of cooperation and
determination is evident in and
out of the pool. As Gadd put it,
"We are a very cohesive, very
close group. We don't win or lose
as individuals, but as a team. This
is much more of a seven-man
thing than it has been in the years
I*ve been here."
Five of the seven starters have
been with the water polo team
since their freshman year: Gadd,
Rick Massimino, Mike Davis,
Randv Wilkins and Rob Wooley.

Senior Bill Simpkins is a transfer
from De Anza playing his second
year of polo for the Indians, and
Ken Hammer, also a senior,
returns after two years in the
army.
1968 was a successful year for
the then-freshman water polo
team. Its members knew,
however, that in their sophomore
and junior seasons, opposition
from teams like Irvine, Southern
Cal and UCLA would be tough, as
it definitely proved to be. "We all
pointed towards this year," says
Massimino. "We all know that
after the last game this year it's all
over. That's why we're all
determined to do the best we
can."
Massimino Well Known
Massimino, the team captain, is
clearly the most well-known of
the players. Thrice an All-Pacific-8
selection,an All-America selection
last year, and participant in the
United States' gold medal team in
the 1971 Pan American (James,
the Stanford senior would seem to
have all the credentials for a
one-man show. Not so.
Massimino, like his teammates, is

quick to emphasize the
importance of team play, and
describes this year's squad as "a
unit which has a cohesiveness that
is based on determination and
friendship."
Unlike Massimino, many of the
players do not have an extensive
background in water polo, which
makes beating teams such as USC
and Irvine all the more enjoyable.
Randy Wilkins is a case in point.
Although a prep school
All-American in several swimming
events, the Dania, Florida senir
had never played polo before
coming to Stanford, where he put
in much time learning the game.
Wilkins is now considered one of
the squad's finest players, and, as
one teammate put it, "He's
probably the most underrated
player on the coast."
Davis Praised
Mike Davis, a field player from
Palo Alto, assumes much of the
offensive scoring load, and, like
Massimino, is primarily a hold
player. His performances thus far
have earned him kudos not only
from Gaughran but from
opponents as well. One
commented, "You've got to keep
an eye on him every second,
because he'll take advantage of
any mistake you make."
Team Play
Rob Wooley, who earned high
school All-America honors in
water polo in Modesto, has
participated on the varsity
swimming team at Stanford as
well. "A good team man," as
fellow members described him,
Wooley is considered one of the
strongest field players, one who
can take the constant, often rough
action which demands much of a
poloist. Bill Simpkins, like Wooley
more a field player than a hole
man, is the team's only
left-hander, and initiates most of
the fast breaking which is part of
Stanford's swimming game.
Ken Hammer, from Downey,
California, is perhaps the fastest
sprinter on the squad, and was
also a member of the varsity
swimming team prior to military
service. Now, after a two-year
absence, Hammer is also
considered a powerful shooter,
and, as Massimino says, "He'll be
a big asset to the team come
NCAA time."
Greg Loitz, the freshman star
from Corona del Mar, has proven
himself to be something of a
phenomenon among the
primarily-senior team members.

Admired as a disciplined player,
Loitz figured prominently in the
Varsity-Alumni game, and earned
high praise from Gaughran for his
performances in Los Angeles.
'Loitz is doing a fantastic job as a
freshman, he is playing super
water polo."
Good Bench
A more than competent bench,
made up mostly of junior players,
provides Gaughran with depth.
Led by Stu Rowe, a junior from
Palos Verdes Estates, Calif., who
has contributed tothe scoring
efforts in most of the games thus
far, the "junior squad" also
includes Dan Powlison, from
Honolulu; Mark Van Brussel, from
Altadena, Calif.; and Bob Warren,
also from Honolulu. Sophomores
Tom Cummings, Don Roberts,
Tom Warden, and Ken Carr, and
freshmen Stan Johnson and Larry
Mann complete the 1971 varsity
water polo roster.
Team camaraderie extends to,
and is greatly facilitated by, team
manager Hill Huck, a member of
the 1968 freshman squad. "Bill is
very important to the success of
our team," says a varsity member.
"He even comes to the games with
a Speedo on under his slacks."
Huck, like the varsity players,
has high hopes as far as prospects
for national prominence are
concerned. However, his
enthusiasm is tempered somewhat
by a slight disappointment at the
.imall spectator turnout at
Stanford home matches.

Massimino concurs. "When we go
away for games, we're appreciated
more there, by opposing fans,
than we are here," he commented.
"The UCLA game was at a high
school pool on a Friday night and
there were still about 1000 people
attending."
Home Match
Stanford fans will have an
opportunity this weekend to
watch the powerful varsity
poloists in action at home.
Friday's powerhouse match with
San Jose at 3:00 p.m. is followed
on Saturday by a 10:00 contest
with UC-Davis. Both games will be
played at Encina Pool
Against UCLA, Stanford lost
by one point in sudden death
overtime; the Bruins' strong
shooter, Paul Bezhkehazy—who
scored five of UCLA's 11 goals,
will be ineligible for NCAA
competition. Against San Jose
tw) weeks ago, Stanford again
lost by a point, in the last 8
seconds of the final quarter.
A Stanford victory over San
Jose Friday could well be an
important factor, at least
psychologically, in bringing within
reach an objective for which the
varsity has long been working,
many for four years. Gadd, the
able and highly-respected goalie
from Visalie, Calif., sums it up:
"This year is the high point of my
athletic career-but I think
everybody would be in agreement
that it's theirs too.

HAMMER THROW-Ken Hammer drives for a shot against the hapless
Daily reporter who incorrectly identified him as Bill Simpkins in a
previous article. Hammer went on to defeat the reporter, 1 -0.

PASS PLAY—Stanford goalie Pete Gadd watches as field teammate
Randy Wilkins gets set to pass. Wilkins, who had not played
competitive water polo before coming to Stanford, is now considered
one of the squad's most valuable players.

NO TROJAN BALL -Mike Davis fends off an attacking USC
opponent, whose taned fingers did nothing to help him steal the ball
from the Indian poloist. Davis, who assumes much of the offensive
scoring load for Stanford, contributed to the varsitv's 8-3 victors' over
USC.
