# Injury Situation Improves
## 
### CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
The Indians' injury situation
has improved to the point where
only Eric Cross might not be able
to play Saturday when Stanford
takes on Washington State's
Cougars at the stadium.
Hillary Shockley had recovered
from his ankle sprain in time for
the USC game, but John Ralston
held him out of the contest
because he did not see enough
practice time during the previous
week's drills. Shockley is working
full time with the team this week
and will probably play in his first
game in over three weeks.
Pete Lazetich suffered slight
back strain in the USC victory,
but he is recovering well and will
play Saturday. Mike Simone is
working out better than Ralston
expected on his sprained ankle
and will also see action against the
Cougars.
Cross Doubtful
Eric Cross re-injured his
hamstring returning a punt against
the Trojans in the fourth quarter
and might be held out of the
Washington State game.
Ralston gave the team Monday
afternoon off to rest up and had

them view films of the Cougars
Monday night.
The Indians lead the Pac-8 in
total defense and rushing defense
after six games. The Thunder
Chickens have allowed an average
of only 215 yards in offense, and
have given up only 94.8 yards per
game on the ground. The closest
team to Stanford in rushing
defense is Washington, which has
allowed 128 yards a game.
Bunce Leads Pac-8
Don Bunce widened his total
offense lead over second place
Sonny Sixkiller last weekend since
the Husky quarterback had
another bad day in Washington's
loss to Oregon last Saturday.
Bunce has produced 210 yards per
game on the average to Sixkiller's
199.
The only other Indians who
rank high in the Pac-B's individual
statistics are Rod Garcia and

Benny Barnes. Garcia is fourth in
the league in total scoring with 4 0
points, eight behind Bernard
Jackson of Washington State.
Benny Barnes is locked in a
three-way tie for second in the
Pac-8 in interceptions with four to
his credit. Three of these came off
the arm of Sixkiller.
The Cougars will come to
Stanford led by Jackson, the
Pac-B's second leading rusher.
Jackson is primarily responsible
for the Cougars leading the league
in rushing offense with an average
of 24 3 yards per game.
Last In Passing
In contrast with their top rated
running attack, the Cougars are
dead last in the league in passing
offense. The main excitement
Saturday then, should come from
the confrontation of the Pac-B's
leading rushing attack and the
toughest defense against the run
in the league.

Saturday's 33-18 win over USC. Jones miraculously escaped Sampson's grasp, leaving the Indian lineman
only a handhold on his jersey. Eventually escaping Sampson completely, Jones was quickly caught by
another Stanford defender and thrown for a loss. The game was a battle between the Pac-8's leading
defensive and offensive units, and the Indian defense won the statistics battle, holding the Trojan attack
far below its 405 yard per game average.

Washington State game.
Ralston gave the team Monday
afternoon off to rest up and had

them view films of the Cougars
Monday night.
The Indians lead the Pac-8 in
total defense and rushing defense
after six games. The Thunder
Chickens have allowed an average
of only 215 yards in offense, and
have given up only 94.8 yards per
game on the ground. The closest
team to Stanford in rushing
defense is Washington, which has
allowed 128 yards a game.
Bunce Leads Pac-8
Don Bunce widened his total
offense lead over second place
Sonny Sixkiller last weekend since
the Husky quarterback had
another bad day in Washington's
loss to Oregon last Saturday.
Bunce has produced 210 yards per
game on the average to Sixkiller's
199.
The only other Indians who
rank high in the Pac-B's individual
statistics are Rod Garcia and

Benny Barnes. Garcia is fourth in
the league in total scoring with 4 0
points, eight behind Bernard
Jackson of Washington State.
Benny Barnes is locked in a
three-way tie for second in the
Pac-8 in interceptions with four to
his credit. Three of these came off
the arm of Sixkiller.
The Cougars will come to
Stanford led by Jackson, the
Pac-B's second leading rusher.
Jackson is primarily responsible
for the Cougars leading the league
in rushing offense with an average
of 24 3 yards per game.
Last In Passing
In contrast with their top rated
running attack, the Cougars are
dead last in the league in passing
offense. The main excitement
Saturday then, should come from
the confrontation of the Pac-B's
leading rushing attack and the
toughest defense against the run
in the league.

LOOK OUT BELOW—Defensive tackle Greg Sampson leaps onto Trojan quarterback Jimmy Jones in last
Saturday's 33-18 win over USC. Jones miraculously escaped Sampson's grasp, leaving the Indian lineman
only a handhold on his jersey. Eventually escaping Sampson completely, Jones was quickly caught by
another Stanford defender and thrown for a loss. The game was a battle between the Pac-8's leading
defensive and offensive units, and the Indian defense won the statistics battle, holding the Trojan attack
far below its 405 yard per game average.

CATCH ME IF YOU CAN—Jackie Brown breaks around the Trojan
right end during Saturday night's trouncing of USC in th£ Coliseum.
Both Brown and the defenders had to cope with the heavy rain which
was falling during this play.
The Indians' injury situation
has improved to the point where
only Eric Cross might not be able
to play Saturday when Stanford
takes on Washington State's
Cougars at the stadium.
Hillary Shockley had recovered
from his ankle sprain in time for
the USC game, but John Ralston
held him out of the contest
because he did not see enough
practice time during the previous
week's drills. Shockley is working
full time with the team this week
and will probably play in his first
game in over three weeks.
Pete Lazetich suffered slight
back strain in the USC victory,
but he is recovering well and will
play Saturday. Mike Simone is
working out better than Ralston
expected on his sprained ankle
and will also see action against the
Cougars.
