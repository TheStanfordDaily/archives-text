# Soccer Team Splits Pair Of Games With Santa Clara And Col Squads
## 
### JAY GELLERT 
Plagued by inexperience and
injuries, Stanford's soccer team
fell prey to Cal's Golden Bears,
4-1, Saturday after an encouraging
3-2 victory over Santa Clara
Wednesday. The split leaves
Stanford with 2 wins and 3 losses

and virtually eliminates them
from the NCAA regionals.
Coach Priddle is still looking
for solutions to the three main
problems that have affected the
team all season. They all stem
from the inexperience inherent in
a team with only two returning

starters. First, there is not enough
passing within the front line and
most of the goals are unassisted.
Priddle had hoped to move Sam
Casey to the front-line, but he
cannot find anyone to replace him
on defense.
Second, the team is having
trouble shifting from offense to
defense. For example, in the
California game, Cal players beat
the Stanford defenders down the
field for two goals. Priddle can
only wait for the defense to
develop. Stanford has also been
afflicted with an inordinate
number of penalty shots, all for
using hands in the penalty zone.
Goalie Walt Harris was able to
save the first four of these shots,
but the fifth gave Cal their first
goal Saturday.
Santa Clara Win
In the Santa Clara game, Stan
ford dominated following a Santa
Clara goal early in the first quarter.
Stanford's victory was highlighted
with goals by Ed Caldwell (on an
assist by Mike Frank), Tom
Waddles and the winning goal by

leading scorer, Rocky Barber. The
defense was good, as was the
goal-tending of Walt Harris.
Overall, this was the squad's finest
game this season.
Unfortunately, the Cal game
was a different story. Without
injured Mike Caldwell and plagued
by serious mistakes, Stanford
could not keep up with a fairly
strong Cal team. Stanford stayed
close for three quarters, with Cal
scoring on a loose ball goal and
penalty shot while Stanford was
paced by a Rocky Barber goal.
But, in the fourth quarter, Cal ran
away on two goals by Carvallo.
When the defense did not check
back, Carvallo beat them for easy
goals.
Invitational
Upcoming this Friday at 3 p.m.
is the Menlo Invitational, which
Priddle feels Stanford has a good
chance to win. Last year, Stanford
lost the tournament in overtime
to San Francisco State, the team
Stanford plays first this year. Also
competing are Menlo College and
Santa Clara.

lost the tournament in overtime
to San Francisco State, the team
Stanford plays first this year. Also
competing are Menlo College and
Santa Clara.
Plagued by inexperience and
injuries, Stanford's soccer team
fell prey to Cal's Golden Bears,
4-1, Saturday after an encouraging
3-2 victory over Santa Clara
Wednesday. The split leaves
Stanford with 2 wins and 3 losses

and virtually eliminates them
from the NCAA regionals.
Coach Priddle is still looking
for solutions to the three main
problems that have affected the
team all season. They all stem
from the inexperience inherent in
a team with only two returning

starters. First, there is not enough
passing within the front line and
most of the goals are unassisted.
Priddle had hoped to move Sam
Casey to the front-line, but he
cannot find anyone to replace him
on defense.
Second, the team is having
trouble shifting from offense to
defense. For example, in the
California game, Cal players beat
the Stanford defenders down the
field for two goals. Priddle can
only wait for the defense to
develop. Stanford has also been
afflicted with an inordinate
number of penalty shots, all for
using hands in the penalty zone.
Goalie Walt Harris was able to
save the first four of these shots,
but the fifth gave Cal their first
goal Saturday.
Santa Clara Win
In the Santa Clara game, Stan
ford dominated following a Santa
Clara goal early in the first quarter.
Stanford's victory was highlighted
with goals by Ed Caldwell (on an
assist by Mike Frank), Tom
Waddles and the winning goal by

leading scorer, Rocky Barber. The
defense was good, as was the
goal-tending of Walt Harris.
Overall, this was the squad's finest
game this season.
Unfortunately, the Cal game
was a different story. Without
injured Mike Caldwell and plagued
by serious mistakes, Stanford
could not keep up with a fairly
strong Cal team. Stanford stayed
close for three quarters, with Cal
scoring on a loose ball goal and
penalty shot while Stanford was
paced by a Rocky Barber goal.
But, in the fourth quarter, Cal ran
away on two goals by Carvallo.
When the defense did not check
back, Carvallo beat them for easy
goals.
Invitational
Upcoming this Friday at 3 p.m.
is the Menlo Invitational, which
Priddle feels Stanford has a good
chance to win. Last year, Stanford
lost the tournament in overtime
to San Francisco State, the team
Stanford plays first this year. Also
competing are Menlo College and
Santa Clara.
