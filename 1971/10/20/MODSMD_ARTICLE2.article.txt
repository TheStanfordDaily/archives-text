# At Hoover Conference
## Iranian Students Condemn Shah 
### JIM WASCHER 
A resolution condemning the Shah
of Iran as well as the Hoover Institution
and Dr. Parviz Adle, the Iranian
Consul-General in San FYancisco
climaxed the second day of
presentations by the Iranian Students
Association (ISA) at a Hoover
conference commemorating the 2500 th
anniversary of the monarchy in Iran.
At the conlusion of the ISA's
presentation yesterday, German
professor and Venceremos member
Juan Flores presented the resolution
which stated that "the participants of
this conference condemn the intentions

of the Shah's regime and the attempts
of Mr. Adle, with the help of the
Hoover Institution, to carry out such
intentions."
The resolution also decried
conditions in Iran and called for
support of the Students' Association
and its activities. James Hobson,
Information Officer for the Institution,
had denied several charges outlined in
the resolution.
Those in attendance decided to hold
a vote on the resolution, although no
vote was scheduled during the
conference. The resolution passed 7 7 to
29 with 13 abstaining, although critics

of the students contended that the vote
was unrepresentative of the entire
conference.
After the vote, Hobson said of the
resolution: "Because this conference
was planned and organized as a
scholarly one and carried out with free
and open discussion, the Hoover
Institution regrets that it degenerated
temporarily into a political exercise."
The presentations by the Iranian
students were permitted by the
sponsors of the conference which was
entitled "Iran: 25 Centuries of
Achievements" after the first session of
the conference was disrupted by the

Iranians and Venceremos on Monday.
The president of the Iranian Students'
Association in the United States, who
would only give his first name, Parviz,
for fear of the Iranian Secret Police,
referred to the conference's concession
of time as "a people's victory."
At the beginning of yesterday's
presentation, the Iranian students
posted a banner reading "A Hungry
Nation Does Not Need A 2500 Year
Celebration."
In concluding the attack on the
Shah's economic programs which he
had begun on Monday, Parviz stated
that the common people of Iran have
not shared in the benefits of the
nation's increased prosperity and
productivity.
The ISA head also attacked what he
said were the tragically misordered
priorities of the Shah's regime. He
pointed out that, in comparison to last
year's total expenditure of eight million
dollars for the social needs of the
people, the government had spent
between four and eight hundred million
dollars on the extravagant 2500 th Year
celebration attended by about 100 of
the world's heads of state.
The student went on to cite
statistics showing that Iran, while
having no apparent foreign enemies,
last year spent six times as much on
defense as it did on education. He said
that this proportion was
incomprehensible in a nation where 70
per cent of the prople were illiterate.
