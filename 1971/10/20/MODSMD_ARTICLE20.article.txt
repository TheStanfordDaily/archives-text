## Runners Face Cougars 
### MIKE CHASSON 
The Stanford Cross-Country team, coming off an impressive
victory against UCLA and USC faces Pacific-8 powerhouse
Washington State this weekend on the Stanford golf course at 10:00
a.m.
The Cougars are led by two All-Americans, Mark Hiefield and Don
Smith, who placed fourth and fifth respectively at last year's Pacific-8
meet. Close behind these two are three outstanding freshmen runners:
one who was last year's California State High School champion, and
another who was a National Junior champion in New Zealand.
Indians Must Excel
Stanford must get great efforts from its front line runners if it is to
upset the Cougars. Coach Marshall Claik believes that Duncan
Macdonald, who did an outstanding job in winning at Westwood,has
an excellent chance of beating Washington State's top runners. Bemie
Lahde and Arvid Kretz, who showed he has rounded into shape on the
basis of his performance at Westwood, must be very close to the top
with Macdonald for Stanford to overcome the Cougars depth.
A question mark for the Indians is Robert Coe, who came out for
the team just before the USC-UCLA meet. Coe who placed fourth at
Westwood, injured his knee in that race and it is not known whether
he will be able to run against Washington State.
Coe Doubtful
Without Coe the Indians will be hard pressed to beat the Cougars
unless Kurt Schoenrock, Dave Whiting, and newcomer to the top
sever, Brian Middlestadt are able to move closer to the Stanford front
runners. Coach Clark figures the race to be very close and very fast on
Stanford's 4.2 mile course. If Stanford can finish with three runners in
the top four it has an excellent chance to upset the Cougars.
