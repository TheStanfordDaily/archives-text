# Lyman Neutral On Hoover
## 
### TONY BOLLEN 
President Lyman last night cited Stanford's tradition of
allowing divergent political viewpoints to be heard, but
would make no comment concerning the policies of the
Hoover Institute, or the conservatism of Institute Director
W. Glenn Campbell.
"Stanford has not been monochrome in our presentation
of political viewpoints," Lyman stated during last night's
bi-weekly KZSU press conference. But, he added, there are
"all sorts of ways of being dogmatic."
Lyman made the statement in response to a question
concerning testimony in Monday's session of the Franklin
trial, during which Campbell said he "would just as soon"
not have Communists teaching social science courses here.
Earlier Campbell had said that Hoover had never
"knowingly" invited Communists to speak in any
Hoover-sponsored public conferences.
No Intervention
Emphasizing that he was in no way "intervening" in the
Franklin hearings, Lyman said that, in his opinion,
Communist party members are not dedicated to "the
canons of academic freedom." But, he declared, there will
be no tests of faculty members while he is president, and
membership in organizations will not be a deciding factor
in making faculty appointments.
In another portion of the conference, President Lyman
reiterated the statement by Provost John Schwartz that
prosecutions may result from Monday's disruption of the
Hoover Institute's conference entitled, "Iran: 25 Centuries
of Achievement." Fifteen to twenty students heckled
speakers at that conference which was protested by the
Iranian Students Association (ISA), until ISA members

were allowed to participate.
Lyman said the protestors may have violated the
University's anti-disruption policy, but that it is too early
to say for sure. While prosecution remains a possibility, he
added, the story is still being pieced together; thus, he said,
he would make no further comment.
Equal Opportunities
Turning to the issue of equal job opportunities for
women, Lyman said he agreed that women tend to get "less
permanent, less secure, less well-paid jobs." Stanford's
number of women faculty members is below the national
average for institutions of higher education; this figure is
misleading, however, explained Lyman, since the national
figure includes junior colleges and other public institutions
with a higher percentage of female faculty members. For
institutions of its type, Stanford is close to the norm, but,
added Lyman, "Even at that we don't shape up very well."
Earlier in the press conference, Lyman was asked about
the current impasse regarding the Stanford Judicial Council
(SJC) in which the student senate refuses to appoint a
selection committee to name students to the Council.
"There's no way to get clear of it if the ASSU mechanisms
are not willing to work," Lyman said. "The mechanism is
inoperative due to refusal of the student senate to make it
work."
Lyman added that "extraordinary" measures may be
required if the controversy is not resolved soon via normal
channels within the senate.
Last night's panel included KZSU News Director Pete
Williams, Chapparal editor Tina Swent, Arena editor Chris
Mocker, Tony Bollen from the Daily and Linda Crouse

required if the controversy is not resolved soon via normal
channels within the senate.
Last night's panel included KZSU News Director Pete
Williams, Chapparal editor Tina Swent, Arena editor Chris
Mocker, Tony Bollen from the Daily and Linda Crouse
for Employes Organize.
President Lyman last night cited Stanford's tradition of
allowing divergent political viewpoints to be heard, but
would make no comment concerning the policies of the
Hoover Institute, or the conservatism of Institute Director
W. Glenn Campbell.
"Stanford has not been monochrome in our presentation
of political viewpoints," Lyman stated during last night's
bi-weekly KZSU press conference. But, he added, there are
"all sorts of ways of being dogmatic."
Lyman made the statement in response to a question
concerning testimony in Monday's session of the Franklin
trial, during which Campbell said he "would just as soon"
not have Communists teaching social science courses here.
Earlier Campbell had said that Hoover had never
"knowingly" invited Communists to speak in any
Hoover-sponsored public conferences.
No Intervention
Emphasizing that he was in no way "intervening" in the
Franklin hearings, Lyman said that, in his opinion,
Communist party members are not dedicated to "the
canons of academic freedom." But, he declared, there will
be no tests of faculty members while he is president, and
membership in organizations will not be a deciding factor
in making faculty appointments.
In another portion of the conference, President Lyman
reiterated the statement by Provost John Schwartz that
prosecutions may result from Monday's disruption of the
Hoover Institute's conference entitled, "Iran: 25 Centuries
of Achievement." Fifteen to twenty students heckled
speakers at that conference which was protested by the
Iranian Students Association (ISA), until ISA members

were allowed to participate.
Lyman said the protestors may have violated the
University's anti-disruption policy, but that it is too early
to say for sure. While prosecution remains a possibility, he
added, the story is still being pieced together; thus, he said,
he would make no further comment.
Equal Opportunities
Turning to the issue of equal job opportunities for
women, Lyman said he agreed that women tend to get "less
permanent, less secure, less well-paid jobs." Stanford's
number of women faculty members is below the national
average for institutions of higher education; this figure is
misleading, however, explained Lyman, since the national
figure includes junior colleges and other public institutions
with a higher percentage of female faculty members. For
institutions of its type, Stanford is close to the norm, but,
added Lyman, "Even at that we don't shape up very well."
Earlier in the press conference, Lyman was asked about
the current impasse regarding the Stanford Judicial Council
(SJC) in which the student senate refuses to appoint a
selection committee to name students to the Council.
"There's no way to get clear of it if the ASSU mechanisms
are not willing to work," Lyman said. "The mechanism is
inoperative due to refusal of the student senate to make it
work."
Lyman added that "extraordinary" measures may be
required if the controversy is not resolved soon via normal
channels within the senate.
