# Palo Alto Police Chief Zurcher: Man In A Contradictory Position
## 
### DAVID THIEMANN 
. Palo Alto Police Chief James Zurcher
seems cast in contradictory roles. He
has committed himself to the
enforcement of city, county, and state
statutes, with force if necessary, yet
maintains that "the police department
can be used to resolve confrontation
situations" without rancor or violence.
The tall, thin, balding chief, one of
the defendants in the legal action filed
by the Daily as a result of last year's
police search of the newspaper offices,
came to Palo Alto after commanding
the police force in Sierra Madre, a small
town east of Pasadena.
Many Palo Alto officers observe that
"before, we had a figurehead, but now
we have a chief." Zurcher, unlike his
predecessor, William Hydia, has

assumed direct and complete control of
the department.
He has enforced standards for police
conduct, and, acting on complaints
from the public and from supervisory
personnel, suspended about ten officers
for various offenses and violations of
departmental regulations, especially
charges of verbal abuse.
Excesses Investigated
He also thoroughly investigates
allegations of police use of excessive
force, though no Palo Alto officers
have been found guilty of this type of
offense. Several officers resent the
chief's exacting standards and scrutiny,
and one suspended officer has resigned.
Palo Alto officials are now examining
a complaint by a girl who alleges that
while attending a Lytton Plaza concert
she was told by a police officer to go
home and put on a bra, and called a
"filthy bitch." The investigation into
this accusation may include a line-up of
all officers who worked the Lytton area
on the night in question, or a line-up of
all members of the department.
Police officers did not supervise
Plaza rock concerts during the summer
until August 28, when, despite an
apparent lack of police provocation,
radicals trashed windows in downtown
businesses, especially large banks and
real estate companies, causing an
estimated $25 ,000 damage.
Heavy Patrols
Since that weekend, officers have
maintained heavy patrols around the
Plaza, and strictly enforced a Palo Alto
ordinance requiring amplified music to
cease at 11:00 p.m.
Zurcher intends to keep officers
around the Plaza during weekend
concerts "as long as they are needed,"
arguing that their presence is required
because of minor incidents and
misdemeanor arrests at every concert
after August 28.
The police department recently
requested and received an increase in
their appropriation for overtime pay
from the city council, because of the
cost of the manpower used at the Plaza
concerts.
Zurcher has introduced a "team
policing" concept for normal patrol
activities. This technique established a
self-sufficient group of officers on each
shift, who work constantly with each
other. Each shift has officers with all
police skills, reducing the dependence
upon specialized branches, while
improving cooperation among officers.
Statistics Cited
The chief considers the innovation
successful, citing improved crime and
accident statistics, but also identifies

weaknesses in investigation and
follow-up procedures. These difficulties
may be repaired by a pending
departmental reorganization, due to be
announced in about a month, which
would create several divisions within
the department to improve
administrative coordination.
The reorganization will retain the
team policing idea, and will create new
positions for a captain and a lieutenant,
soon to be filled.
Another change involves recruitment
methods, which now concentrate upon
college graduates with liberal arts
degrees. The department searches for
men who are "people oriented, and
aware of people problems," according
to Zurcher. The new methods use
members of the city's Human Relations
Council and Youth Advisory Council
(including radicals and long-hairs) to
screen prospective officers and officers
considered for promotion.
"People" concerns are also reflected
in the department's training program,
which includes psychological testing,
role playing, and other devices to
school officers in situations they will
encounter on duty.
Surveillance Continues
Though it was recently called into
court as defendant in a civil suit filed
by attorney James Wolpman, on behalf
of 13 politically active Palo Alto
residents, the police department has
not drastically changed its intelligence
activities.
In a consent judgment, the
department agreed to refrain from
repressive activities and
harrassmentâ€”but it still uses
plainclothes officers, photographs, and
videotape machines in situations where
crimes may be committed. The police
have used cameras and videotape at
Plaza concerts after the August 28
damage.
According to Zurcher, the
department "still gathers and analyzes
information concerning criminal or
potentially criminal activities of every
nature."
Zurcher asserts that "peace officer
powers for Stanford officers are
essential," but he does not necessarily
support current plans to allow the
University administration to control its
own force, believing that an elected
official should be directly responsible
for police activities.
No Reciprocity
The chief, though he would respond
to a mutual aid call from the Sheriff's
office, announced that he would not
come onto campus at the
administration's request, because
Stanford officers could not provide
similar aid to Palo Alto men.
He does believe that the possibility
of contracting with Palo Alto for police
coverage on the Stanford campus is "an
alternative that should be explored."
In assessing the radical movement in
Palo Alto, Zurcher noted "a small
number of people, who engage in
confrontation tactics for a number of
reasons, are receiving a dwindling
amount of support for their cause."
Chief Zurcher feels that he has done
an effective job in Palo Alto, with a
community that "has a high level of
involvement, and an insatiable demand
for services of every kind."

administrative coordination.
The reorganization will retain the
team policing idea, and will create new

soon to be filled.
Another change involves recruitment
methods, which now concentrate upon
college graduates with liberal arts
degrees. The department searches for
men who are "people oriented, and
aware of people problems," according
to Zurcher. The new methods use
members of the city's Human Relations
Council and Youth Advisory Council
(including radicals and long-hairs) to
screen prospective officers and officers
considered for promotion.

Surveillance Continues
Though it was recently called into
court as defendant in a civil suit filed
by attorney James Wolpman, on behalf
of 13 politically active Palo Alto
residents, the police department has
not drastically changed its intelligence
activities.
In a consent judgment, the
department agreed to refrain from
repressive activities and
harrassmentâ€”but it still uses
plainclothes officers, photographs, and
videotape machines in situations where
crimes may be committed. The police
have used cameras and videotape at
Plaza concerts after the August 28
damage.
According to Zurcher, the
department "still gathers and analyzes
information concerning criminal or
potentially criminal activities of every
nature."
Zurcher asserts that "peace officer
powers for Stanford officers are
essential," but he does not necessarily
support current plans to allow the
University administration to control its
own force, believing that an elected
official should be directly responsible
for police activities.
No Reciprocity
The chief, though he would respond
to a mutual aid call from the Sheriff's
office, announced that he would not
come onto campus at the
administration's request, because
Stanford officers could not provide
similar aid to Palo Alto men.
He does believe that the possibility
of contracting with Palo Alto for police
coverage on the Stanford campus is "an
alternative that should be explored."
In assessing the radical movement in
Palo Alto, Zurcher noted "a small
number of people, who engage in
confrontation tactics for a number of
reasons, are receiving a dwindling
amount of support for their cause."
Chief Zurcher feels that he has done
an effective job in Palo Alto, with a
community that "has a high level of
involvement, and an insatiable demand
for services of every kind."

DON'T CALL ME CHIEF-Palo Alto police chief James Zurcher has been on the
job for eight months, and has had an interesting time of it. He faces questions of
enforcing laws with a minimum of violent confrontation.
. Palo Alto Police Chief James Zurcher
seems cast in contradictory roles. He
has committed himself to the
enforcement of city, county, and state
statutes, with force if necessary, yet
maintains that "the police department
can be used to resolve confrontation
situations" without rancor or violence.
The tall, thin, balding chief, one of
the defendants in the legal action filed
by the Daily as a result of last year's
police search of the newspaper offices,
came to Palo Alto after commanding
the police force in Sierra Madre, a small
town east of Pasadena.
Many Palo Alto officers observe that
"before, we had a figurehead, but now
we have a chief." Zurcher, unlike his
predecessor, William Hydia, has

assumed direct and complete control of
the department.
He has enforced standards for police
conduct, and, acting on complaints
from the public and from supervisory
personnel, suspended about ten officers
for various offenses and violations of
departmental regulations, especially
charges of verbal abuse.
Excesses Investigated
He also thoroughly investigates
allegations of police use of excessive
force, though no Palo Alto officers
have been found guilty of this type of
offense. Several officers resent the
chief's exacting standards and scrutiny,
and one suspended officer has resigned.
Palo Alto officials are now examining
a complaint by a girl who alleges that
while attending a Lytton Plaza concert
she was told by a police officer to go
home and put on a bra, and called a
"filthy bitch." The investigation into
this accusation may include a line-up of
all officers who worked the Lytton area
on the night in question, or a line-up of
all members of the department.
Police officers did not supervise
Plaza rock concerts during the summer
until August 28, when, despite an
apparent lack of police provocation,
radicals trashed windows in downtown
businesses, especially large banks and
real estate companies, causing an
estimated $25 ,000 damage.
Heavy Patrols
Since that weekend, officers have
maintained heavy patrols around the
Plaza, and strictly enforced a Palo Alto
ordinance requiring amplified music to
cease at 11:00 p.m.
Zurcher intends to keep officers
around the Plaza during weekend
concerts "as long as they are needed,"
arguing that their presence is required
because of minor incidents and
misdemeanor arrests at every concert
after August 28.
The police department recently
requested and received an increase in
their appropriation for overtime pay
from the city council, because of the
cost of the manpower used at the Plaza
concerts.
Zurcher has introduced a "team
policing" concept for normal patrol
activities. This technique established a
self-sufficient group of officers on each
shift, who work constantly with each
other. Each shift has officers with all
police skills, reducing the dependence
upon specialized branches, while
improving cooperation among officers.
Statistics Cited
The chief considers the innovation
successful, citing improved crime and
accident statistics, but also identifies

weaknesses in investigation and
follow-up procedures. These difficulties

statutes, with force if necessary, yet
maintains that "the police department
can be used to resolve confrontation
situations" without rancor or violence.
The tall, thin, balding chief, one of
the defendants in the legal action filed
by the Daily as a result of last year's
police search of the newspaper offices,
came to Palo Alto after commanding
the police force in Sierra Madre, a small
town east of Pasadena.
Many Palo Alto officers observe that
"before, we had a figurehead, but now
we have a chief." Zurcher, unlike his
predecessor, William Hydia, has

assumed direct and complete control of
the department.
He has enforced standards for police
conduct, and, acting on complaints
from the public and from supervisory
personnel, suspended about ten officers
for various offenses and violations of
departmental regulations, especially
charges of verbal abuse.
Excesses Investigated
He also thoroughly investigates
allegations of police use of excessive
force, though no Palo Alto officers
have been found guilty of this type of
offense. Several officers resent the
chief's exacting standards and scrutiny,
and one suspended officer has resigned.
Palo Alto officials are now examining
a complaint by a girl who alleges that
while attending a Lytton Plaza concert
she was told by a police officer to go
home and put on a bra, and called a
"filthy bitch." The investigation into
this accusation may include a line-up of
all officers who worked the Lytton area
on the night in question, or a line-up of
all members of the department.
Police officers did not supervise
Plaza rock concerts during the summer
until August 28, when, despite an
apparent lack of police provocation,
radicals trashed windows in downtown
businesses, especially large banks and
real estate companies, causing an
estimated $25 ,000 damage.
Heavy Patrols
Since that weekend, officers have
maintained heavy patrols around the
Plaza, and strictly enforced a Palo Alto
ordinance requiring amplified music to
cease at 11:00 p.m.
Zurcher intends to keep officers
around the Plaza during weekend
concerts "as long as they are needed,"
arguing that their presence is required
because of minor incidents and
misdemeanor arrests at every concert
after August 28.
The police department recently
requested and received an increase in
their appropriation for overtime pay
from the city council, because of the
cost of the manpower used at the Plaza
concerts.
Zurcher has introduced a "team
policing" concept for normal patrol
activities. This technique established a
self-sufficient group of officers on each
shift, who work constantly with each
other. Each shift has officers with all
police skills, reducing the dependence
upon specialized branches, while
improving cooperation among officers.
Statistics Cited
The chief considers the innovation
successful, citing improved crime and
accident statistics, but also identifies

weaknesses in investigation and
follow-up procedures. These difficulties
may be repaired by a pending
departmental reorganization, due to be
announced in about a month, which
would create several divisions within
the department to improve
administrative coordination.
The reorganization will retain the
team policing idea, and will create new
positions for a captain and a lieutenant,
soon to be filled.
Another change involves recruitment
methods, which now concentrate upon
college graduates with liberal arts
degrees. The department searches for
men who are "people oriented, and
aware of people problems," according
to Zurcher. The new methods use
members of the city's Human Relations
Council and Youth Advisory Council
(including radicals and long-hairs) to
screen prospective officers and officers
considered for promotion.
"People" concerns are also reflected
in the department's training program,
which includes psychological testing,
role playing, and other devices to
school officers in situations they will
encounter on duty.
Surveillance Continues
Though it was recently called into
court as defendant in a civil suit filed
by attorney James Wolpman, on behalf
of 13 politically active Palo Alto
residents, the police department has
not drastically changed its intelligence
activities.
In a consent judgment, the
department agreed to refrain from
repressive activities and
harrassmentâ€”but it still uses
plainclothes officers, photographs, and
videotape machines in situations where
crimes may be committed. The police
have used cameras and videotape at
Plaza concerts after the August 28
damage.
According to Zurcher, the
department "still gathers and analyzes
information concerning criminal or
potentially criminal activities of every
nature."
Zurcher asserts that "peace officer
powers for Stanford officers are
essential," but he does not necessarily
support current plans to allow the
University administration to control its
own force, believing that an elected
official should be directly responsible
for police activities.
No Reciprocity
The chief, though he would respond
to a mutual aid call from the Sheriff's
office, announced that he would not
come onto campus at the
administration's request, because
Stanford officers could not provide
similar aid to Palo Alto men.
He does believe that the possibility
of contracting with Palo Alto for police
coverage on the Stanford campus is "an
alternative that should be explored."
In assessing the radical movement in
Palo Alto, Zurcher noted "a small
number of people, who engage in
confrontation tactics for a number of
reasons, are receiving a dwindling
amount of support for their cause."
Chief Zurcher feels that he has done
an effective job in Palo Alto, with a
community that "has a high level of
involvement, and an insatiable demand
for services of every kind."
