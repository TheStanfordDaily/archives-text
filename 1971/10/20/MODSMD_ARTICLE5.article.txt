# How To Get Your 1-A
## 
### SUSAN SWARINGEN PETER HANAWALT 
Many men with lottery
numbers about 125 have asked
how they can drop their 11-S or
other deferment in order to
expose themselves to this year's
First Priority Selection Group.
They have also asked how safe
they would really be if they did
so.

his local board must reclassify him
and expose him to that year's
pool. A man who is exposed to
the 1971 lottery, and whose
number is not reached, will be
placed in the Second Priority
Selection Group for 1972. Short
of a general mobilization, men in
the Second Priority Group or
lower will never be drafted.
Any man who holds a 11-S,

stated that the uniform national
call provision of the new draft law
was currently in effect. This
means that all local boards in the
United States will order every
available and qualified I-A with a
lottery number of 125 or lower to
report for induction in the near
future. It also means that a board
may not issue induction orders to
any man in the First Priority
Group who has a lottery number
above 125, regardless of the size
of its available pool of I-A's.
Local Board Memorandum 55
was revised to establish new
procedures and priorities in
processing registrants. It states
that no man with a lottery
number above 125 may now be
called to take his preinduction
physical. A man may be ordered
to report for induction only if he
has taken the preinduction
physical and been mailed the DD
Form 62, Statement of
Acceptability, or if he has not
shown up at an ordered
preinduction physical but is
nonetheless presumed acceptable
by his local board.
