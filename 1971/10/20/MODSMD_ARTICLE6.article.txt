# ROUGH DRAFT
## 
### 
Men who will be 20 or older
during 1971 and who hold lottery
numbers of 1 26 or above will not
be drafted this year. This was
confirmed in two publications
from National Headquarters,
Selective Service System: a press
release dated October 5, 1971 and
a Local Board Memorandum
dated October 1.
A provision of the new draft
law allows a man to request that
his deferment be dropped. As long
as that request is postmarked
before midnight of December 31,

11-A, or 111-A deferment can
expose himself to this year's pool
by writing a letter to his local
board in which he requests that
his current deferment be dropped,
and that he be reclassified I-A (or
1-0 or I-A-O). It's a good idea to
write to the board, regardless of
whether or not you turned in the
Selective Service cards at
registration time. On January 1,
1972 you will then be placed in
the Second Priority Group, even
though you will continue to be
classified I-A.
Medical students, regardless of
lottery number, are still subject to
the separate "doctor's draft" and
