## ISAUS Statement

Iranian student association

Concerning the recent bombing that
took place on Thursday, Oct. 14, 1971 at
the Iranian Consulate located on 34 00
Washington St., San Francisco, the Iranian
Student Association in the US (ISAUS)
hereby wishes to make its position known
on this matter. The ISAUS vehemently
denies any connection with the recent
bombing; it has never advocated nor
participated in such acts and will not do so
in the future.
The Council General of Iran, Parviz
Adle, "... has said he was positive the
bombing was the work of student radicals
who have demonstrated against the
counsulate the past two years. ' (San
Francisco Chronicle, Oct. 17, 1971.) The
ISAUS has, in the past years organized
demonstrations in front of the Iranian
Consulate to express opposition to the
Shah's dictatorial regime in Iran.
The present accusation of the Council
General (who is a well known SAVAK
agent) is part of a world wide repressive
policy of the Shah's regime against the
Confederation of the Iranian Students

(CIS.NU the only democratic organization
of the Iranian Students abroad) is an effort
to wipe out any opposition to its
suppressive dictatorial rule. In the past year
alone, it has rendered illegal this
democratic and lawful organization and has
subjected its members to 3-10 (three to
ten) years in jail on their return home. The
regime has also sentenced some members
of the Confederation to 3-15 years of
prison in Iran. It also refuses to extend the
passports of the 41.
The ISAUS is making all necessary
preparations to take legal actions against
incriminating statements. We demand
public retraction of all such statements; in
particular we challenge the Council General
of Iran to a public debate with the
presence of the press at his earliest
convenience. •
We hereby ask all democratic and
progressive people to support us in
exposing this plot of the Council General
geared at destroying our student
organization.
