Editor, THE DAILY:
Several correspondents have
claimed that Professor Franklin is
being penalized for his political
views or for standing up for his
belief";. Such statements indicate
that these persons, and possibly
others, have momentarily lost
sight of something basic and
important.
Consider case 1. X is to speak
at a public meeting (which no one
is required to attend and at which
no one who attends is required to

remain). Y attends and
participates in a successful effort
to prevent X from speaking. A
number of persons present wished
X to speak and are deprived of the
opportunity to hear him. Y's
action violates an applicable rule,
and Z, the responsible official,
initiates the appropriate
procedure to penalize Y for the
violation.
Anyone who says that
penalizing Y in this situation is
suppression of thought or speech
has lost his moorings. It makes no
difference whether X is a hawk
and Y an exponent of the latest
version of radical chic or vice
versa. Change the ideologies of X
and Y in any way you see fit, it

still is neither thought repression
nor suppression of free speech to
penalize Y for his action. The
repressive, suppressive, coercive
act has been committed by Y, not
by Z.
Consider case 2. Professor Y
addresses a group of people,
encouraging them to commit
repressive and violent acts against
the University that employs him.
Some of those addressed then
commit such acts. Y's action
violates an applicable University
rule, and Z, the responsible
official of the University, initiates
the appropriate procedure to

penalize Y for the violation by
terminating his employment.
Unless one is prepared to
extend the notion of protected
speech to incitement to violence
and repression, it is wildly
eccentric to call Z's action in this
case repressive. On the contrary, it
is Y who is the represser.
It is healthy and appropriate
that Y have the opportunity to
show that he did not commit such
acts and to argue that the penalty
should not apply even if he did
commit them. That process is now
going on for Professor Franklin.
But if the finding should be that
he did commit them, and if the

penalty is found to be applicable,
then it should be applied.
Otherwise a permanent chilling
effect will be felt on free speech,
free thought, and free inquiry at
Stanford.
If I thought freedom of
expression or belief were at issue
in this case I would leap to
Professor Franklin's defense,
because I have this old-fashioned
liberal hang-up about free speech.
But as I see it, the position is just
the reverse: Professor Franklin (if
the facts are as alleged) has
endangered free speech.

penalize Y for the violation by
terminating his employment.
Unless one is prepared to
extend the notion of protected
speech to incitement to violence
and repression, it is wildly
eccentric to call Z's action in this
case repressive. On the contrary, it
is Y who is the represser.
It is healthy and appropriate
that Y have the opportunity to
show that he did not commit such
acts and to argue that the penalty
should not apply even if he did
commit them. That process is now
going on for Professor Franklin.
But if the finding should be that
he did commit them, and if the

penalty is found to be applicable,
then it should be applied.
Otherwise a permanent chilling
effect will be felt on free speech,
free thought, and free inquiry at
Stanford.
If I thought freedom of
expression or belief were at issue
in this case I would leap to
Professor Franklin's defense,
because I have this old-fashioned
liberal hang-up about free speech.
But as I see it, the position is just
the reverse: Professor Franklin (if
the facts are as alleged) has
endangered free speech.
J. H. Merryman,

Editor, THE DAILY:
Several correspondents have
claimed that Professor Franklin is
being penalized for his political
views or for standing up for his
belief";. Such statements indicate
that these persons, and possibly
others, have momentarily lost
sight of something basic and
important.
Consider case 1. X is to speak
at a public meeting (which no one
is required to attend and at which
no one who attends is required to

remain). Y attends and
participates in a successful effort
to prevent X from speaking. A
number of persons present wished
X to speak and are deprived of the
opportunity to hear him. Y's
action violates an applicable rule,
and Z, the responsible official,
initiates the appropriate
procedure to penalize Y for the
violation.
Anyone who says that
penalizing Y in this situation is
suppression of thought or speech
has lost his moorings. It makes no
difference whether X is a hawk
and Y an exponent of the latest
version of radical chic or vice
versa. Change the ideologies of X
and Y in any way you see fit, it

still is neither thought repression
nor suppression of free speech to
penalize Y for his action. The
repressive, suppressive, coercive
act has been committed by Y, not
by Z.
Consider case 2. Professor Y
addresses a group of people,
encouraging them to commit
repressive and violent acts against
the University that employs him.
Some of those addressed then
commit such acts. Y's action
violates an applicable University
rule, and Z, the responsible
official of the University, initiates
the appropriate procedure to

penalize Y for the violation by
terminating his employment.
Unless one is prepared to
extend the notion of protected
speech to incitement to violence
and repression, it is wildly
eccentric to call Z's action in this
