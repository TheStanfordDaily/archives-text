# Sit-in Defense Loses Bid For Plea Changes
## 
### DAVE THIEMANN 
Seventeen defendants in a
misdemeanor court case stemming from
the April 8-9 hospital sit-in and
subsequent violence failed yesterday
afternoon in an attempt to retain
influence upon the sentence imposed in
a related felony trial, also involving
charges from the hospital sit-in.
The 17 had hoped to reserve the
right to withdraw their conditional
guilty pleas at a later date. Their
original pleas were contingent upon
"final acceptance of pleas" in the
felony case.
Each of the 17 is now accused of
two misdemeanors, reduced from nine
original misdemeanor charges, in
exchange for guilty pleas, during
negotiations with the District
Attorney's office.
At a Santa Clara County Superior
Court hearing last week in San Jose, the
4 felony defendants pleaded no contest
to an alternate felony/misdemeanor
count of battery upon an officer,
reduced (by agreement with the
District Attorney) from two earlier
felony charges, assault with a deadly
weapon and possession of an illegal
weapon. The punishment for the
battery charge is less than that for the
two original accusations.
In an alternate felony/misdemeanor
charge, the judge, Donald Scott,

decides whether the offense should be
punished as a felony or a misdemeanor.
Scott apparently indicated in his
chambers to defense lawyers that, in his
present state of mind, he would not
sentence the defendants to state prison,
but would instead consider the offense
a misdemeanor, with a maximum $500
fine and/or six months in the county
jail.
However, the judge did not make
this statement on the record, and
qualified it to an extent which worried
the attorneys, who feared that he
would change his decision, and impose
felony sentences.
For this reason, the misdemeanor
defendants had hoped to retain the
right to change their pleas (and force
the case to a jury trial), and in this way
induce Scott to hand down
misdemeanor penalties.
Municipal Court Judge Sidney
Feinberg yesterday prevented the
defendants from using this device, by
ruling that the conditions previously
agreed upon had been met in San Jose,
and that the defendants could only
attempt to withdraw at yesterday's
hearing.
During two meetings in his
chambers, the judge served notice to
defense attorneys that he would not
continue the case without finalizing the

Wilbur (above) is one of several campus fires that remain unsolved by police.
pleas. Craig Brown, representing the
District Attorney's office, also
apparently threatened to request a
felony penalty in the San Jose trial if
the guilty pleas were changed.
The defendants, after conferring
twice with their formidable array of
lawyers on the North County
Courthouse steps, voted to support
Devera Satisky in a motion to withdraw
her plea, in an attempt to establish
precedent for other, later motions to
withdraw.
Judge Feinberg, however, forced the
group to reconsider when, visibly
angry, he informed the attorneys that,
should any one defendent change his or
her plea, he would refuse to accept all
of the pleas, and send the case to trial
on all of the nine original charges,
rather than the two negotiated between
the lawyers and the district attorney's
office.
During a court recess, the group
agreed that Satisky should retract her
motion, and in this way sacrifice this
chance to force a jury trial. The judge
also warned that, should the defendants
move to withdraw or change their pleas
at the next hearing, he would rule
against the motions.Attorneys for the
17 obtained a continuance until late
November when groups of five and six
will be sentenced.

withdraw.
Judge Feinberg, however, forced the
group to reconsider when, visibly
angry, he informed the attorneys that,
should any one defendent change his or
her plea, he would refuse to accept all
of the pleas, and send the case to trial
on all of the nine original charges,
rather than the two negotiated between
the lawyers and the district attorney's
office.
During a court recess, the group
agreed that Satisky should retract her
motion, and in this way sacrifice this
chance to force a jury trial. The judge
also warned that, should the defendants
move to withdraw or change their pleas
at the next hearing, he would rule
against the motions.Attorneys for the
17 obtained a continuance until late
November when groups of five and six
will be sentenced.
Seventeen defendants in a
misdemeanor court case stemming from
the April 8-9 hospital sit-in and
subsequent violence failed yesterday
afternoon in an attempt to retain
influence upon the sentence imposed in
a related felony trial, also involving
charges from the hospital sit-in.
The 17 had hoped to reserve the
right to withdraw their conditional
guilty pleas at a later date. Their
original pleas were contingent upon
"final acceptance of pleas" in the
felony case.
Each of the 17 is now accused of
two misdemeanors, reduced from nine
original misdemeanor charges, in
exchange for guilty pleas, during
negotiations with the District
Attorney's office.
At a Santa Clara County Superior
Court hearing last week in San Jose, the
4 felony defendants pleaded no contest
to an alternate felony/misdemeanor
count of battery upon an officer,
reduced (by agreement with the
District Attorney) from two earlier
felony charges, assault with a deadly
weapon and possession of an illegal
weapon. The punishment for the
battery charge is less than that for the
two original accusations.
In an alternate felony/misdemeanor
charge, the judge, Donald Scott,

decides whether the offense should be
punished as a felony or a misdemeanor.
Scott apparently indicated in his
chambers to defense lawyers that, in his
present state of mind, he would not
sentence the defendants to state prison,
but would instead consider the offense
a misdemeanor, with a maximum $500
fine and/or six months in the county
jail.
However, the judge did not make
this statement on the record, and
qualified it to an extent which worried
the attorneys, who feared that he
would change his decision, and impose
felony sentences.
For this reason, the misdemeanor
defendants had hoped to retain the
right to change their pleas (and force
the case to a jury trial), and in this way
induce Scott to hand down
misdemeanor penalties.
Municipal Court Judge Sidney
Feinberg yesterday prevented the
defendants from using this device, by
ruling that the conditions previously
agreed upon had been met in San Jose,
and that the defendants could only
attempt to withdraw at yesterday's
hearing.
During two meetings in his
chambers, the judge served notice to
defense attorneys that he would not
continue the case without finalizing the

pleas. Craig Brown, representing the
District Attorney's office, also
apparently threatened to request a
felony penalty in the San Jose trial if
the guilty pleas were changed.
The defendants, after conferring
twice with their formidable array of
lawyers on the North County
Courthouse steps, voted to support
Devera Satisky in a motion to withdraw
her plea, in an attempt to establish
precedent for other, later motions to
withdraw.
