Editor, THE DAILY:
If I may take up a little more
of your space, I would like to
respond briefly to Rachelle
Marshall's retort to my letter in
the Daily. The most interesting
part of her letter was that in
drawing a more exact parallel
between the Nazis and Henry
Cabot Lodge she was able to
justify, to her own satisfaction, at
least, interference with freedom
of speech without relying at all

upon the Nuremberg principles.
That was the precise point of my
letter: Nuremberg is irrelevant to
the question of freedom of
speech, both for those who
believe in the principle and for
those who do not.
