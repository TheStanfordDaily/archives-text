## Why Such Mediocrity? 
### 
Why is it, that 90% of the
articles in the Daily dealing with
women's liberation are mediocre?
If there is at all a need to make
both men and women aware of
the inequities women face
everyday, so that they can work
together to find solutions, it
certainly merits a higher standard
of response than the Daily has
seen fit to accord it.
Perhaps the grossest example
of this mediocrity was the
Women's Forum in the October
14's issue, that did nothing to
push forward the idea of
liberation and could be considered
almost a detriment to that ideal,
in its insipidity. It was painfully
obvious that all the material for
the page was printed as submitted
without a thought of editing or
re-writing.
First of all, the story on the
Child Care Center was labeled as
commentary. If it was to be a
commentary, it could have
explained just how Stanford isn't
meeting the needs of working
women, or how the center is
changing the present attitude
toward working women. For
people that don't know the center
exists or the reasons for its
existence, the story was of great
interest. However, to label it as
commentary with a headline
saying there was a lack of funding
seems irrelevant to the
information given. As it was, the
story was more a feature than a
commentary, and given that the
resolution of inequity is at stake,

commentary is far more essential
than the luxury of features.
Then there was Emma Price's
article on frequently asked
questions concerning women's
liberation. If this was meant to be
humor, it wasn't successful; nor
did it succeed as a serious piece.
Certainly there have been
repetitive questions concerning
women's liberation, but why
should the space have been taken
up to answer them again. There
are, perhaps, more thought
provoking ones, as:
1. What various centers are
aiding women in finding
challenging jobs and equal pay
scales?
2. What anti-sexist bills are
before state and national
congresses, how will they affect
women, and what lobbies are
working for their passage?
3. What is being done to
change the stereotypical picture
of women in magazines,
newspapers and booksâ€”especially
children's books?
Questions such as these would
have had a far greater impact.
The leaky faucet article could

Patricia mcknight

have been an excellent humor
piece, if the author had taken the
time to look up old Daily's for the
Self-defense-how-to articles by
Marlaine Lookheed. As it stands,
it is an informative article, but so
what? Perhaps the page editor
should have considered asking
Marlaine Lookheed to contribute
the how-to section, rather than
using the leaky faucet story, or
perhaps a little re-writing would
have worked as well.
Finally, the Gay Liberation
article was the most successful on
the entire page, and not merely by
comparison. It was both thought
provoking and articulate. It
captured the essence of what
liberation is all about, that it
means an awareness, instead of a
change of sexual roles. Certainly
sex roles play a part but they
aren't the primary aspect of
liberation.
Becoming aware is half the
battle for men and women alike.
Since awareness is stimulated by
intelligent thought, it is
unfortunate the Daily's Women's
Forum has presented only
mediocrity.
