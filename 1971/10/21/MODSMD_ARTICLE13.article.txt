# Berkeley Calendar
## What To See, What To Hear 
### TERRIE McDONALD 
What follows is a calendar of cultural events
taking place at the U.C. Berkeley (cal.) campus
this fallâ€”a cut-out-and-tape-to-your-mirror
companion to the Stanford roster printed in last
week's Daily.
You'll note some programming duplication on
the cross-town campuses, but thankfully there's
not enough to endanger variety. Example:
Devotees who miss the Erick Hawkins Dance
Company in Stanford's Mem Aud on November
4-5 may see the renowned choreographer and his
troupe in Cal's Zellerbach Auditorium on Tuesday
and Wednesday, November 9-10.
The Early Music Quartet, at S.U. on November
12 will perform in Berkeley's Hertz Hall Sunday,
November 14. However, they will present a
different medieval composition at each
engagement.
The New York Pro Musica, offering "The Play
of Daniel" in Memorial Church on December 7,
will perform the same piece in Zellerbach
Wednesday through Sunday, December 8-12. In
addition, Pro Musica will appear in another
twelfth-century music-drama, "The Play of
Herod," in Zellerbach Saturday and Sunday,
December 11-12.
The Black Light Theatre of Prague, the
celebrated Czech mime company, will appear in
Zellerbach on Friday and Saturday, October
22-23. Their approach to the art of pantomime is
distinguished by its presentation through
multimedia theater. The artists and luminous
props are highlighted on a completely darkened
stage.
Marcel Marceau, perhaps the world's best
known mime, will be in Zellerbach on Thursday,
December 2.
An attraction that will perhaps appeal to
members of a different audience than those
usually motivated to cross the Bay for a 'cultural'
event is Baroness Jane Van Lawick-Goodall's
illustrated lecture on family relationships among
chimpanzees. The Baroness, familiar to Human
Biology 2B students at Stanford and readers of
National Geographic, will present "In the Shadow
of Man," a slide lecture focusing on relationships
among the chimpanzees which are similar to those
of man on Friday, November 5, in Zellerbach.
On the following day, also in Zellerbach, The
Committee of Arts and Lectures at Cal offers The
Classical Khmer Ballet of Cambodia in a program
of religious and ritual interpretations.
The scope of Cal's Dance entertainment is
indicated by its internationality. Chorica, a dance
theater company, will present excerpts from
ancient Greek dramas in their programs on Sunday
and Monday, November 14-15. Within the week,
on Thursday through Sunday, November 18-21,
the French Ballet of the 2 0 th Century brings its
combination of song, recitation, mime, music and
dance to the Zellerbach stage.
The final dance production of fall quarter will
be the rock opera "Tommy," performed by Les
Grands Ballets Canadiens. The French-Canadian
troupe will use The Who's original sound and
multimedia projections in their interpretation. The
week-long engagement, from Tuesday, November

23, through Monday, November 29, will include a
short work, "Hip and Straight," choreographed by
the same man who staged this full-length dance
version of "Tommy." All performances will be in
Zellerbach.
The Berkeley Department of Dramatic Art
presents Eugene O'Neill's "A Touch of the Poet"
in Zellerbach Hall on November 11-13 and 17-20.
Following on December 2 is "Cyrano de
Bergerac," by Edmond Rostand. The romantic
comedy will be performed in the Zellerbach Hall
Playhouse through the 4th and also December
8-11.
The fourth concert in the Hertz Hall series will
be Vienna's Concentus Musicus performing
polyphonic music written before 1800. Playing
original instruments, the ensemble will present
French baroque music on Wednesday, October 27
and English baroque music at the Friday, October
29, concert.
The Festival Winds, a group of virtuoso wind
players, will perform in Hertz on Wednesday,
November 3. Later that week, on Friday,
November 5, pianist David Bar-Illan will play a
program including Liszt, Chopin and Soler. The
following week, on Monday, November 8, the
Berkeley Contemporary Chamber Players will
present their musical repertoire in Hertz.
The Fine Arts Quartet makes its seventeenth
appearance in Hertz Hall on Friday, November 19.
On Monday, November 29, the New Amsterdam
Ensemble will make their Bay Area premiere as the
final concert attraction of the series.
In Zellerbach Auditorium on Saturday,
November 13, Le Testament, Ezra Pound's opera,
with its epic poem text by Francois Villon, will be
staged in a joint effort by several Bay Area
organizations.
Gisela May, singing a program of Brecht songs
in "An Evening With Brecht: These Forty Years,
will appear in Zellerbach Auditorium on Tuesday,
November 16.
The Oakland Symphony Orchestra will present
works by Mahler, Cowell and Brahms on
Wednesday, November 17, in Zellerbach
Auditorium.
The University Department of Music at
Berkeley presents an evening of German baroque
music by The Repertory Chorus in Hertz Hall on
Sunday, November 7. The Chamber Band will play
in Hertz on Friday, November 12, and the
University Orchestra will present a program, to be
announced, Sunday and Monday, November
21-22.
The University Chorus will offer a program of
Mozart, Brahms and Stravinsky, Sunday and
Monday, December 5-6, also in Hertz Hall.
With the exception of the rock opera
"Tommy," all evening performances on the
Berkeley campus will be at 8 p.m. Matinees are at
2 p.m.
Space limitations prohibit a full description
here of coming events, but those who wish to keep
a spot-check on what's happening at Berkeley
