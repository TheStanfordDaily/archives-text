# 'Bless The Beasts'
## 6000 Russians Aren't Wrong 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Stanley Kramer has been involved in a lot of controversies in his
career. His latest film, "Bless the Beasts and Children," is already
strongly loved by some and vehemently hated by others.
The film has been banned by a censor at Brigham Young University
who said it was filled with "garbage"; it has been given a standing
ovation by 6000 people at the Moscow Film Festival in July; and it
has been accused of "incipient by the American Rifle
Association. After seeing the movie, I have to go along with the
Russian's praise for it.
Kramer has adapted Glendon Swarthout's novel into a film of
weighty drama and rich compassion. Centering a film around six
youngsters is a risky venture, but the producer-director of such films

as "Judgement at Nuremberg" and "On The Beach, has molded the
talented teen-age actors into a highly-effective group.
'We'll Send You A Cowboy"
The film is about six well-to-do, but maladjusted, youngsters, who
are sent by their parents to the Box Canyon Boys Camp, whose motto
is "Send us a boy—We'll send you a cowboy." Two of the six are
brothers, but other than that, they are all strangers until they meet at
the camp and share a cabin together.
They are the least proficient group in camp competitions and are
subject to much harassment, including that of winning the
"Bedwetter's Award," a white chamber pot.
On one of their field trips, the six are taken to a state-sanctioned
buffalo shoot, in which hunters thin out a penned-in buffalo herd.
The boys are completely repulsed by the killing and they decide to
try and save the rest of the herd. When their counselor is away, they
make an incredible crusade back to the hunt grounds. They release
and save the buffalo, but the film still ends in tragedy.
Message To The People
"Bless the Beasts .. is undeniably a message movie. But many
different themes will be read into it. Apparently the Russians saw an
indictment of Kent State and My Lai in the film. Others say it is a
film of the new ecological wave, or an appeal for gun control.
All these meanings are plausible. But the film seems to go deeper
than most of these explanations. Comments by the book's author and
a famous Russian poet merit repeating.
Swarthout, who took out ads in trade journals to praise the film,
has said that his tale has two themes: "That all living things are kin;
and that by freeing others, we free ourselves." After seeing the film in
Moscow, Yevgeny Yevtushenko wrote to Kramer and said, "Your film
teaches all of us kindness and the humanity inside humanity."
More Lovin'
These comments seem to more completely explain the film. For
me, this message was very need a little more love and less
hate and guns and killing.
Technically, the film reflects Kramer's years of experience. The
photographic effects are very good, especially ones which show the
youth's flashbacks to earlier experiences in their lives.
The acting of the boys is remarkable. Barry Robins as Cotton, the
"father" of the group and a marine's son, does a fine job most of the
time. At times, he strains a bit ana seems unnatural, but for playing a
lead role in his screen debut, Robins does an outstanding job.
Miles Chapin is hilarious as the chubby, comedian's son, Shecker.
His impersonations of such varied people as Humphrey Bogart, John
Wayne and his lather (played by Jesse White) are very good for an
actor still in high school. Darel Glaser is quite good as the sad and very
lonely "mother's boy," Goodenow. David Ketchum is believable as a
typical camp counselor, but most of the adult performances are
overshadowed by those of the kids.
There are a few flaws in the script. One cannot realistically believe
that six kids, all 15 or younger and in camp T-shirts, could steal a
beat-up, old exterminator's truck and drive it as far as they do in the
movie.
But other than that and a few other slips into unreality, the film is
outstanding. One would only hope that most of those who see the
film will get more out of it than those spokesmen for Brigham Young
and the American Rifle Association did.
