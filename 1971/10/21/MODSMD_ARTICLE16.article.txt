Nobel Prize To Brandt
OSLO, Norway — The 1971 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded
Wednesday to Willy Brandt with a tribute to the German
chancellor's efforts to reconcile old enemies of East and
West Europe.
Brandt, 57, became the first head of government in 50
years to win the award. He was the unanimous choice of
the five-man Nobel Prize committee of Norway's
parliament for achieving "eminent results in creating
preconditions for peace in Europe."
Speaking with emotion, Brandt told his own parliament
in Bonn: "This is a high honor and a decoration that carries
with it great duties. I will do everything in my power to be
worthy of it. I will accept the Peace Prize on Dec. 10 in
fellowship with all, wherever they may be, who wish to free
the world from the threat of war and build a peaceful
Europe."

China Debate Continues
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. - The Soviet Union Wednesday
urged that Red China be seated in the United Nations and
said Peking's opponents were fighting a rearguard action to
disguise their retreat.
Joining France and other Peking supporters in the third
day of the U.N. General Assembly's China debate, Soviet
Ambassador Jacob A. Malik called for the expulsion of
Nationalist China and the seating of the mainland
government as the only solution to the 2 2-year-old
controversy over Chinese representation.
Without mentioning the United States directly Malik
denounced those he contended tried to frighten members
of the United Nations by suggesting they too might be
expelled if they permitted expulsion of the Taiwan
delegation.
Cambodia Operations Opens
SAIGON — South Vietnamese forces launched a 2,500-man
pursuit operation Wednesday in eastern Cambodia, where
some North Vietnamese troops have been reported
withdrawing from their four-week campaign.
Field accounts said four government ranger battalions
and an armored cavalry battalion swept through an area
north of the 3+-mile road from the rubber town of Krek to
battered Fire Base Alpha. They found only four large
empty bunkers, the accounts said.

preconditions for peace in Europe."

in Bonn: "This is a high honor and a decoration that carries
with it great duties. I will do everything in my power to be
worthy of it. I will accept the Peace Prize on Dec. 10 in
fellowship with all, wherever they may be, who wish to free
the world from the threat of war and build a peaceful
Europe."

China Debate Continues
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. - The Soviet Union Wednesday
urged that Red China be seated in the United Nations and
said Peking's opponents were fighting a rearguard action to
disguise their retreat.
Joining France and other Peking supporters in the third
day of the U.N. General Assembly's China debate, Soviet
Ambassador Jacob A. Malik called for the expulsion of
Nationalist China and the seating of the mainland
government as the only solution to the 2 2-year-old
controversy over Chinese representation.
Without mentioning the United States directly Malik
denounced those he contended tried to frighten members
of the United Nations by suggesting they too might be
expelled if they permitted expulsion of the Taiwan
delegation.
Cambodia Operations Opens
SAIGON — South Vietnamese forces launched a 2,500-man
pursuit operation Wednesday in eastern Cambodia, where
some North Vietnamese troops have been reported
withdrawing from their four-week campaign.
