# Satisky Firing Protest
## 
### 
Provost William Miller has sustained
the dismissal of Devera Satisky, a law
school secretary fired for her alleged
participation in the April 9 Stanford
Hospital sit-in.
Yesterday, Satisky led a group of
about 20 of her supporters through the
Law School, pointing out offices of
faculty members specializing in such
fields as corporate tax law and oil and
gas practice.
Earlier, Satisky and several other
speakers discussed her case before a

small crowd on the Lav* School steps.
Bob Griffin, after outlining the history
of labor relations at Stanford, told the
group, "we have to start employing
methods of people's war."
Satisky repeated her contention that
she was fired because "all the time I
worked at Stanford 1 fought repression
and imperialism." She predicted that
there would be similar firings in the
future, and said that "we must do
something right now to stop
repression."
