# Senate Elections
## 
### 
ASSU Senate elections will be held
today and tomorrow. Students will also
vote on the Minority Affairs
Commission and the Children's Center
of Stanford Community fee assessment
referendums.
As a result of the lack of graduate
school candidates, only 30 of the 40
available Senate positions will be filled.
Despite these vacancies, Election
Commissioner, Alice Furumoto
rejected all of the 5 to 10 graduate
applications, which were submitted to
her several days after the Friday
petition deadline.
Students may vote at any of the
following places: the Medical School
lounge, the Computation Center, the

Law School lounge, the Business
School lounge, the Physics tank, the
engineering corner of the quad and the
post office.
Each student may vote for only
those candidates in his constituency
and must present a current student
body card.
Each voter will be asked to rank the
candidates according to his preference.
Candidates totaling the highest score,
on the basis of voter preference and the
number of votes received, are awarded
the Senate positions.
The outcome of the referendums
will be known early next week, but the
Senate returns will not be ready until
several days later.
