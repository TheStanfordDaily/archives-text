# Overseas Program Administrators Claim Problems Not So Serious
## 
### TONY BOLLEN 
Stanford's overseas campus program
is doing very well in spite of a rash of
criticisms and gloomy predictions,
according to program administrators.
Attendance remains high at a
majority of campuses, and some
academic programs are undergoing
revision to make them better suited to
the environments in which they are
taught. In addition, there is the
possibility that increased student
feedback will eliminate more potential
problem areas.
The attendance issue, the officials
feel, has been particularly overblown.
Corb Smith, one of two assistant
directors of the program, emphasizes
that initial applications remain high,
but that some students drop out after
they are accepted. This is especially
true of the currently below-capacity
group at the Italian campus in
Florence, a campus which usually has
no attendance problem.
Even the "problem campus,"
Austria, is "doing surprisingly well,"
adds program director Dr. Robert A.
Walker, and is not losing money.
Austria is the only campus with
chronically low attendance, a condition
for which the facility's urban location
in downtown Vienna is generally
blamed. (The campus was moved from
a more rural setting in 1967.) But too
many of the program's critics apply
Austria's problems to the entire
program, Administrators insist that
Austria's difficult situation is pretty
much unique.
Austria's attendance drought may be
unique, but minor academic
controversy affects all five campuses.
Students who do go overseas often find
that course offerings don't fit the

campus locality as well as they should,
but, Dr. Walker points out, this
condition is changing.
Dr. Walker in particular feels the
complaints against the overseas
academic program are "grossly
exaggerated." He states, "a lot of our
happy-go-lucky critics don't take the
time to find out what the hell we're
teaching."
Mrs. Allen agrees that much
publicity has been negative, and that,
favorable reactions to the program are
usually unheard. "The ones who don't
like it," she complains, "get it
publicized."
Perhaps the most promising
approach, Assistant Director Smith
suggests, involves focusing on the
differences between the five campuses
overseas. Smith says he feels the five
campuses have been too long
considered as one unit, and that much
more emphasis on varied environments
is needed—Vienna as an urban cultural
and political center close to Eastern
Europe, Beutelsbach as a small-town
rural area, and so on. This could make
campuses appealing to more people for
different reasons.
At least one project undertaken at
all campuses, a program of contact with
foreign nationals, is largely hampered
by students, the officials say. "One of
the real frustrations we faced in Italy,"
says Smith, a former Resident Assistant
in Florence, . . was an
understandable lack of student
initiative or willingness to give up some
things in order to spend time with a
family." This factor reflects a
widely-held student attitude toward the
overseas experience—the importance
placed on freedom to travel on
weekends and over vacations—and all

three administrators feel that
people-to-people contacts within local
communities suffer because of the urge
to get away.
Many family-oriented programs are
attempted, Mrs. Allen explains, but
"often, I'm sorry to say, the students
don't follow through."
The importance of travel overseas
was pointed out in a survey conducted
by Dr. Nathan Maccoby's
Communications 170 class four years
ago, when 730 students who had been
overseas were asked to choose the
highlights of the six-month experience.
The top three activities chosen were
weekend travel, field trips, and travel at
three-week break. No new studies have
been undertaken, but one can expect
the responses would be about the same.
The fact that no major surveys have
been conducted for four years indicates
a major shortcoming: a low level of
student feedback on a formal basis.
Currently the major student input
comes through committees and
subcommittees, as well as an occasional
independent complaint or suggestion.
The feedback issue notwithstanding,
there are no new difficulties, says Dr.
Walker; "the biggest problem we've
got," he states, "is solving the problems
already there." Many unknown factors,
such as tight money and lower
trans-Atlantic air fares, may affect
attendance, but there is no trend
toward smaller enrollments seen at this
time. Above all, say the officials, the
program is trying to adapt to students'
changing needs.
In such a time, many things are
unclear. "While I think there's a sense
of movement," says Corb Smith, "I'm
not really sure what direction it's
taking."
