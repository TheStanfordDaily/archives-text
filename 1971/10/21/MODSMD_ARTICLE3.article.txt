# Remain Unsolved
## Arsons, Bombings Still Mystery 
### ROBERT VINING 
From winter of 1968 through the
past summer, the Stanford campus has
been the scene of two bombings, at
least six arsons, and one shooting. To
date no one has been charged in
connection with the crimes, and the
statute of limitations, limiting the time
within which charges must be brought
for certain crimes, has expired for two
of the arsons.
The incidents:
Feb. 19, 1968 — Arson destroyed
the Navy ROTC annex. The old,
isolated building was located in a field

beside Galvez Street not far from the
Stanford stadium.
July 5, 1968 — Arson in the
President's Office Building in the Quad
caused an estimated $100,000 in
damage. Since state law fixes the
statute of limitations at three years for
felony arsons, no one can be arrested or
prosecuted now for the 1968 arsons.
April 24, 1970 — Private offices of
ten scholars were destroyed by arson at
the Center for Advanced Study in the
Behavioral Sciences. Estimated building
damage was $50,000 to $100,000.
Feb. 6, 1971 — Arson occurred at

the ROTC-Athletic Department
Building. Damage was estimated at less
than $1,000.
Feb. 10, 1971 — History Professor
Phil Dawson's teenage son was shot in
the thigh while talking with members
of the Free Campus Movement, a
conservative political organization, near
the FCM headquarters. The shooting
was one of the incidents of nighttime
violence following a rally to discuss
escalation of the Indochina War in
Laos.
April 23,1971 —A bomb exploded
in the attic of the President's Office
Building. A campus patrolman walking
by narrowly escaped injury. Damage
was estimated at $25,000.
April 26, 1 971 — Arson gutted the
Junipero House lounge, where the
Black Student Union often met, in
Wilbur Hall. Estimated damage was
between $50,000 ands7s,ooo .
July 12, 1971 — A pipe bomb
exploded outside the Coronado Drive
home of Robert Nelson, then director
of personnel and employee relations.
The month before, Nelson had
announced that five Stanford
employees were fired for "unacceptable
behavior" at an April 9 th Stanford
Hospital sit-in.
July 24, 1971 — Arson resulted in
an estimated $100 in damage at the
Free Market building at 5 47 Lane B,
near the Post Office. The building
housed the Free Campus Movement
during the regular academic year.
Significant Developments
Santa Clara County Undersheriff
Tom Rosa, contacted last week, said
there have been "significant
developments within the past couple of
months" in the investigation of the
Dawson shooting. Rosa stated he was
unable, however, to reveal what the
developments consist of.
Rosa explained that in the initial
investigation of the bombings at the
Nelson home and the President's Office
Building, "the results were so
unsatisfactory" that a special task force
was formed. A group of six men from
the Sheriff's Department was assigned
to gather and correlate information in
cooperation with FBI and Treasury
agents also involved in the
investigations.
Under provisions of the Omnibus
Crime Bill, passed in 1970, the FBI
may investigate any damage or attacks,
involving explosives at institutions
receiving federal financial assistance.
Discussing the bombings, Rosa said
"the cases are open but not active,"
and"the likelihood isn't too great"
that they will be solved. The Palo Alto
FBI office would not comment upon
the cases.
Assistant Chief John Barr of the
Stanford Fire Department said the last
evidence his department turned in came
24 hours after the Nelson bombing and
three days after the 19 71 bombing of
the President's Office Building.
County Fire Marshal Alan Carder
said that the investigation of the
Junipero arson came to a halt early last
June when his department "interviewed
five or six people then." Carder said
that although the department was "not

actively investigating the case now, it's
not closed out."
The Fire Marshal reported that the
last lead in the case of the Behavioral
Sciences Center arson came from the
District Attorney's office. It was
checked six months ago. "Any leads
that we had just fell by the wayside.
Nothing concrete came up," Carder
added. Preston Cutler, Assistant
Director of the Center, commented, "I
understood the rate of apprehension is
pretty low" in such arsons.
Evidence Lacking
In investigating the ROTC-Athletic
Building Arson, the Fire Marshal's
office had two suspects but was unable
to get enough information to make
arrests. Deputy Fire Marshal Harold
Stalker said he had "good suspects" in
investigations of the 1968 arsons at the
Navy ROTC building and President's
Office.
"We got close," he observed.
Nevertheless, the evidence was
insufficient to obtain criminal
complaints. The campus arsonists,
Stalker explained, are "very skilled in
techniques as far as what they're using,
but they don't seem to try to hide their
techniques from us."
There are several difficulties in
either preventing or investigating such
crimes at Stanford. The campus police
force has just 18 men cruising in mobile
vehicles, and 22 foot patrolmen. The
campus is large and only a portion of
the patrol force can be on duty at a
given time.
"If a person has made a bomb and
wants to set it off he's going to do it,"
said Bruce Wiggins, who, as operations
manager for plant services, has
responsibility for public safety at
Stanford. Wiggins noted how much
more open Stanford has become.
Formerly there was little besides
Sunday "Flicks" and Tuesday concerts
to draw the outside community to the
campus.
Now a wide range of attractions
prompts many more people to visit
Stanford. "There's more activity on
campus than other places," noted Fire
Marshal Carder. "Things that would
happen on campus are not unusual.
Other places they would be."
Apprehension Unlikely
Wiggins, a former Santa Clara Fire
Marshal, declared, "the probability of
apprehending anyone in an arson is
very low." Frequently the fire destroys
whatever material evidence an arsonist
may leave. Even when a campus arson
seems obviously politically motivated,
it may be, Rosa suggested, the work of
a pyromaniac "who chooses an
opportunistic moment" in the
politically charged atmosphere.
Rosa, Carder, and Wiggins each
emphasized the importance of students
giving any information they may have
to investigators. Carder said
investigations are hampered because
some students are sympathetic to the
aims of some bombers and arsonists,
while others are either apathetic or
fearful. Wiggins advised that students
can help if they will "be aware and not
be afraid to report things after—or
during."

unable, however, to reveal what the
developments consist of.
Rosa explained that in the initial
investigation of the bombings at the
Nelson home and the President's Office
Building, "the results were so
unsatisfactory" that a special task force
was formed. A group of six men from
the Sheriff's Department was assigned
to gather and correlate information in
cooperation with FBI and Treasury
agents also involved in the
investigations.
Under provisions of the Omnibus
Crime Bill, passed in 1970, the FBI
may investigate any damage or attacks,
involving explosives at institutions
receiving federal financial assistance.
Discussing the bombings, Rosa said
"the cases are open but not active,"
and"the likelihood isn't too great"
that they will be solved. The Palo Alto
FBI office would not comment upon
the cases.
Assistant Chief John Barr of the
Stanford Fire Department said the last
evidence his department turned in came
24 hours after the Nelson bombing and
three days after the 19 71 bombing of
the President's Office Building.
County Fire Marshal Alan Carder
said that the investigation of the
Junipero arson came to a halt early last
June when his department "interviewed
five or six people then." Carder said
that although the department was "not

actively investigating the case now, it's
not closed out."
The Fire Marshal reported that the
last lead in the case of the Behavioral
Sciences Center arson came from the
District Attorney's office. It was
checked six months ago. "Any leads
that we had just fell by the wayside.
Nothing concrete came up," Carder
added. Preston Cutler, Assistant
Director of the Center, commented, "I
understood the rate of apprehension is
pretty low" in such arsons.
Evidence Lacking
In investigating the ROTC-Athletic
Building Arson, the Fire Marshal's
office had two suspects but was unable
to get enough information to make
arrests. Deputy Fire Marshal Harold
Stalker said he had "good suspects" in
investigations of the 1968 arsons at the
Navy ROTC building and President's
Office.
"We got close," he observed.
Nevertheless, the evidence was
insufficient to obtain criminal
complaints. The campus arsonists,
Stalker explained, are "very skilled in
techniques as far as what they're using,
but they don't seem to try to hide their
techniques from us."
There are several difficulties in
either preventing or investigating such
crimes at Stanford. The campus police
force has just 18 men cruising in mobile
vehicles, and 22 foot patrolmen. The
campus is large and only a portion of
the patrol force can be on duty at a
given time.
"If a person has made a bomb and
wants to set it off he's going to do it,"
said Bruce Wiggins, who, as operations
manager for plant services, has
responsibility for public safety at
Stanford. Wiggins noted how much
more open Stanford has become.
Formerly there was little besides
Sunday "Flicks" and Tuesday concerts
to draw the outside community to the
campus.
Now a wide range of attractions
prompts many more people to visit
Stanford. "There's more activity on
campus than other places," noted Fire
Marshal Carder. "Things that would
happen on campus are not unusual.
Other places they would be."
Apprehension Unlikely
Wiggins, a former Santa Clara Fire
Marshal, declared, "the probability of
apprehending anyone in an arson is
very low." Frequently the fire destroys
whatever material evidence an arsonist
may leave. Even when a campus arson
seems obviously politically motivated,
it may be, Rosa suggested, the work of
a pyromaniac "who chooses an
opportunistic moment" in the
politically charged atmosphere.
Rosa, Carder, and Wiggins each
emphasized the importance of students
giving any information they may have
to investigators. Carder said
investigations are hampered because
some students are sympathetic to the
aims of some bombers and arsonists,
while others are either apathetic or
fearful. Wiggins advised that students
can help if they will "be aware and not
be afraid to report things after—or
during."

THE GOOD LlFE—Cliveden House, home of Stanford-in-Britain, is one of five overseas campuses. The overseas program has
been criticized by many students recently, but administrators say that problems are not as bad as reported.
From winter of 1968 through the
past summer, the Stanford campus has
been the scene of two bombings, at
least six arsons, and one shooting. To
date no one has been charged in
connection with the crimes, and the
statute of limitations, limiting the time
within which charges must be brought
for certain crimes, has expired for two
of the arsons.
The incidents:
Feb. 19, 1968 — Arson destroyed
the Navy ROTC annex. The old,
isolated building was located in a field

beside Galvez Street not far from the
Stanford stadium.
July 5, 1968 — Arson in the
President's Office Building in the Quad
caused an estimated $100,000 in
damage. Since state law fixes the
statute of limitations at three years for
felony arsons, no one can be arrested or
prosecuted now for the 1968 arsons.
April 24, 1970 — Private offices of
ten scholars were destroyed by arson at
the Center for Advanced Study in the
Behavioral Sciences. Estimated building
damage was $50,000 to $100,000.
Feb. 6, 1971 — Arson occurred at

the ROTC-Athletic Department
Building. Damage was estimated at less
than $1,000.
Feb. 10, 1971 — History Professor
Phil Dawson's teenage son was shot in
the thigh while talking with members
of the Free Campus Movement, a
conservative political organization, near
the FCM headquarters. The shooting
was one of the incidents of nighttime
violence following a rally to discuss
escalation of the Indochina War in
Laos.
April 23,1971 —A bomb exploded
in the attic of the President's Office
Building. A campus patrolman walking
by narrowly escaped injury. Damage
was estimated at $25,000.
April 26, 1 971 — Arson gutted the
Junipero House lounge, where the
Black Student Union often met, in
Wilbur Hall. Estimated damage was
between $50,000 ands7s,ooo .
July 12, 1971 — A pipe bomb
exploded outside the Coronado Drive
home of Robert Nelson, then director
of personnel and employee relations.
The month before, Nelson had
announced that five Stanford
employees were fired for "unacceptable
behavior" at an April 9 th Stanford
Hospital sit-in.
July 24, 1971 — Arson resulted in
an estimated $100 in damage at the
Free Market building at 5 47 Lane B,
near the Post Office. The building
housed the Free Campus Movement
during the regular academic year.

to draw the outside community to the
campus.
Now a wide range of attractions
prompts many more people to visit
Stanford. "There's more activity on
campus than other places," noted Fire
Marshal Carder. "Things that would
happen on campus are not unusual.
Other places they would be."
Apprehension Unlikely
Wiggins, a former Santa Clara Fire
Marshal, declared, "the probability of
apprehending anyone in an arson is
very low." Frequently the fire destroys
whatever material evidence an arsonist
may leave. Even when a campus arson
seems obviously politically motivated,
it may be, Rosa suggested, the work of
a pyromaniac "who chooses an
opportunistic moment" in the
politically charged atmosphere.
Rosa, Carder, and Wiggins each
emphasized the importance of students
giving any information they may have
to investigators. Carder said
investigations are hampered because
some students are sympathetic to the
aims of some bombers and arsonists,
while others are either apathetic or
fearful. Wiggins advised that students
can help if they will "be aware and not
be afraid to report things after—or
during."

THE GOOD LlFE—Cliveden House, home of Stanford-in-Britain, is one of five overseas campuses. The overseas program has
been criticized by many students recently, but administrators say that problems are not as bad as reported.
From winter of 1968 through the
past summer, the Stanford campus has
been the scene of two bombings, at
least six arsons, and one shooting. To
date no one has been charged in
connection with the crimes, and the
statute of limitations, limiting the time
within which charges must be brought
for certain crimes, has expired for two
of the arsons.
The incidents:
Feb. 19, 1968 — Arson destroyed
the Navy ROTC annex. The old,
isolated building was located in a field

beside Galvez Street not far from the
Stanford stadium.
July 5, 1968 — Arson in the
President's Office Building in the Quad
caused an estimated $100,000 in
damage. Since state law fixes the
statute of limitations at three years for
felony arsons, no one can be arrested or
prosecuted now for the 1968 arsons.
April 24, 1970 — Private offices of
ten scholars were destroyed by arson at
the Center for Advanced Study in the
Behavioral Sciences. Estimated building
damage was $50,000 to $100,000.
Feb. 6, 1971 — Arson occurred at

the ROTC-Athletic Department
Building. Damage was estimated at less
than $1,000.
Feb. 10, 1971 — History Professor
Phil Dawson's teenage son was shot in
the thigh while talking with members
of the Free Campus Movement, a
conservative political organization, near
the FCM headquarters. The shooting
was one of the incidents of nighttime
violence following a rally to discuss
escalation of the Indochina War in
Laos.
April 23,1971 —A bomb exploded
in the attic of the President's Office
Building. A campus patrolman walking
by narrowly escaped injury. Damage
was estimated at $25,000.
April 26, 1 971 — Arson gutted the
Junipero House lounge, where the
Black Student Union often met, in
Wilbur Hall. Estimated damage was
between $50,000 ands7s,ooo .
July 12, 1971 — A pipe bomb
exploded outside the Coronado Drive
home of Robert Nelson, then director
of personnel and employee relations.
The month before, Nelson had
announced that five Stanford
employees were fired for "unacceptable
behavior" at an April 9 th Stanford
Hospital sit-in.
July 24, 1971 — Arson resulted in
an estimated $100 in damage at the
Free Market building at 5 47 Lane B,
near the Post Office. The building
housed the Free Campus Movement
during the regular academic year.
Significant Developments
Santa Clara County Undersheriff
Tom Rosa, contacted last week, said
there have been "significant
developments within the past couple of
months" in the investigation of the
Dawson shooting. Rosa stated he was
unable, however, to reveal what the
developments consist of.
Rosa explained that in the initial
investigation of the bombings at the
Nelson home and the President's Office
Building, "the results were so
unsatisfactory" that a special task force
was formed. A group of six men from
the Sheriff's Department was assigned
to gather and correlate information in
cooperation with FBI and Treasury
agents also involved in the
investigations.
Under provisions of the Omnibus
Crime Bill, passed in 1970, the FBI
may investigate any damage or attacks,
involving explosives at institutions
receiving federal financial assistance.
Discussing the bombings, Rosa said
"the cases are open but not active,"
and"the likelihood isn't too great"
that they will be solved. The Palo Alto
FBI office would not comment upon
the cases.
Assistant Chief John Barr of the
Stanford Fire Department said the last
evidence his department turned in came
24 hours after the Nelson bombing and
three days after the 19 71 bombing of
the President's Office Building.
County Fire Marshal Alan Carder
said that the investigation of the
Junipero arson came to a halt early last
June when his department "interviewed
five or six people then." Carder said
that although the department was "not

actively investigating the case now, it's
not closed out."
The Fire Marshal reported that the
last lead in the case of the Behavioral
Sciences Center arson came from the
District Attorney's office. It was
checked six months ago. "Any leads
that we had just fell by the wayside.
Nothing concrete came up," Carder
added. Preston Cutler, Assistant
Director of the Center, commented, "I
understood the rate of apprehension is
pretty low" in such arsons.
Evidence Lacking
In investigating the ROTC-Athletic
Building Arson, the Fire Marshal's
office had two suspects but was unable
to get enough information to make
arrests. Deputy Fire Marshal Harold
Stalker said he had "good suspects" in
investigations of the 1968 arsons at the
Navy ROTC building and President's
Office.
"We got close," he observed.
Nevertheless, the evidence was
insufficient to obtain criminal
complaints. The campus arsonists,
Stalker explained, are "very skilled in
techniques as far as what they're using,
but they don't seem to try to hide their
techniques from us."
There are several difficulties in
either preventing or investigating such
crimes at Stanford. The campus police
force has just 18 men cruising in mobile
vehicles, and 22 foot patrolmen. The
campus is large and only a portion of
the patrol force can be on duty at a
given time.
"If a person has made a bomb and
wants to set it off he's going to do it,"
said Bruce Wiggins, who, as operations
manager for plant services, has
responsibility for public safety at
Stanford. Wiggins noted how much
more open Stanford has become.
Formerly there was little besides
Sunday "Flicks" and Tuesday concerts
to draw the outside community to the
campus.

escalation of the Indochina War in
Laos.
April 23,1971 —A bomb exploded
in the attic of the President's Office
Building. A campus patrolman walking
by narrowly escaped injury. Damage
was estimated at $25,000.
April 26, 1 971 — Arson gutted the
Junipero House lounge, where the
Black Student Union often met, in
Wilbur Hall. Estimated damage was
between $50,000 ands7s,ooo .
July 12, 1971 — A pipe bomb
exploded outside the Coronado Drive
home of Robert Nelson, then director
of personnel and employee relations.
The month before, Nelson had
announced that five Stanford
employees were fired for "unacceptable
behavior" at an April 9 th Stanford
Hospital sit-in.
July 24, 1971 — Arson resulted in
an estimated $100 in damage at the
Free Market building at 5 47 Lane B,
near the Post Office. The building
housed the Free Campus Movement
during the regular academic year.
Significant Developments
Santa Clara County Undersheriff
Tom Rosa, contacted last week, said
there have been "significant
developments within the past couple of
months" in the investigation of the
Dawson shooting. Rosa stated he was
unable, however, to reveal what the
developments consist of.
Rosa explained that in the initial
investigation of the bombings at the
Nelson home and the President's Office
Building, "the results were so
unsatisfactory" that a special task force
was formed. A group of six men from
the Sheriff's Department was assigned
to gather and correlate information in
cooperation with FBI and Treasury
agents also involved in the
investigations.
Under provisions of the Omnibus
Crime Bill, passed in 1970, the FBI
may investigate any damage or attacks,
involving explosives at institutions
receiving federal financial assistance.
Discussing the bombings, Rosa said
"the cases are open but not active,"
and"the likelihood isn't too great"
that they will be solved. The Palo Alto
FBI office would not comment upon
the cases.
Assistant Chief John Barr of the
Stanford Fire Department said the last
evidence his department turned in came
24 hours after the Nelson bombing and
three days after the 19 71 bombing of
the President's Office Building.
County Fire Marshal Alan Carder
said that the investigation of the
Junipero arson came to a halt early last
June when his department "interviewed
five or six people then." Carder said
that although the department was "not

actively investigating the case now, it's
not closed out."
The Fire Marshal reported that the
last lead in the case of the Behavioral
Sciences Center arson came from the
District Attorney's office. It was
checked six months ago. "Any leads
that we had just fell by the wayside.
Nothing concrete came up," Carder
added. Preston Cutler, Assistant
Director of the Center, commented, "I
understood the rate of apprehension is
pretty low" in such arsons.
Evidence Lacking
In investigating the ROTC-Athletic
Building Arson, the Fire Marshal's
office had two suspects but was unable
to get enough information to make
arrests. Deputy Fire Marshal Harold
Stalker said he had "good suspects" in
investigations of the 1968 arsons at the
Navy ROTC building and President's
Office.
"We got close," he observed.
Nevertheless, the evidence was
insufficient to obtain criminal
complaints. The campus arsonists,
Stalker explained, are "very skilled in
techniques as far as what they're using,
but they don't seem to try to hide their
techniques from us."
There are several difficulties in
either preventing or investigating such
crimes at Stanford. The campus police
force has just 18 men cruising in mobile
vehicles, and 22 foot patrolmen. The
campus is large and only a portion of
the patrol force can be on duty at a
given time.
"If a person has made a bomb and
wants to set it off he's going to do it,"
said Bruce Wiggins, who, as operations
manager for plant services, has
responsibility for public safety at
Stanford. Wiggins noted how much
more open Stanford has become.
Formerly there was little besides
Sunday "Flicks" and Tuesday concerts
to draw the outside community to the
campus.
Now a wide range of attractions
prompts many more people to visit
Stanford. "There's more activity on
campus than other places," noted Fire
Marshal Carder. "Things that would
happen on campus are not unusual.
Other places they would be."
Apprehension Unlikely
Wiggins, a former Santa Clara Fire
Marshal, declared, "the probability of
apprehending anyone in an arson is
very low." Frequently the fire destroys
whatever material evidence an arsonist
may leave. Even when a campus arson
seems obviously politically motivated,
it may be, Rosa suggested, the work of
a pyromaniac "who chooses an
opportunistic moment" in the
politically charged atmosphere.
Rosa, Carder, and Wiggins each
emphasized the importance of students
giving any information they may have
to investigators. Carder said
investigations are hampered because
some students are sympathetic to the
aims of some bombers and arsonists,
while others are either apathetic or
fearful. Wiggins advised that students
can help if they will "be aware and not
be afraid to report things after—or
during."

THE GOOD LlFE—Cliveden House, home of Stanford-in-Britain, is one of five overseas campuses. The overseas program has
been criticized by many students recently, but administrators say that problems are not as bad as reported.
