# Sides Meet To Clarify Future Franklin Case
## 
### PHIL REVZIN 
Boi,h sides in the H. Bruce Franklin
hearing met with the Advisory Board
for over three hours yesterday to
clarify matters concerning the
upcoming defense presentation about
the events of February 10.
According to defense counsel Jane
Franklin, "the only thing that's clear is
that nothing is clear. The meeting was
an attempt to set limits and deliniate
what Bruce has to defend himself on,
and very little clarification was made."
Advisory Board chairman Donald
Kennedy told the Daily that "we met
for the purpose of exploring with the
parties ways to continue with the rest
of the case. I think we made some
progress with the arrangements."
"No attempt was made to limit
either of the parties ' timewise,"
I'ennedy added.
Expedition
Legal Advisor to the President James
Siena said that "the intent of the
meeting was to try to achieve
understanding on the issues so that we
can proceed expeditiously." Siena
added that he would be hesitant to
assess the progress made during the
meeting.
The day's regular session featured 45
minutes of re-direct testimony by
Franklin and re-cross by University
counsel Ray Fisher on the January 11
Dinkelspiel speech by Henry Cabot
Lodge.
Franklin testified that he felt the
University had deleted important
passages in the SJC regulations which
applied at the time of the Lodge
incident, which apparently would have
allowed Franklin's case to be heard by
the SJC, as he had originally requested.
"At a time of crisis, any ruling class

begins to renounce its laws and ideals,"
Franklin said.
The Marxist scholar read the entire
text of a letter he sent to President
Lyman January 24, parts of which
Fisher had introduced on
cross-examination Tuesday.
In the letter, Franklin said, "I do
not deny demanding that Lodge and
the two representatives of the Hoover
Institution respond to the firebombing
and napalming of civilians . .
During re-cross examination,
Franklin reiterated his statement during
direct testimony that he said nothing to
Lodge while the ambassador was at the
podium. The suspended professor has
admitted saying two things while other
speakers were talking.
Franklin said that the intent of the
letter to Lyman was to not separate
him from the nine students and one
worker charged with disrupting the
Lodge speech, and tried before the SJC.
"The reason I did not deny heckling
was to show my solidarity with these
comrades," Franklin added.
The hearing will resume at 1 p.m.
today, presumably with the defense
beginning its testimony on the White
Plaza rally of February 10.

The day's regular session featured 45
minutes of re-direct testimony by
Franklin and re-cross by University
counsel Ray Fisher on the January 11
Dinkelspiel speech by Henry Cabot
Lodge.
Franklin testified that he felt the
University had deleted important
passages in the SJC regulations which
applied at the time of the Lodge
incident, which apparently would have
allowed Franklin's case to be heard by
the SJC, as he had originally requested.
"At a time of crisis, any ruling class

begins to renounce its laws and ideals,"
Franklin said.
The Marxist scholar read the entire
text of a letter he sent to President
Lyman January 24, parts of which
Fisher had introduced on
cross-examination Tuesday.
In the letter, Franklin said, "I do
not deny demanding that Lodge and
the two representatives of the Hoover
Institution respond to the firebombing
and napalming of civilians . .
During re-cross examination,
Franklin reiterated his statement during
direct testimony that he said nothing to
Lodge while the ambassador was at the
podium. The suspended professor has
admitted saying two things while other
speakers were talking.
Franklin said that the intent of the
letter to Lyman was to not separate
him from the nine students and one
worker charged with disrupting the
Lodge speech, and tried before the SJC.
"The reason I did not deny heckling
was to show my solidarity with these
comrades," Franklin added.
The hearing will resume at 1 p.m.
today, presumably with the defense
beginning its testimony on the White
Plaza rally of February 10.
Boi,h sides in the H. Bruce Franklin
hearing met with the Advisory Board
for over three hours yesterday to
clarify matters concerning the
upcoming defense presentation about
the events of February 10.
According to defense counsel Jane
Franklin, "the only thing that's clear is
that nothing is clear. The meeting was
an attempt to set limits and deliniate
what Bruce has to defend himself on,
and very little clarification was made."
Advisory Board chairman Donald
Kennedy told the Daily that "we met
for the purpose of exploring with the
parties ways to continue with the rest
of the case. I think we made some
progress with the arrangements."
"No attempt was made to limit
either of the parties ' timewise,"
I'ennedy added.
Expedition
Legal Advisor to the President James
Siena said that "the intent of the
meeting was to try to achieve
understanding on the issues so that we
can proceed expeditiously." Siena
added that he would be hesitant to
assess the progress made during the
meeting.
