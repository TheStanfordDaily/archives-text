Child Care Assessments
Editor, THE DAILY:
We would like to say several
things in response to Michael
Fancher's article on Fee
Assessments. First of all, the
Children's Center of the Stanford
Community is not asking for a
$1.00 assessment per student per
quarter. They are asking for a
$1.00 assessment for one quarter.
A minor detail, perhaps. But the
statement that "The backers of
these assessments are well aware
that if people know about them,
they'll vote against them," is
inaccurate, to say the least. The
Children's Center turned their
petitions in on Friday in
accordance with the ASSU
by-laws and since then have made
a conscious effort to publicize
their need for funds. Perhaps Mr.
Fancher is suffering from myopia
and cannot see the posters on the
kiosks.
We do not believe that "the
only valid measure of the
legitimacy of any group is its
ability to acquire funds on its
own," and we trust that we are
not alone in our opinion. We are
aware that money buys power,
but we think this definition is
carrying the sentiment a bit far.
If Mr. Fancher thinks it is
absurd to give money to a day
care center, that is his problem.
But before he labels ASSU fee
assessments as "sneaky" and
"coercive" he had better get his
facts straight.

Overseas Campuses
Editor, THE DAILY:
The recent article claiming that
the lack of student feedback
concerning overseas campuses has
left the controlling bodies of each
campus without the needed
student input required to
implement change is at best an
error if not an outright lie. The
lack of adaptability of the
overseas programs and the
accompanying drop in enrollment
are completely the responsibility
of the overseas campus
bureaucracy in California (not the
administrators residing at the
campuses abroad) which has
refused to even seriously consider
much needed and recommended
changes.
Five recommendations sent to
the Sub-Committee for Italian
Studies last March by the Italy
Group XXI were considered by
the sub-committee within ten
minutes and all dismissed as
"unworkable." It is a fact that
most of these "unworkable"
suggestions are presently features
of a similar overseas program in
Florence operated by the
California State College System.
Within a completely rigid
framework every proposed change
is unworkable. It is the
implementation of these
recommendations that is lacking.
If the Committee on Foreign
Study Programs truly wants to
renew interest in the overseas
campuses it should investigate
itself, its sub-committees, and the
administrators here who run the
program.
