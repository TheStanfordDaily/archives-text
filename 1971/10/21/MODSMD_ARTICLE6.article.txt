# One Experience With 'Our China'
## Shoots in Asia Concerned Asian Scholars

This is the story of one man
arrested, imprisoned, and then
released. We tell it because many
Americans were present, observing
and involved in the case, and the
data are available. It cannot be
said, however, that this is a unique
case, and many thousands of
people have gone through similar,
or far more agonizing, experiences
on the island of Taiwan. We tell it
because it may shed light on
current debate in the United
Nations and the attitude of
Americans toward a government
we have chosen to call our close
friend and ally.
Mr. Ts'ai Mao-t'ang is an
intellectual, a scholar of literature
and linguistics, a literary man of
unprepossessing appearance and
great charm. He lives in Taipei,
the capital of Taiwan, where he
writes essays and teaches
Taiwanese (his native language)
and Japanese (the language of his
education) to American students.
On April 16, 1971, Mr. Ts'ai
disappeared into a government
prison and didn't emerge again
until early August. During that
time he had been held
incommunicado for two months,
had not been charged with any
crime, had not been allowed to
see an attorney, and had not been
able to communicate with anyone
but his wife, whom he was able to
see for the first time in mid-May
and for the second time in early
July. He will not speak of his time
in prison, and he will not discuss
his treatment there—but he was
many pounds lighter when he was
released . than when he was
arrested, and in all his fifty years
he was never a heavy man.
Mr. Ts'ai's students visited
officials, wrote letters, made

phone calls, used government
contacts, attempted in every
possible way to obtain
information about Mr. Ts'ai's
condition and whereabouts during
his imprisonment. There is reason
to believe that their agitation and
concern were of aid in obtaining
Mr. Ts'ai's release. The
government, which had originally
held Mr. Ts'ai for "investigation
of complicity in a case of
insurrection" (an unofficial
quotation from a Foreign Ministry

officer), may have felt that
holding Mr. Ts'ai was more
trouble than releasing him and
shutting up the foreigners.
How could this happen? The
Republic of China, a "great and
good ally" of America, a
democratic nation, a bastion of
anti-Communism in Asia, using
Gestapo tactics on its own
citizens? Then being influenced
by long-haired American students
into dropping the case?
It sounds rather incongruous,
but it seemed to make sense to
those of us who were involved in
the case and who lived in the
midst of these contradictions.
First of all, Taiwan's government
under Chiang Kai-shek, while
mouthing the rhetoric of
democracy and American style
political and economic
development, has never dropped
the contention that a civil war is
going on in China, and that it is
therefore justified in declaring and
maintaining martial law. Thus the
people of Taiwan, 85% of whom
have little or no connection with
the mainland of China except
racial identification, have been

controlled by an outside military
order for the past twenty-two
years.
Second, the highly stratified
social and political order in
Taiwan is enforced by an elite
corps of "political police" (known
locally as the Garrison
Command), whose power to arrest
and imprison is unlimited by any
other government agency. When
Americans told their Chinese
friends that Mr. Ts'ai was held by
the G.C., they shrugged their

shoulders and said, "Then there's
nothing to be done."
Third, the Chiang regime is
currently feeling very threatened
from the outside. It's "greatest
ally in the anti-Communist
struggle," the United States, has
deserted and is advocating the
hated Two-China Policy,
denounced both by Chiang and by
the People's Republic of China in
Peking.
Even Japan, ex-enemy and
current economic support, seems
to be tending toward closer ties
with the "Communist bandits"
who are the Chinese government
and people. Thus any real or
perceived threat from within

Taiwan will be dealt with not only
with realistic measures but with
dictatorial thoroughness and
promptness. According to one
foreign observer, Taiwan's secret
police (headed by Chiang
Ching-kuo, son and probable heir
of Chiang Kai-shek) are the match
of any in the world. Mr. Ts'ai, an
intellectual known to be
discontent with the Chiang
regime, constituted a threat at this
critical time.
And Mr. Ts'ai was not alone in
this prison—at least half a dozen
other "dissident intellectuals"
disappeared this past spring,
including the author Li Ao and
the well-known translator and
author Prometheus Moon. Mr.
Ts'ai, a teacher of American
students, was the only one
released. The Chiang regime
feared the adverse publicity in the
United States which might result
from the activities of the
American students. They feared
that the American people, duped
for many years into believing that
the Chiang regime is the
government of China, might
discover the real nature of the
Taiwan dictatorship.
But, some argue, weren't the
American students themselves
acting as imperialists by using
their American citizenship,
immunity, and connections to
impose their will on a smaller
nation? A tenuous argument at
best, for the American students
were acting against the Chiang
regime, against the phony martial
law on Taiwan, and against the

wishes of the American Embassy,
who hindered progress in any way
they could.
The military government of
Taiwan has been using terror
tactics against its own people
since before the liberation of
mainland China in 1949. The
massacres of February, 1947, in
which Chiang's troops may have
killed as many as 10,000
Taiwanese, provide the most
graphic example. And Li Ao,
Prometheus Moon, and many
others are still in Chiang's political
prisons. How long will America
contend that this kind of police
state "represents the Chinese
people" or any fraction thereof?
Sanctimonious rhetoric of
comparison, saying that Chiang's
regime, though imperfect, is still
better than the "tyranny and
terror of the Communists" can
easily be exploded. Chiang's
regime, though shored up by
billions of American dollars,
thousands of American troops,
and mounds of policy statements
over the past 28 years (Chiang was
elected president in 1943) is
losing its legitimacy battle against
the Communists, who have relied
primarily on themselves and the
Chinese people for development
and are now in a period of rapid
development. None can deny the
economic growth of Taiwan under
American auspices, but when seen
in perspective that growth is far
less remarkable than the
self-reliant recovery, stabilization,
and development of the vast
majority of the Chinese people
under the People's Republic.
