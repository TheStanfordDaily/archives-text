# More On Fee Election
## 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
Tired as I am of answering
questions and stereotyped
comments about the Council of
Presidents, I do want to answer
one point made by Michael
Fancher in his article "Fee
Assessments" in Tuesday's Daily.
He states that last Thursday, two
members of the Council were on
KZSU's "Close-Up." A call came
in concerning the fee assessment.
He claims the answer was never
given despite our many
opportunities to do so; and Mr.
Fancher implies that our silence
was intentional. As one of the
Council members who was
present, I must inform Mr.
Fancher that if the question was
really called in, we never received
it. The fault is no one's in

particular. If he will listen to
KZSU's "Close-Up" this Thursday
he will be able to hear a more
adequate answer to that question
than I have time to give here.
There is no attempt on the
Council's part to hide anything on
the ballot. Again, I remind him, as
I have so repeatedly reminded
others, the Elections
Commissioner is Alice Furumoto.
She has attempted to carry out
her constitutional duties as much
as possible. Her repeated requests
for aid have as yet to be answered.
If Mr. Fancher feels that publicity
of the fee assessments is necessary
in terms of daily publication in
the Daily or some other news
media, I suggest that he volunteer
his aid to Ms. Furumoto.
Yes, the Council does support
the fee assessments as we did last
spring. Mr. Fancher has the idea
that he knows what I am "well
aware" of as a backer of the fee
assessment. I would ask that he
not have the audacity to know

what is in my mind if I haven't
stated those thoughts. I would
also like to inform him that what
1 am well aware of is that the
reason people vote for $0 is not
the mere knowledge of a fee
election, but rather, the shit sheet
campaigns that go on against
those elections. I can only
commend Mr. Fancher on his
minimization of shit slinging and
his attempts at rationality. I can
only hope that the creators of the
two fee requests will publicly
state, in the Daily, their
arguments for those fees.

the fee assessments as we did last
spring. Mr. Fancher has the idea
that he knows what I am "well
aware" of as a backer of the fee
assessment. I would ask that he
not have the audacity to know

what is in my mind if I haven't
stated those thoughts. I would
also like to inform him that what
1 am well aware of is that the
reason people vote for $0 is not
the mere knowledge of a fee
election, but rather, the shit sheet
campaigns that go on against
those elections. I can only
commend Mr. Fancher on his
minimization of shit slinging and
his attempts at rationality. I can
only hope that the creators of the
two fee requests will publicly
state, in the Daily, their
arguments for those fees.
