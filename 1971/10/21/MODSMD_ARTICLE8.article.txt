There are some human
experiences which must be lived
in order to be fully appreciated.
Men can never completely share a
woman's joy in creating life, nor
can the affluent liberal totally
comprehend the despair and
powerlessness of the poor. In the
same way, you are right in
suggesting that a person with
freedom and liberty can not relate
to the sense of outrage that a
prisoner feels when his human
dignity as well as his civil rights
are taken away.
However, there are limits to
this line of reasoning in which
"real life learning," "street savvy"
and "experiencing" rather than
"book learning" and "rational
analysis" are presented as the only
relevant roads to knowledge. In
the play The King and I, the king
replies to his son's refusal to
believe in snow because he has
never seen it fall in Siam, that it is
the purpose of "education" to
teach one about the reality that is
beyond a given individual's
immediate (and limited)
experience.
Education is sharing our
experiences so that we can
understand and empathize with
those who have suffered without
necessarily going through the
same suffering. It is also going
beyond appearances to discover
genotypes, beyond particular
instances to broader
generalizations and beyond
personal biases to more objective
analyses of issues, people and
problems.
In your thoughtful modest
proposal, you imply that as an
academic research psychologist
(scholar), I was probably
insensitive to the differences
between the power and pathology
that exists in a "real prison" and
what took place in our "simulated
prison experiment" this summer
at Stanford. Indeed, I would have
been, had I not spent the previous
five months in trying to learn
about the psychology of
imprisonment. I learned from long
talks with one of the most
sensitive and articulate people I
know, Carlo Prescott, a former
prisoner for 16 years.
Together, we organized a
course this summer at Stanford on
"the experience of the
imprisoned." Through him, I was
able to learn from Popeye Jackson
and Rex, organizers of the
California Prisoners' Union (my
card number is 1 4 02 ). From other
ex-cons (notably "Snuffy Smith"
Mark K, and the men I ate with at
the Halfway House in San
Francisco, as well as parole
officers, lawyers, a former prison
chaplain and the father of a young
prisoner) I developed some
understanding of the psychological
variables which exist in the prison
institution. I did not enter this
experiment lightly or without
considerable preparation. My

student, Dave Jaffe (who was the
"Warden" in our "Stanford
County Jail") shared with me the
knowledge he had gained from an
earlier study he had done with
other Stanford students who
created an experimental prison.
It was this awareness of what it
means to be imprisoned or to be
the guard who imprisons which
enables us to design a prison
environment "real" enough to
profoundly affect everyone who
came within its walls. We did not
condone or promote
homosexuality or racism or
extreme physical brutality. The
"prisoners" did not live in fear of
their lives from assaults by
mentally disturbed prisoners or
sadistic guards. They did not have
to cope with indeterminate
sentences of 5 years to life—all
part of your prison life.
Nevertheless, a prison mentality
was created and the distinction
between role and self identity
became blurred in many of the
"guards," "prisoners" and "staff."
We are analyzing the data
collected during this study and
when a full report is ready I will
be glad tc share it with you in
return for your ideas about what
imprisonment has meant to you.
Meanwhile, NBC—Chronolog will
feature the study on its Nov. 26
show, and you can see from our
videotapes, around which
the program is organized, how
valid the experience was. I will
also try to describe what I've
learned about the dehumanizing
effects of incarceration to a
Congressional Judiciary
Committee hearing next week.
It is conceivable that we may
be able to effect some change in
"real" prisons (the experiment
society has you now serving in
against your will) from the mock
prison your fellow students lived
in for a time here at Stanford. The
emerging goal of many social
scientists, like myself, is to move
from observation to analysis to
experimentation to new
understanding and then to
encourage social change through
productive social action.

However, there are limits to
this line of reasoning in which
"real life learning," "street savvy"
and "experiencing" rather than
"book learning" and "rational
analysis" are presented as the only
relevant roads to knowledge. In
the play The King and I, the king
replies to his son's refusal to
believe in snow because he has
never seen it fall in Siam, that it is
the purpose of "education" to
teach one about the reality that is
beyond a given individual's
immediate (and limited)
experience.
Education is sharing our
experiences so that we can
understand and empathize with
those who have suffered without
necessarily going through the
same suffering. It is also going
beyond appearances to discover
genotypes, beyond particular
instances to broader
generalizations and beyond
personal biases to more objective
analyses of issues, people and
problems.
In your thoughtful modest
proposal, you imply that as an
academic research psychologist
(scholar), I was probably
insensitive to the differences
between the power and pathology
that exists in a "real prison" and
what took place in our "simulated
prison experiment" this summer
at Stanford. Indeed, I would have
been, had I not spent the previous
five months in trying to learn
about the psychology of
imprisonment. I learned from long
talks with one of the most
sensitive and articulate people I
know, Carlo Prescott, a former
prisoner for 16 years.
Together, we organized a
course this summer at Stanford on
"the experience of the
imprisoned." Through him, I was
able to learn from Popeye Jackson
and Rex, organizers of the
California Prisoners' Union (my
card number is 1 4 02 ). From other
ex-cons (notably "Snuffy Smith"
Mark K, and the men I ate with at
the Halfway House in San
Francisco, as well as parole
officers, lawyers, a former prison
chaplain and the father of a young
prisoner) I developed some
understanding of the psychological
variables which exist in the prison
institution. I did not enter this
experiment lightly or without
considerable preparation. My

student, Dave Jaffe (who was the
"Warden" in our "Stanford
County Jail") shared with me the
knowledge he had gained from an
earlier study he had done with
other Stanford students who
created an experimental prison.
It was this awareness of what it
means to be imprisoned or to be
the guard who imprisons which
enables us to design a prison
environment "real" enough to
profoundly affect everyone who
came within its walls. We did not
condone or promote
homosexuality or racism or
extreme physical brutality. The
"prisoners" did not live in fear of
their lives from assaults by
mentally disturbed prisoners or
sadistic guards. They did not have
to cope with indeterminate
sentences of 5 years to life—all
part of your prison life.
Nevertheless, a prison mentality
was created and the distinction
between role and self identity
became blurred in many of the
"guards," "prisoners" and "staff."
We are analyzing the data
collected during this study and
when a full report is ready I will
be glad tc share it with you in
return for your ideas about what
imprisonment has meant to you.
Meanwhile, NBC—Chronolog will
feature the study on its Nov. 26
show, and you can see from our
videotapes, around which
the program is organized, how
valid the experience was. I will
also try to describe what I've
learned about the dehumanizing
effects of incarceration to a
Congressional Judiciary
Committee hearing next week.
It is conceivable that we may
be able to effect some change in
"real" prisons (the experiment
society has you now serving in
against your will) from the mock
prison your fellow students lived
in for a time here at Stanford. The
emerging goal of many social
scientists, like myself, is to move
from observation to analysis to
experimentation to new
understanding and then to
encourage social change through
productive social action.
There are some human
experiences which must be lived
in order to be fully appreciated.
Men can never completely share a
woman's joy in creating life, nor
can the affluent liberal totally
comprehend the despair and
powerlessness of the poor. In the
same way, you are right in
suggesting that a person with
freedom and liberty can not relate
to the sense of outrage that a
prisoner feels when his human
dignity as well as his civil rights
are taken away.
