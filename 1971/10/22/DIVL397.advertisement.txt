A PETITION TO THE UNIVERSITY OMBUDSMAN,
MRS. LOIS AMSTERDAM AND THE STANFORD
BOARD OF TRUSTEES
We, the undersigned members of the Stanford Jewish community are extremely distressed over certain
Stanford University policies which adversely affect our observance and practice of Judaism:
1. Judaism requires that on the two sacred holidays of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur Jews cease all
normal activities (such as travelling, eating, attending classes, etc.) and commit themselves totally to the
holiday observance.
2. Stanford University scheduled the first day of classes, which most students academically and
, psychologically feel they must attend, in conflict with the holiest day of the year, Yom Kippur.
a. No advance notofication of the fact that students would not be penalized for missing the first day
of calsses was made to the Stanford student body, thereby resulting in considerable anxiety on the
part of many students.
b. No effort was made to notify faculty and staff of this conflict in order that students would not be
penalized for missing the first day of classes.
c. Few make-up classes were offered for undergraduates who missed the first day of classes, resulting
in an irrevocable loss of material to a number of students.
d. The only effort made to alleviate the problem of classes missed was made by the Registrar's office
wnich inserted a one sentence announcement in an obscure portion of the Stanford Daily on the first
day of calsses.
3. Although the University and administration informed Rabbi Charles Familant that their treatment of
the Jewish community was in accordance with an even-handed policy of non-recognition of any religious
group or holiday we find this difficult to accept:
a. The Stanford quarter system is built around the observance of major Christian holidays such as
Christmas and Easter.
b. No major University functions are scheduled for the Christian Sabbath of Sunday while classes,
exams and other major University activities are scheduled during the Jewish Sabbath of Saturday.
c. Though supposedly a non-sectarian institution, Stanford maintains the Memorial Church which is
Christian in its ritual symbols, stained glass windows, etc. and is therefore totally unsuitable for the
worship of the Stanford community. Rabbi Familant has repeatedly stated the Jewish community's
objection to conducting religious services in the Church.
Three hundred fifty people participating in Yom Kippur services were forced, by previous order of the
Board of Trustees in consultation with the President (Trustee meetings of May and July, 1966), to meet
in an auditorium (The Clubhouse of the Old Union) which seats no more than two hundred people, has
no adequate fire exit, and is consequently an extreme fire hazard to the Jewish community and the
University in general; while at the same time the entire Christian community is afforded the use of
Memorial Church which seats in excess of 2000 people.
We, the undersigned, therefore urge the Board of Trustees to:
1. Assure the Jewish community that neither registration nor the first two days of classes (since Rosh
Hashanah is a two-day holiday and many classes begin on a Thursday) be scheduled in conflict with the
Jewish holidays of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur.
2. Permit the Stanford Jewish community the use of suitable and safe facilities (ie. Bishop or Dinkelspiel
Auds.) for major religious services and activities.
3. Grant to representatives of the Stanford Jewish community a hearing before the Board of Trustees to
clarify and better explain the above petition.

day of calsses.
3. Although the University and administration informed Rabbi Charles Familant that their treatment of
the Jewish community was in accordance with an even-handed policy of non-recognition of any religious
group or holiday we find this difficult to accept:
a. The Stanford quarter system is built around the observance of major Christian holidays such as
Christmas and Easter.
b. No major University functions are scheduled for the Christian Sabbath of Sunday while classes,
exams and other major University activities are scheduled during the Jewish Sabbath of Saturday.
c. Though supposedly a non-sectarian institution, Stanford maintains the Memorial Church which is
Christian in its ritual symbols, stained glass windows, etc. and is therefore totally unsuitable for the
worship of the Stanford community. Rabbi Familant has repeatedly stated the Jewish community's
objection to conducting religious services in the Church.
Three hundred fifty people participating in Yom Kippur services were forced, by previous order of the
Board of Trustees in consultation with the President (Trustee meetings of May and July, 1966), to meet
in an auditorium (The Clubhouse of the Old Union) which seats no more than two hundred people, has
no adequate fire exit, and is consequently an extreme fire hazard to the Jewish community and the
University in general; while at the same time the entire Christian community is afforded the use of
Memorial Church which seats in excess of 2000 people.
We, the undersigned, therefore urge the Board of Trustees to:
1. Assure the Jewish community that neither registration nor the first two days of classes (since Rosh
Hashanah is a two-day holiday and many classes begin on a Thursday) be scheduled in conflict with the
Jewish holidays of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur.
2. Permit the Stanford Jewish community the use of suitable and safe facilities (ie. Bishop or Dinkelspiel
Auds.) for major religious services and activities.
3. Grant to representatives of the Stanford Jewish community a hearing before the Board of Trustees to
clarify and better explain the above petition.

A PETITION TO THE UNIVERSITY OMBUDSMAN,
MRS. LOIS AMSTERDAM AND THE STANFORD
BOARD OF TRUSTEES
We, the undersigned members of the Stanford Jewish community are extremely distressed over certain
Stanford University policies which adversely affect our observance and practice of Judaism:
1. Judaism requires that on the two sacred holidays of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur Jews cease all
normal activities (such as travelling, eating, attending classes, etc.) and commit themselves totally to the
holiday observance.
2. Stanford University scheduled the first day of classes, which most students academically and
, psychologically feel they must attend, in conflict with the holiest day of the year, Yom Kippur.
a. No advance notofication of the fact that students would not be penalized for missing the first day
of calsses was made to the Stanford student body, thereby resulting in considerable anxiety on the
part of many students.
b. No effort was made to notify faculty and staff of this conflict in order that students would not be
penalized for missing the first day of classes.
c. Few make-up classes were offered for undergraduates who missed the first day of classes, resulting
in an irrevocable loss of material to a number of students.
d. The only effort made to alleviate the problem of classes missed was made by the Registrar's office
wnich inserted a one sentence announcement in an obscure portion of the Stanford Daily on the first
day of calsses.
