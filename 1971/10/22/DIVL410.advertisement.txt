The Daily Women's Forum grew
out of a need felt by many women
on the Stanford Campus to
communicate with each other and
with men. It is an open page: we
welcome any and all articles which
relate to issued concerning women.
The Forum will be published
with a minimum of editorial
guidance; there is certainly no
"line" which the page is pusiiing.
Pieces can take any form. We
would like factual articles, opinion,
fiction, personal experiences,
poems, graphics, photographs,
manifestos, or anything else you
feel like submitting.
