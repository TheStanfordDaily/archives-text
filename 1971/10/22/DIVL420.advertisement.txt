Dynastar skis are definitely grabbers - but only
when you want them to be. They're race
engineered to grab on snow or blue ice when
you need to carve a turn. No slip, no slide, no
chatter, — just a cleanly carved arc. And as fast
as you release those hard steel edges, your
fabulous French Dynastars will track like a
locomotive. That's why Dynastars racked up 19
FIS Racing Medals in 1970 alone.
Should the Dynastar skis grab you, Short Swing
Ski Shop is where you'll find them — we're the
exclusive dealer for these limited edition skis
from S.F. to San Jose. We'll help you choose
between the Purple Fiberglass S-430 (slalom,
GS) or the White Metal MV-Z (GS, Downhill).
Dynastars are not your common "pop-out" skis
with a "SL" or "GS" decal — they're the real
thing. Naturally, the supply is limited, so please
~ don't delay, plus Short Swing throws in a free
mm * hot wax job for each new pair sold.
