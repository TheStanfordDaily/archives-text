Don Parish Traded
Former Stanford linebacker Don Parish was traded to the Los
Angeles Rams from the St. Louis Cardinals yesterday for an
undisclosed future draft choice.
Parish twice earned All-West Coast honors while at Stanford,
and was chosen as the Cardinal's top rookie last year. This season,
however, Parish has been hampered by a knee injury and has not
played in the Cardinals' first five league gairÂ»es.
Ram coach Tommy Prothro must have changed his mind in
acquiring Parish, since Prothro criticized circumstances
surrounding the Stanford linebacker's play in the Indian-Bruin
clash of two years ago. Prothro felt that Parish was being credited
with too many tackles in order to improve his chances for an
All-American spot.
