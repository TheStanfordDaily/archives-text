# Nixon's Court Choices Startle Bar
## 
### DAVID THIEMANN 
Lewis F. Powell, a 64-year-old trial
lawyer from Richmond, Va., and
William Rehnquist, 4 7-year-old
Assistant Attorney General and
Stanford graduate, were named last
night as nominees for the Supreme
Court.
President Nixon, in a nationwide
television and radio address, proposed
Rhenquist and Powell to fill seats
vacated by John M. Harlan and the late
Hugo Black, both of whom retired
from the Court.
Rhenquist received his A.B. and
A.M. here in 1 94 8 and was graduated
first in his class at the Stanford Law

School in 195 2 (see related story
below).
According to informed legal sources,
Nixon decided Thursday morning upon
Rehnquist and Powell, whose names
were not presented to the American
Bar Association's committee on the
Federal Judiciary. The ABA panel
concluded on Wednesday, October 13,
that neither of the President's original
top nominees was qualified for the job.
Reportedly Nixon, in an attempt to
avoid a protracted confirmation battle
in the Senate, chose to propose names
not yet considered by the ABA
committee.
The ABA committee apparently

refused to endorse all six of Nixon's
original choices because of their lack of
professional stature. The committee is
reported to have rejected the two
favored candidates completely: Mildred
L. Lillie, a California Court of Appeals
judge, by an 11 to 1 margin, and
Herschel H. Friday, a Little Rock, Ark.
lawyer, by a 7 to 5 vote.
The committee decisions and votes
were published in the late editions of
last Thursday's Washington Post.
After the President's nomination
announcement, the White House
released a letter from Attorney General
Mitchell to ABA President Leon
Jaworski and to the Chairman of the
ABA Federal Judiciary Panel, Lawrence
E. Walsh.
In the letter, Mitchell wrote that
"the events of the last week" have
demonstrated that there is no practical
way to avoid "unauthorized disclosure
of the names submitted and the advice
of your committee."
Mitchell informed the ABA that he
would no longer submit the names of
prospective nominees to the Committee
for evaluation.

Rancor between the ABA and the
Administration was unconcealed, both
In Mitchell's letter and In a statement
by Presidential Press Secretary Ronald
Zeigler, which said: "the Constitution
does not require the consent of the
ABA ... they of course do not have
veto power."
Rhenquist now heads the Legal
Counsel's Office in the Justice
Department, after a 1969 Nixon
appointment. Before working for the
government, he practiced law in
Phoenix for 16 years.
Powell, the other Nixon nominee,
has served as President of both the
American College of Trial Lawyers and
the American Bar Association, the two
most prestigious legal societies in the
United States.
First In His Class
After graduating first in his class
from Washington and Lee college,
Powell began practicing law in
Richmond in 1931, and has continued
without a break since.


NIXON APPOINTEE—WiIIiam Rehnquist, Stanford Law School Alumnus and
presently Assistant Attorney General, has been named by President Nixon to fill
one of the vacant seats on the Supreme Court.
