## Stanford's Virtuous History 
### 
"Academic Freedom & Other Myths," by
Gregory De Freitas in 6 October issue of the Daily
gives a distorted picture of Stanford University's
founders. Indubitably they had their share of
human frailities but let us look for a change at
some of their virtues.
The phrase "rabid Republican" and the
threadbare cliche "robber baron" appear to sum
up De Freitas' opinion of Leland Stanford. In
truth Stanford was a founder of the Republican
Party in California and stood fast to its principles
of anti-slavery and Union at a time when it took
courage to be a Republican and against the
pro-slavery Democrats then in power.
Construction of the maligned Central Pacific
Railroad helped keep California in the Union and
made possible the building of the West. Unlike
most other roads at the time the Central Pacific
and its successor, the Southern Pacific, repaid in
fult every public and private debt.
Mrs. Stanford is pictured in the article as an
anti-socialist employer, her head employee being
President Jordan. A few words on the other side.
On Senator Stanford's death in 18 93 the
government brought suit against the estate in the
sum of fifteen and a quarter million dollars. In
addition there was a nation wide depression. The
University was without funds. "It must be closed,"
said the leading lawyers and bankers of San
Francisco. Had it not been for Mrs. Stanford's
unsuspected sagacity, self-sacrifice, and will,
together with the loyal support of President
Jordan and the whole Stanford community, there
would be no Stanford University today. It was
kept operating on the personal allowance given the
widow by the court, and the monies from the sale
of her most precious pearls, which she gave to Dr.
Jordan to dispense as he thought best. In 1896 the
United States Supreme Court rendered a
unanimous decision in favor of the Stanford

estate.
De Freitas says in his article that Dr. Jordan
despised autonomous departments. Not so. He
introduced the major-subject system and left each
professor free to arrange the studies in his own
discipline. Dr. Jordan believed that prescribed
courses were an affront to the serious student.
Grading consisted of passed, conditioned, or
failed.
The "Ross Affair" was a sorry one at best and
no heroes emerged from it. However, President
Jordan defended his fellow teacher for several
years until Dr. Ross himself created a situation
that was impossible of reasonable solution. De
Freitas misquotes Mrs. Stanford's letter to Jordan
on the subject as given on page 341 in Orrin Leslie
Elliott's Stanford University, The First
Twenty-five Years. The phrase "mixing in political
affairs" does not appear in the context in which he
puts it. Incidentally, Elliott's name is misspelled.
When the furor subsided, the great majority of
faculty and" students agreed that the issue had not
been one of academic freedom but the right of the
University to protect its good name and the
integrity of its classrooms.
A final note. Stanford's founders detested war.
Leland Stanford in his opening talk contrasted the
West's freedom to develop the arts of peace with
the Old World's staggering burden of armament.
Dr. Jordan spent his last years in a tireless crusade
against war. That his valiant efforts went unheeded
is perhaps the sadest commentary on his times.
These few remarks will perhaps give you a
glimpse of early Stanford from the other side of
the hill. Though our views may differ, I feel sure
our common purpose is the good of our beloved
University.

"Academic Freedom & Other Myths," by
Gregory De Freitas in 6 October issue of the Daily
gives a distorted picture of Stanford University's
founders. Indubitably they had their share of
human frailities but let us look for a change at
some of their virtues.
The phrase "rabid Republican" and the
threadbare cliche "robber baron" appear to sum
up De Freitas' opinion of Leland Stanford. In
truth Stanford was a founder of the Republican
Party in California and stood fast to its principles
of anti-slavery and Union at a time when it took
courage to be a Republican and against the
pro-slavery Democrats then in power.
Construction of the maligned Central Pacific
Railroad helped keep California in the Union and
made possible the building of the West. Unlike
most other roads at the time the Central Pacific
and its successor, the Southern Pacific, repaid in
fult every public and private debt.
Mrs. Stanford is pictured in the article as an
anti-socialist employer, her head employee being
President Jordan. A few words on the other side.
On Senator Stanford's death in 18 93 the
government brought suit against the estate in the
sum of fifteen and a quarter million dollars. In
addition there was a nation wide depression. The
University was without funds. "It must be closed,"
said the leading lawyers and bankers of San
Francisco. Had it not been for Mrs. Stanford's
unsuspected sagacity, self-sacrifice, and will,
together with the loyal support of President
Jordan and the whole Stanford community, there
would be no Stanford University today. It was
kept operating on the personal allowance given the
widow by the court, and the monies from the sale
of her most precious pearls, which she gave to Dr.
Jordan to dispense as he thought best. In 1896 the
United States Supreme Court rendered a
unanimous decision in favor of the Stanford

> gunther w. nagel

estate.
De Freitas says in his article that Dr. Jordan
despised autonomous departments. Not so. He
introduced the major-subject system and left each
professor free to arrange the studies in his own
discipline. Dr. Jordan believed that prescribed
courses were an affront to the serious student.
Grading consisted of passed, conditioned, or
failed.
The "Ross Affair" was a sorry one at best and
no heroes emerged from it. However, President
Jordan defended his fellow teacher for several
years until Dr. Ross himself created a situation
that was impossible of reasonable solution. De
Freitas misquotes Mrs. Stanford's letter to Jordan
on the subject as given on page 341 in Orrin Leslie
Elliott's Stanford University, The First
Twenty-five Years. The phrase "mixing in political
affairs" does not appear in the context in which he
puts it. Incidentally, Elliott's name is misspelled.
When the furor subsided, the great majority of
faculty and" students agreed that the issue had not
been one of academic freedom but the right of the
University to protect its good name and the
integrity of its classrooms.
A final note. Stanford's founders detested war.
Leland Stanford in his opening talk contrasted the
West's freedom to develop the arts of peace with
the Old World's staggering burden of armament.
Dr. Jordan spent his last years in a tireless crusade
against war. That his valiant efforts went unheeded
is perhaps the sadest commentary on his times.
These few remarks will perhaps give you a
glimpse of early Stanford from the other side of
the hill. Though our views may differ, I feel sure
our common purpose is the good of our beloved
University.
