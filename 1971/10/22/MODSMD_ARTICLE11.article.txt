# The 						Myth Of Vietnam Withdrawal
## 
### JIM SHOCH 
In an important article in the
October 9 issue of The New
Republic, Gabriel Kolko writes,
"Newspaper assertions that the
administration has accepted the
principle of total American troop
withdrawal from Vietnam have
begun to confuse desires with
reality. . .the cultivated illusion
that the President has a 'plan' for
which he requires public and
congressional patience is belied by
what the record shows to be a
quite deliberate policy of
protracted US military activity in
Indochina and a will to sustain the
war and the US presence there
indefinitely."
As Professor Kolko
convincingly proves, Nixon's
so-called "Vietnamization"
scheme has been a hoax ever since
it was first publicly enunciated on
November 3, 1969.
"Vietnamization," (South
Vietnamese Army troops take
over the ground fighting while US
bombers keep pounding away)
was largely a response to the
growing American anti-war
movement. It was designed to
quiet the American public, thus
enabling the US to maintain an
important military presence in
Vietnam for a long time to come.
"Vietnamization" in no way
meant a rapid and complete
withdrawal of all American
troops, planes, and ships from
Vietnam.
Secretary of the Army Stanley
Resor outlined this strategy in the
fall of 1969 in testimony before
the House Committee on
Appropriations: ". . .if we can
make it clear to the enemy that
we can reduce the level of the war
to something that the American
people will support for a
significant period," then the NLF
would "negotiate or possibly just
reduce the level of combat." At
the same hearings, in response to

Representative George Mahon's
question that "If Vietnamization
does not work, and if agreements
cannot be reached in the Paris
peace talks or otherwise, do you
foresee the possibility of an
escalation of the war in Vietnam,"
Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird
replied, "I would not rule out that
possibility completely."
Nixon's plan to "Vietnamize"
the ground fighting (not the air
war) has never been very
successful. The commitment to
maintain a high level of US

manpower in the Indochina
theater was acknowledged
throughout 1970. It was a
"pipedream," one Pentagon
officer commented in July of that
year, to believe Nixon would have
US forces down to 50,000 by the
end of 1971; 150,000 to 200,000
as late as 1972 was considered
much more likely. In July, 1970,
the New York Timess, summed up
the Pentagon's feelings when it
noted that rapid "pullouts would
cause the unraveling of the Saigon
government and its armed forces
and produce a military and
political collapse."
Meanwhile, the use of US
airpower was intensified. During
hearings for defense
appropriations for 1971, a
Pentagon official admitted under
intense questioning that the
Saigon air force was unable to
handle close air support and
interdiction, much less air defense
and other functions.
"Consequently," he said, "we

expect a significant I US] Air
Force commitment in Southeast
Asia for a considerable period of
time."
The overall American position
in Vietnam in late 1970 was
summed up by Admiral U.S.
Grant Sharp, the former head of
the Vietnam and Pacific theater
until 1968: "the American
presence in the Southeast Asia
area is going to be large for some
time to come."
By the end of 1970, it was felt
in Washington that the American

ff|
G\yy' INDOCHINA STUPV GROUP

public would accept continued US
involvement in the air, artillery,
and naval aspects of the war,
while demanding further ground
force reductions. In his January
29, 1971, news conference,
Secretary of State William P.
Rogers repeatedly stressed the
continuing role of airpower: "We
don't see any reason why there
should be any limit to the use of
that airpower. He [Nixon]
intends to use the airpower as he
sees fit. . .Our airpower is going to
be used to the maximum extent
necessary.. .for the safety of
Americans. .."
At what pace will
"Vietnamization" proceed in the
future? No one denies that as of
July, 1971, US troop strength in
Vietnam itself had been reduced
to 226,000 men. The central
question is the point at which the
administration plans to slow down
or stop personnel withdrawals
from Vietnam and, above all,
what it intends to do with the

306,000 other troops stationed in
the Southeast Asia and the
Western Pacific who sustain the
war in the air and on the sea and
ground.
In Vietnam itself, Nixon's
public committment runs only
through next November, and
thereafter, General F.J. Kroesner,
the Pentagon's manpower
director, admitted to the House
Appropriations Committee last
April 26, "we have not been given
firm decisions." And the New
York Times reported earlier this
month that "no firm decision has
yet been made on the precise size,
composition or length of stay of
the so-called American 'residual
force'..lt's safe to say,
however, in view of the South
Vietnamese Army's
incompetence, that this "residual
force" will be of substantial size
and will remain in Vietnam for
some time. There has been very
little talk of reducing the number
of support troops in neighboring
Asian countries.

On the armaments and
technology side, the Air Force is
enlarging its AC-130 gunship
force. US Army ammunition
procurement costs, which fell
from $1.73 billion in fiscal 1970
to roughly $1.15 billion the
following year, will leap back to
$1.57 billion. The War in
Indochina accounts for the vast
bulk of this expenditure.
The full costs of the war for
fiscal 1972, ending next June 30,
are projected for at least $10
billion, and more probably $12
billion. There have been hints
recently that this figure could
even hit $14 billion. Compared to
the $15.3 billion spent on the war
in 1971, this year's outlays don't
constitute much of a reduction.
As the number of "protective
reaction" strikes against North
Vietnam is stepped up, and as the
bombing continues over the rest
of Indochina, it becomes
increasingly clear, as Professor
Kolko has admirably shown, that
the war is far from over.

Haynsworth and Carswe/I. . ."

Vietnam itself had been reduced
to 226,000 men. The central
question is the point at which the
administration plans to slow down
or stop personnel withdrawals
from Vietnam and, above all,
what it intends to do with the

306,000 other troops stationed in
the Southeast Asia and the
Western Pacific who sustain the
war in the air and on the sea and
ground.
In Vietnam itself, Nixon's
public committment runs only
through next November, and
thereafter, General F.J. Kroesner,
the Pentagon's manpower
director, admitted to the House
Appropriations Committee last
April 26, "we have not been given
firm decisions." And the New
York Times reported earlier this
month that "no firm decision has
yet been made on the precise size,
composition or length of stay of
the so-called American 'residual
force'..lt's safe to say,
however, in view of the South
Vietnamese Army's
incompetence, that this "residual
force" will be of substantial size
and will remain in Vietnam for
some time. There has been very
little talk of reducing the number
of support troops in neighboring
Asian countries.

On the armaments and
technology side, the Air Force is
enlarging its AC-130 gunship
force. US Army ammunition
procurement costs, which fell
from $1.73 billion in fiscal 1970
to roughly $1.15 billion the
following year, will leap back to
$1.57 billion. The War in
Indochina accounts for the vast
bulk of this expenditure.
The full costs of the war for
fiscal 1972, ending next June 30,
are projected for at least $10
billion, and more probably $12
billion. There have been hints
recently that this figure could
even hit $14 billion. Compared to
the $15.3 billion spent on the war
in 1971, this year's outlays don't
constitute much of a reduction.
As the number of "protective
reaction" strikes against North
Vietnam is stepped up, and as the
bombing continues over the rest
of Indochina, it becomes
increasingly clear, as Professor
Kolko has admirably shown, that
the war is far from over.


. .brought to you by the same people who gave you
Haynsworth and Carswe/I. . ."
In an important article in the
October 9 issue of The New
Republic, Gabriel Kolko writes,
"Newspaper assertions that the
administration has accepted the
principle of total American troop
withdrawal from Vietnam have
begun to confuse desires with
reality. . .the cultivated illusion
that the President has a 'plan' for
which he requires public and
congressional patience is belied by
what the record shows to be a
quite deliberate policy of
protracted US military activity in
Indochina and a will to sustain the
war and the US presence there
indefinitely."
As Professor Kolko
convincingly proves, Nixon's
so-called "Vietnamization"
scheme has been a hoax ever since
it was first publicly enunciated on
November 3, 1969.
"Vietnamization," (South
Vietnamese Army troops take
over the ground fighting while US
bombers keep pounding away)
was largely a response to the
growing American anti-war
movement. It was designed to
quiet the American public, thus
enabling the US to maintain an
important military presence in
Vietnam for a long time to come.
"Vietnamization" in no way
meant a rapid and complete
withdrawal of all American
troops, planes, and ships from
Vietnam.
Secretary of the Army Stanley
Resor outlined this strategy in the
fall of 1969 in testimony before
the House Committee on
Appropriations: ". . .if we can
make it clear to the enemy that
we can reduce the level of the war
to something that the American
people will support for a
significant period," then the NLF
would "negotiate or possibly just
reduce the level of combat." At
the same hearings, in response to

Representative George Mahon's
question that "If Vietnamization
does not work, and if agreements
cannot be reached in the Paris
peace talks or otherwise, do you
foresee the possibility of an
escalation of the war in Vietnam,"
Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird
replied, "I would not rule out that
possibility completely."
Nixon's plan to "Vietnamize"
the ground fighting (not the air
war) has never been very
successful. The commitment to
maintain a high level of US

manpower in the Indochina
theater was acknowledged
throughout 1970. It was a
"pipedream," one Pentagon
officer commented in July of that
year, to believe Nixon would have
US forces down to 50,000 by the
end of 1971; 150,000 to 200,000
as late as 1972 was considered
much more likely. In July, 1970,
the New York Timess, summed up
the Pentagon's feelings when it
noted that rapid "pullouts would
cause the unraveling of the Saigon
government and its armed forces
and produce a military and
political collapse."
Meanwhile, the use of US
airpower was intensified. During
hearings for defense
appropriations for 1971, a
Pentagon official admitted under
intense questioning that the
Saigon air force was unable to
handle close air support and
interdiction, much less air defense
and other functions.
"Consequently," he said, "we

expect a significant I US] Air
Force commitment in Southeast
Asia for a considerable period of
time."
The overall American position
in Vietnam in late 1970 was
summed up by Admiral U.S.
Grant Sharp, the former head of
the Vietnam and Pacific theater
until 1968: "the American
presence in the Southeast Asia
area is going to be large for some
time to come."
By the end of 1970, it was felt
in Washington that the American

ff|
G\yy' INDOCHINA STUPV GROUP

public would accept continued US
involvement in the air, artillery,
and naval aspects of the war,
while demanding further ground
force reductions. In his January
29, 1971, news conference,
Secretary of State William P.
Rogers repeatedly stressed the
continuing role of airpower: "We
don't see any reason why there
should be any limit to the use of
that airpower. He [Nixon]
intends to use the airpower as he
sees fit. . .Our airpower is going to
be used to the maximum extent
necessary.. .for the safety of
Americans. .."

"Vietnamization" proceed in the
future? No one denies that as of

successful. The commitment to
maintain a high level of US

manpower in the Indochina
theater was acknowledged
throughout 1970. It was a
"pipedream," one Pentagon
officer commented in July of that
year, to believe Nixon would have
US forces down to 50,000 by the
end of 1971; 150,000 to 200,000
as late as 1972 was considered
much more likely. In July, 1970,
the New York Timess, summed up
the Pentagon's feelings when it
noted that rapid "pullouts would
cause the unraveling of the Saigon
government and its armed forces
and produce a military and
political collapse."
Meanwhile, the use of US
airpower was intensified. During
hearings for defense
appropriations for 1971, a
Pentagon official admitted under
intense questioning that the
Saigon air force was unable to
handle close air support and
interdiction, much less air defense
and other functions.
"Consequently," he said, "we

expect a significant I US] Air
Force commitment in Southeast
Asia for a considerable period of
time."
The overall American position
in Vietnam in late 1970 was
summed up by Admiral U.S.
Grant Sharp, the former head of
the Vietnam and Pacific theater
until 1968: "the American
presence in the Southeast Asia
area is going to be large for some
time to come."
By the end of 1970, it was felt
in Washington that the American

ff|
G\yy' INDOCHINA STUPV GROUP

public would accept continued US
involvement in the air, artillery,
and naval aspects of the war,
while demanding further ground
force reductions. In his January
29, 1971, news conference,
Secretary of State William P.
Rogers repeatedly stressed the
continuing role of airpower: "We
don't see any reason why there
should be any limit to the use of
that airpower. He [Nixon]
intends to use the airpower as he
sees fit. . .Our airpower is going to
be used to the maximum extent
necessary.. .for the safety of
Americans. .."
At what pace will
"Vietnamization" proceed in the
future? No one denies that as of
July, 1971, US troop strength in
Vietnam itself had been reduced
to 226,000 men. The central
question is the point at which the
administration plans to slow down
or stop personnel withdrawals
from Vietnam and, above all,
what it intends to do with the

306,000 other troops stationed in
the Southeast Asia and the
Western Pacific who sustain the
war in the air and on the sea and
ground.
In Vietnam itself, Nixon's
public committment runs only
through next November, and
thereafter, General F.J. Kroesner,
the Pentagon's manpower
director, admitted to the House
Appropriations Committee last
April 26, "we have not been given
firm decisions." And the New
York Times reported earlier this
month that "no firm decision has
yet been made on the precise size,
composition or length of stay of
the so-called American 'residual
force'..lt's safe to say,
however, in view of the South
Vietnamese Army's
incompetence, that this "residual
force" will be of substantial size
and will remain in Vietnam for
some time. There has been very
little talk of reducing the number
of support troops in neighboring
Asian countries.

On the armaments and
technology side, the Air Force is
enlarging its AC-130 gunship
force. US Army ammunition
procurement costs, which fell
from $1.73 billion in fiscal 1970
to roughly $1.15 billion the
following year, will leap back to
$1.57 billion. The War in
Indochina accounts for the vast
bulk of this expenditure.
The full costs of the war for
fiscal 1972, ending next June 30,
are projected for at least $10
billion, and more probably $12
billion. There have been hints
recently that this figure could
even hit $14 billion. Compared to
the $15.3 billion spent on the war
in 1971, this year's outlays don't
constitute much of a reduction.
As the number of "protective
reaction" strikes against North
Vietnam is stepped up, and as the
bombing continues over the rest
of Indochina, it becomes
increasingly clear, as Professor
Kolko has admirably shown, that
the war is far from over.


. .brought to you by the same people who gave you
Haynsworth and Carswe/I. . ."
In an important article in the
October 9 issue of The New
Republic, Gabriel Kolko writes,
"Newspaper assertions that the
administration has accepted the
principle of total American troop
withdrawal from Vietnam have
begun to confuse desires with
reality. . .the cultivated illusion
that the President has a 'plan' for
which he requires public and
congressional patience is belied by
what the record shows to be a
quite deliberate policy of
protracted US military activity in
Indochina and a will to sustain the
war and the US presence there
indefinitely."
As Professor Kolko
convincingly proves, Nixon's
so-called "Vietnamization"
scheme has been a hoax ever since
it was first publicly enunciated on
November 3, 1969.
"Vietnamization," (South
Vietnamese Army troops take
over the ground fighting while US
bombers keep pounding away)
was largely a response to the
growing American anti-war
movement. It was designed to
quiet the American public, thus
enabling the US to maintain an
important military presence in
Vietnam for a long time to come.
"Vietnamization" in no way
meant a rapid and complete
withdrawal of all American
troops, planes, and ships from
Vietnam.
Secretary of the Army Stanley
Resor outlined this strategy in the
fall of 1969 in testimony before
the House Committee on
Appropriations: ". . .if we can
make it clear to the enemy that
we can reduce the level of the war
to something that the American
people will support for a
significant period," then the NLF
would "negotiate or possibly just
reduce the level of combat." At
the same hearings, in response to

Representative George Mahon's
question that "If Vietnamization
does not work, and if agreements
cannot be reached in the Paris
peace talks or otherwise, do you
foresee the possibility of an
escalation of the war in Vietnam,"
Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird
replied, "I would not rule out that
possibility completely."
