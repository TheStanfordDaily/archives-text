Open Letter to:
Donald Kennedy, Chairman
Advisory Board
We were part of the audience
at Bruce Franklin's hearing on
Monday, October 18 and were
amazed at your comment: "I
won't accept any more wisecracks
from the Peanut Gallery" which
we considered to be not only
unheard-of but totally
inappropriate to the occasion.
We do not feel that any of us
in the audience (of whatever
political persuasion) should have
to be subjected to such
derogatory and insulting remarks.
We resent your constant
reprimands to people who react
only as human beings with normal
human feelings. We feel that this
kind of conduct reflects adversely
on your pose as a fair and
impartial judge...
We hope that this particular
"wisecrack" of yours is going to
be your last one to an audience
who has been very patient and
quiet during the proceedings.
We do expect an apology from
you today when the hearing
resumes at 1:00 p.m. We will be
there.

I would like to challenge a
statement made by Tony Bollen
in an article entitled "Lyman
Neutral On Hoover" in The Daily
of Oct. 20th. Mr. Bollen stated
that "15 to 20 students heckled
speakers" at the Hoover
Institute's conference on Iran on
Monday, Oct. 18th. At this time
twenty of the protestors have
been identified to me and only
five are Stanford students. Four
others are faculty or staff, and the
11 remaining individuals have no
connection with the University.
In addition, of the six persons
whose disruptive actions were the
most persistent and the most
obnoxious, only one has any
connection with the University,
and that individual has previously
been convicted by the Stanford
Judicial Council for similar
actions at Henry Cabot Lodge's
address in Dinkelspiel Auditorium
on January 11, 1971. Monday's
incident is unfortunately typical
of many others in recent years at
Stanford, where a small but vocal
minority composed largely of
outsiders has attempted to force
its perverted sense of free speech
on the entire University
community.

Revolutionary Violence
Editor, THE DAILY
Professor Franklin's
acknowledgment in his testimony
Tuesday that he believes in the
need for "revolutionary violence"

and his reference to
window-breaking at Stanford as
an example of such necessary and
justifiable violence went
unreported both by KZSU in its
10 o'clock news Tuesday night
and in Wednesday's Daily. There
are hundreds of students new to
this campus who are unaware of
Professor Franklin's openly
acknowledged belief that the
political process in this country is
hopeless and that only through
revolutionary violence can a just
society be established.
Particularly for these people
but also to keep the central issue
in the Franklin case in focus for
the community as a whole, it
would be useful if the Daily and
KZSU gave a fuller account of Mr.
Fisher's cross-examination
Tuesday and Professor Franklin's
replies. For they bear directly on
the central issue of this case which
is not Professor Franklin's
loathing of the loathsome war in
Vietnam or of racial injustice in
this country or of police brutality
in this country but: did Professor
Franklin, obviously a man of
sincere conviction, act on those
convictions and encourage or join
his comrades in the
"revolutionary violence" which
occurred in the incidents in
connection with which charges
have been brought against him.

I think that all of you who
have agreed to carry the column
"Dear Ronnie" have really been
taken by an all-time con man.
"Dear" indeed!—for a man who
has all but ruined California
education, and who has spread
hatred for students and the young
since he started running for office.
He is your worst enemy, and you

are providing him a platform now
to get the 18 year old vote. He
never was interested in such a
column before, was he? And it's
all stacked for him. He can pick
the questions he wants, and get
his slick boys to write the
propaganda. You have agreed not
to edit them, so they have the
final crooked word. You can't
really say much in a question, and
you KNOW how he can twist
anything. You are helping to
launch that miserable actor on a
new career—as Vice President or
Senator. Thanks, suckers.
—Mrs. C.O. Bey
ps. The title "Dear Ronnie" is a
stroke of PR genius. It depicts the
jolly, funsy, boyish, popular and
beloved Governor we all know so
well. Bullshit!!
(The Daily announced last
week it would not run the
Governor's column on a regular
basis.—Ed.)

for his bellicose attachment to the
lost imperial cause] 1. militant,
unreasoning, and boastful
devotion to one's country;
fanatical patriotism; jingoism. 2.

race, sex, etc. with contempt for

10 o'clock news Tuesday night
and in Wednesday's Daily. There
are hundreds of students new to
this campus who are unaware of
Professor Franklin's openly
acknowledged belief that the
political process in this country is
hopeless and that only through
revolutionary violence can a just
society be established.
Particularly for these people
but also to keep the central issue
in the Franklin case in focus for
the community as a whole, it
would be useful if the Daily and
KZSU gave a fuller account of Mr.
Fisher's cross-examination
Tuesday and Professor Franklin's
replies. For they bear directly on
the central issue of this case which
is not Professor Franklin's
loathing of the loathsome war in
Vietnam or of racial injustice in
this country or of police brutality
in this country but: did Professor
Franklin, obviously a man of
sincere conviction, act on those
convictions and encourage or join
his comrades in the
"revolutionary violence" which
occurred in the incidents in
connection with which charges
have been brought against him.

I think that all of you who
have agreed to carry the column
"Dear Ronnie" have really been
taken by an all-time con man.
"Dear" indeed!—for a man who
has all but ruined California
education, and who has spread
hatred for students and the young
since he started running for office.
He is your worst enemy, and you

are providing him a platform now
to get the 18 year old vote. He
never was interested in such a
column before, was he? And it's
all stacked for him. He can pick
the questions he wants, and get
his slick boys to write the
propaganda. You have agreed not
to edit them, so they have the
final crooked word. You can't
really say much in a question, and
you KNOW how he can twist
anything. You are helping to
launch that miserable actor on a
new career—as Vice President or
Senator. Thanks, suckers.

ps. The title "Dear Ronnie" is a
stroke of PR genius. It depicts the

well. Bullshit!!

We were part of the audience
at Bruce Franklin's hearing on
Monday, October 18 and were
amazed at your comment: "I
won't accept any more wisecracks
from the Peanut Gallery" which
we considered to be not only
unheard-of but totally
inappropriate to the occasion.
We do not feel that any of us
in the audience (of whatever
political persuasion) should have
to be subjected to such
derogatory and insulting remarks.
We resent your constant
reprimands to people who react
only as human beings with normal
human feelings. We feel that this
kind of conduct reflects adversely
on your pose as a fair and
impartial judge...
We hope that this particular
"wisecrack" of yours is going to
be your last one to an audience
who has been very patient and
quiet during the proceedings.
We do expect an apology from
you today when the hearing
resumes at 1:00 p.m. We will be
there.

I would like to challenge a
statement made by Tony Bollen
in an article entitled "Lyman
Neutral On Hoover" in The Daily
of Oct. 20th. Mr. Bollen stated
that "15 to 20 students heckled
speakers" at the Hoover
Institute's conference on Iran on
Monday, Oct. 18th. At this time
twenty of the protestors have
been identified to me and only
five are Stanford students. Four
others are faculty or staff, and the
11 remaining individuals have no
connection with the University.
In addition, of the six persons
whose disruptive actions were the
most persistent and the most
obnoxious, only one has any
connection with the University,
and that individual has previously
been convicted by the Stanford
Judicial Council for similar
actions at Henry Cabot Lodge's
address in Dinkelspiel Auditorium
on January 11, 1971. Monday's
incident is unfortunately typical
of many others in recent years at
Stanford, where a small but vocal
minority composed largely of
outsiders has attempted to force
its perverted sense of free speech
on the entire University
community.

We were part of the audience
at Bruce Franklin's hearing on
Monday, October 18 and were
amazed at your comment: "I
won't accept any more wisecracks
from the Peanut Gallery" which
we considered to be not only
unheard-of but totally
inappropriate to the occasion.
We do not feel that any of us
in the audience (of whatever
political persuasion) should have
to be subjected to such
derogatory and insulting remarks.
We resent your constant
reprimands to people who react
only as human beings with normal
human feelings. We feel that this
kind of conduct reflects adversely
on your pose as a fair and
impartial judge...
We hope that this particular
"wisecrack" of yours is going to
be your last one to an audience
who has been very patient and
quiet during the proceedings.
We do expect an apology from
you today when the hearing
resumes at 1:00 p.m. We will be
there.

Hoover Free Speech
Editor, THE DAILY:
I would like to challenge a
statement made by Tony Bollen
in an article entitled "Lyman
Neutral On Hoover" in The Daily
of Oct. 20th. Mr. Bollen stated
that "15 to 20 students heckled
speakers" at the Hoover
Institute's conference on Iran on
Monday, Oct. 18th. At this time
twenty of the protestors have
been identified to me and only
five are Stanford students. Four
others are faculty or staff, and the
11 remaining individuals have no
connection with the University.
In addition, of the six persons
whose disruptive actions were the
most persistent and the most
obnoxious, only one has any
connection with the University,
and that individual has previously
been convicted by the Stanford
Judicial Council for similar
actions at Henry Cabot Lodge's
address in Dinkelspiel Auditorium
on January 11, 1971. Monday's
incident is unfortunately typical
of many others in recent years at
Stanford, where a small but vocal
minority composed largely of
outsiders has attempted to force
its perverted sense of free speech
on the entire University
community.

Revolutionary Violence
Editor, THE DAILY
Professor Franklin's
acknowledgment in his testimony
Tuesday that he believes in the
need for "revolutionary violence"

and his reference to
window-breaking at Stanford as
an example of such necessary and
justifiable violence went
unreported both by KZSU in its
10 o'clock news Tuesday night
and in Wednesday's Daily. There
are hundreds of students new to
this campus who are unaware of
Professor Franklin's openly
acknowledged belief that the
political process in this country is
hopeless and that only through
revolutionary violence can a just
society be established.
Particularly for these people
but also to keep the central issue
in the Franklin case in focus for
the community as a whole, it
would be useful if the Daily and
KZSU gave a fuller account of Mr.
Fisher's cross-examination
Tuesday and Professor Franklin's
replies. For they bear directly on
the central issue of this case which
is not Professor Franklin's
loathing of the loathsome war in
Vietnam or of racial injustice in
this country or of police brutality
in this country but: did Professor
Franklin, obviously a man of
sincere conviction, act on those
convictions and encourage or join
his comrades in the
"revolutionary violence" which
occurred in the incidents in
connection with which charges
have been brought against him.

I think that all of you who
have agreed to carry the column
"Dear Ronnie" have really been
taken by an all-time con man.
"Dear" indeed!—for a man who
has all but ruined California
education, and who has spread
hatred for students and the young
since he started running for office.
He is your worst enemy, and you

are providing him a platform now
to get the 18 year old vote. He
never was interested in such a
column before, was he? And it's
all stacked for him. He can pick
the questions he wants, and get
his slick boys to write the
propaganda. You have agreed not
to edit them, so they have the
final crooked word. You can't
really say much in a question, and
you KNOW how he can twist
anything. You are helping to
launch that miserable actor on a
new career—as Vice President or
Senator. Thanks, suckers.
—Mrs. C.O. Bey
ps. The title "Dear Ronnie" is a
stroke of PR genius. It depicts the
jolly, funsy, boyish, popular and
beloved Governor we all know so
well. Bullshit!!
(The Daily announced last
week it would not run the
Governor's column on a regular
basis.—Ed.)
