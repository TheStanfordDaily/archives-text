## Not Political Prisoners 
### 
I have been watching our hagiographers at work on George
Jackson, and he's finely tuned to their purpose—young, articulate,
black and, now, a putative martyr. But I wonder if we can any longer
afford our myths, our Lives of Saints or our horror stories, and if it's
not imperative that we begin to tell each other the plain truth.
Jackson did stand for something. He played out once again the
bleak and apparently hopeless drama of the individual versus the
State. It's clear to me that he meant to put a bloody and forgettable
period to the unequal contest. He wasn't running anywhere when he
was shot—there's no way out down the hill toward which he was
heading. How could he have hoped to scale a twenty-foot wall?
I know this because I spent many years in San Quentin as a
prisoner. I am intimately familiar with life and death in California
prisons, and because of the special knowledge this has given me 1 am
often appalled at the mistaken assumptions, exaggerations, and,
sometimes, outright lies on which liberal and radical writers base their
current outrage at prison conditions.
At the risk of being thought an apologist for the California
Department of Corrections, I would like to set down some
considerations which are being glossed over if considered at all.
It is being said that Jackson was a political prisoner because he was
sentenced on a charge for which a white man of nineteen would have
received probation. I'm inclined to agree that there are areas in
California where blacks are not treated impartially, but the suggestion
of systematic political prejudice is absurd. Probation is always a
desperate gamble and robbery, even second-degree, is treated gingerly.
Further, Jackson had an extensive juvenile record, and for robbery,
and had already served time in the California Youth Authority.
The second leg of the political-prisoner hypothesis is the abnormal
length of Jackson's confinement. Jackson would have been eligible for
parole within a year, and if his prison record had been simply average,
would have been paroled at the end of three years, possibly four. He
could have been something of a disciplinary problem, and still been
out in five.
It's possible to slip through San Quentin as a gray shadow and you
are caught in the works of some mindless automated factory—after a
certain period, not knowing what else to do, it disgorges you. This is

assuming you want out. Not all prisoners do, or, rather, freedom is
not their priority. But now we are examining a function of choice. It's
possible to imagine that Jackson drove himself against the prison, the
symbol of a hated and alien society, as a revolutionary act, but I have
witnessed similar rebellions by white prisoners that rose out of
nothing more than a smouldering hatred of all authority. Assuming
Jackson's actions were revolutionary in nature, what were the prison
officials supposed to do—permit his protest? Permit him to kill? What
of those other deaths? Were the California authorities so set on
Jackson's murder that they killed five other men to cover their tracks?
How can this be made creditable? Yet clearly those five corpses were
no obstacle to those who accepted the theory of Jackson's murder.
Equally, why isn't it considered that those men who rose up to
demand their rights ai Attica had never been so delicate about the
rights, the property and even the lives of others? Why isn't it noted
that their play-acting and posturing, the immediate formation of a
military organization in their ranks, looks like nothing so much as an
attempt to copy that which they so bitterly protested?
Jackson's fate, the fate of those at Attica and prisoners throughout
our country is dreadful and it cries out for reform, but to distort fact,
to encourage false myth does not correct an evil, but only creates
another. We should suspect any martyr as much as we should suspect
our need to have him.
