# should all veterans
## Support All Wars? 
### 
We, as members of the
Veterans for Peace, don't think
so. From our own experience, we
have seen the waste and suffering
that war causes. In the eyes of the
world and increasingly in the eyes
of our own citizens, the waging of
war is no longer an acceptable
means of conducting foreign
policy, protecting our
international interests, or
requiring national service from
our youth.
Consequently, rather than
taking a camping trip on the
forthcoming 3-day "Veterans"
weekend, veterans from the entire
Bay-area will be participating in
two important events.
Specifically, Congressman Ron
Dellums, Congressman Don
Edwards, and Congressman Phil
Burton will join veterans in a
Memorial Service at the Presidio
Military Cemetery at 11 a.m., on
Monday, October 25. This
memorial service, jointly called by
San Francisco, Berkeley/Oakland,
and Palo Alto Veterans for Peace
will be a solemn commemoration
for the veterans who died and

continue to die in a useless war.
Veterans, in dress uniform,
will be attending from areas as far
away as Seattle and Los Angeles,
to hear three speakers: Judy
Keyes, a widow of a veteran lost
in Vietnam, who was awarded a
Gold Star Medal; a Vietnamese
national; and an injured veteran.
A large group of veterans, out
of the 55 0 veterans attending
Stanford, will leave Monday
morning at 9:30 from the
Stanford Circle to participate in
this important and
constitutionally-legal action.
In addition a second event is
planned for those veterans who
still like parades. Seriously, the
Veterans' Collective, Vets for
Jobs, and Vets for Peace will be
meeting at noon on Sunday,
October 24, in front of the San
Francisco Civic Center Reviewing
Stand before marching in the
"Veterans Day Parade." While the
Establishment called the parade,
permission has been received for
veterans, who believe in peace,
and for their friends and families
to join in this march.

Stanford Veterans are urging
participation in these two events
because those of us who have
returned to civilian life, some with
injuries and physical disabilities,
have paid the price of patriotism
and should express our desire for
peace and meaningful military
reform. We are in a position to
draw attention for future
correction, to the inadequacies,
insensitivities, and racism in the
military. Since we all have lost
fellow servicemen in combat, we
know the price of supporting a
phony one-man "democracy."
In light of the "establishment,"
non-critical actions and attitudes
of the VFW, Veterans for Foreign
Wars, and the American Legion, a
new organization is needed to
represent more moderate and
rational views of younger
veterans. Veterans for Peace is
such an organization. While we
have members from World War I,
World War 11, and the Korean
Conflict, the most energetic vets
are those who have recently
returned from Vietnam.
Thus, a new, open, and visible
veterans organization is emerging
to pressure Congress, the military,
and the President to incorporate
needed humanistic and
organizational reforms in any
future change in the armed forces.
Veterans organizations like Vets
for Peace and its affiliated sister
organization, Vietnam Veterans
Against the War, are needed in
view of the Pentagon's push for a
"Professional" All-Voluntary
(VOLAR) Army. While disposal
of the draft may be necessary,

veterans should push to prevent
the continuation and
reinforcement of a United States
professional militaristic armed
forces system, such as found in
many of the Latin American
countries.
We hope that veterans are not
co-opted by the 3-day holiday,
but will feel free to join us
Sunday at the San Francisco Civic
Center for the Veterans Day
Parade, and on Monday morning
at the Presidio Military Cemetery
for the Memorial Service.

We, as members of the
Veterans for Peace, don't think
so. From our own experience, we
have seen the waste and suffering
that war causes. In the eyes of the
world and increasingly in the eyes
of our own citizens, the waging of
war is no longer an acceptable
means of conducting foreign
policy, protecting our
international interests, or
requiring national service from
our youth.
Consequently, rather than
taking a camping trip on the
forthcoming 3-day "Veterans"
weekend, veterans from the entire
Bay-area will be participating in
two important events.
Specifically, Congressman Ron
Dellums, Congressman Don
Edwards, and Congressman Phil
Burton will join veterans in a
Memorial Service at the Presidio
Military Cemetery at 11 a.m., on
Monday, October 25. This
memorial service, jointly called by
San Francisco, Berkeley/Oakland,
and Palo Alto Veterans for Peace
will be a solemn commemoration
for the veterans who died and

continue to die in a useless war.
Veterans, in dress uniform,
will be attending from areas as far
away as Seattle and Los Angeles,
to hear three speakers: Judy
Keyes, a widow of a veteran lost
in Vietnam, who was awarded a
Gold Star Medal; a Vietnamese
national; and an injured veteran.
A large group of veterans, out
of the 55 0 veterans attending
Stanford, will leave Monday
morning at 9:30 from the
Stanford Circle to participate in
this important and
constitutionally-legal action.
In addition a second event is
planned for those veterans who
still like parades. Seriously, the
Veterans' Collective, Vets for
Jobs, and Vets for Peace will be
meeting at noon on Sunday,
October 24, in front of the San
Francisco Civic Center Reviewing
Stand before marching in the
"Veterans Day Parade." While the
Establishment called the parade,
permission has been received for
veterans, who believe in peace,
and for their friends and families
to join in this march.

Stanford Veterans are urging
participation in these two events
because those of us who have
returned to civilian life, some with
injuries and physical disabilities,
have paid the price of patriotism
and should express our desire for
peace and meaningful military
reform. We are in a position to
draw attention for future
correction, to the inadequacies,
insensitivities, and racism in the
military. Since we all have lost
fellow servicemen in combat, we
know the price of supporting a
phony one-man "democracy."
In light of the "establishment,"
non-critical actions and attitudes
of the VFW, Veterans for Foreign
Wars, and the American Legion, a
new organization is needed to
represent more moderate and
rational views of younger
veterans. Veterans for Peace is
such an organization. While we
have members from World War I,
World War 11, and the Korean
Conflict, the most energetic vets
are those who have recently
returned from Vietnam.
Thus, a new, open, and visible
veterans organization is emerging
to pressure Congress, the military,
and the President to incorporate
needed humanistic and
organizational reforms in any
future change in the armed forces.
Veterans organizations like Vets
for Peace and its affiliated sister
organization, Vietnam Veterans
Against the War, are needed in
view of the Pentagon's push for a
"Professional" All-Voluntary
(VOLAR) Army. While disposal
of the draft may be necessary,

veterans should push to prevent
the continuation and
reinforcement of a United States
professional militaristic armed
forces system, such as found in
many of the Latin American
countries.
We hope that veterans are not
co-opted by the 3-day holiday,
but will feel free to join us
Sunday at the San Francisco Civic
Center for the Veterans Day
Parade, and on Monday morning
at the Presidio Military Cemetery
for the Memorial Service.
