## Nuclear Warfare & Stanford 
### 
Specifications for protective devices to shield
Air Force pilots on nuclear bombing missions and
quite possibly infantrymen engaged in tactical
nuclear warfare are being researched at Stanford
by Dr. Heinrich Rose (Surgery) for the
Department of Defense.
With the development of Hiroshima-size tactical
nuclear artillery and missiles suitable for
counterinsurgency warfare, the immediate
applications of anti-nuclear protective devices in
wars such as Vietnam are particularly frightening.
Protected against the visual effects of nuclear
weapons, infantrymen could work in much closer
conjunction with tactical nuclear weapons. This
distinct possibility fits in rather nicely with
Nixon's Vietnam game plan of escalated
technological war in Vietnam.
To determine the specifications for nuclear
protection devices Dr. Rose plans to subject
human volunteers to a series of successive
simulated nuclear flashes of escalating intensities
produced by a SRI custom-built Xenon Arc Lamp.
Following the visual flashes, retinal damage in the
eyes of the volunteers will be diagnosed and put to
use by the DOD in the development of protective
devices for nuclear warfare. (See page 231 of the
SWOPSI report on DOD research at Stanford.)
ALL volunteers for the experiment, according to
the DOD, are people who are going blind and
consequently will be having their eyes removed
shortly after the experiment in any case.
At this time, The Stanford Research Institute
has completed construction of the devices and
concurrent experimentation with animals under
the direction of R.C. Honey, manager of SRl's
Electromagnetic Techniques Laboratory, but the
actual experimentation on humans has not yet
started, stated Rose. According to the contract,
"the lamps used resemble the optical radiation
from nuclear weapons."
The SWOPSI report states that funding for the
project began in 1969 and peaks in mid-1972.
Human volunteers are needed "to acquire
essential human data," states the DOD. Previous
information concerning retinal damage from
nuclear flashes was merely "based on animal data
extrapolated to humans and on limited human
data extrapolated to high exposure levels."
Apparently this Stanford contract has the
distinction of being the first comprehensive
exposure of living human eyes to simulated
nuclear flashes.
The official DOD description of the Air
Force-sponsored contract states, on page 231 of
the SWOPSI report, "Predictions of eye safe
separation distances are required for operational
analysis and mission planning and by research
personnel for evaluating eye protection devices
and requirements" (for use by whom?). "The
objective of this effort is to determine threshold
levels of radiant energy for permanent eye damage
in humans. Data will be applied in assessing man's

response in a nuclear environment for s/v analysis
of weapons systems."
Dr. Rose, when contacted, stated that his
primary concern was not with the military
applications of the contract. In his words, "that's
their (DOD) business." His area of concern was
with the possible non-military applications, he
stated.
The Medical Center refused to divulge
information concerning Rose's background, but
research associate Dr. H. Christian Zweng stated
that Dr. Rose was brought from Germany by the
U.S. military following WWII to work on atomic
projects including the huge blasts at Los Alamos,
New Mexico.
Stanford Hospital officials stated on Tuesday,
Oct. 19, that Rose's contract had been approved in
1967 by the Hospital's Committee on the Use of
Human Subjects. The use of humans was for the
experiment not considered unethical by the
spokesmen. They further stated that thypossible
applications of the research were outside their
realm of competence.
The outrageous nature of this Stanford contract
with its rather questionable use of human beings as
experimentation subjects and its direct application
in making nuclear bombing missions "safer" for
Air Force pilots and tactical nuclear operations
"safer" for infantrymen make Lyman's
self-righteous denunciation of campus violence
almost laughable. Almost.
Dr. Rose's DOD contract is only one of the
many acts of violence committed daily by
Stanford University. Other acts of violence in the
form of DOD contracts deal in such academic
subjects as laser weapons, missile guidance,
weapons components, stabilizers for gun platforms
on helicopters, night sight for counterinsurgency
use, psychological devices to pre> ent disruptive
behavior in the Armed Forces, and many others. A
complete list and a description of each contract
can be obtained in the SWOPSI report on DOD
research at Stanford available in the SWOPSI
office. Anyone still believing in the myth of an
academic, nonpolitical Stanford University will
find his illusions thoroughly shattered.
Anyone interested specifically in Dr. Rose's
contract can call his office at 32 1 -2 300 ext. 58 44
or drop by his office, room SO3O, in the Med
Center. The official DOD statement concerning his
contract and the SWOPSI summary can be found
on page 231 of the SWOPSI report under the DOD
title "Aircrew Visual Impairment/Injury
thresholds from Nuclear Weapons."
Next week the Association of Young Crows will
be holding the Reds' Hot Professor Contest to
determine the Stanford community's favorite war
research contract. People will have an opportunity
to vote for their Red Hot Professor from a list of
the Top Twenty DOD war researchers and
contracts at Stanford. Winners will receive suitable
prizes. I hereby pledge my vote to Dr. H.W. Rose.

(This young crow is a
candidate for student senate and
cannot be identified now, but will
do so after the election.)
