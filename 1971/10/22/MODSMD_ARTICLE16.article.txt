## Mellor Combines Roles 
### JODY SINDELAR 
A typical English professor: young,
good-looking and female? Well, maybe
that's not typical, but it is a reality
manifested in Professor Anne
Kostelantz Mellor.
Mellor is one of the few professional
academic women on campus. Her
credentials are impressive: she has
served twice on the Faculty Senate (the
first woman to serve) and has now been
appointed to one of the top faculty
committees—the Committee on
Committees.
One of Mellor's primary interests at
the moment is the position of women
at Stanford. She was instrumental in
obtaining a more flexible policy for
women professors.
Two of the basic changes that have
been passed are: a tenure delay for each
child and a maternity leave for women.
These changes will make it easier for
women staff to have a full family life.
"The maternity leave has equal
standing with a sabbatical leave. It will
make it professionally acceptable for a

woman to tak<> time off to have
children," Mellor explained.
She is currently lobbying for a plan
now under consideration to establish a
part-time tenure ladder for women
professors.
Mini-Skirted Radical
In 1968, Mellor was headlined as a
mini-skirted radical when she
campaigned against academic credit for
R.O.T.C. Her political views are not,
however, revolutionary. "I am one of
the many liberal faculty members," s'-ie
stated.
Mellor feels that being a woman has
probably been an asset to her carerr. At
the present time she believes that
people are attempting to rectify
previous oppression. "I might not have
been re-elected to the Senate at this
time if I were not a woman," she
explained.
Professor Mellor's life-style
combines being a professional woman
with being a wife and mother. "Perhaps
this may be my finest achievement—l
recently gave birth to my first child, a
boy named Blake," she stated.
She has thus become one of
Stanford's leading "role models" for
female undergraduate and graduate
students.
The fact that her son's name is Blake
becomes significant when you know
that she currently has a book at the
publishers dealing with the poetry and
art of William Blake.
Emotional Support
Three years ago Anne Kostelantz (as
she was then) married Ron Mellor, a
professor of Classics at Stanford.
Instead of hindering her teaching, her
marriage has bepn "an emotional and
intellectual support," she explained. It
has added to her individual well-being
and also enhanced her teaching.
She and her husband share the work
of taking care of the baby. He teaches
in the morning and takes care of the
child in the afternoon. Her schedule is
complementary.
They share the work in other ways
too. Anne Mellor was a professor at the
Stanford-in-Britain campus in 1969-70.
Ron Mellor came with her.and spent his
time doing research in London libraries.
This spring he will be the active
professor when they are at
Stanford-in-Italy.
Mellor practices another successful
combination. She is integrating her
current interest in women with her
teaching career. This winter quarter
Mellor will teach a course on Women in
English Literature.
The course will examine the two
major literary images of women, the
inhuman madonna/patient Griselda and
the all-too-human shrew/whore, and
compare these stereotypes to the
historical conditions of women in
England.
Women writers who attempted to
escape these cliches will also be studied.
Professor Mellor graduated from
Brown University in 1963. Although
she started out in applied mathematics,
she ended up majoring in literature and
philosophy.


MISOGYNIST—Sigmund Freud, "father" of psychology, with his wife Martha
during their engagement. When she expressed interest in a career, he wrote her,
"Am I to think of my sweet darling girl as a competition?" Women psychologists
are now attempting to overcome this anti-woman bias, which they feel has
permeated psychology.


PROFESSOR—Anne Mellor, Professor of English, with her son Blake. Mellor, one
of the few women professors at Stanford, has been working to achieve maternity
leaves for women faculty.
