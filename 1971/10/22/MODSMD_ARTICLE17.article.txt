### 
before a woman becomes grown
if she's black and poor
she learns that the world
is cold ready to rape you of everything
if a blackgirlchild wants to ever
become free she has to really
struggle like we did
shouts of hatred
and screams of amerikan
misunderstanding
prison can make you look back on a
lifetime
of bitterness. . .
handed-down-clothes—
cold winter nights
—for whites only
colored served here
etc.-
memories only other black women
could understand
understand
fully
of trying to be what ain't
of try to see what's not
of trying to rid ourselves of what
never was
of men crying
of children dying
of abortions-just because. . .
memories that harsh and cruel of
alleyways
where people live
of "police" who not only attack with
weapons
but with words (which you cannot
combat)
-if you're black and poor and
female
like my mama
like me and my sisters
