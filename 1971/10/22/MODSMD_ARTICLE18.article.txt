# Women Change Psych

### MADELINE NELSON 
Having liberated Dr. Spock, the women's movement can
now turn their attention to those wonderful people who
gave us penis envy.
The newly-founded Western Association for Women in
Psychology is meeting in Berkeley this Saturday. The
day-long program will feature symposia on the changing
identity of Women (led by Drs. Sandra and Daryl Bern of
Stanford's psychology department), women in therapy, the
legal rights of women, and the psychology of women.
Lunch will feature three distinguished women in
psychology, including Stanford Professor Eleanor Maccoby.
According to Dr. Carol Jacklin, professor of psychology
at Stanford, the Association represents an important new
development in psychology.
"The psychological study of women has always been
done by men" Jacklin explained. "Generally they used a
non-scientific approach, and they seemed to study only
deviant women."
"The study of women has now gotten to be a hot area in
psychology and that's a good thing," she added.
Away From Freud
Maccoby believes that the psychological interpretation
of women is changing rapidly as therapists begin to move
away from a Freudian viewpoint.
"Freud didn't understand women and he knew he didn't
understand them," she explained.
"He felt that they should adjust to stereotyped roles as
wives and mothers. He assumed that women are passive and
masochistic and that this is based on biological
differences," she added.
Maccoby is hopeful that therapy is today moving away
from these concepts of women.
"Psychiatric therapy should take a different role," she
explained. "Instead of helping women to adjust to the
traditional role, therapy should help them achieve their
potential."
Natural Differences?
Maccoby is not, however, willing to believe that there
are no natural differences between the sexes.
"Some people today are saying that sex differences have
no relation to the life we lead except for those functions
which are specifically tied to the genital area," she stated.
"Based on my own research and other people's, I believe
that there are temperamental differences, but people
haven't drawn the right conclusions about these
differences," she added.
"Based on what I know, I don't think there is any innate
difference in terms of passivity. Little girls don't cling to

their mothers any more than little boys do. There's also no
difference in activity level."
However, Maccoby does perceive a difference in
aggressive behavior. "Among young children, males hit
more and retaliate more. There are good and bad aspects to
this," she said.
Professor Sandra Bern, also of the Stanford Psychology
Department, has reservations about the relevance of
research such as Maccoby is doing.
Although she does not think the research should be
stopped, Bern is worried about the consequences of
biological studies and the use that might be made of the
results.
Better Boxers
"If men are found to be more physically aggressive, this
should imply that they make better boxers, but it does not
mean they would make better lawyers," she says.
Sex roles rather than sex differences are the focus of
Bern's own work. "I believe some biological differences
probably exist, but they account for very little of the
drastic split between the sexes. I think it is more relevant to
study the parts women and men play in society," she
stated.
"I suggest that there may be masculine, feminine, and
androgenous people who have particular behavior
patterns," she added.
Maccoby agrees with this point. "Differences within the
same sex are at least as important as differences between
the two sexes," she said.
Active Role
Both Jacklin and Maccoby feel that the current women's
movement has had tremendous impact in another way: it
has inspired women psychologists to take a more active role
in their profession.
"Up until now women have been reluctant to help other
women," according to Maccoby. "This especially applies to
successful women. But now we're all getting together and
discovering that we like each other." â€¢
"When I first went to the women's caucus I was so
excited," Jacklin stated. "I was so used to being the only
woman in a group and here were all these people like me!"
So far the response to the newly-founded Association
has been excellent. "People are coming from as far away as
Nevada and Oregon," Jacklin said. "Our only problem may
be space, but that's a good problem to have."
The conference will take place from nine to five this
Saturday at the Wright Institute, 2728 Durant Avenue in
Berkeley. Registration is $2.00 ($l.OO for students.)
Male-run child care will be provided.
