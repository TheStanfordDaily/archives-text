# One Man's Impression
## Can't We Still Be Friends? 
### Fred Tileston 
Scene: A mild-mannered student (male)
walking slowly down the hallway of a
liberated Stanford dorm. He
approaches a door. He knocks on the
door (knock, knock). The door opens,
a Stanford Coed standing behind it.
Coed: Yes?
Mild-mannered student (male:) Yes,
um, I really like your body and I want
to go to bed with you.
Action: Mild-mannered student (male)
is viciously slapped across the face;
door slams shut.
Mild-mannered student (male):(towards
the door) Oh, by the way, so you don't
get the wrong impression, this is a
study being done for Psych 21.
Action: Mild-mannered student (male)
walks slowly down the nallway to the
next door.
Scene 2 : He (m-m-s-(m)) knocks on the
door (knock, knock). The door opens,
a Stanford Coed standing behind it.
Coed: Yes?
M-m-s-(m): Yes, um, I really like your
body and I want to go to bed with you.
M-m-s-(m): Action: Coed breaks out in
uncontrollable laughter; door slams
shut.
M-m-s-(m): (Toward the door) Oh, by
the way, so you don't get the wrong
impression, this is a study being done
by Psych 101.
Action: M-m-s-(m) walks slowly down
the hallway to the next door.

Scenes 3-54: Much the same as scenes
one and two except for the occasional
substitution of dumbfounded
expressions, total shock, exhortations
to study and one spontaneous orgasm
in the place of face-slapping and
laughter. Also, different numbers may
be substituted in the dialogue for the
numbers 21 and 101.
Scene 55: M-m-s-(m) walking slowly
down the hallway of a liberated
Stanford dorm. He approaches a door.
He knocks on the door (knock, knock).
The door opens, a Stanford Coed
standing behind it.
Coed: Yes?
M-m-s-(m): Yes, um, I really like your
body and I want to go to bed with you.

Coed: Sure, come on in.
Action: Coed and m-m-s-(m) both walk
toward the bed, take off clothes, turn
off light, and get in. M-m-s-(m) begins
to slowly move his mild-mannered
hands and body closer to the Coed.
Coed: What are you doing?!
Action: M-m-s-(m) says nothing and
continues to move in; his previous smug
look has now been replaced by one of
consternation however. He moves
closer in the bed, until there is a brief
touching. At this instant the m-m-s-(m)
is suddenly thrown out of the bed, the
Coed quickly dresses, and the light is
flashed on.
Coed: So that's what you were really
after!! Well I think you'd better leave.
Action: M-m-s-(m) is thrown out of the
room, clothes on top of him, and door
slams shut. Inside the room the Coed
turns to her coed roommate who has
been studying at her desk throughout
the scene.
Coed: Say, roomy, he was kinda cute
wasn't he?
Action: Mild-mannered
student-(male) transfers to Paly High,
mildly chuckling to himself on his way.
Moral: Stanford: you can knock, but
you can't knock up.
Moral (2): Stanford: better to have
laughed and left than to have never left
at all.
