Stanford alumnus- William H.
Rehnquist, 47, one of Nixon's
nominees to the Supreme Court, is
"very, very bright, and very
conservative," according to Stanford
law professor Gerald Gunther.
According to Law School Dean
Thomas Ehrlich, "We are proud and
happy that one of our alumni has been
nominated to the Supreme Court of the
United States."
If his nomination is confirmed,
Rehnquist will become the first
Stanford graduate to serve on the
highest court.
Rehnquist has a B.A. and an M.A.
from Stanford in 1948, and received an
L.L.B. (law degree) here in 1952. While
an undergraduate he lived and hashed
at Encina Hall, and was active in
football, baseball and swimming.
Brilliant Law Student
As a law student he worked on the
Stanford Law Review, and he
graduated first in his class. According
to one of his professors, George
Osborn, "He was the outstanding
student of his law school
generation. . .unusually able. . .n
brilliant law student."
Said another of his professors, John
Hurlbut, "I can state with complete
confidence that he is a man of
tremendous ability, great achievement,
and complete integrity."
From February 1952 until June
1953, he served as a law clerk for
Supreme Court Justice Robert H.
Jackson. Later, Rehnquist wrote two
controversial articles in "U.S. News and
World Report" reflecting back on his

experience as a clerk.
Wrote Rehnquist, "From what I
knew, the clerks taken as a whole were
left of center, and that it was possible
that their political views could to some
extent influence the action of the
Court in deciding whether to grant a
hearing in a particular case.. .Some of
the tenets of the 'liberal' point of view
which commanded the sympathy of a
majority of the clerks I knew were:
extreme solicitude for the claims of
Communists and other criminal
defendants, expansion of federal power
at the expense of State power, great
sympathy toward any government
regulation of businessâ€”in short, the
political philosophy now espoused by
the Court under Chief Justice Earl
Warren."
Left Bias of Law Clerks
"There is the possibility of the bias
of clerks affecting the Court's certiorari
work. . .and where such bias did have
any effect, because of the political
outlook of the group of clerks that I
knew, its direction would be to the
political left."
Rehnquist worked as an attorney in
Phoenix, Arizona for 16 years, after his
job as clerk, until 1969 when he was
tappsd by President Nixon to serve as
an assistant Attorney General. While in
Phoenix he served as Chairman for the
Maricopa County Bar Association and
of the Arizona Uniform Laws
Commission.
More recently he has described
radical protesters as "new barbarians"
and has criticized the Supreme Court as
lacking "common sense" in criminal
cases.
