Editor, Women's Page:
I would like to contribute a
comment to your Women's Forum.
I am glad I am a woman. And I
don't want any part of men's work or
anything else. What does that make
me? Oh yes, to those of you who will
say, "Equal pay for equal (man's)
jobs"â€”why don't you get women's
work? And let the men have theirs. Do
you want to see the MAN go?
