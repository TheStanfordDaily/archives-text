# Men's Lib
## Men Are Victims Too 
### Nathan Therien 
Women's liberationists, it seems to
me, often fail to recognize that just as
women are the victims of the
imposition upon them by society of a
sexual role, so men, too, have been
affected by the need to adopt the
society's conception of a male role.
For society requires that the male
take the initiative; in fact that he
become the sexual aggressor in any
given situation.
Of course, to take the initiative is to
risk rejection, while failing to act at all
is tantamount to taking monastic vows,
since—again due to social
"programming"—no "good girl" (and
most Stanford girls, I suspect, consider
themselves members of this category)
would ever venture to initiate
proceedings.
A question central to the issue of
women's liberation, 1 should think, is
why a horny guy is considered normal

while a horny girl is condemned—by
males and females alike—as a
nymphomaniac.
The dilemma facing an insecure,
sensitive male, is terrific: there is the
risk of rejection—which seems
particularly great at Stanford—on the
one hand: and frustration, anxiety and
even identity crisis on the other (for
the male, be it remembered, is
"programmed"—psychologically if not
biologically—to see sex as an integral
part of his existence without which he
is not whole.
The psychological burdens of
socially imposed sex roles weigh heavily
on men and women alike.
Compassionate understanding of our
mutual predicament—rather than the
accusatory and frenzied rhetoric which
usually billows forth from both sides of
the needless and inane "battle of the
sexes"—is the only real way out.
