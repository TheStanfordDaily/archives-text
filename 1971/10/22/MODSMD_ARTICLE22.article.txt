## How To Fix A Toilet 
### 
There are times when you can fix
plumbing yourself and times when it
needs a plumber. Generally if only one
fixture, such as a sink, is clogged you
can fix it. If more than one fixture is
involved (such as if drainage from the
toilet backs up into the bathtub) you
probably need a plumber. Luckily this
doesn't happen very often.
To fix a toilet you have to
understand how it works.
When the handle (1) is pulled, the
flushing arm (2) is lifted. This pulls the
wire lift rod (3) upwards. The wire lift
rod then pulls the ball valve (4) at the
base of the tank. When the ball valve
goes up, the water empties into the
bowl of the toilet as shown by the
arrow.
As the tank empties the float valve
(5) falls. This opens the water inlet
valve (6) which shoots water into the
tank.
As the tank refills the float valve
moves back up. When the float valve
has almost reached the top of the tank
the water inlet valve shuts off and the
toilet is ready to be flushed again.
Whistling Noise
Sometimes the float valve doesn't
quite go high enough to shut off the
inlet valve. This means that a little bit
of water keeps running through the
tank. The result is an irritating

whistling noise.
Often this can be stopped just by
jiggling the handle. If this doesn't work,
try bending the metal float arm so that
the float valve (5) is set a little deeper
in the water.
If this still doesn't work, the
problem is probably that the rubber
ball valve (4) doesn't plop right down
into the outlet hole after the tank
empties. Instead it lands slightly
off-center and doesn't seal off the
outlet.
Try adjusting the wire which holds
the ball valve. Another possibility is
that the ball valve is worn out. If you
can see a hole in it, buy a new one at
the hardware store.
Overflow
When the toilet overflows it is
because something is stuck inside it.
The object is usually stuck either at the
back of the bowl (A) or else if it gets
past this point it may lodge at the next
sharp bend (B).
You can often get the article
dislodged by unbending a coat hangar
and poking the hook end down the
bend of the toilet. Otherwise the best
thing to do is to use a plumber's helper.
(That's the tool with a rubber suction
cup on a wooden handle.) Put it at the
back of the toilet and push the handle
up and down.

toilet is ready to be flushed again.
Whistling Noise
Sometimes the float valve doesn't
quite go high enough to shut off the
inlet valve. This means that a little bit
of water keeps running through the
tank. The result is an irritating

whistling noise.
Often this can be stopped just by
jiggling the handle. If this doesn't work,
try bending the metal float arm so that
the float valve (5) is set a little deeper
in the water.
If this still doesn't work, the
problem is probably that the rubber
ball valve (4) doesn't plop right down
into the outlet hole after the tank
empties. Instead it lands slightly
off-center and doesn't seal off the
outlet.
Try adjusting the wire which holds
the ball valve. Another possibility is
that the ball valve is worn out. If you
can see a hole in it, buy a new one at
the hardware store.
Overflow
When the toilet overflows it is
because something is stuck inside it.
The object is usually stuck either at the
back of the bowl (A) or else if it gets
past this point it may lodge at the next
sharp bend (B).
You can often get the article
dislodged by unbending a coat hangar
and poking the hook end down the
bend of the toilet. Otherwise the best
thing to do is to use a plumber's helper.
(That's the tool with a rubber suction
cup on a wooden handle.) Put it at the
back of the toilet and push the handle
up and down.

There are times when you can fix
plumbing yourself and times when it
needs a plumber. Generally if only one
fixture, such as a sink, is clogged you
can fix it. If more than one fixture is
involved (such as if drainage from the
toilet backs up into the bathtub) you
probably need a plumber. Luckily this
doesn't happen very often.
To fix a toilet you have to
understand how it works.
When the handle (1) is pulled, the
flushing arm (2) is lifted. This pulls the
wire lift rod (3) upwards. The wire lift
rod then pulls the ball valve (4) at the
base of the tank. When the ball valve
goes up, the water empties into the
bowl of the toilet as shown by the
arrow.
As the tank empties the float valve
(5) falls. This opens the water inlet
valve (6) which shoots water into the
tank.
As the tank refills the float valve
moves back up. When the float valve
has almost reached the top of the tank
the water inlet valve shuts off and the
toilet is ready to be flushed again.
