# Human Bio Offers Exciting Profs
## 
### JAMES E. LOBSENZ 
The Human Biology Program,
initiated with fanfare two years
ago, has more than tripled its
enrollment in the last year. In
general, students involved are
satisfied with the program, but
they look forward to further
chances that they feel are
necessary to complete its
development.
The most outstanding feature
of the program is the high quality
of instruction. Nearly everyone
agrees that the "exciting"
professors gravitate towards
Human Biology. Another
interesting comment was that
Human Bio professors are, in
general, more politically active
than their fellow faculty
members.
Whether or not this is directly
related to their popularity is
debatable, but there is little
debate over the fact that
professors like Norman
Kretchmer, Colin S. Pittendrigh,
Donald Kennedy and Paul R.
Ehrlich are representative of the
kind of first class instruction
available in the program.
One of the chief improvements
made in the past year is the clear
cut delegation of authority and
responsibility among the members

of the faculty. Each course is now
under the sole direction of one
faculty member as opposed to
having two professors share
responsibility for one course, as
was the case last year.
One major problem is the
shortage of teachers. Only 18
faculty members, most of whom
have teaching duties in other
departments as well as research
and graduate responsibility,
handle the entire teaching load.
The faculty is, as Dr. Paul Ehrlich
puts it, a "mixed bag" much like
the Human Bio students. The
Committee in Charge of the
program has representatives from
not only the Biology Department
and the Medical School, but from
the Sociology and Psychology
departments as well.
The most popular aspect of the
program is the Human Bio
Workshop. The Workshop is
designed to give the student
practical experience in applying
biological principles in a working
situation. All projects are designed
by the students themselves. Some
recent examples are: "Research
with Starlings-Social Hierarchy,
Gonadal Growth, Rank and Peck
Order," "Radioactive Waste
Disposal at the Humboldt Bay
Power Plant," "Observation and

Assistance in Experimental
Cardio-Vascular Surgery," and
"Detoxification of Heroin
Addicts: Haight-Ashbury Clinic."
Some Drawbacks
Although the general picture of
the program at present is bright, it
is not without its drawbacks. Of
late it has been the object of
much criticism as well as praise.
Some students object to the large
class sizes and complain bitterly
about the program's inflexibility.
One student, who prefers to
remain anonymous, feels that the
rigid lecture-structured curriculum
has transformed the program into
a "passive learning process."
Others object to the rigidity of
the program's core courses, which
occupy eight units per term for
the entire sophomore year.
Another common student
complaint is that the program,
while providing a fine
comprehensive overview of several
disciplines, fails to provide a
deeper understanding of any one
particular field. The reply to this
criticism is that depth of
knowledge in one field should be
acquired by the student in
electives taken outside the Human
Biology Program in the junior and
senior years.
As for the material within the

program, opinion varies greatly.
Some students feel "spoon fed,"
others complain that they are
inundated with complexities of
scientific detail that they neither
need nor desire. Some complain
that the Human Bio major is not
sufficiently prepared for any one
field, and that special skills are
not developed. Others feel that
this kind of general
comprehensive education is
exactly what makes the program
worthwhile.
The Human Biology Program
was created in 1 968 by virtue of a
$1,936,000 Ford Foundation
grant. Initially the program,
according to Kretchmer, the
Chairman of the Committee in
Charge, was "aimed at the
creation of a human biologist who
is knowledgeable about man, his
function, behavior and social
patterns."
The members of the committee
in charge of the formation of the
program felt that the common ties
between the fields of behavior,
psychology, sociology and
biology, were not fully explored
in any of their respective
departments. The program was
conceived of, and has become, an
interdisciplinary effort that holds
interest for a wide variety of

students.
No Common Direction
Human Biology majors are by
no means headed solely for
medical school. A substantial
number of them are primarily
interested in obtaining a biological
approach to man that can be
applied to various sociological
fields such as economics, political
science and law. Others are
interested in bio-engineering,
philosophy or psychology. One
Human Bio major even aspires to
be a policeman.
It was felt also at the time, that
there was a great need for people
in modern society, regardless of
their field of expertise, who
understood and were concerned
with man's complex relationship
with nature. Dr. Kretchmer and
other members of the Committee
saw a definite demand for a
discipline that could prepare
future policy makers and citizens
with a solid understanding of
biological and behavioral
principles.
At present, the mood of the
faculty and students appears to be
one of cautious optimism. For a
program "built-from-scratch"
only three years ago, it seems to
be evolving into a very valuable
and stable one.

initiated with fanfare two years
ago, has more than tripled its
enrollment in the last year. In
general, students involved are
satisfied with the program, but
they look forward to further
chances that they feel are
necessary to complete its
development.
The most outstanding feature
of the program is the high quality
of instruction. Nearly everyone
agrees that the "exciting"
professors gravitate towards
Human Biology. Another
interesting comment was that
Human Bio professors are, in
general, more politically active
than their fellow faculty
members.
Whether or not this is directly
related to their popularity is
debatable, but there is little
debate over the fact that
professors like Norman
Kretchmer, Colin S. Pittendrigh,
Donald Kennedy and Paul R.
Ehrlich are representative of the
kind of first class instruction
available in the program.
One of the chief improvements
made in the past year is the clear
cut delegation of authority and
responsibility among the members

of the faculty. Each course is now
under the sole direction of one
faculty member as opposed to
having two professors share
responsibility for one course, as
was the case last year.
One major problem is the
shortage of teachers. Only 18
faculty members, most of whom
have teaching duties in other
departments as well as research
and graduate responsibility,
handle the entire teaching load.
The faculty is, as Dr. Paul Ehrlich
puts it, a "mixed bag" much like
the Human Bio students. The
Committee in Charge of the
program has representatives from
not only the Biology Department
and the Medical School, but from
the Sociology and Psychology
departments as well.
The most popular aspect of the
program is the Human Bio
Workshop. The Workshop is
designed to give the student
practical experience in applying
biological principles in a working
situation. All projects are designed
by the students themselves. Some
recent examples are: "Research
with Starlings-Social Hierarchy,
Gonadal Growth, Rank and Peck
Order," "Radioactive Waste
Disposal at the Humboldt Bay
Power Plant," "Observation and

Assistance in Experimental
Cardio-Vascular Surgery," and
"Detoxification of Heroin
Addicts: Haight-Ashbury Clinic."
Some Drawbacks
Although the general picture of
the program at present is bright, it
is not without its drawbacks. Of
late it has been the object of
much criticism as well as praise.
Some students object to the large
class sizes and complain bitterly
about the program's inflexibility.
One student, who prefers to
remain anonymous, feels that the
rigid lecture-structured curriculum
has transformed the program into
a "passive learning process."
Others object to the rigidity of
the program's core courses, which
occupy eight units per term for
the entire sophomore year.
Another common student
complaint is that the program,
while providing a fine
comprehensive overview of several
disciplines, fails to provide a
deeper understanding of any one
particular field. The reply to this
criticism is that depth of
knowledge in one field should be
acquired by the student in
electives taken outside the Human
Biology Program in the junior and
senior years.
As for the material within the

program, opinion varies greatly.
Some students feel "spoon fed,"
others complain that they are
inundated with complexities of
scientific detail that they neither
need nor desire. Some complain
that the Human Bio major is not
sufficiently prepared for any one
field, and that special skills are
not developed. Others feel that
this kind of general
comprehensive education is
exactly what makes the program
worthwhile.
The Human Biology Program
was created in 1 968 by virtue of a
$1,936,000 Ford Foundation
grant. Initially the program,
according to Kretchmer, the
Chairman of the Committee in
Charge, was "aimed at the
creation of a human biologist who
is knowledgeable about man, his
function, behavior and social
patterns."
The members of the committee
in charge of the formation of the
program felt that the common ties
between the fields of behavior,
psychology, sociology and
biology, were not fully explored
in any of their respective
departments. The program was
conceived of, and has become, an
interdisciplinary effort that holds
interest for a wide variety of

students.
No Common Direction
Human Biology majors are by
no means headed solely for
medical school. A substantial
number of them are primarily
interested in obtaining a biological
approach to man that can be
applied to various sociological
fields such as economics, political
science and law. Others are
interested in bio-engineering,
philosophy or psychology. One
Human Bio major even aspires to
be a policeman.
It was felt also at the time, that
there was a great need for people
in modern society, regardless of
their field of expertise, who
understood and were concerned
with man's complex relationship
with nature. Dr. Kretchmer and
other members of the Committee
saw a definite demand for a
discipline that could prepare
future policy makers and citizens
with a solid understanding of
biological and behavioral
principles.
At present, the mood of the
faculty and students appears to be
one of cautious optimism. For a
program "built-from-scratch"
only three years ago, it seems to
be evolving into a very valuable
and stable one.

enrollment in the last year. In
general, students involved are
satisfied with the program, but
they look forward to further
chances that they feel are
necessary to complete its
development.
The most outstanding feature
of the program is the high quality
of instruction. Nearly everyone
agrees that the "exciting"
professors gravitate towards
Human Biology. Another
interesting comment was that
Human Bio professors are, in
general, more politically active
than their fellow faculty
members.
Whether or not this is directly
related to their popularity is
debatable, but there is little
debate over the fact that
professors like Norman
Kretchmer, Colin S. Pittendrigh,
Donald Kennedy and Paul R.
Ehrlich are representative of the
kind of first class instruction
available in the program.
One of the chief improvements
made in the past year is the clear
cut delegation of authority and
responsibility among the members

of the faculty. Each course is now
under the sole direction of one
faculty member as opposed to
having two professors share
responsibility for one course, as
was the case last year.
One major problem is the
shortage of teachers. Only 18
faculty members, most of whom
have teaching duties in other
departments as well as research
and graduate responsibility,
handle the entire teaching load.
The faculty is, as Dr. Paul Ehrlich
puts it, a "mixed bag" much like
the Human Bio students. The
Committee in Charge of the
program has representatives from
not only the Biology Department
and the Medical School, but from
the Sociology and Psychology
departments as well.
The most popular aspect of the
program is the Human Bio
Workshop. The Workshop is
designed to give the student
practical experience in applying
biological principles in a working
situation. All projects are designed
by the students themselves. Some
recent examples are: "Research
with Starlings-Social Hierarchy,
Gonadal Growth, Rank and Peck
Order," "Radioactive Waste
Disposal at the Humboldt Bay
Power Plant," "Observation and

Assistance in Experimental
Cardio-Vascular Surgery," and
"Detoxification of Heroin
Addicts: Haight-Ashbury Clinic."
Some Drawbacks
Although the general picture of
the program at present is bright, it
is not without its drawbacks. Of
late it has been the object of
much criticism as well as praise.
Some students object to the large
class sizes and complain bitterly
about the program's inflexibility.
One student, who prefers to
remain anonymous, feels that the
rigid lecture-structured curriculum
has transformed the program into
a "passive learning process."
Others object to the rigidity of
the program's core courses, which
occupy eight units per term for
the entire sophomore year.
Another common student
complaint is that the program,
while providing a fine
comprehensive overview of several
disciplines, fails to provide a
deeper understanding of any one
particular field. The reply to this
criticism is that depth of
knowledge in one field should be
acquired by the student in
electives taken outside the Human
Biology Program in the junior and
senior years.
As for the material within the

program, opinion varies greatly.
Some students feel "spoon fed,"
others complain that they are
inundated with complexities of
scientific detail that they neither
need nor desire. Some complain
that the Human Bio major is not
sufficiently prepared for any one
field, and that special skills are
not developed. Others feel that
this kind of general
comprehensive education is
exactly what makes the program
worthwhile.
The Human Biology Program
was created in 1 968 by virtue of a
$1,936,000 Ford Foundation
grant. Initially the program,
according to Kretchmer, the
Chairman of the Committee in
Charge, was "aimed at the
creation of a human biologist who
is knowledgeable about man, his
function, behavior and social
patterns."
The members of the committee
in charge of the formation of the
program felt that the common ties
between the fields of behavior,
psychology, sociology and
biology, were not fully explored
in any of their respective
departments. The program was
conceived of, and has become, an
interdisciplinary effort that holds
interest for a wide variety of

students.
No Common Direction
Human Biology majors are by
no means headed solely for
medical school. A substantial
number of them are primarily
interested in obtaining a biological
approach to man that can be
applied to various sociological
fields such as economics, political
science and law. Others are
interested in bio-engineering,
philosophy or psychology. One
Human Bio major even aspires to
be a policeman.
It was felt also at the time, that
there was a great need for people
in modern society, regardless of
their field of expertise, who
understood and were concerned
with man's complex relationship
with nature. Dr. Kretchmer and
other members of the Committee
saw a definite demand for a
discipline that could prepare
future policy makers and citizens
with a solid understanding of
biological and behavioral
principles.
At present, the mood of the
faculty and students appears to be
one of cautious optimism. For a
program "built-from-scratch"
only three years ago, it seems to
be evolving into a very valuable
and stable one.
