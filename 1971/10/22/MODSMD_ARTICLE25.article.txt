# Roots In Tribal Society
## Persian Gulf Unrest 
### CRAIG MALLOY 
The countries of the Persian
Gulf have "moved from a colonial
past to a technologic future with
scarcely a pause in the present,"
stated John Cooley, Christian
Science Monitor's North Africa
and Middle East correspondent in
a discussion Wednesday of the
"Future of the Persian Gulf."
"That's what makes the area so
interesting."
Cooley explained that the
political and economic structures
of the Gulf area are historically
rooted in the tribal society and
the Gulf's function as an avenue
of trade. The cause of the shift
from "camels to computers
overnight" is the discovery of vast
reserves of oil in many Gulf

countries.
Oil provides the promise for
the future development of the
Persian Gulf countries, Cooley
explained at the lecture,
sponsored by the Middle East
desk of the International
Association. But its discovery, he
said, is responsible directly or
indirectly for the majority of the
problems facing the area today.
Commenting that a major
cause of internal social stress is
the sudden increase in quality of
education available to the young
through the newly rich
governments and special advanced
training offered by the oil
industry, Cooley added "Parents
are Bedouins and their children
are engineers."
Difficulties between gulf
countries also stem to a large
extent from the relative
distribution of oil between the
smaller countries, he noted. The
richer small countries refuse to
form any sort of organization
with other small Arab countries
on an equal basis, but without a
federation, Cooley sees no
significant progress for these
"political absurdities."
Cooley said that Iran seeks to
be the center of military power in
the area, and he foresees a
confrontation with Saudi Arabia.
If it occurs, Cooley sees little
foreign involvement.
The correspondent observed
that oil also plays a major role in
international relations. As British
influence decreases, there is a

sharply increased effort by
non-Western powers, notably
China, to commercially or
otherwise assure themselves a
steady oil supply.
Cooley suggested that China
may not consider its own
mainland supply of oil
dependable. China's oil fields are
near the Soviet border.
China's interest in Persian Oil
extends to the support of the
strongest revolutionary groups in
the Gulf, he said ". . .regardless of
ideology."
Cooley, however, does not
consider the prospect for
revolution by the working class
very likely, primarily because

there is no real proletariat or clear
revolutionary class.

pressures threatening to drastically alter their ways of life.
The countries of the Persian
Gulf have "moved from a colonial
past to a technologic future with
scarcely a pause in the present,"
stated John Cooley, Christian
Science Monitor's North Africa
and Middle East correspondent in
a discussion Wednesday of the
"Future of the Persian Gulf."
"That's what makes the area so
interesting."
Cooley explained that the
political and economic structures
of the Gulf area are historically
rooted in the tribal society and
the Gulf's function as an avenue
of trade. The cause of the shift
from "camels to computers
overnight" is the discovery of vast
reserves of oil in many Gulf

countries.
Oil provides the promise for
the future development of the
Persian Gulf countries, Cooley
explained at the lecture,
sponsored by the Middle East
desk of the International
Association. But its discovery, he
said, is responsible directly or
indirectly for the majority of the
problems facing the area today.
Commenting that a major
cause of internal social stress is
the sudden increase in quality of
education available to the young
through the newly rich
governments and special advanced
training offered by the oil
industry, Cooley added "Parents
are Bedouins and their children
are engineers."
Difficulties between gulf
countries also stem to a large
extent from the relative
distribution of oil between the
smaller countries, he noted. The
richer small countries refuse to
form any sort of organization
with other small Arab countries
on an equal basis, but without a
federation, Cooley sees no
significant progress for these
"political absurdities."
Cooley said that Iran seeks to
be the center of military power in
the area, and he foresees a
confrontation with Saudi Arabia.
If it occurs, Cooley sees little
foreign involvement.
The correspondent observed
that oil also plays a major role in
international relations. As British
influence decreases, there is a

sharply increased effort by
non-Western powers, notably
China, to commercially or
otherwise assure themselves a
steady oil supply.
Cooley suggested that China
may not consider its own
mainland supply of oil
dependable. China's oil fields are
near the Soviet border.
China's interest in Persian Oil
extends to the support of the
strongest revolutionary groups in
the Gulf, he said ". . .regardless of
ideology."
Cooley, however, does not
consider the prospect for
revolution by the working class
very likely, primarily because

there is no real proletariat or clear
revolutionary class.
