# Land Sale Threatens Menomini Life

"Live in peace. lie good to
every person. If you live
somewhere. . .if you have
something to eat. . .feed
him. . .even though there is only
one meal in your house, feed him
anyway, especially if it's an old
lady or an old man. Advice to
children.
Another threat to Menomini
identity is the necessity to sell
some of their land. The tribe,
economically self-sufficient due to
ownership of 382 square miles of
timberland, was abruptly
"terminated" by the BIA in 1961.
By this unpopular act, the tribe
lost its tax-free status and its
government services and is now in
financial trouble. The lumber
industry must support over 3,000
people in the county.
"There is no economic base
left," George Spindler comments.
The tribe has been forced to
offer 8% of its land for sale to
whites for recreation homesites
around Legend Lake, but the
revenue from this may be
dissipated by the newcomers'
needs for public services.
A militant group, DRUMS
(Determination of Rights and
Unity Among Menominee
Stockholders) has formed to fight
the project. Menominee
Enterprises, Inc. has hired a public
relations expert to counteract the
dissidents.
A brochure for the
development declares: "Until
recently the land on which you
walk had known only the
Menominee moccasin. . .Now, for
the first time, the virgin beauty of
this great land is being offered to
you. . .You'll find your future
here in the Menominee past."
DRUMS sees the loss of the
land as the Menomini's final
alienation of identity.
Louise Spindler explains, "In
traditional Indian culture there
wasn't a separation between man
and nature. To the Indian, he
himself is nature."
The native-oriented Menomini
participates in the spirit of all
living things, George Spindler
points out. "He doesn't go, like

we might say, 'out into nature,' he
is of necessity in and of it."
The Menomini are struggling to
survive as a people.
"Whatever happens, the
Menomini way as a distinctive
culture, derived from its own past
and independent of Whiteman
culture, is nearly gone," the book
says. "There may still be a
Menomini community, one with
pride and quality that is slightly
though perhaps significantly
different from other North
American communities. There is a
chance."

The Spindlers began fieldwork
with the Menomini in 1948 as
graduate students at the
University of Wisconsin, camping
near Indian land.
They have returned nearly
every summer since then.
"We grew up with them; we
know their children and
grandchildren," Louise Spindler
notes.
"The only thing anthropology
has going for it is a belief that you
have to live with people and know
them from the inside out to write
about them," George Spindler

adds.
He is a professor of
anthropology and education here,
while his wife is a research
associate and lecturer in the
anthropology department.
Married in 1942, the Spindlers
have taught at Stanford since
1950.
George Spindler is proud that,
"So far 'Dreamers Without Power'
seems to be one of the few books
written about Indians by whites
that Indians seem to like." He
adds, "We think we did a good
job."

The Spindlers began fieldwork
with the Menomini in 1948 as
graduate students at the
University of Wisconsin, camping
near Indian land.
They have returned nearly
every summer since then.
"We grew up with them; we
know their children and
grandchildren," Louise Spindler
notes.
"The only thing anthropology
has going for it is a belief that you
have to live with people and know
them from the inside out to write
about them," George Spindler

adds.
He is a professor of
anthropology and education here,
while his wife is a research
associate and lecturer in the
anthropology department.
Married in 1942, the Spindlers
have taught at Stanford since
1950.
George Spindler is proud that,
"So far 'Dreamers Without Power'
seems to be one of the few books
written about Indians by whites
that Indians seem to like." He
adds, "We think we did a good
job."

Another threat to Menomini
identity is the necessity to sell
some of their land. The tribe,
economically self-sufficient due to
ownership of 382 square miles of
timberland, was abruptly
"terminated" by the BIA in 1961.
By this unpopular act, the tribe
lost its tax-free status and its
government services and is now in
financial trouble. The lumber
industry must support over 3,000
people in the county.
"There is no economic base
left," George Spindler comments.
The tribe has been forced to
offer 8% of its land for sale to
whites for recreation homesites
around Legend Lake, but the
revenue from this may be
dissipated by the newcomers'
needs for public services.
A militant group, DRUMS
(Determination of Rights and
Unity Among Menominee
Stockholders) has formed to fight
the project. Menominee
Enterprises, Inc. has hired a public
relations expert to counteract the
dissidents.
A brochure for the
development declares: "Until
recently the land on which you
walk had known only the
Menominee moccasin. . .Now, for
the first time, the virgin beauty of
this great land is being offered to
you. . .You'll find your future
here in the Menominee past."
DRUMS sees the loss of the
land as the Menomini's final
alienation of identity.
Louise Spindler explains, "In
traditional Indian culture there
wasn't a separation between man
and nature. To the Indian, he
himself is nature."
The native-oriented Menomini
participates in the spirit of all
living things, George Spindler
points out. "He doesn't go, like

we might say, 'out into nature,' he
is of necessity in and of it."
The Menomini are struggling to
survive as a people.
"Whatever happens, the
Menomini way as a distinctive
culture, derived from its own past
and independent of Whiteman
culture, is nearly gone," the book
says. "There may still be a
Menomini community, one with
pride and quality that is slightly
though perhaps significantly
different from other North
American communities. There is a
chance."
