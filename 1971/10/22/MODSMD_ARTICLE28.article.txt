# 'Death In Venice'
## Visconti's Bad Moves 
### DOUG ARTHUR 
Luchino Visconti annoys me. He had all the
ingredients for a truly excellent film: superb acting,
gorgeous visual material (by Pasquale de Sentis),
Piero Tosi's elaborate and historically authentic
costumes, some absolutely brilliant directorial
effects, and obviously Thomas Mann's great novella
from which the film is taken.
What went wrong? Apparently, the novella
wasn't good enough, so the director changed crucial
sections of it. Whatever the rationale for the
alterations, they were all for the worse. Therein lies
the film's failure as a work of art.
It is essential that Gustave von Aschenbach, the
central figure, be a writer. A writer need never meet
his audience: it is a solitary occuption. But in the
film, the main character has been transposed into a
composer; he must necessarily come in constant
contact with his audience.
I think the change was made in order to throw in
Mahler's 3rd and sth symphonies, which come
blaring in to remind us when we're supposed to
notice something.
Shouting Composer
The novella is indeed about the artist's quest for
beauty. Visconti's version has added a young
composer who indulges in shouting (and I do mean
shouting) matches with Aschenbach over the nature
of beauty. This is the easy way out. Instead of
suggesting the conflict between the composer's ideal
and his life, he merely brings in another character.
All of the flashbacks were disconcerting and
interrupted the flow of the movie for no apparent
reason.
Then there is the problem of the theme.
What was once Mann's story of the artist's
relationship to ideal beauty has been transformed
into an aging composer's infatuation with a boy of
fourteen. In Mann's conception, Aschenbach is
more in love with the idea of Tadzio, the idea of
perfect beauty, than the physical representation of
it.
And just so we don't think the old boy is gay,
the director has him kiss portraits of his wife and
daughter—all very touching. And if you miss the

point (you couldn't possibly,) there are the
flashbacks of man and wife sitting on a hillside with
the sentimentally vulgar accompaniment of Mahler's
music.
Disjointed Effect
These flashbacks and the illogical addition of the
discourses on beauty (watered down for the screen
audience) gave the film a disjointed effect. It's as if
the film editor wasn't sure what to cut, so just left
everything in.
Dick Bogarde presented the main character as a
fussy, fastidious man, clearly of the nobility.
Bogarde can be powerfully moving as well. At one
point, after he had followed Tadzio and his family
for some time, he sinks down to the ground,
overcome by exertion, and begins to laugh at
himself. He has been made up to look young by the
barber, and his anguished laugh is at his own folly.
The multilingual aspect was the director's tour de
force. We seem to overhear conversations from one
moment to the next. It's as if we were actually
walking through the Grand Hotel des Bains.
Visconti succeeded in re-creating the atmosphere of
pre-WW 1 aristocratic Venice. The costumes caused
a sensation when the movie was being filmed, and
it's easy to see why. Visually, the film remained on
a high level of excellence. The last sequence
however topped everything.
Aschenbach, clearly exhausted, is reclining on a
lounge chair on the beach. He gasps for breath and
watches Tadzio, as a Polish woman sings a long,
gutteral song.
New Death
As Tadzio walks into the brilliantly shimmering
waters of the Adriatic, Aschenbach makes a pathetic
attempt to rise. His face flushed, dye streaking
down his temples, so near the ultimate degredation
of death, the old composer sees the broad expanse
of sea and sand.
Another shot of Tadzio in the water
approximates the monumentally of beauty, just as
the old man on the beach slumps back into his
chair.
The entire sequence is visually stunning. If only
Visconti had been less ambitious in changing the
novella!

BARREL OF FUN—The Daily's roving photographer caught this
student immediately after he heard that the First Spanislitown Art
and Pumpkin Festival was being held in Half Moon Bay tomorrow.
And who wouldn't be overjoyed. Those people who are lucky enough
to be down by the old pumpkin fields tomorrow will be able to take
part in a program full of incredible excitement. Pumpkin-picking,
pumpkin pie-eating, apple bobbing and a costume parade highlight the
affair. Any interested humans or simians should make it down
tomorrow to the intersection of Highways 1 and 92. The whole
thing's a freebie, and it will last from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. If you get lost
on the way, just follow the apes.

of death, the old composer sees the broad expanse
of sea and sand.
Another shot of Tadzio in the water
approximates the monumentally of beauty, just as
the old man on the beach slumps back into his
chair.
The entire sequence is visually stunning. If only
Visconti had been less ambitious in changing the

BARREL OF FUN—The Daily's roving photographer caught this
student immediately after he heard that the First Spanislitown Art
and Pumpkin Festival was being held in Half Moon Bay tomorrow.
And who wouldn't be overjoyed. Those people who are lucky enough
to be down by the old pumpkin fields tomorrow will be able to take
part in a program full of incredible excitement. Pumpkin-picking,
pumpkin pie-eating, apple bobbing and a costume parade highlight the
affair. Any interested humans or simians should make it down
tomorrow to the intersection of Highways 1 and 92. The whole
thing's a freebie, and it will last from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. If you get lost
on the way, just follow the apes.
Luchino Visconti annoys me. He had all the
ingredients for a truly excellent film: superb acting,
gorgeous visual material (by Pasquale de Sentis),
Piero Tosi's elaborate and historically authentic
costumes, some absolutely brilliant directorial
effects, and obviously Thomas Mann's great novella
from which the film is taken.
What went wrong? Apparently, the novella
wasn't good enough, so the director changed crucial
sections of it. Whatever the rationale for the
alterations, they were all for the worse. Therein lies
the film's failure as a work of art.
It is essential that Gustave von Aschenbach, the
central figure, be a writer. A writer need never meet
his audience: it is a solitary occuption. But in the
film, the main character has been transposed into a
composer; he must necessarily come in constant
contact with his audience.
I think the change was made in order to throw in
Mahler's 3rd and sth symphonies, which come
blaring in to remind us when we're supposed to
notice something.
Shouting Composer
The novella is indeed about the artist's quest for
beauty. Visconti's version has added a young
composer who indulges in shouting (and I do mean
shouting) matches with Aschenbach over the nature
of beauty. This is the easy way out. Instead of
suggesting the conflict between the composer's ideal
and his life, he merely brings in another character.
All of the flashbacks were disconcerting and
interrupted the flow of the movie for no apparent
reason.
Then there is the problem of the theme.
What was once Mann's story of the artist's
relationship to ideal beauty has been transformed
into an aging composer's infatuation with a boy of
fourteen. In Mann's conception, Aschenbach is
more in love with the idea of Tadzio, the idea of
perfect beauty, than the physical representation of
it.
And just so we don't think the old boy is gay,
the director has him kiss portraits of his wife and
daughter—all very touching. And if you miss the

point (you couldn't possibly,) there are the
flashbacks of man and wife sitting on a hillside with
the sentimentally vulgar accompaniment of Mahler's
music.
Disjointed Effect
These flashbacks and the illogical addition of the
discourses on beauty (watered down for the screen
audience) gave the film a disjointed effect. It's as if
the film editor wasn't sure what to cut, so just left
everything in.
Dick Bogarde presented the main character as a
fussy, fastidious man, clearly of the nobility.
Bogarde can be powerfully moving as well. At one
point, after he had followed Tadzio and his family
for some time, he sinks down to the ground,
overcome by exertion, and begins to laugh at
himself. He has been made up to look young by the
barber, and his anguished laugh is at his own folly.
The multilingual aspect was the director's tour de
force. We seem to overhear conversations from one
moment to the next. It's as if we were actually
walking through the Grand Hotel des Bains.
Visconti succeeded in re-creating the atmosphere of
pre-WW 1 aristocratic Venice. The costumes caused
a sensation when the movie was being filmed, and
it's easy to see why. Visually, the film remained on
a high level of excellence. The last sequence
however topped everything.
Aschenbach, clearly exhausted, is reclining on a
lounge chair on the beach. He gasps for breath and
watches Tadzio, as a Polish woman sings a long,
gutteral song.
New Death
As Tadzio walks into the brilliantly shimmering
waters of the Adriatic, Aschenbach makes a pathetic
attempt to rise. His face flushed, dye streaking
down his temples, so near the ultimate degredation
of death, the old composer sees the broad expanse
of sea and sand.
Another shot of Tadzio in the water

for some time, he sinks down to the ground,
overcome by exertion, and begins to laugh at
himself. He has been made up to look young by the
barber, and his anguished laugh is at his own folly.
The multilingual aspect was the director's tour de
force. We seem to overhear conversations from one
moment to the next. It's as if we were actually
walking through the Grand Hotel des Bains.
Visconti succeeded in re-creating the atmosphere of
pre-WW 1 aristocratic Venice. The costumes caused
a sensation when the movie was being filmed, and
it's easy to see why. Visually, the film remained on
a high level of excellence. The last sequence
however topped everything.
Aschenbach, clearly exhausted, is reclining on a
lounge chair on the beach. He gasps for breath and
watches Tadzio, as a Polish woman sings a long,
gutteral song.
New Death
As Tadzio walks into the brilliantly shimmering
waters of the Adriatic, Aschenbach makes a pathetic
attempt to rise. His face flushed, dye streaking
down his temples, so near the ultimate degredation
of death, the old composer sees the broad expanse
of sea and sand.
Another shot of Tadzio in the water
approximates the monumentally of beauty, just as
the old man on the beach slumps back into his
chair.
The entire sequence is visually stunning. If only
Visconti had been less ambitious in changing the
novella!

BARREL OF FUN—The Daily's roving photographer caught this
student immediately after he heard that the First Spanislitown Art
and Pumpkin Festival was being held in Half Moon Bay tomorrow.
And who wouldn't be overjoyed. Those people who are lucky enough
to be down by the old pumpkin fields tomorrow will be able to take
part in a program full of incredible excitement. Pumpkin-picking,
pumpkin pie-eating, apple bobbing and a costume parade highlight the
affair. Any interested humans or simians should make it down
tomorrow to the intersection of Highways 1 and 92. The whole
thing's a freebie, and it will last from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. If you get lost
on the way, just follow the apes.
