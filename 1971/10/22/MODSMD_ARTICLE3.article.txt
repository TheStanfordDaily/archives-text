# Franklin Sought To 'Conciliate'
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
Yale Braunstein testified yesterday
that he thought Bruce Franklin's White
Plaza speech, Feb. 10, was an effort to
"conciliate" advocates of a "localized
sit-in" with Franklin's own preference
for a campus-wide strike.
Braunstein, one of Franklin's
amateur co-counsels, took the stand in
the Maoist professor's dismissal hearing.
Charges against Franklin include
inciting a Computation Center
occupation and a refusal to disperse
from the scene.
Braunstein, an economics graduate
student, said the Computation Center
had been selected as a protest target by
others before Franklin spoke.
He believed Franklin intended to tell
the rally, "If you're going to the
Computation Center... go as the start
of a strike."
According to Braunstein, the debate
between advocates of a sit-in and those
favoring a strike also dominated a
Dinkelspiel auditorium meeting the
night before the White Plaza rally.
Franklin's White Plaza speech
referred to a "fake-strike" but also
mentioned a "shutdown." Braunstein, a
longtime campus activist, insisted a
"shutdown" meant a campus-wide
protest similar to the "Cambodia
strike" in spring, 1970.
He said actions in such a strike
ranged from "alternate classes" and
blocking doorways to "Weatherman
tactics."
Braunstein conceded some speakers
at Dinkelspiel had discussed ways of

damaging the Computation Center. But
he insisted, "I didn't think anyone
wanted to do it."
Roger Gocking, a graduate student
in history, said he faced "unnecessary
harassment" from a campus policeman
who stopped him and two friends on
their way to the Dinkelspiel meeting.
He later told the meeting about the
incident.
He charged the group was
questioned only because he and
another person were black.
Gocking said he was also at the
Computation Center incident. He called
the crowd outside the building
"confused" and said it had no weapons.
He said he saw Franklin arguing with
police from a distance of 50 or 60 feet.
But he testified he could not hear
Franklin's words over the amplified
dispersal announcement.
During yesterday's session, Franklin
repeatedly demanded guarantees that
his witnesses would not face campus
judicial charges because of their
testimony. During Braunstein's
testimony, the administration promised
there will be no prosecutions based on
speeches at rallies, Feb. 9 and 10.
But lawyer Raymond Fisher said the
administration is "not prepared ... at
this time" to pledge similar immunity
to witnesses who testify they
participated in the Computation Center
occupation.
Board chairman Donald Kennedy
told the administration and Franklin to
negotiate their own settlement of the
immunity question. Franklin reserved

the right to recall Gocking if an
agreement is reached.
Kennedy rejected Franklin's
renewed request to judge the Lodge
incident separately from three other
charges against him. Franklin said he
feared a "slop-over effect" if the
charges are considered together.
The Board also granted its own
funds to fly Statistics Professor Charles
Stein back from Cornell, where he is on
sabbatical. Franklin said Stein is "very
important" to his case as a witness to
events at the Computation Center.

sabbatical. Franklin said Stein is "very
important" to his case as a witness to
events at the Computation Center.
Yale Braunstein testified yesterday
that he thought Bruce Franklin's White
Plaza speech, Feb. 10, was an effort to
"conciliate" advocates of a "localized
sit-in" with Franklin's own preference
for a campus-wide strike.
Braunstein, one of Franklin's
amateur co-counsels, took the stand in
the Maoist professor's dismissal hearing.
Charges against Franklin include
inciting a Computation Center
occupation and a refusal to disperse
from the scene.
Braunstein, an economics graduate
student, said the Computation Center
had been selected as a protest target by
others before Franklin spoke.
He believed Franklin intended to tell
the rally, "If you're going to the
Computation Center... go as the start
of a strike."
According to Braunstein, the debate
between advocates of a sit-in and those
favoring a strike also dominated a
Dinkelspiel auditorium meeting the
night before the White Plaza rally.
Franklin's White Plaza speech
referred to a "fake-strike" but also
mentioned a "shutdown." Braunstein, a
longtime campus activist, insisted a
"shutdown" meant a campus-wide
protest similar to the "Cambodia
strike" in spring, 1970.
He said actions in such a strike
ranged from "alternate classes" and
blocking doorways to "Weatherman
tactics."
Braunstein conceded some speakers
at Dinkelspiel had discussed ways of

damaging the Computation Center. But
he insisted, "I didn't think anyone
wanted to do it."
Roger Gocking, a graduate student
in history, said he faced "unnecessary
harassment" from a campus policeman
who stopped him and two friends on
their way to the Dinkelspiel meeting.
He later told the meeting about the
incident.
He charged the group was
questioned only because he and
another person were black.
Gocking said he was also at the
Computation Center incident. He called
the crowd outside the building
"confused" and said it had no weapons.
He said he saw Franklin arguing with
police from a distance of 50 or 60 feet.
But he testified he could not hear
Franklin's words over the amplified
dispersal announcement.
During yesterday's session, Franklin
repeatedly demanded guarantees that
his witnesses would not face campus
judicial charges because of their
testimony. During Braunstein's
testimony, the administration promised
there will be no prosecutions based on
speeches at rallies, Feb. 9 and 10.
But lawyer Raymond Fisher said the
administration is "not prepared ... at
this time" to pledge similar immunity
to witnesses who testify they
participated in the Computation Center
occupation.
Board chairman Donald Kennedy
told the administration and Franklin to
negotiate their own settlement of the
immunity question. Franklin reserved

the right to recall Gocking if an
agreement is reached.
Kennedy rejected Franklin's
renewed request to judge the Lodge
incident separately from three other
charges against him. Franklin said he
feared a "slop-over effect" if the
charges are considered together.
The Board also granted its own
funds to fly Statistics Professor Charles
Stein back from Cornell, where he is on
sabbatical. Franklin said Stein is "very
important" to his case as a witness to
events at the Computation Center.
