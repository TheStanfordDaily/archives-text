# Looking Back At The Film Festival
## 
### TODD McCARTHY 
Despite the general consensus
that the recently finished San
Francisco Film Festival was a
pretty darn good one, local
journalists still seem to find it
fashionable to come down hard
on the festival, either out of
general ignorance of what the
films were about, as with the
critics at the Chronicle, or out of
a desire to appear chicly cynical,
as with the Berkeley Barb.
If it's not a few lousy films, it's
the high-priced concessions stand
and if it's not the super elite
atmosphere of opening night, it's
the cigarette (and dope) smoking
in the auditorium. Over the
festival's 16 days, I personally saw
33 feature-length films, not
counting many hours of shorts
and retrospective clips, and
travelled 1,000 miles combined to
do so. As far as I'm concerned,
the hell with the bitching
Chronicle staffers who get full
press privileges and who have only
to cross town to get to the Palace.
Among other riches, this year
an unprecedented 15 directors
appeared with their works and
program director Albert Johnson
went to great lengths to schedule
extra full-length screenings of
films by directors being honored
in retrospective tributes. On the
festival's final afternoon,
representatives of the amorphous
"free audience" made a moving
thank-you gesture to Johnson
publically for offering all morning
and afternoon programs free of
charge.
If I have any complaints (aside
from those directed at specific
films), they're in my agreement
with executive director Claude
Jarman that perhaps the festival is
a couple of days too long. By the
time the third weekend rolled
around, I was profoundly pooped.
Though almost all the films were
worth seeing, there were some,
such as Clint Eastwood's "Play
Misty For Me" and Jarl Kulle's
Swedish comedy "The Bookseller
Who Gave Up Bathing," that
seemed somewhat out of place in
festival environs. In the
overwhelming long run, however,
all I can say is Vive le Festival.
Clearly, so much happened
during the festival that it's hard to
be fair and complete in a brief

resume. The idea of a Clint
Eastwood tribute seemed dubious
at first, but it was fun enough
(Eastwood graduated from
Oakland Tech) and it's surprising
to remember that the star (ranked
Number One in a recent world
poll) has appeared in four
near-masterpieces in his brief
career ("For a Few Dollars More,"
"The Good, The Bad, and the
Ugly," "Coogan's Bluff" and
"The Beguiled").
Eastwood's first effort as a
director, "Play Misty For Me,"
was resoundingly condemned by
an anxious audience and it
disturbed me in both the right and
the wrong ways. Favorably
because Eastwood managed a
number of efficiently squeamish
sequences and unfavorably
because there were a number of
significant lapses of directorial
judgment. I could sit through it
again, though, which is more than
I can say for some of the recent
films by Godard, Visconti and
Fellini.
The tribute to Vincente
Minnelli was a marathon, with the
clips alone lasting nearly five
hours. In his years at MGM,
Minnelli virtually defined the look
of the American musical at its
best and is one of the few
genuinely talented directors who
at no point was victimized by
studio bosses, as he met the
demands of both commerce and
art.
One of the most extraordinary
films of the festival was Marco
Bellochio's "Nel Nome del Padre"
("In the Name of the Father").
The Italian director's first two
films, "A Fist in the Pocket" and
"China is Near," were briefly, and
controversially, seen in this
country and after several years of
inactivity, he has emerged with a
film of ferocious force and
originality.
Somewhat reminiscent in
subject to "The 400 Blows,"
"Zero de Conduite" and "If. .
it is unique in that it caters to no
preconceptions the audience
might carry with them and
unexpectedly makes no direct
comment on or condemnation of
school or political systems.
Rather, it is a rather oblique study
of power and ways to achieve it
within a given system.

At several points, when
Bellochio had made a certain
point, I thought the film was over,
but then it lurched ahead to
something new, finally ending
with the oddest of alliances
between a student leader cum
fascist and an idiot menial laborer
who speaks in the tongue of an
imaginary planet.
The film is outrageous and
drawn in broad strokes with many
memorable showcase sequences.
Despite the undeniable brilliance
of its execution, it remains
difficult to know just what to
make of the film, for rarely have I
seen so much compressed fury
and passion unleased at nothing in
particular.
Bellochio, more angry than
Truffaut, more political than Vigo
and more realistic than Anderson,
is very specific in his subject and
only slightly less so in the breadth
of his implications and it is the
intensity with which he devotes
himself to his dramatic obsessions
that makes "Nel Nome del Padre"
a remarkable film.
"The Decameron" is the most
crotch conscious film I have ever
seen—the whole thing seems like

one big codpiece. The pleasure of
the film, just as of sex, the film's
subject, diminishes after it is over,
but there is similarly a certain
pleasure to be had from thinking
about it afterwards.
The film is especially delightful
coming from Pier Paolo Pasolini,
some of whose earlier work has
been so literal and arid. Pasolini
has chosen less than a dozen of
Boccaccio's tales to dramatize and
almost all of them are charming,
funny and genuinely bawdy.
One of the most amusing

sequences involves a young
worker who applies for a job at a
convent to see if all he hears
about nuns is true. Posing as a
deaf-mute, the strapping fellow
soon has all the nuns standing in
line to partake of his services.
Eventually the Mother Superior
decides to discover for herself
what makes the nuns so happy
and it is at this point that the man
finally speaks up in protest.
Mother Superior promptly
proclaims his new power of
speech as a miracle and the man's
vocation has been secured for life.

THEY'D RATHER SWITCH—CIine Eastwood's first film as a director, "Play Misty For Me," premiered
last week at the San Francisco Film Festival. Eastwood also stars, but behind the bar is director Don
Siegel, who guided Clint through four of his best pictures. The reason: Eastwood says that he wanted
someone on the set the first day of shooting more nervous than he was, as it's Siegel's debut as an actor.

One of the most extraordinary
films of the festival was Marco
Bellochio's "Nel Nome del Padre"
("In the Name of the Father").
The Italian director's first two
films, "A Fist in the Pocket" and
"China is Near," were briefly, and
controversially, seen in this
country and after several years of
inactivity, he has emerged with a
film of ferocious force and
originality.
Somewhat reminiscent in
subject to "The 400 Blows,"
"Zero de Conduite" and "If. .
it is unique in that it caters to no
preconceptions the audience
might carry with them and
unexpectedly makes no direct
comment on or condemnation of
school or political systems.
Rather, it is a rather oblique study
of power and ways to achieve it
within a given system.

At several points, when
Bellochio had made a certain
point, I thought the film was over,
but then it lurched ahead to
something new, finally ending
with the oddest of alliances
between a student leader cum
fascist and an idiot menial laborer
who speaks in the tongue of an
imaginary planet.
The film is outrageous and
drawn in broad strokes with many
memorable showcase sequences.
Despite the undeniable brilliance
of its execution, it remains
difficult to know just what to
make of the film, for rarely have I
seen so much compressed fury
and passion unleased at nothing in
particular.
Bellochio, more angry than
Truffaut, more political than Vigo
and more realistic than Anderson,
is very specific in his subject and
only slightly less so in the breadth
of his implications and it is the
intensity with which he devotes
himself to his dramatic obsessions
that makes "Nel Nome del Padre"
a remarkable film.
"The Decameron" is the most
crotch conscious film I have ever
seen—the whole thing seems like

one big codpiece. The pleasure of
the film, just as of sex, the film's
subject, diminishes after it is over,
but there is similarly a certain
pleasure to be had from thinking
about it afterwards.
The film is especially delightful
coming from Pier Paolo Pasolini,
some of whose earlier work has
been so literal and arid. Pasolini
has chosen less than a dozen of
Boccaccio's tales to dramatize and
almost all of them are charming,
funny and genuinely bawdy.
One of the most amusing

sequences involves a young
worker who applies for a job at a
convent to see if all he hears
about nuns is true. Posing as a
deaf-mute, the strapping fellow
soon has all the nuns standing in
line to partake of his services.
Eventually the Mother Superior
decides to discover for herself
what makes the nuns so happy
and it is at this point that the man
finally speaks up in protest.
Mother Superior promptly
proclaims his new power of
speech as a miracle and the man's
vocation has been secured for life.

THEY'D RATHER SWITCH—CIine Eastwood's first film as a director, "Play Misty For Me," premiered
last week at the San Francisco Film Festival. Eastwood also stars, but behind the bar is director Don
Siegel, who guided Clint through four of his best pictures. The reason: Eastwood says that he wanted
someone on the set the first day of shooting more nervous than he was, as it's Siegel's debut as an actor.
Despite the general consensus
that the recently finished San
Francisco Film Festival was a
pretty darn good one, local
journalists still seem to find it
fashionable to come down hard
on the festival, either out of
general ignorance of what the
films were about, as with the
critics at the Chronicle, or out of
a desire to appear chicly cynical,
as with the Berkeley Barb.
If it's not a few lousy films, it's
the high-priced concessions stand
and if it's not the super elite
atmosphere of opening night, it's
the cigarette (and dope) smoking
in the auditorium. Over the
festival's 16 days, I personally saw
33 feature-length films, not
counting many hours of shorts
and retrospective clips, and
travelled 1,000 miles combined to
do so. As far as I'm concerned,
the hell with the bitching
Chronicle staffers who get full
press privileges and who have only
to cross town to get to the Palace.
Among other riches, this year
an unprecedented 15 directors
appeared with their works and
program director Albert Johnson
went to great lengths to schedule
extra full-length screenings of
films by directors being honored
in retrospective tributes. On the
festival's final afternoon,
representatives of the amorphous
"free audience" made a moving
thank-you gesture to Johnson
publically for offering all morning
and afternoon programs free of
charge.
If I have any complaints (aside
from those directed at specific
films), they're in my agreement
with executive director Claude
Jarman that perhaps the festival is
a couple of days too long. By the
time the third weekend rolled
around, I was profoundly pooped.
Though almost all the films were
worth seeing, there were some,
such as Clint Eastwood's "Play
Misty For Me" and Jarl Kulle's
Swedish comedy "The Bookseller
Who Gave Up Bathing," that
seemed somewhat out of place in
festival environs. In the
overwhelming long run, however,
all I can say is Vive le Festival.
Clearly, so much happened
during the festival that it's hard to
be fair and complete in a brief

resume. The idea of a Clint
Eastwood tribute seemed dubious
at first, but it was fun enough
(Eastwood graduated from
Oakland Tech) and it's surprising
to remember that the star (ranked
Number One in a recent world
poll) has appeared in four
near-masterpieces in his brief
career ("For a Few Dollars More,"
"The Good, The Bad, and the
Ugly," "Coogan's Bluff" and
"The Beguiled").
Eastwood's first effort as a
director, "Play Misty For Me,"
was resoundingly condemned by
an anxious audience and it
disturbed me in both the right and
the wrong ways. Favorably
because Eastwood managed a
number of efficiently squeamish
sequences and unfavorably
because there were a number of
significant lapses of directorial
judgment. I could sit through it
again, though, which is more than
I can say for some of the recent
films by Godard, Visconti and
Fellini.
The tribute to Vincente
Minnelli was a marathon, with the
clips alone lasting nearly five
hours. In his years at MGM,
Minnelli virtually defined the look
of the American musical at its
best and is one of the few
genuinely talented directors who
at no point was victimized by
studio bosses, as he met the
demands of both commerce and
art.

someone on the set the first day of shooting more nervous than he was, as it's Siegel's debut as an actor.
Despite the general consensus
that the recently finished San
Francisco Film Festival was a
pretty darn good one, local
journalists still seem to find it
fashionable to come down hard
on the festival, either out of
general ignorance of what the
films were about, as with the
critics at the Chronicle, or out of
a desire to appear chicly cynical,
as with the Berkeley Barb.
If it's not a few lousy films, it's
the high-priced concessions stand
and if it's not the super elite
atmosphere of opening night, it's
the cigarette (and dope) smoking
in the auditorium. Over the
festival's 16 days, I personally saw
33 feature-length films, not
counting many hours of shorts
and retrospective clips, and
travelled 1,000 miles combined to
do so. As far as I'm concerned,
the hell with the bitching
Chronicle staffers who get full
press privileges and who have only
to cross town to get to the Palace.
Among other riches, this year
an unprecedented 15 directors
appeared with their works and
program director Albert Johnson
went to great lengths to schedule
extra full-length screenings of
films by directors being honored
in retrospective tributes. On the
festival's final afternoon,
representatives of the amorphous
"free audience" made a moving
thank-you gesture to Johnson
publically for offering all morning
and afternoon programs free of
charge.
If I have any complaints (aside
from those directed at specific
films), they're in my agreement
with executive director Claude
Jarman that perhaps the festival is
a couple of days too long. By the
time the third weekend rolled
around, I was profoundly pooped.
Though almost all the films were
worth seeing, there were some,
such as Clint Eastwood's "Play
Misty For Me" and Jarl Kulle's
Swedish comedy "The Bookseller
Who Gave Up Bathing," that
seemed somewhat out of place in
festival environs. In the
overwhelming long run, however,
all I can say is Vive le Festival.
Clearly, so much happened
during the festival that it's hard to
be fair and complete in a brief

resume. The idea of a Clint
Eastwood tribute seemed dubious
at first, but it was fun enough
(Eastwood graduated from
Oakland Tech) and it's surprising
to remember that the star (ranked
Number One in a recent world
poll) has appeared in four
near-masterpieces in his brief
career ("For a Few Dollars More,"
"The Good, The Bad, and the
Ugly," "Coogan's Bluff" and
"The Beguiled").
Eastwood's first effort as a
director, "Play Misty For Me,"
was resoundingly condemned by
an anxious audience and it
disturbed me in both the right and
the wrong ways. Favorably
because Eastwood managed a
number of efficiently squeamish
sequences and unfavorably
because there were a number of
significant lapses of directorial
judgment. I could sit through it
again, though, which is more than
I can say for some of the recent
films by Godard, Visconti and
Fellini.
The tribute to Vincente
Minnelli was a marathon, with the
clips alone lasting nearly five
hours. In his years at MGM,
Minnelli virtually defined the look
of the American musical at its
best and is one of the few
genuinely talented directors who
at no point was victimized by
studio bosses, as he met the
demands of both commerce and
art.
One of the most extraordinary
films of the festival was Marco
Bellochio's "Nel Nome del Padre"
("In the Name of the Father").
The Italian director's first two
films, "A Fist in the Pocket" and
"China is Near," were briefly, and
controversially, seen in this
country and after several years of
inactivity, he has emerged with a
film of ferocious force and
originality.
Somewhat reminiscent in
subject to "The 400 Blows,"
"Zero de Conduite" and "If. .
it is unique in that it caters to no
preconceptions the audience
might carry with them and
unexpectedly makes no direct
comment on or condemnation of
school or political systems.
Rather, it is a rather oblique study
of power and ways to achieve it
within a given system.

At several points, when
Bellochio had made a certain
point, I thought the film was over,
but then it lurched ahead to
something new, finally ending
with the oddest of alliances
between a student leader cum
fascist and an idiot menial laborer
who speaks in the tongue of an
imaginary planet.
The film is outrageous and
drawn in broad strokes with many
memorable showcase sequences.
Despite the undeniable brilliance
of its execution, it remains
difficult to know just what to
make of the film, for rarely have I
seen so much compressed fury
and passion unleased at nothing in
particular.
Bellochio, more angry than
Truffaut, more political than Vigo
and more realistic than Anderson,
is very specific in his subject and
only slightly less so in the breadth
of his implications and it is the
intensity with which he devotes
himself to his dramatic obsessions
that makes "Nel Nome del Padre"
a remarkable film.
"The Decameron" is the most
crotch conscious film I have ever
seen—the whole thing seems like

one big codpiece. The pleasure of
the film, just as of sex, the film's
subject, diminishes after it is over,
but there is similarly a certain
pleasure to be had from thinking
about it afterwards.
The film is especially delightful
coming from Pier Paolo Pasolini,
some of whose earlier work has
been so literal and arid. Pasolini
has chosen less than a dozen of
Boccaccio's tales to dramatize and
almost all of them are charming,
funny and genuinely bawdy.
One of the most amusing

sequences involves a young
worker who applies for a job at a
convent to see if all he hears
about nuns is true. Posing as a
deaf-mute, the strapping fellow
soon has all the nuns standing in
line to partake of his services.
Eventually the Mother Superior
decides to discover for herself
what makes the nuns so happy
and it is at this point that the man
finally speaks up in protest.
Mother Superior promptly
proclaims his new power of
speech as a miracle and the man's
vocation has been secured for life.

of the American musical at its
best and is one of the few
genuinely talented directors who
at no point was victimized by
studio bosses, as he met the
demands of both commerce and
art.
One of the most extraordinary
films of the festival was Marco
Bellochio's "Nel Nome del Padre"
("In the Name of the Father").
The Italian director's first two
films, "A Fist in the Pocket" and
"China is Near," were briefly, and
controversially, seen in this
country and after several years of
inactivity, he has emerged with a
film of ferocious force and
originality.
Somewhat reminiscent in
subject to "The 400 Blows,"
"Zero de Conduite" and "If. .
it is unique in that it caters to no
preconceptions the audience
might carry with them and
unexpectedly makes no direct
comment on or condemnation of
school or political systems.
Rather, it is a rather oblique study
of power and ways to achieve it
within a given system.

At several points, when
Bellochio had made a certain
point, I thought the film was over,
but then it lurched ahead to
something new, finally ending
with the oddest of alliances
between a student leader cum
fascist and an idiot menial laborer
who speaks in the tongue of an
imaginary planet.
The film is outrageous and
drawn in broad strokes with many
memorable showcase sequences.
Despite the undeniable brilliance
of its execution, it remains
difficult to know just what to
make of the film, for rarely have I
seen so much compressed fury
and passion unleased at nothing in
particular.
Bellochio, more angry than
Truffaut, more political than Vigo
and more realistic than Anderson,
is very specific in his subject and
only slightly less so in the breadth
of his implications and it is the
intensity with which he devotes
himself to his dramatic obsessions
that makes "Nel Nome del Padre"
a remarkable film.
"The Decameron" is the most
crotch conscious film I have ever
seen—the whole thing seems like

one big codpiece. The pleasure of
the film, just as of sex, the film's
subject, diminishes after it is over,
but there is similarly a certain
pleasure to be had from thinking
about it afterwards.
The film is especially delightful
coming from Pier Paolo Pasolini,
some of whose earlier work has
been so literal and arid. Pasolini
has chosen less than a dozen of
Boccaccio's tales to dramatize and
almost all of them are charming,
funny and genuinely bawdy.
One of the most amusing

sequences involves a young
worker who applies for a job at a
convent to see if all he hears
about nuns is true. Posing as a
deaf-mute, the strapping fellow
soon has all the nuns standing in
line to partake of his services.
Eventually the Mother Superior
decides to discover for herself
what makes the nuns so happy
and it is at this point that the man
finally speaks up in protest.
Mother Superior promptly
proclaims his new power of
speech as a miracle and the man's
vocation has been secured for life.

THEY'D RATHER SWITCH—CIine Eastwood's first film as a director, "Play Misty For Me," premiered
last week at the San Francisco Film Festival. Eastwood also stars, but behind the bar is director Don
Siegel, who guided Clint through four of his best pictures. The reason: Eastwood says that he wanted
someone on the set the first day of shooting more nervous than he was, as it's Siegel's debut as an actor.
