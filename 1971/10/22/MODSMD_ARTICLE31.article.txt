# Baez At Berkeley: Singing & Politics
## 
### STU ALLEN 
Before ten thousand people in
U.C.'s Greek Theater in Berkeley
Tuesday night, Joan Baez
appeared in the third of three
weekend concerts. Unlike the first
two, Melina Mercouri (late of
"Never on Sunday") was present,
accepting a tribute to her and the
Greek resistance.
Mercouri read a short
statement decrying the presence
of Vice-President Spiro Agnew at
celebrations given by the military
dictatorship in Greece. She
declared that whether the official
representative of America kisses
the cheeks of the Greek ruler or
vice versa is immaterial: an "ugly
abortion" is sure to result.
Politics aside, Baez again
demonstrated her gifts as a singer,
as in a ringingly clear a capella
chorus of "Oh Happy Day" ("I
wish it were that easy," she
added.).
Intense Concentration
Baez has the skill to move her
audiences to feel the emotions she
presents in her singing. Songs such
as "Sir Gallahad" or "I Shall Be
Released," are not as readily
comprehensible as "Let It Be"
(her final selection), yet the
audience is swept into the song's
mood by the intense
concentration of the performer.
Further evidence of this
artistry is that Baez dispenses with
the introduction before most
songs. Her audience does not need
the warning that another song is
impending and that attention
must be returned to the stage.
Baez draws attention to her
singing with the understatement
of a warmly human artist.
It is not possible to set politics
aside at a Baez concert. From
start to finish, the concert
Tuesday was an unabashedly
political event. Baez has come to
focus on current revolutionary
topics, bringing to them her
earlier Utopian longings.
Her development can best be
illustrated by example. One might
say she has left the era of "There
but for Fortune." and now
concentrates on songs such as
"Bangla Desh," a new work of her

own that she sang but has not yet
recorded.
Curious Approach
The problem with her
approach is that it appears curious
at best to combine the idealism of
John Lennon's "Imagine" (which
she sang in the first half Tuesday)
with exhortations to support the
men on the Coral Sea.
To put it another way, one
wonders why 10,000 people still
sing "no more war" and expect
anything to change by virtue of
their vocal chords. The fantasy of
Baez seems destined to fade away
slowly, along with our lingering
memories of 1967.
Whatever one's views of the
political realities of 1971, let no
one accuse Baez of not practicing
what she preaches. Compare the
$2 price for her concerts with
whatever one must pay to hear
Barbra Streisand, David Crosby,
or even James Taylor.
Baez is a luminary figure
(albeit somewhat historically) not
only in American music, but also
in the American social revolution.
The ovation that echoed across
the U.C.B. campus Tuesday night
was justly deserved.

audience is swept into the song's
mood by the intense
concentration of the performer.
Further evidence of this
artistry is that Baez dispenses with
the introduction before most
songs. Her audience does not need
the warning that another song is
impending and that attention
must be returned to the stage.
Baez draws attention to her
singing with the understatement
of a warmly human artist.
It is not possible to set politics
aside at a Baez concert. From
start to finish, the concert
Tuesday was an unabashedly
political event. Baez has come to
focus on current revolutionary
topics, bringing to them her
earlier Utopian longings.
Her development can best be
illustrated by example. One might
say she has left the era of "There
but for Fortune." and now
concentrates on songs such as
"Bangla Desh," a new work of her

own that she sang but has not yet
recorded.
Curious Approach
The problem with her
approach is that it appears curious
at best to combine the idealism of
John Lennon's "Imagine" (which
she sang in the first half Tuesday)
with exhortations to support the
men on the Coral Sea.
To put it another way, one
wonders why 10,000 people still
sing "no more war" and expect
anything to change by virtue of
their vocal chords. The fantasy of
Baez seems destined to fade away
slowly, along with our lingering
memories of 1967.
Whatever one's views of the
political realities of 1971, let no
one accuse Baez of not practicing
what she preaches. Compare the
$2 price for her concerts with
whatever one must pay to hear
Barbra Streisand, David Crosby,
or even James Taylor.
Baez is a luminary figure
(albeit somewhat historically) not
only in American music, but also
in the American social revolution.
The ovation that echoed across
the U.C.B. campus Tuesday night
was justly deserved.
Before ten thousand people in
U.C.'s Greek Theater in Berkeley
Tuesday night, Joan Baez
appeared in the third of three
weekend concerts. Unlike the first
two, Melina Mercouri (late of
"Never on Sunday") was present,
accepting a tribute to her and the
Greek resistance.
Mercouri read a short
statement decrying the presence
of Vice-President Spiro Agnew at
celebrations given by the military
dictatorship in Greece. She
declared that whether the official
representative of America kisses
the cheeks of the Greek ruler or
vice versa is immaterial: an "ugly
abortion" is sure to result.
Politics aside, Baez again
demonstrated her gifts as a singer,
as in a ringingly clear a capella
chorus of "Oh Happy Day" ("I
wish it were that easy," she
added.).
Intense Concentration
Baez has the skill to move her
audiences to feel the emotions she
presents in her singing. Songs such
as "Sir Gallahad" or "I Shall Be
Released," are not as readily
comprehensible as "Let It Be"
(her final selection), yet the
audience is swept into the song's
mood by the intense
concentration of the performer.
