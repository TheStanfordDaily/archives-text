# No Way To Have Fun Anymore
## 
### 
Last weekend, some friends
and I travelled 400 miles south to
Los Angeles to get our ass kicked
in a loaded game of touch
football.
Life is full of injustices.
Saturday night, about 14 inches
of rain fell in 20 minutes during
the first quarter of the
Stanford-USC game. It never rains
in Los Angeles, you could live
there for 15 years (if you didn't
inhale too often) and you would
not see rain. Who the hell ever
heard of rain in Los Angeles?
So, God waits for me to be
sitting out in the open air on a
hard, yellow, plastic seat,
watching a football game, and
then makes up for all the
opportunities he missed in the last
300 years to drop water on L.A.
The result is almost certain
pneumonia. Where is Justice?
The greatest injustice of all is
the punishment wreaked upon the
staff of the Stanford Daily in the
traditional Ink Bowl football
game that preceeds the Pac-8
varsity competitions.
This year, the USC Daily
Trojan beat the Stanford Daily
18-7. Their technique was simple
and effective.
They cheated.
When the Daily plays touch
football, it plays for fun. That's
why an old man like me plays at
all. At an age (25) when most
touch football players retire,
living comfortably off their
residuals from razor blade and
deodorant commercials, I am still
fighting my way to the top,
determined to be the best
defensive lineman in Ink Bowl
history.
You can imagine our chagrin
when we showed up at USC's
Bovard Field on that cool,
overcast Saturday morning. We

were standing quietly against a
fence, watching the Trojan
Marching Band (minus their MGM
Studio-sale costumes) practice the
half-time show, when someone
pointed out 14 bull elephants
tearing up the turf.

"That," said a cute little thing
who turned out to be The Daily
Trojan's Jezebel of a girl Editor,
"is our Team."
Once I regained consciousness,
fear set it. I am, as I said before, a
defensive lineman. The defensive
lineman's job is, quite simply, to
charge the quarterback and force
him to rush his pass. In order to
do this, he must get by the
opposition's offensive lineman,
whose job it is to protect the
quarterback.
The Daily Trojan's offensive
line consisted of two gentlemen in
football jersies who looked like
they beat up little old ladies
before breakfast. The center was
wearing a number 44, was about
30 years old, and weighed 210
pounds. He could have passed for
a high school football coach. In
fact, he was a high school football
coach.
The other half of the offensive
line wore a number 91, stood
about 5 foot 11, weighed about
215. He looked like he could beat
up number 44. Lucky thing for
44,1 was around instead.
These two characters were
supposed to stop me, at 5 foot 6,

155 pounds, from reaching the
quarterback. Guess who won. The
first time I tried to get by 91, he
brought up an elbow and nearly
separated my jaw from my head.
That finished me for that series of
plays.

ON THE BRINK

The next time I tried to get by
91, he put his elbow into my
stomach. That took me out for
another series. When I got to the
sidelines, I had plenty of
company. Before the end of the
half, two of our players were out
for good. By the end of the game,
we had three players hurt
seriously enough to merit a trip to
the hospital.
The Daily Trojan sure has a
husky bunch of stud reporters.
Or does it? Why, we wondered,
does everyone on their photo staff
weigh over 200 pounds? Why is it
that every other college
newspaper staff consists of weak,
scrawny, nearsighted intellectual
types, while the staff of the Daily
Trojan looks like a platoon of
Marines?

Could it be that the Daily
Trojan had pulled a fast one on
us, that the monsters cleverly
disguised to look like kid
reporters were on the staff of the
paper only long enough to get in a
couple of kicks at some snotty
upstart bastards from Stanford
who think they know everything?
It's really hard to say. Perhaps
The Daily Trojan does have the
huskiest newspaper staff in the
world. Who knows?
Before you make up your
mind, consider the advertisement
reproduced below from the back
page of last Thursday's Daily
Trojan. Could it be true? I
wouldn't want to commit myself.
Consider also that this is a
school that thinks of football a bit
differently from most schools in
the Pac-8. To USC, football isn't a
game, it's a reason for continuing.
And, considering the disgraceful
behavior of the Trojan fans at the
Saturday night game, to say
nothing of the USC team itself
(which managed to draw a
roughing the kicker penalty and a
holding penalty on a single play),
let alone the antics of
second-string quarterback Mike
Rae who attacked a bystander on
the sidelines when it was obvious
that USC was finished,
considering this bizarre behavior,
does it seem that the USC student

thinks more of winning than he
does of playing?
If the ad in the Daily Trojan
was serious (and the behavior of
the alleged newsmen on the field
leads this reporter to consider it
quite possible) then we have a
case far more serious than a bunch
of dumb jocks coming out to kick
in some intellectual's ass.
If the Daily Trojan really felt it
was so important to win a game of
touch football that they had to
appeal for outside help, then we
have a perversion of values, a
bitterness, and (considering the
painful injuries incurred by
members of the Stanford team), a
cruelty, that I suspect may go
beyond the staff of the Daily
Trojan and out to the University
as a whole.
For myself, for my friends on
the staff of this newspaper, and
for most of the staff members of
other college papers we play,
football is a game. It was a game
for the staff of the Ohio State
Daily Lantern who lost to
Stanford in the Ink Rose Bowl.
But at USC, football is no
longer a game, it is life. And
considering that football is
degenerating rapidly at SC, that's
a shame. If it should disappear
altogether, would there be
anything left to that great
university but smog?

TRUCKEDâ€”In most football leagues, getting hit in the jaw by a Mack
truck is good for at least 15 yards. In the Ink Bowl, it is good for a
trip to the local hospital, as Stanford player Jonathan Dedmon
discovered last Saturday. Unfortunately, Dedmon also discovered that
the USC hospital is reluctant to admit injured Stanford players unless
'they are bleeding." Dedmon was treated at Cowell Student Health
Center upon his return to Stanford. By Monday he was able to resume
eating solid foods. A clue to the origin of the "truck" that knocked
Dedmon out of the game is provided by the ad reproduced below
from the USC Daily Trojan. Note particularly the last line.
