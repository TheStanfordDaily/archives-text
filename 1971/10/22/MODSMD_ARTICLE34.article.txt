# Freshman Football
## 
### 
Last week, the "Thunder
Chickens" and Don Bunce led
Stanford to a surprisingly easy
trouncing of the USC Trojans at
the Los Angeles Coliseum. Today
at 2 p.m. on the same field, the
Stanford Frosh team will try to
emulate the varsity, as they too
invade the Southland to do battle
with the highly-touted USC frosh.
The Trojan freshmen, regarded
by many as the best frosh team in
the nation, are led by the
pass-catching team of quarterback
Pay Hayden and end John McKay.
Therefore, it was not at all
surprising that last week the SC
team ripped Cal's very good frosh,
42-14.
Faced with what appears to be
an overwhelming task, Coach Bill
Moultrie, nevertheless, radiates
optimism as his team makes ready
for their first clash".
"I think our strength lies with
the defense. We don't have any
really outstanding people overall;
we have a couple of renowned
people in our defense and middle
linebacker Forrie Martin is one of
these individuals. In my opinion,
if he stays healthy, he is going to
be a great one. We also have Scott
Laildlaw, who's a very good
defensive back and a young man
by the name of Mike Cook, who
has done a very very good job,
also at defensive back."
Offensively, the frosh is less
spectacular. Duf Sundheim has
been entrusted with the
quarterbacking responsibilities. Of
him, Moultrie says,"He runs the
option really well; he has good
speed and is able to run the ball if
he doesn't pitch it." The frosh
also have three other capable
ballcarriers in Martin, Laildlaw
and Mark Gratton, who
apparently has done a good job
thus far.
