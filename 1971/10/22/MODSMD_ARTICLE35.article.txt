# Indians Continue Title Drive
## 
### CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
The Indians have defeated
what many feel are the three
toughest conference opponents on
their schedule, but the other Pac-8
teams are not going to let
Stanford get to Pasadena without
a fight. Washington State's
Cougars will get a chance
tomorrow at 1:30 p.m. to put a
dent in the Indian's unblemished
conference record.
The Cougars will arrive in Palo
Alto with very impressive
statistics for a team with a 2-4
record. The Thunder Chickens'
throttling of the Trojan running
game thrust the Cougars into first
place in the conference rushing
statistics. Led by the Pac-B's
second leading runner, Bernard
Jackson, the Cougars have turned
out an average of 243 yards a
game on the ground. Jackson is
averaging 107 yards per game and
his teammate Ken Grandberry is
sixth in the league with a rushing
average of 60.5.
WSU is led by quarterback Ty
Paine who has piled up an
amazing total of 285 yards on the
ground to rank twelfth in the

conference with a per game
rushing average of 47.5.
Paine's running statistics are
even more impressive when
compared to those of Don Bunce
who also can run the ball very
well. For all the fine runs Bunce
has produced, his rushing average
is only about 17 yards per game.
WSU ranks last in the Pac-8 in
passing, but Paine's performance
against Cal last week should serve
as a warning. Paine hit on 16 of
24 passes for 176 yards and must
be considered a passing as well as

running threat.
The Cougars have been hit by
injuries, however, that may
partially blunt their attack.
Jackson has been slowed but
Coach Jim Sweeney says that he
will be ready for Stanford.
Grandberry is suffering from a
sore shoulder and might not play
tomorrow.
Jim Kehl will start in Hillary
Shockley's place, but Shockley is
ready to play and will see action
tomorrow.
The Cougars fully appreciate

but are not awed by the Indians.
Sweeney says that the Indians are
"a good football team. They have
been playing extremely well on
offense this year without Jim
Plunkett. But the defense is the
real story. They are big, mobile,
and hostile on defense."
Hopefully, the Indians will
have the same type of
appreciation for their opponent's
talents when they take the field
tomorrow trying to take another
step towards the Rose Bowl.

CAN'T TAKE THAT BALL AWAY—John Winesberry turns the corner against USC in the rain last
Saturday night with a Trojan defender trying to wrest the ball from him. The lineman did not get the ball
or Winesberry. Jackie Brown follows his teammates' progress. Working without Hillary Shockley,
Winesberry, Brown, Reggie Sanderson, and Jim Kehl carried the Indian running attack that helped
overpower the men from Troy. Shockley will join his backfield mates tomorrow in Stanford's conference
battle with the Cougars of Washington State.

be considered a passing as well as

running threat.
The Cougars have been hit by
injuries, however, that may
partially blunt their attack.
Jackson has been slowed but
Coach Jim Sweeney says that he
will be ready for Stanford.
Grandberry is suffering from a
sore shoulder and might not play
tomorrow.
Jim Kehl will start in Hillary
Shockley's place, but Shockley is
ready to play and will see action
tomorrow.
The Cougars fully appreciate

but are not awed by the Indians.
Sweeney says that the Indians are
"a good football team. They have
been playing extremely well on
offense this year without Jim
Plunkett. But the defense is the
real story. They are big, mobile,
and hostile on defense."
Hopefully, the Indians will
have the same type of
appreciation for their opponent's
talents when they take the field
tomorrow trying to take another
step towards the Rose Bowl.

CAN'T TAKE THAT BALL AWAY—John Winesberry turns the corner against USC in the rain last
Saturday night with a Trojan defender trying to wrest the ball from him. The lineman did not get the ball
or Winesberry. Jackie Brown follows his teammates' progress. Working without Hillary Shockley,
Winesberry, Brown, Reggie Sanderson, and Jim Kehl carried the Indian running attack that helped
overpower the men from Troy. Shockley will join his backfield mates tomorrow in Stanford's conference
battle with the Cougars of Washington State.
The Indians have defeated
what many feel are the three
toughest conference opponents on
their schedule, but the other Pac-8
teams are not going to let
Stanford get to Pasadena without
a fight. Washington State's
Cougars will get a chance
tomorrow at 1:30 p.m. to put a
dent in the Indian's unblemished
conference record.
The Cougars will arrive in Palo
Alto with very impressive
statistics for a team with a 2-4
record. The Thunder Chickens'
throttling of the Trojan running
game thrust the Cougars into first
place in the conference rushing
statistics. Led by the Pac-B's
second leading runner, Bernard
Jackson, the Cougars have turned
out an average of 243 yards a
game on the ground. Jackson is
averaging 107 yards per game and
his teammate Ken Grandberry is
sixth in the league with a rushing
average of 60.5.
WSU is led by quarterback Ty
Paine who has piled up an
amazing total of 285 yards on the
ground to rank twelfth in the

conference with a per game
rushing average of 47.5.
Paine's running statistics are
even more impressive when
compared to those of Don Bunce
who also can run the ball very
well. For all the fine runs Bunce
has produced, his rushing average
is only about 17 yards per game.
WSU ranks last in the Pac-8 in
passing, but Paine's performance
against Cal last week should serve
as a warning. Paine hit on 16 of
24 passes for 176 yards and must
be considered a passing as well as

running threat.
The Cougars have been hit by
injuries, however, that may
partially blunt their attack.
