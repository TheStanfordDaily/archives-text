# Icemen Lose First Contest
## 
### 
The Stanford Ice Hockey team
opened its season last Tueaday
with a heartbreaking loss to
Belmont, 3-2. The winners scored
the final tally with only thirteen
seconds left in the contest.
Stanford scored first on a fine
passing play as newcomer Tom
Perrot, a grad student from Air
Force, took linemate Mike
Hough's pass at the goalmouth
and tipped the puck by the

hapless Belmont netminder.
Defense dominated the game
until the third period, when
Stanford goalie Rick Bragdon lost
his bid for a shutout as Belmont
capitalized on a two-on-one break.
Bragdon had no chance on the
play as Belmont evened the score
at 1-1. But the Indians regained
their lead as Russ MacAusland's
shot from the left side caromed
off an opposing defenseman into
the net, and once again the
Indians were ahead. Though they
had many opportunities Stanford
never could open up their lead.
Belmont tied the score when
they were a man down. On a
faceoff in the Stanford end the
puck was drawn back to the
Belmont defenseman whose
screened shot somehow avoided
Bragdon and the score stood at
2-2.

Later on in the period,
Belmont gained the man
advantage on a questionable call.
After a mad scramble in front of
the Stanford net, the puck
reached an uncovered Belmont
player whose shot caught the near
corner of the net and Belmont
clinched the victory.
Although the Cards lost, there
were some encouraging signs. The
defense, which last year was at
times inconsistent and
incompetent, was quite effective.
Besides an excellent performance
by Bragdon, Ralph Brown and
former forward Redball Burke
turned in a fine game.
Their next game is against the
defending league champions, the
Berkeley Juniors, on Tuesday.
Gametime is 8 o'clock at the
Belmont rink. Admission is free.
