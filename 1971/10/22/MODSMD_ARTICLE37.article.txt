# Poloists Host SJS Today
## 
### DOUG WILSON 
A possible preview of the
NCAA water polo championships
will take place this afternoon at 3
p.m. at Encina Pool, as the two
top Northern California teams,
Stanford and San Jose State, meet
for the second time this season.
Coach Jim Gaughran's Stanford
Indians are determined to make it
a more enjoyable meeting that the
last.
San Jose State is one of the
three teams which have defeated
the varsity poloists in competition
thus far. UCLA beat Stanford in
sudden-death overtime
competition last weekend, and an
alumni squad defeated the varsity
two weeks ago. As it is doubtful
that the alumni will receive an
invitation to the NCAA
tournament, attention therefore
centers on UCLA, San Jose and
Stanford, generally conceded to

be the three most formidable
sqiifds in the nation this year.
Lose In Finals
In tournament competition at
De Anza three weeks ?go, the
Spartans defeated the Stanford
varsity in the last 8 seconds of
competition in tho finals to win
the Northern California
championship. Gaughran,
however, feels the tables can be
turned this afternoon; 'T think if
we play our regular steadv game
and don't make any mistakes, we
have a good chance to take it."he
said. "However, we have to
maintain our cool at the end, and
not throw the ball away under
pressure, as we have been known
to do."
San Jose, like Stanford, is a
"hard-pressing. fast-breaking
team," according to Gaughran.
"They play like we Dlav exceDt
they don't have a Massimino." A

"Massimino" is a Stanford senior
who leads the team in total
scoring. He is backed strongly by
Mike Davis, Randy Wilkins, Ken
Hammer, Rob Wooley and Bill
Simpkins, all seniors, and Greg
Loitz, a freshman playing varsity
in his first year of competition.
. Gaaghran points to Spartan
goalie Steve Hamman, an
important factor in Stanford's
previous loss, as perhaps the key
obstacle to the Stanford offense.
Stanford will counter with their
own defensive standout, goalie
Pete Gadd.
Important Match
Commenting on the
significance of the game for
national prominence, Gaughran
said"San Jose State is probably
one of the top three teams in the
country, Stanford and UCLA
being the other two. The game
will have no effect as far as the
conference goes (San Jose is not a
member of the Pac-8), but it
might have an effect on seeding
for the national tournament,
assuming we go."
