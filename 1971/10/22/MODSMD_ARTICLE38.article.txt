Chilean Wins Nobel
STOCKHOLM — The Nobel Prize in Literature was
awarded yesterday to Pablo Neruda, a Communist
poet from Chile who says he tries "to interpret a little
of the soul of all Latin America."
His writings helped sway public opinion to bring
the first Marxist government to Chile last year.
President Salvador Allende rewarded him by naming
him ambassador to France.
Neruda, 67, had been considered for the prize for
20 years. He will come to Stockholm Dec. 10 to
receive the $88,000 award.
Asked if he regarded himself as a politically
militant poet, Neruda replied: "Yes I am, as are all
the writers of Latin America."
Venue Change
SAN RAFAEL — The prosecution announced
yesterday it does not oppose moving the
murder-kidnap trial of black revolutionary Angela
Davis from Marin County—but it refused to say where
the trial should go.
Superior Court Judge Richard E. Arnason took
under study the motion for a change of venue and
said it would be the last matter he will rule on. He
announced that arguments on a defense motion to
suppress certain evidence would continue Nov. 1.
Defense attorney Margaret Burhan argued that the
already "meager chance" of Miss Davis receiving a

fair trial "is being eroded by a hostile press and
government."
The morning session was interrupted briefly when
bailiffs evicted two men for raising a clinched fist
salute as Miss Davis returned to the courtroom from a
recess.
Report Urges Reforms
SACRAMENTO — A controversial report on
California's strife-torn penal system calling for
massive reforms to make prisons more like "the free
world" was released to the public yesterday by the
State Board of Corrections.
The board had kept the $266,000 study under
wraps since last June 28, but its principal
recommendations were leaked to newsmen two weeks
ago.
They include proposals to shut down California's
top-security San Quentin and Folsom prisons, and
revamp probation and parole systems.
Maoists Denounced
WASHINGTON — A gunsmith and his wife, saying
they had been undercover informants for the FBI,
told Congress today that pro-Maoist militants
organized the demonstration against President Nixon
in San Jose last year.
Lawrence and Betty Sue Goff told the House
Internal Security Committee about the activities of
the Revolutionary Union, which they termed a highly

disciplined and well-armed group of Communist
Chinese supporters.
They said the Union was created in late 1965 by a
man they identified as English professor H. Bruce
Franklin. Franklin left the Union in a strategy dispute
shortly after the Nixon incident.
Committee Chairman Richard H. Ichord (D-Mo.),
after hearing the Goffs' testimony, branded the
secretive organization "a band of fanatics."
It was learned that the committee will hear
additional testimony on the Union next week.
The Goffs, former Christian missionaries in Latin
America, made reference to what they believed to be
an assassination-and-sabotage squad among some of
the Union members.
They began their association with the Union in the
fall of 1969 and left it this spring "after we were
found out."
Russ Protest Shooting
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. — Soviet U.N. Ambassador
Jacob A. Malik, angry at a shooting attack on the
Soviet U.N. mission, accused the United States
yesterday of failing in its obligation to protect
Russian diplomats stationed in New York. The
United States apologized for the incident.
Malik accused the Jewish Defense League of firing
the shots Wednesday night and said the JDL's leader,
Rabbi Meir Kahane, may have planned the attack on
instructions from Israel.
No one was injured in the shooting.
