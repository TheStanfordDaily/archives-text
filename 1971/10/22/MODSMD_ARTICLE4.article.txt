# Palo Alto City Police Reorganize
## 
### 
The Palo Alto Police Department has reorganized into
three divisions, and promoted officers to fill new positions
for one captain, two lieutenants, and a sergeant, Chief
James Zurcher announced yesterday morning at an
informal news conference.
The Department's new organizational structure,
designed to improve administrative cooperation in
investigative and follow-up activities, establishes separate
divisions for Field Services, including all normal patrol
activities; Support Services, especially those involving desk
activities, equipment, and communications; and
Investigative Services, to administer all investigative
activities and conduct major investigations.
The Investigative Services Division, which contains ten
officers, will continue present intelligence operations,
"euphemistically called information gathering activities" by
the Department.
The reorganization has shifted Assistant Chief Clarence
Anderson, who was commander of uniformed operations,
to purely administrative functions.
Zurcher plans to integrate his new organizational
structure with the "team management" concept with which
the Department has experimented for the past nine
months. This "team policing" employs three separate shifts
of officers, each of which is independently capable of
handling any police problem.

Responding to questions on other topics, Zurcher
admitted that officers with rifles have been stationed on
rooftops during some Lytton Plaza concerts. However, he
maintained that the rifles were kept in sealed scabbards at
all times, and left lying on the rooftops, without being used
in any threatening manner.
He added that he had ordered officers present only
when he learned, from information police had gathered
before the concerts, that there was the possibility of
gunfire in the area. He produced copies of literature printed
by Venceremos, and cited threats made against the lives of
policemen as an example of the provocation which moved
him to order officers to take rifles with them.
Both the new captain, former lieutenant Gary Tatum,
and the new sergeant, Leo Peart, have worked on the
department's "Special Activities Planning Unit," which
decides upon the tactics to be used at Lytton Plaza
disturbances, demonstrations, and other crowd situations.
Though applications were taken from officers
throughout the state, all of the newly promoted officers are
from within the Palo Alto department.
Promoted to lieutenant were Ed Oblander, who will be a
team lieutenant, and Bob Elliot, who will continue in his
position as community relations officer.
