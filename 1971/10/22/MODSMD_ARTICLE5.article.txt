# Massive Confusion At Polls Postpones Balloting Till Tuesday
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
Massive confusion at the polls
yesterday forced ASSU Elections
Commissioner Alice Furimoto to
invalidate the senatorial and
referendum balloting and order a new
election for Tuesday and Wednesday.
Lack of manpower, lack of
sufficient ballots, improper
electioneering techniques, and a dispute
over what color a valid activities sticker
should be were among the factors that
Furimoto cited as decisive in a
statement issued last night.
The main reason, though, was a lack

of any procedure to stop a student
from voting more than once.
"I incorrectly decided to eliminate
the voter registration signature list to
save manpower," admitted Furimoto.
"This meant that there was no
cross-checking on voting to stop double
voting."
Little Help
Her statement also listed "having so
little help (that) polls were closing
down when the next person didn't
show, no check on electioneering
around the polls . . . materials being left
unattended, polls not opening on time,
and no tables or chairs at the voting
stations" as major complaints.
Another problem arose when poll
workers, who were instructed to honor
only blue activity stickers, turned away
a number of students who had been
incorrectly given yellow stickers on
registration day.
This last was apparently the fault of
the registrars. Armista M. Cook,
information secretary at the Registrar's
Office, said that a few students had
been given yellow stickers when no
blue ones were available. She said those
with yellow stickers may exchange
them for blue ones at the Registrar's
Office in the Old Union.
The problem of color had been
worked out, however, and voters
arriving at the polls after 11 a.m.

reported no difficulty in voting.
Furimoto was not so successful,
though, in working out the other
questions, and at 1 p.m. issued the
invalidation order.
Cloudy Issue
The issue of whether or not
elections can be constitutionally
rescheduled so quickly is somewhat
cloudy. ASSU Senate Parliamentarian
Herb Borock said that the organization
bylaws say an election can be held only
when a detailed plan has been
submitted to the President five days in
advance. The plan would have to have
been in yesterday afternoon to qualify
under that provision.
Doug McHenry, head of the ASSU
Council of Presidents, speaking on
KZSU radio last night, said he didn't
have a specific plan. "But," he added,
"there is another provision that says
that first quarter elections have to be
held within three weeks of the
beginning of the first quarter. That
means Monday or Tuesday. And we did
discuss formulating plans for a better
election this (Thursday) afternoon."
Furomoto's comment about
electioneering was apparently sparked
by a number of unsigned posters
around the polling places urging
students to vote no on the
referendums. Ann Kimball, a member
of the Council of Presidents, called the

anonymous postings "a very low blow"
and said they "set a dangerous
precedent. This time it was just on an
issue. But next time it might be
name-calling or false charges about a
candidate."
Polls Close
Most of the eight polling places had
closed by noon for lack of either
ballots or people to distribute them.
"Not very many people showed up,"
Kimball said, "and those who did
showed a lack of support of the
commissioner. They were pretty
uncooperative and some of them were
downright unpleasant to Alice."
Furimoto is calling a meeting of all
interested parties Monday night at 7 :30
in Tresidder Union to go over
procedures for the Tuesday balloting.
Kimball said the Council of Presidents
and the Elections Commission intended
to ask candidates for the 30 senate
positions and backers of the
referendums to provide election
workers to help out.
Diane Fields, another Council of
Presidents member, said that
nominations for candidacy would not
be reopened. "The constitution won't
let us," she said. She added that
balloting by students on foreign
campuses will not be affected by the
postponement.

Diane Fields, another Council of
Presidents member, said that
nominations for candidacy would not
be reopened. "The constitution won't
let us," she said. She added that
balloting by students on foreign
campuses will not be affected by the
postponement.
Massive confusion at the polls
yesterday forced ASSU Elections
Commissioner Alice Furimoto to
invalidate the senatorial and
referendum balloting and order a new
election for Tuesday and Wednesday.
Lack of manpower, lack of
sufficient ballots, improper
electioneering techniques, and a dispute
over what color a valid activities sticker
should be were among the factors that
Furimoto cited as decisive in a
statement issued last night.
The main reason, though, was a lack

of any procedure to stop a student
from voting more than once.
"I incorrectly decided to eliminate
the voter registration signature list to
save manpower," admitted Furimoto.
"This meant that there was no
cross-checking on voting to stop double
voting."
Little Help
Her statement also listed "having so
little help (that) polls were closing
down when the next person didn't
show, no check on electioneering
around the polls . . . materials being left
unattended, polls not opening on time,
and no tables or chairs at the voting
stations" as major complaints.
Another problem arose when poll
workers, who were instructed to honor
only blue activity stickers, turned away
a number of students who had been
incorrectly given yellow stickers on
registration day.
This last was apparently the fault of
the registrars. Armista M. Cook,
information secretary at the Registrar's
Office, said that a few students had
been given yellow stickers when no
blue ones were available. She said those
with yellow stickers may exchange
them for blue ones at the Registrar's
Office in the Old Union.
The problem of color had been
worked out, however, and voters
arriving at the polls after 11 a.m.

reported no difficulty in voting.
Furimoto was not so successful,
though, in working out the other
questions, and at 1 p.m. issued the
invalidation order.
Cloudy Issue
The issue of whether or not
elections can be constitutionally
rescheduled so quickly is somewhat
cloudy. ASSU Senate Parliamentarian
Herb Borock said that the organization
bylaws say an election can be held only
when a detailed plan has been
submitted to the President five days in
advance. The plan would have to have
been in yesterday afternoon to qualify
under that provision.
Doug McHenry, head of the ASSU
Council of Presidents, speaking on
KZSU radio last night, said he didn't
have a specific plan. "But," he added,
"there is another provision that says
that first quarter elections have to be
held within three weeks of the
beginning of the first quarter. That
means Monday or Tuesday. And we did
discuss formulating plans for a better
election this (Thursday) afternoon."
Furomoto's comment about
electioneering was apparently sparked
by a number of unsigned posters
around the polling places urging
students to vote no on the
referendums. Ann Kimball, a member
of the Council of Presidents, called the

anonymous postings "a very low blow"
and said they "set a dangerous
precedent. This time it was just on an
issue. But next time it might be
name-calling or false charges about a
candidate."
Polls Close
Most of the eight polling places had
closed by noon for lack of either
ballots or people to distribute them.
"Not very many people showed up,"
Kimball said, "and those who did
showed a lack of support of the
commissioner. They were pretty
uncooperative and some of them were
downright unpleasant to Alice."
Furimoto is calling a meeting of all
interested parties Monday night at 7 :30
in Tresidder Union to go over
procedures for the Tuesday balloting.
Kimball said the Council of Presidents
and the Elections Commission intended
to ask candidates for the 30 senate
positions and backers of the
referendums to provide election
workers to help out.
Diane Fields, another Council of
Presidents member, said that
nominations for candidacy would not
be reopened. "The constitution won't
