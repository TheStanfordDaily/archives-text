# Drug Counseling Is Planned
## 
### GARY CLARK 
In a move which is probably an
American university first, Stanford is
establishing a drop-in drug counseling
center in a concerted effort to relieve
the problem of drug abuse in the
Stanford community.
The project, called "The Bridge," is
unique in being one of the first to
combine the resources of psychiatric,
medical, counseling, and student
manpower to provide "a positive
alternative to a drug-oriented life
style."
Associate Dean of Students and
Project Co-sponsor Bill Leland points
out that The Bridge is not a "stamp out
drug " program, but is designed,
instead, to operate on a more personal
level.

Leland said, "If people find their
lives in a pattern that is destructive and
come to a point where they are seeking
to establish a positive alternative, then
we can provide support to help them
achieve their goal."
The Bridge will be housed in an old
University house at 523 Salvatierra and
will be operative some time in early
November. Plans call for one live-in
member and a Fall Quarter program of
twelve-hours-a-day counseling and crisis
intervention. Full 24-hour telephone
and drop-in service is planned for
Winter Quarter.
Atmosphere of Action
Leland said that expansion plans
inlcude an outreach education program,
a rural hills re-orientation house in

1972-73, and a variety of activities
including music, art, crafts, yoga and
meditation. Leland said, "We want to
establish an atmosphere of action
beyond just the problems of drugs."
The heart of the program, according
to co-sponsor Martha Martin, is the use
of peer-group counseling. To this end a
SWOPSI course was developed
concurrently to train students in the
techniques of drug counseling.
Eventually, it is hoped that a pool of
21-40 qualified volunteers can be
developed.
The approach will be mostly
informal "rap sessions." A person
seeking support in a time of crisis, or a
person just wanting to talk, can do so
with someone who is conversant with

drugs and drug culture and comes from
a similar academic environment. No
individual records will be kept.
Diverse Sources
The drop-in center has received
support from widely-diverse sources.
The facilities and experience of the
Student Health and Psychiatric services,
and if need be, the Medical Center were
part of the program concept from its
inception. Seeking to cooperate with
any program which combats drug
abuse, the Santa Clara County Sheriff
will try "to stay as far out of the way
as possible."
The plan for a drug abuse program
came about when a survey conducted
by people who were "inside the drug
scene" found that there was "increasing
involvement with 'hard drugs' (heroin,
cocaine, methedrine), and that the
magnitude of the problem is at best
stable and probably increasing."
The survey, part of the initial report
for The Bridge, went on to report that
roughly 25 to 30 percent of Palo Alto
drug addicts are Stanford drop outs. It
continues, "A conservative estimate
suggests that between two and five
percent of present Stanford students
are involved in some use of heroin."
The main problem the center faces
at present is lack of funds. A budget of
$35,000 has been projected for the first
year. The major portion of this
allocation goes to pay student
counselors,for, as the initial report
notes, "dedication alone is not
sufficient for sustained effort." So far,
$3,000 has been obtained from private
sources and alumni contributions.
As the concept of the program
firmed up last spring the sponsors were
pressed to organize a program and a
presentation to get government funds.
Unfortunately, the deadlines could not
be met and it will be next summer
before the program can be considered
for funding through HUD and the
National Institute of Mental Health.


DROP-INâ€”Staff members of Stanford's new drop-in center prepare their house
for its opening next November. The center, called 'The Bridge," will provide
counseling for students with drug problems.
