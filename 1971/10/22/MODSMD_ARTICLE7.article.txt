# Overkill In French Press
## 
### 
TOURS, France, Oct. 17-Had I
enjoyed greater foresight and not
rushed quite so hard to describe
Christine Corcoran and The Great
Drug Bust (The Daily, Oct. 1 9), I
might have sensed that the story
would receive unusual play in the
French press.
Le Monde is usually considered
among the top newspapers in the
world; it is, in effect, the New
York Times of Prance (although it
is generally more anti-government
than is the Times.) However,
Stanford-in-France XXIII was
startled—if not amazed—to read
the following two-column
headline over the paper's front
page lead story on Friday, Oct.
15:
"The struggle against deadly
drugs: An important (serious)
drug case is discovered in Tours.
Fourteen young people are placed
at the police department's
disposition."
The placement of the story
(equivalent to the positioning of
the story in the upper right-hand
corner of The Daily every
morning) indicated Le Monde's
editors felt that The Great
Drug Bust was the most important
story in the world on Oct. 15.
Who's kidding whom?
The paper then went on to
factually describe Corcoran's
method of operation: she would
buy hashish in Amsterdam at
about 50 cents a gram and resell it
to American and French students
in Tours for about $2 a gram.
(Other papers have indicated that
she smuggled some 20 kilograms
of hashish from Holland to Tours
during a seven-month period.)
Nothing is really unusual in all
of that: the existence of
Stanford-in-France was detailed
on the front page of France's
most influential newspaper and
the success of the government's
anti-drug campaign was proven to
some degree. And the paper (on
an inside page) published excerpts
from a letter written by a resident
of Tours commenting on her son's
painful experiences in the
Amsterdam drug scene.
In all fairness, it should be
noted that Le Monde did a
quieter, more interpretive piece in
the next afternoon's paper which,
among other items, noted that
local students have told police
that Corcoran was not the only
pusher in Tours, commented that
there have been no other arrests
for drugs here since 1969, and
explained the mayor's campaign
against "moral and physiological
pollution" (which presumably
includes hashish and LSD).
But the best was yet to come.
France-Soir, the largest newspaper

in the country, that afternoon
published a huge lead story under
the headling: "Drug traffickers:
38 percent of the French favor
the death penalty." That headling
(used to draw attention to one of
the paper's frequent polls) tells
quite a bit about the French

people (who are, incidently,
holding a debate about the death
penalty): the mention of
drugs-any drug—sets off a
near-Pavlovian wave of
simultaneous hatred and paranoia,
fueled, in part, by ignorance of
the effects of different drugs
(heroin and hashish seem to be
identical to most of the French
public) and a strong governmental
"law and order" stance against all
drugs, no doubt encouraged by
American authorities.
But the grim details of the

France-Soir poll were just a
warm-up for the large page-two
story on the "affair" in Tours.
The headline for that story: "It is
a smart (wise) student who
furnished heroin to the young
people of Tours." Heroin, mind
you. The article itself never

km? a&kn.

mentioned heroin; it named only
hashish and LSD (for which
Corcoran apparently is not
charged).
And then there is The
Photograph: somehow, the
newspaper seems to have been
able to blow up a passport picture
to about four-by-twelve inches; as
you open the paper, Chris
Corcoran's life-size eyes stare you
right in the face.
The first paragraph of the
France-Soir story might be of
interest to (i) members or

supporters of the Women's
Liberation movement and (ii)
journalism students:
"Long black hair, well-formed
lips, her eyes clear and sweet,
Christine Corcoran, despite
seeming to be a young girl of good
family who studied hard,
furnished drugs to 100 young
people in Tours."
Other papers had a similar
field-day with the story. Perhaps
one more deserves mention: the
conservative La Croix ran a
full-page story entitled "Drugs,
the cancer that corrodes youth."
The headline speaks for the
article.
At this point (before her
scheduled December trial), only
two conclusions safely may be
drawn: (i) the French people are
powerfully scared of "drugs" and
are unable to differentiate
between any of them; and (ii) this
attitude—which may be
characterized as ignorance—is
encouraged, if not produced and
perpetuated, by slanted reporting
and blatent editorializing such as
that quoted from France-Soir and
by heavy-handed headline writers
on many papers, including Le
Monde.
