## War Complicity On Campus 
### 
Last February, 8 6 women of
the Stanford community wrote to
President Lyman asking that the
Armed Forces and companies
manufacturing weapons of war be
refused the use of Stanford
facilities for recruitment purposes.
We maintained that recruitment
of highly trained Stanford
graduates was not an exercise of
free speech but a significant step
in the actual process of
production. We expressed our
conviction that war
manufacturing was not the proper
function of a University.
In April, after President Lyman
turned down our request, a
campus referendum was held in
which students voted by a wide
margin to ban military and war
production recruitment from
Stanford. Since the referendum
was seemingly ignored by the
administration, we asked
Professor Sanford Dornbusch,
Chairman of the Faculty Senate,
to take the issue before the
Senate's Executive Committee,
which he agreed to do. At this
point, however, President Lyman
turned to the Committee on
Services to Students for advice on

the question, so it was not
submitted to the Senate. In late
spring a member of our group,
along with members of Columbae
House, testified at length before
the Committee on Student
Services. As far as we know, the
Committee is still deliberating.
Meanwhile, the Navy, the Air
Force, and four of the nation's
leading war contractors have been
scheduled to use the Placement
Center during the week of
November 1. Stanford facilities
will be used by the following
organizations:
Monday, Nov. 1: The Naval
Engineering Laboratory and
McDonnell Douglas Astronautics
Co. McDonnell Douglas, sth
largest war contractor in the U.S.,
held $883 million in military
contracts in 1 970, including
contracts for the F-4 Phantom jet,
the F-l 5 advanced tactical fighter,
and battlefield weapons.
Tuesday, Nov. 2: Hughes
Aircraft Co., which held $496
million in war contracts in 1970,
mainly for electronic warfare
devices; and Litton Industries,
ninth largest war contractor in the
U.S.

Wednesday, Nov. 3: The U.S.
Air Force, which has dropped
more than five million tons of
bombs on the people of
Indochina, and which continues at
this moment to destroy that land
and its people.
Thursday, Nov. 4: TRW
Systems Group, which held $17 9
million in war contracts last year,
and the Honeywell Corporation,
which is the 16 th largest military
producer in the nation. Honeywell
makes the notorious cluster bomb
which explodes into thousands of
steel darts especially designed to
pierce and tear human flesh but
leave buildings and machinery
intact.
It is clear that during the first
week of November Stanford
University will be directly
involved in the business of making
bombs and the planes that carry
them, and providing the pilots to
fly these planes. We do not believe
that Stanford should take part in
operations that have produced
more than a million civilian
casualties in Vietnam. We do not
believe that those who profit from
the death oif helpless children
should conduct their bloody

business on a University campus.
We intend to picket the Placement
Center on November 1,2,3, and
4 and hope you will join us.

Services to Students for advice on

the question, so it was not
submitted to the Senate. In late
spring a member of our group,
along with members of Columbae
House, testified at length before
the Committee on Student
Services. As far as we know, the
Committee is still deliberating.
Meanwhile, the Navy, the Air
Force, and four of the nation's
leading war contractors have been
scheduled to use the Placement
Center during the week of
November 1. Stanford facilities
will be used by the following
organizations:
Monday, Nov. 1: The Naval
Engineering Laboratory and
McDonnell Douglas Astronautics
Co. McDonnell Douglas, sth
largest war contractor in the U.S.,
held $883 million in military
contracts in 1 970, including
contracts for the F-4 Phantom jet,
the F-l 5 advanced tactical fighter,
and battlefield weapons.
Tuesday, Nov. 2: Hughes
Aircraft Co., which held $496
million in war contracts in 1970,
mainly for electronic warfare
devices; and Litton Industries,
ninth largest war contractor in the
U.S.

Wednesday, Nov. 3: The U.S.
Air Force, which has dropped
more than five million tons of
bombs on the people of
Indochina, and which continues at
this moment to destroy that land
and its people.
Thursday, Nov. 4: TRW
Systems Group, which held $17 9
million in war contracts last year,
and the Honeywell Corporation,
which is the 16 th largest military
producer in the nation. Honeywell
makes the notorious cluster bomb
which explodes into thousands of
steel darts especially designed to
pierce and tear human flesh but
leave buildings and machinery
intact.
It is clear that during the first
week of November Stanford
University will be directly
involved in the business of making
bombs and the planes that carry
them, and providing the pilots to
fly these planes. We do not believe
that Stanford should take part in
operations that have produced
more than a million civilian
casualties in Vietnam. We do not
believe that those who profit from
the death oif helpless children
should conduct their bloody

business on a University campus.
We intend to picket the Placement
Center on November 1,2,3, and
4 and hope you will join us.

Last February, 8 6 women of
the Stanford community wrote to
President Lyman asking that the
Armed Forces and companies
manufacturing weapons of war be
refused the use of Stanford
facilities for recruitment purposes.
We maintained that recruitment
of highly trained Stanford
graduates was not an exercise of
free speech but a significant step
in the actual process of
production. We expressed our
conviction that war
manufacturing was not the proper
function of a University.
In April, after President Lyman
turned down our request, a
campus referendum was held in
which students voted by a wide
margin to ban military and war
production recruitment from
Stanford. Since the referendum
was seemingly ignored by the
administration, we asked
Professor Sanford Dornbusch,
Chairman of the Faculty Senate,
to take the issue before the
Senate's Executive Committee,
which he agreed to do. At this
point, however, President Lyman
turned to the Committee on
Services to Students for advice on

the question, so it was not
