## Skinner Bones 
### 
One hardly needs the excessive
verbosity of Bill Evers to question
the latest version of the
"technology of behavior" in
Skinner's Beyond Freedom and
Dignity.
Skinner's ideas about there
being no "autonomous man"
behind behavior are interesting
and worth debate, but they are
badly marred by the autonomous
man called Skinner, who sits too
obviously at the top of each page
holding an annoying sledge of
sarcasm and logical irony over the
head of his reader.
To trace
behavior to "feelings" or
"purposes" is no explanation at
all, says Skinner. Behavior
originates in the environment,
which stimulates organisms into
action, and then selects those
actions useful for survival. If the
organism "feels" anything while
acting, this is irrelevant. So is any
feeling which does not issue in
visible behavior. Behavior alone is

Barry wood

important for the behavioral
technologist.
But Skinner does not
"explain" (the word is his) how
the "environment" stimulates
behavior. He denies what he calls
the "autonomous man" as a
source of behavior but is willing
to acknowledge an environment
full of autonomous men and
things capable of stimulating
behavior. The role of the
behavioral technologist is that of
creating a "perfect" environment
which will stimulate only socially
acceptable behavior!
Now there is a severe logical
problem here. The theory of
behavioral technology does not
derive from a scientist called B.F.
Skinner; it is rather a piece of
behavior (lecturing, book-writing)
which his environment has
stimulated. One wonders what the
criteria of "truth" or "validity" is,
since the views of his opponents
are likewise stimulated by the
environment! In short, Skinner's
theory is not the theory of a
"free" man. On the other hand,
when he wants to apply it he then
becomes an environment to
allows hirn to
"freely" manipulate (or, at least,
advocate manipulating) others
who are "beyond freedom and
dignity."
This knot is, of course, the one
tied round the neck of every
determinist, who necessarily
implicates himself in his own
deterministic system, but wishes
to be "free" of the system long
enough to collect his royalty
check on an "original" idea.

"No one is responsible" is
logically identical to the
statement "Everyone is
responsible," since the class "no
one" excludes no one and
therefore includes everyone. Thus,
showing that we are related to
everything and everyone in the
environment shows that everyone
and everything belongs in the
show. Instead of no one being a
source of behavior, everyone is a
source.
I'm sure Mr. Skinner would call
this "mysticism," since it would
not "explain" behavior to him.
On the other hand, Mr. Skinner's
"explanations" tell us nothing
either—as do all explanations
designed merely for control. Man
in his theory is the hollow man of
T.S. Eliot, or worse the skeleton
with no flesh. But this Skinner
Bones creature does not include
the final, deep-down, inside,
impossible-to-fathom mystery
that flesh-and-blood people are.
To say again (and it needs to
be said again and again) that man
is a mystery eluding final
formulation, and manipulation, is
not mysticism, but a statement of
wonder about oneself and
humanity. I assume that Mr.
Skinner has sometimes felt a sense
of wonder about things. Having
read Maslow, he knows about
"peak experiences." But what is
conspicuously missing from his
"technology of behavior" is a
saving sense of the incredible
beings he wants to manipulate. He
is one himself, but fails in all his
published work to communicate
it.

behavioral technologist is that of
creating a "perfect" environment
which will stimulate only socially
acceptable behavior!
Now there is a severe logical
problem here. The theory of
behavioral technology does not
derive from a scientist called B.F.
Skinner; it is rather a piece of
behavior (lecturing, book-writing)
which his environment has
stimulated. One wonders what the
criteria of "truth" or "validity" is,
since the views of his opponents
are likewise stimulated by the
environment! In short, Skinner's
theory is not the theory of a
"free" man. On the other hand,
when he wants to apply it he then
becomes an environment to
allows hirn to
"freely" manipulate (or, at least,
advocate manipulating) others
who are "beyond freedom and
dignity."
This knot is, of course, the one
tied round the neck of every
determinist, who necessarily
implicates himself in his own
deterministic system, but wishes
to be "free" of the system long
enough to collect his royalty
check on an "original" idea.

"No one is responsible" is
logically identical to the
statement "Everyone is
responsible," since the class "no
one" excludes no one and
therefore includes everyone. Thus,
showing that we are related to
everything and everyone in the
environment shows that everyone
and everything belongs in the
show. Instead of no one being a
source of behavior, everyone is a
source.
I'm sure Mr. Skinner would call
this "mysticism," since it would
not "explain" behavior to him.
On the other hand, Mr. Skinner's
"explanations" tell us nothing
either—as do all explanations
designed merely for control. Man
in his theory is the hollow man of
T.S. Eliot, or worse the skeleton
with no flesh. But this Skinner
Bones creature does not include
the final, deep-down, inside,
impossible-to-fathom mystery
that flesh-and-blood people are.
To say again (and it needs to
be said again and again) that man
is a mystery eluding final
formulation, and manipulation, is
not mysticism, but a statement of
wonder about oneself and
humanity. I assume that Mr.
Skinner has sometimes felt a sense
of wonder about things. Having
read Maslow, he knows about
"peak experiences." But what is
conspicuously missing from his
"technology of behavior" is a
saving sense of the incredible
beings he wants to manipulate. He
is one himself, but fails in all his
published work to communicate
it.

English and Humanities.)
One hardly needs the excessive
verbosity of Bill Evers to question
the latest version of the
"technology of behavior" in
Skinner's Beyond Freedom and
Dignity.
Skinner's ideas about there
being no "autonomous man"
behind behavior are interesting
and worth debate, but they are
badly marred by the autonomous
man called Skinner, who sits too
obviously at the top of each page
holding an annoying sledge of
sarcasm and logical irony over the
head of his reader.
To trace
behavior to "feelings" or
"purposes" is no explanation at
all, says Skinner. Behavior
originates in the environment,
which stimulates organisms into
action, and then selects those
actions useful for survival. If the
organism "feels" anything while
acting, this is irrelevant. So is any
feeling which does not issue in
visible behavior. Behavior alone is

important for the behavioral
technologist.
But Skinner does not
"explain" (the word is his) how
the "environment" stimulates
behavior. He denies what he calls
the "autonomous man" as a
source of behavior but is willing
to acknowledge an environment
full of autonomous men and
things capable of stimulating
behavior. The role of the
behavioral technologist is that of
creating a "perfect" environment
