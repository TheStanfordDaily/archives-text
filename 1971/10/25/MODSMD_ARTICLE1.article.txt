# Employee Grievance Plan Features Outside Arbiter
## 
### CHRIS PECK 
A revised set of guidelines for
Stanford employees who have
grievances against the University goes
into effect today.
The new grievance policy outlines a
plan whereby an outside hearing officer
will have the final say in grievance
cases. This outside arbitrator will be
selected from a list of five names
submitted by a panel of three
professors from universities other than
Stanford.
Vice President for Business and
Finance Robert R. Augsburger has
called the new policy "an effort to
achieve a fair and equitable means for
resolving employee complaints."
But the President of the United
Stanford Employees (USE), Jim Burke,
said last night his organization "was not
at all happy" with the new policy.
Burke pledged "to continue to create a
situation among the Stanford
employees that will force the
University management to make
changes in the grievance procedures
that truly reflect the needs of Stanford
employees."
Under Attack
Stanford's grievance procedure has
been under attack by the USE for more
than a year and was especially criticized
last April after five Stanford Medical
Center employees were fired following
a sit-in at the center.
All five of the fired employees
requested grievance hearings to discuss

their dismissals but felt that the
machinay for airing grievances was
heavily loaded in favor of the
administration since President Lyman
had the final say in all grievance cases.
USE President Burke said that while
his group is in favor of the new policy
of outside arbitration in grievance
hearings, the way in which the outside
arbitrator will now be chosen still
favors the university management over
the employees.
"Even though the new grievance
policy pretends to make management
and labor equals in grievance hearings,
the fact remains that the President of
the University selects the men who will
pick the arbitrators."
President Lyman has already named
the first three persons who will serve on
the.arbitration panel. They are: UCLA
Law Professor Benjamin Aaron, Wayne
State Law Professor William Gould, and
Jean McKelvey, a Professor at the New
York State School of Industrial and
Labor Relations.
Beginning today, when a Stanford
employee asks for a grievance hearing
these three people will be in charge of
finding five possible arbitrators to
preside over the hearing.
Choosing One
From this list of five possible
hearing officers, the employee who
asked for the hearing and the
University representative will each be
allowed to strike two names of
arbitrators they feel to be unsuitable.

That leaves the arbitrator to hear the
case.
Another major complaint of last
spring's grievance procedure was over
whether dissatisfaction with University
policy was in itself a suitable reason for
calling a grievance hearing.
The new policy says that
disagreement with University policy is
not grounds for calling a full grievance
hearing because, in the words of
Augsburger, "it is the judgment of the
administration that a hearing before an
outside hearing officer is an
inappropriate forum for consideration
of such questions."
Burke sharply disagreed with this
section of the new policy noting that
"by not allowing questions of
University policy to be grounds for a
grievance hearing the only thing
employees have a right to challenge is
whether existing policy has been
applied to them equally. They cannot
question whether or not University
policy is in itself just or equitable."
"In the past we have objected to the
way that Stanford employees have no
voice in the policy of the University,"
Burke added, "and we will continue to
object to this situation."
Three Hearings Now
There are at least three grievance
hearings before the University now and
USE spokesman Burke says"it is very
possible" that these grievants will
change to the new procedures even
though they feel the new procedures
don't go far enough in giving employees
equity with management.
The new grievance policy also
outlines situations when a grievance
hearing is possible and the machinery
by which a case can be presented
before an outside arbitrator.
Whenever an employee feels he has
been "improperly or unfairly treated
by the University" and whenever an
employee has been "dismissed,
suspended or otherwise disciplined by a
University officer"he may ask for a
grievance hearing.
In all cases, the employee must first
explain in writing how he believes he
has been adversely affected and after
his written explanation is reviewed by
University officials he may ask for an
outside arbitrator to enter the case and
settle it.
An employee may select any
University employee to represent him
at his hearing.

Law Professor Benjamin Aaron, Wayne
State Law Professor William Gould, and
Jean McKelvey, a Professor at the New
York State School of Industrial and
Labor Relations.
Beginning today, when a Stanford
employee asks for a grievance hearing
these three people will be in charge of
finding five possible arbitrators to
preside over the hearing.
Choosing One
From this list of five possible
hearing officers, the employee who
asked for the hearing and the
University representative will each be
allowed to strike two names of
arbitrators they feel to be unsuitable.

That leaves the arbitrator to hear the
case.
Another major complaint of last
spring's grievance procedure was over
whether dissatisfaction with University
policy was in itself a suitable reason for
calling a grievance hearing.
The new policy says that
disagreement with University policy is
not grounds for calling a full grievance
hearing because, in the words of
Augsburger, "it is the judgment of the
administration that a hearing before an
outside hearing officer is an
inappropriate forum for consideration
of such questions."
Burke sharply disagreed with this
section of the new policy noting that
"by not allowing questions of
University policy to be grounds for a
grievance hearing the only thing
employees have a right to challenge is
whether existing policy has been
applied to them equally. They cannot
question whether or not University
policy is in itself just or equitable."
"In the past we have objected to the
way that Stanford employees have no
voice in the policy of the University,"
Burke added, "and we will continue to
object to this situation."
Three Hearings Now
There are at least three grievance
hearings before the University now and
USE spokesman Burke says"it is very
possible" that these grievants will
change to the new procedures even
though they feel the new procedures
don't go far enough in giving employees
equity with management.
The new grievance policy also
outlines situations when a grievance
hearing is possible and the machinery
by which a case can be presented
before an outside arbitrator.
Whenever an employee feels he has
been "improperly or unfairly treated
by the University" and whenever an
employee has been "dismissed,
suspended or otherwise disciplined by a
University officer"he may ask for a
grievance hearing.
In all cases, the employee must first
explain in writing how he believes he
has been adversely affected and after
his written explanation is reviewed by
University officials he may ask for an
outside arbitrator to enter the case and
settle it.
An employee may select any
University employee to represent him
at his hearing.
A revised set of guidelines for
Stanford employees who have
grievances against the University goes
into effect today.
The new grievance policy outlines a
plan whereby an outside hearing officer
will have the final say in grievance
cases. This outside arbitrator will be
selected from a list of five names
submitted by a panel of three
professors from universities other than
Stanford.
Vice President for Business and
Finance Robert R. Augsburger has
called the new policy "an effort to
achieve a fair and equitable means for
resolving employee complaints."
But the President of the United
Stanford Employees (USE), Jim Burke,
said last night his organization "was not
at all happy" with the new policy.
Burke pledged "to continue to create a
situation among the Stanford
employees that will force the
University management to make
changes in the grievance procedures
that truly reflect the needs of Stanford
employees."
Under Attack
Stanford's grievance procedure has
been under attack by the USE for more
than a year and was especially criticized
last April after five Stanford Medical
Center employees were fired following
a sit-in at the center.
All five of the fired employees
requested grievance hearings to discuss

their dismissals but felt that the
machinay for airing grievances was
heavily loaded in favor of the
administration since President Lyman
had the final say in all grievance cases.
USE President Burke said that while
his group is in favor of the new policy
of outside arbitration in grievance
hearings, the way in which the outside
arbitrator will now be chosen still
favors the university management over
the employees.
"Even though the new grievance
policy pretends to make management
and labor equals in grievance hearings,
the fact remains that the President of
the University selects the men who will
pick the arbitrators."
President Lyman has already named
the first three persons who will serve on
the.arbitration panel. They are: UCLA
Law Professor Benjamin Aaron, Wayne
State Law Professor William Gould, and
Jean McKelvey, a Professor at the New
