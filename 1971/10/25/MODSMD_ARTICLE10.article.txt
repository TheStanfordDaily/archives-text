## Franklin: Round One Ends 
### 
As the marathon dismissal hearing of
Professor Bruce Franklin goes into its 22nd
session, there are some matters which have
already become apparent.
Both sides have completed their cases on
the alleged disruption of a speech by Henry
Cabot Lodge at Dinkelspiel, January 11. We
feel that the University has not shown that
Franklin "significantly contributed to the
disruption which prevented Ambassador
Lodge from speaking," as is charged.
The administration has insisted that
Franklin went well beyond "heckling" at
the speech. But with two elderly women
apparently discredited as witnesses, only
two administration witnesses have testified
that Franklin vociferously yelled, chanted,
and dapped with the demonstrators. This is
opposed by testimony of over 14 witnesses
for Franklin, only some of them radicals,
who watched the celebrity Maoist. They saw
him yell no more than three comments,
none during Lodge's turn at the podium.
There appears to be substantial evidence
that Franklin consciously restrained himself
because he knew his moves on campus are
carefully watched.
In addition, the blame for the
cancellation is not easily placed solely on
the demonstrators. V\/e maintain the view we
presented the day after the Lodge
incident-Lodge should have been permitted
to speak. But the context of the event has
become dearer since then. The protestors'
outrage at Lodge becomes more
understandable with our increased
awareness of Lodge's crucial role in the
American government's murder of the
Vietnamese people, and tapes of the

disruption have shown that Hoover Institute
officials handled an admittedly difficult
situation without any tact or sensitivity.
The case is far from over. Franklin must
present his defense on the other three
charges. If the administration is to
legitimately "win" this case, the other three
charges must stand up to Franklin's
challenge much more effectively than the
Lodge charge.
We feel that the administration's
inflexible position on immunity for defense
witnesses involved in the events of February
10 places an unreasonable burden on the
defense. If in eight months the
administration could not find anyone to
prosecute, then it shouldn't use Franklin's
hearing as a method of probing for
further prosecutions.
The administration has a valid point in
not wishing to grant blanket immunity to all
persons who might have violated University
regulations. It would seem, though, that a
compromise agreement could have been
reached which would clearly define the
areas of culpability that most disturb
administrators and which would remove
doubts from the minds of potential
witnesses about what testimony would
incriminate themselves or others.
We feel that it is intimidating for workers
or students to be faced with possible loss of
their jobs or SJC prosecution for their
testimony, without strict guidelines as to
what behaviour would result in punitive
action at this time.
Without such guidelines, Professor
Franklin is faced with an unnecessarily
difficult job of weeding out all possibly
incriminating testimony from his defense.

carefully watched.
In addition, the blame for the
cancellation is not easily placed solely on
the demonstrators. V\/e maintain the view we
presented the day after the Lodge
incident-Lodge should have been permitted
to speak. But the context of the event has
become dearer since then. The protestors'
outrage at Lodge becomes more
understandable with our increased
awareness of Lodge's crucial role in the
American government's murder of the
Vietnamese people, and tapes of the

disruption have shown that Hoover Institute
officials handled an admittedly difficult
situation without any tact or sensitivity.
The case is far from over. Franklin must
present his defense on the other three
charges. If the administration is to
legitimately "win" this case, the other three
charges must stand up to Franklin's
challenge much more effectively than the
Lodge charge.
We feel that the administration's
inflexible position on immunity for defense
witnesses involved in the events of February
10 places an unreasonable burden on the
defense. If in eight months the
administration could not find anyone to
prosecute, then it shouldn't use Franklin's
hearing as a method of probing for
further prosecutions.
The administration has a valid point in
not wishing to grant blanket immunity to all
persons who might have violated University
regulations. It would seem, though, that a
compromise agreement could have been
reached which would clearly define the
areas of culpability that most disturb
administrators and which would remove
doubts from the minds of potential
witnesses about what testimony would
incriminate themselves or others.
We feel that it is intimidating for workers
or students to be faced with possible loss of
their jobs or SJC prosecution for their
testimony, without strict guidelines as to
what behaviour would result in punitive
action at this time.
Without such guidelines, Professor
Franklin is faced with an unnecessarily
difficult job of weeding out all possibly
incriminating testimony from his defense.
As the marathon dismissal hearing of
Professor Bruce Franklin goes into its 22nd
session, there are some matters which have
already become apparent.
Both sides have completed their cases on
the alleged disruption of a speech by Henry
Cabot Lodge at Dinkelspiel, January 11. We
feel that the University has not shown that
Franklin "significantly contributed to the
disruption which prevented Ambassador
Lodge from speaking," as is charged.
The administration has insisted that
Franklin went well beyond "heckling" at
the speech. But with two elderly women
apparently discredited as witnesses, only
two administration witnesses have testified
that Franklin vociferously yelled, chanted,
and dapped with the demonstrators. This is
opposed by testimony of over 14 witnesses
for Franklin, only some of them radicals,
who watched the celebrity Maoist. They saw
him yell no more than three comments,
none during Lodge's turn at the podium.
There appears to be substantial evidence
that Franklin consciously restrained himself
because he knew his moves on campus are
carefully watched.
