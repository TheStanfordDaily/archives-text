## Black Panthers Visit China 
### 
Miriam cherry

To see China is to know that
the Chinese people are for peace.
That reality lives in the hearts and
minds of Huey P. Newton, Elaine
Brown and Robert Bay. Their
recent visit to China enabled them
to experience many specifics of
socialist transformation and
establish strong, direct ties
between the Chinese people and
the Black Panther Party.
The central committee of the
Peoples Republic of China and
leaders of the Black Panther Party
met for several hours. During that
time the discussion focused on
victims of U.S. Imperialism.
Requests of the Attica prisoners,
the main purpose for going to
China, were presented in the form
of a petition to ask Chairman Mao
Tse-tung to negotiate with
Richard Nixon for the freedom of
the oppressed people of the
world. Premier Chou En-Lai
accepted the petition.
Other decisions engendered
encouragement. The central
committee, in listening to Huey
(the Servant of the People),
concluded that under his

leadership Panthers are
revolutionary scientists.
Dialectical materialsim guides
them to interpret present
conditions in the United States.
Nationwide celebrations took
place while Panther Party
members were there because it
was the 22nd anniversary of the
founding of the Peoples Republic
of China. Among the crowds
hailing the success of the socialist
revolution were representatives
from several revolutionary
communities. Panther leadership
learned from ambassadors of
North Korea, Laos, North
Vietnam and Mozambique that
leaders promote survival programs
in their countries. Revolutionary
peoples, even in the midst of
warfare, see the importance of
raising political consciousness
through systematized endeavors
which serve the people whether it
be mass production of food,
building roads or setting up field
hospitals.
Panther visitors toured the
places they wanted to see. Chinese
people, smiling and waving the red
book, greeted them with

"Welcome Black Panther Party,
vanguard of the Imperialist
Country!" The Chinese love
criticism. So they ask for
criticisms. As Huey pointed to a
smokestack at a factory and
warned them that the smoke
could lead to pollution problems,
the Chinese were seriously jotting
down the criticisms in their
notebooks.
There is no food problem in
China because the communes,
composed of 20,000 to 25 ,000
people, produce such massive
quantities, meals consist of 2 2
courses. Because of increased
production, prices are going down
in China.
Efficiency, based on discipline,
motivates the people to waste
nothing. Not even time. Trains
run exactly on schedule and
people are right on time for
appointments, meetings . . . what
ever.
If the people are so advanced
in China and conditions are of
such magnitude, why did the
Panthers return, especially since
Huey must go through his third
trial for the murder of Police
Officer Frey? In his press

conference, Huey stated: "When I
entered this country, I felt I was
entering prison. I'm willing to
struggle because we have
revolutionary optimism. I feel
that I'm returning to the front
lines, because the Chinese people
have liberated that territory.
That's already been done. All they
have to do is hold it. But now the
United States must be liberated
and I would be a soldier leaving
his post, if I were to stay away
from home."
A primary impression of the
visit—a really startling aspect—was
the freedom. The Chinese people
are gracious, warm and open.
Even though optimism pervades
their way of life, the people are
armed. They actually run the
country, for the government and
the people are one. The Peoples'
Republic of China, liberated from
the reactionary violence of
feudalism and Japanese
Imperialism, is now prepared to
defend itself against any further
agression. It taught the visitors
that there cannot be peace
without freedom.

met for several hours. During that
time the discussion focused on
victims of U.S. Imperialism.
Requests of the Attica prisoners,
the main purpose for going to
China, were presented in the form
of a petition to ask Chairman Mao
Tse-tung to negotiate with
Richard Nixon for the freedom of
the oppressed people of the
world. Premier Chou En-Lai
accepted the petition.
Other decisions engendered
encouragement. The central
committee, in listening to Huey
(the Servant of the People),
concluded that under his

leadership Panthers are
revolutionary scientists.
Dialectical materialsim guides
them to interpret present
conditions in the United States.
Nationwide celebrations took
place while Panther Party
members were there because it
was the 22nd anniversary of the
founding of the Peoples Republic
of China. Among the crowds
hailing the success of the socialist
revolution were representatives
from several revolutionary
communities. Panther leadership
learned from ambassadors of
North Korea, Laos, North
Vietnam and Mozambique that
leaders promote survival programs
in their countries. Revolutionary
peoples, even in the midst of
warfare, see the importance of
raising political consciousness
through systematized endeavors
which serve the people whether it
be mass production of food,
building roads or setting up field
hospitals.
Panther visitors toured the
places they wanted to see. Chinese
people, smiling and waving the red
book, greeted them with

"Welcome Black Panther Party,
vanguard of the Imperialist
Country!" The Chinese love
criticism. So they ask for
criticisms. As Huey pointed to a
smokestack at a factory and
warned them that the smoke
could lead to pollution problems,
the Chinese were seriously jotting
down the criticisms in their
notebooks.
There is no food problem in
China because the communes,
composed of 20,000 to 25 ,000
people, produce such massive
quantities, meals consist of 2 2
courses. Because of increased
production, prices are going down
in China.
Efficiency, based on discipline,
motivates the people to waste
nothing. Not even time. Trains
run exactly on schedule and
people are right on time for
appointments, meetings . . . what
ever.
If the people are so advanced
in China and conditions are of
such magnitude, why did the
Panthers return, especially since
Huey must go through his third
trial for the murder of Police
Officer Frey? In his press

conference, Huey stated: "When I
entered this country, I felt I was
entering prison. I'm willing to
struggle because we have
revolutionary optimism. I feel
that I'm returning to the front
lines, because the Chinese people
have liberated that territory.
That's already been done. All they
have to do is hold it. But now the
United States must be liberated
and I would be a soldier leaving
his post, if I were to stay away
from home."
A primary impression of the
visit—a really startling aspect—was
the freedom. The Chinese people
are gracious, warm and open.
Even though optimism pervades
their way of life, the people are
armed. They actually run the
country, for the government and
the people are one. The Peoples'
Republic of China, liberated from
the reactionary violence of
feudalism and Japanese
Imperialism, is now prepared to
defend itself against any further
agression. It taught the visitors
that there cannot be peace
without freedom.

To see China is to know that
the Chinese people are for peace.
That reality lives in the hearts and
minds of Huey P. Newton, Elaine
Brown and Robert Bay. Their
recent visit to China enabled them
to experience many specifics of
socialist transformation and
establish strong, direct ties
between the Chinese people and
the Black Panther Party.
