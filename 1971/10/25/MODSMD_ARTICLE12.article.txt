# to clarify a few issues
## Fee Assessment Explanation

child care center

After attacks from the
Stanford Student Voluntarists and
from anonymous leaflets, the
members of the Children's Center
of the Stanford Community feel
the need to clarify a few issues.
(1) We have been labelled
parasites, which according to
Webster's New World Dictionary
are those who derive sustenance
or advantage from others and give
nothing in return. Sustenance, in
the form of a one time, one dollar
fee assessment, we would

appreciate; but we do not feel
that we are giving nothing in
return. The return on student
dollars is a more adequately
equipped, better staffed day care
center, serving not only those
members of the Stanford
community who can afford to pay
for child care, but also those
members of the Stanford
community who cannot afford
our services.
Currently we are able to
operate on a day-to-day basis with
our own funds. We are not asking
students to permanently subsidize
the operation of the Center, but
merely to vote us the funds to
make some urgently needed
improvements, and to expand our
programs to provide additional
services like an after school
program for children of working
and student mothers.
(2 ) Some students who believe
that the Stanford community
should have a day care center, but
who do not wish to contribute
$1.00 in support of the Center,
say that the University should

provide the funds. The University
is presently contributing aid in the
form of a rent free building and
work-study students, but it has
not given us the capital we require
to make the improvements.
(3) It has been said that
children are the concern only of
their parents, and that the
Stanford student body should not
be asked to pay for other
students' babysitting services.
In twenty years these kids will
be a vocal group in the country,
and how they were brought up
will be affecting everyone.
Furthermore, the Children's
Center is more than a babysitting
service. For the last two years
SWOPSI students have used the
Center as a workshop, a situation
that could also involve other
University departments.
(4) Our opponents have
attacked our request for a $1.00
assessment on the grounds that we
are a small interest group, whose
services are needed only by a
fraction of the Stanford
community. Considering only

those students with children who
live on campus, there are 650
families in Escondido Village
alone. It is impossible to estimate
how many faculty, staff, and
off-campus students have
children, but it is safe to say that
their number comprises more than
a small interest group.
(5) Our opponents' assertion
that we have attempted to conceal
our request for a fee assessment is
untrue. We had a table at
registration, collected over seven
hundred signatures from students
to place our referendum on the
ballot, and have conscientiously
tried to publicize our cause.
(6) We invite all those who are
interested in the Children's
Center, especially those who
believe that our purpose is narrow
and our value to the community
questionable, to stop in and see us
at 590 May field Avenue.

Bryant, Elizabeth Probert, and
Judy Sanchez are on the Board of
Directors of the Stanford Child
Care Center.)

Furthermore, the Children's
Center is more than a babysitting
service. For the last two years
SWOPSI students have used the
Center as a workshop, a situation
that could also involve other
University departments.
(4) Our opponents have
attacked our request for a $1.00
assessment on the grounds that we
are a small interest group, whose
services are needed only by a
fraction of the Stanford
community. Considering only

those students with children who
live on campus, there are 650
families in Escondido Village
alone. It is impossible to estimate
how many faculty, staff, and
off-campus students have
children, but it is safe to say that
their number comprises more than
a small interest group.
(5) Our opponents' assertion
that we have attempted to conceal
our request for a fee assessment is
untrue. We had a table at
registration, collected over seven
hundred signatures from students
to place our referendum on the
ballot, and have conscientiously
tried to publicize our cause.
(6) We invite all those who are
interested in the Children's
Center, especially those who
believe that our purpose is narrow
and our value to the community
questionable, to stop in and see us
at 590 May field Avenue.

child care center

After attacks from the
Stanford Student Voluntarists and
from anonymous leaflets, the
members of the Children's Center
of the Stanford Community feel
the need to clarify a few issues.
(1) We have been labelled
parasites, which according to
Webster's New World Dictionary
are those who derive sustenance
or advantage from others and give
nothing in return. Sustenance, in
the form of a one time, one dollar
fee assessment, we would

appreciate; but we do not feel
that we are giving nothing in
return. The return on student
dollars is a more adequately
equipped, better staffed day care
center, serving not only those
members of the Stanford
community who can afford to pay
for child care, but also those
members of the Stanford
community who cannot afford
our services.
Currently we are able to
operate on a day-to-day basis with
our own funds. We are not asking
students to permanently subsidize
the operation of the Center, but
merely to vote us the funds to
make some urgently needed
improvements, and to expand our
programs to provide additional
services like an after school
program for children of working
and student mothers.
(2 ) Some students who believe
that the Stanford community
should have a day care center, but
who do not wish to contribute
$1.00 in support of the Center,
say that the University should

provide the funds. The University
is presently contributing aid in the
form of a rent free building and
work-study students, but it has
not given us the capital we require
to make the improvements.
(3) It has been said that
children are the concern only of
their parents, and that the
Stanford student body should not
be asked to pay for other
students' babysitting services.
In twenty years these kids will
be a vocal group in the country,
and how they were brought up
will be affecting everyone.
