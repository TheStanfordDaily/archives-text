# red hot prof
## A Return To Tradition
###

In the spring a young man's
fancy, (and probably a young
woman's,too) turns to love. In the
fall, it turns to football. Or so it is
said. Anyway, to look around
Stanford, with all the old football
traditions once again in swing, it
certainly seems to be the case.
Somewhere along the line,
though, probably within the last
two or three years, one of the
really fine football traditions got
lost. Every year, in the old days,
Stanford would elect a "Red Hot
Professor," whose honor it would
be to lead a yell at one of the
games.

Such an all-time great as Ernie
Arbuckle, (now chairman of the
Board of Wells Fargo Bank, also
chairman of the Board of SRI,
and a Stanford Trustee, but at
that time Dean of the Business
School) has been vaulted to fame
by this singular distinction.
Probably, though, the best
thing about the Red Hot Prof's
election was the way in which the
voting went on. You bought your
votes, a penny apiece, and the
money went to things like a
scholarship fund of the World
University Students or the
Stanford Convalescent Home. So

in the end. no matter who won,
everybody won.
But times have gotten serious,
and satire has given way to the
recognition that there are real
hostilities among members of the
University community, which
a little beer won't wash away.
People over thirty don't trust
those under thirty but point out
that the "under thirties" said it
first. A war which nobody wants
grinds on, and the University
community is ripped to shreds by
conflicting ideologies as to how to
stop it. Good humor seems to
have become a luxury of the past.
But man does not live by bread
alone, nor does he stop laughing,
even in a concentration camp. So
the Association of Young Crows
(which even in its name is a satire
on Professor Rambo's very real
electronic warfare experts' club,
the Association of Old Crows) has
decided to revive the Red Hot
Professor Contest, but with a new
twist.
Starting next week, members
of the University community will
be given the opportunity to vote
on which of the holders of the
twenty top research contracts
sponsored by the Department of
Defense shall be honored as this
year's Red Hot Professor.
Summaries of the work conducted
under the contract will be
distributed, and the community
urged to vote not for personalities
but for which contract takes the
prize.
The rules of the contest will be
as they used to be. Votes will still
cost a penny. The more votes you
cast, the merrier. Proceeds this
year will go for medical supplies
for North Viet Nam or for the
Viet Cong. To add a little variety,
negative votes will be allowed, but
will cost 5 cents each. During the
election, a black board will be set
up near Engineering Corner with
up-to-date election tallies.
Unfortunately, the political
lines being drawn on campus as
they are now, the Young Cfows
will not be able to promise that
the Red Hot Professor will lead a
yell at a football game this year.
The top five winners will,
however, be treated to an
all-expense paid trip to the White
Plaza finals, where they may
discuss their work so that their
constituents can choose who gets
the top honor.
After all, think about it.
Knding the war could be fun!
