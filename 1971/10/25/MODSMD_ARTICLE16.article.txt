# Gordon Lightfoot
## Songs From The Gut 
### PETER ALESHIRE 
If you've never really listened
to your Gordon Lightfoot
records, shame on you! Of course,
if you've barely heard of Gordon
Lightfoot, you have some
explanation coming. Simply put,
he's very good—but he's even
better than you'll first think,
kinda like Cat Stevens.
Although he has released quite
a few low-key albums, Lightfoot
is a fairly recent arrival on the
American music scene. Along with
Stevens, Long John Baldry and
Randy Newman, he first achieved
attention on the tail end of the
James Taylor, Neil Young/Steve
Stills hype.
He's Canada's current
contribution to the returning
popularity of folk music. Since
the late '60's he has been
immensely popular in Eastern
Canada—drawing sell-out
audiences everywhere—but even
today he's just gaining notice in
the United States on the strength
of his first major tour.
Probably his most familiar
release is his recent hit single off
the album of the same name, "If
You Could Read My Mind." His
finest album is probably "Sunday

Concert," recorded live in Canada.
The most successful
folksingers, from the days of
Woody Guthrie, have clambered
onto innumerable stages and
proceeded to absolutely enrapture
their audiences by the strength of
their conviction, voice, or simple
artistry.
Master of Rhythms
Lightfoot, who isn't a terribly
accomplished guitarist (a lead
guitarist and a bassist always
accompany him), nor even a very
outstanding lyricist, is a master of
rhythms and tempo changes; it is
his powerfully warm voice which
pulls his listeners into the mood
and spirit of each song by
maintaining or altering a rhythm
sequence.
Whether at a live performance
or at an album listening session,
most devotees have the distinct
impression that his voice comes
from somewhere deep down
inside, not merely from his
mouth. Lightfoot, as befitting a
Canadian, sings from the gut.
Lightfoot live is even a lot
better than his best albums,
basically because one can feel the
tremendous power and emotion
that so captivated the Canadian

audiences when he was an
American 'unknown.' I refer to
his October 16 concert at the San
Jose Civic Auditorium.
As in all his performances, the
stage is bare, almost disturbingly
stark. Out came the bassist and
the lead guitarist, and then
Gordon. For several minutes the
audience was profoundly
confused. Who was this stranger in
beard and mustache?
And so the applause was rather
hesitant—until that swelling,
mellow voice burst out in song
and filled the auditorium. Then it
was for real!
Can He Do It Live?
Remember back to the Moody
Blues' concert in Maples Pavilion
last winter; what was your first
reaction? Something like: "How
can those guys perform that stuff
LIVE?"
One had much the same
reaction at the Lightfoot
performance. It was one thing to
feel the power emanating from
the synthetic whorls of the vinyl
record, but to hear it even more
so—live—was a humbling
experience. Almost the same rush
as after hearing Joan Baez on
"Any Day Now," and then
hearing the same thing live.
The staging was nearly surreal.
The stage's length and breadth
was in indecipherable blackness,
with a somehow lesser blackness
that surrounded the three
musicians. Lightfoot's face was
spotlighted.
Sometimes it would narrow to
his head and shoulders and you
were aware of nothing so much as
this man pouring his soul into his
music. At the time it was more
real than the act of breathing,
more real than the wooden slats
of my chair.
Before he left "to do some
heavy drinking," he performed
what has to be his finest song, the
"Canadian Railroad Trilogy."
Many will remember it from his
"Sunday Concert" album. It's the
song that captures the endless
pounding of metal wheels on
metal track, wooden ties and
gravel, mingled with human spirit
and sweat, set amid the awesome
strength of the mountains, rivers,
and pines of his native land.
It is his tribute to the grandeur
of Canada, and his masterpiece.
The slow chuffing and puffing of
the allegorical train and its
transformation into pounding,
driving speed were transformed
into the rhythms of the song.
What joy it was to realize that
one's heart was pounding along to
the rhythms of Lightfoot!
