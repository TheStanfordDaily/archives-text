# A 						Weak Rock Ritual
## 
### JOSEPH FIKSEL 
You, too, can create your very
own rock musical. Just choose an
appealing classical drama, distill
the plot down to a few
fundamental scenes, write a
swinging score suitable for some
free-form rhythmic movement,
and throw in a few songs for
dialogue.
At least this seems to be the
philosophy of William Ilusso, who
wrote, produced, and directed the
San Francisco Free Theatre's
production of "The Bacchae,"
performed last weekend at
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Now I certainly don't wish to
malign the Free Theatre, who are
an amateur company working
together without pay, and who
did a creditable job in realizing
Russo's rather lame conception.
Unfortunately, they could not
successfully express a theme
which remains far beyond the
scope of their "rock ritual," as
Russo calls it.
"The Bacchae" is adapted from
the original play of the same

name, by Euripides, and tells of
the god Dionysus, who comes to
Thebes as a stranger, and casts a
spell of madness over the women
of the city, enticing them away
from their homes into the hills,
where they revel in erotic (you
guessed it) bacchanalian rites.
Mortal Folly
The queen's son, Pentheus, at
first defies and seeks to destroy
the stranger. However, he is
finally convinced to venture up
into the hills for a clandestine
peek. Ah, mortal folly! The
women, including his mother,
mistake him for a lion, and tear
him to pieces in a lunatic frenzy.
With merciless thoroughness,
Dionysus completes the tragedy
by turning everyone into serpents.
This is a long, involved story,
replete with symbolism and moral
didacticism. It was a mistake to
try to wrap it all into a brief,
hour-long musical synopsis.
Russo's adaptation would have
been much more effective if it had
concentrated on only a few vital
scenes of a simplified story line,
rather than including so many
hasty episodes.
Still, "The Bacchae" was
entertaining, and even compelling
in spots. Though sometimes
diffuse and labored, the
interpretive dance movements
which formed a visual base for the
action gave a sense of energy and
continuity to the play, with the
entire company (about fifteen)
invariably participating.
These dance sequences were
accompanied by an excellent,
sustained rock background,
performed by a band right on the
stage. Illuminated only by
psychedelic slides and an
occasional spot, the actors worked
without props, and in the
climactic scene—Pentheus'
death—without clothes.

In fact, that scene, expressing
the intense sexuality of Dionysus'
enraptured victims, was handled
with taste and power; the nudity*
of the players weaving
together upon the ground gave it
extraordinary impact.
The only character that
brought any depth to his role was
Ed Blair, cast in the lead as
Dionysus. He projected an aura of
eerie force and overwhelming
eroticism, writhing and leering
about his powerless worshippers.
Both in dramatic importance
and in personal strength. Blair as
Dionysus dominated the
production. Especially memorable
was his irresistible seduction of
the fuming Pentheus, played by
Charles Mills. Both men are black,
incidentally. Dionysus coaxes
Pentheus out of his clothing, and
then with an exultant leap, cries,
"You are mine!" affirming his
ultimate triumph.
Flat Monologues
Although the dance content
was enjoyable, the vocal numbers
were largely disappointing. Russo
couldn't think up any imaginative
lyrics, and his songs are flat
monologues that detract from the
rhythmic pace of the musical.
With typical blandness, he
forces Merilee Fenger as the
anguished Queen Agave, to lament
at the height of her sorrow:
"What have I done
I've killed my son."
Thus, the play falls short of its
goals. The integration of music,
dance and drama is an exciting
and ambitious venture, and Russo
shows much talent as a director
and choreographer. But he must
not use Euripides' work simply as
a convenient vehicle for
experimentation.
The whole is greater than its
parts—the underlying theme of a
musical cannot be subservient to
the elements which comprise it.

accompanied by an excellent,
sustained rock background,
performed by a band right on the
stage. Illuminated only by
psychedelic slides and an
occasional spot, the actors worked
without props, and in the
climactic scene—Pentheus'
death—without clothes.

In fact, that scene, expressing
the intense sexuality of Dionysus'
enraptured victims, was handled
with taste and power; the nudity*
of the players weaving
together upon the ground gave it
extraordinary impact.
The only character that
brought any depth to his role was
Ed Blair, cast in the lead as
Dionysus. He projected an aura of
eerie force and overwhelming
eroticism, writhing and leering
about his powerless worshippers.
Both in dramatic importance
and in personal strength. Blair as
Dionysus dominated the
production. Especially memorable
was his irresistible seduction of
the fuming Pentheus, played by
Charles Mills. Both men are black,
incidentally. Dionysus coaxes
Pentheus out of his clothing, and
then with an exultant leap, cries,
"You are mine!" affirming his
ultimate triumph.
Flat Monologues
Although the dance content
was enjoyable, the vocal numbers
were largely disappointing. Russo
couldn't think up any imaginative
lyrics, and his songs are flat
monologues that detract from the
rhythmic pace of the musical.
With typical blandness, he
forces Merilee Fenger as the
anguished Queen Agave, to lament
at the height of her sorrow:
"What have I done
I've killed my son."
Thus, the play falls short of its
goals. The integration of music,
dance and drama is an exciting
and ambitious venture, and Russo
shows much talent as a director
and choreographer. But he must
not use Euripides' work simply as
a convenient vehicle for
experimentation.
The whole is greater than its
parts—the underlying theme of a
musical cannot be subservient to
the elements which comprise it.
You, too, can create your very
own rock musical. Just choose an
appealing classical drama, distill
the plot down to a few
fundamental scenes, write a
swinging score suitable for some
free-form rhythmic movement,
and throw in a few songs for
dialogue.
At least this seems to be the
philosophy of William Ilusso, who
wrote, produced, and directed the
San Francisco Free Theatre's
production of "The Bacchae,"
performed last weekend at
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Now I certainly don't wish to
malign the Free Theatre, who are
an amateur company working
together without pay, and who
did a creditable job in realizing
Russo's rather lame conception.
Unfortunately, they could not
successfully express a theme
which remains far beyond the
scope of their "rock ritual," as
Russo calls it.
"The Bacchae" is adapted from
the original play of the same

name, by Euripides, and tells of
the god Dionysus, who comes to
Thebes as a stranger, and casts a
spell of madness over the women
of the city, enticing them away
from their homes into the hills,
where they revel in erotic (you
guessed it) bacchanalian rites.
Mortal Folly
The queen's son, Pentheus, at
first defies and seeks to destroy
the stranger. However, he is
finally convinced to venture up
into the hills for a clandestine
peek. Ah, mortal folly! The
women, including his mother,
mistake him for a lion, and tear
him to pieces in a lunatic frenzy.
With merciless thoroughness,
Dionysus completes the tragedy
by turning everyone into serpents.
This is a long, involved story,
replete with symbolism and moral
didacticism. It was a mistake to
try to wrap it all into a brief,
hour-long musical synopsis.
Russo's adaptation would have
been much more effective if it had
concentrated on only a few vital
scenes of a simplified story line,
rather than including so many
hasty episodes.
Still, "The Bacchae" was
entertaining, and even compelling
in spots. Though sometimes
diffuse and labored, the
interpretive dance movements
which formed a visual base for the
action gave a sense of energy and
continuity to the play, with the
entire company (about fifteen)
invariably participating.
