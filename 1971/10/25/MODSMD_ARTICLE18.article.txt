# Russian's Poetry Transcends Politics
## 
### MARC KAYE 
An awkward and visibly
nervous man, but what a man,
made his art transcend his own
apparent lack of presence Friday
night at Project Artaud's People's
Hall in San Francisco.
More importantly, the fiery
Russian poet, Andrei
Voznesensky, with his abundant
life-sustaining passion, showed
that the limitations presented by
the ideology and practice of a
social system, be it Soviet or
corporate-capitalist, can be
overcome in the artist's persistent
pursuit of the inalienable decency
of existence and the dignity of
man.
The interaction between poet
and audience was remarkable, in
spite of the fact that the poet
recited his work in Russian. The
local, renowned poet, Lawrence
Ferlinghetti, certainly rendered
credible and laudable translations
of his friend's work.
This accomplished, the
audience was treated to the
tremendous power of the poet.
Voznesensky succeeded in making
the art of recitation a form of
spiritual communion.
It was as if he wrote the
poems for himself. As if the
audience's response, in terms of
applause were unnecessary and
unrevealing accoutrements. As if
this kind of recognition was
indeed dealing him blow after
blow.
Voznesensky sought a more
authentic response from his
audience. As he proceeded, the
musical sense and power of his
creation broke the preliminary
bodily and psychic bonds
embodied in one of his questions:
"Why do our cheeks refuse to
blush?" The poet's creation and
its spiritual power fed the poet's

voice and body. His resulting
power intensified the poem.
If the political and cultural
differences of two nations prevent
a human communion, the
passionate spiritual earthiness,
informed by an ethic of decency,
of this poetry, allows no
limitations of linguistic
differences.
The poems chosen represented
Voznesensky in many of his
creative periods, treating a variety
of themes. "I Am Goya"
concentrates on war, death,
violence and injustice. The poet's
vision of the world is full of
horror: he is haunted. In
"Someone Is Beating A Woman,"
Voznesensky's sensitivity to the
plight of other people explodes.
"Someone is beating a
woman/Century to Century, no
end to this/ It's the young that are
beaten. Somberly/ Our wedding
bells start up the alarum/
Someone is beating a woman."
Such brilliant virtuousity
—displaying a great range of
rhythm, assonance, modulation of
pitch and intensity.
Voznesensky, a frequent visitor
to America, searches for the
essence of America. It was
amazing to hear the rhythms of
our society interpreted in Russian.
It's very appealing to hear a
representation of the American
scene, of both its technological
wonders and its equally wondrous
social barbarism, through the
perspective of a man raised in the
materialist and socialist tradition.
Quite insightful.
His poem "Striptease." " 'Are
you America?' I'll ask like an
idiot;/she'll sit down, tap her
cigarette./ 'Are you kidding,
kiddo?' she'll answer me./ 'Better
make mine a double martini.' " So
subtle. So ironic.
Voznesensky recited many
other favorite poems, equally
intense, equally relevant to our
particular, to his particular, to our
universal condition.

informed by an ethic of decency,
of this poetry, allows no
limitations of linguistic
differences.
The poems chosen represented
Voznesensky in many of his
creative periods, treating a variety
of themes. "I Am Goya"
concentrates on war, death,
violence and injustice. The poet's
vision of the world is full of
horror: he is haunted. In
"Someone Is Beating A Woman,"
Voznesensky's sensitivity to the
plight of other people explodes.
"Someone is beating a
woman/Century to Century, no
end to this/ It's the young that are
beaten. Somberly/ Our wedding
bells start up the alarum/
Someone is beating a woman."
Such brilliant virtuousity
—displaying a great range of
rhythm, assonance, modulation of
pitch and intensity.
Voznesensky, a frequent visitor
to America, searches for the
essence of America. It was
amazing to hear the rhythms of
our society interpreted in Russian.
It's very appealing to hear a
representation of the American
scene, of both its technological
wonders and its equally wondrous
social barbarism, through the
perspective of a man raised in the
materialist and socialist tradition.
Quite insightful.
His poem "Striptease." " 'Are
you America?' I'll ask like an
idiot;/she'll sit down, tap her
cigarette./ 'Are you kidding,
kiddo?' she'll answer me./ 'Better
make mine a double martini.' " So
subtle. So ironic.
Voznesensky recited many
other favorite poems, equally
intense, equally relevant to our
particular, to his particular, to our
universal condition.
An awkward and visibly
nervous man, but what a man,
made his art transcend his own
apparent lack of presence Friday
night at Project Artaud's People's
Hall in San Francisco.
More importantly, the fiery
Russian poet, Andrei
Voznesensky, with his abundant
life-sustaining passion, showed
that the limitations presented by
the ideology and practice of a
social system, be it Soviet or
corporate-capitalist, can be
overcome in the artist's persistent
pursuit of the inalienable decency
of existence and the dignity of
man.
The interaction between poet
and audience was remarkable, in
spite of the fact that the poet
recited his work in Russian. The
local, renowned poet, Lawrence
Ferlinghetti, certainly rendered
credible and laudable translations
of his friend's work.
This accomplished, the
audience was treated to the
tremendous power of the poet.
Voznesensky succeeded in making
the art of recitation a form of
spiritual communion.
It was as if he wrote the
poems for himself. As if the
audience's response, in terms of
applause were unnecessary and
unrevealing accoutrements. As if
this kind of recognition was
indeed dealing him blow after
blow.
Voznesensky sought a more
authentic response from his
audience. As he proceeded, the
musical sense and power of his
creation broke the preliminary
bodily and psychic bonds
embodied in one of his questions:
"Why do our cheeks refuse to
blush?" The poet's creation and
its spiritual power fed the poet's

voice and body. His resulting
power intensified the poem.
If the political and cultural
differences of two nations prevent
a human communion, the
passionate spiritual earthiness,
informed by an ethic of decency,
of this poetry, allows no
limitations of linguistic
differences.
