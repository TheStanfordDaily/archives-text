# San Jose Edges Polo Team
## 
### DOUG WILSON 
The Indian Water polo team
did not have a much better
weekend than the football squad.
Although the poloists managed
a fairly easy win over UC-Davis,
12-5, on Saturday, Coach Jim
Gaughran's varsity squad, and a
crowd of over 400 fans, saw the
time run out in the last quarter to
give San Jose State's Spartans
their second consecutive win over
Stanford, this one by an 8-7 score.
Cold Problems
Gaughran's poloists, hampered
somewhat by "cold hangovers",
were outswum and out pressed by

a determined San Jose squad led
by Mike Albright, who scored two
of the 8 goals for the Spartans,
and Scott Jackson, whose
last-quarter penalty goal put San
Jose beyond Indian reach.
"Stanford is a very difficult
team to play, and we're just glad
to come out of it alive,"
commented Lee Walton, the
Spartan mentor. "Stanford missed
several scoring opportunities,
obviously enough to win, and we
missed more than enough to win
bigger. But they played a hell of a
game, no doubt about it; their
defense is especially tough, and
deserves a lot of credit."

Gaughran had a somewhat
different opinion. "We just didn't
play a good game," he said;
"Several players did have bad
colds, but generally we just didn't
do a good job. Although this
doesn't really do anything to us
nationally, we have to wait for the
next Cal, USC and UCLA games."
Massimino Stars
Despite Stanford difficulties
capitalizing on scoring
opportunities, it was generally a
good day for varsity captain Rick
Massimino, who scored five of the
Indians' seven goals (four on
penalty shots), and goalie Pete
Gadd, whose defensive game was
praised by Spartan coach Walton,
and whose blocks of several key
San Jose shots made the game a
seesaw tiit until the final seconds
of the last quarter, when the
stopwatch proved to be faster
than Randy Wilkins' upraised arm.
The other Stanford goals were
provided by Bill Simpkins and
Ken Hammer.
This Thursday, the Indians
meet UC-Santa Barbara at Encina
pool, and then host the USC
Trojans on Friday afternoon.
Both games will be played at 3 :00
p.m.

uncontested. Roger Cowan, Greg Sampson, and Tom Sones surround Paine, who timed his pitch to the
fleet Jackson perfectly. The Cougars' execution of the triple option shown here was the key in their win
over heavily favored Stanford. The Indians will try again next week when they travel to Oregon State. The
game will be shown on closed circuit at Maples Saturday at 1:30 p.m.

Jose beyond Indian reach.
"Stanford is a very difficult
team to play, and we're just glad
to come out of it alive,"
commented Lee Walton, the
Spartan mentor. "Stanford missed
several scoring opportunities,
obviously enough to win, and we
missed more than enough to win
bigger. But they played a hell of a
game, no doubt about it; their
defense is especially tough, and
deserves a lot of credit."

Gaughran had a somewhat
different opinion. "We just didn't
play a good game," he said;
"Several players did have bad
colds, but generally we just didn't
do a good job. Although this
doesn't really do anything to us
nationally, we have to wait for the
next Cal, USC and UCLA games."
Massimino Stars
Despite Stanford difficulties
capitalizing on scoring
opportunities, it was generally a
good day for varsity captain Rick
Massimino, who scored five of the
Indians' seven goals (four on
penalty shots), and goalie Pete
Gadd, whose defensive game was
praised by Spartan coach Walton,
and whose blocks of several key
San Jose shots made the game a
seesaw tiit until the final seconds
of the last quarter, when the
stopwatch proved to be faster
than Randy Wilkins' upraised arm.
The other Stanford goals were
provided by Bill Simpkins and
Ken Hammer.
This Thursday, the Indians
meet UC-Santa Barbara at Encina
pool, and then host the USC
Trojans on Friday afternoon.
Both games will be played at 3 :00
p.m.

OUT-QUICKED— WSU's Bernard Jackson takes a pitch-out from Ty Paine and heads upfield momentarily
uncontested. Roger Cowan, Greg Sampson, and Tom Sones surround Paine, who timed his pitch to the
fleet Jackson perfectly. The Cougars' execution of the triple option shown here was the key in their win
over heavily favored Stanford. The Indians will try again next week when they travel to Oregon State. The
game will be shown on closed circuit at Maples Saturday at 1:30 p.m.
The Indian Water polo team
did not have a much better
weekend than the football squad.
Although the poloists managed
a fairly easy win over UC-Davis,
12-5, on Saturday, Coach Jim
Gaughran's varsity squad, and a
crowd of over 400 fans, saw the
time run out in the last quarter to
give San Jose State's Spartans
their second consecutive win over
Stanford, this one by an 8-7 score.
Cold Problems
Gaughran's poloists, hampered
somewhat by "cold hangovers",
were outswum and out pressed by

a determined San Jose squad led
by Mike Albright, who scored two
of the 8 goals for the Spartans,
and Scott Jackson, whose
last-quarter penalty goal put San
Jose beyond Indian reach.
