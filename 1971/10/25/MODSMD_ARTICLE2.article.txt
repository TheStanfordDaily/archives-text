# University Tightens Control Of Tresidder
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
In a not totally unexpected move,
the University administration has
announced it is taking more direct
control of the operation of Tresidder
Union.
The President's office last week
announced it was implementing a
proposal to make Union Director
Forrest Tregea directly answerable to
the Office of Student Services.
Previously, Tregea had been under
the control of a student-faculty
committee which was in turn
answerable to the President's office for
its administrative actions.
However, the Hitchner Report on
Tresidder operations, compiled this
summer, recommended that the
committee relinquish its administrative
powers and become an advisory board
to Tregea.
The move has been long
recommended by such Tregea critics as
ASSU Sen. Scott Burke, author of a
harsh Senate report last year that
accused Tregea of inept management of
the financially-troubled operation.
Carl Hitchner, second-year law
student at Notre Dame who prepared
the University Internal Audit report,
stated in the report that the

administrative committee had provided
"little direction" for the
often-embattled Director.
'Received Little"
"At a time when the Director
required definite guidelines in
operations of the Union, he actually
received very little," the report stated.
The placing of Tregea under the
Director of Student Services (the
position expected to replace Dean of
Students) represents a victory of sorts
over some who suggested that the Vice
President for Business and Finance be
put in charge.
In his report, Hitchner listed the
advantages of placing Tregea under
either of the two, or the Vice President
and Provost.
However, some observers close to
Tresidder expressed the fear that many
of the Union's less money-making
community programs and services
would be dropped if the Union was
placed under Business and Finance's
direct control.
From all indications, the Committee
on Tresidder Union will continue to
meet as an advisory board under its
newly-named student chairman, Chuck
Peterson, who replaced Professor
Mason Yearian.
