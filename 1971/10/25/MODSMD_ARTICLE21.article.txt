# Stanford Stumbles Again
## 
### CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
John Ralston described it very
well. "If we had won the game,
we would have stolen it. If you
can't move the ball and eat up the
clock or hold them deep in their
own territory, you don't deserve
to win."
Although the Indians were
massive 24 point favorites going
into Saturday's clash with the
Cougars, they were soundly
beaten in almost every phase of
the game by a better team.
Penalties and fumbles stopped
numerous Cougar drives and kept
Stanford within reach, but a field
goal by Jim Sweet with no time
left gave WSU its first conference
victory, 24-23.
The Cougars piled up 133
yards in the last five minutes
during two drives, the last of
which produced the winning field
goal. Led by the brilliant running
of Bernard Jackson, WSU seemed
to move downfield at will in the
last minutes of the game through
a Stanford defense that could not
make the big play all afternoon.
Cougars Dominate
The Cougars moved the ball for
459 yards against the Thunder
Chickens with an average of six
yards gained every time the ball
was snapped. The Indian offense
drove for 349 yards but the WSU
defense held when it had to with
two minutes left in the game to
gain possession. Stanford took the
opening kickoff in the second half
and marched 67 yards in nine
plays to score on a two yard
plunge by Hillary Shockley, but
other than that, the Indians could
not put together another
touchdown drive. Three times
Don Bunce and the offensive crew
could only get close enough for
Rod Garcia to kick a field goal.
Jackson left many potential
Indian tacklers with empty arms

on his way to a 145 yard rushing
day. The Thunder Chickens have
been able to contain every
outstanding individual they have
faced this season, but the 170
pound Jackson ran for two
touchdowns and picked up first
down yardage almost every time
quarterback Ty Paine called on
him.
Paine ran the triple option
superbly and gained 78 yards on
the ground himself for rn average
of over five yards per carry. Paine
was also able to pass when he had
to, hitting Jim Forrest for 13
yards on third down with 40
seconds left in the game to keep
the Cougar drive alive. WSU ranks
last in the Pac-8 in passing
offense, but Paine almost matched
second ranked Bunce's statistics,
completing 9 of 21 for 161 yards
while Bunce hit on 13 of 25 for
170 yards.
Paine also exhibited great
poise, often checking off at the
line of scrimmage when the
Stanford defense appeared to be
set up to stop the play he had
called in the huddle. His pass to
Ike Nelson with ten seconds left
to give WSU a first and goal on
the Indian ten yard line was an
audible called at the line.
The key to the Cougars'
offensive success was Paine's
amazing execution of the option
play. His quick and sharp cuts
into the line and perfect timing of
the pitch-out to Jackosn kept the
Thunder Chickens off balance.
Great Blocking
Ralston commented that WSU
blocked his club better than
anyone had before. Everyone
knew that Jackson and Paine were
tremendous athletes, but the
performance of the Cougar
offensive line was unexpected.

The line was led by guard Steve
Busch who blocked Sports
Illustrated's lineman of the week
Pete Lazetich out of most of the
action.
The WSU defensive unit also
played better than expected,
coming up with the big play when
needed to stop Indian drives.
Strong safety Chuck Hawthorne
sparked a Cougar secondary that
WSU coach Jim Sweeney calls,
"the best in the league." The
Cougar secondary contained
Stanford's explosive passing
attack better than any team this
season.
Offensively, the Indians were
once again unable to punch the
ball the last 20 yards for
touchdowns.
Stanford was hurt by the
absense of Jeff Siemon in the
second half. Siemon sprained an
ankle and took himself out of the
game. The Indians' other major
injury was to Tim Robnett who
may have suffered broken ribs.
Rose Bowl Race
The Indians' loss throws the
Rose Bowl race into total
confusion.
Ironically, the only undefeated
team is Cal who has been declared
out of the race by the Pac-8
because they are playing
suspended star Isaac Curtis. Every
other team in the league has lost
at least one game, and no one is
out of Rose Bowl contention
now.
Stanford must win its game
with Oregon State next week in
order to have a chance for a
return trip to Pasadena. If the
Indians win their last two
conference games with the

Beavers and the Bruins, and WSU
loses one more game, then a Rose
Bowl trip is clinched. The Cougars
are the only team that can deny
the Indians even if they go
undefeated for the rest of the
year.
Oregon, with one loss in the
Pac-8, would be the co-favorite
with OSU if Stanford loses next
week. The Ducks will play WSU
next week, and out of that game
and the Stanford-OSU battle will
probably emerge a favorite in the
confused Rose Bowl race.

to win."
Although the Indians were
massive 24 point favorites going
into Saturday's clash with the
Cougars, they were soundly
beaten in almost every phase of
the game by a better team.
Penalties and fumbles stopped
numerous Cougar drives and kept
Stanford within reach, but a field
goal by Jim Sweet with no time
left gave WSU its first conference
victory, 24-23.
The Cougars piled up 133
yards in the last five minutes
during two drives, the last of
which produced the winning field
goal. Led by the brilliant running
of Bernard Jackson, WSU seemed
to move downfield at will in the
last minutes of the game through
a Stanford defense that could not
make the big play all afternoon.
Cougars Dominate
The Cougars moved the ball for
459 yards against the Thunder
Chickens with an average of six
yards gained every time the ball
was snapped. The Indian offense
drove for 349 yards but the WSU
defense held when it had to with
two minutes left in the game to
gain possession. Stanford took the
opening kickoff in the second half
and marched 67 yards in nine
plays to score on a two yard
plunge by Hillary Shockley, but
other than that, the Indians could
not put together another
touchdown drive. Three times
Don Bunce and the offensive crew
could only get close enough for
Rod Garcia to kick a field goal.
Jackson left many potential
Indian tacklers with empty arms

on his way to a 145 yard rushing
day. The Thunder Chickens have
been able to contain every
outstanding individual they have
faced this season, but the 170
pound Jackson ran for two
touchdowns and picked up first
down yardage almost every time
quarterback Ty Paine called on
him.
Paine ran the triple option
superbly and gained 78 yards on
the ground himself for rn average
of over five yards per carry. Paine
was also able to pass when he had
to, hitting Jim Forrest for 13
yards on third down with 40
seconds left in the game to keep
the Cougar drive alive. WSU ranks
last in the Pac-8 in passing
offense, but Paine almost matched
second ranked Bunce's statistics,
completing 9 of 21 for 161 yards
while Bunce hit on 13 of 25 for
170 yards.
Paine also exhibited great
poise, often checking off at the
line of scrimmage when the
Stanford defense appeared to be
set up to stop the play he had
called in the huddle. His pass to
Ike Nelson with ten seconds left
to give WSU a first and goal on
the Indian ten yard line was an
audible called at the line.
The key to the Cougars'
offensive success was Paine's
amazing execution of the option
play. His quick and sharp cuts
into the line and perfect timing of
the pitch-out to Jackosn kept the
Thunder Chickens off balance.
Great Blocking
Ralston commented that WSU
blocked his club better than
anyone had before. Everyone
knew that Jackson and Paine were
tremendous athletes, but the
performance of the Cougar
offensive line was unexpected.

The line was led by guard Steve
Busch who blocked Sports
Illustrated's lineman of the week
Pete Lazetich out of most of the
action.
The WSU defensive unit also
played better than expected,
coming up with the big play when
needed to stop Indian drives.
Strong safety Chuck Hawthorne
sparked a Cougar secondary that
WSU coach Jim Sweeney calls,
"the best in the league." The
Cougar secondary contained
Stanford's explosive passing
attack better than any team this
season.
Offensively, the Indians were
once again unable to punch the
ball the last 20 yards for
touchdowns.
Stanford was hurt by the
absense of Jeff Siemon in the
second half. Siemon sprained an
ankle and took himself out of the
game. The Indians' other major
injury was to Tim Robnett who
may have suffered broken ribs.
Rose Bowl Race
The Indians' loss throws the
Rose Bowl race into total
confusion.
Ironically, the only undefeated
team is Cal who has been declared
out of the race by the Pac-8
because they are playing
suspended star Isaac Curtis. Every
other team in the league has lost
at least one game, and no one is
out of Rose Bowl contention
now.
Stanford must win its game
with Oregon State next week in
order to have a chance for a
return trip to Pasadena. If the
Indians win their last two
conference games with the

Beavers and the Bruins, and WSU
loses one more game, then a Rose
Bowl trip is clinched. The Cougars
are the only team that can deny
the Indians even if they go
undefeated for the rest of the
year.
Oregon, with one loss in the
Pac-8, would be the co-favorite
with OSU if Stanford loses next
week. The Ducks will play WSU
next week, and out of that game
and the Stanford-OSU battle will
probably emerge a favorite in the
confused Rose Bowl race.
John Ralston described it very
well. "If we had won the game,
we would have stolen it. If you
can't move the ball and eat up the
clock or hold them deep in their
own territory, you don't deserve
to win."

numerous Cougar drives and kept
Stanford within reach, but a field
goal by Jim Sweet with no time
left gave WSU its first conference
victory, 24-23.
The Cougars piled up 133
yards in the last five minutes
during two drives, the last of
which produced the winning field
goal. Led by the brilliant running
of Bernard Jackson, WSU seemed
to move downfield at will in the
last minutes of the game through
a Stanford defense that could not
make the big play all afternoon.
Cougars Dominate
The Cougars moved the ball for
459 yards against the Thunder
Chickens with an average of six
yards gained every time the ball
was snapped. The Indian offense
drove for 349 yards but the WSU
defense held when it had to with
two minutes left in the game to
gain possession. Stanford took the
opening kickoff in the second half
and marched 67 yards in nine
plays to score on a two yard
plunge by Hillary Shockley, but
other than that, the Indians could
not put together another
touchdown drive. Three times
Don Bunce and the offensive crew
could only get close enough for
Rod Garcia to kick a field goal.
Jackson left many potential
Indian tacklers with empty arms

on his way to a 145 yard rushing
day. The Thunder Chickens have
been able to contain every
outstanding individual they have
faced this season, but the 170
pound Jackson ran for two
touchdowns and picked up first
down yardage almost every time
quarterback Ty Paine called on
him.
Paine ran the triple option
superbly and gained 78 yards on
the ground himself for rn average
of over five yards per carry. Paine
was also able to pass when he had
to, hitting Jim Forrest for 13
yards on third down with 40
seconds left in the game to keep
the Cougar drive alive. WSU ranks
last in the Pac-8 in passing
offense, but Paine almost matched
second ranked Bunce's statistics,
completing 9 of 21 for 161 yards
while Bunce hit on 13 of 25 for
170 yards.
Paine also exhibited great
poise, often checking off at the
line of scrimmage when the
Stanford defense appeared to be
set up to stop the play he had
called in the huddle. His pass to
Ike Nelson with ten seconds left
to give WSU a first and goal on
the Indian ten yard line was an
audible called at the line.
The key to the Cougars'
offensive success was Paine's
amazing execution of the option
play. His quick and sharp cuts
into the line and perfect timing of
the pitch-out to Jackosn kept the
Thunder Chickens off balance.
Great Blocking
Ralston commented that WSU
blocked his club better than
anyone had before. Everyone
knew that Jackson and Paine were
tremendous athletes, but the
performance of the Cougar
offensive line was unexpected.

The line was led by guard Steve
Busch who blocked Sports
Illustrated's lineman of the week
Pete Lazetich out of most of the
action.
The WSU defensive unit also
played better than expected,
coming up with the big play when
needed to stop Indian drives.
Strong safety Chuck Hawthorne
sparked a Cougar secondary that
WSU coach Jim Sweeney calls,
"the best in the league." The
Cougar secondary contained
Stanford's explosive passing
attack better than any team this
season.
Offensively, the Indians were
once again unable to punch the
ball the last 20 yards for
touchdowns.
Stanford was hurt by the
absense of Jeff Siemon in the
second half. Siemon sprained an
ankle and took himself out of the
game. The Indians' other major
injury was to Tim Robnett who
may have suffered broken ribs.
Rose Bowl Race
The Indians' loss throws the
Rose Bowl race into total
confusion.
Ironically, the only undefeated
team is Cal who has been declared
out of the race by the Pac-8
because they are playing
suspended star Isaac Curtis. Every
other team in the league has lost
at least one game, and no one is
out of Rose Bowl contention
now.
Stanford must win its game
with Oregon State next week in
order to have a chance for a
return trip to Pasadena. If the
Indians win their last two
conference games with the

Beavers and the Bruins, and WSU
loses one more game, then a Rose
Bowl trip is clinched. The Cougars
are the only team that can deny
the Indians even if they go
undefeated for the rest of the
year.
Oregon, with one loss in the
Pac-8, would be the co-favorite
with OSU if Stanford loses next
week. The Ducks will play WSU
next week, and out of that game
and the Stanford-OSU battle will
probably emerge a favorite in the
confused Rose Bowl race.
John Ralston described it very
well. "If we had won the game,
we would have stolen it. If you
can't move the ball and eat up the
clock or hold them deep in their
own territory, you don't deserve
to win."
Although the Indians were
massive 24 point favorites going
into Saturday's clash with the
Cougars, they were soundly
beaten in almost every phase of
the game by a better team.
