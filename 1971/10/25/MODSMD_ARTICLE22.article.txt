# Trojans Demolish Frosh
## 
### 
Buoyed by an impressive list of
former high school all-Americans,
the Southern California Frosh
football team routed the Stanford
Freshmen, 37-0, to confirm the
now-apparent fact that the
forthcoming years will be bright
ones for the 'JSC football
program.
Quarterback Pat Hayden
skillfully led SC's balanced scoring
attack, throwing two touchdowns
to his ends Reece (for twelve
yards) and John McKay (for

thirteen yards). His runningbacks,
led by the elusive Allen Carter,
who scored two touchdowns on
runs of twenty-one and
thirty-eight yards, filled out the
scoring. Even the defense got into
the act momentarily, when they
came up with a blocked punt for a
safety.
For Stanford, it was a rather
dismal day from start to finish,
though the play of certain
individuals was outstanding, as
was the overall performance of

the defense. That unit, led by
defensive backs, Mike Cook and
Mike Yancey, held the explosive
Trojans scoreless through the first
quarter, but seemed to tire
thereafter, and SC took advantage
of crucial injuries that
incapacitated valuable Stanford
players. Dispite the incessant
charging of the Indian front four,
Hayden was able to get off
successful, if wobbly, passes.
Nonetheless, Coach Bill Moultrie
termed the defensive job as
"super".
