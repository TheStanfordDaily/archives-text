Typhoon Hits Vietnam
SAIGON — Thousands of American troops, many of
them scheduled for rotation to the United States,
were mobilized yesterday to repair damage estimated
in the millions of dollars at three U.S. bases wrecked
by Typhoon Hester.
President Nguyen Van Thieu promised quick relief
to the more than 3 million civilians who live in the
hard-hit northern provinces of South Vietnam,
covering an area of 1 0,000 square miles. Thieu
appealed to the people to remain calm.
The death toll rose to at least 36, including three
American Gls. Twenty-one U.S. servicemen were
among hundreds of persons injured in the typhoon.
Toronto Arrests
TORONTO — Police said yesterday they arrested two
men and seized a number of firearms after receiving
tips that an attempt would be made to assassinate
Soviet Premier Alexei N. Kosygin during his 24-hour
visit here.
Police said earlier they raided several homes of
Edmund Burke Society members in Toronto last
night, and seized what they called "equipment." Paul
Fromm, a member of the rightwing society, said "a
number of hunting rifles and fishing knives" were
taken.
Kosygin made a flying five-hour visit to
Edmonton, Alta., yesterday on his way to Toronto.
Hundreds of police armed with machine guns and
revolvers stood between him and some 700 angry
demonstrators.

S. Africa Raids
FORT ELIZABETH, South Africa — Security Police
searched the homes of 30 prominent churchmen,
student leaders, university lecturers and writers in a
pre dawn sweep yesterday in seven South African
cities.
Among those whose homes were searched was
Athol Fugard, the playwright whose works have
severely criticized South Africa's apartheid racial
policies.
The police carried warrants issued in terms of the
Terrorism and Suppression of Communist Acts that
referred to such banned organizations as the South
African Communist party and the African National
Congress.
The raids took place in Capetown, Port Elizabeth,
East London, Grahamstown, Durban,
Pietermaritzburg and Johannesburg.
Withdrawal Pressure
WASHINGTON — A steadily mounting House vote
less than 30 short of endorsing an Indochina war
deadline is pressuring President Nixon to announce a
total American ground combat withdrawal from
Vietnam by next July if not an even more rapid
pullout. The White House won't say how dramatic
the Nov. 15 announcement will be.
But Tuesday's House vote on accepting the
Senate's six-month deadline—so close that House
leaders wouldn't risk a direct vote—made clear
Congress is close to approving a deadline if Nixon
doesn't.

"That may have been our last gasp," a White
House aide said of Tuesday's vote.
Rehnquist Query
WASHINGTON - Sen. Edmund S. Muskie said
yesterday he thinks William H. Rehnquist, an
assistant attorney general newly nominated to the
Supreme Court, should be questioned about his role
in the mass arrests of antiwar demonstrators here last
May.
Muskie, who is not a member of the Judiciary
Committee which will hold hearings on the
nomination of Rehnquist and that of Lewis F. Powell
Jr., would not say whether he would actually oppose
Rehnquist. Nor would he predict Senate action on his
nomination.
Belfast Deaths
BELFAST — Police said last night they killed a
terrorist bomber, the sixth civilian slain by authorities
in a weekend of rioting and shooting in troubled
Northern Ireland.
Guerrilla gunmen wounded three British soldiers
earlier yesterday and the rebels declared their forces
"on the offensive."
The latest civilian death occurred after two men
and a woman were seen planting a bomb outside a
Belfast nightclub before midnight, police said. They
said the three fled, ignoring a warning to halt, and
officers opened fire.
One man was killed, a woman was wounded and
another man was captured, a spokesman reported.
