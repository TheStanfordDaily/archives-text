# Franklin Rebuffed
## Witness Immunity Denied 
### PHIL REVZIN 
Special Assistant to the President
John Schwartz Saturday flatly denied
Professor H. Bruce Franklin's request
for immunity from University
prosecution for defense witnesses at
Franklin's Advisory Board hearing.
Schwartz said that "the
administration is not willing to provide
immunity from prosecution for
witnesses or persons mentioned during
the course of testimony.
Schwartz was replying to a motion
made Friday by Franklin asking for
assurance that defense witnesses, which
he said included several workers, would
not lose their jobs or be otherwise
punished for their testimony.
Franklin further moved that if
immunity was not granted, the Board
should strike all testimony presented
during the administration's case
concerning events inside the
Computation Center February 10.
The Maoist professor is charged with
urging and inciting the shutdown of the
Computation Center, but is not charged
with entering the building.
Testimony Remains
Board chairman Kennedy ruled
Friday that he would not strike
testimony on the events inside, and said
that it was not up to the board to grant
immunity. He asked counsel for both
parties to meet to "explore the
possibilities" and perhaps reach a
compromise.

Franklin called the refusal of
immunity an "attempt to intimidate
our witnesses," and indicated that the
defense would have to reshape its case
due to the ruling.
"I won't allow any workers to risk
their jobs in order to save mine,"
Franklin said. "We will have to knock
out three-quarters of our witnesses."
Schwartz indicated that the
administration would not prosecute
people who were simply in the
Computation Center or remained in the
area after the order to disperse, and
suggested that Franklin utilize such
witnesses for his case.
'Direct Threat'
Franklin called Schwartz's statement
a "direct threat to prosecute and
intimidate witnesses. The issue here is
the strength and depth of oppression in
that statement."
Franklin's witnesses Saturday were
frequently reminded that the
administration has not granted
immunity, and that any people they
mentioned faced the threat of
prosecution.
Saturday's witnesses included
Assistant Professor of Mathematics Paul
Eklof, who testified that he was asked
to go over to the Computation Center
as a faculty observer. Ecklof testified
that he entered the building, and saw
no damage to the equipment.
"There seemed to be a general
agreement between the people inside
not to damage the machine," he added.
Eklof stated that he left the building
then he heard that the police were
coming, and then stayed around to
observe the ensuing confrontation.
Franklin Talking
He further testified that he saw
Franklin talking to a group of three or
four faculty members on the lawn
outside the center. According to Eklof,
Franklin was saying that the order to
disperse was illegal, and that the faculty
observers should stay in the area. Eklof
also said that Franklin had spoken to
police representatives about the
dispersal order.
According to Eklof, "one-fourth to
one-half of the people in the area
started to leave after the orders to

disperse. Not everyone appeared to be
leaving."
He said that it didn't occur to him
that the order was illegal because he
had never been in a similar situation.
Eklof said that as he was running
from the area during the police charge,
he was knocked down by a policeman's
club.
Franklin moved for dismissal of the
Computation Center charge after Eklof
testified that he had written a letter
containing his observation v>f the events
to President Lyman February 11.
Franklin claimed that the
Administration had not provided the
defense with these reports.
Fisher Replied
Administration counsel Raymond
Fisher said that the University will
search through the files to see if there
are any other such reports.
Assistant professor of Chemical
Engineering George Homsy testified
that he and a group of colleagues had
observed the events, and that he
thought the orders to disperse were not
to be taken quite seriously. "There
seemed to be no reason to declare that
an illegal assembly."
Homsy said that he went to the
Computation Center because he used
the computer and was concerned about
damage to the machine. He said that his
colleagues told him that they had heard
that the demonstrators were not going
to harm the computer.
The professor said that he saw
Franklin tell Graduate Dean Lincoln
Moses that all the faculty observers had
left, and that there would be no one
left to tell the true story of the
confrontation if Moses left. Homsy said
that Moses seemed hurt by Franklin's
words and walked away.
Hit By Clubs
Homsy further testified that he was
struck by police clubs several times as
he attempted to leave the scene, and
that he was bedridden for a week with
his injuries.
Sophomore Steve Dwoney testified
that he had gone in the Computation
Center at some point during the
occupation and saw no damage to the

PASSING TlMEâ€”There have already been 21 sessions of suspended English Professor H. Bnre Franklin's hearing. Needless to
say, things can get a little dull, even if it's your own father who's on trial. Robby Franklin here appears to be passing the time
with a little drawing. Perhaps he's making more decorations for the defense table.
machines. Downey refused to answer
specific questions on cross-examination
concerning actions of individuals inside
the center.
Downey said that his intent was "to
shut down the center" because of his
concern about the GAMUT-H research
program being run for the Stanford
Research Institute (SRI). GAMUT-H
concerns plans for an amphibious
assault on North Vietnam.
He said that after Franklin had
talked to other faculty members,
"some people including Franklin went
to talk to Sergeant Tamm about the
dispersal order." Downey said that as
Franklin was talking to Tamm, two
policemen grabbed Franklin at the
same time the police charged the
crowd.
'Conscious Decision'
Downey testified that "the people
inside the building made a conscious
decision not to damage the equipment,
and that they had communicated this
decision to Officers Tamm and Marron
when the police had entered the
building to talk with the
demonstrators.
He added that he felt personally that
the dispersal order was "invalid" and
did not apply to him.
Joseph Hardegree, now part-time
campus minister, testified that he saw
no acts of violence outside the
Computation Center, and that he
understood that the people inside had

agreed not to damage the computer.
Friday's session featured long
argument about motions for immunity.
The day's only witness was Research
Associate Lee Her/enberg, who
testified that there had been a meeting
of movement people the afternoon of
February 9 to "push for a strike," and
that she had heard that Franklin had
attended this meeting.
Herzenberg said that at the meeting
in Dinkelspiel later that evening there
appeared to be three distinct groups:
those advocating a sit-in, those
advocating a strike or non-violent
boycott, and those advocating
off-campus political work. She said that
Franklin was advocating a strike or
boycott at the meeting, and that he had
not been involved in any planning or
leafletting before the occupation.
The hearing resumes at 1 p.m.
today.
