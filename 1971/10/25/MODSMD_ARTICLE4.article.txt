# Charge Of Nuclear Attack Research Rebutted
## 
### BOB BACON 
Stanford Medical Center officials have issued a
rebuttal to charges that a researcher there is exposing
human subjects to simulated nuclear flashes.
In an opinion column published in last Friday's
Daily, Peter Knutson of the Association of Young
Crows made the charges in reference to an Air
Force-funded research project being conducted by
opthalmologist Heinrich W. Rose. The Medical Center
administration's reply appears on page 3 of today's
Daily.
Rose's Medical Center office is now being guarded
by a security officer, after the doctor received a
threatening telephone call on Thursday in which the
caller referred to him as a "war criminal."
The Daily was not able to reach Rose over the
weekend for comment on the questions raised in the
Friday column.
Denies Military Use
The Medical Center claims that Rose's project "is
to fill a gap in our knowledge about the effects of
visible light on the retina of the eye—nothing
more. . .The Medical School contract does not
include any requirements to compute safe distances
from atomic bombs (emphasis theirs)."
They cite as possible non-military uses, medical
problems related to excessive sunlight, auto headlight
glare, lightning, eclipse viewing, and arc welding
apparatus.
Knutson's column noted that when Rose was
asked to what use he thought the Air Force would
put the results of his research, he replied "That's their
business."
Pilot Shield?
Knutson claimed that "specifications for
protective devices to shield Air Force pilots on

nuclear bombing missions" are being prepared by the
project.
The SWOPSI report on military research at
Stanford quotes Defense Department sources as
stating that "data will be applied in assessing man's
response in a nuclear environment."
According to *he SWOPSI project, Rose's research
proposal to the Air Force states that "the lamps used
resemble the optical radiation from nuclear
weapons."
The Daily was unable to view the research contract
itself. The Medical Center News Bureau's file copy is
in the hands of Dr. John L. Wilson, former Dean of
the Medical Center and current chairman of the
human subjects committee.
Los Alamos Connection?
"Young Crows" are also delving into Rose's
background. Knutson quoted Dr. H. Christian Zweng,
an associate of Rose, as saying that Rose had been
involved with the atomic bomb project at Los
Alamos, New Mexico, shortly after the Second World
War.
The Medical Center letter notes that Zweng has
denied this statement; the Daily was unable to
contact Zweng
Rose's vitae, supplied by the Medical Center News
Bureau, makes no mention of Los Alamos, and states
that from 1945-47 Rose was a research scientist for
the United States Army Air Force at Heidelberg,
Germany.
The spokesman quoted Rose as saying, "I've never
even seen Los Alamos except from an airplane at
30,000 feet."
Knutson supplied the Daily with excerpts from
three articles in the AM A Archives of Opthalmology
coauthored by Rose, dealing with effects of atomic

explosions on the eyes. One described case studies of
humans accidentally exposed to the fireballs, the
other two dealt with experiments conducted with
rabbits at the Atomic Energy Commission's Nevada
Test Center. The articles were published in 1955.
Research Topics
Biographical material supplied by the Medical
Center states that during the years 1947-59, when
Rose was a faculty member of the Air Force School
of Aviation Medicine at San Antonio, Texas, among
his research topics was "effect of atomic weapons."
During World War II Rose was a part-time
practicing opthalmologist in Vienna, Austria, and also
served as a Flight Surgeon in the German Air Force.
He conducted research "on night vision, depth
perception and color vision," and "tested effects of
medication on night vision and designed depth
perception tests."
His depth perception studies are described in the
July 30,1951 issue of Newsweek.
Medical Center officials stated that Rose's current
project was approved by the Committee on the Use
of Human Subjects in Research in late 1967 only on
the understanding that it would be reviewed again
before any human subjects were used. To date, no
subject meeting the requirements has been found, as
the Medical Center's letter states.
They also pointed out that the photo-coagulation
apparatus being used in Rose's current study is very
similar to that used in treatment of patients with
detached retinas.
Hospital spokesmen pointed out that the research
Rose is doing is unclassified, and no matter what the
source of the funding, the results would be published
in scientific journals and be made available to all
interested organizations for whatever purposes they
wish it.

Bureau, makes no mention of Los Alamos, and states
that from 1945-47 Rose was a research scientist for
the United States Army Air Force at Heidelberg,
Germany.
The spokesman quoted Rose as saying, "I've never
even seen Los Alamos except from an airplane at
30,000 feet."
Knutson supplied the Daily with excerpts from
three articles in the AM A Archives of Opthalmology
coauthored by Rose, dealing with effects of atomic

explosions on the eyes. One described case studies of
humans accidentally exposed to the fireballs, the
other two dealt with experiments conducted with
rabbits at the Atomic Energy Commission's Nevada
Test Center. The articles were published in 1955.
Research Topics
Biographical material supplied by the Medical
Center states that during the years 1947-59, when
Rose was a faculty member of the Air Force School
of Aviation Medicine at San Antonio, Texas, among
his research topics was "effect of atomic weapons."
During World War II Rose was a part-time
practicing opthalmologist in Vienna, Austria, and also
served as a Flight Surgeon in the German Air Force.
He conducted research "on night vision, depth
perception and color vision," and "tested effects of
medication on night vision and designed depth
perception tests."
His depth perception studies are described in the
July 30,1951 issue of Newsweek.
Medical Center officials stated that Rose's current
project was approved by the Committee on the Use
of Human Subjects in Research in late 1967 only on
the understanding that it would be reviewed again
before any human subjects were used. To date, no
subject meeting the requirements has been found, as
the Medical Center's letter states.
They also pointed out that the photo-coagulation
apparatus being used in Rose's current study is very
similar to that used in treatment of patients with
detached retinas.
Hospital spokesmen pointed out that the research
Rose is doing is unclassified, and no matter what the
source of the funding, the results would be published
in scientific journals and be made available to all
interested organizations for whatever purposes they
wish it.

ON GUARD—A guard has been stationed outside the door of opthalmologist Dr.
Heinrich W. Rose after he received a threatening phone call on Thursday in which
the caller referred to him as a "war criminal." Rose has come under fire recently
by those who charged that research being done by him concerns eye protection
for pilots in nuclear attacks. Medical Center officials have issued a rebuttal to the
charge.
Stanford Medical Center officials have issued a
rebuttal to charges that a researcher there is exposing
human subjects to simulated nuclear flashes.
In an opinion column published in last Friday's
Daily, Peter Knutson of the Association of Young
Crows made the charges in reference to an Air
Force-funded research project being conducted by
opthalmologist Heinrich W. Rose. The Medical Center
administration's reply appears on page 3 of today's
Daily.
Rose's Medical Center office is now being guarded
by a security officer, after the doctor received a
threatening telephone call on Thursday in which the
caller referred to him as a "war criminal."
The Daily was not able to reach Rose over the
weekend for comment on the questions raised in the
Friday column.
Denies Military Use
The Medical Center claims that Rose's project "is
to fill a gap in our knowledge about the effects of
visible light on the retina of the eye—nothing
more. . .The Medical School contract does not
include any requirements to compute safe distances
from atomic bombs (emphasis theirs)."
They cite as possible non-military uses, medical
problems related to excessive sunlight, auto headlight
glare, lightning, eclipse viewing, and arc welding
apparatus.
Knutson's column noted that when Rose was
asked to what use he thought the Air Force would
put the results of his research, he replied "That's their
business."
Pilot Shield?
Knutson claimed that "specifications for
protective devices to shield Air Force pilots on

nuclear bombing missions" are being prepared by the
project.
The SWOPSI report on military research at
Stanford quotes Defense Department sources as
stating that "data will be applied in assessing man's
response in a nuclear environment."
According to *he SWOPSI project, Rose's research
proposal to the Air Force states that "the lamps used
resemble the optical radiation from nuclear
weapons."
The Daily was unable to view the research contract
itself. The Medical Center News Bureau's file copy is
in the hands of Dr. John L. Wilson, former Dean of
the Medical Center and current chairman of the
human subjects committee.
Los Alamos Connection?
"Young Crows" are also delving into Rose's
background. Knutson quoted Dr. H. Christian Zweng,
an associate of Rose, as saying that Rose had been
involved with the atomic bomb project at Los
Alamos, New Mexico, shortly after the Second World
War.

denied this statement; the Daily was unable to

rebuttal to charges that a researcher there is exposing
human subjects to simulated nuclear flashes.
In an opinion column published in last Friday's
Daily, Peter Knutson of the Association of Young
Crows made the charges in reference to an Air
Force-funded research project being conducted by
opthalmologist Heinrich W. Rose. The Medical Center
administration's reply appears on page 3 of today's
Daily.
Rose's Medical Center office is now being guarded
by a security officer, after the doctor received a
threatening telephone call on Thursday in which the
caller referred to him as a "war criminal."
The Daily was not able to reach Rose over the
weekend for comment on the questions raised in the
Friday column.
Denies Military Use
The Medical Center claims that Rose's project "is
to fill a gap in our knowledge about the effects of
visible light on the retina of the eye—nothing
more. . .The Medical School contract does not
include any requirements to compute safe distances
from atomic bombs (emphasis theirs)."
They cite as possible non-military uses, medical
problems related to excessive sunlight, auto headlight
glare, lightning, eclipse viewing, and arc welding
apparatus.
Knutson's column noted that when Rose was
asked to what use he thought the Air Force would
put the results of his research, he replied "That's their
business."
Pilot Shield?
Knutson claimed that "specifications for
protective devices to shield Air Force pilots on

nuclear bombing missions" are being prepared by the
project.
The SWOPSI report on military research at
Stanford quotes Defense Department sources as
stating that "data will be applied in assessing man's
response in a nuclear environment."
According to *he SWOPSI project, Rose's research
proposal to the Air Force states that "the lamps used
resemble the optical radiation from nuclear
weapons."
The Daily was unable to view the research contract
itself. The Medical Center News Bureau's file copy is
in the hands of Dr. John L. Wilson, former Dean of
the Medical Center and current chairman of the
human subjects committee.
Los Alamos Connection?
"Young Crows" are also delving into Rose's
background. Knutson quoted Dr. H. Christian Zweng,
an associate of Rose, as saying that Rose had been
involved with the atomic bomb project at Los
Alamos, New Mexico, shortly after the Second World
War.
The Medical Center letter notes that Zweng has
denied this statement; the Daily was unable to
contact Zweng
Rose's vitae, supplied by the Medical Center News
Bureau, makes no mention of Los Alamos, and states
that from 1945-47 Rose was a research scientist for
the United States Army Air Force at Heidelberg,
Germany.
The spokesman quoted Rose as saying, "I've never
even seen Los Alamos except from an airplane at
30,000 feet."
Knutson supplied the Daily with excerpts from
three articles in the AM A Archives of Opthalmology
coauthored by Rose, dealing with effects of atomic

explosions on the eyes. One described case studies of
humans accidentally exposed to the fireballs, the
other two dealt with experiments conducted with
rabbits at the Atomic Energy Commission's Nevada
Test Center. The articles were published in 1955.
Research Topics
Biographical material supplied by the Medical
Center states that during the years 1947-59, when
Rose was a faculty member of the Air Force School
of Aviation Medicine at San Antonio, Texas, among
his research topics was "effect of atomic weapons."
During World War II Rose was a part-time
practicing opthalmologist in Vienna, Austria, and also
served as a Flight Surgeon in the German Air Force.
He conducted research "on night vision, depth
perception and color vision," and "tested effects of
medication on night vision and designed depth
perception tests."
His depth perception studies are described in the
July 30,1951 issue of Newsweek.
Medical Center officials stated that Rose's current
project was approved by the Committee on the Use
of Human Subjects in Research in late 1967 only on
the understanding that it would be reviewed again
before any human subjects were used. To date, no
subject meeting the requirements has been found, as
the Medical Center's letter states.
They also pointed out that the photo-coagulation
apparatus being used in Rose's current study is very
similar to that used in treatment of patients with
detached retinas.
Hospital spokesmen pointed out that the research
Rose is doing is unclassified, and no matter what the
source of the funding, the results would be published
in scientific journals and be made available to all
interested organizations for whatever purposes they
wish it.

ON GUARD—A guard has been stationed outside the door of opthalmologist Dr.
Heinrich W. Rose after he received a threatening phone call on Thursday in which
the caller referred to him as a "war criminal." Rose has come under fire recently
by those who charged that research being done by him concerns eye protection
for pilots in nuclear attacks. Medical Center officials have issued a rebuttal to the
charge.
