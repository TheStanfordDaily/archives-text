# Liberty & Stanford's Court Order
## News in Review 
### Bill Evers 
Last week at the Stanford
Medical Center, doctors armed
with a court order deliberately
and consciously violated the
express desires of a patient. In
acting as they did, the Stanford
hospital doctors and those who
aided and abetted them struck a
blow against religious liberty and
aggressively invaded their patient's
human right to control her own
body.
Here are the particulars of the
case, briefly stated. An
18-year-old, anemic woman was
about to give birth prematurely to
twins. Her physician, Dr. Robert
Goodlin, an associate professor of
gynecology and obstetrics in the
school of medicine, believed that
a blood transfusion might be
necessary during delivery in order
that the mother and the babies,
once delivered, might live. But the
birth of the twins, one stillborn
and one a baby girl, occurred
without a transfusion being
necessary, in the doctor's opinion.
Some hours later, nonetheless,
the woman was still hemorrhaging.
The doctor decided that a
transfusion was necessary. A
transfusion was performed, and at
about the same time the woman
stopped bleeding so that a massive
transfusion, which the doctor had
believed might eventually be
appropriate, was not performed.
However, the woman was
studying to be a Jehovah's
Witness, her husband's religion,
whose doctrine forbids such a
blood transfusion. The woman
said that she did not want a blood
transfusion for herself, framing
her answers always in terms of her
husband's preference.
Nevertheless, her choice was clear,
whatever the reasons she voiced
Earlier in the day, before the
birth, the doctor had telephoned
Cassius Kirk, a staff counsel in the
University's office for business
affairs in Encina, and said that it
might be necessary to obtain a
court order to transfuse the
woman before the delivery.
That day, the decision to ask

for a court order involved the
doctors on the case; John
Williams, associate director for
administration at the Med Center;
and Dr. Thomas Gonda, the
director of the Med Center.
Later, when the woman was
still bleeding several hours after
the birth, Kirk went before a
judge of the superior court and

obtained a court order essentially
directing the doctors to perform
the transfusion.
Anyone refusing to co-operate
with such a court order can be
cited for contempt of court and
sentenced to jail or fined. The
judge who gave the University this
court order admitted at the time,
according to Kirk, that he didn't
think his decision would stand up
on appeal to a higher court. But
by then the transfusion and the
violation of religious liberty
would already have happened.
In a 1965 Illinois case, In re
Brooks' Estate, the state supreme
court invalided, on the grounds
that basic constitutional rights
were being violated, a similar
court order obtained by a
hospital.
So the doctors went ahead and
performed the transfusion.
I believe that every person
should by right exercise
ownership "over his own self, over
his will and actions, and the
manner in which he will exert his
own labor."
There is only one other
possibility: A society in which
some are under the hegemony of
others, a situation which does not
abolish ownership. The right of
ownership is simply involuntarily
transferred to the rulers. The slave

gives up all control over his will,
except for the decision not to
rebel.
It is on the axiom that each
individual has an absolute right of
property in his or her own body,
that people can and do call for
repealing the draft, repealing
abortion laws, and repealing laws
prohibiting or regulating the

ingestion of drugs.
For example, Lucinda Cisler
argued in the August 1970
Ramparts for the total repeal of
all laws prohibiting or regulating
abortions on the grounds that a
woman "belongs to herself and
not to the state." Murray
Rothbard writes, "The crucial
point is that the fetus is contained
within the body of its mother; it
is, in fact, a parasite upon that
body. The mother has the
absolute right to get rid of this
parasitic growth, this internal part
of her body. Period. Therefore,
abortions should be legal."
Once we recognize that a
person has an absolute right to
control his or her body, we can
see that the University ought not
to have obtained a court order to
give the mother a transfusion.
It should not be thought
because I uphold the right of a
Jehovah's Witness to use and
dispose of his body as he sees fit,
that I agree with the beliefs of the
Jehovah's Witness. I most
emphatically do not. I consider it
to be irrational to refuse a blood
transfusion in order to save one's
life.
Thus, I am not saying that all
theories about life are equally
valid, or that a person ought to
believe that which is false or

mistaken. The reasons for
religious liberty lie elsewhere.
As John Courtney Murray and
Robert A. Graham put it:"The
reason why every man may claim
immunity from coercion in
matters religious is precisely his
inalienable dignity as a human
person. ..A man's religious
decisions, or his decision against
religion, are inescapably his own.
No one else can make them for
him, or compel him to make this
decision or that, or restrain him
from putting his decisions into
practice, privately or publicly,
alone or in company with others.
In all these cases, the dignity of
man would be diminished because
of the denial to him of that
inalienable responsibility for his
own decisions and actions which
is the essential counterpart of his
freedom." That is to say, if the
beliefs of the Jehovah's Witnesses
are erroneous, they will receive
their comeuppance.

Total freedom requires that a
person be free to do as he wills
with his own. He has a right to
noninterference in his noncoercive
activities.
I therefore believe in order that
no future similar acts of injustice
occur, that Stanford University
must make a policy statement
affirming the individual's right to
control his own body.
This would entail formal
University recognition of the
general category of which the
Jehovah's Witness case was an
instance. It would mean, for
example, recognition of the
injustice of legally-required
hospital review boards for
abortion cases and of the injustice
involved in University police
co-operation with any arrest for
the sale or use of drugs.
I further believe that justice
demands in this case that Stanford
University issue a formal apology
to the woman.

freedom." That is to say, if the
beliefs of the Jehovah's Witnesses
are erroneous, they will receive
their comeuppance.

Total freedom requires that a
person be free to do as he wills
with his own. He has a right to
noninterference in his noncoercive
activities.
I therefore believe in order that
no future similar acts of injustice
occur, that Stanford University
must make a policy statement
affirming the individual's right to
control his own body.
This would entail formal
University recognition of the
general category of which the
Jehovah's Witness case was an
instance. It would mean, for
example, recognition of the
injustice of legally-required
hospital review boards for
abortion cases and of the injustice
involved in University police
co-operation with any arrest for
the sale or use of drugs.
I further believe that justice
demands in this case that Stanford
University issue a formal apology
to the woman.
Last week at the Stanford
Medical Center, doctors armed
with a court order deliberately
and consciously violated the
express desires of a patient. In
acting as they did, the Stanford
hospital doctors and those who
aided and abetted them struck a
blow against religious liberty and
aggressively invaded their patient's
human right to control her own
body.
Here are the particulars of the
case, briefly stated. An
18-year-old, anemic woman was
about to give birth prematurely to
twins. Her physician, Dr. Robert
Goodlin, an associate professor of
gynecology and obstetrics in the
school of medicine, believed that
a blood transfusion might be
necessary during delivery in order
that the mother and the babies,
once delivered, might live. But the
birth of the twins, one stillborn
and one a baby girl, occurred
without a transfusion being
necessary, in the doctor's opinion.
Some hours later, nonetheless,
the woman was still hemorrhaging.
The doctor decided that a
transfusion was necessary. A
transfusion was performed, and at
about the same time the woman
stopped bleeding so that a massive
transfusion, which the doctor had
believed might eventually be
appropriate, was not performed.
However, the woman was
studying to be a Jehovah's
Witness, her husband's religion,
whose doctrine forbids such a
blood transfusion. The woman
said that she did not want a blood
transfusion for herself, framing
her answers always in terms of her
husband's preference.
Nevertheless, her choice was clear,
whatever the reasons she voiced
Earlier in the day, before the
birth, the doctor had telephoned
Cassius Kirk, a staff counsel in the
University's office for business
affairs in Encina, and said that it
might be necessary to obtain a
court order to transfuse the
woman before the delivery.
That day, the decision to ask

for a court order involved the
doctors on the case; John
Williams, associate director for
administration at the Med Center;
and Dr. Thomas Gonda, the
director of the Med Center.
Later, when the woman was
still bleeding several hours after
the birth, Kirk went before a
judge of the superior court and

obtained a court order essentially
directing the doctors to perform
the transfusion.
Anyone refusing to co-operate
with such a court order can be
cited for contempt of court and
sentenced to jail or fined. The
judge who gave the University this
court order admitted at the time,
according to Kirk, that he didn't
think his decision would stand up
on appeal to a higher court. But
by then the transfusion and the
violation of religious liberty
would already have happened.
In a 1965 Illinois case, In re
Brooks' Estate, the state supreme
court invalided, on the grounds
that basic constitutional rights
were being violated, a similar
court order obtained by a
hospital.
So the doctors went ahead and
performed the transfusion.
I believe that every person
should by right exercise
ownership "over his own self, over
his will and actions, and the
manner in which he will exert his
own labor."
There is only one other
possibility: A society in which
some are under the hegemony of
others, a situation which does not
abolish ownership. The right of
ownership is simply involuntarily
transferred to the rulers. The slave

gives up all control over his will,
except for the decision not to
rebel.
It is on the axiom that each
individual has an absolute right of
property in his or her own body,
that people can and do call for
repealing the draft, repealing
abortion laws, and repealing laws
prohibiting or regulating the

ingestion of drugs.
For example, Lucinda Cisler
argued in the August 1970
Ramparts for the total repeal of
all laws prohibiting or regulating
abortions on the grounds that a
woman "belongs to herself and
not to the state." Murray
Rothbard writes, "The crucial
point is that the fetus is contained
within the body of its mother; it
is, in fact, a parasite upon that
body. The mother has the
absolute right to get rid of this
parasitic growth, this internal part
of her body. Period. Therefore,
abortions should be legal."
Once we recognize that a
person has an absolute right to
control his or her body, we can
see that the University ought not
to have obtained a court order to
give the mother a transfusion.
It should not be thought
because I uphold the right of a
Jehovah's Witness to use and
dispose of his body as he sees fit,
that I agree with the beliefs of the
Jehovah's Witness. I most
emphatically do not. I consider it
to be irrational to refuse a blood
transfusion in order to save one's
life.
Thus, I am not saying that all
theories about life are equally
valid, or that a person ought to
believe that which is false or

mistaken. The reasons for
religious liberty lie elsewhere.
As John Courtney Murray and
Robert A. Graham put it:"The
reason why every man may claim
immunity from coercion in
matters religious is precisely his
inalienable dignity as a human
person. ..A man's religious
decisions, or his decision against
religion, are inescapably his own.
No one else can make them for
him, or compel him to make this
decision or that, or restrain him
from putting his decisions into
practice, privately or publicly,
alone or in company with others.
In all these cases, the dignity of
man would be diminished because
of the denial to him of that
inalienable responsibility for his
own decisions and actions which
is the essential counterpart of his
freedom." That is to say, if the
beliefs of the Jehovah's Witnesses
are erroneous, they will receive
their comeuppance.

Total freedom requires that a

with his own. He has a right to

life.
Thus, I am not saying that all
theories about life are equally
valid, or that a person ought to
believe that which is false or

mistaken. The reasons for
religious liberty lie elsewhere.
As John Courtney Murray and
Robert A. Graham put it:"The
reason why every man may claim
immunity from coercion in
matters religious is precisely his
inalienable dignity as a human
person. ..A man's religious
decisions, or his decision against
religion, are inescapably his own.
No one else can make them for
him, or compel him to make this
decision or that, or restrain him
from putting his decisions into
practice, privately or publicly,
alone or in company with others.
In all these cases, the dignity of
man would be diminished because
of the denial to him of that
inalienable responsibility for his
own decisions and actions which
is the essential counterpart of his
freedom." That is to say, if the
beliefs of the Jehovah's Witnesses
are erroneous, they will receive
their comeuppance.

Total freedom requires that a
person be free to do as he wills
with his own. He has a right to
noninterference in his noncoercive
activities.
I therefore believe in order that
no future similar acts of injustice
occur, that Stanford University
must make a policy statement
affirming the individual's right to
control his own body.
This would entail formal
University recognition of the
general category of which the
Jehovah's Witness case was an
instance. It would mean, for
example, recognition of the
injustice of legally-required
hospital review boards for
abortion cases and of the injustice
involved in University police
co-operation with any arrest for
the sale or use of drugs.
I further believe that justice
demands in this case that Stanford
University issue a formal apology
to the woman.
Last week at the Stanford
Medical Center, doctors armed
with a court order deliberately
and consciously violated the
express desires of a patient. In
acting as they did, the Stanford
hospital doctors and those who
aided and abetted them struck a
blow against religious liberty and
aggressively invaded their patient's
human right to control her own
body.
Here are the particulars of the
case, briefly stated. An
18-year-old, anemic woman was
about to give birth prematurely to
twins. Her physician, Dr. Robert
Goodlin, an associate professor of
gynecology and obstetrics in the
school of medicine, believed that
a blood transfusion might be
necessary during delivery in order
that the mother and the babies,
once delivered, might live. But the
birth of the twins, one stillborn
and one a baby girl, occurred
without a transfusion being
necessary, in the doctor's opinion.
Some hours later, nonetheless,
the woman was still hemorrhaging.
The doctor decided that a
transfusion was necessary. A
transfusion was performed, and at
about the same time the woman
stopped bleeding so that a massive
transfusion, which the doctor had
believed might eventually be
appropriate, was not performed.
However, the woman was
studying to be a Jehovah's
Witness, her husband's religion,
whose doctrine forbids such a
blood transfusion. The woman
said that she did not want a blood
transfusion for herself, framing
her answers always in terms of her
husband's preference.
Nevertheless, her choice was clear,
whatever the reasons she voiced
Earlier in the day, before the
birth, the doctor had telephoned
Cassius Kirk, a staff counsel in the
University's office for business
affairs in Encina, and said that it
might be necessary to obtain a
court order to transfuse the
woman before the delivery.
That day, the decision to ask

for a court order involved the
doctors on the case; John
Williams, associate director for
administration at the Med Center;
and Dr. Thomas Gonda, the
director of the Med Center.
Later, when the woman was
still bleeding several hours after
the birth, Kirk went before a
judge of the superior court and

obtained a court order essentially
directing the doctors to perform
the transfusion.
Anyone refusing to co-operate
with such a court order can be
cited for contempt of court and
sentenced to jail or fined. The
judge who gave the University this
court order admitted at the time,
according to Kirk, that he didn't
think his decision would stand up
on appeal to a higher court. But
by then the transfusion and the
violation of religious liberty
would already have happened.
In a 1965 Illinois case, In re
Brooks' Estate, the state supreme
court invalided, on the grounds
that basic constitutional rights
were being violated, a similar
court order obtained by a
hospital.
So the doctors went ahead and
performed the transfusion.
I believe that every person
should by right exercise
ownership "over his own self, over
his will and actions, and the
manner in which he will exert his
own labor."
There is only one other
possibility: A society in which
some are under the hegemony of
others, a situation which does not
abolish ownership. The right of
ownership is simply involuntarily
transferred to the rulers. The slave

gives up all control over his will,
except for the decision not to
rebel.
It is on the axiom that each
individual has an absolute right of
property in his or her own body,
that people can and do call for
repealing the draft, repealing
abortion laws, and repealing laws
prohibiting or regulating the

ingestion of drugs.
For example, Lucinda Cisler
argued in the August 1970
Ramparts for the total repeal of
all laws prohibiting or regulating
abortions on the grounds that a
woman "belongs to herself and
not to the state." Murray
Rothbard writes, "The crucial
point is that the fetus is contained
within the body of its mother; it
is, in fact, a parasite upon that
body. The mother has the
absolute right to get rid of this
parasitic growth, this internal part
of her body. Period. Therefore,
abortions should be legal."
Once we recognize that a
person has an absolute right to
control his or her body, we can
see that the University ought not
to have obtained a court order to
give the mother a transfusion.
It should not be thought
because I uphold the right of a
Jehovah's Witness to use and
dispose of his body as he sees fit,
that I agree with the beliefs of the
Jehovah's Witness. I most
emphatically do not. I consider it
to be irrational to refuse a blood
transfusion in order to save one's
life.
Thus, I am not saying that all
theories about life are equally
valid, or that a person ought to
believe that which is false or
