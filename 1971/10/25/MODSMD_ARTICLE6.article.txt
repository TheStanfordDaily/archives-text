Editor, THE DAILY:
An article with the headline
"Human Subjects, Nuclear
Warfare and Stanford," and with
"a young crow" instead of a
signature appeared in the October
22 issue of the Daily.
We feel it should be answered,
not only because it contains
distorted and invidious statements
about Dr. Rose personally, but
because either through lack of
information or by reason of
deliberate misrepresentations, the
facts about this project are not
accurately presented.
The idea of this research is to
fill a gap in our knowledge about
the effects of visible light on the
retina of the eye—nothing more.
Dr. Rose is interested in the
protection of humans from
excessive sunlight, from glare, and
from industrial light sources such
as welding arcs and welding lasers.
He as been active on committees
for developing industrial safety
glasses, protection for workers
using industrial lasers, and
protection against
microwaves—for instance,
microwave ovens used by
housewives.
Use of visible light in treatment
or prevention of blinding diseases
of the eye is a common procedure
used in thousands of patients all
over the world. In one facet of
this project it was projected to
apply much lower levels of visible
light than now used in treatment
to volunteers whose eyes would
have to be removed because of
malignant disease. Such patients
are very rare and so far no such
eyes have been studied. If patients
are found who wish to volunteer
for such studies, approval will be
required by the University
Committee for Use of Human
Subjects in Research.
It should be noted that
members of the research team
have subjected their own healthy
eyes to visible light at vastly
higher levels than those intended
for volunteers in this project.

Several distortions of fact
should be pointed out in the Daily
article:
1. The Medical School contract
does not include any requirements
to compute safe distances from
atomic bombs, as the article has
stated. But it is conceivable that
the same information which is
necessary to protect workers in
factories could be used for
protection of pilots from light
energies of any sort.
2. The Daily quotes the
SWOPSI report as saying that
DOD funding for the project
began in 1969 and peaks in
mid-19 72. Actually, what remains
of this contract is $12,000 and
ends May, 1972.
3. The Daily says: "Apparently
this Stanford contract has the
distinction of being the first
comprehensive exposure of living
human eyes to simulated nuclear
flashes." This statement reveals
poor understanding of the
principle of photocoagulation
which has been around for at least
17 years. This contract is not the
first in the U.S. to perform such
measurements. In addition, there
are several U.S. Public Health
Service contracts—two at Stanford
Medical School—also concerned,
in part, with light damage
thresholds.
4. The Daily makes reference
to use on this research of a Xenon
Arc Lamp custom-built by SRI.
There are thousands of these
machines available commercially
and one has been in use at the
Medical Center for more than a
decade for treatment of eye
disease. It has undergone a slight
modification through addition of
special filters to reduce light
energies to the treated eyes.

5 . The Daily quotes Dr. Zweng
as saying that Dr. Rose was
brought from Germany by the
U.S. military following World War
11, to work on atomic projects
including the huge blasts at Los
Alamos, New Mexico.
Dr. Zweng denies the substance
of the statement relating to Los
Alamos. Dr. Rose has never
worked for, nor even been at Los
Alamos. During the war he was a
flight surgeon in the German Air
Force. He was invited to the U.S.
in 194 7 to join the faculty of the
School of Aviation Medicine (now
School of Aerospace Medicine) in
San Antonio, Texas to do research
and teaching in physiological
optics and ophthalmology. He
joined the Medical School at
Stanford in 1966 from Lockheed
where he worked on space
medicine. He has worked to
develop parameters of laser pulse
that would permit treatment of
eye disease with a minimum of
undesirable side effects.
6. The Daily states that the
Medical Center refused to divulge
information concerning Rose's
background. This is untrue. Every
effort was made to provide Mr.
Peter Knutson with information
he needed. He was aware of the
above facts, but he chose to
ignore them.

of this contract is $12,000 and
ends May, 1972.
3. The Daily says: "Apparently
this Stanford contract has the
distinction of being the first
comprehensive exposure of living
human eyes to simulated nuclear
flashes." This statement reveals
poor understanding of the
principle of photocoagulation
which has been around for at least
17 years. This contract is not the
first in the U.S. to perform such
measurements. In addition, there
are several U.S. Public Health
Service contracts—two at Stanford
Medical School—also concerned,
in part, with light damage
thresholds.
4. The Daily makes reference
to use on this research of a Xenon
Arc Lamp custom-built by SRI.
There are thousands of these
machines available commercially
and one has been in use at the
Medical Center for more than a
decade for treatment of eye
disease. It has undergone a slight
modification through addition of
special filters to reduce light
energies to the treated eyes.

5 . The Daily quotes Dr. Zweng
as saying that Dr. Rose was
brought from Germany by the
U.S. military following World War
11, to work on atomic projects
including the huge blasts at Los
Alamos, New Mexico.
Dr. Zweng denies the substance
of the statement relating to Los
Alamos. Dr. Rose has never
worked for, nor even been at Los
Alamos. During the war he was a
flight surgeon in the German Air
Force. He was invited to the U.S.
in 194 7 to join the faculty of the
School of Aviation Medicine (now
School of Aerospace Medicine) in
San Antonio, Texas to do research
and teaching in physiological
optics and ophthalmology. He
joined the Medical School at
Stanford in 1966 from Lockheed
where he worked on space
medicine. He has worked to
develop parameters of laser pulse
that would permit treatment of
eye disease with a minimum of
undesirable side effects.
6. The Daily states that the
Medical Center refused to divulge
information concerning Rose's
background. This is untrue. Every
effort was made to provide Mr.
Peter Knutson with information
he needed. He was aware of the
above facts, but he chose to
ignore them.

Editor, THE DAILY:
An article with the headline
"Human Subjects, Nuclear
Warfare and Stanford," and with
"a young crow" instead of a
signature appeared in the October
22 issue of the Daily.
We feel it should be answered,
not only because it contains
distorted and invidious statements
about Dr. Rose personally, but
because either through lack of
information or by reason of
deliberate misrepresentations, the
facts about this project are not
accurately presented.
The idea of this research is to
fill a gap in our knowledge about
the effects of visible light on the
retina of the eye—nothing more.
Dr. Rose is interested in the
protection of humans from
excessive sunlight, from glare, and
from industrial light sources such
as welding arcs and welding lasers.
He as been active on committees
for developing industrial safety
glasses, protection for workers
using industrial lasers, and
protection against
microwaves—for instance,
microwave ovens used by
housewives.
Use of visible light in treatment
or prevention of blinding diseases
of the eye is a common procedure
used in thousands of patients all
over the world. In one facet of
this project it was projected to
apply much lower levels of visible
light than now used in treatment
to volunteers whose eyes would
have to be removed because of
malignant disease. Such patients
are very rare and so far no such
eyes have been studied. If patients
are found who wish to volunteer
for such studies, approval will be
required by the University
Committee for Use of Human
Subjects in Research.
It should be noted that
members of the research team
have subjected their own healthy
eyes to visible light at vastly
higher levels than those intended
for volunteers in this project.

Several distortions of fact
should be pointed out in the Daily
article:
1. The Medical School contract
does not include any requirements
to compute safe distances from
atomic bombs, as the article has
stated. But it is conceivable that
the same information which is
necessary to protect workers in
factories could be used for
protection of pilots from light
energies of any sort.
2. The Daily quotes the
SWOPSI report as saying that
DOD funding for the project
began in 1969 and peaks in
mid-19 72. Actually, what remains
of this contract is $12,000 and
ends May, 1972.

Editor, THE DAILY:
An article with the headline
"Human Subjects, Nuclear
Warfare and Stanford," and with
"a young crow" instead of a
signature appeared in the October
22 issue of the Daily.
We feel it should be answered,
not only because it contains
distorted and invidious statements
about Dr. Rose personally, but
because either through lack of
information or by reason of
deliberate misrepresentations, the
facts about this project are not
accurately presented.
The idea of this research is to
fill a gap in our knowledge about
the effects of visible light on the
retina of the eye—nothing more.
Dr. Rose is interested in the
protection of humans from
excessive sunlight, from glare, and
from industrial light sources such
as welding arcs and welding lasers.
He as been active on committees
for developing industrial safety
glasses, protection for workers
using industrial lasers, and
protection against
microwaves—for instance,
microwave ovens used by
housewives.
Use of visible light in treatment
or prevention of blinding diseases
of the eye is a common procedure
used in thousands of patients all
over the world. In one facet of
this project it was projected to
apply much lower levels of visible
light than now used in treatment
to volunteers whose eyes would
have to be removed because of
malignant disease. Such patients
are very rare and so far no such
eyes have been studied. If patients
are found who wish to volunteer
for such studies, approval will be
required by the University
Committee for Use of Human
Subjects in Research.
It should be noted that
members of the research team
have subjected their own healthy
eyes to visible light at vastly
higher levels than those intended
for volunteers in this project.

Several distortions of fact
should be pointed out in the Daily
article:
1. The Medical School contract
does not include any requirements
to compute safe distances from
atomic bombs, as the article has
stated. But it is conceivable that
the same information which is
necessary to protect workers in
factories could be used for
protection of pilots from light
energies of any sort.
2. The Daily quotes the
SWOPSI report as saying that
DOD funding for the project
began in 1969 and peaks in
mid-19 72. Actually, what remains
of this contract is $12,000 and
ends May, 1972.
3. The Daily says: "Apparently
this Stanford contract has the
distinction of being the first
comprehensive exposure of living
human eyes to simulated nuclear
flashes." This statement reveals
poor understanding of the
principle of photocoagulation
which has been around for at least
17 years. This contract is not the
first in the U.S. to perform such
measurements. In addition, there
are several U.S. Public Health
Service contracts—two at Stanford
Medical School—also concerned,
in part, with light damage
thresholds.
4. The Daily makes reference
to use on this research of a Xenon
Arc Lamp custom-built by SRI.
There are thousands of these
machines available commercially
and one has been in use at the
Medical Center for more than a
decade for treatment of eye
disease. It has undergone a slight
modification through addition of
special filters to reduce light
energies to the treated eyes.

5 . The Daily quotes Dr. Zweng
as saying that Dr. Rose was
brought from Germany by the
U.S. military following World War
11, to work on atomic projects
including the huge blasts at Los
Alamos, New Mexico.
Dr. Zweng denies the substance
of the statement relating to Los
Alamos. Dr. Rose has never
worked for, nor even been at Los
Alamos. During the war he was a
flight surgeon in the German Air
Force. He was invited to the U.S.
in 194 7 to join the faculty of the
School of Aviation Medicine (now
School of Aerospace Medicine) in
San Antonio, Texas to do research
and teaching in physiological
optics and ophthalmology. He
joined the Medical School at
Stanford in 1966 from Lockheed
where he worked on space
medicine. He has worked to
develop parameters of laser pulse
that would permit treatment of
eye disease with a minimum of
undesirable side effects.
6. The Daily states that the
Medical Center refused to divulge
information concerning Rose's
background. This is untrue. Every
effort was made to provide Mr.
Peter Knutson with information
he needed. He was aware of the
above facts, but he chose to
ignore them.
