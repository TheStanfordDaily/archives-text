"In the beginning God created
the heaven and the earth....
And God said, Let us make man
in our image, after our likeness;
and let them have dominion over
the fish of the sea, and over the
fowl of the air, and over the
cattle, and over all the earth ....
And the rib, which the Lord God
had taken from man, made he a
woman and brought her unto the
man .... And the Lord God said
unto the woman, What is this that
thou hast done? And the woman
said, The serpent beguiled me, and
I did eat.... Unto the woman
He said, I will greatly multiply thy
sorrow and thy conception; in
sorrow thou shalt bring forth
children; and thy desire shall be to
thy husband, and he shall rule
over thee." (Gen. 1,2,3)
And lest anyone fail to grasp
the moral of this story, Saint Paul
provides further clarification:
"For a man .. .is the image and
glory of God; but the woman is
the glory of the man. For the man
is not of the woman, but the
woman of the man. Neither was
the man created for the woman,
but the woman for the man." (I
Cor. 11)
"Let the woman learn in
silence with all subjection. But I
suffer not a woman to teach, nor
to usurp authority over the man,
but to be in silence. For Adam
was first formed, then Eve. And
Adam was not deceived, but the
woman, being deceived, was in the
transgression. Notwithstanding,
she shall be saved in childbearing,
if they continue in faith and
charity and holiness with
sobriety." (I Tim. 2)
And lest it be thought that
only Christians have this rich
heritage of ideology about
women, consider the morning
prayer of the Orthodox Jew:
"Blessed art Thou, oh Lord our
God, King of the Universe, that I
was not born a gentile.
"Blessed art Thou, oh Lord our
God, King of the Universe, that I
was not born a slave.
"Blessed art Thou, oh Lord our
God, King of the Universe, that I
was not born a woman."
Or the Koran, the sacred text
of Islam:
"Men are superior to women
on account of the qualities in
which God has given them
pre-eminence."
Because they think they sense
a decline' in feminine "faith,
charity, and holiness with
sobriety," many people today

jump to the conclusion that the
ideology expressed in these
passages is a relic of the past. Not
so. It has simply been obscured by
an equalitarian veneer, and the
ideology has now become
nonconscious. That is, we remain
unaware of it because alternative
beliefs and attitudes about women
go unimagined. We are like the
fish who is unaware that his
environment is wet. After all, what
else could it be?
Such is the nature of all
nonconscious ideologies. Such is
the nature of America's ideology
about women. For even those
Americans who agree that a black
skin should not uniquely qualify
its owner for janitorial or
domestic service continue to act
as if the possession of a uterus
uniquely qualifies its owner for
precisely that.
Consider, for example, the
1968 student rebellion at
Columbia University. Students
from the radical left took over
some administration buildings in
the name of equalitarian
principles which they accused the
university of flouting. Here were
the most militant spokesmen one
could hope to find in the cause of
equalitarian ideals. But no sooner
had they occupied the buildings
than the male militants blandly
turned to their sisters-in-arms and
assigned them the task of
preparing the food, while
they—the menfolk—would
presumably plan further strategy.
The reply these males received
was the reply they deserved, and
the fact that domestic tasks

behind the barricades were
desegregated across the sex line
that day is an everlasting tribute
to the class consciousness of the
ladies of the left.
But these conscious coeds are
not typical, for the nonconscious
assumptions about a woman's
"natural" talents (or lack of
them) are at least as prevalent
among women as they are among
men. A psychologist named Philip
Goldberg (1968 ) demonstrated
this by asking female college
students to rate a number of
professional articles from each of
six fields.
The articles were collated into
two equal sets of booklets and the
names of the authors were
changed so that the identical
article was attributed to a male
author (e.g., John T. McKay) in
one set of booklets and to a
female author (e.g., Joan T.
McKay) in the other set. Each
student was asked to read the
articles in her booklet and to rate
them for value, competence,
persuasiveness, writing style, and
so forth.
As he had anticipated,
Goldberg found that the identical
article received significantly lower
ratings when it was attributed to a
female author than when it was
attributed to a male author. He
had predicted this result for
articles from professional fields
generally considered the province
of men, like law and city
planning, but to his surprise, these
coeds also downgraded articles
from the fields of dietetics and
elementary school education

when they were attributed to
female authors.
In other words, these students
rated the male authors as better at
everything, agreeing with Aristotle
that "we should regard the female
nature as afflicted with a natural
defectiveness." We repeated this
experiment informally in our own
classrooms and discovered that
male students show the same
implicit prejudice against female
authors that Goldberg's female
students showed. Such is the
nature of a nonconscious
ideology!
It is significant that examples
like these can be drawn from the
college world, for today's students
have challenged the established
ways of looking at almost every
other issue, and they have been
quick to reject those practices of
our society which conflict
explicitly with their major values.
But as the above examples
suggest, they will find it far more
difficult to shed the more subtle
aspects of a sex-role ideology
which—as we shall now attempt to
demonstrate--conflicts just as
surely with their existential values
as any of the other societal
practices to which they have so
effectively raised objection. And
as we shall see, there is no better
way to appreciate the power of a
society's nonconscious ideology
than to examine it within the
framework of values held by that
society's avant-garde.

article received significantly lower
ratings when it was attributed to a
female author than when it was
attributed to a male author. He
had predicted this result for
articles from professional fields
generally considered the province
of men, like law and city
planning, but to his surprise, these
coeds also downgraded articles
from the fields of dietetics and
elementary school education

when they were attributed to
female authors.
In other words, these students
rated the male authors as better at
everything, agreeing with Aristotle
that "we should regard the female
nature as afflicted with a natural
defectiveness." We repeated this
experiment informally in our own
classrooms and discovered that
male students show the same
implicit prejudice against female
authors that Goldberg's female
students showed. Such is the
nature of a nonconscious
ideology!
It is significant that examples
like these can be drawn from the
college world, for today's students
have challenged the established
ways of looking at almost every
other issue, and they have been
quick to reject those practices of
our society which conflict
explicitly with their major values.
But as the above examples
suggest, they will find it far more
difficult to shed the more subtle
aspects of a sex-role ideology
which—as we shall now attempt to
demonstrate--conflicts just as
surely with their existential values
as any of the other societal
practices to which they have so
effectively raised objection. And
as we shall see, there is no better
way to appreciate the power of a
society's nonconscious ideology
than to examine it within the
framework of values held by that
society's avant-garde.

"In the beginning God created
the heaven and the earth....
And God said, Let us make man
in our image, after our likeness;
and let them have dominion over
the fish of the sea, and over the
fowl of the air, and over the
cattle, and over all the earth ....
And the rib, which the Lord God
had taken from man, made he a
woman and brought her unto the
man .... And the Lord God said
unto the woman, What is this that
thou hast done? And the woman
said, The serpent beguiled me, and
I did eat.... Unto the woman
He said, I will greatly multiply thy
sorrow and thy conception; in
sorrow thou shalt bring forth
children; and thy desire shall be to
thy husband, and he shall rule
over thee." (Gen. 1,2,3)
And lest anyone fail to grasp
the moral of this story, Saint Paul
provides further clarification:
"For a man .. .is the image and
glory of God; but the woman is
the glory of the man. For the man
is not of the woman, but the
woman of the man. Neither was
the man created for the woman,
but the woman for the man." (I
Cor. 11)
"Let the woman learn in
silence with all subjection. But I
suffer not a woman to teach, nor
to usurp authority over the man,
but to be in silence. For Adam
was first formed, then Eve. And
Adam was not deceived, but the
woman, being deceived, was in the
transgression. Notwithstanding,
she shall be saved in childbearing,
if they continue in faith and
charity and holiness with
sobriety." (I Tim. 2)
And lest it be thought that
only Christians have this rich
heritage of ideology about
women, consider the morning
prayer of the Orthodox Jew:
"Blessed art Thou, oh Lord our
God, King of the Universe, that I
was not born a gentile.
"Blessed art Thou, oh Lord our
God, King of the Universe, that I
was not born a slave.
"Blessed art Thou, oh Lord our
God, King of the Universe, that I
was not born a woman."
Or the Koran, the sacred text
of Islam:
"Men are superior to women
on account of the qualities in
which God has given them
pre-eminence."
Because they think they sense
a decline' in feminine "faith,
charity, and holiness with
sobriety," many people today

jump to the conclusion that the
ideology expressed in these
passages is a relic of the past. Not
so. It has simply been obscured by
an equalitarian veneer, and the
ideology has now become
nonconscious. That is, we remain
unaware of it because alternative
beliefs and attitudes about women
go unimagined. We are like the
fish who is unaware that his
environment is wet. After all, what
else could it be?
Such is the nature of all
nonconscious ideologies. Such is
the nature of America's ideology
about women. For even those
Americans who agree that a black
skin should not uniquely qualify
its owner for janitorial or
domestic service continue to act
as if the possession of a uterus
uniquely qualifies its owner for
precisely that.
Consider, for example, the
1968 student rebellion at
Columbia University. Students
from the radical left took over
some administration buildings in
the name of equalitarian
principles which they accused the
university of flouting. Here were
the most militant spokesmen one
could hope to find in the cause of
equalitarian ideals. But no sooner
had they occupied the buildings
than the male militants blandly
turned to their sisters-in-arms and
assigned them the task of
preparing the food, while
they—the menfolk—would
presumably plan further strategy.
The reply these males received
was the reply they deserved, and
the fact that domestic tasks

behind the barricades were
desegregated across the sex line
that day is an everlasting tribute
to the class consciousness of the
ladies of the left.
But these conscious coeds are
not typical, for the nonconscious
assumptions about a woman's
"natural" talents (or lack of
them) are at least as prevalent
among women as they are among
men. A psychologist named Philip
Goldberg (1968 ) demonstrated
this by asking female college
students to rate a number of
professional articles from each of
six fields.
The articles were collated into
two equal sets of booklets and the
names of the authors were
changed so that the identical
article was attributed to a male
author (e.g., John T. McKay) in
one set of booklets and to a
female author (e.g., Joan T.
McKay) in the other set. Each
student was asked to read the
articles in her booklet and to rate
them for value, competence,
persuasiveness, writing style, and
so forth.
As he had anticipated,
Goldberg found that the identical
article received significantly lower
ratings when it was attributed to a
female author than when it was

1968 student rebellion at
Columbia University. Students
from the radical left took over
some administration buildings in
the name of equalitarian
principles which they accused the
university of flouting. Here were
the most militant spokesmen one
could hope to find in the cause of
equalitarian ideals. But no sooner
had they occupied the buildings
than the male militants blandly
turned to their sisters-in-arms and
assigned them the task of
preparing the food, while
they—the menfolk—would
presumably plan further strategy.
The reply these males received
was the reply they deserved, and
the fact that domestic tasks

behind the barricades were
desegregated across the sex line
that day is an everlasting tribute
to the class consciousness of the
ladies of the left.
But these conscious coeds are
not typical, for the nonconscious
assumptions about a woman's
"natural" talents (or lack of
them) are at least as prevalent
among women as they are among
men. A psychologist named Philip
Goldberg (1968 ) demonstrated
this by asking female college
students to rate a number of
professional articles from each of
six fields.
The articles were collated into
two equal sets of booklets and the
names of the authors were
changed so that the identical
article was attributed to a male
author (e.g., John T. McKay) in
one set of booklets and to a
female author (e.g., Joan T.
McKay) in the other set. Each
student was asked to read the
articles in her booklet and to rate
them for value, competence,
persuasiveness, writing style, and
so forth.
As he had anticipated,
Goldberg found that the identical
article received significantly lower
ratings when it was attributed to a
female author than when it was
attributed to a male author. He
had predicted this result for
articles from professional fields
generally considered the province
of men, like law and city
planning, but to his surprise, these
coeds also downgraded articles
from the fields of dietetics and
elementary school education

when they were attributed to
female authors.
In other words, these students
rated the male authors as better at
everything, agreeing with Aristotle
that "we should regard the female
nature as afflicted with a natural
defectiveness." We repeated this
experiment informally in our own
classrooms and discovered that
male students show the same
implicit prejudice against female
authors that Goldberg's female
students showed. Such is the
nature of a nonconscious
ideology!
It is significant that examples
like these can be drawn from the
college world, for today's students
have challenged the established
ways of looking at almost every
other issue, and they have been
quick to reject those practices of
our society which conflict
explicitly with their major values.
But as the above examples
suggest, they will find it far more
difficult to shed the more subtle
aspects of a sex-role ideology
which—as we shall now attempt to
demonstrate--conflicts just as
surely with their existential values
as any of the other societal
practices to which they have so
effectively raised objection. And
as we shall see, there is no better
way to appreciate the power of a
society's nonconscious ideology
than to examine it within the
framework of values held by that
society's avant-garde.

"In the beginning God created
the heaven and the earth....
And God said, Let us make man
in our image, after our likeness;
and let them have dominion over
the fish of the sea, and over the
fowl of the air, and over the
cattle, and over all the earth ....
And the rib, which the Lord God
had taken from man, made he a
woman and brought her unto the
man .... And the Lord God said
unto the woman, What is this that
thou hast done? And the woman
said, The serpent beguiled me, and
I did eat.... Unto the woman
He said, I will greatly multiply thy
sorrow and thy conception; in
sorrow thou shalt bring forth
children; and thy desire shall be to
thy husband, and he shall rule
over thee." (Gen. 1,2,3)
And lest anyone fail to grasp
the moral of this story, Saint Paul
provides further clarification:
"For a man .. .is the image and
glory of God; but the woman is
the glory of the man. For the man
is not of the woman, but the
woman of the man. Neither was
the man created for the woman,
but the woman for the man." (I
Cor. 11)
"Let the woman learn in
silence with all subjection. But I
suffer not a woman to teach, nor
to usurp authority over the man,
but to be in silence. For Adam
was first formed, then Eve. And
Adam was not deceived, but the
woman, being deceived, was in the
transgression. Notwithstanding,
she shall be saved in childbearing,
if they continue in faith and
charity and holiness with
sobriety." (I Tim. 2)
And lest it be thought that
only Christians have this rich
heritage of ideology about
women, consider the morning
prayer of the Orthodox Jew:
"Blessed art Thou, oh Lord our
God, King of the Universe, that I
was not born a gentile.
"Blessed art Thou, oh Lord our
God, King of the Universe, that I
was not born a slave.
"Blessed art Thou, oh Lord our
God, King of the Universe, that I
was not born a woman."
Or the Koran, the sacred text
of Islam:
"Men are superior to women
on account of the qualities in
which God has given them
pre-eminence."
Because they think they sense
a decline' in feminine "faith,
charity, and holiness with
sobriety," many people today

jump to the conclusion that the
ideology expressed in these
passages is a relic of the past. Not
so. It has simply been obscured by
an equalitarian veneer, and the
ideology has now become
nonconscious. That is, we remain
unaware of it because alternative
beliefs and attitudes about women
go unimagined. We are like the
fish who is unaware that his
environment is wet. After all, what
else could it be?
Such is the nature of all
nonconscious ideologies. Such is
the nature of America's ideology
about women. For even those
Americans who agree that a black
skin should not uniquely qualify
its owner for janitorial or
domestic service continue to act
as if the possession of a uterus
uniquely qualifies its owner for
precisely that.
