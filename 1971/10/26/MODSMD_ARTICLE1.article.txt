# Academic Women Face Problems
## 
### ROBYN STICKNEY 
"The Academic Council is in many ways the heart
of the University. In January, 1971 there were 47
women (including one minority woman) on the
Academic Council at Stanford. There were 988 men."
In her report on the status of academic women at
Stanford, Anne Miner, Consultant to the President on
Affirmative Action for Women, has brought the
position of Stanford's professional woman into sharp
focus.
Miner found that the percentage of women on the
Academic Council at Stanford, which includes faculty
members at and above the rank of assistant professor,
is substantially lower than the national average.
There were no female members of the Faculty
Senate in 1969 or 1970, no women on several major
policy-making committees, and no women Academic
Council members representing the schools of
Business, Engineering, Earth Sciences, and Law.
Promotions and pay increases for women are not
comparable to those of men, even after they have
achieved regular faculty appointments. In
departments which have both men and women at
professorial rank, both have the same average length
of service at the University—l 3 years. The women,
however, have been full professors on the average of
three years, while the men have been professors for
seven .
The report, which was commissioned last spring by
President Lyman, represents an exhaustive review of
current University policies and procedures and details
21 recommendations for changes needed to "achieve
the elimination of sex discrimination in employment
actions."
"The fundamental recommendation that we add
substantially more women to the Academic Council
and achieve greater equity and opportunity for
non-Academic Council women in teaching and
research is not only for the sake of women, but for
the health of the University itself," Miner
emphasized.
"Our own policies and contractual obligations

commit us not only to avoid discrimination by sex,
but also to develop a plan to correct any patterns of
under-representation and under-utilization of women
in our work force, regardless of the cause of the
patterns."
Ray Bacchetti, Associate Provost, has indicated
that "without giving unqualified support for each
proposal. . .this is a model of what [this kind of)
report should be. Reports such as this one have been
the source of major, far-reaching change."
Leading the list of recommendations in Miner's
report is the proposal that the provost, who is
responsible for the appointment of academic
personnel, should announce a firm commitment to
academic affirmative action for women and assume
primary responsibility for its implementation.
Bacchetti noted that the probable course of the
University administration will be to review and
evaluate the implications and feasibility of each
suggestion with those persons who will be directly
affected.
Bacchetti also expressed his strong personal
conviction that in this area "change is absolutely
necessary and long overdue."
In her presentation of recommended changes,
Miner has approached the problem from the diversity
and complexity inherent in achieving an integrated
policy for various University departments.
She points out that "different schools have
different problems and will require corresponding
solutions. For some, it will be the creation of a pool
of applicants. For others, the encouragement of
undergraduate and graduate students. . .still others
must focus on actual hiring and recruiting practices."
In order to achieve greater equity and opportunity
for women at Stanford, the report proposes a series
of actions designed to implement the goal. Among
them are:
—An academic search center should be created to
provide data and active support for the search for
minority and female candidates for faculty positions.
—The Provost's Office should conduct a yearly

review of salary equity by sex.
—A review mechanism for the appropriateness of
appointment level for women in non-Academic
Council teaching posts should be designed and
implemented.
—Each dean, working with support from the
Provost's Office, should develop a reasonable range of
expectation for representation of women among
Academic Council members in his school, and, if
necessary, representation of women in non-Academic
Council faculty posts. In fields where role models are
clearly of great importance, this factor should be
considered in the process of establishing goals.
Miner also gives substantial attention to the more
subtle problems of sex stereotyping and the
devaluation of women.
"In a culture that generally perceives overt
achievement or competence in women as unnatural or
at least somewhat undesirable, many women are
limited both by their own ideas of what it is possible
for them to do, and by the reinforcement of these
stereotypes by their supervisors or co-workers.
"Many women who actually work at Stanford,
including extremely loyal and longstanding faculty
and staff, feel there is a strong climate of
discouragement for women."
This pattern of negative reinforcement, Miner
maintains, is evident in the lack of visible female role
models in the immediate environment, and the lack
of opportunity for "sponsorship" within a given
profession.
Consequently, a further recommendation
establishes:
"In recognition of the importance of role models
in the immediate environment, and in addition to any
activities as part of a staff affirmative action program,
each dean should review his current junior and senior
administrative staff and, if appropriate, distribute
administrative responsibility and status in such a way
that women are visibly involved in the senior
administration of the school.
