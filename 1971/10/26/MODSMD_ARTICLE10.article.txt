## Stanford Nuclear Warfare Research 
### 
In Friday's Daily Pete
Knutson wrote an article
describing an ongoing
experiment by Dr. Heinrich
Rose to determine thresholds
of human retinal damage
caused by light resembling that
of a nuclear flash. In Monday's
Daily a Medical Center official,
Dr. Robert Lindee, responded
criticising that article on several
points.
We admit to misreading the
funding graph on the budget
and realize that the contract
only has $12,000 left in it and
is due to end in May of 1972.
Lindee claims that "The idea
of this research is to fill a gap
in our knowledge about the
effects of visible light on the
retina of the eye—nothing
more." The official DOD
description of the contract
states "Predictions of eye safe
separation distances are required
for operational analysis and
mission planning. . . . The white
light sources for these studies
will be Xenon arc lamps
modified with suitable filters so
that the lamps used resemble
the optical radiation from
nuclear weapons."
"Data will be applied in
assessing man's response in a
nuclear environment and for
analysis of weapons systems."
The Lindee letter emphasizes
the harmless nature of the
experiment, failing to mention
that it is a Department of
Defense funded contract and
by law must have a direct
military application according
to the Mansfield Amendment.
The official Pentagon title of
this project is "Aircrew Visual
Impairment/Injury thresholds
from muclear weapons." The
data gained from this project
will enable shielding to be
developed or safe distances
computed so that both tactical
and strategic bomber crews can
carry out their missions of
destruction at the most
"efficient" altitude without
worrying about flash hazards. It
will also enable infantry men
to work in close support with
'tactical' nuclear weapons
through similar calculations of
shielding.
Lindee denies the validity of
Dr. Zweng's quote that Dr.
Rose worked at Los Alamos.
Pete accepted his statement
concerning Rose in good faith
and will assume its truth until
Dr. Zweng retracts his
statement at which point Pete
will retract his. Dr. Rose may
or may not have been at Los
Alamos during this stay at the
USAF School of Medicine (we
have evidence he was at
nuclear tests in Nevada) but in
any case the contradiction is
between Dr. Zweng's statement
(which he repeated twice) and
that of Robert Lindee of the
Med School.

Lindee constantly emphasizes
that the entire experiment is
really very inoccuous and has
little or nothing to do with
effects of nuclear warfare.
However, the effects of nuclear
weapons have long been of
interest to Dr. Rose. While at
the USAF School of Medicine
he wrote a series of articles for
the Archives of Opthalmology
entitled "Chorioretinal Burns
Produced by Atomic Flash,"
"Human Chorioretinal Burns
from Atomic Fireballs" &
"Chorioretinal Lesions Due to
Thermal Radiation From The
Atomic Bomb."
In tests with actual nuclear
bombs on rabbits and in
interviews with people who had
witnessed nuclear flashes he
and his fellow Air Force
researchers attempted to
determine effects of nuclear
flashes on eyesight. Even then
he and the Air Force were
concerned with the effects of
distance and intensity of
nuclear flashes on eyesight.
The first article states "It is
obvious from studying the
burns in question that they do
not represent the maximum
distance at which they may
occur, but that the threshold is
being approached. There is,
therefore, substantial support
for our estimates of threshold
distances for human eye lesions
as given in the table."
According to the Pentagon
statement, nuclear flash
thresholds are the subject of
Rose's currently planned
experimentation on humans.
Throughout our investigations
on this contract we have been,
contrary to the statement of
Robert Lindee about full
cooperation from Med Center
officials, systematically
hampered in our research
efforts. We were initially
prevented from seeing Rose's
biography and have still not
been allowed to see the
supposedly unclassified contract
(only the SWOPSI report).
When Paul asked Dr. John
Wilson, recently replaced head
of the Medical School, if he
could see the contract, a public
document, Wilson told him that
he would have to go through
the proper channels to see if
he was qualified and had a
legitimate interest in seeing the
contract. This was a direct
obstruction of the original idea
of declassifying war research—to
allow people to see what
military research was going on
without needing security
clearances, whether university

imposed or DOD imposed.
This is not the only war
contract being researched at
Stanford; there are 118 more,
till of which by law must have
direct military applications. It
is our feeling that if this
experiment were primarily
medically oriented it would
have been funded by the

pete knutson and paul loeb

National Institute of Health,
and not by the DOD. Dr. Rose
and his fellow researchers
refute the administration's claim
of an apolitical university and
it is to the fundamental
changing of this university that
we must address ourselves.
