# minority referendum
## 3rd World Students' Needs 
### 
The minority referendum is
the most important issue in
this quarter's ASSU elections.
Because it has been subjected
to much criticism and libel by
various campus groups, it is
necessary to clear up much of
the misunderstanding that has
resulted from the widespread
confusion as to what the
referendum is, and what it is
not.
The major attack on the
referendum is reflected in an
attempt to portray it as a
"rip-off." The accusation is
that it is somehow "being
sneaked upon the student," is
"against student will," and is
outside the "concerns" of
Stanford students.
Third World Students view
this as either an outright lie,
or as a mere rationalization for
termination of important
minority programs.
Because no expensive
propaganda campaign has been
implemented to "convince"
white students that drug,
tutoring, counseling, child-care,
and other programs for
minorities are important, they
say minorities are "sneaking"
something over on the students.
The simple fact is the intensive
efforts of the past seven years
should have raised "white
consciousness of minority
needs," at least to the point of
being able to recognize needs
so basic to people of color.
Black and other minority
groups had hoped that it
wouldn't be necessary to again
debate the need for such
long-standing, much-discussed
programs, as those covered by
the meager ASSU allotments to
3rd World groups. Minority
community service programs

altogether cost only a mere
fraction of the amount paid
for student funded programs,
i.e. the Stanford Band, the
Stanford Daily, etc.
The Zero-dollars vote has
been held forth as proof that
the referendum violates the
"will" of the students. Minority
students find that the will of
the mostly-white Stanford
student body, fluctuates with
the harshness of the
administration, the power of
student conservatives, and the
credibility of the student
radicals and revolutionaries.
Thus it is usually difficult to
determine what the median
student will is.
Nevertheless, as we consider
the most recent indicators at
our disposal (the May Plebiscite
and white concern thus far),
we have good reason to expect
greater white student concern
for minority problems. If the
will of the students is to be a
function of this concern, then
a public referendum is not
only appropriate—but will
hopefully be helpful solving
many of the problems that
now threaten our society.
In spite of the many
exaggerated charges and biased
reports, 3rd World Groups have
been consistent in their
attempts to provide educational
opportunities, educational
assistance, community services
for minorities and cultural
exchange between whites and
minorities. Minority groups feel
a responsibility both to the
disadvantaged communities from
which they come and continue
to be a part of—and to the
white student community to
which they come to and
become a part of. This latter

function is usually served in
the cultural exchange that
many of our programs provide.
Although many of the plays
and dance performances we've
presented have received less
than adequate white attendance,
we have persisted, due to the
encouragement of those whites
appreciative of this activity.
While there is little to
prepare us for such a dual
role, we have made a concerted
effort to fulfill both of these
areas of responsibility. The fact
that the referendum is an issue,
rather than a fore-gone
conclusion, holds out the
possibility of our being able to
provide meaningful service both
to the minority communities
from which we come, and the
student community of which
we're a part. The referendum
invites white students to assist
in making this possibility a
reality. The referendum is in
fact, part of that cultural
exchange and cooperation. To
try and separate the minority
referendum from this
generation's crusade against
racism, is to take a dangerous
step backward. We urge all
Stanford students to vote "yes"
for the minority referendum.
