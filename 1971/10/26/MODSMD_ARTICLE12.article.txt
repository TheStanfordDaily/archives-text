# Stanford Golfer
## Watson Turns Pro 
### DAVID HOSLEY 
Tom Watson stood at the side
of the 18 th green at the Silverado
Country Club in Napa, signing
autographs for little boys whose
scorecards were covered with the
names of pro golfers, some of
whom they would recognize right
away, some bordering on
anonymity. Watson wrote the

nine letters of his name carefully
and clearly. It was the original of
a scene which will be repeated
countless times in the next few
years.
Tom Watson, who was
worrying about midterms at
Stanford at this time last year,
had just finished playing his first
PGA tournament after qualifying

two weeks ago for the tour. And
he did well, winning $1,065 in a
tie with Homero Blancos and Bob
Goalby for 28 th place, ahead of
such established veterans as Don
January, Lee Elder, Chi Chi
Rodriguez, A 1 Geiberger and Doug
Sanders.
"It's been quite an experience.
I played awfully well for me.
After the first two rounds, I guess
the pressure caught up to me."
But Watson likes the crowds. "It's
a strange experience when there's
15,000 out there. I don't want
to seem like I'm bragging," says
Watson, "But I feel good. I gained
a lot of experience." And he
doesn't seem to be bragging.
Watson is well-liked by his new
comrades, the touring pros.
Bill Casper, who won the
tourney going away with a
whopping 19 under par was paired
with Watson for the third round,
after the Stanford grad had carded
68's for the first two rounds.
"Tom is an extremely strong
fellow. I'm sure he has a great
determination and I think he's
going to have a bright future,"
says Casper. "He's got a lot of
length and good iron shots and
putts well. All of these coupled
together make me think he's going
to make a name for himself. The
newness of playing on the tour
and playing with myself (Casper)
probably bothered him. It's hard
for a youngster on his first
tourney."
And, indeed, Watson was
bothered by playing with Casper.
What happens when a man plays
alongside someone who's been his
idol for many years? "Well, I
started thinking about his game
instead of mine," confides
Watson.
At every green he approached,
Watson commanded attention
from the fans. "This is that kid,
Watson, out of Stanford. Just
qualified for the tour. Had a hot
first two rounds." And the
sandy-haired lad with a matching
moustache would shyly smile and
calmly drop in another putt.
Sitting in the late afternoon
sun at Silverado, Watson talked
about college and his golf career.
"There were times last year when
I felt my studies were getting in
the way of my golf game. I felt
guilty about it." And even though
Watson will probably never use
the psychology degree he earned
at Stanford, he says he is happy
with his college career.
Watson lost interest in a pro
career while at Stanford. "Like
many college athletes, I drifted
away from the idea of becoming a
pro. Like many—there are too
many other things to do at
Stanford." But now he's on the
tour.
Qualifying for the Kaiser
International and making the cut
means Watson won't have to be a
"rabbit" this week. That is, he
won't have to qualify for the
Sahara this week, he can just play
the actual tournament. His good
performance at Silverado means
an added measure of confidence
and the chance to sign autographs
for all those little boys in Las
Vegas, Los Angeles and maybe
Augusta, Georgia.

says Casper. "He's got a lot of
length and good iron shots and
putts well. All of these coupled
together make me think he's going
to make a name for himself. The
newness of playing on the tour
and playing with myself (Casper)
probably bothered him. It's hard
for a youngster on his first
tourney."
And, indeed, Watson was
bothered by playing with Casper.
What happens when a man plays
alongside someone who's been his
idol for many years? "Well, I
started thinking about his game
instead of mine," confides
Watson.
At every green he approached,
Watson commanded attention
from the fans. "This is that kid,
Watson, out of Stanford. Just
qualified for the tour. Had a hot
first two rounds." And the
sandy-haired lad with a matching
moustache would shyly smile and
calmly drop in another putt.
Sitting in the late afternoon
sun at Silverado, Watson talked
about college and his golf career.
"There were times last year when
I felt my studies were getting in
the way of my golf game. I felt
guilty about it." And even though
Watson will probably never use
the psychology degree he earned
at Stanford, he says he is happy
with his college career.
Watson lost interest in a pro
career while at Stanford. "Like
many college athletes, I drifted
away from the idea of becoming a
pro. Like many—there are too
many other things to do at
Stanford." But now he's on the
tour.
Qualifying for the Kaiser
International and making the cut
means Watson won't have to be a
"rabbit" this week. That is, he
won't have to qualify for the
Sahara this week, he can just play
the actual tournament. His good
performance at Silverado means
an added measure of confidence
and the chance to sign autographs
for all those little boys in Las
Vegas, Los Angeles and maybe
Augusta, Georgia.

Tom Watson stood at the side
of the 18 th green at the Silverado
Country Club in Napa, signing
autographs for little boys whose
scorecards were covered with the
names of pro golfers, some of
whom they would recognize right
away, some bordering on
anonymity. Watson wrote the

nine letters of his name carefully
and clearly. It was the original of
a scene which will be repeated
countless times in the next few
years.
Tom Watson, who was
worrying about midterms at
Stanford at this time last year,
had just finished playing his first
PGA tournament after qualifying

two weeks ago for the tour. And
he did well, winning $1,065 in a
tie with Homero Blancos and Bob
Goalby for 28 th place, ahead of
such established veterans as Don
January, Lee Elder, Chi Chi
Rodriguez, A 1 Geiberger and Doug
Sanders.
"It's been quite an experience.
I played awfully well for me.
After the first two rounds, I guess
the pressure caught up to me."
But Watson likes the crowds. "It's
a strange experience when there's
15,000 out there. I don't want
to seem like I'm bragging," says
Watson, "But I feel good. I gained
a lot of experience." And he
doesn't seem to be bragging.
Watson is well-liked by his new
comrades, the touring pros.
Bill Casper, who won the
tourney going away with a
whopping 19 under par was paired
with Watson for the third round,
after the Stanford grad had carded
68's for the first two rounds.
"Tom is an extremely strong
fellow. I'm sure he has a great
determination and I think he's
going to have a bright future,"
says Casper. "He's got a lot of
length and good iron shots and
putts well. All of these coupled
together make me think he's going
