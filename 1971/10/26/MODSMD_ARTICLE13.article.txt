# SWOPSI Course Discusses Army Fragging & Franklin Case
## 
### KATHY WEINBERGER 
Mildred Randolph, Verna Blossomgame, and
Bruce Franklin highlighted a meeting of the
SWOPSI class "Unrest in the Academy: the Case of
Bruce Franklin" Thursday evening at the Chi Si
House. Nearly 5 0 people attended—many more than
enrolled in the class.
Randolph and Blossomgame are sisters of Billy
Smith, a Black G.I. who is accused of killing two
lieutenants in Bien Hoa, Vietnam, and attempting to
murder Captain Rigby and First Sargeant Willis.
In March of this year, a fragmentation grenade
exploded in an officers barrack—where Rigby and
Willis usually sleep—and they are accusing Smith,
according to Randolph, because they didn't like
him. "They considered him a troublemaker because
he didn't like the war—he didn't want to go out and
kill the enemy. So how could he have killed two
men he probably ate and slept with?" she asked.
"There's an important for having Billy
Smith's sisters speak to us, in connection with
Bruce's case," explained Mike Holman, member of
the SWOPSI class. "One of the results of Bruce's
hearings should be to expose the relation of DOD
contracts and the University and the U.S.
government. One DOD contract at Stanford in
particular, Zimbardo's, is meant by the Defense
Department to deal with G.l.'slike Billy Smith who
aren't willing to accept military injustice,"
continued Holman.
(Psychology Professor Phillip Zimbardo is
working on a DOD-funded contract which he calls
"Individual and Group Variables Influencing
Emotional Arousal, Violence, and Behavior." The
Defense Department calls the project "Personnel

Technology Factors Influencing Disruptive Behavior
Among Military Trainees.")
"Billy Smith got the help of a lawyer to come to
the United States for the military trial. He was
afraid he'd be killed in the stockade in Vietnam,"
added Holman. Smith is now in solitary
confinement in the Fort Ord Stockade, without
bail.
Holman pointed out, for contrast, that
Lieutenant Calley, who has been convicted of killing
Vietnamese civilians, is allowed a private apartment,
has only one guard, and is permitted frequent
overnight visits from his fiance. Smith has been
convicted of nothing and is allowed no privileges.
"After the fragging (term invented by G.l.'s in
Vietnam meaning killing officers with fragmentation
grenades), Billy was present in the formation that
was called. He had a hand grenade and black gloves
on him—evidence being held against him. But the
gloves were issued by the army and the hand
grenade had no connection to the one found in the
officers' room," said Smith's sister Verna
Blossomgame. "The captain didn't like my brother
because he had no respect for the war. It was a
personal thing," she added.
Franklin spent little time at the meeting
discussing his own case—his hearings before the
faculty Advisory Board. "Billy Smith's case is a lot
more important," he said. "People can find out
about my case any time."
"Mine is a trial not of a single individual, but of a
whole movement at Stanford, and of people
represented by that movement—working people and
people who are opposed to U.S. imperialism,l]g Jl4
explained.


VOLUNTEERS OF AMERICA—Seniors, law and business students graduating this year will be eligible to
go into training next summer for domestic assignments with VISTA. Former VISTA volunteers Mike
Rosenberg and Georgia Prescott will be in White Plaza from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. this week. Stanford produced
84 applications for VISTA last year. VISTA presently serves in 49 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto
Rico, and the Virgin Islands, working in urban slums, in rural poverty areas and among migrants and
Indians.

more important," he said. "People can find out
about my case any time."
"Mine is a trial not of a single individual, but of a
whole movement at Stanford, and of people
represented by that movement—working people and
people who are opposed to U.S. imperialism,l]g Jl4
explained.


VOLUNTEERS OF AMERICA—Seniors, law and business students graduating this year will be eligible to
go into training next summer for domestic assignments with VISTA. Former VISTA volunteers Mike
Rosenberg and Georgia Prescott will be in White Plaza from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. this week. Stanford produced
84 applications for VISTA last year. VISTA presently serves in 49 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto
Rico, and the Virgin Islands, working in urban slums, in rural poverty areas and among migrants and
Indians.
Mildred Randolph, Verna Blossomgame, and
Bruce Franklin highlighted a meeting of the
SWOPSI class "Unrest in the Academy: the Case of
Bruce Franklin" Thursday evening at the Chi Si
House. Nearly 5 0 people attended—many more than
enrolled in the class.
Randolph and Blossomgame are sisters of Billy
Smith, a Black G.I. who is accused of killing two
lieutenants in Bien Hoa, Vietnam, and attempting to
murder Captain Rigby and First Sargeant Willis.
In March of this year, a fragmentation grenade
exploded in an officers barrack—where Rigby and
Willis usually sleep—and they are accusing Smith,
according to Randolph, because they didn't like
him. "They considered him a troublemaker because
he didn't like the war—he didn't want to go out and
kill the enemy. So how could he have killed two
men he probably ate and slept with?" she asked.
"There's an important for having Billy
Smith's sisters speak to us, in connection with
Bruce's case," explained Mike Holman, member of
the SWOPSI class. "One of the results of Bruce's
hearings should be to expose the relation of DOD
contracts and the University and the U.S.
government. One DOD contract at Stanford in
particular, Zimbardo's, is meant by the Defense
Department to deal with G.l.'slike Billy Smith who
aren't willing to accept military injustice,"
continued Holman.
(Psychology Professor Phillip Zimbardo is
working on a DOD-funded contract which he calls
"Individual and Group Variables Influencing
Emotional Arousal, Violence, and Behavior." The
Defense Department calls the project "Personnel

Technology Factors Influencing Disruptive Behavior
Among Military Trainees.")
"Billy Smith got the help of a lawyer to come to
the United States for the military trial. He was
afraid he'd be killed in the stockade in Vietnam,"
added Holman. Smith is now in solitary
confinement in the Fort Ord Stockade, without
bail.
Holman pointed out, for contrast, that
Lieutenant Calley, who has been convicted of killing
Vietnamese civilians, is allowed a private apartment,
has only one guard, and is permitted frequent
overnight visits from his fiance. Smith has been
convicted of nothing and is allowed no privileges.
"After the fragging (term invented by G.l.'s in
Vietnam meaning killing officers with fragmentation
grenades), Billy was present in the formation that
was called. He had a hand grenade and black gloves
on him—evidence being held against him. But the
gloves were issued by the army and the hand
grenade had no connection to the one found in the
officers' room," said Smith's sister Verna
Blossomgame. "The captain didn't like my brother
because he had no respect for the war. It was a
personal thing," she added.
Franklin spent little time at the meeting
discussing his own case—his hearings before the
faculty Advisory Board. "Billy Smith's case is a lot
more important," he said. "People can find out
about my case any time."
"Mine is a trial not of a single individual, but of a
whole movement at Stanford, and of people
