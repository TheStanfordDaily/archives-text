# Ecologists Protest Pesticides
## 
### JAN FELDMAN 
The monthly preventative
spraying of pesticides in and
around University residences is
being protested by members of
Stanford's newly established living
unit, Ecology House.
House member Dale Hattis, a
graduate student who has worked
on pest control with the Federal
Drug Administration has
requested that the University stop
the "prophylactic use of
pesticides" at the Ecology House
and spray only when there is a

specific pest problem.
"Pesticides, like drugs, should
be used only when necessary," he
said. The Ecology House is asking
for a new pest control program
only for itself but will help the
University set up a "more sensible
and efficient program" for other
dormitories.
Stanford presently pays the
Rose Exterminator Company
seven dollars a month per
dormitory to control mice, rats,
roaches and ants. The monthly
spraying includes the use of
pesticides in the kitchens, as well
as around the outsides of
residences.
The constant use of such
chemicals can place an extra
burden on the environment,
Hattis said, and build up the pests'
resistance to insecticides. He cited
both the ill effects of pesticides
and the extra cost to the
University as reasons to stop
preventative spraying.
The Administration is receptive
to another "feasible proposal for
pest control in the residences,"
according to David Shank,
assistant to the Manager of
Residences and Fraternities. He
said he was intrigued by the idea
of a non-preventative program
which might save the environment
and some University funds.
Shank added, however, that he
would be hesitant to take any
such steps until the health aspects
of non-preventative spraying (such
as whether some pests are disease
carriers) had been explored.
The use of pesticides on
campus is not entirely on a
scheduled, preventative basis.
Stanford's Physical Plant sprays
the outsides of academic areas
only when needed, according to
Perry Hackett, Roads and
Grounds Superintendent.
Hackett stressed the
caution with which pesticides are

chosen and used by his
department. He receives and
consults publications from the
United States Department of
Agriculture and the University of
California's Agricultural
Experimental Station. Personnel
involved in spraying attend
pesticide seminars at the
University of California
Agricultural Extension
Department.
The Physical Plant also
cooperates with Stanford experts.
A June, 1971 letter to Biology
Department Chairman David
Kennedy listed the chemicals used
in spraying and described the
precautions taken by the Physical
Plant. •
Four of the chemicals used by
the Physical Plant are considered
toxic in large quantities by the
United States Department of
Agriculture. Hackett explained
the strongest of these, diazinon, is
diluted at a strength of 800 to 1,
so that a man would have to drink
two gallons of the solution to be
lethally affected.
The Stanford Athletic
Department, which pays from its
own budget for the spraying of
the athletic fields, the outside of
gymnasiums, and the golf course,
also used pesticides only to
combat specific problems. Robert
Butler of the Athletic Department
said that the Department
cooperates with the county
agriculture agents and University
Health Officer Hal Wilson.
Hattis, who is teaching a
three-unit course at the Ecology
House on the ecological effects of
pesticides, speculated as to
whether today's extensive use of
pesticides is due to aesthetic
problems or health problems. "It
is easier to deal with the
psychological problem of
bugophobia," he said, "than to
sanitize the world."

requested that the University stop
the "prophylactic use of
pesticides" at the Ecology House
and spray only when there is a

specific pest problem.
"Pesticides, like drugs, should
be used only when necessary," he
said. The Ecology House is asking
for a new pest control program
only for itself but will help the
University set up a "more sensible
and efficient program" for other
dormitories.
Stanford presently pays the
Rose Exterminator Company
seven dollars a month per
dormitory to control mice, rats,
roaches and ants. The monthly
spraying includes the use of
pesticides in the kitchens, as well
as around the outsides of
residences.
The constant use of such
chemicals can place an extra
burden on the environment,
Hattis said, and build up the pests'
resistance to insecticides. He cited
both the ill effects of pesticides
and the extra cost to the
University as reasons to stop
preventative spraying.
The Administration is receptive
to another "feasible proposal for
pest control in the residences,"
according to David Shank,
assistant to the Manager of
Residences and Fraternities. He
said he was intrigued by the idea
of a non-preventative program
which might save the environment
and some University funds.
Shank added, however, that he
would be hesitant to take any
such steps until the health aspects
of non-preventative spraying (such
as whether some pests are disease
carriers) had been explored.
The use of pesticides on
campus is not entirely on a
scheduled, preventative basis.
Stanford's Physical Plant sprays
the outsides of academic areas
only when needed, according to
Perry Hackett, Roads and
Grounds Superintendent.
Hackett stressed the
caution with which pesticides are

chosen and used by his
department. He receives and
consults publications from the
United States Department of
Agriculture and the University of
California's Agricultural
Experimental Station. Personnel
involved in spraying attend
pesticide seminars at the
University of California
Agricultural Extension
Department.
The Physical Plant also
cooperates with Stanford experts.
A June, 1971 letter to Biology
Department Chairman David
Kennedy listed the chemicals used
in spraying and described the
precautions taken by the Physical
Plant. •
Four of the chemicals used by
the Physical Plant are considered
toxic in large quantities by the
United States Department of
Agriculture. Hackett explained
the strongest of these, diazinon, is
diluted at a strength of 800 to 1,
so that a man would have to drink
two gallons of the solution to be
lethally affected.
The Stanford Athletic
Department, which pays from its
own budget for the spraying of
the athletic fields, the outside of
gymnasiums, and the golf course,
also used pesticides only to
combat specific problems. Robert
Butler of the Athletic Department
said that the Department
cooperates with the county
agriculture agents and University
Health Officer Hal Wilson.
Hattis, who is teaching a
three-unit course at the Ecology
House on the ecological effects of
pesticides, speculated as to
whether today's extensive use of
pesticides is due to aesthetic
problems or health problems. "It
is easier to deal with the
psychological problem of
bugophobia," he said, "than to
sanitize the world."
The monthly preventative
spraying of pesticides in and
around University residences is
being protested by members of
Stanford's newly established living
unit, Ecology House.
