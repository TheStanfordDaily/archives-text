# Joyous Celebration Of The Pumpkin
## 
### PAUL GRUSHKIN 
Do you know that the firemen
still shoot off 4th-of-July
fireworks at the Oak Bluffs
(Mass.) commons? And that the
Red Lodge (Mont.) "Home of
Champions" Rodeo is still a
humdinger? And that the
Republicans still hold corn-boils
in Belvidere (111.)?
Or that Englewood (N.J.) beat
Englewood (Colo.) for the fifth
straight year in the "Keep Your
City Clean" contest? And that the
Martha's Vineyard Island (Mass.)

Bass and Mackeral Derby had a
record number of entrants this
fall? And that farmers still get
psyched for the team-pull event at
the Lower Yakima (Wash.) Valley
Junior Fair?
Well, then, you won't be at all
surprised to learn that the Old
Spanishtown Art and Pumpkin
Festival at Half Moon Bay (Calif.)
this past weekend was a
resounding success.
In the wonderfully rich
tradition of American folksy
celebrations, this little

truck-farming town between the
Pacific and the foothills of the
Santa Cruz Mountains built a
festival around their renowned
commodity—pumpkins.
Although it was highly
publicized, and Half Moon Bay has
long been known for its free fields
of pumpkins, the brisk weather
kept many outsiders from
venturing down Highway 1.
Small-Town Celebration
It was just as well. The little
kids, the town councilmen, the
Future Farmers of America, the
Half Moon Bay Growers
Association, and the Andreini
Brothers Trucking Company (to
name just a few) together created
a unique heartwarming fun-frolic
of a small-town celebration.
Certainly the most commercial
portion of the festival was the
extensive exhibit of
Northern-California arts and
crafts. All entry fees, however,
went towards the Main Street
Committee For Beautification,
and although most of the
exhibitors were conspicuously not
Half Moon Bay citizenry, the
goods at the booths were richly
pleasing and colorful.
We came too late for the Pie
Eating Contest and were a day
early for the Pumpkin Carving
Contest, but we did catch the
GREAT PUMPKIN PARADE
AND COSTUME CONTEST,
judged by the worthy mayor A 1
Adreveno, Murray Randleman,
and Bill Deane at the Growers'
Association building.

A gleaming police car with two
cops half-heartedly trying to keep
straight faces led the procession
down Main Street. Following was
a small truck with a very absorbed
country sidegroup from the Half
Moon Bay High School Band, and
after them came.. .THE KIDS OF
HALF MOON BAY!
Cheered and waved on by
proud parents and grandparents
("Look, there's Billy!") most of
the under-age-ten citizenry
marched under facades of goblins,
witches, ghosts, and awful
demons. There were some
particularly scary and ugly
monsters too.
Then came the pride of the
Andreini Brothers Trucking
Compnay, their finest flatbed
tractor-trailer with a big burly
fellow at the helm (who
surreptitiously waved to friends in
the crowd), on which were loaded
the biggest, largest, most gigantic
pumpkins of Half Moon Bay—over
200 pounds—and Miss Half Moon
Bay in all her regal splendor.
And what parade would be
complete without the Ugly Witch
Herself, who cackled, cajoled, and
enticed little kids to join her
murderous troupe.
And what pumpkin festival
would be complete without a few
pumpkins to take back to the
friends? Once again, although the
biggest pumpkins were put up for
sale, the fields were open for
pumpkin picking and we came
home with a full trunkload.
Happy Halloween!

Adreveno, Murray Randleman,
and Bill Deane at the Growers'
Association building.

A gleaming police car with two
cops half-heartedly trying to keep
straight faces led the procession
down Main Street. Following was
a small truck with a very absorbed
country sidegroup from the Half
Moon Bay High School Band, and
after them came.. .THE KIDS OF
HALF MOON BAY!
Cheered and waved on by
proud parents and grandparents
("Look, there's Billy!") most of
the under-age-ten citizenry
marched under facades of goblins,
witches, ghosts, and awful
demons. There were some
particularly scary and ugly
monsters too.
Then came the pride of the
Andreini Brothers Trucking
Compnay, their finest flatbed
tractor-trailer with a big burly
fellow at the helm (who
surreptitiously waved to friends in
the crowd), on which were loaded
the biggest, largest, most gigantic
pumpkins of Half Moon Bay—over
200 pounds—and Miss Half Moon
Bay in all her regal splendor.
And what parade would be
complete without the Ugly Witch
Herself, who cackled, cajoled, and
enticed little kids to join her
murderous troupe.
And what pumpkin festival
would be complete without a few
pumpkins to take back to the
friends? Once again, although the
biggest pumpkins were put up for
sale, the fields were open for
pumpkin picking and we came
home with a full trunkload.
Happy Halloween!

GUARNERI QUARTET—The Guarneri String Quartet will give the first of their three campus concerts
this week tonight at 8 p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditorium. The quartet will perform Mozart's "Quartet in D
minor," K 421, Sibelius' "Quartet, Opus 56 'Voces Intimae,' " and Mendelssohn's "Quartet in E flat
Major," Opus 44, No. 3. Tickets are priced at $4 general and $3.25 for students, with $2 student rush
tickets going on sale 15 minutes before curtain if available. This student rush policy has been implemented
for all Public Events presentations this year. The Quartet will also give a Friday night and a Sunday
afternoon concert in Dinkelspiel.
Do you know that the firemen
still shoot off 4th-of-July
fireworks at the Oak Bluffs
(Mass.) commons? And that the
Red Lodge (Mont.) "Home of
Champions" Rodeo is still a
humdinger? And that the
Republicans still hold corn-boils
in Belvidere (111.)?
Or that Englewood (N.J.) beat
Englewood (Colo.) for the fifth
straight year in the "Keep Your
City Clean" contest? And that the
Martha's Vineyard Island (Mass.)

Bass and Mackeral Derby had a
record number of entrants this
fall? And that farmers still get
psyched for the team-pull event at
the Lower Yakima (Wash.) Valley
Junior Fair?
Well, then, you won't be at all
surprised to learn that the Old
Spanishtown Art and Pumpkin
Festival at Half Moon Bay (Calif.)
this past weekend was a
resounding success.
In the wonderfully rich
tradition of American folksy
celebrations, this little

truck-farming town between the
Pacific and the foothills of the
Santa Cruz Mountains built a
festival around their renowned
commodity—pumpkins.
Although it was highly
publicized, and Half Moon Bay has
long been known for its free fields
of pumpkins, the brisk weather
kept many outsiders from
venturing down Highway 1.
Small-Town Celebration
It was just as well. The little
kids, the town councilmen, the
Future Farmers of America, the
Half Moon Bay Growers
Association, and the Andreini
Brothers Trucking Company (to
name just a few) together created
a unique heartwarming fun-frolic
of a small-town celebration.
Certainly the most commercial
portion of the festival was the
extensive exhibit of
Northern-California arts and
crafts. All entry fees, however,
went towards the Main Street
Committee For Beautification,
and although most of the
exhibitors were conspicuously not
Half Moon Bay citizenry, the
goods at the booths were richly
pleasing and colorful.
We came too late for the Pie
Eating Contest and were a day
early for the Pumpkin Carving
Contest, but we did catch the
GREAT PUMPKIN PARADE
AND COSTUME CONTEST,
judged by the worthy mayor A 1
Adreveno, Murray Randleman,

Do you know that the firemen
still shoot off 4th-of-July
fireworks at the Oak Bluffs
(Mass.) commons? And that the
Red Lodge (Mont.) "Home of
Champions" Rodeo is still a
humdinger? And that the
Republicans still hold corn-boils
in Belvidere (111.)?
Or that Englewood (N.J.) beat
Englewood (Colo.) for the fifth
straight year in the "Keep Your
City Clean" contest? And that the
Martha's Vineyard Island (Mass.)

Bass and Mackeral Derby had a
record number of entrants this
fall? And that farmers still get
psyched for the team-pull event at
the Lower Yakima (Wash.) Valley
Junior Fair?
Well, then, you won't be at all
surprised to learn that the Old
Spanishtown Art and Pumpkin
Festival at Half Moon Bay (Calif.)
this past weekend was a
resounding success.
In the wonderfully rich
tradition of American folksy
celebrations, this little

truck-farming town between the
Pacific and the foothills of the
Santa Cruz Mountains built a
festival around their renowned
commodity—pumpkins.
Although it was highly
publicized, and Half Moon Bay has
long been known for its free fields
of pumpkins, the brisk weather
kept many outsiders from
venturing down Highway 1.
Small-Town Celebration
It was just as well. The little
kids, the town councilmen, the
Future Farmers of America, the
Half Moon Bay Growers
Association, and the Andreini
Brothers Trucking Company (to
name just a few) together created
a unique heartwarming fun-frolic
of a small-town celebration.
Certainly the most commercial
portion of the festival was the
extensive exhibit of
Northern-California arts and
crafts. All entry fees, however,
went towards the Main Street
Committee For Beautification,
and although most of the
exhibitors were conspicuously not
Half Moon Bay citizenry, the
goods at the booths were richly
pleasing and colorful.
We came too late for the Pie
Eating Contest and were a day
early for the Pumpkin Carving
Contest, but we did catch the
GREAT PUMPKIN PARADE
AND COSTUME CONTEST,
judged by the worthy mayor A 1
Adreveno, Murray Randleman,
and Bill Deane at the Growers'
Association building.

A gleaming police car with two
cops half-heartedly trying to keep
straight faces led the procession
down Main Street. Following was
a small truck with a very absorbed
country sidegroup from the Half
Moon Bay High School Band, and
after them came.. .THE KIDS OF
HALF MOON BAY!
Cheered and waved on by
proud parents and grandparents
("Look, there's Billy!") most of
the under-age-ten citizenry
marched under facades of goblins,
witches, ghosts, and awful
demons. There were some
particularly scary and ugly
monsters too.
Then came the pride of the
Andreini Brothers Trucking
Compnay, their finest flatbed
tractor-trailer with a big burly
fellow at the helm (who
surreptitiously waved to friends in
the crowd), on which were loaded
the biggest, largest, most gigantic
pumpkins of Half Moon Bay—over
200 pounds—and Miss Half Moon
Bay in all her regal splendor.
And what parade would be
complete without the Ugly Witch
Herself, who cackled, cajoled, and
enticed little kids to join her
murderous troupe.
And what pumpkin festival
would be complete without a few
pumpkins to take back to the
friends? Once again, although the
biggest pumpkins were put up for
sale, the fields were open for
pumpkin picking and we came
home with a full trunkload.
Happy Halloween!
