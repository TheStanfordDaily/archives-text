# Magic Theatre From Prague
## 
### DOUG ARTHUR 
There was magic in Berkeley's
Zellerbach Auditorium last
Saturday night. How else do you
describe a theatre where the
"props" take on an animated life
of their own, where actors,
objects, and sets appear/trans
figure/disappear in front of your
eyes, and where you remain in an
excited state of suspense
throughout the performance?
Prague's Black Light Theatre,
synthesized, is technique with an
exclusive style. Lighting consists
of black lights for the effects and
spots to highlight the action. The
company relies heavily on
recorded music. All movement is
cleverly orchestrated to the
musical score, which sets the
mood.
Pantomime wouldn't
adequately characterize the
company, although it is a silent
theatre. The volatility of the
"inanimate" objects, and the
entire mise-en-scene for that
matter, intrigued me with its
sustained artistic originality.
They're likp a gallery of Surrealist
paintings come to life.
The black light allowed the
unseen technicians to manipulate
the props and set the scene; the
eerie light also accented the vivid
colors of the costumes and
objects, and contributed to the
dreamlike atmosphere.
The evening began with a few
short skits. A washwoman's
clothes cavort on her clothesline;
a waiter's tablecloth literally
becomes a horse/motorcycle in a
delightful spoof on the western
gunfighters; a Sherlock Holmes
type runs into some big trouble
with ghosts during the night.
In a skit entitled "Dialogue,"
two characters (one dressed in a
light green suit, the other in a
bright orange one) enter and sit
on a park bench. They both have

snails in lieu of heads. One
character's snail lifts, and a
puppet letter Z comes out:
simultaneously, we hear a zzz
sound.
The other character retaliates
with a letter A. The letters quarrel
with each other. Another
character enters and conjures up
the whole alphabet, so that we
have a dialogue. In this manner,
mundane ideas become exciting
theatrical pieces.
A much longer work, "Fair of
Hands," appeared as a series of
vignettes which illustrated a
central theme that operated on a
number of symbolic levels. The
story concerns a street hawker
who sells green gloves (which
supposedly bring the wearer
happiness) at a fair. The people
who buy the gloves soon lose their
freedom and become subservient
to the hawker/politician.
The evil man is waited upon by
a dwarf who flies and. several
arms. The arms give the man a
massage, feed him dinner, and
guard his captives. One image
flows into another, and in these
surrealistic surroundings, they
seem perfectly logical.
One man refuses to wear the
glove as he values his freedom. As
the politician and dwarf can't
persuade him to wear it, they take
him by force and lock him up
(sound familiar?) in a closet. He
finally does escape and defeats the
politician. Although the captives
are freed, they soon fall victim to
a man selling hats at the
conclusion.
The piece can easily be seen as
a political parable. At one point,
the politician mumbles a speech
into a microphone. The arms
applaud wildly. If you'd just
entered the theatre you might
have flashed on Agnew addressing
the Daughters of the American
Revolution.

What make this theatre work is
the clarity of the images and the
wide variation in the subject
matter of the' vignettes. In "Fair
of Hands," they vary from a
delectable mini-puppet show with
costumed hands dancing in a
chorus line to the more somber
and menacing political
implications of the loss of
freedom.
The Black Light Theatre of
Prague was founded in 1961
The company includes
twenty members, and they have
toured more than thirty countries.
That they appeared in Berkeley to
a packed house speaks very well
for the University of California.

spots to highlight the action. The
company relies heavily on
recorded music. All movement is
cleverly orchestrated to the
musical score, which sets the
mood.
Pantomime wouldn't
adequately characterize the
company, although it is a silent
theatre. The volatility of the
"inanimate" objects, and the
entire mise-en-scene for that
matter, intrigued me with its
sustained artistic originality.
They're likp a gallery of Surrealist
paintings come to life.
The black light allowed the
unseen technicians to manipulate
the props and set the scene; the
eerie light also accented the vivid
colors of the costumes and
objects, and contributed to the
dreamlike atmosphere.
The evening began with a few
short skits. A washwoman's
clothes cavort on her clothesline;
a waiter's tablecloth literally
becomes a horse/motorcycle in a
delightful spoof on the western
gunfighters; a Sherlock Holmes
type runs into some big trouble
with ghosts during the night.
In a skit entitled "Dialogue,"
two characters (one dressed in a
light green suit, the other in a
bright orange one) enter and sit
on a park bench. They both have

snails in lieu of heads. One
character's snail lifts, and a
puppet letter Z comes out:
simultaneously, we hear a zzz
sound.
The other character retaliates
with a letter A. The letters quarrel
with each other. Another
character enters and conjures up
the whole alphabet, so that we
have a dialogue. In this manner,
mundane ideas become exciting
theatrical pieces.
A much longer work, "Fair of
Hands," appeared as a series of
vignettes which illustrated a
central theme that operated on a
number of symbolic levels. The
story concerns a street hawker
who sells green gloves (which
supposedly bring the wearer
happiness) at a fair. The people
who buy the gloves soon lose their
freedom and become subservient
to the hawker/politician.
The evil man is waited upon by
a dwarf who flies and. several
arms. The arms give the man a
massage, feed him dinner, and
guard his captives. One image
flows into another, and in these
surrealistic surroundings, they
seem perfectly logical.
One man refuses to wear the
glove as he values his freedom. As
the politician and dwarf can't
persuade him to wear it, they take
him by force and lock him up
(sound familiar?) in a closet. He
finally does escape and defeats the
politician. Although the captives
are freed, they soon fall victim to
a man selling hats at the
conclusion.
The piece can easily be seen as
a political parable. At one point,
the politician mumbles a speech
into a microphone. The arms
applaud wildly. If you'd just
entered the theatre you might
have flashed on Agnew addressing
the Daughters of the American
Revolution.

What make this theatre work is
the clarity of the images and the
wide variation in the subject
matter of the' vignettes. In "Fair
of Hands," they vary from a
delectable mini-puppet show with
costumed hands dancing in a
chorus line to the more somber
and menacing political
implications of the loss of
freedom.
The Black Light Theatre of
Prague was founded in 1961
The company includes
twenty members, and they have
toured more than thirty countries.
That they appeared in Berkeley to
a packed house speaks very well

There was magic in Berkeley's
Zellerbach Auditorium last
Saturday night. How else do you
describe a theatre where the
"props" take on an animated life
of their own, where actors,
objects, and sets appear/trans
figure/disappear in front of your
eyes, and where you remain in an
excited state of suspense
throughout the performance?
