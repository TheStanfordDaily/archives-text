# Kaplan Releases Study On Gridders And Dope

### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Stanford Law Professor John Kaplan
has released figures from a study that
shows that marijuana use among
Stanford football players is no higher
than use among undergraduates as a
whole.
He said he released the statistics to
refute the controversial Look Magazine
article authored by former gridder Tim
McClure, which Kaplan said gave
"unrealistically high" figures.
The study showed that 77 percent
of the regulars and 70 percent of the
non-regulars on the squad have tried
marijuana at least once. The figure is
estimated at 75 percent for the school

as a whole.
Between 40 and 45 percent of the
players classed themselves as "regular
users," a figure comparable with the
UC Berkeley and UCLA student bodies,
as well as Stanford.
Kaplan said he released the figures
because he was "outraged" at the
statistics quoted in the McClure article.
"I was prepared to sit on this thing.
I didn't want to hurt the football team.
But the article just claimed
unrealistically high figures. The study
shows that all you can say is that
football players are no different from
the rest of the undergraduate
population."
Kaplan said that the only difference
that the study showed between football
players and other students is that
football players and other students is
that football players are less likely to
tell their parents they have tried
marijuana.
Professor Kaplan is the author of the
controversial book, "Marijuana: The
New Prohibition." An expert in the
field of criminal law, he favors
liberalization of the current marijuana
laws.
