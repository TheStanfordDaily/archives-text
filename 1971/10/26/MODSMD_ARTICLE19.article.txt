Red China Seated
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. — The U.N. General Assembly handed the United
States a stunning defeat last night by voting to seat Red China and expel the
Chinese Nationalists.
TTie vote on the Albanian resolution was 76-35 with 17 abstentions. It put an
end to a 22-year battle over China's U.N. representation, climaxed during the past
weeks by an all-out U.S. effort to prevent the ouster of the Taiwan government.
Just before the vote the Chinese Nationalist delegation, headed by Foreign
Minister Chow Shu-kai, walked out of the blue and green assembly chamber after
Chow had announced he would not participate further.
Until the end, the United States had predicted victory. The battle was lost,
however, when the assembly defeated a U.S.-backed proposal to declare the
expulsion of China an "important question."
This would have required a two-thirds majority for expulsion of Nationalist
China. It offered the only hope for defeating the Albanian resolution.
The "important question" resolution was defeated by a vote of 55 in favor, 59
against and 15 abstaining. With only a simple majority needed, approval of the
Albanian resolution was assured since a similar proposal had received a 51-49
majority a year ago.
Thieu Orders Typhoon Aid
SAIGON — South Vietnam's government took steps yesterday to aid victims of
Typhoon Hester as officials reported 103 persons dead or missing in the wake of
the storm and described the damage as catastrophic.
President Nguyen Van Thieu, meeting in emergency session with his cabinet,
ordered $725 ,000 made available for disaster relief in the country's five northern
provinces.
Earlier in the day, Premier Tran Thien Kheim toured the stricken areas and
made on-the-spot grants of $19,000 to each province and $3,500 to Da Nang.
Government figures indicated several hundred thousand of the northern
region's three million people were at least temporarily homeless, and a spokesman

for the Social Welfare Ministry said at least $15 million would be needed for
civilian relief.

Red China Seated
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. — The U.N. General Assembly handed the United
States a stunning defeat last night by voting to seat Red China and expel the
Chinese Nationalists.
TTie vote on the Albanian resolution was 76-35 with 17 abstentions. It put an
end to a 22-year battle over China's U.N. representation, climaxed during the past
weeks by an all-out U.S. effort to prevent the ouster of the Taiwan government.
Just before the vote the Chinese Nationalist delegation, headed by Foreign
Minister Chow Shu-kai, walked out of the blue and green assembly chamber after
Chow had announced he would not participate further.
Until the end, the United States had predicted victory. The battle was lost,
however, when the assembly defeated a U.S.-backed proposal to declare the
expulsion of China an "important question."
This would have required a two-thirds majority for expulsion of Nationalist
China. It offered the only hope for defeating the Albanian resolution.
The "important question" resolution was defeated by a vote of 55 in favor, 59
against and 15 abstaining. With only a simple majority needed, approval of the
Albanian resolution was assured since a similar proposal had received a 51-49
majority a year ago.
