# Franklin Hearing
## Defense Asked To Rest Saturday 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
The Advisory Board asked
Professor Bruce Franklin yesterday to
finish his defense case by 6 p.m.
Saturday, calling that "a very
reasonable length of time." Franklin
denounced the request as "arbitrary
and dictatorial" and said, "We're not
going to accept any decision on time."
Board Chairman Donald Kennedy
told Franklin he can exceed the
Saturday limit if he presents convincing
written arguments today on the
necessity of additional witnesses in his
dismissal hearing.
In a statement issued last night,
Franklin and his co-counsels said they
cannot narrow their evidence because
the Board has repeatedly refused to
"make rulings as to the relevance of

administration testimony and the
standards which will be applied." (See
Franklin statement, 2.)
The Board also asked the
administration to report today on the
time it will need for rebuttal witnesses.
And both sides wpre told to decide
whether they wish to present closing
arguments orally or to submit written
arguments after receiving a transcript of
the case.
As the hearing went into its fifth
week, Kennedy criticized its
"uneconomical fashion." He said that
Franklin already has spent 20 hours in
direct examination of witnesses and 15
hours in cross-examination. The
administration, which has completed its
presentation of witnesses, logged 15'/2
hours of direct questioning and about 8
hours of cross-examination.
Kennedy told Franklin his case
"seems to have involved a good deal of
repetitious testimony." Franklin
stressed the case's "national
importance" and said, "We don't feel
that we should have any evidence that
is relevant to our case excluded."
Stein Testifies
In yesterday's testimony, Statistics
Professor Charles Stein said it is "very
unlikely" that police would have
clashed with demonstrators outside the
Computation Center if other professors
had joined Franklin m a discussion with
police.
Charges against Franklin include
inciting resistance to a police dispersal
order outside the computer building,
Feb. 10. Stein, who is on sabbatical at
Cornell, flew back especially to testify.
He said he has worked with Franklin

often in the anti-war movement but
sometimes disagrees with his tactics.
Stein, who was at the Computation
Center incident, said that he and
Graduate Dean Lincoln Moses "should
have gene forward with Bruce and
joined in the discussion, ard
presumably that would have calmed
things down."
Stein said that most of the
demonstrators did not disperse after
the police order and the only way to
avoid confrontation was to "try to
calm the police down."
The 51-year-old professor said he
was knocked to the ground and lost his
glasses when a policeman pushed him
while he was fleeing the police charge.
Speech 'Analytical'
Franklin is also charged with inciting
the occupation of the Computation
Center in a speech at a White Plaza rally
earlier that day. Stein said that
Franklin presented a "largely analytical
speech" about the advantages of a
campus-wide strike. He conceded that
Franklin mentioned starting the strike
at the Computation Center. But he said
that plan "had been urged by at least
three other speakers and talked about
the night before."
Under cross-examination, Stein
conceded some persons at the rally may
not have decided to go to the
Computation Center until after hearing
the speeches.
The Board heard Stein urge
protesters to "really interfere with the
war effort here at Stanford" in a tape
of a speech he made at a nighttime rally
after the Computation Center events.
Stein said he "was not aware" that the

atmosphere was inflammatory at the
time he spoke. Franklin is charged with
inciting violence in a speech made later
in the same rally.
Robert Barkan, an electrical
engineer, said he wrote a coljmn for the
Daily which first revealed that Stanford
R(«earch Institute was using the
computer for a Navy-funded
amphibious invasion simulation.
Barkan said he and two other
computer programmers investigated the
program for a week at the radical
Pacific Studies Center (PSC). He
testified the SRI program was given to
him by activist Lenny Siegel. He said,
"My understanding is that somebody
found it lying in the Computation
Center."
Barkan said he discovered the
simulation invasion involved three ships
and types of helicopters "extensively
used in Vietnam to carry troops and
artillery."
He said the SRI researcher, Andrew
Grant, had worked on earlier invasion
projects for the Army and Navy.
Barken charged the computer may
still be used for other war-related
research. He said military-oriented
industries, including Lytton Industries
and Varian of Palo Alto, are listed as
users of the computer.
Barkan insisted campus rules against
classified research are easily ignored by
de-classifying just the portion of the
project to be run on the computer.
Joel Yudkin, another electrical
engineer working at PSC, said he also
knew about the invasion program,
"Gamut-H." Yudkin said he had been

researching Stanford's complicity in the
war for a campus group called the
Inquisition.
Yudkin said he entered. the
Computation Center during its
occupation and saw some computer
tapes with SRI labels on them.
Milton Van Dyke, a professor of
Aeronautics and Astronautics, said he
checked into "Gamut-H" and found it
failed his own test of "free and open"
research. Although conceding the
project may have been officially
unclassified, Van Dyke recounted his
own extensive efforts to find out about
the program.
Van Dyke said that Grant told him

no published information was available
on "Gamut-H" because the project was
still underway. But Van Dyke said he
also found it impossible to obtain
information about Grant's earlier
projects, even using his influence as a
researcher under Air Force contract.
He said he called Provost William
Miller with the story of his
investigation and Miller said, "I think
we were fooled."
Van Dyke said he made an
"impassioned plea" that Miller publicly
acknowledge Stanford's error in
accepting the SRI contract. He said, "I
was disappointed that nothing ever
came on that."
The hearing continues today at 1
p.m. in Physics 101.
