# ASSU Senate Elections
## Voting Begins Today 
### JAN FELDMAN 
Students will have a second chance
to cast their votes today and
Wednesday ior ASSU Senatorial
candidates and fee assessment
referenda. Polls will be open from 10
a.m. to 4 p.m.
The election, originally scheduled
for last Thursday and Friday was
postponed due to procedural problems
resulting from a lack of manpower.
Elections Commissioner Alice
Furumoto said she has been "more
systematic in asking people to man
the polls this time." She has made a
special appeal to senatorial candidates
to provide workers. At a balloteer's
meeting last night, Furumoto selected a
staff of three or four people to help her
supervise the voting.
Voter Reg List
One of the problems in last week's
election was the lack of any means to
prevent students from voting more than
one time. Today and tomorrow a voter
registration list will be used.
Furumoto said that poll workers
have been instructed to honor both
blue and yellow activities stickers on
student body cards. Last week a crisis
arose when workers, not realizing that
there was a slip-up by the registrars in
September, refused to allow students
with yellow stickers to vote.
To combat electioneering at the
lolls, Furumoto has told workers to

tear down any partisan material in the
vicinity of polling places. Last week
there were several posters at the polls
condemning the fee assessment
referenda.
The ballot includes fee assessment
referenda for two campus groups.
The Minorities Affairs Commission
is requesting a $1 assessment winter
and spring terms, to be divided equally
among four student minority
organizations: Black Student Union
(BSU); Asian-American Student
Alliance; American Indian Program;
and Mecha, a Chicano student
organization.
The funds are to be used for
educational and cultural programs,
including tutoring, minority
publications, and all-University events,
as well as for the general maintenance
and support of the various groups.
Students will also vote on a $1
winter term assessment for the
Children's Center of the Stanford
Community.
Need Equipment
Harold Spitzer, a member of the
Center's board of directors, explained
the Center's need for equipment and a
more stabilized, professional staff. In
the past the Child Care Center has
relied primarily on volunteer help, so
that the main educational burden has
been placed upon the few full-time
teachers.

The Child Care Center and the
minority organizations have both been
defending their assessment requests
against attacks from the Stanford
Student Voluntarists and others who
feel that their programs should not be
student funded.
Results of the referenda vote should
be announced Thursday, Furumoto
said. Winners of the Senatorial election
will be announced later, since those
ballots must be counted by computer.

and Mecha, a Chicano student
organization.
The funds are to be used for
educational and cultural programs,
including tutoring, minority
publications, and all-University events,
as well as for the general maintenance
and support of the various groups.
Students will also vote on a $1
winter term assessment for the
Children's Center of the Stanford
Community.
Need Equipment
Harold Spitzer, a member of the
Center's board of directors, explained
the Center's need for equipment and a
more stabilized, professional staff. In
the past the Child Care Center has
relied primarily on volunteer help, so
that the main educational burden has
been placed upon the few full-time
teachers.

The Child Care Center and the
minority organizations have both been
defending their assessment requests
against attacks from the Stanford
Student Voluntarists and others who
feel that their programs should not be
student funded.
Results of the referenda vote should
be announced Thursday, Furumoto
said. Winners of the Senatorial election
will be announced later, since those
ballots must be counted by computer.
Students will have a second chance
to cast their votes today and
Wednesday ior ASSU Senatorial
candidates and fee assessment
referenda. Polls will be open from 10
a.m. to 4 p.m.
The election, originally scheduled
for last Thursday and Friday was
postponed due to procedural problems
resulting from a lack of manpower.
Elections Commissioner Alice
Furumoto said she has been "more
systematic in asking people to man
the polls this time." She has made a
special appeal to senatorial candidates
to provide workers. At a balloteer's
meeting last night, Furumoto selected a
staff of three or four people to help her
supervise the voting.
Voter Reg List
One of the problems in last week's
election was the lack of any means to
prevent students from voting more than
one time. Today and tomorrow a voter
registration list will be used.
Furumoto said that poll workers
have been instructed to honor both
blue and yellow activities stickers on
student body cards. Last week a crisis
arose when workers, not realizing that
there was a slip-up by the registrars in
September, refused to allow students
with yellow stickers to vote.
To combat electioneering at the
lolls, Furumoto has told workers to

tear down any partisan material in the
vicinity of polling places. Last week
there were several posters at the polls
condemning the fee assessment
referenda.
The ballot includes fee assessment
referenda for two campus groups.
The Minorities Affairs Commission
is requesting a $1 assessment winter
and spring terms, to be divided equally
among four student minority
organizations: Black Student Union
(BSU); Asian-American Student
Alliance; American Indian Program;
and Mecha, a Chicano student
organization.
The funds are to be used for
educational and cultural programs,
including tutoring, minority
publications, and all-University events,
as well as for the general maintenance
and support of the various groups.
