# Jewish Group Petitions Trustees

### ROBERT VINING 
Members of the Stanford Jewish community are
petitioning the Board of Trustees to act on certain
University policies which they say "adversely affect
our observance andpracticeof Judaism."
The petition, which appeared in last Friday's
Daily, notes that this year classes began on Yom
Kippur, "the holiest day of the year." It charges that
Stanford's quarter system is "built around the
observance of major Christian holidays such as
Christmas and Easter."
The petitioners are urging the Trustees to assure
that registration and the first two days of classes will
not be scheduled in conflict with the Jewish holidays
of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. They also are
asking the use of more suitable facilities for Jewish
religious services, and aie requesting a hearing before
the Trustees.
This past September, Yom Kippur services were
held in the Women's Clubhouse, a small auditorium in
the Old Union which seats 200.
Trustee Order
A 1966 Trustees order designates the Clubhouse
and Memorial Church as the only places on campus
where sectarian religious services may be held. The
large Memorial Church is considered unsatisfactory
for Jewish services because of its elaborately Christian
design.
In 1902, Mrs. Leland Stanford amended the
Founding Grant so as to prohibit sectarian religious
services at the University. On February 17, 1966, the
Board of Trustees declared that sectarian services
would be permitted but could be held only in
Memorial Church. In Julv of that same year the

Trustees moved to allow sectarian services in the
Women's Clubhouse for a probationary period of one
year. After the trial period the arrangement was
continued.
According to David Axelrad, a senior in Religious
Studies who helped draft the petition, concerned
Jewish students met with University Ombudswoman
Lois Amsterdam on October 11th. After hearing their
grievances, Mrs. Amsterdam suggested that the
students send a petition to her and the Trustees.
Axelrad said that while last year's registration was
during part of the two-day Jewish holiday Rosh
Hashanah, the conflict was "particularly acute this
year" since it involved Yom Kippur.
Already Investigating
William Stone, an assistant to the President, stated
that before the petition was written the scheduling
problem already had been referred to a subcommittee
of the Committee on Academic Appraisal and
Achievement. Stone explained that a member of the
university's legal staff is investigating the language of
the 1966 Trustees resolutions on facilities for
sectarian services. The findings should be known
within a week or two, Stone said.
The subcommittee on Academic Standing,
Petitions and Exceptions, formerly the Registrar's
Advisory Committee, has also examined the
scheduling problem. At its October 14th meeting the
subcommittee decided the problem should be
handled by taking steps to make students and faculty
aware that on religious holidays they are free to miss
classes or registration without penalty. The steps
would include mailing information to new students,
and insuring that faculty advisors notify their advisees
of the policy.

Subcommittee Chairwoman Mary Sunseri,
Associate Professor of Mathematics, explained that
Yom Kippur and Rosh Hashanah are "moving
holidays," falling on different dates from year to
year. Mrs. Sunseri said the subcommittee felt
rearrangement 01 the University calendar might
accidentally result in once again rescheduling
registration or the first day of classes in conflict with
the Jewish holidays.
Not Adequate
"I don't think this is an adequate solution." said
Rabbi Charles Familant, Stanford Hillel director. He
observed that there are tables which list the dates
when the holidays will fall many years from now.
"Certainly they can be aware of these dates," the
Rabbi added. He said the subcommittee's decision
makes a meeting with the Trustees even more
important now.
Familant said he received calls from a secretary in
the President's Office approximately one week before
the petition was published. The secretary questioned
Familant about what sort of facilities would be
needed for the Jewish services.
University Vice-Provost Robert Rosenzweig
explained that while the matter of using facilities for
sectarian worship does fall within the jurisdiction of
the Trustees, matters of scheduling are "not inside
the province of the Board ordinarily."' The
administration and faculty have authority over the
schedule. If the Board were petitioned in regard to
the University calendar, Rosenzweig said, "they
would look to the President for advice on what to
do."
