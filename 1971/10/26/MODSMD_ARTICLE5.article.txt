# Ferd Firko & The Midterm Clunks
## 
### 
It's midterm panic time for
Ferd Firko, mild-mannered
frosh lad, as he bangs his
empty head slowly and
decisively against the metal rim
of his army surplus desk.
Clunk, clunk, clunk. What
an interesting sound, young
Firko thinks to himself. And
what a fine way to pass an
evening. Maybe I could transfer
to SC. Clunk.
Piles of textbooks threaten
to collapse on the early
laurelled head of the future
flunk-out. The bio series, the
chem series, the math 10
series, lie before him like a
land of dreams, not to mention
a five page essay on "A Friend
of Mine"—any friend,
double-spaced, margins at 15
and 85, colorful details. Don't
forget the name this time,
Jerko Firko.
A ghostly voice echoes in
his cauliflower ear. "Well son,
pre-med is a lot of work."
That's all right, Dad. I'm a
superstudent, remember?
Remember? Yeah. Never have
to study, just play frisbee and
football and volleyball and sit
in the halls talking about
frisbee and football and
volleyball and beer and girls.
"Dr. Firko, Dr. Firko, the
world famous superstar in room
210 is differentiating internally
and his angiosperm count is

halogenated. You must save
him, Dr. Firko."
"Don't worry, Nurse
Simmons. Go out to the right
ten steps and then cut left. We
may have to operate."

"Oh, Dr. Firko, you're a
genius!"
"Superstudent, Nurse
Simmons. Mmmmmmm ... That
will be all."
Clunk.
Crash. Out in some better
world Ferd's dormies are
playing frisbee with the hall
lights and the score is 1-0 for
the home team.
"Hey Firko, where are you
when we need you? Watcha
doon in there, heh boy, heh
heh. Wuzzat funny sound?"
"Well watcha doon out
there, heh?"
"Just playing frisbee, watcha
think?"
"Where's your chickie, Joe?
Heh? Where's your chickie?
Locked in the kitchenette with
the Mad Rapist heh heh."
That shut him up. Art
history majors, what do they
know about life anyhow?
Coacervate polymerization. Nor
certitude, nor peace, nor help
for pain. Gotta study that bio,
get into med school. Pull
yourself together, Ferd. Head
up. Open book. Drop book.
"Hey Firko."
"Leave me alone, Joe. I'm
studying."

"Hey Firko, who is this
Mad Rapist?"
"I hear he's a fifth year
senior in art history from
Fresno. Lives in Toyon."

"Gee, locked in the
kitchenette with my chickie."
"Sorry about that Joe, but I
gotta study." Yes sir. certainly
do have to study, Gonna pick
up that book and—well I can't
study on an empty stomach.
Army marches on
its .. . Ignorant armies. Get a
Jack LaLanne's Hi-Protein bar
and a Coke from the machine.

And then write that letter
to Great Aunt Iris in North
Fork. Not much for an old
lady to do in North Fork,
South Dakota; a letter would
really cheer her up. "Dear
Aunt Iris, I hope you are fine.
The weather here is fine. Mr
classes are . .
And then go to the post
office, see if I have any third
class mail, find out if Mem
Claw is turned off at night.
Funny names they have around
here. Wonder who "Mem" was.
Must have given a lot of
money.
Yeah, and I really ought to
test my new glow-in-the-dark
yoyo, and pace out the
distance around UGLY to see
which way is shorter. Maybe I
could check out the bridge
game in the lounge for a few
minutes.
"Hey Firko. Wanna play a

few hands of bridge?"
"Well, maybe one or two. I
really gotta study. I got these
midterms."
"Dr. Firko, Dr. Firko, the
voluptuous young blonde with
the incurable heart disease is
pulling trumps!"
"Give her a break, Nurse.
And then you pour yourself a
good strong cup of coffee. It's
going to be a long night."
"Oh, Dr. Firko, you're so
wonderful."
"Please, Nurse Simmons. Not
here."
Just a few hands. Just
gonna play a few hands for a
few minutes. Really gotta
study.
"One heart."
"One club."
Clunk.
"Hey watcha doon, Ferd?"
Clunk, clunk, clunk.


"You know—like Attica, or Kent State, or. . . "
