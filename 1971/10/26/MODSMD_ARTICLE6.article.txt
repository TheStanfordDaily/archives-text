# a 						third world perspective
## Overseas Programme Criticism 
### 
To individuals who either
represent or sympathize with
the views of the Third World,
Stanford's Overseas Study
Programme appears
anachronistic. The programme
has a very limited focus in its
cultural content. The stated
aim of the programme is to
"make it possible for every
student who wishes to do so
to have an introduction to life
in a foreign environment and
culture." Yet the range of
foreign "culture" is strictly
limited to the European
"metropole", with the
exception of minor programmes
in Mexico and Taiwan.
There is very little in the
programme for an individual
with a somewhat broader range
of cultural interests. The
programme as presently
operated neglects the diverse
cultures of over four-fifths of
humanity, namely, Asia, Africa,
Latin America and the
Caribbean. This oversight
further demonstrates, in
appearance, a disinterested view
regarding the cultural origins of
the colonised Afro-American
populations of the US. One
might be led to conclude that,
at best, the programme only
fails to alleviate the potential
cultural-myopia of Stanford
students in respect of a large
part of the world. At worst,
one might conclude that the
programme in fact promotes
the arrogant and mistaken
notion of the superiority of
Western Metropolitan culture.
But that is not all. What
one might regard as the
"travel-poster" orientation of
the existing programme is a
further rub. The general and
travel-oriented nature of the
programme dissuades certain
serious students from
involvement. Returning students
complain of the lack of

intensive involvement overseas,
and of opportunities for
in-depth exposure beyond the
Stanford compound.
For many members of the
Third World, education is a
very serious matter. It is not
at all a frivolity, but rather is
seen as a key to the life or
death of large sectors of the
populations. The tenor of this
point may seem overly
moralistic to some; but in the
Third World issues of equity
and appropriateness of priorities
are of serious matters. The
declining interest in the existing
overseas programme is a strong
indication that the present
generation of Stanford
undergraduates are sensitive to
these issues.
Stanford's Overseas Study
Programme does not presently

provide the opportunity for
serious involvement necessary to
gain more than a superficial
impression of a culture.
Moreover, one can indeed raise
the question whether the
overseas programme provides
students an adequate
opportunity to gain experience
outside of the Western
Metropolitan tradition. It is my
belief that substantial numbers
of Stanford undergraduates as
well as graduate students would
like to see the affirmative
action of the University in
promoting academic relations
with Third World Nations.
The structure of any new
programmes, however, sftould
diverge considerably from the
present European programme.
In order to assure a maximum
opportunity for overseas

involvement, the programme
should be operated within the
structure of the existing
universities of Asia, Africa,
Latin America and the
Caribbean. It should be
structured as an exchange
programme, with emphasis on
specialised study and directed
independent study wherever
possible. In a world sensitive to
neo-colonialism, it is essential
that all direction be undertaken
by overseas institutions. In
return, those interested
institutions might perhaps send
students for study in such
capital intensive areas as
engineering and medicine, or
they might use the funds
provided by Stanford students
for expansion of their own
campuses.
These are some ideas which

of course require the appraisal
of the students who might be
interested in participation. The
Committee on Foreign Study
Programmes is composed of
individuals who are vitally
interested in providing a
programme which is responsive
to the changing needs of
students. It is up to us, the
students, to articulate our
needs.
I urge all interested students,
and particularly representatives
of minority groups, to attend
the meeting tomorrow at 4:30
p.m. in the Tressider Large
Lounge.
