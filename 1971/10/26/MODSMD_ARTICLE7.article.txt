Editor, THE DAILY:
We were dismayed to read Law
School Dean Thomas Ehrlich's
statement that "We are proud and
happy that one of our alumni
(William Rehnquist) has been
nominated to the Supreme Court
of the United States."
It is hardly clear to whom
"we" refers in that statement, but
the undersigned officers of the
Stanford Law Association
(speaking only for ourselves) are
neither proud nor happy, nor even
overwhelmed with gratitude for
the President's decision not to
nominate total incompetents.
What is relevant in responding
to the prospect of William
Rehnquist on the Supreme Court
is what he stands for, not what
law school he graduated from.
Rehnquist is known for his claims

of unrestrained government
wiretapping power in "national
security" cases, his reported
advocacy of the illegal May Day
mass arrests in Washington, his
association with the dismissal of
federal civil rights lawyers who
fought for a strong school
desegregation policy, and his role
in helping make the D.C. Crime
Bill a national model for the
repression of suspects' rights. This
history hardly bodes well for his
influence on the rule of law in this
country.
Dean Ehrlich and most of his
colleagues on the law school
faculty should be congratulated
for issuing a letter opposing the
candidacies of the six men and
women earlier named as possible
nominees. In doing so, those
faculty members apparently

overcame their reticence about
using their prestige to influence
political-legal issues, reticence that
has prevented so much as a public
murmur about the illegality of the
Indochina War.
We hope that those law
professors who find Rehnquist's
views on law unacceptable realize
that there is no reason for them to
again recede into passive
acceptance when nominees are
unsuitable, not because they will
write mediocre opinions, but
because they will make bad
decisions. Certainly Mr. Nixon has
rejected the naive myth that a
Justice is to be chosen on the
basis of his ability and integrity

without regard to his views, and
there is no reason why the Senate,
or influential members of the
public, need pretend otherwise.
It is clear that the Supreme
Court writes law and makes
policy. Since that power is always
in the hands of a five-man
majority, the policy views of both
prospective appointees deserve as
much scrutiny as their technical
abilities. We hope that further
statements which appear to
express the views of the law
school community will contribute
to that scrutiny.

mass arrests in Washington, his
association with the dismissal of
federal civil rights lawyers who
fought for a strong school
desegregation policy, and his role
in helping make the D.C. Crime
Bill a national model for the
repression of suspects' rights. This
history hardly bodes well for his
influence on the rule of law in this
country.
Dean Ehrlich and most of his
colleagues on the law school
faculty should be congratulated
for issuing a letter opposing the
candidacies of the six men and
women earlier named as possible
nominees. In doing so, those
faculty members apparently

overcame their reticence about
using their prestige to influence
political-legal issues, reticence that
has prevented so much as a public
murmur about the illegality of the
Indochina War.
We hope that those law
professors who find Rehnquist's
views on law unacceptable realize
that there is no reason for them to
again recede into passive
acceptance when nominees are
unsuitable, not because they will
write mediocre opinions, but
because they will make bad
decisions. Certainly Mr. Nixon has
rejected the naive myth that a
Justice is to be chosen on the
basis of his ability and integrity

without regard to his views, and
there is no reason why the Senate,
or influential members of the
public, need pretend otherwise.
It is clear that the Supreme
Court writes law and makes
policy. Since that power is always
in the hands of a five-man
majority, the policy views of both
prospective appointees deserve as
much scrutiny as their technical
abilities. We hope that further
statements which appear to
express the views of the law
school community will contribute
to that scrutiny.

Editor, THE DAILY:
We were dismayed to read Law
School Dean Thomas Ehrlich's
statement that "We are proud and
happy that one of our alumni
(William Rehnquist) has been
nominated to the Supreme Court
of the United States."
It is hardly clear to whom
"we" refers in that statement, but
the undersigned officers of the
Stanford Law Association
(speaking only for ourselves) are
neither proud nor happy, nor even
overwhelmed with gratitude for
the President's decision not to
nominate total incompetents.
What is relevant in responding
to the prospect of William
Rehnquist on the Supreme Court
is what he stands for, not what
law school he graduated from.
Rehnquist is known for his claims

of unrestrained government
wiretapping power in "national
security" cases, his reported
advocacy of the illegal May Day
mass arrests in Washington, his
association with the dismissal of
federal civil rights lawyers who
fought for a strong school
desegregation policy, and his role
in helping make the D.C. Crime
Bill a national model for the
repression of suspects' rights. This
history hardly bodes well for his
influence on the rule of law in this
country.
Dean Ehrlich and most of his
colleagues on the law school
