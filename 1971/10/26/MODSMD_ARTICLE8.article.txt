# Franklin Defense Statement
## 
### 
(This is the release by the
Franklin Defense responding to
the Advisory Board's ruling
limiting defense time.)
The Advisory Board has
demanded that Bruce Franklin
finish his presentation of
witnesses by Saturday at 6 p.m.
We think that this limitation,
coming in the middle of our
defense, is extremely unfair and
totally unacceptable. The
administration faced no such
restriction. We refuse to accept
any time limitation.
We have asked repeatedly that
the Board make rulings as to the
relevance of administration
testimony and the standards
which will be applied. We have
not received such rulings. In their
absence, we must continue with
the presentation of our case until
we have presented "strongly
persuasive evidence" that all of
the charges against Bruce are false.
Among the obstacles which
prevent us from clearly defining
our case are these:
1. The administration's case is
such a hodge-podge of trivial
detail and substantial charges that
we can't tell what is important
and what is not. For example:
Must we show conclusively that

Bruce did not engage in a
"huddle" with twelve people
outside the Computation Center?
2. How many witnesses must
we present to disprove each casual
assertion of the administration's
witnesses? The Board found the
Lodge defense repetitious. Why?
How many witnesses should we
have used? How many defense
witnesses equal Bob Beyers?
3. Much of the
administration's case depends on
conclusions of their witnesses
about the moods of various
crowds. Must we disprove these
conclusions? If so, we must
obviously produce many witnesses
with different attitudes and
perceptions of these events.
We are probably more anxious
than the Board to be done with
this case. However, we have an
obligation to Bruce Franklin, to
teachers in universities throughout
the country, to the anti-war
movement, and to the
revolutionary movement to
present a defense which convinces
the Board and the Stanford
community that the charges
against Franklin are false and part
of an attempt to escalate
repression. We will do our best to
do so.
