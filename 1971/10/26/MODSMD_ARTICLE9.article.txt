## Socialization Of The Sex-Role Ideology 
### 
Second In A Series
The dominant values of today's
students concern personal growth
on the one hand, and
interpersonal relationships on the
other. The first of these
emphasizes individuality and
self-fulfillment; the second
stresses openness, honesty, and
equality in all human
relationships.
The values of individuality and
self-fulfillment imply that each
human being, male or female, is to
be encouraged to "do his own
thing." Men and women are no
longer to be stereotyped by
society's definitions. If sensitivity,
emotionality, and warmth are
desirable human characteristics,
then they are desirable for men as
well as for women. (John Wayne
is no longer an idol of the young,
but their pop-art satire.) If
independence, assertiveness, and
serious intellectual commitment

are desirable human
characteristics, then they are
desirable for women as well as for
men. The major prescription of
this college generation is that each
individual should be encouraged
to discover and fulfill his own
unique potential and identity,
unfettered by society's
presumptions.
But society's presumptions
enter the scene much earlier than
most people suspect, for parents
begin to raise their children in
accord with the popular
stereotypes from the very first.
Boys are encouraged to be
aggressive, competitive, and
independent, whereas girls are
rewarded for being passive and
dependent (Barry, Bacon, &
Child, 1957; Sears, Maccoby, &
Levin, 1957). In one study,
six-month-old infant girls were
already being touched and spoken
to more bv their mothers while

they were playing than were
infant boys. When they were
thirteen months old, these same
girls were more reluctant than the
boys to leave their mothers; they
returned more quickly and more
frequently to them; and they
remained closer to them
throughout the entire play period.
When a physical barrier was
placed between mother and child,
the girls tended to cry and motion
for help; the boys made more
active attempts to get around the
barrier (Goldberg & Lewis, 1969).
No one knows to what extent
these sex differences at the age of
thirteen months can be attributed
to the mothers' behavior at the
age of six months, but it is hard to
believe that the two are
unconnected.
As children grow older, more
explicit sex-role training is
introduced. Boys are encouraged
to take more of an interest in

mathematics and science. Boys,
not girls, are given chemistry sets
and microscopes for Christmas.
Moreover, all children quickly
learn that mommy is proud to be
a moron when it comes to
mathematics and science, whereas
daddy knows all abut these things.
When a young boys return.,
from school all excited about
biology, he is almost certain to be
encouraged to think of becoming
a physician. A girl with similar
enthusiasm is told that she might
want to consider nurse's training
later so she can have "an
interesting job to fall back upon
in case—God forbid—she ever
needs to support herself." A very
different kind of encouragement.
And any girl who doggedly
persists in her enthusiasm for
science is likely to find her
parents as horrified by the
prospect of a permanent love

affair with physics as they would
be by the prospect of an
interracial marriage.
These socialization practices
quickly take their toll. By nursery
school age, for example, boys are
already asking more questions
about how and why things work
(Smith, 1933). In first and second
grade, when asked to suggest ways
of improving various toys, boys
do better on the fire truck and
girls do better on the nurse's kit,
but by the third grade, boys do
better regardless of the toy
presented (Torrance, 1962).
By the ninth grade, 25% of the
boys, but only 3% of the girls, are
considering careers in science or
engineering (Flanagan,
unpublished; cited by Kagan,
1964). When they apply for
college, boys and girls are about
equal on verbal aptitude tests, but
boys score significantly higher on
mathematical aptitude
tests—about 60 points higher on
the College Board examinations,
for example (Brown, 1965, p.
162). Moreover, girls improve
their mathematical performance if
problems are ' reworded so that
they deal with cooking and
gardening, even though the
abstract reasoning required for
their solutions remains the same
(Milton, 1958). Clearly, not just
ability, but the motivation and
confidence to tackle a
mathematical problem have been
undermined.
But these effects in
mathematics and science are only
part of the story. A girl's long
training in passivity and
dependence appears to exact ar

even higher toll lrom her overall
motivation to achieve, to search
for new and independent ways of
doing things, and to welcome the
challenge of new and unsolved
problems. In one study, for
example, elementary school girls
were more likely to try solving a
puzzle by imitating an adult,
whereas the boys were more likely
to search for a novel solution not
provided by the adult (McDavid,
1959).
In another puzzle-solving
study, young girls asked for help
and approval from adults more
frequently than the boys; and,
when given the opportunity to
return to the puzzles a second
time, the girls were more likely to
rework those they had already
solved, whereas the boys were
more likely to try puzzles they
had been unable to solve
previously (Crandall & Rabson,
1960). A girl's sigh of relief is
almost audible when she marries
and retires from the outside world
of novel and unsolved problems.
This, of course, is the most
conspicuous outcome of all: the
majority of American women
become full-time homemakers.
And of those who work, 78% end
up in dead-end jobs as clerical
workers, service workers, factory
workers, and sales clerks. Only
15% of all women workers are
classified by the Labor
Department as professional or
technical workers, and even this
figure is misleading. For the
poorly paid occupation of
non-college teacher absorbs nearly
half of these women, and an
additional 25% are nurses. Fewer
than 5% of all professional
women— fewer than 1% of all
women workers—fill those
positions which, to most
Americans, connote
"professional": physician, lawyer,
engineer, scientist, college
professor, journalist, and the like.
Such are the consequences of a

nonconscious ideology.
But why does this process
violate the values of individuality
and self-fulfillment? It is not
because some people may regard
the role of homemaker as inferior
to other roles. That is not the
point. Rather, the point is that
our society is managing to consign
a large segment of its population
to the role of homemaker-either
by itself or in conjunction with
typing teaching, nursing, or
unskilled as inexorably
as it has in the past consigned the
individual with a black skin to the
role of janitor or domestic. It is
not the quality of the role which
is at issue here, but the fact that
in spite of their unique identities,
the majority of America's women
end up in the same role.
Even an I.Q. in the genius
range does not guarantee that a
woman's unique potential will
find expression. In a famous study
of over 1300 men and women
whose I.Q.'s averaged 151
(Terman & Oden, 1959), 86% of
the men have achieved
prominence in professinal and
managerial occupations. In
contrast, only a minority of the
women are even employed. Of
those who are, 37% are nurses,
librarians, social workers, and
no n-college teachers. An
additional 25% are secretaries,
stenographers, bookkeepers, and
office workers! Only 11% are in
the higher professions of law,
medicine, college teaching,
engineering, science, economics,
and the like. And even at age 44,
well after their children have gone
to school, 61% of these highly
gifted women are full-time
homemakers. This
homogenization of America's
women is the minor consequence
of our society's sex-role ideology.
Tomorrow: Free will, biology
and complementarity.
