The Ad hoc Nominating Committee of the
Committee on Foreign Study Programs is
accepting nominations of students to serve on
subcommittees for each of the five Overseas
Campuses. Interested students should pick up
applications in the Overseas Campuses Office,
Room 112, Old Union, and return them
before 4:30 p.m., Wednesday, October 27.
REWARD,
MAYBE
Starting October 18, look around for somebody wearing
a pair of Levi's with a PSA patch on the seat.
That's your PSA Campus Rep, who'll give you an entry
blank for our big Levi's drawing. Send it in by midnight,
November 1. The winner gets 12 pairs of Levi's (without
patches).
That should set you up for life unless you've got 24 legs.
And even if you don't win, you'll know who can get you a
PSA reservation next time you want one.

Starting October 18, look around for somebody wearing
a pair of Levi's with a PSA patch on the seat.
That's your PSA Campus Rep, who'll give you an entry
blank for our big Levi's drawing. Send it in by midnight,
November 1. The winner gets 12 pairs of Levi's (without
patches).
That should set you up for life unless you've got 24 legs.
And even if you don't win, you'll know who can get you a
PSA reservation next time you want one.
