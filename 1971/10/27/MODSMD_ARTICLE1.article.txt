# Rose Discusses Optical Research

### BOB BACON 
"It's a minor side issue to us that this research can
be used in regard to the atom bomb," says Dr.
Heinrich W. Rose, the Stanford opthalmologist who
has come under sharp criticism recently for his Air
Force-sponsored research contract.
Rose is conducting a research project dealing with
the amount of light necessary to cause damage to i,he
human eye which has been criticized because the Air
Force plans to use the results "to provide combat
aircrews with eye protection from nuclear
detonations."
Rose, Senior Scientist in the opthalmology
division of the Department of Surgery, told the Daily
that photocoagulation laser apparatus of the type to
be used in the project is used regularly at Stanford
Hospital in treatment of patients with detached
retinas. Clinic patients are exposed to much more
light than the experimental subjects will be, Rose
stressed.
The light source to be used in the experiments is
commercially available and is used in television
studios, he added.
Retinal Damage
The gist of his work in the controversial program is
to determine "how much light causes eye damage,"
he said; the research contract itself says that "the
objective of this contract is to obtain retinal damage
thresholds for human eyes."

The contract states that the Air Force's overall
objective "is to provide combat aircrews with eye
protection from nuclear detonations." Rose said that
"this is a minor side issue to us; it's a major part of
the project for the Air Force ... we have clinical
aspects; they have their aspects."
Rose said, "the work is meant to benefit many
people other than soldiers; that's why it will be
published .... If my work has any benefit, it will
benefit civilians vastly more than soldiers."
He cited the clinical uses of the information he
seeks, and the importance of protection of civilians in
case of nuclear explosions.
Rose stressed the fact that his study deals only
with light, and not with X-rays, gamma rays, and
other types of radiation produced by atomic bombs.
"It's strictly visible light that I'm concerned with," he
said.
German Air Force
The German-born physician stated that during his
six years as a flight surgeon in the German Air Force
(1939-45 ) he did research on depth perception and
night vision, and that "any human experimentation
we did was done on ourselves, the people in the lab."
He stressed that his background in Germany was
thoroughly investigated before he began work for the
United States Air Force, and that American officials
pronounced it "perfectly clean; it can be openly
discussed and hashed over."

In discussing his work with the effects of atomic
explosions, Rose said "I'm completely certain I've
spent vastly more time on protecting the eye from
splinters and sunlight (such as that encountered when
landing an aircraft), than on protecting the eye from
the atomic bomb.
"I'm more interested in color vision and depth
perception than in any aggressive things."
He stated his belief that an atomic bomb would
present eye danger to many more civilians than
soldiers.
"I was not hired by the U.S. Air Force for
purposes of the atom bomb. I was brought to the
United States for work in aerospace medicine, a field
in which Germany was more advanced," Rose said.
His interest in the effects of atomic explosions on
the eye began shortly after the first atomic bombs
were used, while he was still in Germany but
employed by the U.S. military.
At that time, he said, he had compiled a long
history of research concerning protection of the eye
from hazards, both excessive light and foreign bodies.
As noted in Monday's Daily, Rose participated in
studies conducted at the Atomic Energy
Commission's Nevada Test Center dealing with the
effects of atomic fireballs on animal eyes.
Rose unconditionally denied the charge made by
"Young Crow" Peter Knutson in Friday's Daily that

THE EYES HAVE IT—Dr. Heinrich Rose defended his controversial eye research
in an interview with the Daily yesterday. Rose claimed that his research has many
civilian uses.
he was brought to the United States to work on atomic
projects at Los Alamos, New Mexico. "I have never been at
Los Alamos; there are no 'ifs' or 'whens' about it," Rose
said Monday. "I have never worked for the Atomic Energy
Commission ... I'm a physician, not a physicist."
Rose was accompanied during the Daily interview at his
personal request by Dr. Angelos Dellaporta, Chief of
Opthalmology at the Medical Center; and Robert Lindee,
Assistant to the Vice-President for Medical Affairs.
Lindee said that the decision to place a guard at Rose's
office was an administrative one, and was not made at
Rose's request. The guard was placed there after Rose
received a threatening telephone call last Thursday.
During the interview, Rose blasted the "hostile attitude
toward science which makes the innocent look sinister."
As noted in Monday's Daily, no suitable experimental
subjects have been found for the study; hence, no work has
been performed on humans.

The research contract states that "any and all treatments
and observations involving human subjects in connection
with this contract shall be carried out within the limits of
the accepted code of ethics of the American medical
profession for clinical and laboratory investigations."
If human subjects are found for the project, the
experimental exposures will be conducted by Dr. H.
Christian Zweng, Palo Alto opthalmologist and Clinical
Associate Professor at the Medical Center.
The "Young Crows," under whose auspices Knutson's
original column was published, are a campus organization
which actively opposes military-sponsored research projects
at Stanford.
"The use of light in treatment, rather than eye surgery,
is one of the great advances of the last decade in medicine,"
according to Rose and Dellaporta. This technique utilizes
the same type of apparatus as will be used in Rose's Air
Force research program.
