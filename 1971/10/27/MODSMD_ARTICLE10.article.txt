# Scientists Test Cell Sorter
## 
### 
A unique new instrument to
separate living cells on the basis of
their fluorescence has been
developed by a team of scientists
here.
This sorting mechanism may
open the door for new research
and clinical study of treatment of
diseases in man, as well as a better
understanding of the body's
immune system.
The cell separator utilizes
photoelectric observation of
fluorescence in cells in a liquid
stream as the criterion for
separation.

The instrument has been
developed and clinically tested by
a team that includes Dr. Leonard
A. Herzenberg, professor of
genetics; Dr. H. Russel Hulett,
research associate in genetics; Dr.
Paul L. Wolf, associate professor
of pathology and director of
clinical laboratories at the
University Hospital; and engineers
William A. Banner and Richard G.
Sweet of the genetics'
instrumentation research
laboratory.
Previous bulk fractionation
methods—such as centrifugation,
separation columns, and

electrophoresis—allow sorting of
large numbers of cells, but
produce only limited resolution of
functionally different types. The
Stanford cell separator is unique
in that various parameters or
criteria may be used as the basis
for making cells fluorescent, and
thus separating them from the
others in the stream.
"The net result of this," Hulett
said, "is that we can take cells we
want to look at or use
experimentally and separate them
from the rest of the cells in a
general population.
"The system has proved
capable of providing fractions
containing large numbers of cells
highly enriched in a particular
functional type."
The cell separator enables
scientists to separate specific
antibody-producing cells from a
general population, identify their
chemical and biological
characteristics, and determine the
types of cells involved in antibody
production.
If scientists can discover more
about how antibodies are made,
Herzenberg said, it could lead to
the possible prevention of organ
transplant rejection and more
effective treatment of diseases
such as leukemia and hemophilia.
