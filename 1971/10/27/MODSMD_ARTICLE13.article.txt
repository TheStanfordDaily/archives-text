### 
Would you like to do some
macrobiotic cooking or join a hair
cutting co-op but don't know
anyone who is into the same
thing?
Hark, your problems will be
over with the publication of
"People Need People," an idea
sheet designed for "individuals
who want to get together for
some love and/or intellectual
non-profit activity," says Jane
Huseby, SCIRE Director.
The publication, available
tomorrow alongside the Daily,
aims to be a medium for
individuals to communicate their

ideas and interests on a person to
person basis.
Although the first issue
contains many offerings from
volunteer groups, everyone is
welcome to submit their
criticisms, opinions, and ideas on
the project," says Huseby. Call
Dolores at extension 2733.
Tomorrow you will find
requests for gardening and
nutrition advisers and a bid to
begin organization of an old
fashioned Christmas bazaar with
rent-a-kid booth.
If "People Need People" is
well-received, it will become a
bi-monthly column in the Daily.
