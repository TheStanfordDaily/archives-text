# 'The Devils'
## Russell's Most Exciting Film 
### TODD McCARTHY 
Ken Russell's "The Devils"
could have been the most
objectionable experience of the
year, what with tongue
puncturing, wasp torture, leg
crushing, burning at the stake and
Vanessa Redgrave playing a
sexually obsessed hunchback nun.
After the considerable success,
both artistic and commercial, of
"Women in Love," Russell was in
a position to write his own ticket,
the first result of which was the
frenzied "The Music Lovers."
Despite a number of startling
sequences, that film scrupulously
avoided any deep psychological
probing into Tchaikovsky.
Russell's excesses are both
exhilarating and embarassing and
though they overflow into "The
Devils," Russell has at the same
time exercised admirable artistic
self-discipline. Despite the
ghastliness of the events, never do
you have to look away from the
screen—Polanski still takes the cup
for unsightliness in the cinema.
A title at the beginning of the
film states that the events
depicted can be historically
authenticated, but it's clear that
Russell is least of all concerned
about what meticulous scholars
will think. Russell's constantly
moving camera and stylized art
direction at once create a sense of
immense spaciousness and
suffocating claustrophobia.
The recreated city of Loudun
appears constructed, both inside
and out, of linoleum bathroom
tiles and the cathedral looks as
modern as St. Mary's in San
Francisco. In the final analysis,
the unusual set design actually
contributes to the psychological
density of the film for on the
inside, the white blocks appear
indestructible and impenetrable
to the confined nuns while on the
outside, the light facades made
the buildings seem somewhat
fragile and tentative, just as the
political position of the city itself
was.
"The Devils" is full of
surprises, all of them rewarding.
With "The Music Lovers" as

evidence, I didn't expect much
depth of character or
characterization, but got both.
Father Grandier is a complex role.
As a political force, he must be
imposing to the authorities and an
accomplished enough public
speaker to hold his city together.
As a man and a sexual object, he
instills most of Loudun's female
population with longing and,
more importantly, obsession. As a
confessor, he must shrewdly deal
with all those with whom he
comes in contact, while still
maintaining his doctrinal
obligations.
As a husband, he must be a
lover and confidant to his wife. As
a priest, he must privately clarify
and publicly justify his attitude
toward the church and God,
especially in regard to the place of
sex and matrimony in the life of a
man of his position. He does this
remarkably well, if sometimes too
conveniently and cleverly.
Despite the obvious delight the
director takes in his outrageous
orgies, Russell takes the time to
sufficiently develop his main
character and that makes all the
difference. In the role, Oliver
Reed decidedly gives the
performance of his career. He
looks stunning and powerfully
fulfills all the demands of the
part.
During the first hour of the
film, mainly devoted to R;ed, I
thought of innumerable questions
concerning the psychology of
Father Grandier and within
minutes, sometimes seconds, they
were answered, thanks both to
Reed and Russell's precise and
exacting screenplay.
Vanessa Redgrave fares rather
less well in a fairly thankless role.
At one point, at the height of her
passion for Reed, she imagines
herself at the foot of the cross at
the crucifixion. Jesus becomes
Reed, descends magically from
the cross and rapes her on the
spot. Most of the other parts are
played in a rather impishly faggy

style, but all are undeniably
powerful in the relentlessness of
their obsessions and cruelties.
Another surprise of the film is
its humor. There is only one scene
which is played predominantly for
its comic effect (a confessional
scene with Reed dismissing
women with amorous intent), but
a wry and most self-conscious
humorous vein runs throughout
the picture which not only helps
alleviate the pain but joins with it
in liberating "The Devils" from
the stuffy, academic approach
which is traditionally part and
parcel of the historical-religious
epic.
Russell's next project, a film of
the musical "The Boy Friend"
starring Twiggy, will be released at
Christmas and obviously
represents a significant departure
from the torturous physicality of
his previous films. He has at least
three projects lined up after that,
as he has courted Barbra Streisand
to appear as Sarah Bernhardt and
then plans to make what will have
to be the ultimate Ken Russell
film, an adaptation of Dante's
"Inferno." For now, "The Devils"
stands as his most exciting
accomplishment to date.

A Bit More on the
Festival—Louis Malle's "Murmur
of the Heart" ("Le Souffle au
Coeur"), currently playing at the
Lark in in San Francisco, was
received as well as anything at the
festival. After a period of
disenchantment with the
commercial cinema, Malle has
returned with a finely honed,
fast-paced entertainment
comically concerning the rather
unusual sexua! awakening of a
young boy through his loving
mother, played with an almost
intense carefreeness by Lea
Massaiu (the girl who disappeared
in "L'avventura").
Not the least of the film's
many irrelevant charms is that it is
casually set in 1 954 , when France

faced another Waterloo at Dien
Bien Phu, when Charlie Parker
slithered out of specialized record
players and teen-age brothers were
ratting brats above all else.
Malle hardly dwells on period
recreation, for if he did it would
hardly be worth it. Rather, he
assumes an attitude of comic
fondness towards adolescence
which charms without lingering
sentimentally over it. The element
of incest elevated the film to
scandalous status in France, but it
seems doubtful that anyone
outside the DAR could be
offended by such a fun scene.
Though it has been shown only
at the New York and San
Francisco Film Festivals, "Le
Chagrin et la Pitie" has already
received national coverage in the
press. The documentary provides
in-depth interviews with World
War Two inhabitants of the
French town of Clermont-
Ferrand, from Pierre
Mendes-France to a German
officer of the occupation, from an
aristocratic Resistance fighter to a
shop owner who advertised in the
newspaper that he was not Jewish.
Though any four-and-a-half
hour black-and-white
documentary consisting of
interviews is bound to be difficult
(and the problems of the English
language version have not been
fully resolved) , it is continually
fascinating. Of particular interest
are the Nazi propaganda newsreels
of the time, which took pleasure
in likening Allied units to animal
hordes because of the presence of
Negroes in the troops.
Director Marcel Ophuls (son of
Max) is still disappointed that the
film was refused by French
television, for now it will never
reach the audience for whom it
was intended, the complacent
French bourgeoisie. However,
students have been eating it up on
the Left Bank all season and there
is perhaps a larger audience for
the film in the United States than
attends film festivals.

FRENCH INCEST—A loving mother helps her son break the sex barrier in Louis Malle's breezy study of
adolescence in the early fifties, "Murmur of the Heart." The film, currently at the Larkin in San
Francisco, was a big hit at the recent San Francisco Film Festival.
