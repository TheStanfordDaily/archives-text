Beneath the skin the blood crawls
Before the recital & after the work week,
dinner alone at Le Bistro:
Boeuf bourgougne a la carte
+ Vin de maison, rouge, trois verres
+ Cappuchino
+ Camels =
nausea an hour later & fifteen minutes before
concert.
On a stone bench outside I sat jack-knifed,
swearing off cigarettes
& staring at a pin-thin vein of ants
rush-houring along the crack at the base of the
bench.
Ants are no fat & all crawl.
The Autumn air is chilled & flat.
I didn't notice the piano
until after I was seated in the Aud.
maroon, almost rouge, seats:
set in the center of the stage,
huge, inert, three-legged whale,
black as the pupil of your eye,
its raised top an attentive elephant ear.
(In A Night at the Opera
Harpo dismantles Chico's piano,
discarding everything but the harp
which he then plays.)

It is very comfortable in the Aud.,
not crowded & the padded seats are wide.
The pianist appears. From a distance
she seems slight & plain.
Her light brown hair drapes her shoulders.
She is the heroine.
Her program looks interesting,
though I'm not much judge
& use the paper for poem notes
as they come to mind,
thinking, primarily, about three old men.
One is dead, his white-haired face caked with flies
at the side of the road in West Bengal.
One lives down the street
& works off his retirement pacing the sidewalk,
skinny, unshaven, chain-smoking, behatted,
wearing a suit & tie.
& one works at the desk across from mine at work,
Mr. M., an old man, but a new friend,
Jewish, once a poet I'm told,
a refugee from Germany's early thirties —
tomorrow he'll have a proctoscopy.
In the middle of Brahms "Fantasies," Op. 116,
I needed to piss, but not badly enough to do it
before Beethoven's "32 Variations on a Tneme," Op
191, began.
I was in pain sitting through the last movement
& sprinted to the Men's Room with th' applause.
On the can I saw my reflection in the porcelain
& heard bits of Ernest Bloch slipping under the
door.
I found a pay-phone before intermission,
called & went to see a friend.
We talked until midnight.

The pianist appears. From a distance
she seems slight & plain.
Her light brown hair drapes her shoulders.
She is the heroine.
Her program looks interesting,
though I'm not much judge
& use the paper for poem notes
as they come to mind,
thinking, primarily, about three old men.
One is dead, his white-haired face caked with flies
at the side of the road in West Bengal.
One lives down the street
& works off his retirement pacing the sidewalk,
skinny, unshaven, chain-smoking, behatted,
wearing a suit & tie.
& one works at the desk across from mine at work,
Mr. M., an old man, but a new friend,
Jewish, once a poet I'm told,
a refugee from Germany's early thirties —
tomorrow he'll have a proctoscopy.
In the middle of Brahms "Fantasies," Op. 116,
I needed to piss, but not badly enough to do it
before Beethoven's "32 Variations on a Tneme," Op
191, began.
I was in pain sitting through the last movement
& sprinted to the Men's Room with th' applause.
On the can I saw my reflection in the porcelain
& heard bits of Ernest Bloch slipping under the
door.
I found a pay-phone before intermission,
called & went to see a friend.
We talked until midnight.

Beneath the skin the blood crawls
Before the recital & after the work week,
dinner alone at Le Bistro:
Boeuf bourgougne a la carte
+ Vin de maison, rouge, trois verres
+ Cappuchino
+ Camels =
nausea an hour later & fifteen minutes before
concert.
On a stone bench outside I sat jack-knifed,
swearing off cigarettes
& staring at a pin-thin vein of ants
rush-houring along the crack at the base of the
bench.
Ants are no fat & all crawl.
The Autumn air is chilled & flat.
I didn't notice the piano
until after I was seated in the Aud.
maroon, almost rouge, seats:
set in the center of the stage,
huge, inert, three-legged whale,
black as the pupil of your eye,
its raised top an attentive elephant ear.
(In A Night at the Opera
Harpo dismantles Chico's piano,
discarding everything but the harp
which he then plays.)

It is very comfortable in the Aud.,
not crowded & the padded seats are wide.
