# 'Hiken And Richards'
## Drug Abuse Clinic Benefit 
### JOSEPH FIKSEL 
One of the more talented and original acting teams on the West
Coast will perform on campus Saturday, Oct. 30, in a special benefit
for the Bridge, Stanford's new Drug Abuse Center.
Gerald Hiken and Paul E. Richards, who call themselves TNT (The
New Theater) will give a single show in the Annenberg Art
Auditorium, at 8 p.m. Saturday evening.
After working together at the Actor's Workshop in New York, and
with the Stanford Repertory Theater, the duo decided about two
years ago to form TNT.
Since then, they have performed all over the state, while making
their homes in Palo Alto. Their shows, which consist of a series of
sketches and dramatic extracts, have been received with much
enthusiasm.
Some of their material is written by themselves; other portions are
drawn from poetry or plays by anyone from Shakespeare to Chekhov
to Jules Feiffer. The two work without any props or devices.
Their unique style has been compared to a "handshake," for they
emphasize human contact.
"We like to know the people," say Hiken and Richards. "When we
perform, we are out front. It's better than sitting in a dressing room,
waiting to meet the enemy, pretending that they're your friends."
Saturday's performance is entitled "Favourites from our
Repertoire."
Tickets for the show, which is being co-sponsored by the Stanford
YWCA, may be reserved at extension 3114. Admission is $3 general,
$2 for students.
Hiken and Richards were eager to lend their support to this
benefit, since the Bridge, recently established as a center to deal with
drug problems in the Stanford community, is sorely in need of funds.
The Bridge was conceived as a means of helping people not only to
overcome their immediate drug problems, but also to find a
meaningful alternative existence.
It will oeprate as a twenty-four hour drop-in center, staffed by
student counsellors, at 523 Salvatierra, on campus. Provided that the
initial financial difficulties are met, the Bridge should be open some
time in November.
More information about this valuable project, which is
unprecedented among American universities, will be presented at
Hiken and Richards' benefit performance.

with the Stanford Repertory Theater, the duo decided about two
years ago to form TNT.
Since then, they have performed all over the state, while making
their homes in Palo Alto. Their shows, which consist of a series of
sketches and dramatic extracts, have been received with much
enthusiasm.
Some of their material is written by themselves; other portions are
drawn from poetry or plays by anyone from Shakespeare to Chekhov
to Jules Feiffer. The two work without any props or devices.
Their unique style has been compared to a "handshake," for they
emphasize human contact.
"We like to know the people," say Hiken and Richards. "When we
perform, we are out front. It's better than sitting in a dressing room,
waiting to meet the enemy, pretending that they're your friends."
Saturday's performance is entitled "Favourites from our
Repertoire."
Tickets for the show, which is being co-sponsored by the Stanford
YWCA, may be reserved at extension 3114. Admission is $3 general,
$2 for students.
Hiken and Richards were eager to lend their support to this
benefit, since the Bridge, recently established as a center to deal with
drug problems in the Stanford community, is sorely in need of funds.
The Bridge was conceived as a means of helping people not only to
overcome their immediate drug problems, but also to find a
meaningful alternative existence.
It will oeprate as a twenty-four hour drop-in center, staffed by
student counsellors, at 523 Salvatierra, on campus. Provided that the
initial financial difficulties are met, the Bridge should be open some
time in November.
More information about this valuable project, which is
unprecedented among American universities, will be presented at
Hiken and Richards' benefit performance.
