# Electric Guaraldi Impressive At Home Of Eggplant Hero
## 
### MARC BARMAN 
Could Charlie Brown find true
happiness in an Eggplant Hero
sandwich? Listening to Vince
Guaraldi? At "In Your Ear?"
Probably in all three. But even
if Charlie wasn't there a lot of
happy folks caught this triple
decker-combination this past
weekend, as the Vince Guaraldi
Quartet played a fine home-town
gig. And "In Your Ear" does serve
Eggplant Heros!.
Probably everyone on campus
has heard Vince at one time or
another. Really. Ever watch

"Peanuts" on TV? That
blues-rooted piano splashing in
the background is definitely
Vince. Of course, you just might
happen to own a Guaraldi album.
Even so, things have changed
since then. Vince is playing
electric piano now, and from the
way he plays it, you know it's
here to stay.
"I really like playing it,"he
explained backstage. "It has about
four times the range of a regular
piano. The bass is especially nice."
I'll say. So are the tones he gets
out of it. But what's really wild
about it is the Waa-Waa pedal on
it. When that piano wails. . .!
Having been on an extensive
road tour across the country this
past year, Vince has been feeling
very much at home in his native
Bay Area lately. His current band
has been together for about six
months, and has been playing
clubs locally and around Lake
Tahoe.
In those six months the group
has coalesced quite nicely, and
does some impressive things. They
are still developing, however, and
should be getting into some
deeper things soon.
His sidemen are constantly full
of surprises. Bass player John
Wellmith (acoustic and electric
bass) also has this freaky thing

that looks like a badly
under-nourished French horn,
sounds kind of like a trumpet, and
Ls an absolute gas to listen to.
Tenor player Vince Denim,
also plays soprano sax and a very
rich-toned flute. He has a driving,
muscular sound and plays the
extreme ranges of his horn with
ease and power. To my taste, he
doesn't play as long as I wish he
would.
Drummer John Waller is solid,
dependable, and an unobtrusive
delight.
Among the musical highlights
were "It's Only Just Begun," the
Carpenters' song, on which Vince
coaxed chime-like chords from
the electric piano, followed by
"Watch What Happens," played
with an up-tempo Latin beat.
Demin played some spell-binding
flute here.
There were some fine rock
things, with Wellmith on electric
bass and Guaraldi using the
extended range of the electric
piano to go so far into the bass
you could feel the room shake.
Between the vibrations and the
vibrations, there was a mellow,
relaxed rapport between the
audience and the musicians. Said
Denim, "The people here have
been fantastic. We always play
better with a crowd like this."
