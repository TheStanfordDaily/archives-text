Going into last weekend's Pac-8 competition, the Rose Bowl race
seemed all but over. The Stanford Indians had trounced Oregon,
Washington, and USC, and merely had to work their way past the
conference's weaker teams in order to arrange another trip to
Pasadena.
The scenario was shattered, however, when Jim Sweeney's WSU
Cougars did some trouncing of their own, defeating the Indians 24-23
to rack up their first Pac-8 win since 1968. The Cougars turned a one
man show into a five team race.
There are five teams in the Pac-8 now with one loss, and four of
these squads will be involved with each other this weekend in games
that will narrow the field. In the two big games this weekend, Oregon
State will host Stanford, and Oregon will travel to Pullman to meet
Washington State.
Indians Must Win
The Indians must beat the Beavers in order to have a realistic shot
at successfully defending their Pac-8 title. Oregon State has a 1-1
conference record and is 34 overall, but the Beavers are third in the
league in total defense and have an explosive offense led by the
Pac-B's third leading rusher, Dave Shilling, who has a 93.4 average.
Steve Endicott, OSU's quarterback, ranks fifth in the league in total
offense and fourth in passing, and is an excellent team leader. The
winner of the Indian-Beaver game will probably emerge as the team to
beat in the Rose Bowl scramble, further enhancing the importance of
the contest.
If the Indians finish the season without losing again, the only team
that can nose them out will be WSU if they too manage to win all of
their remaining Pac-8 games. This is considered unlikely, since the
Cougars must play Orepon next week, and then complete their Pac-8

schedule on the road against USC, Oregon State, and then
Washington.
Both Oregon and WSU must win Saturday to keep their hopes
significantly alive in the mixed-up conference race. The Ducks have
suffered only one conference loss to Stanford, and have beaten both
USC and Washington. If both Oregon schools win Saturday, the league
championship will most likely be decided when they meet in Eugene
on the last day of the season.
UCLA Should Be Eliminated
The fifth team with only one loss, UCLA, will probably receive
their second this weekend at the hands of the powerful Washington
Huskies. In another game this Saturday, the USC Trojans will travel to
Berkeley to face the ineligible Bears.
This year's conference standings have been thrown into confusion
by Cal's suspension by the NCAA because they chose to play Isaac
Curtis who had been suspended earlier. After the NCAA ruling, the
Pac-8 voted to rule Cal out of any chance of going to the Rose Bowl
by declaring all their games with league teams to be considered as
non-conference contests in the league standings.
The Cal suspension has worked against Stanford, in that the Bears
have beaten both Oregon State and Washington State. Under normal
circumstances, this would have given both squads two conference
losses as opposed to the Indians' one. With Cal out, however, five
teams have one loss and the Big Game will not have any bearing on
the league championship for Stanford.
Two Time Losers
Washington and USC both have two conference losses inflicted by
Oregon and Stanford, and appear to be out of the race unless all the
top five teams knock each other off. Both squads will have a say,
however, in who goes to the Rose Bowl. The Cougars and Bruins must
get by both the Trojans and Huskies in order to stay in contention,
and those prospects are unlikely for both contenders.
With WSU and UCLA facing the two toughest "losers" in the
Pac-8, Oregon, Oregon State, and Stanford have the best chances to
extend their seasons to January Ist. Oregon will go if they beat WSU
and OSU and Stanford loses one of their remaining conference games.
OSU will take the league crown if they beat Stanford and Oregon, and
Stanford will cop the Roses if they beat OSU and UCLA and WSU
loses one more game.
It is conceivable that three or four teams could end the season with
4-2 records, and the Pac-8 commissioner's office is prepared for this
eventuality with a complicated point system based on conference and
non-conference records. If there is a tie after the point values are
assigned, the team that has not been to the Rose Bowl for the longest
will represent the Pac-8 on New Year's Day.
If there is a two-way tie at the end of the season, the team that

prevailed in the deadlocked squads' regular season meeting will go to
the Rose Bowl.
A Simple Solution Exists
The Cougars' upset of Stanford last weekend represented more
than their first conference win since 1968. That upset has thrown the
Rose Bowl race into a hopeless confusion that will have everyone
speculating, clarifying, and second-guessing everyone else for weeks to
come. The simplest and most desirable alternative, however, is .or
Stanford to win two and the Cougars to lose one, putting everyone
out of their mathematic misery and sending the Indians to Pasadena
once again.
