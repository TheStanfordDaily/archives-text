# Despite Pollution Protest
## Bonfire To Burn As Usual 
### WARD HEADSTROM 
Despite rumored financial difficulties and the wishes of
several ecology-minded groups, the traditional big game
bonfire will take place this year.
It has been speculated that recent anti-pollution laws
and a lack of funds, caused by the $0 vote for the ASSU
last spring would put an end to the annual bonfire in Lake
Lagunita the night before the California-Stanford football
game. But Rick Dickenson of the Inter-fraternity Council
said, "the bonfire definitely is on."
Last year's bonfire was opposed by the Stanford
Conservation Club because of the air pollution created.
An engineering report given to Stanford last week
showed that the fire puts approximately 4.37 tons of
contaminants into the air. This is about one-tenth of the
amount of pollution emitted by jets at San Francisco
International Airport each day.
One-Shot Deal
A spokesman for the engineering firm wrote, "from the
above figures, it does not appear that a one-shot deal once a
year will mean the end of the world."
In view of this report, a meeting of the San Francisco
Air Pollution Control Board here last Thursday night
decided to permit the fire.
The ecology house and the Conservation Club, while still
opposed to the fire in principle, are taking no direct
action to prevent it.

The bonfire's financial problems were also ironed out
last week when the athletic department agreed to donate
$1,000 to pay for oil, trucks to haul wood, and other
expenses involved in lighting the fire.
Tom Huseby, financial manager of the ASSU, foresees
only one other major problem in this year's big game rally:
finding a group to take charge of preparations. The
Cardinal's Board and the Axe Committee have been unable
to assume their traditional role of planning the bonfire
because the ASSU has no money to fund them this year.
But the Inter-fraternity Council has recently assumed
the responsibility for planning. Dickenson, chairman of the
IFC bonfire committee, has already begun the task of
organizing freshman fire builders.
Guard It
As in the past, the freshmen will have the
responsibility of constructing and guarding the giant
bonfire.
Dickenson said he was expecting the fire permit to be
issued in the next couple of weeks.
Dickenson says"the only problem left is civic pressure,"
but so far, protests from the community haven't been very
loud. Stanford Fire Chief Frank Jurian noted "I haven't
received any complaints to my office."

the responsibility for planning. Dickenson, chairman of the
IFC bonfire committee, has already begun the task of
organizing freshman fire builders.
Guard It
As in the past, the freshmen will have the
responsibility of constructing and guarding the giant
bonfire.
Dickenson said he was expecting the fire permit to be
issued in the next couple of weeks.
Dickenson says"the only problem left is civic pressure,"
but so far, protests from the community haven't been very
loud. Stanford Fire Chief Frank Jurian noted "I haven't
received any complaints to my office."
