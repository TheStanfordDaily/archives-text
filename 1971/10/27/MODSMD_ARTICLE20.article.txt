The Stanford Cross-Country
team in its last test before the
Pacific Eight Championships
travels to Berkeley to face Cal and
Southern California this Saturday.
California was a loser to
Washington State earlier this year
by a margin similar to the one
Stanford lost by last weekend,
while Southern California finished
third to Stanford and UCLA two
weeks ago at Westwood.
Cal is led by Cliff West who
finished third against Washington
State as did Duncan Macdonald
last weekend. The 4.0 mile course
favors the Bears as Stanford has
never raced on it before. This is
coupled with the fact that for the
last two years Stanford has been
heavily favored to win, but each
time Cal has come up with a great
effort to make it close.
USC Improved
Southern Cal is supposedly
improved over two weeks ago as
its top two runners are looking
much stronger now. However,
Coach Marshall C'.ark figures the
main challenge will come from
Cal.
Stanford will have to get top

efforts from all its runners to win
as Robert Coe is still out with a
sore knee and Arvid Kretz has a
bad cold and is doubtful for
Saturday. Both of these runners
would have scored high against
the Bears
Against Washington State,
Coach Clark believes Stanford did
an excellent job as Macdonald,
Kretz, Schoenrock, McConnell
and Hayman all ran lifetime bests.
However, the Cougars' depth was
just too much for the Indians to
handle. Clark believes Washington
State is strong enough to beat
conference favorite Oregon
because it has so many strong
runners. Clark considers the
Cougars definite contenders for
the NCAA Championship.
Northern Meet
The Indians will be able to find
out how the rest of the
conference stacks up next
weekend as Washington State,
Oregon, Washington, and Oregon
State meet at Eugene in a
Northern Division Championship.
Based on how Washington State
does against the other teams,
Stanford will be able to determine
how they will probably do at the
Pacific Eight Championships.
