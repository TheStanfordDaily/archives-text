UN China Vote Analyzed
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. - The United Nations made
ready yesterday to welcome Red China into the General
Assembly. With the ouster of Nationalist China, the
Chinese seat remained vacant for the moment. Meanwhile,
leaders around the world commented on the change in
membership.
Reports circulated in U.N. corridors that representatives
from Red China would arrive soon, perhaps headed by
Premier Chou En-lai. A similar report came from the Peking
correspondent of the Tokyo newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
Meanwhile in Washington, Secretary of State William P.
Rogers said the United States will respect the U.N. decision
to expel Taiwan, but added that the Nixon administration
regards it as "a most unfortunate precedent."
Sen. Barry Goldwater recommended that the United
States leave the U.N.; New York Senator James Buckley
announced plans to introduce a bill to reduce American
financial support for the world body. Liberal senators
including Idaho's Frank Church cautioned against such a
cut.
Presidential adviser Henry Kissinger had no comment on
his return to Washington from Peking.
In Taipei, Chiang Kai-Shek renewed his avowed
determination to overthrow the Communist Chinese
government. In a defiant address, he branded the U.N.
action "infamous" and promised that his country would
not withdraw from world affairs.
Japan, although a supporter of the United States
position at the U.N., reacted favorably. Prime Minister
Eisake Sato said the decision would benefit his nation in
the long run.
The governments of France, West Germany, and
Yugoslavia were among those applauding the U.N. action;
expressing regret at the ouster of the nationalists were the
Philippines, Thailand, Australia, and New Zealand.
The news was reported without comment in Moscow.
In Sacramento, Governor Ronald Reagan, recently
returned from the Far East, branded the U.N. "a kangaroo
court; a morally bankrupt, ridiculous debating society." He
said he was "deeply shocked" by the decision.
D.C. Protesters Arrested
WASHINGTON — A march by antiwar demonstrators
attempting to serve an "eviction notice" on President
Nixon was broken up yesterday by police who arrested
between 200 and 300 protesters on minor charges. The
confrontation lasted about an hour and produced no
serious violence.
The marchers were halted about a block from the White
House and some of them sat down on the sidewalk or
attempted to break through the police lines. This brought
the arrests on charges of obstructing a sidewalk or
disorderly conduct, both misdemeanors.

France, USSR Agree
PARIS — France has agreed to sign a "declaration of
principles" with the Soviet Union governing future
Paris-Moscow relations, but official sources said last night
deep policy differences remain on some concrete issues
discussed with Soviet Communist party boss Leonid I.
Brezhnev.
President Georges Pompidou subscribed tothe
declaration, without precedent in Western dealings with
Moscow, but stood firm on France's ties with the West. He
resisted Soviet pressure for a friendship treaty to mark
Brezhnev's visit to France.
Cuban Airways Busy
HAVANA — Soviet Premier Alexei N. Kosygin arrived at a
Havana airport yesterday where 236 hi-jacked Americans
had been stranded for 14 hours. Meanwhile, a planeload of
Cubans landed at New Orleans and the pilot refused to
leave.
Cuban Premier Fidel Castro led a throng of Cubans who
gave Kosygin a flag waving, cheering reception at Jose Marti
Airport.
Monday night, an American Airlines 747 put down at
Jose Marti after a gunman hijacked the plane while it was
en route from New York to San Juan, Puerto Rico.
Yesterday, a Russian-built prop jet from Havana with 19
passengers and three crewmen aboard landed unexpectedly
at New Orleans Airport.
The group told airport officials they had come to attend
a sugarcane conference, even though the United States
refused to grant them entry visas last month.
Police Capture Kidnappers
SAN DIEGO — Two armed robbers with two terrified
hostages led police on a high-speed, 165-mile chase
yesterday until they were captured and the hostages
released unharmed at a sheriff's roadblock.
The gunmen, who began their desperate six-hour flight
after a supermarket holdup in Long Beach, surrendered
peacefully about 60 miles east of San Diego on an isolated
stretch of Interstate 8.
Pontine Busing Upheld
WASHINGTON — A unanimous Supreme Court declined
yesterday to review a massive busing plan for schools in
Pontiac, Mich., scene of bombings last summer.
Pontiac school officials had contended in their appeal
that whatever segregation exists in the blue-collar
community is a result of housing patterns.
