# Witness Says Miller Withheld Data
## 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
Provost William F. Miller intentionally did not
publicize that a controversial amphibious assault
computer program at the Computation Center had
been discontinued a day before the center was
occupied on February 10, a systems programmer at
the Center charged yesterday.
Elizabeth Michael's testimony came as the
Franklin hearing went into its 23rd session.
Michael said that she had learned from Comp
Center director Susan Kolasa that Miller had told
several members of the Comp Center staff that he
wanted to keep a "low profile" on cancellation of the
controversial "Gamut-H" program.
"Gamut-H" involved planning an efficient
amphibious assault and was being run at the center by
the Stanford Research Institute (SRI). At the time of
the Laos invasion in February, it was a focal point in
debate over Stanford's involvement in the war.
Following Michael's testimony, several witnesses
testified that, in their opinion, if people had known
"Gamut-H" had been cancelled, there wouldn't have
been an occupation of the Comp Center. Franklin has
been charged with inciting occupation of the Center.
Length of Defense
Yesterday's testimony came amid renewed and
more heated controversy over the length of time
Franklin is taking to present his defense.
On Monday, Advisory Board Chairman Donald
Kennedy established a target date of Saturday for
Franklin to finish his defense, now in its third week.
Kennedy also requested on Monday that Franklin
give the board written argument for continuation of
his defense beyond Saturday if he so wished.
At the beginning of yesterday's hearing. Franklin

called Monday's move by the Board a "gross violation
of due process" and added that he was planning on
concluding his defense in about two and one half
weeks.
Kennedy reproached Franklin for "a good deal of
repetitious and barely relevant testimony."
At yesterday's hearing, several witnesses said that
the decision to go to the Computation Center had
been made before the White Plaza rally at noon on
the 10th.
Ed Nelson, a graduate student in Computer
Science, said he had become aware of the
Computation Center as the target for a demonstration
several days before the 10th after reading a leaflet on
the "Gamut-H" program.
McNellis Testifies
Kathleen McNellis, a former graduate student in
Education who admitted going inside the center on
the 10th, said Franklin's rally speech "didn't impress
me" and that the course of events had been pretty
much laid out" before people got to the rally.
History Professor Harold Kahn said he felt that the
noon rally had only been intended "to confirm a
decision essentially reached the night before" at a
meeting in Dinkelspiel.
Kahn, who also admitted going into the Center,
said he had not been impressed by Franklin's rally
speech and that "although I don't want to embarass
you Bruce, I'd heard a lot of that speech before."
All of yesterday's witnesses seemed to agree that
the crowd had gone to the Center probably intending
to take some action similar to the blocking of
doorways at the facility which had occurred during
the Cambodian invasion.
Yesterday's seven witnesses also seemed to agree

that Franklin displayed no leadership role at the
Comp Center.
There was also substantial corroboration among
witnesses that people had mainly "milled
around"while inside the center and outside on the
lawn before the police charge.
Several witnesses also told of police acts of
violence they either experienced or saw, and added
that Franklin had not turned the crowd on the police,
as it is charged.
Further Limits
In a further attempt to limit Franklin's marathon
defense yesterday, Kennedy said that "we've got to
do something about the multiplication of testimony"
and then required Franklin to give a brief explanation
of "where he is going with each witness" before the
witness is to testify.
The Board also gave Franklin further guidelines
concerning what testimony it wanted to hear.
The Board said it did not want to hear any more
about damage to the Computer and how it could
have been greater.
It also said it accepted that there was a history of
concern on campus about research at the Comp
Center.
Kennedy Concludes
Kennedy finally said that he did not care to hear
what happened to people after the police charge nor
personal opinion about the legality of the police
order to disperse.
But Kennedy did say that the Board wished more
testimony on Franklin's activities between the time
the police arrived at the Center and their charge.
The hearing resumes todav at 1 p.m. in Physics
101.
