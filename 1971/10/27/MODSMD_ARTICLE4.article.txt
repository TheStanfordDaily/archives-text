# Experts Assess New China Role
## 
### CHRIS PECK 
For the first time in the history
of the United Nations a delegation
from the People's Republic of
China will soon take a seat in the
General Assembly. In the minds
of most Stanford experts, the
admission of mainland China into
the UN is symbolic of a newly
emerging world attitude towards
the Asian giant.
Stanford's China-watchers
agree for the most part that the
admission of the world's most
populous nation into the United
Nations is long overdue, but in

itself does not represent a major
shift in the world balance of
power.
Instead, notes Political Science
professor Robert North, "The
admission of the People's
Republic of China is an important
event for mankind as a whole."
Assistant professor of Political
Science Harry Harding adds that
while "the admission of the
Communist Chinese to the U.N. is
a very important symbolic move
because it ushers China once and
for all into the picture of world
events, it doesn't represent a
turning point in world power
relationships."
While American social and
political leaders have for some
time advocated the seating of the
People's Republic in theUnited
Nations there has been much
angry reaction to the U.N.'s
decision to oust the Chiang
Kai-shek regime on Taiwan to
make room for mainland China.
Congress Protests
At least 56 members of
Congress have vowed to cut U.S.
aid to the U.N. as a protest of the
General Assembly's vote ousting
the Formosans in favor of Peking.
California Governor Ronald
Reagan called the vote "a slap in
the face by what was nothing
more than a kangaroo court"and
added that the U.S. should give
"very serious consideration to
what its position is going to be in
this ridiculous debating society."
Stanford China experts were
somewhat concerned over the fate
of Taiwan as well. East Asian
Scholar and history professor
Lyman Van Slyke saw the U.N.
vote as "further evidence that as
mainland China becomes more
generally recognized, Taiwan will
be dealt out of the picture."
"Despite my lack of sympathy
for the Chiang Kai-shek
government I like everything else
about the island of Formosa,"

Van Slyke continued, "and I am
sorry to see those people not be
represented in the world
peace-keeping organization."
No Representation
"The trouble with the U.N.
situation now is that there is no
way for the natives of Formosa to
be represented in that
organization. The United States
has failed to find a formula
whereby it could support the
people of Formosa without
supporting the Chiang Kai-shek
regime," Van Slyke concluded.
Professor North added that he
"was regretful that it had to turn
out the way it did for the
Nationalists because it sets an
unfortunate precedent for the
United Nations."
In commenting on the negative
reaction of some government
officials and politicians to the
ousting of Taiwan, Professor
North said, "it's ironic that some
American leaders are advocating
withdrawal from the U.N. because
things aren't going the way we
planned. We were scornfui of the
Russians back in the 1950's when
they balked at complying with
U.N. decisions they didn't agree
with and now we're doing the
same thing they did."

"There is also a certain irony in
the fact that the Richard Nixon,
who made his career opposing
China's entry into the U.N. back
in 1949, is the same man who
brought about this shift in
American policy," North added.
As for the future of Taiwan,
Stanford experts agree that there
won't be much change in the
Taiwan government position until
Chiang Kai-shek is out of the
picture. After Chiang's death,
professor Harding predicts "either
some kind of autonomous
province status for the island with
loose ties to the mainland or a
possible recognition by the Taipei
government that it is only a
representative of the Formosan
natives and therefore should be an
independent country with no
connections to the mainland."
Professor Harding also sees a
continued effort by the
Communist Chinese toward
"improving relations with the
world at large through the United
Nations." As a long-range goal of
U.N. membership, Harding sees
the Chinese as eventually trying to
consolidate power in the U.N. to
work against the United States,
Japan, and the Soviet Union.

Science Harry Harding adds that
while "the admission of the
Communist Chinese to the U.N. is
a very important symbolic move
because it ushers China once and
for all into the picture of world
events, it doesn't represent a
turning point in world power
relationships."
While American social and
political leaders have for some
time advocated the seating of the
People's Republic in theUnited
Nations there has been much
angry reaction to the U.N.'s
decision to oust the Chiang
Kai-shek regime on Taiwan to
make room for mainland China.
Congress Protests
At least 56 members of
Congress have vowed to cut U.S.
aid to the U.N. as a protest of the
General Assembly's vote ousting
the Formosans in favor of Peking.
California Governor Ronald
Reagan called the vote "a slap in
the face by what was nothing
more than a kangaroo court"and
added that the U.S. should give
"very serious consideration to
what its position is going to be in
this ridiculous debating society."
Stanford China experts were
somewhat concerned over the fate
of Taiwan as well. East Asian
Scholar and history professor
Lyman Van Slyke saw the U.N.
vote as "further evidence that as
mainland China becomes more
generally recognized, Taiwan will
be dealt out of the picture."
"Despite my lack of sympathy
for the Chiang Kai-shek
government I like everything else
about the island of Formosa,"

Van Slyke continued, "and I am
sorry to see those people not be
represented in the world
peace-keeping organization."
No Representation
"The trouble with the U.N.
situation now is that there is no
way for the natives of Formosa to
be represented in that
organization. The United States
has failed to find a formula
whereby it could support the
people of Formosa without
supporting the Chiang Kai-shek
regime," Van Slyke concluded.
Professor North added that he
"was regretful that it had to turn
out the way it did for the
Nationalists because it sets an
unfortunate precedent for the
United Nations."
In commenting on the negative
reaction of some government
officials and politicians to the
ousting of Taiwan, Professor
North said, "it's ironic that some
American leaders are advocating
withdrawal from the U.N. because
things aren't going the way we
planned. We were scornfui of the
Russians back in the 1950's when
they balked at complying with
U.N. decisions they didn't agree
with and now we're doing the
same thing they did."

"There is also a certain irony in
the fact that the Richard Nixon,
who made his career opposing
China's entry into the U.N. back
in 1949, is the same man who
brought about this shift in
American policy," North added.
As for the future of Taiwan,
Stanford experts agree that there
won't be much change in the
Taiwan government position until
Chiang Kai-shek is out of the
picture. After Chiang's death,
professor Harding predicts "either
some kind of autonomous
province status for the island with
loose ties to the mainland or a
possible recognition by the Taipei
government that it is only a
representative of the Formosan
natives and therefore should be an
independent country with no
connections to the mainland."
Professor Harding also sees a
continued effort by the
Communist Chinese toward
"improving relations with the
world at large through the United
Nations." As a long-range goal of
U.N. membership, Harding sees
the Chinese as eventually trying to
consolidate power in the U.N. to
work against the United States,
Japan, and the Soviet Union.
For the first time in the history
of the United Nations a delegation
from the People's Republic of
China will soon take a seat in the
General Assembly. In the minds
of most Stanford experts, the
admission of mainland China into
the UN is symbolic of a newly
emerging world attitude towards
the Asian giant.
Stanford's China-watchers
agree for the most part that the
admission of the world's most
populous nation into the United
Nations is long overdue, but in

itself does not represent a major
shift in the world balance of
power.
Instead, notes Political Science
professor Robert North, "The
admission of the People's
Republic of China is an important
event for mankind as a whole."
Assistant professor of Political
