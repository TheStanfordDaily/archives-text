# State 'Radical Ban' Bill Passes Committee Test
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
State Sen. Clark Bradley's bill to
allow college presidents to bar
undesirable persons from campuses
received another boost yesterday when
the Assembly Criminal Justice
Committee sent it to the floor with a
favorable recommendation.
The bill had previously passed the
State Senate on a 22-1 vote, just one
vote over the 21 required for passage.
According to Peter Caldwell,
administrative assistant to Sen. Bradley,
there were "no substantiative changes
or amendments" made in the bill
during committee hearings.
He said that there were some "very
minor" changes made in the bill, but
was unable to elaborate on what they
were. Assuming the bill is approved by
the Assembly, it would return to the
Senate for final approval of the changes
before it goes to Governor Reagan,
who is certain to sign it.
Bar Undesirables
In its original form, the bill provides
that a university president can bar any
"person or persons who have
committed or who it reasonably
appears to the chief executive officer
may commit on campus, acts
prejudicial to the order and safety of
the private college."
Sen. Bradley, a conservative San
Jose Republican, introduced the bill at
the request of Pepperdine University, a

Los Angeles-based "independent
Christian college."
Caldwell denied there was anything
unusual in Bradley's sponsorship of the
bill for an institution outside his
district.
"It's possible that the Los Angeles
legislator whose district includes
Pepperdine couldn't or wouldn't carry
the bill for them," he said.
Pepperdine is represented in the
State Senate by James Q. Wedworth,
and in the Assembly by David Pierson.
Both are Democrats.
Lyman Criticizes
Although President Lyman criticized
the bill and stated that he was in favor
of retaining the current system of court
injunctions, Caldwell asserted that "to
my knowledge there has been no
criticism of the bill from college
administrators."
He also said that Bradley's office has
received no written criticism of the bill
from administrators.
The bill has also drawn heavy fire
from Larry Diamond of the ASSU
Council of Presidents, and from Law
Professor Anthony Amsterdam.
Although Pepperdine is not in
Bradley's district, Stanford is, as well as
San Jose State College. In addition, a
substantial amount of the University of
Santa Clara area is also in Bradley's
district, although the campus itself is in
the neighboring district of Sen. Alfred
Alquist.
