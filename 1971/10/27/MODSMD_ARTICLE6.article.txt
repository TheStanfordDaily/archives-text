## The 						Conflict Of A Career-Oriented Woman 
### 
Third In A Series
Several arguments are typically
advanced to counter the claim
that America's homogenization of
its women subverts individuality
and self-fulfillment. The three
most common arguments invoke,
respectively, (1) free will, (2)
biology, and (3) complementarity.
(1) The free will argument
proposes that a 21-year-old
woman is perfectly free to choose
some other role if she cares to do
so; no one is standing in her way.
But that is hardly the case. Even
the woman who has managed to
finesse society's attempt to rob
her of her career motivations is
likely to find herself blocked by
society's trump card: the feeling
that one cannot have a career and
be a successful woman
simultaneously.
A competent and motivated
woman is thus caught in a
double-bind which few men have
even faced. She must worry not
only about failure, but also about
success. If she fails in her
achievement needs, she must live
with the knowledge that she is not
living up to her potential. But if
she succeeds, she must live with
the knowledge that she is not
living up to her own—and
society's—conception of a
feminine woman. Thus, even the
woman who is lucky enough to

have retained some career
motivation is likely to find herself
in serious conflict: she has a
motive to achieve as well as a
motive to avoid success.
This conflict was strikingly
revealed in a study which required
college women to complete the
following story: "After first-term
finals, Anne finds herself at the
top of her medical-school class"
(Horner, 1969 ). The stories were
then examined for unconscious,
internal conflict about success and
failure. The women in this study
all had high intellectual ability
and histories of academic success.
They were the very women who
could have successful careers. And
yet, over two-thirds of their
stories revealed a clearcut inability
to cope with the concept of a
feminine, yet career-oriented
woman.
The most common
"fear-of-success" stories showed
strong fears of social rejection as a
result of success. The women in
this group showed anxiety about
becoming unpopular,
unmarriageable, and lonely:
Anne starts proclaiming her
surprise and joy. Her fellow
classmates are so disgusted with
her behavior that they jump on
her in a body and beat her. She is
maimed for life.
Anne is an acne-faced

bookworm She studies
twelve hours a day, and lives at
home to save money. "Well, it
certainly paid off. All the Friday
and Saturday nights without
dates, fun—l'll be the best woman
doctor alive." And yet a twinge of
sadness comes through—she
wonders what she really has
Although Anne is happy with
her success, she fears what will
happen to her social life. The male
med students don't seem to think
very highly of a female who has
beaten them in their field
She will be a proud and successful
but alas a very lonely doctor.
Anne is pretty darn proud of
herself, but everyone hates and
envies her.
Anne doesn't want to be
number one in her class .... She
feels she shouldn't rank so high
because of social reasons. She

drops to ninth and then marries
the boy who graduates number
one.
In the second "fear-of-success"
category were stories in which the
women seemed concerned about
definitions of womanhood. These
stories expressed guilt and despair
over success and doubts about
their femininity and normality:
Unfortunately Anne no longer
feels so certain that she really
wants to be a doctor. She is
worried about herself and
wonders if perhaps she is not
normal .... Anne decides not
to continue with her medical
work but to take courses that
have a deeper personal meaning
for her.
Anne feels guilty .... She will
finally have a nervous breakdown
and quit medical school and
marry a successful young doctor.

A third group of stories could
not even face up to the conflict
between having a career and being
a woman. These stories simply
denied the possibility that any
woman could be so successful:
Anne is a code name for a
nonexistent person created by a
group of med students. They take
turns writing for Anne ....
Anne is really happy she's on
top, though Tom is higher than
she—though that's as it should be.
Anne doesn't mind Tom winning.
Anne is talking to her
counselor. Counselor says she will
make a fine nurse.
It was luck that Anne came out
on top because she didn't want to
go to medical school anyway.
By way of contrast, here is a
typical story written not about
Anne, but about John:

John has worked very hard and
his long hours of study have paid
off... . He is thinking about his
girl, Cheri, whom he will marry at
the end of med school. He realizes
he can give her all the things she
desires after he becomes
established. He will go on in med
school and be successful in the
long run.
Nevertheless, there were a few
women in the study who
welcomed the prospect of success:
Anne is quite a lady-not only
is she top academically, but she is
liked and admired by her fellow
students—quite a trick in a
man-dominated field. She is
brilliant—but she is also a woman.
She will continue to be at or near
the top. And ... always a lady.
Hopefully the day is
approaching when as many

"Anne" stories as "John" stories
will have happy endings.
It should be clear that the
"free-will" argument conveniently
overlooks the fact that the society
which has spent twenty long years
carefully marking the woman's
ballot for her has nothing to lose
in that twenty-first year by
pretending to let her cast it for
the alternative of her choice.
Society has controlled not her
alternatives, but her motivation to
choose any but one of those
alternatives. The so-called
"freedom-to-choose" is illusory,
and it cannot be invoked to
justify the society which controls
the motivation to choose.
