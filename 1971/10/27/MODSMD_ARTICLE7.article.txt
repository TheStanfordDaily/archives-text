DOD Research
Editor, THE DAILY:
I have noticed recently, for
example in questions asked at the
Franklin hearing and in the Daily
article on the SWOPSI course on
DOD sponsored research, the
tendency to imply that because
the descriptions of research
projects supplied by the chief
investigator at Stanford and the
sponsoring agency are quite
different, this comprises evidence
of an attempt to cover up

activities which might be
unpopular on campus.
It seems to me that this
attitude displays an ignorance of
the basic philosophy and content
of most good academic research in
the sciences and engineering. Such
research seeks to generate an
understanding of physical
phenomena and/or to develop
methods of applying such
knowledge to technological
problems. Precisely because the
best of such work has broad
implications, the description

presented by a sponsoring agency
justifying their expenditure is
likely to be quite different from
that of another agency with a
different mission, or from a
description written by the
principal investigator.
Stanford has an outstanding
research activity in science and
engineering, and I have the
impression that those of us
involved are working on
essentially the same problems that
we would be struggling with even
if the University had the resources
to cover our research costs,
student support and salaries,
without the need for us to seek
outside sponsorship.
The ideas which appear in our
research proposals are commonly
self generated, and a description
in basic academic terms does
accurately iepresent the activity
from our, and the University's,
standpoint. This is not to say that,
on occasion, an academic
researcher may not wish to
emphasise some particular

application of particular interest
to a sponsor, though his
involvement as a faculty member
is concerned with the more
general approach.
Stanford's development in the
last twenty-five years has
prescribed that much of our
educational and research activity
has an under-pinning of sponsored
research projects. In view of the
budget situation, this
circumstance will clearly have to
be retained in the years
immediately ahead if we are to
meet bold educational objectives.
It is therefore extremely
important that the whole
Stanford community has a correct
understanding of what is involved,
and that misconceptions are not
permitted to cause dissension.

Hoover Reply
Editor, THE DAILY:
I reply to the unfounded
charges of Prof. Raymond Giraud
(Daily, Oct. 18) that the recent
Hoover Institution conference on
Iran was deliberately left
"unpublicized" as part of a
scheme to insulate the meeting
from public debate and thus "to
develop propagandistic support
for the government of the Shah."
Perhaps more than Prof.
Giraud I regret that the Daily and
the off-campus media of general
circulation chose not to print
advance announcements of the
conference. One of the Daily's
news editors had been supplied
with a full program nearly a week
in advance. The general media also
were forewarned, although not so
amply—and for this I take full
responsibility.
For the record, Campus Report
carried the conference in its
calendar of Oct. 13, giving dates,
times and topics but deleting
speakers' names in order to
conserve space.
On Oct. 7 and 8, interim
typewritten programs had been
mailed to institutions and
individuals in the Bay Area. One
of the Iranian student leaders told
me of the receipt of such a leaflet
at Berkeley Oct. 12—again nearly
a week before the conference
opened. When printed programs
were ready Oct. 14, thev were
immediately disseminated to
Stanford departments and
individuals.
Til ere was no conspiracy of
silence. Surely it would not have
been indulged by Tresidder
Union, which gives highest

priority to public meetings from
which students can benefit. To
the rumor—spread by Jim Shoch
in his Daily column of Oct.
18—that "members of the militant
Iranian Students Association have
been barred from the
conference," I can only ask: How
could such exclusion have been
enforced at a free and open
meeting?
The sessions on Iran were
organized along the lines of four
Hoover-sponsored conferences
which preceded them between
196 4 and 19 71 : scholarly papers
followed by ample time for
questions and answers. As in the
past, there was no charge for
admission.
Prof. Giraud's pre-judgments
that the event was "obviously
one-sided" and provided "no
mechanism for the testing of
ideas" were belied by the content
of the papers actually presented,
and by the grace and reflectivity
with which most speakers met
their critics' challenges from the
floor.
Lacking information and
resolved to reach his
pre-determined conclusions, Prof.
Giraud created a plot that did not
exist. Once again, a man whose
mind was made up refused to risk
having it changed by the facts.

Editor, THE DAILY:
I reply to the unfounded
charges of Prof. Raymond Giraud
(Daily, Oct. 18) that the recent
Hoover Institution conference on
Iran was deliberately left
"unpublicized" as part of a
scheme to insulate the meeting
from public debate and thus "to
develop propagandistic support
for the government of the Shah."
Perhaps more than Prof.
Giraud I regret that the Daily and
the off-campus media of general
circulation chose not to print
advance announcements of the
conference. One of the Daily's
news editors had been supplied
with a full program nearly a week
in advance. The general media also
were forewarned, although not so
amply—and for this I take full
responsibility.
For the record, Campus Report
carried the conference in its
calendar of Oct. 13, giving dates,
times and topics but deleting
speakers' names in order to
conserve space.
On Oct. 7 and 8, interim
typewritten programs had been
mailed to institutions and
individuals in the Bay Area. One
of the Iranian student leaders told
me of the receipt of such a leaflet
at Berkeley Oct. 12—again nearly
a week before the conference
opened. When printed programs
were ready Oct. 14, thev were
immediately disseminated to
Stanford departments and
individuals.
Til ere was no conspiracy of
silence. Surely it would not have
been indulged by Tresidder
Union, which gives highest

priority to public meetings from
which students can benefit. To
the rumor—spread by Jim Shoch
in his Daily column of Oct.
18—that "members of the militant
Iranian Students Association have
been barred from the
conference," I can only ask: How
could such exclusion have been
enforced at a free and open
meeting?
The sessions on Iran were
organized along the lines of four
Hoover-sponsored conferences
which preceded them between
196 4 and 19 71 : scholarly papers
followed by ample time for
questions and answers. As in the
past, there was no charge for
admission.
Prof. Giraud's pre-judgments
that the event was "obviously
one-sided" and provided "no
mechanism for the testing of
ideas" were belied by the content
of the papers actually presented,
and by the grace and reflectivity
with which most speakers met
their critics' challenges from the
floor.
Lacking information and
resolved to reach his
pre-determined conclusions, Prof.
Giraud created a plot that did not
exist. Once again, a man whose
mind was made up refused to risk
having it changed by the facts.

I have noticed recently, for
example in questions asked at the
Franklin hearing and in the Daily
article on the SWOPSI course on
DOD sponsored research, the
tendency to imply that because
the descriptions of research
projects supplied by the chief
investigator at Stanford and the
sponsoring agency are quite
different, this comprises evidence
of an attempt to cover up

activities which might be
unpopular on campus.
It seems to me that this
attitude displays an ignorance of
the basic philosophy and content
of most good academic research in
the sciences and engineering. Such
research seeks to generate an
understanding of physical
phenomena and/or to develop
methods of applying such
knowledge to technological
problems. Precisely because the
best of such work has broad
implications, the description

presented by a sponsoring agency
justifying their expenditure is
likely to be quite different from
that of another agency with a
different mission, or from a
description written by the
principal investigator.
Stanford has an outstanding
research activity in science and
engineering, and I have the
impression that those of us
involved are working on
essentially the same problems that
we would be struggling with even
if the University had the resources
to cover our research costs,
student support and salaries,
without the need for us to seek
outside sponsorship.
The ideas which appear in our

self generated, and a description

amply—and for this I take full
responsibility.
For the record, Campus Report
carried the conference in its
calendar of Oct. 13, giving dates,
times and topics but deleting
speakers' names in order to
conserve space.
On Oct. 7 and 8, interim
typewritten programs had been
mailed to institutions and
individuals in the Bay Area. One
of the Iranian student leaders told
me of the receipt of such a leaflet
at Berkeley Oct. 12—again nearly
a week before the conference
opened. When printed programs
were ready Oct. 14, thev were
immediately disseminated to
Stanford departments and
individuals.
Til ere was no conspiracy of
silence. Surely it would not have
been indulged by Tresidder
Union, which gives highest

priority to public meetings from
which students can benefit. To
the rumor—spread by Jim Shoch
in his Daily column of Oct.
18—that "members of the militant
Iranian Students Association have
been barred from the
conference," I can only ask: How
could such exclusion have been
enforced at a free and open
meeting?
The sessions on Iran were
organized along the lines of four
Hoover-sponsored conferences
which preceded them between
196 4 and 19 71 : scholarly papers
followed by ample time for
questions and answers. As in the
past, there was no charge for
admission.
Prof. Giraud's pre-judgments
that the event was "obviously
one-sided" and provided "no
mechanism for the testing of
ideas" were belied by the content
of the papers actually presented,
and by the grace and reflectivity
with which most speakers met
their critics' challenges from the
floor.
Lacking information and
resolved to reach his
pre-determined conclusions, Prof.
Giraud created a plot that did not
exist. Once again, a man whose
mind was made up refused to risk
having it changed by the facts.

Editor, THE DAILY:
In reference to the article that
appeared in the Daily Friday,
October 22, 1971 under the title,
"Can't We Still Be Friends?". I
would like to say, insofar as,
1. I have had the outline of
certain portions of the male
anatomy burned on my door.
2. All my friends that are
women now think my first name
is "chauvinist".
3. The ten phone calls
suggesting that I have a lobotomy
as soon as I recover from my
castration opertion.
4. My mother thinks it is great
to see her darting son's name in
print.
5. The thirteen phone calls
suggesting that the calluses on my
hand are not from knocking on
doors.
in my own defense that:
A. I did not write or have any
prior knowledge of the article
"Can't We Still Be Friends?"
B. The article does not reflect my

Editor, THE DAILY:
I have noticed recently, for
example in questions asked at the
Franklin hearing and in the Daily
article on the SWOPSI course on
DOD sponsored research, the
tendency to imply that because
the descriptions of research
projects supplied by the chief
investigator at Stanford and the
sponsoring agency are quite
different, this comprises evidence
of an attempt to cover up

activities which might be
unpopular on campus.
It seems to me that this
attitude displays an ignorance of
the basic philosophy and content
of most good academic research in
the sciences and engineering. Such
research seeks to generate an
understanding of physical
phenomena and/or to develop
methods of applying such
knowledge to technological
problems. Precisely because the
best of such work has broad
implications, the description

presented by a sponsoring agency
justifying their expenditure is
likely to be quite different from
that of another agency with a
different mission, or from a
description written by the
principal investigator.
Stanford has an outstanding
research activity in science and
engineering, and I have the
impression that those of us
involved are working on
essentially the same problems that
we would be struggling with even
if the University had the resources
to cover our research costs,
student support and salaries,
without the need for us to seek
outside sponsorship.
The ideas which appear in our
research proposals are commonly
self generated, and a description
in basic academic terms does
accurately iepresent the activity
from our, and the University's,
standpoint. This is not to say that,
on occasion, an academic
researcher may not wish to
emphasise some particular

application of particular interest
to a sponsor, though his
involvement as a faculty member
is concerned with the more
general approach.
Stanford's development in the
last twenty-five years has
prescribed that much of our
educational and research activity
has an under-pinning of sponsored
research projects. In view of the
budget situation, this
circumstance will clearly have to
be retained in the years
immediately ahead if we are to
meet bold educational objectives.
It is therefore extremely
important that the whole
Stanford community has a correct
understanding of what is involved,
and that misconceptions are not
permitted to cause dissension.

I reply to the unfounded
charges of Prof. Raymond Giraud
(Daily, Oct. 18) that the recent
Hoover Institution conference on
Iran was deliberately left
"unpublicized" as part of a
scheme to insulate the meeting
from public debate and thus "to
develop propagandistic support
for the government of the Shah."
Perhaps more than Prof.
Giraud I regret that the Daily and
the off-campus media of general
circulation chose not to print
advance announcements of the
conference. One of the Daily's

with a full program nearly a week
