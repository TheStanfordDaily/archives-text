# More On The Fee Assessment Referendums...

On the ballot this week
students will find a referendum
for a special $1.00 fee assessment
Winter and Spring Quarters for
the Minority Affairs Commission.
I unequivocally support this
referendum.
The money raised by this
assessment will be used by the
Black Students Union, the Asian
American Student Association,
Mecha, and the American Indian
Alliance in a carefully delineated
budget for educational and
cultural programs, both on the
campus, and in the outlying
minority communities. Many of
these programs—such as the BSU's
college day program in which
black high school students are
brought to Stanford—are on-going
community projects which have
been funded in the past by the
Student Senate. If these programs
must be terminated now for lack
of funds, many people in the
community who have come to
look forward to them will be

needlessly disappointed.
Many of the cultural programs
would be new. This would
especially be so for the American
Indian Alliance, which is relatively
new at Stanford, and would like
to sponsor activities through
which it might more fully become
a part of the Stanford
community.
Lask year when I was
campaigning for the Council of
Presidents I found two things that
distressed me. One was the feeling
that all student organizations
should be denied any money (the
$0 assessment) because some
people didn't like some of the
ones that were getting money and
didn't know how the money was
being spent. Well, this referendum
effectively deals with that
concern. Now you know exactly
what organizations are getting the
money, and how much. And you
know what kinds of activities the
money will be limitied to:
minority educational and cultural
programs—most of them on-going

yearly activities—and legal defense
funds for needy students.
Another thing that concerned
me last Spring was the racist
attitudes of many white students
who voted for a $0 fee assessment
because they thought minority
students were getting too much
power on the campus. This is a
diseased kind of argument. These
are worthy programs that many
people on campus and in the
community have become involved
in. They are programs that are
expanding minority consciousness
and exciting the minority
communities about higher
education in a very positive way.
They are programs that have no
other way of being funded.
If Stanford students are able to
dig into their hearts and pockets
to send the Stanford Band around
the country. I believe they can dig
at least as deep to fund a Minority
Affairs Commission. I'm not
ready to believe that the pleadings
of a sick, racist minority of the
student body will be able to

defeat the worthy programs
embodied in this referendum.
I urge a YES vote on the
Minority Affairs Commission.

A lot of misinformation has
been circulated on campus about
the two fee assessments on the

ballot for the upcoming Senate
elections. It is difficult to know
where to start to correct some of
the damage which has been done.
The fee assessment for the
Minority Students groups is
perhaps the most controversial. A
great deal of malicious comment

has been made about this
proposed assessment. First, I
would like to state that I am
firmly in support of the proposal.
It is essential that minority
students at Stanford be supported
in their efforts to combat the
alienation and depression that
many of them experience when

roVNciiMCTCi

they come to this predominately
white, upper middle class campus.
On a personal basis, BSU,
Mecha, AASA and the American
Indian association provide
reinforcement for minority
students on campus which could
not be provided any other way.
As a sponsor in Wilbur last year, I
came into contact with many
minority freshmen, and realized
how important a cohesive group
such as the BSU was to them.
Many students on campus want
a break down of where their
dollar would go. I can understand
why this feeling is prevalent.
However, if one accepts the idea
that Minority students are best
qualified to decide what would be
of the most value to their own
communities, then such a demand
for accountability seems
superfluous.

It is not difficult to find out
where the money will be going.
The leadership of all the groups
involved are not trying to keep
such information from the general
public, and I would suggest that if
people want to know where their
money is going they should ask
these people. Certainly they wHI
get a better accounting of where
their dollar will go than the
accounting that they now get of
where their $800 goes every
quarter when it is fed into the till
of Stanford University.
The Child Care Center
assessment has also been maligned
considerably. In the Daily of
October 25 there is an article
which corrects much of what has
been alleged. I would just like to
comment that the assessment is
not a new idea. The University has
refused to fund the Child Care
Center and they have been trying
to find alternate sources of
funding for months. I met with
these people early in the summer
and was appalled at the complete
lack of sensitivity which they had
encountered among members of
the administration.
Day Care is essential if one is at
all serious about providing women
with a chance to improve their
position in society. Recently the
Child Care Center has published a
complete report on their

operations for the last year. 1
would urge students who are
interested to read this report. A
copy is available in our office for
public perusal.
Students must realize that they
are part of a community at
Stanford. This community needs
many different services. As in any
community, when the
bureaucracy which governs is
unresponsive, it becomes
necessary for the people to either
assess themselves or go without. I
believe the services provided by
the proposed assessments are
crucial and require such subsidy.
