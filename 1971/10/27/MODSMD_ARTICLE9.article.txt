# ...And Another Perspective

It was interesting but somewhat disappointing to read the
shouting-match going on in the Daily the last few days over the Fee
Assessments. Disappointing in that good points where brought up by
all the authors, but none of these were explored in any manner. I
agree with Anne Murphy ("Child Care Assessments," Thursday's
Daily) that informing the student body about the various assessments
does not mean they will be voted down.
However, I must back Michael Fancher ("Fee Assessments,"
Tuesday's Daily) in his pointing out that these assessments have not
been publicized. As I recall, the largest article I have seen in the Daily
about either fee assessment is Anne Murphy's article. The article, by
the way, tells you only the amount of the child care assessment. The
posters on the kiosks have been even less illuminating. Concerning the
second fee assessment, I have learned even less. I know the amount
and to whom it goes. . . that's all!
Although $1 per quarter does not seem like much (unless you have
to work for it!), when you add up the whole student body it's quite a
lot. The groups involved in the assessments stand to gain $5,000 to
$10,000 each. I don't feel that this kind of money should be handed
out to anybody without first asking a few questions and possibly

adding some safeguards to see that the money actually gets spent in
the manner in which it was intended.
One matter is defining who the group serves, how large is it's
membership, and what services and activities it performs. Any group
asking the student body for a fee assessment should present a budget
describing it's usage. If that organization has previously been in
existence, they should also present past expense listings so that
students may view what they have done in the past. Most important,
sufficient safeguards should be installed to see that the money
actually gets spent as budgeted.
Information and Safeguards like these are necessary! All returning
students remember when last year's ASSU Senate attempted to place
ASSU reserve funds in the bail fund over and against the vote of the
student body! No legitimate group asking for student financial
support should have any qualms over giving out such information and
accepting any attached safeguards.
It may well be that most (maybe even all) of the above
information is available if one goes around to each group and asks.
But must each student do this on his own? Since the groups
requesting assessments stand to gain so much, I fail to see any excuse
why the effort required to get this information to the student body
was not given. I disagree entirely with Diane Fields ("More on Fee
Election," Thursday's Daily) that this is the job of Elections
Commissioner Alice Furumoto or even Michael Fancher. The group
asking for the assessment ought to know its business better than
anyone else!
I was particularly amused at Diane Fields' description of how fee
assessments are defeated. It would seem to me that if the various
groups requesting assessments properly informed the student body,
then no amoung of her "s— sheet" campaigning would damage their
case. At the moment I can only agree with the "s— sheeters."

concerning Ihe referendums were printed in the Daily this week.

the manner in which it was intended.
One matter is defining who the group serves, how large is it's
membership, and what services and activities it performs. Any group
asking the student body for a fee assessment should present a budget
describing it's usage. If that organization has previously been in
existence, they should also present past expense listings so that
students may view what they have done in the past. Most important,
sufficient safeguards should be installed to see that the money
actually gets spent as budgeted.
Information and Safeguards like these are necessary! All returning
students remember when last year's ASSU Senate attempted to place
ASSU reserve funds in the bail fund over and against the vote of the
student body! No legitimate group asking for student financial
support should have any qualms over giving out such information and
accepting any attached safeguards.
It may well be that most (maybe even all) of the above
information is available if one goes around to each group and asks.
But must each student do this on his own? Since the groups
requesting assessments stand to gain so much, I fail to see any excuse
why the effort required to get this information to the student body
was not given. I disagree entirely with Diane Fields ("More on Fee
Election," Thursday's Daily) that this is the job of Elections
Commissioner Alice Furumoto or even Michael Fancher. The group
asking for the assessment ought to know its business better than
anyone else!
I was particularly amused at Diane Fields' description of how fee
assessments are defeated. It would seem to me that if the various
groups requesting assessments properly informed the student body,
then no amoung of her "s— sheet" campaigning would damage their
case. At the moment I can only agree with the "s— sheeters."
Editor's Note: This column was written before two columns
concerning Ihe referendums were printed in the Daily this week.

It was interesting but somewhat disappointing to read the
shouting-match going on in the Daily the last few days over the Fee
Assessments. Disappointing in that good points where brought up by
all the authors, but none of these were explored in any manner. I
agree with Anne Murphy ("Child Care Assessments," Thursday's
Daily) that informing the student body about the various assessments
does not mean they will be voted down.
However, I must back Michael Fancher ("Fee Assessments,"
Tuesday's Daily) in his pointing out that these assessments have not
been publicized. As I recall, the largest article I have seen in the Daily
about either fee assessment is Anne Murphy's article. The article, by
the way, tells you only the amount of the child care assessment. The
posters on the kiosks have been even less illuminating. Concerning the
second fee assessment, I have learned even less. I know the amount
and to whom it goes. . . that's all!
Although $1 per quarter does not seem like much (unless you have
to work for it!), when you add up the whole student body it's quite a
lot. The groups involved in the assessments stand to gain $5,000 to
$10,000 each. I don't feel that this kind of money should be handed
out to anybody without first asking a few questions and possibly

adding some safeguards to see that the money actually gets spent in
the manner in which it was intended.
