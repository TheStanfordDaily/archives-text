# Reforms Debated
## Controversy Stalls SJC 
### BOB MICHELET First in a two-part series 
The Stanford Judicial Council—a
body created out of a period of conflict
and student dissent—is once again the
focus of a controversy, not as the
solution but rather, this time, as the
problem.
Formed after a spring, 1968, Old
Union sit-in protesting judicial
procedures for students, the SJC is at
present unable to deal with pending
cases due to the refusal of the ASSU
Student Senate to appoint a committee
to select the four student SJC
members.
The roots of the problem lie,
however, not solely with the Senate's
inaction, but with student demands for
wide-ranging reforms of the
controversial council.
Prominent among reform advocates
is ASSU Council of Presidents member
Doug McHenry, who claims that "the
present system is not one that reflects
the needs and desires of a significant
portion of the student body."
He cites in support of his claim a
student referendum last spring that
approved the advocacy of three basic
reforms of the council.
He claims additional faults of the
SJC, among them that the system does
not protect defendants from "double

jeopardy," and that the President has
ultimate power over SJC decisions.
"There is a question of defining
what is democratic in this institution
and what is academic," McHenry says,
adding that "the SJC does not
represent (the) concept" of a
democratic judicial process.
The university administration has
pressed, since last spring, for Senate
action on appointment of student
members, but action appears stalled
until a new Senate acts or the question
of reform is settled (both unlikely).
John Schwartz, a Special Assistant
to the President, says the
administration does not agree with the
proposed reforms, but, even if it did,
feels that normal channels should be
used for change rather than the current
Senate tactics.
Suggested Reforms
The three basic reforms suggested
are that 1) the SJC have jurisdiction
over faculty as well as student cases; 2)
the SJC should not be able to try
students already involved in felony
cases outside the university; and 3) the
President's powers over the council be
reduced and that its decisions be final
(rather than just being
"recommendations" to the President).
These changes, McHenry says, are
intended to further the ideal that the

SJC operate in a more democratic
manner. "It comes down to the fact
that people should not be powerless in
the university. Some areas should be
democratic."
In responding to the criticisms,
Schwartz says the administration is
taking no position on the faculty
question, but cites the fact that a 1968
Faculty Senate resolution placing
faculty under the SJC was never
approved by the Academic Council,
student body or the President.
In answer to the charges of "double
jeopardy" (students tried in both
criminal court and the SJC for the same
offense), Schwartz argues that the
university must have the separate
power to deal with on-campus violations
of campus rules.
Discipline by the SJC, it is argued, is
just one of many consequences of an
illegal act, and analogous to a situation
in which a doctor, sued for malpractice
by a client, may also be punished for
the same act by his professional
organization.
Curbing Powers
As for curbing the President's
powers, Schwartz says it may be legally
impossible for the President to pass off
his power, and that, even were it
possible, it would not be desirable.
He claims the present deadlock is an
example of how "the system falls apart
at the whim of the Student Senate,"
and argues that without a President
empowered to act in cases of
emergency, the system would be
additionally faulted.
Schwartz further rebutts the charges
by noting that in the more than 60
cases that have come from the SJC
during his term, President Lyman has
never overturned a decision, acting only
twice—once at a defendant's request
and again to clarify a point.
The President feels, Schwartz says,
that if the judicial system is to work,
the power of overruling must be used
"most sparingly and in cases in which
there is manifest neglect by the SJC."

offense), Schwartz argues that the
university must have the separate
power to deal with on-campus violations
of campus rules.
Discipline by the SJC, it is argued, is
just one of many consequences of an
illegal act, and analogous to a situation
in which a doctor, sued for malpractice
by a client, may also be punished for
the same act by his professional
organization.
Curbing Powers
As for curbing the President's
powers, Schwartz says it may be legally
impossible for the President to pass off
his power, and that, even were it
possible, it would not be desirable.
He claims the present deadlock is an
example of how "the system falls apart
at the whim of the Student Senate,"
and argues that without a President
empowered to act in cases of
emergency, the system would be
additionally faulted.
Schwartz further rebutts the charges
by noting that in the more than 60
cases that have come from the SJC
during his term, President Lyman has
never overturned a decision, acting only
twice—once at a defendant's request
and again to clarify a point.
The President feels, Schwartz says,
that if the judicial system is to work,
the power of overruling must be used
"most sparingly and in cases in which
there is manifest neglect by the SJC."
(Next: A third viewpoint).
The Stanford Judicial Council—a
body created out of a period of conflict
and student dissent—is once again the
focus of a controversy, not as the
solution but rather, this time, as the
problem.
Formed after a spring, 1968, Old
Union sit-in protesting judicial
procedures for students, the SJC is at
present unable to deal with pending
cases due to the refusal of the ASSU
Student Senate to appoint a committee
to select the four student SJC
members.
The roots of the problem lie,
however, not solely with the Senate's
inaction, but with student demands for
wide-ranging reforms of the
controversial council.
Prominent among reform advocates
is ASSU Council of Presidents member
Doug McHenry, who claims that "the
present system is not one that reflects
the needs and desires of a significant
portion of the student body."
He cites in support of his claim a
student referendum last spring that
approved the advocacy of three basic
reforms of the council.
He claims additional faults of the
SJC, among them that the system does
not protect defendants from "double

jeopardy," and that the President has
ultimate power over SJC decisions.
"There is a question of defining
what is democratic in this institution
and what is academic," McHenry says,
adding that "the SJC does not
represent (the) concept" of a
democratic judicial process.
The university administration has
pressed, since last spring, for Senate
action on appointment of student
members, but action appears stalled
until a new Senate acts or the question
of reform is settled (both unlikely).
John Schwartz, a Special Assistant
to the President, says the
administration does not agree with the
proposed reforms, but, even if it did,
feels that normal channels should be
used for change rather than the current
Senate tactics.
Suggested Reforms
The three basic reforms suggested
are that 1) the SJC have jurisdiction
over faculty as well as student cases; 2)
the SJC should not be able to try
students already involved in felony
cases outside the university; and 3) the
President's powers over the council be
reduced and that its decisions be final
(rather than just being
"recommendations" to the President).
These changes, McHenry says, are
intended to further the ideal that the

SJC operate in a more democratic
manner. "It comes down to the fact
that people should not be powerless in
the university. Some areas should be
democratic."
In responding to the criticisms,
Schwartz says the administration is
taking no position on the faculty
question, but cites the fact that a 1968
Faculty Senate resolution placing
faculty under the SJC was never
approved by the Academic Council,
student body or the President.
In answer to the charges of "double
jeopardy" (students tried in both
criminal court and the SJC for the same
offense), Schwartz argues that the
university must have the separate
power to deal with on-campus violations
of campus rules.
Discipline by the SJC, it is argued, is
just one of many consequences of an
illegal act, and analogous to a situation
in which a doctor, sued for malpractice
