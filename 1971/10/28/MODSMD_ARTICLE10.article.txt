No Silly Prank
Editor, THE DAILY:
For the most part, I believe old
alumni should leave an alma mater
pretty much alone (except for
occasional financial
contributions). I particularly
object to doddering old fools

wjriting letters to the
student newspaper telling students
how the university should be
run—as if students should have
anything to do with running a
great private university.
But I have recently heard of
Leonard Siegel's campaign for
Dean of Engineering at Stanford,
the position held most recently by
my late mentor, Dr. Pettit. I
cannot refrain from comment.
Mr. Siegel's candidacy is no
silly prank. An old classmate of
mine, now well advanced in
government service, has learned
that Mr. Siegel is serious about
forcing the administration into
holding a so-called "democratic
election" for Dean of Engineering.
Once the election is held, Mr.
Siegel plans to win it.

According to our government's
intelligence, he has recently
received a large sum of money
from Hanoi. The money was
supposedly given to Mr. Siegel for
the "humanitarian" purpose of
saving the lives of the Communist
North Vietnamese by "exposing
war research" done at Stanford.
But that smear was published
with other funds, under the
supposed authorship of a SWOPSI
undergraduate seminar. The
money from Hanoi actually was
pocketed by Mr. Siegel, or rather
by an organization in which he
holds membership, the
Association of Young Crows.
They plan to use it for campaign
expenses.
Dr. Campbell, director of the
Hoover Institution, said a few

days ago at the H. Bruce Franklin
hearing that he had no special
objection to Communists teaching
natural sciences. I was amazed and
even shocked to hear of this
testimony. Would Dr. Campbell
have an Engineering School run
by Hanoi?

SWOPSI Clarification
Editor, THE DAILY:
I would like to clarify certain
aspects of the article entitled
SWOPSI Course Discusses Army
Fragging and Franklin Case which
appeared on page four of the
October 26, 1971 Stanford Daily.
The relationship between SWOPSI

11l Unrest in the Academy: the
Case of Bruce Franklin and those
speaking in behalf of Billy Smith
was accidental.
Both SWOPSI 111 and the
supporters of Billy Smith were
scheduled unintentionally for the
same meeting time and place. This
mishap created an embarassing
situation for all present and the
principals involved carried on as
best they could.
The Daily article under
discussion gives the erroneous
impression that the Smith
supporters and their presentation
were an organized part of SWOPSI
111. This is certainly not the case
and I hope that this letter clears
up any misunderstandings.

speaking in behalf of Billy Smith
was accidental.
Both SWOPSI 111 and the
supporters of Billy Smith were
scheduled unintentionally for the
same meeting time and place. This
mishap created an embarassing
situation for all present and the
principals involved carried on as
best they could.
The Daily article under
discussion gives the erroneous
impression that the Smith
supporters and their presentation
were an organized part of SWOPSI
111. This is certainly not the case
and I hope that this letter clears
up any misunderstandings.

No Silly Prank
Editor, THE DAILY:
For the most part, I believe old
alumni should leave an alma mater
pretty much alone (except for
occasional financial
contributions). I particularly
object to doddering old fools

wjriting letters to the
student newspaper telling students
how the university should be
run—as if students should have
anything to do with running a
great private university.
But I have recently heard of
Leonard Siegel's campaign for
Dean of Engineering at Stanford,
the position held most recently by
my late mentor, Dr. Pettit. I
cannot refrain from comment.
Mr. Siegel's candidacy is no
silly prank. An old classmate of
mine, now well advanced in
government service, has learned
that Mr. Siegel is serious about
forcing the administration into
holding a so-called "democratic
election" for Dean of Engineering.
Once the election is held, Mr.
Siegel plans to win it.

According to our government's
intelligence, he has recently
received a large sum of money
from Hanoi. The money was
supposedly given to Mr. Siegel for
the "humanitarian" purpose of
saving the lives of the Communist
North Vietnamese by "exposing
war research" done at Stanford.
But that smear was published
with other funds, under the
supposed authorship of a SWOPSI
undergraduate seminar. The
money from Hanoi actually was
pocketed by Mr. Siegel, or rather
by an organization in which he
holds membership, the
Association of Young Crows.
They plan to use it for campaign
expenses.
Dr. Campbell, director of the
Hoover Institution, said a few

days ago at the H. Bruce Franklin
hearing that he had no special
objection to Communists teaching
natural sciences. I was amazed and
even shocked to hear of this
testimony. Would Dr. Campbell
have an Engineering School run
by Hanoi?
