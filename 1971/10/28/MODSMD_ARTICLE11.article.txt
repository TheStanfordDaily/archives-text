## Biology & Complementarity: Two False Arguments 
### 
The biological argument advanced to counter
the claim that America subverts the individuality
and self-fulfillment of its women suggests that
there may really be inborn differences between
men and women in, say, independence or
mathematical ability. Or that there may be
biological factors beyond the fact that women
can become pregnant and nurse children which
uniquely dictate that they, but not men, should
stay home all day and shun serious outside
commitment.
Maybe female hormones really are responsible
somehow. One difficulty with this argument, of
course, is that female hormones would have to be
different in the Soviet Union, where one-third of
the engineers and 75% of the physicians are
women. In America, women constitute less than
1% of the engineers and only 7% of the
physicians (Dodge, 1966).
Female physiology is different, and it may
account for some of the psychological
differences between the sexes, but America's
sex-role ideology still seems primarily responsible
for the fact that so few women emerge from
childhood with the motivation to seek out any
role beyond the one that our society dictates.
But even if there really were biological
differences between the sexes along these lines,
the biological argument would still be irrelevant.
The irony of the biological argument is that it
does not take biological differences seriously
enough. That is, it fails to recognize the range of
biological differences between individuals within
the same sex. Thus, recent research has revealed
that biological factors help determine many
personality traits. Dominance and
submissiveness, for example, have been found to
have large inheritable components; in other
words, biological factors do have the potential
for partially determining how dominant or
submissive an individual, male or female, will
turn out to be.
But the effects of this biological potential

could be detected only in males (Gottesman,
1963). This implies that only the males in our
culture are raised with sufficient flexibility, with
sufficient latitude given to their biological
differences, for their "natural" or biologically
determined potential to shine through. Females,
on the other hand, are subjected to a socializtion
which so ignores their unique attributes that even
the effects of biology seem to be swamped. In
sum, the biological argument for continuing

Females are subjected to a
socialization which so ignores their
unique attributes that even the effects
of biology seem to be swamped.

America's homogenization of its women gets
hoist with its own petard.
Many people recognize that most women do
end up as full-time homemakers because of their
socialization and that these women do exemplify
the failure of our society to raise girls as unique
individuals. But, they point out, the role of the
homemaker is not inferior to the role of the
professional man: it is complementary but equal.
This argument is usually bolstered by pointing
to the joys and importance of taking care of
small children. Indeed, mothers and fathers find
child-rearing rewarding, and it is certainly
important. But this argument becomes
insufficient when one considers that the average
American woman now lives to age 74 and has her
last child at about age 26; thus, by the time the
women is 33 or so, her children all have more
important things to do with their daytime hours
than to spend them entertaining an adult woman
who has nothing to do during the second half of
her life span.
As for the other "joys" of homemaking, many

writers (e.g., Friedan, 1963) have persuasively
argued that the role of the homemaker has been
glamorized far beyond its intrinsic worth. This
charge becomes plausible when one considers
that the average American homemaker spends
the equivalent of a man's working day, 7.1 hours,
in preparing meals, cleaning house, laundering,
mending, shopping, and doing other household
tasks. In other words, 43% of her waking time is
spent in activity that would command an hourly
wage on the open market well below the
federally-set minimum for menial industrial
work.
The point is not how little she would earn if
she did these things in someone else's home, but
that this use of time is virtually the same for
homemakers with college degrees and for those
with less than a grade school education, for
women married to professional men and for
women married to blue-collar workers. Talent,
education, ability, interests, motivations: all are
irrelevant. In our society, being female uniquely
qualifies an individual for domestic work.
It is true, of course, that the American
homemaker has, on the average, 5.1 hours of
leisure time per day, and it is here, we are told,
that each woman can express her unique
identity. Thus, politically interested women can
join the league of Women Voters; women with
humane interests can became part-time Gray
Ladies; women who love music can raise money
for the symphony. Protestant women play
Canasta; Jewish women play Mah-Jongg; brighter
women of all denominations and faculty wives
play bridge; and so forth.
But politically interested men serve in
legislatures; men with humane interests become
physicians or clinical psychologists; men who
love music play in the symphony; and so forth.
In other words, why should a woman's unique
identity determine only the periphery of her life
rather than its central core?
Again, the important point is not that the role

of homemaker is necessarily inferior, but that the
woman's unique identity has been rendered
irrelevant. Consider the following "predictability
test." When a boy is born, it is difficult to
predict what he will be doing 25 years later. We
cannot say whether he will be an artist, a doctor,
or a college professor because he will be
permitted to develop and to fulfill his own
unique potential, particularly if he is white and
middleclass. But if the newborn child is a girl, we
can usually predict with confidence how she will

the women's magazines and television
commercials portray it, then men,
too, should have that option.

be spending her time 25 years later. Her
individuality doesn't have to be considered; it is
irrelevant.
The socialization of the American male has
closed off certain options for him too. Men are
discouraged from developing certain desirable
traits such as tenderness and sensitivity just as
surely as women are discouraged from being
assertive and, also, "too bright." Young boys are
encouraged to be incompetent at cooking and
child care just as surely as young girls are urged
to be incompetent at mathematics and science.
Indeed, one of the errors of the early feminist
movement in this country was that it assumed
that men had all the goodies and that women
could attain self-fulfillment merely be being like
men. But that is hardly the Utopia implied by the
values of individuality and self-fulfillment.
Rather, these values would require society to
raise its children so flexibly and with sufficient
respect for the integrity of individual uniqueness
that some men might emerge with the
motiviation, the ability, and the opportunity to

sandra bem and daryl bem

stay home and raise children without bearing the
stigma of being peculier.
If homemaking is as glamorous as the
women's magazines and television commercials
portray it, then men, too, should have that
option. Even if homemaking isn't all that
glamorous, it would probably still be more
fulfilling for some men than the jobs in which
they now find themselves.
And if biological differences really do exist
between men and women in "nurturance," in
their inborn motivations to care for children,
then this will show up automatically in the final
distribution of men and women across the
various roles: relatively fewer men will choose to
stay at home.
The values of individuality and self-fulfillment
do not imply that there must be equality of
outcome, an equal number of men and women in
each role, but that there should be the widest
possible variation in outcome consistent with the
range of individual differences among people,
regardless of sex.
At the very least, these values imply that
society should raise its males so that they ~ould
freely engage in activities that might pay less
than those being pursued by their wives without
feeling that they were "living off their wives,"
One rarely hears it said of a woman that she is
"living off her husband."
Thus, it is true that a man's options, are
limited by our society's sex-role ideology, but as
the "predictability test" reveals, it is still the
woman in our society whose identity is rendered
irrelevant by America's socialization practices. In
1954, the United States Supreme Court declared
that a fraud and hoax lay behind the slogan
"separate but equal." It is unlikely that any
court will ever do the same for the more subtle
motto that successfully keeps the woman in her
place: "complementary but equal."

assertive and, also, "too bright." Young boys are
encouraged to be incompetent at cooking and
child care just as surely as young girls are urged
to be incompetent at mathematics and science.
Indeed, one of the errors of the early feminist
movement in this country was that it assumed
that men had all the goodies and that women
could attain self-fulfillment merely be being like
men. But that is hardly the Utopia implied by the
values of individuality and self-fulfillment.
Rather, these values would require society to
raise its children so flexibly and with sufficient
respect for the integrity of individual uniqueness
that some men might emerge with the
motiviation, the ability, and the opportunity to

stay home and raise children without bearing the
stigma of being peculier.
If homemaking is as glamorous as the
women's magazines and television commercials
portray it, then men, too, should have that
option. Even if homemaking isn't all that
glamorous, it would probably still be more
fulfilling for some men than the jobs in which
they now find themselves.
And if biological differences really do exist
between men and women in "nurturance," in
their inborn motivations to care for children,
then this will show up automatically in the final
distribution of men and women across the
various roles: relatively fewer men will choose to
stay at home.
The values of individuality and self-fulfillment
do not imply that there must be equality of
outcome, an equal number of men and women in
each role, but that there should be the widest
possible variation in outcome consistent with the
range of individual differences among people,
regardless of sex.
At the very least, these values imply that
society should raise its males so that they ~ould
freely engage in activities that might pay less
than those being pursued by their wives without
feeling that they were "living off their wives,"
One rarely hears it said of a woman that she is
"living off her husband."
Thus, it is true that a man's options, are
limited by our society's sex-role ideology, but as
the "predictability test" reveals, it is still the
woman in our society whose identity is rendered
irrelevant by America's socialization practices. In
1954, the United States Supreme Court declared
that a fraud and hoax lay behind the slogan
"separate but equal." It is unlikely that any
court will ever do the same for the more subtle
motto that successfully keeps the woman in her
place: "complementary but equal."
Tomorrow: Interpersonal Equality
(Sandra Bem and Daryl Bem are members of the

The biological argument advanced to counter
the claim that America subverts the individuality
and self-fulfillment of its women suggests that
there may really be inborn differences between
men and women in, say, independence or
mathematical ability. Or that there may be
biological factors beyond the fact that women
can become pregnant and nurse children which
uniquely dictate that they, but not men, should
stay home all day and shun serious outside
commitment.
Maybe female hormones really are responsible
somehow. One difficulty with this argument, of
course, is that female hormones would have to be
different in the Soviet Union, where one-third of
the engineers and 75% of the physicians are
women. In America, women constitute less than
1% of the engineers and only 7% of the
physicians (Dodge, 1966).
Female physiology is different, and it may
account for some of the psychological
differences between the sexes, but America's
sex-role ideology still seems primarily responsible
for the fact that so few women emerge from
childhood with the motivation to seek out any
role beyond the one that our society dictates.
But even if there really were biological
differences between the sexes along these lines,
the biological argument would still be irrelevant.
The irony of the biological argument is that it
does not take biological differences seriously
enough. That is, it fails to recognize the range of
biological differences between individuals within
the same sex. Thus, recent research has revealed
that biological factors help determine many
personality traits. Dominance and
submissiveness, for example, have been found to
have large inheritable components; in other
words, biological factors do have the potential
for partially determining how dominant or
submissive an individual, male or female, will
turn out to be.
But the effects of this biological potential

could be detected only in males (Gottesman,
1963). This implies that only the males in our
culture are raised with sufficient flexibility, with
sufficient latitude given to their biological
differences, for their "natural" or biologically
determined potential to shine through. Females,
on the other hand, are subjected to a socializtion
which so ignores their unique attributes that even
the effects of biology seem to be swamped. In
sum, the biological argument for continuing

Females are subjected to a
socialization which so ignores their
unique attributes that even the effects
of biology seem to be swamped.

America's homogenization of its women gets
hoist with its own petard.
Many people recognize that most women do
end up as full-time homemakers because of their
socialization and that these women do exemplify
the failure of our society to raise girls as unique
individuals. But, they point out, the role of the
homemaker is not inferior to the role of the
professional man: it is complementary but equal.
This argument is usually bolstered by pointing
to the joys and importance of taking care of
small children. Indeed, mothers and fathers find
child-rearing rewarding, and it is certainly
important. But this argument becomes
insufficient when one considers that the average
American woman now lives to age 74 and has her
last child at about age 26; thus, by the time the
women is 33 or so, her children all have more
important things to do with their daytime hours
than to spend them entertaining an adult woman
who has nothing to do during the second half of
her life span.
As for the other "joys" of homemaking, many

writers (e.g., Friedan, 1963) have persuasively
argued that the role of the homemaker has been
glamorized far beyond its intrinsic worth. This
charge becomes plausible when one considers
that the average American homemaker spends
the equivalent of a man's working day, 7.1 hours,
in preparing meals, cleaning house, laundering,
mending, shopping, and doing other household
tasks. In other words, 43% of her waking time is
spent in activity that would command an hourly
wage on the open market well below the
federally-set minimum for menial industrial
work.
The point is not how little she would earn if
she did these things in someone else's home, but
that this use of time is virtually the same for
homemakers with college degrees and for those
with less than a grade school education, for
women married to professional men and for
women married to blue-collar workers. Talent,
education, ability, interests, motivations: all are
irrelevant. In our society, being female uniquely
qualifies an individual for domestic work.
It is true, of course, that the American
homemaker has, on the average, 5.1 hours of
leisure time per day, and it is here, we are told,
that each woman can express her unique
identity. Thus, politically interested women can
join the league of Women Voters; women with
humane interests can became part-time Gray
Ladies; women who love music can raise money
for the symphony. Protestant women play
Canasta; Jewish women play Mah-Jongg; brighter
women of all denominations and faculty wives
play bridge; and so forth.
But politically interested men serve in
legislatures; men with humane interests become
physicians or clinical psychologists; men who
love music play in the symphony; and so forth.
In other words, why should a woman's unique
identity determine only the periphery of her life
rather than its central core?
Again, the important point is not that the role

of homemaker is necessarily inferior, but that the
woman's unique identity has been rendered
irrelevant. Consider the following "predictability
test." When a boy is born, it is difficult to
predict what he will be doing 25 years later. We
cannot say whether he will be an artist, a doctor,
or a college professor because he will be
permitted to develop and to fulfill his own
unique potential, particularly if he is white and
middleclass. But if the newborn child is a girl, we
can usually predict with confidence how she will

individuality doesn't have to be considered; it is
irrelevant.
The socialization of the American male has
closed off certain options for him too. Men are
discouraged from developing certain desirable
traits such as tenderness and sensitivity just as
surely as women are discouraged from being
assertive and, also, "too bright." Young boys are
encouraged to be incompetent at cooking and
child care just as surely as young girls are urged
to be incompetent at mathematics and science.

mending, shopping, and doing other household
tasks. In other words, 43% of her waking time is
spent in activity that would command an hourly
wage on the open market well below the
federally-set minimum for menial industrial
work.
The point is not how little she would earn if
she did these things in someone else's home, but
that this use of time is virtually the same for
homemakers with college degrees and for those
with less than a grade school education, for
women married to professional men and for
women married to blue-collar workers. Talent,
education, ability, interests, motivations: all are
irrelevant. In our society, being female uniquely
qualifies an individual for domestic work.
It is true, of course, that the American
homemaker has, on the average, 5.1 hours of
leisure time per day, and it is here, we are told,
that each woman can express her unique
identity. Thus, politically interested women can
join the league of Women Voters; women with
humane interests can became part-time Gray
Ladies; women who love music can raise money
for the symphony. Protestant women play
Canasta; Jewish women play Mah-Jongg; brighter
women of all denominations and faculty wives
play bridge; and so forth.
But politically interested men serve in
legislatures; men with humane interests become
physicians or clinical psychologists; men who
love music play in the symphony; and so forth.
In other words, why should a woman's unique
identity determine only the periphery of her life
rather than its central core?
Again, the important point is not that the role

of homemaker is necessarily inferior, but that the
woman's unique identity has been rendered
irrelevant. Consider the following "predictability
test." When a boy is born, it is difficult to
predict what he will be doing 25 years later. We
cannot say whether he will be an artist, a doctor,
or a college professor because he will be
permitted to develop and to fulfill his own
unique potential, particularly if he is white and
middleclass. But if the newborn child is a girl, we
can usually predict with confidence how she will

be spending her time 25 years later. Her
individuality doesn't have to be considered; it is
irrelevant.
The socialization of the American male has
closed off certain options for him too. Men are
discouraged from developing certain desirable
traits such as tenderness and sensitivity just as
surely as women are discouraged from being
assertive and, also, "too bright." Young boys are
encouraged to be incompetent at cooking and
child care just as surely as young girls are urged
to be incompetent at mathematics and science.
Indeed, one of the errors of the early feminist
movement in this country was that it assumed
that men had all the goodies and that women
could attain self-fulfillment merely be being like
men. But that is hardly the Utopia implied by the
values of individuality and self-fulfillment.
Rather, these values would require society to
raise its children so flexibly and with sufficient
respect for the integrity of individual uniqueness
that some men might emerge with the
motiviation, the ability, and the opportunity to

sandra bem and daryl bem

stay home and raise children without bearing the
stigma of being peculier.
If homemaking is as glamorous as the
women's magazines and television commercials
portray it, then men, too, should have that
option. Even if homemaking isn't all that
glamorous, it would probably still be more
fulfilling for some men than the jobs in which
they now find themselves.
And if biological differences really do exist
between men and women in "nurturance," in
their inborn motivations to care for children,
then this will show up automatically in the final
distribution of men and women across the
various roles: relatively fewer men will choose to
stay at home.
The values of individuality and self-fulfillment
do not imply that there must be equality of
outcome, an equal number of men and women in
each role, but that there should be the widest
possible variation in outcome consistent with the
range of individual differences among people,
regardless of sex.
At the very least, these values imply that
society should raise its males so that they ~ould
freely engage in activities that might pay less
than those being pursued by their wives without
feeling that they were "living off their wives,"
One rarely hears it said of a woman that she is
"living off her husband."
Thus, it is true that a man's options, are
limited by our society's sex-role ideology, but as
the "predictability test" reveals, it is still the
woman in our society whose identity is rendered
irrelevant by America's socialization practices. In
1954, the United States Supreme Court declared
that a fraud and hoax lay behind the slogan
"separate but equal." It is unlikely that any
court will ever do the same for the more subtle
motto that successfully keeps the woman in her
place: "complementary but equal."

The biological argument advanced to counter
the claim that America subverts the individuality
and self-fulfillment of its women suggests that
there may really be inborn differences between
men and women in, say, independence or
mathematical ability. Or that there may be
biological factors beyond the fact that women
can become pregnant and nurse children which
uniquely dictate that they, but not men, should
stay home all day and shun serious outside
commitment.
Maybe female hormones really are responsible
somehow. One difficulty with this argument, of
course, is that female hormones would have to be
different in the Soviet Union, where one-third of
the engineers and 75% of the physicians are
women. In America, women constitute less than
1% of the engineers and only 7% of the
physicians (Dodge, 1966).
Female physiology is different, and it may
account for some of the psychological
differences between the sexes, but America's
sex-role ideology still seems primarily responsible
for the fact that so few women emerge from
childhood with the motivation to seek out any
role beyond the one that our society dictates.
But even if there really were biological
differences between the sexes along these lines,
the biological argument would still be irrelevant.
The irony of the biological argument is that it
does not take biological differences seriously
enough. That is, it fails to recognize the range of
biological differences between individuals within
the same sex. Thus, recent research has revealed
that biological factors help determine many
personality traits. Dominance and
submissiveness, for example, have been found to
have large inheritable components; in other
words, biological factors do have the potential
for partially determining how dominant or
submissive an individual, male or female, will
turn out to be.
But the effects of this biological potential

could be detected only in males (Gottesman,
1963). This implies that only the males in our
culture are raised with sufficient flexibility, with
sufficient latitude given to their biological
differences, for their "natural" or biologically
determined potential to shine through. Females,
on the other hand, are subjected to a socializtion
which so ignores their unique attributes that even
the effects of biology seem to be swamped. In
sum, the biological argument for continuing

Females are subjected to a
socialization which so ignores their
unique attributes that even the effects
of biology seem to be swamped.

America's homogenization of its women gets
hoist with its own petard.
Many people recognize that most women do
end up as full-time homemakers because of their
socialization and that these women do exemplify
the failure of our society to raise girls as unique
individuals. But, they point out, the role of the
homemaker is not inferior to the role of the
professional man: it is complementary but equal.
This argument is usually bolstered by pointing
to the joys and importance of taking care of
small children. Indeed, mothers and fathers find
child-rearing rewarding, and it is certainly
important. But this argument becomes
insufficient when one considers that the average
American woman now lives to age 74 and has her
last child at about age 26; thus, by the time the
women is 33 or so, her children all have more
important things to do with their daytime hours
than to spend them entertaining an adult woman
who has nothing to do during the second half of
her life span.
As for the other "joys" of homemaking, many

writers (e.g., Friedan, 1963) have persuasively
argued that the role of the homemaker has been
glamorized far beyond its intrinsic worth. This
charge becomes plausible when one considers
that the average American homemaker spends
the equivalent of a man's working day, 7.1 hours,
in preparing meals, cleaning house, laundering,
mending, shopping, and doing other household
tasks. In other words, 43% of her waking time is
spent in activity that would command an hourly
wage on the open market well below the
federally-set minimum for menial industrial
work.

she did these things in someone else's home, but

the biological argument would still be irrelevant.
The irony of the biological argument is that it
does not take biological differences seriously
enough. That is, it fails to recognize the range of
biological differences between individuals within
the same sex. Thus, recent research has revealed
that biological factors help determine many
personality traits. Dominance and
submissiveness, for example, have been found to
have large inheritable components; in other
words, biological factors do have the potential
for partially determining how dominant or
submissive an individual, male or female, will
turn out to be.
But the effects of this biological potential

could be detected only in males (Gottesman,
1963). This implies that only the males in our
culture are raised with sufficient flexibility, with
sufficient latitude given to their biological
differences, for their "natural" or biologically
determined potential to shine through. Females,
on the other hand, are subjected to a socializtion
which so ignores their unique attributes that even
the effects of biology seem to be swamped. In
sum, the biological argument for continuing

Females are subjected to a
socialization which so ignores their
unique attributes that even the effects
of biology seem to be swamped.

America's homogenization of its women gets
hoist with its own petard.
Many people recognize that most women do
end up as full-time homemakers because of their
socialization and that these women do exemplify
the failure of our society to raise girls as unique
individuals. But, they point out, the role of the
homemaker is not inferior to the role of the
professional man: it is complementary but equal.
This argument is usually bolstered by pointing
to the joys and importance of taking care of
small children. Indeed, mothers and fathers find
child-rearing rewarding, and it is certainly
important. But this argument becomes
insufficient when one considers that the average
American woman now lives to age 74 and has her
last child at about age 26; thus, by the time the
women is 33 or so, her children all have more
important things to do with their daytime hours
than to spend them entertaining an adult woman
who has nothing to do during the second half of
her life span.
As for the other "joys" of homemaking, many

writers (e.g., Friedan, 1963) have persuasively
argued that the role of the homemaker has been
glamorized far beyond its intrinsic worth. This
charge becomes plausible when one considers
that the average American homemaker spends
the equivalent of a man's working day, 7.1 hours,
in preparing meals, cleaning house, laundering,
mending, shopping, and doing other household
tasks. In other words, 43% of her waking time is
spent in activity that would command an hourly
wage on the open market well below the
federally-set minimum for menial industrial
work.
The point is not how little she would earn if
she did these things in someone else's home, but
that this use of time is virtually the same for
homemakers with college degrees and for those
with less than a grade school education, for
women married to professional men and for
women married to blue-collar workers. Talent,
education, ability, interests, motivations: all are
irrelevant. In our society, being female uniquely
qualifies an individual for domestic work.
It is true, of course, that the American
homemaker has, on the average, 5.1 hours of
leisure time per day, and it is here, we are told,
that each woman can express her unique
identity. Thus, politically interested women can
join the league of Women Voters; women with
humane interests can became part-time Gray
Ladies; women who love music can raise money
for the symphony. Protestant women play
Canasta; Jewish women play Mah-Jongg; brighter
women of all denominations and faculty wives
play bridge; and so forth.
But politically interested men serve in
legislatures; men with humane interests become
physicians or clinical psychologists; men who
love music play in the symphony; and so forth.
In other words, why should a woman's unique
identity determine only the periphery of her life
rather than its central core?
Again, the important point is not that the role

of homemaker is necessarily inferior, but that the
woman's unique identity has been rendered
irrelevant. Consider the following "predictability
test." When a boy is born, it is difficult to
predict what he will be doing 25 years later. We
cannot say whether he will be an artist, a doctor,
or a college professor because he will be
permitted to develop and to fulfill his own
unique potential, particularly if he is white and
middleclass. But if the newborn child is a girl, we
can usually predict with confidence how she will

If homemaking is as glamorous as
the women's magazines and television
commercials portray it, then men,
too, should have that option.

be spending her time 25 years later. Her
individuality doesn't have to be considered; it is
irrelevant.
The socialization of the American male has
closed off certain options for him too. Men are
discouraged from developing certain desirable
traits such as tenderness and sensitivity just as
surely as women are discouraged from being
assertive and, also, "too bright." Young boys are
encouraged to be incompetent at cooking and
child care just as surely as young girls are urged
to be incompetent at mathematics and science.
Indeed, one of the errors of the early feminist
movement in this country was that it assumed
that men had all the goodies and that women
could attain self-fulfillment merely be being like
men. But that is hardly the Utopia implied by the
values of individuality and self-fulfillment.
Rather, these values would require society to
raise its children so flexibly and with sufficient
respect for the integrity of individual uniqueness
that some men might emerge with the
motiviation, the ability, and the opportunity to

sandra bem and daryl bem

stay home and raise children without bearing the
stigma of being peculier.
If homemaking is as glamorous as the
women's magazines and television commercials
portray it, then men, too, should have that
option. Even if homemaking isn't all that
glamorous, it would probably still be more
fulfilling for some men than the jobs in which
they now find themselves.
And if biological differences really do exist
between men and women in "nurturance," in
their inborn motivations to care for children,
then this will show up automatically in the final
distribution of men and women across the
various roles: relatively fewer men will choose to
stay at home.
The values of individuality and self-fulfillment
do not imply that there must be equality of
outcome, an equal number of men and women in
each role, but that there should be the widest
possible variation in outcome consistent with the
range of individual differences among people,
regardless of sex.
At the very least, these values imply that
society should raise its males so that they ~ould
freely engage in activities that might pay less
than those being pursued by their wives without
feeling that they were "living off their wives,"
One rarely hears it said of a woman that she is
"living off her husband."
Thus, it is true that a man's options, are
limited by our society's sex-role ideology, but as
the "predictability test" reveals, it is still the
woman in our society whose identity is rendered
irrelevant by America's socialization practices. In
1954, the United States Supreme Court declared
that a fraud and hoax lay behind the slogan
"separate but equal." It is unlikely that any
court will ever do the same for the more subtle
motto that successfully keeps the woman in her
place: "complementary but equal."
Tomorrow: Interpersonal Equality
(Sandra Bem and Daryl Bem are members of the
psychology department.)
The biological argument advanced to counter
the claim that America subverts the individuality
and self-fulfillment of its women suggests that
there may really be inborn differences between
men and women in, say, independence or
mathematical ability. Or that there may be
biological factors beyond the fact that women
can become pregnant and nurse children which
uniquely dictate that they, but not men, should
stay home all day and shun serious outside
commitment.
Maybe female hormones really are responsible
somehow. One difficulty with this argument, of
course, is that female hormones would have to be
different in the Soviet Union, where one-third of
the engineers and 75% of the physicians are
women. In America, women constitute less than
1% of the engineers and only 7% of the
physicians (Dodge, 1966).
Female physiology is different, and it may
account for some of the psychological
differences between the sexes, but America's
sex-role ideology still seems primarily responsible
for the fact that so few women emerge from
childhood with the motivation to seek out any
role beyond the one that our society dictates.
But even if there really were biological
differences between the sexes along these lines,
the biological argument would still be irrelevant.
