# People's Law School Opens
## 
### BRUCE COLLINS 
Legal study will extend off
campus into Palo Alto's poor,
minority community when a free
People's Law School is opened
there within a month.
The law school's most
important function will be to
provide a working knowledge of
the law to poor residents in a
course called "street survival."
The school will also train legal
workers with advanced study in
such areas as Landlord-Tenant
law, and investigative and research
techniques.
An organizer for the school,
Stanford graduate Barbara

Hyland, described the "street
survival" course. "People will be
taught what to do when stopped
by the police. When arrested, how
to arrange bail, how to get a
lawyer. We will show them how to
play by the rules of the legal
system and survive. . .We hope to
reach the most people with this
course."
A similar course held by the
People's Law School in San
Francisco last summer was highly
successful, according to Hyland,
in drawing high interest and a
good cross-section of students.
Landlord-tenant law,
sponsored by the Palo Alto

Tenant's Union, will be taught by
Stanford law student Dave
Schlissel. The course will acquaint
workers in the Tenants' Union
with tenant law, and train legal
workers to aid a defense office
being operated by the union.
"Legal workers will be taught
under the supervision of a
lawyer," explained Hyland, "the
methodology of research, how to
use legal books, how to write legal
documents, writs of habeas
corpus. .
Hyland, who has worked as a
private investigator for eight
months, will introduce students to
the field of investigation. A
special course will be offered on
the prison system with guest
speakers including former
prisoners and guards.
All courses are taught by
volunteers who feel they can
contribute to the law school. The
Menlo Park Law Commune has
even offered to train
undergraduates to teach courses in
"street survival." Stanford
students would teach jointly with
groups of law students.
The school, patterned after the
San Francisco People's Law
School that attracted 750
students last summer, is at the
experimental level now, said
Hyland. Size of the school will be
determined by how much interest
can be generated. Nairobi College
in Palo Alto has already made a
request for courses.
A committee of six is
organizing the school, contacting
organizations that will contribute
books and materials, and
arranging to hold classes in
churches and private homes. The
Stanford Law School and Law
Association have contributed legal
books.
Hyland emphasized the role
undergraduates can play in areas
of fund raising, publicity,
community liaison, and teaching.
Even as students, undergraduates
would enjoy "a great educational
experience."
She explained that courses
would be taught from the
perspective that while minority
residents must know the law to
survive in the American legal
system, the system cannot be
reformed to offer anything more
than survival. "As long as a legal

system exists which reflects the
economic and political bias of our
country, these people can only
survive. We will relate the courses
to their experiences in East Palo
Alto.. .why police are likely to
harass blacks in East Palo Alto
and not in Stanford."
Deputy District Attorney
William C. Bourke commended
the law school's purpose to
educate the poor in law, but
denied that the poor were treated
unfairly by the legal system.
"Of what I've seen of the
operation of this judicial system,
those who are called affluent
receive no better treatment than
those who are indigent or poor or
those represented by the public
defender's office.
He added that although public
defenders are highly competent
attorneys, they are held in
suspicion by some in the poor
community.
A lawyer in the East Palo Alto
Legal Aid office said the la»v
school would definitely fill a need
in the poor community by
clarifying a legal system "that is
not very responsive to them."
He said the poor fear the law,
do not understand it, or its
function. "Lay people should
have some basic idea of the law as
a preventative when a situation
becomes suspicious. In cases of
consumer abuse, housing, and
eviction, if people were aware of
the law, they could protect
themselves, and not wind up in
court."
The legal aid office does
periodically give seminars on the
law and used to publish a weekly
legal newspaper.
The People's Law School is
sponsored by the Stanford branch
of the National Lawyers Guild, an
organization composed of radical
lawyers, law students, legal
workers, and jailhouse lawyers, on
opposition to the American Bar
Association. The Palo Alto Law
School results from the Guild's
goal of introducing study of law
to people unable to attend
credited law schools.
Stanford students interested in
the People's Law School should
contact Barbara Hyland at
327-2722 during the day and
854-3692 at night, or Dave
Schlissel at 323-4257.
