# Candidate Diane Feinstein, Class Of '55, Running Hard
## 
### 
Few Stanford graduates run for
major elective office, and of these
candidates, fewer still are women.
Mrs. Dianne Feinstein, President
of the San Francisco Board of
Supervisors, is an exception to
both of these rules.
A member of the class of 1955,
the well-dressed brunette has been
active at Stanford as a "friend" of
the SCIRE and SWOPSI boards,
after graduating with a degree in
History and Political Science.
While a student at Stanford,
Feinstein was elected ASSU
vice-president.
She sasoddo two other serious
candidates, incumbent mayor
Joseph Alioto and self-styled
conservative Harold Dobbs, in San
Francisco's November 2
mayoralty election.
Feinstein entered the race in
late summer, after delaying her
decision because of scruples about
a promise made to Alioto, in
which she agreed not to oppose
the mayor in this year's election.
In addition to her teim on the
Board of Supervisors, she has
served on the California Women's
Board of Terms and Parole, the
Bay Area Air Pollution Control
District board, and several other
governmental organizations.
At a press conference staged in
her expensively furnished San
Francisco home, Feinstein
discussed the campaign and its
issues with high school and college
journalists.
Feinstein decided to enter the
mayoralty race because she
believes that this year's election
provides the "last opportunity in
the 70's we'll have to change the
destiny of this city."
She believes that her election
prospects are hindered because
she is a woman. Feinstein feels
that women still distrust their
own sex, and succumb to
emotions of envy and jealousy.
She observed that many
women react to her candidacy by
asking "what's wrong with her?,"
while men frequently remain
hostile because they feel
challenged or confronted by
women in politics.
Both in her candidacy for
mayor and in her tenure on the
Board of Supervisors, Feinstein
noted that male politicians have
usually demonstrated an
ingratiating, condescending
attitude towards her.
The major issues in Feinstein's
campaign concentrate on city
finance. She supports new
budgeting processes and a
city-wide income tax, arguing that
"these are waste and fat in our
city government, but you can't

get at them through present
budgeting processes."
San Francisco now uses a
line-budget system where cuts are
made only on requests for new
appropriations, according to the
city charter. Feinstein advocates a
"program and priorities"
budgeting system, which would
allow the Board of Supervisors to
decide priorities in general terms,
and allocate funds both within
and between departments in city
government.
To reduce the city's property
tax rate, which has risen 45% in
the last four years, Feinstien
advocates a municipal personal
income tax, which would shift the
tax burden to "parasites" who
work in the city, but live in the
suburbs.
She predicts this tax could
raise about $50 million, while
reducing property taxes by
15-20%, and permitting the repeal
of several minor taxes. Presently
untaxed commuters would pay
about 1/3 of the new tax, she
maintains.
Feinstein cites a City
Attorney's opinion and two Law
Review articles as evidence of her
proposal's legality, which has been
questioned.

Campaigning as a liberal law
and order candidate, she opposes
the legalization of prostitution
and marijuana, though she would
accept illegal but discreet,
off-street prostitution.
Feinstien intends to
"concentrate upon the prevention
of those crimes which are harmful
to life and property." She has
consistantly supported police
requests for increased
appropriations.
Conceding that "everyone
dislikes busing," she still supports
"law and order" in busing
required by Federal courts.
Feinstein opposes Alvin
Duskin's referendum attempting
to establish an absolute, sixty-foot
height limit on all new
construction in San Francisco,
because it "would cause buildings
to be elected." She does, however,
advocate an absolute height limit
on all unzoned city land.
Feinstein's well-financed,
professionally organized campaign
covers almost every possible
position on every current issue in
San Francisco. It portrays her as a
"new leader" with "credibility,
openness, optimism, and
knowledge."

a promise made to Alioto, in
which she agreed not to oppose
the mayor in this year's election.
In addition to her teim on the
Board of Supervisors, she has
served on the California Women's
Board of Terms and Parole, the
Bay Area Air Pollution Control
District board, and several other
governmental organizations.
At a press conference staged in
her expensively furnished San
Francisco home, Feinstein
discussed the campaign and its
issues with high school and college
journalists.
Feinstein decided to enter the
mayoralty race because she
believes that this year's election
provides the "last opportunity in
the 70's we'll have to change the
destiny of this city."
She believes that her election
prospects are hindered because
she is a woman. Feinstein feels
that women still distrust their
own sex, and succumb to
emotions of envy and jealousy.
She observed that many
women react to her candidacy by
asking "what's wrong with her?,"
while men frequently remain
hostile because they feel
challenged or confronted by
women in politics.
Both in her candidacy for
mayor and in her tenure on the
Board of Supervisors, Feinstein
noted that male politicians have
usually demonstrated an
ingratiating, condescending
attitude towards her.
The major issues in Feinstein's
campaign concentrate on city
finance. She supports new
budgeting processes and a
city-wide income tax, arguing that
"these are waste and fat in our
city government, but you can't

get at them through present
budgeting processes."
San Francisco now uses a
line-budget system where cuts are
made only on requests for new
appropriations, according to the
city charter. Feinstein advocates a
"program and priorities"
budgeting system, which would
allow the Board of Supervisors to
decide priorities in general terms,
and allocate funds both within
and between departments in city
government.
To reduce the city's property
tax rate, which has risen 45% in
the last four years, Feinstien
advocates a municipal personal
income tax, which would shift the
tax burden to "parasites" who
work in the city, but live in the
suburbs.
She predicts this tax could
raise about $50 million, while
reducing property taxes by
15-20%, and permitting the repeal
of several minor taxes. Presently
untaxed commuters would pay
about 1/3 of the new tax, she
maintains.
Feinstein cites a City
Attorney's opinion and two Law
Review articles as evidence of her
proposal's legality, which has been
questioned.

Campaigning as a liberal law
and order candidate, she opposes
the legalization of prostitution
and marijuana, though she would
accept illegal but discreet,
off-street prostitution.
Feinstien intends to
"concentrate upon the prevention
of those crimes which are harmful
to life and property." She has
consistantly supported police
requests for increased
appropriations.
Conceding that "everyone
dislikes busing," she still supports
"law and order" in busing
required by Federal courts.
Feinstein opposes Alvin
Duskin's referendum attempting
to establish an absolute, sixty-foot
height limit on all new
construction in San Francisco,
because it "would cause buildings
to be elected." She does, however,
advocate an absolute height limit
on all unzoned city land.
Feinstein's well-financed,
professionally organized campaign
covers almost every possible
position on every current issue in
San Francisco. It portrays her as a
"new leader" with "credibility,
openness, optimism, and
knowledge."
Few Stanford graduates run for
major elective office, and of these
candidates, fewer still are women.
Mrs. Dianne Feinstein, President
of the San Francisco Board of
Supervisors, is an exception to
both of these rules.
A member of the class of 1955,
the well-dressed brunette has been
active at Stanford as a "friend" of
the SCIRE and SWOPSI boards,
after graduating with a degree in
History and Political Science.
While a student at Stanford,
Feinstein was elected ASSU
vice-president.
She sasoddo two other serious
candidates, incumbent mayor
Joseph Alioto and self-styled
conservative Harold Dobbs, in San
Francisco's November 2
mayoralty election.
Feinstein entered the race in
late summer, after delaying her
decision because of scruples about
a promise made to Alioto, in
which she agreed not to oppose
the mayor in this year's election.
In addition to her teim on the
Board of Supervisors, she has
