# Stanford Students Prefer Social Work During School Year Instead Of Full Time
## 
### 
Between 1969 and 1970, the
number of Stanford applicants to
the Peace Corps dropped from
160 to 80, a 50% decline. During
that same period, participation in
the Stanford Workshops on
Political and Social Issues
(SWOPSI) increased by 50%
These figures evidence the
change in student approach to
volunteer activities. Recently the
potential volunteer has been
looking for programs in which he
can combine his academic and
volunteer activities instead of
separating them as he used to. Bill
Wilson, the Stanford Coordinator
of Operation Share, explained the
change more simply, stating that
"if a tutor can get credit for what
he's doing, he has more time to
devote" to his volunteer work.
The "new volunteer" has a
large variety of new or revised
programs to choose from. They
inlcude SWOPSI, Operation Share,
the Black Students Volunteer
Center (BSVC), the Project
Information Center (PIC) and

Volunteers in Asia. The Peace
Corps and VISTA, now combined
into one program, still recruit on
campus as well. VISTA will be in
White Plaza October 25-29 to sign
up volunteers and will return with
Peace Corps representatives
December 6 - 10.
The most popular of these
volunteer-oriented programs is
SWOPSI. Those volunteers who
formerly used the Project
Information Center as their outlet
are now turning more and more to
SWOPSI, from which they can
obtain academic credit for their
work.
Accordingly, interest in the
Project Information Center's
tutoring and remedial care
programs has fallen off
dramatically. At the same time,
SWOPSI has sponsored workshops
dealing in preschool education,
education of the urban poor,
alternative high school education
and drug abuse peer counseling.
Perhaps the clearest sign of the
advent of a new attitude towards
volunteer work is by Operation
Share's desire to become a part of
the SWOPSI program during this
academic year. Share is looking
for bilingual and multilingual
tutors for the PA Unified School
District and for Ravenswood High
School in E. Palo Alto. Share
Coordinator Bill Wilson said that
the major attractions of the
merger were that Share's tutors
could be given training in
successful teaching methods, then
go out and tutor and ultimately
receive academic credit for the
whole affair. This desire to change
methods is significant in light of
the fact that Share in past year
has been able to attract over 2000
Santa Clara County college
students annually without these

methods.
The Black Student Volunteer
Center, which is in its third year,
is based upon lines similar to
those of SWOPSI. The Center has
courses of instruction available to
black students in teaching
methods and procedures. In
addition, those who are under
instruction by the Center have the
opportunity to do volunteer
tutorial work in the black primary
and secondary schools of East
P.A. and Menlo Park. According
to Tom Massey, the new director
of the Center, student
participation in BSVC activities
on a regular basis nearly tripled
after the courses and work it
offered were recognized as a part
of the Stanford curriculum.
The Volunteers in Asia
program was the first at Stanford

to recognize and appeal to the
"new volunteer." VIA has offered
academic credit for both its six
month and two year programs and
has provided top-notch volunteers
to Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macao,
South Korea, Japan, Nepal, the
Philippines and, most
significantly, to Indonesia which
has expelled all other American
volunteer organizations. Interest
in its programs has remained
steady throughout VlA's eight
years.
The turn of the decade has
brought the advent of a new form
of volunteerism at Stanford. This
"new volunteerism" contrasts
vividly with the original spirit that
grew out of the dynamic call to
action sounded during the 1000
days of the Kennedy
Administration.
