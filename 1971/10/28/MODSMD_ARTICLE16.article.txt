# Strong Female 'Maids'
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Long before revolutionary prison literature
became fashionable, Jean Genet was a convicted
thief writing plays and novels from his European
prison cell. In five years during the 1940'5, he wrote
three novels, a volume of poems, "A Thief's
Journal," and two plavs, "Deathwatch" and"The
Maids."
Some critics have said that Genet is overly bitter
and evil in his works. When Genet visited Stanford a
few years ago, one professor who met him
commented on how unsociable and unpersonable
the French writer was.
But writers are not judged on personality and
Genet's writings are rightfully considered among the
finest of any Frenchman of his period. "The Maids"
is a masterpiece of role-playing, circular logic and
the proletariat-bourgeois struggle, among other
things. The play, conceived on many levels,
questions the very nature of theater.
Because of the complexity of the work, one can
come away from the Stanford Drama Department's
current production of "The Maids" both moved and
impressed, but also a bit disappointed. Director
Michael Barry has formed a very effective
presentation to open the department's current
season, but one feels a bit cheated in his approach.
Servant-Master
The question which this production seems to
most effectively raise is the one of the
servant-master relationship. One cannot leave the
Nitery without searching his mind for his personal
feelings about the question of social classes.
Barry's production works extremely well in this
area. Serious points about the proletariat and the
bourgeois are well presented. And one does not feel
that there is a constant, dogmatic political line being
presented throughout the play. You leave
questioning political and social concepts, but not
feeling that Genet has tried to shove his personal
revolutionary feelings down your throat.
"The Maids" is a very psychological and
sociological play. Concepts of love and hate and
particularly the idea of role playing are central
themes in the work. How incredibly perceptive it
was of Genet to explore the question of role-playing
in the theater, where it is always practiced.
Males Playing Maids
Here is where I feel this production makes a
mistake. Genet had intended the roles of the two
maids to be played by young boys. This is not only
a manifestation of his homosexuality, but it is a
very clever concept which advances the whole idea
of role playing to even more incredible dimensions.
Without males to create this extra dimension, I

fear that this production does not explore as deeply
as it could the questions of social roles and even
more so, of sex roles. With males portraying
females, especially in an exclusively female
occupation, you would be continually conscious "of
these questions of sex roles and social roles.
Barry's production explores the questions of
these social roles as much as it can with females, but
the use of males would have seemed to carry the
questioning even farther and heightened the concept
of role playing even more. 1 would have liked to
have seen males.
Excellent Cast
But 1 still liked this production. Barry made his
decision about how he wanted to do the play and he
has gone about directing it in an excellent manner.
And his cast performs quite well.
The maids, Robbi Levitow as Solange and Cris
Rose as Claire, are very competent. At times, Rose's
movements are a bit awkward, especially when she
has to make a rapid emotional change. Her voice
handles the changes well, but her body wasn't
always as theatrically controlled.
Levitow is a steady actress all night. She is
especially good in one of her hateful vengeance
speeches against Madame late in the play. Levitow
and Rose work well together and they are
particularly adept at making the changes from
domination to subjugation. They are convincing
through almost all the play.
Superb Delivery
Adrienne Moloney seems appropriate as Madame.
She is both properly condescending and sickeningly,
hypocritically obsequious. And some of her vocal
maneuvers, especially on the word incarcerated, are
very good. When she gives the maids some clothes,
her delivery of the line "It's so nice to make
everyone around you happy," is magnificent.
The set makes very effective use of mirrors and
the small size of the Nitery allows for an important
intimacy withthe theatrics. One outstanding special
effect was the very impressive lighting change at the
end of the show.
Fearing repetition, I say again that I enjoyed this
production. The acting was credible and I left the
theater deep in thought. But that thought revolved
mainly around political and social questions of the
worker-bourgeois struggle. With males playing the
maids, 1 might have had more to ponder.
