### KITTY PATTERSON 
Dinkelspiel was filled with
romance Tuesday night as the
Guarneri String Quartet gave its
first of three concerts and their
playing was full of controlled
emotion.
They picked their pieces well.
Mozart's Quartet in D Minor K.
421 was their only "officially"
classical selection. It lends itself
well to a romantic interpretation.
The other pieces, Sibelius' Quartet
Opus 56, "Voces Intimae" and
Mendelssohn's Quartet in E Elat
Major Opus 44 number 3 were
presented just as expressively but
precisely.
The high point of the program
for this reviewer was Sibelius. It
proved an excellent showcase for
all four performers' talents. The
first movement starts with a solo
melody line which the first violin
and cello trade off. Both
performers used such
well-calculated vibratos and

rubatos that the sound was
amazingly rich, even when the
violin soared to very high notes.
The synchronization of all four
instruments was astounding. It's
hard to gauge just how much each
player will crescendo or vary the
tempo without creating a
disgusting mess where no one is
quite together with anyone else.
But that was never the case that
night. Every romantic flourish
must have been perfectly planned,
yet the overall impression was of
four-part sincerity, not four
calculated lines.
Technical Prowess
The quartet's technical prowess
cannot go unmentioned. Even the
most complicated runs and
chromatic passages came over
clearly. The first violinist, Mr.
Steinhardt, played especially well.
All three pieces featured him
extensively, especially in rapid-fire
technical runs and trills, which
almost always came out

completely precise.
Two passages stick in my mind
when I think of the precision of
their playing. Both came in the
Mendelssohn, which surprisingly
sounded the most classical in style
of all three selections. In the third
movement, Messrs. Steinhardt and
DaJley on their violins departed
from the Adagio pace for a few
measures to build up in crisp
parallel thirds from a subdued
piano to a triumphant forte. The
effect was exciting, as it came
quite unexpectedly. The other
passage came at the beginning of
the last movement, when the
viola, cello, and second violin
played a perfectly precise series of
runs under a highly romanticised
first violin melody.
Mozart Weak
I think the weakest part of ihe
program was the Mozart. During
the first two movements, the
cellist, David Soyer, quite
frequently "squeaked" his
instrument. His notes did not
always come out right on pitch.
There is one passage in the first
movement when the cello is
supposed to come booming in on
a subito forte in triplets that
sound like a galloping horse.
Unfortunately, the horse tripped.
Mr. Soyer soon more than
redeemed himself. The last
movement contains five variations
on the original theme. The third
variation features the violist. Mr.
Tree played an expressively rich
line. As accompaniment to the
violist, the cellist must play very
fast runs. These Mr. Soyer
performed with such skill that I
quickly changed my opinion of
him. His performance throughout
the rest of the program verified
his true talent.

movement, Messrs. Steinhardt and
DaJley on their violins departed
from the Adagio pace for a few
measures to build up in crisp
parallel thirds from a subdued
piano to a triumphant forte. The
effect was exciting, as it came
quite unexpectedly. The other
passage came at the beginning of
the last movement, when the
viola, cello, and second violin
played a perfectly precise series of
runs under a highly romanticised
first violin melody.
Mozart Weak
I think the weakest part of ihe
program was the Mozart. During
the first two movements, the
cellist, David Soyer, quite
frequently "squeaked" his
instrument. His notes did not
always come out right on pitch.
There is one passage in the first
movement when the cello is
supposed to come booming in on
a subito forte in triplets that
sound like a galloping horse.
Unfortunately, the horse tripped.
Mr. Soyer soon more than
redeemed himself. The last
movement contains five variations
on the original theme. The third
variation features the violist. Mr.
Tree played an expressively rich
line. As accompaniment to the
violist, the cellist must play very
fast runs. These Mr. Soyer
performed with such skill that I
quickly changed my opinion of
him. His performance throughout
the rest of the program verified
his true talent.
Impressive History
The history of the Guarneri
String Quartet is very impressive.
All four members have been
Dinkelspiel was filled with
romance Tuesday night as the
Guarneri String Quartet gave its
first of three concerts and their
playing was full of controlled
emotion.
They picked their pieces well.
Mozart's Quartet in D Minor K.
421 was their only "officially"
classical selection. It lends itself
well to a romantic interpretation.
The other pieces, Sibelius' Quartet
Opus 56, "Voces Intimae" and
Mendelssohn's Quartet in E Elat
Major Opus 44 number 3 were
presented just as expressively but
precisely.
The high point of the program
for this reviewer was Sibelius. It
proved an excellent showcase for
all four performers' talents. The
first movement starts with a solo
melody line which the first violin
and cello trade off. Both
performers used such
well-calculated vibratos and

rubatos that the sound was
amazingly rich, even when the
violin soared to very high notes.
The synchronization of all four
instruments was astounding. It's
hard to gauge just how much each
player will crescendo or vary the
tempo without creating a
disgusting mess where no one is
quite together with anyone else.
But that was never the case that
night. Every romantic flourish
must have been perfectly planned,
yet the overall impression was of
four-part sincerity, not four
calculated lines.
Technical Prowess
The quartet's technical prowess
cannot go unmentioned. Even the
most complicated runs and
chromatic passages came over
clearly. The first violinist, Mr.
Steinhardt, played especially well.
All three pieces featured him
extensively, especially in rapid-fire
technical runs and trills, which
almost always came out

completely precise.
Two passages stick in my mind
when I think of the precision of
their playing. Both came in the
Mendelssohn, which surprisingly
sounded the most classical in style
of all three selections. In the third
movement, Messrs. Steinhardt and
DaJley on their violins departed
from the Adagio pace for a few
measures to build up in crisp
parallel thirds from a subdued
piano to a triumphant forte. The
