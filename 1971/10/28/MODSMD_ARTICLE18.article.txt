# Gilbert & Sullivan: Fine Satirical Wit
## 
### GARY SCHMIDGSALL 
To many people, the inordinate love of Gilbert and Sullivan
operettas is a sure sign of arrested aesthetic developmentâ€”if not sheer
lunacy. All that G & S connoisseurs (true Savoyards) can do is sigh at
the pitiful delusion and barbarity this view displays.
For everything is not as it seems in what might at first blush appear
to be the simplicity and undiluted quaintness of these musical
comedies. No one ever carressed cliches with more malicious glee, no
one ever so wittily satirized contemporary values and customs, no one
ever made more "musical jokes," and no one certainly turned so many
happy phrases as did Gilbert & Sullivan.
Far from simplicity, the difficulty is in the depth of their works. It
takes so much historical background, so much openness to the
main-springs of Victorian England, and so much willingness to cope
with the ever-so-British essence of these works to enjoy them fully.
Still, and this is thanks to unchanging human nature, much of the
satire is transplantable: "Trial by Jury" (hypocrisy of the law);
"Patience" (fads; art for art's sake); "Princess Ida" (women's lib);
"H.M.S. Pinafore" (military foolishness); and so on. One cannot help
muttering often "quite so" (modem translation: right on) in these
operettas.
One of the very best of the/G & S canon, "lolanthe" is currently
being done by San Francisco's resident Savoyard-., The Lamplighters.
In this piece many social ills and human idiosyncrasies take deliciously
hare knocks: supernatural literature, aristocratic noblesse oblige,
Parliamentary politics, legal flim-flamming, not to mention much
musicological tomfoolery. The entire mood of the production is one
of love and devotion to this unique genre, and this mood is almost
enough to excuse the less than adequate aspects.
All of the voices are equally adequate to the musical demands,
some being more equal than others; and even the orchestra came up
with the right spice and heartiness, though there was an ample number
of goofs and rawness in the violins. This is the first time the
Lamplighters have used an orchestra (thanks to special dispensation
from the Musicians Union, which maybe has a heart after all), and we
cna surely hope for improvement.
The most vital ingredient for good G & S is a solid sense of pace
and comic timing, slackness in this area is a fate worse than death.
And this production, I felt, stammered rather too often. This may be
due to lack of an absolutely skin-tight directoral effort, but more
probably is due to the extensive inter-changing of singers in this run.
The cast members, I felt, wen l not fully at ease with each other on
stage. The chorus of fairies and peers, however, was thoroughly
charming.
Still and all, the experience was a pleasant one, and I think this is
because G & S productions can overcome considerable difficulties if
the heart is in the right place. This is never is doubt with the
Lamplighters. And at $1.75 (student rate) "lolanthe" would be a hard
entertainment bargain to beat.
