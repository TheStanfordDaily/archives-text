# 'Trial Of Catonsville Nine': Powerful Documentary Play
## 
### CHRISTINE DOUGLAS 
Now playing at the New
Committee Theater in San
Francisco, "The Trial of the
Catonsville Nine" is a
thought-provoking documentary
play which deals with some of
today's most fundamental issues.
It centers around the trial of the
Berrigan brothers, Daniel and
Philip, and seven of their
associates for the burning of 378
draft files at Catonsville, Maryland
on May 17, 1968.
Throughout the trial, the
"nine" point out that the laws of

recognized as excellent performers
in their own rights. Mr. Steinhardt
has been a soloist with major
American orchestras in
Philadelphia, New York and
Cleveland. John Dalley was
formerly on the faculty of the
Oberlin Conservatory and
aritst-in-residence at the
University of Illinois. Michael
Tree has made solo appearances
all over Italy and the Americas.
Mr. Soyer has toured extensively
as a soloist and as a member of
such highly-regarded groups as the
Guilet Quartet.
Two More Appearances
The Guarneri String Quartet
will make two more appearances
at Stanford. Their next concert,
on Friday at 8:00, will consist of
works by Beethoven, Bartok, and
Schumann. At the final concert,
next Sunday at 2:30, the group
will present an all-Beethoven
program.
(Editor's Note: Tickets for the
two remaining concerts are priced
at $4 general and $3.25 for
students. Student rush tickets at
$2 will be sold 15 minutes before
curtain if available.)

the United States no longer serve
the needs of its people, and that
in order to obey their consciences,
the "nine" were forced to disobey
the law. They claim that their
burning of the draft files in
Catonsville stands as a protest not
only against American atrocities
in South Viet Nam, but also in
Guatemala, the Dominican
Republic and Uganda—atrocities
which violate the tenets of the
Bible and the very democracy
which the Unites States claims to
uphold.
They propose that it is not

they, but the government who has
committed a crime, for the
government has failed to obey the
"higher Law" of its conscience.
They maintain justifiably that the
United States government must
rid itself of its paranoia over the
concept of revolution. Man must
change and it is therefore the
church's role to bring about
non-violent change.
As the Berrigan brothers, Ray
Rheinhart and Thomas McNallan
demonstrate a deep understanding
of the predicament of these men.
The director, Lee Sankowich,
creates some interesting effects
which make the courtroom scene
transcend the limits imposed upon
it by the simple plot and action of
the play. At the beginning, the
audience is shown a movie of the
actual draft file burning, followed
by a policeman's presentation of
"real evidence" against the nine
defendants. Most important,
however, is the manner in which
the actors address the audience. It
is as if the audience were the jury.
We are forced to make our own
judgments about the case, and at
the end are left feeling that we
should take as strong a stand as
the "Catonsville Nine" on issues
which deeply concern us.
The play stands as a hymn to
the courage and what Sophocles
would call the "true piety" of
these men; yet it also stands as a
supplication that we realize "we
are one human family," equally
responsible for each others'
welfare.
(Editor's Note—Tickets for li The
Trial of The Catonsville Nine"are
priced at $5.50 to $6.50 on
Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays
and Sundays and at $6.50 to
$7.50 on Fridays and Saturdays.
A student discount of $1 is given

rush tickets go on sale fifteen
minutes before curtain time, when
