# Witness Says Police Grabbed Franklin
## 
### PHIL REVZIN 
Former Acting Instructor of English
Jeffrey Youdelman testified yesterday
that he stood directly behind H. Bruce
Franklin when the Maoist professor was
grabbed by two policemen while
talking to officers Donald Tamm and
C.D. Marron outside the Computation
Center February 10.
"I saw the police grab Bruce, I
grabbed his waist and pushed and
pulled him away. After I felt he was on
his way to safety, I ran like hell,"
Youdelman said.
Youdelman's testimony came amid
numerous requests by the Advisory
Board for Franklin to clearly define
and limit further defense testimony.
Franklin submitted to the Board the
first part of a confidential written
statement detailing certain aspects of
the remaining testimony he wishes to
introduce in his defense. He is expected
to supply the remainder today, and the
Board may react to some of his
statements.
The Board had set Saturday as a
target date for the completion of
defense testimony, and requested the
statement if Franklin wished more
time. Board chairman Kennedy said the
Board appreciated the statement and
"would digest it and respond as soon as
possible."
Kennedy indicated that setting the
target date was done to assist Franklin
in presenting a more effective defense.
"Bad organization is hurting you,"
Kennedy commented during the
session.
Throughout the session, Kennedy
continued his policy of asking the
defense to indicate what each witness
would testify about before the start of
direct examination. From time to time
Kennedy indicated that portions of
certain witnesses' testimony was
irrelevant, or "was not helpful to the
Board."
Franklin had earlier indicated that
he would not submit the written

statement and would not accept time
restrictions. As he submitted the
statement he quoted Chairman Mao as
saying "Anyone, no matter who, may
point out our shortcomings. If he is
right, we will correct them. If what he
proposes will benefit the people, we
will act upon it."
Chairman Kennedy responded with
another quote from the same source,
saying that the Board wanted
testimony limited so they would not be
"like blindfolded men chasing
sparrows."
Youdelman also related that there
was a meeting on the steps of the
Computation Center during which
demonstrators discussed sit-in tactics
and may have agreed not to damage the
machine.
He said that after the dispersal
orders "some, but certainly not all, the
people started to leave. Most of the
crowd just seemed to back up a few
feet."
Youdelman said that Franklin had
been discussing the legality of the
police dispersal order with Tamm and
Marron when he saw two uniformed
officers come from Marron's left and
grab Franklin. An earlier witness had
testified that at the same time the
officers grabbed Franklin, the police
charged the main body of the crowd.
Peter Knutson and Paul Loeb, both
students, testified that they had seen
no violence or illegal acts at the
Computation Center. Both said that
people for the most part were not
leaving the area when the dispersal
orders were given.
Dru Cornell said she saw no acts of
violence at the Comp Center, and had
decided to go there before the White
Plaza rally that noon.
The hearing resumes at 1 p.m.
today.
