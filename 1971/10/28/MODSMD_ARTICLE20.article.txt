Oil Spill Suit
SAN FRANCISCO — A federal grand jury indicted
Standard Oil Co. of California and a subsidiary
yesterday on charges of polluting San Francisco Bay
in a massive oil spill last January.
U.S. Atty. James L. Browning Jr. said the
indictment was brought under the 1899 Refuse Act,
which carries a fine for corporate defendants of not
more than $2,500 nor less than $500. Charged with
Standard Oil was the Chevron Shipping Co.
Two Standard Oil tankers, the Arizona Standard
and the Oregon Standard, collided in dense fog near
the Golden Gate Bridge January 18, spilling 840,000
gallons of fuel oil into the bay.
The resulting oil slick blackened beaches and
wildlife on Pacific and bay coasts over a 50-mile area.
Thousands of waterbirds coated with the thick
bunker oil died.
Browning said the case was taken to the grand jury
following an investigation by the Coast Guard and the
Environmental Protection Agency.

Kissinger, Nixon's assistant for national security
affairs, who returned Monday from six days of talks
in Peking.
Irish 'Shoot To Kill'
BELFAST, NORTHERN IRELAND - The British
Army served notice yesterday its troops here will
shoot to kill children who fire on them in the war
against Irish Republican Army guerrillas.
The warning was issued after two youths,
described as being 12 to 14 years old, sprayed a
British patrol in Belfast with submachine-gun fire and
two more soldiers died in a bomb blast in
Londonderry.
"The troops will shoot to kill any man or child or
woman who happens to shoot at them," said the
Scots Guard company commander. Army
headquarters said he spoke with full authority.
The two boys fired nine shots at a patrol Tuesday
night and the major said his vehicle seemed the target.
"If children fire guns at soldiers, then they will be
shot," Johnson said;

Nixon U.N. Reaction
WASHINGTON — President Nixon, giving a delayed
reaction to Monday night's events that saw the
United Nations admit mainland China and expel
Taiwan, suggested yesterday the result could be
lessened U.S. support and a reshuffling of foreign aid.
Press secretary Ronald L. Zeigler said Nixon was
shocked by what he regarded as "undisguised glee"
and "personal animosity" on the part of unnamed
U.N. delegates following votes by the world
organization that marked a diplomatic defeat for the
United States.
Cuban Developments
Cuba accused the United States yesterday of
"arbitrary and discriminatory action" in prohibiting a
Cuban delegation from participating in an
international sugar conference in Louisiana.
The Fidel Castro regime declared that the 19
Cuban sugar technicians now in New Orleans after
flying there uninvited Tuesday were willing "to
assume any risks" while insisting on their "legitimate
rights."
Although ordered by U.S. officials to return to
Cuba, the technicians have refused to do so.

Oil Spill Suit
SAN FRANCISCO — A federal grand jury indicted
Standard Oil Co. of California and a subsidiary
yesterday on charges of polluting San Francisco Bay
in a massive oil spill last January.
U.S. Atty. James L. Browning Jr. said the
indictment was brought under the 1899 Refuse Act,
which carries a fine for corporate defendants of not
more than $2,500 nor less than $500. Charged with
Standard Oil was the Chevron Shipping Co.
Two Standard Oil tankers, the Arizona Standard
and the Oregon Standard, collided in dense fog near
the Golden Gate Bridge January 18, spilling 840,000
gallons of fuel oil into the bay.
The resulting oil slick blackened beaches and
wildlife on Pacific and bay coasts over a 50-mile area.
Thousands of waterbirds coated with the thick
bunker oil died.
Browning said the case was taken to the grand jury
following an investigation by the Coast Guard and the
Environmental Protection Agency.

Irish 'Shoot To Kill'
BELFAST, NORTHERN IRELAND - The British
Army served notice yesterday its troops here will
shoot to kill children who fire on them in the war
against Irish Republican Army guerrillas.
The warning was issued after two youths,
described as being 12 to 14 years old, sprayed a
British patrol in Belfast with submachine-gun fire and
two more soldiers died in a bomb blast in
Londonderry.
"The troops will shoot to kill any man or child or
woman who happens to shoot at them," said the
Scots Guard company commander. Army
headquarters said he spoke with full authority.
The two boys fired nine shots at a patrol Tuesday
night and the major said his vehicle seemed the target.
"If children fire guns at soldiers, then they will be
shot," Johnson said;

Nixon U.N. Reaction
WASHINGTON — President Nixon, giving a delayed
reaction to Monday night's events that saw the
United Nations admit mainland China and expel
Taiwan, suggested yesterday the result could be
lessened U.S. support and a reshuffling of foreign aid.
Press secretary Ronald L. Zeigler said Nixon was
shocked by what he regarded as "undisguised glee"
and "personal animosity" on the part of unnamed
U.N. delegates following votes by the world
organization that marked a diplomatic defeat for the
United States.
Cuban Developments
Cuba accused the United States yesterday of
"arbitrary and discriminatory action" in prohibiting a
Cuban delegation from participating in an

Cuban sugar technicians now in New Orleans after
flying there uninvited Tuesday were willing "to
assume any risks" while insisting on their "legitimate
rights."
Although ordered by U.S. officials to return to
Cuba, the technicians have refused to do so.
