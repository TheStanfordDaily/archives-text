# Keilch Committee Member Files Complaint Of Report
## 
### BOB BACON 
Roy Boggs, a member of the
grievance committee which heard the
case of fired library worker John
Keilch, filed a grievance of his own
yesterday in connection with that
dispute.
Meanwhile, the committee's
recommendation that Keilch be
dismissed has been delivered to Provost
William Miller, whose final decision is
expected before the end of the week.
Keilch was fired from his library job
in June for his alleged participation in
the April 9 Stanford Hospital sit-in.
During hearings on his bid for
reinstatement, he refused to discuss his
activities on the 9th, since he had
criminal charges pending from the same
incident.
The criminal charges were settled
last week by a bargained plea of guilty
to two of the nine counts with which
he was charged, and last Sunday Keilch
asked that his case be shifted to the
new arbitration procedure put into
effect Monday, or else that his case
before the three-man board be
reopened. In either case, he said, he was
now willing to testify to his

participation in the hospital imbroglio.
On Monday, acting personnel
director Joseph C. Scroggs turned down
Keilch's request for a shift to the new
procedures.
Boggs also sought on Monday to
reopen the case before the three-man
committee, but his two colleagues
refused that request.
In both cases, the reason given was
that the hearings had been closed for
over two weeks. Keilch and Boggs
claimed that the grievance was still "in
process" since the committee
recommendation had not yet been
submitted to Miller.
Scroggs, the other grievance
committee members, and Miller all
ruled that it was too late to reopen the
proceedings.
Keilch's dismissal was recommended
to Miller by a 2-1 vote; Boggs dissented
from a decision made by Professor of
Law Byron Sher and Medical School
Assistant Controller Elwood Pierce.
Boggs wrote a 40-page minority report
which he submitted to Miller yesterday,
but which was released to the press on
October 15.
