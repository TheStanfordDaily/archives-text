# Keilch Committee Member Files Complaint Of Report
## 
### BOB BACON 
Roy Boggs, a member of the
grievance committee which heard the
case of fired library worker John
Keilch, filed a grievance of his own
yesterday in connection with that
dispute.
Meanwhile, the committee's
recommendation that Keilch be
dismissed has been delivered to Provost
William Miller, whose final decision is
expected before the end of the week.
Keilch was fired from his library job
in June for his alleged participation in
the April 9 Stanford Hospital sit-in.
During hearings on his bid for
reinstatement, he refused to discuss his
activities on the 9th, since he had
criminal charges pending from the same
incident.
The criminal charges were settled
last week by a bargained plea of guilty
to two of the nine counts with which
he was charged, and last Sunday Keilch
asked that his case be shifted to the
new arbitration procedure put into
effect Monday, or else that his case
before the three-man board be
reopened. In either case, he said, he was
now willing to testify to his

participation in the hospital imbroglio.
On Monday, acting personnel
director Joseph C. Scroggs turned down
Keilch's request for a shift to the new
procedures.
Boggs also sought on Monday to
reopen the case before the three-man
committee, but his two colleagues
refused that request.
In both cases, the reason given was
that the hearings had been closed for
over two weeks. Keilch and Boggs
claimed that the grievance was still "in
process" since the committee
recommendation had not yet been
submitted to Miller.
Scroggs, the other grievance
committee members, and Miller all
ruled that it was too late to reopen the
proceedings.
Keilch's dismissal was recommended
to Miller by a 2-1 vote; Boggs dissented
from a decision made by Professor of
Law Byron Sher and Medical School
Assistant Controller Elwood Pierce.
Boggs wrote a 40-page minority report
which he submitted to Miller yesterday,
but which was released to the press on
October 15.
Boggs filed the grievance against
Sher and Miller yesterday, claiming
they "acted independently and in
concert to deprive me of my rightful
prerogatives as a duly appointed
member of a university grievance
committee." Sher denied the charges to
the Daily last night.
Boggs claimed in his grievance that
the committee members had agreed to
submit the majority and minority
reports to Miller at the same time, and
that Sher had committed "a breach of
honor and trust" in submitting the
majority portion before Boggs was
prepared to submit the minority report.
Sher denied there was any such
agreement. He also pointed out that
Boggs had released his report to the
press over a week earlier.
Boggs also charged that Sher
submitted the majority statement to
Miller "largely without the knowledge"
of Pierce, chairman of the grievance
panel.
Sher branded that charge "totally
false, as he (Boggs) knows. Every step I
took on Monday was after consultation
and agreement with Pierce," he said.
With Pierce's consent, Sher asked
Miller if, considering the request to

reopen the case, he ought the
majority report. Miller asked that the
report be submitted, and Sher
subsequently did so. At Boggs' request,
the minority report was not presented
to Miller at the same time.
Boggs charged in his grievance that
Sher's consultations with Miller
Monday violated the independence of
the grievance committee from
"intrusive administrators." Sher and
Miller denied that any violation took
place.
Following the submission of the
majority report on Monday, Miller gave
Boggs until Wednesday to present the
minority view. He denounced this
deadline and announced yesterday that
he was submitting the report, together
with a two-page appendix asking for
reopening of the case before an arbiter
in accordance with the new procedure,
"under duress and under protest."
