# Student Body Downs Assessments For Child Center And Minorities
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
Stanford conservatives won the first
round of the ASSU elections yesterday
when the student body voted down
proposed fee assessments to support
the Child Care Centerand four minority
student organizations.
The referendum which would have
charged students $1 during winter and
spring quarters to fund MECHA, the
Black Student Union, the
Asian-American Student Alliance and
the American Indian Program failed by
a massive 1852 to 1145 count,whilethe
$1 winter assessment to finance the

Child Care Center went down 1602 to
1429.
The margin on the child care
referendum could conceivably be
reversed when overseas ballots are
counted on Friday, but Elections
Commissioner Alice Furumoto
estimates that out of approximately
440 ballots mailed out, less than 100
will return, so a different outcome is
unlikely.
The defeat of the assessments was
largely acknowledged as a victory for
the moderate-conservative faction on
campus, who campaigned against the
proposals through organizations like
the Stanford Voluntarists and the Ad
Hoc Committee to Cut the Cost of
Education.
Hocker Happy
"I'm very glad," said a tired Chris
Hocker, who helped count votes for
some six hours last night. Hocker is
chairman of the right-wing Free
Campus Movement, editor of the
conservative newspaper Arena, and a
member of the Voluntarists. "People
who opposed the thing took the
initiative in fighting for the first time,
and it paid off.
"It was probably the first time that
those who support this kind of funding
were ever on the defensive about it, and
they didn't know what to do," he
continued. He said the Voluntarists, a
loosely-knit group composed primarily
of the same conservatives who led the

successful $0 campaign last spring,
"will probably be back again."
Those who backed the referenda
were not so happy.
"It's just another example of white
racism," charged Gil Garcia, MECHA
chairman. "I wasn't really surprised,
because the kids here get everything
from home. Why should they give a
damn? Yeah, I think it probably would
have passed if not for this big fight
against it."
Center Unsure
Judy Sanchez, a member of the
board of directors of the Child Care
Center, called the an ti-assessment
tactics "sneaky. These people just sign
a name like 'Voluntarists.' But what
does that tell you? Nothing. It's still
anonymous. I think they were
responsible for this loss."
Sanchez said the center hasn't
considered an alternative means of
support yet. "We'll just have to submit
proposals to some funding agencies. I
don't know what will happen."
Furumoto said that although there
was still a lack of manpower at
balloting places, the overall situation
was much better than last week when
utter chaos at the polls forced a
four-day postponement of the election.
Results of the senatorial elections
are being compiled at the Computation
Center and should be available in
"three or four days" according to
Furumoto.

who opposed the thing took the
initiative in fighting for the first time,
and it paid off.
"It was probably the first time that
those who support this kind of funding
were ever on the defensive about it, and
they didn't know what to do," he
continued. He said the Voluntarists, a
loosely-knit group composed primarily
of the same conservatives who led the

successful $0 campaign last spring,
"will probably be back again."
Those who backed the referenda
were not so happy.
"It's just another example of white
racism," charged Gil Garcia, MECHA
chairman. "I wasn't really surprised,
because the kids here get everything
from home. Why should they give a
damn? Yeah, I think it probably would
have passed if not for this big fight
against it."
Center Unsure
Judy Sanchez, a member of the
board of directors of the Child Care
Center, called the an ti-assessment
tactics "sneaky. These people just sign
a name like 'Voluntarists.' But what
does that tell you? Nothing. It's still
anonymous. I think they were
responsible for this loss."
Sanchez said the center hasn't
considered an alternative means of
support yet. "We'll just have to submit
proposals to some funding agencies. I
don't know what will happen."
Furumoto said that although there
was still a lack of manpower at
balloting places, the overall situation
was much better than last week when
utter chaos at the polls forced a
four-day postponement of the election.
Results of the senatorial elections
are being compiled at the Computation
Center and should be available in
"three or four days" according to
Furumoto.

ARGUMENT—Suspended English Professor H. Bruce Franklin (center) argues with Santa Clara Sheriff's officers C.D. Marron
(far left) and Donald Tamm (next to Marron). Defense witness Jeff Youdelman (in glasses to right of Franklin) testified
yesterday that police officers grabbed Franklin after this picture was taken.
Stanford conservatives won the first
round of the ASSU elections yesterday
when the student body voted down
proposed fee assessments to support
the Child Care Centerand four minority
student organizations.
The referendum which would have
charged students $1 during winter and
spring quarters to fund MECHA, the
Black Student Union, the
Asian-American Student Alliance and
the American Indian Program failed by
a massive 1852 to 1145 count,whilethe
$1 winter assessment to finance the

Child Care Center went down 1602 to
1429.
The margin on the child care
referendum could conceivably be
reversed when overseas ballots are
counted on Friday, but Elections
Commissioner Alice Furumoto
estimates that out of approximately
440 ballots mailed out, less than 100
will return, so a different outcome is
unlikely.
The defeat of the assessments was
largely acknowledged as a victory for
the moderate-conservative faction on
campus, who campaigned against the
proposals through organizations like
the Stanford Voluntarists and the Ad
Hoc Committee to Cut the Cost of
Education.
Hocker Happy
"I'm very glad," said a tired Chris
Hocker, who helped count votes for
some six hours last night. Hocker is
chairman of the right-wing Free
Campus Movement, editor of the
conservative newspaper Arena, and a
member of the Voluntarists. "People
who opposed the thing took the
