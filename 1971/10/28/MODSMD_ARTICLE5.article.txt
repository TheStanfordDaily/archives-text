# Stanford Kills Plan For Willow Freeway
## 
### DAVE SPECTOR 
Stanford does not plan any major
construction on its portion of Willow
Road following the defeat .of the
Willow Expressway, according to Boyd
Smith, Manager of Real Estate.
The Willow Expressway, a 6.4 mile
road proposed to connect Sand Hill
Road and the Dumbarton Bridge, was
defeated by a 5 to 2 margin in an
advisory vote by Menlo Park residents,
September 14.
Explaining Stanford's reluctance to
improve Willow Road, Smith
commented, "it's a public
responsibility, not ours."
Characterizing the anti-expressway
vote, Smith said, "the cities have a
traffic problem and by putting their
heads in the sand, the problem will not
go away.
"Over 50 percent of the cars using
[Stanford's portion of] Willow Road
do not have a Stanford destination or
origin. Stanford doesn't have an
obligation for building roads for public
use, but people are using Stanford
roads today."
The vote was to determine whether
Menlo Park should continue negotiating
with the State Division of Highways on
building a Willow Expressway with
state funds. Although not required to
do so, the Menlo Park City Council
took the rejection as binding.
If the Expressway had been
approved, the state would have
provided the $44.2 to 45.4 million. The
alternatives now are to do nothing or to
widen Willow Road to four lanes with a
link across El Camino Real. This would

require $10 to 15 million to be raised
through local property taxes.
The Livingston/Blayney Policy Plan
for undeveloped Stanford lands,
released last spring, had claimed that
the University must have a freeway
from El Camino Real to the Junipero
Serra Freeway, regardless of whether it
extends east of El Camino.
"The freeway is needed to serve the
Shopping Center, the Welch Road
office area, and the Medical Center, and
to relieve campus roads of through
traffic. The last function would be
served by the freeway even if it were
not built east of El Camino Real.
Stanford would be inconvenienced, but
it could get along without the east
portion of the freeway if it were
extended west to connect with the
Junipero Serra Freeway."
The University is presently under a
contractural obligation with Palo Alto
to widen the road from Arboretum to
the Shopping Center.
Other University-planned road
building, recommended by the
Livingston/Blayney report, is
undecided now. An extension of
Campus Drive, widening of Alpine
Road and planned connections with
Willow Road were contingent on the
building of the Expressway.
A SWOPSI report, "Balanced
Transportation for Suburban and
Academic Communities,"
recommended that transportation
needs could be met by two underpasses
beneath the Southern Pacific tracks
along the Willow corridor and use of
mass transit options.
