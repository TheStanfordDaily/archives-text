## Decision-Making: At The Med Center And 'Daily' 
### joanne jacobs 
What is truth at 1 a.m. Monday
morning when you've got a five
page paper on Philos of
Alexaidria to type up and all you
want to do is to go home and go
to sleep?
Truth looked very simple and
clear-cut in Bill Evers' "News in
Review" column at 9 a.m.
Monday. All laid out in black and
white with a headline about
"Liberty."
It said that Stanford doctors
obtained a court order to force a
woman to have a blood
transfusion against her religious
beliefs (Jehovah's Witness), her
"express desires." It attacked the
Medical Center staff involved for a
"blow against religious liberty"
and an aggressive invasion of
"their patient's right to control
her own body."
I was involved in the Daily's
coverage of the case, in Sunday
night phone calls, and a long,
emotionally exhausting discussion
of medical and journalistic ethics.
While 1 believe that Bill's story
is basically accurate from his
point of view (And it was an
opinion column run on the
opinions page.), his libertarian
perspective is a limited one, not
doing justice to the complexities
of the case.
Bill never really had a chance,
because Dr. Goodlin, apparently
trying to shield his patient from
embarassment, did not speak
frankly until Sunday night, when
the article had already been
typeset, proof-read, and laid out.

Bill Evers is an intellectual, a
radical libertarian, a moral
absolutist, and a long time writer
to and for the Daily and the
Chaparral. I am a Daily feature
writer, humor columnist,
occasional afternoon editor and
hanger on.
I stopped in at the office
around 8:30 Sunday night to
hand in my Ferd Firko column.
The news editor told me that the
reporter covering some story
about a Jehovah's Witness could
not be reached. He asked me to
"make a few phone ca'ls" and
write up a ten inch news story for
the front page.
It looked very simple. I had
Bill's column to work from
"An 18 year old anemic
woman was about to give birth
prematurely to twins. Her
physician, Dr. Robert Goodlin, an
associate professor of gynecology
and obstetrics in the school of
medicine, believed that a blood
transfusion might be necessary
during delivery in order that the
mother and the babies, once
delivered, might live."
However, as the column then
read: "The woman was a
Jehovah's Witness whose doctrine
forbids such a blodd transfusion.
She did not want a blood
transfusion for herself."
Before the birth, the doctor
telephoned "Cassius Kirk, a staff
counsel in the University's office
for business affairs in Encina, and
said that it might be necessary to
obtain a court order to transfuse

the woman before the delivery."
However the woman gave birth
to a stillborn child and a baby girl
without a blood transfusion
becoming necessary. "Later, when
the woman was still bleeding
several hours after the birth, Kirk
went before a judge of the
superior court and obtained a
court order essentially directing
the doctors to perform the
transfusion."
After reading this account, I
called Dr. Goodlin at his home.
Apologetically, the doctor told
me that Spyros Andreopoulos,
director of the Medical Center
News Service, had phoned him,
asking that all questions be
referred to the information
director. Goodlin had previously
talked to Bill and he seemed
embarrassed to shunt me off.
Andreopoulos urged me to
drop the story, saying that it
would violate medical ethics, the
patient-doctor relationship, the
patient's privacy, etc.
"I know nothing about this
case," the information director
emphasized. After my call he
immediately phoned back and
repeated his position to Fred
Mann, the editor, adding, "I made
it my business not to find out
about it."
Theresa Ramirez, managing
editor, Fred and I discussed
Andreopoulos' views on the
patient-doctor relationship.
However, this story involved a
court hearing, a matter of public
record.

Since Dr. Goodlin had felt it
proper to talk to Bill and the
"News in Review" column was
running on page two, we decided
to call back and see if the doctor
would give me a few facts for the
news story. At this time the front
page was nearly laid out and there
was only space left for a three or
four inch story.
If we had gone along with
Andreopoulos, my story would
have been a brief summary of
Bill's column. And that column
would have called for the firing of
all persons involved in the case
and for a Monday morning picket
at Pres. Lyman's office.
Instead I called back Dr.
Goodlin, repeating what
Andreopoulos had said about
medical ethics. The doctor's
answer blew everything wide
open.
"That couple... it bothers
me," the doctor said. "She was a
very young girl who wasn't
actually a Jehovah's Witness."

However she would not go
against her husbands' religion,
which strictly forbids blood
transfusions. Her refusals were
always framed in terms of her
husband's beliefs. Dr. Goodlin
believed that the girl was "quite
willing if her husband was
willing," but the husband felt he
could not go along.
"The husband was really torn.
They'd only been married a short
time."
The doctor asked for a court
order to authorize the transfusion.
By the time the hearing took
place, the woman had delivered
and was hemorrhaging badly. "It
really looked bad," Dr. Goodlin
told me.
He also said that the Med
Center's case looked weak to him
and he thought the order would
not be given. But during a break
in the hearing when Kirk was
looking for precedents in the law
library, the husband came up to
Dr. Goodlin.

"He told me that he wished the
court would intervene so he
would be relieved of
responsibility." It was the
doctor's impression that this was
said loud enough for the judge to
overhear, may have influenced the
decision, and may have been
meant to do so.
When Judge Ingram (of the
Santa Clara County Superior
Court) did order transfusions for
the baby, which later proved
unnecessary, and for the mother,
he admitted that it was a shaky
opinion that might not be upheld
by a higher court.
After the decision, the
husband, his father, and the
Jehovah's Witness minister
thanked Dr. Goodlin. "It was all
very strange. Even the minister,
who had been very hard-nosed
about the whole thing. That's the
thing that really got to me." They
told Dr. Goodlin to "hurry up"
and do whatever was necessary
before it was too late.

When the transfusion took
place, the woman stopped
bleeding, so that a massive
transfusion turned out to be
unnecessary.
"That couple really went
through hell," Dr. Goodlin
recalled. "It was a sad story."
I believed Dr. Goodlin. He
impressed me as a honest, sincere
and sensitive man. After that
phone call, a three inch story was
impossible and Bill's column
seemed incomplete, misleading
and unfair. But it was too late to
pull the column. I think it was 11"
p.m.
Bill returned to the office
shortly after the call. He
remembered that Dr. Goodlin had
mentioned that the family seemed
relieved when the order
handed down, but Bill
assumed this was resignation and"
had not considered it significant**
at the time.
Now Bill called back Dr.
