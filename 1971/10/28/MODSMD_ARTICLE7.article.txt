# Letter From Dr. Goodlin

### 
I hope that I may be allowed to comment briefly
relative to the article concerning the Jehovah's
Witness and the blood transfusion, since I believe
Mr. Evers has distorted the events surrounding the
court order, at the expense of possible
embarrassment to the patient and her family.
In this, and other hospitals, court orders for
blood transfusions have been obtained on patients
in labor in order to protect the life of the unborn
fetus. We were not able to move fast enough to
accomplish this because this high-risk patient
delivered rather quickly. When it became apparent,
after her delivery that despite the infusion of 9 units
of "blood substitutes", the patient's condition was
still critical because of blood loss, considerable
discussion occurred amongst the staff.
Many points of view were considered but one
factor was that none of us knew the medical-legal
consequences of letting a patient die simply because
he refused a blood transfusion (similar to the
confusion over the medical-legal consequences of
purposefully allowing one's patient to commit
suicide). We agreed that assuming it could be
arranged, a . ourt hearing on the issue would resolve
the matter, plus hopefully allow us to treat the
patient.
When, during the hearing, it appeared that our
request for a court order would be denied, the

patient's husband, in a rather obvious manner, told
me in effect that he wished the court would assume
responsibility for his wife's care as he desperately
wanted her to be treated but couldn't, because of
his faith, agree to blood transfusion on himself or
his wife. The patient herself has previously
expressed similar views after learning of the
impending court hearing.
Without trying to presume the nature of the legal
thinking that occurred, it seemed to me that the
husband's statement was the turning point in the
court making its decision. Immediately after the
verdict the patient's attorney and husband urged me
to start at once with the proper therapy (blood
transfusion).
In preparing his commentary, Mr. Evers did not
interview the patient or review her hospital record
or even the court order. The only witness to the
management of the case that he interviewed was
myself (at 11:15 p.m., Sunday, October 24) and he
rejected my description.
Thus, it is difficult for me to understand the
arrogance and intolerance expressed in the
commentary other than to believe it is part of the
Daily's overall treatment of the Medical Center
staff.
