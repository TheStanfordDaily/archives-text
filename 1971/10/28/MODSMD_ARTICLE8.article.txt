# Dealing With War Criminals
## 
### 
McGeorge Bundy was best
described by LB J: "He's my
intellectual ... my debator", a
hired gun if you will.
McGeorge Bundy, to be
distinguished from his brother Bill
Bundy, first joined up in the early
days of the Kennedy
Administration as the President's
advisor for national security
affairs. Bundy, like his friend
Robert McNamara, was a problem
solver, a brilliant mind, but one
which lacked the anchor of
conviction.
It is with these personality
traits as a background that we can
understand McGeorge Bundy's
role in Vietnam policy making, as
revealed in the Pentagon Papers.
The need to prevent a Communist
"takeover" in South Vietnam was
a given for him, and only
problems of implementation were
germane.
In May, 1961, Bundy helped
JFK formulate plans for
strengthening the Saigon Army,
then when he saw that this was
failing to achieve the desired end,
he was in extensive
communication with Henry Cabot
Lodge concerning the advisability
of a coup to overthrow Ngo Dinh
Diem. When even such radical
measures failed to stem the tide of
unification, new problems arose
and McGeorge Bundy met them
head on.
When it became apparent that
the situation could not be
corrected if action were limited to

the South, Bundy (in his Sept.,
1964 memo) dealt with the
problem of how to punish North
Vietnam covertly. When this, too,
failed, the problem became
mobilization of the American
people for a more overt and
forceful response.
The Gulf of Tonkin incident
seermd to solve this problem.
Bundy was quick, perhaps too
quick, to see the potential of this

incident for stampeding Congress
into action. Once the policy of
selective reprisals of early 1965
had failed, Bundy (in his Feb. 7,
1965 memo) recommended
"sustained reprisals". All these
actions were predicated on
Bundy's firm belief that all
Washington had to do was flex its
muscles, as we did in Cuba, and
North Vietnam would come to its
knees.
It was only at this point, when
the magnitude of the
contradictions of policy became
apparent, that Bundy departed
Washington for the prestige,
power, and respectability of the
directorship of the Ford

Foundation.
Intellectual technicians devoid
of ethical constraints, and policy
makers with no appreciation of
the limits of power, are
dangerous—their actions lead to
profoundly immoral and
misconceived results. CCAS
recently tried to point this out to
Mr. Bundy in a dramatic,
face-to-face manner.

Bundy went to the University
Services Centre in Hong Kong for
lunch. The U.S.C. is an
organization devoted to helping
students do research in Hong
Kong—its primary source of
funding is the Ford Foundation,
so Mr. Bundy must have felt very
much at home. Stanford CCAS
has just received a letter regarding
Mr. Bundy's lunch from a member
now resident in Hong Kong and
working at the U.S.C.:
"For years there have been war
criminals leaving government to
take up new jobs in universities,
foundations, and corporations.
They have long since grown
accustomed to having cozy little
luncheons with intellectuals and
establishment types who think
they've been guilty of very
naughty crimes but have to be
polite and engage in "rational
dialogue" over their coffee and
sandwiches, shaking hands when
it's over and making inane
remarks about respecting each
other's sincerity and upholding
the other's rights to his own
opinion. . ..
"We decided to be a little more
resolute and honest this time, to
make up our own rules from the
environment of protest... we
succeeded. After Ford (the U.S.C.
director) went around the table
introducing everyone present to
Bundy, I stood up and read the
following:
'We have with us today a very
special person. This is McGeorge
Bundy, former presidential
assistant for national security
affairs. We are choosing not to eat
with him. This man bears a deep
personal responsibility for the
massive and brutal intervention by
our country in Indochina.
The fact that he was not a
combat soldier does not disguise
the direct role he played in the
calculated murder of Asian people
by the United States. It is not for
such as he to claim ignorance of
the human consequences of
strategic hamlets,
counter-insurgency teams,
napalm, saturation bombing, etc.
Who was better informed of the

carnage and suffering unleased by
the U.S. government and military '
forces in Vietnam and Laos than
McGeorge Bundy?
Who devoted more time and
energy to the planning and
justification of the crimes
committed in the name of
America than this individual?
Hundreds of thousands of.
Indochinese people and over
50,000 American brothers have
been sacrificed to the immoral
policies of men such as LBJ,
Rostow, McNamara, Rusk,
William Bundy, Westmoreland,
Nixon, Laird, Kissinger, Bunked,
and McGeorge Bundy.
Unfortunately, none of the ■
slaughtered or maimed can be
here with us today to share this •
meal, bear witness to the blood on
this man's hands, or remind iis~
that they cannot forget this very 1
special person. We cannot break
bread with such a person, nor"
engage in pointless discussion with
him. We are here rather to hold a
silent vigil in memory of
Indochina's dead and our own. A£:
scholars of Asia, as
Americans, as human beings, we
ask everyone to join us in this act
of conscience and refuse to eat or
speak with such a man, today or
any other day.
Confronted by the enormity of
McGeorge Bundy's guilt, we must
put aside conventions of courtesy
in order to honor the memory of
countless victims for whom there
will be no more lunches or polite
conversations. Merely to refrain
from eating or speaking with this
man is a mild and inadequate
protest, but it is the best we can
do to demonstrate that we have
not forgotten, nor can we ever
forget, just what this man has
stood for, just what this man has
done.'
"Well, it got him ... He
answered that he was willing to
talk to anyone who wanted to
talk, but his eyes were glazed and
his voice shaking, almost out oT
control. The surprise element was
crucial. Some felt a little sorry for
him, but I did not and could
not.. .
We of Stanford CCAS express
admiration and approval for the
actions of our brothers in Hong
Kong. We cannot personally go to
confront all of the war criminals,
but we can be sure that none of
them rest comfortably, and that
none of them can avoid or forget
the vast burden of guilt they bear.
The people of Indochina will
certainly never forget. Men such
as McGeorge Bundy must be
confronted as many times as
necessary to demonstrate that
America and the world will not
passively accept their crimes
under any name—be it "making
the world democratic", "phased
withdrawal", "protective
reaction", "preventive
interdiction", or its real nam'e,
murder.

Bundy went to the University
Services Centre in Hong Kong for
lunch. The U.S.C. is an
organization devoted to helping
students do research in Hong
Kong—its primary source of
funding is the Ford Foundation,
so Mr. Bundy must have felt very
much at home. Stanford CCAS
has just received a letter regarding
Mr. Bundy's lunch from a member
now resident in Hong Kong and
working at the U.S.C.:
"For years there have been war
criminals leaving government to
take up new jobs in universities,
foundations, and corporations.
They have long since grown
accustomed to having cozy little
luncheons with intellectuals and
establishment types who think
they've been guilty of very
naughty crimes but have to be
polite and engage in "rational
dialogue" over their coffee and
sandwiches, shaking hands when
it's over and making inane
remarks about respecting each
other's sincerity and upholding
the other's rights to his own
opinion. . ..
"We decided to be a little more
resolute and honest this time, to
make up our own rules from the
environment of protest... we
succeeded. After Ford (the U.S.C.
director) went around the table
introducing everyone present to
Bundy, I stood up and read the
following:
'We have with us today a very
special person. This is McGeorge
Bundy, former presidential
assistant for national security
affairs. We are choosing not to eat
with him. This man bears a deep
personal responsibility for the
massive and brutal intervention by
our country in Indochina.
The fact that he was not a
combat soldier does not disguise
the direct role he played in the
calculated murder of Asian people
by the United States. It is not for
such as he to claim ignorance of
the human consequences of
strategic hamlets,
counter-insurgency teams,
napalm, saturation bombing, etc.
Who was better informed of the

carnage and suffering unleased by
the U.S. government and military '
forces in Vietnam and Laos than
McGeorge Bundy?
Who devoted more time and
energy to the planning and
justification of the crimes
committed in the name of
America than this individual?
Hundreds of thousands of.
Indochinese people and over
50,000 American brothers have
been sacrificed to the immoral
policies of men such as LBJ,
Rostow, McNamara, Rusk,
William Bundy, Westmoreland,
Nixon, Laird, Kissinger, Bunked,
and McGeorge Bundy.
Unfortunately, none of the ■
slaughtered or maimed can be
here with us today to share this •
meal, bear witness to the blood on
this man's hands, or remind iis~
that they cannot forget this very 1
special person. We cannot break
bread with such a person, nor"
engage in pointless discussion with
him. We are here rather to hold a
silent vigil in memory of
Indochina's dead and our own. A£:
scholars of Asia, as
Americans, as human beings, we
ask everyone to join us in this act
of conscience and refuse to eat or
speak with such a man, today or
any other day.
Confronted by the enormity of
McGeorge Bundy's guilt, we must
put aside conventions of courtesy
in order to honor the memory of
countless victims for whom there
will be no more lunches or polite
conversations. Merely to refrain
from eating or speaking with this
man is a mild and inadequate
protest, but it is the best we can
do to demonstrate that we have
not forgotten, nor can we ever
forget, just what this man has
stood for, just what this man has
done.'
"Well, it got him ... He
answered that he was willing to
talk to anyone who wanted to
talk, but his eyes were glazed and
his voice shaking, almost out oT
control. The surprise element was
crucial. Some felt a little sorry for
him, but I did not and could
not.. .
We of Stanford CCAS express
admiration and approval for the
actions of our brothers in Hong
Kong. We cannot personally go to
confront all of the war criminals,
but we can be sure that none of
them rest comfortably, and that
none of them can avoid or forget
the vast burden of guilt they bear.
The people of Indochina will
certainly never forget. Men such
as McGeorge Bundy must be
confronted as many times as
necessary to demonstrate that
America and the world will not
passively accept their crimes
under any name—be it "making
the world democratic", "phased
withdrawal", "protective
reaction", "preventive
interdiction", or its real nam'e,
murder.
McGeorge Bundy was best
described by LB J: "He's my
intellectual ... my debator", a
hired gun if you will.
McGeorge Bundy, to be
distinguished from his brother Bill
Bundy, first joined up in the early
days of the Kennedy
Administration as the President's
advisor for national security
affairs. Bundy, like his friend
Robert McNamara, was a problem
solver, a brilliant mind, but one
which lacked the anchor of
conviction.
It is with these personality
traits as a background that we can
understand McGeorge Bundy's
role in Vietnam policy making, as
revealed in the Pentagon Papers.
The need to prevent a Communist
"takeover" in South Vietnam was
a given for him, and only
problems of implementation were
germane.
In May, 1961, Bundy helped
JFK formulate plans for
strengthening the Saigon Army,
then when he saw that this was
failing to achieve the desired end,
he was in extensive
communication with Henry Cabot
Lodge concerning the advisability
of a coup to overthrow Ngo Dinh
Diem. When even such radical
measures failed to stem the tide of
unification, new problems arose
and McGeorge Bundy met them
head on.
When it became apparent that
the situation could not be
corrected if action were limited to

the South, Bundy (in his Sept.,
1964 memo) dealt with the
problem of how to punish North
Vietnam covertly. When this, too,
failed, the problem became
mobilization of the American
people for a more overt and
forceful response.
The Gulf of Tonkin incident
seermd to solve this problem.
Bundy was quick, perhaps too
quick, to see the potential of this

incident for stampeding Congress
into action. Once the policy of
selective reprisals of early 1965
had failed, Bundy (in his Feb. 7,
1965 memo) recommended
"sustained reprisals". All these
actions were predicated on
Bundy's firm belief that all
Washington had to do was flex its
muscles, as we did in Cuba, and
North Vietnam would come to its
knees.
It was only at this point, when
the magnitude of the
contradictions of policy became
apparent, that Bundy departed
Washington for the prestige,
power, and respectability of the
directorship of the Ford

Foundation.
Intellectual technicians devoid
of ethical constraints, and policy
makers with no appreciation of
the limits of power, are
dangerous—their actions lead to
profoundly immoral and
misconceived results. CCAS

Confronted by the enormity of

put aside conventions of courtesy
in order to honor the memory of
countless victims for whom there

from eating or speaking with this

We of Stanford CCAS express
admiration and approval for the
actions of our brothers in Hong
Kong. We cannot personally go to
confront all of the war criminals,
but we can be sure that none of
them rest comfortably, and that
none of them can avoid or forget
the vast burden of guilt they bear.
The people of Indochina will
certainly never forget. Men such
as McGeorge Bundy must be
confronted as many times as
necessary to demonstrate that
America and the world will not
passively accept their crimes
under any name—be it "making
the world democratic", "phased
withdrawal", "protective
reaction", "preventive
interdiction", or its real nam'e,
murder.
McGeorge Bundy was best
described by LB J: "He's my
intellectual ... my debator", a
hired gun if you will.
McGeorge Bundy, to be
distinguished from his brother Bill
Bundy, first joined up in the early
days of the Kennedy
Administration as the President's
advisor for national security
affairs. Bundy, like his friend
Robert McNamara, was a problem
solver, a brilliant mind, but one
which lacked the anchor of
conviction.
It is with these personality
traits as a background that we can
understand McGeorge Bundy's
role in Vietnam policy making, as
revealed in the Pentagon Papers.
The need to prevent a Communist
"takeover" in South Vietnam was
a given for him, and only
problems of implementation were
germane.
In May, 1961, Bundy helped
JFK formulate plans for
strengthening the Saigon Army,
then when he saw that this was
failing to achieve the desired end,
he was in extensive
communication with Henry Cabot
Lodge concerning the advisability
of a coup to overthrow Ngo Dinh
Diem. When even such radical
measures failed to stem the tide of
unification, new problems arose
and McGeorge Bundy met them
head on.
When it became apparent that
the situation could not be
corrected if action were limited to

the South, Bundy (in his Sept.,
1964 memo) dealt with the
problem of how to punish North
Vietnam covertly. When this, too,
failed, the problem became
mobilization of the American
people for a more overt and
forceful response.
The Gulf of Tonkin incident
seermd to solve this problem.
Bundy was quick, perhaps too
quick, to see the potential of this

incident for stampeding Congress
into action. Once the policy of
selective reprisals of early 1965
had failed, Bundy (in his Feb. 7,
1965 memo) recommended
"sustained reprisals". All these
actions were predicated on
Bundy's firm belief that all
Washington had to do was flex its
muscles, as we did in Cuba, and
North Vietnam would come to its
knees.
It was only at this point, when
the magnitude of the
contradictions of policy became
apparent, that Bundy departed
Washington for the prestige,
power, and respectability of the
directorship of the Ford

Foundation.
Intellectual technicians devoid
of ethical constraints, and policy
makers with no appreciation of
the limits of power, are
dangerous—their actions lead to
profoundly immoral and
misconceived results. CCAS
recently tried to point this out to
Mr. Bundy in a dramatic,
face-to-face manner.

interdiction", or its real nam'e,
murder.
McGeorge Bundy was best
described by LB J: "He's my
intellectual ... my debator", a
hired gun if you will.
McGeorge Bundy, to be
distinguished from his brother Bill
Bundy, first joined up in the early
days of the Kennedy
Administration as the President's
advisor for national security
affairs. Bundy, like his friend
Robert McNamara, was a problem
solver, a brilliant mind, but one
which lacked the anchor of
conviction.
It is with these personality
traits as a background that we can
understand McGeorge Bundy's
role in Vietnam policy making, as
revealed in the Pentagon Papers.
The need to prevent a Communist
"takeover" in South Vietnam was
a given for him, and only
problems of implementation were
germane.
In May, 1961, Bundy helped
JFK formulate plans for
strengthening the Saigon Army,
then when he saw that this was
failing to achieve the desired end,
he was in extensive
communication with Henry Cabot
Lodge concerning the advisability
of a coup to overthrow Ngo Dinh
Diem. When even such radical
measures failed to stem the tide of
unification, new problems arose
and McGeorge Bundy met them
head on.
When it became apparent that
the situation could not be
corrected if action were limited to

the South, Bundy (in his Sept.,
1964 memo) dealt with the
problem of how to punish North
Vietnam covertly. When this, too,
failed, the problem became
mobilization of the American
people for a more overt and
forceful response.
The Gulf of Tonkin incident
seermd to solve this problem.
Bundy was quick, perhaps too
quick, to see the potential of this

incident for stampeding Congress
into action. Once the policy of
selective reprisals of early 1965
had failed, Bundy (in his Feb. 7,
1965 memo) recommended
"sustained reprisals". All these
actions were predicated on
Bundy's firm belief that all
Washington had to do was flex its
muscles, as we did in Cuba, and
North Vietnam would come to its
knees.
It was only at this point, when
the magnitude of the
contradictions of policy became
apparent, that Bundy departed
Washington for the prestige,
power, and respectability of the
directorship of the Ford

Foundation.
Intellectual technicians devoid
of ethical constraints, and policy
makers with no appreciation of
the limits of power, are
dangerous—their actions lead to
profoundly immoral and
misconceived results. CCAS
recently tried to point this out to
Mr. Bundy in a dramatic,
face-to-face manner.

Bundy went to the University
Services Centre in Hong Kong for
lunch. The U.S.C. is an
organization devoted to helping
students do research in Hong
Kong—its primary source of
funding is the Ford Foundation,
so Mr. Bundy must have felt very
much at home. Stanford CCAS
has just received a letter regarding
Mr. Bundy's lunch from a member
now resident in Hong Kong and
working at the U.S.C.:
"For years there have been war
criminals leaving government to
take up new jobs in universities,
foundations, and corporations.
They have long since grown
accustomed to having cozy little
luncheons with intellectuals and
establishment types who think
they've been guilty of very
naughty crimes but have to be
polite and engage in "rational
dialogue" over their coffee and
sandwiches, shaking hands when
it's over and making inane
remarks about respecting each
other's sincerity and upholding
the other's rights to his own
opinion. . ..
"We decided to be a little more
resolute and honest this time, to
make up our own rules from the
environment of protest... we
succeeded. After Ford (the U.S.C.
director) went around the table
introducing everyone present to
Bundy, I stood up and read the
following:
'We have with us today a very
special person. This is McGeorge
Bundy, former presidential
assistant for national security
affairs. We are choosing not to eat
with him. This man bears a deep
personal responsibility for the
massive and brutal intervention by
our country in Indochina.
The fact that he was not a
combat soldier does not disguise
the direct role he played in the
calculated murder of Asian people
by the United States. It is not for
such as he to claim ignorance of
the human consequences of
strategic hamlets,
counter-insurgency teams,
napalm, saturation bombing, etc.
Who was better informed of the

carnage and suffering unleased by
the U.S. government and military '
forces in Vietnam and Laos than
McGeorge Bundy?
Who devoted more time and
energy to the planning and
justification of the crimes
committed in the name of
America than this individual?
Hundreds of thousands of.
Indochinese people and over
50,000 American brothers have
been sacrificed to the immoral
policies of men such as LBJ,
Rostow, McNamara, Rusk,
William Bundy, Westmoreland,
Nixon, Laird, Kissinger, Bunked,
and McGeorge Bundy.
Unfortunately, none of the ■
slaughtered or maimed can be
here with us today to share this •
meal, bear witness to the blood on
this man's hands, or remind iis~
that they cannot forget this very 1
special person. We cannot break
bread with such a person, nor"
engage in pointless discussion with
him. We are here rather to hold a
silent vigil in memory of
Indochina's dead and our own. A£:
scholars of Asia, as
Americans, as human beings, we
ask everyone to join us in this act
of conscience and refuse to eat or
speak with such a man, today or
any other day.
Confronted by the enormity of
McGeorge Bundy's guilt, we must
put aside conventions of courtesy
in order to honor the memory of
countless victims for whom there
will be no more lunches or polite
conversations. Merely to refrain
from eating or speaking with this
man is a mild and inadequate
protest, but it is the best we can
do to demonstrate that we have
not forgotten, nor can we ever
forget, just what this man has
stood for, just what this man has
done.'
"Well, it got him ... He
answered that he was willing to
talk to anyone who wanted to
talk, but his eyes were glazed and
his voice shaking, almost out oT
control. The surprise element was
crucial. Some felt a little sorry for
him, but I did not and could
not.. .
We of Stanford CCAS express
admiration and approval for the
actions of our brothers in Hong
Kong. We cannot personally go to
confront all of the war criminals,
but we can be sure that none of
them rest comfortably, and that
none of them can avoid or forget
the vast burden of guilt they bear.
The people of Indochina will
certainly never forget. Men such
as McGeorge Bundy must be
confronted as many times as
necessary to demonstrate that
America and the world will not
passively accept their crimes
under any name—be it "making
the world democratic", "phased
withdrawal", "protective
reaction", "preventive
interdiction", or its real nam'e,
murder.
