## Pakistan & Power Politics 
### 
Pakistan was mendaciously
created by the British when they
were faced with the inevitable
granting of independance to India,
at the end of the second World
War. Pakistan is a land of 110
million Muslims, fed every hour of
their lives with anti-Indian
propaganda, pampered,
patronized and armed in turn by
Britain, the United States of
America and China, against their
(Pakistan's) self declared enemy
no. 1, India, in an utterly immoral
and inhumanly callous game the
super powers choose to call
'balance of power'.
Pakistan is a medieval,
theocratic, intolerant, military

state where all non-Muslims are
third class citizens, and even the
70 million Muslims of East
Pakistan are second class citizens.
Pakistan, over the years has laid
claims to various chunks of Indian
territory along its entire border
with India, and encouraged by
arms gifted by the United States
and China, has committed
aggression on India on three
separate occasions since 1947.
Once again, with the United
States looking the other way and
China goading it onwards,
Pakistan is threatening to attack
India to divert world attention
from its barbaric and brutal
actions in East Pakistan.
In the decade of the fifties,
Pakistan was armed by the United
States as an ally against China and
Russia. In the decade of the
sixties, Pakistan was further
armed by the United States to
prevent it from becoming an ally
of China. In the seventies,
Pakistan is still being armed by
the United States, we are told by

i jamshed dastur

the American press and the
American government, to prevent
it from becoming a greater ally of
China than it is today, and to
facilitate a trip to Peking by Mr.
Nixon.
The fact that these American
arms are being used to murder a
million wretched people and to
brutally supress the freedom of
some 70 million people, we are
told, is no concern of the United
States—the heroic guardians of
freedom of the South Vietnamese.
I am at a loss to decide who
are the greater idiots—those who
fabricate these utterly stupid
theories, or the American people
who are supposed to believe them.
There is of course the possibility
that I may be wrong, and this may
only happen to be another
manifestation of the utter
indifference and contempt with
which the white man treats all life
other than white. Come to think
of it, I am wrong.

prevent it from becoming an ally
of China. In the seventies,
Pakistan is still being armed by
the United States, we are told by

i jamshed dastur

the American press and the
American government, to prevent
it from becoming a greater ally of
China than it is today, and to
facilitate a trip to Peking by Mr.
Nixon.
The fact that these American
arms are being used to murder a
million wretched people and to
brutally supress the freedom of
some 70 million people, we are
told, is no concern of the United
States—the heroic guardians of
freedom of the South Vietnamese.
I am at a loss to decide who
are the greater idiots—those who
fabricate these utterly stupid
theories, or the American people
who are supposed to believe them.
There is of course the possibility
that I may be wrong, and this may
only happen to be another
manifestation of the utter
indifference and contempt with
which the white man treats all life
other than white. Come to think
of it, I am wrong.

Pakistan was mendaciously
created by the British when they
were faced with the inevitable
granting of independance to India,
at the end of the second World
War. Pakistan is a land of 110
million Muslims, fed every hour of
their lives with anti-Indian
propaganda, pampered,
patronized and armed in turn by
Britain, the United States of
America and China, against their
(Pakistan's) self declared enemy
no. 1, India, in an utterly immoral
and inhumanly callous game the
super powers choose to call
'balance of power'.
Pakistan is a medieval,
theocratic, intolerant, military

state where all non-Muslims are
third class citizens, and even the
70 million Muslims of East
Pakistan are second class citizens.
Pakistan, over the years has laid
claims to various chunks of Indian
territory along its entire border
with India, and encouraged by
arms gifted by the United States
and China, has committed
aggression on India on three
separate occasions since 1947.
Once again, with the United
States looking the other way and
China goading it onwards,
Pakistan is threatening to attack
India to divert world attention
from its barbaric and brutal
actions in East Pakistan.
In the decade of the fifties,
Pakistan was armed by the United
States as an ally against China and
Russia. In the decade of the
sixties, Pakistan was further
armed by the United States to
prevent it from becoming an ally
of China. In the seventies,
Pakistan is still being armed by
the United States, we are told by
