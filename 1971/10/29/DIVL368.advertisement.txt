Tortured
for^^!
, Milan Haimovici
Lutheran pastor Milan Haimo
vici spent eight years in Ro
manian jails passing through
indescribable tortures. The
Communists placed him bare
« foot on burning coals. He was
savagely beaten in the groin
and made to empty barrels
filled with the human waste of
thousands of prisoners with his
own hands. However, his faith
withstood all these trials. Even
Communist officers as they
spoke later about it, were filled
with such respect that they
took off their hats when speak
ing about this living saint.
Thousands of Christian pris
oners died in Romanian Com
munist jails. A complete ac
count of their courageous faith
and stand for the Lord is con
tained in the book TORTURED
FOR CHRIST, by Rev. Richard
Wurmbrand, a bestseller in 25
languages.

of our persecuted brethren
