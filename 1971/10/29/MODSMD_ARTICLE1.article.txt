# Band To Vote On Whether To Open Ranks To Women
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Will the movement for women's
equality reach into the Incomperable
Leland Stanford Junior University
Marching Band?
That question may be decided this
afternoon, when the Stanford Band
votes on whether or not to abandon its
traditional male-only membership
policy.
According to band manager Dave
Ruiz the vote is being held although
"only about two percent of the band
membership, three people out of 178,
brought up the issue in the first place."
The matter first arose several weeks
ago, when a small group of band
members requested that the band as a
whole discuss the issue.
"At the time, there was a lot doing,
and we didn't want to get into it just
then, so we waited until now," said
Ruiz.
Wednesday Meeting
At Wednesday's band meeting, the
issue was discussed in an "open
forum." At the meeting, according to
one band member, sentiment ran
approximately 3-1 opposed to allowing
women into the organization.
Sheri Cooper, one of the Dollies,
said that the movement for allowing
women in the band was the result of "a
couple of guys starting an
undercurrent."
She said that allowing women in the
band would "really change the role of
the Dollies," who are now the only
women associated with the band.
Dollies Too?
"You're not about to integrate the
Dollies, so why integrate the band?"
she asked. "There's just no need."
She expressed the fear that the
presence of women would inhibit the
band's "gross-out spirit."
Ruiz was extremely upset when he
found that the Daily had learned of the
upcoming vote. He said that the band
"didn't want some women's lib group
looking over our shoulder while we
discussed this, saying, 'You're just a
chauvinist pig group'."
No Publicity
He said that there had been an
agreement reached at the Wednesday
meeting that "it would be better for
the band if there was no publicity
about this." By late Wednesday night,
however, the Daily had learned of the
impending referendum.

Ruiz expressed the fear that "we
may not be able to consider the results
of the survey valid if there is a lot of
publicity."
He repeatedly stressed that it was
only a small group of people who
wanted the election. "We have not been
approached by any girl wanting to
join," he asserted.
Us? Chauvinists?
One band member, who was one of
those pushing for a decision one way or
the other, said, "What gets me is that
all the time the band is saying, 'We
won't allow girls in,' it's also saying,
'Who, us? We're not chauvinists'."
Ruiz listed several reasons why he
feels that "now is not the time for the
band to go co-ed." Chief among these is
that the added expense of providing
separate facilities for men and women
would force a cut-back in the number
of people in the program.
"For instance, when the band went
to Missouri, we slept on a gym floor. In
something like that, even if we
wouldn't want to, the University would
force us to provide separate facilities
for men and women."
Can't Afford It
"Right now, we have 178 in the
band, an all-time high. If we had to
provide separate facilities, it would

mean that we just couldn't afford to
take that many people."
"If the band votes to allow women,
I foresee a drastic cut-back in the
number of people in the program."
Ruiz also expressed the fear that
women in the band would be
detrimental to spirit. "A major part of
the band's spirit is that it is a
self-contained unit.
"I feel there is a time for the band
to become co-ed, but this is just not the
time. We're happy with the way things
have gone now."
And, although he admitted that the
results of the vote will be binding, he
says that "I feel personally that nothing
will come about."

chauvinist pig group'."
No Publicity
He said that there had been an
agreement reached at the Wednesday
meeting that "it would be better for
the band if there was no publicity
about this." By late Wednesday night,
however, the Daily had learned of the
impending referendum.

Ruiz expressed the fear that "we
may not be able to consider the results
of the survey valid if there is a lot of
publicity."
He repeatedly stressed that it was
only a small group of people who
wanted the election. "We have not been
approached by any girl wanting to
join," he asserted.
Us? Chauvinists?
One band member, who was one of
those pushing for a decision one way or
the other, said, "What gets me is that
all the time the band is saying, 'We
won't allow girls in,' it's also saying,
'Who, us? We're not chauvinists'."
Ruiz listed several reasons why he
feels that "now is not the time for the
band to go co-ed." Chief among these is
that the added expense of providing
separate facilities for men and women
would force a cut-back in the number
of people in the program.
"For instance, when the band went
to Missouri, we slept on a gym floor. In
something like that, even if we
wouldn't want to, the University would
force us to provide separate facilities
for men and women."
Can't Afford It
"Right now, we have 178 in the
band, an all-time high. If we had to
provide separate facilities, it would

mean that we just couldn't afford to
take that many people."
"If the band votes to allow women,
I foresee a drastic cut-back in the
number of people in the program."
Ruiz also expressed the fear that
women in the band would be
detrimental to spirit. "A major part of
the band's spirit is that it is a
self-contained unit.
"I feel there is a time for the band
to become co-ed, but this is just not the
time. We're happy with the way things
have gone now."
And, although he admitted that the
results of the vote will be binding, he
says that "I feel personally that nothing
will come about."


MORE The Leland Stanford Junior University Marching Band votes this afternoon on whether oVnoUrwu"
J° in - Several have attacked the present policy of male-only membership. The issue, brought before
the entire group for discussion Wednesday, will come to a head today.
Will the movement for women's
equality reach into the Incomperable
Leland Stanford Junior University
Marching Band?
That question may be decided this
afternoon, when the Stanford Band
votes on whether or not to abandon its
traditional male-only membership
policy.
According to band manager Dave
Ruiz the vote is being held although
"only about two percent of the band
membership, three people out of 178,
brought up the issue in the first place."
The matter first arose several weeks
ago, when a small group of band
members requested that the band as a
whole discuss the issue.
"At the time, there was a lot doing,
and we didn't want to get into it just
then, so we waited until now," said
Ruiz.
Wednesday Meeting
At Wednesday's band meeting, the
issue was discussed in an "open
forum." At the meeting, according to
one band member, sentiment ran
approximately 3-1 opposed to allowing
women into the organization.
Sheri Cooper, one of the Dollies,
said that the movement for allowing
women in the band was the result of "a
couple of guys starting an
undercurrent."
She said that allowing women in the
band would "really change the role of
the Dollies," who are now the only
women associated with the band.
Dollies Too?
"You're not about to integrate the
Dollies, so why integrate the band?"
she asked. "There's just no need."
She expressed the fear that the
presence of women would inhibit the
band's "gross-out spirit."
Ruiz was extremely upset when he
found that the Daily had learned of the
upcoming vote. He said that the band
"didn't want some women's lib group
looking over our shoulder while we
discussed this, saying, 'You're just a
chauvinist pig group'."
No Publicity
He said that there had been an
agreement reached at the Wednesday
meeting that "it would be better for
the band if there was no publicity
