# Laws On Married Women
## 
### EMMA PRICE 
Dr. Herma Kay, a professor of Family Law at Boalt Law
School, Berkeley, discussed married women and the law at
a Women's conference last week-end.
"Very few women understand the laws on marriage
when they get married," she stated.
"Several people have suggested that men and women
take a test on the marriage laws before they get married,
similar to the written test you take before getting a driver's
license," she added.
Kay has been working intensively on a model marriage
law which would make men and women equal in marriage.
She was on a list of women qualified to be on the Supreme
Court submitted by Senator George McGovern to President
Nixon.
She made the following points about married women
and the law.
PROPERTY—At the present time, California has communal
property laws. This means that property acquired after
marriage belongs to both partners.
However, it is under the management and control of the
husband. The wife has no right to control communal
property.
If the husband gives the property away to a third party
the wife can sue to get the property back. However, when
it comes back it is once again under the husband's control
The wife can control her own earnings if she works.
SUPPORT—The husband has the duty to support his wife
and children, even if the wife and children earn money of
their own. However, the husband never has to spend all his
income to support his family. If he keeps his family in
reasonable style, he can spend all the rest of his money on
whatever he likes.
If a husband moves to take a new job the wife must
follow him, provided the new job is as good as the old one.
At the moment there is a test case in court of a woman
who gave up her career to put her husband through college
and graduate school. After graduate school he divorced her.
She is now arguing that he must put her through graduate

school on a return of capital theory.
DlVORCE—California provides for an even division of
community property when the couple gets divorced.
Alimony in California is determined by the length of the
marriage and the ability of the wife to support herself.
" The burden of proof is on the women," Kay emphasized.
There is a myth today that many American women are
living a free and easy life on alimony payments. This is not
true, according to Kay.
In one survey she cited, 60 percent of husbands did not
pay the full alimony and child support payment during the
first year after the divorce. This percentage increased with
time.
"One problem is that the wife has a tendency not to
fight for her rights. She decides she wants a friendly
divorce," Kay stated.
"Another problem is that there is a definite lack of
institutions to enforce alimony and child support. District
attorneys usually act as if women are bothering them when
they ask the D.A. to prosecute," she added.
There is a statutory preference for young children to be
given to the care of the mothers in a divorce case. Often,
however, the mother has to act morally upright or else the
judge will give the child to the father.
SEX—A husband is legally entitled to reasonable sexual
relations with his wife. In other words, she cannot
continually refuse his sexual advances.
If a third party interferes with a husband's sexual rights,
the husband can take various tort actions as well as criminal
actions. These are known as suits for loss of the wife's
services.
DOMICILE—A married woman assumes her husband's
domicile. Thus, if a California woman marries a who is
a resident of Nevada, she becomes a resident of Nevada.
Therefory she can no longer pay in-state tuition at
California colleges.
NAME—The law is not specific about whether a woman has
to change her name on marriage, according to Kay. Because
it was always assumed that the woman would change her
name, no specific laws were ever written on the subject.

In one survey she cited, 60 percent of husbands did not
pay the full alimony and child support payment during the
first year after the divorce. This percentage increased with
time.
"One problem is that the wife has a tendency not to
fight for her rights. She decides she wants a friendly
divorce," Kay stated.
"Another problem is that there is a definite lack of
institutions to enforce alimony and child support. District
attorneys usually act as if women are bothering them when
they ask the D.A. to prosecute," she added.
There is a statutory preference for young children to be
given to the care of the mothers in a divorce case. Often,
however, the mother has to act morally upright or else the
judge will give the child to the father.
SEX—A husband is legally entitled to reasonable sexual
relations with his wife. In other words, she cannot
continually refuse his sexual advances.
If a third party interferes with a husband's sexual rights,
the husband can take various tort actions as well as criminal
actions. These are known as suits for loss of the wife's
services.
DOMICILE—A married woman assumes her husband's
domicile. Thus, if a California woman marries a who is
a resident of Nevada, she becomes a resident of Nevada.
Therefory she can no longer pay in-state tuition at
California colleges.
NAME—The law is not specific about whether a woman has
to change her name on marriage, according to Kay. Because
it was always assumed that the woman would change her
name, no specific laws were ever written on the subject.
Dr. Herma Kay, a professor of Family Law at Boalt Law
School, Berkeley, discussed married women and the law at
a Women's conference last week-end.
"Very few women understand the laws on marriage
when they get married," she stated.
"Several people have suggested that men and women
take a test on the marriage laws before they get married,
similar to the written test you take before getting a driver's
license," she added.
Kay has been working intensively on a model marriage
law which would make men and women equal in marriage.
She was on a list of women qualified to be on the Supreme
Court submitted by Senator George McGovern to President
Nixon.
She made the following points about married women
and the law.
PROPERTY—At the present time, California has communal
property laws. This means that property acquired after
marriage belongs to both partners.
However, it is under the management and control of the
husband. The wife has no right to control communal
property.
If the husband gives the property away to a third party
the wife can sue to get the property back. However, when
it comes back it is once again under the husband's control
The wife can control her own earnings if she works.
SUPPORT—The husband has the duty to support his wife
and children, even if the wife and children earn money of
their own. However, the husband never has to spend all his
income to support his family. If he keeps his family in
reasonable style, he can spend all the rest of his money on
whatever he likes.
If a husband moves to take a new job the wife must
follow him, provided the new job is as good as the old one.
At the moment there is a test case in court of a woman
who gave up her career to put her husband through college
and graduate school. After graduate school he divorced her.
She is now arguing that he must put her through graduate

school on a return of capital theory.
DlVORCE—California provides for an even division of
community property when the couple gets divorced.
Alimony in California is determined by the length of the
marriage and the ability of the wife to support herself.
" The burden of proof is on the women," Kay emphasized.
There is a myth today that many American women are
living a free and easy life on alimony payments. This is not
true, according to Kay.
In one survey she cited, 60 percent of husbands did not
pay the full alimony and child support payment during the
