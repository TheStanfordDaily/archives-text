## How To Fix A Lamp 
### 
Lamps that flicker or won't turn on
are generally fairly easy to fix.
The first step is to check all the
simple obvious things. Make sure the
bulb is screwed in tight and the lamp is
plugged in. Try changing the bulb.
Everyone knows how ridiculous you
feel when you decide a lamp is
hopelessly broken and then someone
else walks in and points out that it is
simply unplugged.
If none of the simple cures works,
the problem is in the lamp itself.
Disconnect the plug from the wall
socket. The unscrew the bulb and look
in the socket.
Some kinds of sockets have two tiny
screws on the bottom of the socket,
one on each side. If your light is that
kind, try tightening the screws with a
tiny screw driver.
Then look at the metal tab in the
center of the socket bottom. If it is
dirty, scrape it clean with the tip of a
knife blade.
If neither of these works, you need a
new socket. Buy one at the hardware
store, just like the one you have now.
Be sure to buy a new socket with the
same kind of switch as the old one:
push-button, turn-knob, pull-chain, etc.
Sockets work like this. The metal
shell (1) covers an insulating fiber shell
(2). This all fits over the socket body,
which has the switch (3). Underneath
this is an insulated fiber inner cap (4)

with a metal outer cap (5) surrounding
it.
All parts snap together. Wire
connections are shown.
To remove the old socket look at its
metal shell (1), for the spot marked
"press." Then squeeze the shell so that
your thumb presses the "press" spot.
You can then lift the socket shell out
of the metal outer cap (5).
You can now see the wires and the
terminals to which they connect.
Disconnect the wires and the terminals
to which they connect. Disconnect the
wires and lift the old socket unit out.
If your new socket body is the same
size as the old one, the shell of the new
socket should fit right inside the old
outer cap.
Now connect the wires to the new
socket. There are only two wires and
two terminals. One of the terminal
screws is brass and the other is chrome.
If one of the lamp wires is black and
the other one is white, connect the
black one to the brass terminal and the
white one to the chrome terminal
Generally it doesn't matter which
wire you connect to which terminal
except with very old lamps.
To finish, just slip the socket shell
(1) with its insulating inner liner. (2)
over the switch and socket unit (3) and
into the base cap (5). It snaps into
place.
