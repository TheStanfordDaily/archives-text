# A 						Friend Leaves
## Why Follow Your Man? 
### Robin Schulberg 
I got a letter the other day from a
friend who was giving up her teaching
job to move to Vancouver to be with
her boyfriend.
That seemed exactly what the
women's liberation movement was
against, she wrote, but that was what
she wanted to do and that was why she
never read feminist writings.
Her attitude meant three things to
me. First, she pictured all women in the
women's movement as tough females
who did not want anything to do with
men.
Second, since she was ready to drop
her career in order to be with her
boyfriend, she felt she was too weak to
be in the women's movement.
And third, since she was choosing to
move to be with her boyfriend and
since feminists say women are
oppressed by having to follow their
men around, she thought women's
liberation was incorrectly analyzing
what women were like and what we
wanted.
Happy Without a Man
The reasoning behind "Having a man
is the most important thing to me.. .so
women's liberation is either not for me
or wrong" is common. In fact, the
feeling that we cannot be happy
without a man/boyfriend/lover/
husband is almost universal amonf
women raised in our culture.
To the extent that we can generalize
about women's liberation, this goes for
women in the movement too. Those of
us who are working in the movement
are not freaks or superbeings; we have
needs just like those of all women.
Women in our culture thus become
dependent on the men they date/live
with/marry. That is a principal way in
which we are oppressed.
My friend who was moving to
Vancouver was not making a free
choice. She had been conditioned to
want to be with her boyfriend so it was
inevitable that she would make that
decision.

Saying "I'm too weak to be in the
women's movement" is the same thing
as saying "I'm too weak to be the
breadwinner for the family," or "I'm
too weak to go on a camping trip
without a man."
It is hard for a woman to support
her family, since women are paid less
than men. But the fact that she might
not be able to get a job with decent pay
does not mean that she should feel
worthless and resign herself to being a
housewife. She should join her sisters in
fighting for higher wages.
A basic premise of the women's
movement is that our problems are not
individual ones. For centuries, each
woman has felt guilty about what she
imagines is wrong with her. Instead we
should feel angry about being part of
an oppressed group.
Hippies
The individual female guilt trip is
currently being reinvigorated by male
hippy culture. The new ethic is that
women are somehow supposed to
instantaneously transform themselves
into groovy chicks who are not
dependent on their man but who give
him space to do his own thing.
In reality, this is not the start of a
new type of liberated relationship; it is
a new way for the man to escape the

responsibility inherent in a long-term
connection. When, predictably enough,
a woman cannot make the
miracle-change, she turns on herself
with feelings of weakness,
"uncoolness," and guilt.
Unfortunately, some of her sisters
reinforce that guilt. To those of you
who identify with women's
liberationâ€”have you ever walked by a
woman dressed like a model and felt
disdain towards her? And then have
you realized that if this woman picked
up the signals you were sending, she
would probably not decide to change?
The women's movement is in the
precarious position of having to attack
the qualities which most women have
been forced to have without attacking
these women. Sometimes, the
distinction is blurred, particularly with
the help (or hindrance) of the mass
media.
It begins to look like "the tough,
karate-kicking feminist in blue jeans" is
attacking "the average housewife."
So it is critical to remember that we
must be together if we are to bring
about change. The movement is
doomed from the start unless we all try
to meet at a revolutionary level of
consciousness.

The Daily Women's Forum grew out of a need felt by many women on the
Stanford campus to communicate with each other. It is an open page; we welcome
any and all articles which relate to issues concerning women.
The Forum will be published with a minimum of editorial guidance. There is
certainly no "line " which the page is pushing. Pieces can take any form. Wf would
like factual articles, opinion, fiction, personal experiences, analyses, poems,
graphics, photographs, manifestoes, or anything else you feel like submitting.
If you would like to contribute to the page or if you would like to work on
creating and editing it (and if you have never worked on a newspaper before, but
want to learn how to do it, don't hesitate!) then come by the Daily office or call
x4632 and ask for Emma Price.
