## Women Professors Reactions To Report 
### KATHLEEN MORTON 
". . .many women who actually
work at Stanford. . .feel that a strong
climate of discouragement for women
has existed here. This feeling will most
likely not result in armed warfare
between the sexes on the Quad, but it
does continue to create a sense of
distrust and low expectation."
(Miner's Report to the
President on the Status
of Women in the University.)
There are at least three women
professors who disagree: Edith Dowley
(psychology and education), Eleanor

Maccoby (psychology) and Anne
Mellor (English).
"I have never felt discouragement
here," said Dowley.
"I didn't feel cheated in taking a
long time to become a full professor,"
she added. "My chief interest is child
psychology; I don't do a lot of writing,
but spend most of my time running
Bing Nursery School."
Eleanor Maccoby also expressed
satisfaction with the way the University
has treated her:
"I've never encountered any
problem. The psychology department
has always been most cooperative."
Maccoby was appointed an associate
professor, although she only worked
half time.
"I had a unique situation, I think.
The University understood that I
wanted to spend time with my two
small children, and so allowed me to
work half time," she said.
Slow Progress
As a result, Maccoby admits she
progressed a little slower than her male
colleagues, in terms of promotion, but
she expresses no dissatisfaction. "It's a
choice you make. However, I've never
felt oppressed," she added.
Assistant Professor of English Anne
Mellor expressed similar views on her
treatment in the English department.
"There are a few of the old guard
left who dislike women," Mellor said.
"But they are becoming fewer and
fewer. The younger faculty members
are expressing a desire to see more
women on the faculty. If anything, I've
been discriminated for, not against!"
Under-evaluation by colleagues is
another issue raised in Miner's study.
However, none of the women expressed
any feelings of being down-graded by
their colleagues.
"I have found my male colleagues
easy to work with," said Maccoby.
"I've encountered no resentment
because I am a woman."
What about discrimination in
promotion? There are departmental
criteria (experience, publications, and
teaching ability), but Miner's report

indicates that women are discriminated
against on the basis of sex.
"I haven't heard of a woman being
discriminated against solely on the basis
of sex," said Dowley.
"Promotion depends on both research
and teaching," said Maccoby, "I think
the psychology department has been
less prejudiced than most, though,
when it comes to appointments. They
are more concerned with
qualifications."
Suppose two equally qualified
people came up for an appointment at
the same time, a man and a woman;
who would get the appointment?
"It's not true that the psychology
department would choose the man
automatically. In fact, they are actively
recruiting women," Maccoby said.
Men Like Men
Dowley said that she felt the man
might be chosen simply because some
men prefer to work with men.
What about salary discrimination?
Six years ago Mellor was offered a
position at Stanford at the same time as
a man was. Both had received offers
from UCLA as well. Stanford offered
the man $800 a year more than they
offered Mellor, and justified this
difference by saying that he had a
family to support, and that the extra
money would influence where he
would go.
"I suppose they knew it wouldn't
with me; they knew I wanted to be at
Stanford," said Mellor.
Maccoby felt that the University
doesn't expect a woman to take outside
offers seriously if her husband is here as
well. "They know she won't pick up
and leave. There isn't as much
competitive bidding for women as there
is for men."
Another factor affecting salaries is
the "publish or perish" rule. It's
possible that women professors with
families have less time to devote to
research and publishing.
All three professors applauded
recent efforts of the University to
increase the number of women staff
members.



DISCRIMINATION?—Not according to these three professors, all of whom have made it academically. Left to right: Edith
Dowley, psychology ; Eleanor Maccoby, psychology; and Anne Mellor, English.

professor, although she only worked
half time.
"I had a unique situation, I think.
The University understood that I
wanted to spend time with my two
small children, and so allowed me to
work half time," she said.
Slow Progress
As a result, Maccoby admits she
progressed a little slower than her male
colleagues, in terms of promotion, but
she expresses no dissatisfaction. "It's a
choice you make. However, I've never
felt oppressed," she added.
Assistant Professor of English Anne
Mellor expressed similar views on her
treatment in the English department.
"There are a few of the old guard
left who dislike women," Mellor said.
"But they are becoming fewer and
fewer. The younger faculty members
are expressing a desire to see more
women on the faculty. If anything, I've
been discriminated for, not against!"
Under-evaluation by colleagues is
another issue raised in Miner's study.
However, none of the women expressed
any feelings of being down-graded by
their colleagues.
"I have found my male colleagues
easy to work with," said Maccoby.
"I've encountered no resentment
because I am a woman."
What about discrimination in
promotion? There are departmental
criteria (experience, publications, and
teaching ability), but Miner's report

indicates that women are discriminated
against on the basis of sex.
"I haven't heard of a woman being
discriminated against solely on the basis
of sex," said Dowley.
"Promotion depends on both research
and teaching," said Maccoby, "I think
the psychology department has been
less prejudiced than most, though,
when it comes to appointments. They
are more concerned with
qualifications."
Suppose two equally qualified
people came up for an appointment at
the same time, a man and a woman;
who would get the appointment?
"It's not true that the psychology
department would choose the man
automatically. In fact, they are actively
recruiting women," Maccoby said.
Men Like Men
Dowley said that she felt the man
might be chosen simply because some
men prefer to work with men.
What about salary discrimination?
Six years ago Mellor was offered a
position at Stanford at the same time as
a man was. Both had received offers
from UCLA as well. Stanford offered
the man $800 a year more than they
offered Mellor, and justified this
difference by saying that he had a
family to support, and that the extra
money would influence where he
would go.
"I suppose they knew it wouldn't
with me; they knew I wanted to be at
Stanford," said Mellor.
Maccoby felt that the University
doesn't expect a woman to take outside
offers seriously if her husband is here as
well. "They know she won't pick up
and leave. There isn't as much
competitive bidding for women as there
is for men."
Another factor affecting salaries is
the "publish or perish" rule. It's
possible that women professors with
families have less time to devote to
research and publishing.
All three professors applauded
recent efforts of the University to
increase the number of women staff
members.

Dowley, psychology ; Eleanor Maccoby, psychology; and Anne Mellor, English.

work at Stanford. . .feel that a strong
climate of discouragement for women

(Miner's Report to the
President on the Status
of Women in the University.)
There are at least three women
professors who disagree: Edith Dowley
(psychology and education), Eleanor

Maccoby (psychology) and Anne
Mellor (English).
"I have never felt discouragement
here," said Dowley.
"I didn't feel cheated in taking a
long time to become a full professor,"
she added. "My chief interest is child
psychology; I don't do a lot of writing,
but spend most of my time running
Bing Nursery School."
Eleanor Maccoby also expressed
satisfaction with the way the University
has treated her:
"I've never encountered any
problem. The psychology department
has always been most cooperative."
Maccoby was appointed an associate
professor, although she only worked
half time.
