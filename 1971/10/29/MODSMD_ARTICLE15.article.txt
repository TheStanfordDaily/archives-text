Sweet plastic-dolly Joy
grew up like every girl.
The thought of women's
liberation
caused her hair to curl.
Raised in frills and flounces
SHE was not a tomboy!
She learned to play the dumb one,
to be feminine and coy.
Why would any girl, she asked
want to open a door?
I like to have things done for me;
Liberation would be a bore.
She wanted nothing other than
a husband of her own.
And so she went to college,
though studies made her groan.
She found herself the ideal man,
and there she staked her claim.
But alas she was unhappy,
found wedded life too tame.
For then she ceased to be herself;
existing only for him.
All she did was clean and cook.
Her future looked pretty grim.
Many diapers and gray hairs later,
she found she had nothing to do.
The housewife bit was boring;
she needed something new.
So she went out to seek a job.
But alas, no market for her skills.
For all she'd learned was to be
coy,
and flaunt her "feminine" frills.
Many will, as she has done,
look back on life and sign.
And wonder what it's al! been for,
that they've believed and lived a
lis. -Ann Rendall
