# What Is The WRA?
## 
### BETH GARFIELD 
Have you ever wandered into the
Women's Gym and seen signs that read
"Women's Recreation Association" or
"WRA"?
The average Stanford student has
little idea of what this organization
does, or how to get involved in it. WRA
is the women's program for sports and
dance recreation and intra-murals. All
women students automatically belong
and elect the officers.
"The WRA doesn't reach nearly
enough women," according to Karen
Cartwright, President of the
organization.
"This is due to a lack of knowledge
and also because there aren't enough
women students who are willing to get
involved in organized activities," she
added.

The WRA operates separately from
the Women's Physical Education
Department. Women's Phys Ed is in
charge of classes for women. WRA,
however, is primarily concerned with
recreation.
If you would like to get involved,
come to a WRA board meeting
Mondays at noon in the Women's gym
or leave a message at the Women's
Gym. If you would just like to
participate in our activities, watch this
column and Once Around the Quad
announcements.
