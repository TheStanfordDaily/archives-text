# Club Sponsors Auction/Sale
## 
### 
A sale/auction of all items
cleaned from residence hall
storerooms, some of it dating
back to 1955, tomorrow from
noon till dark on the lawn

between Wilbur and Stern.
Proceeds from the sale will go
to the Conservation Club's
recycling program and will finance
plastic trash containers for metal

cans and glass bottles. The Club
hopes to bolster its recycling
efforts by providing the
containers to every dorm, and if
finances permit, to Row Houses
and fraternities.
The Conservation Club, one of
the largest on campus, was
hampered by the zero-dollars vote
last year. The University has
donated all the items to help the
club with its ecology program.
All items will be on display at
noon with the auction of all items
over five dollars to begin around 2
p.m. The auctioneers will be Jim
Baer and The Tim White, of Daily
classified-ads fame.
