# Advisory Board Gives Franklin More Time To Present Defense
## 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
The Advisory Board yesterday gave suspended English
professor H. Bruce Franklin "limited time" beyond
Saturday to conclude his defense. Board Chairman Donald
Kennedy had originally announced Saturday as a "target
'~r Franklin to complete his case which is now in its
third week.
In granting the extension at the beginning of yesterday's
hearing, Kennedy said that after examining confidential
plans submitted by Franklin outlining the rest of his
defense, the Board had agreed that the program "included
enough planned testimony on relevant matters to extend
his case beyond Saturday."
Kennedy also gave Franklin some additional guidelines
concerning evidence the Board wanted to hear.
Reduced Length
He said the Board felt this "should reduce the length of
Professor Franklin's case materially."
Kennedy said that the board:
A) was willing to accept that "many people in the
Stanford community belipve that Henry Cabot Lodge is a
'war criminal'," and that "further evidence on this point
need not be heard."
B) did not wish further personal histories of why people
had gone to the Computation Center.
C) did not wish further testimony on events after the
police charge at the Comp Center.
D) did not need rebuttal of Administration testimony
that certain acts of violence occurred after Franklin's
speech in the Old Union courtyard on the evening of
February 10th.
Not Relevant
On this point Kennedy said the Board did not feel such
testimony relevant to the charge that Franklin increased

the risk of violence on campus with his evening speech.
The increased risk of violence could be adequately
shown or disproved by "pre-existing and co-existing
conditions" and not subsequent events, Kennedy said.
Kennedy concluded that the Board did not wish any
testimony supporting Professor Franklin's exceptional
competence as a scholar and as a teacher because "his
competence is not in question at this hearing."
Six witnesses testified at yesterday's hearing.
Mostly Corroboration
Most corroborated earlier testimony that the crowd
outside the Comp Center had been peaceful before the
police charge and that Professor Franklin had very little to
do with failure of people in the area to disperse after a
police order to do so.
Franklin has been charged with inciting people to
disobey the dispersal order.
Howard Harrison, a professional photographer, said that
the crowd outside the computer center was "very tranquil"
before the police charge.
He added that he didn't see the crowd dispersing "at any
time while the police were giving the crowd the order to
disperse."
Administration Contention
It is an Administration contention that people had been
dispersing peacefully when Franklin turned the crowd back
on police.
Professor Paul Switzer, an associate professor of
statistics and geology and a faculty observer on the 10th,
testified that Franklin had "absolutely no effect
whatsoever on people's decision to stay after the police
order to disperse."
Switzer added that the police charge had caught even
the faculty observers "off guard" and"it was quite funny
to see a lot of my colleagues in flight."
Brent Apple, a reporter from KZSU,said that the police
charge had occurred after one officer had spoken to
another officer and three or four policemen had then
attempted to arrest Franklin.
Bob Litterman, a reporter from the Stanford Daily at
the time, said someone had yelled "get him" or "get them"
when the police grabbed Franklin and subsequently
charged.
Litterman added that after the police charge he had run
across a parking lot into some bushes.
The final witness of the day, Fred Lonsdale, a former
student said that a meeting at the Comp Center on the 10th
had voted to stay at the Center until the Gamut-H
amphibious assault program at the Center had been ended
or leave peaceably if the police came.
The day's most dramatic moment came during a recess
when six members of the Women's Union, a local radical
peace group, put on a play parodying the hearings.
But the play's climax came unexpectedly. A dog seated
in the audience attacked a member of the cast playing the
administration.
Although the dog moved quickly, members of the
audience pointed out that at least judging by its target, it
wasn't a running dog of U.S. Imperialism.
