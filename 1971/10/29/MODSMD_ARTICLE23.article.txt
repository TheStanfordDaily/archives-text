# Airborne 747
## Verdian Soprano Lifts Opera 
### GARY SCHMIDGALL 
The San Francisco Opera's heavyweight
production of "Un Ballo in Maschera," like a big
747, lumbered ominously down the runway for a
whole act, but happily became airborne when a
glorious Verdian soprano made her appearance.
Still, though all the principal voices were big enough
to make this middle-period Verdi opera the
ebullient vocal brouhaha it should be, the
performance was no unqualified success.
One portrayal bears no niggling: Martina
Arroyo's Amelia. She alone made a successful
attempt to act with her voice and, not miraculously,
the drama in her stage presence followed naturally.
As well, Arroyo has the perfect instrument for
Verdi—a sheath of pure velvet never (i.e. not once)
fell away from the cutting edge of her voice, and it
had all the thrust and underlying brainwork to make
the most of Verdi's intricate phrasing and extended
melodic lines. Arroyo cannot be surpassed in this
bailiwick.
For the other singers, the first scene was a grim
demonstration of on-stage vocalizing, all chilliness
and tightness. Not until Irene Dalis, as the witch
Ulrica, began to show that the point with Verdi is
fully unleashed resources, did the opera gain
momentum. In her only but arduous scene, Dalis
gave a gutsy display of contralto singing, which is a
genre of vocalism I find thrilling. Her voice has a
gaunt, hollow quality (the direction in which
contraltos usually err), but this seemed appropriate
for a witch after all.

Luciano Pavarotti is a fine tenor, as we know
from experience and many recordings. As that
fatefully blithe spirit, Riccardo the Governor of
Boston, he should have been more exciting than he
was. Too often, a sense of constriction dampened
the moments of vocal excitement in his role.
Unwisely, he opened up just enough to make us
realize what was being held back.
He did, however, rise to Arroyo's demands to
make Act II a shattering vocal power-play.
Pavarotti's acting is understandably hindered by his
hill-of-flesh stature. James McCracken remains the
only big tenor who has learned how to overcome
this obstacle to dramatic success.
The evening's Renato (husband to the Governor's
lover, Amelia) was a last-minute replacement for
ailing Ingvar Wixell, who stole the 1969 "Forza del
Destino" from—believe it or not—Carlo Bergonzi.
Even before Franco Bordoni's performance my
disappointment was great. Now it is greater:
Bordoni's role was chiseled in the finest Italian
marble.
His baritone is technically faultless—rich,
expansive, agile—but where, pray, was the lavish
emotion and humanity we expect with Verdi?
Bordoni's performance was all line and no color;
and his idea of acting was in the Italian tradition at
its most aggressively simple-minded. You
know. . .hand-to-heart and the incessant
"squeezing" of dramatic phrases with clenched fists.
Perhaps I am being overly nasty, but this is a form
of opera-pollution that must be stamped out

ruthlessly. Fortunately, it is a fault rarely met in
such a terminal stage as this in San Francisco.
Helen Donath, probably miscast in the pants-role
of Oscar, lived up as best she could to the vibrant
and flighty arias she had to sing. Allan Monk was
excellent as the lucky sailor, Silvano.
Stage director Piero Faggioni's American debut is
worth commenting upon, if only to say that he
conceded every one of Verdi's stand-up-sing-out
moments to the singers, letting them do just that.
Though the unveiling of Amelia to her aghast
husband was not done according to the score, the
conspirators' scene had some nice moments.
Faggioni's major coup was his handling of the
masked ball scene, involving clever deployment of a
commedia dell-arte group. Marvelous to report, he
made the last scene work dramatically.
This "Ballo" is done in the Boston version forced
upon Verdi by the Italian censors, who thought an
opera where a King is assassinated was entirely too
suggestive. This results in some amusing minutiae,
but on the whole the production comes off visually.
The costumes are unexceptionable, as are the sets
(except for a backdrop in Act II that looks like a
wind-tunnel).
Charles Mackerras continues to show versatility
in the pit, adding Verdi to his areas of capability.
The pace did, however, lapse now and then, notably
in Renato's Eri tu aria.
"Ballo" will be repealed on October 30,
November 2, 5, and 7.
