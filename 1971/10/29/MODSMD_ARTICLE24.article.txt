# 'Rainbow Bridge'
## Exploitation Of Hendrix 
### PAUL GRUSHKIN 
What! You haven't seen Jimi
Hendrix in "Rainbow Bridge"
yet? And you don't have the
'Original Motion Picture Sound
Track' either?? And you still
haven't been down to Kepler's to
buy your official full-color
near-to-lifesize poster of Jimi at
Maui???
Congratulations.
Suffice it to say that "Rainbow
Bridge" is one of the most
excruciatingly painful films to
watch. Somehow I must believe
that Jimi had absolutely no idea
of how he was to be exploited,
but perhaps my friend A 1 put the
matter more succinctly: "I just
hope Jimi didn't die for Rainbow
Bridge."
There will never be another
rock artist so uniquely Jimi
Hendrix. An obvious point. But
that's why I'm so depressed by
the current exploitation of both
his music and the Hendrix
Presence. You see, now that Jimi's
no longer in control of his
product, all sorts of "hip" people
are ripping off every available bit
of memorabilia and peddling it to
a hungry markey.
Exactly the scheme of
"Rainbow Bridge's" director
Chuck Wein—-who stands to make
millions off the genius of a dead
man.
Meditation Center
Hendrix, for reasons known
only to himself and friends,
played a curious sort of
engagement at a weird meditation
center at Hawaii's island Maui a
few months before his death in
September of last year. Wein, who
apparently was previously
fascinated by this lily-white, very
affluent group of beautiful people
doing their individual boogie (85
percent of the film is devoted to
their great revelations about man's
state of being, solutions to social
ills, and communication with "our
brothers in outer space"), utilized
the Hendrix appearance as the
movie's drawing card.
And so the film is billed
"Rainbow Bridge, a movie by
Chuck Wein, featuring JIMI
HENDRIX'" The magical name is
enough to get any self-respecting
kid into the theatre—and Mem
Aud was packed for the two
KZSU-benefit showings a few
weeks ago. The movie is due to be
released shortly in the Bay Area,
just watch what happens.
Without Hendrix, "Rainbow
Bridge" would be laughable, if it
wasn't so incredibly pretentious
and so very boring. But the
Hendrix presentation itself is
sub-par and horribly edited on
film.

Note, however, that the actual
concert at this meditation center
is NOT featured on the
ballyhooed 'Original Motion
Picture Sound Track' (Reprise
MS-2040), available at the slightly
rip-off price of $3.69 at Discount
Records.
This 'soundtrack' is a
compilation of Hendrix tapes
recorded in studios around the
country between late 1968 and
early 1970. This is not to say it's
poor music, but it is terribly
misleading—especially as the
album cover pictures are all from
the Maui concert.
Several of the cuts are vintage
Hendrix. There's a fantastic
version of "Hear My Train A'
comin'," recorded live at the
Berkeley Community Theatre,
and the long-awaited "Dolly
Dagger" with distinctive Hendrix
vocals.
These tapes are aired
intermittently between the almost
indecipherable dialog of leading
lady Pat Hartley and a cast of
groovy morons, without any
especial effort to coordinate the
music with the action on film.
The actual concert is available
on a hard-to-locate bootleg
entitled "Jimi Hendrix, Maui,
Hawaii, 7/30/70" on the "Pig"
label.
Your first clue comes when the
sound of Hendrix' fabled "Star
Spangled Banner" doesn't quite
match up with the version Jimi's
playing at Maui. (You won't know
this, but the sound you're seeing
played was recorded at the N.Y.
Record Plant on March 18, 1969).
But Wein cleverly covers that up

by concentrating on Hendrix' face
and eliminating virtually all shots
of his guitar-playing.
Not The True Sound
What you'll see, in effect, is a
badly photographed Hendrix
concert minus the true sound. I
can't guess why on earth this was
done, unless Weill simply blew the
recording. But you'll notice that
something isn't quite matching
up.
Then there's the matter of the
crowd shots. In the space of
seconds you're shown first an
excited, frenetic Hendrix
audience, then a shot of
apparently the same crowd
quietly looking at each other.
Extremely disconcerting, for
there's no continuous concert,
merely a collection of film splices.
And so the official
'soundtrack' really isn't the Maui
concert (what allegedly the movie
includes), and the inclusion of
Hendrix in Weill's meaningless
glorification comes off as a stunt
to draw the audiences. I wish we
weren't left with "Rainbow
Bridge" as a memorial to Jimi
Hendrix.
At least we'll always have
"Monterey Pop" and
"Woodstock" to properly cherish.
See, I was working in a small
upstate New York town when the
former came to the Saranac Lake
theatre, and I took a day off and
went to see it, and midway
through it appeared this incredible
madman on stage who wrung
more electricity out of his guitar
and would you believe started to
screw it on stage and then set fire
to it and. . .

comin'," recorded live at the
Berkeley Community Theatre,
and the long-awaited "Dolly
Dagger" with distinctive Hendrix
vocals.
These tapes are aired
intermittently between the almost
indecipherable dialog of leading
lady Pat Hartley and a cast of
groovy morons, without any
especial effort to coordinate the
music with the action on film.
The actual concert is available
on a hard-to-locate bootleg
entitled "Jimi Hendrix, Maui,
Hawaii, 7/30/70" on the "Pig"
label.
Your first clue comes when the
sound of Hendrix' fabled "Star
Spangled Banner" doesn't quite
match up with the version Jimi's
playing at Maui. (You won't know
this, but the sound you're seeing
played was recorded at the N.Y.
Record Plant on March 18, 1969).
But Wein cleverly covers that up

by concentrating on Hendrix' face
and eliminating virtually all shots
of his guitar-playing.
Not The True Sound
What you'll see, in effect, is a
badly photographed Hendrix
concert minus the true sound. I
can't guess why on earth this was
done, unless Weill simply blew the
recording. But you'll notice that
something isn't quite matching
up.
Then there's the matter of the
crowd shots. In the space of
seconds you're shown first an
excited, frenetic Hendrix
audience, then a shot of
apparently the same crowd
quietly looking at each other.
Extremely disconcerting, for
there's no continuous concert,
merely a collection of film splices.
And so the official
'soundtrack' really isn't the Maui
concert (what allegedly the movie
includes), and the inclusion of
Hendrix in Weill's meaningless
glorification comes off as a stunt
to draw the audiences. I wish we
weren't left with "Rainbow
Bridge" as a memorial to Jimi
Hendrix.
At least we'll always have
"Monterey Pop" and
"Woodstock" to properly cherish.
See, I was working in a small
upstate New York town when the
former came to the Saranac Lake
theatre, and I took a day off and
went to see it, and midway
through it appeared this incredible
madman on stage who wrung
more electricity out of his guitar
and would you believe started to
screw it on stage and then set fire
to it and. . .

AT THE MUSEUM—The three works of art seen on this page and page
six are currently on display at the Stanford Museum. A critique of all
on-campus art exhibits will be run in next week's Daily.
What! You haven't seen Jimi
Hendrix in "Rainbow Bridge"
yet? And you don't have the
'Original Motion Picture Sound
Track' either?? And you still
haven't been down to Kepler's to
buy your official full-color
near-to-lifesize poster of Jimi at
Maui???
Congratulations.
Suffice it to say that "Rainbow
Bridge" is one of the most
excruciatingly painful films to
watch. Somehow I must believe
that Jimi had absolutely no idea
of how he was to be exploited,
but perhaps my friend A 1 put the
matter more succinctly: "I just
hope Jimi didn't die for Rainbow
Bridge."
There will never be another
rock artist so uniquely Jimi
Hendrix. An obvious point. But
that's why I'm so depressed by
the current exploitation of both
his music and the Hendrix
Presence. You see, now that Jimi's
no longer in control of his
product, all sorts of "hip" people
are ripping off every available bit
of memorabilia and peddling it to
a hungry markey.
Exactly the scheme of
"Rainbow Bridge's" director
Chuck Wein—-who stands to make
millions off the genius of a dead
man.
Meditation Center
Hendrix, for reasons known
only to himself and friends,
played a curious sort of
engagement at a weird meditation
center at Hawaii's island Maui a
few months before his death in
September of last year. Wein, who
apparently was previously
fascinated by this lily-white, very
affluent group of beautiful people
doing their individual boogie (85
percent of the film is devoted to
their great revelations about man's
state of being, solutions to social
ills, and communication with "our
brothers in outer space"), utilized
the Hendrix appearance as the
movie's drawing card.
And so the film is billed
"Rainbow Bridge, a movie by
Chuck Wein, featuring JIMI
HENDRIX'" The magical name is
enough to get any self-respecting
kid into the theatre—and Mem
Aud was packed for the two
KZSU-benefit showings a few
weeks ago. The movie is due to be
released shortly in the Bay Area,
just watch what happens.
Without Hendrix, "Rainbow
Bridge" would be laughable, if it
wasn't so incredibly pretentious
and so very boring. But the
Hendrix presentation itself is
sub-par and horribly edited on
film.

Note, however, that the actual
concert at this meditation center
is NOT featured on the
ballyhooed 'Original Motion
Picture Sound Track' (Reprise
MS-2040), available at the slightly
rip-off price of $3.69 at Discount
Records.
This 'soundtrack' is a
compilation of Hendrix tapes
recorded in studios around the
country between late 1968 and
early 1970. This is not to say it's
poor music, but it is terribly
misleading—especially as the
album cover pictures are all from
the Maui concert.
Several of the cuts are vintage
Hendrix. There's a fantastic
version of "Hear My Train A'
comin'," recorded live at the
Berkeley Community Theatre,
and the long-awaited "Dolly
Dagger" with distinctive Hendrix
vocals.

watch. Somehow I must believe
that Jimi had absolutely no idea
of how he was to be exploited,
but perhaps my friend A 1 put the
matter more succinctly: "I just
hope Jimi didn't die for Rainbow
Bridge."
There will never be another
rock artist so uniquely Jimi
Hendrix. An obvious point. But
that's why I'm so depressed by
the current exploitation of both
his music and the Hendrix
Presence. You see, now that Jimi's
no longer in control of his
product, all sorts of "hip" people
are ripping off every available bit
of memorabilia and peddling it to
a hungry markey.
Exactly the scheme of
"Rainbow Bridge's" director
Chuck Wein—-who stands to make
millions off the genius of a dead
man.
Meditation Center
Hendrix, for reasons known
only to himself and friends,
played a curious sort of
engagement at a weird meditation
center at Hawaii's island Maui a
few months before his death in
September of last year. Wein, who
apparently was previously
fascinated by this lily-white, very
affluent group of beautiful people
doing their individual boogie (85
percent of the film is devoted to
their great revelations about man's
state of being, solutions to social
ills, and communication with "our
brothers in outer space"), utilized
the Hendrix appearance as the
movie's drawing card.
And so the film is billed
"Rainbow Bridge, a movie by
Chuck Wein, featuring JIMI
HENDRIX'" The magical name is
enough to get any self-respecting
kid into the theatre—and Mem
Aud was packed for the two
KZSU-benefit showings a few
weeks ago. The movie is due to be
released shortly in the Bay Area,
just watch what happens.
Without Hendrix, "Rainbow
Bridge" would be laughable, if it
wasn't so incredibly pretentious
and so very boring. But the
Hendrix presentation itself is
sub-par and horribly edited on
film.

Note, however, that the actual
concert at this meditation center
is NOT featured on the
ballyhooed 'Original Motion
Picture Sound Track' (Reprise
MS-2040), available at the slightly
rip-off price of $3.69 at Discount
Records.
This 'soundtrack' is a
compilation of Hendrix tapes
recorded in studios around the
country between late 1968 and
early 1970. This is not to say it's
poor music, but it is terribly
misleading—especially as the
album cover pictures are all from
the Maui concert.
Several of the cuts are vintage
Hendrix. There's a fantastic
version of "Hear My Train A'
comin'," recorded live at the
Berkeley Community Theatre,
and the long-awaited "Dolly
Dagger" with distinctive Hendrix
vocals.
These tapes are aired
intermittently between the almost
indecipherable dialog of leading
lady Pat Hartley and a cast of
groovy morons, without any
especial effort to coordinate the
music with the action on film.
The actual concert is available
on a hard-to-locate bootleg
entitled "Jimi Hendrix, Maui,
Hawaii, 7/30/70" on the "Pig"
label.
Your first clue comes when the
sound of Hendrix' fabled "Star
Spangled Banner" doesn't quite
match up with the version Jimi's
playing at Maui. (You won't know
this, but the sound you're seeing
played was recorded at the N.Y.
Record Plant on March 18, 1969).
But Wein cleverly covers that up

by concentrating on Hendrix' face
and eliminating virtually all shots
of his guitar-playing.
Not The True Sound
What you'll see, in effect, is a
badly photographed Hendrix
concert minus the true sound. I
can't guess why on earth this was
done, unless Weill simply blew the
recording. But you'll notice that
something isn't quite matching
up.
Then there's the matter of the
crowd shots. In the space of
seconds you're shown first an
excited, frenetic Hendrix
audience, then a shot of
apparently the same crowd
quietly looking at each other.
Extremely disconcerting, for
there's no continuous concert,
merely a collection of film splices.
And so the official
'soundtrack' really isn't the Maui
concert (what allegedly the movie
includes), and the inclusion of
Hendrix in Weill's meaningless
glorification comes off as a stunt
to draw the audiences. I wish we
weren't left with "Rainbow
Bridge" as a memorial to Jimi
Hendrix.
At least we'll always have
"Monterey Pop" and
"Woodstock" to properly cherish.
See, I was working in a small
upstate New York town when the
former came to the Saranac Lake
theatre, and I took a day off and
went to see it, and midway
through it appeared this incredible
madman on stage who wrung
more electricity out of his guitar
and would you believe started to
screw it on stage and then set fire
to it and. . .

What! You haven't seen Jimi

haven't been down to Kepler's to
buy your official full-color

Maui???
Congratulations.
