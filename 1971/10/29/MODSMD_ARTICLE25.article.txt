# Donovan Returns; Mellow As Ever
## 
### KIMBERLY OSBORN PAUL GRUSHKIN 
An old friend of yours and
mine, one Donovan Phillips
Leitch, returned to America for a
short visit this fall and stopped in
at San Francisco's Civic
Auditorium last weekend. It was
nice to have him back.
Of course you remember
Donovan. He's that soft-voiced,
but eventually absolutely unique,
Scottish fellow who first popped
up on the charts with
the gentle Dylan-imitation "Catch
The Wind," and returned the next
year, in 1965, at the peak of the
banana-high craze, with his
Continental success "Mellow
Yellow" (Electrical Banana) on
CoJumbia's Epic label.
•Then, the following year, the
English superstar (for by this time
he was all that in the British Isles)
soared with "Sunshine Superman"
(No. 55 on New York's WOR-FM
all-time Top-300) and millions of
American teenagers scarfed in his
stream of hit singles and albums.
And there were a lot of them:
"Hurdy Gurdy Man, " "Jennifer
Juniper," "There is a Mountain,"
"To Susan On The West Coast
Waiting," and of course the
bizarre "Atlantis," on which he
was backed by the Jeff Beck
Group and Rod Stewart.
Somehow he sang every song
differently from the rest of the
pop music artists—utilizing
sincerely warm, mellow (but
veddy British) vocals with just a
slightly indecipherable delivery of
the lyrics. Remember asking a
friend after hearing "Mellow
Yellow," "what is he saying??"
At first Donovan (or the
Donovan image) had an ethereal,
story-book quality, and "Catch
the Wind" was emblematic of the
folk-song mold many of his
earliest songs frew from. Then,
coming into his peak as he became
progressively more and more
esoteric, it took on a decided jazz
flavor.
While Donovan did embark on
several American tours (and of
course appeared on the Ed
Sullivan Show) he was not
received quite as enthusiastically
here as he was in Britain or on the
Continent.
His latest tour, considerably
more low-key, has been fairly
successful and if his San Francisco
appearance is any indication many
of the fans so devoted to him in

the late 60's appeared, once again,
in force.
Somewhere in 1969 the hits
stopped coming to America and
Donovan Leitch dropped out of
sight, probably to spend time with
his new wife and fmaily. But in
early 1970 he returned with a sort
of funky electric sound, formed a
trio called Open Road (recalling
his early travels around the British
Isles with his friend Gypsy Dave)
and released an only partly
successful album of the same
name.
At the Civic Auditorium
concert Donovan performed many
of the old favorites—including
"Season of the Witch," "Sunshine
Superman," and of course
"Mellow Yellow." He sang one
song about (and for) Gypsy Dave,
and a number of Scottish ballads.
It would appear that the great
age of AM-Donovan is over;
however, like other great artists of
the late 1960'5, Donovan is
moving in new directions, into
films and composing scores. We'll
keep hearing from him, though.
