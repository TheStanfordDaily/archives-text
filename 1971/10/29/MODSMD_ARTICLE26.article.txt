# Stanford Hockey Club Looks For Improvement
## 
### CHRIS COUNIHAN 
Despite the loss of several key
members from last year's squad,
this year's hockey team has a
good chance to improve on last
year's performance.
Returning from last year's
team which was easily the best in
the club's history are coach Fat
Baldwin, grad students John
Mackall and Russ MacAusland,
sophomores Tom Bedford, Rick

Bragdon, Will Mcllvaine, Chris
Counihan, Rich Jaros, Redball
Burke, Gervin Peters, and juniors
Ralph Brown, and Eddie Leonard.
Doug Adams and Paul Tittman
will both return in Winter quarter.
Defense A Problem
At the beginning of the season
the defense which had been
inconsistent last year was the
biggest problem. In the first two
games, player-coach Pat Baldwin

played defente to try and help
out. FortunatUy, Baldwin will be
able to move back to forward in
the next game as one newcomer
and a former forward have
relieved the situation.
Dennis Coleman, a grad
student, and Redball Burke, who
only saw action last year at
forward have joined regulars
Ralph Brown and Chris Counihan
on defense. After some practice

together the defense could be
tough. Also, goalie Rick Bragdon
has played exceptionally well in
his first two outings. This is a
great improvement over last year.
So far the defense has yielded
only 4 goals in two games.
With Baldwin moving to the
forward position all three lines
should be strong. First-year grad
students Tom Perrot and Mike
Hough and transfer Roger Macy
should bolster the forward lines.
Perrot's line scored both goals in

the loss to Belmont. Flip Giannos
who did not play much last year
also should see some action as he
has become a fine playmaker.
Talented
Although the Indian squad has
a lot of talent and ability they
must improve on their teamwork
and positional play in both ends
of the rink if they are going to
have a good record. Many of last
year's losses came as a result of
faulty positioning in the defensive
zone,

Coach Baldwin is stressing
more organization and teamwork
especially in the defensive zone
and the results are already paying
off.
The Bay Area Senior League is
comprised of six teams: Stanford,
Cal., San Francisco, Belmont,
Berkeley Juniors, and newcomer
University of San Francisco. The
Cards' toughest competition will
come from Belmont and Berkeley,
last year's league champs. The
latter two teams and Stanford
have the best skaters of the
league. San Francisco is not far
behind, though they lack the
depth of the top three teams. Cal
was weak last year and USF
should be not much stronger.
Team To Travel
The team will make several
trips to play teams outside the
Bay Area Senior League. The
Cards will play the Air Force
Acaoemy three times, once in
Fresno and twice at Colorado

Springs. Also scheduled is a game
against the Las Vegal Gamblers
and a game against Colorado
University. Depending on money
and scheduling the team may
make several other trips.
The scheduled trips outside of
the league are the product of long
hours of letter-writing and
telephoning by coach Baldwin and
president Jaros.
The club practices every
Sunday night. Besides the team
players the club members, i.e.
players who do not play in the
games also practice. Anyone
associated with Stanford can play
on the club team.
Campus support for club
hockey has been growing over the
years. Over 1500 people attended
the team's first game at Belmont
two weeks ago. The club's next
game will be with Cal at Legg's
Arena in San Francisco Monday
night.
