# Frosh Gridders Seek First Win Against SFS
## 
### MIKE HERMAN 
Attempting to balance their
season record, the Stanford frosh
football team takes on San
Francisco State in the Indians'
home opener to be played at 2
p.m. at the Stadium.
In what promises to be an
exciting as well as successful
afternoon of football, spectators
coming to the game will, for the
first time, be able to watch a
defensive unit that, though
plagued by injuries sufferen in last
week's game with USC, is
considered to be one of the best
assembled in the West. In last
week's debacle with the Trojans
of Southern California, several
key Indian players suffered
injuries that incapacitated them
for that game and, in some cases,
the lingering effects will force
those players to miss action in
today's game. Against Troy, both
Stanford quarterbacks, Duf
Sundheim and Bob Glick were
shaken up. Sundheim suffered a
slight knee injury, while Glick was
knocked senseless, but both are
expected to see action today.
Defense Racked By Injuries
The defense was not as
fortunate, with two of its biggest
names, Forrie Martin and Scott
Laildlaw, unable to suit up.
Martin, middle linebacker-fullback
who was an ail-American in his
high school days at Blair, suffered

three broken ribs early in last
week's game, while Laidlaw, the
well-regarded defensive back,
injured his knee severely enough
to prevent him from playing this
afternoon.
Both spots in the lineup will,
however, be filled quite
adequately. Chuck Merja,whohas
impressed the coaches all week,
will start at linebacker, while
defensive back Mike Cook will fill
in for Martin at fullback.
The Stanford Frosh will enter
the game as a fairly heavy
favorite, despite last week's
one-sided encounter and the
injuries inflicted. San Francisco
State comes into the game
without a win in five games. There
is little known about their actual
game plan, because their practices
have been closed to the public,
but it is believed that the strength
of their attack is in their running
game. Nonetheless, they are said
to be less than spectacular in
almost every facet of the game.
"We were really pleased with
the spirit shown by the team last
week," Coach Bill Moultrie
declared this week. "The attitude
around here has been great all
week." When asked what he
expected the game with S.F. State
to be like, he replied without a
moment's hesitation, "We expect
to win."
