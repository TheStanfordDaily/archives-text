# Indians Must Win Tomorrow
## 
### CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
Every time John Ralston's
teams of the past two years had to
win a game or drop out of the
Rose Bowl battle, they came
through magnificently. The
Indians' game tomorrow with the
Oregon State Beavers is another
contest that they have to win in
order to have a chance at the
Pac-8 championship and it is
hoped that they can maintain
their record of the past two
seasons in winning the clutch
games,
Stanford is favored to beat the
Beavers by seven points but this
means nothing since the
oddsmakers have not even come
close to successfully predicting
the outcomes of the Indians' first
seven games this season. In fact,
their predictions have become
more of a jinx than anything else,
since they proclaimed that
Stanford would beat both Duke
and Washington State by 24
points or more, and the outcomes
reflected anything but that.
The Indians will face an
Oregon State team tomorrow at
1:30 p.m. in Corvallis that is

prepared to make radical changes
in order to upset them. Coach Dee
Andros might not start his star
quarterback, Steve Endicott, in
favor of second stringer Jim
Kilmartin. Andros is considering
starting Kil martin because he is
better at running the option than
Endicott who is primarily
renowned for his passing prowess.
Fullback Dave Shilling is the
Beavers' most accomplished
runner, and he is currently third
in the Pac-8 in rushing with a 93.4
average per game. Shilling may
not run the ball much against
Stanford because another Oregon
State back. Bill Carlquist, is
quicker and can run the option
better.
Imitate Option
Washington State's devastating
execution of the triple option was
responsible for their upset win,
and Andros is prepared to use this
same tactic to try and pile up
points against the Thunder
Chickens. Endicott might start,
and he most certainly will see
action, but Kil martin and
Carlquist are ready to run their
version of the option at the

Stanford defense.
There are eight >n
Beavers' offensive starting lineup,
and the team as a whole is very
experienced. Only two
sophomores have worked their
way into the ranks of the Beaver
starters. Most of the Beavers were
humiliated last year at Stanford
Stadium, 48-10. They must win
this game to have a chance at a
trip to the Rose Bowl, and the
Beavers will be intent on upsetting
the Indians.
Ralston has been preparing the
team all week to be better
equipped to handle the option
that killed them last week. The
Indians have also been working on
pass defense in the hopes of
cutting off Endicott's passing to
his brilliant receiver, Jeff Kolberg.
Injuries
Tim Robnett and John
Winesberry have recovered from
their minor injuries incurred in
the Cougar game. James Ferguson
will alternate with Robnett, and
Don Alvarado will give Winesberry
periodic rests. Jeff Siemon might
not start but will probably see
action. Phil Satre will take over at

Siemon's middle linebacking
position when Siemon Ls on the
sidelines.
Stanford has won all the big
ones over the past two years, but
Oregon State is willing to bench
the Pac-B's fourth best passer in
Endicott to run the option type
of offense that beat the Indians
last week. The confrontation in
Corvallis tomorrow will be both
crucial and classic, and all who are
interested can see the results of
this week's hectic preparations at
Maples beginning at 1:30 p.m.

WILL HE OR WON'T HE?â€”All eyes are on sophomore John Winesberry as he dives for a catch against the
Cougars in the Indians' 24-23 loss last weekend. Winesberry made the catch, but his best effort of the
game came on his part of a 9 7-yard kickoff return, taking a hand-off from Miles Moore and romping 88
yards up the Stanford sideline to score. Winesberry might be slowed against Oregon State because of slight
leg injuries, but he definitely will play. His injury situation is comparable to Tim Robnett and Jeff
Siemon's, who will both see limited action.
