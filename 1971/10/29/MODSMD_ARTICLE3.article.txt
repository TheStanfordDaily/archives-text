# Recruitment Policy Attacked
## Peace Coalition To Picket Placement Center 
### DAVID THIEMANN 
A coalition of political action groups
agreed last night to picket the
Placement Center, beginning at 9 a.m.
Monday morning, in an attempt to
dissuade military and defense industry
recruiters from operating on campus.
After considering the possibility of
more aggressive demonstrations,
including a disruptive sit-in, the
meeting dec : ded to picket and mobilize
support on Monday, but left other
options open for use during the
remainder of the week.
In addition to the picketing
activities the group scheduled a rally in
front of the center at 12:30 p.m.
Monday, a sign-making party at
Columbae House Sunday night, and a

community meeting Monday night to
decide upon tactics to use in further
action.
In an attempt to provide
non-military employment
opportunities, the American Friends
Service Committee "Vocations for
Social Change" program from Berkeley
will set up alternative counseling next
to the Placement Center during the
picketing.
Eight large defense contractors are
scheduled to interview students at the
center during the coming week, along
with representatives of the U.S. Navy
and Air Force.
These activities violate two student
referendum proposals passed during
elections last spring, according to the

ASSU Council of Presidents.
A student referendum, passed last
spring, voted to "prohibit the use of
Stanford lands for military service
recruiting" passing by 451 votes, 194 7
to 1496.
Another resolution to "prohibit the
use of Stanford lands by corporations
that are directly producing material and
research for the military" passed by
162 votes.
This resolution provided that
"directly producing" would be
"defined by a joint committee" of
three elected representatives each from
the ASSU Senate, the Faculty Senate,
and the staff at large. This joint
committee does not yet exist, though it
was to have decided the question of
"direct production" by May 25, 1971.
According to Larry Diamond, ASSU
co-president, "We're inviting Lyman to
the rally to explain to the student body
why a policy for a student service that
was rejected at the polls last spring is
still in effect this fall."
Diamond emphasized the "legal,
peaceful, and non-violent" nature of
the planned protest.
On October 27, the ASSU Council
of Presidents sent a letter to Placement
Center Director Ralph Keller, asking
him to "cancel the interviews for the
above mentioned corporations and
services next week."
The letter requested Keller to
inform the corporations and services
that, while they were welcome to
discuss their policies and contracts on
campus, they "may not come here to
conduct their business, which is
recruiting."
The ASSU group cited the recruiting
plan as "another case of the contempt
and disdain with which administrators
at this University so often regard any
vote of the student body" that
conflicts with their predetermined
notions.
After receiving a petition with 86
signatures from the Stanford
Community Women for Peace last
February, President Lyman refused to
bar defense-oriented recruiters from
campus.
He reconsidered in April, when the
women's group asked and received
permission from Professor Sanford
Dornbusch, Chairman of the Faculty
Senate, to present the issue to the
Senate's Executive Committee.

Lyman then referred the proposal to
the Committee on Services to Students,
where it has languished. The committee
conducted hearings and deliberations
during the spring, but presented no
recommendations.
The panel now cannot reach a
decision until two new student
members are appointed and the
President designates a chairman,
according to ex-officio member and
Acting Dean of Students Robert
Freelen. Freelen has covened the
committee for discussions this fall, but
would not predict when a report or
recommendation would be issued.
In their letter, the ASSU Presidents
argued that the issue "is whether
students are able to determine in an
official referendum how their own
facilities should be used."
The ASSU group also sent letters to
each of the defense-oriented companies
which plans to recruit next week, in
which they asked the corporations to
"respect this referendum and refrain
from sending your representatives to
conduct the business of recruiting at
the Placement Center next week."
However, the Council invited
companies to "come at any time to
discuss with the student body the
policies and contracts of your
corporation."
The groups who sent representatives
to the meeting last night, or who plan
to participate in the picketing, include:
Ecology House, Columbae House,
Concerned Asian Scholars, Stanford

Community Women for Peace, Young
Crows, Law School Guild, Faculty
Political Action Group, Stanford Peace
Action Coalition, Vietnam Veterans for
Peace, and the ASSU Council of
Presidents.
The companies recruiting during the
coming week include the 5 th, 9 th, and
10 th largest defense contractors, with
up to $883 million in military
contracts. Among these companies are
the manufacturers of the F-4 Phantom
and F-15 jet fighter-bombers, airborne
weapons systems, tanks, mortar shells,
warheads, torpedo equipment, and
anti-personnel bombs.
The defense-oriented companies are:
Hughes Research Labs,
McDonnell-Douglas, Naval Civil
Engineering Lab, Litton Industries,
General Motors Research Labs,
Honeywell, TRW Systems Group,
Asiatic Petroleum Corp., and Texas
Instruments Inc. About 7 4 students
have signed up to meet with recruiters
from these companies.
Director Ralph Keller of the
Placement Center defended the present
policy, maintaining that the freedom of
students to seek employment should
not be limited.
The Placement Center's "basic desire
is to stay out of controversy," Keller
noted. "We try to provide services to
each student."
He emphasized that all Placement
Center activities are open, unless a
student asks that information be kept
confidential.

vote of the student body" that
conflicts with their predetermined
notions.
After receiving a petition with 86
signatures from the Stanford
Community Women for Peace last
February, President Lyman refused to
bar defense-oriented recruiters from
campus.
He reconsidered in April, when the
women's group asked and received
permission from Professor Sanford
Dornbusch, Chairman of the Faculty
Senate, to present the issue to the
Senate's Executive Committee.

Lyman then referred the proposal to
the Committee on Services to Students,
where it has languished. The committee
conducted hearings and deliberations
during the spring, but presented no
recommendations.
The panel now cannot reach a
decision until two new student
members are appointed and the
President designates a chairman,
according to ex-officio member and
Acting Dean of Students Robert
Freelen. Freelen has covened the
committee for discussions this fall, but
would not predict when a report or
recommendation would be issued.
In their letter, the ASSU Presidents
argued that the issue "is whether
students are able to determine in an
official referendum how their own
facilities should be used."
The ASSU group also sent letters to
each of the defense-oriented companies
which plans to recruit next week, in
which they asked the corporations to
"respect this referendum and refrain
from sending your representatives to
conduct the business of recruiting at
the Placement Center next week."
However, the Council invited
companies to "come at any time to
discuss with the student body the
policies and contracts of your
corporation."
The groups who sent representatives
to the meeting last night, or who plan
to participate in the picketing, include:
Ecology House, Columbae House,
Concerned Asian Scholars, Stanford

Community Women for Peace, Young
Crows, Law School Guild, Faculty
Political Action Group, Stanford Peace
Action Coalition, Vietnam Veterans for
Peace, and the ASSU Council of
Presidents.
The companies recruiting during the
coming week include the 5 th, 9 th, and
10 th largest defense contractors, with
up to $883 million in military
contracts. Among these companies are
the manufacturers of the F-4 Phantom
and F-15 jet fighter-bombers, airborne
weapons systems, tanks, mortar shells,
warheads, torpedo equipment, and
anti-personnel bombs.
The defense-oriented companies are:
Hughes Research Labs,
McDonnell-Douglas, Naval Civil
Engineering Lab, Litton Industries,
General Motors Research Labs,
Honeywell, TRW Systems Group,
Asiatic Petroleum Corp., and Texas
Instruments Inc. About 7 4 students
have signed up to meet with recruiters
from these companies.
Director Ralph Keller of the
Placement Center defended the present
policy, maintaining that the freedom of
students to seek employment should
not be limited.
The Placement Center's "basic desire
is to stay out of controversy," Keller
noted. "We try to provide services to
each student."
He emphasized that all Placement
Center activities are open, unless a
student asks that information be kept
confidential.
A coalition of political action groups
agreed last night to picket the
Placement Center, beginning at 9 a.m.
Monday morning, in an attempt to
dissuade military and defense industry
recruiters from operating on campus.
After considering the possibility of
more aggressive demonstrations,
including a disruptive sit-in, the
meeting dec : ded to picket and mobilize
support on Monday, but left other
options open for use during the
remainder of the week.
In addition to the picketing
activities the group scheduled a rally in
front of the center at 12:30 p.m.
Monday, a sign-making party at
Columbae House Sunday night, and a

community meeting Monday night to
decide upon tactics to use in further
action.
In an attempt to provide
non-military employment
opportunities, the American Friends
Service Committee "Vocations for
Social Change" program from Berkeley
will set up alternative counseling next
to the Placement Center during the
picketing.
Eight large defense contractors are
scheduled to interview students at the
center during the coming week, along
with representatives of the U.S. Navy
and Air Force.
These activities violate two student
referendum proposals passed during
elections last spring, according to the

ASSU Council of Presidents.
A student referendum, passed last
spring, voted to "prohibit the use of
Stanford lands for military service
recruiting" passing by 451 votes, 194 7
to 1496.
Another resolution to "prohibit the
use of Stanford lands by corporations
that are directly producing material and
research for the military" passed by
162 votes.
This resolution provided that
"directly producing" would be
"defined by a joint committee" of
three elected representatives each from
the ASSU Senate, the Faculty Senate,
and the staff at large. This joint
committee does not yet exist, though it
was to have decided the question of
"direct production" by May 25, 1971.
According to Larry Diamond, ASSU
co-president, "We're inviting Lyman to
the rally to explain to the student body
why a policy for a student service that
was rejected at the polls last spring is
still in effect this fall."
Diamond emphasized the "legal,
peaceful, and non-violent" nature of
the planned protest.
On October 27, the ASSU Council
of Presidents sent a letter to Placement
Center Director Ralph Keller, asking
him to "cancel the interviews for the
above mentioned corporations and
services next week."
The letter requested Keller to
inform the corporations and services
that, while they were welcome to
discuss their policies and contracts on
campus, they "may not come here to
conduct their business, which is
recruiting."
The ASSU group cited the recruiting
plan as "another case of the contempt

He emphasized that all Placement
Center activities are open, unless a
student asks that information be kept
confidential.
A coalition of political action groups
agreed last night to picket the
Placement Center, beginning at 9 a.m.
Monday morning, in an attempt to
dissuade military and defense industry
recruiters from operating on campus.
After considering the possibility of
more aggressive demonstrations,
including a disruptive sit-in, the
meeting dec : ded to picket and mobilize
support on Monday, but left other
options open for use during the
remainder of the week.
In addition to the picketing
activities the group scheduled a rally in
front of the center at 12:30 p.m.
Monday, a sign-making party at
Columbae House Sunday night, and a

community meeting Monday night to
decide upon tactics to use in further
action.
In an attempt to provide
non-military employment
opportunities, the American Friends
Service Committee "Vocations for
Social Change" program from Berkeley
will set up alternative counseling next
to the Placement Center during the
picketing.
Eight large defense contractors are
scheduled to interview students at the
center during the coming week, along
with representatives of the U.S. Navy
and Air Force.
These activities violate two student
referendum proposals passed during
elections last spring, according to the

ASSU Council of Presidents.
A student referendum, passed last
spring, voted to "prohibit the use of
Stanford lands for military service
recruiting" passing by 451 votes, 194 7
to 1496.
Another resolution to "prohibit the
use of Stanford lands by corporations
that are directly producing material and
research for the military" passed by
162 votes.
This resolution provided that
"directly producing" would be
"defined by a joint committee" of
three elected representatives each from
the ASSU Senate, the Faculty Senate,
and the staff at large. This joint
committee does not yet exist, though it
was to have decided the question of
"direct production" by May 25, 1971.
According to Larry Diamond, ASSU
co-president, "We're inviting Lyman to
the rally to explain to the student body
why a policy for a student service that
was rejected at the polls last spring is
still in effect this fall."
Diamond emphasized the "legal,
peaceful, and non-violent" nature of
the planned protest.
On October 27, the ASSU Council
of Presidents sent a letter to Placement
Center Director Ralph Keller, asking
him to "cancel the interviews for the
above mentioned corporations and
services next week."
The letter requested Keller to
inform the corporations and services
that, while they were welcome to
discuss their policies and contracts on
campus, they "may not come here to
conduct their business, which is
recruiting."
The ASSU group cited the recruiting
plan as "another case of the contempt
and disdain with which administrators
at this University so often regard any
vote of the student body" that
conflicts with their predetermined
notions.
After receiving a petition with 86
signatures from the Stanford
Community Women for Peace last
February, President Lyman refused to
bar defense-oriented recruiters from
campus.
He reconsidered in April, when the
women's group asked and received
permission from Professor Sanford
Dornbusch, Chairman of the Faculty
Senate, to present the issue to the
Senate's Executive Committee.

Lyman then referred the proposal to
the Committee on Services to Students,
where it has languished. The committee
conducted hearings and deliberations
during the spring, but presented no
recommendations.
The panel now cannot reach a
decision until two new student
members are appointed and the
President designates a chairman,
according to ex-officio member and
Acting Dean of Students Robert
Freelen. Freelen has covened the
committee for discussions this fall, but
would not predict when a report or
recommendation would be issued.
In their letter, the ASSU Presidents
argued that the issue "is whether
students are able to determine in an
official referendum how their own
facilities should be used."
The ASSU group also sent letters to
each of the defense-oriented companies
which plans to recruit next week, in
which they asked the corporations to
"respect this referendum and refrain
from sending your representatives to
conduct the business of recruiting at
the Placement Center next week."
However, the Council invited
companies to "come at any time to
discuss with the student body the
policies and contracts of your
corporation."
The groups who sent representatives
to the meeting last night, or who plan
to participate in the picketing, include:
Ecology House, Columbae House,
Concerned Asian Scholars, Stanford

Community Women for Peace, Young
Crows, Law School Guild, Faculty
Political Action Group, Stanford Peace
Action Coalition, Vietnam Veterans for
Peace, and the ASSU Council of
Presidents.
The companies recruiting during the
coming week include the 5 th, 9 th, and
10 th largest defense contractors, with
up to $883 million in military
contracts. Among these companies are
the manufacturers of the F-4 Phantom
and F-15 jet fighter-bombers, airborne
weapons systems, tanks, mortar shells,
warheads, torpedo equipment, and
anti-personnel bombs.
The defense-oriented companies are:
Hughes Research Labs,
McDonnell-Douglas, Naval Civil
Engineering Lab, Litton Industries,
General Motors Research Labs,
Honeywell, TRW Systems Group,
Asiatic Petroleum Corp., and Texas
Instruments Inc. About 7 4 students
have signed up to meet with recruiters
from these companies.
Director Ralph Keller of the
Placement Center defended the present
policy, maintaining that the freedom of
students to seek employment should
not be limited.
The Placement Center's "basic desire
is to stay out of controversy," Keller
noted. "We try to provide services to
each student."
He emphasized that all Placement
Center activities are open, unless a
student asks that information be kept
confidential.
