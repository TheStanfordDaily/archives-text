# Poloists Take On Trojans
## 
### DOUG WILSON 
The USC water polo team,
which fell to the Stanford poloists
two weeks ago in Los Angeles,
will be looking to avenge their loss
this afternoon, as the Indians host
the Trojans at 3:30 p.m. at Encina
pool.
A complicated league picture
should add interest to today's
contest. Stanford, which lost to
non-conference power San Jose
last week, managed a relatively
easy 8-3 win over Southern Cal in
the teams' first meeting Oct. 16;
however, the Indians dropped
their match to UCLA in
sudden-death overtime the
previous day. Although UCLA has

also defeated USC. both the
Trojans and the Indians have
registered wins over Berkeley, the
fourth power in the Pacific-8 (and
national championship) race.
Stanford Coach Jim Gaughran
feels his team has recovered
sufficiently from both sickness
and the San Jose loss to repeat
their win over USC. "We looked
pretty good all week," he said,

"and played well in scrimmage on
Wednesday. On paper we should
beat them; if we lose, we won't
have any excuse."
Stanford is led by captain Rick
Massimino, who tops the scoring
statistics so far this season, and
who was responsible for five of
the seven goals scored against San
Jose.
