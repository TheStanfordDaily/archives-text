# Soccer Team Takes Second Place In Menlo Tournament
## 
### JAY GELLERT 
For the second straight year,
the Stanford soccer team finished
second in the Menlo Invitational.
After defeating Menlo College 1-0
in the first round, Stanford tied
San Francisco State 1-1 in
regulation play, and the
championship was decided on the
basis of five penalty kicks. San
Francisco State kicked three to
Stanford's two, giving SFS the
championship.
In the other games this week,
Stanford tied St. Mary's 1-1
Wednesday. This gives Stanford a
3-3-2 record with half the season
remaining.
The Stanford defense seems to
have finally jelled. By controlling
the ball in Stanford's offensive
zone, they limited opponents to
only 25 shots on goal as compared
to Stanford's 48. The return of
, (etterman Hunt Deming will
strengthen an already strong
defense.
Goalie Walter Harris also had a
fine week, limiting opponents to
only two goals. With experience,
Coach Priddle expects him to be
â€¢ very difficult to score on.
Erratic shooting proved to be
the only bad point in the team's
finest week this season. Coach
Priddle hopes that the return of
Steve Seay will help an offensive
team that could only convert on
three of forty-eight shot attempts.

The team came close to breaking
the game open in all three games
but could not score.
In the first round tournament
game with Menlo College, the
only scoring occurred halfway
into the first quarter, a Rocky
Barber goal on an assist by Mike
Frank. The remainder of the game
was a defensive struggle in which
Stanford controlled the ball and
came close to scores many times,
only to be thwarted by the
excellent play by the Menlo
goalie.
The championship game
against SFS was the same type of
game. Stanford, down 1-0 at the
half, tied the game in the third
quarter on a goal by Sam Casey,
assisted by Rocky Barber and
Mike Frank. There was no more
regulation game scoring, though
Stanford took ten shots in the
second half. San Francisco State
won the championship on penalty
kicks.
Affected by the gusty winds,,
neither St. Mary's nor Stanford |
could get much going in the third I
game. Marc Ritson scored early |
for Stanford with an assist from
Mike Frank. The second and third
quarters were defensive struggles
with Stanford unable to score

another goal on the nine other
shots they took. Finally, St.
Mary's tied the game with only
five minutes left on a break by the
left forward and an easy comer
kick.
Stanford, in its biggest game so
far this season, meets nationally
third-ranked University of San
Francisco at 11:30 a.m. Saturday
in San Francisco.
