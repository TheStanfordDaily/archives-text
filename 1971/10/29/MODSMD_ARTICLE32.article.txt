Police Threat Bill Signed
SACRAMENTO — Gov. Reagan signed legislation yesterday
to make it a crime to advocate killing or injuring a law
enforcement officer—and pointed the new law out to
"criminal and revolutionary alike."
The bill by Sen. Robert Lagomarsino, R-Ojai, makes it a
felony if the officer is harmed and a misdemeanor if he is
not.
"There is no doubt that the man who wears the badge
has become the No. 1 target of those who would destroy
our society," Reagan said.
"This legislation serves notice on the criminal and
revolutionary alike that Californians recognize the
responsibility we have to protect those brave men who
place their lives on the line to protect us," he said.
British Troops Retreat
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — Irish troops with guns at
the alert forced British troops trying to blow up a border
bridge between the two Irelands to back down yesterday.
The British troops, ordered to seal off minor roads to

gun-running guerrillas of the Irish Republican Army,
withdrew after 90 tense minutes. The bridge remained
intact.
The Irish claimed one end of vhe bridge was located
inside the Irish Republic border.
EEC Entry For Britain
LONDON — Parliament voted last night to take Britain into
the European Common Market, giving up a thousand years
of independent power status for a role in a united Europe.
The historic decision, Britain's most important foreign
policy shift in this century, came when the House of
Commons voted 356 to 244 to accept entry terms in
principle, a Conservative government majority of 112.
Earlier Thursday the House of Lords, traditionally
dominated by Conservatives among the hereditary and
appointed peers, ratified Common Market membership,
451 to 58.
A year-long battle remains to push detailed enabling
legislation through Parliament in time for Britain to join on
the target date of Jan 1,1973.
The opposition Labor party is committed to fighting it
all the way. But Prime Minister Edward Heath is staking the
survival of his Conservative government on getting it
through.
Three other applicant nations—lreland, Norway and
Denmark—must still decide whether to accept the entry
terms offered them.
Amchitka Test Okayed
WASHINGTON A U.S. Court of Appeals refused
yesterday to halt an underground atomic explosion on
Amchitka Island, but ordered the government to let a
federal district judge inspect secret documents on the
so-called Cannikin blast.
Government attorneys at the Justice Department and
lawyers for environment groups opposing the test held
separate strategy huddles to decide whether they would
appeal the dual decision.
A spokesman for the environment groups said they
would make a new effort to halt the test.
Powell's Worth Disclosed
WASHINGTON — Supreme Court nominee Lewis F.
Powell, Jr. holds stock worth nearly a half-million dollars in
six corporations of which he is a director.
Three of these corporations paid Powell's law firm
nearly $400,000 in legal fees during 1970.
This material, compiled from corporate proxy
statements filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, illustrates the financial stature of Powell, a
64-year-old lawyer from Richmond, Va.
