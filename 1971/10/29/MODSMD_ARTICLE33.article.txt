# Faculty Senate Adopts Procedures For SWOPSI Accreditation
## 
### PHIL REVZIN 
The Faculty Senate yesterday
adopted a charge to the Special Joint
Agency on Stanford Workshops on
Political and Social Issues, detailing
formal procedures for accredidation of
SWOPSI course, The Joint Agency
charge is similar to the charge adopted
last spring concerning the Student
Center for Innovation and Research in
Education (SCIRE).
The Agency is charged with
recommending awards of academic
credit for SWOPSI courses to the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies.
Recommendations for SWOPSI courses
will be made by the Agency no later

than the sixth week of the quarter
before the course is to begin.
The Senate began discussion of a
task force report studying the
formation of a Standing Committee or
Commission to study the professoriate
at Stanford.
The task force report recommends
the formation of a Standing Committee
of the Academic Council to investigate
the general areas of reappointment and
granting of tenure, equity in the
appointment of academically qualified
personnel and options for early or late
retirement of personnel.
The Senate delayed action on the
proposal until at least the next meeting,
and will probably delay action until

input from the now-occupied Advisory
Board can be obtained.
The report, issued by a committee
chaired by Assistant Professor of
English William M. Chace, stated that in
the area of tenure, since several bodies
of the university are involved in such
decisions, "the perfect working of such
a system is dependent upon a clear and
explicit understanding of the standards
involved and how and when they are
brought into play."
The report also recommended that
the proposed committee discuss "the
large number of expertly-qualified
individuals occupying non-teaching
posts within the university, particularly
in the engineering and medical
disciplines, who must be provided
greater professional protection than is
now available to them."
The third area of immediate concern
to the committee would be "the ways,
if any,in which academic appointees
can be offered the options of retiring
early, or of devoting only a part of
their professional time to the
university, or of continuing beyond the
age of sixty-five as teachers, scholars, or
researchers."
The committee, if eventually
formed, would serve as an advisory
body to the president.
