# Radical Ban Bill Amended
## 
### 
State Sen. Clark Bradley's so-called
"radical ban" bill that would allow
presidents of private colleges to bar
undesirables from campuses has been
substantially amended by the Assembly
Criminal Justice Committee.
The amended text of the bill,
released by Bradley's office this week,
tightens the language of the bill and
excludes application to students,
college employees, or persons required
by their employment to be on campus,
including, presumably, reporters.
In an interview earlier this week,
Bradley's administrative assistant, Peter
Caldwell, denied that the committee
had made any "substantial changes."
In addition to specifying that
students and University employees are
exempt from the provision, the
rewritten version restricts the situations
in which the power may be utilized.
The bill now provides that a person
can be barred from the campus if he "is
commiting any act likely to interfere
with the peaceful conduct of
activities. . .or has entered such
campus. . .for the purpose of
committing any such act."
The original language provided for

more discretion on the part of the
president, who would have had the
power to banish any person if it
"reasonably appeared" that the person
would disrupt the institution.
The bill, in its original form, passed
the State Senate on a 22-1 vote, one
over the necessary majority. If the bill
in its amended form is approved by the
Assembly, it will go back to the Senate
for concurrence in the amendments.
