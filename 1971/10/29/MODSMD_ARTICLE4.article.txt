# Kaplan Likely To Head SJC
## 
### BOB MICHELET Second of a two-part series 
The scope of the present controversy over reform
of the Stanford Judicial Council is widened by the
outspoken views of Law professor John Kaplan, who
most likely will be SJC chairman if it does ge started
this year.
The SJC is presently inactive due to the refusal of
the Student Senate to appoint student members to it.
Most see this as a move to force changes in the
Council. Some students claim the SJC is
undemocratic in structure.
Though the chairman cannot officially be
appointed until four students join the council,
President Lyman has used the delay to assure that
Kaplan will be available for the position.
Kaplan terms the proposed changes "absurd" and
"colossal chutzpah."
Though opposed to the structure of the present
SJC, Kaplan says he would accept the chairmanship
because "somebody has to take the job. I consented
because I believe a person has to do something to
keep the university functioning as an institution and
because if I didn't do it some other poor bastard
would get stuck with it."
Student Duty
He claims that "students have a duty" to live up to
agreements such as those creating the SJC. "When
people—or people's predecessors—make agreements,
they should keep them.

"If students ever expect that others will ever take
negotiating with them seriously, they will have to
realize that an agreement is not good only as long as
the students don't change their minds."
Kaplan claims the Student Senate "has become a
sandbox," and though arguing the SJC is "a
legitimate institution" of the university, he calls it
"an unfortunate" one.
Peer-Group Pressure
He says it is unfair to the faculty to make them
judge students. "The faculty's job is to teach, to do
research and to be decent to students—not to
discipline them."
On the other hand, he notes, students are
subjected to an unacceptable amount of "peer-group
pressure and aren't very good at resisting it."
"The major right students should have," Kaplan
says, "is not to be judged by the administration
which is bringing charges. The SJC meets this
criterion but is defective on all sorts of other
grounds."
Outside Arbitration
He favors, instead, the complete dissolution of the
present system and replacement by one perhaps
analogous to the system of arbitration in labor
disputes.
Like the university administration, Kaplan argues
that any changes in the system must be accomplished
through established channels.

At yesterday's Faculty Senate meeting, Electrical
Engineering Professor Frederick Crawford, newly
appointed chairman of the Committee of Fifteen
(C-15), said student inactivity raises the question
whether the faculty and administration are still
bound by the SJC Charter.
'Nothing Illegal *
ASSU Council of Presidents member Ann Kimball,
commenting on Crawford's remarks, claimed that
"students are not deviating or going beyond the
Charter," and that refusal to appoint student
members "is a legal thing to do."
She said the C-15, which deals with all proposed
SJC changes, should drop its pending business to
consider a plan for an interim student council.
Kimball has advocated this route in the past "to avert
complete chaos in the judicial system here."
Not Always Happy
Special Assistant to the President John Schwartz
says even the administration is not always happy with
SJC decisions, but claims it has consistently used the
channels set down in the SJC Charter, "even though
it is a lengthy and cumbersome procedure."
He admits the administration has considered
several alternatives to get around the present
deadlock, some of them employing the President's
powers to take steps outside the Charter, but is quick
to add. though, that no action is planned for now.

JOHN KAPLAN—Rumored to be the only law professor willing to accept the
position of chairman of the SJC, Kaplan expressed his feeling that although the
judicial body is far from perfect, "somebody has to take the job."
The administration, however, claims
that the Senate's action is
"irresponsible," and that any reforms
must be handled through normal
procedures and "not through some
method of blackmail."
Kaplan says the proposed changes
are "in the wrong direction" and argues
that the present SJC should be
replaced.
The reforms advocated in last
spring's student referendum on changes
in the SJC are now before the C-15
which began discussion on them last
week.

Kaplan emphasizes he will only serve
on the SJC if its student members are
chosen through normal procedures and
not, for example, by the President.
The present impasse includes
arguments common to many
student-administration clashes. Student
critics of the SJC say the system is
unfair and leaves students powerless.
"Students should have more voice, have
a bit more leverage and more assurance
of due process," Council of Presidents
member Doug McHenry argues.
Thus, most predict, no Senate action
until reform.
