## Equality In Personal Relationships 
### 
Last In A Scries
"Wives, submit yourselvs unto
your own husbnads, as unto the
Lord. For the husband is the head
of the wife, even as Christ is the
head of the church; and he is the
savior of the body. Therefore, as
the church is subject unto Christ,
so let the wives be to their own
husbands in everything." (eph. 5)
As this passage reveals, the
ideological rationalization that
men and women hold
complementary but equal
positions is a recent invention of
our modern "liberal" society, part
of the equalitarian veneer which
helps to keep today's version of
the ideology nonconscious.
Certainly those Americans who
value open, honest, and
equalitarian relationships
generally are quick to reject this
traditional view of the
male-female relationship; and, an
increasing number of young
people even plan to enter
"utopian" marriages very much
like the following:
"Both my wife and I earned Ph.D.
degreees in our respective
disciplines. I turned down a
superior academic post in Oregon
and accepted a slightly less
desirable position in New York
where my wife could obtain a
part-time teaching job and do
research at one of the several
other colleges in the area.
Although I would have preferred
to live in a suburb, we purchased a
horse near my wife's college so
that she could have an office at
home where she would be when
the children returned from school.
Because my wife earns a good
salary, she can easily afford to pay
a maid to do her major household
chores. My wife and I share all
other tasks around the house
equally. For example, she cooks
the meals, but I do the laundry for
her and help her with many of
her other household tasks."
Without questioning the basic
happiness of such a marriage or its
appropriateness for many couples,
we can legitimately ask if such a
marriage is, in fact, an instance of
interpersonal equality. Have all
the hidden assumptions about the
women's "natural" role really
been eliminated? Has the
traditional ideology really been
exercised? There is a very simple
test. If the marriage is truly
equalitarian, then its description
should retain the same flavor and
tone even if the roles of the
husband and wife were to be
reversed:
"Both my husband and I
earned Ph.D. degrees in our
respective disciplines. I turned
down a superior academic post in
Oregon and accepted a slightly

less desirable position in New
York where my husband could
obtain a part-time teaching job
and do research at one of the
several other colleges in the area.
Although I would have preferred
to live in a suburb, we purchased
a home near my husband's college
so that he could have an office at
home where he would be when
the children returned from school.
Because my husband earns a
good salary, he can easily afford
to pay a maid to do his major
household chores. My husband
and I share all other tasks around
the house equally. For example,
he cooks the meals, but I do the
laundry for him and help him
with many of his other household
tasks."
It seems unlikely that many
men or women in our society
would mistake the marriage just
described as either equalitarian or
desirable, and thus it becomes
apparent that the ideology about
the women's "natural" role
nonsciously permeates the entire
fabric of such "utopian"
marriages. It is true that the wife
gains some measure of equality
when her career can influence the
final place of residence, but why
is it the unquestioned assumption
that the husband's career solely
determines the initial set of
alternatives that are to be
considered? Why is it the wife
who automatically seeks the
part-time position? Why is it her
maid instead of their maid? Why
her laundry? Why her household
tasks? And so forth throughout
the entire relationship.
The important point here is
not that such marriages are bad or
that their basic assumptions of
inequality produce unhappy,
frustrated women. Quite the
contrary. It is the very happiness
of the wives in such marriages that
reveals society's smashing success
in socializing its women. It is a
measure of the distance our
society must yet traverse toward
the goals of self-fulfillment and
interpersonal equality that such
marriages are widely characterized
as utopian and fully equalitarian.
It is a mark of how well the
woman has been kept in her place
that the husband in such a
marriage is often idolized by
women, including his wife, for
"permitting" her to squeeze a
career into the interstices of their
marriage as long as his own career
is not unduly inconvenienced.
Thus is the white man blessed for
exercising his power benignly
while his "natural" right to that
power forever remains
unquestioned.
Such is the subtlety of a
nonconscious ideology!

A truly equalitarian marriage
would permit both partners to
pursue careers or outside
commitments which carry equal
weight when all important
decisions are to be made. It is
here, of course, that the
"problem" of children arises.
People often assume that the
woman who seeks a role beyond
home and family would not care
to have children. They assume
that if she wants a career or
serious outside commitment, then
children must be unimportant to
her. But of course no one makes
this assumption about her
husband.
No one assumes that a father's
interest in his career necessarily
precludes a deep and abiding
affection for his children or a vital
interest in their development.
Once again America applies a
double standard of judgment.
Suppose that a father of small
children suddenly lost his wife.
No matter how much he loved his
children, no one would expect
him to sacrifice his career in order
to stay home with them on a
full-time basis—even if he had an
independent source of income.
. No one would charge him with
selfishness or lack of parental
feeling if he sought professional
care for his children during the
day. An equalitarian marriage
simply abolishes this double
standard and extends the same
freedom to the mother, while also
providing the framework for the
father to enter more fully into the
pleasures and responsibilities of
child rearing. In fact, it is the
equalitarian marriage which has
the most potential for giving
children the love and concern of
two parents rather than one.
But few women are prepared
to make use of this freedom. Even
those women who have managed
to finesse society's attempt to rob
them of their career motiviations
are likely to find themselves
blocked by society's trump card:
the feeling that the raising of the
children is their unique
responsibility and—in time of
crisis—ultimately theirs alone.
Such is the emotional power of a
nonconscious ideology.
In addition to providing this
potential for equalized child care,
a truly equalitarian marriage
embraces a more general division
of labor which satisfies what
might be called "the roommate
test." That is, the labor is divided
just as it is when two men or two
women room together in college
or set up a bachelor apartment
together. Errands and domestic
chores are assigned by preference,
agreement, flipping a coin, given

to hired help, or-as is sometimes
the case—left undone.
It is significant that today's
young people, many of whom live
this way prior to marriage, find
this kind of arrangement within
marriage so foreign to their
thinking. Consider an analogy.
Suppose that a white male college
student decided to room or set up
a bachelor apartment with a black
male friend. Surely the typical
white student would not blithely
assume that his black roommate
was to handle all the domestic
chores. Nor would his conscience
allow him to do so even in the
unlikely event that his roommate
would say: "No, that's okay. I
like doing hosuework. I'd be
happy to do it."
We suspect that the typical
white student would still not be

sandra bem and daryl bem

comfortable if he took advantage
of this offer, if he took advantage
of the fact that his roommate had
been socialized to be "happy"
with such an arrangement. But
change this hypothetical black
roommate to a female marriage
partner, and somehow the
student's conscience goes to sleep.
At most it is quickly tranquilized
by the thought that "she is
happiest when she is ironing for
her loved one." Such is the power
of a nonconscious ideology.
Of course, it may well be that
she is happiest when she is ironing
for her loved one.
Such, indeed, is the power of a
nonconscious ideology!

children, no one would expect
him to sacrifice his career in order
to stay home with them on a
full-time basis—even if he had an
independent source of income.

selfishness or lack of parental
feeling if he sought professional
care for his children during the

simply abolishes this double

father to enter more fully into the
pleasures and responsibilities of
child rearing. In fact, it is the
equalitarian marriage which has
the most potential for giving

But few women are prepared

the feeling that the raising of the

Such is the emotional power of a
nonconscious ideology.
In addition to providing this
potential for equalized child care,
a truly equalitarian marriage
embraces a more general division
of labor which satisfies what
might be called "the roommate
test." That is, the labor is divided
just as it is when two men or two
women room together in college
or set up a bachelor apartment
together. Errands and domestic
chores are assigned by preference,
agreement, flipping a coin, given

to hired help, or-as is sometimes
the case—left undone.
It is significant that today's
young people, many of whom live
this way prior to marriage, find
this kind of arrangement within
marriage so foreign to their
thinking. Consider an analogy.
Suppose that a white male college
student decided to room or set up
a bachelor apartment with a black
male friend. Surely the typical
white student would not blithely
assume that his black roommate
was to handle all the domestic
chores. Nor would his conscience
allow him to do so even in the
unlikely event that his roommate
would say: "No, that's okay. I
like doing hosuework. I'd be
happy to do it."
We suspect that the typical
white student would still not be

sandra bem and daryl bem

comfortable if he took advantage
of this offer, if he took advantage
of the fact that his roommate had
been socialized to be "happy"
with such an arrangement. But
change this hypothetical black
roommate to a female marriage
partner, and somehow the
student's conscience goes to sleep.
At most it is quickly tranquilized
by the thought that "she is
happiest when she is ironing for
her loved one." Such is the power
of a nonconscious ideology.
Of course, it may well be that
she is happiest when she is ironing
for her loved one.
Such, indeed, is the power of a

As this passage reveals, the
ideological rationalization that
men and women hold
complementary but equal
positions is a recent invention of
our modern "liberal" society, part
of the equalitarian veneer which
helps to keep today's version of
the ideology nonconscious.
Certainly those Americans who
value open, honest, and
equalitarian relationships
generally are quick to reject this
traditional view of the
male-female relationship; and, an
increasing number of young
people even plan to enter
"utopian" marriages very much
like the following:
"Both my wife and I earned Ph.D.
degreees in our respective
disciplines. I turned down a
superior academic post in Oregon
and accepted a slightly less
desirable position in New York
where my wife could obtain a
part-time teaching job and do
research at one of the several
other colleges in the area.
Although I would have preferred
to live in a suburb, we purchased a
horse near my wife's college so
that she could have an office at
home where she would be when
the children returned from school.
Because my wife earns a good
salary, she can easily afford to pay
a maid to do her major household
chores. My wife and I share all
other tasks around the house
equally. For example, she cooks
the meals, but I do the laundry for
her and help her with many of
her other household tasks."
Without questioning the basic
happiness of such a marriage or its
appropriateness for many couples,
we can legitimately ask if such a
marriage is, in fact, an instance of
interpersonal equality. Have all
the hidden assumptions about the
women's "natural" role really
been eliminated? Has the
traditional ideology really been
exercised? There is a very simple
test. If the marriage is truly
equalitarian, then its description
should retain the same flavor and
tone even if the roles of the
husband and wife were to be
reversed:
"Both my husband and I
earned Ph.D. degrees in our

he cooks the meals, but I do the
laundry for him and help him
with many of his other household

It seems unlikely that many
men or women in our society
would mistake the marriage just
described as either equalitarian or
desirable, and thus it becomes
apparent that the ideology about
the women's "natural" role
nonsciously permeates the entire
fabric of such "utopian"
marriages. It is true that the wife
gains some measure of equality
when her career can influence the
final place of residence, but why
is it the unquestioned assumption
that the husband's career solely
determines the initial set of
alternatives that are to be
considered? Why is it the wife
who automatically seeks the
part-time position? Why is it her
maid instead of their maid? Why
her laundry? Why her household
tasks? And so forth throughout
the entire relationship.
The important point here is
not that such marriages are bad or
that their basic assumptions of
inequality produce unhappy,
frustrated women. Quite the
contrary. It is the very happiness
of the wives in such marriages that
reveals society's smashing success
in socializing its women. It is a
measure of the distance our
society must yet traverse toward
the goals of self-fulfillment and
interpersonal equality that such
marriages are widely characterized
as utopian and fully equalitarian.
It is a mark of how well the
woman has been kept in her place
that the husband in such a
marriage is often idolized by
women, including his wife, for
"permitting" her to squeeze a
career into the interstices of their
marriage as long as his own career
is not unduly inconvenienced.
Thus is the white man blessed for
exercising his power benignly
while his "natural" right to that
power forever remains
unquestioned.
Such is the subtlety of a
nonconscious ideology!

A truly equalitarian marriage
would permit both partners to
pursue careers or outside
commitments which carry equal
weight when all important
decisions are to be made. It is
here, of course, that the
"problem" of children arises.
People often assume that the
woman who seeks a role beyond
home and family would not care
to have children. They assume
that if she wants a career or
serious outside commitment, then
children must be unimportant to
her. But of course no one makes
this assumption about her
husband.
No one assumes that a father's
interest in his career necessarily
precludes a deep and abiding
affection for his children or a vital
interest in their development.
Once again America applies a
double standard of judgment.
Suppose that a father of small
children suddenly lost his wife.
No matter how much he loved his
children, no one would expect
him to sacrifice his career in order
to stay home with them on a
full-time basis—even if he had an
independent source of income.

so that he could have an office at
home where he would be when
the children returned from school.
Because my husband earns a
good salary, he can easily afford
to pay a maid to do his major
household chores. My husband
and I share all other tasks around
the house equally. For example,
he cooks the meals, but I do the
laundry for him and help him
with many of his other household
tasks."
It seems unlikely that many
men or women in our society
would mistake the marriage just
described as either equalitarian or
desirable, and thus it becomes
apparent that the ideology about
the women's "natural" role
nonsciously permeates the entire
fabric of such "utopian"
marriages. It is true that the wife
gains some measure of equality
when her career can influence the
final place of residence, but why
is it the unquestioned assumption
that the husband's career solely
determines the initial set of
alternatives that are to be
considered? Why is it the wife
who automatically seeks the
part-time position? Why is it her
maid instead of their maid? Why
her laundry? Why her household
tasks? And so forth throughout
the entire relationship.
The important point here is
not that such marriages are bad or
that their basic assumptions of
inequality produce unhappy,
frustrated women. Quite the
contrary. It is the very happiness
of the wives in such marriages that
reveals society's smashing success
in socializing its women. It is a
measure of the distance our
society must yet traverse toward
the goals of self-fulfillment and
interpersonal equality that such
marriages are widely characterized
as utopian and fully equalitarian.
It is a mark of how well the
woman has been kept in her place
that the husband in such a
marriage is often idolized by
women, including his wife, for
"permitting" her to squeeze a
career into the interstices of their
marriage as long as his own career
is not unduly inconvenienced.
Thus is the white man blessed for
exercising his power benignly
while his "natural" right to that
power forever remains
unquestioned.
Such is the subtlety of a
nonconscious ideology!

A truly equalitarian marriage
would permit both partners to
pursue careers or outside
commitments which carry equal
weight when all important
decisions are to be made. It is
here, of course, that the
"problem" of children arises.
People often assume that the
woman who seeks a role beyond
home and family would not care
to have children. They assume
that if she wants a career or
serious outside commitment, then
children must be unimportant to
her. But of course no one makes
this assumption about her
husband.
No one assumes that a father's
interest in his career necessarily
precludes a deep and abiding
affection for his children or a vital
interest in their development.
Once again America applies a
double standard of judgment.
Suppose that a father of small
children suddenly lost his wife.
No matter how much he loved his
children, no one would expect
him to sacrifice his career in order
to stay home with them on a
full-time basis—even if he had an
independent source of income.
. No one would charge him with
selfishness or lack of parental
feeling if he sought professional
care for his children during the
day. An equalitarian marriage
simply abolishes this double
standard and extends the same
freedom to the mother, while also
providing the framework for the
father to enter more fully into the
pleasures and responsibilities of
child rearing. In fact, it is the
equalitarian marriage which has
the most potential for giving
children the love and concern of
two parents rather than one.
But few women are prepared
to make use of this freedom. Even
those women who have managed
to finesse society's attempt to rob
them of their career motiviations
are likely to find themselves
blocked by society's trump card:
the feeling that the raising of the
children is their unique
responsibility and—in time of
crisis—ultimately theirs alone.
Such is the emotional power of a
nonconscious ideology.
In addition to providing this
potential for equalized child care,
a truly equalitarian marriage
embraces a more general division
of labor which satisfies what
might be called "the roommate
test." That is, the labor is divided
just as it is when two men or two
women room together in college
or set up a bachelor apartment
together. Errands and domestic
chores are assigned by preference,
agreement, flipping a coin, given

to hired help, or-as is sometimes
the case—left undone.
It is significant that today's
young people, many of whom live
this way prior to marriage, find
this kind of arrangement within
marriage so foreign to their
thinking. Consider an analogy.
Suppose that a white male college
student decided to room or set up
a bachelor apartment with a black
male friend. Surely the typical
white student would not blithely
assume that his black roommate
was to handle all the domestic
chores. Nor would his conscience
allow him to do so even in the
unlikely event that his roommate
would say: "No, that's okay. I
like doing hosuework. I'd be
happy to do it."
We suspect that the typical
white student would still not be

sandra bem and daryl bem

comfortable if he took advantage
of this offer, if he took advantage
of the fact that his roommate had
been socialized to be "happy"
with such an arrangement. But
change this hypothetical black
roommate to a female marriage
partner, and somehow the
student's conscience goes to sleep.
At most it is quickly tranquilized
by the thought that "she is
happiest when she is ironing for
her loved one." Such is the power
of a nonconscious ideology.
Of course, it may well be that
she is happiest when she is ironing
for her loved one.
Such, indeed, is the power of a
nonconscious ideology!

"Wives, submit yourselvs unto

Lord. For the husband is the head
of the wife, even as Christ is the
head of the church; and he is the
savior of the body. Therefore, as
the church is subject unto Christ,
so let the wives be to their own
husbands in everything." (eph. 5)
As this passage reveals, the
ideological rationalization that
men and women hold
complementary but equal
positions is a recent invention of
our modern "liberal" society, part
of the equalitarian veneer which
helps to keep today's version of
the ideology nonconscious.
Certainly those Americans who
value open, honest, and
equalitarian relationships
generally are quick to reject this
traditional view of the
male-female relationship; and, an
increasing number of young
people even plan to enter
"utopian" marriages very much
like the following:
"Both my wife and I earned Ph.D.
degreees in our respective
disciplines. I turned down a
superior academic post in Oregon
and accepted a slightly less
desirable position in New York
where my wife could obtain a
part-time teaching job and do
research at one of the several
other colleges in the area.
Although I would have preferred
to live in a suburb, we purchased a
horse near my wife's college so
that she could have an office at

we can legitimately ask if such a
marriage is, in fact, an instance of
interpersonal equality. Have all
the hidden assumptions about the
women's "natural" role really
been eliminated? Has the
traditional ideology really been
exercised? There is a very simple
test. If the marriage is truly
equalitarian, then its description
should retain the same flavor and
tone even if the roles of the
husband and wife were to be
reversed:

Last In A Scries
"Wives, submit yourselvs unto
your own husbnads, as unto the
Lord. For the husband is the head
of the wife, even as Christ is the
head of the church; and he is the
savior of the body. Therefore, as
the church is subject unto Christ,
so let the wives be to their own
husbands in everything." (eph. 5)
As this passage reveals, the
ideological rationalization that
men and women hold
complementary but equal
positions is a recent invention of
our modern "liberal" society, part
of the equalitarian veneer which
helps to keep today's version of
the ideology nonconscious.
Certainly those Americans who
value open, honest, and
equalitarian relationships
generally are quick to reject this
traditional view of the
male-female relationship; and, an
increasing number of young
people even plan to enter
"utopian" marriages very much
like the following:
"Both my wife and I earned Ph.D.
degreees in our respective
disciplines. I turned down a
superior academic post in Oregon
and accepted a slightly less
desirable position in New York
where my wife could obtain a
part-time teaching job and do
research at one of the several
other colleges in the area.
Although I would have preferred
to live in a suburb, we purchased a
horse near my wife's college so
that she could have an office at
home where she would be when
the children returned from school.
Because my wife earns a good
salary, she can easily afford to pay
a maid to do her major household
chores. My wife and I share all
other tasks around the house
equally. For example, she cooks
the meals, but I do the laundry for
her and help her with many of
her other household tasks."
Without questioning the basic
happiness of such a marriage or its
appropriateness for many couples,
we can legitimately ask if such a
marriage is, in fact, an instance of
interpersonal equality. Have all
the hidden assumptions about the
women's "natural" role really
been eliminated? Has the
traditional ideology really been
exercised? There is a very simple
test. If the marriage is truly
equalitarian, then its description
should retain the same flavor and
tone even if the roles of the
husband and wife were to be
reversed:
"Both my husband and I
earned Ph.D. degrees in our
respective disciplines. I turned
down a superior academic post in
Oregon and accepted a slightly

less desirable position in New
York where my husband could
obtain a part-time teaching job
and do research at one of the
several other colleges in the area.
Although I would have preferred
to live in a suburb, we purchased
a home near my husband's college
so that he could have an office at
home where he would be when
the children returned from school.
Because my husband earns a
good salary, he can easily afford
to pay a maid to do his major
household chores. My husband
and I share all other tasks around
the house equally. For example,
he cooks the meals, but I do the
laundry for him and help him
with many of his other household
tasks."
It seems unlikely that many
men or women in our society
would mistake the marriage just
described as either equalitarian or
desirable, and thus it becomes
apparent that the ideology about
the women's "natural" role
nonsciously permeates the entire
fabric of such "utopian"
marriages. It is true that the wife
gains some measure of equality
when her career can influence the
final place of residence, but why
is it the unquestioned assumption
that the husband's career solely
determines the initial set of
alternatives that are to be
considered? Why is it the wife
who automatically seeks the
part-time position? Why is it her
maid instead of their maid? Why
her laundry? Why her household
tasks? And so forth throughout
the entire relationship.
The important point here is
not that such marriages are bad or
that their basic assumptions of
inequality produce unhappy,
frustrated women. Quite the
contrary. It is the very happiness
of the wives in such marriages that
reveals society's smashing success
in socializing its women. It is a
measure of the distance our
society must yet traverse toward
the goals of self-fulfillment and
interpersonal equality that such
marriages are widely characterized
as utopian and fully equalitarian.
It is a mark of how well the
woman has been kept in her place
that the husband in such a
marriage is often idolized by
women, including his wife, for
"permitting" her to squeeze a
career into the interstices of their
marriage as long as his own career
is not unduly inconvenienced.
Thus is the white man blessed for
exercising his power benignly
while his "natural" right to that
power forever remains
unquestioned.
Such is the subtlety of a
nonconscious ideology!

A truly equalitarian marriage
would permit both partners to
pursue careers or outside
commitments which carry equal
weight when all important
decisions are to be made. It is
here, of course, that the
"problem" of children arises.
People often assume that the
woman who seeks a role beyond
home and family would not care
to have children. They assume
that if she wants a career or
serious outside commitment, then
children must be unimportant to
her. But of course no one makes
this assumption about her
husband.
No one assumes that a father's
interest in his career necessarily
precludes a deep and abiding
affection for his children or a vital
interest in their development.
Once again America applies a
double standard of judgment.
Suppose that a father of small
children suddenly lost his wife.
No matter how much he loved his
children, no one would expect
him to sacrifice his career in order
to stay home with them on a
full-time basis—even if he had an
independent source of income.
. No one would charge him with
selfishness or lack of parental
feeling if he sought professional
care for his children during the
day. An equalitarian marriage
simply abolishes this double
standard and extends the same
freedom to the mother, while also
providing the framework for the
father to enter more fully into the
pleasures and responsibilities of
child rearing. In fact, it is the
equalitarian marriage which has
the most potential for giving
children the love and concern of
two parents rather than one.
But few women are prepared
to make use of this freedom. Even
those women who have managed
to finesse society's attempt to rob
them of their career motiviations
are likely to find themselves
blocked by society's trump card:
the feeling that the raising of the
children is their unique
responsibility and—in time of
crisis—ultimately theirs alone.
Such is the emotional power of a
nonconscious ideology.
In addition to providing this
potential for equalized child care,
a truly equalitarian marriage
embraces a more general division
of labor which satisfies what
might be called "the roommate
test." That is, the labor is divided
just as it is when two men or two
women room together in college
or set up a bachelor apartment
together. Errands and domestic
chores are assigned by preference,
agreement, flipping a coin, given

to hired help, or-as is sometimes
the case—left undone.
It is significant that today's
young people, many of whom live
this way prior to marriage, find
this kind of arrangement within
marriage so foreign to their
thinking. Consider an analogy.
Suppose that a white male college
student decided to room or set up
a bachelor apartment with a black
male friend. Surely the typical
white student would not blithely
assume that his black roommate
was to handle all the domestic
chores. Nor would his conscience
allow him to do so even in the
unlikely event that his roommate
would say: "No, that's okay. I
like doing hosuework. I'd be
happy to do it."
We suspect that the typical
white student would still not be

sandra bem and daryl bem

comfortable if he took advantage
of this offer, if he took advantage
of the fact that his roommate had
been socialized to be "happy"
with such an arrangement. But
change this hypothetical black
roommate to a female marriage
partner, and somehow the
student's conscience goes to sleep.
At most it is quickly tranquilized
by the thought that "she is
happiest when she is ironing for
her loved one." Such is the power
of a nonconscious ideology.
Of course, it may well be that
she is happiest when she is ironing
for her loved one.
