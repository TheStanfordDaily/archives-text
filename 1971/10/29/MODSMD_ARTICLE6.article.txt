Ad Hoc Witch-Hunt
Eklitor, THE DAILY:
As a result of their so-called
"investigation" of Dr. Heinrich
Rose, Mr. Knutson and Mr. Loeb
have concluded that Dr. Roses's
research can be used to
"determine" thresholds of human

retinal damage caused by light
resembling that of a nuclear
flash." They also conclude that
these data will allow the proper
"shielding" so that aircrews can
carry out their missions "without
worrying about flash hazards."
If these conclusions are
anywhere near accurate, Knutson

and Loeb have overlooked a far
more important use of Dr. Rose's
data. Responsible officials should
be interested in reliable methods
of estimating the extent and
distribution of the enormous
amount of eye damage that would
be suffered by the civilian
population if this country came

under nuclear attack. I would
imagine that even Mr. Knutson
and Mr. Loeb would be interested
in the possibilities of damage to
their eyes if a small atomic bomb
were detonated over Moffett
Field.
Only the naive would believe
that this country could long
survive without a nuclear
deterrent. I fail to understand
why it is inhumane to protect the
eyes of the crewmen that are
responsible for part of this
deterrent.
The investigation of Mr. Loeb
and Mr. Knutson has all the
earmarks of another ad hoc
witch-hunt to provide a rallying
point for the local radicals. I
suspect that the SWOPSI report
on Defense Department funded
research at Stanford will be used
in several witch-hunts this
academic year by persons with
virtually no understanding of
scientific research.
