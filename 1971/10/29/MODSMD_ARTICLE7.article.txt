## Ah! The Futility Of It All 
### 
Jerry Coleman, little known humorist and
student at a prestigeous West Coast University, was
found dead in his room late last night. Authorities
feiar homicide but admit they have no real leads to
go on. Preliminary examinations made during the
police autopsy revealed many and conflicting
conjectures.
The marks left on Coleman's body point to the
conclusion that he was brutally squeezed by an
enraged polar bear. But Dr. W 's hypotehsis of
suffocation by being surround by Pacific abalonies
is supported by the great quantities of seaweed
found in the room. None of the detectives, though,
has been able to explain the tread marks staining the
walls of Coleman's room. Authorities have therefore
hesitantly sent out an all-points bulletin for a polar
bear traveling with a pack of abalonies in a '65 jeep.
The police urge all local citizens to be on the
lookout for any such suspicious characters, and to
report any findings immediately. Extreme caution is
to be used, for these killers are dangerous. At a press
conference this evening, Police Chief H remarked,
"These cases are fairly common; we should have
everything wrapped up by the end of the week."
Coleman is the beloved son of Mr. and Mrs.
Ira Coleman, the beloved brother of Don and Fred

Coleman. He leaves behind a few angry tennis
friends—angry because his death leaves them no one
they can easily beat. He never considered himself
very lucky, having lost most sweepstakes he entered,
and drawing 9146 in the Stanford Housing Draw
and 54 in the Draft Lottery. Last night's incident
merely reveals that Coleman's number has finally
run out.
This reported asked two of Coleman's closest
friends to comment on what his loss will mean.
Philip R (all names have been changed to protect
the innocent) remarked that it was a shame Jerry
couldn't have finished his classes. "He was so
enthusiastic about his studies; he really liked both
his subjects and learning in general. Don't you agree,
Mark?
"Listen Phil, I told you not to get any onions
with my hamburger. You know what they do to my
breath. And by the way—will you get rid of that
damn polar bear outfit? It's cluttering up the
room!"
