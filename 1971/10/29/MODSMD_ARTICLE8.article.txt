# 'Suspension In Paradise': A Fable For Our Time
## 
### 
This is a fable. Pure fantasy.
Any resemblence to any creature,
divine or mortal, living or dead, is
surely a figment of the reader's
overworked imagination.
* * *
The Angel Gabriel sat at the
foot of the long mahogony and
alabaster table, chewing on a stick
of ambrosia and thinking about
the past. While he could see the
future as clearly as you or I can
see ourselves in the bathroom
mirror, he prefered the past. A
smart angel was Gabriel. No fool
he.
To his right was Angel Moses,
destined to pull special
assignments one place or another
for the duration of this particular
Universe. To his left was Peter,
Provost and Head of the
Accounting Division.
The remainder of the fifteen
seats were occupied by various
department heads, administrators,
the Director of the Celestial
Choir, the Director of Mortals,
and such. Representatives from
neighboring universes sat in rows
of velvet-line chairs hastily
arranged along the walls.
It was a small conference room
for such a respected Universe, but
no one had anticipated the
interest generated by the
essentially internal affair.
The air was filled with the
scent of sweet incense and myrrh.
Attending cherubim scuttled
about silently, emptying censers
and filling chalices.
The Deity entered, as was its
wont, as a pillar of fire. It
meandered its way to the front of
the room, jostling into a lamp
stand along the way. The scent of

scorched mahogony mixed briefly
with the myrrh.
The pillar paused before the
leather-lined swivel chair at the
head of the table, huffed a bit,
and slowly materialized into a
small, dark woman in a tweed
skirt and a cream-colored blouse.
An embarrassed hush settled
upon the room as the young lady
searched in her hand-bag,
produced a comb, a pack of
Sandlewoods, two tissues, a
key-ring, and in ultimum, a small
blue notebook.
Opening the notebook, she
leafed through the sheets,
scratched her head, clucked
silently to herself. It was her turn
to be embarrased.
"I beg your pardon," she said
quietly. "Wrong attribute."
The pillar slowly reassembled
itself, and materialized into a
short, thin man, slightly bald,
wearing steel-rimmed glasses,
dressed in a gray suit with a black
bow-tie.
"Ah, that's better," he said.
"Sorry gentlemen for the delay.
Shall we proceed?"
The President of the Universe
settled into his leather chair,
reached for the pack of
Sandlewoods still sitting on the
table, drew a stick and placed it
between his teeth. A cherub
scurried over with a light, but
before he reached the head of the
table, the stick glowed into life.
The President glanced slyly
around the room, assaying the
effects of this little gambit on the
distinguished guests.
The cherub, confused, began to
backtrack. The President sighed,
and the comb, tissues and key-ring

disappeared from the table. The
cherub also disappeared.
Gabriel grumbled with
impatience. He was getting tired
of the same rotten trick, every
time they had visitors. Moses, as
ever, remained impassive. There
was a time for emotion, and a
time for control.
"Well," said the President,

for setting a precedent of
removing tenured angels without
giving it the most serious thought.
But, in our opinion, the behavior
of Angel Lucifer posed a direct
and immediate threat to the
security of this Universe, and
drastic measures were in order."
"What did he do?" whispered
one of the distinguished guests,

ON THE BRINK

"let's go. John, what's the story?"
John, Administrative Angel in
Charge of Security, rose and
addressed the room.
"Mr. President, if I may briefly
review the facts of this case before
reading the decision of the
Advisory Board, for the sake of
our visitors?
"In this Universe, gentlemen,
we operate on the principle of
Noblesse Oblige. To be a member
of the Heavenly Retinue is a
privilege not lightly bestowed.
Once granted, it is virtually
sacred. Very rarely is a tenured
angel removed from his position.
"However, the behavior of
Angel Lucifer is of such a serious,
and potentially disasterous,
consequence to the Heavenly
Host, that the President deemed it
advisable to consider removing
Lucifer permanently from the
Heavenly Presence.
"Consequently, in accordance
with the Laws of the Universe, an
Advisory Board of senior and
respected angels was ■established
to review the case of Angel
Lucifer and recommend to the
President a just and appropriate
resolution to this matter.
"As you are all aware,
gentlemen, we approached this
affair with great reluctance.
Nobody wants to be responsible

perhaps a bit too loud.
"He tried to play God!"
snapped the President of the
Universe.
"Angel Lucifer," said the
Administrative Angel in Charge of
Security, "incited and encouraged
insurrection among the Heavenly
Host, particularly the junior
members. He observed to
encourage disrespect to Heavenly
Institutions, and has played a
leading role in the violent dissent
to Heavenly Rule.
"He has been particularly active
in inciting cherubim to disruption
and violence. Millions of
main-sequence stars, many of
them containing planetary
systems, were subjected to
extraordinary perturbations.
Untold damage occured, at
tremendous cost to this Universe.
The situation, I assure you
gentlemen, was untenable."
A sympathetic murmer arose
from the distinguished guests
seated in the velvet chairs.
Definitely a dangerous situation.
But if a tenured angel were to be
banished by such a distinguished

Universe, would that not set an
even more dangerous precedent?
"Mr. President," continued the
Angel in Charge of Security, "the
decision of the Advisory Board is
contained in this envelope. If it
pleases your Serene Dignity, and
the other members of this
distinguished panel, I will ask
Angel Lucifer to appear, in order
that he may confront Your
Radiance when the decision is
read."
The President gravely nodded
ascent, and a cherub was
dispatched to fetch the falling
Angel.
Lucifer, ever the iconoclast,
appeared dressed for this solemn
occassion in a black turtle-neck
sweater, brown courdoroy pants,
and a motorcycle belt. Pinned
above his left breast uas a bright
red button bearing the image of a
black pitchfork.
"Kisht mir in tuchos," said
Lucifer, raising his hand in the
Satanic salute.
"What's that?" whispered a
distinguished guest, again a bit too
loud.
"That's Hebrew," answered the
Director of Mortals.
"What's Hebrew?" asked the
distinguished guest.
"Hebrew," said the Director of
Special Projects, "is a language
under development in my
Department for the purpose of
recording the progress of the
President's next Special Project,
which he is preparing in his
attribute of Creator. Angel
Lucifer's Special Attribute for this
project was Associate Professor of
Hebrew."
"Pig Hebrew!," snorted
Lucifer. "Jerks. Chob dir in bot!"
"Angel Lucifer," warned the
Angel in Charge of Security, "if
you cannot contain yourself, I
shall be forced to ask the
Seraph-at-Arms to maintain

order."
"Pacem," growled the Seraph
gratuitously.
"Mr. President," continued the
Angel in Charge of Security, "I
shall now open the envelope
containing the decision of the
Special Advisory Board for
Celestial Affairs."
The Angel in Charge of
Security searched in his portfolio
and produced a large, brown
manila envelope with the
Heavenly Seal emblazoned on the
flap. The President glared at the
envelope, which promptly
evaporated, leaving a single sheet
of parchment in the Angel's hand.
"Let's get this damned
nonsense over with," grumbled
the President.
The Angel in Charge of
Security, who had begun to sweat
just a bit, cleared his throat, and
read:
"To the President of the
Universe: We, the Special
Advisory Board for Celestial
Affairs, having reviewed the
charges brought by your Celestial
Administration concerning the
alleged disruptive and scandalous
behavior of Angel Lucifer, have
considered and reached the
following decision.
"It is our unanimous opinion
that Angel Lucifer has indeed
fomented disruption and dissent
in this Universe. However,
disruption and dissent are not in
and of themselves evil. In fact,

they make this Universe, on the
whole, a more interesting place to
pass Eternity.
"Nevertheless, propriety and
order also have their station. We
recommend that Angel Lucifer be
suspended from his duties for a
period of three eons, and that he
be remitted to an appropriate
location for the duration of his
suspension."
"So be it," growled the
President, obviously a bit relieved.
"It's about time we were done
with all this. Should be suspended
from his toes, not his duties."
At which the President
ascended as a pillar of fire and
stalked from the room.
"To hell with you," screamed
Lucifer, waving a little red book
with a pitchfork engraved on the
cover.
"To Hell with you, my son!"
responded a heavenly voice, at
which Lucifer disappeared in a
puff of sulfur.
"Pacem!" roared the
Seraph-at-Arms.
"Oh, Christ!" muttered
Gabriel, "Here we go!"
This is a fable. Pure fantasy.

divine or mortal, living or dead, is
surely a figment of the reader's

backtrack. The President sighed,
and the comb, tissues and key-ring

disappeared from the table. The
cherub also disappeared.
Gabriel grumbled with
impatience. He was getting tired
of the same rotten trick, every
time they had visitors. Moses, as
ever, remained impassive. There
was a time for emotion, and a
time for control.
"Well," said the President,

for setting a precedent of
removing tenured angels without
giving it the most serious thought.
But, in our opinion, the behavior
of Angel Lucifer posed a direct
and immediate threat to the
security of this Universe, and
drastic measures were in order."
"What did he do?" whispered
one of the distinguished guests,

ON THE BRINK

"let's go. John, what's the story?"
John, Administrative Angel in
Charge of Security, rose and
addressed the room.
"Mr. President, if I may briefly
review the facts of this case before
reading the decision of the
Advisory Board, for the sake of
our visitors?
"In this Universe, gentlemen,
we operate on the principle of
Noblesse Oblige. To be a member
of the Heavenly Retinue is a
privilege not lightly bestowed.
Once granted, it is virtually
sacred. Very rarely is a tenured
angel removed from his position.
"However, the behavior of
Angel Lucifer is of such a serious,
and potentially disasterous,
consequence to the Heavenly
Host, that the President deemed it
advisable to consider removing
Lucifer permanently from the
Heavenly Presence.
"Consequently, in accordance
with the Laws of the Universe, an
Advisory Board of senior and
respected angels was ■established
to review the case of Angel
Lucifer and recommend to the
President a just and appropriate
resolution to this matter.
"As you are all aware,
gentlemen, we approached this
affair with great reluctance.
Nobody wants to be responsible

perhaps a bit too loud.
"He tried to play God!"
snapped the President of the
Universe.
"Angel Lucifer," said the
Administrative Angel in Charge of
Security, "incited and encouraged
insurrection among the Heavenly
Host, particularly the junior
members. He observed to
encourage disrespect to Heavenly
Institutions, and has played a
leading role in the violent dissent
to Heavenly Rule.
"He has been particularly active
in inciting cherubim to disruption
and violence. Millions of
main-sequence stars, many of
them containing planetary
systems, were subjected to
extraordinary perturbations.
Untold damage occured, at
tremendous cost to this Universe.
The situation, I assure you
gentlemen, was untenable."
A sympathetic murmer arose
from the distinguished guests
seated in the velvet chairs.
Definitely a dangerous situation.
But if a tenured angel were to be
banished by such a distinguished

Universe, would that not set an
even more dangerous precedent?
"Mr. President," continued the
Angel in Charge of Security, "the
decision of the Advisory Board is
contained in this envelope. If it
pleases your Serene Dignity, and
the other members of this
distinguished panel, I will ask
Angel Lucifer to appear, in order
that he may confront Your
Radiance when the decision is
read."
The President gravely nodded
ascent, and a cherub was
dispatched to fetch the falling
Angel.
Lucifer, ever the iconoclast,
appeared dressed for this solemn
occassion in a black turtle-neck
sweater, brown courdoroy pants,
and a motorcycle belt. Pinned
above his left breast uas a bright
red button bearing the image of a
black pitchfork.
"Kisht mir in tuchos," said
Lucifer, raising his hand in the
Satanic salute.
"What's that?" whispered a
distinguished guest, again a bit too
loud.
"That's Hebrew," answered the
Director of Mortals.
"What's Hebrew?" asked the
distinguished guest.
"Hebrew," said the Director of
Special Projects, "is a language
under development in my
Department for the purpose of
recording the progress of the
President's next Special Project,
which he is preparing in his
attribute of Creator. Angel
Lucifer's Special Attribute for this
project was Associate Professor of
Hebrew."
"Pig Hebrew!," snorted
Lucifer. "Jerks. Chob dir in bot!"
"Angel Lucifer," warned the
Angel in Charge of Security, "if
you cannot contain yourself, I
shall be forced to ask the
Seraph-at-Arms to maintain

order."
"Pacem," growled the Seraph
gratuitously.
"Mr. President," continued the
Angel in Charge of Security, "I
shall now open the envelope
containing the decision of the
Special Advisory Board for
Celestial Affairs."
The Angel in Charge of
Security searched in his portfolio
and produced a large, brown
manila envelope with the
Heavenly Seal emblazoned on the
flap. The President glared at the
envelope, which promptly
evaporated, leaving a single sheet
of parchment in the Angel's hand.
"Let's get this damned
nonsense over with," grumbled
the President.
The Angel in Charge of
Security, who had begun to sweat
just a bit, cleared his throat, and
read:
"To the President of the
Universe: We, the Special
Advisory Board for Celestial
Affairs, having reviewed the
charges brought by your Celestial
Administration concerning the
alleged disruptive and scandalous
behavior of Angel Lucifer, have
considered and reached the
following decision.
"It is our unanimous opinion
that Angel Lucifer has indeed
fomented disruption and dissent
in this Universe. However,
disruption and dissent are not in
and of themselves evil. In fact,

they make this Universe, on the
whole, a more interesting place to
pass Eternity.
"Nevertheless, propriety and
order also have their station. We
recommend that Angel Lucifer be
suspended from his duties for a
period of three eons, and that he
be remitted to an appropriate
location for the duration of his
suspension."
"So be it," growled the
President, obviously a bit relieved.
"It's about time we were done
with all this. Should be suspended
from his toes, not his duties."
At which the President
ascended as a pillar of fire and
stalked from the room.
"To hell with you," screamed
Lucifer, waving a little red book
with a pitchfork engraved on the
cover.
"To Hell with you, my son!"
responded a heavenly voice, at
which Lucifer disappeared in a
puff of sulfur.
"Pacem!" roared the
Seraph-at-Arms.
"Oh, Christ!" muttered
Gabriel, "Here we go!"
This is a fable. Pure fantasy.
Any resemblence to any creature,
divine or mortal, living or dead, is
surely a figment of the reader's
overworked imagination.
* * *
The Angel Gabriel sat at the
foot of the long mahogony and
alabaster table, chewing on a stick
of ambrosia and thinking about
the past. While he could see the
future as clearly as you or I can
see ourselves in the bathroom
mirror, he prefered the past. A
smart angel was Gabriel. No fool
he.
To his right was Angel Moses,
destined to pull special
assignments one place or another
for the duration of this particular
Universe. To his left was Peter,
Provost and Head of the
Accounting Division.
The remainder of the fifteen
seats were occupied by various
department heads, administrators,
the Director of the Celestial
Choir, the Director of Mortals,
and such. Representatives from
neighboring universes sat in rows
of velvet-line chairs hastily
arranged along the walls.
It was a small conference room
for such a respected Universe, but
no one had anticipated the
interest generated by the
essentially internal affair.
The air was filled with the
scent of sweet incense and myrrh.
Attending cherubim scuttled
about silently, emptying censers
and filling chalices.
The Deity entered, as was its
wont, as a pillar of fire. It
meandered its way to the front of
the room, jostling into a lamp
stand along the way. The scent of

scorched mahogony mixed briefly
with the myrrh.
The pillar paused before the
leather-lined swivel chair at the
head of the table, huffed a bit,
and slowly materialized into a
small, dark woman in a tweed
skirt and a cream-colored blouse.
An embarrassed hush settled
upon the room as the young lady
searched in her hand-bag,
produced a comb, a pack of
Sandlewoods, two tissues, a
key-ring, and in ultimum, a small
blue notebook.
Opening the notebook, she
leafed through the sheets,
scratched her head, clucked
silently to herself. It was her turn
to be embarrased.
"I beg your pardon," she said
quietly. "Wrong attribute."
The pillar slowly reassembled
itself, and materialized into a
short, thin man, slightly bald,
wearing steel-rimmed glasses,
dressed in a gray suit with a black
bow-tie.
"Ah, that's better," he said.
"Sorry gentlemen for the delay.
Shall we proceed?"
The President of the Universe
settled into his leather chair,
reached for the pack of
Sandlewoods still sitting on the
table, drew a stick and placed it
between his teeth. A cherub
scurried over with a light, but
before he reached the head of the
table, the stick glowed into life.
The President glanced slyly
around the room, assaying the
effects of this little gambit on the
distinguished guests.
The cherub, confused, began to
backtrack. The President sighed,
and the comb, tissues and key-ring

disappeared from the table. The
cherub also disappeared.

distinguished panel, I will ask
Angel Lucifer to appear, in order
that he may confront Your
Radiance when the decision is
read."
The President gravely nodded
ascent, and a cherub was
dispatched to fetch the falling
Angel.
Lucifer, ever the iconoclast,
appeared dressed for this solemn
occassion in a black turtle-neck
sweater, brown courdoroy pants,
and a motorcycle belt. Pinned
above his left breast uas a bright
red button bearing the image of a
black pitchfork.
"Kisht mir in tuchos," said
Lucifer, raising his hand in the
Satanic salute.
"What's that?" whispered a
distinguished guest, again a bit too
loud.
"That's Hebrew," answered the
Director of Mortals.
"What's Hebrew?" asked the
distinguished guest.
"Hebrew," said the Director of
Special Projects, "is a language
under development in my
Department for the purpose of
recording the progress of the
President's next Special Project,
which he is preparing in his
attribute of Creator. Angel
Lucifer's Special Attribute for this
project was Associate Professor of
Hebrew."
"Pig Hebrew!," snorted
Lucifer. "Jerks. Chob dir in bot!"
"Angel Lucifer," warned the
Angel in Charge of Security, "if
you cannot contain yourself, I
shall be forced to ask the
Seraph-at-Arms to maintain

order."
"Pacem," growled the Seraph
gratuitously.
"Mr. President," continued the
Angel in Charge of Security, "I
shall now open the envelope
containing the decision of the
Special Advisory Board for
Celestial Affairs."
The Angel in Charge of
Security searched in his portfolio
and produced a large, brown
manila envelope with the
Heavenly Seal emblazoned on the
flap. The President glared at the
envelope, which promptly
evaporated, leaving a single sheet
of parchment in the Angel's hand.
"Let's get this damned
nonsense over with," grumbled
the President.
The Angel in Charge of
Security, who had begun to sweat
just a bit, cleared his throat, and
read:
"To the President of the
Universe: We, the Special
Advisory Board for Celestial
Affairs, having reviewed the
charges brought by your Celestial
Administration concerning the
alleged disruptive and scandalous
behavior of Angel Lucifer, have
considered and reached the
following decision.
"It is our unanimous opinion
that Angel Lucifer has indeed
fomented disruption and dissent
in this Universe. However,
disruption and dissent are not in
and of themselves evil. In fact,

they make this Universe, on the
whole, a more interesting place to
pass Eternity.
"Nevertheless, propriety and
order also have their station. We
recommend that Angel Lucifer be
suspended from his duties for a
period of three eons, and that he
be remitted to an appropriate
location for the duration of his
suspension."
"So be it," growled the
President, obviously a bit relieved.
"It's about time we were done
with all this. Should be suspended
from his toes, not his duties."
At which the President
ascended as a pillar of fire and
stalked from the room.
"To hell with you," screamed
Lucifer, waving a little red book
with a pitchfork engraved on the
cover.
"To Hell with you, my son!"
responded a heavenly voice, at
which Lucifer disappeared in a
puff of sulfur.
"Pacem!" roared the
Seraph-at-Arms.
"Oh, Christ!" muttered
Gabriel, "Here we go!"
This is a fable. Pure fantasy.
Any resemblence to any creature,
divine or mortal, living or dead, is
surely a figment of the reader's
overworked imagination.
* * *
The Angel Gabriel sat at the
foot of the long mahogony and
alabaster table, chewing on a stick
of ambrosia and thinking about
the past. While he could see the
future as clearly as you or I can
see ourselves in the bathroom
mirror, he prefered the past. A
smart angel was Gabriel. No fool
he.
To his right was Angel Moses,
destined to pull special
assignments one place or another
for the duration of this particular
Universe. To his left was Peter,
Provost and Head of the
Accounting Division.
The remainder of the fifteen
seats were occupied by various
department heads, administrators,
the Director of the Celestial
Choir, the Director of Mortals,
and such. Representatives from
neighboring universes sat in rows
of velvet-line chairs hastily
arranged along the walls.
It was a small conference room
for such a respected Universe, but
no one had anticipated the
interest generated by the
essentially internal affair.
The air was filled with the
scent of sweet incense and myrrh.
Attending cherubim scuttled
about silently, emptying censers
and filling chalices.
The Deity entered, as was its
wont, as a pillar of fire. It
meandered its way to the front of
the room, jostling into a lamp
stand along the way. The scent of

scorched mahogony mixed briefly
with the myrrh.
The pillar paused before the
leather-lined swivel chair at the
head of the table, huffed a bit,
and slowly materialized into a
small, dark woman in a tweed
skirt and a cream-colored blouse.
An embarrassed hush settled
upon the room as the young lady
searched in her hand-bag,
produced a comb, a pack of
Sandlewoods, two tissues, a
key-ring, and in ultimum, a small
blue notebook.
Opening the notebook, she
leafed through the sheets,
scratched her head, clucked
silently to herself. It was her turn
to be embarrased.
"I beg your pardon," she said
quietly. "Wrong attribute."
The pillar slowly reassembled
itself, and materialized into a
short, thin man, slightly bald,
wearing steel-rimmed glasses,
dressed in a gray suit with a black
bow-tie.
"Ah, that's better," he said.
"Sorry gentlemen for the delay.
Shall we proceed?"
The President of the Universe
settled into his leather chair,
reached for the pack of
Sandlewoods still sitting on the
table, drew a stick and placed it
between his teeth. A cherub
scurried over with a light, but
before he reached the head of the
table, the stick glowed into life.
The President glanced slyly
around the room, assaying the
effects of this little gambit on the
distinguished guests.
The cherub, confused, began to
backtrack. The President sighed,
and the comb, tissues and key-ring

disappeared from the table. The
cherub also disappeared.
Gabriel grumbled with
impatience. He was getting tired
of the same rotten trick, every
time they had visitors. Moses, as
ever, remained impassive. There
was a time for emotion, and a
time for control.
"Well," said the President,

for setting a precedent of
removing tenured angels without
giving it the most serious thought.
But, in our opinion, the behavior
of Angel Lucifer posed a direct
and immediate threat to the
security of this Universe, and
drastic measures were in order."
"What did he do?" whispered
one of the distinguished guests,

ON THE BRINK

"let's go. John, what's the story?"
John, Administrative Angel in
Charge of Security, rose and
addressed the room.
"Mr. President, if I may briefly
review the facts of this case before
reading the decision of the
Advisory Board, for the sake of
our visitors?
"In this Universe, gentlemen,
we operate on the principle of
Noblesse Oblige. To be a member
of the Heavenly Retinue is a
privilege not lightly bestowed.
Once granted, it is virtually
sacred. Very rarely is a tenured
angel removed from his position.
"However, the behavior of
Angel Lucifer is of such a serious,
and potentially disasterous,
consequence to the Heavenly
Host, that the President deemed it
advisable to consider removing
Lucifer permanently from the
Heavenly Presence.
"Consequently, in accordance
with the Laws of the Universe, an
Advisory Board of senior and
respected angels was ■established
to review the case of Angel
Lucifer and recommend to the
President a just and appropriate
resolution to this matter.
"As you are all aware,
gentlemen, we approached this
affair with great reluctance.
Nobody wants to be responsible

perhaps a bit too loud.
"He tried to play God!"
snapped the President of the
Universe.
"Angel Lucifer," said the
Administrative Angel in Charge of
Security, "incited and encouraged
insurrection among the Heavenly
Host, particularly the junior
members. He observed to
encourage disrespect to Heavenly
Institutions, and has played a
leading role in the violent dissent
to Heavenly Rule.
"He has been particularly active
in inciting cherubim to disruption
and violence. Millions of
main-sequence stars, many of
them containing planetary
systems, were subjected to
extraordinary perturbations.
Untold damage occured, at
tremendous cost to this Universe.
The situation, I assure you
gentlemen, was untenable."
A sympathetic murmer arose
from the distinguished guests
seated in the velvet chairs.
Definitely a dangerous situation.
But if a tenured angel were to be
banished by such a distinguished

Universe, would that not set an
even more dangerous precedent?
"Mr. President," continued the
Angel in Charge of Security, "the
decision of the Advisory Board is
contained in this envelope. If it

the other members of this

with all this. Should be suspended
from his toes, not his duties."
At which the President
ascended as a pillar of fire and
stalked from the room.
"To hell with you," screamed
Lucifer, waving a little red book
with a pitchfork engraved on the
cover.
"To Hell with you, my son!"
responded a heavenly voice, at
which Lucifer disappeared in a
puff of sulfur.
"Pacem!" roared the
Seraph-at-Arms.
"Oh, Christ!" muttered
Gabriel, "Here we go!"
This is a fable. Pure fantasy.
Any resemblence to any creature,
divine or mortal, living or dead, is
surely a figment of the reader's
overworked imagination.

The Angel Gabriel sat at the
foot of the long mahogony and
alabaster table, chewing on a stick
of ambrosia and thinking about
the past. While he could see the
future as clearly as you or I can
see ourselves in the bathroom
mirror, he prefered the past. A
smart angel was Gabriel. No fool
he.
To his right was Angel Moses,
destined to pull special
assignments one place or another
for the duration of this particular
Universe. To his left was Peter,
Provost and Head of the
Accounting Division.
The remainder of the fifteen
seats were occupied by various
department heads, administrators,
the Director of the Celestial
Choir, the Director of Mortals,
and such. Representatives from
neighboring universes sat in rows
of velvet-line chairs hastily
arranged along the walls.
It was a small conference room
for such a respected Universe, but
no one had anticipated the
interest generated by the
essentially internal affair.
The air was filled with the
scent of sweet incense and myrrh.
Attending cherubim scuttled
about silently, emptying censers
and filling chalices.
The Deity entered, as was its
wont, as a pillar of fire. It
meandered its way to the front of
the room, jostling into a lamp
stand along the way. The scent of

scorched mahogony mixed briefly
with the myrrh.
The pillar paused before the
leather-lined swivel chair at the
head of the table, huffed a bit,
and slowly materialized into a
small, dark woman in a tweed
skirt and a cream-colored blouse.
An embarrassed hush settled
upon the room as the young lady
searched in her hand-bag,
produced a comb, a pack of
Sandlewoods, two tissues, a
key-ring, and in ultimum, a small
blue notebook.
Opening the notebook, she
leafed through the sheets,
scratched her head, clucked
silently to herself. It was her turn
to be embarrased.
"I beg your pardon," she said
quietly. "Wrong attribute."
The pillar slowly reassembled
itself, and materialized into a
short, thin man, slightly bald,
wearing steel-rimmed glasses,
dressed in a gray suit with a black
bow-tie.
"Ah, that's better," he said.
"Sorry gentlemen for the delay.
Shall we proceed?"
The President of the Universe
settled into his leather chair,
reached for the pack of
Sandlewoods still sitting on the
table, drew a stick and placed it
between his teeth. A cherub
scurried over with a light, but
before he reached the head of the
table, the stick glowed into life.
The President glanced slyly
around the room, assaying the
effects of this little gambit on the
distinguished guests.
The cherub, confused, began to
backtrack. The President sighed,
and the comb, tissues and key-ring

disappeared from the table. The
cherub also disappeared.
Gabriel grumbled with
impatience. He was getting tired
of the same rotten trick, every
time they had visitors. Moses, as
ever, remained impassive. There
was a time for emotion, and a
time for control.
"Well," said the President,

for setting a precedent of
removing tenured angels without
giving it the most serious thought.
But, in our opinion, the behavior
of Angel Lucifer posed a direct
and immediate threat to the
security of this Universe, and
drastic measures were in order."
"What did he do?" whispered
one of the distinguished guests,

ON THE BRINK

"let's go. John, what's the story?"
John, Administrative Angel in
Charge of Security, rose and
addressed the room.
"Mr. President, if I may briefly
review the facts of this case before
reading the decision of the
Advisory Board, for the sake of
our visitors?
"In this Universe, gentlemen,
we operate on the principle of
Noblesse Oblige. To be a member
of the Heavenly Retinue is a
privilege not lightly bestowed.
Once granted, it is virtually
sacred. Very rarely is a tenured
angel removed from his position.
"However, the behavior of
Angel Lucifer is of such a serious,
and potentially disasterous,
consequence to the Heavenly
Host, that the President deemed it
advisable to consider removing
Lucifer permanently from the
Heavenly Presence.
"Consequently, in accordance
with the Laws of the Universe, an
Advisory Board of senior and
respected angels was ■established
to review the case of Angel
Lucifer and recommend to the
President a just and appropriate
resolution to this matter.
"As you are all aware,
gentlemen, we approached this
affair with great reluctance.
Nobody wants to be responsible

perhaps a bit too loud.
"He tried to play God!"
snapped the President of the
Universe.
"Angel Lucifer," said the
Administrative Angel in Charge of
Security, "incited and encouraged
insurrection among the Heavenly
Host, particularly the junior
members. He observed to
encourage disrespect to Heavenly
Institutions, and has played a
leading role in the violent dissent
to Heavenly Rule.
"He has been particularly active
in inciting cherubim to disruption
and violence. Millions of
main-sequence stars, many of
them containing planetary
systems, were subjected to
extraordinary perturbations.
Untold damage occured, at
tremendous cost to this Universe.
The situation, I assure you
gentlemen, was untenable."
A sympathetic murmer arose
from the distinguished guests
seated in the velvet chairs.
Definitely a dangerous situation.
But if a tenured angel were to be
banished by such a distinguished

Universe, would that not set an
even more dangerous precedent?
"Mr. President," continued the
Angel in Charge of Security, "the
decision of the Advisory Board is
contained in this envelope. If it
pleases your Serene Dignity, and
the other members of this
distinguished panel, I will ask
Angel Lucifer to appear, in order
that he may confront Your
Radiance when the decision is
read."
The President gravely nodded
ascent, and a cherub was
dispatched to fetch the falling
Angel.
Lucifer, ever the iconoclast,
appeared dressed for this solemn
occassion in a black turtle-neck
sweater, brown courdoroy pants,
and a motorcycle belt. Pinned
above his left breast uas a bright
red button bearing the image of a
black pitchfork.
"Kisht mir in tuchos," said
Lucifer, raising his hand in the
Satanic salute.
"What's that?" whispered a
distinguished guest, again a bit too
loud.
"That's Hebrew," answered the
Director of Mortals.
"What's Hebrew?" asked the
distinguished guest.
"Hebrew," said the Director of
Special Projects, "is a language
under development in my
Department for the purpose of
recording the progress of the
President's next Special Project,
which he is preparing in his
attribute of Creator. Angel
Lucifer's Special Attribute for this
project was Associate Professor of
Hebrew."
"Pig Hebrew!," snorted
Lucifer. "Jerks. Chob dir in bot!"
"Angel Lucifer," warned the
Angel in Charge of Security, "if
you cannot contain yourself, I
shall be forced to ask the
Seraph-at-Arms to maintain

order."
"Pacem," growled the Seraph
gratuitously.
"Mr. President," continued the
Angel in Charge of Security, "I
shall now open the envelope
containing the decision of the
Special Advisory Board for
Celestial Affairs."
The Angel in Charge of
Security searched in his portfolio
and produced a large, brown
manila envelope with the
Heavenly Seal emblazoned on the
flap. The President glared at the
envelope, which promptly
evaporated, leaving a single sheet
of parchment in the Angel's hand.
"Let's get this damned
nonsense over with," grumbled
the President.
The Angel in Charge of
Security, who had begun to sweat
just a bit, cleared his throat, and
read:
"To the President of the
Universe: We, the Special
Advisory Board for Celestial
Affairs, having reviewed the
charges brought by your Celestial
Administration concerning the
alleged disruptive and scandalous
behavior of Angel Lucifer, have
considered and reached the
following decision.
"It is our unanimous opinion
that Angel Lucifer has indeed
fomented disruption and dissent
in this Universe. However,
disruption and dissent are not in
and of themselves evil. In fact,

they make this Universe, on the
whole, a more interesting place to
pass Eternity.
"Nevertheless, propriety and
order also have their station. We
recommend that Angel Lucifer be
suspended from his duties for a
period of three eons, and that he
be remitted to an appropriate
location for the duration of his
suspension."
"So be it," growled the
President, obviously a bit relieved.
"It's about time we were done
with all this. Should be suspended
from his toes, not his duties."
At which the President
ascended as a pillar of fire and

"Sorry gentlemen for the delay.
Shall we proceed?"
The President of the Universe
settled into his leather chair,
reached for the pack of
Sandlewoods still sitting on the
table, drew a stick and placed it
between his teeth. A cherub
scurried over with a light, but
before he reached the head of the
table, the stick glowed into life.
The President glanced slyly
around the room, assaying the
effects of this little gambit on the
distinguished guests.
The cherub, confused, began to
backtrack. The President sighed,
and the comb, tissues and key-ring

disappeared from the table. The
cherub also disappeared.
Gabriel grumbled with
impatience. He was getting tired
of the same rotten trick, every
time they had visitors. Moses, as
ever, remained impassive. There
was a time for emotion, and a
time for control.
"Well," said the President,

for setting a precedent of
removing tenured angels without
giving it the most serious thought.
But, in our opinion, the behavior
of Angel Lucifer posed a direct
and immediate threat to the
security of this Universe, and
drastic measures were in order."
"What did he do?" whispered
one of the distinguished guests,

ON THE BRINK

"let's go. John, what's the story?"
John, Administrative Angel in
Charge of Security, rose and
addressed the room.
"Mr. President, if I may briefly
review the facts of this case before
reading the decision of the
Advisory Board, for the sake of
our visitors?
"In this Universe, gentlemen,
we operate on the principle of
Noblesse Oblige. To be a member
of the Heavenly Retinue is a
privilege not lightly bestowed.
Once granted, it is virtually
sacred. Very rarely is a tenured
angel removed from his position.
"However, the behavior of
Angel Lucifer is of such a serious,
and potentially disasterous,
consequence to the Heavenly
Host, that the President deemed it
advisable to consider removing
Lucifer permanently from the
Heavenly Presence.
"Consequently, in accordance
with the Laws of the Universe, an
Advisory Board of senior and
respected angels was ■established
to review the case of Angel
Lucifer and recommend to the
President a just and appropriate
resolution to this matter.
"As you are all aware,
gentlemen, we approached this
affair with great reluctance.
Nobody wants to be responsible

perhaps a bit too loud.
"He tried to play God!"
snapped the President of the
Universe.
"Angel Lucifer," said the
Administrative Angel in Charge of
Security, "incited and encouraged
insurrection among the Heavenly
Host, particularly the junior
members. He observed to
encourage disrespect to Heavenly
Institutions, and has played a
leading role in the violent dissent
to Heavenly Rule.
"He has been particularly active
in inciting cherubim to disruption
and violence. Millions of
main-sequence stars, many of
them containing planetary
systems, were subjected to
extraordinary perturbations.
Untold damage occured, at
tremendous cost to this Universe.
The situation, I assure you
gentlemen, was untenable."
A sympathetic murmer arose
from the distinguished guests
seated in the velvet chairs.
Definitely a dangerous situation.
But if a tenured angel were to be
banished by such a distinguished

Universe, would that not set an
even more dangerous precedent?
"Mr. President," continued the
Angel in Charge of Security, "the
decision of the Advisory Board is
contained in this envelope. If it
pleases your Serene Dignity, and
the other members of this
distinguished panel, I will ask
Angel Lucifer to appear, in order
that he may confront Your
Radiance when the decision is
read."
The President gravely nodded
ascent, and a cherub was
dispatched to fetch the falling
Angel.
Lucifer, ever the iconoclast,
appeared dressed for this solemn
occassion in a black turtle-neck
sweater, brown courdoroy pants,
and a motorcycle belt. Pinned
above his left breast uas a bright
red button bearing the image of a
black pitchfork.
"Kisht mir in tuchos," said
Lucifer, raising his hand in the
Satanic salute.
"What's that?" whispered a
distinguished guest, again a bit too
loud.
"That's Hebrew," answered the
Director of Mortals.
"What's Hebrew?" asked the
distinguished guest.
"Hebrew," said the Director of
Special Projects, "is a language
under development in my
Department for the purpose of
recording the progress of the
President's next Special Project,
which he is preparing in his
attribute of Creator. Angel
Lucifer's Special Attribute for this
project was Associate Professor of
Hebrew."
"Pig Hebrew!," snorted
Lucifer. "Jerks. Chob dir in bot!"
"Angel Lucifer," warned the
Angel in Charge of Security, "if
you cannot contain yourself, I
shall be forced to ask the
Seraph-at-Arms to maintain

order."
"Pacem," growled the Seraph
gratuitously.
"Mr. President," continued the
Angel in Charge of Security, "I
shall now open the envelope
containing the decision of the
Special Advisory Board for
Celestial Affairs."
The Angel in Charge of
Security searched in his portfolio
and produced a large, brown
manila envelope with the
Heavenly Seal emblazoned on the
flap. The President glared at the
envelope, which promptly
evaporated, leaving a single sheet
of parchment in the Angel's hand.
"Let's get this damned
nonsense over with," grumbled
the President.
The Angel in Charge of
Security, who had begun to sweat
just a bit, cleared his throat, and
read:
"To the President of the
Universe: We, the Special
Advisory Board for Celestial
Affairs, having reviewed the
charges brought by your Celestial
Administration concerning the
alleged disruptive and scandalous
behavior of Angel Lucifer, have
considered and reached the
following decision.
"It is our unanimous opinion
that Angel Lucifer has indeed
fomented disruption and dissent
in this Universe. However,
disruption and dissent are not in
and of themselves evil. In fact,

they make this Universe, on the
whole, a more interesting place to
pass Eternity.
"Nevertheless, propriety and
order also have their station. We
recommend that Angel Lucifer be
suspended from his duties for a
period of three eons, and that he
be remitted to an appropriate
location for the duration of his
suspension."
"So be it," growled the
President, obviously a bit relieved.
"It's about time we were done
with all this. Should be suspended
from his toes, not his duties."
At which the President
ascended as a pillar of fire and
stalked from the room.
"To hell with you," screamed
Lucifer, waving a little red book
with a pitchfork engraved on the
cover.
"To Hell with you, my son!"
responded a heavenly voice, at
which Lucifer disappeared in a
puff of sulfur.
"Pacem!" roared the
Seraph-at-Arms.
"Oh, Christ!" muttered
Gabriel, "Here we go!"
