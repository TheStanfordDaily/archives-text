## No Bureacracy

It is with restrained anger that
I reply to the charge made by Mr.
Steven Shevell (letter to the Daily,
Oct. 21), that the Committee on
Foreign Study Programs, and
more specifically the Italy campus
sub-committee have been
unresponsive to student opinions
about the programs at overseas
campuses.
TTiis assertion is uninformed
and quite unfair. It is insulting to
the faculty members of the
committee who have spent a great
many hours in earnest and open
consideration of the problems
involved in running foreign
campuses.
the point in regard to
Mr. Shevell, it is quite unfair to
the three student voting members
of the parent committee and two
student members of each of the
sub-committees, whose counsel
has been invaluable.
Does Mr. Shevell consider his
fellow students on the committees
to have been simply faculty
stooges, obsequious to what he
apparently considers to be
monolithic faculty opinion about
the running of the foreign
campuses?
Actually, every attempt has
been made by the committees to
solicit ideas and evaluations from
students who have been to one or
the other foreign campuses, and
to use consensus opinions as guide
lines for future development of
the programs. We would be fools
if we didn't; the best receipt for
the failure of the programs would
be to ignore student opinion.
Indeed last spring a
questionnaire was drawn up by
the Austria sub-committee and
circulated in the dormitories, in
order to obtain opinions from
students as to what they wanted
to get out of their experience at a
foreign campus. To assert that the
committees have been oblivious to
all of this student input is to
ignore changes and modifications
in the programs which have
already or will be put into effect
in the near future. It is also to
impugn the integrity of the many
people on the committees.
The specific case Mr. Shevell
cited in referring to the Italy
sub-committee, was one involving
a set of recommendations sent to
the committee by the Italy XXI
group.

These came at an extremely
busy moment for the committee
when we were considering several
particularly urgent matters and
when we received a visit from Mr.
Guelfa Frulla from the staff of the
Italy campus. We set these
recommendations aside for the
time being; we will certainly
consider them carefully when the
sub-committee reconvenes this
Fall.
I would conclude with the
observation that the Committee
on Foreign Study Programs does
need all of the student input it
can obtain but such
morale-depressing stuff as Mr.
Schevell has seen fit to publish
helps not one iota.
I suspect that the
chip-on-shoulder tone of the letter
rests on the simplistic and
stereotyped idea of an insulated
faculty bureaucracy (to use his
own word) smothering any
attempt of students to assess and
determine the nature of their own
education. At least in the case we
have spoken of, it simply isn't
true.
