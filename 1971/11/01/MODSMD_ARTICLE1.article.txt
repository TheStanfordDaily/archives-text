# Stanford Band Votes No Women Members

### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Women's liberation suffered a
set-back at the hands of the
Incomparable Stanford Band Friday
when the musicians voted 108-22 to
continue the present policy of not
allowing women.
The vote climaxed a week of band
politicking that included an open
forum discussion last Wednesday,
where plans for Friday's referendum
were formulated.
The vote results were released
Saturday to the Palo Alto Times,
according to one bandsman, in
retaliation for Friday's Daily story on
the supposedly-secret vote.
Apparently overlooked was the fact
that, since the Daily is not published on
weekends, the story could not have
appeared until today anyway.
Band Manager Dave Ruiz was
quoted as saying that the vote
precluded the admission of women for
at least the next year.
He said last week that those who
pushed for allowing women into the
band did so on a "moral basis. They
feel the band has no right to exclude
women. And in a way, I agree with
them. But now just isn't the right
time."
He cited the high cost of providing
separate facilities for men and women
as one of the overriding problems
involved.
According to several sources, it was
clear at the Wednesday meeting that
the resolution had little chance of
success. Besides the band itself,
members of the Dollies also expressed
opposition to the move.

According to Ruiz, the discusison
and vote was instigated at the request
of only three of the 178 bandsmen.
The band had originally wanted no
publicity for the vote because "we
didn't want some women's lib group
looking over our shoulder, saying,
'You're just a chauvinist pig group'."
