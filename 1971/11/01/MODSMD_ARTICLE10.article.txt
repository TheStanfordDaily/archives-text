## Black Draft Resistance

diane fields

Walter Collins is a 26 year old
activist in the Black liberation
movement. He was arrested in
November, 1970 to start serving a
five year sentence for refusal of
draft induction. The U.S.
Supreme Court had refused to
hear an appeal of his sentence 11
days before his arrest. His lawyers,

however, were preparing a
petition for reconsideration which
they had 25 days to file. Federal
authorities came to Collins' home,
handcuffed him, and refused to
allow him the normal procedure
of taking care of personal affairs
and then surrendering.
The issue of Collins' case is

whether all-white draft boards,
composed of members who live
outside the areas where Black
people live, have a right to draft
those Black men. The fact is that
there are many draft boards
operating like this throughout the
country. What is unusual about
Collins' case is that he had been
organizing throughout the South
and the country against racism,
war and the draft in particular.
The Southern Conference
Educational Fund (SCEF) has put
out a pamphlet on the Collins
case. It says in part: "As we call
the attention of government
officials and the public to the way
the draft system operated in the
Collins case, it becomes clear what
this system is doing to all black
men. If we can win Collins' case,
it can crack open the entire draft
system as it relates to Blacks. . .
"The draft system, like
everything else in this country is
blatantly racist. Ultimately racism
always means murderâ€”and
nowhere is this more evident than
in the draft, where the results are
that young men are sent to their
deaths. White Amerika must tear
the blinders off its eyes and look
at this situation and do what is
necessary to change."
Collins' mother, Mrs. Virginia
Collins, is presently speaking
before groups across the country,
to increase awareness of her son's
case in particular and Black draft
resisters in general.
Mrs. Collins and Carl Braden,
who is information Director and
Organizer of SCEF, will be at
Stanford today, at Tresidder
Large Lounge at 1:30 p.m. to
discuss the Walter Collins Case,
Black Draft Resistance and
Amnesty for Draft Resisters.
