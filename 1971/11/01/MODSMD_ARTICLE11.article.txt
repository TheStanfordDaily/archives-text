# cluster bomb
## Ingenious Device

When we picket the Placement
Center on Thursday we will be
protesting the use of Stanford
facilities by a company
responsible for some of the
cruelest atrocities committed in
Indochina. Honeywell, Inc., which
is recruiting Stanford students for
work in its war plants, is the 16th
largest producer of military
hardware in the naiion: among its
products is an ingenious device
that mutilates and kills human
beings en masse while leaving
walls, roads and bridges
unharmed.
This device, the "cluster
bomb," is packed with tiny steel
darts which saturate an area the
size of a football field on
explosion. Because they are
barbed, the darts tear the flesh as
they enter, making jagged, ugly
wounds. Well trained engineers
designed them especially to make
extraction difficult. The process
that begins in the neat, quiet
offices of the Placement Center
will end with screams and blood
in some village in Indochina.
Like napalm, white
phosphorous, and ' other
"anti-personnel" weapons, cluster
bombs are used in situations
where it is impossible to
distinguish between combatants

and civilians. So women, children,
old people-all those who cannot
readily flee—are tortured and
killed, or perhaps only crippled if
they are lucky.
The weapons that Honeywell
makes are not being used to
defend the United States, but to
impose a puppet government on
people 8,000 miles away, in a war
that is illegal according to both
the Nuremberg principles and the

laws of human decency. If
representatives of Honeywell wish
to exercise their right to free
speech on campus they should be
welcomed. But recruiting is not
speech; it is a vital part of
production. To permit Honeywell
to conduct its business here is to
acquiesce in a crime that equals
any in history in horror and
cruelty.

Women for Peace.)

used by the United States in Indochina. The tiny steel darts pierce
flesh, but not walls, and are barbed to make extraction difficult.
Honeywell Corporation, which is recruiting on campus this week,
makes similar components for their own cluster bomb.
