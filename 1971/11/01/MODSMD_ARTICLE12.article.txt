## Child Care Needs Support 
### 
children's center

Child care on this campus
is important to students as well
as staff and faculty. Seventy
eight students at Grove House
have demonstrated their recog
nition of its importance by con
tributing $1.00 per person to the
Children's Center of the Stan
ford Community since the ref
erendum was defeated.
We ask all Stanford students,
staff and faculty to do the same
or more tomorrow and

Wednesday of this week when we
will have a table at White Plaza
during the noon hour. This effort
will be successful if the 1400
students who voted for the child
care fee assessment in the last
week's ASSU elections will make
a gift and ask members of their
living group to contribute.
Although Stanford provides us
with a building and grounds
upkeep, we cannot continue to
fulfill the requirements of state
agencies on a fee structure which

students and many staff and
faculty can afford. Currently we
charge $.60 per hour with parent
participation at the Little Kids'
Place and between $52.50 to
$92.50 per month for 40 hour
week on ability-to-pay basis at
Day Care.
This is a community project,
with policies set by a board of
seven parents, who are student,
staff and faculty, elected annually
by all parents. This service is in
jeopardy if we cannot raise $3500

by the end of the quarter. We
cannot expand our operation nor
provide additional services which
are needed, since the referendum
for fee assessment did not pass.
We have learned by experience
because there were no experts
when we started in the fall of
1969. As a result we made
mistakes, but always managed to
provide a healthy safe
environment for children.
This past year fees accounted
for $32,700 and with a donation
of $2400, the operation lost
about $800. The place is well
managed. The permanent staff is
experienced and sensitive to the
needs of the children at the
Center. In addition, volunteers
help maintain a rich program.
Our operating funds are not
adequate to buy equipment, toys
or essential improvements to the
building. Although parents
voluntarily clean every weekend,
we do not have professional
equipment. We must have a
professional cleaning service once
or twice a month. We need toys,
books and records for children
ranging in age from 6 months to 5
years.
This is not a political game. It
is an essential community service,
being used by members of each
segment. We have worked hard,
learned from our experience and
been responsive to a need. The
Center deserves to survive. Come
to White Plaza at noon tomorrow
or Wednesday and make your
commitment. If you cannot make
it, send your check, payable to:
Children's Center of the Stanford
Community, Stanford, Ca. 94395

Day Care.
This is a community project,
with policies set by a board of
seven parents, who are student,
staff and faculty, elected annually
by all parents. This service is in
jeopardy if we cannot raise $3500

by the end of the quarter. We
cannot expand our operation nor
provide additional services which
are needed, since the referendum
for fee assessment did not pass.
We have learned by experience
because there were no experts
when we started in the fall of
1969. As a result we made
mistakes, but always managed to
provide a healthy safe
environment for children.
This past year fees accounted
for $32,700 and with a donation
of $2400, the operation lost
about $800. The place is well
managed. The permanent staff is
experienced and sensitive to the
needs of the children at the
Center. In addition, volunteers
help maintain a rich program.
Our operating funds are not
adequate to buy equipment, toys
or essential improvements to the
building. Although parents
voluntarily clean every weekend,
we do not have professional
equipment. We must have a
professional cleaning service once
or twice a month. We need toys,
books and records for children
ranging in age from 6 months to 5
years.
This is not a political game. It
is an essential community service,
being used by members of each
segment. We have worked hard,
learned from our experience and
been responsive to a need. The
Center deserves to survive. Come
to White Plaza at noon tomorrow
or Wednesday and make your
commitment. If you cannot make
it, send your check, payable to:
Children's Center of the Stanford
Community, Stanford, Ca. 94395
(Atten. P.N. Bryant).

children's center

Child care on this campus
is important to students as well
as staff and faculty. Seventy
eight students at Grove House
have demonstrated their recog
nition of its importance by con
tributing $1.00 per person to the
Children's Center of the Stan
ford Community since the ref
erendum was defeated.
We ask all Stanford students,
staff and faculty to do the same
or more tomorrow and

Wednesday of this week when we
will have a table at White Plaza
during the noon hour. This effort
will be successful if the 1400
students who voted for the child
care fee assessment in the last
week's ASSU elections will make
a gift and ask members of their
living group to contribute.
Although Stanford provides us
with a building and grounds
upkeep, we cannot continue to
fulfill the requirements of state
agencies on a fee structure which

students and many staff and
faculty can afford. Currently we
charge $.60 per hour with parent
participation at the Little Kids'
Place and between $52.50 to
$92.50 per month for 40 hour
week on ability-to-pay basis at
Day Care.
