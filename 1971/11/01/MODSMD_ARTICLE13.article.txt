## Background On The Placement Issue 
### 
Robert freelen

After the spring quarter
student referenda on recruiting
policy at the Career Planning /
Placement Center, several
discussions with David Josephson,
other residents of Columbae, and
other sponsors of the referenda
were held to discuss appropriate
means of reviewing the policies in
effect at the Center. On May 10,
President Lyman wrote to John
Ordway, student Chairman of the
Committee on Services to
Students (COSS) to request that
committee's advice on recruiting
policy and the referenda.
He specifically asked COSS to
comment on the question of
limiting services which are based

on the mutual consent of the
participants, and the mechanisms
for so doing.
COSS consists of nine voting
members, five of whom are
students. It is advisory to the
President and is charged with
"examining, evaluating and
recommending to the President,
policy on non-curricular services
provided for students by the
University."
COSS held three meetings on
the subject, and Chairman
Ordway reported back to the
President on June 2nd that the
Committee had met with
representatives of the placement
office. Stanford Community

Women for Peace, and Columbae,
and that it was divided on many
of the issues which had been
raised. He advised Mr. Lyman that
more information and discussion
was required prior to making final
recommendations concerning the
policy.
The Committee did forward
interim recommendations, which
were unanimously adopted,
including the retention of an open
recruiting policy which
guaranteed freedom of access to
recruiters and to all students. A
further recommendation was that
the President make clear that such
policy does not imply
endorsement of the policies of
firms using the Center. Finally,
the Committee urged that
information about companies
using the service be available to
students.
COSS established a
subcommittee under the
chairmanship of Dean Thomas

Rhue to continue the study
during the summer. Placement
staff members were designated to
work with the committee, but the
lack of committee members
forced the postponement of
further deliberations until
autumn.
More recently, Mr. Lyman
wrote to members of the main
committee that it should continue
its discussions despite the fact
that the ASSU Senate has not
made all of the student
nominations to COSS as yet.
Although two vacancies among
the five student positions have
forced a delay in the naming of a
Chairman for the Committee for
1971-72, COSS will again be
meeting this week, and hopes to
take up the placement policy
question at once.

After the spring quarter
student referenda on recruiting
policy at the Career Planning /
Placement Center, several
discussions with David Josephson,
other residents of Columbae, and
other sponsors of the referenda
were held to discuss appropriate
means of reviewing the policies in
effect at the Center. On May 10,
President Lyman wrote to John
Ordway, student Chairman of the
Committee on Services to
Students (COSS) to request that
committee's advice on recruiting
policy and the referenda.
He specifically asked COSS to
comment on the question of
limiting services which are based

on the mutual consent of the
participants, and the mechanisms
for so doing.
COSS consists of nine voting
members, five of whom are
students. It is advisory to the
President and is charged with
"examining, evaluating and
recommending to the President,
policy on non-curricular services
provided for students by the
University."
COSS held three meetings on
the subject, and Chairman
Ordway reported back to the
President on June 2nd that the
Committee had met with
representatives of the placement
office. Stanford Community

Women for Peace, and Columbae,
and that it was divided on many
of the issues which had been
raised. He advised Mr. Lyman that
more information and discussion
was required prior to making final
recommendations concerning the
policy.
The Committee did forward
interim recommendations, which
were unanimously adopted,
including the retention of an open
recruiting policy which
guaranteed freedom of access to
recruiters and to all students. A
further recommendation was that
the President make clear that such
policy does not imply
endorsement of the policies of
firms using the Center. Finally,
the Committee urged that
information about companies
using the service be available to
students.
COSS established a
subcommittee under the
chairmanship of Dean Thomas

Rhue to continue the study
during the summer. Placement
staff members were designated to
work with the committee, but the
lack of committee members
forced the postponement of
further deliberations until
autumn.
More recently, Mr. Lyman
wrote to members of the main
committee that it should continue
its discussions despite the fact
that the ASSU Senate has not
made all of the student
nominations to COSS as yet.
Although two vacancies among
the five student positions have
forced a delay in the naming of a
Chairman for the Committee for
1971-72, COSS will again be
meeting this week, and hopes to
take up the placement policy
question at once.
