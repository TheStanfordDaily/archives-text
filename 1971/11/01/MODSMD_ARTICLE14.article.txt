Congratulations
Editor, THE DAILY:
Well it's Halloween and the
Goblins (or is it the Young Crows)
are about again. They skip about
painting Stanford with deceptions
and half-truths. If they can just
convince Stanford that their own
haunted world is real, then they
have all the solutions. By
removing all research supported
by the DOD and stopping any
company who does business with
the DOD from recruiting on
campus, they will stop war. Next,
they will cure the population
problem by banning all Catholics
from campus.
The beautiful thing about the
Goblins is that they are so little
affected by facts. It doesn't
matter that the DOD would have
access to Zimbardo's research
results equally well whether or
not it is paying for the work; it
doesn't matter that the direction
and content of the work comes
from Zimbardo and not Laird.
The only thing that matters is that
the DOD pays for it and that
makes it evil.
General Motors does business
with the DOD so all Stanford
Students must be prevented from
talking to GM about a job. Note
that the Stanford student is not to
be trusted to make any such
decision for himself. No! the
Goblins must decide to whom he
can and cannot talk about
employment.
They are equally open minded
on research. They rarely attempt
to talk directly to the Professor
whom they would condemn.
Truth may confuse them. Rather
they live in their own haunted
world and avoid the real world
like a plague. Perhaps they should
be called Goebbels and not
Goblins, since Goebbels started
the big lie technique.
Of course, if one challenges the
Goblins, they bring down all of
their wrath on his head. He may
get threatening phone calls, a little
dynamite at night, or even
become a Hot Red Professor.

Professor of Electrical Engineering
and Material Science -and holder
of an immense number of DOD
and other evil contracts. (Some
times he even has enough money
to pay his graduate students.)

Recruiting Policy
Editor, THE DAILY:
We, the members of the
Columbae community, deplore
the mockery which the Stanford
administration has made of the
student body resolution of Spring
1971 to change the university
policy on military and corporate
recruiting.
The student body voted 1947
to 1496 "To prohibit the use of
Stanford lands for military service
recruiting," and 1758 to 1596
"To prohibit the use of Stanford
lands by corporations that are
directly producing material and
research for the military, 'directly
producing' to be defined by a
joint committee of three elected
representatives from the ASSU
Senate, three elected
representatives from the Faculty
Senate, and three elected
representatives from the Stanford
staff at large, which will make this
decision no later than May 25,
1971."
We deplore the fact that:
1. The sth, 9th, 10th, 16th,
17th, 32nd, 34th and 46th largest
military contractors in the U.S.
will be recruiting on campus
during the week of Nov. 1-5.
2. The U.S. Naval Civil
Engineering Laboratory will be
recruiting on campus on Monday,
Nov. 1, and the U.S. Air Force
will be recruiting on campus on
Wednesday, Nov. 3.
3. The joing committee called
for the the Spring 1971 resolution
to decide those corporations
which are "directly producing"
material and research for the
military has never been
established.
We believe that corporations
which manufacture such devices
as airborne missiles (Hughes
Research Labs, recruiting Nov. 1),
cluster bombs (Honeywell, Nov.
4), and tanks (General Motors,
Nov. 4) are the pillars of an
imperialist war machine and have
no place on a university campus.
We therefore urge the members
of the Stanford community to
express their outrage and to
insist that their Placement Service
abide by theirs, wishes as
expressed by the Spring 1971
resolution.
(Signed by 37 members of the
Columbae community.)
