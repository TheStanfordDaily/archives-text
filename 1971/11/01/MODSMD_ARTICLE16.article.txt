# German, Slavic Depts.
## Translating Courses Added 
### 
Stanford's German and Slavic
departments have added new
courses designed to prepare
language students for jobs.
The translating and
interpreting program, new to
Stanford this fall, will enable
students to graduate with a
translating certificate in addition

to an A.8., not necessarily in a
language.
One of the designers of the
program, Prof. Walter F.W.
Lohnes of the German
department, cites a demand for
translators in business and
government and a need for
interpreters at international
conferences. Translators deal with

written materials and interpreters
with the spoken languages.
Besides the previous courses
available in German, the
department now offers courses in
the problems of translation and
German for translators.
The Slavic department's
translating course emphasizes
aspects of Russian grammar.
Prof. Joseph A. Van Campen,
chairman of the department, cites
translating for the CIA and
analysis of Soviet press as job
possibilities for the graduate with
a good command of Russian. He
noted that to teach the language,
a student would have to obtain a
teaching degree, M.A. or Ph.D.
Professor Van Campen is
writing a set of second year
materials for the program.
