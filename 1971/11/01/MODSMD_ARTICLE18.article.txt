# Last Half Comeback Propels Indians Past Beavers
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
CORVALLIS, ORE. - Just when
it seemed that any chance of a
second straight conference
championship and Rose Bowl bid
would be lost on a grey Corvallis
day, Stanford capitalized on
second-half Oregon State mistakes
to squeak out a 31-24 comeback
victory over the Beavers Saturday.
By beating OSU, the Indians
raised their conference-leading
record to 4-1 and retained their
role as the Rose Bowl favorite. A
Stanford win over UCLA next
Saturday coupled with a single
Washington State loss in any of
their three remaining conference
games would send the Tribe back
to Pasadena.
The Cougars beat Oregon
31-21 in a snowy Spokane on
Saturday, but with their three
remaining games against USC,
Oregon State and Washington all
on the road, Stanford is a heavy
favorite to retain the conference
championship. For a long time
Saturday, however, Stanford's
Rose Bowl chances were in
considerable doubt.

Almost everything was going
perfect for the orange and black
bedecked Beavers on a spooky
and cold Halloween eve as they
moved out to a 2 4 -3 first half lead
and were heading for the end zone
again with a first and ten on the
Stanford 37 with only 1:14 to go
in the second quarter.
With starting fullback Dave
Schilling sidelined with a leg
injury, .the Beavers used
second-stringer Roger Smith to
propel a powerful rushing offense
which often utilized a wishbone
veer. After the game Stanford
coach John Ralston admitted that
"Oregon State changed its
blocking patterns from the past,
and it had us confused."
After Jackie Brown fumbled
on his own 23 early in the
opening quarter, OSU needed
only five plays to score. The 5-11,
225 lb. Smith ran for 18 yards on
four of those plays, with his final
run being a six-inch carry for the
score.
Stanford was forced to punt
four plays later and the Beavers
took over at their own 40. An
illegal procedure penalty moved

them back to their 35, but in 13
plays, the Beavers gained the
necessary 65 yards for the
touchdown. OSU passed only
once on the drive, while Smith
gained 26 yards in five carries,
including a four yard run for his
second six-pointer.
Rod Garcia connected on a 28
yard field goal early in the second
quarter to make it 14-3. But
midway through the period, a
beautiful 42 yard punt return by
Jim Lilly gave the Beavers
possession on the Stanfod 35.
Seven plays later they scored,
with Smith again running it in
from four yards out.
Miles Moore fumbled the
following kickoff and four plays
later, Lynn Boston converted a 43
yard three-pointer to make it
24-3. Three plays later, Don
Bunce had a pass intercepted by
middle linebacker Steve Brown
and the Beavers took over on the
Indian 48. Smith carried four
straight times for 11 yards, to
make it first and ten on the 37.
But on that first and ten,
quarterback Jim Kilmartin
fumbled while attempting to pass
and linebacker Jim Merlo
recovered on the Oregon State 46.
The next play started a change of
direction which turned what
might have been an Oregon State
rout, into a last minute Stanford
victory.
Desperation
Up to this point, Bunce had
completed 7 of 14 passes for only
48 yards and he had had two
passes intercepted by Brown. But
when you're 21 points behind
with 1:09 remaining in the hclf,
there isn't much doubt about
what you're going to do.
Bunce dropped back to pass
and with a heavy OSU rush
breaking down his protection, he
was forced to scramble. Bunce
should've been caught a couple of
times on this busted play, but he
still was able to evade being
tackled and finally looped a pass
deep towards the Beaver goal line.
Defensive halfback Bruce Fry
was obviously as surprised as
anyone that Bunce was able to get
the pass off, and flanker John
Winesberry was able to beat him,
taking the ball in around the 20
and scoring easily. A Garcia
conversion made it 2 4 -10.
Seconds later, Merlo recovered
a successful onsides kick at the
OSU 47. But three plays later,
Bunce had a third pass intercepted
by Brown and the Beavers led at
halftime by 14. However,
Stanford had been able to get
those seven points on the
scoreboard, and after it was all
over, they seemed like a big key
to the victory. Press box observers
had been commenting on how
open Winesberry had been much
of the time, but you have to have
the ball thrown to you in order to
score.

And on that incredible broken
play, Winesberry miraculously
ended up getting the ball. After
the win, Winesberry commented
on the play. "It was a busted play.
On it, I'm supposed to streak. But
I faked an out and went straight
up after taking two or three steps
to the sideline." Somewhere along
the way Fry got lost.
"Momentum"
Momentum is a hackneyed
word which has become a classic
in the annals of sports cliches. But
if that word can be validly used, it
should be applied to the effect
that first Stanford touchdown
had. Stanford was able to go to
the lockerroom at halftime with
some regained confidence,
realizing that they could score.
Winesberry talked about his
feelings at halftime. "I never had
any doubt that we were going to
pull it out. That play raised our
morale terriffically. Everybody
got their confidence back. We
were just beating ourselves.
Everything was going to reverse
itself in the second half. At
halftime, everybody just reflected.
It never occurred in my mind that
we were going to lose."
Although it took almost all of
those 30 second half minutes to
go ahead, the reversal occurred
dramatically. Both figuartively
and literally, the sun began to
shine in Corvallis during that
second half. Losing coach Dee
"Great Pumpkin" Andros put it
this way: "We had the momentum
going in the first half, but they
took it away from us in the
second half."
On their first two second-half
drives, Stanford couldn't move
closer than the Beaver 35. But
OSU wasn't getting far either and
after being forced to punt from
their own 24 late in the third
quarter, Stanford took over on
their own 30.
The Indians lost three on a
swing pass and gained six on a run
by Reggie Sanderson. Then the
second big play of the game
occurred. From his own 33,
Bunce hit split end Miles Moore
on a post pattern at the Beaver 4 0
and Moore raced into the Beaver
end zone. The gap had been
closed to seven.
Too Many Fumbles
Soon after that, the Beavers
fumbled and Stanford had the ball
on the OSU 33. But the Beaver
defense tightened and a 46 yard
Garcia field goal attempt on the
second play of the fourth quarter
was wide.
But one again the Beavers
fumbled, to continue a trend
which led to their ultimate
downfall. Wingback Jerry
Mc√üurney lost the ball at his own
46.
A pass to Winesberry, a run by
Jackie Brown and two keeps by
Bunce moved the Indians to a first
and goal at the two yard line.

Brown went up the middle to the
one and on the next play, he went
up the middle into the end zone
to make it 24-23 with 8 :41 to go.
Ralston said that in that
situation he would usually go for
the one point conversion since
there were more than six minutes
left. But this time he gambled,
and for the moment he lost.
Bunce was under heavy pressure
on the conversion attempt and a
desperation pass looped for
Winesberry was intercepted by
Brown.
Once again though, the curse
of the fumble would descend on
Oregon State. All week long,
Stanford had been preparing for
the Beavers leading rusher,
Schilling. But with his leg injury,
Andros had used Smith, who did
an outstanding job, gaining a total
of 148 yards in 38 carries. Still
Andros inserted a cold Schilling
into the game on the next series.
On his first carry, the 6-3, 227
lb. fullback fumbled and tackle
Roger Cowan recovered for

Stanford at the OSU 41. There
were six minutes and 13 seconds
remaining and Stanford used
almost every second on their way
to the end zone.
Winning Drive
Bunce engineered a superb
drive, passing only one time. Jim
Kehl, who had replaced Hillary
Shockley when he reinjured his
ankle, did most of the running,
picking up 15 tough yards in 6
carries. Bunce ran three times
during the drive with Jackie
Brown taking the other two
carries, with his last being the
most important.
On a third and goal from the
one, Brown dove over left tackle
into the end zone to give the
Indians a 29-24 lead with only 5 3
seconds left. Bunce completed a

two point conversion pass to Glen
Stone and Stanford was once
again back on the Rose Bowl
track.
OSU's other quarterback, Steve
Endicott, attempted a few
desperate passes as the clock ran
out, but free safety Bennie Barnes
intercepted a fourth down pass at
the Stanford 4 6 and ran it back to
the OSU 32 to seal the victory.
With a win over UCLA and a little
help from their friends, the
Indians will again be in Pasadena
two months from today.

four of those plays, with his final
run being a six-inch carry for the
score.
Stanford was forced to punt
four plays later and the Beavers
took over at their own 40. An
illegal procedure penalty moved

them back to their 35, but in 13
plays, the Beavers gained the
necessary 65 yards for the
touchdown. OSU passed only
once on the drive, while Smith
gained 26 yards in five carries,
including a four yard run for his
second six-pointer.
Rod Garcia connected on a 28
yard field goal early in the second
quarter to make it 14-3. But
midway through the period, a
beautiful 42 yard punt return by
Jim Lilly gave the Beavers
possession on the Stanfod 35.
Seven plays later they scored,
with Smith again running it in
from four yards out.
Miles Moore fumbled the
following kickoff and four plays
later, Lynn Boston converted a 43
yard three-pointer to make it
24-3. Three plays later, Don
Bunce had a pass intercepted by
middle linebacker Steve Brown
and the Beavers took over on the
Indian 48. Smith carried four
straight times for 11 yards, to
make it first and ten on the 37.
But on that first and ten,
quarterback Jim Kilmartin
fumbled while attempting to pass
and linebacker Jim Merlo
recovered on the Oregon State 46.
The next play started a change of
direction which turned what
might have been an Oregon State
rout, into a last minute Stanford
victory.
Desperation
Up to this point, Bunce had
completed 7 of 14 passes for only
48 yards and he had had two
passes intercepted by Brown. But
when you're 21 points behind
with 1:09 remaining in the hclf,
there isn't much doubt about
what you're going to do.
Bunce dropped back to pass
and with a heavy OSU rush
breaking down his protection, he
was forced to scramble. Bunce
should've been caught a couple of
times on this busted play, but he
still was able to evade being
tackled and finally looped a pass
deep towards the Beaver goal line.
Defensive halfback Bruce Fry
was obviously as surprised as
anyone that Bunce was able to get
the pass off, and flanker John
Winesberry was able to beat him,
taking the ball in around the 20
and scoring easily. A Garcia
conversion made it 2 4 -10.
Seconds later, Merlo recovered
a successful onsides kick at the
OSU 47. But three plays later,
Bunce had a third pass intercepted
by Brown and the Beavers led at
halftime by 14. However,
Stanford had been able to get
those seven points on the
scoreboard, and after it was all
over, they seemed like a big key
to the victory. Press box observers
had been commenting on how
open Winesberry had been much
of the time, but you have to have
the ball thrown to you in order to
score.

And on that incredible broken
play, Winesberry miraculously
ended up getting the ball. After
the win, Winesberry commented
on the play. "It was a busted play.
On it, I'm supposed to streak. But
I faked an out and went straight
up after taking two or three steps
to the sideline." Somewhere along
the way Fry got lost.
"Momentum"
Momentum is a hackneyed
word which has become a classic
in the annals of sports cliches. But
if that word can be validly used, it
should be applied to the effect
that first Stanford touchdown
had. Stanford was able to go to
the lockerroom at halftime with
some regained confidence,
realizing that they could score.
Winesberry talked about his
feelings at halftime. "I never had
any doubt that we were going to
pull it out. That play raised our
morale terriffically. Everybody
got their confidence back. We
were just beating ourselves.
Everything was going to reverse
itself in the second half. At
halftime, everybody just reflected.
It never occurred in my mind that
we were going to lose."
Although it took almost all of
those 30 second half minutes to
go ahead, the reversal occurred
dramatically. Both figuartively
and literally, the sun began to
shine in Corvallis during that
second half. Losing coach Dee
"Great Pumpkin" Andros put it
this way: "We had the momentum
going in the first half, but they
took it away from us in the
second half."
On their first two second-half
drives, Stanford couldn't move
closer than the Beaver 35. But
OSU wasn't getting far either and
after being forced to punt from
their own 24 late in the third
quarter, Stanford took over on
their own 30.
The Indians lost three on a
swing pass and gained six on a run
by Reggie Sanderson. Then the
second big play of the game
occurred. From his own 33,
Bunce hit split end Miles Moore
on a post pattern at the Beaver 4 0
and Moore raced into the Beaver
end zone. The gap had been
closed to seven.
Too Many Fumbles
Soon after that, the Beavers
fumbled and Stanford had the ball
on the OSU 33. But the Beaver
defense tightened and a 46 yard
Garcia field goal attempt on the
second play of the fourth quarter
was wide.
But one again the Beavers
fumbled, to continue a trend
which led to their ultimate
downfall. Wingback Jerry
Mc√üurney lost the ball at his own
46.
A pass to Winesberry, a run by
Jackie Brown and two keeps by
Bunce moved the Indians to a first
and goal at the two yard line.

Brown went up the middle to the
one and on the next play, he went
up the middle into the end zone
to make it 24-23 with 8 :41 to go.
Ralston said that in that
situation he would usually go for
the one point conversion since
there were more than six minutes
left. But this time he gambled,
and for the moment he lost.
Bunce was under heavy pressure
on the conversion attempt and a
desperation pass looped for
Winesberry was intercepted by
Brown.
Once again though, the curse
of the fumble would descend on
Oregon State. All week long,
Stanford had been preparing for
the Beavers leading rusher,
Schilling. But with his leg injury,
Andros had used Smith, who did
an outstanding job, gaining a total
of 148 yards in 38 carries. Still
Andros inserted a cold Schilling
into the game on the next series.
On his first carry, the 6-3, 227
lb. fullback fumbled and tackle
Roger Cowan recovered for

Stanford at the OSU 41. There
were six minutes and 13 seconds
remaining and Stanford used
almost every second on their way
to the end zone.
Winning Drive
Bunce engineered a superb
drive, passing only one time. Jim
Kehl, who had replaced Hillary
Shockley when he reinjured his
ankle, did most of the running,
picking up 15 tough yards in 6
carries. Bunce ran three times
during the drive with Jackie
Brown taking the other two
carries, with his last being the
most important.
On a third and goal from the
one, Brown dove over left tackle
into the end zone to give the
Indians a 29-24 lead with only 5 3
seconds left. Bunce completed a

two point conversion pass to Glen
Stone and Stanford was once
again back on the Rose Bowl
track.
OSU's other quarterback, Steve
Endicott, attempted a few
desperate passes as the clock ran
out, but free safety Bennie Barnes
intercepted a fourth down pass at
the Stanford 4 6 and ran it back to
the OSU 32 to seal the victory.
With a win over UCLA and a little
help from their friends, the
Indians will again be in Pasadena
two months from today.
CORVALLIS, ORE. - Just when
it seemed that any chance of a
second straight conference
championship and Rose Bowl bid
would be lost on a grey Corvallis
day, Stanford capitalized on
second-half Oregon State mistakes
to squeak out a 31-24 comeback
victory over the Beavers Saturday.
By beating OSU, the Indians
raised their conference-leading
record to 4-1 and retained their
role as the Rose Bowl favorite. A
Stanford win over UCLA next
Saturday coupled with a single
Washington State loss in any of
their three remaining conference
games would send the Tribe back
to Pasadena.
The Cougars beat Oregon
31-21 in a snowy Spokane on
Saturday, but with their three
remaining games against USC,
Oregon State and Washington all
on the road, Stanford is a heavy
favorite to retain the conference
championship. For a long time
Saturday, however, Stanford's
Rose Bowl chances were in
considerable doubt.

Almost everything was going
perfect for the orange and black
bedecked Beavers on a spooky
and cold Halloween eve as they
moved out to a 2 4 -3 first half lead
and were heading for the end zone
again with a first and ten on the
Stanford 37 with only 1:14 to go
in the second quarter.
With starting fullback Dave
Schilling sidelined with a leg
injury, .the Beavers used
second-stringer Roger Smith to
propel a powerful rushing offense
which often utilized a wishbone
veer. After the game Stanford
coach John Ralston admitted that
"Oregon State changed its
blocking patterns from the past,
and it had us confused."
After Jackie Brown fumbled
on his own 23 early in the
opening quarter, OSU needed
only five plays to score. The 5-11,

with 1:09 remaining in the hclf,
there isn't much doubt about
what you're going to do.
Bunce dropped back to pass
and with a heavy OSU rush
breaking down his protection, he
was forced to scramble. Bunce
should've been caught a couple of
times on this busted play, but he
still was able to evade being
tackled and finally looped a pass
deep towards the Beaver goal line.
Defensive halfback Bruce Fry
was obviously as surprised as
anyone that Bunce was able to get
the pass off, and flanker John
Winesberry was able to beat him,
taking the ball in around the 20
and scoring easily. A Garcia
conversion made it 2 4 -10.
Seconds later, Merlo recovered
a successful onsides kick at the
OSU 47. But three plays later,
Bunce had a third pass intercepted
by Brown and the Beavers led at
halftime by 14. However,
Stanford had been able to get
those seven points on the
scoreboard, and after it was all
over, they seemed like a big key
to the victory. Press box observers
had been commenting on how
open Winesberry had been much
of the time, but you have to have
the ball thrown to you in order to
score.

And on that incredible broken
play, Winesberry miraculously
ended up getting the ball. After
the win, Winesberry commented
on the play. "It was a busted play.
On it, I'm supposed to streak. But
I faked an out and went straight
up after taking two or three steps
to the sideline." Somewhere along
the way Fry got lost.
"Momentum"
Momentum is a hackneyed
word which has become a classic
in the annals of sports cliches. But
if that word can be validly used, it
should be applied to the effect
that first Stanford touchdown
had. Stanford was able to go to
the lockerroom at halftime with
some regained confidence,
realizing that they could score.
Winesberry talked about his
feelings at halftime. "I never had
any doubt that we were going to
pull it out. That play raised our
morale terriffically. Everybody
got their confidence back. We
were just beating ourselves.
Everything was going to reverse
itself in the second half. At
halftime, everybody just reflected.
It never occurred in my mind that
we were going to lose."
Although it took almost all of
those 30 second half minutes to
go ahead, the reversal occurred
dramatically. Both figuartively
and literally, the sun began to
shine in Corvallis during that
second half. Losing coach Dee
"Great Pumpkin" Andros put it
this way: "We had the momentum
going in the first half, but they
took it away from us in the
second half."
On their first two second-half
drives, Stanford couldn't move
closer than the Beaver 35. But
OSU wasn't getting far either and
after being forced to punt from
their own 24 late in the third
quarter, Stanford took over on
their own 30.
The Indians lost three on a
swing pass and gained six on a run
by Reggie Sanderson. Then the
second big play of the game
occurred. From his own 33,
Bunce hit split end Miles Moore
on a post pattern at the Beaver 4 0
and Moore raced into the Beaver
end zone. The gap had been
closed to seven.
Too Many Fumbles
Soon after that, the Beavers
fumbled and Stanford had the ball
on the OSU 33. But the Beaver
defense tightened and a 46 yard
Garcia field goal attempt on the
second play of the fourth quarter
was wide.
But one again the Beavers
fumbled, to continue a trend
which led to their ultimate
downfall. Wingback Jerry
Mc√üurney lost the ball at his own
46.
A pass to Winesberry, a run by
Jackie Brown and two keeps by
Bunce moved the Indians to a first
and goal at the two yard line.

Brown went up the middle to the
one and on the next play, he went
up the middle into the end zone
to make it 24-23 with 8 :41 to go.
Ralston said that in that
situation he would usually go for
the one point conversion since
there were more than six minutes
left. But this time he gambled,
and for the moment he lost.
Bunce was under heavy pressure
on the conversion attempt and a
desperation pass looped for
Winesberry was intercepted by
Brown.
Once again though, the curse
of the fumble would descend on
Oregon State. All week long,
Stanford had been preparing for
the Beavers leading rusher,
Schilling. But with his leg injury,
Andros had used Smith, who did
an outstanding job, gaining a total
of 148 yards in 38 carries. Still
Andros inserted a cold Schilling
into the game on the next series.
On his first carry, the 6-3, 227
lb. fullback fumbled and tackle
Roger Cowan recovered for

Stanford at the OSU 41. There
were six minutes and 13 seconds
remaining and Stanford used
almost every second on their way
to the end zone.
Winning Drive
Bunce engineered a superb
drive, passing only one time. Jim
Kehl, who had replaced Hillary
Shockley when he reinjured his
ankle, did most of the running,
picking up 15 tough yards in 6
carries. Bunce ran three times
during the drive with Jackie
Brown taking the other two
carries, with his last being the
most important.
On a third and goal from the
one, Brown dove over left tackle
into the end zone to give the
Indians a 29-24 lead with only 5 3
seconds left. Bunce completed a

two point conversion pass to Glen
Stone and Stanford was once
again back on the Rose Bowl
track.
OSU's other quarterback, Steve
Endicott, attempted a few
desperate passes as the clock ran
out, but free safety Bennie Barnes
intercepted a fourth down pass at
the Stanford 4 6 and ran it back to
the OSU 32 to seal the victory.
With a win over UCLA and a little
help from their friends, the
Indians will again be in Pasadena
two months from today.
CORVALLIS, ORE. - Just when
it seemed that any chance of a
second straight conference
championship and Rose Bowl bid
would be lost on a grey Corvallis
day, Stanford capitalized on
second-half Oregon State mistakes
to squeak out a 31-24 comeback
victory over the Beavers Saturday.
By beating OSU, the Indians
raised their conference-leading
record to 4-1 and retained their
role as the Rose Bowl favorite. A
Stanford win over UCLA next
Saturday coupled with a single
Washington State loss in any of
their three remaining conference
games would send the Tribe back
to Pasadena.
The Cougars beat Oregon
31-21 in a snowy Spokane on
Saturday, but with their three
remaining games against USC,
Oregon State and Washington all
on the road, Stanford is a heavy
favorite to retain the conference
championship. For a long time
Saturday, however, Stanford's
Rose Bowl chances were in
considerable doubt.

Almost everything was going
perfect for the orange and black
bedecked Beavers on a spooky
and cold Halloween eve as they
moved out to a 2 4 -3 first half lead
and were heading for the end zone
again with a first and ten on the
Stanford 37 with only 1:14 to go
in the second quarter.
With starting fullback Dave
Schilling sidelined with a leg
injury, .the Beavers used
second-stringer Roger Smith to
propel a powerful rushing offense
which often utilized a wishbone
veer. After the game Stanford
coach John Ralston admitted that
"Oregon State changed its
blocking patterns from the past,
and it had us confused."
After Jackie Brown fumbled
on his own 23 early in the
opening quarter, OSU needed
only five plays to score. The 5-11,
225 lb. Smith ran for 18 yards on
four of those plays, with his final
run being a six-inch carry for the
score.
Stanford was forced to punt
four plays later and the Beavers
took over at their own 40. An
illegal procedure penalty moved

them back to their 35, but in 13
plays, the Beavers gained the
necessary 65 yards for the
touchdown. OSU passed only
once on the drive, while Smith
gained 26 yards in five carries,
including a four yard run for his
second six-pointer.
Rod Garcia connected on a 28
yard field goal early in the second
quarter to make it 14-3. But
midway through the period, a
beautiful 42 yard punt return by
Jim Lilly gave the Beavers
possession on the Stanfod 35.
Seven plays later they scored,
with Smith again running it in
from four yards out.
Miles Moore fumbled the
following kickoff and four plays
later, Lynn Boston converted a 43
yard three-pointer to make it
24-3. Three plays later, Don
Bunce had a pass intercepted by
middle linebacker Steve Brown
and the Beavers took over on the
Indian 48. Smith carried four
straight times for 11 yards, to
make it first and ten on the 37.
But on that first and ten,
quarterback Jim Kilmartin
fumbled while attempting to pass
and linebacker Jim Merlo
recovered on the Oregon State 46.
The next play started a change of
direction which turned what
might have been an Oregon State
rout, into a last minute Stanford
victory.
Desperation
Up to this point, Bunce had
completed 7 of 14 passes for only
48 yards and he had had two
passes intercepted by Brown. But
when you're 21 points behind
with 1:09 remaining in the hclf,
there isn't much doubt about
what you're going to do.
Bunce dropped back to pass
and with a heavy OSU rush

had. Stanford was able to go to
the lockerroom at halftime with
some regained confidence,
realizing that they could score.
Winesberry talked about his
feelings at halftime. "I never had
any doubt that we were going to
pull it out. That play raised our
morale terriffically. Everybody
got their confidence back. We
were just beating ourselves.
Everything was going to reverse
itself in the second half. At
halftime, everybody just reflected.
It never occurred in my mind that
we were going to lose."
Although it took almost all of
those 30 second half minutes to
go ahead, the reversal occurred
dramatically. Both figuartively
and literally, the sun began to
shine in Corvallis during that
second half. Losing coach Dee
"Great Pumpkin" Andros put it
this way: "We had the momentum
going in the first half, but they
took it away from us in the
second half."
On their first two second-half
drives, Stanford couldn't move
closer than the Beaver 35. But
OSU wasn't getting far either and
after being forced to punt from
their own 24 late in the third
quarter, Stanford took over on
their own 30.
The Indians lost three on a
swing pass and gained six on a run
by Reggie Sanderson. Then the
second big play of the game
occurred. From his own 33,
Bunce hit split end Miles Moore
on a post pattern at the Beaver 4 0
and Moore raced into the Beaver
end zone. The gap had been
closed to seven.
Too Many Fumbles
Soon after that, the Beavers
fumbled and Stanford had the ball
on the OSU 33. But the Beaver
defense tightened and a 46 yard
Garcia field goal attempt on the
second play of the fourth quarter
was wide.
But one again the Beavers
fumbled, to continue a trend
which led to their ultimate
downfall. Wingback Jerry
Mc√üurney lost the ball at his own
46.
A pass to Winesberry, a run by
Jackie Brown and two keeps by
Bunce moved the Indians to a first
and goal at the two yard line.

Brown went up the middle to the
one and on the next play, he went
up the middle into the end zone
to make it 24-23 with 8 :41 to go.
Ralston said that in that
situation he would usually go for
the one point conversion since
there were more than six minutes
left. But this time he gambled,
and for the moment he lost.
Bunce was under heavy pressure
on the conversion attempt and a
desperation pass looped for
Winesberry was intercepted by
Brown.
Once again though, the curse
of the fumble would descend on
Oregon State. All week long,
Stanford had been preparing for
the Beavers leading rusher,
Schilling. But with his leg injury,
Andros had used Smith, who did
an outstanding job, gaining a total
of 148 yards in 38 carries. Still
Andros inserted a cold Schilling
into the game on the next series.
On his first carry, the 6-3, 227
lb. fullback fumbled and tackle
Roger Cowan recovered for

Stanford at the OSU 41. There
were six minutes and 13 seconds
remaining and Stanford used
almost every second on their way
to the end zone.
Winning Drive
Bunce engineered a superb
drive, passing only one time. Jim
Kehl, who had replaced Hillary
Shockley when he reinjured his
ankle, did most of the running,
picking up 15 tough yards in 6
carries. Bunce ran three times
during the drive with Jackie
Brown taking the other two
carries, with his last being the
most important.
On a third and goal from the
one, Brown dove over left tackle
into the end zone to give the
Indians a 29-24 lead with only 5 3
seconds left. Bunce completed a

two point conversion pass to Glen
Stone and Stanford was once
again back on the Rose Bowl
track.
OSU's other quarterback, Steve
Endicott, attempted a few
desperate passes as the clock ran
out, but free safety Bennie Barnes
intercepted a fourth down pass at
the Stanford 4 6 and ran it back to
the OSU 32 to seal the victory.
With a win over UCLA and a little
help from their friends, the
Indians will again be in Pasadena
two months from today.
CORVALLIS, ORE. - Just when
it seemed that any chance of a
second straight conference
championship and Rose Bowl bid
would be lost on a grey Corvallis
day, Stanford capitalized on
second-half Oregon State mistakes
to squeak out a 31-24 comeback
victory over the Beavers Saturday.
By beating OSU, the Indians
raised their conference-leading
record to 4-1 and retained their
role as the Rose Bowl favorite. A
Stanford win over UCLA next
Saturday coupled with a single
Washington State loss in any of
their three remaining conference
games would send the Tribe back
to Pasadena.
The Cougars beat Oregon
31-21 in a snowy Spokane on
Saturday, but with their three
remaining games against USC,
Oregon State and Washington all
on the road, Stanford is a heavy
favorite to retain the conference
championship. For a long time
Saturday, however, Stanford's
Rose Bowl chances were in
considerable doubt.

Almost everything was going
perfect for the orange and black
bedecked Beavers on a spooky
and cold Halloween eve as they
moved out to a 2 4 -3 first half lead
and were heading for the end zone
again with a first and ten on the
Stanford 37 with only 1:14 to go
in the second quarter.
With starting fullback Dave
Schilling sidelined with a leg
injury, .the Beavers used
second-stringer Roger Smith to
propel a powerful rushing offense
which often utilized a wishbone
veer. After the game Stanford
coach John Ralston admitted that
"Oregon State changed its
blocking patterns from the past,
and it had us confused."
After Jackie Brown fumbled
on his own 23 early in the
opening quarter, OSU needed
only five plays to score. The 5-11,
225 lb. Smith ran for 18 yards on
four of those plays, with his final
run being a six-inch carry for the
score.
Stanford was forced to punt
four plays later and the Beavers
took over at their own 40. An
illegal procedure penalty moved

them back to their 35, but in 13
plays, the Beavers gained the
necessary 65 yards for the
touchdown. OSU passed only
once on the drive, while Smith
gained 26 yards in five carries,
including a four yard run for his
second six-pointer.
Rod Garcia connected on a 28
yard field goal early in the second
quarter to make it 14-3. But
midway through the period, a
beautiful 42 yard punt return by
Jim Lilly gave the Beavers
possession on the Stanfod 35.
Seven plays later they scored,
with Smith again running it in
from four yards out.
Miles Moore fumbled the
following kickoff and four plays
later, Lynn Boston converted a 43
yard three-pointer to make it
24-3. Three plays later, Don
Bunce had a pass intercepted by
middle linebacker Steve Brown
and the Beavers took over on the
Indian 48. Smith carried four
straight times for 11 yards, to
make it first and ten on the 37.
But on that first and ten,
quarterback Jim Kilmartin
fumbled while attempting to pass
and linebacker Jim Merlo
recovered on the Oregon State 46.
The next play started a change of
direction which turned what
might have been an Oregon State
rout, into a last minute Stanford
victory.
Desperation
Up to this point, Bunce had
completed 7 of 14 passes for only
48 yards and he had had two
passes intercepted by Brown. But
when you're 21 points behind
with 1:09 remaining in the hclf,
there isn't much doubt about
what you're going to do.
Bunce dropped back to pass
and with a heavy OSU rush
breaking down his protection, he
was forced to scramble. Bunce
should've been caught a couple of
times on this busted play, but he
still was able to evade being
tackled and finally looped a pass
deep towards the Beaver goal line.
Defensive halfback Bruce Fry
was obviously as surprised as
anyone that Bunce was able to get
the pass off, and flanker John
Winesberry was able to beat him,
taking the ball in around the 20
and scoring easily. A Garcia
conversion made it 2 4 -10.
Seconds later, Merlo recovered
a successful onsides kick at the
OSU 47. But three plays later,
Bunce had a third pass intercepted
by Brown and the Beavers led at
halftime by 14. However,
Stanford had been able to get
those seven points on the
scoreboard, and after it was all
over, they seemed like a big key
to the victory. Press box observers
had been commenting on how
open Winesberry had been much
of the time, but you have to have
the ball thrown to you in order to
score.

And on that incredible broken
play, Winesberry miraculously
ended up getting the ball. After
the win, Winesberry commented
on the play. "It was a busted play.
On it, I'm supposed to streak. But
I faked an out and went straight
up after taking two or three steps
to the sideline." Somewhere along
the way Fry got lost.
"Momentum"
Momentum is a hackneyed
word which has become a classic
in the annals of sports cliches. But
if that word can be validly used, it
should be applied to the effect
that first Stanford touchdown
had. Stanford was able to go to
the lockerroom at halftime with
some regained confidence,

downfall. Wingback Jerry
Mc√üurney lost the ball at his own
46.
A pass to Winesberry, a run by
Jackie Brown and two keeps by
Bunce moved the Indians to a first
and goal at the two yard line.

Brown went up the middle to the
one and on the next play, he went
up the middle into the end zone
to make it 24-23 with 8 :41 to go.
Ralston said that in that
situation he would usually go for
the one point conversion since
there were more than six minutes
left. But this time he gambled,
and for the moment he lost.
Bunce was under heavy pressure
on the conversion attempt and a
desperation pass looped for
Winesberry was intercepted by
Brown.
Once again though, the curse
of the fumble would descend on
Oregon State. All week long,
Stanford had been preparing for
the Beavers leading rusher,
Schilling. But with his leg injury,
Andros had used Smith, who did
an outstanding job, gaining a total
of 148 yards in 38 carries. Still
Andros inserted a cold Schilling
into the game on the next series.
On his first carry, the 6-3, 227
lb. fullback fumbled and tackle
Roger Cowan recovered for

Stanford at the OSU 41. There
were six minutes and 13 seconds
remaining and Stanford used
almost every second on their way
to the end zone.
Winning Drive
Bunce engineered a superb
drive, passing only one time. Jim
Kehl, who had replaced Hillary
Shockley when he reinjured his
ankle, did most of the running,
picking up 15 tough yards in 6
carries. Bunce ran three times
during the drive with Jackie
Brown taking the other two
carries, with his last being the
most important.
On a third and goal from the
one, Brown dove over left tackle
into the end zone to give the
Indians a 29-24 lead with only 5 3
seconds left. Bunce completed a

two point conversion pass to Glen
Stone and Stanford was once
again back on the Rose Bowl
track.
OSU's other quarterback, Steve
Endicott, attempted a few
desperate passes as the clock ran
out, but free safety Bennie Barnes
intercepted a fourth down pass at
the Stanford 4 6 and ran it back to
the OSU 32 to seal the victory.
With a win over UCLA and a little
help from their friends, the
Indians will again be in Pasadena
two months from today.
CORVALLIS, ORE. - Just when
it seemed that any chance of a
second straight conference
championship and Rose Bowl bid
would be lost on a grey Corvallis
day, Stanford capitalized on
second-half Oregon State mistakes
to squeak out a 31-24 comeback
victory over the Beavers Saturday.
By beating OSU, the Indians
raised their conference-leading
record to 4-1 and retained their
role as the Rose Bowl favorite. A
Stanford win over UCLA next
Saturday coupled with a single
Washington State loss in any of
their three remaining conference
games would send the Tribe back
to Pasadena.
The Cougars beat Oregon
31-21 in a snowy Spokane on
Saturday, but with their three
remaining games against USC,
Oregon State and Washington all
on the road, Stanford is a heavy
favorite to retain the conference
championship. For a long time
Saturday, however, Stanford's
Rose Bowl chances were in
considerable doubt.

Almost everything was going
perfect for the orange and black
bedecked Beavers on a spooky
and cold Halloween eve as they
moved out to a 2 4 -3 first half lead
and were heading for the end zone
again with a first and ten on the
Stanford 37 with only 1:14 to go
in the second quarter.
With starting fullback Dave
Schilling sidelined with a leg
injury, .the Beavers used
second-stringer Roger Smith to
propel a powerful rushing offense
which often utilized a wishbone
veer. After the game Stanford
coach John Ralston admitted that
"Oregon State changed its
blocking patterns from the past,
and it had us confused."
After Jackie Brown fumbled
on his own 23 early in the
opening quarter, OSU needed
only five plays to score. The 5-11,
225 lb. Smith ran for 18 yards on
four of those plays, with his final
run being a six-inch carry for the
score.
Stanford was forced to punt
four plays later and the Beavers
took over at their own 40. An
illegal procedure penalty moved

them back to their 35, but in 13
plays, the Beavers gained the
necessary 65 yards for the
touchdown. OSU passed only
once on the drive, while Smith
gained 26 yards in five carries,
including a four yard run for his
second six-pointer.
Rod Garcia connected on a 28
yard field goal early in the second
quarter to make it 14-3. But
midway through the period, a
beautiful 42 yard punt return by
Jim Lilly gave the Beavers
possession on the Stanfod 35.
Seven plays later they scored,
with Smith again running it in
from four yards out.
Miles Moore fumbled the
following kickoff and four plays
later, Lynn Boston converted a 43
yard three-pointer to make it
24-3. Three plays later, Don
Bunce had a pass intercepted by
middle linebacker Steve Brown
and the Beavers took over on the
Indian 48. Smith carried four
straight times for 11 yards, to
make it first and ten on the 37.
But on that first and ten,
quarterback Jim Kilmartin
fumbled while attempting to pass
and linebacker Jim Merlo
recovered on the Oregon State 46.
The next play started a change of
direction which turned what
might have been an Oregon State
rout, into a last minute Stanford
victory.
Desperation
Up to this point, Bunce had
completed 7 of 14 passes for only
48 yards and he had had two
passes intercepted by Brown. But
when you're 21 points behind
with 1:09 remaining in the hclf,
there isn't much doubt about
what you're going to do.
Bunce dropped back to pass
and with a heavy OSU rush
breaking down his protection, he
was forced to scramble. Bunce
should've been caught a couple of
times on this busted play, but he
still was able to evade being
tackled and finally looped a pass
deep towards the Beaver goal line.
Defensive halfback Bruce Fry
was obviously as surprised as
anyone that Bunce was able to get
the pass off, and flanker John
Winesberry was able to beat him,
taking the ball in around the 20
and scoring easily. A Garcia
conversion made it 2 4 -10.
Seconds later, Merlo recovered
a successful onsides kick at the
OSU 47. But three plays later,
Bunce had a third pass intercepted
by Brown and the Beavers led at
halftime by 14. However,
Stanford had been able to get
those seven points on the
scoreboard, and after it was all
over, they seemed like a big key
to the victory. Press box observers
had been commenting on how
open Winesberry had been much
of the time, but you have to have
the ball thrown to you in order to
score.

And on that incredible broken
play, Winesberry miraculously
ended up getting the ball. After
the win, Winesberry commented
on the play. "It was a busted play.
On it, I'm supposed to streak. But
I faked an out and went straight
up after taking two or three steps
to the sideline." Somewhere along
the way Fry got lost.
"Momentum"
Momentum is a hackneyed
word which has become a classic
in the annals of sports cliches. But
if that word can be validly used, it
should be applied to the effect
that first Stanford touchdown
had. Stanford was able to go to
the lockerroom at halftime with
some regained confidence,
realizing that they could score.
Winesberry talked about his
feelings at halftime. "I never had
any doubt that we were going to
pull it out. That play raised our
morale terriffically. Everybody
got their confidence back. We
were just beating ourselves.
Everything was going to reverse
itself in the second half. At
halftime, everybody just reflected.
It never occurred in my mind that
we were going to lose."
Although it took almost all of
those 30 second half minutes to
go ahead, the reversal occurred
dramatically. Both figuartively
and literally, the sun began to
shine in Corvallis during that
second half. Losing coach Dee
"Great Pumpkin" Andros put it
this way: "We had the momentum
going in the first half, but they
took it away from us in the
second half."
On their first two second-half
drives, Stanford couldn't move
closer than the Beaver 35. But
OSU wasn't getting far either and
after being forced to punt from
their own 24 late in the third
quarter, Stanford took over on
their own 30.
The Indians lost three on a
swing pass and gained six on a run
by Reggie Sanderson. Then the
second big play of the game
occurred. From his own 33,
Bunce hit split end Miles Moore
on a post pattern at the Beaver 4 0
and Moore raced into the Beaver
end zone. The gap had been
closed to seven.
Too Many Fumbles
Soon after that, the Beavers
fumbled and Stanford had the ball
on the OSU 33. But the Beaver
defense tightened and a 46 yard
Garcia field goal attempt on the
second play of the fourth quarter
was wide.
But one again the Beavers
fumbled, to continue a trend
which led to their ultimate
downfall. Wingback Jerry
Mc√üurney lost the ball at his own
46.
A pass to Winesberry, a run by
Jackie Brown and two keeps by
Bunce moved the Indians to a first
and goal at the two yard line.

Brown went up the middle to the
one and on the next play, he went
up the middle into the end zone
to make it 24-23 with 8 :41 to go.
Ralston said that in that
situation he would usually go for
the one point conversion since
there were more than six minutes
left. But this time he gambled,
and for the moment he lost.
