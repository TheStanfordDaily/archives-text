# Poloists Assured Of NCAA Berth
## 
### DOUG WILSON 
A strong showing against
UC-Santa Barbara and a repeat
victory over USC highlighted
Stanford's water polo weekend,
and assured the Indians of a spot
in the NCAA tournament at Long
Beach later this month. The
weekend wins also gave Coach Jim
Gaughran's varsity team a strong
psychological boost for this
week's all-important action
against Pacific-8 leader UCLA,
whom the Indians host Saturday
morning at 10 a.m.
The 8-6 victory over Southern
California marked the Trojans'
second straight defeat at the
hands of the Stanford poloists,
who were led in this effort, as in
the last, by Rick Massimino, and
who received surprisingly strong
support from a handful of junior
players. Massimino put four of
Stanford's eight goals past the
USC defense, while Indian goalie
Pete Gadd, instrumental in
Friday's victory, managed to
block two Trojan penalty shots.
The other four Stanford goals
were provided by Bill Simpkins,
Mark Van Brussel, Greg Loitz and
Rob Wooley.
A key factor in the.outcome of
the game was effective ball
control on the part of the Indians.
The Stanford poloists continually
forced the Trojans into foul
situations, resulting in 44 USC

fouls, as compared with
Stanford's 23.
The victory was clinched in the
final quarter with goals by
Massimino and Van Brussel, who,
along with Stu Rowe and Bob
Warren, effectively replaced
Simpkins and Mike Davis,
removed from the game on major
foul counts.
Stanford's victory Friday
afternoon followed a relatively
easy 12-8 defeat of
non-conference opponent
UC-Santa Barbara. Massimino,
Loitz and Wooley each managed
three goals, with the remaining
three provided by Van Brussel,
Rowe and Randy Wilkins.
With Southern Cal now
twice-defeated by the Indians, and
UC-Berkeley barred from
post-season NCAA competition,
Stanford now sits in second place
in Pacific-8 standings. UCLA,
undefeated in regular season
competition, will attempt to
maintain its unblemished record
this weekend in what shapes up as
a battle for the Pac-8
championship and a preview of
things to come at Long Beach
three weeks hence.
