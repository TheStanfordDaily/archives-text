# Franklin Testifies In Own Defense As End Of Hearing Approaches
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
Closing arguments in the Franklin
case are expected by the end of this
week, but a decision in the
unprecedented hearing may be well
over a month away.
Advisory Board Chairman Donald
Kennedy said last night, "There is no
way we could have a decision before
three weeks and it will probably be
substantially longer."
Kennedy explained the three-week
minimum is based on the Board's
schedule for submission of final
arguments in the dismissal hearing of
Associate English Professor H. Bruce
Franklin.
The Board ruled Saturday that the
administration and Franklin will each
be given up to four hours at the end of
this week to present oral arguments on
the four charges against Franklin. The
arguments will come after one or two
more days of witnesses for Franklin
and several days of rebuttal testimony
for each side.
The Board will also give each side a
week to prepare "supplementary
written briefs" after receiving a
complete transcript of the case. That
process should take more than two
weeks because preparation of the
transcript has been running up to ten
days behind the hearing.
Analysis
Kennedy said the Board will begin
to analyze "the data" in the case but
will not reach any conclusions before
studying the written briefs.
Franklin himself took the stand for
the second time Friday, testifying
about the Computation Center
occupation, Feb. 10. Franklin is
charged with inciting the protest in a
White Plaza speech then inciting
resistance to a police dispersal order

outside the computer facility.
The revolutionary professor said his
White Plaza speech was an attempt to
formulate what Chairman Mao calls the
"mass line" taking the "unsystematic
ideas of the masses" and concentrating
them. He said "the masses" then can
make their own decision on what
tactics to use.
Decision Made
Franklin testified that a "mobile
strike" beginning at the Computation
Center had already been "resolved and
decided" when he spoke.
Franklin said that during the
occupation of the Computation Center
he sat and talked on the lawn outside.
After routing protesters from the
building, police ordered the crowd
outside to disperse. Franklin said he

was "very concerned and apprehensive
and angry at the arbitrary order."
He said he was certain the police in
riot gear intended to charge those
remaining on the lawn. And he said
demonstrators were not dispersing
although many onlookers had started
to leave.
Confrontation
Franklin said he wanted to prevent a
confrontation and went forward to talk
to police official Donald Tamm, with
whom he had negotiated in other
situations. Other faculty members were
leaving when they should have stayed
to prevent confrontation, Franklin said.
He testified that he shouted to
Graduate Dean Lincoln Moses and
hoped to "kind of shame him into
doing what he ought to do."

He added, "1 at no time incited
anyone not to leave this area except for
Lincoln Moses."
While he argued with Tamm, a
sheriff's deputy shouted, "Let's get
him," according to Franklin.
Attempted Grab
He said two policemen then pushed
forward to grab him. Franklin said he
pulled his arm out of the grasp of a
black-gloved policeman, then fellow
revolutionaries "spun me around and
threw me back."
Two Hour Talk
Franklin's testimony Friday lasted
more than two hours. At one point, he
smiled and called himself a "windbag."
Just as administration lawyer
Raymond Fisher began to
cross-examine Franklin, a guerilla
theater group burst into the room with
a satire of the police dispersal order.
The Advisory Board and
administration lawyers walked out
during the brief disruption. When the
Board returned, Kennedy angrily
adjourned the hearing an hour early. He
said the skit provided a "very selective
advantage" to Franklin by interrupting
the administration's questioning.
In cross-examination Saturday,
Fisher repeatedly asked Franklin what
tactics he expected demonstrators to
use when he joined in advocating a
protest at the Computation Center.
Thinking Goals
Franklin answered that he had been
thinking only about the goals of the
strike when he made his speech. "I

really hadn't been thinking about the
whole question of tactics," he insisted.
Franklin conceded it was
"obviously" possible the demonstrators
would block doorways or sit-in.
Fisher charged that during the rally
Franklin yelled "shut it down" several
minutes after his speech. Frnaklin said
he believed someone else made the
comment.
Fisher asked Franklin about a
comment in his speech that off-campus
protesters appreciate the chance to do
"material damage" at Stanford.
Franklin said the statement was a
general "description of fact."
Ex-Student Testifies
Bruce Doering, who was a student at
the time, testified Friday that Franklin
argued with police at the Comp Center
"to see that the police didn't just

charge and smash everybody's head, as
they ultimately did."
Doering said he thought Frnaklin
was "an utter madman" to approach to
police after being "ripped off" at a
Redwood City demonstration several
weeks before.
Franklin's defense—which has
already called 70 witnesses—moved
Saturday to the final charge against
him, inciting violence in a nighttime
speech at the Old Union, Feb. 10.
Five witnesses all said that Franklin
was urging diverse tactics rather than
mass confrontation with riot police.
And all five said they went back to talk
with students in dormitories after the
rally.
Junior Testifies
Bill Faulkner, a junior, said he and
three brothers went to the rally

together. Faulkner testified that
Franklin's disputed speech came when
"the rally was about to break up.
Everyone had their coats on already."
His twin brother, Pat, testified that
Franklin was "trying to bring the
movement together." Asked about
Franklin's reference to "people's war,"
Faulkner said it meant that the antiwar
movement "had to include all the
people."
Graduate student Jim O'Fallon
characterized Franklin's speech as
"primarily allegorical."
Chuck Karish, an unemployed
gardener, said that Franklin did not
speak through the bullhorn which some
speakers used.
'Affinity Groups'
Karish testified that he and others
joined their "affinity groups" as they
left the rally. He said the groups served
to protect people from possible police
attacks.
Karish said the rally that night
"never could be called lethargic" and
that the atmosphere was "tense and
cold."
Franklin co-counsel Merle Rabine
took the stand and said he was a
lookout, watching maneuvers of police
in riot gear near the Old Union rally.
Newsman Testifies
KZSU newsman Marty Rubenstein
testified that from KZSU's vantage
point on a balcony overlooking the
rally it was "impossible to tell what was
going on" when a microphone at
ground level was turned off. The mike
was not on during Franklin's speech
because KZSU was interviewing a gorup
of demonstrators.
Rubenstein's testimony challenges
two administration witnesses who said
they heard Franklin's speech from the
KZSU booth.
Franklin's voice can be heard
indistinctly in the background on tapes
of the KZSU interview. Kennedy
announced Friday that sound
technicians working on the tape have
been unable to make the speech
audible.
The hearing continues today at 1
p.m. in Physics 101.
