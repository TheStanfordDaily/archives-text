# Franklin Testifies In Own Defense As End Of Hearing Approaches
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
Closing arguments in the Franklin
case are expected by the end of this
week, but a decision in the
unprecedented hearing may be well
over a month away.
Advisory Board Chairman Donald
Kennedy said last night, "There is no
way we could have a decision before
three weeks and it will probably be
substantially longer."
Kennedy explained the three-week
minimum is based on the Board's
schedule for submission of final
arguments in the dismissal hearing of
Associate English Professor H. Bruce
Franklin.
The Board ruled Saturday that the
administration and Franklin will each
be given up to four hours at the end of
this week to present oral arguments on
the four charges against Franklin. The
arguments will come after one or two
more days of witnesses for Franklin
and several days of rebuttal testimony
for each side.
The Board will also give each side a
week to prepare "supplementary
written briefs" after receiving a
complete transcript of the case. That
process should take more than two
weeks because preparation of the
transcript has been running up to ten
days behind the hearing.
Analysis
Kennedy said the Board will begin
to analyze "the data" in the case but
will not reach any conclusions before
studying the written briefs.
Franklin himself took the stand for
the second time Friday, testifying
about the Computation Center
occupation, Feb. 10. Franklin is
charged with inciting the protest in a
White Plaza speech then inciting
resistance to a police dispersal order

outside the computer facility.
The revolutionary professor said his
White Plaza speech was an attempt to
formulate what Chairman Mao calls the
"mass line" taking the "unsystematic
ideas of the masses" and concentrating
them. He said "the masses" then can
make their own decision on what
tactics to use.
Decision Made
Franklin testified that a "mobile
strike" beginning at the Computation
Center had already been "resolved and
decided" when he spoke.
Franklin said that during the
occupation of the Computation Center
he sat and talked on the lawn outside.
After routing protesters from the
building, police ordered the crowd
outside to disperse. Franklin said he

was "very concerned and apprehensive
and angry at the arbitrary order."
He said he was certain the police in
riot gear intended to charge those
remaining on the lawn. And he said
demonstrators were not dispersing
although many onlookers had started
to leave.
Confrontation
Franklin said he wanted to prevent a
confrontation and went forward to talk
to police official Donald Tamm, with
whom he had negotiated in other
situations. Other faculty members were
leaving when they should have stayed
to prevent confrontation, Franklin said.
He testified that he shouted to
Graduate Dean Lincoln Moses and
hoped to "kind of shame him into
doing what he ought to do."

He added, "1 at no time incited
anyone not to leave this area except for
Lincoln Moses."
While he argued with Tamm, a
sheriff's deputy shouted, "Let's get
him," according to Franklin.
Attempted Grab
He said two policemen then pushed
forward to grab him. Franklin said he
pulled his arm out of the grasp of a
black-gloved policeman, then fellow
revolutionaries "spun me around and
threw me back."
Two Hour Talk
Franklin's testimony Friday lasted
more than two hours. At one point, he
smiled and called himself a "windbag."
Just as administration lawyer
Raymond Fisher began to
