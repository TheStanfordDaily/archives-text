Foreign Aid Cut
WASHINGTON - The Nixon
administration hopes to bounce back
from a Senate vote to kill the
foreign-aid program by winning
congressional passage of stop-gap
legislation and then enacting a brand
new aid bill.
White House officials said yesterday
President Nixon wants aid continued in
a coordinated way and has no intention
of seeking piecemeal supplemental
appropriations to continue one or
another section of the aid effort.
In the absence of congressional
action by Nov. 15, the big Agency for
International Development would shut
down for lack of funds to pay its
employees.
America Leaving
SAIGON — The U.S. command
announced yesterday the deactivation
of one of its two remaining combat
divisions in Vietnam and the cutback of
nearly 3 ,000 more troops.
A communique from the
headquarters of Gen. Creighton W.
Abrams said that eight more Army
units with 2,890 men had been phased
out of the war zone, dropping U.S.
strength to slightly below 200,000. All
the units are either part of the Americal
Division or support it.
Its inactivation will leave only the
U.S. 101st Airborne Division in
Vietnam. And it is expected to begin
phasing out by early next year.
Welfare—reform
WASHINGTON — Senate action on
welfare-reform legislation now has been
put over until 19 72 and there is doubt
the bipartisan coalition backing it can
hold together in a national election
year.
Senate Democratic Leader Mike
Mansfield had persistently scheduled
the bill for action this year, declaring
President Nixon is entitled to a vote on
his top priority recommendation. The
House passed it June 22 .

But Mansfield had to concede last
week that it now is impossible for the
Senate to act on the measure this year.
Supporters of welfare reform believe
that the timing is all-important. They
fear the measure's chances may
diminish next year the closer the floor
debate gets to the national nominating
conventions and the presidential
campaign.
Belfast Bomb
BELFAST, Northern Ireland —
Guerrillas ambushed British army
patrols in Northern Ireland yesterday,
wounding two troopers, after a
weekend of sniping and bombing that
left two persons dead.
The two soldiers were hit by the
same bullet in an ambush in the
Springhill area of Belfast.
A 4 0-pound gelignite bomb, one of
the biggest yet discovered in the years
of sectarian violence in the province,
was found in a tavern in Belfast's
Roman Catholic area of
Andersonstown.
Bastard Day
TEL AVIV — A National Bastard Day
is being prepared by Israeli
anticlericalists to dramatize their
struggle against what they term
religious coercion. The event is
scheduled for Nov. 9.
The title of National Bastard Day
was chosen in honor of Jews born out
of wedlock who are unable to marry in
Israel because of the state rabbinate's
monopoly on marriage.
Disneyland Mishap
ANAHEIM — Three riders on
Disneyland's roller coaster-like ride, the
Matterhorn, suffered minor burns when
imitation snow caught fire and caused
molten fiberglass to drip onto them,
officials reported yesterday.
The fire was quickly extinguished by
an automatic sprinkler system, a
spokesman for Disneyland said.

scheduled for Nov. 9.
The title of National Bastard Day
was chosen in honor of Jews born out
of wedlock who are unable to marry in
Israel because of the state rabbinate's
monopoly on marriage.
Disneyland Mishap
ANAHEIM — Three riders on
Disneyland's roller coaster-like ride, the
Matterhorn, suffered minor burns when
imitation snow caught fire and caused
molten fiberglass to drip onto them,
officials reported yesterday.
The fire was quickly extinguished by
an automatic sprinkler system, a
spokesman for Disneyland said.
Foreign Aid Cut
WASHINGTON - The Nixon
administration hopes to bounce back
from a Senate vote to kill the
foreign-aid program by winning
congressional passage of stop-gap
legislation and then enacting a brand
new aid bill.
White House officials said yesterday
President Nixon wants aid continued in
a coordinated way and has no intention
of seeking piecemeal supplemental
appropriations to continue one or
another section of the aid effort.
In the absence of congressional
action by Nov. 15, the big Agency for
International Development would shut
down for lack of funds to pay its
employees.
America Leaving
SAIGON — The U.S. command
announced yesterday the deactivation
of one of its two remaining combat
divisions in Vietnam and the cutback of
nearly 3 ,000 more troops.
A communique from the
headquarters of Gen. Creighton W.
Abrams said that eight more Army
units with 2,890 men had been phased
out of the war zone, dropping U.S.
strength to slightly below 200,000. All
the units are either part of the Americal
Division or support it.
Its inactivation will leave only the
U.S. 101st Airborne Division in
Vietnam. And it is expected to begin
phasing out by early next year.
Welfare—reform
WASHINGTON — Senate action on
welfare-reform legislation now has been
put over until 19 72 and there is doubt
the bipartisan coalition backing it can
hold together in a national election
year.
Senate Democratic Leader Mike
Mansfield had persistently scheduled
the bill for action this year, declaring
President Nixon is entitled to a vote on
his top priority recommendation. The
House passed it June 22 .

But Mansfield had to concede last
week that it now is impossible for the
Senate to act on the measure this year.
Supporters of welfare reform believe
that the timing is all-important. They
fear the measure's chances may
diminish next year the closer the floor
debate gets to the national nominating
conventions and the presidential
campaign.
Belfast Bomb
BELFAST, Northern Ireland —
Guerrillas ambushed British army
patrols in Northern Ireland yesterday,
wounding two troopers, after a
weekend of sniping and bombing that
left two persons dead.
The two soldiers were hit by the
same bullet in an ambush in the
Springhill area of Belfast.
A 4 0-pound gelignite bomb, one of
the biggest yet discovered in the years
of sectarian violence in the province,
was found in a tavern in Belfast's
Roman Catholic area of
Andersonstown.
Bastard Day
TEL AVIV — A National Bastard Day
is being prepared by Israeli
anticlericalists to dramatize their
struggle against what they term
religious coercion. The event is
scheduled for Nov. 9.
