### ED KOHN TONY BOLLEN Special to the Daily 
TOURS, France, Oct. 26—The uproar resulting from the
late-September arrest of former Stanford-in-France student
Christine Corcoran on hashish smuggling charges appears to
have ended, at least insofar as American students and
campus administrators are concerned.
However, in recent weeks, Tours police, aided by the
national police, have detained or arrested more than
100—and possibly as many as 200—young French people
on suspicion of using or dealing drugs, primarily hashish or
LSD. No other Americans have been implicated.
Most of those arrested so far have been released into
their parents' custody, and few are expected to stand trial.
Police have also closed several cafes where alleged sales of
drugs have taken place.
The police have told Prof. Paul LeMoal, director of the
French campus, that they know and have photographs of
some 30 Europeans who have either visited at length or
stayed at the Tours campus and have been arrested for drug
usage or dealing. One such person was arrested Friday on
charges of stealing from students in Group XXII.
'Superior Hash'
Corcoran, a 19-year-old sophomore, was arrested here
September 24 and charged with trafficking and possession
of large amounts of hashish. At the time of her arrest,
police say they found between 300 and 400 grams of
"superior" hashish in her possession.

As earlier reported in The Daily, the Tours residence was
under 24-hour police surveillance, possibly for several
months, prior to the Corcoran arrest.
Another confrontation with French drug-enforcement
officials was narrowly avoided last weekend after seven
students returning from weekend visits to Amsterdam were
stopped and searched as they were leaving the Tours train
station. None had any drugs, however, and according to
LeMoal, the matter is now considered closed by French
authorities.
LeMoal said the students were stopped and searched
after the police department had been falsely tipped off that
one of the students would be smuggling drugs on "either
Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday night." Two of the
students were stopped early Monday morning and the
remaining five early Tuesday morning.
To The Station
The five stopped early Tuesday morning were taken in a
paddy wagon to the police station and searched there. No
charges were ever lodged against the students. LeMoal said
he was reasonably sure of the informant's identity and that
the campus administration was continuing its investigation.
Corcoran faces a possible jail sentence of 2-10 years
and/or a fine , ranging between $1,000 and $1,000,000.
[Students here have estimated her potential profit at about
$30,000. |
After her arrest, Corcoran allegedly signed a confession
in which she named some 20 other persons as drug users or
dealers and admitted smuggling about 20 kilograms of
hashish into France. Her confession apparently brought the
first round of arrests nearly two weeks ago; the other
arrests have followed in a "snowball" fashion.
"L'affaire Corcoran," as the Tours incident is known in
France, has drawn little response from the Stanford
administration other than a memo from the Overseas
Campuses Office banning Corcoran from all overseas
campuses. Her whereabouts at the present time are
unknown to officials here, although they assume she is
traveling through Europe, since she is prohibited from
returning to the United States.
Trial Delayed
Her trial, originally slated for Dec. 11, has been delayed
at least until after Christmas.
The police have charged that Corcoran was part of a
major "web" that was supplying Tours, a city of nearly
100,000, with much of its hashish. They claim that this
longstanding "web" has now been broken decisively with
the arrests of Corcoran and a local bartender, whom the
police charge bought large amounts of hashish from
Corcoran and resold to young people throughout the Tours
region.
Overseas campus officials here acknowledged that the
Corcoran case is the most serious such situation to have
occurred close to one of the campuses. However, Dr.

Robert A. Walker, program director, emphasized that there
has been "no suggestion" of closing the Tours facility.
Even if closure were to be considered, he went on, there
would be considerable negotiation before such an action
would be taken by French police.
Considerable Warning
According to Walker and Assistant Directors Corb Smith
and Mrs. Hersche Allen, students receive considerable
warning concerning overseas drug policies before they reach
their campuses. Additional instruction in foreign drug laws
is part of orientation given students upon arrival after
which, officials say, the students are more or less on their
own; University officials will not intrude if a student is
busted.
Instead, campus directors attempt to prevent arrests.
"If there is evidence of use," Dr. Walker said, "usually
the student involved will be talked to immediately"
concerning potential risks to themselves and to the campus.
Directors are empowered to remove students from
campuses if they deem it necessary.
Although Chris Corcoran was not a student at the time
of her arrest, officials say the campus was under
surveillance when she was there because Tours police knew
the facility contained a major supplier. The surveillance
culminated in Corcoran's arrest after she left the campus
and was returning to Tours from Amsterdam.
Dr. Walker said the campus is not now under tight
surveillance, and imposition of such surveillance is
considered unlikely.
