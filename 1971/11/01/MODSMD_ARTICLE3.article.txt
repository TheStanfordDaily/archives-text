TOURS, France, Oct. 26—The uproar resulting from the
late-September arrest of former Stanford-in-France student
Christine Corcoran on hashish smuggling charges appears to
have ended, at least insofar as American students and
campus administrators are concerned.
However, in recent weeks, Tours police, aided by the
national police, have detained or arrested more than
100—and possibly as many as 200—young French people
on suspicion of using or dealing drugs, primarily hashish or
LSD. No other Americans have been implicated.
Most of those arrested so far have been released into
their parents' custody, and few are expected to stand trial.
Police have also closed several cafes where alleged sales of
drugs have taken place.
The police have told Prof. Paul LeMoal, director of the
French campus, that they know and have photographs of
some 30 Europeans who have either visited at length or
stayed at the Tours campus and have been arrested for drug
usage or dealing. One such person was arrested Friday on
charges of stealing from students in Group XXII.
'Superior Hash'
Corcoran, a 19-year-old sophomore, was arrested here
September 24 and charged with trafficking and possession
of large amounts of hashish. At the time of her arrest,
police say they found between 300 and 400 grams of
"superior" hashish in her possession.

As earlier reported in The Daily, the Tours residence was
under 24-hour police surveillance, possibly for several
months, prior to the Corcoran arrest.
Another confrontation with French drug-enforcement
officials was narrowly avoided last weekend after seven
students returning from weekend visits to Amsterdam were
stopped and searched as they were leaving the Tours train
station. None had any drugs, however, and according to
LeMoal, the matter is now considered closed by French
authorities.
LeMoal said the students were stopped and searched
after the police department had been falsely tipped off that
one of the students would be smuggling drugs on "either
Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday night." Two of the
students were stopped early Monday morning and the
remaining five early Tuesday morning.
To The Station
The five stopped early Tuesday morning were taken in a
paddy wagon to the police station and searched there. No
charges were ever lodged against the students. LeMoal said
he was reasonably sure of the informant's identity and that
the campus administration was continuing its investigation.
Corcoran faces a possible jail sentence of 2-10 years
and/or a fine , ranging between $1,000 and $1,000,000.
