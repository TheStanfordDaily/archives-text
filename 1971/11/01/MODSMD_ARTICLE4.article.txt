## Lyman Defends Recruiting Policy 
### GARY ATKINS 
President Richard Lyman last night
defended the University's policy of
allowing military and defense industry
recruiting on campus, saying it would
be impractical for the University to
attempt to evaluate several hundred
corporations on the basis of moral
feelings.
In a KZSU debate with Larry
Diamond, ASSU co-president, and
Rochelle Marshall, a member of the
Community Women for Peace, Lyman
responded to charges of "hypocrisy"
and failing to keep "good faith with the
student body" by saying the ASSU
Council of Presidents had made a
complex issue appear simple and had

then launched a "highly emotional,
rhetorical attack" against the
administration.
The ASSU Council of Presidents
along with several other organizations,
is coordinating demonstrations this
week against recruiters from the U.S.
Navy and Air Force and eight large
defense contractors. Picketing in front
of the placement center was scheduled
to begin this morning.
The council says that such
on-campus recruitment violates two
student referendum proposals passes
last spring. One would "prohibit the
use of Stanford lands for military
service recruiting": the other, for
recruiting "by corporations that are
directly producing material and
research for the military."
Prepared Statement
In a prepared statement, Diamond
accused Lyman of "hypocrisy" for
urging students to work for change
through legitimate channels and then
ignoring student opinion when it
conflicted with administrative opinion.
Lyman, in his statement, responded
that the ASSU had made a complex
issue appear simple rather than
attempting to help work out practical
difficulties involved in any exclusion of
military or corporate recruiters.
He said that the issue had been
referred to the Committee on Student
Services last Spring, and that COSS had
been unable to reach any final
conclusions. However, he said, the
committee had intended to resume its
study this fallâ€”but the ASSU has not
yet appointed student members.
"Pending its final report," Lyman
said, "COSS recommended that the
open recruiting policy should be
retained. Insofar as the administration
has any official advice from any official
channel, that's it."
'Practical Problems'
Lyman also argued that there were
practical problems in attempting to

apply any moral criteria in determining
which corporations would be allowed
to recruit on campus.
"How are conflicting moral feelings
to be resolved?" he asked. "How many
major corporations have managed to
avoid involvement" with government?
"What tripartite committee would care
to take on the task of competent, fair
evaluation of 200 to i,OO
corporations?"
One of the apparent practical
difficulties only briefly mentioned by
Lyman in response to a question dealt
with the possible loss of research funds
if military recruiters are barred from
campus. According to last year's
defense authorization bill, NASA
cannot sponsor new research at any
non-profit institution barring military
recruiters, unless such research is
viewed as essential. Lyman mentioned
that such stipulations were attached to
NASA contracts but did not elaborate.
Aiding And Abetting
In her prepared statement, Marshall
argued that by allowing military and
defense industry recruiters on campus,
"Stanford is aiding and abetting
agencies" participating in "unspeakable
brutal crimes" in Indochina.
She argued that banning such
recruiters would not interfere with
anyone's freedoms or rights.
"Placement interviews are a
convenience," she said, "not a right.
And it's a convenience enjoyed by a
few at the hideous expense of
thousands of others in the world."
In the debate following the prepared
statements, Diamond argued that
students should be allowed to set
policies controlling those services, such
as placement, that affect only them.
He said that as far as the ASSU
Council of Presidents was concerned,
last spring's referendum had established
student policy in the area of recruiting
and it was the ASSU's intention to
implement that policy.
