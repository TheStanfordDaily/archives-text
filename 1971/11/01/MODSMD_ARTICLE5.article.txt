# Ecology Cashes In On Sale Of Basement Treasures
## 
### JONATHAN DEDMON Commentary 
The Conservation Group had a rummage sale and
auction Saturday that would have mady the Salvation
Army jealous.
The group collected everything left in a dormitory
basement since 1955 and piled it on the lawn
between Stern and Wilbur in a tower of junk that
resembled some Fort Knox of Goodwill Industries.
And about 350 scrounging people turned up,
turned over, and turned through warped tennis
rackets, dirty bras, bikinis, baseballs, bicycles, old
love letters, and you name it. The you-name-its went
for a quarter a piece.
There were some great finds like a pair of Fisher
skis.
Bad Finds
And there was stuff that obviously could have
stayed in the basements such as a tube of Crest
toothpast with fluoristan that someone had squashed
into the asphalt or Steve Polmar's Bio 11 notebook
from 1967 with illegible scribblings about mycelium
and ascogonium.
And then there were those dirty bras.
In some real e-college-v it was the Administration
who started the whole idea, turning over their
basementloads of abandoned stuff to the
conservation people. After all, what does Dick Lyman
want with dirty bras?
Stacey Fitzsimmons, a co-president of the
Conservation Group and one of the sale-auction
organizers, estimated that the affair netted about
$1,300 which will be used to help the Stanford
environment.
Stuff
Saturday's sale lasted from noon to 2:00 p.m. and
all stuff was divided into three parts: a pile of stuff

for free, a pile for 10 cents, a pile for a quarter, and
then the pile the Conservation people were raking in.
Some women from Palo Alto, apparent veterans of
many a rummage sale campaign, commented that
most items were really underpriced.
Fitzsimmons agreed commenting, "There were
some real steals."
Stacey figures that people ripped off about one
third of the goods there.
One real find was when Dave Patterson turned up
some unprintable poems in a box from 1967. From
what Dave could tell the author was apparently an
anally-fixated paranoid sex maniac
Dental Floss
One of the less anally oriented poems began "there
coming after me with ten thousand yards of dental
floss."
At 2:00 p.m. the auction started led by
Coors-sipping Jim Baer largely unknown and
unpoverty-stricken after having run the Daily
classified ads for the past two years.
One of the first items to go were two lovely plastic
bushes in a box with a fake parrot.
Chris Ryan, the junior who acquired this prize for
$5.25 and obviously a brilliant interior decorator,
said he was going to use his purchase "to make my
room look likeoutside."
Herbert Hoover
One of the more esthetic items sold was an oil
painting which Baer described as a "portrait of
President Herbert Hoover "
Based on the lack of anything but pubic hairs in
the crotch and the large size of the breasts, my own
conclusion was that it was a nude girl on a couch.
With some art auctioneering talent that would give
Cristy's of London wet dreams, Baer sold this
masterpiece for three dollars.

Dale Snape, the buyer, said he was pleased with his
purchase since "I've been searching for this genre for
a long time and 1 know the artist well."
Tax Deductible
Snape added that he would donate the painting to
the Arroyo Lounge Gallery so that he could take it
off his taxes "to put me in a better bracket."
But not all items were bargains.
A comforter went for $5.75.
Baer commented about it, "Somebody's dog is
going to be real happy."
A friend of the girl who bought it charitably
described it as "a rag."
Most Expensive
The most expensive item sold was the Fisher skis
for $59. The least expensive was an oil painting of a
hot rod that went for 25 cents to some kid.
And it was the kids who monopolized the bicycle
sales, thanks alot to the crowd.
Any older person trying to outbid them quickly
drew hostile shouts.
One of the most exciting parts of the day was the
sale of locked trunks full of unknown goodies.
Finders Keepers
A man who bought one for under 10 dollars
found three sports a leather coat, Wallace
bumper stickers. ocJ a mysterious bag of blue
homemade capsules
Cowell Health Cer-'cr reported today that he is in
"good condition" atW police last night arrested him
on top of the post office where he reportedly
identified himself to officers as "The Giant Orange."
He was treated at the Health Center for scalp
wounds he received when he pulled out his hair in an
unsuccessful effort to peel himself.
