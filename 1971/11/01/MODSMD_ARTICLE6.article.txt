## Stanford Racism No Surprise 
### 
Stanford bsu

Although the Black
community was disappointed with
the negative outcome of last
week's student vote on the
Minority Affairs referendum, we
must admit, in all honesty, we
were not surprised. The history of
Black students at Stanford has
prepared us for this negative
reaction on the part of white
students.
Early in 1969, because of the
blatant racist conditions on the
Stanford campus, Black students
had to take direct actions against
that racism. Those actions were
culminated in the Bookstore
incident. The general reaction on
the part of whites here was that
they did not take issue with
our cause, but rather the manner
after which we pursued that
cause.
The following fall, to the relief
of a great many white people on
campus, the BSU became actively
involved in a "legitimate" area of
power. Nine Black students ran
for seats in the ASSU Senate and
six were elected. Even though
Black students had this limited
amount of success, Black student
leaders at the time knew that if
Blacks became too successful in
using these "legitimate" channels
of power, the white community
would eventually take steps to
eliminate our effectiveness.
This did happen beginning with

the successful adoption of a
by-law which provided a
limitation on the amount of
student funds to be allocated to
any single student organization
(no matter how great the need).
Needless to say, the reason this
particular by-law was introduced
was solely to frustrate the efforts
of the BSU. There was a growing
fear that BSU had priorities for
student funds other than Spring
Sing or the Big Game Bonfire.
At this point, forces within the
student body government moved
toward a lower student body fee
assessment. This stood in stark
contrast to the abundance of
funds made available through
ASSU before Black students
became actively involved. This
manifested itself with the
adoption, on the part of a
majority of the student body, of
the $1.00 fee, the lowest in ASSU
history.
What was happening was a
battle between different sets of
student priorities. The more
representative type of Stanford
student not only did not like the
fact that what was once his own
private domain, student
government, was being partially
controlled by Blacks. But even
more evident to the white student
was the fact that Blacks had
different priorities than the whites
active in student body politics.

Therefore it was not only the
issue of racism but also issues such
as minority cultural programs vs.
Axe Comm, Day Care Centers vs.
Cardinals Board, etc.
The next measure of control
which a small faction of the white
student body leaders attempted to
force upon Blacks in student
government was the introduction
of a new system of budget
allocation. Instead of going
through the student Senate,
(which has very extensive
mechanisms for analyzing needs
of the various student
organizations and for distributing
the funds), this faction proposed a
very inoperative mechanism for
dealing with the question. It was a
selfish mechanism to bypass the
"legitimate" body (in which Black
students participated) at the
expense of not only Blacks, but
also other student organizations.
The mechanism developed on the
part of these few white students
was to make up a budget for the
student organizations which they
thought were "fit" to receive
funds. No consultation was made
as to need or inclusion of any
organization.
However, this plan to take the
decision-making power out of a
body which, under the ASSU
Constitution, has the proper
authority to allocate moneyâ€”this
plan was augmented by another

proposal which called for
complete elimination of student
body funds. This $0 fee referenda
was passed by an overwhelming
number of the student body last
spring.
At this point, it is easy to see
how racism spawns an inefficient,
cumbersome, inoperative system
in the South, (i.e. separate
facilities for Blacks and whites)
and how it results also in the same
kind of inefficiency here at
Stanford through the inoperative
and costly system of direct
allocation through general
election. As a result, the students
are paying the same, in terms of
fees, that they would have paid by
voting money to the Senate, and
yet supporting only a mere three
student organizations.
The target of the $0 fee,
according to many whites was the
student Senate and not Black
participation in the Senate. In our
eyes, the real target was not the
Senate in general, but Black
power in the Senate in particular.
Therefore, Black students and
other minority groups on the
campus decided to separate the
issue of the activities of the

student Senate from the
important issue of minority needs
on the Stanford campus. It was
clearly an opportunity for the
students of this campus to put
themselves on record, once and
for all with no obfuscation, as to
whether or not they were in favor
of minority programs.
Predictably, the white student
body clearly displayed its
collective racism by voting down
the minority affairs referendum.
At this point we can reaffirm the
truth expressed both in the
reservations on the part of Black
student leaders three years ago,
and Malcolm's statement, "When
you play the white man's game,
and win, he changes the rules."
But what is more important
than the past individual actions is
what those actions mean
collectively. What does it mean
when a white student body votes
money for the band and not for
other kinds of programs?
The important result has been
a positive result, not a negative
one. It has drawn us, the Balck
community, closer together; and
it has reaffirmed our old
convictions concerning the white
community.
