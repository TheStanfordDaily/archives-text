## Self-Centered Mentality 
###

Racism at Stanford—a topic discussed widely
three or four years ago, solved and set aside.
However, something happened to that "solution"
last week, and the campus can't understand how
student concern was so "misrepresented" in the fee
assessment referendum.
The fee assessment defeat leaves no question that
personal racism is alive and growing on campus. To
refuse to support groups because one will not
benefit directly from their actions reflects the same
self-centered mentality which has pushed aside the
needs of poor and minority peoples throughout
American History. Yet these same students who
deny "legitimate" channels of action to third world
groups, because they cannot support programs with
which they are not involved, are outraged when
violence does involve them with minority actions.
Personal forms of racism, which are at the least
becoming more vocal, are underscored by
institutional racism. Although there are many
incidents of the latter, I would like to focus on the
one with which I am familiar. In the last issue of
The Real News, Dr. Drake mentioned the difference
in campus reaction to two classes focusing on racial
issues.
The first was Cedric Clark's Psych 80 Class,
"Race, Communication and Behavior," which he
opened by stating that it was designed primarily for
blacks. Dr. Clark was called before his own Dean,
the Dean of Humanities and Sciences, and the
Ombudsman, as well as threatened with a suit from
a student.

At the same time the Program on Urban Studies
designed a winter quarter course focusing on white
understanding and action on white racism. The
course, which will be sponsored by Drake, was listed
as designed primarily for whites. There was no
reaction to the class until the Clark question arose.
At that time two worried calls came in—worried
that another Psych 80 incident might arise, not
worried about the class.
Last year Urban Studeis offered another course
"White Action Responses to Racism" and the
English Department listed English 1 section 9, in
"Approaching Stanford," as designed primarily for
white students. No questions were raised about
either course.
In the four years since Martin Luther King's
assassination, minority visibility and audibility on
campus have increased. Black plays, bi-lingual
tutoring, occasional lists of demands, and the liberal
sits back complacent. Things have improved, and
watching Ole Miss crowds waving Dixie flags on TV
football we are happy because Stanford, with all its
problems, is a better place than most.
But when a black class and a white class receive
completely incomparable reactions, is it possible to
say there is no racism at Stanford? And lest you
dismiss this as institutional racism over which you
have no control—how can the private, personal
racist decisions which defeated the fee assessments
be justified, or the complacency with which many
didn't bother to vote?
