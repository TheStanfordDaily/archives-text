## Legitimacy And Militancy

the black family

The Black Students
Union at Stanford had its
beginnings in 1966 & '67 when
Black Students first started to
come to Stanford in large
numbers. The Union emerged out
of the efforts of both Black
athletes and a concentration of
Black women in Roble Hall. This
impetus led to an organization
that was mainly social in nature
but was founded on the basis of
racial solidarity. At this time the
leaders were such well-known
athletes as Gene Washington and
Art Harris.
The assasination of Dr. King in
April of '68 signalled a new era in
Balck consciousness and activity.
His murder precipitated an
activity which is generally
regarded as the first "militant"
activity of the BSU at Stanford.
During the campus wide memorial
service several Black students
marched on stage and took the
microphone from President
Sterling. They read a statement
which included a list of BSU
demands. Kenny Washington,
Charles Countee and Frank
Salterwhite were some of the
leaders at this time.
The demands were generally
accepted by the University
administration but by the
following February it was obvious
that the University had no
intention of fulfilling their
promises. Concurrently a
professor in the school of
education, Dr. Koff, grossly
insulted a Black woman who was
applying to Education's S.T.E.P.
program. These two forces led to

a new set of BSU demands.
President Pitzer was caught by
Black students hiding behind a
curtain at the Faculty club. His
obstinate refusal to discuss with
Black students their demands led
to the Bookstore incident and the
administration agreeing to the
new set of demands.
The next two years were spent
expanding and developing the
programs won by earlier Black
leaders. Political activity was for
the most part limited to exploring
the "legitimate channels of
change." (see accompanying
article). However, during last year,
two things became crystal clear:
President Nixon has created an
atmosphere where racism once
again has become the accepted
norm in the country. At the same
time, the general lack of political
activity across the country was
being interpreted as the sign by
racist white leaders to cut back

and eliminate hard-won black
program.
Stanford was no exception to
the national model. By the end of
last spring, Black students had
again artiuclated a set of demands
and were actively prusuing these
demands. While negotiating a
section of the demands in the
employee section of the
document, members of the Black
community were caught in the
Stanford Hospital police-riot. By
the end of the year, one section of
the demands had been completely
negotiated, and progress was being
made on the other parts.
This summer saw a complete
administration reversal on some
areas of negotiation. At the same
time, it was recognized that the
needs of the Black community
were not being articulated and
pursued as effectively as
necessary.

The Black Family was seen as a
vehicle by which the resources
and people of the entire Black
community could work together
to meet the needs of our
community. In the year 1971,
unity and self-determination are
the key to progress. To deal with
an increasingly hostile national
and local atmosphere, we must
use all the resources and personnel
at our disposal. As Malcolm said
"it is time to go behind closed
doors and talk shop and emerge
with an united front."
Once again we find it necessary
for the entire Black community to
get together and deal with our
situation. It is in this spirit
the Black Family calls a
university-wide moratorium to
involve the entire Black
community and vows not to
emerge until we have agreed upon
a common course of action.
