# Future Alternatives For Campus Police Studied
## 
### LANG ATWOOD First of two-parts 
"One security force in any
community should handle both police
service duties and law-enforcement
duties," begins the final report of the
Presidential Commission on the Status
of the Stanford Police.
This basic premise is supported by
University officials, Stanford Police
Chief Marvin Herrington and Santa
Clara Sheriff James Geary. The
question remaining is which agency is
going to be the "one security force"?
No one knows at this time, although
a decision will probably be reached
around the first of the year. In the
meantime the campus police are caught
in the middle, unsure of their future
status, and the community is generally
confused.
Four years ago, Stanford had a small
(29-man) police force and the campus
crime rate was relatively low. The
campus police handled police service
duties and patrolled the campus in cars
and on foot.
The Sheriff's department was called
to investigate felonies and make arrests,
while the California Highway Patrol
investigated personal injury traffic
accidents. Neither the CHP or the
Sheriff had regular patrols on the
campus, however.
Crime Rate Doubles
Today, the same basic arrangements
exist, but in a different atmosphere.
The crime rate has doubled in the last
four years and disturbances and riots
have escalated to violent levels.
The campus police force has grown
to almost 5 0 men but still lacks the
peace officer status that would enable
them to conduct investigations and
make arrests.
The uncertain role of the University
police was one of the factors that led to
the resignation of former chief Tom
Bell last April. Bell advocated full peace
officer status for the department at a
time when the university was still
unsure of its position.
More Sheriff's Patrols
The Sheriff's department tried to fill

the need for better police service by
establishing regular patrols on campus
last spring. However, because the
Stanford "beat" also includes Barron
Park, an unincorporated area on the
other side of the industrial park, there
are still times when there are no
Sheriff's units on campus.
About the same time as Sheriff's
patrols were increased the University
had a bill introduced in the State
Assembly that would have given the
Stanford department full police
powers.
The bill was opposed by the Sheriff,
who felt it would be unwise to have a
department with peace officer status
that was not directly accountable to
any elected official or body. The ASSU
also opposed the bill, fearing that
University officials setting policy for
the police might not be responsive to
the community.
University officials refuted these
charges by pointing out that under the
bill, the department would have been
responsible to the State Attorney
General (an elected official) and would
operate under state law and the normal
checks of the judicial system.
Nevertheless, when opposition
became apparent, the Assembly bill was
withdrawn by its sponsor and
discussions began between the
University and the Sheriff's office. The
bill reportedly stands little chance of
being passed if reintroduced.
Three Alternatives Studied
That left three basic alternatives:
create a separate police district for
Stanford; deputize some of the campus
police so they would have peace officer
powers; or have the University pay for
a certain number of regular deputies to
police the campus under a contract
arrangement.
With a police district the police
department would be controlled by a
commission elected by the voters of the
district, and could come close to being
a "community controlled" department.
A number of obstacles apparently
have taken the police district
alternative out of contention.

The Presidential Commission and a
law school professor have pointed out
that there is no way to finance such a
district. The faculty residential area
would bear the entire burden of
taxation. This would not be a sufficient
base to support the services Stanford
needs according to the Commission.
The Commission also points out that
both the Local Agency Formation
Commission (LAFCO) and the Santa
Clara County Board of Supervisors
would have to be satisfied that there is
no other method of providing the
desired service. Since both the Sheriff's
department and the University oppose
the police district, it is doubtful if it
would gain the approval of the Board
of Supervisors.


PROTECTING THE COMMUNITY—Campus residents have the benefit of both Santa Clara County Sheriff and Stanford
Police patrols. The University is seeking peace officer status for some of its men in an effort to consolidate police and law
enforcement work in one agency.
