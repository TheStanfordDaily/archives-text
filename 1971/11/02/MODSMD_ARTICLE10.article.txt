## Pakistan Versus India 
### 
There is a lot of pollution in
the world today. In the past few
months, a lot of material has been
published on Pakistan, most of it
fit for the garbage can and not
worth bothering about. A most
recent example of this was, for
instance, a "stupid" article
entitled "Stupid theories:
Pakistan and Power Politics."
I would like to tell Mr. Dastur
and the Daily's readers, that it is
not Pakistan, but India which is
a medieval, theocratic and
intolerant country. I am sure that
you are all aware of the caste
system which exploits the lower
classes.
Non-Brahmans are not only
second or third class citizens, but
the dreadful plight of
untouchables is very well known.
Would you call a country
medieval, theocratic and
intolerant when it has no caste
system and where history shows
that in the last twenty-four years
there have been no religious
clashes, or a country where
Muslims are being butchered
whenever fanatic Hindus feel like
it. Muslims of India forming 12%
of the population have no more
than one per cent of the civil
service positions in India.
Mr. Dastur has made some very
sweeping statements which have
absolutely no foundation. Among
these he claims that Pakistan has
laid claims on various chunks of
India. There has already been

quite a lot written about the
Hyderabad, Junagadh, Kashmir
and Kutch crisis, and I would
refer the readers of the Daily to
this. In any case, the refusal of
India to hold a plebiscite in
Kashmir is well-knownâ€”this in
spite of U.N. resolutions urging
India to allow the people of
Kashmir to exercise their basic
human rights of self-determina
tion. Also, Sheikh Abdullah, the
Kashmiri leader, has languished in
Indian jails for a period of several
years and bears eloquent
testimony to the "modern, secular
and paternalistic" rule of the
Indians.
You must be aware that
Pakistan was a member of SEATO
and CENTO alliances, of which
the USA is also a member.
According to the treaties signed,
the USA was supposed to help
Pakistan, when she was attacked
by an enemy power. Instead, the
USA put an embargo on arms to
Pakistan. Pakistan never got any
arms from the USA since 1965,
apart from some spare parts,
which were bought and paid for
by Pakistan.
India has used the excuse of
"Chinese aggression" to get arms
from the USA, Russia and Britain.
It has recently been found that

India had perhaps played a major
role in provoking the 1962 crisis
with China, and as the former
British prime minister once
bitterly remarked, the western
powers have been fooled into
supplying a lot of arms to Indian.
How can Pakistan commit
aggression against the Indians who
have a huge Air Force, Army and
Navy? It is estimated that the
Indian armed forces have a
superiority of over 3 to 1 over the
armed forces of Pakistan. In
addition, India has several jet
fighter assembly plants (e.g. MIG
21 from the Soviet Union)
ammunition and tank factories.
Pakistan does not manufacture
any arms apart from perhaps the
simplest type of small arms.
Pakistan is struggling for its
very survival, and has gone
through a civil war recently. It has
very many problems to solve and
these are increasingly being made
difficult to solve by the hostility
of the Indians. If the Indians
would stop harassing Pakistan and
try to live as good neighbours, I
am sure, that a lot of imaginary
problems which Indians like to
talk about would be automatically
solved.
