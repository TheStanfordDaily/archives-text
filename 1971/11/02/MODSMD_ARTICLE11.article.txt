## Help Our Balancing Act 
### 
Since everyone knows that the Stanford Daily is
a left-liberal-radical-rag, we thought it would be a
good time to lift the wraps from our edit page
policy, and let the world in on a big secret.
The truth is (and I know this is hard to believe,
but would I lie to you?) our Opinions Editor is
convinced that he biases his page towards the right.
Why does he make such a statement, when anyone
can plainly see that the Daily is as left-liberal as,
well, say CBS News, for example.
He says this because every day the poor fellow
has to sift through dozens of letters and columns
submitted to his desk by members of the Stanford
community. The vast majority of the submitted
columns are written from a left-of-center viewpoint,
and since the harrassed editor is under a strict
mandate from the Daily Editorial Board to "keep
the page balanced," he finds that he must reject
more than half of the left-leaning material, and
accept virtually all of the right-wing submissions.
And that's why he thinks that he biases his page
to the right. If he accepts almost every conservative
article submitted for publication, and rejects half of

the liberal or radical pieces, isn't he exhibiting
right-wing bias?
If the logic of this argument appeals to you, and
you would like to help the Editor (and the Daily)
out of this predicament, here's what you can do: If
you are a conservative, why not put your thoughts
down on paper and send them to us. We are hungry
for a conservative view-point; we would like to see
conservatives raise issues. Material should be typed
on a 60-space line, double-spaced, with the author's
name and telephone number written on the top of
each sheet. The shorter the article, the sooner it can
be run. Two or three typed pages is usually good for
a start.
Of course, this doesn't mean that you shouldn't
write for us if you're not a conservative. We
welcome opinions from all sides of the political
spectrum. But if you have never written before, and
feel that you would like to give the Daily a bit more
balance, go ahead. We're waiting.
For more information, call The Daily at
321-2300, ext. 4632, and ask for the 'Opinions
Editor. (Steven Ungar is a member of the editorial
