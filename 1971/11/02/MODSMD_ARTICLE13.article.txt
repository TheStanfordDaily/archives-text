# Lyman Says Restraint Needed In American Business Policies
## 
### 
Greater self-restraint in politics
and advertising could help restore
student confidence in American
business, President Richard W.
Lyman of Stanford said Saturday,
Oct. 30.
In remarks prepared for
delivery at alumni day of the
Graduate School of Business,
Lyman said executives should not
expect "professional image
makers" to do this job.
"Campaigns designed to show
how much business cares about
anything under the sun but profits
are not only of limited
us e 112 u 1 n e s s â€” th e y are
counter-productive if they strike

sophisticated students as glaringly
hypocritical," he explained.
"I do not mean that advertising
is unimportant. Truth-in
advertising can help a lot to
restore confidence in business."
While Stanford is not a
business, he noted, the literature
now sent prospective students
points out that "Stanford does
not have everything, that for some
people it would be the wrong
choice of college, and that any
institution can be expected to
have the defects of its virtues."
"A certain amount of
self-deprecating humor doesn't
hurt, either," Lyman added.
