# 'Caesar and Cleopatra'
## Excellent ACT Opening Show 
### JOSEPH FIKSEL 
(In the desert stands the
Sphinx, motionless and timeless.
And beneath its protective
shadow lies a sleeping Egyptian
beauty, a young girl of sixteen.
Then a lone stranger enters upon
the scene, greeting the Sphinx as
one immortal would another. The
man is Julius Caesar, Emperor of
Rome. The girl is Cleopatra,
Queen of the Nile.)
This is George Bernard Shaw's
dramatic vision of one of the most
famous encounters in man's
history. The characters of his
play, "Caesar and Cleopatra,"
belong as much to our era as to
that of antiquity, and he lifts
them neatly from their historical
context to meet freely and
naturally in this forsaken spot.
The clever old warrior and the
nubile young coquette are
charmed with each other.
Cleopatra fears the coming of
Caesar, the awesome conqueror,

unaware that her new-found
companion is that very man. But
Caesar, discovering her identity,
persuades her to face the intruder
with queenly courage.
When Roman soldiers enter the
palace, and greet their general
with a proud "Hail Caesar!,"
Cleopatra realizes who he is, and
collapses into his arms in grateful
relief.
So begins the American
Conservatory Theatre's first play
of the new season. And so begins
a paradoxical yet wonderful,
relationship—between maturity
and youth, between wisdom and
innocence. In an excellent,
well-balanced production,
director William Ball and his
superlative cast portray this
relationship with humor and
realism.
Abridging Shaw's text to an
easy, lively pace, spicing it with
occasional modern allusions and
one-line witticisms, they make the
play as timely and engaging today
as it was at the turn of the
century, when it was written.
Comic Allegory
"Caesar and Cleopatra" is a
comic allegory, exploring the
nature and destiny of man with
gentle irony. Caesar came to
Egypt in pursuit of his foe,
Pompey, who has been slain.
Because of his fascination with
young Cleopatra, he becomes
involved in the dispute between
her and her ten-year-old brother,
Ptolemy, for the throne.
The veteran statesman and
soldier, Caesar, displays a kindly
and disarming approach toward all
people and all situations. With a
boyish irreverence for the pomp
and protocol of the Egyptian
court, he takes the quarreling
siblings under each arm, and
remonstrates then like an
instructive parent.
But the political situation
becomes more tense, fighting
flares up, and Caesar's two legions
are threatened with destruction
by the Egyptians. Distracted by
games and banter with Cleopatra,
Caesar makes light of most
crisises. His casual confidence is
justified when Roman
reinforcements appear, and once
again he emerges the glorious
victor.
As he bids his final farewell to
Cleopatra, he promises to send her
a younger, stronger Roman, the
heroic Mark Antony, for whom

Cleopatra has long harbored a
child-like crush. The ACT thus
invokes the sequel to this story,
Shakespeare's "Antony and
Cleopatra," which opens tonight
as the second production of their
season.
Consistent Performances
Without a doubt, the strength
of the production lies in the
imaginative, consistent
performances of the two main
characters, who counterpoint each
other perfectly. Through Shaw's
perspective, the traditional
notions of Cleopatra as a
seductress and Caesar as a tyrant
are ignored. They are simply two
exceptional, very human beings,
drawn together by sincerity and
awareness. There is scarcely a
breath of sexual contact between
them—they are more like an
infatuated father and daughter.
As Julius Caesar, Peter Donat
has just the right mixture of
authority and candor. Worshipped
by his friends, feared by his
enemies, and favored by the gods,
he has risen above the ordinary
levels of human experience. His
insight is always profound; his
direct, uninhibited manner strikes
to the heart of life. In fact, he
seems the progenitor of Shaw's
fictional "superman" (not to be
confused with Clark Kent.)
Yet Caesar is more humane and
compassionate than any, for he
has transcended punishment,
revenge, and judgment.
Remarkably enough, he is
simultaneously humble and
infallible. His one important
desire is to illuminate for others
the truths that he has glimpsed.
With blazing intensity, he censures
Cleopatra for perpetrating a
senseless assassination, issuing a
warning that rings loudly in our
twentieth-century ears:
"And so, to the end of history,
murder shall breed murder, always
in the name of right and honor
and peace, until the gods are tired
of blood and create a race that
can understand."
Royal Adolescent
Cleopatra is played by petite
Lee McCain, who is masterful as a

royal adolescent discovering her
womanhood. Awed and intrigued
by the omniscient Caesar, she
becomes his ardent pupil and
imitator. A playful, petulant
nymph in the first act, she
emerges in the second act as a
thoughtful young queen. But
ambition and feminine jealousy
surface within her, causing murder
and tragedy to mar her idyllic life
with Caesar.
As the play draws to a close we
see that Cleopatra cannot share
Caesar's godliness; she must
inevitably fall back into the
mortal cycle of pain, pleasure, and
lust. As Caesar embarks upon his
voyage, she has already returned
to girlishness, forgetting that she
is in mourning for the death of
her maidservant, swooning instead
over dreams of Mark Antony.
Shaw is not at all reluctant to
sweep across the centuries in his
comments on human civilization.
Indeed, there is a second
dimension to the dichotomy of
old and new represented by
Cleopatra and Caesar.
Cleopatra is a scion of the old
world, of an Egypt whose values
and traditions are anchored firmly
in the ancestral past, whose
dynasties of pharaohs have
succeeded one another with slow,
methodical certainty.
Caesar's arrival disrupts this
world, for he manifests the forces
of change. In one highly symbolic
scene, Caesar is unconcerned
about the burning of the library
of Alexandria. Accused of
destroying the past, he retorts:
"Ay, and I will build the future
with its ruins."
So in the end, Caesar has been
interpreted as a classical
revolutionary spirit, guided by a
philosophy of simplicity and
humanism, overthrowing a
decadent, anachronistic
establishment. (May our own
revolution by equally successful)
This might appall historians, but it
will surely tickle a great many Bay
Area theatre-goers.
