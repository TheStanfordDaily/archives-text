# Brilliant Van Cliburn Piano Artistry Highlights Oakland Symphony Concert
## 
### KITTY PATTERSON 
World-renowned pianist Van
Cliburn gave another brilliant
performance Thursday night at
the Oakland Auditorium. His
mastery of technique and
interpretation surpassed that of
most of his contemporaries.
The Oakland Symphony
Orchestra, conducted by Harold
Farberman, backed Cliburn up in
Tchaikovsky's piano Concerto No.
1 in B-Flat Minor Opus 23.
"Backed up" can be the only
words to describe them. It was
definitely Cliburn's show. He, not
Mr. Farberman, controlled the
orchestra. If he had been up on
the conductor's podium, instead
of in front of it, he couM not have
led them better.
The Tchaikovsky starts with
the famous thunderous theme one
hears on so many 1940's movies.
From there, it dissolves into the
first piano cadenza, a maze of
runs and arpeggios. Cliburn played
the runs with a clarity that he did
not always have in previous years.
Yet the intensity and strength
with which he has always played
were still there, augmented by his
improved technique.
Cliburn was especially good on
the myriad runs up and down the
keyboard, where most people's
fingers have a tendency to get
completely tangled. He always
arrived decisively at the top of a
forte phrase. Sometimes he
followed Tchaikovsky's little
"surprises," as in one passage
where he ran up the keyboard in a
vivid crescendo, only to
decrescendo rapidly after he
arrived.
Subtle Rubatos
In the more peaceful parts,

Cliburn achieved a flowing
melodic line, tempered with just
enough rubato. On the whole, his
rubatos were subtle, intense
enough that you had to notice
them, but not overdone.
There were a number of
passages where Cliburn played in a
harp-like tone under a statement
of the theme by a piccolo. In
another passage, Cliburn's right
hand maintained a feathery-toned
trill high in the treble while his
left hand introduced a singing line
which grew into a powerful
interplay of high notes and
thunderous bass chords.
Cliburn also masterfully traded
off intertwined melodies, first
letting the bass theme have the
spotlight, and then subordinating
it to the trebie melody. Finally,
he incorporated both melodies in
a skillful interplay, emphasizing
first one, then the other, then
both simultaneously.
The orchestra complemented
Cliburn well, for the most part.
Several times, they drowned him
out, but luckily, whenever Cliburn
had the main statement, they
backed down. The best passages in
which the orchestra took a
little—not much—of the attention
away from Cliburn came when
they had the melody, traded it off
among themselves, and then let
Cliburn take over.
Standing Ovation
Cliburn played so well that the
audience broke tradition: it burst
into applause after the first
movement. He received a standing
ovation at the end.
Mr. Cliburn was born in
Shreveport, La. Until he went to
Julliard in 1951, his only teacher
was his mother, a fine pianist in

her win right. He made his debut
at the age of 12, playing this same
concerto with the Houston
Symphony Orchestra. He has
received innumerable awards.
Most notably, he was the first
American to win the Tchaikovsky
Competition in Moscow in 1958.
He has been touring ever since.
Apparently, Mr. Cliburn hasn't
been home often enough to taste
his mother's home cooking.
Always tall and thin, he now
looks positively cadaverous. But
he plays better now than he ever
did before; maybe starvation is
good for the soul.
Symphony Less Impressive
When the Oakland Symphony
Orchestra stands alone, it
sometimes falls on its face. It
performed two pieces, Haydn's
Symphony No. 12 in E Major, and
Sibelius' Symphony No. 2 in D
Major Opus 43. The Haydn
started out terribly. The French
horn was off tune. The two oboes
were on two different pitches, and
the violins were separated from
the winds by several vibrations
more than an octave. Mr.
Farberman did not allow enough
time for the audience to catch its
breath between the theme and the
development in the first
movement. The orchestra hardly
paused at all.

Sibelius wrote vitality into his
symphony. It was the horns and
woodwinds of the orchestra who
were able to retain that vitality.
Occasionally, the violins and
basses returned to the wooden
tone of the Haydn.
Sibelius' piece is inherently
melodic and emotional. It is filled
with brilliant crescendos and
fortes, which the orchestra
performed quite well. Underneath
most of the more intense, loud
passages, the kettle drum rolled
ominously. Several times, this
drum roll accompanied a smooth,
sonorous bassoon solo which
came over very well.
It seemed that whenever a
member of the orchestra was
allowed a free hand on a melodic
line, the result was lovely. But
when everyone played together,
the orchestra was not always
well-synchronized. Especially in
the rapid-fire runs where all the
strings played in unison, there
were occasional "fuzzy" passages
when all the notes ran together.
But the fault was still there. The
Sibelius ended with a rich forte
with everyone playing a strong
major chord over a drum roll: a
most impressive ending, the type
that makes almost anyone sound
good.

Major Opus 43. The Haydn
started out terribly. The French
horn was off tune. The two oboes
were on two different pitches, and
the violins were separated from
the winds by several vibrations
more than an octave. Mr.
Farberman did not allow enough
time for the audience to catch its
breath between the theme and the
development in the first
movement. The orchestra hardly
paused at all.

Sibelius wrote vitality into his
symphony. It was the horns and
woodwinds of the orchestra who
were able to retain that vitality.
Occasionally, the violins and
basses returned to the wooden
tone of the Haydn.
Sibelius' piece is inherently
melodic and emotional. It is filled
with brilliant crescendos and
fortes, which the orchestra
performed quite well. Underneath
most of the more intense, loud
passages, the kettle drum rolled
ominously. Several times, this
drum roll accompanied a smooth,
sonorous bassoon solo which
came over very well.
It seemed that whenever a
member of the orchestra was
allowed a free hand on a melodic
line, the result was lovely. But
when everyone played together,
the orchestra was not always
well-synchronized. Especially in
the rapid-fire runs where all the
strings played in unison, there
were occasional "fuzzy" passages
when all the notes ran together.
But the fault was still there. The
Sibelius ended with a rich forte
with everyone playing a strong
major chord over a drum roll: a
most impressive ending, the type
that makes almost anyone sound
good.
World-renowned pianist Van
Cliburn gave another brilliant
performance Thursday night at
the Oakland Auditorium. His
mastery of technique and
interpretation surpassed that of
most of his contemporaries.
The Oakland Symphony
Orchestra, conducted by Harold
Farberman, backed Cliburn up in
Tchaikovsky's piano Concerto No.
1 in B-Flat Minor Opus 23.
"Backed up" can be the only
words to describe them. It was
definitely Cliburn's show. He, not
Mr. Farberman, controlled the
orchestra. If he had been up on
the conductor's podium, instead
of in front of it, he couM not have
led them better.
The Tchaikovsky starts with
the famous thunderous theme one
hears on so many 1940's movies.
From there, it dissolves into the
first piano cadenza, a maze of
runs and arpeggios. Cliburn played
the runs with a clarity that he did
not always have in previous years.
Yet the intensity and strength
with which he has always played
were still there, augmented by his
improved technique.
Cliburn was especially good on
the myriad runs up and down the
keyboard, where most people's
fingers have a tendency to get
completely tangled. He always
arrived decisively at the top of a
forte phrase. Sometimes he
followed Tchaikovsky's little
"surprises," as in one passage
where he ran up the keyboard in a
vivid crescendo, only to
decrescendo rapidly after he
arrived.
Subtle Rubatos
In the more peaceful parts,

Cliburn achieved a flowing
melodic line, tempered with just
enough rubato. On the whole, his
rubatos were subtle, intense
enough that you had to notice
them, but not overdone.
There were a number of
passages where Cliburn played in a
harp-like tone under a statement
of the theme by a piccolo. In
another passage, Cliburn's right
hand maintained a feathery-toned
trill high in the treble while his
left hand introduced a singing line
which grew into a powerful
interplay of high notes and
thunderous bass chords.
Cliburn also masterfully traded
off intertwined melodies, first
letting the bass theme have the
spotlight, and then subordinating
it to the trebie melody. Finally,
he incorporated both melodies in
a skillful interplay, emphasizing
first one, then the other, then
both simultaneously.
The orchestra complemented
Cliburn well, for the most part.
Several times, they drowned him
out, but luckily, whenever Cliburn
had the main statement, they
backed down. The best passages in
which the orchestra took a
little—not much—of the attention
away from Cliburn came when
they had the melody, traded it off
among themselves, and then let
Cliburn take over.
Standing Ovation
Cliburn played so well that the
audience broke tradition: it burst
into applause after the first
movement. He received a standing
ovation at the end.
Mr. Cliburn was born in
Shreveport, La. Until he went to
Julliard in 1951, his only teacher
was his mother, a fine pianist in

her win right. He made his debut
at the age of 12, playing this same
concerto with the Houston
Symphony Orchestra. He has
received innumerable awards.
Most notably, he was the first
American to win the Tchaikovsky
Competition in Moscow in 1958.
He has been touring ever since.
Apparently, Mr. Cliburn hasn't
been home often enough to taste
his mother's home cooking.
Always tall and thin, he now
looks positively cadaverous. But
he plays better now than he ever
did before; maybe starvation is
good for the soul.
Symphony Less Impressive
When the Oakland Symphony
Orchestra stands alone, it
sometimes falls on its face. It
performed two pieces, Haydn's
Symphony No. 12 in E Major, and

Several times, they drowned him
out, but luckily, whenever Cliburn
had the main statement, they
backed down. The best passages in
which the orchestra took a
little—not much—of the attention
away from Cliburn came when
they had the melody, traded it off
among themselves, and then let
Cliburn take over.
Standing Ovation
Cliburn played so well that the
audience broke tradition: it burst
into applause after the first
movement. He received a standing
ovation at the end.
Mr. Cliburn was born in
Shreveport, La. Until he went to
Julliard in 1951, his only teacher
was his mother, a fine pianist in

her win right. He made his debut
at the age of 12, playing this same
concerto with the Houston
Symphony Orchestra. He has
received innumerable awards.
Most notably, he was the first
American to win the Tchaikovsky
Competition in Moscow in 1958.
He has been touring ever since.
Apparently, Mr. Cliburn hasn't
been home often enough to taste
his mother's home cooking.
Always tall and thin, he now
looks positively cadaverous. But
he plays better now than he ever
did before; maybe starvation is
good for the soul.
Symphony Less Impressive
When the Oakland Symphony
Orchestra stands alone, it
sometimes falls on its face. It
performed two pieces, Haydn's
Symphony No. 12 in E Major, and
Sibelius' Symphony No. 2 in D
Major Opus 43. The Haydn
started out terribly. The French
horn was off tune. The two oboes
were on two different pitches, and
the violins were separated from
the winds by several vibrations
more than an octave. Mr.
Farberman did not allow enough
time for the audience to catch its
breath between the theme and the
development in the first
movement. The orchestra hardly
paused at all.

Sibelius wrote vitality into his
symphony. It was the horns and
woodwinds of the orchestra who
were able to retain that vitality.
Occasionally, the violins and
basses returned to the wooden
tone of the Haydn.
Sibelius' piece is inherently
melodic and emotional. It is filled
with brilliant crescendos and
fortes, which the orchestra
performed quite well. Underneath
most of the more intense, loud
passages, the kettle drum rolled
ominously. Several times, this
drum roll accompanied a smooth,
sonorous bassoon solo which
came over very well.
It seemed that whenever a
member of the orchestra was
allowed a free hand on a melodic
line, the result was lovely. But
when everyone played together,
the orchestra was not always
well-synchronized. Especially in
the rapid-fire runs where all the
strings played in unison, there
were occasional "fuzzy" passages
when all the notes ran together.
But the fault was still there. The
Sibelius ended with a rich forte
with everyone playing a strong
major chord over a drum roll: a
most impressive ending, the type
that makes almost anyone sound
good.
World-renowned pianist Van
Cliburn gave another brilliant
performance Thursday night at
the Oakland Auditorium. His
mastery of technique and
interpretation surpassed that of
most of his contemporaries.
The Oakland Symphony
Orchestra, conducted by Harold
Farberman, backed Cliburn up in
Tchaikovsky's piano Concerto No.
1 in B-Flat Minor Opus 23.
"Backed up" can be the only
words to describe them. It was
definitely Cliburn's show. He, not
Mr. Farberman, controlled the
orchestra. If he had been up on
the conductor's podium, instead
of in front of it, he couM not have
led them better.
The Tchaikovsky starts with
the famous thunderous theme one
hears on so many 1940's movies.
From there, it dissolves into the
first piano cadenza, a maze of
runs and arpeggios. Cliburn played
the runs with a clarity that he did
not always have in previous years.
Yet the intensity and strength
with which he has always played
were still there, augmented by his
improved technique.
Cliburn was especially good on
the myriad runs up and down the
keyboard, where most people's
fingers have a tendency to get
completely tangled. He always
arrived decisively at the top of a
forte phrase. Sometimes he
followed Tchaikovsky's little
"surprises," as in one passage
where he ran up the keyboard in a
vivid crescendo, only to
decrescendo rapidly after he
arrived.
Subtle Rubatos
In the more peaceful parts,

Cliburn achieved a flowing
melodic line, tempered with just
enough rubato. On the whole, his
rubatos were subtle, intense
enough that you had to notice
them, but not overdone.
There were a number of
passages where Cliburn played in a
harp-like tone under a statement
of the theme by a piccolo. In
another passage, Cliburn's right
hand maintained a feathery-toned
trill high in the treble while his
left hand introduced a singing line
which grew into a powerful
interplay of high notes and
thunderous bass chords.
Cliburn also masterfully traded
off intertwined melodies, first
letting the bass theme have the
spotlight, and then subordinating
it to the trebie melody. Finally,
he incorporated both melodies in
a skillful interplay, emphasizing
first one, then the other, then
both simultaneously.

Cliburn well, for the most part.
Several times, they drowned him
