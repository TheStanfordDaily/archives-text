Judge Okays Atomic Blast
WASHINGTON - A federal judge turned aside for the
second time yesterday attempts by environmentalists to
halt a giant underground nuclear explosion set to go off
within days on a remote Alaskan island.
U.S. District Court Judge George L. Hart Jr. ruled that
seven organizations headed bv the Committee for Nuclear
Responsibility failed to prove that the government did not
adequately consider potential environmental dangers of the
blast on Amchitka Island.
The conservationists said they would appeal immediately
to the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington.
The appeals court already has turned down one request
for a temporary injunction against the blast—reportedly set
to go off Thursday with the equivalent force of five million
tons of TNT.
The blast—if the Atomic Energy Commission is allowed
to proceed with it—will mark the final stage of a testing
program for the new Spartan Anti-ballistic Missile which
the Nixon administration says is needed to counter Soviet
weaponry.
Student Shot In Ohio
WILBERFORCE, Ohio — Wilberforce University closed in
mourning yesterday for a student killed by a wild bullet
fired into a crowd during a melee between students of
Wilberforce and adjacent Central State University.
Presidents and student leaders of both schools expressed
shock at the midnight incident that left Mantel Crenshaw,
22, of Canton, dead of a bullet that punctured both lungs.
Four shots were fired from one of two crowds of
students which formed after they broke up the regular
Sunday night showing of a movie on the Wilberforce
campus.
Neither the county nor university officials gave any clues
as to what precipitated the fight.

Wilberforce President Rembert Stokes said, however, it
was not related to a 10-day student boycott of classes that
ended last week when the university granted several student
demands. They included more liberal visitation rights of
male students in the senior women's dormitory,
modification of security on campus and an end to
suspensions of 43 students who took part in a dormitory
sit-in.
Tidal Wave Wrecks India
NEW DELHI — A cyclone and 16-foot tidal wave have
slammed into India's east coast, and political leaders
reported the loss of 15,000 to 20,000 lives in this latest
major natural disaster on the rim of the Bay of Bengal.
The wave and 100-mile-an-hour winds hit Friday night,
but the devastation was so complete that word of its
catastrophic proportions did not reach the outside world
until yesterday.
The Indian government radio reported a million homes
destroyed or damaged, leaving four million persons without
shelter.
Additionally, the economy of the entire eastern region
has been disrupted in the past seven months by what has
been described locally as the human tidal wave of more
than nine million refugees who have fled into India from
crisis-torn East Pakistan.
Some refugees who have been moved to Orissa from
West Bengal were among the victims of this weekend's
storm, according to the Indian radio.
African Prelate Convicted
PRETORIA, South Africa — The Anglican dean of
Johannesburg, the highest ranking churchman to tangle
with the South African government, was sentenced to five
years in prison yesterday on charges of subversion.
Justice Petrus M. Cillie imposed the term on the Very
Rev. Gonville A. Ffrench-Beytagh, 59.

for a temporary injunction against the blast—reportedly set
to go off Thursday with the equivalent force of five million
tons of TNT.
The blast—if the Atomic Energy Commission is allowed
to proceed with it—will mark the final stage of a testing
program for the new Spartan Anti-ballistic Missile which
the Nixon administration says is needed to counter Soviet
weaponry.
Student Shot In Ohio
WILBERFORCE, Ohio — Wilberforce University closed in
mourning yesterday for a student killed by a wild bullet
fired into a crowd during a melee between students of
Wilberforce and adjacent Central State University.
Presidents and student leaders of both schools expressed
shock at the midnight incident that left Mantel Crenshaw,
22, of Canton, dead of a bullet that punctured both lungs.
Four shots were fired from one of two crowds of
students which formed after they broke up the regular
Sunday night showing of a movie on the Wilberforce
campus.
Neither the county nor university officials gave any clues
as to what precipitated the fight.

Wilberforce President Rembert Stokes said, however, it
was not related to a 10-day student boycott of classes that
ended last week when the university granted several student
demands. They included more liberal visitation rights of
male students in the senior women's dormitory,
modification of security on campus and an end to
suspensions of 43 students who took part in a dormitory
sit-in.
Tidal Wave Wrecks India
NEW DELHI — A cyclone and 16-foot tidal wave have
slammed into India's east coast, and political leaders
reported the loss of 15,000 to 20,000 lives in this latest
major natural disaster on the rim of the Bay of Bengal.
The wave and 100-mile-an-hour winds hit Friday night,
but the devastation was so complete that word of its
catastrophic proportions did not reach the outside world
until yesterday.
The Indian government radio reported a million homes
destroyed or damaged, leaving four million persons without
shelter.
Additionally, the economy of the entire eastern region
has been disrupted in the past seven months by what has
been described locally as the human tidal wave of more
than nine million refugees who have fled into India from
crisis-torn East Pakistan.
Some refugees who have been moved to Orissa from
West Bengal were among the victims of this weekend's
storm, according to the Indian radio.
African Prelate Convicted
PRETORIA, South Africa — The Anglican dean of
Johannesburg, the highest ranking churchman to tangle
with the South African government, was sentenced to five
years in prison yesterday on charges of subversion.
Justice Petrus M. Cillie imposed the term on the Very
Rev. Gonville A. Ffrench-Beytagh, 59.
Judge Okays Atomic Blast
WASHINGTON - A federal judge turned aside for the
second time yesterday attempts by environmentalists to
halt a giant underground nuclear explosion set to go off
within days on a remote Alaskan island.
U.S. District Court Judge George L. Hart Jr. ruled that
seven organizations headed bv the Committee for Nuclear
Responsibility failed to prove that the government did not
adequately consider potential environmental dangers of the
blast on Amchitka Island.
The conservationists said they would appeal immediately
to the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington.
The appeals court already has turned down one request
for a temporary injunction against the blast—reportedly set
to go off Thursday with the equivalent force of five million
tons of TNT.
The blast—if the Atomic Energy Commission is allowed
to proceed with it—will mark the final stage of a testing
