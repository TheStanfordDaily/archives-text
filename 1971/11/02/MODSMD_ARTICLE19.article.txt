Chancellor of Chittagong University in the province, and
Dr. Ashabul Haque, a member of the Provincial Assembly.
On Wednesday, Nov. 3 the proceeds of a day-long fast will

It is an irony of recent history that the Middle East and
Southeast Asia have held the world's attention as trouble
spots while the Indian subcontinent has endured neglect.
Apart from its vulnerability to natural calamity,
overwhelming development problems, and communal
tensions, the area's potential for an explosion triggered by
chronic hatreds between India and Pakistan is critical.
Furthermore, Pakistan's endemic weaknesses as an artificial
state make it vulnerable to its own internal explosions.
From the start, West and East Pakistan have been
divided, not just by 1000 miles of enemy India, but by
centuries-old differences in language, culture, and
temperament which kept its peoples from understanding or
liking each other despite sharing the same religion, Islam. In
23 years of existence Pakistan never acquired a stable,
civilian, constitutional government. Economic and political
imbalances between the Eastern and Western wings present
at the time of India's partition have grown more
pronounced over the past two decades.
In recent years the East wing Bengalis (78 million in
number to the West's 57 million Punjabis, Sinds, Baluchis,
and Pathans) had become increasingly vocal in their
frustration over West wing political domination and
economic exploitation. Repeatedly, Eastern aspirations for
equality and regional autonomy—because they took the
shape of intense Bengali nationalism, because they
threatened West wing vested interests, or because they were
seen as a menace to national unity—were met with
repression by the West-controlled military.
Election Held
When Pakistani President Yahya Khan, military
successor to deposed President Ayub Khan, declared his
intention to hold the first popular elections in the
country's history, East Pakistan's Bengalis were skeptical.
One month before the scheduled elections—just a year ago
in November—a cyclone in the Bay of Bengal sent a tidal
wave roaring across thousands of miles of alluvial East
Pakistan, resulting in tremendous loss of life and livelihood.
Bengali bitterness toward the West-based regime was
aggravated by central government indifference and
opportunism in the aftermath of the disaster.
But the December elections took place. Representatives
elected to a National Assembly were to draw up a
constitution for Pakistan. East Pakistan's millions walked
quietly to the polls and cast their votes behind a single
leader, the Awami League's Sheik Mujibur Rahman, whose
party's candidates had campaigned on a six-point program
of provincial autonomy for East Pakistan.
The Awami League won 98% of the East's quota of
seats, obliterating a pre-election array of splinter parties.
Since this was 53% of the total seats for all Pakistan, the
Awami League as majority party won the right to govern
the whole country, though nearly its entire constituency
was in the East.
Assembly Boycotted
During the next two months, talks were held in the
Eastern capital between President Yahya, Sheik Mujib,and
the West Pakistani politician Bhutto, whose Pakistan
People's Party had won the next largest bloc of seats, 88 of

the remaining 144, or 28% of the total 313, and who, on
the strength of this, was proclaiming himself leader of "the
other majority."
The object of the talks was to discover points of
agreement on the framing of the constitution before the
National Assembly sat. Talks were thought to have
progressed when Bhutto precipitously announced that his
party would boycott the Assembly. This led Yahya to
postpone, for a second time, the scheduled sitting fo the
National Assembly.
Bengali Reaction
There was a spontaneous and furious reaction from the
East's Bengali population. Their leader, Sheik Mujib,
responded by calling a week-long general strike culminating
in his now-famous March 7 Race Course Speech in which,
contrary to speculation, he did not call for independence
but demanded an end to martial law and transfer of power
to the elected representatives of both wings. He launched a
non-violent non-cooperation movement in the East during
which the entire province, in unprecedented unity, moved
according to his directives and ignored new martial law
orders from the West.
Yahya came once again to the Eastern capital for
renewed talks with Sheik Mujib, and West Pakistan political
leaders including Bhutto joined them. By the morning of
March 21 newspapers were proclaiming that progress
toward a compromise was being made, and by the morning
of March 25, headlines trumpeted "Time for
Announcement." In the night of that same day the army
was ordered to "do their duty."
Crackdown Replaces Compromise
The sudden crackdown, coming in the early hours of the
very day that announcement of a compromise had been
expected, caught the unarmed population all over the
province completely by surprise. Exactly when the final
decision for a military crackdown was taken is a matter of
debate, but observers aware of the military buildup carried
out during the 3'/2 weeks of civil disobedience while
talks—ostensibly sincere—progressed agree that the plans
had been made well in advance, and that negotiations in
this period were part of an exercise in perfidy. By March 25
there were enough troops deployed in Dacca and major
towns to strike, and Yahya and Bhutto flew to West
Pakistan.
The rest is already history. Awami League leaders,
except for Sheik Mujib who was arrested, escaped to India
and on April 17 formally declared the former province the
sovereign state of Bangla Desh.
