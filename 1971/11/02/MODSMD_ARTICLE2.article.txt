# Franklin Hearing To End Friday; Defense Expects To Finish Today
## 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
H. Bruce Franklin is expected to conclude his defense
this afternoon with the conclusion of his hearing now
scheduled for Friday.
The tentative plans for completion of the six-week-old
case came at the close of yesterday's session, when Franklin
announced he would probably rest his case today.
Administration attorney Raymond Fisher then indicated
that if Franklin ended early this afternoon he would be
able to present all his rebuttal witnesses today.
Franklin would then present his sur-rebuttal witnesses
Wednesday. This would be followed by four hours of
closing arguments by the administration on Thursday and
four hours by Franklin on Friday.
Final Decision
Advisory Board Chairman Donald Kennedy has
indicated that no final decision in the case will be reached
by the Board earlier than three weeks from Friday.
At yesterday's hearing, Franklin testified for an hour
and a quarter in his own defense about the Old Union
Courtyard rally the evening of February 10.
Franklin has been charged with inciting violence in his
second speech at that rally.
The Marxist scholar said he felt that the only tactic
being taken seriously that evening was "going to the dorms
and talking to people."
'Legitimate Tactic'
Franklin said he spoke because he felt "it was important
to explain that this tactic was as legitimate as the
self-defense of the Vietnamese people."
He said he decided to address the crowd when he "saw
the rally breaking up and people looked really
discouraged."
The suspended Melville scholar added he did not speak
in favor of violent tactics that night because of the
"saturation of pigs on campus."
"The only urging and inciting I did was for people to
teach other people in order to build a base for a strike," he
commented.
Six Witnesses
Before Franklin took the stand at the end of yesterday's

hearing, six witnesses testified that Franklin had very little
effect on the crowd at the Old Union rally, and had donr
no inciting.
ASSU Co-President Ann Kimball said she couldn't even
hear Franklin and that as the crowd left "the general
consensus was that nothing was going to happen."
Dave Walker, a sophomore, testified that "the crowd had
no particular reaction to Franklin's speech" and that in his
opinion the Marxist was saying that "people should do
what they felt in their own conscience."
Adam Bennion Jr., a law worker from Menlo Park, and
former student, described Franklin's evening speeches as a
"conciliatory effort to point out the common goals of the
rally."
Sophomore Testifies
Sophomore Tom Cummings said he hadn't heard
Franklin's speech but when he asked someone leaving the
rally what had been decided, he was told that people had
decided to go back to the dorms and and talk to others
there.
Foothill College student Cindy Karp said Franklin "had
been directing people away from violent and illegal acts."
Also at yesterday's hearing Franklin offered a show of
proof concerning acts of violence the night of the 10th on
which the administration had presented testimony.
Rebuttal Unnecessary
The Advisory Board recently said rebuttal of such
testimony by Franklin was unnecessary.
But Franklin charged that the testimony was still on the
record and could be read by President Lyman, the Board of
Trustees, or the courts.
Franklin said he was prepared to show, among other
things, that a fight after the evening rally had been
provoked by the Free Campus Movement (FCM), that the
shooting that night was more likely done by police than
movement people, and that rocks had been thrown at a
police car in response to an unprovoked police attack.
With the end of daily five hour sessions now in sight at
the close of this week, a smiling Donald Kennedy
• commented at the end of yesterday's hearing, "I can't
believe it."

With the end of daily five hour sessions now in sight at
the close of this week, a smiling Donald Kennedy
• commented at the end of yesterday's hearing, "I can't
believe it."
H. Bruce Franklin is expected to conclude his defense
this afternoon with the conclusion of his hearing now
scheduled for Friday.
The tentative plans for completion of the six-week-old
case came at the close of yesterday's session, when Franklin
announced he would probably rest his case today.
Administration attorney Raymond Fisher then indicated
that if Franklin ended early this afternoon he would be
able to present all his rebuttal witnesses today.
Franklin would then present his sur-rebuttal witnesses
Wednesday. This would be followed by four hours of
closing arguments by the administration on Thursday and
four hours by Franklin on Friday.
Final Decision
Advisory Board Chairman Donald Kennedy has
indicated that no final decision in the case will be reached
by the Board earlier than three weeks from Friday.
At yesterday's hearing, Franklin testified for an hour
and a quarter in his own defense about the Old Union
Courtyard rally the evening of February 10.
Franklin has been charged with inciting violence in his
second speech at that rally.
The Marxist scholar said he felt that the only tactic
being taken seriously that evening was "going to the dorms
and talking to people."
'Legitimate Tactic'
Franklin said he spoke because he felt "it was important
to explain that this tactic was as legitimate as the
self-defense of the Vietnamese people."
He said he decided to address the crowd when he "saw
the rally breaking up and people looked really
discouraged."
The suspended Melville scholar added he did not speak
in favor of violent tactics that night because of the
"saturation of pigs on campus."
"The only urging and inciting I did was for people to
teach other people in order to build a base for a strike," he
commented.
Six Witnesses
Before Franklin took the stand at the end of yesterday's

hearing, six witnesses testified that Franklin had very little
effect on the crowd at the Old Union rally, and had donr
no inciting.
ASSU Co-President Ann Kimball said she couldn't even
hear Franklin and that as the crowd left "the general
consensus was that nothing was going to happen."
Dave Walker, a sophomore, testified that "the crowd had
no particular reaction to Franklin's speech" and that in his
opinion the Marxist was saying that "people should do
what they felt in their own conscience."
Adam Bennion Jr., a law worker from Menlo Park, and
former student, described Franklin's evening speeches as a
"conciliatory effort to point out the common goals of the
rally."
Sophomore Testifies
Sophomore Tom Cummings said he hadn't heard
Franklin's speech but when he asked someone leaving the
rally what had been decided, he was told that people had
decided to go back to the dorms and and talk to others
there.
Foothill College student Cindy Karp said Franklin "had
been directing people away from violent and illegal acts."
Also at yesterday's hearing Franklin offered a show of
proof concerning acts of violence the night of the 10th on
which the administration had presented testimony.
Rebuttal Unnecessary
The Advisory Board recently said rebuttal of such
testimony by Franklin was unnecessary.
But Franklin charged that the testimony was still on the
record and could be read by President Lyman, the Board of
Trustees, or the courts.
Franklin said he was prepared to show, among other
things, that a fight after the evening rally had been
provoked by the Free Campus Movement (FCM), that the
shooting that night was more likely done by police than
movement people, and that rocks had been thrown at a
police car in response to an unprovoked police attack.
