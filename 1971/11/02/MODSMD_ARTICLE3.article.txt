# Racial Issues Dominate Elections
## 
### BOB BACON 
Racial issues dominate several of the
major state and local elections being
held today. Two states are picking
governors and several major cities are
choosing new mayors.
In San Francisco, voters elect a
mayor and six supervisors, and also
vote on a long list of ballot
propositions.
Eleven candidates seek the San
Francisco mayoralty. The three

front-runners are: incumbent Mayor
Joseph L. Alioto, 55, a millionaire
anti-trust lawyer and moderate
Democrat seeking his second four-year
term; Board of Supervisors President
Dianne Feinstein, 38, the most liberal
of the three; and restaurant owner
Harold Dobbs, 52, a conservative
Republican making his third bid for the
mayoralty. The race appears to be
close.
The principal issue has been Alioto's
record in office, particularly in police
matters. The challengers claim the city
is less safe than when Alioto took
office. Little mention has been made of
Alioto's federal indictment for fraud
and conspiracy arising out of an alleged
fee-splitting arrangement prior to his
taking office.
Height Limit
Most controversial of the 20 ballot
propositions is the initiative to limit all
new buildings to six stories in height,
designated Proposition 'T'.
Backers of the measure argue that
unrestricted construction of

skyscrapers is "Manhattanizing" San
Francisco and destroying the city's
fabled views of ocean and bay.
Opponents, including the Chamber
of Commerce, the three major mayoral
hopefuls, and both major newspapers,
claim that the existence of skyscrapers
keeps residential taxes down and
maintains the city's position as an
economic center.
Elsewhere, Charles Evers, Mayor of
Fayette, Mississippi, seeks to become
the first black state governor since
Reconstruction. He faces William L.
Waller, a Caucasian attorney referred to
as a "racial moderate by Mississippi
standards." White leaders are openly
unsure of the result and have been
running scared in recent days, although
observers rate Waller the clear favorite.
In Cleveland, black retiring Mayor
Carl Stokes has staked his national
political prestige on Arnold R. Pinkney,
a black man running for mayor as an
independent, in a contest with white
candidates of the two major parties.
The latter two are expected to split

most of the white vote and enable
Pinkney to win with a plurality.
Right-wingers
In Philadelphia, former Police
Commissioner Frank Rizzo, a
Democrat who calls himself "the
toughest cop in America," is expected
to defeat Republican Thacher
Longstreth. Observers expect large-scale
crossovers of liberal Democrats to
Longstreth and conservative
Republicans to Rizzo.
Congresswoman Louise Day Hicks is
battling Mayor Kevin H. White for
Mayor of Boston. A conservative
Democrat, the fiery Hicks is best
known for her vehement opposition to
school integration by busing. White, a
liberal Democrat who ran
unsuccessfully for Governor last year,
defeated Hicks for mayor in 1967.
Closer to home, Sacramento voters
are choosing between incumbent Mayor
Richard H. Marriott and Vice-Mayor
Milton McGee. Both are Democrats.
McGee hopes to become the first black
mayor of the capital city.
Kentucky's voters pick a Governor
in a contest which has seen heated
exchanges on economic issues, and has
been enlivened by the presence of
flamboyant ex-Governor A.B. "Happy"
Chandler, the conservative. Chandler,
one-time Commissioner of Baseball, is
running as an Independent. Others in
the race are Democratic Lt. Gov.
Wendell Ford and Republican attorney
Thomas Emberton.
Young Voters
Newly enfranchised young voters are
not expected to play a pivotal role in
any major contest today. In most areas,
they are not as yet registered in
proportion to their numbers.
Furthermore, no major contest presents
evidence of probable bloc voting by
youth.
