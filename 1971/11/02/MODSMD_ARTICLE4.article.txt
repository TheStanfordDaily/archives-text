# TV Free Speech Messages Sought
## 
### DAVE SPECTOR 
Members of a SWOPSI class on
public access to television have
petitioned the Federal Communications
Commission to deny the renewal of
KRON-TV's broadcast license.
The petition is part of a campaign by
the Committee for Open Media (COM)
to have the five bay area VHF
broadcasters provide access for Free
Speech Messages, 30 to 60 second spot

messages expressing controversial views
of local community groups.
These messages will be presented and
controlled by the groups, not subject to
the stations' judgments on what issues
are important.
The Committee for Open Media is a
group of faculty and students at San
Jose State, UC Berkeley, and Stanford.
A course is offered at both SJS and
Stanford on the First Amendment

access to television.
The petition seeks a public
examination of KRON-TV's
performance since its license expired in
1968. It also charges that "KRON-TV's
failure to provide access to community
spokesmen constitutes grounds for
consideration of a license denial."
COM has also petitioned to deny
KPIX-TV's license as it "has failed h
serve the most vital need of a
democratic society, the need for free
speech and public debate."
KPIX-TV stated "because of
inherent limitations on broadcast
facilities, no special group or individual
has an absolute right to air a particular
view when he chooses."
Debbie Majetles, SWOPSI instructor,
concedes, "the FCC will not bring the
petitions to hearings; it would change a
lot of its basic rules and the FCC won't
unless forced by the courts."
Limited Success
The Committee has had limited
success. KGO-TV agreed to broadcast
the Free Speech messages for a 90 day
trial period beginning in January, but
has retained responsibility for
presentation of opposing viewpoints. It
will not object simply because the
views are controversial.
Since KTVU-TV already presents a
substantial amount of public affairs
broadcasting, no petition was filed.
COM is negotiating with KNTV and has
filed a petition requesting an extension
of the deadline for license challenges.
The Free Speech Messages are a new
phenomenon. Groups previously
attempted to influence broadcasting;
community groups would bp actually
programming under this system. If the
number of requests outnumber the
time allotments, preference will be
given to spokesmen who bring
petitions.
