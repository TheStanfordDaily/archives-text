# Protest DOD Contracts
## Coalition Pickets Placement Office 
### DAVID THIEMANN 
Students, faculty and members of
the Stanford Community Women for
Peace picketed the Placement Center
yesterday in response to recruiting
activities by defense-oriented industries
and armed forces.
A mid-day rally, which attracted
about 300 people, heard speeches by
ASSU co-president Larry Diamond,
Lenny Seigal, Jim Shoch, and Dave
Josephson, and others, all of whom
criticized the University "open
recruiting" policy in harsh terms.
About 20 people formed a casual,
lounging picket group in front of the
placement office from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.
yesterday. This activity will probably
continue for the remainder of the
week.
A leaflet signed by the ASSU
Council of Presidents and Columbae
House asserted that the decision of the
student body to bar recruiters from
campus, voiced in a referendum passed
last spring, is "being blocked by a small
minority."
In his speech, Diamond argued that
the "administration shouldn't be

intimidated by any corporation or
federal institution," even if threatened
with the loss of funds.
Section 510 of the Military
Procurement Authorization Act for
fiscal 1971, like a NASA authorization
bill, prevents the Department of
Defense from awarding a grant to a
university which bars armed forces
recruiters from its campus, unless the
Secretary of Defense or his designate
finds that the award is a renewal or
continuation of research funding
essential to a program.
Diamond revealed that President
Richard Lyman, in a "private
discussion" after a Sunday radio debate
on KZSU, told him that "Honeywell (a
prime defense contractor, and
manufacturer of antipersonnel
weapons) is contributing some amount
of money to this university," and said
Lyman warned of the consequences if
its recruiters should be excluded from
campus.
Associate Provost Robert
Rosenzweig contended in an interview
with the Daily last night that Diamond
inaccurately reported the president's

remarks. He claimed that Lyman
informed Diamond and others present
that Honeywell contributed to the
University, and suggested that it would
be inconsistent to solicit funds from a
company while barring its recruiters
from campus.
Honeywell supports a National Merit
Scholarship at Stanford with less than
$1,000 annually.
Neither Lyman nor any other
University official responded to an
invitation to speak in defense of their
policy at the rally. Recruiters for the
companies in question did not appear
to defend their corporate policies,
though they were invited by the ASSU.
Air Force recruiters scheduled to
interview on Wednesday have cancelled
their visit, according to the placement
staff, because no students signed up for
interviews.
Organizers of the placement picket
have scheduled a "community
meeting" at 7:00 p.m. tonight in
Columbae House's lounge to decide
upon tactics for use on Wednesday,
Thursday, and Friday.
