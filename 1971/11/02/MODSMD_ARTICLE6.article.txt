More than four months ago, John Dolly was cleaning out mouse
cages in the Stanford Medical Center. A member of Venceremos, he
used to joke that he was teaching the mice to stage a raid on SRI and
chew up all the wiring.
But since June 22, Dolly hasn't come near a mouse, or a paycheck.
Fired for his alleged participation in the April 9 hospital sit-in and
the violence that followed, he has been out of work and ineligible for
unemployment insurance.
One of five workers fired in connection with the hospital incidents,
Dolly was the first to file for a grievance hearing.
To date, his is the only case unresolved.(Barbara Mooney, another
of the fired workers, has not yet undergone grievance proceedings, but
has been re-hired at her old job through different funding.)
Certainly the fault for the delay in grievance proceedings must be
shared by both sides. If Dolly merely wanted a chance to win his job
back without arguing the political points he seeks to make -it seems
likely that, by this time, he would no longer be in limbo. Anthony
Chapman, one of the five fired, argued his case solely for the purpose
of reinstatement and was rehired nine weeks ago.
But the road John Dolly has had to travel to seek a final decision in
his case has been cluttered with roadblocks and delays not of his own
making. Considering the importance of urgency in either returning a
worker to his job or finalizing his dismissal, the problems encountered
throughout the Dolly grievance hearings have not been handled
efficiently or fairly enough by the University.
After an unavoidable delay at the outset of the hearings when
Dolly's department chairman declined to appoint a representative to
the proceedings, Dolly asked the committee for a delay pending
presentation of his case in state court on criminal charges. He
protested that making his case public before his appearance in court
would hamper his ability to present an adequate defense.
The committee concurred, and recommended Dolly's reinstatement
until the time a grievance hearing could be held which would not
jeopardize his chances in court.
Acting University President William Miller claimed that the
committee withdrew the recommendation.
Committee members claimed their recommendation was overruled by
Miller.
In any event, Dolly remained jobless, and his hearing began with
the first session highlighted by the definition of "unacceptable
behavior by an employee," (the grounds cited for his tiring). Former
Director of Personnel Robert Nelson termed it, "behavior which is
unacceptable."
Then the resignations began. One by one, members ol the
committee left the panel, including Dolly's own representative Roland
Finston, who was replaced by Dolly after a disagreement over newly
instituted procedural policies.
By the middle of August, the hearings seemed hopelessly stalled.
The committee remained incomplete, other grievance hearings took
precedence over Dolly's, and he remained out of work. On September
28, he announced he would be forced to abandon his grievance
request and seek other work if no progress were made "within a
week."
By the third week of October, an entirely new committee had been
formed, although again, no hearings had been held. A University
spokesman stated that the latest delay was due to "a whole bunch of
little things." She did not elaborate.
Dolly's hearing is scheduled to begin again today, but it is more
likely that it will not get underway until Thursday. Maybe later.
So John Dolly continues to wait with a pregnant wife and
dwindling savings while the University half-heartedly attempts to
straighten out some "little things." The University cannot be cxcused
for this callous treatment of an employee. The least it can do is
expedite matters and push for an end to the entire cmbarassing mess.

presentation of his case in state court on criminal charges. He
protested that making his case public before his appearance in court
would hamper his ability to present an adequate defense.
The committee concurred, and recommended Dolly's reinstatement
until the time a grievance hearing could be held which would not
jeopardize his chances in court.
Acting University President William Miller claimed that the
committee withdrew the recommendation.
Committee members claimed their recommendation was overruled by
Miller.
In any event, Dolly remained jobless, and his hearing began with
the first session highlighted by the definition of "unacceptable
behavior by an employee," (the grounds cited for his tiring). Former
Director of Personnel Robert Nelson termed it, "behavior which is
unacceptable."
Then the resignations began. One by one, members ol the
committee left the panel, including Dolly's own representative Roland
Finston, who was replaced by Dolly after a disagreement over newly
instituted procedural policies.
By the middle of August, the hearings seemed hopelessly stalled.
The committee remained incomplete, other grievance hearings took
precedence over Dolly's, and he remained out of work. On September
28, he announced he would be forced to abandon his grievance
request and seek other work if no progress were made "within a
week."
By the third week of October, an entirely new committee had been
formed, although again, no hearings had been held. A University
spokesman stated that the latest delay was due to "a whole bunch of
little things." She did not elaborate.
Dolly's hearing is scheduled to begin again today, but it is more
likely that it will not get underway until Thursday. Maybe later.
So John Dolly continues to wait with a pregnant wife and
dwindling savings while the University half-heartedly attempts to
straighten out some "little things." The University cannot be cxcused
for this callous treatment of an employee. The least it can do is
expedite matters and push for an end to the entire cmbarassing mess.
More than four months ago, John Dolly was cleaning out mouse
cages in the Stanford Medical Center. A member of Venceremos, he
used to joke that he was teaching the mice to stage a raid on SRI and
chew up all the wiring.
But since June 22, Dolly hasn't come near a mouse, or a paycheck.
Fired for his alleged participation in the April 9 hospital sit-in and
the violence that followed, he has been out of work and ineligible for
unemployment insurance.
One of five workers fired in connection with the hospital incidents,
Dolly was the first to file for a grievance hearing.
To date, his is the only case unresolved.(Barbara Mooney, another
of the fired workers, has not yet undergone grievance proceedings, but
has been re-hired at her old job through different funding.)
Certainly the fault for the delay in grievance proceedings must be
shared by both sides. If Dolly merely wanted a chance to win his job
back without arguing the political points he seeks to make -it seems
likely that, by this time, he would no longer be in limbo. Anthony
Chapman, one of the five fired, argued his case solely for the purpose
of reinstatement and was rehired nine weeks ago.
But the road John Dolly has had to travel to seek a final decision in
his case has been cluttered with roadblocks and delays not of his own
making. Considering the importance of urgency in either returning a
worker to his job or finalizing his dismissal, the problems encountered
throughout the Dolly grievance hearings have not been handled
efficiently or fairly enough by the University.
After an unavoidable delay at the outset of the hearings when
Dolly's department chairman declined to appoint a representative to
the proceedings, Dolly asked the committee for a delay pending
presentation of his case in state court on criminal charges. He
protested that making his case public before his appearance in court
would hamper his ability to present an adequate defense.
