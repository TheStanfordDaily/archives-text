# UGLY Despair: Dolly Vamps Ferd
## 
### 
It was a crisp Autumn day.
Ferd Firko, vamped in the UGLY
snack lounge by Dolly Lavioliste,
voluptuous upperclasswoman, let
fall from itchy fingers his
half-eaten Butterfinger to the
coke-stained floor. Outside, a sere
leaf wafted to the grassy turf.
But inside (sigh! pant!) Dolly
toyed with the innermost lusts of
the mild-mannered but passionate
frosh fellow, Ferd.
"1 spent 201 for this
minnestrone soup," she purred.
"But now I can't open the can."
Underneath her baby blue
workshirt, Ferd could see what
looked like two heaving footballs.
Trembling, Ferd stepped
forward, grasped the round
container, and stuck his forefinger
through the metal ring. "Gosh
darn it,"he blurted out. "It's
stuck."
"Oh dear," Dolly murmured.
Her voice was husky, Ferd
thought.
Another leaf danced in the
Autumn air, touched by the
gentle breeze. Dolly stroked the
seam of her baby blue blue jeans
with long, supple fingers.
"I'll do it," Firko vowed, and
with a final grunt he pulled the
ring from the can. The top,
however, remained.
"Oh, what will we do now?"
Dolly lisped, licking her full,
parched lips.
Ferd emptied the contents of
his pockets on the littered table.
A cats-eye marble, half of a ticket
to "Sound of Music," a long piece
of brown string with a grappling
hook at the end of it, seven cents
in change, a tree toad, a red
crayon, and a Boy Scout
all-purpose pocket knife. He open
this last and slammed the dull
blade again and again against the
recalcitrant minnestrone top.

"Oh, you're so masterful,"
Dolly cooed, shifting her opulent
curves on the plastic chair.
Outside, yet another. ..
Finally Firko, sweating, broke
on through to the other side. He
handed Dolly her battered but
open can.
"Oh, how can I ever thank
you?" she asked, musically.
Reaching to the top of the soup
vending machine for a spoon, she
rewarded Firko with the sight of a
heart-shaped patch on the seat of
her jeans. "Love" it said.
Ferd scuffed his shoes on his
Butterfinger crumbs. A leaf once

more winsomely . . . Dolly slurped
soup.
"Well, uh, urn," Ferd said, "I,
uh, if you, uh, of course if you'd
rather not. .."
"PR4168," Dolly replied,
tersely. "In ten minutes. Charlotte
Bronte and Her Circle. Be there."
The enraptured Firko stuffed
his boyhood treasures back in his
pocket, dashed out the door, in
the door, through the turnstile,
and up two flights of stairs to the
370 section, to search for
Charlotte's Circle.
Eight minutes later he was still
searching.
"Oh Ferd! Help me!" A
winsome blonde flung herself into
Firko's arms.
"Whatsa matter, Carol?" Ferd
asked, his eyes focused on
PR3086.

"It's Joe. He followed me here
in despair and started throwing
things dow the well from the
fourth floor in despair."
"Everyone does that, Carol.
Paper airplanes and stuff."
"Books? Les Miserables? Me in
Kampf?" And now he's riding up
and down in the elevator in
despair."
"Yes, in despair. He found out
about me and the Mad Rapist."
"Do you know the Mad
Rapist?"
"Intimately."
"Oh well, if you'd rather
not..

Just then the elevator doors
opened and Joe Stanford, his
crewcut awry, stalked out and
seized his chickie from Ferd's
arms. "So you're the Mad Rapist,
Firko! I'll get you for this."
A haggard graduate student
raised his head from his Beowulf
to regard the tableau. "Are you
the Mad Rapist?" he asked.
"No, I'm a freshman," Ferd
averred, taking flight from the
wrath of his former friend, jilted
Joe. Joe followed.
"Was that the Mad Rapist?"
the distraught grad asked Carol.
"Oh no. The Mad Rapist is a
junior in anthro from Santa
Monica. Transfer from SC. He
lives in Storey."
"Storey? But I thought that
was..
"It is."

"Must be quite a fellow." He
returned to Beowulf. Carol took
the elevator, down.
Meanwhile, Joe and Ferd were
racing through UGLY's second
floor. Ferd flung Hock, Time and
Landforms, G859, at his pursuer,
but jealous Joe struck back with
The Andes of Southern Peru: A
Geographical Reconaissance
Along the Seventy-third Meridian,
by Isaiah Bowman, G8165, a low
blow.
Cowering in section 260, the
exhausted Firko seized a copy of
Think, HP9999, by William
Rodgers, and perused it for
inspiration.
"Thus are myths and nonsense
perpetuated. At the turn of the
century Watson had not, it is safe
to say, thought of THINK, a word
he turned into a corporate
crucifix, the graphic symbol of a
business that was an evangelical
religion."
It looked like Ferd was
cornered. He fought back
savagely. "Think," he snarled.
"You think I care about Carol
when I've got a minnestrone
chickie waiting for me at
Charlotte Bronte's Circle?"
"Yeah, and Carol's with
Heathcliff," Joe sneered.
"Where is Carol heh heh?"
Ferd shot back. "Behind the
bound volumes of back copies of
the New Jersey Agricultural
Circular in the stacks in the
basement heh?"
Joe groaned piteously and lit
out for the stacks. Ferd collapsed
in hysterics against a row of
Samuelson. Then, pulling himself
together, he ascended to his
rendez-vous. Charlotte was gone.
"Hey frosh, does 'minnestrone'
mean anything to you?" the
Beowulfist queried in a queer
voice.

"Oh, minnestrone means a lot
to me," Ferd said.
"Well I got a message for you
from this chickie to meet her on
the fourth floor outside terrace by
470."
Carol or Dolly? "What did she
look like?"
"I dunno. Kinda voluptuous
and winsome."
"That sounds good enough,"
Ferd said, wondering how Joe was
getting on in the basement.
Joe was getting on about as
well in the basement as he got on
anywhere, having passed Lucky
Rooster by Gallo, in search of his
fickle chickie.
On the second level, footsteps
clattered on the metal floor, and
then other, more sensuous sounds.
Joe paused, in anguish, in front of
Apple ton's Handy Volume Series.
"Carol," he cried to a set of Polish
Almanacs. He wondered what
Firko was up to.
Firko, once vamped beside the
minnestrone machine and still
trying, saw from the fourth floor
terrace his Dolly sunbathing on
the uppermost roof of UGLY.
Sun glinted off binoculars in the
higher stories of Hoover Tower.
Winsomely, the last leaf of Fall
fell.
Ferd took his brown string
with the grappling hook at the
end of it out of his pocket and
threw it at the red tiles above him.
It caught not far from the tanned
toe of Dolly.
Ferd Firko, Fly of UGLY, saw
the library for what it was, a giant
ice cube tray. Climbing past one
window he could see the Beowulf
scholar sigh, a man trapped inside
a mammoth tic tac toe game, all
metaphors mixed.
Ferd Firko, UGLY Fly, sighed
and climbed on.
