# a 						class approach

Those who overlook or ignore
the existence of class divisions in
our society are bound to propose
at best only half-measures for its
ills. Without a concerete analysis
and understanding of its funda
mental problems and
contradictions, our efforts to
change our society can only lead
to a perpetuation of an unequal
system. The so-called militant
faction of the Women's Liberation
movement presently lacks this
necessary understanding.
Are all men naturally the
enemies of all women? Or even
within the conditions of this
society, are there no bonds, no
divisions, more fundamental than
the sexual ones? The demands put
forth, often incoherently and in
piecemeal fashion, in the Daily
this fall are an assorted bag
ranging from intelligent to shrilly
emotional, but sharing a
fundamental assumption:
maintaining our present
socio-economic and political
system, albeit with some cosmetic
alterations.
Equal male: female rations in

admissions now, in administration
and faculty eventually; more
women in "influential positions"
in industry and government; a cult
of the "rugged individual"-
karate, small arms, mechanical
expertise—to that the female ego
will be as hard and self-contained
and self-centered as the male's is
supposed to be; a new language in
which herstory can be written by
herstorians, or in which to give
vent to sexually authentic
hertrionics, freed from chauvinist
histrionics at last; this is the
gamut of demands. Rather than
demand that exploitation
cease—for they know that
exploitation will not stop on
demand—these militants demand
more places for women within the
power elite, equal access to the
tools of repression.
The danger of every rebellion is
that it come to resemble what it
set out to rebel against. This is not
merely Orwellian fiction. Marlaine
Lockheed practicing self-defense:
"My self is worth defending; he
can take care of his self;" or "My
feelings are just as important as
his; even more important." That
may well be self defense, but we
must go beyond both male and
female variants of that type of
self. That is not radicalism; it is
the desire to be the oppressor
instead of the oppressed
masquerading as radicalism.
We do not want simply the
mirror image of our present
society—same institutions, same
injustices—with different people
hoarding the benefits. We cannot
seek our model for change from

within the society itself or all our
changes will be simply variations
on an old and unacceptable
theme. We need a scientific
analysis of the root causes of our
problems and a clear but flexible
theory to guide our way to a new
type of society. We must do more
for the poor, the exploited, the
oppressed than simply change the
color or sex of their masters.
We must make a distinction
between antagonistic and
non-antagonistic contradictions.
Between us, sisters and brothers,
and the ruling class there is an
antagonistic contradiction. Those
who hold power are unlikely to
relinquish it without a struggle.
We must help one another prepare
for this struggle; we must wage
this struggle together. Among us,
there are two as yet
undifferentiated non-antagonistic
contradictions, one based upon
sex and one based upon socially
conditioned sex roles.
The proper methods for
dealing with these latter
contradictions are scientific
research, patient understanding,
and sincere communication. Each
side has to struggle to correct
thinking within its own ranks,
each presently has privileges that
will have to be shared—and
perhaps diminished-pn a more
equitable order.
Now American men have
decision making power, large sums
of money, cardiac diseases,
shorter life expectancy, more
pressure to compete and achieve,
and fears of inadequacy.
American women have babies and

abortions, better health, longer
life expectancy, more leisure, less
responsibility, fewer opportunities
for fulfillment, and fears of
inadequacy. The lists could go on
and on. Are we to set ourselves to
reverse these roles, or even lump
them all together? Or is there
something fundamentally
anti-human about our society
which exacerbates and exploits
the differences between man and
woman, black and white, young
and old, for the superprofits of a
few?
It is nice to know how to
repair a sink or toilet or headlight.
But the purpose of such
knowledge is not to prove that we
are not dependent on one
another, but to make practical the
sharing of tasks. Few who hold a
door open are interested in
asserting their superiority—sexual,
economic, or otherwise. Most
often it is to avoid letting a door
slam in someone's face. It may
even show concern for those who
come after us—an attitude
politically, ecologically, and
socially valuable.
Taking these brief notes to be
sufficient to suggest that we face a
two-fold problem—specific
additional oppression of some
particular groups in addition to
general and systematic oppression
of entire classes by an
economically determined power
elite—the question then is, "Which
first?" The answer will, of course,
depend on your class position. If
you are in a sufficiently privileged
stratum (since no one since C.
Reich admits the existence of,
much less membership in, the
ruling class), you will see the
problem as simply redistributing
whatever additional privileges you
seek, leaving those you already
possess untouched. Should you be

in the double bind, unprivileged
group and exploited class, the
problem of tactics is very real.
Obviously we cannot first balance
the ruling elite sexually and
racially before making
revolutionary demands. It is not a
matter of "revolutionary
impatience." It is a matter of time.
Continued exploitation of man by
man and of the environment by
man—the second really a
of the first —will soon
bring catastrophe.
If you are looking for someone
in such a position to study, there
are many black women from
whom to chose, but perhaps
Melina Mercouri offers the
clearest example. The status of
women in Greece is far from equal
with that of men. Yet clearly
fascism is the main enemy and
must be defeated if any social
reconstruction is to be possible.
First sieze power, and then see
what can be done.
We must not lose sight of our
goals—equal justice and equal
rights for all human persons. We
must struggle for our goal
together, recognizing our
friends—those who can help us
reach our goal—and our enemies.
It is easier to be for
reform—change of quotas, pay
boosts—which, admittedly, are
not unimportant, than to ask
fundamental questions, to press
for radical change. Our society has
enough things just wrong enough
to warrant attention and yet offer
hope of "correction" to keep
reformers busy for generations
while the corporate state
continues to extract profits for its
masters from you and I and from
our sisters and brothers.
