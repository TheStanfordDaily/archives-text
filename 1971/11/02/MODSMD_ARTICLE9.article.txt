Glass Houses
Editor, THE DAILY:
Concerning the claim by the
Hoover Institute's Public
Relations Office that Professor
Giraud had prejudged Hoover's
Conference on Iran:
Prejudgments!?
How can an Institution whose
Director, Glenn Campbell,
publicly asserts that he has "not
knowingly" ever invited a
communist (Russian, Chinese or
ersatz) to be a speaker at a Hoover
sponsored public meeting because
such speakers "are not objective"
talk about prejudgments? People
in glass houses should not throw
stones.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Dan Millman, Stanford's
gymnastic coach, recently sent me
the excellent series of articles that
you did on college football. We
are including part 111 of your
series on one of our monthly
mailings that we distribute to over
200 academics and sports writers
throughout the country.
Your series was one of the
most intelligent, perceptive, well
written pieces of college sports
writing that we have come across
in some time. Congratulations.

Baez and Mercouri
Editor, THE DAILY:
Amid the rave reviews of the
Joan Baez-Melina Mercouri duo
(Stu Allen's Oct 22nd Daily), let
us not confuse melody with
warmth, nor dedication with
desire.
As Miss Mercouri spoke at
Stanford's fund-raising lawn party
two Sundays ago, it was clear she
has become political only insofar
as she hurts. She loves her native
Greece and longs for the joys of
her people. The lines on her face
map the tears and laughter of a
deeply feeling life.
Miss Baez was also at the party.
Somehow, after listening to Miss
Mercouri, I just couldn't imagine
Joan Baez sweeping across the
stage, confessing her love for her
country and the pain in her heart
as she reaches into the air after
the people she has touched.
Joan Baez is the proverbial
lemon tree—very, very pretty,
with a voice that flowers so
sweetly—but inside, she is bitter.
She smiles not when she is happy,
but because she is right.
Now, Joan and David are
separated. Now, after two years of
sharing a man's life, working,
eating, sleeping with him and
having his baby, Joan Baez can
sum up her feelings (?) with "He
still makes more sense to me
politically than anybody else."
(Herb Caen, SF Chronicle, Oct

14).
To caress Joan's slender, tawny
legs a man must measure up
politically. This woman is the
kind who drives men to start wars.
Hers is the same unfeeling
arrogance which swoons over the
uniform and chest medals, and
refuses to see the man.
Beautiful, conscientious Joan,
can you sing to us at last that
making political sense is not
making love?

Franklin Petition
Editor, THE DAILY:
We, the undersigned students
and faculty of the Department of
German Studies, hereby express
our support for Professor Franklin
in his efforts to retain his position
at Stanford University and
demand that the University
abandon its efforts to dismiss
Professor Franklin or to prolong
his suspension.
As teachers and students
working in a department
dedicated to a humanistic
discipline, we feel that we would
be failing our responsibilities if we
did not take a stand on matters
which concern both the
University and the nation. As a
department teaching German
language, literature, and
intellectual history, we are
particularly aware of the problem
of quiescence on the part of
intellectuals, scholars, and

teachers in the face of immoral
and illegal acts of their
governments.
We all know that if the
professors and students at German
universities had spoken out
unambiguously against the Hitler
government, the most shameful
chapter of German history might
not have been written—namely
the prostration of a country's
intellect before the blandishments
and threats of governmental
immorality and folly.
Professor Franklin is now being
prosecuted precisely for speaking
out against the illegal and immoral
actions of the government.
Stanford University, in
prosecuting him for this, is not
only failing to fulfill its duty to
oppose an immoral government,
but is also exposing its own
complicity with that government
by suppressing criticism of it and
its policies, and by actively
seeking DOD contracts, while
continually claiming to support
the principles of academic
freedom.
We feel that the loss of
Professor Franklin would deprive
the University not only of an
excellent teacher and scholar, but
also a teacher whose active
commitment is in stark contrast
to the general passivity of the
academic community.
For these reasons we call upon
the University to reverse its
present course of action.
Signed by 25 students and 11
members of the faculty.
