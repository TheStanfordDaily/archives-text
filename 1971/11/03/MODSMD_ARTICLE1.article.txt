# Provost Testifies In Franklin Case
## 
### PHIL REVZIN 
Suspended Associate Professor H. Bruce Franklin
rested his defense yesterday, in the 30 th session of his
Advisory Board Hearing. The administration
presented three rebuttal witnesses at the session.
Franklin will present surrebuttal testimony today,
and both sides will present final arguments Thursday
and Friday.
Provost William F. Miller testified during rebuttal
that he had not communicated information
concerning the controversial Gamut-H program to the
demonstrators at the Computation Center, February
10.
Miller further testified that he felt at the time that
any statement on the program should have come
from the Stanford Research Institute (SRI), the
sponsors of the project, and that "the initiative for a
response to demands about the project was in the
hands of SRI."
Inquisition Flyer
Miller indicated that he had been aware February
8 th of a flyer signed by the Inquisition detailing
aspects of the Gamut-H program, which demanded
that the research be halted. Gamut-H concerned plans
for an amphibious invasion which protestors claimed
could be directly applied to Vietnam.
He said that in response to this flyer he called SRI
and spoke to Mr. Perrin, who said that Gamut-H was
not classified, and that information and results of the
project would be freely available.
Perrin also stressed the non-military applications
of the project, according to Miller.
Temporary Hold
Miller said that following this conversation, he
learned that SRI had put a "temporary hold" on the

project, but had not cancelled its accounts at the
Comp Center. After the demonstration of the 10 th,
SRI decided to no longer use the Comp Center
facilities, he said.
Miller added that at the time of the
demonstration, he was holding meetings with the
Computer Facility Committee about the Gamut-H
program, and that this was another reason he
preferred not to issue "an incomplete report."
The Provost added that he had made an
"inspection tour" of the Center during the
demonstration.
Vulnerable
He continually stressed, under cross-examination,
that he did not communicate any information to
demonstrators during the demonstrations because
"the University would have been in a vulnerable
position if we had made statements concerning
possible SRI actions."
He stated repeatedly that "the necessity of
providing full information was the overriding
consideration about whether or not to issue a
statement concerning University policy on the
Gamut-H program."
Miller added that he hadnot called the police
February 10, and had had no conversations with the
police concerning University reactions to Gamut-H.
John Brohome, reporter for KZSU, testified
concerning a tape recording of the KZSU broadcast
of the Computation Center confrontation. After
lengthy argument over whether or not the tape
should be admitted into evidence, the Board ruled
that portions of the tape could be heard.
'Franklin Haranguing'
On the tape, Brohome reports from the scene that

"Franklin was haranguing the crowd about the
question of faculty observers," and that "at one
point, Lincoln Moses was nodding his head in
agreement to what Franklin was saying about it not
being an illegal assembly."
Brohome also commented, on the tape, that "after
Franklin berated the crowd, the momentum of the
crowd backing away from the police reversed itself,
and the crowd began to move back toward the police
lines."
During cross-examination, Brohome testified that
he "now doesn't believe that Franklin was yelling at
anyone to stay." He said that Franklin was actually
yelling toward people who were staying to confront
police anyway, and not at those departing.
The final rebuttal witness was Associate Dean of
Students Alberta Seigel, who testified that after the
Computation Center incident, she heard Franklin
address some people in front of President Lyman's
office, where he said, "Today we succeeded in
smoking out the fucking faculty fascist cops. Lincoln
Moses is just another fucking faculty fascist cop."
Franklin concluded his case by briefly taking the
stand to testify on re-direct that he felt his Old Union
courtyard speech of February 10 had received "a
mixed reaction. There was a little laughter, and a few
shouts of 'right on'."
He also introduced documents which he said
contributed to his knowledge of the roles of faculty
observers at demonstrations. These documents
included statements in 1969 by President Pitzer and
then Provost Lyman concerning the role of faculty
observers in protecting the rights of demonstrators at
demonstrations.

REBUTTALâ€”Provost William F. Miller was one of three administration rebuttal
witnesses at yesterday's Franklin hearing. Miller said he had not communicated
any information to demonstrators inside the Computation Center about the
controversial Gamut-H program since he felt "the initiative for a response to
demands about the project was in the hands of SRI." Franklin is seen addressing
the Advisory Board in the foreground.
Doris Youdelman, a Technical Processing Assistant at
the main library, testified that she had attended a rally of
about 25 workers on the library lawn before the rally at
White Plaza February 10. Youdelman said that workers at
the rally hoped that the Computation Center would be shut
down as the first step of a Cambodia-type strike.
She added that the group had "marched over to the
White Plaza rally," and that John Keilch spoke for the
group at the rally. "We weren't going to risk our jobs by
proposing specific courses of action," she said. "We just
wanted to see what the rally had decided."
Herb Borock, parliamentarian of the student senate,
testified that he had seen a handwritten, unsigned notice
posted on a wall saying that the Computation Center was
closed. Borock added that security guards at the doors did
not ask people if they were authorized to enter the
building. He added that the President must post guards to
ask if people have authorization to enter any building that
he chooses to close.
The hearing resumes at 1 p.m. today in Physics 101.
