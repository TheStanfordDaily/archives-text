# Trotskyites At Fault
## Enthusiasm For Protest Decreases 
### Jim Shoch 
There is little mass enthusiasm
for the November 6 marches.
This, I believe, is largely the fault
of the organized anti-war
movement. During the past two
years, the biggest marches and
mobilizations have been organized
primarily by the National Peace
Action Council (NPAC), an
organization dominated by the
Trotskyite Socialist Workers Party
(SWP) and its affiliated youth
group, the Young Socialist
Alliance (YSA).
That these marches and
demonstrations have been for the
most part progressive is
undeniable. Millions of people
have been mobilized to take
action against the war, most for
the first time, and Nixon has been
forced to recognize this massive
opposition to his war policies.
But 1971 is not 1969. NPAC's
concern with mobilizing masses of
people and maintaining the
support of liberal businessmen
and politicians has kept it from
educating the American public as
to the real nature—the imperialist
nature—of U.S. intervention in
Indochina. The war is being
fought primarily to ensure
American banks and corporations
access to the rich natural
resources, untapped markets, and
cheap labor of Southeast Asia.
NPAC has refused to make
these facts explicit in its
organizing. Its unwillingness to
put forward anti-imperialist
politics has led the anti-war
movement in a dangerous
direction for a number of reasons.
First, NPAC's emphasis on
"getting the troops out now" fits
right in with Nixon's so-called
Vietnamization scheme! Nixon is
"getting the troops out", at least
to some extent. But the planes,
ships, and oil wells remain. By
avoiding this point, NPAC has let
Nixon mislead some Americans
into believing the war is winding
down, and this explains some of

the lack of enthusiasm for the
November 6 marches.
Second, NPAC is calling only
for the removal of U.S. troops
from Indochina; it is not building
concrete support for the National
Liberation Front (NLF) and the
Provisional Revolutionary
Government (PRG) in South
Vietnam (whose seven-point peace
proposal is the only reasonable
basis for settlement of the war),
the Pathet Lao in Laos, or the
National United Front (NUF) in
Cambodia.
Third, by refusing to stress the
imperialist nature of the war,
NPAC continues to foster the
illusion that the war is a "tragic
mistake" and that everything will
be fine when it's over. In fact, the
war in Indochina is neither the
first nor the last of America's
deliberately conceived wars for
empire. As national liberation
struggles spread throughout the
Third World, the U.S. will again
be forced to intervene with
troops, ships, and planes to
defend its investments. Thailand
could well be next. Intervention
in Latin America and Africa will
not be far behind.
Fourth, in its efforts to
mobilize the largest number of
people, NPAC has stuck largely to
the single issue of the war. By not
attacking the whole system of
American monopoly capitalism or
imperialism, it has been able to
largely ignore the national
liberation struggles of Black,
Brown and other Third World
peoples within this country. While
there are usually several Third
World speakers at NPAC rallies,
they only rarely present
revolutionary viewpoints.
This year, most Brown groups
in the Bay Area have decided to
boycott the November 6 march
and are holding their own Chicano
Moratorium in Oakland on
November 3. At these groups'
request, Venceremos is joining

their boycott, and will be at their
march on the 3 rd.
Fifth, in its single-minded
emphasis on the war, NPAC has
largely failed to deal with the
economic and political problems
facing American working people,
problems that are the direct result
of the war in particular and U.S.
imperialism in general. NPAC
gives only passing reference to the
problems of war-created inflation
and unemployment, and it has
almost ignored Nixon's New
Economic Policy, a scheme
designed to make the American
working class pay for the current
crisis of empire.
Sixth, by concentrating its
efforts on building mass marches
and rallies, NPAC has helped to
de-fuse the militant student
anti-war movement that was so
important and effective during the
middle and late sixties. Students
have been told that mass
mobilizations are more effective
than on-campus struggles against
the war. This position has been
strongly supported by university
regents, trustees, administrators,
and faculty members all across the
country. At Stanford in
particular, this type of argument
has been used to undermine the
attacks being organized against
ROTC and DOD contracts on
campus.
Finally, many Americans are
simply tired of long marches that
have little effect in ending the
war. As a result, the turnout on
November 6 will undoubtedly be
a good deal smaller than in the
past. NPAC's emphasis on mass
marches has drained energy that

could have been better spent
planning more creative and
effective actions that could
involve those who are fed up with
marches. The May Day attempt to
shut down Washington is an
example of this kind of action.

If the anti-war movement is to
become an exciting and effective
political force, its leaders will have
to fundamentally reassess the role
they have been playing.
Some people will undoubtedly
be alienated by this kind of
analysis, but the anti-war
movement as a whole will be far
stronger when it clearly
understands the nature of the
system that makes imperialist
wars and exploitation inevitable.
Revolutionaries must always
retain their own independence
and initiative within the anti-war
movement. Specifically, this
means they must continue to
organize smaller, militant
demonstrations when the time is
right, for instance when Nixon
comes to town (if he does). These
actions produce struggle within
the anti-war movement, and this
struggle invariably leads to unity
at higher and more advanced
levels of understanding.
As for concrete activities in the
near future, we can attend the
Chicano Moratorium to be held
on November 3 in Oakland,
beginning at 12:00 noon at the
Fairfax Theater. For those who
choose to march on November 6,
there will be a militant
anti-imperialist contingent armed
with flags and banners whose
members plan to do a lot of
educational leafletting among the

crowd.
Closer to home, we can begin
to rebuild the anti-war movement
on the Stanford campus. Bruce
Franklin's job is still on the line,
and as the Young Crows are
making clear, Stanford is still
heavily involved in directly
war-related DOD contracting.
A militant anti-war,
anti-imperialist movement at
Stanford this year would be the
most important contribution we
could make to the world-wide
struggle against U.S. imperialism.

people, NPAC has stuck largely to
the single issue of the war. By not
attacking the whole system of
American monopoly capitalism or
imperialism, it has been able to
largely ignore the national
liberation struggles of Black,
Brown and other Third World
peoples within this country. While
there are usually several Third
World speakers at NPAC rallies,
they only rarely present
revolutionary viewpoints.
This year, most Brown groups
in the Bay Area have decided to
boycott the November 6 march
and are holding their own Chicano
Moratorium in Oakland on
November 3. At these groups'
request, Venceremos is joining

their boycott, and will be at their
march on the 3 rd.
Fifth, in its single-minded
emphasis on the war, NPAC has
largely failed to deal with the
economic and political problems
facing American working people,
problems that are the direct result
of the war in particular and U.S.
imperialism in general. NPAC
gives only passing reference to the
problems of war-created inflation
and unemployment, and it has
almost ignored Nixon's New
Economic Policy, a scheme
designed to make the American
working class pay for the current
crisis of empire.
Sixth, by concentrating its
efforts on building mass marches
and rallies, NPAC has helped to
de-fuse the militant student
anti-war movement that was so
important and effective during the
middle and late sixties. Students
have been told that mass
mobilizations are more effective
than on-campus struggles against
the war. This position has been
strongly supported by university
regents, trustees, administrators,
and faculty members all across the
country. At Stanford in
particular, this type of argument
has been used to undermine the
attacks being organized against
ROTC and DOD contracts on
campus.
Finally, many Americans are
simply tired of long marches that
have little effect in ending the
war. As a result, the turnout on
November 6 will undoubtedly be
a good deal smaller than in the
past. NPAC's emphasis on mass
marches has drained energy that

could have been better spent
planning more creative and
effective actions that could
involve those who are fed up with
marches. The May Day attempt to
shut down Washington is an
example of this kind of action.

If the anti-war movement is to
become an exciting and effective
political force, its leaders will have
to fundamentally reassess the role
they have been playing.
Some people will undoubtedly
be alienated by this kind of
analysis, but the anti-war
movement as a whole will be far
stronger when it clearly
understands the nature of the
system that makes imperialist
wars and exploitation inevitable.
Revolutionaries must always
retain their own independence
and initiative within the anti-war
movement. Specifically, this
means they must continue to
organize smaller, militant
demonstrations when the time is
right, for instance when Nixon
comes to town (if he does). These
actions produce struggle within
the anti-war movement, and this
struggle invariably leads to unity
at higher and more advanced
levels of understanding.
As for concrete activities in the
near future, we can attend the
Chicano Moratorium to be held
on November 3 in Oakland,
beginning at 12:00 noon at the
Fairfax Theater. For those who
choose to march on November 6,
there will be a militant
anti-imperialist contingent armed
with flags and banners whose
members plan to do a lot of
educational leafletting among the

crowd.
Closer to home, we can begin
to rebuild the anti-war movement
on the Stanford campus. Bruce
Franklin's job is still on the line,
and as the Young Crows are
making clear, Stanford is still
heavily involved in directly
war-related DOD contracting.
A militant anti-war,
anti-imperialist movement at
Stanford this year would be the
most important contribution we
could make to the world-wide
struggle against U.S. imperialism.

EARLY MOVEMENT Sympathizers congregate in White Plaza for
a May 196 7 anti-draft rally. The demonstrators supported an ASSU
referendum calling for Stanford to stop supplying draft boards with
students' academic standing. The referendum was passed with a vote
of 59 per cent of the student body.
There is little mass enthusiasm
for the November 6 marches.
This, I believe, is largely the fault
of the organized anti-war
movement. During the past two
years, the biggest marches and
mobilizations have been organized
primarily by the National Peace
Action Council (NPAC), an
organization dominated by the
Trotskyite Socialist Workers Party
(SWP) and its affiliated youth
group, the Young Socialist
Alliance (YSA).
That these marches and
demonstrations have been for the
most part progressive is
undeniable. Millions of people
have been mobilized to take
action against the war, most for
the first time, and Nixon has been
forced to recognize this massive
opposition to his war policies.
But 1971 is not 1969. NPAC's
concern with mobilizing masses of
people and maintaining the
support of liberal businessmen
and politicians has kept it from
educating the American public as
to the real nature—the imperialist
nature—of U.S. intervention in
Indochina. The war is being
fought primarily to ensure
American banks and corporations
access to the rich natural
resources, untapped markets, and
cheap labor of Southeast Asia.
NPAC has refused to make
these facts explicit in its
organizing. Its unwillingness to
put forward anti-imperialist
politics has led the anti-war
movement in a dangerous
direction for a number of reasons.
First, NPAC's emphasis on
"getting the troops out now" fits
right in with Nixon's so-called
Vietnamization scheme! Nixon is
"getting the troops out", at least
to some extent. But the planes,
ships, and oil wells remain. By
avoiding this point, NPAC has let
Nixon mislead some Americans
into believing the war is winding
down, and this explains some of

the lack of enthusiasm for the
November 6 marches.
Second, NPAC is calling only
for the removal of U.S. troops
from Indochina; it is not building
concrete support for the National
Liberation Front (NLF) and the
Provisional Revolutionary
Government (PRG) in South
Vietnam (whose seven-point peace
proposal is the only reasonable
basis for settlement of the war),
the Pathet Lao in Laos, or the
National United Front (NUF) in
Cambodia.
Third, by refusing to stress the
imperialist nature of the war,
NPAC continues to foster the
illusion that the war is a "tragic
mistake" and that everything will
be fine when it's over. In fact, the
war in Indochina is neither the
first nor the last of America's
deliberately conceived wars for
empire. As national liberation
struggles spread throughout the
Third World, the U.S. will again
be forced to intervene with
troops, ships, and planes to
defend its investments. Thailand
could well be next. Intervention
in Latin America and Africa will
not be far behind.
Fourth, in its efforts to
mobilize the largest number of
people, NPAC has stuck largely to
the single issue of the war. By not
attacking the whole system of
American monopoly capitalism or

struggle invariably leads to unity
at higher and more advanced
levels of understanding.
As for concrete activities in the
near future, we can attend the
Chicano Moratorium to be held
on November 3 in Oakland,
beginning at 12:00 noon at the
Fairfax Theater. For those who
choose to march on November 6,
there will be a militant
anti-imperialist contingent armed
with flags and banners whose
members plan to do a lot of
educational leafletting among the

crowd.
Closer to home, we can begin
to rebuild the anti-war movement
on the Stanford campus. Bruce
Franklin's job is still on the line,
and as the Young Crows are
making clear, Stanford is still
heavily involved in directly
war-related DOD contracting.
A militant anti-war,
anti-imperialist movement at
Stanford this year would be the
most important contribution we
could make to the world-wide
struggle against U.S. imperialism.

EARLY MOVEMENT Sympathizers congregate in White Plaza for
a May 196 7 anti-draft rally. The demonstrators supported an ASSU
referendum calling for Stanford to stop supplying draft boards with
students' academic standing. The referendum was passed with a vote
of 59 per cent of the student body.
There is little mass enthusiasm
for the November 6 marches.
This, I believe, is largely the fault
of the organized anti-war
movement. During the past two
years, the biggest marches and
mobilizations have been organized
primarily by the National Peace
Action Council (NPAC), an
organization dominated by the
Trotskyite Socialist Workers Party
(SWP) and its affiliated youth
group, the Young Socialist
Alliance (YSA).
That these marches and
demonstrations have been for the
most part progressive is
undeniable. Millions of people
have been mobilized to take
action against the war, most for
the first time, and Nixon has been
forced to recognize this massive
opposition to his war policies.
But 1971 is not 1969. NPAC's
concern with mobilizing masses of
people and maintaining the
support of liberal businessmen
and politicians has kept it from
educating the American public as
to the real nature—the imperialist
nature—of U.S. intervention in
Indochina. The war is being
fought primarily to ensure
American banks and corporations
access to the rich natural
resources, untapped markets, and
cheap labor of Southeast Asia.
NPAC has refused to make
these facts explicit in its
organizing. Its unwillingness to
put forward anti-imperialist
politics has led the anti-war
movement in a dangerous
direction for a number of reasons.
First, NPAC's emphasis on
"getting the troops out now" fits
right in with Nixon's so-called
Vietnamization scheme! Nixon is
"getting the troops out", at least
to some extent. But the planes,
ships, and oil wells remain. By
avoiding this point, NPAC has let
Nixon mislead some Americans
into believing the war is winding
down, and this explains some of

the lack of enthusiasm for the
November 6 marches.
Second, NPAC is calling only
for the removal of U.S. troops
from Indochina; it is not building
concrete support for the National
Liberation Front (NLF) and the
Provisional Revolutionary
Government (PRG) in South
Vietnam (whose seven-point peace
proposal is the only reasonable
basis for settlement of the war),
the Pathet Lao in Laos, or the
National United Front (NUF) in
Cambodia.
Third, by refusing to stress the
imperialist nature of the war,
NPAC continues to foster the
illusion that the war is a "tragic
mistake" and that everything will
be fine when it's over. In fact, the
war in Indochina is neither the
first nor the last of America's
deliberately conceived wars for
empire. As national liberation
struggles spread throughout the
Third World, the U.S. will again
be forced to intervene with
troops, ships, and planes to
defend its investments. Thailand
could well be next. Intervention
in Latin America and Africa will
not be far behind.
Fourth, in its efforts to
mobilize the largest number of
people, NPAC has stuck largely to
the single issue of the war. By not
attacking the whole system of
American monopoly capitalism or
imperialism, it has been able to
largely ignore the national
liberation struggles of Black,
Brown and other Third World
peoples within this country. While
there are usually several Third
World speakers at NPAC rallies,
they only rarely present
revolutionary viewpoints.
This year, most Brown groups
in the Bay Area have decided to
boycott the November 6 march
and are holding their own Chicano
Moratorium in Oakland on
November 3. At these groups'
request, Venceremos is joining

their boycott, and will be at their
march on the 3 rd.
Fifth, in its single-minded
emphasis on the war, NPAC has
largely failed to deal with the
economic and political problems
facing American working people,
problems that are the direct result
of the war in particular and U.S.
imperialism in general. NPAC
gives only passing reference to the
problems of war-created inflation
and unemployment, and it has
almost ignored Nixon's New
Economic Policy, a scheme
designed to make the American
working class pay for the current
crisis of empire.
Sixth, by concentrating its
efforts on building mass marches
and rallies, NPAC has helped to
de-fuse the militant student
anti-war movement that was so
important and effective during the
middle and late sixties. Students
have been told that mass
mobilizations are more effective
than on-campus struggles against
the war. This position has been
strongly supported by university
regents, trustees, administrators,
and faculty members all across the
country. At Stanford in
particular, this type of argument
has been used to undermine the
attacks being organized against
ROTC and DOD contracts on
campus.
Finally, many Americans are
simply tired of long marches that
have little effect in ending the
war. As a result, the turnout on
November 6 will undoubtedly be
a good deal smaller than in the
past. NPAC's emphasis on mass
marches has drained energy that

could have been better spent
planning more creative and
effective actions that could
involve those who are fed up with
marches. The May Day attempt to
shut down Washington is an
example of this kind of action.

If the anti-war movement is to
become an exciting and effective
political force, its leaders will have
to fundamentally reassess the role
they have been playing.
Some people will undoubtedly
be alienated by this kind of
analysis, but the anti-war
movement as a whole will be far
stronger when it clearly
understands the nature of the
system that makes imperialist
wars and exploitation inevitable.
Revolutionaries must always
retain their own independence
and initiative within the anti-war
movement. Specifically, this
means they must continue to
organize smaller, militant
demonstrations when the time is
right, for instance when Nixon
comes to town (if he does). These
actions produce struggle within
the anti-war movement, and this
struggle invariably leads to unity
at higher and more advanced
levels of understanding.
As for concrete activities in the

ships, and oil wells remain. By
avoiding this point, NPAC has let
Nixon mislead some Americans
into believing the war is winding
down, and this explains some of

the lack of enthusiasm for the
November 6 marches.
Second, NPAC is calling only
for the removal of U.S. troops
from Indochina; it is not building
concrete support for the National
Liberation Front (NLF) and the
Provisional Revolutionary
Government (PRG) in South
Vietnam (whose seven-point peace
proposal is the only reasonable
basis for settlement of the war),
the Pathet Lao in Laos, or the
National United Front (NUF) in
Cambodia.
Third, by refusing to stress the
imperialist nature of the war,
NPAC continues to foster the
illusion that the war is a "tragic
mistake" and that everything will
be fine when it's over. In fact, the
war in Indochina is neither the
first nor the last of America's
deliberately conceived wars for
empire. As national liberation
struggles spread throughout the
Third World, the U.S. will again
be forced to intervene with
troops, ships, and planes to
defend its investments. Thailand
could well be next. Intervention
in Latin America and Africa will
not be far behind.
Fourth, in its efforts to
mobilize the largest number of
people, NPAC has stuck largely to
the single issue of the war. By not
attacking the whole system of
American monopoly capitalism or
imperialism, it has been able to
largely ignore the national
liberation struggles of Black,
Brown and other Third World
peoples within this country. While
there are usually several Third
World speakers at NPAC rallies,
they only rarely present
revolutionary viewpoints.
This year, most Brown groups
in the Bay Area have decided to
boycott the November 6 march
and are holding their own Chicano
Moratorium in Oakland on
November 3. At these groups'
request, Venceremos is joining

their boycott, and will be at their
march on the 3 rd.
Fifth, in its single-minded
emphasis on the war, NPAC has
largely failed to deal with the
economic and political problems
facing American working people,
problems that are the direct result
of the war in particular and U.S.
imperialism in general. NPAC
gives only passing reference to the
problems of war-created inflation
and unemployment, and it has
almost ignored Nixon's New
Economic Policy, a scheme
designed to make the American
working class pay for the current
crisis of empire.
Sixth, by concentrating its
efforts on building mass marches
and rallies, NPAC has helped to
de-fuse the militant student
anti-war movement that was so
important and effective during the
middle and late sixties. Students
have been told that mass
mobilizations are more effective
than on-campus struggles against
the war. This position has been
strongly supported by university
regents, trustees, administrators,
and faculty members all across the
country. At Stanford in
particular, this type of argument
has been used to undermine the
attacks being organized against
ROTC and DOD contracts on
campus.
Finally, many Americans are
simply tired of long marches that
have little effect in ending the
war. As a result, the turnout on
November 6 will undoubtedly be
a good deal smaller than in the
past. NPAC's emphasis on mass
marches has drained energy that

could have been better spent
planning more creative and
effective actions that could
involve those who are fed up with
marches. The May Day attempt to
shut down Washington is an
example of this kind of action.

If the anti-war movement is to
become an exciting and effective
political force, its leaders will have
to fundamentally reassess the role
they have been playing.
Some people will undoubtedly
be alienated by this kind of
analysis, but the anti-war
movement as a whole will be far
stronger when it clearly
understands the nature of the
system that makes imperialist
wars and exploitation inevitable.
Revolutionaries must always
retain their own independence
and initiative within the anti-war
movement. Specifically, this
means they must continue to
organize smaller, militant
demonstrations when the time is
right, for instance when Nixon
comes to town (if he does). These
actions produce struggle within
the anti-war movement, and this
struggle invariably leads to unity
at higher and more advanced
levels of understanding.
As for concrete activities in the
near future, we can attend the
Chicano Moratorium to be held
on November 3 in Oakland,
beginning at 12:00 noon at the
Fairfax Theater. For those who
choose to march on November 6,
there will be a militant
anti-imperialist contingent armed
with flags and banners whose
members plan to do a lot of
educational leafletting among the

crowd.
Closer to home, we can begin
to rebuild the anti-war movement
on the Stanford campus. Bruce
Franklin's job is still on the line,
and as the Young Crows are
making clear, Stanford is still
heavily involved in directly
war-related DOD contracting.
A militant anti-war,
anti-imperialist movement at
Stanford this year would be the
most important contribution we
could make to the world-wide
struggle against U.S. imperialism.

EARLY MOVEMENT Sympathizers congregate in White Plaza for
a May 196 7 anti-draft rally. The demonstrators supported an ASSU
referendum calling for Stanford to stop supplying draft boards with
students' academic standing. The referendum was passed with a vote
of 59 per cent of the student body.
