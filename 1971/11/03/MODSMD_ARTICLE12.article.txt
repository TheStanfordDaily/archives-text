# Conservative Viewpoint
## Radicals Exploit War 
### Chris Hocker 
Barry Goldwater was supposed
to have said something like, "We
should bomb North Vietnam back
to the Stone Age." Whether he
actually said that or not is
irrelevant here; the point is that
many people construe such a
statement to be the sum total of
the conservative's Vietnam policy.
Let me answer that briefly by
saying that as a conservative
becomes increasingly libertarian,
his opposition to the war usually
increases correspondingly. Such
libertarian leaders as Murray
Rothbard and Nathaniel Branden

(who are roughly the libertarian
equivalent of, say, Herbert
Marcuse, in case you were
wondering) have opposed the war
openly and consistently. And the
libertarian position on the draft
should be familiar by now.
But the opposition to the war
does not necessarily mean the
advocacy of a revolution, the
overthrow of the capitalist
system, the abolition of private
property, the frenzied waving of
red books, the immediate death of
all those unfortunate enough to
be arbitrarily labeled "war

criminals," the liberation of those
equally arbitrarily labeled

"political prisoners," or any of
the other little goodies to be
found in the grab bag of
revolutionary rhetoric. So that the
opponent of the war, libertarian
or no, who finds himself in
disagreement with the revolution,
et al., is often faced with the
choice of joining the rhetoricians,
perceiving them to be the only
legitimate Anti-War Movement, or
of protesting either silently or as
an individual (e.g.,' refusing
induction, etc.).
The attempts of Bruce
Franklin and others to
characterize the Venceremos
organization as THE Anti-War
Movement at Stanford have been
both frightening and ludicrous
because of their simplistic
approach: "If you are against the
war, you are also against
capitalism and all that other stuff,
because they all tie in."
I submit that the war in
Vietnam is separable from Ot .n
social ills, both real and perceived,
and that the legitimacy of a
movement is inversely
proportional to the amount it
attempts to exploit sincere
anti-war sentiment in the name of
"Power to the People."
It appears, however, that such
attempts at exploitation are
increasing. Those who hold
individual freedom as a primary
value will opt out of exploitive
movements and will seek methods
of individual protest. If such
action is not taken, the collectivist
frenzy passing itself off as the
Anti-War Movement will continue
long after the war in Vietnam is
overâ€”until, a la Skinner, human
freedom and dignity are
destroyed.
