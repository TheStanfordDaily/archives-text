# Liberals At Fault
## War Protest Requires Radical Analysis 
### Katherine Barkley 
The failures of the anti-war
movement have been the failures
of liberal analysis and liberal
politics. Liberals have told us that
U.S. intervention in Indochina is
an aberration in an otherwise
spotless history of
humanitarianism. And to correct
this mistake they advocate
"working within the
system"—politely petitioning and
hoping the government will end
the war once it realizes how
unpopular its Vietnam policy is.
And so, over the years, millions
have marched. And the President
and the Pentagon have yawned,
manufacured lies for their press
releases, and turned back to their
bombing charts.
Seven years of the anti-war
movement have taught us two
major lessons:
(1) We must expand our
analysis. To be anti-war we must
be anti-imperialist. The war is not

a mistake—it is the logical
conclusion of expansionist
economic policies. For every AID
and CIA project there is brewing
another Vietnam or Laos or
Cambodia. The United States is
waging military, economic, and
political warfare against Third
World nations in order to keep
them "free" for western values
and capitalist development.
(2) We must develop a more
effective strategy. In order to end
the war and prevent the next
ones, we must understand the
fundamental issue of power in
America. The U.S. is an
authoritarian and imperialist
country, dominated by the values
of profit and competition,
controlled by a small power elite
whose interests and policies are in
basic contradiction to human
values and world peace. Unless we
confront the issue of who rules
America, unless we insist that

government serve the interests of
the people and not the wealthy
elite, we will never be able to
control the institutions that
determine our lives.
Incorporating these lessons, we
must develop an analysis of the
roots of the war, and move from a
strategy of piecemeal protest to
one of committed resistance.
Peace marches were important in
mobilizing the present majority
opposition to the war. But at this
point in history, protest that does
not apply tangible pressure on
Nixon, the Pentagon, and our
ruling class is moral masturbation.
We have kindly asked the war
machine to stop. It continues.
Until we are willing to take
risks, to act outside the system, to
use the power we have to threaten
and inhibit its smooth
functioning, the machine will
continue to function.
The best place to start is right
in our own home. Stanford's

contributions to the war effort are
well documented. Far from even
imitating an ivory tower, Stanford
is an imperialist institution
servicing the ruling elite and its
military-industrial complex. As
members of the Stanford
community we have the power to
say NO. No brainpower and
resources from our community
will go to contribute to the
domination or destruction of
other peoples, whether in
Indochina, Latin America or East
Palo Alto.
This has been the strategy of
the anti-imperialist movement at
Stanford. For anyone interested
in the analysis of Stanford and
imperialism there will be a four
part symposium, "Stanford: The
Highest Stage of Capitalism" in
the week of November 8-14.

point in history, protest that does
not apply tangible pressure on
Nixon, the Pentagon, and our
ruling class is moral masturbation.
We have kindly asked the war
machine to stop. It continues.
Until we are willing to take
risks, to act outside the system, to
use the power we have to threaten
and inhibit its smooth
functioning, the machine will
continue to function.
The best place to start is right
in our own home. Stanford's

contributions to the war effort are
well documented. Far from even
imitating an ivory tower, Stanford
is an imperialist institution
servicing the ruling elite and its
military-industrial complex. As
members of the Stanford
community we have the power to
say NO. No brainpower and
resources from our community
will go to contribute to the
domination or destruction of
other peoples, whether in
Indochina, Latin America or East
Palo Alto.
This has been the strategy of
the anti-imperialist movement at
Stanford. For anyone interested
in the analysis of Stanford and
imperialism there will be a four
part symposium, "Stanford: The
Highest Stage of Capitalism" in
the week of November 8-14.

The failures of the anti-war
movement have been the failures
of liberal analysis and liberal
politics. Liberals have told us that
U.S. intervention in Indochina is
an aberration in an otherwise
spotless history of
humanitarianism. And to correct
this mistake they advocate
"working within the
system"—politely petitioning and
hoping the government will end
the war once it realizes how
unpopular its Vietnam policy is.
And so, over the years, millions
have marched. And the President
and the Pentagon have yawned,
manufacured lies for their press
releases, and turned back to their
bombing charts.
Seven years of the anti-war
movement have taught us two
major lessons:
(1) We must expand our
analysis. To be anti-war we must
be anti-imperialist. The war is not

a mistake—it is the logical
conclusion of expansionist
economic policies. For every AID
and CIA project there is brewing
another Vietnam or Laos or
Cambodia. The United States is
waging military, economic, and
political warfare against Third
World nations in order to keep
them "free" for western values
and capitalist development.
(2) We must develop a more
effective strategy. In order to end
the war and prevent the next
ones, we must understand the
fundamental issue of power in
America. The U.S. is an
authoritarian and imperialist
country, dominated by the values
of profit and competition,
controlled by a small power elite
whose interests and policies are in
basic contradiction to human
values and world peace. Unless we
confront the issue of who rules
America, unless we insist that

government serve the interests of
the people and not the wealthy
elite, we will never be able to
control the institutions that
determine our lives.
Incorporating these lessons, we
must develop an analysis of the
roots of the war, and move from a
strategy of piecemeal protest to
one of committed resistance.
Peace marches were important in
mobilizing the present majority
opposition to the war. But at this
point in history, protest that does
not apply tangible pressure on
Nixon, the Pentagon, and our
ruling class is moral masturbation.
