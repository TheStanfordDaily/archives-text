# SF Protest
## Peace Groups To March Saturday 
### Phil Goldsmith 
Anti-war marches, sponsored
by the National Peace Action
Coalition and the People's
Coalition for Peace and Justice,
will be held in San Francisco and
16 other cities across the nation
this Saturday.
Despite the levels of
participation in marches and
similar mass outpourings of
dissent (such as the nationwide
student strike that arose after the
Cambodian invasion and the Kent
State murders), government
policy in Indochina continues
much as before.
As of this August, 226,000
U.S. troops remained in Vietnam,
supported by tens of thousands
more in Thailand, Okinawa and
other places in southeast Asia and
the western Pacific. More than
$15 billion went to pay the costs
of the war during fiscal year 1971
and projections of this fiscal
year's costs run between $ 10-$ 14
billion. Many of the troops and a
good proportion of the money is
being used in the aerial
destruction of Indochina.
Faced with these facts, many
persons opposed to the war have
dismissed marches as politically
ineffective symbolic gestures.
Despite the inability of mass
demonstrations to achieve their
ultimate goal of ending the war,
they clearly have set boundaries
and limitations on American
actions in Indochina and on
American foreign policy in
general.
They have forced immediate
military policy to be formulated
within a broad policy of slowly
winding down the war. This has
clearly not ended the destruction
of the peoples and lands of

Indochina, but it has kept North
Vietnam from being invaded, and,
since 1968 , from being bombed
except in occasional "protective
reaction" raids. In addition,
protest forced limitations on the
use of American ground troops in
Cambodia during the Cambodian
invasion. Protest has also taught
the American government to
avoid supporting certain
unpopular, repressive regimes, for
example, the government of West
Pakistan.
However, the limitations
placed upon American action still
leave Nixon with a great deal of
leeway in setting policy, which he
is using in an attempt to buy off
popular dissent at home while
maintaining unpopular regimes in
Indochina.
Based on his assumption that
the average American only cares
when his fellow citizens are killed
in battle, not when Asian
combatants and civilians die,
Nixon is withdrawing American
ground troops, replacing them
with Asian troops, but retaining
highly destructive American air
power and technology. (For a
more full analysis, see "The
Illusion of Withdrawal" by
Gabriel Kolko in The New
Republic, October 2,1971.)
The march this Saturday is
intended to indicate that the
American people find Nixon's
strategy and its consequences
unacceptable. Participation in the
march is open to anybody
demanding an end to American
involvement in the Indochina war,
either through unilateral
withdrawal or through
negotiations.
How successful this march will

be in forcing changes in American
policy in Indochina cannot be
predicted. But what is clear is that
if many of the people opposing
the war do not march Saturday,
Nixon will claim that the poor
turnout indicates the American
people support his way of
handling the Indochina war. If
this march fails, its failure will be
interpreted by the Administration
as meaning the Administration has
popular support for its programs
and will leave us unable to affect
American policy in Indochina
until the next elections.

The price the peoples of
Indochina will have to pay if we
don't march is too great for us not
to spend Saturday showing that
we still demand an end to the war.
Please join us at Embarcadero
Plaza at 9 a.m. Saturday for the
march and at the Golden Gate
Park Polo Field at 1:30 for an
anti-war rally. For further
information and to purchase bus
tickets to the march, see our table
in White Plaza from 10-2 daily.

Cambodian invasion and the Kent
State murders), government
policy in Indochina continues
much as before.
As of this August, 226,000
U.S. troops remained in Vietnam,
supported by tens of thousands
more in Thailand, Okinawa and
other places in southeast Asia and
the western Pacific. More than
$15 billion went to pay the costs
of the war during fiscal year 1971
and projections of this fiscal
year's costs run between $ 10-$ 14
billion. Many of the troops and a
good proportion of the money is
being used in the aerial
destruction of Indochina.
Faced with these facts, many
persons opposed to the war have
dismissed marches as politically
ineffective symbolic gestures.
Despite the inability of mass
demonstrations to achieve their
ultimate goal of ending the war,
they clearly have set boundaries
and limitations on American
actions in Indochina and on
American foreign policy in
general.
They have forced immediate
military policy to be formulated
within a broad policy of slowly
winding down the war. This has
clearly not ended the destruction
of the peoples and lands of

Indochina, but it has kept North
Vietnam from being invaded, and,
since 1968 , from being bombed
except in occasional "protective
reaction" raids. In addition,
protest forced limitations on the
use of American ground troops in
Cambodia during the Cambodian
invasion. Protest has also taught
the American government to
avoid supporting certain
unpopular, repressive regimes, for
example, the government of West
Pakistan.
However, the limitations
placed upon American action still
leave Nixon with a great deal of
leeway in setting policy, which he
is using in an attempt to buy off
popular dissent at home while
maintaining unpopular regimes in
Indochina.
Based on his assumption that
the average American only cares
when his fellow citizens are killed
in battle, not when Asian
combatants and civilians die,
Nixon is withdrawing American
ground troops, replacing them
with Asian troops, but retaining
highly destructive American air
power and technology. (For a
more full analysis, see "The
Illusion of Withdrawal" by
Gabriel Kolko in The New
Republic, October 2,1971.)
The march this Saturday is
intended to indicate that the
American people find Nixon's
strategy and its consequences
unacceptable. Participation in the
march is open to anybody
demanding an end to American
involvement in the Indochina war,
either through unilateral
withdrawal or through
negotiations.
How successful this march will

be in forcing changes in American
policy in Indochina cannot be
predicted. But what is clear is that
if many of the people opposing
the war do not march Saturday,
Nixon will claim that the poor
turnout indicates the American
people support his way of
handling the Indochina war. If
this march fails, its failure will be
interpreted by the Administration
as meaning the Administration has
popular support for its programs
and will leave us unable to affect
American policy in Indochina
until the next elections.

The price the peoples of
Indochina will have to pay if we
don't march is too great for us not
to spend Saturday showing that
we still demand an end to the war.
Please join us at Embarcadero
Plaza at 9 a.m. Saturday for the
march and at the Golden Gate
Park Polo Field at 1:30 for an
anti-war rally. For further
information and to purchase bus
tickets to the march, see our table
in White Plaza from 10-2 daily.
