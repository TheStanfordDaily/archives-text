# Card Icemen Tie Berkeley
## 
### 
Though dominating most of
the game, the Stanford Ice
Hockey team was able to tally
only once, managing to hold onto
a 1-1 tie in last Tuesday night's
contest with the Berkeley Juniors.
As was the case in their first
game, the Cards could not
produce on offense. The team had
numerous power plays but they
were stymied by the Berkeley
defense. Again the Stanford club
held the lead until late in the
game.
The only Stanford score came
midway through the first period.
The Indians had been pressuring
the Berkeley goalie on a power
play. After a mad scramble in
front and with the goalie down,
Russ MacAusland passed the puck
back to Pat Baldwin at the point.
Baldwin's shot caught the far
corner as the Berkeley netminder
struggled helplessly to his knees.
The Indian defense held up
well into the third period. Once
again Ralph Brown and netminder
Rick Bragdon played outstanding
hockey. However, a penalty to
Redball Burke and shortly
thereafter another one to Will
Mcllvaine had the Cards two men
short. On a rush into the Cards'
Zone, a Berkeley winger's shot was
stopped by Bragdon, but he was
unable to control the rebound. An
enemy winger picked up the loose
puck and somehow fed it across
the goalmouth to his teammate
parked at the other corner. He
poked the puck in and the score
was deadlocked.

THAT'S ALL—Mike Simone cuts down Washington State quarterback Ty Paine in Stanford's 24-23 loss
with a diving tackle as Paine headed upfield after turning the corner. Simone ranks fourth on the team in
tackles this season with 54. Larry Butler leads the Indians with 79 tackles and Jeff Siemon and Pete
Lazetich are tied with 74 apiece. Stanford's injury situation is much improved going into this weekend's
game against UCLA. Jeff Siemon, Tim Robnett and John Winesberry went through practice yesterday at
full speed and will be ready for Saturday. Rod Garcia is recovering from a heel bruise but will be at full
strength for the Bruins. The only doubtful performer will be Hillary Shockley who is seeing limited
practice due to his sprained ankle.
