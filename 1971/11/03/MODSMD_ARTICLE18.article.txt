# First Victory
## Freshmen Crush SFS, 23-7 
### MIKE HERMAN 
The combined talents of a
tenacious "Thunder Chick"
defense and the bruising running
of Mark Grattan and Mike Cook
led the Stanford frosh to a 23-7
stomping of San Francisco State
last Friday. In so doing, the
freshmen evened their record with
their first victory of the season.
The greater part of the interest
drawn from the game came from
the Indians' exciting first half
play, during which they scored
twenty of their twenty-three
points, while holding the Gators
of S.F.S. scoreless. The score
could have been even more
one-sided had the offense not
drawn critical penalties in key
situations.
Indian Drive
Bob Glick, the Stanford
quarterback in the first quarter,
started things off by taking the
opening kickoff and slowly
moving the team downfield to
within the twenty yard line, the
first of six times the Indians got
that deep in the first half. Long
penalties halted the drive,
however, and Stanford was forced
to punt. That drive was very
significant, nonetheless, because it

foreshadowed the offensive thrust
that the Indians would use all day
in driving a battered Gator
defense across the field almost at
will.
The two teams traded the ball
back and forth during the initial
quarter, until the last play in
which Chuck Merja, a substitute
for the injured Forrie Martin,
picked up a fumble on State's ten
yard line. On the first play of the
second quarter, Mike Cook took a
pitch out from quarterback Click
and rambled the remaining ten
yards for the score. Cook, who
was only put at running back this
week after starting the season as a
defensive back, consistently
picked up both long gains and
hardfought short gains throughout
the game to provide the spark for
the offense.
Kelly Intercepts
Midway through the second
quarter, defensive back Kelly
Walker picked off a Gator pass
and raced deep into enemy
territory. Seconds later, Mark
Grattan powered his way over the
goal line, as Stanford went out in
front 13-0.
The Indians were to score once
more before halftime. With time

running out, Glick cooly faked to
his backs, rolled out and hit end
Bill Singler for a 35 yard
touchdown pass. Chip
Underwood's conversion was
good, as the Indians went into the
locker room with a 20-0 lead.
The second half was of little
excitement to the more than two
hundred fans who showed up for
the game. Duf Sundheim replaced
Glick at quarterback and kept
Stanford's strong running game
rolling. Yet, while running up a
great amount of total yardage, the
Indians could only salvage a field
goal by Mike Brennan in the final
frame.
For its part, San Francisco
State opened up their offense in a
desperate attempt to get back in
the ball game. Shelving their basic
running game plan, the Gators
came out passing in the second
half, but they too could only put
one score on the board as time ran
out.
Defense Excels
The much talked about
Stanford defense played superb
football. Linemen Pat Donovan
and Dick Lambert continually
harrassed the Gator quarterback,
while linebackers Merja and Mike

Yancey covered the field well.
The defensive back field had less
to do with the total defensive
effort, but on several plays, it was
instrumental in turning the game
in Stanford's favor.

defense across the field almost at
will.
The two teams traded the ball
back and forth during the initial
quarter, until the last play in
which Chuck Merja, a substitute
for the injured Forrie Martin,
picked up a fumble on State's ten
yard line. On the first play of the
second quarter, Mike Cook took a
pitch out from quarterback Click
and rambled the remaining ten
yards for the score. Cook, who
was only put at running back this
week after starting the season as a
defensive back, consistently
picked up both long gains and
hardfought short gains throughout
the game to provide the spark for
the offense.
Kelly Intercepts
Midway through the second
quarter, defensive back Kelly
Walker picked off a Gator pass
and raced deep into enemy
territory. Seconds later, Mark
Grattan powered his way over the
goal line, as Stanford went out in
front 13-0.
The Indians were to score once
more before halftime. With time

running out, Glick cooly faked to
his backs, rolled out and hit end
Bill Singler for a 35 yard
touchdown pass. Chip
Underwood's conversion was
good, as the Indians went into the
locker room with a 20-0 lead.
The second half was of little
excitement to the more than two
hundred fans who showed up for
the game. Duf Sundheim replaced
Glick at quarterback and kept
Stanford's strong running game
rolling. Yet, while running up a
great amount of total yardage, the
Indians could only salvage a field
goal by Mike Brennan in the final
frame.
For its part, San Francisco
State opened up their offense in a
desperate attempt to get back in
the ball game. Shelving their basic
running game plan, the Gators
came out passing in the second
half, but they too could only put
one score on the board as time ran
out.
Defense Excels
The much talked about
Stanford defense played superb
football. Linemen Pat Donovan
and Dick Lambert continually
harrassed the Gator quarterback,
while linebackers Merja and Mike

Yancey covered the field well.
The defensive back field had less
to do with the total defensive
effort, but on several plays, it was
instrumental in turning the game
in Stanford's favor.
The combined talents of a
tenacious "Thunder Chick"
defense and the bruising running
of Mark Grattan and Mike Cook
led the Stanford frosh to a 23-7
stomping of San Francisco State
last Friday. In so doing, the
freshmen evened their record with
their first victory of the season.
The greater part of the interest
drawn from the game came from
the Indians' exciting first half
play, during which they scored
twenty of their twenty-three
points, while holding the Gators
of S.F.S. scoreless. The score
could have been even more
one-sided had the offense not
drawn critical penalties in key
situations.
Indian Drive
Bob Glick, the Stanford
quarterback in the first quarter,
started things off by taking the
opening kickoff and slowly
moving the team downfield to
within the twenty yard line, the
first of six times the Indians got
that deep in the first half. Long
penalties halted the drive,
however, and Stanford was forced
to punt. That drive was very
significant, nonetheless, because it

foreshadowed the offensive thrust
that the Indians would use all day
in driving a battered Gator
defense across the field almost at
will.
