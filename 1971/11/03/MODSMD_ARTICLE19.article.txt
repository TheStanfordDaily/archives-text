Hua,will be permanent U.N. representative and delegate to
the Security Council.
A U.S. delegation spokesman said they are expected

Draft Changes Made
WASHINGTON — A new draft classification was created
yesterday for registrants too young to be drafted—the
18-year-olds—and older men with such high lottery
numbers they're unlikely to be called into military service.
Selective Service laid down also new ground rules for
personal appearances before draft boards for a young man
to make "a fair representation of his claim" for exemption
or deferment.
Nuclear Test Preparations
WASHINGTON — The Atomic Energy Commission
announced yesterday "we now expect to be in a state of
readiness to conduct the Cannikin test no earlier than
Saturday, Nov. 6."
The Cannikin test is the proposed big underground blast
of a five-megaton nuclear device on Amchitka Island off
the coast of Alaska.
Meanwhile, opponents of the explosion appealed a
judge's refusal to halt the blast. Environmentalists appealed
also the decision of U.S. District Judge George L. Hart Jr.,
to keep secret some documents which they say prove the
Dotential dancers of the blast.
