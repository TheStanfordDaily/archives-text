# Davis Venue Change; May Be Tried In PA
## 
### 
SAN RAFAEL (AP) â€” The Angela
Davis murder-kidnap trial was moved
yesterday from San Rafael in Marin
County to Santa Clara County.
Although Superior Court Judge
Richard Arnason specified the city of
San Jose for the move, there is some
speculation that Davis will be tried
in Palo Alto.
The North County Court House in
Palo Alto has a women's jail, while the
San Jose Hall of Justice does not. There
is also a chance that Davis could be
held in the Elmwood Women's
Detention Facility in Milpitas.
Arnason, the presiding judge in
Marin County, ordered the change of
venue because of a "reasonable
likelihood that Angela Davis could not
receive a fair trial in Marin County."
According to chief defense attorney
Howard Moore Jr., "Miss Davis cannot
get a fair trial in Santa Clara County,
either."
"Marin was the worst place, but the
other place isn't much better," Moore
told newsmen, adding that "We

definitely will challenge the change of
venue."
Santa Clara County Sheriff James
Geary, when informed of the Davis trial
shift, refused to comment on possible
security measures or on where the trial
might be held.
Although Marin County would
continue to pay for trial costs, the
burden of Security costs may fall on
Santa Clara County.
Howard Campden, Santa Clara
County executive, exclaimed, "Oh My
God!" when informed of the shift. He
speculated that the trial could cost
Santa Clara County taxpayers "several
hundreds of thousands of dollars."
Campden further commented that
arrangements would have to be made to
protect bailiffs and other court
personnel, as well as Miss Davis.
According to chief prosecutor
Albert Harris Jr., the trial probably will
not begin until after January 1. Harris
said that the California Supreme Court
must decide whether Arnason, the
seventh judge in the case, will continue
to preside.
