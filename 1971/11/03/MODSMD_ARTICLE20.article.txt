# Pakistani Scholars Give Speeches

### JIM WASCHER 
The two members of the Bangla
Desh delegation to the United Nations
yesterday pled for the help and support
of the Stanford community. Speaking
at a noon rally in White Plaza, Dr.
Azizur Rahman Malliek said that U.S.
military assistance to West Pakistan was
having a serious effect upon the
"continuous battle between the
democratic forces of Bangla Desh and
the despotic forces of West Pakistan."
Present with Malliek at the rally was
fellow delegate Dr. Ashabul Haque.
According to Haque, one million
Bengalis have already been slain by an
"uncivilized and barbaric enemy that
does not believe in any human values."
Me added that another nine million had
been driven into refugee camps where
they "are huddled together just waiting
to go home" to a free country.
At a press conference immediately
preceding the rally, Malliek said "If the
price of freedom has to be paid in
blood and life and suffering, I think our
people have paid enough. I don't know
of any country that has suffered
more."
Malliek is the Vice Chancellor of
Chittagong University, which is the
second largest university in Bangla Desh
and was a member of the Pakistani
delegation to Red China in 1969. He
now serves as President of the Bangla
Desh Teachers' Association.
Haque is a member of the Bengali
Provincial Assembly and was a
founding member of the Awami
League. Both have merely lobbied at
the United Nations since Bangla Desh
has not been granted member status.

They hope that their efforts will
produce sufficient public pressure to
force the Nixon Administration to end
all military and economic aid to West
Pakistan.
In describing the Bengalis' struggle
with the West Pakistanis, Malliek stated
that "the doors were closed on us" and
that "we chose to fight for complete
independence rather than to suffer in
abject slavery." Malliek said that the
Bengalis now face an enemy which "has

all the characteristics of a primitive and
barbaric horde" which he claims will
rape "wives in the view of their
husbands, and girls in the view of their
parents."
The rally served as a prelude to
today's noon vigil in White Plaza in
behalf of the "Fast to Save a People."
Students will be asked to donate a days
meal money to relief efforts for the
nine million Bengali refugees now in
India.

force the Nixon Administration to end
all military and economic aid to West
Pakistan.
In describing the Bengalis' struggle
with the West Pakistanis, Malliek stated
that "the doors were closed on us" and
that "we chose to fight for complete
independence rather than to suffer in
abject slavery." Malliek said that the
Bengalis now face an enemy which "has

all the characteristics of a primitive and
barbaric horde" which he claims will
rape "wives in the view of their
husbands, and girls in the view of their
parents."
The rally served as a prelude to
today's noon vigil in White Plaza in
behalf of the "Fast to Save a People."
Students will be asked to donate a days
meal money to relief efforts for the
nine million Bengali refugees now in
India.
