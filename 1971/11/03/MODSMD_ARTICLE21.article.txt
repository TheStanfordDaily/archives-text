# Lyman Press Conference
## 
### 
President Richard Lyman last night
re-stated his support of Stanford's
policy of open recruitment at the
Placement Center, citing both financial
and moral considerations.
On the financial side, Lyman said in
a KZSU press conference last night the
University must have contributions,
and some come from corporations.
"How else an institution with no claims
on the taxpayer's dollar is supposed to
support itself without accepting gifts is
never made clear," he argued. And
morally, he likened the drive to ban
war-1 inked recruiting to American
foreign policy, based, he said, on
making moral judgments "vicariously."
"I get a bit uneasy whenever Big
Brother, in whatever disguise, starts to
claim the right to mako moral
judgments for me and for other
people," he added.
He said Stanford's purpose "ought
to be to enable people to make better
moral judgments, not to provide them
pre-packaged."

Later in the conference, Lyman
responded to a question concerning
costs of the SJC and the Franklin trial.
The m oney—perhaps over
$ 1 00,000 —will come from the General
Fund, Lyman explained. But, he added,
many people are realizing that "there is
more than one vvay to bleed the
University" and are glad to see
Stanford spending money.
Lyman could not say what would
become of money earmarked for the
Judicial Council if the ASSU Senate
continues to refuse to make
appointments to the selection
committee. The University will request
$17,000 ffom the Trustees for the Law
School, which provides a faculty
member to serve as Council chairman:
the school currently must absorb the
temporary faculty loss with its own
operating budget.
Press conference panel members
were Tina Swent of Chapparal, Chris
Mocker of the Arena, Tony Bollen from
the Daily, and Seth Newman and Pete
Williams from KZSU.
