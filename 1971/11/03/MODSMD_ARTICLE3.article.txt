# Election Roundup
## Alioto Wins In San Francisco 
### GLENN GARVIN BOB BACON 
Mayor Joseph Alioto overcame
charges of machine politics and a
criminal conspiracy charge and easily
whipped a field of 1 0 challengers in his
bid for re-election to San Francisco's
chief executive post last night.
Alioto had picked up 37 per cent of
the vote late last night, and by 11 p.m.
Republican lawyer Harold Dobbs,
runner-up with 27 per cent fo the
ballots, conceded the race. City
supervisor Dianne Feinstein, a Stanford
graduate, finished third with 20 per
cent.
San Franciscans rejected an attempt
to limit the height of their skyline by
soundly defeating Propositior T. The
referendum would have forced any
contractor erecting a building taller
than six stories to seek voter approval.
Results were mixed in local elections
around the country yesterday, with
both liberals and conservatives among
the winners.
Black Candidates
Black candidates won a few and lost
a few. Cleveland's Arnold Pinkney was
upset by conservative Republican
Ralph Perk, and in Mississippi Charles
Evers was massively beaten in his race
for governor. Gary, Indiana, chose
Richard Hatcher as mayor, and Milton
McGhee lost a race for that post in
Sacramento.
A law and order platform was the
key to success for Frank Rizzo—who
won ~ the mayor's post in
Philadelphia—but it led to defeat for
Ijouise Day Hicks who ran for the same
office in Boston.
In the only election interpreted as a

referendum on Nixon economic
policies, the Kentucky gubernatorial
contest, Democrat Wendell Ford was
elected, indicating some discontent
with GOP policies just a year away
from national elections.
The 5 5-year-old Alioto had dueled
with Dobbs and Feinstein throughout
the campaign over charges of "bossism"
in city hall, and his counter-attacks of
"dirty politics" proved successful in his
attempt to retain the mayor's office for
a second term.
He also had to contend with a
criminal conspiracy indictment in
Washington, and a 1969 cover story in
Look magazine that accused him of ties
with the Mafia.
In Background
Dobbs mentioned the conspiracy
indictment several times during the
campaign, but never attempted to make
it a major issue, while Feinstein ignored
it entirely. Neither contender
mentioned the Look story. But the two
incidents were always in the
background, and Alioto had to fight
them almost as though they were
spoken charges.
"They figured they couldn't win a
clean fight down here," Alioto said at
one point this fall. "I think people are
convinced the indictment is a political
knifing."
Alioto was regarded as a rising star
in the Democratic party until the Look
story hit the newsstands. He gave the
nominating speech for Hubert
Humphrey at the 1968 Democratic
convention, and had intended to do
battle with Assembly Speaker Jess
Unruh for the gubernatorial
nomination in 1970, but the Mafia
charges forced him to withdraw from

that race before it even began.
The victory last night was a needed
boost to his career, which flagged
considerably in March when a grand
jury indicted him for splitting a $2.3
million legal fee with the former
attorney general of Washington before
he was mayor.
"Cool" City
Alioto pointed to the fact that San
Francisco has remained relatively
calm—"cool" was his word—during his
four year tenure. His stand against
busing of school children also seemed
to help his drive.
In addition to dumping Proposition
T, San Franciscans also refused to give
a $5 6 million school bond the
go-ahead. The money would have been
used to bring city schools up to state
earthquake standards as defined by the
Field Act; it failed to get the two-thirds
majority necessary for passage.
In San Francisco, voters ousted their
sheriff of 15 years, Matthew Carberry,
and elected in his place Richard
Hongisto, most liberal of the four
candidates.
Evers Clobbered
William Waller, a Caucasian
attorney, polled 80 per cent of the vote
in Mississippi to beat the independent
Evers. Waller, a Democrat, won even
the predominantly black districts of the
state.
Philadelphia's Rizzo, self-described
"toughest cop in America," topped
Republican Thacher Longstreth. Hicks
lost to incumbent Mayor Kevin White
in Boston. White also beat her in the
1967 race.
Labor union official Frank Marriott
was re-elected mayor of Sacramento.
In Kentucky, Ford beat Tom

Emberton, a Republican, and
flamboyant former Governer A.B.
"Happy" Chandler, a Conservative.
Hatcher won thre quarters of the
Gary vote, effortlessly topping
Republican Theodore Nering.
In no contest did the
newly-enfranchised 18-to-20 year old
voters appear to play a vital role.
Youthful candidates, including two for
the San Francisco Board of Supervisors,
went down to defeat, and no major
contest was close enough to be decided
by the youthful voting bloc.
