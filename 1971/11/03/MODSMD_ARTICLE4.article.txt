# Demonstrators Plan To Initiate Discussions Inside Job Center
## 
### 
Members of Venceremos, the Young Crows, and the
Columbae community participated in the meeting, and
scheduled another meeting for 7 .00 p.m. tonight to decide
upon tactics for use during Honeywell Inc.'s recruiting
appearance Thursday. Honeywell manufactures
antipersonnel weapons, and is the 16 th leading defense
contractor in the country.
The protesting students have scheduled rallies for noon
on Wednesday and Thursday. Bernard Falk, a Princeton
University expert on international law, will speak at the
Thursday rally.
A permanent court injunction sought by the University
last spring, which could be invoked against the
demonstrators today, prohibits any persons named on the
injunction and persons acting in concert with them from
"entering or occupying any building. . .for the purpose and
with the effect of disrupting the business of Stanford
University."
This injunction also prohibits such persons from
"intentionally obstructing or disrupting (by sit-in, or
massing, or milling-in or any other physical acts) the
normal use of. . .any building."

A meeting of about 75 people decided last night to hold
"non-disruptive discussions" inside the Placement Center
today. The placement building has been casually
picketed since Monday because of the activities of military
and defense industry recruiters this week.
When making this consensus decision, the people at the
meeting apparently did not realize that the two defense
recruiters scheduled for today, Litton Industries and the
Air Force, have cancelled their appearances. Litton
cancelled because all of its interviews were conducted
Tuesday, while no students signed up for the Air Force
interviews.
Participants in the meeting Tuesday night agreed to
restrict themselves to peaceful, non-disruptive activities,
but discussed possible responses to University
photographers and police actions.
ASSU co-president Larry Diamond emphasized the legal
nature of the proposed demonstration, and indicated that
he opposes any illegal action because of the possibility of a
favorable decision on the recruiting issue by the Committee
on Services to Students, which is now considering the
problem.
