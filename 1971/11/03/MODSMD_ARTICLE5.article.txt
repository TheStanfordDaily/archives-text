# Reorganization Plans For Police
## 
### LANG ATWOOD Second of two parts 
Despite the general uncertainty regarding the
future of police service here, both the Sheriff's
department and the campus police have announced
new programs which are designed to provide better
service.
Last week, Stanford Police Chief Marvin
Herrington revealed that plans have been made to put
most of the department's men in civilian uniform and
have them patrol unarmed.
The Santa Clara County Sheriff's Department
announced yesterday that it will organize a reserve
deputy unit here, made up of members of the local
community.
The Sheriff's department also participated in an
informal "rap" session Monday in the Arroyo
lounge with representatives from living groups and
minority groups. The meeting was held to acquaint
campus residents with the deputies who patrol the
campus and discuss the relationship of the police to
the community.
Although not directly related, the above
devejopments reflect the fact neither University
officials nor the Sheriff are satisfied with the
current arrangements for providing police service at
Stanford.
Herrington's reorganization plan for the campus
police reflects the fact that the officers on foot patrol
are engaged not in law enforcement work, but
primarily in building security.
Community Service
The uniformed foot patrolmen now in the
"walking" division will be known as "community
service officers" and will patrol unarmed in civilian
clothes. Although the actual uniform has not been
picked, they may wear blazers similar to those worn
by Menlo Park police. According to Herrington, the
men will be identifiable to the public by a patch or
emblem on their jackets.

"We are trying to negate the police image and
reduce the danger to them," the chief explained.
"Their duty will be to observe violations and
report to sworn officers for help."
The mobile patrol division officers, who patrol the
campus in cars will remain uniformed and armed.
These officers have more training and responsibility,
according to Herrington. They may get peace officer
status by becoming reserve deputies if that plan is
agreed upon.
The current salary differential between foot and
mobile patrolmen will be maintained, but there will
be no pay cuts according to Herrington.
Salary Ranges
The post-freeze monthly salary for community
service officers will be between $630-750, depending
on length of service. The range for radio car officers
will be $795-1004.
By comparison, the post-freeze monthly salary
range for a Santa Clara County deputy sheriff will be
$870-1057. Deputies also receive a $100 annual
uniform allowance and an extra seven and one-half
percenl for night duty.
If the radio car officers get peace officer status,
Herrington intends to ask for a further pay increase
to compete with municipal departments for high
caliber recruits.
Several officers who would be affected by the
reorganization said that they did not favor the change
to civilian clothes and were also concerned about
being unarmed. Herrington acknowledges that there is
some discontent in the department over the new plan,
but expects it to be worked out by the time the
reorganization is implemented, probably around the
first of the year.
In a move not directly related to the campus
situation, the Sheriff's department is organizing a
small reserve unit for the North County-Stanford
area. Although details are not yet available, the unit

will be comprised of interested members of the
community who will be trained as reserve deputies.
Reserve Unit
They will work with regular deputies on patrol and
community relations assignments. The members of
the unit will have peace officer status when on duty,
but will not receive a regular salary. A public meeting
will be held in the area soon for persons interested in
joining the unit.
At yesterday's "rap" session, 13 sheriff's officers,
including eight deputies who patrol the campus, the
patrol captain, two community relations officers and
Undersheriff Tom Rosa met with a number of
community residents and Stanford Police Chief
Marvin Herrington.
Complaint Procedures
Several complaints were aired during the meeting,
and Community Relations Sgt. Don Tamm outlined
the procedure for filing a complaint with the
department: if a person feels he has been treated
unfairly or discourteously by an officer he is entitled
to an explanation by the department or an
investigation if necessary. If the incident occurs
during the day, a complainant should call the
Community Relations Unit, and at night should call
the watch commander.
Undersheriff Tom Rosa, in response to questions
about drug arrests, stated that the department has a
new written policy that enforcement of narcotics
laws would be aimed at dealers, not users.
He added, however, that if a deputy observed a
violation while on patrol or answering another call he
would be obligated under state law to make an arrest.
Officers would not go out of their way to arrest users,
nor do they patrol on foot in dorms, he said.
Future meetings will be held between deputies and
residents, possibly as often as once a quarter,
according to [jarry Diamond of the Council of
Presidents.

including eight deputies who patrol the campus, the
patrol captain, two community relations officers and
Undersheriff Tom Rosa met with a number of
community residents and Stanford Police Chief
Marvin Herrington.
Complaint Procedures
Several complaints were aired during the meeting,
and Community Relations Sgt. Don Tamm outlined
the procedure for filing a complaint with the
department: if a person feels he has been treated
unfairly or discourteously by an officer he is entitled
to an explanation by the department or an
investigation if necessary. If the incident occurs
during the day, a complainant should call the
Community Relations Unit, and at night should call
the watch commander.
Undersheriff Tom Rosa, in response to questions
about drug arrests, stated that the department has a
new written policy that enforcement of narcotics
laws would be aimed at dealers, not users.
He added, however, that if a deputy observed a
violation while on patrol or answering another call he
would be obligated under state law to make an arrest.
Officers would not go out of their way to arrest users,
nor do they patrol on foot in dorms, he said.
Future meetings will be held between deputies and
residents, possibly as often as once a quarter,
according to [jarry Diamond of the Council of
Presidents.
Despite the general uncertainty regarding the
future of police service here, both the Sheriff's
department and the campus police have announced
new programs which are designed to provide better
service.
Last week, Stanford Police Chief Marvin
Herrington revealed that plans have been made to put
most of the department's men in civilian uniform and
have them patrol unarmed.
The Santa Clara County Sheriff's Department
announced yesterday that it will organize a reserve
deputy unit here, made up of members of the local
community.
The Sheriff's department also participated in an
informal "rap" session Monday in the Arroyo
lounge with representatives from living groups and
minority groups. The meeting was held to acquaint
campus residents with the deputies who patrol the
campus and discuss the relationship of the police to
the community.
Although not directly related, the above
devejopments reflect the fact neither University
officials nor the Sheriff are satisfied with the
current arrangements for providing police service at
Stanford.
Herrington's reorganization plan for the campus
police reflects the fact that the officers on foot patrol
are engaged not in law enforcement work, but
primarily in building security.
Community Service
The uniformed foot patrolmen now in the
"walking" division will be known as "community
service officers" and will patrol unarmed in civilian
clothes. Although the actual uniform has not been
picked, they may wear blazers similar to those worn
by Menlo Park police. According to Herrington, the
men will be identifiable to the public by a patch or
emblem on their jackets.

"We are trying to negate the police image and
reduce the danger to them," the chief explained.
"Their duty will be to observe violations and
report to sworn officers for help."
The mobile patrol division officers, who patrol the
campus in cars will remain uniformed and armed.
These officers have more training and responsibility,
according to Herrington. They may get peace officer
status by becoming reserve deputies if that plan is
agreed upon.
The current salary differential between foot and
mobile patrolmen will be maintained, but there will
be no pay cuts according to Herrington.
Salary Ranges
The post-freeze monthly salary for community
service officers will be between $630-750, depending
on length of service. The range for radio car officers
will be $795-1004.
By comparison, the post-freeze monthly salary
range for a Santa Clara County deputy sheriff will be
$870-1057. Deputies also receive a $100 annual
uniform allowance and an extra seven and one-half
percenl for night duty.
If the radio car officers get peace officer status,
Herrington intends to ask for a further pay increase
to compete with municipal departments for high
caliber recruits.
Several officers who would be affected by the
reorganization said that they did not favor the change
to civilian clothes and were also concerned about
being unarmed. Herrington acknowledges that there is
some discontent in the department over the new plan,
but expects it to be worked out by the time the
reorganization is implemented, probably around the
first of the year.
In a move not directly related to the campus
situation, the Sheriff's department is organizing a
small reserve unit for the North County-Stanford
area. Although details are not yet available, the unit

will be comprised of interested members of the
community who will be trained as reserve deputies.
Reserve Unit
They will work with regular deputies on patrol and
community relations assignments. The members of
the unit will have peace officer status when on duty,
but will not receive a regular salary. A public meeting
will be held in the area soon for persons interested in
joining the unit.

uniform allowance and an extra seven and one-half
percenl for night duty.
If the radio car officers get peace officer status,
Herrington intends to ask for a further pay increase
to compete with municipal departments for high
caliber recruits.
Several officers who would be affected by the
reorganization said that they did not favor the change
to civilian clothes and were also concerned about
being unarmed. Herrington acknowledges that there is
some discontent in the department over the new plan,
but expects it to be worked out by the time the
reorganization is implemented, probably around the
first of the year.
In a move not directly related to the campus
situation, the Sheriff's department is organizing a
small reserve unit for the North County-Stanford
area. Although details are not yet available, the unit

will be comprised of interested members of the
community who will be trained as reserve deputies.
Reserve Unit
They will work with regular deputies on patrol and
community relations assignments. The members of
the unit will have peace officer status when on duty,
but will not receive a regular salary. A public meeting
will be held in the area soon for persons interested in
joining the unit.
At yesterday's "rap" session, 13 sheriff's officers,
including eight deputies who patrol the campus, the
patrol captain, two community relations officers and
Undersheriff Tom Rosa met with a number of
community residents and Stanford Police Chief
Marvin Herrington.
Complaint Procedures
Several complaints were aired during the meeting,
and Community Relations Sgt. Don Tamm outlined
the procedure for filing a complaint with the
department: if a person feels he has been treated
unfairly or discourteously by an officer he is entitled
to an explanation by the department or an
investigation if necessary. If the incident occurs
during the day, a complainant should call the
Community Relations Unit, and at night should call
the watch commander.
Undersheriff Tom Rosa, in response to questions
about drug arrests, stated that the department has a
new written policy that enforcement of narcotics
laws would be aimed at dealers, not users.
He added, however, that if a deputy observed a
violation while on patrol or answering another call he
would be obligated under state law to make an arrest.
Officers would not go out of their way to arrest users,
nor do they patrol on foot in dorms, he said.
Future meetings will be held between deputies and
residents, possibly as often as once a quarter,
according to [jarry Diamond of the Council of
Presidents.
