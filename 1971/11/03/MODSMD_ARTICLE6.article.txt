# Stanford's Anti-War Movement: A Variety Of Tactics
## Anti-War Farum 
### JOHN MCNEECE 
The- Anti-War Movement at
Stanford was born with a teach-in
against the war on May 17, 1965.
At that time, opposition to the
war was by no means widespread. A
Daily poll of 1500 students
indicated that 63 per cent of the
student body supported President
Johnson's war policy. Activism
was growing, however.
January 31, 1966, saw a
spontaneous rally at the Post
Office opposing Johnson's
resumption of bombing in
Southeast Asia on that date.
The Anti-war movement at
Stanford gained a strong advocate
in the ASSU office when David
Harris was elected student body
president in April 1966. During
his term, the campus became

increasingly disturbed by the war.
Stanford students participated
in the Spring, 1967 March in San
Francisco along with 100,000
others. Other Stanford students
marched on the Stanford
Research Institute (SRI) in order
to dramatize Stanford complicity
in the war. These two activities
indicated the different approaches
which would split liberals and
radicals in the anti-war movement.
In October, 1967 Stanford
students and Faculty participated
in attempts to disrupt business at
the Oakland Induction Center.
After this the campus was calm
until May 7, 1968 when 300-400
students occupied the Old Union
to protest the suspension of
students involved in a
demonstration against CIA

recruiting on campus. After a
three-day sit-in, President Sterling
granted demands for
reinstatement.
AEL Sit-in
Anti-war feeling at Stanford
first gained widespread student
support in the spring, 1968 sit-in
in the Applied Electronics
Laboratory. At that time the issue
of war research was central, and
students made their statement as a
community and in a non-violent
manner. Not everyone was in
accord with the sit-in, yet 1600
people signed a complicity
statement.
On March 11, 1969, some of
the trustees, including David
Packard, met with students in
Memorial Auditorium. Under
questioning, William Hewlett said,

that "Stanford is an institution of
the United States. As an
institution, we will follow the
policy of the United States."
Many moderates were shocked to
realize that the radical analysis
which they had ignored for years
was at least partially true.
Stanford, according to Hewlett
was an arm of the government and
of the military-industrial complex.
With this realization many
students who would not otherwise
have thought of demonstrating
came to an April 3 meeting at
Dinkelspiel. They decided to
move into the Applied Electronics
Laboratory (AEL), in protest of
Stanford war research there and in
other parts of the University.
While the AEL sit-in was
non-violent, the invasion of
Encina of May 1, 1969 was not.
That might, after Encina was
taken, the police came to clear it
out. President Pitzer felt that the
University could not afford to
have Encina tied up as it was the
brain center of the University.
Within a few days of the
Encina incident, there was
another violent demonstration
outside the Stanford Research
Institute (SRI) on Hanover Street.
These moves at Encina and at SRI
alienated the broad student
movement which had supported
the AEL sit-in. Students had
shown with the AEL sit-in that
they were sensitive to the issue of
Stanford complicity with the war,
and war research. However, with
the SDS-led move towards violent
protest, this support disminished.
However, some student
concern about war research

encouraged a Spring 1969 faculty
decision to accept no further
classified contracts.
Moratorium
In fall of 1969, liberals
appeared to take a position of
movement leadership with a plan
for a series of moratoriums. The
purpose of these moratoriums was
to convince the American people
(including Nixon) that the war
must end. Implicit in this stand
was a belief that if enough
Americans were convinced that
the war was wrong, Nixon would
follow democratic practice and

accept the mandate of the people.
The October 15 Moratorium at
Stanford was successful. 8000
people gathered for discussions of
the war, and 2000 individuals
distributed leaflets at homes in
the community and at shopping
centers. There was also a march of
8000 people in Palo Alto.
Students throughout the
nation, participated in
Moratorium activities. However,
President Nixon resolutely
ignored them, and student leaders
were left wondering what to do
next.
At Stanford there were
immediate conflicts over this
question. Tensions arose between
SDS and liberal Moratorium
steering committee over whether
the movement should remain
one-issue oriented against the war,
or whether it should take stands
on a broader range of issues. SDS
wanted to include support of a
steel strike in Moratorium
activities, showing solidarity with
labor. This was not supported by
the group as a whole.
In the November 1314
Moratorium, the primary activity
at Stanford was a march through
Stanford Industrial Park. Police
estimated 5000 people marched,
with some workers joining in.
There was also a large march in
San Francisco. The problem was
that of effectiveness. Mobilizing
seemed to have little effect, and
students began to feel a sense of
hopelessness.
In the beginning of 1970, Daily

columns indicated a move back to
local issues.
The shape of things to come
could be seen when President
Pitzer proposed on January 21,
1970, that ROTC courses be
accepted for accreditation. This
was in spite of a faculty vote of
Feb. 13, 1969 to phase out
academic credit for military
training.
At first, there was no reaction.
Radicals threatened a Liberation
Week but the community reacted
only in opposition to such threats.
The radicals on campus, split

between nationalists and
internationalists,were caught in a
trap between campus inertia and
the game of "who leans more
left?" Instead of working for
campus organization, radicals felt
they must express their high level
of commitment through direct
action.
Thus, after the faculty council
voted to uphold Pitzer's request
for ROTC credit on March 31,
1970. Stanford suffered a rock
barrage which eventually cost the
University thousands of dollars
and was generally considered
counterproductive. Phillip
Taubman wrote in an April 3,
1970 Daily editorial, "Build a big
enough fire, it will attract
attention but people will stay
away from the heat."
However, trashing got
attention. 460 people started a
non-vilent sit-in in the Old Union
on April 23. Interest and concern
were heightened when the sit-in
was ended by a police charge at
1:10 a.m.
The campus remained in a state
of tension for a week and then
erupted when President Nixon
announced on April 30 that
American troops had invaded
Cambodia.
Stanford and 360 other schools
went on strike. Community
feeling revived along with the idea
of non-violent participation. The
Political Action Coordinating
Committee reported
approximately 50 political action
groups working on projects.

When school opened in
September, Richard Lyman was
the new president of Stanford.
Because of the uproar of Spring
and the militance of radicals,
Lyman opened the year with a
vow to defend the campus against
disruption. He warned potential
law-breakers of the increased poss
ibility of police serveillance and
also the possibility of greater
numbers of photographers on
campus.
Leaders of the anti-war
movement went in different
directions. Liberals urged the

campus to support liberal
candidates, especially Stuart
McLean in the November 1970
Congressional elections. Bob
Grant, ASSU president, called for
people to work through the
system in order to effect change.
Students on the whole did not
respond. Elections seemed too
abstract or ineffective.
Stanford radicals did not get
much better response. Over the
past year, they had given up on
the hope of organizing a mass
movement because of the
resistance of white youth. Instead,
they turned towards destroying
the American system. Students
seemed to be even more turned
off as violence escalated. Campus
tension reached a climax when a
student was shot and wounded on
February 10, 1971. Small groups
continued to agitate but the
majority of the student body was
unresponsive.
In the Spring of 1971, the only
activity that seemed to gain any
extensive support was the April
24 march in San Francisco.
Although 200,000 marched, many
people felt a lack of connection
between the march and the war.
The march was educational; it
showed the President that many
thousands of Americans were
unhappy with current policies and
wanted to end the war. However**
it was difficult to see any results
on a concrete level.

LAST SPRINGâ€” 200,000 people, including members of the Stanford Community, participated in the
April 24, 19 71 peace march in San Francisco. This anti-war move, the last Bay Area activity to gain
widespread support, disappointed many with its failure to produce any visible results.
