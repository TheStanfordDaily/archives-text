## War Begins At Stanford 
### Pete Knutson 
The war begins at home. It begins in places like
Stanford's Applied Electronics Laboratory, Place
ment Center, Industrial Park, and Hansen
Laboratories.
To vocalize our opposition to Vietnam and
other American impositions abroad and yet close
our eyes to the militarily essential war research,
development, and recruitment permeating Stanford
is to actually support those inhumane policies. The
24 men and women who own Stanford, most of
whom possess huge financial interests in war
production, have transformed Stanford into an
essential center for the perpetuation and
enlargement of the war machine.
119 war research contracts are currently being
executed at Stanford, primarily in the electronics
and physics laboratories. They deal in such
academic subjects as missile guidance, laser
weapons, helicopter stabilization devices designed to
insure more accurate machine-gun firings,
psychological devices to reduce resistance and
disruption in the Armed Forces, improved
night-sight mechanisms for counter-insurgency use,
specifications for "safe separation distances" and
eye protection devices for pilots on nuclear
bombing missions, drugs designed to keep badly
injured soldiers fighting on the battlefield, and
many more. The actual contracts for each project
can be examined in the Research Policy Office,
Encina Hall. Official Department of Defense
statements describing the applications of contracts
are available in the SWOPSI report on DOD research
at Stanford.
Electronic warfare devices developed at Stanford
are being extensively employed in Southeast Asia at
this moment. Pacific Studies Center's publication
Vietnam-The Electronic Battlefield details the
application of Stanford-researched weaponry in
Vietnam. The forced urbanization

program—"pacification"—by which peasants have
been forced from their homes and corralled in
barbed-wire encircled "strategic hamlets" and
"relocation centers." Stanford's many "better
ideas" used to prosecute the Vietnam war. And if
past history is any indication, Stanford war research
now being done will be translated into weaponry or
related systems within two to five years.
Companies such as Lockheed, Varian, Precision
Instruments, and Hewlett-Packard, which do
extensive war production, dominate Stanford's
Industrial Park. Many of these companies have
Stanford trustees serving as executives or directors.
In addition, many of these same trustees have close
affiliations with the Defense Department. David
Packard, former Stanford trustee and founder of
Hewlett-Packard is presently Deputy Secretary of
Defense. Najeeb Halaby, war industrialist and
Stanford trustee, is a former Deputy Assistant
Secretary of Defense.
Stanford also serves as a center for recruitment
of personnel into the war machine. Hundreds of
graduate students are integrated yearly into the war
machine through their work on Stanford's 119 war
contracts. Many more are recruited by numerous
war industries who, despite last year's student vote
banning them from recruiting on campus, continue
to come in search of Stanford talent. This week
alone, eight of the top fifty war companies plus the
Air Force and Navy are recruiting at the Placement
Center. Thus, a student "service", rejected by the
students themselves, is forced upon students.
Stanford University is a central cog in the gears
of the war machine. If we truly oppose the brutal
U.S. policies forced upon the world through U.S.
military and corporate power, let us begin to attack
the complex right here—at the roots.

Stanford University is a central cog in the gears
of the war machine. If we truly oppose the brutal
U.S. policies forced upon the world through U.S.
military and corporate power, let us begin to attack
the complex right here—at the roots.

the Ad Hoc Witch Hunt Committee.)
The war begins at home. It begins in places like
Stanford's Applied Electronics Laboratory, Place
ment Center, Industrial Park, and Hansen
Laboratories.
To vocalize our opposition to Vietnam and
other American impositions abroad and yet close
our eyes to the militarily essential war research,
development, and recruitment permeating Stanford
is to actually support those inhumane policies. The
24 men and women who own Stanford, most of
whom possess huge financial interests in war
production, have transformed Stanford into an
essential center for the perpetuation and
enlargement of the war machine.
119 war research contracts are currently being
executed at Stanford, primarily in the electronics
and physics laboratories. They deal in such
academic subjects as missile guidance, laser
weapons, helicopter stabilization devices designed to
insure more accurate machine-gun firings,
psychological devices to reduce resistance and
disruption in the Armed Forces, improved
night-sight mechanisms for counter-insurgency use,
specifications for "safe separation distances" and
eye protection devices for pilots on nuclear
bombing missions, drugs designed to keep badly
injured soldiers fighting on the battlefield, and
many more. The actual contracts for each project
can be examined in the Research Policy Office,
Encina Hall. Official Department of Defense
statements describing the applications of contracts
are available in the SWOPSI report on DOD research
at Stanford.
Electronic warfare devices developed at Stanford
are being extensively employed in Southeast Asia at
this moment. Pacific Studies Center's publication
Vietnam-The Electronic Battlefield details the
application of Stanford-researched weaponry in
Vietnam. The forced urbanization

program—"pacification"—by which peasants have
been forced from their homes and corralled in
barbed-wire encircled "strategic hamlets" and
"relocation centers." Stanford's many "better
ideas" used to prosecute the Vietnam war. And if
past history is any indication, Stanford war research
now being done will be translated into weaponry or
related systems within two to five years.
Companies such as Lockheed, Varian, Precision
Instruments, and Hewlett-Packard, which do
extensive war production, dominate Stanford's
Industrial Park. Many of these companies have
Stanford trustees serving as executives or directors.
In addition, many of these same trustees have close
affiliations with the Defense Department. David
Packard, former Stanford trustee and founder of
Hewlett-Packard is presently Deputy Secretary of
Defense. Najeeb Halaby, war industrialist and
Stanford trustee, is a former Deputy Assistant
Secretary of Defense.
Stanford also serves as a center for recruitment
of personnel into the war machine. Hundreds of
graduate students are integrated yearly into the war
machine through their work on Stanford's 119 war
contracts. Many more are recruited by numerous
war industries who, despite last year's student vote
banning them from recruiting on campus, continue
to come in search of Stanford talent. This week
alone, eight of the top fifty war companies plus the
Air Force and Navy are recruiting at the Placement
Center. Thus, a student "service", rejected by the
students themselves, is forced upon students.
