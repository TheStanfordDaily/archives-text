# Destruction Rampant
## Atrocities Cripple Vietnam 
### Gini Faller 
"The operation was Mead
River; it was a very large scale
operation. ROK Marines were
involved, who were Korean
Marines; Marines were involved;
the Army was involved, and
ARVN was involved... we had
just got through making heavy
contact, and we went through a
bunker system. We found
hospitals and we came across four
NVA nurses that were hiding in
one of the bunkers. They were
nurses: We found medical supplies
on them. They had black
uniforms on. *
The ROK Marines' came to us,
one of their officers, and they
asked us if they could have the
NVA nurses, that they would take
care of them because we were
sweeping through the area and
that we couldn Y take care of any
POW's. So I imagine, instead of
killing them, we handed them
over to the ROK Marines.
Well, we were still in the area
when the ROK Marines started
tying them down to the ground.

They spread-eagled them; they
raped them; they raped all four.
There was like maybe 10 or 20
ROK Marines involved. They
tortured them; they sliced off
their breasts; they took machetes
and cut off parts of their fingers
and things like this. And when
that was over they took, on all
four they took pop-up flares,
which are the aluminum
cannisters you hit with your hand.
It will shoot maybe 100, 200 feet
in the air. They stuck them up
their vaginas, all four of them, and
they blew the tops of their heads
off."
â€”Mr. Bishop (Ist Marine
Division, at the Winter Soldier
Investigation, January 31, 1971.)
While U.S. Marines were not
actively involved in the torture of
the NVA nurses, they stood by
and watched. No one protested,
no one tried to stop the action.
Testimony at the Winter
Soldier Investigation in Detroit
showed that this and other
atrocities were not isolated

incidents. My Lai did not just
happen once.
Charles Lefler, formerly of the
2nd Marine Bn., 26th Marine
Reg., "G" Co., 9 th Marine
Amphibious Brigade, reported
that in January, 1969, his
battalion received an order that
" ... if you received one round of
any sort from a friendly village,
the entire battalion was to turn on
line and level that village, and the
exact wording was: 'to kill every
man, woman, child, dog, and cat
in the village ' "
Our attempted destruction of
the Vietnamese people is often on
a more subtle level than out and
out torture and murder.
According to Dr. Jean Pierre
Vigier, half the bombs exploded
in Vietnam are fragmentation
bombs. Such bombs, which
explode into tiny pellets that
imbed in concrete, have almost no
use against military and industrial
installations. However, they will
tear a human body apart.
Tiny leaf-like mines are spread
throughout the forests. They
cannot kill. A person who steps
on one will have his foot blown
off. When he falls, his hand may
hit another. Another favorite
mine of the U.S. Imperialists is a
tiny box-like object covered in
brightly colored plastic. TTiis
weapon is especially good against
children.
These weapons have been
developed in order to tax to the
fullest possible extent the
resources of an underdeveloped
country. A dead comrade need
only be buried; a wounded
comrade must be cared for. This is
also why United States planes
repeatedly seek hospitals as
targets.
Crippling agriculture is an
effective method of controlling
Third World Peoples. Thus we
have destroyed 6+ billion board
feet of hardwood timber, once the
backbone of the Vietnamese
economy. Over half of the
mangrove forests are dead, forcing
the people to resort to kerosene,
rather than charcoal, as fuel, and
helping the oil industry at the
same time. We have destroyed

enough rice to feed 600 billion
people for a year, under the
mistaken assumption that if the
people starve, so will the guerillas.
Insisting that forests provide
cover for guerilla ambush, the
United States has now plowed
under over one million acres of
land using the DC7 -E Caterpillar
tractor. 15 0 of these tractors,
which dig straight through to the
subsoil, work 105 hours per week,
each accompanied by a tank. This
land will grow back in a heavy
type of "elephant grass" which
will prevent the growth of trees or
rice (but will still provide cover
for the anti-imperialist forces).
The War in Indochina is not a
war to protect one ideology from
amother; it is a war to protect
profits. It is a war dedicated to
the genocidal destruction of a
people. Defoliants in drinking
water are responsible for
malformed infants, the new 7.5
ton bomb, the BLU 28 B,
ostensibly used now to make
helicopter landings, detonates
above ground and is more useful
against living beings than against
buildings.
I cannot support a war against
children; a war that puts them
into concentration camps, that
maims them with napalm and
anti-personnel weapons. I must
oppose a war that forces my
sisters to sell their bodies that
they might eat. The Vietnamese
people are fighting the same
American ruling class that keeps
women dependent, that denies
them their humanity.
The same elite which kills
"gooks" in Vietnam in order to
protect investments, denies the
struggle for liberation and
self-determination of Black and
Brown peoples at home and
exploits working class people. The
enemies of the Vietnamese people
are our enemies. Victory to the
NLF!
