Many skiers think that their equipment, in order to be any good at all, must be
handmade by Tyrolean elves high up in the European Alps.
Don't you believe it. Sure, the imported stuff is great, but did you know
there's a manufacturer in, of all places, Broomfield, Colorado that makes
plastic boots (Lange) and fiberglass skis (Dynamic) that most of the Europa
racer-types would trade their ever lovin' FIS medals for a chance at riding this
hot U.S. gear.
We at Short Swing don't want to wave the flag, we just want to give our
customers the goods that perform the best. Lange boots for beginners to racers
â€” Lange/Dynamic skis for intermediates to experts.
By the way. Short Swing is the exclusive dealer for Lange/Dynamic skis from
San Jose to S.F. We're not laying the other shops are Un-American, just
Unfortunate.
