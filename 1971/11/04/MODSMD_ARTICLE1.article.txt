# Middle Class May Suffer From Financial Pinch
## 
### MADISON GROSE 
With the increasing enrollments of minority and poverty
level students over the past few years, Stanford's Financial Aid
Department has had to play a larger role in the lives of a
greater number of students. Necessarily, Financial Aids is
feeling the pinch.
This greater cash outlay for poverty level students has
culminated in what Sociology Professor Sanford Dornbusch
fears as a shortage of funds for student aid, which may make
Stanford an institution of either the very poor, or very rich v
students. Could it be that Stanford is beginning to eliminate
the middle class?
Presidential Assistant Bill Stone views the student body as
potentially coming to resemble a geometric hourglass
figure—disproportionately weighted with upper and lower
class students.
Robert Augsburger, Vice-President for business and
finance, recently commented: "The crux of the problem is
tuition.. .we may be close to the resistance level, when many
parents and their children will simply ask whether it is worth
it. . .something has to give or else a large segment of our
society will not receive the benefits of quality higher

education, and places such as Stanford will ultimately be
reserved only for the wealthy and the disadvantaged poor."
Tuition Increases
Indeed, Stanford's tuition has increased an average of eight
per cent annually over the past decade. More than a few
seniors and upper-classmen admit they wouldn't be entering
Stanford today with the costs as they are.
The real question here is whether increased aid to minority
and poverty level students has or has not restricted the
amount of aid available to middle income families. Robert
Huff, Stanford's Financial Aid Director, says he is "very
concerned" about the middle-income family's dilemma, and
although a general decline of middle income students "hasn't
occurred yet," it "conceivably could."
Huff claims that in many cases the University has had to
broaden its definition of middle class. For example, if the
family is in the $35,000-per-year bracket but the father is
employed in an area with low job security (i.e. aerospace,
some areas of research), Financial Aids might consider this
when offering student aid to a member of the family.
In effect, this means that students from families formerly

recognized as affluent might require financial aid in order to
attend Stanford.
Increased Demand
Huff points out that seventy-five percent of the Stanford
student body is receiving some sort of financial aid, and this is
true in spite of the fact that the median family income of
freshmen is $14,000 annually. With these kind of statistics
how long can Stanford maintain an equitable policy towards
all its students?
Three ways in which Financial Aids is working to keep
abreast of the demand placed upon it are: 1) a re-channeling
of $480,000 back into student aid from the general fund for
the 1971-72 academic year; 2) increased undergraduate job
placement in response to need; and 3) a thorough
investigation of the virtues of undergraduate long-term loans.
Another Herculean task currently occupying Huff and his
team is the attempt "to identify new gifts for scholarships."
Apparently, many private foundations and contributors
possess the fallacious opinion that "the federal government is
bearing this burden" of aid for scholarships.
Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, the

"present allocation formulas used for federal aid to education
generally drain against private higher education, because
they're based upon numbers of students and not upon
institutional support for students," Huff says.
In other words, for every poverty level student attending
Stanford under an Educational Opportunity Grant, the
University is matching the government expenditure on a ratio
of five-to-one. Thus two hundred students under this program
are costing the federal government roughly $200,000 and the
University around $1,000,000.
More Loans Seen
What many students have been forced to do is borrow their
way into debt, which might be discomforting to students
entering a limited job market upon graduation or who
anticipate several years of post-graduate work.
Nevertheless, Stanford undergraduates borrowed $400,000
last year from local banks. Huff warns, however, that he
cannot see loans as the ultimate answer.
In a pensive moment Huff candidly stated "1 believe
increasing costs do increase attrition," but stresses that "we
are concerned with the problem, trying to work out
alternatives." Time may be running out.

placement in response to need; and 3) a thorough
investigation of the virtues of undergraduate long-term loans.
Another Herculean task currently occupying Huff and his
team is the attempt "to identify new gifts for scholarships."
Apparently, many private foundations and contributors
possess the fallacious opinion that "the federal government is
bearing this burden" of aid for scholarships.
Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, the

"present allocation formulas used for federal aid to education
generally drain against private higher education, because
they're based upon numbers of students and not upon
institutional support for students," Huff says.
In other words, for every poverty level student attending
Stanford under an Educational Opportunity Grant, the
University is matching the government expenditure on a ratio
of five-to-one. Thus two hundred students under this program
are costing the federal government roughly $200,000 and the
University around $1,000,000.
More Loans Seen
What many students have been forced to do is borrow their
way into debt, which might be discomforting to students
entering a limited job market upon graduation or who
anticipate several years of post-graduate work.
Nevertheless, Stanford undergraduates borrowed $400,000
last year from local banks. Huff warns, however, that he
cannot see loans as the ultimate answer.
In a pensive moment Huff candidly stated "1 believe
increasing costs do increase attrition," but stresses that "we
are concerned with the problem, trying to work out
alternatives." Time may be running out.
With the increasing enrollments of minority and poverty
level students over the past few years, Stanford's Financial Aid
Department has had to play a larger role in the lives of a
greater number of students. Necessarily, Financial Aids is
feeling the pinch.
This greater cash outlay for poverty level students has
culminated in what Sociology Professor Sanford Dornbusch
fears as a shortage of funds for student aid, which may make
Stanford an institution of either the very poor, or very rich v
students. Could it be that Stanford is beginning to eliminate
the middle class?
Presidential Assistant Bill Stone views the student body as
potentially coming to resemble a geometric hourglass
figure—disproportionately weighted with upper and lower
class students.
Robert Augsburger, Vice-President for business and
finance, recently commented: "The crux of the problem is
tuition.. .we may be close to the resistance level, when many
parents and their children will simply ask whether it is worth
it. . .something has to give or else a large segment of our
society will not receive the benefits of quality higher

education, and places such as Stanford will ultimately be
reserved only for the wealthy and the disadvantaged poor."
Tuition Increases
Indeed, Stanford's tuition has increased an average of eight
per cent annually over the past decade. More than a few
seniors and upper-classmen admit they wouldn't be entering
Stanford today with the costs as they are.
The real question here is whether increased aid to minority
and poverty level students has or has not restricted the
amount of aid available to middle income families. Robert
Huff, Stanford's Financial Aid Director, says he is "very
concerned" about the middle-income family's dilemma, and
although a general decline of middle income students "hasn't
occurred yet," it "conceivably could."
Huff claims that in many cases the University has had to
broaden its definition of middle class. For example, if the
family is in the $35,000-per-year bracket but the father is
employed in an area with low job security (i.e. aerospace,
some areas of research), Financial Aids might consider this
when offering student aid to a member of the family.
In effect, this means that students from families formerly

recognized as affluent might require financial aid in order to
attend Stanford.
Increased Demand
Huff points out that seventy-five percent of the Stanford
student body is receiving some sort of financial aid, and this is
true in spite of the fact that the median family income of
freshmen is $14,000 annually. With these kind of statistics
how long can Stanford maintain an equitable policy towards
all its students?
Three ways in which Financial Aids is working to keep
abreast of the demand placed upon it are: 1) a re-channeling
of $480,000 back into student aid from the general fund for
the 1971-72 academic year; 2) increased undergraduate job
placement in response to need; and 3) a thorough
investigation of the virtues of undergraduate long-term loans.
