# Erick Hawkins Company
## Modern Dance Shows 
### 
Tonight and tomorrow night,
Stanford audiences will be able to
see some of the more innovative
concepts of dance theater when
the Erick Hawkins Dance
Company comes to Memorial
Auditorium for performances
each night at 8 p.m.
Hawkins, recognized as one of
the leading figures in American
dance, has combined with
sculptor Ralph Dorazio and
composer Lucia Dlugoszewski to
create a new concept in "theater
poetry."
The three have worked closely
together for 13 years trying for an
effective relation of sound to
movement to design. Within their
united work, the three say they
strive for individuality, but at the
same time work towards "the
united vision of a theater poetry."
Logistically, the combination
of each artist's work goes
something like this. Dorazio first

designs the sets and the costumes.
He works directly on the body of
the dancer, using no sketches. The
dancer's body becomes the
sculptor's medium.
Hawkins then choreographs his
dance in silence. Hawkins explains
the silence by saying that it is
necessary for him to be able to
fully investigate the subtlety of
"movement-duration" and
"movement rhythm," which he
says music, with its other
preoccupations, tends to flatten
out.
Finally Dlugoszewski composes
the music. She has the final
responsibility for the unity of the
theater poptry. Obviously her
toughest test comes in juxtaposing
the music to the dance. The
Hawkins company is one of the
few dance companies that
performs only to live music, and
uses only contemporary American
composers.
Tonight's program will consist
of "Black Lake," "Angels of the
Innermost Heaven" and
"Cantilever." Tomorrow's
program will include "Geography
of Noon," "Tightrope," and
repeats of "Angels," and
"Cantilever."
"Black Lake" is described as a
musical synthesis of Western and

Eastern structural principles.
"Angels of the Innermost
Heaven" which received its world
premiere on October 11 in
Washington D.C., is being
performed for the first time on
the West Coast. "Angels" is
danced to music by a brass
quintet and it is "recommended
for mature audiences."
"Geography of Noon" is
described by Hawkins as a
"metaphor of butterflies and an
image which becomes a poetic
scaffold from which to gather
courage and discover new
beautiful movement."
"Tightrope" is a dance of
inversion where seemingly safe
places are fraught with danger
and a tightrope becomes the only
place where one can find security.
Following their Stanford
engagement, the company will
give a free lecture and
demonstration on Monday night
in Zellerbach Auditorium at Cal
Berkeley and then give regular
performances there on Tuesday
and Wednesday nights.
Tickets for tonight and
tomorrow night are priced at $2,
$2.75 and $3.50, with student
prices 75 c cheaper in all
categories. Student rush tickets at
$2 will go on sale 15 minutes
before curtain if available.

Auditorium. Erick Hawkins (right) is seen in "Geography Of Noon"
with the company's composer, Lucia Dlugoszewski. Tickets for the
performances are priced at $2, $2.75 and $3.50 with student prices
75c less in all categories. Student rush tickets at $2 will go on sale 15
minutes before curtain if available.
Tonight and tomorrow night,
Stanford audiences will be able to
see some of the more innovative
concepts of dance theater when
the Erick Hawkins Dance
Company comes to Memorial
Auditorium for performances
each night at 8 p.m.
Hawkins, recognized as one of
the leading figures in American
dance, has combined with
sculptor Ralph Dorazio and
composer Lucia Dlugoszewski to
create a new concept in "theater
poetry."
The three have worked closely
together for 13 years trying for an
effective relation of sound to
movement to design. Within their
united work, the three say they
strive for individuality, but at the
same time work towards "the
united vision of a theater poetry."
Logistically, the combination
of each artist's work goes
something like this. Dorazio first

designs the sets and the costumes.
He works directly on the body of
the dancer, using no sketches. The
dancer's body becomes the
sculptor's medium.
Hawkins then choreographs his
dance in silence. Hawkins explains
the silence by saying that it is
necessary for him to be able to
fully investigate the subtlety of
"movement-duration" and
"movement rhythm," which he
says music, with its other
preoccupations, tends to flatten
out.
Finally Dlugoszewski composes
the music. She has the final
responsibility for the unity of the
theater poptry. Obviously her
toughest test comes in juxtaposing
the music to the dance. The
Hawkins company is one of the
few dance companies that
performs only to live music, and
uses only contemporary American
composers.
Tonight's program will consist
of "Black Lake," "Angels of the
Innermost Heaven" and
"Cantilever." Tomorrow's
program will include "Geography
of Noon," "Tightrope," and
repeats of "Angels," and
"Cantilever."
"Black Lake" is described as a
musical synthesis of Western and

Eastern structural principles.
"Angels of the Innermost
Heaven" which received its world
premiere on October 11 in
Washington D.C., is being
performed for the first time on
the West Coast. "Angels" is
danced to music by a brass
quintet and it is "recommended
for mature audiences."
"Geography of Noon" is
described by Hawkins as a
"metaphor of butterflies and an
image which becomes a poetic
scaffold from which to gather
courage and discover new
beautiful movement."
"Tightrope" is a dance of
inversion where seemingly safe
places are fraught with danger
and a tightrope becomes the only
place where one can find security.
Following their Stanford
engagement, the company will
give a free lecture and
demonstration on Monday night
in Zellerbach Auditorium at Cal
Berkeley and then give regular
performances there on Tuesday
and Wednesday nights.
Tickets for tonight and
tomorrow night are priced at $2,
$2.75 and $3.50, with student
prices 75 c cheaper in all
categories. Student rush tickets at
$2 will go on sale 15 minutes
before curtain if available.
