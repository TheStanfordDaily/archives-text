## 'Tupelo...' & Edwards 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
"Tupelo Honey," Van Morrison,
Warner Brothers, ws 1950.
Consider Van Morrison in San
Francisco. In fact, consider him
anywhere and you'll still reach the
same conclusion: he is very, very
good.
And his new album, "Tupelo
Honey," while not quite on a par
with some of his earlier efforts,
certainly does not disprove that
conclusion.
Morrison, of course, first hit in
this country during the so-called
"English invasion" of the early
Sixties. No matter that he comes
from Ireland; he was easily typed.
As lead singer of the group
Them, which never existed
outside a studio, Morrison had a
huge hit single with "Gloria," and
lesser ones with "Mystic Eyes"
and "Here Comes the Night."
Then, Morrison dropped out of
sight, resurfacing just long enough
for a minor hit with "Brown-Eyed
Girl" and an album called
"Blowin' Your Mind," both on
Bang Records.
From there, it was obscurity
until a string of albums, "Astral
Weeks," "Moondance," and "His
and Street Choir," and a
number of hit singles for Warners
elevated him to his current status
as one of the best going.
New Album
"Tupelo Honey," recorded
entirely in San Francisco, opens
with a rocker that is pure
dynamite, "Wild Nights."
Perfectly composed and perfectly
performed, it has proved to be a
killer of a single, equalling and
even surpassing "Domino" off the
last album.
Morrison's voice sets off
Morrison's lyrics superbly. In his
sometimes raspy, unique voice, he
tells us that "all the girls walk by,
dressed up for each other, and the
boys do the boogie woogie, on the
corner of the street." And when
he says that those "wi-i-i-i-ld
nights are callin'," it is Morrison
himself who is calling.
"(Straight to Your Heart) Like
a Cannonball" follows, slowing
down the frenetic pace. "Nice" is
the word to describe it, with a
pleasant flute and background
vocals by the Street Choir.
"Old Old Woodstick," is,
outside of "Wild Nights,"
probably the best song on the
album. It is a dreamy,
well-constructed, mellow piece
that features some fine piano
work by Mark Jordan.
Horns and piano are
temporarily abandoned for
"Starting a New Life," done
basically with acoustic guitars and
harmonica. It is faintly
reminiscent of "Call Me Up in
Dreamland" from "Moondance."
Jazz-Cum -Soul
"You Are My Woman" is, at
six-plus minutes, one of the
longest cuts on the record. It
starts off almost country and
western, but quickly falls into a
sort of jazz-cum-soul Ray Charles
performance.
Side two of the album has only
four songs. "Tupelo Honey" is
mellow Morrison, a very pretty
jazz-oriented piece with an
excellent sax break.
Right about now is where there
should be another real rocker

along the lines of "Come
Running," or a slow but powerful
piece like "Into the Mystic."
Instead, there is a pleasant,
slightly uptempo Scottish
traditional called "I Wanna Roo
You."
"When That Sun Comes" is
again "nice." Van and crew had a
good time doing it, and it comes
over well.
Lacking Power
"Moonshine Whiskey" is also
enjoyable, despite several tempo
changes, but it is not what the
side, and the album as a whole,
needs. What is lacking is a song of
power, a standout if you will.
All told, "Tupelo Honey" is
something less than a
totally-successful album, despite
the preponderance of good and
excellent songs. Without
something to pick up the pace, it
just doesn't move enough,
especially considering that Van
Morrison is one of the finest
rockers around.
As a collection of songs, it is
excellent. As an album, well, it's
better than most of what you hear
today. But not as good as our Van
is capable of.
(Ed's Noteâ€”Van Morrison will
be at Winterland on Friday and
Saturday nights at 8 p.m. Taj
Mahal, Lamb and Wet Willie will
also be on the bill. Tickets are $4
at the door.)

"Jonathan Edwards," Jonathan
Edwards, Capricorn SD 862.
"Jonathan Edwards," says the
press sheet with the copy of his
first album, "is in love . . . with
just about everyone and
everything, but especially with
music. And somehow, the feeling
seems mutual."
Well, let's not go quite that far.
But let's just say that, on the basis
of this effort, Jonathan Edwards
has the potential to be one hell of
an artist.
Edwards, former lead singer of
a little-known group called Sugar
Creek which had one Metromedia
album, has put out a record that
compares favorably with much of
what has been released this year,
and shows an occasional promise
of things to come.
Edwards and his back-up crew
recorded in Boston, but the
record comes through pure
Nashville hillbilly. Using acoustic
and occasional steel guitars, bass,
drums, mouth harp, and
sometimes piano and banjo,
Edwards comes up with a basic
sound that can best be described
as "clean."
The album starts out in fine
style with "Everybody Knows
Her," one of the best two or three
songs on the album. Edwards'

voice is a kind of blend of Cat
Stevens and Glen Campbell, if you
can imagine that.
Catchy Melody
"Everybody Knows Her" is
good material for a single, if
Edwards and Capricorn/Atlantic
are so inclined. Besides a catchy
melody, it boasts an interesting
bass line that I was only able to
pick up on the second listen.
"Cold Snow" doesn't go so far
as to destroy the mood set by the
first song, but it certainly doesn't
add to anything. Although
pleasant enough, the song just
doesn't quite make it, perhaps
because of a poorly-used violin by
Stuart Schulman.
The major flaws in the album
are personified in "Dusty
Morning," a much slower and
more "serious" piece. With its
pseudo-poetiC lyrics, it proves
conclusively ti at Jonathan
Edwards is much better when he's
being Jonathan Edwards than
when he's being Bob Dylan. In
addition, it marks the first
appearance of another recurring
problem: the piano just doesn't fit
the song.
"Shanty" brings back the
problem of Jef Labes' piano: for
Edwards' type of music, Labes is
too full a style, too much
jazz-oriented. He just don't work.
Easily the best song on the
record is "Sunshine," a mover
that starts off side two. Perfectly
timed, perfectly executed,
"Sunshine" more than anything
else demonstrates Edwards'
possibilities. The "dream single"
from the record would be this
backed by "Everybody Knows
Her."
After that masterpiece, "The
King" is a distinct letdown. Labes'
piano gets in the way again.
"Don't Cry Blue" is a typical
rockabilly "I'm-comin'-home"
song. Not so good, not so bad.
After the imperfections of
most of the side, "Train of Glory"
is a refreshing throwback to the
beginning of the album. Starting
with a harp guaranteed to curl
you; hair, this one could come off
a Grateful Dead lp. Especially fine
is a bass line that really comes
through strongly for the first time
on the album.
All told, the album runs, the
gamut of quality from A to Z.
Easily the major areas to which
Edwards should devote himself
are the inconsistencies in the
material and the replacement of
his piano player.
As for the album JONATHAN
EDWARDS itself, it's worth
wading through the bad material
to get at the good. Here's hoping
those flashes of brilliance can be
expanded on Edwards' next
record.

"Tupelo Honey," Van Morrison,
Warner Brothers, ws 1950.
Consider Van Morrison in San
Francisco. In fact, consider him
anywhere and you'll still reach the
same conclusion: he is very, very
good.
And his new album, "Tupelo
Honey," while not quite on a par
with some of his earlier efforts,
certainly does not disprove that
conclusion.
Morrison, of course, first hit in
this country during the so-called
"English invasion" of the early
Sixties. No matter that he comes
from Ireland; he was easily typed.
As lead singer of the group
Them, which never existed
outside a studio, Morrison had a
huge hit single with "Gloria," and
lesser ones with "Mystic Eyes"
and "Here Comes the Night."
Then, Morrison dropped out of
sight, resurfacing just long enough
for a minor hit with "Brown-Eyed
Girl" and an album called
"Blowin' Your Mind," both on
Bang Records.
From there, it was obscurity
until a string of albums, "Astral
Weeks," "Moondance," and "His
and Street Choir," and a
number of hit singles for Warners
elevated him to his current status
as one of the best going.
New Album
"Tupelo Honey," recorded
entirely in San Francisco, opens
with a rocker that is pure
dynamite, "Wild Nights."
Perfectly composed and perfectly
performed, it has proved to be a
killer of a single, equalling and
even surpassing "Domino" off the
last album.
Morrison's voice sets off
Morrison's lyrics superbly. In his
sometimes raspy, unique voice, he
tells us that "all the girls walk by,
dressed up for each other, and the
boys do the boogie woogie, on the
corner of the street." And when
he says that those "wi-i-i-i-ld
nights are callin'," it is Morrison
himself who is calling.
"(Straight to Your Heart) Like
a Cannonball" follows, slowing
down the frenetic pace. "Nice" is
the word to describe it, with a
pleasant flute and background
vocals by the Street Choir.
"Old Old Woodstick," is,
outside of "Wild Nights,"
probably the best song on the
album. It is a dreamy,
well-constructed, mellow piece
that features some fine piano
work by Mark Jordan.
Horns and piano are
temporarily abandoned for
"Starting a New Life," done
basically with acoustic guitars and
harmonica. It is faintly
reminiscent of "Call Me Up in
Dreamland" from "Moondance."
Jazz-Cum -Soul
"You Are My Woman" is, at
six-plus minutes, one of the
longest cuts on the record. It
starts off almost country and
western, but quickly falls into a
sort of jazz-cum-soul Ray Charles
performance.
Side two of the album has only
four songs. "Tupelo Honey" is
mellow Morrison, a very pretty
jazz-oriented piece with an
excellent sax break.
Right about now is where there
should be another real rocker

along the lines of "Come
Running," or a slow but powerful
piece like "Into the Mystic."
Instead, there is a pleasant,
slightly uptempo Scottish
traditional called "I Wanna Roo
You."
"When That Sun Comes" is
again "nice." Van and crew had a
good time doing it, and it comes
over well.
Lacking Power
"Moonshine Whiskey" is also
enjoyable, despite several tempo
changes, but it is not what the
side, and the album as a whole,
needs. What is lacking is a song of
power, a standout if you will.
All told, "Tupelo Honey" is
something less than a
totally-successful album, despite
the preponderance of good and
excellent songs. Without
something to pick up the pace, it
just doesn't move enough,
especially considering that Van
Morrison is one of the finest
rockers around.
As a collection of songs, it is
excellent. As an album, well, it's
better than most of what you hear
today. But not as good as our Van
is capable of.
(Ed's Noteâ€”Van Morrison will
be at Winterland on Friday and
Saturday nights at 8 p.m. Taj
Mahal, Lamb and Wet Willie will
also be on the bill. Tickets are $4

"Jonathan Edwards," Jonathan
Edwards, Capricorn SD 862.
"Jonathan Edwards," says the
press sheet with the copy of his
first album, "is in love . . . with
just about everyone and
everything, but especially with
music. And somehow, the feeling
seems mutual."
Well, let's not go quite that far.
But let's just say that, on the basis
of this effort, Jonathan Edwards
has the potential to be one hell of
an artist.
Edwards, former lead singer of
a little-known group called Sugar
Creek which had one Metromedia
album, has put out a record that
compares favorably with much of
what has been released this year,
and shows an occasional promise
of things to come.
Edwards and his back-up crew
recorded in Boston, but the
record comes through pure
Nashville hillbilly. Using acoustic
and occasional steel guitars, bass,
drums, mouth harp, and
sometimes piano and banjo,
Edwards comes up with a basic
sound that can best be described
as "clean."
The album starts out in fine
style with "Everybody Knows
Her," one of the best two or three
songs on the album. Edwards'

voice is a kind of blend of Cat
Stevens and Glen Campbell, if you
can imagine that.
Catchy Melody
"Everybody Knows Her" is
good material for a single, if
Edwards and Capricorn/Atlantic
are so inclined. Besides a catchy
melody, it boasts an interesting
bass line that I was only able to
pick up on the second listen.
"Cold Snow" doesn't go so far
as to destroy the mood set by the
first song, but it certainly doesn't
add to anything. Although
pleasant enough, the song just
doesn't quite make it, perhaps
because of a poorly-used violin by
Stuart Schulman.
The major flaws in the album
are personified in "Dusty
Morning," a much slower and
more "serious" piece. With its
pseudo-poetiC lyrics, it proves
conclusively ti at Jonathan
Edwards is much better when he's
being Jonathan Edwards than
when he's being Bob Dylan. In
addition, it marks the first
appearance of another recurring
problem: the piano just doesn't fit
the song.
"Shanty" brings back the
problem of Jef Labes' piano: for
Edwards' type of music, Labes is
too full a style, too much
jazz-oriented. He just don't work.
Easily the best song on the
record is "Sunshine," a mover
that starts off side two. Perfectly
timed, perfectly executed,
"Sunshine" more than anything
else demonstrates Edwards'
possibilities. The "dream single"
from the record would be this
backed by "Everybody Knows
Her."
After that masterpiece, "The
King" is a distinct letdown. Labes'
piano gets in the way again.
"Don't Cry Blue" is a typical
rockabilly "I'm-comin'-home"
song. Not so good, not so bad.
After the imperfections of
most of the side, "Train of Glory"
is a refreshing throwback to the

when he's being Bob Dylan. In
addition, it marks the first
appearance of another recurring
problem: the piano just doesn't fit
the song.
"Shanty" brings back the
problem of Jef Labes' piano: for
Edwards' type of music, Labes is
too full a style, too much
jazz-oriented. He just don't work.
Easily the best song on the
record is "Sunshine," a mover
that starts off side two. Perfectly
timed, perfectly executed,
"Sunshine" more than anything
else demonstrates Edwards'
possibilities. The "dream single"
from the record would be this
backed by "Everybody Knows
Her."
After that masterpiece, "The
King" is a distinct letdown. Labes'
piano gets in the way again.
"Don't Cry Blue" is a typical
rockabilly "I'm-comin'-home"
song. Not so good, not so bad.
After the imperfections of
most of the side, "Train of Glory"
is a refreshing throwback to the
beginning of the album. Starting
with a harp guaranteed to curl
you; hair, this one could come off
a Grateful Dead lp. Especially fine
is a bass line that really comes
through strongly for the first time
on the album.
All told, the album runs, the
gamut of quality from A to Z.
Easily the major areas to which
Edwards should devote himself
are the inconsistencies in the
material and the replacement of
his piano player.
As for the album JONATHAN
EDWARDS itself, it's worth
wading through the bad material
to get at the good. Here's hoping
those flashes of brilliance can be
expanded on Edwards' next
record.
"Tupelo Honey," Van Morrison,
Warner Brothers, ws 1950.
Consider Van Morrison in San
Francisco. In fact, consider him
anywhere and you'll still reach the
same conclusion: he is very, very
good.
And his new album, "Tupelo
Honey," while not quite on a par
with some of his earlier efforts,
certainly does not disprove that
conclusion.
Morrison, of course, first hit in
this country during the so-called
"English invasion" of the early
Sixties. No matter that he comes
from Ireland; he was easily typed.
As lead singer of the group
Them, which never existed
outside a studio, Morrison had a
huge hit single with "Gloria," and
lesser ones with "Mystic Eyes"
and "Here Comes the Night."
Then, Morrison dropped out of
sight, resurfacing just long enough
for a minor hit with "Brown-Eyed
Girl" and an album called
"Blowin' Your Mind," both on
Bang Records.
From there, it was obscurity
until a string of albums, "Astral
Weeks," "Moondance," and "His
and Street Choir," and a
number of hit singles for Warners
elevated him to his current status
as one of the best going.
New Album
"Tupelo Honey," recorded
entirely in San Francisco, opens
with a rocker that is pure
dynamite, "Wild Nights."
Perfectly composed and perfectly
performed, it has proved to be a
killer of a single, equalling and
even surpassing "Domino" off the
last album.
Morrison's voice sets off
Morrison's lyrics superbly. In his
sometimes raspy, unique voice, he
tells us that "all the girls walk by,
dressed up for each other, and the
boys do the boogie woogie, on the
corner of the street." And when
he says that those "wi-i-i-i-ld
nights are callin'," it is Morrison
himself who is calling.
"(Straight to Your Heart) Like
a Cannonball" follows, slowing
down the frenetic pace. "Nice" is
the word to describe it, with a
pleasant flute and background
vocals by the Street Choir.
"Old Old Woodstick," is,
outside of "Wild Nights,"
probably the best song on the
album. It is a dreamy,
well-constructed, mellow piece
that features some fine piano
work by Mark Jordan.
Horns and piano are
temporarily abandoned for
"Starting a New Life," done
basically with acoustic guitars and
harmonica. It is faintly
reminiscent of "Call Me Up in
Dreamland" from "Moondance."
Jazz-Cum -Soul
"You Are My Woman" is, at
six-plus minutes, one of the
longest cuts on the record. It
starts off almost country and
western, but quickly falls into a
sort of jazz-cum-soul Ray Charles
performance.
Side two of the album has only
four songs. "Tupelo Honey" is
mellow Morrison, a very pretty
jazz-oriented piece with an
excellent sax break.
Right about now is where there
should be another real rocker

along the lines of "Come
Running," or a slow but powerful
piece like "Into the Mystic."
Instead, there is a pleasant,
slightly uptempo Scottish
traditional called "I Wanna Roo
You."
"When That Sun Comes" is
again "nice." Van and crew had a
good time doing it, and it comes
over well.
Lacking Power
"Moonshine Whiskey" is also
enjoyable, despite several tempo
changes, but it is not what the
side, and the album as a whole,
needs. What is lacking is a song of
power, a standout if you will.
All told, "Tupelo Honey" is
something less than a
totally-successful album, despite
the preponderance of good and
excellent songs. Without
something to pick up the pace, it
just doesn't move enough,
especially considering that Van
Morrison is one of the finest
rockers around.
As a collection of songs, it is
excellent. As an album, well, it's
better than most of what you hear
today. But not as good as our Van
is capable of.
(Ed's Noteâ€”Van Morrison will
be at Winterland on Friday and
Saturday nights at 8 p.m. Taj
Mahal, Lamb and Wet Willie will
also be on the bill. Tickets are $4

"Jonathan Edwards," Jonathan
Edwards, Capricorn SD 862.
"Jonathan Edwards," says the
press sheet with the copy of his
first album, "is in love . . . with
just about everyone and
everything, but especially with
music. And somehow, the feeling
seems mutual."
Well, let's not go quite that far.
But let's just say that, on the basis
of this effort, Jonathan Edwards
has the potential to be one hell of
an artist.
Edwards, former lead singer of
a little-known group called Sugar
Creek which had one Metromedia
album, has put out a record that
compares favorably with much of
what has been released this year,
and shows an occasional promise
of things to come.
Edwards and his back-up crew
recorded in Boston, but the
record comes through pure
Nashville hillbilly. Using acoustic
and occasional steel guitars, bass,
drums, mouth harp, and
sometimes piano and banjo,
Edwards comes up with a basic
sound that can best be described
as "clean."
The album starts out in fine
style with "Everybody Knows
Her," one of the best two or three
songs on the album. Edwards'

voice is a kind of blend of Cat
Stevens and Glen Campbell, if you
can imagine that.
Catchy Melody
"Everybody Knows Her" is
good material for a single, if
Edwards and Capricorn/Atlantic
are so inclined. Besides a catchy
melody, it boasts an interesting
bass line that I was only able to
pick up on the second listen.
"Cold Snow" doesn't go so far
as to destroy the mood set by the
first song, but it certainly doesn't
add to anything. Although
pleasant enough, the song just
doesn't quite make it, perhaps
because of a poorly-used violin by
Stuart Schulman.
The major flaws in the album
are personified in "Dusty
Morning," a much slower and
more "serious" piece. With its
pseudo-poetiC lyrics, it proves
conclusively ti at Jonathan
Edwards is much better when he's
being Jonathan Edwards than
when he's being Bob Dylan. In
addition, it marks the first
appearance of another recurring
problem: the piano just doesn't fit

Catchy Melody
"Everybody Knows Her" is
good material for a single, if
Edwards and Capricorn/Atlantic
are so inclined. Besides a catchy
melody, it boasts an interesting
bass line that I was only able to
pick up on the second listen.
"Cold Snow" doesn't go so far
as to destroy the mood set by the
first song, but it certainly doesn't
add to anything. Although
pleasant enough, the song just
doesn't quite make it, perhaps
because of a poorly-used violin by
Stuart Schulman.
The major flaws in the album
are personified in "Dusty
Morning," a much slower and
more "serious" piece. With its
pseudo-poetiC lyrics, it proves
conclusively ti at Jonathan
Edwards is much better when he's
being Jonathan Edwards than
when he's being Bob Dylan. In
addition, it marks the first
appearance of another recurring
problem: the piano just doesn't fit
the song.
"Shanty" brings back the
problem of Jef Labes' piano: for
Edwards' type of music, Labes is
too full a style, too much
jazz-oriented. He just don't work.
Easily the best song on the
record is "Sunshine," a mover
that starts off side two. Perfectly
timed, perfectly executed,
"Sunshine" more than anything
else demonstrates Edwards'
possibilities. The "dream single"
from the record would be this
backed by "Everybody Knows
Her."
After that masterpiece, "The
King" is a distinct letdown. Labes'
piano gets in the way again.
"Don't Cry Blue" is a typical
rockabilly "I'm-comin'-home"
song. Not so good, not so bad.
After the imperfections of
most of the side, "Train of Glory"
is a refreshing throwback to the
beginning of the album. Starting
with a harp guaranteed to curl
you; hair, this one could come off
a Grateful Dead lp. Especially fine
is a bass line that really comes
through strongly for the first time
on the album.
All told, the album runs, the
gamut of quality from A to Z.
Easily the major areas to which
Edwards should devote himself
are the inconsistencies in the
material and the replacement of
his piano player.
As for the album JONATHAN
EDWARDS itself, it's worth
wading through the bad material
to get at the good. Here's hoping
those flashes of brilliance can be
expanded on Edwards' next
record.
"Tupelo Honey," Van Morrison,
Warner Brothers, ws 1950.
Consider Van Morrison in San
Francisco. In fact, consider him
anywhere and you'll still reach the
same conclusion: he is very, very
good.
And his new album, "Tupelo
Honey," while not quite on a par
with some of his earlier efforts,
certainly does not disprove that
conclusion.
Morrison, of course, first hit in
this country during the so-called
"English invasion" of the early
Sixties. No matter that he comes
from Ireland; he was easily typed.
As lead singer of the group
Them, which never existed
outside a studio, Morrison had a
huge hit single with "Gloria," and
lesser ones with "Mystic Eyes"
and "Here Comes the Night."
Then, Morrison dropped out of
sight, resurfacing just long enough
for a minor hit with "Brown-Eyed
Girl" and an album called
"Blowin' Your Mind," both on
Bang Records.
From there, it was obscurity
until a string of albums, "Astral
Weeks," "Moondance," and "His
and Street Choir," and a
number of hit singles for Warners
elevated him to his current status
as one of the best going.
New Album
"Tupelo Honey," recorded
entirely in San Francisco, opens
with a rocker that is pure
dynamite, "Wild Nights."
Perfectly composed and perfectly
performed, it has proved to be a
killer of a single, equalling and
even surpassing "Domino" off the
last album.
Morrison's voice sets off
Morrison's lyrics superbly. In his
sometimes raspy, unique voice, he
tells us that "all the girls walk by,
dressed up for each other, and the
boys do the boogie woogie, on the
corner of the street." And when
he says that those "wi-i-i-i-ld
nights are callin'," it is Morrison
himself who is calling.
"(Straight to Your Heart) Like
a Cannonball" follows, slowing
down the frenetic pace. "Nice" is
the word to describe it, with a
pleasant flute and background
vocals by the Street Choir.
"Old Old Woodstick," is,
outside of "Wild Nights,"
probably the best song on the
album. It is a dreamy,
well-constructed, mellow piece
that features some fine piano
work by Mark Jordan.
Horns and piano are
temporarily abandoned for
"Starting a New Life," done
basically with acoustic guitars and
harmonica. It is faintly
reminiscent of "Call Me Up in
Dreamland" from "Moondance."
Jazz-Cum -Soul
"You Are My Woman" is, at
six-plus minutes, one of the
longest cuts on the record. It
starts off almost country and
western, but quickly falls into a
sort of jazz-cum-soul Ray Charles
performance.
Side two of the album has only
four songs. "Tupelo Honey" is
mellow Morrison, a very pretty
jazz-oriented piece with an
excellent sax break.
Right about now is where there
should be another real rocker

along the lines of "Come
Running," or a slow but powerful
piece like "Into the Mystic."
Instead, there is a pleasant,
slightly uptempo Scottish
traditional called "I Wanna Roo
You."
"When That Sun Comes" is
again "nice." Van and crew had a
good time doing it, and it comes
over well.
Lacking Power
"Moonshine Whiskey" is also
enjoyable, despite several tempo
changes, but it is not what the
side, and the album as a whole,
needs. What is lacking is a song of
power, a standout if you will.
All told, "Tupelo Honey" is
something less than a
totally-successful album, despite
the preponderance of good and
excellent songs. Without
something to pick up the pace, it
just doesn't move enough,
especially considering that Van
Morrison is one of the finest
rockers around.
As a collection of songs, it is
excellent. As an album, well, it's
better than most of what you hear
today. But not as good as our Van
is capable of.
(Ed's Noteâ€”Van Morrison will
be at Winterland on Friday and
Saturday nights at 8 p.m. Taj
Mahal, Lamb and Wet Willie will
also be on the bill. Tickets are $4
at the door.)

"Jonathan Edwards," Jonathan
Edwards, Capricorn SD 862.
"Jonathan Edwards," says the
press sheet with the copy of his
first album, "is in love . . . with
just about everyone and
everything, but especially with
music. And somehow, the feeling
seems mutual."
Well, let's not go quite that far.
But let's just say that, on the basis
of this effort, Jonathan Edwards
has the potential to be one hell of
an artist.
Edwards, former lead singer of
a little-known group called Sugar
Creek which had one Metromedia
album, has put out a record that
compares favorably with much of
what has been released this year,
and shows an occasional promise
of things to come.
Edwards and his back-up crew
recorded in Boston, but the
record comes through pure
Nashville hillbilly. Using acoustic
and occasional steel guitars, bass,
drums, mouth harp, and
sometimes piano and banjo,
Edwards comes up with a basic
sound that can best be described
as "clean."
The album starts out in fine
style with "Everybody Knows
Her," one of the best two or three
songs on the album. Edwards'

voice is a kind of blend of Cat
Stevens and Glen Campbell, if you
can imagine that.
Catchy Melody
