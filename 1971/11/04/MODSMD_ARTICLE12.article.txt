## I Am Outrunning The Years 
### Sotere Torregian 
/ am outrunning the years
Night / do not know you anymore
/ knew one day / would be caught
like this
The bullet —
hole sings:
The smile of a priest
Atop a brazen column
The ground below of white stones.
The girl who sells fried chicken at
night
in her cardboard house painted
with red bricks
is very sad.
A turtle pulls the portrait of a fine
lady
in white fur toward the smile
of the priest.
O labour
that is my mirror! The eyes!
That incise the yule
of everyone's pardon
Everything is empty if one
considers it empty.
You-now that / catch the ricochet
of the stars' Bakelite-fall —
"Manhattana" flies under your foot

Sotere Torregian is a Stanford
Research Assistant who will give a
poetry reading tonight at 7:30
p.m. in the Granada House lounge
in the Lagunita Complex.

Torregian is one of the three
Surrealist Group poets left in
America, the others being Philip
Lamantia and St.-Geraud.
Surrealism came to be established
briefly in the United States during
World War II with Andre Breton's
exile here.
Breton, the leader of the
movement and a prominent poet
himself, took up residence in New
York City. As a result of Breton's
influence, certain Surrealist poets
and painters came to receive
long-overdue recognition for their
work.
In the 1960'5, the work of the
poets Lamantia, St.-Geraud and
Torregian had a reawakened
interest in the young
counter-culture audience with the
publication of a volume of poetry
called The Young American Poets.
Torregian was born in Newark,
New Jersey in 1941. Both sides of
his family are direct ancestors of
the Moors. In his early home,
English was not spoken as a native
language. Torregian did not gain
familiarity with the English
language until his entrance into
grade school.
Torregian later attended

Rutgers University. During his
stay at Rutgers he became
affiliated with the Surrealist
Movement. In 1962, he left the
University to join with the New
York Group of Poets which
included Leroi Jones.
Torregian has this to say about
his poetry: "It has always been
Love—eros—the force of human
desire, that has guided the poetic
in my life: I have found this to be
the primary motivation."
"I have always found that the
marvelous revealed itself in
Woman. For the Surrealist Poets,
Woman has always been regarded
as the mediatrix of the universe.
This attitude is displayed in
Breton's "L'amour Fou" ("Mad
Love") and also in his
"Arcane-17." For my part, my
tribute is paid in my "Song for
Woman."
"This path has freely chosen
me, is one of my favorite phrases
about the nature of the poet and
poetry. Those who like my poems
should say them when they are
alone and their doors open in the
night. Those who like my poems
and who love, no longer have any

need of saying them."
"Until then, I am a prisoner of.
every foreign language that is not
the universal language of human
desire. Shelley pointed out a long
time ago that the poet is at the
command of man's Unconscious
forces. It is in the Unconscious
where the real forces of poetry
lie—That is true for African
poetry as well as for
American-Indian poetry, as an
example—so that people are living
Shelley's prophecies, as it were,
today in electing free life-styles.
"Poetry is a force of liberation:
of soul and body: the liberation
of desire from all constraints. The
liberation of all men from
Fascism.
"We must enter an Epoch
where we must live the challenge
of the poetic, the truly poetic, the
force of desire, and that
eventually of total liberty!"

Sotere Torregian is a Stanford
Research Assistant who will give a
poetry reading tonight at 7:30
p.m. in the Granada House lounge
in the Lagunita Complex.

Torregian is one of the three
Surrealist Group poets left in
America, the others being Philip
Lamantia and St.-Geraud.
Surrealism came to be established
briefly in the United States during
World War II with Andre Breton's
exile here.
Breton, the leader of the
movement and a prominent poet
himself, took up residence in New
York City. As a result of Breton's
influence, certain Surrealist poets
and painters came to receive
long-overdue recognition for their
work.
In the 1960'5, the work of the
poets Lamantia, St.-Geraud and
Torregian had a reawakened
interest in the young
counter-culture audience with the
publication of a volume of poetry
called The Young American Poets.
Torregian was born in Newark,
New Jersey in 1941. Both sides of
his family are direct ancestors of
the Moors. In his early home,
English was not spoken as a native
language. Torregian did not gain
familiarity with the English
language until his entrance into
grade school.
Torregian later attended

Rutgers University. During his
stay at Rutgers he became
affiliated with the Surrealist
Movement. In 1962, he left the
University to join with the New
York Group of Poets which
included Leroi Jones.
Torregian has this to say about
his poetry: "It has always been
Love—eros—the force of human
desire, that has guided the poetic
in my life: I have found this to be
the primary motivation."
"I have always found that the
marvelous revealed itself in
Woman. For the Surrealist Poets,
Woman has always been regarded
as the mediatrix of the universe.
This attitude is displayed in
Breton's "L'amour Fou" ("Mad
Love") and also in his
"Arcane-17." For my part, my
tribute is paid in my "Song for
Woman."
"This path has freely chosen
me, is one of my favorite phrases
about the nature of the poet and
poetry. Those who like my poems
should say them when they are
alone and their doors open in the
night. Those who like my poems
and who love, no longer have any

need of saying them."
