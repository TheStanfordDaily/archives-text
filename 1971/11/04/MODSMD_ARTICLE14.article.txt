# New 'Math Sciences' Major To Integrate Four Disciplines
## 
### 
C 7
Mathematical Sciences, a new
interdepartmental, interschool
major, will allow undergraduates
to integrate courses in
mathematics, computer science,
operations research and statistics.
Sixteen students have already
elected the new major, according
to Prof. Paul W. Berg,
mathematics, chairman of the
committee directing the program.
"What seems to me most
appealing about the program is
the breadth of action it allows the
students in making career
choices," Prof. Berg says.
Graduates will be prepared for
jobs involving the behavioral and
management sciences, as well as
the application of mathematics to
high-speed computers.
Students interested in the

A
natural sciences and engineering
can design an individualized
program leading to a B.S. in
Mathematics, which includes work
in those areas.
The committee directing the
Mathematical Sciences program
includes Prof. John G. Herriot,
computer sciences; Prof. Rupert
J.G. Miller, Jr., statistics; and
Arthur F. Viennott, Jr.,
operations research, as well as
Prof. Berg.
