# Superb 'Live' Traffic
## 
### PAUL GRUSHKIN 
Two superb live albums were released early this
fall, and although the groups responsible are
generally regarded as two of the very "heaviest,"
they've since sold only moderately well. And
although you wouldn't think they'd need much
publicity they weren't given any to speak of.
Unbelievable, but true, that the
ever-so-long-awaited releases from the Grateful Dead
and Traffic could meet with such a lukewarm
reception. It nearly took Halloween to get the Dead
album moving and Traffic's recent appearance at
Winterland to sell "Welcome to the Canteen" in the
Bay area. Funny, it never used to be that way.
Pity, too. They're both technically magnificent
productions, and if they're at all disappointing, it's
because of the inherent difficulty in capturing on
vinyl the awesome power and emotional frenzy
both groups create and display in concert.
Both albums come off second best to the real
thing, and while that's not hard to believe of the
Dead (although their "Live-Dead" comes pretty
damn close), Traffic had to convince me properly
that live they're even better than their live album.
Winterland Packed
I'm glad that Winterland was packed for their
final Friday night gig, and that most of the audience
stood for the entire hour-and-a-half performance.
Because if Traffic isn't a "heavy" group, nobody is.
A healthy portion of this year's senior class at
Stanford smoked their first grass to the tunes of
"Mr. Fantasy" and "Traffic." A year later students
were being broken in on "John Barleycorn." And
while it was certainly fine music to get stoned by,
their albums featured excellent musicianship—and
on the basis of these studio releases Steve Winwood,
Dave Mason, and Chris Wood became recognized as
three of rock's most talented artists. A Winwood
anthology, in fact, was released this summer.
Traffic, in their years of existence, has not
embarked on many tours across the
States—although they had several memorable nights
on the Fillmore East stage. Their only live release
prior to "Welcome To The Canteen" was half of the
"Last Exit" album.
Many critics feel that a rock group is particularly
noteworthy only if it is able to perform its material
live. Often just as good an indicator is a group's live
album, although many top groups (Santana, Jethro
Tull, etc) have yet to release live albums—and there
have been few enough great live albums (this
reviewer would include the Who's "Live at Leeds,"
Janis' "Cheap Thrills," Albert King's "Live Wire,"

"Live-Dead," 'Hot Tuna," and the Stones" Ya-Yas").
"Welcome to the Canteen" (recorded at Croydon
Hall and at the July, 1971 Oz Benefit Concert) is
significant because it signalled that a) Traffic is
certainly NOT dead, and b) that they are certainly
able to mess up people's heads live in concert. The
album also kicked off their extensive American fall
happily, has been tremendously
successful.
Much of what is on the "Canteen" album was
performed at Winterland, and, for once, a top group
played exactly what the crowd wanted to hear. The
result was one memorable night in San Francisco,
even though Mason (who's featured on the new
album) did not perform. That was just as well;
Traffic's "Mr. Fantasy" and "John Barleycorn"
albums are also "missing" his talents.
"Medicated Goo," which also leads off the
"Canteen" album, began the night in just the right
way—with hard-driving rock 'n roll. Then Jim
Capaldi, who in relinquishing the drumming to Jim
Gordon and "Reebop" Kwaku Baah contented
himself with beating on a tambourine, sang two new
songs which hopefully will appear soon on a
forthcoming studio album.
"Glad" into "Freedom Rider" followed, and the
Chris Wood sax that led the way on the "John
Barleycorn" album was replaced by Winwood's
organ in the second "movement" of the song.
Superb Winwood Vocals
Two acoustic favorites (the first appearing on
"Canteen") "40,000 Headmen" and "John
Barleycorn" took the crowd by surprise. The
wonderfully melodic Winwood vocals, sandwiched
between two lead guitars playing against each other,
were just slightly short of incredible.
Winwood's guitar artistry was especially evident,
as was Chris Wood's ability to switch to organ, flute,
and percussion from his sax. Rick Gretch, of "Blind
Faith" fame, was competent on bass.
"Dear Mr. Fantasy," which followed another
Capaldi arrangement, was perhaps the high point of
a very high evening. It seemed at the time that
Winwood—when he wasn't pounding out a
magnificent organ bottom—sang his very soul into
that song, and while the album version is fine
indeed, the live-before-your eyes version was
overwhelming.
Their only encore (they did not play the usual
two sets) was the old Spencer Davis hit "Gimme
Some Lovin'," which sent everybody home smiling.
Go get that new album. You'll find that Traffic
sure as hell isn't dead.

on the basis of these studio releases Steve Winwood,
Dave Mason, and Chris Wood became recognized as
three of rock's most talented artists. A Winwood
anthology, in fact, was released this summer.
Traffic, in their years of existence, has not
embarked on many tours across the
States—although they had several memorable nights
on the Fillmore East stage. Their only live release
prior to "Welcome To The Canteen" was half of the
"Last Exit" album.
Many critics feel that a rock group is particularly
noteworthy only if it is able to perform its material
live. Often just as good an indicator is a group's live
album, although many top groups (Santana, Jethro
Tull, etc) have yet to release live albums—and there
have been few enough great live albums (this
reviewer would include the Who's "Live at Leeds,"
Janis' "Cheap Thrills," Albert King's "Live Wire,"

"Live-Dead," 'Hot Tuna," and the Stones" Ya-Yas").
"Welcome to the Canteen" (recorded at Croydon
Hall and at the July, 1971 Oz Benefit Concert) is
significant because it signalled that a) Traffic is
certainly NOT dead, and b) that they are certainly
able to mess up people's heads live in concert. The
album also kicked off their extensive American fall
happily, has been tremendously
successful.
Much of what is on the "Canteen" album was
performed at Winterland, and, for once, a top group
played exactly what the crowd wanted to hear. The
result was one memorable night in San Francisco,
even though Mason (who's featured on the new
album) did not perform. That was just as well;
Traffic's "Mr. Fantasy" and "John Barleycorn"
albums are also "missing" his talents.
"Medicated Goo," which also leads off the
"Canteen" album, began the night in just the right
way—with hard-driving rock 'n roll. Then Jim
Capaldi, who in relinquishing the drumming to Jim
Gordon and "Reebop" Kwaku Baah contented
himself with beating on a tambourine, sang two new
songs which hopefully will appear soon on a
forthcoming studio album.
"Glad" into "Freedom Rider" followed, and the
Chris Wood sax that led the way on the "John
Barleycorn" album was replaced by Winwood's
organ in the second "movement" of the song.
Superb Winwood Vocals
Two acoustic favorites (the first appearing on
"Canteen") "40,000 Headmen" and "John
Barleycorn" took the crowd by surprise. The
wonderfully melodic Winwood vocals, sandwiched
between two lead guitars playing against each other,
were just slightly short of incredible.
Winwood's guitar artistry was especially evident,
as was Chris Wood's ability to switch to organ, flute,
and percussion from his sax. Rick Gretch, of "Blind
Faith" fame, was competent on bass.
"Dear Mr. Fantasy," which followed another
Capaldi arrangement, was perhaps the high point of
a very high evening. It seemed at the time that
Winwood—when he wasn't pounding out a
magnificent organ bottom—sang his very soul into
that song, and while the album version is fine
indeed, the live-before-your eyes version was
overwhelming.
Their only encore (they did not play the usual
two sets) was the old Spencer Davis hit "Gimme
Some Lovin'," which sent everybody home smiling.
Go get that new album. You'll find that Traffic
sure as hell isn't dead.

Two superb live albums were released early this
fall, and although the groups responsible are
generally regarded as two of the very "heaviest,"
they've since sold only moderately well. And
although you wouldn't think they'd need much
publicity they weren't given any to speak of.
Unbelievable, but true, that the
ever-so-long-awaited releases from the Grateful Dead
and Traffic could meet with such a lukewarm
reception. It nearly took Halloween to get the Dead
album moving and Traffic's recent appearance at
Winterland to sell "Welcome to the Canteen" in the
Bay area. Funny, it never used to be that way.
Pity, too. They're both technically magnificent
productions, and if they're at all disappointing, it's
because of the inherent difficulty in capturing on
vinyl the awesome power and emotional frenzy
both groups create and display in concert.
Both albums come off second best to the real
thing, and while that's not hard to believe of the
Dead (although their "Live-Dead" comes pretty
damn close), Traffic had to convince me properly
that live they're even better than their live album.
Winterland Packed
I'm glad that Winterland was packed for their
final Friday night gig, and that most of the audience
stood for the entire hour-and-a-half performance.
Because if Traffic isn't a "heavy" group, nobody is.
A healthy portion of this year's senior class at
Stanford smoked their first grass to the tunes of
"Mr. Fantasy" and "Traffic." A year later students
were being broken in on "John Barleycorn." And

Traffic's "Mr. Fantasy" and "John Barleycorn"
albums are also "missing" his talents.
"Medicated Goo," which also leads off the
"Canteen" album, began the night in just the right
way—with hard-driving rock 'n roll. Then Jim
Capaldi, who in relinquishing the drumming to Jim
Gordon and "Reebop" Kwaku Baah contented
himself with beating on a tambourine, sang two new
songs which hopefully will appear soon on a
forthcoming studio album.
"Glad" into "Freedom Rider" followed, and the
Chris Wood sax that led the way on the "John
Barleycorn" album was replaced by Winwood's
organ in the second "movement" of the song.
Superb Winwood Vocals
Two acoustic favorites (the first appearing on
"Canteen") "40,000 Headmen" and "John
Barleycorn" took the crowd by surprise. The
wonderfully melodic Winwood vocals, sandwiched
between two lead guitars playing against each other,
were just slightly short of incredible.
Winwood's guitar artistry was especially evident,
as was Chris Wood's ability to switch to organ, flute,
and percussion from his sax. Rick Gretch, of "Blind
Faith" fame, was competent on bass.
"Dear Mr. Fantasy," which followed another
Capaldi arrangement, was perhaps the high point of
a very high evening. It seemed at the time that
Winwood—when he wasn't pounding out a
magnificent organ bottom—sang his very soul into
that song, and while the album version is fine
indeed, the live-before-your eyes version was
overwhelming.
Their only encore (they did not play the usual
two sets) was the old Spencer Davis hit "Gimme
Some Lovin'," which sent everybody home smiling.
Go get that new album. You'll find that Traffic
sure as hell isn't dead.

Two superb live albums were released early this
fall, and although the groups responsible are
generally regarded as two of the very "heaviest,"
they've since sold only moderately well. And
although you wouldn't think they'd need much
publicity they weren't given any to speak of.
Unbelievable, but true, that the
ever-so-long-awaited releases from the Grateful Dead
and Traffic could meet with such a lukewarm
reception. It nearly took Halloween to get the Dead
album moving and Traffic's recent appearance at
Winterland to sell "Welcome to the Canteen" in the
Bay area. Funny, it never used to be that way.
Pity, too. They're both technically magnificent
productions, and if they're at all disappointing, it's
because of the inherent difficulty in capturing on
vinyl the awesome power and emotional frenzy
both groups create and display in concert.
Both albums come off second best to the real
thing, and while that's not hard to believe of the
Dead (although their "Live-Dead" comes pretty
damn close), Traffic had to convince me properly
that live they're even better than their live album.
Winterland Packed
I'm glad that Winterland was packed for their
final Friday night gig, and that most of the audience
stood for the entire hour-and-a-half performance.
Because if Traffic isn't a "heavy" group, nobody is.
A healthy portion of this year's senior class at
Stanford smoked their first grass to the tunes of
"Mr. Fantasy" and "Traffic." A year later students
were being broken in on "John Barleycorn." And
while it was certainly fine music to get stoned by,
their albums featured excellent musicianship—and
on the basis of these studio releases Steve Winwood,
Dave Mason, and Chris Wood became recognized as
three of rock's most talented artists. A Winwood
anthology, in fact, was released this summer.
Traffic, in their years of existence, has not
embarked on many tours across the
States—although they had several memorable nights
on the Fillmore East stage. Their only live release
prior to "Welcome To The Canteen" was half of the
"Last Exit" album.
Many critics feel that a rock group is particularly
noteworthy only if it is able to perform its material
live. Often just as good an indicator is a group's live
album, although many top groups (Santana, Jethro
Tull, etc) have yet to release live albums—and there
have been few enough great live albums (this
reviewer would include the Who's "Live at Leeds,"
Janis' "Cheap Thrills," Albert King's "Live Wire,"

"Live-Dead," 'Hot Tuna," and the Stones" Ya-Yas").
"Welcome to the Canteen" (recorded at Croydon
Hall and at the July, 1971 Oz Benefit Concert) is
significant because it signalled that a) Traffic is
certainly NOT dead, and b) that they are certainly
able to mess up people's heads live in concert. The
album also kicked off their extensive American fall
happily, has been tremendously
successful.
Much of what is on the "Canteen" album was
performed at Winterland, and, for once, a top group
played exactly what the crowd wanted to hear. The
result was one memorable night in San Francisco,
even though Mason (who's featured on the new
album) did not perform. That was just as well;
Traffic's "Mr. Fantasy" and "John Barleycorn"
albums are also "missing" his talents.
