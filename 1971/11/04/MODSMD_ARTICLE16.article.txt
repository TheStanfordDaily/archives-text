# Jeff Beck Is Back
## 
### MARK SULLIVAN CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
A raucous crowd filled
Winterland Saturday night to
welcome Jeff Beck back to San
Francisco after an almost two
year absence. Despite a generally
jazzier tone and some very mellow
piano interludes, Beck's flashy yet
coherent guitar style was still very
much in evidence.
Beck and his new group won
over a particularly hypercritical
audience which had already
heavily booed the third billed
group, Nazgul, at the end of its
set.
Nazgul certainly deserved all
they got as they bored the crowd
with a leaden attempt at a
synthesis of Jimi Hendrix and
Cream. Their lead guitarist and
singer was simply too involved
with himself to effectively get
into his music.
After a lengthy break, events
took a distinct upward turn with
the appearance of second-billed
Billy Preston and his revue.
Sporting a lemon yellow Buffalo
Bob outfit adorned with knee
length rainbow-hued fringe,
Preston flashed on stage to lead
his ten man troupe in a merely
capable version of "Jumping Jack
Flash." Preston, who has done
session work with Ray Charles,
Aretha Franklin, the Beatles and
the Stones, does both vocals and
keyboards but he is more widely
respected for his instrumental
work.
Mixed Material
He performed a mixture of his
own and other people's material,
doing particularly well with his
own arrangements of "Let It Be"
and "Get Back." Preston
displayed his versatile talents on
the organ with an innovative
arrangement of "Summertime"
featuring his conception of how
Bach and Ray Charles would
interpret the familiar melody.
Among his other effective
numbers were his own
composition, "The Bus Is
Coming," a rather jazzy song with
socially conscious lyrics, and
"That's the Way God Planned It"
a fine moving gospel number. The
only song that he could not get
across was his halting and
uninspired version of "America."
Preston did not get full credit for

his impressive performance from
this Winterland crowd which came
to hear Jeff Beck.
Beck and his sidemen, Bob
Tench (vocals), Max Middleton
(keyboards), Cozy Powell
(drums), and Clive Chaman (bass),
soon gave the audience everything
they wanted with an eclectic
selecting that included material
from both the old and new Jeff
Beck Group, plus some
compositions by other artists.
The group faced its severest
challenge in redoing songs the old
Jeff Beck Group had performed
so magnificently, i.e. "Morning
Dew" and"I Ain't Superstitious."
Tench in particular is bound to be
compared to his vocalist
predecessor, Rod Stewart. He is
not shamed by the comparison.
Straight Blues
"I Ain't Superstitious" was the
only straight blues song Beck
performed Saturday night. His
new material indicates a jazzier
orientation supplementing his
already rock-solid English electric
blues foundation—amply
displayed on his classic first album
"Truth."
Middleton revealed mellow
piano work on "Jody," a song off
Beck's new album "Rough and
Ready" on the Epic label.
"Situation," also off the new
release, featured the easy and
uncluttered bass work of Clive
Chaman. Finally, with the sated
crowd draining their last dregs of
wine (it was that sort of evening),

the group offered "Got a
Feeling," a powerfully done
rocker.
For a change of pace. Beck did
up an arrangement of Bob Dylan's
"Tonight I'll Be Staying Here
With You," and the group's
surprising versatility was further
demonstrated.
It is an indication of Beck's
musicianship that he is able to so
clearly dominate such a talented
group of artists. He is a man who
knows what he wants to display
on stage and how to do it
superbly well. He controls every
aspect of his group's
pe rf ormance — hearing
everything—and so cueing his
sidemen while still managing to
make his renowned guitar
dominate the scene. His current
tour across the States has been
well-received, too.
Beck has been absent from the
rock scene for almost two years,
following the break-up of his first
group and a serious auto accidnet.
The return of one of rock's finest
guitarists on this tour and on the
new album is considerable cause
for rejoicing. Beck's back!
