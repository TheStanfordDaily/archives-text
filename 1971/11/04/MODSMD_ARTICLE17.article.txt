# 'Antony And Cleopatra'
## Tedious ACT Show 
### DOUG ARTHUR 
I'm not sure if it's possible to
produce "Anthony and
Cleopatra" successfully (so that
the audience remains awake, even
if not attentive). I rather doubt it.
The trouble begins with
Shakespeare's play itself.
The more you cut of "Antony
and Cleopatra," the better it gets.
Each act has from two to fifteen
scenes, which renders the play
discursive and lengthy. The
production had only one short
intermission, placed, so far as I
could tell, after the most tedious
scene.
The opening night crowd
worried, over their cocktails,
whether to return after the
intermission or not. Out of a sense
of duty to the theatre (I
presume), they stoically trudged
back to their seats. I'm certain
they regretted their decision.
It's not so much that the two
protagonists aren't fascinating
(they are) as the scope of the
drama is unwieldly. When Antony
says, "You shall not look on me
more," I kept hoping the same
would hold true for the rest of the
cast. It didn't.
Waste of Time
I found it depressing that a
professional company would
waste its time and energy on such
a questionable theatrical work.
The company did cut some scenes
(notably the refreshing scene on
Pompey's ship which would have
added a lighter touch to the play)
since the previews. The thing still
dragged for three hours.
In behalf of Director Allen
Fletcher, I will say that he did
everything imaginable to vitalize
the play. His blocking kept the
stage lively, and he provided
smooth transitions between the
scenes. Fletcher appears quite
adept in handling the difficult
crowd situations.
Ann Roth's costumes "did
beggar all description." Her
opulent gowns for Cleopatra and
her ladies pointed up the disparity
between the Egyptian and Roman
worlds. I especially liked the
queen's jeweled gold crown in the
shape of a peacock.
The sets alone were worth the
price of admission. Nine different

sets, ranging from elaborate
columns and sheer blue curtains
surrounding Cleopatra's gold
crocodile lounge to the simplicity
of an oriental carpet backed by a
pink scrim, located the action.
Visually Exciting
The production has visually
exciting moments, as when the
Egyptian court, banners and fans
waving, swirls around Antony and
the queen in a great melange of
bright colors.
The lighting, designed by T.
Mitchell Dana, made extensive use
of the scrim: different colors
heralding the switch from Rome
to Egypt. The stage was rarely
dark, but when it was, they
played music to help set the
scene. Something vaguely
reminiscent of "Ben Hur" for
Rome and flute music for Egypt.
Michael Learned's Cleopatra
spoke a trifle too fast and much
of her humor was lost in the rush.
She could convey the arbitrariness
of the queen and did possess "an
infinite variety" of emotions.

Scott Thomas as Enobarbus
tended to shout all his lines at a
uniform volume. Which, however,
was not nearly so disconcerting as
his orange face make-up (I have
yet to figure that out.)
Motherly Affection
Ann Weldon presents a wily,
worldly and delightful Charmian.
The Eunuch (Joseph Bird)
displays a motherly affection for
his queen: this directorial touch
stressed Cleopatra's more childlike
qualities.
Ken Ruta gave a masterful
performance as the consummate
warrior and lover. The changes in
his character were not abrupt, as
befits a man of his years and
experience. He did as well as
could be expected in
Shakespeare's strange death scene.
Shaw's "Caesar and Cleopatra"
(currently playing in reportory) is
a much better play, it works
theatrically. Shaw's play excites
you with its succinctness, power
and brevity. Precisely the terms in
which Shakespeare's play fails.
