Rehnquist Testifies
WASHINGTON - William H. Rehnquist implied strongly
yesterday that he would disqualify himself from wiretap
cases if he is confirmed to a seat on the Supreme Court.
Testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee the
nominee defended the Nixon administration's wiretap
policies. But he said surveillance should be used only to
solve or prevent crime—and not to stifle dissent. And he
said the primary purpose of the Bill of Rights is to "put
restraints on the government."
Rehnquist said that as an assistant attorney general he
acted as an adviser on wiretapping and that "if the Justice
Department position was indefensible or personally
obnoxious to me I would have resigned."
Rehnquist was reluctant at times to give his views of
wiretapping, citing an "attorney-client relationship" with
Atty. Gen. John N. Mitchell and with President Nixon.
But drawn out by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., he
made some general observations including that he does not
think government bugging, with and without judicial
warrants, is "pervasive."
Nuclear Test Approved
WASHINGTON — A three-judge federal appeals court
yesterday refused for a second time to halt a massive
nuclear explosion scheduled for Saturday on Amchitka
Island off the Alaskan coast.
The court turned back environmentalist opponents of
the test a few hours after it was disclosed that President
Nixon's top environmental adviser had warned that the
five-megaton blast could set off a chain of earthquakes and
perhaps send a tidal wave across the Pacific Ocean.
The U.S. Court of Appeals decision virtually closed out
any possibility that the underground blast will be stopped.
Opponents of the blast said they would study the
possibility of an appeal to the Supreme Court.
Amchitka Document Bared
WASHINGTON — President Nixon's top environmental
adviser warned, in a secret document made public
yesterday that a planned five-megaton atomic blast on
Amchitka Island could set off a chain of earthquakes like a
line of falling dominos and perhaps send a tidal wave across
the Pacific Ocean.
Environment groups seeking a court injunction to halt
the blast told the U.S. Court of Appeals that the Atomic
Energy Commission, in belittling such hazards, had
deliberately omitted such adverse views from its public
environmental impact statement.
The AEC announced meanwhile it has tentatively
scheduled the blast for Saturday, Nov. 6, at 5 p.m. EST-11
a.m. on Amchitka, an island in the remote Aleutians.
At the same time, the AEC made public four
government documents previously made available only to
attorneys for the seven environment groups headed by the
Committee for Nuclear Responsibility.
Four other documents had been made public earlier, by
court order, and opponents of the atomic test have
appealed also for the release of 10 more documents which
were kept secret.
One of the key documents released Wednesday is an
environmental assessment by Russell E. Train, chairman of
the President's Council on Environmental Quality.
Train told an under-secretaries' committee of the
National Security Council that the huge blast, code-named
"Cannikin," could trigger an earthquake by its direct
impact on earth faults, or by forcing water into faults and
lubricating them.
Train said that earlier, smaller atomic blasts had caused
quakes whose force was always less than the blast itself. If
that pattern were dependable, he said, "then there would
be no apprehension with regard to the Cannikin event."
"Unfortunately, this is not the case," Train said.
Foreign Aid Impass
WASHINGTON — A two-hour discussion between
Secretary of State William P. Rogers and the Senate

Foreign Relations Committee failed yesterday to resolve
the foreign-aid impasse.
Rogers made clear following the session that the
administration still wants an extension until next June of
the program, defeated last week in the Senate, at about
current levels. But Senate critics restated their
determination to force sharp cuts and changes.
In the House, Chairman George H. Mahon of the
Appropriations Committee said he would introduce a
continuing resolution, due for action next week, to extend
the aid program and provide funding of other federal
programs until Congress adjourns—in about a month.
But the continuing resolution, a device used to keep
programs operating when regular appropriations bills
remain unpassed, faces stiff opposition in the Senate. It
would, in effect, keep the defeated aid program in
operation.
Laird In Saigon
SAIGON — Secretary of Defense Melvin R. Laird met the
top U.S. officials in Saigon last night to discuss plans to
send thousands of Gls home for Christmas.
Laird said American battlefield casualties for the
seven-day period ended last Saturday were the lowest at
any time since March 1965, when U.S. forces expanded
their mission from an advisory role to include combat
operations.
Although Laird declined to say how many U.S. soldiers
were killed in action during the period, informants put the
toll at two.
Laird's mission here, which he said President Nixon had
directed, started with talks which began immediately after
his 8 :30 p.m. arrival from Washington.
Agnew
MIAMI BEACH, Fla. - Vice President Spiro T. Agnew
accused five Democratic presidential hopefuls yesterday of
a "callow retreat" by playing politics when they should
have been voting on foreign aid in the Senate.
He singled out Sens. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.;
Edmund Muskie, D-Maine; George McGovern, D-S.D.;
Hubert H. Humphrey, D-Minn.; and Henry Jackson,
D-Wash.
"The country needed leadership last week," Agnew said,
referring to the defeat of the two-China policy in the
United Nations and the Senate's defeat of the foreign aid
bill.
"When the nation looked to those members of the other
party who would have his office when it looked to Sens.
Kennedy, Muskie, McGovern, Humphrey and Jackson-it
found them safely bringing up the rear and diverting
attention from their callow retreat by playing politics with
national issues," Agnew said.
He addressed the National Association of Mutual
Insurance Agents convention.
Berkeley Rejects Proposal
BERKELEY — The Berkeley City Council has rejected a
proposal that would have offered the City Hall as a
sanctuary for sailors of the USS Coral Sea who seek to
prevent the aircraft carrier from sailing to Vietnam.
The council, however, passed a motion stating its
support for the rebelling sailors and urging Berkeleyans to
"aid in the welfare and legal protection of these men."
A group of sailors from the ship now docked at the
Alameda Naval Air Station told the council that more than
1 ,200 of the 4,500 crew members signed a petition asking
Congress to cancel an order for their ship to return to the
Vietnam War.
Oath Required
WASHINGTON - Secretary of State William P. Rogers has
ordered that every person applying for a passport be
required to take an oath of allegiance, ending for the time
being at least a dispute dating to the 19505.
State Department officials acknowledged yesterday that
Rogers had decided on a mandatory oath even though
recent Supreme Court decisions have eased restrictions on
passport applications.

MIAMI BEACH, Fla. - Vice President Spiro T. Agnew
accused five Democratic presidential hopefuls yesterday of
a "callow retreat" by playing politics when they should
have been voting on foreign aid in the Senate.
He singled out Sens. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.;
Edmund Muskie, D-Maine; George McGovern, D-S.D.;
Hubert H. Humphrey, D-Minn.; and Henry Jackson,
D-Wash.
"The country needed leadership last week," Agnew said,
referring to the defeat of the two-China policy in the
United Nations and the Senate's defeat of the foreign aid
bill.
"When the nation looked to those members of the other
party who would have his office when it looked to Sens.
Kennedy, Muskie, McGovern, Humphrey and Jackson-it
found them safely bringing up the rear and diverting
attention from their callow retreat by playing politics with
national issues," Agnew said.
He addressed the National Association of Mutual
Insurance Agents convention.
Berkeley Rejects Proposal
BERKELEY — The Berkeley City Council has rejected a
proposal that would have offered the City Hall as a
sanctuary for sailors of the USS Coral Sea who seek to
prevent the aircraft carrier from sailing to Vietnam.
The council, however, passed a motion stating its
support for the rebelling sailors and urging Berkeleyans to
"aid in the welfare and legal protection of these men."
A group of sailors from the ship now docked at the
Alameda Naval Air Station told the council that more than
1 ,200 of the 4,500 crew members signed a petition asking
Congress to cancel an order for their ship to return to the
Vietnam War.
Oath Required
WASHINGTON - Secretary of State William P. Rogers has
ordered that every person applying for a passport be
required to take an oath of allegiance, ending for the time
being at least a dispute dating to the 19505.
State Department officials acknowledged yesterday that
Rogers had decided on a mandatory oath even though
recent Supreme Court decisions have eased restrictions on
passport applications.
Rehnquist Testifies
WASHINGTON - William H. Rehnquist implied strongly
yesterday that he would disqualify himself from wiretap
cases if he is confirmed to a seat on the Supreme Court.
Testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee the
nominee defended the Nixon administration's wiretap
policies. But he said surveillance should be used only to
solve or prevent crime—and not to stifle dissent. And he
said the primary purpose of the Bill of Rights is to "put
restraints on the government."
Rehnquist said that as an assistant attorney general he
acted as an adviser on wiretapping and that "if the Justice
Department position was indefensible or personally
obnoxious to me I would have resigned."
Rehnquist was reluctant at times to give his views of
wiretapping, citing an "attorney-client relationship" with
Atty. Gen. John N. Mitchell and with President Nixon.
But drawn out by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., he
made some general observations including that he does not
think government bugging, with and without judicial
warrants, is "pervasive."
Nuclear Test Approved
WASHINGTON — A three-judge federal appeals court
yesterday refused for a second time to halt a massive
nuclear explosion scheduled for Saturday on Amchitka
Island off the Alaskan coast.
The court turned back environmentalist opponents of
the test a few hours after it was disclosed that President
Nixon's top environmental adviser had warned that the
five-megaton blast could set off a chain of earthquakes and
perhaps send a tidal wave across the Pacific Ocean.
The U.S. Court of Appeals decision virtually closed out
any possibility that the underground blast will be stopped.
Opponents of the blast said they would study the
possibility of an appeal to the Supreme Court.
Amchitka Document Bared
WASHINGTON — President Nixon's top environmental
adviser warned, in a secret document made public
yesterday that a planned five-megaton atomic blast on
Amchitka Island could set off a chain of earthquakes like a
line of falling dominos and perhaps send a tidal wave across
the Pacific Ocean.
Environment groups seeking a court injunction to halt
the blast told the U.S. Court of Appeals that the Atomic
Energy Commission, in belittling such hazards, had
deliberately omitted such adverse views from its public
environmental impact statement.
The AEC announced meanwhile it has tentatively
scheduled the blast for Saturday, Nov. 6, at 5 p.m. EST-11
a.m. on Amchitka, an island in the remote Aleutians.
At the same time, the AEC made public four
government documents previously made available only to
attorneys for the seven environment groups headed by the
Committee for Nuclear Responsibility.
Four other documents had been made public earlier, by
court order, and opponents of the atomic test have
appealed also for the release of 10 more documents which
were kept secret.
One of the key documents released Wednesday is an
environmental assessment by Russell E. Train, chairman of
the President's Council on Environmental Quality.
Train told an under-secretaries' committee of the
National Security Council that the huge blast, code-named
"Cannikin," could trigger an earthquake by its direct
impact on earth faults, or by forcing water into faults and
lubricating them.
Train said that earlier, smaller atomic blasts had caused
quakes whose force was always less than the blast itself. If
that pattern were dependable, he said, "then there would
be no apprehension with regard to the Cannikin event."
"Unfortunately, this is not the case," Train said.
Foreign Aid Impass
WASHINGTON — A two-hour discussion between
Secretary of State William P. Rogers and the Senate

Foreign Relations Committee failed yesterday to resolve
the foreign-aid impasse.
Rogers made clear following the session that the
administration still wants an extension until next June of
the program, defeated last week in the Senate, at about
current levels. But Senate critics restated their
determination to force sharp cuts and changes.
In the House, Chairman George H. Mahon of the
Appropriations Committee said he would introduce a
continuing resolution, due for action next week, to extend
the aid program and provide funding of other federal
programs until Congress adjourns—in about a month.
But the continuing resolution, a device used to keep
programs operating when regular appropriations bills
remain unpassed, faces stiff opposition in the Senate. It
would, in effect, keep the defeated aid program in
operation.
Laird In Saigon
SAIGON — Secretary of Defense Melvin R. Laird met the
top U.S. officials in Saigon last night to discuss plans to
send thousands of Gls home for Christmas.
Laird said American battlefield casualties for the
seven-day period ended last Saturday were the lowest at
any time since March 1965, when U.S. forces expanded
their mission from an advisory role to include combat
operations.
Although Laird declined to say how many U.S. soldiers
were killed in action during the period, informants put the
toll at two.
Laird's mission here, which he said President Nixon had
directed, started with talks which began immediately after
his 8 :30 p.m. arrival from Washington.

"Cannikin," could trigger an earthquake by its direct
impact on earth faults, or by forcing water into faults and
lubricating them.
Train said that earlier, smaller atomic blasts had caused
quakes whose force was always less than the blast itself. If
that pattern were dependable, he said, "then there would
be no apprehension with regard to the Cannikin event."
"Unfortunately, this is not the case," Train said.
Foreign Aid Impass
WASHINGTON — A two-hour discussion between
Secretary of State William P. Rogers and the Senate

Foreign Relations Committee failed yesterday to resolve
the foreign-aid impasse.
Rogers made clear following the session that the
administration still wants an extension until next June of
the program, defeated last week in the Senate, at about
current levels. But Senate critics restated their
determination to force sharp cuts and changes.
In the House, Chairman George H. Mahon of the
Appropriations Committee said he would introduce a
continuing resolution, due for action next week, to extend
the aid program and provide funding of other federal
programs until Congress adjourns—in about a month.
But the continuing resolution, a device used to keep
programs operating when regular appropriations bills
remain unpassed, faces stiff opposition in the Senate. It
would, in effect, keep the defeated aid program in
operation.
Laird In Saigon
SAIGON — Secretary of Defense Melvin R. Laird met the
top U.S. officials in Saigon last night to discuss plans to
send thousands of Gls home for Christmas.
Laird said American battlefield casualties for the
seven-day period ended last Saturday were the lowest at
any time since March 1965, when U.S. forces expanded
their mission from an advisory role to include combat
operations.
Although Laird declined to say how many U.S. soldiers
were killed in action during the period, informants put the
toll at two.
Laird's mission here, which he said President Nixon had
directed, started with talks which began immediately after
his 8 :30 p.m. arrival from Washington.
Agnew
MIAMI BEACH, Fla. - Vice President Spiro T. Agnew
accused five Democratic presidential hopefuls yesterday of
a "callow retreat" by playing politics when they should
have been voting on foreign aid in the Senate.
He singled out Sens. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.;
Edmund Muskie, D-Maine; George McGovern, D-S.D.;
Hubert H. Humphrey, D-Minn.; and Henry Jackson,
D-Wash.
"The country needed leadership last week," Agnew said,
referring to the defeat of the two-China policy in the
United Nations and the Senate's defeat of the foreign aid
bill.
"When the nation looked to those members of the other
party who would have his office when it looked to Sens.
Kennedy, Muskie, McGovern, Humphrey and Jackson-it
found them safely bringing up the rear and diverting
attention from their callow retreat by playing politics with
national issues," Agnew said.
He addressed the National Association of Mutual
Insurance Agents convention.
Berkeley Rejects Proposal
BERKELEY — The Berkeley City Council has rejected a
proposal that would have offered the City Hall as a
sanctuary for sailors of the USS Coral Sea who seek to
prevent the aircraft carrier from sailing to Vietnam.
The council, however, passed a motion stating its
support for the rebelling sailors and urging Berkeleyans to
"aid in the welfare and legal protection of these men."
A group of sailors from the ship now docked at the
Alameda Naval Air Station told the council that more than
1 ,200 of the 4,500 crew members signed a petition asking
Congress to cancel an order for their ship to return to the
Vietnam War.
Oath Required
WASHINGTON - Secretary of State William P. Rogers has
ordered that every person applying for a passport be
required to take an oath of allegiance, ending for the time
being at least a dispute dating to the 19505.
State Department officials acknowledged yesterday that
Rogers had decided on a mandatory oath even though
recent Supreme Court decisions have eased restrictions on
passport applications.
Rehnquist Testifies
WASHINGTON - William H. Rehnquist implied strongly
yesterday that he would disqualify himself from wiretap
cases if he is confirmed to a seat on the Supreme Court.
Testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee the
nominee defended the Nixon administration's wiretap
policies. But he said surveillance should be used only to
solve or prevent crime—and not to stifle dissent. And he
said the primary purpose of the Bill of Rights is to "put
restraints on the government."
Rehnquist said that as an assistant attorney general he
acted as an adviser on wiretapping and that "if the Justice
Department position was indefensible or personally
obnoxious to me I would have resigned."
Rehnquist was reluctant at times to give his views of
wiretapping, citing an "attorney-client relationship" with
Atty. Gen. John N. Mitchell and with President Nixon.
But drawn out by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., he
made some general observations including that he does not
think government bugging, with and without judicial
warrants, is "pervasive."
Nuclear Test Approved
WASHINGTON — A three-judge federal appeals court
yesterday refused for a second time to halt a massive
nuclear explosion scheduled for Saturday on Amchitka
Island off the Alaskan coast.
The court turned back environmentalist opponents of
the test a few hours after it was disclosed that President
Nixon's top environmental adviser had warned that the
five-megaton blast could set off a chain of earthquakes and
perhaps send a tidal wave across the Pacific Ocean.
The U.S. Court of Appeals decision virtually closed out
any possibility that the underground blast will be stopped.
Opponents of the blast said they would study the
possibility of an appeal to the Supreme Court.
Amchitka Document Bared
WASHINGTON — President Nixon's top environmental
adviser warned, in a secret document made public
yesterday that a planned five-megaton atomic blast on
Amchitka Island could set off a chain of earthquakes like a
line of falling dominos and perhaps send a tidal wave across
the Pacific Ocean.
Environment groups seeking a court injunction to halt
the blast told the U.S. Court of Appeals that the Atomic
Energy Commission, in belittling such hazards, had
deliberately omitted such adverse views from its public
environmental impact statement.
The AEC announced meanwhile it has tentatively
scheduled the blast for Saturday, Nov. 6, at 5 p.m. EST-11
a.m. on Amchitka, an island in the remote Aleutians.
At the same time, the AEC made public four
government documents previously made available only to
attorneys for the seven environment groups headed by the
Committee for Nuclear Responsibility.
Four other documents had been made public earlier, by
court order, and opponents of the atomic test have
appealed also for the release of 10 more documents which
were kept secret.
One of the key documents released Wednesday is an
environmental assessment by Russell E. Train, chairman of
the President's Council on Environmental Quality.
Train told an under-secretaries' committee of the
National Security Council that the huge blast, code-named
"Cannikin," could trigger an earthquake by its direct
impact on earth faults, or by forcing water into faults and
lubricating them.
