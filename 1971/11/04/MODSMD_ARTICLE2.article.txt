# Protesting Students Map Actions After Recruitment 'Discussions'
## 
### DAVID THIEMANN 
A meeting of about 40 people
decided last night to recommend that a
noon rally today "discuss the most
effective way to stop Honeywell from
recruiting at Stanford," and act upon
its decision.
Honeywell, Inc. was the 16th largest
military industry in the nation during
1970, with $397 million in defense
department contracts. It manufactures
antipersonnel weapons, including
beehive and cluster bombs, electronic
equipment, missile systems, and
vehicles for military use.
TRW Systems Group, the 34th
largest military contractor in 1970,
with $184 million in defense work, will
recruit today as well.
The group has scheduled a rally at
12:30 p.m. in front of the Placement
Center, at which Richard Falk, a
Princeton University expert on
international law, will speak upon the
connections between the Nuremberg
principles, international law, and
Honeywell.
Diane Fields, of the ASSU Council
of Presidents, wrote President Lyman
yesterday inviting him to "attend the
rally at noon tomorrow" to "represent
your side of the issue."
Yesterday about 65 people entered
the placement building to hold
"non-disruptive discussions" and
"rational dialogue" with recruiters and
office staff members, after participating
in a noon rally which attracted 150
people.
The demonstrators inside the
building included members of the

Young Crows, the Columbae
community, and Venceremos, all of
whom joined in long discussions with
J.B. Sparhawk, a recruiter for General
Motors Research Labs, who has
interviews tomorrow; Ralph Keller,
Director of Placement Center; and two
or three police officers and
photographers who observed the
discussions.
Members of Venceremos read
excerpts from recruiting literature on
the CIA, the armed forces, and defense
industries on a bullhorn for about ten
minutes during the "discussions."
Sparhawk, the GM representative,
adamantly denied that his division of
the parent company was involved in
any war-related research. When asked
what his response to an ASSU Council
of Presidents letter requesting GM to
refrain from recruiting on the Stanford
campus, he replied "I'm here."
Three protestors attempted to sign
up for interviews with defense industry
recruiters next week, but were denied
appointments because they are
sophomores.
The demonstrators dwindled rapidly
in strength, and, while some literature
was taken from the building, they did
not remove any signup lists from the
walls.
Though Keller did not invoke the
University disruption policy, he
commented that "anyone who is
familiar with out operation knows it
has been interfered with."
Keller noted that if material was
stolen from the building, entrances
were blocked, or protestors interfered
with private interviews, a disruption

would definitely have occurred, and"I
would not hesitate to make a decision
to invoke the policy.
Participants in the meeting last night
discussed "action that will cause a
reaction from the administration, and
increase the political ferment" on
campus.
The group agreed that Honeywell is
a war criminal, in violation of the
Nuremberg principles, and also agreed
that it would "seek ways to implement
the policy set by the (spring)
referendum." This referendum, passed
by a 1758-1596 vote, would "prohibit
the use of Stanford lands by
corporations that are directly
producing material and research for the
military. .."
The recruiting issue is now a
"reserved item" on the agenda of the
Faculty Senate Steering Committee,
pending a report from President Lyman
who, according to a letter from Senate
President Sanford Dornbusch, released
by Dave Josephson (a leader among the
placement demonstrators), "is now
considering ways of resolving this
difficult matter."
The Committee on Services to
Students, which is studying the
recruiting problem at Lyman's request,
will hold "open meetings," at which
interested individuals and spokesmen
for organizations may testify after two
new student members of the committee
are appointed.
The group also planned
"propaganda" activities in all dorms
during breakfast and lunch today, and
agreed to print a leaflet detailing
Honeywell's "war crimes."
