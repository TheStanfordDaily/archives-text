# Prof Discusses Psychic Powers
## 
### PATTY FELS 
Calling psychic research "the most
important question for science and
religion today," Humanities Professor
Jeffrey Smith discussed the discovery
and development of individual powers
at the second Human Potential
psychology lecture Tuesday.
Smith feels that everyone is psychic
if he "allows his psychic nature to enter
into consciousness." He insists that we
are surrounded by tremendous powers
of which we are unaware and that we
are all connected "like leaves on a
tree."
To develop these powers, Smith
suggests that one should first come to
know what he is. He described man as
an "island universe with thousands of
life systems within him." Communion
with psychic spirits is possible when a
man becomes radiant. Radiation from
other lives flow into oneself and is
reflected back.
After achieving communication,
man becomes powerful by conversing
with thedead and the unborn. To avoid
attracting evil powers, he must intend

to use his knowledge in a selfless
â€¢manner. Smith criticized those who
employ psychic foresight for personal
profit.
Admitting that the powers may be a
primitive regression into the past,
Smith warned against "milking
ourselves into the sea of existence." He
labelled "atavistic, destructive and
dangerous" those forces wich have been
lost during evolution but remain hidden
within the psyche.
He believes, however, that aided by
his new knowledge, man is actually
being raised to a higher power and is
moving to a "divine level of existence."
This is a step forward in the
evolutionary process.
Prayer, to Smith, is the most widely
accepted spiritual communication.
Since he considers telepathy a fact, he
feels that prayer can be very powerful
and may reach beyond the boundaries
of space and time. It can have a
dramatic effect on the future if
exercised properly.
After his speech. Smith conducted
an experiment on his listeners. In three

instances they were asked to choose
between two poetic passages.
Unfortunately, the audience responded
nearly equally and Smith dubbed the
experiment "a total failure." He was
not disappointed, though, since he
wants his experiments to be "life-giving
and enjoyable."
In his parapsychological seminars,
Smith emphasized the establishment of
communication with inanimate objects.
During one session he communicated
with an ashtray which remains in his
memory and has become beautiful for
him.
A telepathic dream caused Smith to
take up parapsychological research 15
years ago. He says he is not extremely
psychic but can become so under
self-hypnosis. In answer to a question
regarding psychic foods, Smith
recommended coffee to heighten
perception.
A large sum of money for
psychological research was left to
Stanford by the founder's brother.
However, since the wording of the will
was not exact, most of the money was
used for other purposes.
