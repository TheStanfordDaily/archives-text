# Lowenstein Presses Liberal Aims
## 
### DANIEL BRENNER 
Allard Lowenstein is somewhat of a
contradiction in terms. If one judges
him from his physical looks, he has all
the ferocity of a pipsqueak. But if one
looks at recent political history, he
comes off as a giant-slayer with his
giant being no less than the President of
the United States in 1968.
The former Democratic

Congressman from New York is at
Stanford for a month as a visiting
lecturer in the Human Biology
Program. However, he is no newcomer
to the Farm. He came here in 1961 as a
professor and part-time Assistant Dean
of Students, but stayed only one year.
"I left in disagreement with
administration policies that I thought
were 'very peculiar," he said. Back in

those years it was verboten to have
co-educational dormitories or debates
on topics like nuclear testing.
He went to teach full time at North
Carolina State but often visited the
Stanford campus to recruit students for
the Mississippi voter projects in the
mid-sixties. He was amazed at the
"overpowering" response of the
student body. In those days political
activism at Stanford carried a certain
seriousness.
Lowenstein believes that the
commitment shown in those days,
especially at Stnaford, was the first
clear indication of what students could
achieve. "Stanford was a regressive
place then," the former Congressman
said. "You didn't do things like that
lightly."
Lowenstein's political pace the last
15 years has been frenetic but
consistently representative of
Democratic liberalism. In 1960 he
opposed the nomination of Lyndon
Johnson for Vice-President at the
Democratic Convention.
In 1964 he was an organizer of the
Mississippi Freedom Party slate. And in
1968, even his critics admit that the
then-Congressman was the architect of
the "Dump Johnson" movement.
Dump Nixon
Now the former president of the
National Student Association is back
on dumping grounds again. Only this
time the battle cry is Dump Nixon, and
he believes his chances are better.
He has been touring the country to
get 18-year-olds to register. He believes
Nixon will receive very few of those
votes but that unless the Democrats
nominate an acceptable candidate to
the disenfranchised Left, most of the
youth vote will not surface at all.
Lowenstein, who contends that he
was "gerrymandered out of office" in
New York, has not ventured into the

arena of radical politics. He fiercely
condemns violence for violence sake.
As for trashing, he thinks "it's a very
viable tactic if you're for Nixon,"
suggesting that adverse media exposure
impairs the anti-war forces.
"I've never understood how blowing
up a toilet in the U.S. Senate is going to
change anything," he concluded.
He believes the great majority of
students today are partly sympathetic
to radical ideas, partly suspect of
radical means, partly want to junk it all
and live in the mountains, and partly go
into drugs because people don't relate
to each other anymore.
Psychic Restitution
Campuses erupt, Lowenstein
believes, because "people get sick of
irrational, sick behavior." Then there
are periods not of apathy, but of
"psychic restitution." Despite the
relative calm across the nation, he feels
"frustrations are at a very high point
for a high number of poeple."
On the subject of Congressman Pete
McCloskey's entry into the Presidential
race, Lowenstein had nothing but
praise.
McCloskey, he believes, has shown
there is a place for morality in politics.
Although he's not supporting him for
president, he believes he is "one of the
few great men of the political system
today. Nobody's perfect, but he comes
closer to it than anyone else I know."
As of yet, Lowenstein is still being
wooed by the potential Democratic
candidates and hasn't decided who is
going to be his choice. But if he doesn't
know who he's for, he's quite sure of
who he's against—Richard Nixon.
Right now many feel he hasn't a
chance to dump the President. But even
his greatest detractors maintain the
suspicion that Allard Lowenstein may
yet have another day of reckoning with
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

comes off as a giant-slayer with his
giant being no less than the President of
the United States in 1968.
The former Democratic

Congressman from New York is at
Stanford for a month as a visiting
lecturer in the Human Biology
Program. However, he is no newcomer
to the Farm. He came here in 1961 as a
professor and part-time Assistant Dean
of Students, but stayed only one year.
"I left in disagreement with
administration policies that I thought
were 'very peculiar," he said. Back in

those years it was verboten to have
co-educational dormitories or debates
on topics like nuclear testing.
He went to teach full time at North
Carolina State but often visited the
Stanford campus to recruit students for
the Mississippi voter projects in the
mid-sixties. He was amazed at the
"overpowering" response of the
student body. In those days political
activism at Stanford carried a certain
seriousness.
Lowenstein believes that the
commitment shown in those days,
especially at Stnaford, was the first
clear indication of what students could
achieve. "Stanford was a regressive
place then," the former Congressman
said. "You didn't do things like that
lightly."
Lowenstein's political pace the last
15 years has been frenetic but
consistently representative of
Democratic liberalism. In 1960 he
opposed the nomination of Lyndon
Johnson for Vice-President at the
Democratic Convention.
In 1964 he was an organizer of the
Mississippi Freedom Party slate. And in
1968, even his critics admit that the
then-Congressman was the architect of
the "Dump Johnson" movement.
Dump Nixon
Now the former president of the
National Student Association is back
on dumping grounds again. Only this
time the battle cry is Dump Nixon, and
he believes his chances are better.
He has been touring the country to
get 18-year-olds to register. He believes
Nixon will receive very few of those
votes but that unless the Democrats
nominate an acceptable candidate to
the disenfranchised Left, most of the
youth vote will not surface at all.
Lowenstein, who contends that he
was "gerrymandered out of office" in
New York, has not ventured into the

arena of radical politics. He fiercely
condemns violence for violence sake.
As for trashing, he thinks "it's a very
viable tactic if you're for Nixon,"
suggesting that adverse media exposure
impairs the anti-war forces.
"I've never understood how blowing
up a toilet in the U.S. Senate is going to
change anything," he concluded.
He believes the great majority of
students today are partly sympathetic
to radical ideas, partly suspect of
radical means, partly want to junk it all
and live in the mountains, and partly go
into drugs because people don't relate
to each other anymore.
Psychic Restitution
Campuses erupt, Lowenstein
believes, because "people get sick of
irrational, sick behavior." Then there
are periods not of apathy, but of
"psychic restitution." Despite the
relative calm across the nation, he feels
"frustrations are at a very high point
for a high number of poeple."
On the subject of Congressman Pete
McCloskey's entry into the Presidential
race, Lowenstein had nothing but
praise.
McCloskey, he believes, has shown
there is a place for morality in politics.
Although he's not supporting him for
president, he believes he is "one of the
few great men of the political system
today. Nobody's perfect, but he comes
closer to it than anyone else I know."
As of yet, Lowenstein is still being
wooed by the potential Democratic
candidates and hasn't decided who is
going to be his choice. But if he doesn't
know who he's for, he's quite sure of
who he's against—Richard Nixon.
Right now many feel he hasn't a
chance to dump the President. But even
his greatest detractors maintain the
suspicion that Allard Lowenstein may
yet have another day of reckoning with
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.


DUMP NlXON?—Former New York Congressman Allard Lowenstein, architect of
the 1968 "Dump Johnson" movement, hopes to pull off a similar political coup in
the 197 2 presidential race.
Allard Lowenstein is somewhat of a
contradiction in terms. If one judges
him from his physical looks, he has all
the ferocity of a pipsqueak. But if one
looks at recent political history, he
comes off as a giant-slayer with his
giant being no less than the President of
the United States in 1968.
