# North Cal ACLU Requests Time For Argument In Franklin Case
## 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
The American Civil Liberties Union
of Northern California (ACLUNC)
yesterday requested 30 minutes to
present an oral argument in the
Franklin hearing.
Prof. Alan Dershowitz of the
Harvard Law School and currently at
the Center for Advanced Study of
Behavioral Sciences here made the
request on behalf of ACLUNC.
In a letter to the Advisory Board

dated yesterday, Dershowitz said
ACLUNC wishes to "articulate civil
liberty issues that we think are or may
be at stake in this proceeding and
insure that these issues are given
adequate weight in any decision that
may be arrived at by the Board."
Dershowitz added that ACLUNC
wished to enter the case as amicus
curiae, or friend of the court. In other
words, it would not enter the case on
the side of either party.
Franklin Motion
At the end of yesterday's hearing
Franklin moved that the request be
granted. He added that if necessary, he
would give ACLUNC 30 minutes of the
four hours allocated for his own closing
oral argument.
Dershowitz's letter indicated that
Administration attorney Raymond
Fisher was opposed to oral argument
but would accept written briefs being
submitted to the Board.
Advisory Board Chairman Donald
Kennedy said that the Board had only
received the letter late in the morning
and would further consider the request.
The Board had denied a request by a
group of faculty members to present

oral argument earlier in the case, but
had allowed written briefs.
At yesterday's hearing, Franklin
presented his surrebuttal testimony.
Blank Testifies
Owen Blank, a third year law
student and a KZSU reporter at the
Computation Center on February 10
characterized the reporting of a fellow
KZSU newsman John Broholme that
day as "inaccurate from what 1 could
put together."
In its rebuttal testimony on Tuesday
the Administration had played a tape
of a KZSU broadcast of events at the
Comp Center on the 10th in which
Broholm had said that Franklin was
"haranguing" the crowd outside the
Comp Center. On the same tape, Blank,
in summing up Broholme's report, had
said this had changed "the whole
momentum of the crowd" reversing it
back toward police lines.
Franklin has been charged with
inciting the crowd to turn back on the
police after they had been dispersing
peacefully.
But yesterday Blank said he had
