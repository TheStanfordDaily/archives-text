# Student Interest Varies
## 
### GLENN GARVIN Commentary 
Every day less than half of the 100
seats in the Physics Lecture Hall that
have been allotted to spectators at the
Bruce Franklin hearings are empty.
Yet two dozen students are so
feverishly interested that they have
formed a SWOPSI course on the
hearings.
The two rooms originally open for a
closed-circuit viewing of the hearing
have closed—because their audience
dwindled away to nothing. Yet when
campus radio station KZSU dropped its
broadcast of the hearing, 200 irate
callers forced the news department to
reconsider and put the trial back onto
the air.
That pretty much sums up how the
campus feels about the
hearings—ambivalent. For every
sympton of interest, there exists
another of total apathy.
Is the campus interested or not?
Ask that question of Francis
Dickerson, program director at KZSU,
and he'll tell you "yes." was
station when the calls about the hearing
started coming in.
"I don't think you can say it was a
conspiracy or anything," he says,

shaking his head. "The calls were all
different. At first I would explain that
we were going to do a two-minute
wrap-up each night on the thing, but
that didn't satisfy anyone. Finally
somebody said, 'We can get music on
KSJO (in San Jose) but we can't get
Bruce Franklin anywhere but KZSU.'
That convinced me."
