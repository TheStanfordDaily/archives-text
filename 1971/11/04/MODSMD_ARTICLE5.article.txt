# Student Interest Varies
## 
### GLENN GARVIN Commentary 
Every day less than half of the 100
seats in the Physics Lecture Hall that
have been allotted to spectators at the
Bruce Franklin hearings are empty.
Yet two dozen students are so
feverishly interested that they have
formed a SWOPSI course on the
hearings.
The two rooms originally open for a
closed-circuit viewing of the hearing
have closed—because their audience
dwindled away to nothing. Yet when
campus radio station KZSU dropped its
broadcast of the hearing, 200 irate
callers forced the news department to
reconsider and put the trial back onto
the air.
That pretty much sums up how the
campus feels about the
hearings—ambivalent. For every
sympton of interest, there exists
another of total apathy.
Is the campus interested or not?
Ask that question of Francis
Dickerson, program director at KZSU,
and he'll tell you "yes." was
station when the calls about the hearing
started coming in.
"I don't think you can say it was a
conspiracy or anything," he says,

shaking his head. "The calls were all
different. At first I would explain that
we were going to do a two-minute
wrap-up each night on the thing, but
that didn't satisfy anyone. Finally
somebody said, 'We can get music on
KSJO (in San Jose) but we can't get
Bruce Franklin anywhere but KZSU.'
That convinced me."
He feels interest is still "fairly good"
although the hearing is in its sixth
week: "I walk down the hall of my
dorm and half of the rooms have KZSU
on."
On the other hand, sophomore
Emily Raskin claims that "it's dragged
on too long now. Everyone is interested
in the outcome, but no one wants to
see these proceedings."
One male senior who asked not to
be identified (it's curious the number
of people who say "I don't want to get
involved in anything political" when
questioned about the Franklin case)
points out that "this is all seven months
after the fact as far as the first
disruption is concerned. This campus
doesn't have an attention span of more
than a week."
"Perry Mason" Interest
Colin Hunter, another senior, backs
up that contention. "They're tired of
the whole thing—it's been happening
since last spring. A lot of people have a
Perry Mason tpye interest—the big
courtroom battle, you know—and a lot
are curious—but no one is very
passionate at this point."
Yet that isn't entirely true either.
Scarcely a day goes by without at least
two letters in the Daily concerning
Frnaklin. P'aculty members who held
debates on the matter in individual
dorms under the auspices of ASSU
drew packed houses. There are even
people who are "hearing freaks"- who
attend each session for the entire five
hours. One freshman confides that he's
taken 150 pages of notes in the Physics
hall since the hearing began September
27. "I don't know what I'll do with
them when it's over," he shrugs. "It
just seems like a good thing to do,
though."
The hearing room was packed on
opening day, and again two weeks ago
when Franklin began his presentation.
But since then about 25 to 30 students
and a few professors show up each day.
Daily reporter Jon Dedmon, who with

a group of five or six other pressmen
has been covering the hearings all along,
thinks that most of the group in the
lecture hall is very pro-Franklin. "Most
of them are Venceremos members or
sympathizers," he says, "along with a
group of very sensitive liberals and a
few conservatives."
Polite Spectators
The spectators have been very polite
throughout with the exception of the
day Franklin took the offense, when
they took over the hearing room for
nearly an hour and conducted a mock
hearing of their own.
One group that is probably very
baffled over the whole business is new
students—freshmen, particularly. "The
first time I'd ever heard of it was when
I got here," says Ray Brizgys, a
freshman from Chicago. "Back east, no
one's ever heard of this thing. I'm fairly

interested, but I don't entirely
understand it all. And I don't think
most freshmen are interested."
A group that is interested and has a
deep stake in the outcome is the
faculty.
"There is very serious concern on
the part of the faculty," claims
Professor Dan Bershader of Aeronautics
and Astronomies and Chairman of the
Faculty Senate. "The reasons should be
obvious. The whole issue of tenure and
proper behavior is involved here. Just
because there is no noise doesn't mean
there is no interest."
And he admits: "The faculty seems
to have been erratic in showing that
they are attentive to this thing. . .The
wash rag is wrung out. No one can be
peaked up all the time."
That might be the answer to the
whole confusing question.
