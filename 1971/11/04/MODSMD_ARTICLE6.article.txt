## Clarification Of My Election Platform 
### 
;alan t. waterman

Inasmuch as my name has been
placed in the running for Red Hot
Defense Contract Professor, I feel
that it is important to clarify my
qualifications (or lack of same)
lest I be accused of running under
false pretenses.
My Army Electronics
Command contract is described
(in the Oct. 28 Chaparral) as
dealing with tropospheric scatter
communications. While I realize
that communications is an
important aspect of man's relating
to his fellow man, to the growth
and spread of human
understanding, and thus to
combatting the fears and
prejudices that lead to wars, it
really is not fair of me (or rather
of my campaign manager,
whoever he or she may be) to
claim this attribute, since my
work does not deal with
communications as such.
My work has the usual
limitations of university research
in that it deals with the basic
aspects of the subject-the
mechanisms by which propagated
radio waves are affected by
turbulence and layers in the
atmosphere. (See Nick Cianos'
Ph.D. Thesis, "Angle and Doppler
Measurements of Microwaves
Propagated Beyond the
Horizon.")
In fact one possible future
application—if you wish to look

ahead to applications, and do not
value improved knowledge in and
for itself —is in the measurement
and monitoring of upper-air
winds. If this were to prove to be
feasible and practical, it would
not only be of general
meteorological value, but it might
help conserve fuel on airplane
flights, thereby reducing the
contaminants spewed into our one
and only atmosphere.
Actually it is not appropriate
to use this contract in the election
campaign, alas. The contract
expired last February. My
sponsoring agency finally yielded
to pressures from higher up in the
military, and was forced to
transfer his support from
long-range university research to
industrial or governmental
projects directly related to the
Viet Nam debacle.
Thus the Pentagon
accomplished what the Young
Crows are seeking to do: driving
open, basic research off campus.
The result is that the work ends
up as applied development (not
research) in laboratories where we
cannot know of it, let alone
control it.
My other campaign material,
the contract with the long title
(practically a dissertation in
itself—l assure you I did not
conjure up the title) dealing with
the interaction of the atmosphere
and millimeter waves, also has

some surprising claims. I was not
aware, for example, that
millimeter waves had any
particular propensity "to
penetrate heavy jungle foliage," as
the Young Crows' publicity states.
Indeed I would have thought
the high moisture content of
jungles would have made
millimeter waves less penetrating
than other portions of the radio
spectrum. But then, I know very
little about propagation through
jungles, and the contract has
nothing to do with propagation
through jungles. So, in all fairness,
you really should not credit me
with this attribute when casting
your ballot.
As in the case of the first
contract, the exciting (at least to
me and my students) development
in this second contract has been
its potential for measuring

atmospheric turbulence and
average wind drift in a confined
region—such as the Bay Area. (See
Jeff Harp's recent Ph.D. thesis, "A
L in e-of-Sight Microwave
Propagation Experiment for
Resolving the Motions and
Turbulent Structure of the
Atmosphere.") It is conceivable
that further developments in this
technique could lead to important
applications in assessing the
meteorological conditions
conducive to pollution worsening,
or lessening.
In fact we have submitted a
proposal to NSF to explore
aspects of that sort. But perhaps
proposals should not be included
in the present campaign. Anyway,
if work were to be funded by
NSF, I suppose DOD might Lake
basic results intended to be
applied to industrial atmospheric

pollution and instead apply them
to another type of atmospheric
pollution—gas warfare. (Do you
suppose we should set up our own
internal classification system for
basic University research and then
refuse to issue clearances to the
military?)
I apologize for the misleading
campaign publicity which
appeared in the Chaparral. I
would gladly withdraw from the
election if my supporters would
let me. Failing that, the best I can
do is correct the misconceptions.
After all, in an academic
institution, even in the heat of an
election, we do all have a firm
dedication to the truth. Don't we?

Inasmuch as my name has been
placed in the running for Red Hot
Defense Contract Professor, I feel
that it is important to clarify my
qualifications (or lack of same)
lest I be accused of running under
false pretenses.
My Army Electronics
Command contract is described
(in the Oct. 28 Chaparral) as
dealing with tropospheric scatter
communications. While I realize
that communications is an
important aspect of man's relating
to his fellow man, to the growth
and spread of human
understanding, and thus to
combatting the fears and
prejudices that lead to wars, it
really is not fair of me (or rather
of my campaign manager,
whoever he or she may be) to
claim this attribute, since my
work does not deal with
communications as such.
My work has the usual
limitations of university research
in that it deals with the basic
aspects of the subject-the
mechanisms by which propagated
radio waves are affected by
turbulence and layers in the
atmosphere. (See Nick Cianos'
Ph.D. Thesis, "Angle and Doppler
Measurements of Microwaves
Propagated Beyond the
Horizon.")
In fact one possible future
application—if you wish to look

ahead to applications, and do not
value improved knowledge in and
for itself —is in the measurement
and monitoring of upper-air
winds. If this were to prove to be
feasible and practical, it would
not only be of general
meteorological value, but it might
help conserve fuel on airplane
flights, thereby reducing the
contaminants spewed into our one
and only atmosphere.
Actually it is not appropriate
to use this contract in the election
campaign, alas. The contract
expired last February. My
sponsoring agency finally yielded
to pressures from higher up in the
military, and was forced to
transfer his support from
long-range university research to
industrial or governmental
projects directly related to the
Viet Nam debacle.
Thus the Pentagon
accomplished what the Young
Crows are seeking to do: driving
open, basic research off campus.
The result is that the work ends
up as applied development (not
research) in laboratories where we
cannot know of it, let alone
control it.
My other campaign material,
the contract with the long title
(practically a dissertation in
itself—l assure you I did not
conjure up the title) dealing with
the interaction of the atmosphere
and millimeter waves, also has

some surprising claims. I was not
aware, for example, that
millimeter waves had any
particular propensity "to
penetrate heavy jungle foliage," as
the Young Crows' publicity states.
Indeed I would have thought
the high moisture content of
jungles would have made
millimeter waves less penetrating
than other portions of the radio
spectrum. But then, I know very
little about propagation through
jungles, and the contract has
nothing to do with propagation
through jungles. So, in all fairness,
you really should not credit me
with this attribute when casting
your ballot.
As in the case of the first
contract, the exciting (at least to
me and my students) development
in this second contract has been
its potential for measuring

atmospheric turbulence and
average wind drift in a confined
region—such as the Bay Area. (See
Jeff Harp's recent Ph.D. thesis, "A
L in e-of-Sight Microwave
Propagation Experiment for
Resolving the Motions and
Turbulent Structure of the
Atmosphere.") It is conceivable
that further developments in this
technique could lead to important
applications in assessing the
meteorological conditions
conducive to pollution worsening,
or lessening.
In fact we have submitted a
proposal to NSF to explore
aspects of that sort. But perhaps
proposals should not be included
in the present campaign. Anyway,
if work were to be funded by
NSF, I suppose DOD might Lake
basic results intended to be
applied to industrial atmospheric

pollution and instead apply them
to another type of atmospheric
pollution—gas warfare. (Do you
suppose we should set up our own
internal classification system for
basic University research and then
refuse to issue clearances to the
military?)
I apologize for the misleading
campaign publicity which
appeared in the Chaparral. I
would gladly withdraw from the
election if my supporters would
let me. Failing that, the best I can
do is correct the misconceptions.
After all, in an academic
institution, even in the heat of an

dedication to the truth. Don't we?
