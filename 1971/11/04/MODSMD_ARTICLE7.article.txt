Black Racism
Editor, THE DAILY:
Everyone should examine the
statements of the Stanford BSU
and Black Family in the Daily
(Monday, November 1) with an
eye to ascertaining the truth of
statements therein.
The charge that the white
student body "displayed
collective racism by voting down
the minority affairs referendum"
is not only unsupported, but
patently nonsensical.
While rejecting support for a
child care center can in no way be
deemed racism, a number of the
stated positions of the BSU and
Black Family can. What could be
more expressive of the attitude of
black racism which pervades these
organizations than the statement
"it is time to go behind closed
doors and talk shop and emerge
with a united front."
Rather than delude themselves

with paranoid and generally
unfounded assertions of "white
racism," members of these
organizations should concern
themselves with fighting
ever-increasing black racismâ€”such
as that recently manifested in the
so-called "machete attacks" of
whites in Berkeley by black
assailants.
Let's tell it like it is.
Jack Williams
Law And Order
Editor, THE DAILY:
Last spring the student body
voted to prohibit military
recruiting, and to prohibit the use
of Stanford lands by corporations
producing material and research
for the military. While the second
decision requires defining action
by a committee before it can be
unambiguously implemented, the
decision "To prohibit the use of
Stanford lands for military service
recruiting." is clear and
unequivocal. We call on all
members of the Stanford
community who believe in law
and order to respect this lule and
support its enforcement.
