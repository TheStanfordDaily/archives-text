# The 						UN With China – A New Era

Last week's restoration to the
People's Republic of China (PRC)
their legitimate right to represent
the Chinese people in the United
Nations ends what is surely one of
the most absurd chapters in
contemporary international
politics and, at the same time,
signals what could be the start of
a new era of effectiveness for the
world organization.
For twenty-two years the
United States used the issue of
representation in the U.N. as one
of the main props of perpetuating
the myth that the Chiang Kai-shek
regime on Taiwan was the "true"
government of the whole of
China. In 1950, soon after the
liberation of China, it appeared as
if the U.S. was going to accept the
political realities of Mao's victory
and both recognize the new
People's government in Peking
and support (at least tacitly) the
PRC's claim to the Chinese seat in
the U.N.
At that time, it seemed that
the question of Chinese
representation would be resolved
by the common-sense formula of
"effective control" according to
which a government's claim of
legitimacy was judged only by the
criteria of control over populace
and territory and a reasonable
prospect of permanence.
But with the outbreak of the
Korean War and the rising tide of
the "who lost China" complex in
America(culminating in the
McCarthy witch-hunts), the U.S.
chose to sponsor the
entrenchment on Taiwan of the
fleeing Nationalist forces. The
U.S. immediately began to use the
U.N. as an instrument of
opposition to the Communist
government in Peking. The
question of Chinese
representation in the U.N. thus
became embroiled in the political
battles of the early 50's, and the
effectiveness of the U.N. was
severely impaired by the
subordination of that
organization's authority to the
pressure of Big Power politics.
As America's interests in Asia

began to expand, the U.S.
successfully introduced a mass of
ideological subterfuge into its
rationalizations as to why the
PRC should not be seated as the
representative of China in the
U.N. The PRC was accused of
being an habitual aggressor (e.g.
Korea, Tibet) which had no
respect for international law and
which could not be expected to
uphold the principles of the U.N.
Charter; the argument was also
raised that Mao had gained power
illegally by violent means and was,
therefore, not entitled to
recognition as the legitimate
government of China.
The real danger in the U.S.
strategy to exclude the PRC from
the U.N. on ideological and
political grounds lay not in the
fact that the strategy was based
on lies and distortions, but that,
in establishing the precedent that
the UN had the power to decide
which government was to
represent a member-state by any
criteria other than the most
fundamental—i.e. the criteria of
effective control—the UN stood in
blatant violation of one of the
principles that it was established
to protect: national sovereignty
and the correlative right of
self-determination.
For years it had been apparent
that the trend of voting in the UN
was moving against the US
position of maintaining the China
seat for Chiang Kai-shek. The
reason for this was primarily the
changing composition of the UN
membership.
As more third-world nations
gained their liberation and took
their places in the councils of
nations, the UN ceased to be a
place that consistently bent to the
will of the Big Powers. The
outcome of the UN vote in favor
of Peking no doubt was hastened
in its realization by the recent
shifts in Washington's policy
toward China, but the fact
remains clear that, given time, the
outcome was inevitable regardless

of the wishes of the US.
Nixon's new China policy,
both on a bilateral level and in the
multilateral context of the UN,
must be seen partly as a
recognition of the changing
balance of power in international
politics.
Even in the face of defeat the
US again chose a strategy which,
for the sake of politics and public
relations, gravely escalated the
stakes involved in the Chinese
representation issue by treating it

as a matter involving the
expulsion of a member-state. But
China was not expelled as a result
of the UN vote; only its
representatives changed.
Change in representation is a
normal process among the
members of the UN whether it is a
reflection of changes within the
same political system (e.g. the
shift from a Democratic to a
Republican administration in the
US) or a change of political
systems within a single nation
(e.g. Greece or Cuba in recent
years).
The complicating factor in the
Chinese case was the simultaneous
existence of two claimant
governments, a situation made
viable only by the intervention of
the US on behalf of the
discredited nationalist regime. But
that factor does not change the
basic truth that the issue involved
in the UN debate was only that of
a change in representation of a
member-state, and if the public
has become unduly alarmed at the
replacement of Taipei by Peking,
then the US government must

bear the responsibility for raising
the false issue of expulsion.
At a more extreme level of
argument, it has been said that
not only was a member of the UN
expelled, but an original signatory
of the UN Charter, in this case the
Republic of China (ROC), at that!
It is absurd to contend that the
name of a government transcends
the will of the people. When the
ROC signed the Charter in 1945,
it did so in behalf of the Chinese
people who, through the course of

the Chinese revolution, revoked
the mandate of authority from
that government.
The truth is that the Chinese
poeple, as an original signatory of
the Charter, were, for twenty-two
years, deprived of their legitimate
rights to representation in the UN.
Some observers have stated
that, while they applaud the
seating of Peking, it is a shame
that the people on Taiwan are
now without representation in the
UN. This viewpoint is
misperceived from two aspects. In
the first place, both Peking and
Taipei rejected any type of
"two-China" formula for the UN.
Therefore, any wishful thinking
on the part of the Americans that
both the PRC and ROC might
have stayed in the UN flies in the
face of what the Chinese
themselves found acceptable and
smacks of condescending
paternalism.
Secondly, even if the ROC
were to have remained in the UN,
such representation could not be
taken as expressive of the will of
the Taiwanese people. The rule of
the Chiang government is
dictatorially imposed on the
Taiwanese who regard the
Nationalist mainlanders as
interlopers.
The outcome of the UN vote is
an extremely important step in
unmasking the fraudulent claims
of legitimacy of the Chiang
regime, not only vis-a-vis the
whole of China, but especially
with regard to the internal
situation on Taiwan. As
international recognition and
prestige of the ROC government

recedes, those forces which truly
express the aspirations of the
Taiwanese people gain
momentum. While, at this
historical stage, the people of
Taiwan are still deprived of direct
representation in the UN, they
have won significant ground in
their struggle for self-determina
tion.
Though the Chinese object to
much about the UN, particularly
to what they consider a
fundamental Western bias in its
organization, and are very
skeptical about its ability to
overcome the domination by US
influence (e.g. the UN's total
impotence in regard to
Indochina), Peking still regards its
entry into the UN as an important
part of assuming its rightful place
in world leadership and the fact
that their entry comes without
compromising the one
precondition they held for their
participation—that the PRC be
seated as the sole legitimate
representative of China—makes
the victory all the more
meaningful to them.
How the Chinese will act in the
UN remains to be seen. But it is
certain that they will energetically
pursue their goals with the
thought of reducing some of
biases they perceive in the UN and
with the aspiration of remaking
the organization according to a
more just model. Such actions,
when they are in conflict with US
interests, are certain to be labelled
as obstructionism. But we must
understand that the PRC brings to
the UN a world view that is not
easily comprehensible to most
Americans because it is both
Chinese and revolutionary, and,
therefore doubly removed from
our heritage and experience.
A discussion of the China vote
in the UN cannot be complete
without a comment on the
reactions of Mr. Nixon and other
prominent American politicians.
The President's expression of
shock towards the outward signs
of joy over Peking's victory,
especially the "dancing" of the
Tanzanian delegation which
Nixon called "a shocking
spectacle" and "action. . .not
worthy of an international
forum" (S.F. Chronicle,
10-28-71), is reminiscent of the
same ethnocentric
n arrowmindedness which
characterized the moral outrage of
Western missionaries at the
"barbaric" sexual practices of the
African natives, i.e. any
improvisation on the divinely
sanctioned missionary position.
Senator Goldwater's comments
about the fact that the US was
stabbed in the back by nations
which it has "kept" since World
War II coupled with the threats
from various quarters about cuts
in US foreign aid and contribution
to the UN, reflect all too clearly
the bully-on-the-block attitude
and the strong-arm tactics which
have pervaded American thinking
about foreign policy.
Whatever the case, the entrance
of Peking into the UN should be
welcomed not only by those who
consider themselves friends of the
New China, but by all who hold
the hope—however faint—that
world peace is attainable.
