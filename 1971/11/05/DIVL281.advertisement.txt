President Nixon's Vietnamization program is a calculated maneuver designed to buy off
domestic discontent by lowering the number of American battle deaths while continuing to
use American planes and technology to maintain repressive, unpopular regimes in Indochina.
Tomorrow's anti-war march in San Francisco and 16 other American cities will challenge the
morality and the humanity of Nixon's policies and will demand an end to American
participation in the war, either through unilateral withdrawal or negotiated settlement. It is
essential that everybody who opposes Nixon's policies participate in the marches; Otherwise
Nixon will be able to convince an increasingly hostile Congress that the American people
support the Vietnamization program and the death and destruction will go on.
