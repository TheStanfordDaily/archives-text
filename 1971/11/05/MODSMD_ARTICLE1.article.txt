# Placement Center Mill-In Forces Honeywell Out
## 
### LANG ATWOOD DAVID THIEMANN 
A crowd of 150 demonstrators
occupied the Placement Center for one
and a half hours yesterday, leaving only
when Sergeant Eton Tamm of the Santa
Clara County Sheriff's Office informed
the protesters that, if they remained,
they would be removed and arrested.
Protesters, declaring their intention
to prevent Honeywell Inc.
representatives from conducting their
afternoon interviews, entered the
building after a noon rally which
attracted 350 people.
Two Honeywell recruiters, T.H.
Ekstrom and Terry Scanlon, were
confronted by about 4 0 demonstrators
in a hall alongside the interview rooms

at about 1:50 p.m., as they returned
from lunch.
No Comment
They left almost immediately, and
walked quickly to their car while a
group of demonstrators and newsmen
followed and attempted to question
them. Both refused comment on all
queries, saying only that they had a
4:30 p.m. plane to catch.
The two drove away, watched
carefully by a Stanford patrolman and
officers in a Sheriff's patrol car.
When the demonstrators first
entered the placement building, about
40 went into the hall on which all
interview rooms open, and stretched a
large flag across its width to conceal
their activities from police observers
and photographers.
Demonstrators, crowded into the
narrow corridor along with news
photographers, reporters, and
cameramen, also confronted TRW
Systems Group recruiters who had
interviews scheduled for the afternoon.
Three TRW representatives, Dr.
William McGivers, Charles Christiansen,
and Roger Burnell, discussed their
company's policies with demonstrators
for about an hour, but Burnell also
attempted to begin an interview with a
student, Duane Linsenbardt.
Discussion
One TRW recruiter commented on
the "tremendously emotional approach
here," as groups of 10 to 15 students
crowded into some of the small
recruiting cubicles, berating company
representatives and condemning their
involvement in defense production and
research, while photographers and
newsmen crowded at the doorway.
Several of the demonstrators began a
quiet, intellectual discussion in one
interview room, but others continued
to shout down arguments from their
opponents, occasionally using a
bullhorn.

At about 2:30 p.m. Placement
Center Director Ralph Keller went into
an interview room where Mr. Burnell,
along with Linsenbardt, an engineering
student, were being questioned by a
group of protesters.
Keller asked both the interviewer
and the student whether they wished to
conduct their interview in private, and
when they requested a private session,
he asked the demonstrators to leave. In
a rather heated exchange, Keller and
several of the demonstrators argued
over the rights of the protesting
students and of the job applicant.
The Placement Director then
informed the students that he believed
they were in violation of the University
disruption policy, but did not declare
the gathering a disruption at that time.
He then retired to his office, with
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Merington
and Sergeant Tamm, to consult by
telephone with John Schwartz, an
assistant to President Lyman.
New Room
Schwartz apparently advised the trio
to ask the recruiter and student to
move to a cubicle across the corridor
and to invoke the disruption policy if
protesters interrupted the interview
again in the new room.
At about 2:45 p.m., after the flag
blocking the corridor had been pulled
down, Keller moved the interview
participants. The demonstrators
followed them into the room while
police photographers took pictures, and
the protesters refused to leave.
Keller then declared the incident a
disruption, informed the students that
they were in violation of the University
policy, and asked Chief Herrington to
control the situation.
Borrowing the radicals' bullhorn,
Herrington ordered the demonstrators
to leave at 2:50 p.m., and told them
that unless they did, he would ask the

THREAT OF ARREST—Sheriff's deputy Don Tamm informed demonstrators at the Placement Center yesterday that, if they
chose not to leave, they would be arrested and removed. Tamm pinned his badge conspicuously on his lapel, borrowed the
demonstrators' bullhorn, and made the announcement at Stanford Police Chief Marvin Herrington's request.
