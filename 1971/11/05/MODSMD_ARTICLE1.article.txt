# Placement Center Mill-In Forces Honeywell Out
## 
### LANG ATWOOD DAVID THIEMANN 
A crowd of 150 demonstrators
occupied the Placement Center for one
and a half hours yesterday, leaving only
when Sergeant Eton Tamm of the Santa
Clara County Sheriff's Office informed
the protesters that, if they remained,
they would be removed and arrested.
Protesters, declaring their intention
to prevent Honeywell Inc.
representatives from conducting their
afternoon interviews, entered the
building after a noon rally which
attracted 350 people.
Two Honeywell recruiters, T.H.
Ekstrom and Terry Scanlon, were
confronted by about 4 0 demonstrators
in a hall alongside the interview rooms

at about 1:50 p.m., as they returned
from lunch.
No Comment
They left almost immediately, and
walked quickly to their car while a
group of demonstrators and newsmen
followed and attempted to question
them. Both refused comment on all
queries, saying only that they had a
4:30 p.m. plane to catch.
The two drove away, watched
carefully by a Stanford patrolman and
officers in a Sheriff's patrol car.
When the demonstrators first
entered the placement building, about
40 went into the hall on which all
interview rooms open, and stretched a
large flag across its width to conceal
their activities from police observers
and photographers.
Demonstrators, crowded into the
narrow corridor along with news
photographers, reporters, and
cameramen, also confronted TRW
Systems Group recruiters who had
interviews scheduled for the afternoon.
Three TRW representatives, Dr.
William McGivers, Charles Christiansen,
and Roger Burnell, discussed their
company's policies with demonstrators
for about an hour, but Burnell also
attempted to begin an interview with a
student, Duane Linsenbardt.
Discussion
One TRW recruiter commented on
the "tremendously emotional approach
here," as groups of 10 to 15 students
crowded into some of the small
recruiting cubicles, berating company
representatives and condemning their
involvement in defense production and
research, while photographers and
newsmen crowded at the doorway.
Several of the demonstrators began a
quiet, intellectual discussion in one
interview room, but others continued
to shout down arguments from their
opponents, occasionally using a
bullhorn.

At about 2:30 p.m. Placement
Center Director Ralph Keller went into
an interview room where Mr. Burnell,
along with Linsenbardt, an engineering
student, were being questioned by a
group of protesters.
Keller asked both the interviewer
and the student whether they wished to
conduct their interview in private, and
when they requested a private session,
he asked the demonstrators to leave. In
a rather heated exchange, Keller and
several of the demonstrators argued
over the rights of the protesting
students and of the job applicant.
The Placement Director then
informed the students that he believed
they were in violation of the University
disruption policy, but did not declare
the gathering a disruption at that time.
He then retired to his office, with
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Merington
and Sergeant Tamm, to consult by
telephone with John Schwartz, an
assistant to President Lyman.
New Room
Schwartz apparently advised the trio
to ask the recruiter and student to
move to a cubicle across the corridor
and to invoke the disruption policy if
protesters interrupted the interview
again in the new room.
At about 2:45 p.m., after the flag
blocking the corridor had been pulled
down, Keller moved the interview
participants. The demonstrators
followed them into the room while
police photographers took pictures, and
the protesters refused to leave.
Keller then declared the incident a
disruption, informed the students that
they were in violation of the University
policy, and asked Chief Herrington to
control the situation.
Borrowing the radicals' bullhorn,
Herrington ordered the demonstrators
to leave at 2:50 p.m., and told them
that unless they did, he would ask the

THREAT OF ARREST—Sheriff's deputy Don Tamm informed demonstrators at the Placement Center yesterday that, if they
chose not to leave, they would be arrested and removed. Tamm pinned his badge conspicuously on his lapel, borrowed the
demonstrators' bullhorn, and made the announcement at Stanford Police Chief Marvin Herrington's request.
Sheriff's officers present to remove and
arrest them.
During the ten minute period
allowed by Herrington for discussion
among the demonstrators, they choose
to remain in the building until
threatened with police removal and/or
arrest.
Misdemeanor
At 3:00 p.m., Tamm, using the same
bullhorn, informed the 30 people in the
corridor that, in his opinion, they were
violating section 602 of the California
Penal Code, which provides
misdemeanor penalties for anyone who
disrupts lawful business. He informed
the protesters present that they would
be arrested if they remained in the
building.
After this announcement, the group
filed slowly out the back door of the
building without any action by
Sheriff's deputies.
After leaving the building, they
listened to several speakers using a
bullhorn, who promised to return to
the placement building tomorrow and
then dispersed.

Keller, Schwartz, and Lyman all said
after the disruption that if the Stanford
Judicial Council is convened and
evidence from photographs and
witnesses warrants prosecution, charges
will be brought against students
involved in the disturbance.
The incident was photographed by
several police and news service
photographers, and observed by
plainclothes police officers,
administrators, and Craig Brown of the
Santa Clara County District Attorney's
office. There were at least eight
helmeted deputies in the area as well.
Lyman's Regret
In a telephone interview after the
disruption ended, Lyman said that "I
regret that the Honeywell people left
before any interviews began," and
noted that no University
representatives, either from the
administration or the placement center,
spoke with the Honeywell recruiters
before they were confronted in the
hallway, or after they decided to leave.
The president defended his refusal
to address rallies in front of the
placement building, commenting that

"I don't think the atmosphere in those
rallies is designed to achieve a
reasonable and fair exchange of views."
At the rally yesterday before
demonstrators entered the Placement
Center, several speakers described
Honeywell's role as a war industry, and
advanced reasons to bar its recruiters
from the Stanford campus.
Richard Falk, a Princeton University
professor of international law, and
well-known anti-war activist, spoke to
the crowd for about 10 minutes.
Twisted Society
He claimed that casualties in
Vietnam are as high now as any time
during the war, though American losses
have boen sharply reduced.
Falk described the role of
corporations like Honeywell in
American society, noting that "our
twisted society rewards government
war planners with good jobs in these
corporations. They are America's elite.
"Today, symbolically, we can make
some corporations aware of their
responsibility. We must see that power
is used in a less illegal, less criminal, and
less inhumane way."
"It is in that context that I wish you
success with your demonstration
today," Falk concluded.
The demonstrators have planned
another rally, to take place at 12:30
p.m. today in front of the Placement
Center. Defense-oriented industries
recruiting today include: Texas
Instruments, 32 nd largest military
contractor in 1970, with $190 million
from the Department of Defense;
Asiatic Petroleum, 4 6 th largest in 1970 ,
with $126 million; and TRW Systems
Group, 34 th largest, with $184 million.

One TRW recruiter commented on
the "tremendously emotional approach
here," as groups of 10 to 15 students
crowded into some of the small
recruiting cubicles, berating company
representatives and condemning their
involvement in defense production and
research, while photographers and
newsmen crowded at the doorway.
Several of the demonstrators began a
quiet, intellectual discussion in one
interview room, but others continued
to shout down arguments from their
opponents, occasionally using a
bullhorn.

At about 2:30 p.m. Placement
Center Director Ralph Keller went into
an interview room where Mr. Burnell,
along with Linsenbardt, an engineering
student, were being questioned by a
group of protesters.
Keller asked both the interviewer
and the student whether they wished to
conduct their interview in private, and
when they requested a private session,
he asked the demonstrators to leave. In
a rather heated exchange, Keller and
several of the demonstrators argued
over the rights of the protesting
students and of the job applicant.
The Placement Director then
informed the students that he believed
they were in violation of the University
disruption policy, but did not declare
the gathering a disruption at that time.
He then retired to his office, with
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Merington
and Sergeant Tamm, to consult by
telephone with John Schwartz, an
assistant to President Lyman.
New Room
Schwartz apparently advised the trio
to ask the recruiter and student to
move to a cubicle across the corridor
and to invoke the disruption policy if
protesters interrupted the interview
again in the new room.
At about 2:45 p.m., after the flag
blocking the corridor had been pulled
down, Keller moved the interview
participants. The demonstrators
followed them into the room while
police photographers took pictures, and
the protesters refused to leave.
Keller then declared the incident a
disruption, informed the students that
they were in violation of the University
policy, and asked Chief Herrington to
control the situation.
Borrowing the radicals' bullhorn,
Herrington ordered the demonstrators
to leave at 2:50 p.m., and told them
that unless they did, he would ask the

THREAT OF ARREST—Sheriff's deputy Don Tamm informed demonstrators at the Placement Center yesterday that, if they
chose not to leave, they would be arrested and removed. Tamm pinned his badge conspicuously on his lapel, borrowed the
demonstrators' bullhorn, and made the announcement at Stanford Police Chief Marvin Herrington's request.
Sheriff's officers present to remove and
arrest them.
During the ten minute period
allowed by Herrington for discussion
among the demonstrators, they choose
to remain in the building until
threatened with police removal and/or
arrest.
Misdemeanor
At 3:00 p.m., Tamm, using the same
bullhorn, informed the 30 people in the
corridor that, in his opinion, they were
violating section 602 of the California
Penal Code, which provides
misdemeanor penalties for anyone who
disrupts lawful business. He informed
the protesters present that they would
be arrested if they remained in the
building.
After this announcement, the group
filed slowly out the back door of the
building without any action by
Sheriff's deputies.
After leaving the building, they
listened to several speakers using a
bullhorn, who promised to return to
the placement building tomorrow and
then dispersed.

Keller, Schwartz, and Lyman all said
after the disruption that if the Stanford
Judicial Council is convened and
evidence from photographs and
witnesses warrants prosecution, charges
will be brought against students
involved in the disturbance.
The incident was photographed by
several police and news service
photographers, and observed by
plainclothes police officers,
administrators, and Craig Brown of the
Santa Clara County District Attorney's
office. There were at least eight
helmeted deputies in the area as well.
Lyman's Regret
In a telephone interview after the
disruption ended, Lyman said that "I
regret that the Honeywell people left
before any interviews began," and
noted that no University
representatives, either from the
administration or the placement center,
spoke with the Honeywell recruiters
before they were confronted in the
hallway, or after they decided to leave.
The president defended his refusal
to address rallies in front of the
placement building, commenting that

"I don't think the atmosphere in those
rallies is designed to achieve a
reasonable and fair exchange of views."
At the rally yesterday before
demonstrators entered the Placement
Center, several speakers described
Honeywell's role as a war industry, and
advanced reasons to bar its recruiters
from the Stanford campus.
Richard Falk, a Princeton University
professor of international law, and
well-known anti-war activist, spoke to
the crowd for about 10 minutes.
Twisted Society
He claimed that casualties in
Vietnam are as high now as any time
during the war, though American losses
have boen sharply reduced.
Falk described the role of
corporations like Honeywell in
American society, noting that "our
twisted society rewards government
war planners with good jobs in these
corporations. They are America's elite.
"Today, symbolically, we can make
some corporations aware of their
responsibility. We must see that power
is used in a less illegal, less criminal, and
less inhumane way."
"It is in that context that I wish you
success with your demonstration
today," Falk concluded.
The demonstrators have planned
another rally, to take place at 12:30
p.m. today in front of the Placement
Center. Defense-oriented industries
recruiting today include: Texas
Instruments, 32 nd largest military
contractor in 1970, with $190 million
from the Department of Defense;
Asiatic Petroleum, 4 6 th largest in 1970 ,
with $126 million; and TRW Systems
Group, 34 th largest, with $184 million.
A crowd of 150 demonstrators
occupied the Placement Center for one
and a half hours yesterday, leaving only
when Sergeant Eton Tamm of the Santa
Clara County Sheriff's Office informed
the protesters that, if they remained,
they would be removed and arrested.
Protesters, declaring their intention
to prevent Honeywell Inc.
representatives from conducting their
afternoon interviews, entered the
building after a noon rally which
attracted 350 people.
Two Honeywell recruiters, T.H.
Ekstrom and Terry Scanlon, were
confronted by about 4 0 demonstrators
in a hall alongside the interview rooms

at about 1:50 p.m., as they returned
from lunch.
No Comment
They left almost immediately, and
walked quickly to their car while a
group of demonstrators and newsmen
followed and attempted to question
them. Both refused comment on all
queries, saying only that they had a
4:30 p.m. plane to catch.
The two drove away, watched
carefully by a Stanford patrolman and
officers in a Sheriff's patrol car.
When the demonstrators first
entered the placement building, about
40 went into the hall on which all
interview rooms open, and stretched a
large flag across its width to conceal
their activities from police observers
and photographers.
Demonstrators, crowded into the
narrow corridor along with news
photographers, reporters, and
cameramen, also confronted TRW
Systems Group recruiters who had
interviews scheduled for the afternoon.
Three TRW representatives, Dr.
William McGivers, Charles Christiansen,
and Roger Burnell, discussed their
company's policies with demonstrators
for about an hour, but Burnell also
attempted to begin an interview with a
student, Duane Linsenbardt.

the protesters refused to leave.
Keller then declared the incident a
disruption, informed the students that
they were in violation of the University
policy, and asked Chief Herrington to
control the situation.
Borrowing the radicals' bullhorn,
Herrington ordered the demonstrators
to leave at 2:50 p.m., and told them
that unless they did, he would ask the

THREAT OF ARREST—Sheriff's deputy Don Tamm informed demonstrators at the Placement Center yesterday that, if they
chose not to leave, they would be arrested and removed. Tamm pinned his badge conspicuously on his lapel, borrowed the
demonstrators' bullhorn, and made the announcement at Stanford Police Chief Marvin Herrington's request.
Sheriff's officers present to remove and
arrest them.
During the ten minute period
allowed by Herrington for discussion
among the demonstrators, they choose
to remain in the building until
threatened with police removal and/or
arrest.
Misdemeanor
At 3:00 p.m., Tamm, using the same
bullhorn, informed the 30 people in the
corridor that, in his opinion, they were
violating section 602 of the California
Penal Code, which provides
misdemeanor penalties for anyone who
disrupts lawful business. He informed
the protesters present that they would
be arrested if they remained in the
building.
After this announcement, the group
filed slowly out the back door of the
building without any action by
Sheriff's deputies.
After leaving the building, they
listened to several speakers using a
bullhorn, who promised to return to
the placement building tomorrow and
then dispersed.

Keller, Schwartz, and Lyman all said
after the disruption that if the Stanford
Judicial Council is convened and
evidence from photographs and
witnesses warrants prosecution, charges
will be brought against students
involved in the disturbance.
The incident was photographed by
several police and news service
photographers, and observed by
plainclothes police officers,
administrators, and Craig Brown of the
Santa Clara County District Attorney's
office. There were at least eight
helmeted deputies in the area as well.
Lyman's Regret
In a telephone interview after the
disruption ended, Lyman said that "I
regret that the Honeywell people left
before any interviews began," and
noted that no University
representatives, either from the
administration or the placement center,
spoke with the Honeywell recruiters
before they were confronted in the
hallway, or after they decided to leave.
The president defended his refusal
to address rallies in front of the
placement building, commenting that

"I don't think the atmosphere in those
rallies is designed to achieve a
reasonable and fair exchange of views."
At the rally yesterday before
demonstrators entered the Placement
Center, several speakers described
Honeywell's role as a war industry, and
advanced reasons to bar its recruiters
from the Stanford campus.
Richard Falk, a Princeton University
professor of international law, and
well-known anti-war activist, spoke to
the crowd for about 10 minutes.
Twisted Society
He claimed that casualties in
Vietnam are as high now as any time
during the war, though American losses
have boen sharply reduced.
Falk described the role of
corporations like Honeywell in
American society, noting that "our
twisted society rewards government
war planners with good jobs in these
corporations. They are America's elite.
"Today, symbolically, we can make
some corporations aware of their
responsibility. We must see that power
is used in a less illegal, less criminal, and
less inhumane way."
"It is in that context that I wish you
success with your demonstration
today," Falk concluded.
The demonstrators have planned
another rally, to take place at 12:30
p.m. today in front of the Placement
Center. Defense-oriented industries
recruiting today include: Texas
Instruments, 32 nd largest military
contractor in 1970, with $190 million
from the Department of Defense;
Asiatic Petroleum, 4 6 th largest in 1970 ,
with $126 million; and TRW Systems
Group, 34 th largest, with $184 million.
A crowd of 150 demonstrators
occupied the Placement Center for one
and a half hours yesterday, leaving only
when Sergeant Eton Tamm of the Santa
Clara County Sheriff's Office informed
the protesters that, if they remained,
they would be removed and arrested.
Protesters, declaring their intention
to prevent Honeywell Inc.
representatives from conducting their
afternoon interviews, entered the
building after a noon rally which
attracted 350 people.
Two Honeywell recruiters, T.H.
Ekstrom and Terry Scanlon, were
confronted by about 4 0 demonstrators
in a hall alongside the interview rooms

at about 1:50 p.m., as they returned
from lunch.
No Comment
They left almost immediately, and
walked quickly to their car while a
group of demonstrators and newsmen
followed and attempted to question
them. Both refused comment on all
queries, saying only that they had a
4:30 p.m. plane to catch.
The two drove away, watched
carefully by a Stanford patrolman and
officers in a Sheriff's patrol car.
When the demonstrators first
entered the placement building, about
40 went into the hall on which all
interview rooms open, and stretched a
large flag across its width to conceal
their activities from police observers
and photographers.
Demonstrators, crowded into the
narrow corridor along with news
photographers, reporters, and
cameramen, also confronted TRW
Systems Group recruiters who had
interviews scheduled for the afternoon.
Three TRW representatives, Dr.
William McGivers, Charles Christiansen,
and Roger Burnell, discussed their
company's policies with demonstrators
for about an hour, but Burnell also
attempted to begin an interview with a
student, Duane Linsenbardt.
Discussion
One TRW recruiter commented on
the "tremendously emotional approach
here," as groups of 10 to 15 students
crowded into some of the small
recruiting cubicles, berating company
representatives and condemning their
involvement in defense production and
research, while photographers and
newsmen crowded at the doorway.
Several of the demonstrators began a
quiet, intellectual discussion in one
interview room, but others continued
to shout down arguments from their
opponents, occasionally using a
bullhorn.

At about 2:30 p.m. Placement
Center Director Ralph Keller went into
an interview room where Mr. Burnell,
along with Linsenbardt, an engineering
student, were being questioned by a
group of protesters.
Keller asked both the interviewer
and the student whether they wished to
conduct their interview in private, and
when they requested a private session,
he asked the demonstrators to leave. In
a rather heated exchange, Keller and
several of the demonstrators argued
over the rights of the protesting
students and of the job applicant.
The Placement Director then
informed the students that he believed
they were in violation of the University
disruption policy, but did not declare
the gathering a disruption at that time.
He then retired to his office, with
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Merington
and Sergeant Tamm, to consult by
telephone with John Schwartz, an
assistant to President Lyman.
New Room
Schwartz apparently advised the trio
to ask the recruiter and student to
move to a cubicle across the corridor
and to invoke the disruption policy if
protesters interrupted the interview
again in the new room.
At about 2:45 p.m., after the flag
blocking the corridor had been pulled
down, Keller moved the interview
participants. The demonstrators
followed them into the room while
police photographers took pictures, and
the protesters refused to leave.
Keller then declared the incident a
disruption, informed the students that
they were in violation of the University
policy, and asked Chief Herrington to
control the situation.

will be brought against students
involved in the disturbance.
The incident was photographed by
several police and news service
photographers, and observed by
plainclothes police officers,
administrators, and Craig Brown of the
Santa Clara County District Attorney's
office. There were at least eight
helmeted deputies in the area as well.
Lyman's Regret
In a telephone interview after the
disruption ended, Lyman said that "I
regret that the Honeywell people left
before any interviews began," and
noted that no University
representatives, either from the
administration or the placement center,
spoke with the Honeywell recruiters
before they were confronted in the
hallway, or after they decided to leave.
The president defended his refusal
to address rallies in front of the
placement building, commenting that

"I don't think the atmosphere in those
rallies is designed to achieve a
reasonable and fair exchange of views."
At the rally yesterday before
demonstrators entered the Placement
Center, several speakers described
Honeywell's role as a war industry, and
advanced reasons to bar its recruiters
from the Stanford campus.
Richard Falk, a Princeton University
professor of international law, and
well-known anti-war activist, spoke to
the crowd for about 10 minutes.
Twisted Society
He claimed that casualties in
Vietnam are as high now as any time
during the war, though American losses
have boen sharply reduced.
Falk described the role of
corporations like Honeywell in
American society, noting that "our
twisted society rewards government
war planners with good jobs in these
corporations. They are America's elite.
"Today, symbolically, we can make
some corporations aware of their
responsibility. We must see that power
is used in a less illegal, less criminal, and
less inhumane way."
"It is in that context that I wish you
success with your demonstration
today," Falk concluded.
The demonstrators have planned
another rally, to take place at 12:30
p.m. today in front of the Placement
Center. Defense-oriented industries
recruiting today include: Texas
Instruments, 32 nd largest military
contractor in 1970, with $190 million
from the Department of Defense;
Asiatic Petroleum, 4 6 th largest in 1970 ,
with $126 million; and TRW Systems
Group, 34 th largest, with $184 million.
A crowd of 150 demonstrators
occupied the Placement Center for one
and a half hours yesterday, leaving only
when Sergeant Eton Tamm of the Santa
Clara County Sheriff's Office informed
the protesters that, if they remained,
they would be removed and arrested.
Protesters, declaring their intention
to prevent Honeywell Inc.
representatives from conducting their
afternoon interviews, entered the
building after a noon rally which
attracted 350 people.
Two Honeywell recruiters, T.H.
Ekstrom and Terry Scanlon, were
confronted by about 4 0 demonstrators
in a hall alongside the interview rooms

at about 1:50 p.m., as they returned
from lunch.
No Comment
They left almost immediately, and
walked quickly to their car while a
group of demonstrators and newsmen
followed and attempted to question
them. Both refused comment on all
queries, saying only that they had a
4:30 p.m. plane to catch.
The two drove away, watched
carefully by a Stanford patrolman and
officers in a Sheriff's patrol car.
When the demonstrators first
entered the placement building, about
40 went into the hall on which all
interview rooms open, and stretched a
large flag across its width to conceal
their activities from police observers
and photographers.
Demonstrators, crowded into the
narrow corridor along with news
photographers, reporters, and
cameramen, also confronted TRW
Systems Group recruiters who had
interviews scheduled for the afternoon.
Three TRW representatives, Dr.
William McGivers, Charles Christiansen,
and Roger Burnell, discussed their
company's policies with demonstrators
for about an hour, but Burnell also
attempted to begin an interview with a
student, Duane Linsenbardt.
Discussion
One TRW recruiter commented on
the "tremendously emotional approach
here," as groups of 10 to 15 students
crowded into some of the small
recruiting cubicles, berating company
representatives and condemning their
involvement in defense production and
research, while photographers and
newsmen crowded at the doorway.
Several of the demonstrators began a
quiet, intellectual discussion in one
interview room, but others continued
to shout down arguments from their
opponents, occasionally using a
bullhorn.

At about 2:30 p.m. Placement
Center Director Ralph Keller went into
an interview room where Mr. Burnell,
along with Linsenbardt, an engineering
student, were being questioned by a
group of protesters.
Keller asked both the interviewer
and the student whether they wished to
conduct their interview in private, and
when they requested a private session,
he asked the demonstrators to leave. In
a rather heated exchange, Keller and
several of the demonstrators argued
over the rights of the protesting
students and of the job applicant.
The Placement Director then
informed the students that he believed
they were in violation of the University
disruption policy, but did not declare
the gathering a disruption at that time.
He then retired to his office, with
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Merington
and Sergeant Tamm, to consult by
telephone with John Schwartz, an
assistant to President Lyman.
New Room
Schwartz apparently advised the trio
to ask the recruiter and student to
move to a cubicle across the corridor
and to invoke the disruption policy if
protesters interrupted the interview
again in the new room.
At about 2:45 p.m., after the flag
blocking the corridor had been pulled
down, Keller moved the interview
participants. The demonstrators
followed them into the room while
police photographers took pictures, and
the protesters refused to leave.
Keller then declared the incident a
disruption, informed the students that
they were in violation of the University
policy, and asked Chief Herrington to
control the situation.
Borrowing the radicals' bullhorn,
Herrington ordered the demonstrators
to leave at 2:50 p.m., and told them
that unless they did, he would ask the


— Daily photo by Harvey Rogof,
THREAT OF ARREST—Sheriff's deputy Don Tamm informed demonstrators at the Placement Center yesterday that, if they
chose not to leave, they would be arrested and removed. Tamm pinned his badge conspicuously on his lapel, borrowed the
demonstrators' bullhorn, and made the announcement at Stanford Police Chief Marvin Herrington's request.
Sheriff's officers present to remove and
arrest them.
During the ten minute period
allowed by Herrington for discussion
among the demonstrators, they choose
to remain in the building until
threatened with police removal and/or
arrest.
Misdemeanor
At 3:00 p.m., Tamm, using the same
bullhorn, informed the 30 people in the
corridor that, in his opinion, they were
violating section 602 of the California
Penal Code, which provides
misdemeanor penalties for anyone who
disrupts lawful business. He informed
the protesters present that they would
be arrested if they remained in the
building.
After this announcement, the group
filed slowly out the back door of the
building without any action by
Sheriff's deputies.
After leaving the building, they
listened to several speakers using a
bullhorn, who promised to return to
the placement building tomorrow and
then dispersed.

Keller, Schwartz, and Lyman all said
after the disruption that if the Stanford
Judicial Council is convened and
evidence from photographs and
witnesses warrants prosecution, charges
will be brought against students
involved in the disturbance.
The incident was photographed by
several police and news service
photographers, and observed by
plainclothes police officers,
administrators, and Craig Brown of the
Santa Clara County District Attorney's
office. There were at least eight
helmeted deputies in the area as well.
