# NAS Won't Sponsor Research
## Shockley Again Denied Recognition 
### BRUCE COLLINS 
Stanford professor William
Shockley has once again been
blocked in his effort to have the
National Academy of Science
undertake research on what he
calls the "environment-heredity
uncertainty."
Voting at a business meeting
last week, the NAS, the most
prestigious scientific body in this
country, refused for the fifth year
to sponsor research on the
relationship between heredity and
intelligence.

Shockley nevertheless
presented a paper to the general
public last Wednesday urging "a
review by a proper committee of
the Academy. . .to determine the
validity of the conclusion that
genes dominate IQ differences for
typical white populations."
The physicist and Nobel
prizewinner was reacting to the
report of an NAS committee
formed two years ago to
determine whether his research
could be considered proper and
socially relevant.

The committee, chaired by
Berkeley sociologist, Kingsley
Davis, concluded, "All that can be
said is that with respect to some
problems they (genetic factors)
are highly important, while with
respect to others they are
unimportant."
Deficits Hereditary?
In a paper presented to the
NAS in 1968, Shockley stated
that his studies led him
"inescapably to the opinion that
the major deficit in Negro

intellectual performance must be
primarily of hereditary origin and
thus relatively irremedial by
practical improvement in the
environment."
For five years Shockley has
asked the NAS to endorse a
statement which he feels is central
to this question: "Intelligence,
measured by IQ, varies more than
twice as much from genetic
differences as from environmental
ones for individuals like those
from families that raise one of a
pair of white identical twins."
Supported by a study of 122 pairs
of white identical twins separated
at birth, Shockley claims that
heredity is responsible for 80 per
cent of a person's intelligence,
environment, only 20 per cent.
The formation of the Davis
committee, Shockley considers,
was an important breakthrough in
having his views taken seriously.
Referring to a harsher stand by
the NAS in 1967, he commented
upon receiving the report last year
"My general reaction is that this
report represents enormous
progress over the one issued in
1967."
First Exposure
Shockley first got widespread
reaction to his views through a
1965 U.S. News and World
Report interview, "Is Quality of
U.S. Population Declining'?" In it,
he expressed concern that a
"retrogressive evolution" due to
the rapid welfare-induced
reproduction of people with
inferior genes would result in a
genetically deteriorated society.
Research Inadequate
Shockley first presented his
views to the NAS at its 1966 Fall
meeting. Soon after he asked the
organization, "Can improved
environment remedy the

obviously enormous social
disadvantages afflicting the
illegitimate 25 per cent of Negro
babies or will genetic inheritance
produce such a low social capacity
index that most will perform at
frustratingly low social levels?"
The N.A.S. answered him in
the fall of 1967 with a 1600 word
report compiled with the help of
"several eminent geneticists." The
report said essentially that present
research techniques were
inadequate for measuring the
relative factors of heredity and
environment, these factors being
even more complex for
determining racial differences in
intelligence.
It concluded, "We question the
social urgency of a crash program
to measure genetic differences in
intellectual and emotional traits
between racial groups. In the first
place, if the traits are at all
complex the results of such
research are almost certain to be
inconclusive. In the second place,
it is not clear that major social
decisions depend on such
information; we would hope that
persons would be considered as
individuals and not as members of
groups."
Pro Eugenics
However, when the study of
white identical twins was
published by Arthur Jensen of
Berkeley in late 1969, Shockley
argued that his findings made
necessary a revision of the 1967
statement, especially since one of
the geneticists who had worked
on the report now supported
Jensen.
He attributed most of his
opposition to an "inverted
liberalism" that results from an
emotional reaction to Nazi
history. The lesson of Nazi
history, he said, "is the value of
free speech, not that eugenics is
intolerable. A form of eugenics
has been in effect in Denmark for
30 years."
Even though its attitude has
softened, Shockley still finds the
position of the N.A.S., which he
calls, "the intellectual conscience
of our nation on matters of
scientific fact," unacceptable, as
evidenced by his proposal this fall.

UP GO THE BARRICADES What primal urge is presently forcing record numbers of students to
barricade themselves in UGLY? Finals are nowhere near, yet every last easy chair is filled each evening.
Perhaps student social undercurrents can explain this phenomenon.
