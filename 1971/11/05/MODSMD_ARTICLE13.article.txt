# Library Increasing In Popularity; As UGLY Study Upsurge Remains
## 
### JERRY COLEMAN 
Few people can explain a
phenomenon taking place on
campus these days: the
unprecedented increase in time
students spend studying.
The most obvious
manifestation of this trend is
found in the unusually large
numbers of students using the
Undergraduate Library (UGLY).
Jim Almas, member of the
Academic Council Committee on
Libraries, and a monitor at the
exit gate on Sunday afternoons,
points to these figures: last year's
average number of people entering
the library on any Sunday from
noon to 1:00 p.m. was 250.
The number jumped to 350 for
midterm week. On Sunday, Oct.
31 (this quarter's midterm week's
start) 653 people passed through
the downstairs turnstiles from
12:00 to 1:00. Even more
surprising are the facts for
weekend nights.
Lee Riley, Friday night
Reference Desk worker, notices
more books taken out and a
greater amount of general activity
this year than in the past.
Seating Capacity Exceeded
The busiest night to date this
quarter, Monday Nov. 1, saw the
library open its arms to 1855
studiers in just four hours.
Although many of these people
come and go, staying for just a
short time, the figure remains
startling in the light of the total
seating capacity of UGLY being
only 1520!
What has caused this major
increase in the time students allot

to studying and the subsequent
increase in the use of the library?
Riley notes that another
Reference Desk worker feels there
may be a more general acceptance
of studying this year.
Students may be feeling less
peer-group pressure against
studying. Riley said, "Students
who are apathetic in
non-academic areas may have
nothing better to do than study."
These reasons point to
developing social undercurrents
among students. In response to
the observation that studying has
come into a new vogue at
Stanford, Sociology Professor
Sanford Dornbusch commented,
"I find this absolutely fascinating
but I don't know what's causing
it."
Two Social Theories
Some thoughts on the matter
have been offered by Professor
Nathan Glazer, currently working
at the nearby Center for
Advanced Studies in the
Behavioral Sciences, and author of
such books as Remembering the
Answers—Essays on the American
Student Revolt, and The Lonely
Crowd.
Professor Glazer feefs that of
all the theories on student
movements circulating today, two
help explain UGLY's crowding.
First, students are beginning to
realize that "the world outside is
getting harder."
"There is a rising sense again
that one should use college for
vocational preparation," Glazer
adds. He suggests that the

worsening economic situation
may be at the basis of this trend.
According to the second
theory, "a decline of the radical
movement in politics (itself a
mystery) has made traditional
pursuits, such as studying,
important again." Many students
echo the professor's view.
UGLY Studiers Speak Out
The true source for an answer
must, in the end, come from the
students at UGLY themselves.
One upperclass male says, "I'm
more study conscious this year,"
and suggests that such attitudes
are widespread.
In an UGLY survey taken the
first Friday of the quarter,
students said they were there to

look over the reference books
gvailable.
Others claimed that by using
UGLY early, they could beat their
classmates in the'race to obtain
heavily-demanded books. And at
least one student affirmed that
the buzzing noise and the
overhead lights put him to sleep
more effectively than any dorm
bedroom!
The phenomenon of this
quarter remains to be conclusively
explained. Most likely, a
combination of these reasons is
involved.
Whatever its causes, the results
can only be examined after
Autumn finals have been taken
and graded.

points to these figures: last year's
average number of people entering
the library on any Sunday from
noon to 1:00 p.m. was 250.
The number jumped to 350 for
midterm week. On Sunday, Oct.
31 (this quarter's midterm week's
start) 653 people passed through
the downstairs turnstiles from
12:00 to 1:00. Even more
surprising are the facts for
weekend nights.
Lee Riley, Friday night
Reference Desk worker, notices
more books taken out and a
greater amount of general activity
this year than in the past.
Seating Capacity Exceeded
The busiest night to date this
quarter, Monday Nov. 1, saw the
library open its arms to 1855
studiers in just four hours.
Although many of these people
come and go, staying for just a
short time, the figure remains
startling in the light of the total
seating capacity of UGLY being
only 1520!
What has caused this major
increase in the time students allot

to studying and the subsequent
increase in the use of the library?
Riley notes that another
Reference Desk worker feels there
may be a more general acceptance
of studying this year.
Students may be feeling less
peer-group pressure against
studying. Riley said, "Students
who are apathetic in
non-academic areas may have
nothing better to do than study."
These reasons point to
developing social undercurrents
among students. In response to
the observation that studying has
come into a new vogue at
Stanford, Sociology Professor
Sanford Dornbusch commented,
"I find this absolutely fascinating
but I don't know what's causing
it."
Two Social Theories
Some thoughts on the matter
have been offered by Professor
Nathan Glazer, currently working
at the nearby Center for
Advanced Studies in the
Behavioral Sciences, and author of
such books as Remembering the
Answers—Essays on the American
Student Revolt, and The Lonely
Crowd.
Professor Glazer feefs that of
all the theories on student
movements circulating today, two
help explain UGLY's crowding.
First, students are beginning to
realize that "the world outside is
getting harder."
"There is a rising sense again
that one should use college for
vocational preparation," Glazer
adds. He suggests that the

worsening economic situation
may be at the basis of this trend.
According to the second
theory, "a decline of the radical
movement in politics (itself a
mystery) has made traditional
pursuits, such as studying,
important again." Many students
echo the professor's view.
UGLY Studiers Speak Out
The true source for an answer
must, in the end, come from the
students at UGLY themselves.
One upperclass male says, "I'm
more study conscious this year,"
and suggests that such attitudes
are widespread.
In an UGLY survey taken the
first Friday of the quarter,
students said they were there to

look over the reference books
gvailable.
Others claimed that by using
UGLY early, they could beat their
classmates in the'race to obtain
heavily-demanded books. And at
least one student affirmed that
the buzzing noise and the
overhead lights put him to sleep
more effectively than any dorm
bedroom!
The phenomenon of this
quarter remains to be conclusively
explained. Most likely, a
combination of these reasons is
involved.
Whatever its causes, the results
can only be examined after
Autumn finals have been taken
and graded.
Few people can explain a
phenomenon taking place on
campus these days: the
unprecedented increase in time
students spend studying.
The most obvious
manifestation of this trend is
found in the unusually large
numbers of students using the
Undergraduate Library (UGLY).
Jim Almas, member of the
Academic Council Committee on
Libraries, and a monitor at the
exit gate on Sunday afternoons,
points to these figures: last year's
average number of people entering
the library on any Sunday from
noon to 1:00 p.m. was 250.
