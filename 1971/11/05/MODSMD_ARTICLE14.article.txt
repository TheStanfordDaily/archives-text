# At The Movies
## Bad Box-Office Year 
### TODD McCARTHY 
Late fall is traditionally the
slowest season of the year for
movies. Distributors try to get
their most promising product out
by Labor Day or save it until
Christmas and theatre owners are
forced to hold onto summer hits
or use their imaginations in
coming up with appetizing double
bills. Unfortunately for
exhibitors, 1971 has thus far
proved about the worst year in
twenty years in terms of relative
box-office receipts.
Not counting "Love Story,"
which came out late last
December, the year has yielded
only three solid smashes in
"Carnal Knowledge," "Summer of
'42" and "Willard." Below the
golden three, but still in the
definite hit category, are "Shaft,"
"Klute," "Love Machine," "A
New Leaf," "The Andromeda
Strain," "The Anderson Tapes"
and two independent X-rated
oddities "The Stewardesses" and
"Sweet Sweetback." Films such as
"McCabe and Mrs. Miller" and
"Bananas" might turn a small
profit but basically, that's it.
Eleven big films in close to a year.
In New York City, several of
the most prestigious theatres have
been forced to shutter
temporarily for lack of new
product and the previous
distinction between Broadway
showplaces and East Side art

houses has disappeared. In San
Francisco, always a great town for
revivals, half the houses now seem
to be playing reissues and one can
currently find one of the oddest
triple bills of all time,
"Satyricon," "Women in Love"
and "Myra Breckenridge," at a
downtown cinema.
Lower Prices
Once a plague has set in, I
suppose there is little to do but
wait it out and hope it will pass
quickly. The current trend
towards lower admission prices is
not only welcome but sensible
and a few houses have taken to
midnight screenings of specialized
fare. Given current conditions,
what I'd like to see is the release
of the many films, from both here
and abroad, which are backlogged,
shelved or without a distributor.
Claude Chabrol's three latest films
have yet to be seen commercially
in this country and such hits of
the recent film festival as Jacques
Demy's "Peau d'Ane" and
Bellochio's "In the Name of the
Father" are still without
distributors.
In San Francisco we have yet
to see the likes of Joseph Losey's
interesting "Figures in a
Landscape" (which was made
more than a year before the
current "The Go-Between"), Eric
Rohmer's "La Collectioneuse"
and Abe Polonsky's "Romance of
a Horse Thief." As well, Peter

Brook's film of "King Lear" with
Paul Scofield has been waiting in
the wings for at least two years
now.
Excellent Bills
Locally we have a few
conpensations in the way of
excellent double bills,
undoubtedly the best of which is
"Claire's Knee" and
"Investigation of a Citizen Above
Suspicion" at the Paris. After
repeated viewings, "Claire's Knee"
holds up as a masterpiece, one of
the most personal, literate and
engaging films I've ever seen. Next
at the Paris will be Fellini's nicest
film in years, "The Clowns."
"The Hellstrom Chronicle" and
"Z" continue at the Guild and of
great, if more esoteric interest are
Jan Kadar's "Adrift" and Milos
Forman's "Loves of a Blonde" at
the Fine Arts. One not to miss is
"Two-Lane Blacktop," but it
probably won't stay at the Menlo
for more than a week.
Of course, there are always
films on campus. I'd like to
resume my Films of the Week
column but at least half of the
films shown on campus these days
seem to be scheduled at the last
minute. If you're showing a film,
please contact me at the Daily as
early as possible so I can include it
in my round-up the Monday
before.

SOUTH AMERICAN STAR—Florinda Bolkan, a former Brazilian
airlines stewardess, co-stars with Gian Maria Volonte in "investigation
of a Citizen Above Suspicion," now showing at the Paris with Eric
Rohmer's masterpiece, "Claire's Knee." Elio Petri's study of
corruption in the Italian police won last year's Academy Award for
best foreign film and Miss Bolkan has been seen in "The Damned" and
"The Anonymous Venetian."


DIFFERENT DRUMS-Van Morrison (above) will be appearing
tonight and tomorrow night at Winterland in San Francisco. Taj
Mahal, Lamb and Wet Willie will also be on the bill. Shows start
nightly at 8 p.m. and tickets are $4. Sandor Salgo (below) will
conduct the Stanford Chamber Orchestra in a free concert with the
Stanford Chorale on Sunday afternoon at 3 p.m. in Dinkelspeil
Auditorium.

Bellochio's "In the Name of the
Father" are still without
distributors.
In San Francisco we have yet
to see the likes of Joseph Losey's
interesting "Figures in a
Landscape" (which was made
more than a year before the
current "The Go-Between"), Eric
Rohmer's "La Collectioneuse"
and Abe Polonsky's "Romance of
a Horse Thief." As well, Peter

Brook's film of "King Lear" with
Paul Scofield has been waiting in
the wings for at least two years
now.
Excellent Bills
Locally we have a few
conpensations in the way of
excellent double bills,
undoubtedly the best of which is
"Claire's Knee" and
"Investigation of a Citizen Above
Suspicion" at the Paris. After
repeated viewings, "Claire's Knee"
holds up as a masterpiece, one of
the most personal, literate and
engaging films I've ever seen. Next
at the Paris will be Fellini's nicest
film in years, "The Clowns."
"The Hellstrom Chronicle" and
"Z" continue at the Guild and of
great, if more esoteric interest are
Jan Kadar's "Adrift" and Milos
Forman's "Loves of a Blonde" at
the Fine Arts. One not to miss is
"Two-Lane Blacktop," but it
probably won't stay at the Menlo
for more than a week.
Of course, there are always
films on campus. I'd like to
resume my Films of the Week
column but at least half of the
films shown on campus these days
seem to be scheduled at the last
minute. If you're showing a film,
please contact me at the Daily as
early as possible so I can include it
in my round-up the Monday
before.

SOUTH AMERICAN STAR—Florinda Bolkan, a former Brazilian
airlines stewardess, co-stars with Gian Maria Volonte in "investigation
of a Citizen Above Suspicion," now showing at the Paris with Eric
Rohmer's masterpiece, "Claire's Knee." Elio Petri's study of
corruption in the Italian police won last year's Academy Award for
best foreign film and Miss Bolkan has been seen in "The Damned" and
"The Anonymous Venetian."


DIFFERENT DRUMS-Van Morrison (above) will be appearing
tonight and tomorrow night at Winterland in San Francisco. Taj
Mahal, Lamb and Wet Willie will also be on the bill. Shows start
nightly at 8 p.m. and tickets are $4. Sandor Salgo (below) will
conduct the Stanford Chamber Orchestra in a free concert with the
Stanford Chorale on Sunday afternoon at 3 p.m. in Dinkelspeil
Auditorium.

Late fall is traditionally the
slowest season of the year for
movies. Distributors try to get
their most promising product out
by Labor Day or save it until
Christmas and theatre owners are
forced to hold onto summer hits
or use their imaginations in
coming up with appetizing double
bills. Unfortunately for
exhibitors, 1971 has thus far
proved about the worst year in
twenty years in terms of relative
box-office receipts.
Not counting "Love Story,"
which came out late last
December, the year has yielded
only three solid smashes in
"Carnal Knowledge," "Summer of
'42" and "Willard." Below the
golden three, but still in the
definite hit category, are "Shaft,"
"Klute," "Love Machine," "A
New Leaf," "The Andromeda
Strain," "The Anderson Tapes"
and two independent X-rated
oddities "The Stewardesses" and
"Sweet Sweetback." Films such as
"McCabe and Mrs. Miller" and
"Bananas" might turn a small
profit but basically, that's it.
Eleven big films in close to a year.
In New York City, several of
the most prestigious theatres have
been forced to shutter
temporarily for lack of new
product and the previous
distinction between Broadway
showplaces and East Side art

houses has disappeared. In San
Francisco, always a great town for
revivals, half the houses now seem
to be playing reissues and one can
currently find one of the oddest
triple bills of all time,
"Satyricon," "Women in Love"
and "Myra Breckenridge," at a
downtown cinema.
Lower Prices
Once a plague has set in, I
suppose there is little to do but
wait it out and hope it will pass
quickly. The current trend
towards lower admission prices is
not only welcome but sensible
and a few houses have taken to
midnight screenings of specialized
fare. Given current conditions,
what I'd like to see is the release
of the many films, from both here
and abroad, which are backlogged,
shelved or without a distributor.
Claude Chabrol's three latest films
have yet to be seen commercially
in this country and such hits of
the recent film festival as Jacques
Demy's "Peau d'Ane" and
Bellochio's "In the Name of the
Father" are still without

Late fall is traditionally the
slowest season of the year for
movies. Distributors try to get
their most promising product out
by Labor Day or save it until
Christmas and theatre owners are
forced to hold onto summer hits
or use their imaginations in
coming up with appetizing double
bills. Unfortunately for
exhibitors, 1971 has thus far
proved about the worst year in
twenty years in terms of relative
box-office receipts.
Not counting "Love Story,"
which came out late last
December, the year has yielded
only three solid smashes in
"Carnal Knowledge," "Summer of
'42" and "Willard." Below the
golden three, but still in the
definite hit category, are "Shaft,"
"Klute," "Love Machine," "A
New Leaf," "The Andromeda
Strain," "The Anderson Tapes"
and two independent X-rated
oddities "The Stewardesses" and
"Sweet Sweetback." Films such as
"McCabe and Mrs. Miller" and
"Bananas" might turn a small
profit but basically, that's it.
Eleven big films in close to a year.
In New York City, several of
the most prestigious theatres have
been forced to shutter
temporarily for lack of new
product and the previous
distinction between Broadway
showplaces and East Side art

houses has disappeared. In San
Francisco, always a great town for
revivals, half the houses now seem
to be playing reissues and one can
currently find one of the oddest
triple bills of all time,
"Satyricon," "Women in Love"
and "Myra Breckenridge," at a
downtown cinema.
Lower Prices
Once a plague has set in, I
suppose there is little to do but
wait it out and hope it will pass
quickly. The current trend
towards lower admission prices is
not only welcome but sensible
and a few houses have taken to
midnight screenings of specialized
fare. Given current conditions,
what I'd like to see is the release
of the many films, from both here
and abroad, which are backlogged,
shelved or without a distributor.
Claude Chabrol's three latest films
have yet to be seen commercially
in this country and such hits of
the recent film festival as Jacques
Demy's "Peau d'Ane" and
Bellochio's "In the Name of the
Father" are still without
distributors.
In San Francisco we have yet
to see the likes of Joseph Losey's
interesting "Figures in a
Landscape" (which was made
more than a year before the
current "The Go-Between"), Eric
Rohmer's "La Collectioneuse"
and Abe Polonsky's "Romance of
a Horse Thief." As well, Peter

Brook's film of "King Lear" with
Paul Scofield has been waiting in
the wings for at least two years
now.
Excellent Bills
Locally we have a few
conpensations in the way of
excellent double bills,
undoubtedly the best of which is
"Claire's Knee" and
"Investigation of a Citizen Above
Suspicion" at the Paris. After
repeated viewings, "Claire's Knee"
holds up as a masterpiece, one of
the most personal, literate and
engaging films I've ever seen. Next
at the Paris will be Fellini's nicest
film in years, "The Clowns."
"The Hellstrom Chronicle" and
"Z" continue at the Guild and of
great, if more esoteric interest are
Jan Kadar's "Adrift" and Milos
Forman's "Loves of a Blonde" at
the Fine Arts. One not to miss is
"Two-Lane Blacktop," but it
probably won't stay at the Menlo
for more than a week.
Of course, there are always
films on campus. I'd like to
resume my Films of the Week
column but at least half of the
films shown on campus these days
seem to be scheduled at the last
minute. If you're showing a film,
please contact me at the Daily as
early as possible so I can include it
in my round-up the Monday
before.

airlines stewardess, co-stars with Gian Maria Volonte in "investigation
of a Citizen Above Suspicion," now showing at the Paris with Eric
Rohmer's masterpiece, "Claire's Knee." Elio Petri's study of
corruption in the Italian police won last year's Academy Award for
best foreign film and Miss Bolkan has been seen in "The Damned" and
"The Anonymous Venetian."
