## Time To Decide 
### Charlie Hoffman 
The whole season for Stanford comes down to one game tomorrow
with UCLA's Bruins, and the Indians must win and hope for some
help from the Trojans in order to clinch a second straight trip to
Pasadena.
The Bruins have had a disastrous season and will arrive in Palo Alto
with a 2-6 record. Two of their losses came to national powers Texas
and Michigan, and they are the sole conference conqueror of
Washington State and should not be considered a pushover.
John Ralston has great respect for UCLA, insisting that they are "a
very well balanced team with the finest kicking game in the
conference." The Bruins have by far the best kicking game the Indians
have faced this year and this could be a significant factor tomorrow.
Efren Herrera kicked field goals against Washington last week of 29,
48, 45, and 43 yards and has been a consistent threat inside the 50 all
season. Bruce Barnes leads the Pac-8 in punting with a 41.9 average
and Ralston fears that he will put the Indians in poor field position
with his fine punting.
The excellence of the Bruin's kicking game is in direct contrast to
Stanford's which is in question at the moment. Rod Garcia is suffering
from a bruised heel and Ralston has to substitute for Garcia if he
cannot play. Tom Sones will kick off if Garcia is held out of the game
and either Garcia or Greg Sampson will kick field goals and extra
points if needed. Stanford-UCLA games have been decided by field
goals the past two years and if Garcia does not play tomorrow, this
precedent may be dangerous for the Indians. Steve Horowitz kicked
three field goals last year in Los Angeles as the Indians won 9-7, and
he had one blocked in the last seconds of the 1969 contest to leave
the game in a 20-20 tie.
Pepper Rodgers, the Bruin coach, is planning to run the triple
option that has plagued Stanford's defenders the past two weeks.
Third string quarterback Scott Henderson will pilot the option out of
the I formation and Randy Tyler will probably do most of the
ball-carrying from his tailback position. Tyler gained 102 yards against
the Huskies last week and Gary Campbell who Ralston thinks is a
"very fine inside runner" should fill the other backfield slot.
The Stanford injury situation is much improved, and only Hillary
Shockley and Eric Cross will not play.
A Stanford win and a Washington State loss tomorrow would wrap
up the Rose Bowl race with two games left in the season. Ralston feels
that USC has the best chance of knocking off the upstart Cougars.
Coming off impressive wins over Notre Dame and Cal, the Trojans are
confident that they can win the rest of their games. It does not seem
likely that the Cougars can successfully continue their Cinderella act
against a fired up Trojan team in the Coliseum tomorrow night.
Regardless of events in Los Angeles, the Indians must win to have a
good chance of returning to the Rose Bowl. Rodgers is fully as
innovative a coach as Ralston, and tomorrow's contest should be wide
open with the Indians coming out on top by a touchdown.
