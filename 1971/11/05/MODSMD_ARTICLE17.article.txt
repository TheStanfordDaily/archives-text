# USF Dumps Indian Kickers, 3-0
## 
### 
Outclassed but not outhustled,
the Stanford soccer team dropped
a 3-0 decision to the University of
San Erancisco Dons, the third best
team in the nation. Though close
the whole way, Stanford was
finally defeated by a combination
of their own erratic shooting and
USF's superior individual talent.
Yesterday's 3-0 loss to Fullerton
added to the USF defeat drops
Stanford to a 3-5-2 record with
six games remaining.
Stanford's record is not
indicative of their overall
improvement this season. They
are faced with one of the most
difficult schedules, in playing two
of the top three teams in the
nation, UCLA and USF, as well as

perennial powers, Chico State, Cal
State Fullerton, and San Jose
State.
The USF game was by far the
roughest game of the Stanford
season so far. The first quarter
was even with the Stanford
defense keeping USF out of
scoring range. But with less than a
minute to play in the quarter,
Grant Heidrich, starting defense
center, suffered a dislocated
shoulder when tackled by a USF
player. Moments later USF's Hans
Frisson broke for an unassisted
goal from less than ten feet out.
The second quarter was
scoreless, USF clinging to a 1-0
lead at half. The turning point
came late in the third quarter

when Edgar Sagaltume beat the
defense back for another easy goal
giving USF a 2-0 lead.
Stanford vainly tried to fight
back. With their inadequate
shooting and the USF defense,
though, scoring proved
impossible. USF scored one more
goal on a one-man effort by Roger
de Leon, giving USF a hard fought
3-0 victory.
This Saturday at 10:30 a.m.,
Stanford has a home game against
UCLA.
