### MIKE CHASSON 
The Stanford cross-country
team, in its last test before the
Pacific Eight Championships,
defeated Cal and SC at Berkeley
last weekend. Stanford scored 31
points to 4 1 for Cal and 52 for
SC.
Duncan Macdonald broke his
second course record of the
season to lead the Indians.
Macdonald ran 20:00 over the
four mile Strawberry Canyon
course to break the old record of
20:06 set by Mark Hiefield of

Washington State last year.
Indians Bernie Lahde, Brian
Middlestadt, and Bob Coe finished
fourth, fifth, and sixth
respectively.
The stage was set for the
Pacific Eight Championships as
Washington State crushed Oregon,
Oregon State and Washington in
the Northern Division meet at
Eugene.
Coach Marshall Clark was very
pleased with victory over Cal and
USC. He was particularly happy
with Brian Middlestadt's fine
performance. Clark, however,
stated once again that Stanford's
top five runners must stay closer
together if they are to do well in
the Pacific Eight championships.
Stanford has been unable to have
five runners finish close together
yet this year.
Clark couldn't say from the
results of the Northern Division
meet how Stanford would do at
the Pac-8 meet. He believes,
however, Washington State is the
clear cut favorite, with Oregon,
Stanford, and UCLA battling for
second place.
The Indians take a weekend off
before traveling to UCLA for the
Pacific Eight Championships.
