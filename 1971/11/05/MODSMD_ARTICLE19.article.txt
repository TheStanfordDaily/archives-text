# Poloists Aim For Pac-8 Lead
## 
### DOUG WILSON 
A share of the Pacific-8 water
polo lead will be Stanford's if the
Indian water poloists can defeat
the league-leading UCLA Bruins
tomorrow, when Stanford hosts
UCLA at 10:00 a.m. at Encina
pool.
Both teams are already assured
of berths in the NCAA water polo
championships later this month at
Long Beach. UCLA is presently
undefeated in Pac-8 play, and
Stanford's lone conference defeat
came at the hands of the Bruins
three weeks ago, when UCLA
managed a goal in sudden-death
play to win the match, 12-11.
Since then, Stanford has gone
on to twice defeat USC, as well as
lesser opponents Pomona and
Santa Barbara. The Indians were
outclassed by PCAA power San
Jose, 8-7, two weeks ago.
UCLA, meanwhile, soundly

dunked UC-Berkeley and repeated
a victory over USC. Both Stanford
and UCLA, however, managed
their second victories over the
Trojans by two-point margins.
The UCLA offense is headed
by Paul Beskehazy and Greg Arth.
Goalie Bill Craig, highly regarded
in California water polo circles,
leads the Bruin defense.
Offensively, Stanford will counter
with Rick Massimino, Randy
Wilkins, Bill Simpkins and Mike
Davis. Craig's counterpart in the
Stanford goal is Pete Gadd.
Of Stanford's prospects for
victory, Coach Jim Gaughran
commented "I hope that we'll
play as well as we did down
South. They (UCLA) have been
beating teams quite well since we
played them, but if we can keep
up tight control of the ball, I
think it will be a very close
game."

Two games remain for the
Stanford varsity following
tomorrow's match with UCLA.
The Indians play the University of
the Pacific in Stockton Nov. 12,
end the season with a
UC-Berkeley rematch a week from
tomorrow at Encina pool, and
then prepare for the NCAA
tournament to be held November
26-27 in Long Beach.
