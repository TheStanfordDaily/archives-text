# Final Arguments
## Fisher Demands Franklin Ouster 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
"Dismissal would be the proper
remedy," lawyer Raymond Fisher said
yesterday, as the administration
presented its closing arguments in the
six-week-old dismissal hearing of
Professor H. Bruce Franklin.
"The university cannot tolerate a
person who deliberately provokes the
use of force, coercion, and violence to
achieve" his goals, Fisher said.
Fisher insisted the Board should
judge "whether or not there is anything
in Professor Franklin's testimony to
indicate that he does have any concern
for the rules or regulations of this
university, whether there is any
evidence that his behavior in the future
would be any different, whether he
really thinks he did anything wrong.
"I submit that the answer is that he
does not, and in so answering the
question, dismissal is the proper
result."
The administration lawyer detailed
his case in less than two hours of the
four hours allotted to him. The hearing
will end today with final arguments
from Franklin, an English professor and
leading Bay Area revolutionary. The
session will begin at 1 p.m. in Physics
101.
Franklin said he will move for
dismissal of the charges today because
"the administration still does not have
any kind of case at all."
The Advisory Board denied
Franklin's request yesterday that he be
allowed to give a half hour of his
argument time to the American Civil
Liberties Union. The ACLU
unsuccessfully asked Wednesday for its
own time to address the Board as a

"friend of the court" concerning civil
liberties issues raised by the Franklin
case.
Board Chairman Donald Kennedy
said the ACLU can submit a written
brief under procedures set earlier, when
a faculty group asked to participate in
the hearing.
After today's session, the Advisory
Board will begin at least a month of
deliberations before submitting its
recommendation to President Richard
Lyman.
In his argument, Fisher said the issue
before the Board is whether Franklin
has violated "the rules of this university
and the academic tradition against the
use of force and violence."
Fisher said the Board is not bound
by the standards of a formal court
although he frequently quoted court
precedents in his argument.
He emphasized Franklin's actions
should be viewed in the context of his
reputation "as a leader of the
movement."
Three of four charges against
Franklin involve alleged incitements of
violence, Feb. 10. Fisher said,
"Professor Franklin's conduct on that
day is clearly one of provoking
confrontation between police and
demonstrators.
"He's got to protect his job, so he'll
stay out of (campus violence)," Fisher
said. "But he's got no qualms about
sending other people out to confront
the police."
Fisher called that "a very, very
cynical approach to what a faculty
member ought to be doing on this
campus."
TTie Los Angeles lawyer told the
seven-professor Board that the
administration would demand
suspension rather than dismissal if
Franklin were guilty only of the charge
that he disrupted a speech by Henry
Cabot Lodge. But he said that if
Franklin is guilty of any one of the
three incitement charges, "that conduct
is so serious that it merits dismissal."
THE LODGE INCIDENT
The first charge against Franklin is
participation in disruption of a Jan. 11
speech by Henry Cabot Lodge, former
Ambassador to South Vietnam. Fisher
said, "The conduct involved in
disrupting a university program ... is a
very serious offense in a university
community."
Fisher denied Franklin's contention
that the crowd's disruption was not
substantial enough to warrant
cancellation of the speech. "It was a
clear disruption. It was a sustained
disruption," he said.
Also challenging testimony that
Franklin heckled only several times,
Fisher said, "Sustained chanting to
shout down a speaker is not (merely)
heckling in our view or the view of the
courts."
Fisher said the 37-year-old professor
was not singled out of the crowd. "The
fact of the matter is that right from the
out-set Professor Franklin made himself
well-known."

Fisher said administration witnesses
were carefully watching Franklin while
Franklin's witnesses were "just
listening" to him.
Fisher charged that repetitious
"patterns in testimony" of Franklin's
witnesses indicated "that their
testimony had been pretty well
coached or at least prepared."
According to Fisher, the Lodge
incident showed "the tendency of
Professor Franklin to move
immediately to acts of coercion to
impose his views on the university
community."
WHITE PLAZA SPEECH
Three of the four charges concern
events on Feb. 10, a day of campus
protest against the invasion of Laos and
a war-related project at the
Computation Center.
Franklin is charged with inciting
occupation of the Computation Center
during a noontime rally at White Plaza.
Fisher said Franklin's speech fell within
legal standards of incitement—that it
was aimed at producing "imminent
lawless action" and that it was "likely
to produce" such action.
Fisher said the speech took place
when "the campus was really in a fairly
tense situation." He charged Franklin
spoke "in a manner that was clearly
calculated to get people to move out
and shut down the Computation
Center. That's the plain meaning."
Fisher, a Stanford Law School
alumnus, said many at the rally could
not have grasped the "subtle meanings"
which Franklin's witnesses attributed
to the speech.
Fisher said references in Franklin's
speech to the "Cambodia strike" the
year before implied approval of such
tactics as blocking doorways. He said
the Cambodia protest was not merely a
"voluntary boycott."
"He had to know people were going
to consider that in terms of going into
the Comp Center or at least blocking
doorways." Fisher said militant actions,
including damage to the computer,
were considered at a meeting Franklin

attended the night before.
Fisher insisted Franklin played a
crucial role in the White Plaza rally.
"He moved in as a revolutionary
leader ... by his own testimony.
DISPERSAL ORDER
Franklin is charged with inciting
resistance to a police dispersal order
outside the Computation Center after
an occupation of the building was
ended by police.
Fisher said that after the dispersal
announcement, "order was in the
process of being restored" until
Franklin brought the crowd back and
began loudly "baiting the police."
Franklin should have urged the
