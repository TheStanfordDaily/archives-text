# Frosh Football Squad Plays UCLA Saturday
## 
### MIKE HERMAN 
Two weeks ago, while the Stanford Frosh team was being thrashed
by the Southern California Frosh in a more publicized game, the
freshmen Bruins of UCLA were mauling a good California team 34-0.
Tomorrow, at 10:00 a.m. at the Stadium, as a preliminary to the
important contest between the Varsities of UCLA and Stanford, the
Papooses of the Stanford Frosh will do battle with the Brubabes in
what promises to be a scrappy, hardfought ball game.
Cook Will Start
Mike Cook, who, on last week's performance alone, has wrested
the starting fullback position away from all-American Forrie Martin,
carried the ball thirty-one times in the game for 129 yards and a
touchdown. His partner in the backfield, Mark Grattan picked up a
touchdown and thirty-eight yards in fourteen carries. The combined
ground game established a balance offense that is so important in
complementing the passing game.
The two quarterback's Bob Glick and Duf Sundheim both handled
their passing with the skill of veterans. Glick completed six passes for
seventy-two yards and a touchdown, while Sundheim, in a
performance just below perfect, rifled nine passes, completing eight
for 12 2 yards. Meanwhile, End Bill Singler, the target of much of that
passing, caught six passes for ninety-eight yards.
The Stanford effort will be spurred on tomorrow by the return of
two of their defensive leaders, Forrie Martin and Scott Laildlaw.
Martin, out with three broken ribs which are still heavily bandaged,
will resume his middle-linebacking duties, while Laildlaw, who
suffered a knee injury in the USC game, will once again roam the
defensive backfield. Still on the injured list are Center Marc Frelier
(who will be replaced by Dave Shore, a former Palisades High School
star) and weakside-linebacker Brian Tyndall (who will have his
position filled by Chuck Merja, who started at middle-linebacker last
week).
UCLA Powerful
The Brubabes come to the Farm with a powerful offense that
scores frequently and almost evenly through running and passing. In
the Cal triumph, UCLA scored twice on two short yardage runs and
twice on passes of nineteen yards and twenty-nine yards. Their final
TD was scored on a fifty yard pass interception.
In an attempt to stifle that free-rolling offense, the "Thunder
Chicks" will have to perform at least as well as they played against the
Gators last week.
