Marchers Protest
SAN FRANCISCO — Saturday's anti-war protest march
here, one of 17 in the nation, will cost the Northern
California Peace Action Coalition about $80,000, officials
of the group said yesterday.
Coalition logistics coordinator Bill Marble estimated that
"anywhere from 50,000 to 300,000 people" will march
from Embarcadero Plaza to the polo field in Golden Gate
Park. Marchers will assemble at the Plaza at 8 a.m. and at
other points along the 7V4 mile route during the morning,
Marble said.
Staff co-ordinator of the coalition, Bonnie Sheppard,
told a news conference that the march is also a protest
against the slated underground nuclear blast on Amchitka
Island, Alaska.
Foreign Aid Re-cut
WASHINGTON — The Senate Foreign Relations
Committee chopped the defeated foreign aid bill into
separate economic and military sections yesterday while
the House began work on a resolution that would
temporarily revive the current program.
The Senate panel, on a series of close votes, slashed the
fund? lor the aid measures to $2.3 billion, retained an array
of restrictive provisions opposed by the Nixon
administration and sent the measure to the Senate which
six days ago rejected a $2.9 billion bill 41 to 27.
Amchitka Blast 6 0n 9
WASHINGTON — An environmental group asked Chief
Justice Warren E. Burger yesterday to halt Saturday's
underground nuclear explosion off the Alaskan coast,
pending a hearing by the full Supreme Court.
Earlier the White House turned aside mounting protests
against the blast, which would be the largest one yet
conducted in the Western world. It is scheduled for 5 p.m.
EST Saturday on Amchitka Island to test the five megaton
hydrogen bomb warhead for the Spartan antiballistic
missile.
PASADENA — Most earthquake experts believe no large
earthquake or tidal wave will be set off by the Amchitka

nuclear test unless a quake is destined to occur anyway, the
leading seismologist at the California Institute of
Technology said Thursday.
"The consensus is that the probability of a major
earthquake or tsunami tidal wave is very low but not zero,"
said Dr. Don Anderson, director of the Caltect
seismological laboratory.
Another S.F. First
SAN FRANCISCO — Reuben Greenberg, 27, is slated to
become San Francisco's first black undersheriff when
Richard Hongisto takes over as sheriff next January.
Hongisto, 35, surprise winner over veteran Sheriff
Matthew Carberry in Tuesday's election, said today he
intended to appoint Greenberg to the $21,636-a-year job.
Greenberg has a master's degree from the University of
California at Berkeley in public administration. He is
working on a doctorate there while serving as assistant
professor of public administration and public
administration and sociology at California State College at
Hayward.
Gas Tax Raised
SACRAMENTO — Gov. Reagan signed legislation yesterday
that would raise the price of gasoline about two cents per
gallon. It would raise more than $150 million a year for
cities and counties.
The bill extends the present five cent sales tax to
gasoline, levying it on top of the present 11 cents-a-gallon
state and federal gasoline taxes. Gasoline previously was
exempted from the sales tax.
Celibacy Debated
VATICAN CITY — An unexpected row on the question of
a married priesthood threw the World Bishops Synod into
confusion Thursday and disrupted its voting schedule.
One briefing officer said it was the most spirited meeting
in the synod's five weeks. Bishops both for and against a
married priesthood sharply questioned the wording of a
resolution on the matter.
Despite 91 written suggestions for revising the
resolution, a special committee came up with only minor
changes.

The bill extends the present five cent sales tax to
gasoline, levying it on top of the present 11 cents-a-gallon
state and federal gasoline taxes. Gasoline previously was
exempted from the sales tax.
Celibacy Debated
VATICAN CITY — An unexpected row on the question of
a married priesthood threw the World Bishops Synod into
confusion Thursday and disrupted its voting schedule.
One briefing officer said it was the most spirited meeting
in the synod's five weeks. Bishops both for and against a
married priesthood sharply questioned the wording of a
resolution on the matter.
Despite 91 written suggestions for revising the
resolution, a special committee came up with only minor
changes.
Marchers Protest
SAN FRANCISCO — Saturday's anti-war protest march
here, one of 17 in the nation, will cost the Northern
California Peace Action Coalition about $80,000, officials
of the group said yesterday.
Coalition logistics coordinator Bill Marble estimated that
"anywhere from 50,000 to 300,000 people" will march
from Embarcadero Plaza to the polo field in Golden Gate
Park. Marchers will assemble at the Plaza at 8 a.m. and at
other points along the 7V4 mile route during the morning,
Marble said.
Staff co-ordinator of the coalition, Bonnie Sheppard,
told a news conference that the march is also a protest
against the slated underground nuclear blast on Amchitka
Island, Alaska.
Foreign Aid Re-cut
WASHINGTON — The Senate Foreign Relations
Committee chopped the defeated foreign aid bill into
separate economic and military sections yesterday while
the House began work on a resolution that would
temporarily revive the current program.
The Senate panel, on a series of close votes, slashed the
fund? lor the aid measures to $2.3 billion, retained an array
of restrictive provisions opposed by the Nixon
administration and sent the measure to the Senate which
six days ago rejected a $2.9 billion bill 41 to 27.
Amchitka Blast 6 0n 9
WASHINGTON — An environmental group asked Chief
Justice Warren E. Burger yesterday to halt Saturday's
underground nuclear explosion off the Alaskan coast,
pending a hearing by the full Supreme Court.
Earlier the White House turned aside mounting protests
against the blast, which would be the largest one yet
conducted in the Western world. It is scheduled for 5 p.m.
EST Saturday on Amchitka Island to test the five megaton
hydrogen bomb warhead for the Spartan antiballistic
missile.
PASADENA — Most earthquake experts believe no large
earthquake or tidal wave will be set off by the Amchitka

nuclear test unless a quake is destined to occur anyway, the
leading seismologist at the California Institute of
Technology said Thursday.
"The consensus is that the probability of a major
earthquake or tsunami tidal wave is very low but not zero,"
said Dr. Don Anderson, director of the Caltect
seismological laboratory.
Another S.F. First
SAN FRANCISCO — Reuben Greenberg, 27, is slated to
become San Francisco's first black undersheriff when
Richard Hongisto takes over as sheriff next January.
Hongisto, 35, surprise winner over veteran Sheriff
Matthew Carberry in Tuesday's election, said today he
intended to appoint Greenberg to the $21,636-a-year job.
Greenberg has a master's degree from the University of
California at Berkeley in public administration. He is
working on a doctorate there while serving as assistant
professor of public administration and public
administration and sociology at California State College at
Hayward.
Gas Tax Raised
SACRAMENTO — Gov. Reagan signed legislation yesterday
that would raise the price of gasoline about two cents per
gallon. It would raise more than $150 million a year for
cities and counties.
The bill extends the present five cent sales tax to
gasoline, levying it on top of the present 11 cents-a-gallon
state and federal gasoline taxes. Gasoline previously was
exempted from the sales tax.
