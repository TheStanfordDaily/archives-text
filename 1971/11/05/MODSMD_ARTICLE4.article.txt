# Panofsky, Ehrlich, Drell Express Opposition To Amchitka Underground Nuclear Test Blast
## 
### BOB BACON 
Three noted Stanford professors have expressed
opposition to the huge underground nuclear test
scheduled to take place at Amchitkp in the Aleutian
Islands tomorrow.
Nuclear physicist Wolfgang Panofsky, Director of
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, opposes it
because of his objection to the long-range Spartan
anti-ballistic missile (ABM) system which the blast is
to test.
Noted population biologist Paul Ehrlich has
branded the test "environmental roulette, ' noting the
chance of major ecological disaster.
Sidney D. Drell, Deputy Director of SLAC, agrees
with Panofsky's characterization of the blast as
unnecessary.
Another professor, George A. Thompson,
Chairman of the Geophysics Department, took no
position on the advisability of the blast but did say
the possibility of a major damaging earthquake was
"very remote."
No Real Purpose
Panofsky, quoted in Wednesday's New York
Times, said "the test has no real military purpose and
is being held because of technological inertia. The
people who design bombs just don't want to stop
before they have the final design. They've had their
plans going for a long time.
"The issue is whether man controls technology or
technology controls man," he said.
He told the Daily, "If we do want to protect our
Minuteman missiles (the mission of ABM), it would

be much better to use a short-range missile defense,
which doesn't involve as big a bomb.
"The Spartan system is hazardous and ineffective,
and it would not be able to differentiate between
decoys and incoming missiles. It would have to be
launched before we knew what we were shooting at.
"The environmental arguments against the test
have had most of the publicity; there's been much
too little publicity on what they're testing it for," he
added.
Panofsky expressed the view that the test would
have very little effect on the U.S.-Soviet strategic
arms limitation talks (SALT). "Even if the SALT
talks limit the ABM somewhat, we may still retain a
small amount of ABM and this will test part of that
system," he explained.
"Furthermore, the Russians have set off two very
large underground blasts in the last month, which has
made it very hard to argue against this test."
Drell pointed out that the ABM was originally
conceived as a "thin city defense. The large-scale test
of the Spartan warhead was a necessity. But Congress
has cut the ABM program back to the protection of
Minuteman silos only, rendering the Spartan "totally
useless, to my judgment," according to Drell.
Discussing the SALT talks, Drell said that "either
we should cancel the test completely or else set it off
and get it over with. To hold it in abeyance would
just mean having it in the background, possibly
interfering with future stages of the talks." He
pointed out that the possibility of the big blast might
hinder progress on negotiation of a nuclear test ban

treaty prohibiting underground detonations.
"I, of course, would prefer that it be cancelled,"
Drell said.
Stupid Decision
Ehrlich, nationally known for his environmental
concerns, said that "President Nixon should be held
personally responsible for a stupid decision" in
allowing the blast to go ahead.
"Although the probability of disaster is small,"
Ehrlich said, "it's not a risk we ought to be taking.
Even if nothing happens, people shouldn't decide that
it was an intelligent decision.
"It's like Russian roulette. If you hold a pistol to
your head and pull the trigger, even if you live
through it that doesn't make it a smart thing to do,"
he pointed out.
"The risk of calamity is small, but if a small risk is
taken often enough there will be a major disaster
sooner or later."
The principal ecological danger is that of venting,
the leakage of radiation. "If that happens, most of
the fallout will be in areas with very short food chains
and a very fragile ecosystem," Ehrlich pointed out.
Alaska was rocked by a major earthquake in 1964 ,
and there is also a possibility that the blast could set
off a huge tremor and accompanying tidal wave.
"What makes it doubly preposterous to take these
risks," he added, "is that it is to test a warhead for
the ABM system which is a great danger to the
security of this country.

WRAP-UP—During final arguments in the Franklin case, administration attorney Raymond Fisher argues that "the university
cannot tolerate" Professor H. Bruce Franklin. Seated with him are lawyer Charles Rosenberg and Pres. Lyman's legal adviser,
James Siena. Franklin will summarize his case in today's final session of the unprecedented hearing.
"The decision is just dumb, but that
should come as no surprise to people
who have watched the behavior of the
U.S. government in similar
circumstances," Ehrlich concluded.
Panofsky took note of another
environmental factor, pointing out that
the extensive construction at the test
site has already had substantial impact
on the environmental. "I feel that some
of the environmental questions are
already somewhat too late," he said.
Earthquakes
Thompson, who has studied the
possibility of underground atomic
blasts triggering earthquakes, said that
"a very careful analysis of the things
involved in triggering an earthquake
suggests that the possibility of a large
damaging quake is very remote. Any
kind of disturbance like this sets off
small quakes."
Asked if he thought the test should
be cancelled, Thompson said, "I don't
know. One must weigh a lot of things
to see if it is advisable." He named
the problem of radiation leakage, as one
which would have to be considered in
making that decision.

WRAP-UP—During final arguments in the Franklin case, administration attorney Raymond Fisher argues that "the university
cannot tolerate" Professor H. Bruce Franklin. Seated with him are lawyer Charles Rosenberg and Pres. Lyman's legal adviser,
James Siena. Franklin will summarize his case in today's final session of the unprecedented hearing.
"The decision is just dumb, but that
should come as no surprise to people
who have watched the behavior of the
U.S. government in similar
circumstances," Ehrlich concluded.
Panofsky took note of another
environmental factor, pointing out that
the extensive construction at the test
site has already had substantial impact
on the environmental. "I feel that some
of the environmental questions are
already somewhat too late," he said.
Earthquakes
Thompson, who has studied the
possibility of underground atomic
blasts triggering earthquakes, said that
"a very careful analysis of the things
involved in triggering an earthquake
suggests that the possibility of a large
damaging quake is very remote. Any
kind of disturbance like this sets off
small quakes."
Asked if he thought the test should
be cancelled, Thompson said, "I don't
know. One must weigh a lot of things
to see if it is advisable." He named
the problem of radiation leakage, as one
which would have to be considered in
making that decision.

As reported in yesterday's Daily,
Russell E. Train, President Nixon's top
environmental adviser, had opposed the
test because of the possibility of
earthquakes, in a secret memorandum
last December. The document was
made public Wednesday.
Three noted Stanford professors have expressed
opposition to the huge underground nuclear test
scheduled to take place at Amchitkp in the Aleutian
Islands tomorrow.
Nuclear physicist Wolfgang Panofsky, Director of
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, opposes it
because of his objection to the long-range Spartan
anti-ballistic missile (ABM) system which the blast is
to test.
Noted population biologist Paul Ehrlich has
branded the test "environmental roulette, ' noting the
chance of major ecological disaster.
Sidney D. Drell, Deputy Director of SLAC, agrees
with Panofsky's characterization of the blast as
unnecessary.
Another professor, George A. Thompson,
Chairman of the Geophysics Department, took no
position on the advisability of the blast but did say
the possibility of a major damaging earthquake was
"very remote."
No Real Purpose
Panofsky, quoted in Wednesday's New York
Times, said "the test has no real military purpose and
is being held because of technological inertia. The
people who design bombs just don't want to stop
before they have the final design. They've had their
plans going for a long time.
"The issue is whether man controls technology or
technology controls man," he said.
He told the Daily, "If we do want to protect our
Minuteman missiles (the mission of ABM), it would

be much better to use a short-range missile defense,
which doesn't involve as big a bomb.
"The Spartan system is hazardous and ineffective,
and it would not be able to differentiate between
decoys and incoming missiles. It would have to be
launched before we knew what we were shooting at.
"The environmental arguments against the test
have had most of the publicity; there's been much
too little publicity on what they're testing it for," he
added.
Panofsky expressed the view that the test would
have very little effect on the U.S.-Soviet strategic
arms limitation talks (SALT). "Even if the SALT
talks limit the ABM somewhat, we may still retain a
small amount of ABM and this will test part of that
system," he explained.
"Furthermore, the Russians have set off two very
large underground blasts in the last month, which has
made it very hard to argue against this test."
Drell pointed out that the ABM was originally
conceived as a "thin city defense. The large-scale test
of the Spartan warhead was a necessity. But Congress
has cut the ABM program back to the protection of
Minuteman silos only, rendering the Spartan "totally
useless, to my judgment," according to Drell.
Discussing the SALT talks, Drell said that "either
we should cancel the test completely or else set it off
and get it over with. To hold it in abeyance would
just mean having it in the background, possibly
interfering with future stages of the talks." He
pointed out that the possibility of the big blast might
hinder progress on negotiation of a nuclear test ban

treaty prohibiting underground detonations.
"I, of course, would prefer that it be cancelled,"
Drell said.
Stupid Decision
Ehrlich, nationally known for his environmental
concerns, said that "President Nixon should be held
personally responsible for a stupid decision" in
allowing the blast to go ahead.
"Although the probability of disaster is small,"
Ehrlich said, "it's not a risk we ought to be taking.
Even if nothing happens, people shouldn't decide that
it was an intelligent decision.
"It's like Russian roulette. If you hold a pistol to
your head and pull the trigger, even if you live
through it that doesn't make it a smart thing to do,"
he pointed out.
"The risk of calamity is small, but if a small risk is
taken often enough there will be a major disaster
sooner or later."

which doesn't involve as big a bomb.
"The Spartan system is hazardous and ineffective,
and it would not be able to differentiate between
decoys and incoming missiles. It would have to be
launched before we knew what we were shooting at.
"The environmental arguments against the test
have had most of the publicity; there's been much
too little publicity on what they're testing it for," he
added.
Panofsky expressed the view that the test would
have very little effect on the U.S.-Soviet strategic
arms limitation talks (SALT). "Even if the SALT
talks limit the ABM somewhat, we may still retain a
small amount of ABM and this will test part of that
system," he explained.
"Furthermore, the Russians have set off two very
large underground blasts in the last month, which has
made it very hard to argue against this test."
Drell pointed out that the ABM was originally
conceived as a "thin city defense. The large-scale test
of the Spartan warhead was a necessity. But Congress
has cut the ABM program back to the protection of
Minuteman silos only, rendering the Spartan "totally
useless, to my judgment," according to Drell.
Discussing the SALT talks, Drell said that "either
we should cancel the test completely or else set it off
and get it over with. To hold it in abeyance would
just mean having it in the background, possibly
interfering with future stages of the talks." He
pointed out that the possibility of the big blast might
hinder progress on negotiation of a nuclear test ban

treaty prohibiting underground detonations.
"I, of course, would prefer that it be cancelled,"
Drell said.
Stupid Decision
Ehrlich, nationally known for his environmental
concerns, said that "President Nixon should be held
personally responsible for a stupid decision" in
allowing the blast to go ahead.
"Although the probability of disaster is small,"
Ehrlich said, "it's not a risk we ought to be taking.
Even if nothing happens, people shouldn't decide that
it was an intelligent decision.
"It's like Russian roulette. If you hold a pistol to
your head and pull the trigger, even if you live
through it that doesn't make it a smart thing to do,"
he pointed out.
"The risk of calamity is small, but if a small risk is
taken often enough there will be a major disaster
sooner or later."
The principal ecological danger is that of venting,
the leakage of radiation. "If that happens, most of
the fallout will be in areas with very short food chains
and a very fragile ecosystem," Ehrlich pointed out.
Alaska was rocked by a major earthquake in 1964 ,
and there is also a possibility that the blast could set
off a huge tremor and accompanying tidal wave.
"What makes it doubly preposterous to take these
risks," he added, "is that it is to test a warhead for
the ABM system which is a great danger to the
security of this country.

WRAP-UP—During final arguments in the Franklin case, administration attorney Raymond Fisher argues that "the university
cannot tolerate" Professor H. Bruce Franklin. Seated with him are lawyer Charles Rosenberg and Pres. Lyman's legal adviser,
James Siena. Franklin will summarize his case in today's final session of the unprecedented hearing.
"The decision is just dumb, but that
should come as no surprise to people
who have watched the behavior of the
U.S. government in similar
circumstances," Ehrlich concluded.
Panofsky took note of another
environmental factor, pointing out that
the extensive construction at the test
site has already had substantial impact
on the environmental. "I feel that some
of the environmental questions are
already somewhat too late," he said.
Earthquakes
Thompson, who has studied the
possibility of underground atomic
blasts triggering earthquakes, said that
"a very careful analysis of the things
involved in triggering an earthquake
suggests that the possibility of a large
damaging quake is very remote. Any
kind of disturbance like this sets off
small quakes."
Asked if he thought the test should
be cancelled, Thompson said, "I don't
know. One must weigh a lot of things
to see if it is advisable." He named
the problem of radiation leakage, as one
which would have to be considered in
making that decision.

As reported in yesterday's Daily,
Russell E. Train, President Nixon's top
environmental adviser, had opposed the
test because of the possibility of
earthquakes, in a secret memorandum
last December. The document was
made public Wednesday.
Three noted Stanford professors have expressed
opposition to the huge underground nuclear test
scheduled to take place at Amchitkp in the Aleutian
Islands tomorrow.
Nuclear physicist Wolfgang Panofsky, Director of
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, opposes it
because of his objection to the long-range Spartan
anti-ballistic missile (ABM) system which the blast is
to test.
Noted population biologist Paul Ehrlich has
branded the test "environmental roulette, ' noting the
chance of major ecological disaster.
Sidney D. Drell, Deputy Director of SLAC, agrees
with Panofsky's characterization of the blast as
unnecessary.
Another professor, George A. Thompson,
Chairman of the Geophysics Department, took no
position on the advisability of the blast but did say
the possibility of a major damaging earthquake was
"very remote."
No Real Purpose
Panofsky, quoted in Wednesday's New York
Times, said "the test has no real military purpose and
is being held because of technological inertia. The
people who design bombs just don't want to stop
before they have the final design. They've had their
plans going for a long time.
"The issue is whether man controls technology or
technology controls man," he said.
He told the Daily, "If we do want to protect our
Minuteman missiles (the mission of ABM), it would

be much better to use a short-range missile defense,
which doesn't involve as big a bomb.
"The Spartan system is hazardous and ineffective,
