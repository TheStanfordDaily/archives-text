# Politics Of American Foreign Aid
## 
### 
First Of Two Parts
On October 29, the U.S.
Senate rejected, 41 to 27, the
Nixon administration's foreign aid
bill.
If passed, the bill would have
approved taking $3.3 billion in
taxpayers' money and parcelling it
out as economic and military aid
during fiscal year 1 97 1 -72.
Senator Hdward Kennedy
(D-Mass.), who did not vote, but
was paired for the bill, said
afterwards that the coalition that
defeated the bill had included
conservatives angered at the
expulsion of Chiang Kai-shek's
Nationalist government from the
United Nations organization,
Vietnam war doves, isolationists,
and budget cutters.
Senator Frank Church
(D-ldaho), who voted against the
bill, said afterwards that the
rejection of the foreign aid bill
was "the most cleansing, cathartic
happening to occur on Capitol
Hill in many a year."
Church said, "The present
foreign aid program has been
turned into a grotesque money
tree, sheltering the foreign
investments of our biggest
corporations and furnishing aid
and comfort to repressive
governments all over the world."
Senator J.W. Fulbright
(D-Ark.), chairman of the Senate
foreign relations committee, was
one of those who voted against
the bill.
Appearing on October 31, on
the CBS television program, "Face

the Nation," Fulbright termed
present-day foreign aid a form of
"welfare imperialism" and said,
"The really controversial things
(in the Senate) are the use of this
program for part of the military
domination of other countries."
However, Fulbright is clearly
not opposed to foreign aid per se,
for he went on to speak proudly
of his support for the recent
passage in the Senate of a
$2-billion appropriation for

"multilateral" aid through
international organizations—as
distinct from direct aid, which
Fulbright largely opposes.
Fulbright said: "The true
internationalist is the one . . . who
supports things like the United
Nations or the International
Bank."
So it appears that foreign aid is
not dead yet. Two component
parts of the voting coalition which
came together on October 29 to
defeat the foreign aid bill are
likely to desert the ranks: the
Cold War conservative allies of
Chiang Kai-shek and the Vietnam
war doves. This leaves only the
isolationists and the watchdogs of
government spending still
protecting the taxpaying
American citizenry from being
bled white by more money for
foreign aid.
Representative of the
isolationist viewpoint on foreign
aid is an article that former
Nebraska Congressman Howard
Buffett wrote on the subject in
Human Events in 1 955. He spoke
of the "foreign aid levy against
our earnings" and called it "a
multi-billion dollar pork barrel"
and "a permanent gravy train" for
which the American taxpayers
"must pay and pay."
Buffett said, "Foreign aid
consists of compulsory taking of
the earnings and resources of
taxpayers by political officials for
purposes over which the American
people have no effective say-so."
He concluded by saying, "Big
business, big labor, and big
government all find international
spending to their liking. Certainly
no one can deny that the
giveaways have augmented the
power of each member of this
triumvirate."
(About $143 billion has gone
into foreign aid since the Marshall
Plan was adopted at the beginning
of the Cold War.)
The conservatives who resented
Chiang's treatment in the UN vote
may well go over to the Nixon
administration's long-term reform
plan for the foreign aid program.
They are unlikely to support
abolition of foreign aid entirely.
This Nixon reform plan for

foreign aid was proposed last
April and was based on the
recommendation of a White
House task force headed by
Rudolph Peterson, former
president of the Bank of America.
As the October 31 New York
Times put it, "At the heart of the
suggested reforms was the
President's recommendation that
the United States gradually end its
government-to-government loans
and instead channel aid through

organizations such as the World
Bank."
So despite their apparent
differences, President Nixon and
Senator Fulbright (and the other
liberals) want the same programs.
Both groups like the World
Bank, headed by technocrat
Robert McNamara since April
1968.
This is not to say that Nixon
and Fulbright agree on military
aid appropriations. Clearly, except
on the desirability of aiding
Israel's war against the Palestinian
peasantry, they are in
disagreement.
Also certain conservatives are
bound to grumble that, if
"economic development" aid is
channelled through international
organizations (without
Congressional supervision), there
would be no sure guarantee that
certain American interests and
regions which previously
benefited from foreign aid would
continue to do so.
An examination of the role of
U.S. foreign aid in the past shows
that it has been, as Leonard Liggio
once said, "the vanguard of
American imperialism."
In The Roots of American
Foreign Policy, Gabriel Kolko
writes:
"The United States is the
world's leading state
trader.... Official American
agricultural export subsidy
programs involved $3 billion
annually in 1957 and 1967, with
sums approaching that amount in
the interim years. Most of these
subsidized exports went to
developing nations, often, as in
the case of India, in return for
vital concessions that aided
America's industry, just as
agricultural exports aided
(America's) big commercial
farmers."
Since the economic
development grants and loans
from the U.S. government
(ultimately from the American
taxpayer) have often been tied to
a requirement that the money be
spent on American goods, these
are also subsidies to American
corporations.
Why did liberals like Fulbright

go along with such a program in
the beginning and why do they
want to reform it now?
Before we can correctly answer
this question, we must deal with a
problem of historical
methodology. In much radical
analysis of historical events, one
observes that radicals distrust
everything the members of the
power elite say, except that
suddenly when members of the
power elite say that they need
expanding foreign markets or
some such thing, radicals often
believe them absolutely. The
correct approach is to subject
everything the ruling caste says to
scrutiny based on distrust.
Thus, one finds the following
in Bruce Nissen's fascinating
article on the World Bank in the
October-November 1971 issue of
the radical Pacific Studies Center
Telegram: "America's economy
after the war required such
policies. The testimony of U.S.
officials and experts on this point
was virtually unanimous. A
surplus-ridden American economy
after the war would require huge
markets abroad if it was to avoid
stagnation and depression." This
is followed by quotations from
Dean Acheson, Cordell Hull,
Francis Sayre, and William
Clayton which show conclusively
that these influential men believed
in a need for expanding markets.
Similarly, Hector Melo and
Israel Yost's introductory article
on foreign aid in the April 197 0
Newsletter of the radical North

American Congress on Latin
America begins with the following
sentence: "Over the last 40 years,
the survival of capitalism has
rested on its ability to expand its
control over resources and
markets on a global scale."
There is an alternative
methodology which focuses on
the fact that men make history
and that their ideas have
consequences.
As R.A. Childs, Jr. puts it
in his essay, "Big Business and the
Rise of American Statism": "An
economic system is not an entity,
holds no ideas, takes no actions,
in short, is not the metaphysical
kind of entity which can have
needs. If a man needs something
and does not know it, he will not
act to attain it. If he does not
need something but thinks that he
does, he will act to attain it. The
same is true for a set of individual
people and their values, which is
all that an economic or political
system is ...
"If industrialists ... think that
war and conquest are necessary
for their continued prosperity,
then the odds are that they will
act in a manner that supports war
and conquest. History is hardly a
record of the actions of men
whose ideas were all true. Thus I
would not argue in this essay that
capitalism needed government
controls or anything else of that
form. I argue only that major
industrialists in American history
held certain ideas and ends and
adopted certain means to attain
them."

In a subsequent essay, "How
bad is the U.S. government?"
Childs writes: "Influential
businessmen accepted the idea
that without (foreign expansion),
the U.S. was doomed to suffer
from ever-increasing depressions
and industrial crimes.... Big
businessmen turned to using the
U.S. military and its diplomatic
channels to insure ever-expanding
markets for their goods.
"This resulted in the
Spanish-American war, in
confrontations with Japan and

China, and the like. It led,
ultimately, to the American entry
into World War I and 11, and it is
an important motive in the
initiation of the Cold War."
(Nonetheless, the fact that big
businessmen believe a certain
theory of what causes and cures
depressions does not make that
theory correct. They will
probably act upon their theory.
But their theory may still be
mistaken, and I believe it is.)

our earnings" and called it "a
multi-billion dollar pork barrel"
and "a permanent gravy train" for
which the American taxpayers
"must pay and pay."
Buffett said, "Foreign aid
consists of compulsory taking of
the earnings and resources of
taxpayers by political officials for
purposes over which the American
people have no effective say-so."
He concluded by saying, "Big
business, big labor, and big
government all find international
spending to their liking. Certainly
no one can deny that the
giveaways have augmented the
power of each member of this
triumvirate."
(About $143 billion has gone
into foreign aid since the Marshall
Plan was adopted at the beginning
of the Cold War.)
The conservatives who resented
Chiang's treatment in the UN vote
may well go over to the Nixon
administration's long-term reform
plan for the foreign aid program.
They are unlikely to support
abolition of foreign aid entirely.
This Nixon reform plan for

foreign aid was proposed last
April and was based on the
recommendation of a White
House task force headed by
Rudolph Peterson, former
president of the Bank of America.
As the October 31 New York
Times put it, "At the heart of the
suggested reforms was the
President's recommendation that
the United States gradually end its
government-to-government loans
and instead channel aid through

organizations such as the World
Bank."
So despite their apparent
differences, President Nixon and
Senator Fulbright (and the other
liberals) want the same programs.
Both groups like the World
Bank, headed by technocrat
Robert McNamara since April
1968.
This is not to say that Nixon
and Fulbright agree on military
aid appropriations. Clearly, except
on the desirability of aiding
Israel's war against the Palestinian
peasantry, they are in
disagreement.
Also certain conservatives are
bound to grumble that, if
"economic development" aid is
channelled through international
organizations (without
Congressional supervision), there
would be no sure guarantee that
certain American interests and
regions which previously
benefited from foreign aid would
continue to do so.
An examination of the role of
U.S. foreign aid in the past shows
that it has been, as Leonard Liggio
once said, "the vanguard of
American imperialism."
In The Roots of American
Foreign Policy, Gabriel Kolko
writes:
"The United States is the
world's leading state
trader.... Official American
agricultural export subsidy
programs involved $3 billion
annually in 1957 and 1967, with
sums approaching that amount in
the interim years. Most of these
subsidized exports went to
developing nations, often, as in
the case of India, in return for
vital concessions that aided
America's industry, just as
agricultural exports aided
(America's) big commercial
farmers."
Since the economic
development grants and loans
from the U.S. government
(ultimately from the American
taxpayer) have often been tied to
a requirement that the money be
spent on American goods, these
are also subsidies to American
corporations.
Why did liberals like Fulbright

go along with such a program in
the beginning and why do they
want to reform it now?
Before we can correctly answer
this question, we must deal with a
problem of historical
methodology. In much radical
analysis of historical events, one
observes that radicals distrust
everything the members of the
power elite say, except that
suddenly when members of the
power elite say that they need
expanding foreign markets or
some such thing, radicals often
believe them absolutely. The
correct approach is to subject
everything the ruling caste says to
scrutiny based on distrust.
Thus, one finds the following
in Bruce Nissen's fascinating
article on the World Bank in the
October-November 1971 issue of
the radical Pacific Studies Center
Telegram: "America's economy
after the war required such
policies. The testimony of U.S.
officials and experts on this point
was virtually unanimous. A
surplus-ridden American economy
after the war would require huge
markets abroad if it was to avoid
stagnation and depression." This
is followed by quotations from
Dean Acheson, Cordell Hull,
Francis Sayre, and William
Clayton which show conclusively
that these influential men believed
in a need for expanding markets.
Similarly, Hector Melo and
Israel Yost's introductory article
on foreign aid in the April 197 0
Newsletter of the radical North

American Congress on Latin
America begins with the following
sentence: "Over the last 40 years,
the survival of capitalism has
rested on its ability to expand its
control over resources and
markets on a global scale."
There is an alternative
methodology which focuses on
the fact that men make history
and that their ideas have
consequences.
As R.A. Childs, Jr. puts it
in his essay, "Big Business and the
Rise of American Statism": "An
economic system is not an entity,
holds no ideas, takes no actions,
in short, is not the metaphysical
kind of entity which can have
needs. If a man needs something
and does not know it, he will not
act to attain it. If he does not
need something but thinks that he
does, he will act to attain it. The
same is true for a set of individual
people and their values, which is
all that an economic or political
system is ...
"If industrialists ... think that
war and conquest are necessary
for their continued prosperity,
then the odds are that they will
act in a manner that supports war
and conquest. History is hardly a
record of the actions of men
whose ideas were all true. Thus I
would not argue in this essay that
capitalism needed government
controls or anything else of that
form. I argue only that major
industrialists in American history
held certain ideas and ends and
adopted certain means to attain
them."

In a subsequent essay, "How
bad is the U.S. government?"
Childs writes: "Influential
businessmen accepted the idea
that without (foreign expansion),
the U.S. was doomed to suffer
from ever-increasing depressions
and industrial crimes.... Big
businessmen turned to using the
U.S. military and its diplomatic
channels to insure ever-expanding
markets for their goods.
"This resulted in the
Spanish-American war, in
confrontations with Japan and

China, and the like. It led,
ultimately, to the American entry
into World War I and 11, and it is
an important motive in the
initiation of the Cold War."
(Nonetheless, the fact that big
businessmen believe a certain
theory of what causes and cures
depressions does not make that
theory correct. They will
probably act upon their theory.
But their theory may still be
mistaken, and I believe it is.)
Next: Why liberals support
foreign aid reform.


"Small World, isn't it?"
First Of Two Parts
On October 29, the U.S.
Senate rejected, 41 to 27, the
Nixon administration's foreign aid
bill.
If passed, the bill would have
approved taking $3.3 billion in
taxpayers' money and parcelling it
out as economic and military aid
during fiscal year 1 97 1 -72.
Senator Hdward Kennedy
(D-Mass.), who did not vote, but
was paired for the bill, said
afterwards that the coalition that
defeated the bill had included
conservatives angered at the
expulsion of Chiang Kai-shek's
Nationalist government from the
United Nations organization,
Vietnam war doves, isolationists,
and budget cutters.
Senator Frank Church
(D-ldaho), who voted against the
bill, said afterwards that the
rejection of the foreign aid bill
was "the most cleansing, cathartic
happening to occur on Capitol
Hill in many a year."
Church said, "The present
foreign aid program has been
turned into a grotesque money
tree, sheltering the foreign
investments of our biggest
corporations and furnishing aid
and comfort to repressive
governments all over the world."
Senator J.W. Fulbright
(D-Ark.), chairman of the Senate
foreign relations committee, was
one of those who voted against
the bill.
Appearing on October 31, on
the CBS television program, "Face

the Nation," Fulbright termed
present-day foreign aid a form of
"welfare imperialism" and said,
"The really controversial things
(in the Senate) are the use of this
program for part of the military
domination of other countries."
However, Fulbright is clearly
not opposed to foreign aid per se,
for he went on to speak proudly
of his support for the recent
passage in the Senate of a
$2-billion appropriation for

"multilateral" aid through
international organizations—as
distinct from direct aid, which
Fulbright largely opposes.
Fulbright said: "The true
internationalist is the one . . . who
supports things like the United
Nations or the International
Bank."
So it appears that foreign aid is
not dead yet. Two component
parts of the voting coalition which
came together on October 29 to
defeat the foreign aid bill are
likely to desert the ranks: the
Cold War conservative allies of
Chiang Kai-shek and the Vietnam
war doves. This leaves only the
isolationists and the watchdogs of
government spending still
protecting the taxpaying
American citizenry from being
bled white by more money for
foreign aid.
Representative of the
isolationist viewpoint on foreign
aid is an article that former
Nebraska Congressman Howard
Buffett wrote on the subject in
Human Events in 1 955. He spoke

America's industry, just as
agricultural exports aided
(America's) big commercial
farmers."
Since the economic
development grants and loans
from the U.S. government
(ultimately from the American
taxpayer) have often been tied to
a requirement that the money be
spent on American goods, these
are also subsidies to American
corporations.
Why did liberals like Fulbright

go along with such a program in
the beginning and why do they
want to reform it now?
Before we can correctly answer
this question, we must deal with a
problem of historical
methodology. In much radical
analysis of historical events, one
observes that radicals distrust
everything the members of the
power elite say, except that
suddenly when members of the
power elite say that they need
expanding foreign markets or
some such thing, radicals often
believe them absolutely. The
correct approach is to subject
everything the ruling caste says to
scrutiny based on distrust.
Thus, one finds the following
in Bruce Nissen's fascinating
article on the World Bank in the
October-November 1971 issue of
the radical Pacific Studies Center
Telegram: "America's economy
after the war required such
policies. The testimony of U.S.
officials and experts on this point
was virtually unanimous. A
surplus-ridden American economy
after the war would require huge
markets abroad if it was to avoid
stagnation and depression." This
is followed by quotations from
Dean Acheson, Cordell Hull,
Francis Sayre, and William
Clayton which show conclusively
that these influential men believed
in a need for expanding markets.
Similarly, Hector Melo and
Israel Yost's introductory article
on foreign aid in the April 197 0
Newsletter of the radical North

American Congress on Latin
America begins with the following
sentence: "Over the last 40 years,
the survival of capitalism has
rested on its ability to expand its
control over resources and
markets on a global scale."
There is an alternative
methodology which focuses on
the fact that men make history
and that their ideas have
consequences.
As R.A. Childs, Jr. puts it
in his essay, "Big Business and the
Rise of American Statism": "An
economic system is not an entity,
holds no ideas, takes no actions,
in short, is not the metaphysical
kind of entity which can have
needs. If a man needs something
and does not know it, he will not
act to attain it. If he does not
need something but thinks that he
does, he will act to attain it. The
same is true for a set of individual
people and their values, which is
all that an economic or political
system is ...
"If industrialists ... think that
war and conquest are necessary
for their continued prosperity,
then the odds are that they will
act in a manner that supports war
and conquest. History is hardly a
record of the actions of men
whose ideas were all true. Thus I
would not argue in this essay that
capitalism needed government
controls or anything else of that
form. I argue only that major
industrialists in American history
held certain ideas and ends and
adopted certain means to attain
them."

In a subsequent essay, "How
bad is the U.S. government?"
Childs writes: "Influential
businessmen accepted the idea
that without (foreign expansion),
the U.S. was doomed to suffer
from ever-increasing depressions
and industrial crimes.... Big
businessmen turned to using the
U.S. military and its diplomatic
channels to insure ever-expanding
markets for their goods.
"This resulted in the
Spanish-American war, in
confrontations with Japan and

China, and the like. It led,
ultimately, to the American entry
into World War I and 11, and it is
an important motive in the
initiation of the Cold War."
(Nonetheless, the fact that big
businessmen believe a certain
theory of what causes and cures
depressions does not make that
theory correct. They will
probably act upon their theory.
But their theory may still be
mistaken, and I believe it is.)
Next: Why liberals support
foreign aid reform.


"Small World, isn't it?"
First Of Two Parts
On October 29, the U.S.
Senate rejected, 41 to 27, the
Nixon administration's foreign aid
bill.
If passed, the bill would have
approved taking $3.3 billion in
taxpayers' money and parcelling it
out as economic and military aid
during fiscal year 1 97 1 -72.
Senator Hdward Kennedy
(D-Mass.), who did not vote, but
was paired for the bill, said
afterwards that the coalition that
defeated the bill had included
conservatives angered at the
expulsion of Chiang Kai-shek's
Nationalist government from the
United Nations organization,
Vietnam war doves, isolationists,
and budget cutters.
Senator Frank Church
(D-ldaho), who voted against the
bill, said afterwards that the
rejection of the foreign aid bill
was "the most cleansing, cathartic
happening to occur on Capitol
Hill in many a year."
Church said, "The present
foreign aid program has been
turned into a grotesque money
tree, sheltering the foreign
investments of our biggest
corporations and furnishing aid
and comfort to repressive
governments all over the world."
Senator J.W. Fulbright
(D-Ark.), chairman of the Senate
foreign relations committee, was
one of those who voted against
the bill.
Appearing on October 31, on
the CBS television program, "Face

the Nation," Fulbright termed
present-day foreign aid a form of
"welfare imperialism" and said,
"The really controversial things
(in the Senate) are the use of this
program for part of the military
domination of other countries."
However, Fulbright is clearly
not opposed to foreign aid per se,
for he went on to speak proudly
of his support for the recent
passage in the Senate of a
$2-billion appropriation for

New* in Review

ByJStU £vers

"multilateral" aid through
international organizations—as
distinct from direct aid, which
Fulbright largely opposes.
Fulbright said: "The true
internationalist is the one . . . who
supports things like the United
Nations or the International
Bank."
So it appears that foreign aid is
not dead yet. Two component
parts of the voting coalition which
came together on October 29 to
defeat the foreign aid bill are
likely to desert the ranks: the
Cold War conservative allies of
Chiang Kai-shek and the Vietnam
war doves. This leaves only the
isolationists and the watchdogs of
government spending still
protecting the taxpaying
American citizenry from being
bled white by more money for
foreign aid.
Representative of the
isolationist viewpoint on foreign
aid is an article that former
Nebraska Congressman Howard
Buffett wrote on the subject in
Human Events in 1 955. He spoke
of the "foreign aid levy against
our earnings" and called it "a
multi-billion dollar pork barrel"
and "a permanent gravy train" for
which the American taxpayers
"must pay and pay."
Buffett said, "Foreign aid
consists of compulsory taking of
the earnings and resources of
taxpayers by political officials for
purposes over which the American
people have no effective say-so."
He concluded by saying, "Big
business, big labor, and big
government all find international
spending to their liking. Certainly
no one can deny that the
giveaways have augmented the
power of each member of this
triumvirate."
(About $143 billion has gone
into foreign aid since the Marshall
Plan was adopted at the beginning
of the Cold War.)
The conservatives who resented
Chiang's treatment in the UN vote
may well go over to the Nixon
administration's long-term reform
plan for the foreign aid program.
They are unlikely to support
abolition of foreign aid entirely.
This Nixon reform plan for

foreign aid was proposed last
April and was based on the
recommendation of a White
House task force headed by
Rudolph Peterson, former
president of the Bank of America.
As the October 31 New York
Times put it, "At the heart of the
suggested reforms was the
President's recommendation that
the United States gradually end its
government-to-government loans
and instead channel aid through

organizations such as the World
Bank."
So despite their apparent
differences, President Nixon and
Senator Fulbright (and the other
liberals) want the same programs.
Both groups like the World
Bank, headed by technocrat
Robert McNamara since April
1968.
This is not to say that Nixon
and Fulbright agree on military
aid appropriations. Clearly, except
on the desirability of aiding
Israel's war against the Palestinian
peasantry, they are in
disagreement.
Also certain conservatives are
bound to grumble that, if
"economic development" aid is
channelled through international
organizations (without
Congressional supervision), there
would be no sure guarantee that
certain American interests and
regions which previously
benefited from foreign aid would
continue to do so.
An examination of the role of
U.S. foreign aid in the past shows
that it has been, as Leonard Liggio
once said, "the vanguard of
American imperialism."
In The Roots of American
Foreign Policy, Gabriel Kolko
writes:
"The United States is the
world's leading state
trader.... Official American
agricultural export subsidy
programs involved $3 billion
annually in 1957 and 1967, with
sums approaching that amount in
the interim years. Most of these
subsidized exports went to
developing nations, often, as in
the case of India, in return for
vital concessions that aided
America's industry, just as
agricultural exports aided
(America's) big commercial
farmers."
Since the economic
development grants and loans
from the U.S. government
(ultimately from the American

are also subsidies to American

act in a manner that supports war
and conquest. History is hardly a
record of the actions of men
whose ideas were all true. Thus I
would not argue in this essay that
capitalism needed government
controls or anything else of that
form. I argue only that major
industrialists in American history
held certain ideas and ends and
adopted certain means to attain
them."

In a subsequent essay, "How
bad is the U.S. government?"
Childs writes: "Influential
businessmen accepted the idea
that without (foreign expansion),
the U.S. was doomed to suffer
from ever-increasing depressions
and industrial crimes.... Big
businessmen turned to using the
U.S. military and its diplomatic
channels to insure ever-expanding
markets for their goods.
"This resulted in the
Spanish-American war, in
confrontations with Japan and

China, and the like. It led,
ultimately, to the American entry
into World War I and 11, and it is
an important motive in the
initiation of the Cold War."
(Nonetheless, the fact that big
businessmen believe a certain
theory of what causes and cures
depressions does not make that
theory correct. They will
probably act upon their theory.
But their theory may still be
mistaken, and I believe it is.)
Next: Why liberals support
foreign aid reform.


"Small World, isn't it?"
First Of Two Parts
On October 29, the U.S.
Senate rejected, 41 to 27, the
Nixon administration's foreign aid
bill.
If passed, the bill would have
approved taking $3.3 billion in
taxpayers' money and parcelling it
out as economic and military aid
during fiscal year 1 97 1 -72.
Senator Hdward Kennedy
(D-Mass.), who did not vote, but
was paired for the bill, said
afterwards that the coalition that
defeated the bill had included
conservatives angered at the
expulsion of Chiang Kai-shek's
Nationalist government from the
United Nations organization,
Vietnam war doves, isolationists,
and budget cutters.
Senator Frank Church
(D-ldaho), who voted against the
bill, said afterwards that the
rejection of the foreign aid bill
was "the most cleansing, cathartic
happening to occur on Capitol
Hill in many a year."
Church said, "The present
foreign aid program has been
turned into a grotesque money
tree, sheltering the foreign
investments of our biggest
corporations and furnishing aid
and comfort to repressive
governments all over the world."
Senator J.W. Fulbright
(D-Ark.), chairman of the Senate
foreign relations committee, was
one of those who voted against
the bill.
Appearing on October 31, on
the CBS television program, "Face

the Nation," Fulbright termed
present-day foreign aid a form of
"welfare imperialism" and said,
"The really controversial things
(in the Senate) are the use of this
program for part of the military
domination of other countries."
However, Fulbright is clearly
not opposed to foreign aid per se,
for he went on to speak proudly
of his support for the recent
passage in the Senate of a
$2-billion appropriation for

New* in Review

"multilateral" aid through
international organizations—as
distinct from direct aid, which
Fulbright largely opposes.
Fulbright said: "The true
internationalist is the one . . . who
supports things like the United
Nations or the International
Bank."
So it appears that foreign aid is
not dead yet. Two component
parts of the voting coalition which
came together on October 29 to
defeat the foreign aid bill are
likely to desert the ranks: the
Cold War conservative allies of
Chiang Kai-shek and the Vietnam
war doves. This leaves only the
isolationists and the watchdogs of
government spending still
protecting the taxpaying
American citizenry from being
bled white by more money for
foreign aid.
Representative of the
isolationist viewpoint on foreign
aid is an article that former
Nebraska Congressman Howard
Buffett wrote on the subject in
Human Events in 1 955. He spoke
of the "foreign aid levy against
our earnings" and called it "a
multi-billion dollar pork barrel"
and "a permanent gravy train" for
which the American taxpayers
"must pay and pay."
Buffett said, "Foreign aid
consists of compulsory taking of
the earnings and resources of
taxpayers by political officials for
purposes over which the American
people have no effective say-so."
He concluded by saying, "Big
business, big labor, and big
government all find international
spending to their liking. Certainly
no one can deny that the
giveaways have augmented the
power of each member of this
triumvirate."
(About $143 billion has gone
into foreign aid since the Marshall
Plan was adopted at the beginning
of the Cold War.)
The conservatives who resented
Chiang's treatment in the UN vote
may well go over to the Nixon
administration's long-term reform
plan for the foreign aid program.
They are unlikely to support
abolition of foreign aid entirely.
This Nixon reform plan for

foreign aid was proposed last
April and was based on the
recommendation of a White
House task force headed by
Rudolph Peterson, former
president of the Bank of America.
As the October 31 New York
Times put it, "At the heart of the
suggested reforms was the
President's recommendation that
the United States gradually end its
government-to-government loans
and instead channel aid through

organizations such as the World
Bank."
So despite their apparent
differences, President Nixon and
Senator Fulbright (and the other
liberals) want the same programs.
Both groups like the World
Bank, headed by technocrat
Robert McNamara since April
1968.
This is not to say that Nixon
and Fulbright agree on military
aid appropriations. Clearly, except
on the desirability of aiding
Israel's war against the Palestinian
peasantry, they are in
disagreement.
Also certain conservatives are
bound to grumble that, if
"economic development" aid is
channelled through international
organizations (without
Congressional supervision), there
would be no sure guarantee that
certain American interests and
regions which previously
benefited from foreign aid would
continue to do so.
An examination of the role of
U.S. foreign aid in the past shows
that it has been, as Leonard Liggio
once said, "the vanguard of
American imperialism."
In The Roots of American
Foreign Policy, Gabriel Kolko
writes:
"The United States is the
world's leading state
trader.... Official American
agricultural export subsidy
programs involved $3 billion
annually in 1957 and 1967, with
sums approaching that amount in
the interim years. Most of these
subsidized exports went to
developing nations, often, as in
the case of India, in return for
vital concessions that aided
America's industry, just as
agricultural exports aided
(America's) big commercial
farmers."
Since the economic
development grants and loans
from the U.S. government
(ultimately from the American
taxpayer) have often been tied to
a requirement that the money be
spent on American goods, these
are also subsidies to American
corporations.
Why did liberals like Fulbright

go along with such a program in
the beginning and why do they
want to reform it now?
Before we can correctly answer
this question, we must deal with a
problem of historical
methodology. In much radical
analysis of historical events, one
observes that radicals distrust
everything the members of the
power elite say, except that
suddenly when members of the
power elite say that they need
expanding foreign markets or
some such thing, radicals often
believe them absolutely. The
correct approach is to subject
everything the ruling caste says to
scrutiny based on distrust.
Thus, one finds the following
in Bruce Nissen's fascinating
article on the World Bank in the
October-November 1971 issue of
the radical Pacific Studies Center
Telegram: "America's economy
after the war required such
policies. The testimony of U.S.
officials and experts on this point
was virtually unanimous. A
surplus-ridden American economy
after the war would require huge
markets abroad if it was to avoid
stagnation and depression." This
is followed by quotations from
Dean Acheson, Cordell Hull,
Francis Sayre, and William
Clayton which show conclusively
that these influential men believed
in a need for expanding markets.
Similarly, Hector Melo and
Israel Yost's introductory article
on foreign aid in the April 197 0
Newsletter of the radical North

American Congress on Latin
America begins with the following
sentence: "Over the last 40 years,
the survival of capitalism has
rested on its ability to expand its
control over resources and
markets on a global scale."
There is an alternative
methodology which focuses on
the fact that men make history
and that their ideas have
consequences.
As R.A. Childs, Jr. puts it
in his essay, "Big Business and the
Rise of American Statism": "An
economic system is not an entity,
holds no ideas, takes no actions,
in short, is not the metaphysical
kind of entity which can have
needs. If a man needs something
and does not know it, he will not
act to attain it. If he does not
need something but thinks that he
does, he will act to attain it. The
same is true for a set of individual
people and their values, which is
all that an economic or political
system is ...
"If industrialists ... think that
war and conquest are necessary
for their continued prosperity,
then the odds are that they will
act in a manner that supports war
and conquest. History is hardly a
record of the actions of men
whose ideas were all true. Thus I

present-day foreign aid a form of
"welfare imperialism" and said,
"The really controversial things
(in the Senate) are the use of this
program for part of the military
domination of other countries."
However, Fulbright is clearly
not opposed to foreign aid per se,
for he went on to speak proudly
of his support for the recent
passage in the Senate of a
$2-billion appropriation for

"multilateral" aid through
international organizations—as
distinct from direct aid, which
Fulbright largely opposes.
Fulbright said: "The true
internationalist is the one . . . who
supports things like the United
Nations or the International
Bank."
So it appears that foreign aid is
not dead yet. Two component
parts of the voting coalition which
came together on October 29 to
defeat the foreign aid bill are
likely to desert the ranks: the
Cold War conservative allies of
Chiang Kai-shek and the Vietnam
war doves. This leaves only the
isolationists and the watchdogs of
government spending still
protecting the taxpaying
American citizenry from being
bled white by more money for
foreign aid.
Representative of the
isolationist viewpoint on foreign
aid is an article that former
Nebraska Congressman Howard
Buffett wrote on the subject in
Human Events in 1 955. He spoke
of the "foreign aid levy against
our earnings" and called it "a
multi-billion dollar pork barrel"
and "a permanent gravy train" for
which the American taxpayers
"must pay and pay."
Buffett said, "Foreign aid
consists of compulsory taking of
the earnings and resources of
taxpayers by political officials for
purposes over which the American
people have no effective say-so."
He concluded by saying, "Big
business, big labor, and big
government all find international
spending to their liking. Certainly
no one can deny that the
giveaways have augmented the
power of each member of this
triumvirate."
(About $143 billion has gone
into foreign aid since the Marshall
Plan was adopted at the beginning
of the Cold War.)
The conservatives who resented
Chiang's treatment in the UN vote
may well go over to the Nixon
administration's long-term reform
plan for the foreign aid program.
They are unlikely to support
abolition of foreign aid entirely.
This Nixon reform plan for

foreign aid was proposed last
April and was based on the
recommendation of a White
House task force headed by
Rudolph Peterson, former
president of the Bank of America.
As the October 31 New York
Times put it, "At the heart of the
suggested reforms was the
President's recommendation that
the United States gradually end its
government-to-government loans
and instead channel aid through

organizations such as the World
Bank."
So despite their apparent
differences, President Nixon and
Senator Fulbright (and the other
liberals) want the same programs.
Both groups like the World
Bank, headed by technocrat
Robert McNamara since April
1968.
This is not to say that Nixon
and Fulbright agree on military
aid appropriations. Clearly, except
on the desirability of aiding
Israel's war against the Palestinian
peasantry, they are in
disagreement.
Also certain conservatives are
bound to grumble that, if
"economic development" aid is
channelled through international
organizations (without
Congressional supervision), there
would be no sure guarantee that
certain American interests and
regions which previously
benefited from foreign aid would
continue to do so.
An examination of the role of
U.S. foreign aid in the past shows
that it has been, as Leonard Liggio
once said, "the vanguard of
American imperialism."
In The Roots of American
Foreign Policy, Gabriel Kolko
writes:
"The United States is the
world's leading state
trader.... Official American
agricultural export subsidy
programs involved $3 billion
annually in 1957 and 1967, with
sums approaching that amount in
the interim years. Most of these
subsidized exports went to
developing nations, often, as in
the case of India, in return for
vital concessions that aided
America's industry, just as
agricultural exports aided
(America's) big commercial
farmers."
Since the economic
development grants and loans
from the U.S. government
(ultimately from the American
taxpayer) have often been tied to
a requirement that the money be
spent on American goods, these
are also subsidies to American
corporations.
Why did liberals like Fulbright

go along with such a program in
the beginning and why do they
want to reform it now?
Before we can correctly answer
this question, we must deal with a
problem of historical
methodology. In much radical
analysis of historical events, one
observes that radicals distrust
everything the members of the
power elite say, except that
suddenly when members of the
power elite say that they need
expanding foreign markets or
some such thing, radicals often
believe them absolutely. The
correct approach is to subject
everything the ruling caste says to
scrutiny based on distrust.
Thus, one finds the following
in Bruce Nissen's fascinating
article on the World Bank in the
October-November 1971 issue of
the radical Pacific Studies Center
Telegram: "America's economy
after the war required such
policies. The testimony of U.S.
officials and experts on this point
was virtually unanimous. A
surplus-ridden American economy
after the war would require huge
markets abroad if it was to avoid
stagnation and depression." This
is followed by quotations from
Dean Acheson, Cordell Hull,
Francis Sayre, and William
Clayton which show conclusively
that these influential men believed
in a need for expanding markets.
Similarly, Hector Melo and
Israel Yost's introductory article
on foreign aid in the April 197 0
Newsletter of the radical North

American Congress on Latin
America begins with the following
sentence: "Over the last 40 years,
the survival of capitalism has
rested on its ability to expand its
control over resources and
markets on a global scale."
There is an alternative
methodology which focuses on
the fact that men make history
and that their ideas have
consequences.
As R.A. Childs, Jr. puts it
in his essay, "Big Business and the
Rise of American Statism": "An
economic system is not an entity,
holds no ideas, takes no actions,
in short, is not the metaphysical
kind of entity which can have
needs. If a man needs something
and does not know it, he will not
act to attain it. If he does not
need something but thinks that he
does, he will act to attain it. The
same is true for a set of individual
people and their values, which is
all that an economic or political
system is ...
"If industrialists ... think that
war and conquest are necessary
for their continued prosperity,
then the odds are that they will
act in a manner that supports war
and conquest. History is hardly a
record of the actions of men
whose ideas were all true. Thus I
would not argue in this essay that
capitalism needed government
controls or anything else of that
form. I argue only that major
industrialists in American history
held certain ideas and ends and
adopted certain means to attain
them."

In a subsequent essay, "How
bad is the U.S. government?"
Childs writes: "Influential
businessmen accepted the idea
that without (foreign expansion),
the U.S. was doomed to suffer
from ever-increasing depressions
and industrial crimes.... Big
businessmen turned to using the
U.S. military and its diplomatic
channels to insure ever-expanding
markets for their goods.
"This resulted in the
Spanish-American war, in
confrontations with Japan and

China, and the like. It led,
ultimately, to the American entry
into World War I and 11, and it is
an important motive in the
initiation of the Cold War."
(Nonetheless, the fact that big
businessmen believe a certain
theory of what causes and cures
depressions does not make that
theory correct. They will
probably act upon their theory.
But their theory may still be
mistaken, and I believe it is.)
