Pathological Mind?
Editor, THE DAILY:
I do not wish to abuse the
hospitality of the Daily by using
the misery of the people of Bangla
Desh as a vehicle for
Indo-Pakistan bickering. I wish to
thank Mr. Kemal for helping me
prove my point that the
paralogical condition of a
propaganda fed Pakistani mind
cannot be converted to
enlightened objectivity, even after
a full years liberal education at a
fine University like Stanford.
Sincerely,

The article "Pakistan and
Power Politics" published in the
Daily dated October 28, 1971,
contains nothing but malicious
and prejudicial statements about
Pakistan. The pages of Daily
should not be wasted on such
superficial articles which serve no
purpose other than to create
hatred and ill-feelings among
Indians and Pakistanis.

Face The Issues
Editor, THE DAILY:
Tuesday's letter, signed (we are
told) by 25 students and 11
members of the faculty in the
German Department is one more
in a continuing series of efforts to
distract the Stanford community
from paying attention to the
issues in the Franklin case.
Talking about this country's
immoral and illegal activity and
the University's complicity
therein is intended to draw

attention away from the precise
charges against Professor Franklin,
which may be paraphrased as
inciting students and others to
perform acts inconsistent with the
minimal obligations of
membership in an academic
community.
If proven by the evidence,
these charges have nothing to do
with "academic freedom" or "free
speech." I should prefer the
Advisory Board's judgment on
whether the charges are proven to
that of the authors of the letter.
They do not have the obligation
to hear the evidence, nor, as their
letter shows, are they free from
bias.
The Advisory Board has quite
enough to do as it sorts out the
great volume of evidence that
both parties have introduced
affecting these charges. The letter
seems to me to be on a par with
last week's guerrilla theater which
the Advisory Board's chairman
condemned.
It is a bald effort to influence
the decision as the time for
decision draws close. It should
therefore be condemned by the
Stanford community.

P.S. Since I do not regard 25
students or 11 faculty members as
being all that persuasive, I have
not asked anyone else to sign this
letter.
Wrong Parallel
Editor, THE DAILY:
The letter from students and
faculty in the German department
in support of Professor Franklin
(Daily, Nov. 2) seems to prove the
opposite of what it claims. The
writers say, "We all know that if

the professors and students at
German universities had spoken
out unambiguously against the
Hitler government, the most
shameful chapter of German
history might not have occurred."
If this is meant to imply that
we already have a Fascist state
like Hitler's, the claim is
self-refuting. For if this were the
case, Professor Franklin would
have been summarily dismissed
long since. The Daily would have
been suppressed. And the
members of the German
department could not have had
their letter published. By writing
it for publication, they disprove
their thesis.
On the other hand if the
writers mean that the German
professors and students might by
concerted opposition have
stopped Hitler before he came to
power, the claim might be true.
The historical fact is that many
German students attacked the
pre-Hitler Republic, thereby
increasing the chaos which paved
the way for Hitler's rise. If this
parallel is relevant, its lesson is
clear: Don't attack a Republican
government, however
unsatisfactory, lest you bring in a
Hitler. On this basis, Professor
Franklin should be opposed.
As to the underlying claim that
because the university is
"immoral" anybody who attacks
it is morally good, this is patently
fallacious even if you accept the
premise. If A is a bad man and B
attacks A, this does not show that
B is good. B might be a worse
villain than A.
It should also be noted that the
idea that the American university
persecutes radical professors is
based less on fact than on what
Leslie Fiedler has called a
"stereotype propagated by a
hundred middlebrow novels and
ten thousand middlebrow tracts"
of the 1950's and early 1960'5.
(Waiting for the End, Ch. 9, "The
War Against the Academy.") For
"middlebrow" we may read
"bourgeois intellectual."

Anti-War?
Editor, THE DAILY:
I object to the use of the term
"anti-war" for some of the
activities described in the forum
in the November 3 Daily. (I'm not
suggesting that you are the first or
only ones to use the word thusly,
by any means.)

It totally escapes me how
"anti-war" can be applied to:
1. anyone who approves of, in
principle or in practice, the use of
violence against people or
property as a tactic for attaining
political ends. Isn't that what
"war" means?
2. anyone who speaks
approvingly of "the tactics of
people's war" or the tactics of any
other kind of war.
3. any organization which has a
rifle as its symbol.
4. anyone calling for the
victory of the Viet Cong, or any
other military force.
5. anyone who believes th#4r
"all political power comes out ofj
the barrel of a gun."
When those things are called
"anti-war," there are shades of the
doubletalk of 1984, in which
"war is peace."
I am opposed to war-related
activities of all kinds, whether by
the "establishment" or by elitist
groups calling themselves "the
people." The victims of one are
just as dead as those of the other.

Shabby Treatment
Editor, THE DAILY:
I would like to expose and
protest the shabby treatment still
being accorded female
competitors by the hierarchy of
the men's intramural athletics
program. Women have joined in
the intramural cross country race
almost every year I have run it,
that is since 1967. This year there
was a good female turnout, about
four to six out of about sixty
runners.
Once again as in the past the
officials refused to give places to
the women when they finished.
Dutch Fehring has told us that the
policy is set by someone other
than himself and has sent
questioners on to Chuck Taylor.
I can see no reason why
women should not be allowed to
participate officially in intramural,
events such as cross country and
track (the only two that I have
regularly participated in myself).J
don't see what the objection
could be on the part of the
athletic department or any one
else. I urge that the ridiculous
regulation barring women from
official participation be dropped.

The letter from students and
faculty in the German department
in support of Professor Franklin
(Daily, Nov. 2) seems to prove the
opposite of what it claims. The
writers say, "We all know that if

the professors and students at
German universities had spoken
out unambiguously against the
Hitler government, the most
shameful chapter of German
history might not have occurred."
If this is meant to imply that
we already have a Fascist state
like Hitler's, the claim is
self-refuting. For if this were the
case, Professor Franklin would
have been summarily dismissed
long since. The Daily would have
been suppressed. And the
members of the German
department could not have had
their letter published. By writing
it for publication, they disprove
their thesis.
On the other hand if the
writers mean that the German
professors and students might by
concerted opposition have
stopped Hitler before he came to
power, the claim might be true.
The historical fact is that many
German students attacked the
pre-Hitler Republic, thereby
increasing the chaos which paved
the way for Hitler's rise. If this
parallel is relevant, its lesson is
clear: Don't attack a Republican
government, however
unsatisfactory, lest you bring in a
Hitler. On this basis, Professor
Franklin should be opposed.
As to the underlying claim that
because the university is
"immoral" anybody who attacks
it is morally good, this is patently
fallacious even if you accept the
premise. If A is a bad man and B
attacks A, this does not show that
B is good. B might be a worse
villain than A.
It should also be noted that the
idea that the American university
persecutes radical professors is
based less on fact than on what
Leslie Fiedler has called a
"stereotype propagated by a
hundred middlebrow novels and
ten thousand middlebrow tracts"
of the 1950's and early 1960'5.
(Waiting for the End, Ch. 9, "The
War Against the Academy.") For
"middlebrow" we may read
"bourgeois intellectual."

Editor, THE DAILY:
I object to the use of the term
"anti-war" for some of the
activities described in the forum
in the November 3 Daily. (I'm not
suggesting that you are the first or
only ones to use the word thusly,
by any means.)

It totally escapes me how
"anti-war" can be applied to:
1. anyone who approves of, in
principle or in practice, the use of
violence against people or
property as a tactic for attaining
political ends. Isn't that what
"war" means?
2. anyone who speaks
approvingly of "the tactics of
people's war" or the tactics of any
other kind of war.
3. any organization which has a
rifle as its symbol.
4. anyone calling for the
victory of the Viet Cong, or any
other military force.
5. anyone who believes th#4r
"all political power comes out ofj
the barrel of a gun."
When those things are called
"anti-war," there are shades of the
doubletalk of 1984, in which
"war is peace."
I am opposed to war-related
activities of all kinds, whether by
the "establishment" or by elitist
groups calling themselves "the
people." The victims of one are
just as dead as those of the other.

Editor, THE DAILY:
I would like to expose and
protest the shabby treatment still
being accorded female
competitors by the hierarchy of
the men's intramural athletics
program. Women have joined in
the intramural cross country race
almost every year I have run it,
that is since 1967. This year there
was a good female turnout, about
four to six out of about sixty
runners.
Once again as in the past the
officials refused to give places to
the women when they finished.
Dutch Fehring has told us that the
policy is set by someone other
than himself and has sent
questioners on to Chuck Taylor.
I can see no reason why
women should not be allowed to
participate officially in intramural,
events such as cross country and
track (the only two that I have
regularly participated in myself).J
don't see what the objection
could be on the part of the
athletic department or any one
else. I urge that the ridiculous
regulation barring women from
official participation be dropped.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Tuesday's letter, signed (we are
told) by 25 students and 11
members of the faculty in the
German Department is one more
in a continuing series of efforts to
distract the Stanford community
from paying attention to the
issues in the Franklin case.
Talking about this country's
immoral and illegal activity and
the University's complicity
therein is intended to draw

attention away from the precise
charges against Professor Franklin,
which may be paraphrased as
inciting students and others to
perform acts inconsistent with the
minimal obligations of
membership in an academic
community.
If proven by the evidence,
these charges have nothing to do
with "academic freedom" or "free
speech." I should prefer the
Advisory Board's judgment on
whether the charges are proven to
that of the authors of the letter.
They do not have the obligation
to hear the evidence, nor, as their
letter shows, are they free from
bias.
The Advisory Board has quite
enough to do as it sorts out the
great volume of evidence that
both parties have introduced
affecting these charges. The letter
seems to me to be on a par with
last week's guerrilla theater which
the Advisory Board's chairman
condemned.
It is a bald effort to influence
the decision as the time for
decision draws close. It should
therefore be condemned by the
Stanford community.

Shabby Treatment
Editor, THE DAILY:
I would like to expose and
protest the shabby treatment still
being accorded female
competitors by the hierarchy of
the men's intramural athletics
program. Women have joined in
the intramural cross country race
almost every year I have run it,
that is since 1967. This year there
was a good female turnout, about
four to six out of about sixty
runners.
Once again as in the past the
officials refused to give places to
the women when they finished.
Dutch Fehring has told us that the
policy is set by someone other
than himself and has sent
questioners on to Chuck Taylor.
I can see no reason why
women should not be allowed to
participate officially in intramural,
events such as cross country and
track (the only two that I have
regularly participated in myself).J
don't see what the objection
could be on the part of the
athletic department or any one
else. I urge that the ridiculous
regulation barring women from
official participation be dropped.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Tuesday's letter, signed (we are
told) by 25 students and 11
members of the faculty in the
German Department is one more
in a continuing series of efforts to
distract the Stanford community
from paying attention to the
issues in the Franklin case.
Talking about this country's
immoral and illegal activity and
the University's complicity
therein is intended to draw

attention away from the precise
charges against Professor Franklin,
which may be paraphrased as
inciting students and others to
perform acts inconsistent with the
minimal obligations of
membership in an academic
community.
If proven by the evidence,
these charges have nothing to do
with "academic freedom" or "free
speech." I should prefer the
Advisory Board's judgment on
whether the charges are proven to
that of the authors of the letter.
They do not have the obligation
to hear the evidence, nor, as their
letter shows, are they free from
bias.
The Advisory Board has quite
enough to do as it sorts out the
great volume of evidence that
both parties have introduced
affecting these charges. The letter
seems to me to be on a par with
last week's guerrilla theater which
the Advisory Board's chairman
condemned.
It is a bald effort to influence
the decision as the time for
decision draws close. It should
therefore be condemned by the
Stanford community.

P.S. Since I do not regard 25

Wrong Parallel
Editor, THE DAILY:
The letter from students and
faculty in the German department
in support of Professor Franklin
(Daily, Nov. 2) seems to prove the
opposite of what it claims. The
writers say, "We all know that if

the professors and students at
German universities had spoken
out unambiguously against the
Hitler government, the most
shameful chapter of German
history might not have occurred."
If this is meant to imply that
we already have a Fascist state
like Hitler's, the claim is
self-refuting. For if this were the
case, Professor Franklin would
have been summarily dismissed
long since. The Daily would have
been suppressed. And the
members of the German
department could not have had
their letter published. By writing
it for publication, they disprove
their thesis.
On the other hand if the
writers mean that the German
professors and students might by
concerted opposition have
stopped Hitler before he came to
power, the claim might be true.
The historical fact is that many
German students attacked the
pre-Hitler Republic, thereby
increasing the chaos which paved
the way for Hitler's rise. If this
parallel is relevant, its lesson is
clear: Don't attack a Republican
government, however
unsatisfactory, lest you bring in a
Hitler. On this basis, Professor
Franklin should be opposed.
As to the underlying claim that
because the university is
"immoral" anybody who attacks
it is morally good, this is patently
fallacious even if you accept the
premise. If A is a bad man and B
attacks A, this does not show that
B is good. B might be a worse
villain than A.
It should also be noted that the
idea that the American university
persecutes radical professors is
based less on fact than on what
Leslie Fiedler has called a
"stereotype propagated by a
hundred middlebrow novels and
ten thousand middlebrow tracts"
of the 1950's and early 1960'5.
(Waiting for the End, Ch. 9, "The
War Against the Academy.") For
"middlebrow" we may read
"bourgeois intellectual."

Power Politics" published in the
Daily dated October 28, 1971,
contains nothing but malicious
and prejudicial statements about
Pakistan. The pages of Daily
should not be wasted on such
superficial articles which serve no
purpose other than to create
hatred and ill-feelings among
Indians and Pakistanis.
Very truly,

Face The Issues
Editor, THE DAILY:
Tuesday's letter, signed (we are
told) by 25 students and 11
members of the faculty in the
German Department is one more
in a continuing series of efforts to
distract the Stanford community
from paying attention to the
issues in the Franklin case.
Talking about this country's
immoral and illegal activity and
the University's complicity
therein is intended to draw

attention away from the precise
charges against Professor Franklin,
which may be paraphrased as
inciting students and others to
perform acts inconsistent with the
minimal obligations of
membership in an academic
community.
If proven by the evidence,
these charges have nothing to do
with "academic freedom" or "free
speech." I should prefer the
Advisory Board's judgment on
whether the charges are proven to
that of the authors of the letter.
They do not have the obligation
to hear the evidence, nor, as their
letter shows, are they free from
bias.
The Advisory Board has quite
enough to do as it sorts out the
great volume of evidence that
both parties have introduced
affecting these charges. The letter
seems to me to be on a par with
last week's guerrilla theater which
the Advisory Board's chairman
condemned.
It is a bald effort to influence
the decision as the time for
decision draws close. It should
therefore be condemned by the
Stanford community.

P.S. Since I do not regard 25
students or 11 faculty members as
being all that persuasive, I have
not asked anyone else to sign this
letter.
Wrong Parallel
Editor, THE DAILY:
The letter from students and
faculty in the German department
in support of Professor Franklin
(Daily, Nov. 2) seems to prove the
opposite of what it claims. The
writers say, "We all know that if

the professors and students at
German universities had spoken
out unambiguously against the
Hitler government, the most
shameful chapter of German
history might not have occurred."
If this is meant to imply that
we already have a Fascist state
like Hitler's, the claim is
self-refuting. For if this were the
case, Professor Franklin would
have been summarily dismissed
long since. The Daily would have
been suppressed. And the
members of the German
department could not have had
their letter published. By writing
it for publication, they disprove
their thesis.
On the other hand if the
writers mean that the German
professors and students might by
concerted opposition have
stopped Hitler before he came to
power, the claim might be true.
The historical fact is that many
German students attacked the
pre-Hitler Republic, thereby
increasing the chaos which paved
the way for Hitler's rise. If this
parallel is relevant, its lesson is
clear: Don't attack a Republican
government, however
unsatisfactory, lest you bring in a
Hitler. On this basis, Professor
Franklin should be opposed.
As to the underlying claim that
because the university is
"immoral" anybody who attacks
it is morally good, this is patently
fallacious even if you accept the
premise. If A is a bad man and B
attacks A, this does not show that
B is good. B might be a worse
villain than A.
It should also be noted that the
idea that the American university
persecutes radical professors is
based less on fact than on what
Leslie Fiedler has called a
"stereotype propagated by a
hundred middlebrow novels and
ten thousand middlebrow tracts"
of the 1950's and early 1960'5.
(Waiting for the End, Ch. 9, "The
War Against the Academy.") For
"middlebrow" we may read
"bourgeois intellectual."

Anti-War?
Editor, THE DAILY:
I object to the use of the term
"anti-war" for some of the
activities described in the forum
in the November 3 Daily. (I'm not
suggesting that you are the first or
only ones to use the word thusly,
by any means.)

It totally escapes me how
"anti-war" can be applied to:
1. anyone who approves of, in
principle or in practice, the use of
violence against people or
property as a tactic for attaining
political ends. Isn't that what
"war" means?
2. anyone who speaks
approvingly of "the tactics of
people's war" or the tactics of any
other kind of war.
3. any organization which has a
rifle as its symbol.
4. anyone calling for the
victory of the Viet Cong, or any
other military force.
5. anyone who believes th#4r
"all political power comes out ofj
the barrel of a gun."
When those things are called
"anti-war," there are shades of the
doubletalk of 1984, in which
"war is peace."
I am opposed to war-related
activities of all kinds, whether by
the "establishment" or by elitist
groups calling themselves "the
people." The victims of one are
just as dead as those of the other.

Shabby Treatment
Editor, THE DAILY:
I would like to expose and
protest the shabby treatment still
being accorded female
competitors by the hierarchy of
the men's intramural athletics
program. Women have joined in
the intramural cross country race
almost every year I have run it,
that is since 1967. This year there
was a good female turnout, about
four to six out of about sixty
runners.
Once again as in the past the
officials refused to give places to
the women when they finished.
Dutch Fehring has told us that the
policy is set by someone other
than himself and has sent
questioners on to Chuck Taylor.
I can see no reason why
women should not be allowed to
participate officially in intramural,
events such as cross country and
track (the only two that I have
regularly participated in myself).J
don't see what the objection
could be on the part of the
athletic department or any one
else. I urge that the ridiculous
regulation barring women from
official participation be dropped.
