## Bonfire Fire 
### 
Stop The Bonfire
The annual ritual of the
Stanford big-game bonfire is a
needless source of air pollution
and is a waste of resources of
wood, and human time and
energy.
The bonfire produces
approximately 4.37 tons of air
contaminant emissions, consisting
of 3.0 tons of carbon monoxide,
1.2 tons of organics, and 0.12
tons of particulates, according to
records of the San Francisco Bay
Area Air Pollution Control Board
in 1970.
In an era of supposed
"ecological awareness," it is ironic
for Stanford University and
Stanford students to add to air
pollution with this old rah-rah
bonfire.
Palo AVto High School students
have given up their annual
football bonfire after talking to
the pollution control board.
Can Stanford afford to do less?
You can help end this
pollution of our environment by
protesting to the Santa Clara
County Fire Marshal, Mr. Carter
at 299-2041 or by calling the
office of Dr. Richard Lyman,
President of Stanford University
at 321-2300, ext. 24 8 1.
James Kedzie Say re
One Good Reason
I would like to address the
following questions to Mr.
Dickenson of the Inter-fraternity
Council, or any other proponent
of continuing the tradition of the
big game bonfire:
1. Could you give me one—or
possibly more—good reasons for
holding the fire?
2. Does the somewhat negative
reason provided by the
engineering firm which studied
the amount of pollution the
bonfire would cause—that it won't
mean "the end of the

world"—appear to be a suitable
and workable criterion for judging
the desirability of an activity—this
or any other—with measurably
harmful environmental effects?
3. In view of the willingness of
the San Francisco Air Pollution
Control Board to permit the fire,
is there any reason to retain
the least faith in the ability of this
agency to resist pressure from
industry and other sources to
make exceptions in its policies
and regulations on even the most
tenuous showing of necessity?
4. In view of the apparent
willingness of most students not
to oppose or even object to the
holding of the bonfire, might it
not be only fair and honest for us
to renounce our public image as
the single most ecologically
minded and sensitive non-special
interest group in the society and
to bequeath that honor to some
other more deserving segment of
the population?
I would genuinely appreciate
hearing from anyone who can
answer these questions.

needless source of air pollution
and is a waste of resources of
wood, and human time and
energy.
The bonfire produces
approximately 4.37 tons of air
contaminant emissions, consisting
of 3.0 tons of carbon monoxide,
1.2 tons of organics, and 0.12
tons of particulates, according to
records of the San Francisco Bay
Area Air Pollution Control Board
in 1970.
In an era of supposed
"ecological awareness," it is ironic
for Stanford University and
Stanford students to add to air
pollution with this old rah-rah
bonfire.
Palo AVto High School students
have given up their annual
football bonfire after talking to
the pollution control board.
Can Stanford afford to do less?
You can help end this
pollution of our environment by
protesting to the Santa Clara
County Fire Marshal, Mr. Carter
at 299-2041 or by calling the
office of Dr. Richard Lyman,
President of Stanford University
at 321-2300, ext. 24 8 1.

I would like to address the
following questions to Mr.
Dickenson of the Inter-fraternity
Council, or any other proponent
of continuing the tradition of the
big game bonfire:
1. Could you give me one—or
possibly more—good reasons for
holding the fire?
2. Does the somewhat negative
reason provided by the
engineering firm which studied
the amount of pollution the
bonfire would cause—that it won't
mean "the end of the

world"—appear to be a suitable
and workable criterion for judging
the desirability of an activity—this
or any other—with measurably
harmful environmental effects?
3. In view of the willingness of
the San Francisco Air Pollution
Control Board to permit the fire,
is there any reason to retain
the least faith in the ability of this
agency to resist pressure from
industry and other sources to
make exceptions in its policies
and regulations on even the most
tenuous showing of necessity?
4. In view of the apparent
willingness of most students not
to oppose or even object to the
holding of the bonfire, might it
not be only fair and honest for us
to renounce our public image as
the single most ecologically
minded and sensitive non-special
interest group in the society and
to bequeath that honor to some
other more deserving segment of
the population?
I would genuinely appreciate
hearing from anyone who can
answer these questions.
