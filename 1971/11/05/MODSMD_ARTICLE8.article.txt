# crimes against society
## I Confess... I Confess... 
### 
Recent events on campus have
made me do some real soul
searching to uncover and confess
my own faults and crimes against
society. Key events have been the
recognition of the students' free
rejection of taxation without
representation as blatant racism,
and the realization that the
Stanford Band's efforts at
peaceful self-determination are
obviously the worst kind of
sexism. In such a framework I am
in real trouble.
I confess that I sometimes
direct my students in their studies
and even in their research, thus
clearly violating their freedom of
conscience.
I confess that I do not always
give all my students an A, thus
clearly discriminating on the basis
of performance.
I confess that I belong to one

organization that does not allow
people to become members unless
they are willing to agree with the
position of the organization and
live accordingly, thus clearly
establishing discrimination in
society. (In case you can't tell; it's
a church.)
J confess that I belong to
another organization that permits
only scientists to enjoy its
benefits, thus obviously
discriminating against other
professions and implying certainly
the superiority of science.
My personal life is just as bad.
My marriage contract
undoubtedly establishes me as a
sexist. (I even expect my wife to
have dinner ready when I get
home from work!)
1 confess that I have corrected
(and even spanked) my children,
thus interfering with their right to
develop as they see fit.

Worse still, I confess that I
have taught my children moral
and even religious values, thereby
clearly violating their freedom of
conscience.
I confess that I have taken part
in public meetings designed to
change the religious and political
convictions of the audience,
another violation of the freedoms
of those who disagree with me.
I confess that more of my
students are non-Caucasian than
they have any right to be
compared to their fraction of the
total population.
My attitudes brand me as
hopeless. I believe it is important
to discriminate between that
which is essentially serious and
that which is essentially
ridiculous. For a man to take

Richard h. bube

himself too seriously is his first
step to inhuamnity. I am not so
tolerant that I am willing to
believe anything. I do not see all
life as black or white, as good or
evil, as us or them. I confess to all
these dangerous aberrations in
thought, and must add that I also
refuse to accept zeal in place of
compassion, or sincerity in place
of truth, or self-righteousness in
place of love.
While I was making this
confession, I noticed a small
group of young people nearby
listening. They were laughing, at
first quietly and then
uproariously. I laughed with them
until the tears ran.
(Richard H. Bube is a professor
of Materials Science and Electrical
Engineering.)
