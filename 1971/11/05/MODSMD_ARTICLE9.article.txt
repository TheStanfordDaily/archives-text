# Answers To Recruitment Policy
## 
### LARRY DIAMOND 
Members of the Stanford
community who oppose the
policy adopted by the student
body on military and corporate
recruiting have raised two
arguments that deserve to be
answered. First, they claim that
the policy set by the student body
is a case of a majority making
moral decisions for a minority.
It should be understood that in
making the decision that no
student may be recruited at the
Placement Center by a military
service or by a corporation
"directly producing materials and
research for the military," we are
not setting any precedent. The
University has already made the
decision—for all of the
students—that none of them may
be recruited at the Placement
Center by corporations that
discriminate on the basis of race
or sex.
It will be argued that such a
decision is not an arbitrary moral
ruling, but rather, is based on
restrictions in the law. I will argue
below that the student policy on
recruiting has equally firm basis in

the law, and that, therefore, the
prohibitions on military recruiters
should be as valid as those on
racist or sexist recruiters.
The second argument of those
opposing the student body policy
is that if a facility like the
Placement Center is open to some
corporate recruiters, it should be
open to all of them not violating
the law. They claim that moral
criteria cannot be used to
discriminate between which
corporations are welcome and
which are not unless those criteria
have legal foundations.
But there is a law under which
we are able, indeed obligated, to
prohibit the military services and
military contractors from
conducting their business at the
placement center. It is part of a
group of laws that this country
helped draft, and subsequently
pledged to respect, in 1945.
Collectively, these laws are known
as the Nuremberg Principles.
Principle VII of Nuremberg
states, "Complicity in the
commission of a crime against
humanity as set forth in Principle
VI is a crime under international
law." Principle VI defines crimes

against humanity to include,
"Murder, extermination,
enslavement, deportation and
other inhuman acts done against
any civilian population . . . when
such acts are done... in
execution of or connection with
any crime against peace or any
war crime."
The United States is guilty of
crimes against peare (waging a war
in violation of international

are providing the men and
material for the war machine are
guilty of "complicity in the
commission of a crime against
humanity," under Principle VII.
They are violating the law, just
as corporations which
discriminate on the basis of race
or sex are violating the law. And
just as we can, and should, legally
prohibit the latter group from
recruiting at our Placement

prohibit the latter group from
recruiting at our Placement

Center, so should we legally
prohibit the former as well.
There is NO law of this nation
that legally prevents us from
implementing the student body
policy on recruitment. The
question of which set of laws
takes precedence does not need to
be dealt with here because we can
in this case respect the
international law without
violating any in this country.
Responsibility lays ultimately
at the heart of the matter. The
soldiers are not responsible for the
killing: they are only following
orders. The engineers that design
the instruments of destruction are
not responsible for the killing:
they can't know how the
instruments will be used. Their
corporations aren't responsible for
the killing: they only contract for
what the government says it
needs.
The Universities are not
responsible for the killing: they
only facilitate the recruitment of
soldiers and engineers in an open
and non-discriminatory fashion.
And of course the Congress is not
responsible for the killing: the
Executive Branch makes foreign
policy.
No one is responsible for the
killing. But people are being

agreements and assurances) and of
war crimes (murder, ill-treatment
of civilian population, wanton
destruction of cities and towns, or
devastation not justified by
military necessecity) in Southeast
Asia.
This nation is, therefore, also
guilty of crimes against humanity.
The services and corporations that

killed, and crimes are being
committed, all the same. Clearly,
something is wrong with the logic
of all these groups.
What is wrong is that
everybody is passing the buck
while they go on facilitating the
operation of a criminal war
machine.
I believe we can ask, not on
only moral grounds, but on solid
legal grounds, that the University
stop facilitating the operation of
that war machine
On legal grounds, we ask the
University to accept responsibility
for the consequences of the
business that takes place at its
students' Placement Center.
We must be careful not to
deceive ourselves or the
University, however. There will be
consequences from this
prohibition, just as there are
consequences from the war
recruiting that now takes place.
By barring military recruiters
from campus, the federal
government will seek, under
authority granted to it by the
most recent NASA Authorization
Act, to prohibit any new grants to
the University under this act. We
now have $2+ million in such
grants. And the University will
not be able to ask for
contributions from the military
contractors that it bars from
recruiting on campus.
The student body policy on
recruitment will have negative
financial consequences for
Stanford, but if we are to be free
from the kinds of intimidation
and domination by other
institutions that Universities for
the last 600 years have fought so
passionately to be free from
(whether the institution is the
federal government, or a
corporation, or a church), and if
we are to be responsible under not
only the laws that govern this
nation, but also under those laws
that this nation has agreed govern
the world, then we, as a
University, should recognize the
student body policy on military

of all these groups.
What is wrong is that
everybody is passing the buck
while they go on facilitating the

I believe we can ask, not on
only moral grounds, but on solid
legal grounds, that the University
stop facilitating the operation of
that war machine
On legal grounds, we ask the
University to accept responsibility
for the consequences of the

We must be careful not to
deceive ourselves or the

consequences from this

By barring military recruiters

The student body policy on

from the kinds of intimidation

institutions that Universities for

passionately to be free from
(whether the institution is the

corporation, or a church), and if
we are to be responsible under not
only the laws that govern this
nation, but also under those laws
that this nation has agreed govern
the world, then we, as a
University, should recognize the
student body policy on military

Members of the Stanford
community who oppose the
policy adopted by the student
body on military and corporate
recruiting have raised two
arguments that deserve to be
answered. First, they claim that
the policy set by the student body
is a case of a majority making
moral decisions for a minority.
It should be understood that in
making the decision that no
student may be recruited at the
Placement Center by a military
service or by a corporation
"directly producing materials and
research for the military," we are
not setting any precedent. The
University has already made the
decision—for all of the
students—that none of them may
be recruited at the Placement
Center by corporations that
discriminate on the basis of race
or sex.
It will be argued that such a
decision is not an arbitrary moral
ruling, but rather, is based on
restrictions in the law. I will argue
below that the student policy on
recruiting has equally firm basis in

the law, and that, therefore, the
prohibitions on military recruiters
should be as valid as those on
racist or sexist recruiters.
The second argument of those
opposing the student body policy
is that if a facility like the
Placement Center is open to some
corporate recruiters, it should be
open to all of them not violating
the law. They claim that moral
criteria cannot be used to
discriminate between which
corporations are welcome and
which are not unless those criteria
have legal foundations.
But there is a law under which
we are able, indeed obligated, to
prohibit the military services and
military contractors from
conducting their business at the
placement center. It is part of a
group of laws that this country
helped draft, and subsequently
pledged to respect, in 1945.
Collectively, these laws are known

business that takes place at its
students' Placement Center.
We must be careful not to
deceive ourselves or the
University, however. There will be
consequences from this
prohibition, just as there are
consequences from the war
recruiting that now takes place.
By barring military recruiters
from campus, the federal
government will seek, under
authority granted to it by the
most recent NASA Authorization
Act, to prohibit any new grants to
the University under this act. We
now have $2+ million in such
grants. And the University will
not be able to ask for
contributions from the military
contractors that it bars from
recruiting on campus.
The student body policy on
recruitment will have negative
financial consequences for
Stanford, but if we are to be free
from the kinds of intimidation
and domination by other
institutions that Universities for
the last 600 years have fought so
passionately to be free from
(whether the institution is the
federal government, or a
corporation, or a church), and if
we are to be responsible under not
only the laws that govern this
nation, but also under those laws
that this nation has agreed govern
the world, then we, as a
University, should recognize the
student body policy on military
and corporate recruiting
Members of the Stanford
community who oppose the
policy adopted by the student
body on military and corporate
recruiting have raised two
arguments that deserve to be
answered. First, they claim that
the policy set by the student body
is a case of a majority making
moral decisions for a minority.
It should be understood that in
making the decision that no
student may be recruited at the
Placement Center by a military
service or by a corporation
"directly producing materials and
research for the military," we are
not setting any precedent. The
University has already made the
decision—for all of the
students—that none of them may
be recruited at the Placement
Center by corporations that
discriminate on the basis of race
or sex.
It will be argued that such a
decision is not an arbitrary moral
ruling, but rather, is based on
restrictions in the law. I will argue
below that the student policy on
recruiting has equally firm basis in

the law, and that, therefore, the
prohibitions on military recruiters
should be as valid as those on
racist or sexist recruiters.
The second argument of those
opposing the student body policy
is that if a facility like the
Placement Center is open to some
corporate recruiters, it should be
open to all of them not violating
the law. They claim that moral
criteria cannot be used to
discriminate between which
corporations are welcome and
which are not unless those criteria
have legal foundations.
But there is a law under which
we are able, indeed obligated, to
prohibit the military services and
military contractors from
conducting their business at the
placement center. It is part of a
group of laws that this country
helped draft, and subsequently
pledged to respect, in 1945.
Collectively, these laws are known
as the Nuremberg Principles.
Principle VII of Nuremberg
states, "Complicity in the
commission of a crime against
humanity as set forth in Principle
VI is a crime under international
law." Principle VI defines crimes

against humanity to include,
"Murder, extermination,
enslavement, deportation and
other inhuman acts done against
any civilian population . . . when
such acts are done... in
execution of or connection with
any crime against peace or any
war crime."
The United States is guilty of
crimes against peare (waging a war
in violation of international

are providing the men and
material for the war machine are
guilty of "complicity in the
commission of a crime against
humanity," under Principle VII.
They are violating the law, just
as corporations which
discriminate on the basis of race
or sex are violating the law. And
just as we can, and should, legally
prohibit the latter group from
recruiting at our Placement

prohibit the latter group from
recruiting at our Placement
/1 m I
Center, so should we legally
prohibit the former as well.
There is NO law of this nation
that legally prevents us from
implementing the student body
policy on recruitment. The
question of which set of laws
takes precedence does not need to
be dealt with here because we can
in this case respect the
international law without
violating any in this country.
Responsibility lays ultimately
at the heart of the matter. The
soldiers are not responsible for the
killing: they are only following
orders. The engineers that design
the instruments of destruction are
not responsible for the killing:
they can't know how the
instruments will be used. Their
corporations aren't responsible for
the killing: they only contract for
what the government says it
needs.
The Universities are not
responsible for the killing: they
only facilitate the recruitment of
soldiers and engineers in an open
and non-discriminatory fashion.
And of course the Congress is not
responsible for the killing: the
Executive Branch makes foreign
policy.
No one is responsible for the
killing. But people are being

war crimes (murder, ill-treatment
of civilian population, wanton
destruction of cities and towns, or
devastation not justified by
military necessecity) in Southeast
Asia.
This nation is, therefore, also
guilty of crimes against humanity.
The services and corporations that

killed, and crimes are being
committed, all the same. Clearly,
something is wrong with the logic
of all these groups.
What is wrong is that
everybody is passing the buck
while they go on facilitating the
operation of a criminal war
machine.
I believe we can ask, not on
only moral grounds, but on solid
legal grounds, that the University
stop facilitating the operation of
that war machine
On legal grounds, we ask the
University to accept responsibility
for the consequences of the
