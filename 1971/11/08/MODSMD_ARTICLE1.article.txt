# Franklin Makes Final Arguments As 33-Day Hearing Concludes
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
The six-week dismissal hearing of
Professor H. Bruce Franklin ended
Friday with Franklin proclaiming,
"Long live the victory of the people's
war!"
As Franklin's supporters cheered,
the faculty Advisory Board rushed out
of Physics 101 to avoid hearing the
demonstration, and the case was over.
The Board will meet privately today
to begin deliberations on the 33
sessions of testimony. Their
recommendation to President Lyman is
not expected for at least a month.
Franklin's hearing involved 165
hours of testimony and over 100
witnesses. The administration and
Franklin placed in evidence 227
photographs and 136 other exhibits.
Franklin used the four hours
allotted for his final arguments, calling
the incitement charges against him

"ludicrous" and thanking "the
administration for so thoroughly
exposing itself."
The Maoist professor urged the
faculty members hearing the case to
completely exonerate him of the four
charges he faces: "Even saying just the
word 'censure' would be a violation not
only of the rights of revolutionaries but
also of rights and liberties that you
yourselves supposedly hold precious."
Describing the complicated hearings,
Franklin said, "Never has such
insignificant behavior been held up to
such minute scrutiny."
Stressing the Maoist analysis he has
used throughout the case, Franklin said
the university "tramples more and
more on its own Bourgeois values" to
keep its resources from "becoming the
property of poor and working class
people."
"The main trend in the world today

is revolution," the suspended English
professor added.
"At Stanford the administration
argues we can suspend the
Constitution," Franklin charged,
insisting the Board should require as
much evidence as would a civil court
hearing similar charges.
Franklin was assisted by Harvard
Law School graduate Joel Klein, who
argued that Franklin is charged with
violations of rules that are "vague and
overboard."
Franklin attacked tenure rules
allowing dismissal for failure to
perform "appropriate functions within
the university community." He said the
1967 rules were not intended for
political activists but for "an alcoholic
who gets so drunk that he falls down
on his way to class."
"Professor Franklin admitted before

this Board that he decided not to break
the rules on this campus," Klein said.
THE LODGE INCIDENT
The first of four charges against
Franklin is participation in disruption
of a January speech by Henry Cabot
Lodge, former US Ambassador to
South Vietnam.
Franklin told the Advisory Board,
"People were incited by having a war
criminal come to Stanford."
He said, "We wanted Lodge, who's
responsible for much of that policy on
Vietnam, to answer questions."
Franklin said he supported those
who were trying to prevent Lodge from
speaking but insisted he personally
made no more than three comments, all
before Lodge stepped to the podium.
Franklin defended such heckling,
quoting a decision by the California
State Supreme court, which ruled, "A
cogent remark, even though rudely
timed or phrased, may contribute to
the exchange of ideas."
Franklin said he had presented 19
witnesses who watched him make no
more than three comments. He said
contrary testimony of two elderly
women was discredited by their
misidentification of him.
And he insisted testimony of two
other witnesses who said he was a
major disrupter has been shown to be
"so far from the truth as to be
worthless."
In his arguments Thursday,
administration lawyer Raymond Fisher
charged "patterns" in testimony of
Franklin's witnesses suggests they were
coached.
Franklin retorted that his witnesses
"back themselves up" because "they're
telling the truth."
WHITE PLAZA SPEECH
The other three charges against
Franklin involve alleged inciteful
speech. Klein said the incitement
charges "take us right back to the old
witch-hunting days."
Klein said speech is punishable only
if it calls for specific, serious illegal acts
and if the speech involves "purposeful"
incitement rather than only
"recklessness."
Franklin allegedly incited a Feb. 10
occupation of the Computation Center
during a speech at White Plaza. Klein
said Franklin's concern in his speech
"was not with tactics" but with
encouraging a campus-wide strike.
He said Franklin's call to "shut
down" the Computation Center did
"not on its face mean unlawful
conduct." Klein referred to peaceful
actions used during the Cambodia
strike in spring, 1970.
"At least a half dozen acts would be
legally shutting down the Comp
Center," Klein said.
DISPERSAL ORDER
Franklin is charged with inciting
resistance to a police dispersal order
after sheriff's deputies cleared
protesters out of the Comp Center.

Demonstrators would have left the
Comp Center peacefully if
administrators had given them written
confirmation that a war-related project
in the Comp Center had been cancelled,
Franklin said.
Franklin charged police were sent
"because the administration wanted
that confrontation. They were out for
blood and out to smash the
movement."
Klein insisted the administration had
no legal reason to declare an illegal
assembly outside the Comp Center.
Franklin said it is "laughable" for
the administration to charge that he
debated the order with police in an
effort to incite a confrontation.
Franklin insisted much of the crowd
was staying and a police charge seemed
inevitable unless faculty members
talked to police.
He pointed out that two faculty
witnesses testified that they should
have stayed after the dispersal order.
Franklin said that Professor Alan
Waterman, who testified that Franklin
incited the crowd, "tends to overdo his
testimony in his zeal."

Blasting Waterman's Defense
Department-sponsored research,
Franklin said, "If anybody ought to be
facing trial, it's Alan Waterman."
OLD UNION RALLY
Franklin is charged with inciting
campus violence during a nighttime Old
Union rally, Feb. 10. Franklin said
"that speech, like the speech at White
Plaza, was given after people had
already made up their minds."
Klein said Franklin gave a general
speech which "gave the people an
overall political rationale."
Franklin said, "Of all (the
administration's) witnesses, there isn't
one who heard the speech well or
understood it."
He said administration witnesses
heard "only fragments" of the speech.
Franklin claimed University News
Service Director Bob Beyers, who
charged Franklin moved the crowd to
action, "hears what he fancies he
hears."
Franklin insisted his phrase, "using
the methods of people's war," called
for organizing support rather than
violent confrontation with riot police
on campus.
"The people listening most
attentively went back to the dorms to
relate to the people who were not
there," Franklin argued.
Klein conceded that Franklin urged
the crowd to start late-night games of
"touch football" and otherwise confuse
the police on campus. Klein said the
administration wrongly argued Franklin
should have insisted that the crowd go
home to avoid clashes.
Klein said, "He will not run home
every time the police come on campus,
and he will not urge others to do that."
