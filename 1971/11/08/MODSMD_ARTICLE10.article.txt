# Hawkins Company Shows Strong Love Of Movement
## 
### CHRISTINE DOUGLAS 
Friday night, the Erick Hawkins Dance Company
presented the second of its two performances in
Memorial Auditorium. Before making any judgment
about the performance, one must first understand
the theories which underlie Hawkins' choreography.
Hawkins believes that Americans have wasted too
much time trying to imitate the traditional ballet
forms of the British and Russian schools, and
because we imitate, we remain second rate. He
maintains that Americans must develop their own
dance form, modern dance, to the fullest.
Hawkins looks to the Far East for an illustration
of the philosophy of modern dance which he is
trying to communicate. In direct opposition to the
principles of ballet, Eastern philosophy holds that
the human body is most beautiful in its natural and
untainted form. It need not be twisted or full of
tension in order to move gracefully.
Hawkins believes the the core of man's strength
lies in the solar plexus, and it is from there that all
movement must spring. According to this theory,
arms and legs move not as isolated units, but as
extensions of the movement originating in the solar
plexus. In this manner, the body moves as a
cohesive force.
Sense Of Immediacy
Hawkins is adamant in saying that art's efficacy
is dependent upon its ability to create a sense of
"immediacy". He hopes to do this not only through
totally natural movement, but also through live
music.
In his first piece, "Geography of Noon,"
Hawkins has choreographed some interesting
movement. He strengthens the impact of a
particular movement by making each dancer
consecutively echo it in a "chain reaction" manner.
He also changes his intensity level and therefore
most of the time keeps the audience in a state of
suspended anticipation.
There were several weak points in the dance,
however. Some of the movements lose their original
flavor through too much repetition. Also Hawkins'
solo proved too long and at times nerve-wracking
because he did not seem physically strong enough to
perform the movements.
With boxes, drum sticks and aluminum sheets,
the composer Lucia Dlugoszewski performed the
music on stage. Though she certainly did add to the

sense of "immediacy" which Hawkins attempts to
create, she interferes with the audience's
concentration.
Impending Danger
In his second piece, "Tightrope," Hawkins deals
symbolically with the precariousness of human life.
The witchlike movements of the chorus, Natalie
Richman, Lillo Way and Carol Conway, add most
effectively to the mysterious sense of impending
danger that pervades the dance. The lighting is
excellent and the props original. However, the
dance's intensity level does not change often
enough.
The dance opens on too forceful a note and
therefore a build-up of excitement is impossible. At
times, the dance becomes monotonous. Though
Hawkins' props are original, he does not use them
enough. Only once does a dancer even touch the
tightrope that is strung across the stage and Robert
Yohn carries a ladder on his back throughout the
entire dance without ever once touching or
removing it from his back.
In the third dance, "Angels of the Inmost
Heaven," the six dancers celebrate the beauty of the
human body in a semi-nude dance. When all the
dancers move in unison, the dance becomes very
forceful, because one gets the feeling that all men
are members of a unified "human race." However,
the harch geometric backdrop designed by Ralph
Dorazio and Rober Engstrom is not in keeping with
the dance's free-wheeling spontaneous movement.
The last piece "Cantilever" provided a fitting end
to the evening for through it Hawkins succeeds in
setting all his brilliant theories to work. The music
and dance become one, without intruding upon
each other. The costumes and stage set were in
perfect keeping with the mood of the music and
dance. The dancers are simultaneously steady and
fluent. A transcending sensuality seeps through each
of the dancers' movements. Special commendation
must be given to Robert Yohn whose animal-like
agility ruled the stage whenever he appeared in this
dance.
Overall, the performance was successful. Though
Hawkins perhaps falls short of his goals at some
point during each of his dances, he still manages to
transmit in all his works a love of movement for its
own sake, a breath-taking enthusiasm for the dance.

to the evening for through it Hawkins succeeds in
setting all his brilliant theories to work. The music
and dance become one, without intruding upon
each other. The costumes and stage set were in
perfect keeping with the mood of the music and
dance. The dancers are simultaneously steady and
fluent. A transcending sensuality seeps through each
of the dancers' movements. Special commendation
must be given to Robert Yohn whose animal-like
agility ruled the stage whenever he appeared in this
dance.
Overall, the performance was successful. Though
Hawkins perhaps falls short of his goals at some
point during each of his dances, he still manages to
transmit in all his works a love of movement for its
own sake, a breath-taking enthusiasm for the dance.
Friday night, the Erick Hawkins Dance Company
presented the second of its two performances in
Memorial Auditorium. Before making any judgment
about the performance, one must first understand
the theories which underlie Hawkins' choreography.
Hawkins believes that Americans have wasted too
much time trying to imitate the traditional ballet
forms of the British and Russian schools, and
because we imitate, we remain second rate. He
maintains that Americans must develop their own
dance form, modern dance, to the fullest.
Hawkins looks to the Far East for an illustration
of the philosophy of modern dance which he is
trying to communicate. In direct opposition to the
principles of ballet, Eastern philosophy holds that
the human body is most beautiful in its natural and
untainted form. It need not be twisted or full of
tension in order to move gracefully.
Hawkins believes the the core of man's strength
lies in the solar plexus, and it is from there that all
movement must spring. According to this theory,
arms and legs move not as isolated units, but as
extensions of the movement originating in the solar
plexus. In this manner, the body moves as a
cohesive force.
Sense Of Immediacy
Hawkins is adamant in saying that art's efficacy
is dependent upon its ability to create a sense of
"immediacy". He hopes to do this not only through
totally natural movement, but also through live
music.
In his first piece, "Geography of Noon,"
Hawkins has choreographed some interesting
movement. He strengthens the impact of a
particular movement by making each dancer
consecutively echo it in a "chain reaction" manner.
He also changes his intensity level and therefore
most of the time keeps the audience in a state of
suspended anticipation.
There were several weak points in the dance,
however. Some of the movements lose their original
flavor through too much repetition. Also Hawkins'
solo proved too long and at times nerve-wracking
because he did not seem physically strong enough to
perform the movements.
With boxes, drum sticks and aluminum sheets,
the composer Lucia Dlugoszewski performed the
music on stage. Though she certainly did add to the

sense of "immediacy" which Hawkins attempts to
create, she interferes with the audience's
concentration.
Impending Danger
In his second piece, "Tightrope," Hawkins deals
symbolically with the precariousness of human life.
The witchlike movements of the chorus, Natalie
Richman, Lillo Way and Carol Conway, add most
effectively to the mysterious sense of impending
danger that pervades the dance. The lighting is
excellent and the props original. However, the
dance's intensity level does not change often
enough.
The dance opens on too forceful a note and
therefore a build-up of excitement is impossible. At
times, the dance becomes monotonous. Though
Hawkins' props are original, he does not use them
enough. Only once does a dancer even touch the
tightrope that is strung across the stage and Robert
Yohn carries a ladder on his back throughout the
entire dance without ever once touching or
removing it from his back.
In the third dance, "Angels of the Inmost
Heaven," the six dancers celebrate the beauty of the
human body in a semi-nude dance. When all the
dancers move in unison, the dance becomes very
forceful, because one gets the feeling that all men
are members of a unified "human race." However,
the harch geometric backdrop designed by Ralph
Dorazio and Rober Engstrom is not in keeping with
the dance's free-wheeling spontaneous movement.
The last piece "Cantilever" provided a fitting end
to the evening for through it Hawkins succeeds in
setting all his brilliant theories to work. The music
and dance become one, without intruding upon
each other. The costumes and stage set were in
perfect keeping with the mood of the music and
