# Placement Center
## Protesters Enter Again 
### 
For the third time in as many
days last Friday, demonstrators
entered the Stanford Placement
Center to show their disapproval
of its use by recruiters from
defense related industries.
About 20 protesters, most of
them students, walked briefly
through the interview area in the
back of the Center, following a
forty minute rally outside.
Two of the speakers at the
rally of about 100 to 150 people
criticized the previous day's
mill-in at the Center.
One speaker, * identifying
himself as a member of the
Worker's League, told the crowd
they were wasting their time
trying to force the University
administration to change. "They

don't give a damn what you
think," he said.
Soon after, a freshman holding
pacifist views condemned the use
of coercion in disrupting
Thursday's recruitment
interviews. Referring to the
political philosophy of some

groups which took part he said he
was "opposed to all forms of guns
and militancy .... You are lost
when you become like those you
oppose.
"I accuse you not of
hypocrisy, but I accuse you of
delusion." he added.
