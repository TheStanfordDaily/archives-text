# Poloists Outfoul Bruins And Lose

### DOUG WILSON 
The Stanford water polo team
was trailing UCLA 10-8 in the
fourth quarter, and needed three
quick goals to win the game;
instead, UCLA got the goals, the
Pacific-8 conference
championship, and a
psychological edge for the NCAA
championships by beating
Stanford 13-10 before a packed
Encina pool stadium Saturday.
Unable to capitalize on a
two-point lead which they
managed to maintain for most of
the first half, the Indians saw their
chances for victory, and a share of
the Pacific-8 title, dwindle at the
half, and put out of reach in the
fourth quarter by Bruin field
players Bob Ramsey and Carl
Thomas, whose successful shots
past Stanford goalie Pete Gadd
late in the fourth quarter clinched
the game for Coach Bob Horn's
UCLA squad.
Indians Pressured
Stanford, on the other hand,
was hard-pressed to penetrate the
UCLA goal, defended well by
veteran goalie Kevin Craig. Craig's
suc<J£Ssful block of Stanford
captain Rick Massimino's
second-quarter penalty shot
seemed to demoralize the
Stanford offense, which managed
only three goals in the second
half. Massimino himself was a
victim of a communications
mix-up, leaving the game in the
third quarter for committing five
fouls, after being told minutes
before that he had only
committed three fouls.
Joining Massimino on the
sidelines for the five-foul limit
were first-string offensive players
Mike Davis (out in the second

quarter), Bill Simpkins and Rob
Wooley (both out in the fourth
quarter). Massimino, Simpkins
and Davis were responsible for six
of Stanford's ten goals, the others
being provided by Ken Hammer
and Randy Wilkins.
UCLA scoring was led by
Garth Bergeson, with three goals.
With two games remaining on
their season schedule, the Indians
must now begin to prepare for the
NCAA championships to be held
over Thanksgiving vacation in
Long Beach. The Indians will
probably be seeded third in the
tournament because of their
defeats to San Jose State and
UCLA.

ROSE BOWL BOUND—Don Bunce, Dennis Sheehan, and Benny Barnes played big roles in Stanford's
20-9 win over UCLA which, combined with WSU's loss to USC, has assured the Indians of the Pac-8 title.
Above, Benny Barnes sprints downfield with his first interception as Tim Robnett throws a beautiful
diving block on a UCLA defender. Below, Bunce is shown preparing to pass while Sheehan gives him
projection. Following non-conference clashes with San Jose State and Cal, the Indians will prepare for
their New Year's Day battle with the Big Ten champion which will probably be the powerful Wolverines
of Michigan.
