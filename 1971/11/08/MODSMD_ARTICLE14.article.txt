## 
### 
Chuck Taylor, athletic director at Stanford since 1963 ,
announced Friday, that he is stepping aside from his
position to initiate a nine-month leave of absence commencing
Jan.1,1972.
In typical Taylor fashion, he describes his plans for a
prolonged vacation as "no big deal. It's just that much has been
done in recent years and it's time for a rest. I know that my wife
and kids feel that way, too, so we are just going to call time-out
for the next three quarters, stand back and see what's going on in
the world.
"We might travel a little bit, but, mostly I just want to relax
and find some time to do other things. I will continue to be active
in a volunteer capacity in both the Buck Club Fund Drive efforts
and also the Capital Funding Campaign for our new swimming
and handball complex. Right at the moment, I am looking
forward to simply resting and relaxing, and I'm just not going to
let myself worry about the day-to-day responsibilities of our
athletic program until at least Oct. 1,1972."
Bob Young, who has been at the Athletic Department since
1 948 will move up from "assistant" to "acting" athletic director,
and Business Manager Bob Butler will expand the scope of his
responsibilities in Taylor's absence. No other changes are
anticipated within the administrative structure of the department
at this time.
