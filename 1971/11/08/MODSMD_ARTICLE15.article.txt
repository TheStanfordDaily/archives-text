# Frosh Gridders Mauled, 62-6

### MIKE HERMAN 
In one of the more forgettable
games ever played »r« the Stanford
Stadium, a fired-up Brubabe team
from UCLA demolished the
Stanford Frosh, 62-6, in the
preliminary to the Rose Bowl
decider. With the triumph, the
UCLA fans gained some measure
of satisfaction in an otherwise
disappointing trip up North.
The Bruin Frosh came into the
game as heavy favorites, but the
resulting game was not even that
close as the Indians could not
cope with UCLA either
offensively or defensively. It can
be said about many teams that

they can explode offensively at
any minute. In this game, it
became apparent that UCLA
would score at will if they so
desired. The previously
highly-touted "Thunder Chick"
defense managed to show the
several thousand fans that showed
up for the game many holes that
had previously gone unnoticed.
The Bruins ran over and through
the Indians all day, to such a
degree that the Frosh defense
often left the field amid derisive
applause for the primary act of
holding the Brubabes scoreless on
a drive.
Touchdown Run
Perhaps the first two plays of
the game help sum up the total
effort by both teams. On the first
play after the opening kickoff,
Bruin halfback Mike Owens took
a pitch from his quarterback on
the 34 and rambled 66 yards for a
touchdown. Then, following the
UCLA kickoff, the Indians
managed to sustain a thirteen yard
loss on the first play from
scrimmage, when quarterback Bob
Glick was dumped on his own

fifteen yeard line.
From then on, the game got
completely out of hand, with the
Bruins piling up twenty-one
points in the first four minutes of
the ball game. By the time the
first half was over, the score had
reached 35-0, and the ball game
was all but over.
Balanced Scoring
For the Bruins, the scoring was
balanced, with four of the scores
coming on runs, two on pass
plays, and the final touchdown on
a long pass interception. The two
UCLA running backs, Mike Owens
and Matt Fall, provided the spark.
On defense, UCLA, by the general
consensus of the Stanford team,
was even more brutal than that of
USC. On almost every tackle there
were three or four Bruins
smothering the ball carrier.
The Indians now have two
weeks to recover before the Cal
game, having completed this
year's encounters with the USC
and UCLA freshmen who ran up a
total of 100 points against the
Stanford frosh while allowing
only six points.
