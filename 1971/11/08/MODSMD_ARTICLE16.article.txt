# March Has Everything But People
## 
### CHRIS PECK Commentary 
Saturday was a good day for a
march. The skies were clear, there were
plenty of good speakers, lots of good
music and of course the issue of a
seemingly endless War. But there was
one factor that made the third
November 6th Moratorium march in
San Francisco disappointing. There
weren't any people.
Perhaps 30,000 demonstrators
filtered in and out of the Polo Grounds
in San Francisco trying to keep the Bay
Area anti-war movement alive. And
while those who did march were in a
festive, constructive mood, the most
significant aspect of the march and

rally was the fact that so many people
stayed away.
Last March, more than 150,000
demonstrators turned out to protest
the Vietnam disaster. In November of
1969, more than 250,000 protesters
assembled in Golden Gate Park to
protest. What happened to those people
Saturday?
Probably many in the Bay Area have
grown tired of marching and
demonstrating, and many others
evidently believe that the war is coming
to a close now. Further marching isn't
going to speed up the process. But, as
Stephanie Cootz, National Coordinator
of the National Peace Action Coalition
(NPAC) told demonstrators on
Saturday, "one of the most shocking

aspects of the War is the fact that we've
gotten used to it."
"In my opinion, the anti-war
movement is entering its most critical
stage now." Cootz added, "and it's sad
that people are beginning to be bored
with the whole movement just because
the government is mounting an all-out
campaign to convince the people that
American war efforts are ending around
the world."
Citing such events as the Amchitka
atomic bomb test and the Angela Davis
trial, Cootz concluded that "we know
too much now to stop our protesting
because the government tries to
convince us that it is changing it's
policies."
One of the big differences in this

year's march and rally compared to
such events in the past however, was
the diffuse nature of the issues drawing
people to the event. Where in the past,
the Vietnam War was a big enough
drawing card to attract large numbers
of people, this year it took a variety of
issues even to attract 30,000
demonstrators.
By far the biggest response from the
crowd came at 2:00 p.m. Saturday
afternoon at the time when the
5-megaton Amchitka hydrogen bomb
was detonated. Standing in silence with
clenched fists and peace signs raised,
the crowd roared it's approval when 20
white doves were set loose overhead to
counter what one speaker called "the
terrible and useless scarring of the
Mother Earth."
Other Issues
There were a dozen other issues that
brought people to Golden Gate Park
Saturday too. A delegation of sailors
from the USS Coral Sea spoke to the
crowd about their efforts to keep the
ship from returning to Vietnam.
The sailors said that many of the
leaders of the Stop Our Ship movement
had been "politically discharged from
the Navy and politically persecuted by
the Navy," but vowed that the Coral
Sea would not set sail November 9th
for Vietnam.
A spokesman for Angela Davis spoke
of the "two wars in America, one
conducted in Vietnam against the third
world and one at home against the
black, red, brown and yellow people of
this country."
And there were spokesmen for Gay
Liberation, Hare Krishna, the Socialist
Labor Party, and Jesus Christ. This last
group gave away free lemonade and
cookies to demonstrators as they
arrived at the Polo Grounds.
Diversity
The very fact that there were so
many diverse and specialized issues that
needed attention may have been part of
the reason so few people took interest
in a continuing effort against the War
on Saturday.
For whatever reason, it looks as
though people are through going into
the streets over Vietnam. Perhaps a new
issue will bring people back to a frame
of mind where it seems important to
march and demonstrate but on
Saturday, there were clearly other
things that people thought were more
important that a march against the War.
And as one National Peace Action
Coalition member confessed at the end
of the rally, I know there are still a
great many people in this country who
need to be reached about what is going
on in Indochina, but I'm not sure
where we're going to go from here to
reach those people."
