Amchitka Called 'Success'
AMCHITKA, Alaska â€” Atomic Energy Commission scientists began yesterday
analyzing data from Saturday's successful underground explosion. The AEC also
started work to restore this remote island to its natural state.
"I am confident from the data we have now that a repeat of this test won't be
necessary," said Major General Edward Ciller, the AEC's assistant general manager
for military applications, of the nearly five megaton blast.
Despite predictions by opponents of the test that the explosion might cause
environmental damage, there were no destructive earthquakes or seismic sea waves
and no radiation leakage into the atmosphere.
