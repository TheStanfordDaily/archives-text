# Gore Says Muskie-Adlai Ticket Can Beat Nixon
## 
### 
Former U.S. Senator Albert Gore
yesterday said he believed a ticket of
Senator Edmund Muskie for President
and Senator Adlai E. Stevenson 111 of
Illinois for Vice-President stood the
best chance of defeating the
Republican ticket in 1972.
Speaking to well over 100 people in
the Annenburg Auditorium of the
Cummings Art Building, Gore said that
the Muskie-Stevenson ticket "would fit
the American electorate like an old
shoe."
Gore was defeated last year in his
bid to be reelected to a fourth term in
the Senate. He was the primary target
of Vice President Agnew's attack upon
Senate "radic-libs."
Gore said that he preferred to call
the radic-libs "the voices of reason in
the Senate. From whence have you
heard the challenge to the morality and
legality of the war in Vietnam come?",
he asked. Answering his own question,
he specifically mentioned a few
"courageous" Senators and"the
students on our nation's college
campuses."
'Extermination'
He condemned our Vietnam
intervention as participation in "a war
of extermination in the name of
self-determination and democracy."
The former Tennessee Senator also
spoke of the Council for a Livable

World, of which he is the Washington,
D.C. Chairman.
He said that the Council has two
major aims: "to inform, to inspire
intellectual curiosity, to arouse interest
and action from the American people"
and particularly from the U.S. Senate;
and also "to help elect and retain the
voices of reason in the Senate."
Amchitka-Denounced
The former Senator denounced the
test Saturday of the five megaton
nuclear device on Arnchitka as
"completely unnecessary." He said that
the likely success of the Strategic Arms
Limitation Talks (SALT) would
eliminate the need for developing or
testing any nuclear weaponry in the
future.
In discussing the 1972 elections,
Gore said that he believed that "a
majority, if not a massive majority, of
the electorate has become disenchanted
with President Nixon's leadership." He
identified what he thought would be
the three major campaign issues next
year as American prestige, the state of
the economy and the eight year
absence of credibility from our
government.
Gore's wife, Pauline, will speak at
noon today in Crothers Pub, which is
located in the basement of Cruthers
Hall. She practices law along with her
husband in Memphis and Washington.

CHANGING TIMES?—Last May over 250,000 demonstrators jammed the Polo
Grounds in Golden Gate Park to protest the Vietnam War. Last Saturday was
another perfect day for a march, but few people took advantage of the
opportunity this time. No more than 30,000 turned out to protest.
