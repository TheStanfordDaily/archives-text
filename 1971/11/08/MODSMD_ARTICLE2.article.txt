# Moderates Lead List
## ASSU Senate Results Released 
### GLENN GARVIN 
The moderate "Q" slate made the strongest showing in
the ASSU Student Senate elections, winning seven of the
available 30 seats, elections Commissioner Alice Furumoto
announced yesterday.
Furumoto released the verified results of the October 26
and 27 elections yesterday afternoon, and Q led the list,
followed by the radical Coalition for Community Control
(CCC) with four seats. The Black Student Union didn't run
an organized slate of candidates, but four candidates
identified with the BSU won.
Phillip Farell and Norman Fogelsong were elected from
Undergraduate Engineering and Earth Sciences to give Q a
clean sweep in that division. John Bradley and Buck Schott
won in Undergraduate General Studies under the Q banner,
while Brent Appel, Mark Terry, and Kathy Waller all won
seats in Undergraduate Humanities, Sciences and Medicine.
Coalition Represented
The CCC will be represented by Betsy won
an uncontested race in Graduate Humanities and
Sciences—as well as Peter Knutson in Undergraduate
General Studies, Jennifer Springer in Undergrad
Humanities, and Peter Goldscheider, of Graduates in Law.
Goldscheider is a member of Venceremos, and acted as one
of the counsels for Bruce Franklin in the dismissal hearing
of the Maoist professor.
Willie Newberry, a former chairman of the BSU who was
suspended after last year's hospital sit-in, was uncontested
in his race for the Senate from Graduate Humanities.
Woodrow Myers, a member of the Senate nominating
committee last year, was another BSU member elected.
Former Senator James Jefferson, Jr. and Linda Wright, who
acted as secretary for the body last year, rounded out the
group identified with the BSU.
Among the more prominent conservatives elected were
Chris Hocker, chairman of the right-wing Free Campus
Movement (FCM) who edits the conservative newspaper,
Arena, and Ray White, a former FCM chairman who had no
opposition in Graduate Humanities and Sciences.
John McNeece, who predicated his campaign on

rebuilding the peace movement, was chosen by voters in
Undergrad Humanities, as well as veteran Senator Scott
Burke, who pushed for reform of the Tresidder Food
Service.
Freshman Power
Appeals to "freshman power" spelled victory for
sponsor John Coghlan, and Dan Cummings. Two major
surprises came when Rocky Barber, a senator last year, and
Mike Dawson, who was Senate chairman last session, failed
to be elected. Both now intend to run for chairman of the
Senate. Herbie Borock, last year's parliamentarian, is also in
the race for the chair.
The first senate meeting will be Thursday night, Diane
Fields of the ASSU Council of Presidents announced. The
meeting will deal with approving Senate committee
appointments and setting up a committee to decide what
organizations will be excluded from appearing at the
placement center on the basis of war production.
The Senate must also deal with problems surrounding
the Stanford Judicial Council (SJC) sometime in the near
future.
Furumoto's announcement of the winners concluded an
election filled with foul-ups. From nominations—lo seats
from the graduate sectors weren't filled because no one
signed up for them—to voting—one election was invalidated
due to utter confusion about voting procedures—to
results—which were two days late after difficulty in
counting ballots. Little went right.

of the Maoist professor.
Willie Newberry, a former chairman of the BSU who was

sponsor John Coghlan, and Dan Cummings. Two major
surprises came when Rocky Barber, a senator last year, and
Mike Dawson, who was Senate chairman last session, failed

the race for the chair.
The first senate meeting will be Thursday night, Diane

The Senate must also deal with problems surrounding
the Stanford Judicial Council (SJC) sometime in the near
future.
