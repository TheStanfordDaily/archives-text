# Student Leaders Begin 'Dump Nixon' Drive
## 
### 
Student body presidents of 18 Bay
Area colleges met in San Francisco
Friday to launch a campaign to register
the youth vote. They aim to "dump"
President Nixon and insure
proportionate representation of the
young, women and minorities at the
1972 conventions.
The group also announced plans for
an emergency conference of new voters
at Maples Pavilion, Thursday,
November 18.
Principal speakers will be Cong. Paul
McCloskey (R-San Mateo) and Allard
Lowenstein, architect of the 1968
"Dump Johnson" movement. John
Kaye of Steppenwolf will perform.
Larry Diamond, ASSU Council of
Presidents, expects "over 1 500 leaders
of high schools, colleges, minority and
adult groups to attend."
The conference will seek to enforce
guidelines of the Democratic Party's
McGovern Commission and the
Republican Party's Commission on
Delegates and Organization. Petitions
will be circulated demanding
representation of young people,
women, and minority groups in
delegate slates to next year's party
conventions.
Larry Diamond and co-president
Doug McHenry were among those
student body leaders signing an open
letter to both national party chairmen.
The letter points to the great impact
young voters can have in next year's
presidential election, but adds that the
opportunity could slip away.
"Many of us worked for Eugene

McCarthy and Robert Kennedy in
1968," said the statement.
"We learned that the structure of
the old politics buckles under hard
pressure, correctly applied. The power
elite did not deny us the Presidency in
1968; an assasin did, and while that
tragedy is still incredible, it does not
convince us that the political system
can repel all efforts to change it."
The student body presidents
outlined the strategy for applying their
strength. "We can agree on the need to
unite in opposing candidates of either
of your parties who fail to fulfill the
letter or the spirit of recommendations
such as these."
The letter concluded with a plea to
national party chairmen Lawrence
O'Brien and Robert Dole "to do
everything in your power to insure that
your candidates respect our legitimate
demands."
An outgrowth of Friday's meeting,
the Steering Committee for an
Emergency Conference of New Voters
stated that in 1968 the electoral
process "deprived us of any satisfactory
choice and left us with echoes .. . (and)
we are close to repeating the mistake."
Though they did not agree on any one
candidate they pledged to unite in
opposing any candidate who refuses to
respect their demands.
There are no plans beyond
Thursday's rally other than the
"enthusiasm we leave behind," says
Doug McHenry, of the ASSU Council
of Presidents, who also attended the
news conference.

arguments Friday to a standing ovation from an SRO audience. To see who laughs
best people will probably have to wait a month before the Advisory Board renders
its decision.
