# Back To The Rose Bowl--Indians Dump UCLA, 20-9!
## 
### HALL DAILY CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
. . the new king is beginning to realize how very good he really is."
The Stanford Indians captured their second straight Pac-8 crown Saturday and
a return trip to Pasadena January 1 as they calmly downed the UCLA Bruins 20-9.
Minutes after the Stanford contest, the race for the roses was ended as thousands
of lingering fans cheered the announcement that Southern California, the old king
of West Coast foot hall, had held on for a 30-20 victory over the insurgent
Washington State Cougars.
A throng of 61,000 spectators watched Stanford struggle to a 3-3 halftime
deadlock. The Indians opened the second half, however, with an 83 yard scoring
drive and capitalized on two fourth quarter interceptions to drive to a convincing
victory over the hapless Bruins.
With a strong running attack and an excellent kicking game, the Uclans
dominated the first half by keeping Stanford deep in its own territory. Benny
Barnes' interception of Scott Henderson's second pass attempt of the game set up
Stanford's only score in the first half on Rod Garcia's 33 yard field goal. UCLA's
only score had come earlier in the second quarter on Efren Herrera's 21 yard field
goal after the Thunder Chickens had held the Bruins to three yards in three plays
inside the seven yard line. -•>»
Not Playing Relaxed football
Stanford's lackluster first half performance prompted Coacb John Ralston's
comment after the game, "It is hard for me to figure out whatbur team is going
to do. We're just not playing good, solid, relaxed football."
Delighted with his team's second half comeback, Ralston observed, "We've
faced pressure all season, but we know how to respond to irpressure situation."
Coach and team alike were excited at the prospect of another trip,
but as Ralston beamed, "The first time is the winning cortfference
championships is always a thrill. I am sure that we will respond very jiicely. It is a
cherished responsibility representing the Pltc-8. After last January's Rose Bowl
victory, Don Bunce said that we would be back in the liowl^and we are.'
While the team has exhibited similar confidence all season, critics had made
USC the solid favorite,,followed closely behind by Washington and Oregon. The
Indians soundly defeated all three of these opponents on their way to clinching
the Pac-8 title with a 5-1 conference record.
'Something Else'
Presumably, Stanford will face highly-touted Michigan on New Year's Day.
When questioned about the powerful Wolverines, Ralston simply said, "They are
something else."
Commenting further on the probable Big Ten champions who have thus far
outscored their conference rivals 239-4 6 on their way to a perfect 6-0 league log,
Ralston said "Michigan is sure to be the decisive favorite, but that brings the best
out of our guys. The squad is aware of this (Michigan's strength) and will attack
things differently."
