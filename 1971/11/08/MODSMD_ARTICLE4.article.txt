# Back To The Rose Bowl--Indians Dump UCLA, 20-9!
## 
### HALL DAILY CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
. . the new king is beginning to realize how very good he really is."
The Stanford Indians captured their second straight Pac-8 crown Saturday and
a return trip to Pasadena January 1 as they calmly downed the UCLA Bruins 20-9.
Minutes after the Stanford contest, the race for the roses was ended as thousands
of lingering fans cheered the announcement that Southern California, the old king
of West Coast foot hall, had held on for a 30-20 victory over the insurgent
Washington State Cougars.
A throng of 61,000 spectators watched Stanford struggle to a 3-3 halftime
deadlock. The Indians opened the second half, however, with an 83 yard scoring
drive and capitalized on two fourth quarter interceptions to drive to a convincing
victory over the hapless Bruins.
With a strong running attack and an excellent kicking game, the Uclans
dominated the first half by keeping Stanford deep in its own territory. Benny
Barnes' interception of Scott Henderson's second pass attempt of the game set up
Stanford's only score in the first half on Rod Garcia's 33 yard field goal. UCLA's
only score had come earlier in the second quarter on Efren Herrera's 21 yard field
goal after the Thunder Chickens had held the Bruins to three yards in three plays
inside the seven yard line. -•>»
Not Playing Relaxed football
Stanford's lackluster first half performance prompted Coacb John Ralston's
comment after the game, "It is hard for me to figure out whatbur team is going
to do. We're just not playing good, solid, relaxed football."
Delighted with his team's second half comeback, Ralston observed, "We've
faced pressure all season, but we know how to respond to irpressure situation."
Coach and team alike were excited at the prospect of another trip,
but as Ralston beamed, "The first time is the winning cortfference
championships is always a thrill. I am sure that we will respond very jiicely. It is a
cherished responsibility representing the Pltc-8. After last January's Rose Bowl
victory, Don Bunce said that we would be back in the liowl^and we are.'
While the team has exhibited similar confidence all season, critics had made
USC the solid favorite,,followed closely behind by Washington and Oregon. The
Indians soundly defeated all three of these opponents on their way to clinching
the Pac-8 title with a 5-1 conference record.
'Something Else'
Presumably, Stanford will face highly-touted Michigan on New Year's Day.
When questioned about the powerful Wolverines, Ralston simply said, "They are
something else."
Commenting further on the probable Big Ten champions who have thus far
outscored their conference rivals 239-4 6 on their way to a perfect 6-0 league log,
Ralston said "Michigan is sure to be the decisive favorite, but that brings the best
out of our guys. The squad is aware of this (Michigan's strength) and will attack
things differently."

According to UCLA's freshman
coach Ron Nay who has scouted
both teams, "Stanford is an
outstanding football team,
comparable to Michigan in overall
strength, with the Indians having
the offensive edge and the
Wolverines, perhaps, being slightly
better on defense."
But Michigan had wrapped up
a 63-7 victory over lowa Saturday
while the Indians were in the
locker room tied at 3-3 with a
stubborn UCLA team which had
confronted the Wolverine's power
earlier this season and received a
38-0 beating.
Penalties Plague Drives
First half penalties plagued the
Indians once again, as three
holding infractions stalled three
out of Stanford's six drives. The
defense was able to keep the
Indians in the game, however, as
they were more consistent in
stopping the triple option that
almost put the team out of the
Rose Bowl picture over the last
two weekends.
The "Thunder Chickens" held
the Bruins to 132 yards on the
ground, generally frustrating Scott
Henderson's option attempts.
Ralston credited Jeff Siemon and
Mike Simone with the prime
responsibility for stopping the
option.
The Indians allowed 91 of the
Bruin's total rushing yards in the
first half, however, with most of
them coming on a 67 yard drive
to the Stanford four yard line at
the beginning of the second
quarter. Roger Cowan, Siemon,
and Simone came up with
touchdown saving tackles on the
last three plays of that drive and

Herrera had to kick a 21 yard
field goal.
With 6:47 left in the half,
Benny Barnes intercepted his first
pass of the afternoon and moved
13 yards to the Bruin 47. A 21
yard pass from Bunce to Reggie
Sanderson moved the ball to the
26, where the drive stalled and
Garcia came in to kick his game
tying field goal. His kick tied the
Pac-8 record of 13 field goals in
one season held by Randy
Wersching of Cal. Garcia kicked
another in the fourth quarter to
break the record.
Mike Boryla quarterbacked the

Indians last offensive series of the
first half, and Bunce's absence
caused considerable consternation
among the fans. After the game,
Ralston laughed, "Evidently, he
swallowed some grass that stuck
in his throat. He could barely talk,
and he was afraid that no one
could hear his signals."
Bunce recovered, however, and
threw five passes to keep alive the
opening drive of the second half
that covered 87 yards. Capping
the drive, Bunce rolled around his
right end and covered the last six
yards unmolested to give the
Indians a 10 -3 lead as Garcia made

good on the extra point.
There was no more scoring in
the third quarter, and after
Garcia's record breaking field goal
early in the fourth quarter set up
by Randy Poltl's interception,
Benny Barnes intercepted his
second pass and returned it 16
yards to the UCLA 29. Bunce hit
Miles Moore on the Indians' first
play for a touchdown, ending the
Cards' scoring.
Defensively, Larry Butler
played an outstanding game and
made 10 tackles.
