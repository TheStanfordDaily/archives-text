## Reinstate Franklin 
### 
The charges against Bruce Franklin should be
dropped, and he should be allowed to return to his
formal teaching activities.
After six weeks of hearings, it is clear that
Franklin did not commit the acts with which he is
charged, and that his conduct at the Lodge speech
January 1 I and at White Plaza, the Computation
Center, and the Old Union courtyard February 10
in no way "constituted a substantial and manifest
neglect of duty and substantial impairment of the
performance of his appropriate functions within the
University community,"
We feel that a careful examination of the
evidence will show that Franklin's actions on those
days do not justify punishment.
Bruce Franklin is a committed revolutionary, but
everyone involved agrees that this is not the issue.
He can only be punished if proven guilty of the
specific acts with which he is charged.
We do not believe that "substantial evidence" has
been presented on any of the charges. "Almost
guilty" is not enough. He cannot be punished for
having unpopular ideas, or expressing them in
militant ways which make the administration
uncomfortable.
Franklin has said that he deliberately chose to
tailor his conduct to fall within the limits of
university regulations. We believe that the evidence
has shown that he did do this.
The charges concerning the disruption of the
Lodge Speech January 1 1, raise grave questions of
freedom of speech. We do not believe that the
Lodge speech should have been stopped, but
heckling controversial speakers, while often rude
and unpleasant, is a necessary right when other
avenues of communication are denied.
It seems that Franklin offered two or three
comments during the speeches before Lodge's and
clearly was not a significant participant in the
disruption.
The administration has produced four major
witnesses on this charge. Two of these witnesses,
Catherine Matthews and Frances Beckwith,
misidentified Franklin, which discredits their
testimony.
The testimony of Christine Jacobs and Paul
Hanley that Franklin was a persistent disrupter is
controverted by I c > defense witnesses, seated near
Franklin and also in scattered locations throughout
Dinkelspiel. They heard Franklin shout two, or
perhaps three times, none during Lodge's speech
itself.
The testimony of Peter Geier and David Laney,
neither of whom joined in the demonstration, and
who sat directly in front of Franklin, contradicts
testimony that Franklin chanted, clapped
rhythmically, and "got the crowd going again"
during the speech.
Attorney Fisher's argument that repititious
"patterns of testimony" by Franklin's witnesses
indicated "that their testimony had been pretty
well coached or at least prepared," is a pernicious
view of the value of corroborative testimony. As
Franklin pointed out Friday, "it could very well
mean that they were telling the truth."
The three remaining charges involve alleged
incitement of illegal activity. Incitement charges
must be carefully proven, because they often
involve the borders between protected free speech
and prohibited action.
The vigorous exchange of ideas on this campus
demands that Stanford at least match the
protections afforded by outside courts. Franklin's
vague exhortations cannot be punished without
creating a tremendous chilling effect on the speech
of everyone on campus.
Franklin's speech to a noon rally at White Plaza
February 10, was not a case of such incitement to
commit specific acts. The Administration
contention, that it was Franklin's speech which
caused the crowd to move to the Computation
Center and begin an occupation there, is refuted by
much defense testimony.
First, he cannot be credited with creating the
Comp Center demonstration because the crowd had
decided what to do before he spoke. The
administration seems to ignore the context of
political literature and meetings in the days

preceeding February 10, with its claim that it was
Franklin's brief speech which convinced people of
the necessity to shut down the computer facility. It
is doubtful, in light of defense testimony and past
radical tradition, that the White Plaza rally was
meant to change anyone's mind.
If we remember that there was a four-hour
meeting at Dinkelspiel, the night before, where the
questions of war-related research at the
Computation Center, and possible means of halting
such research were discussed at length, it becomes
clear that the White Plaza rally was, as a defense
witness testified, "somewhere to go before going to
the Computation Center."
His speech seems to be, as he claims, a theoretical
analysis presenting his perspective on the
possibilities for a strike such as that two years ago
after the Cambodian invasion.
Franklin did use the word "shutdown" in
referring to the Comp Center, but he had earlier
defined shutdown in terms of a "fake strike" or a
voluntary boycott.
The administration has implied that Franklin
neglected his professional duties by not talking the
demonstrators out of their protest. It is specious to
suggest that a professor's job requires
propagandizing against protest.
The administration has also failed to prove that
Franklin's actions on the Comp Center lawn
"significantly interferred with orderly dispersal by
intentionally urging and inciting students and other
persons present at the Computation Center to
disregard or disobey such orders to disperse," as
alleged.
Franklin appears to have attempted
unsuccessfully to incite several faculty members,
including Lincoln Moses and Charles Stein, to stay
in the area as faculty observers. He also argued with
Sargeant Don Tamm as to the legality of the
dispersal order.
The administration contention that Franklin was
urging a dispersing crowd to return and confront the
police seems unsupported. Moses and Stein now
think that they should have stayed, and Stein has
gone as far as to say that he now feels that the
arguments Franklin directed to him were correct,
and that Franklin meant to protect students from a
possible police charge.
It appears that both of Franklin's discussions at
the Comp Center were aimed at lessening the
possibility of a police charge. It also appears that
Franklin's right to question Tamm about the
legality of the dispersal order is protected by the
First Amendment to the Constitution.
We also feel that the administration has failed to
show that Franklin's two speeches during the Old
Union courtyard rally the evening of February 10
"urged and incited students and other persons
present to engage in conduct calculated to disrupt
university functions and business and which
threatened injury to individuals and property," as
charged.
Again, Franklin spoke in general theoretical
terms, without advocating specific illegal acts. The
fact that "shortly thereafter students and other
persons were assaulted by persons present at the
rally, and later that evening other acts of violence
occurred," has not been shown to be attributable to
Franklin's speeches.
Franklin's use of the phrase "use the methods of
People's War" has been seized on by the
administration as a kind of code phrase by which
Franklin was telling the crowd to commit acts of
violence.
"People's War" has been used extensively in
Maoist literature not only in reference to warfare,
but also in terms of building broadly based political
movements. Again, Franklin did not specifically
propagandize against violence, but seemed more
intent on urging people to go back to the dorms and
begin building a campus wide protest.
The Advisory Board should recommend that
Franklin's suspension be lifted, and that he be
allowed to remain on the faculty with no
discriminatory effect on his future possibilities for
salary increases or promotion.
The charges against Bruce Franklin should be
dropped, and he should be allowed to return to his
formal teaching activities.

witness testified, "somewhere to go before going to
the Computation Center."
His speech seems to be, as he claims, a theoretical
analysis presenting his perspective on the
possibilities for a strike such as that two years ago
after the Cambodian invasion.
Franklin did use the word "shutdown" in
referring to the Comp Center, but he had earlier
defined shutdown in terms of a "fake strike" or a
voluntary boycott.
The administration has implied that Franklin
neglected his professional duties by not talking the
demonstrators out of their protest. It is specious to
suggest that a professor's job requires
propagandizing against protest.
The administration has also failed to prove that
Franklin's actions on the Comp Center lawn
"significantly interferred with orderly dispersal by
intentionally urging and inciting students and other
persons present at the Computation Center to
disregard or disobey such orders to disperse," as
alleged.
Franklin appears to have attempted
unsuccessfully to incite several faculty members,
including Lincoln Moses and Charles Stein, to stay
in the area as faculty observers. He also argued with
Sargeant Don Tamm as to the legality of the
dispersal order.
The administration contention that Franklin was
urging a dispersing crowd to return and confront the
police seems unsupported. Moses and Stein now
think that they should have stayed, and Stein has
gone as far as to say that he now feels that the
arguments Franklin directed to him were correct,
and that Franklin meant to protect students from a
possible police charge.
It appears that both of Franklin's discussions at
the Comp Center were aimed at lessening the
possibility of a police charge. It also appears that
Franklin's right to question Tamm about the
legality of the dispersal order is protected by the
First Amendment to the Constitution.
We also feel that the administration has failed to
show that Franklin's two speeches during the Old
Union courtyard rally the evening of February 10
"urged and incited students and other persons
present to engage in conduct calculated to disrupt
university functions and business and which
threatened injury to individuals and property," as
charged.
Again, Franklin spoke in general theoretical
terms, without advocating specific illegal acts. The
fact that "shortly thereafter students and other
persons were assaulted by persons present at the
rally, and later that evening other acts of violence
occurred," has not been shown to be attributable to
Franklin's speeches.
Franklin's use of the phrase "use the methods of
People's War" has been seized on by the
administration as a kind of code phrase by which
Franklin was telling the crowd to commit acts of
violence.
"People's War" has been used extensively in
Maoist literature not only in reference to warfare,
but also in terms of building broadly based political
movements. Again, Franklin did not specifically
propagandize against violence, but seemed more
intent on urging people to go back to the dorms and
begin building a campus wide protest.
The Advisory Board should recommend that
Franklin's suspension be lifted, and that he be
allowed to remain on the faculty with no
discriminatory effect on his future possibilities for
salary increases or promotion.
The charges against Bruce Franklin should be
dropped, and he should be allowed to return to his
formal teaching activities.
After six weeks of hearings, it is clear that
Franklin did not commit the acts with which he is
charged, and that his conduct at the Lodge speech
January 1 I and at White Plaza, the Computation
Center, and the Old Union courtyard February 10
in no way "constituted a substantial and manifest
neglect of duty and substantial impairment of the
performance of his appropriate functions within the
University community,"
We feel that a careful examination of the
evidence will show that Franklin's actions on those
days do not justify punishment.
Bruce Franklin is a committed revolutionary, but
everyone involved agrees that this is not the issue.
He can only be punished if proven guilty of the
specific acts with which he is charged.
We do not believe that "substantial evidence" has
been presented on any of the charges. "Almost
guilty" is not enough. He cannot be punished for
having unpopular ideas, or expressing them in
militant ways which make the administration
uncomfortable.
Franklin has said that he deliberately chose to
tailor his conduct to fall within the limits of
university regulations. We believe that the evidence
has shown that he did do this.
The charges concerning the disruption of the
Lodge Speech January 1 1, raise grave questions of
freedom of speech. We do not believe that the
Lodge speech should have been stopped, but
heckling controversial speakers, while often rude
and unpleasant, is a necessary right when other
avenues of communication are denied.
It seems that Franklin offered two or three
comments during the speeches before Lodge's and
clearly was not a significant participant in the
disruption.
The administration has produced four major
witnesses on this charge. Two of these witnesses,
Catherine Matthews and Frances Beckwith,
misidentified Franklin, which discredits their
testimony.
The testimony of Christine Jacobs and Paul
Hanley that Franklin was a persistent disrupter is
controverted by I c > defense witnesses, seated near
Franklin and also in scattered locations throughout
Dinkelspiel. They heard Franklin shout two, or
perhaps three times, none during Lodge's speech
itself.
The testimony of Peter Geier and David Laney,
neither of whom joined in the demonstration, and
who sat directly in front of Franklin, contradicts
testimony that Franklin chanted, clapped
rhythmically, and "got the crowd going again"
during the speech.
Attorney Fisher's argument that repititious
"patterns of testimony" by Franklin's witnesses
indicated "that their testimony had been pretty
well coached or at least prepared," is a pernicious
view of the value of corroborative testimony. As
Franklin pointed out Friday, "it could very well
mean that they were telling the truth."
The three remaining charges involve alleged
incitement of illegal activity. Incitement charges
must be carefully proven, because they often
involve the borders between protected free speech
and prohibited action.
The vigorous exchange of ideas on this campus
demands that Stanford at least match the
protections afforded by outside courts. Franklin's
vague exhortations cannot be punished without
creating a tremendous chilling effect on the speech
of everyone on campus.
Franklin's speech to a noon rally at White Plaza
February 10, was not a case of such incitement to
commit specific acts. The Administration
contention, that it was Franklin's speech which
caused the crowd to move to the Computation
Center and begin an occupation there, is refuted by
much defense testimony.
First, he cannot be credited with creating the
Comp Center demonstration because the crowd had
decided what to do before he spoke. The
administration seems to ignore the context of
political literature and meetings in the days

preceeding February 10, with its claim that it was
Franklin's brief speech which convinced people of
the necessity to shut down the computer facility. It
is doubtful, in light of defense testimony and past
radical tradition, that the White Plaza rally was
meant to change anyone's mind.
If we remember that there was a four-hour
meeting at Dinkelspiel, the night before, where the
questions of war-related research at the
Computation Center, and possible means of halting
such research were discussed at length, it becomes
clear that the White Plaza rally was, as a defense
witness testified, "somewhere to go before going to
the Computation Center."

tailor his conduct to fall within the limits of
university regulations. We believe that the evidence
has shown that he did do this.
The charges concerning the disruption of the
Lodge Speech January 1 1, raise grave questions of
freedom of speech. We do not believe that the
Lodge speech should have been stopped, but
heckling controversial speakers, while often rude
and unpleasant, is a necessary right when other
avenues of communication are denied.
It seems that Franklin offered two or three
comments during the speeches before Lodge's and
clearly was not a significant participant in the
disruption.
The administration has produced four major
witnesses on this charge. Two of these witnesses,
Catherine Matthews and Frances Beckwith,
misidentified Franklin, which discredits their
testimony.
The testimony of Christine Jacobs and Paul
Hanley that Franklin was a persistent disrupter is
controverted by I c > defense witnesses, seated near
Franklin and also in scattered locations throughout
Dinkelspiel. They heard Franklin shout two, or
perhaps three times, none during Lodge's speech
itself.
The testimony of Peter Geier and David Laney,
neither of whom joined in the demonstration, and
who sat directly in front of Franklin, contradicts
testimony that Franklin chanted, clapped
rhythmically, and "got the crowd going again"
during the speech.
Attorney Fisher's argument that repititious
"patterns of testimony" by Franklin's witnesses
indicated "that their testimony had been pretty
well coached or at least prepared," is a pernicious
view of the value of corroborative testimony. As
Franklin pointed out Friday, "it could very well
mean that they were telling the truth."
The three remaining charges involve alleged
incitement of illegal activity. Incitement charges
must be carefully proven, because they often
involve the borders between protected free speech
and prohibited action.
The vigorous exchange of ideas on this campus
demands that Stanford at least match the
protections afforded by outside courts. Franklin's
vague exhortations cannot be punished without
creating a tremendous chilling effect on the speech
of everyone on campus.
Franklin's speech to a noon rally at White Plaza
February 10, was not a case of such incitement to
commit specific acts. The Administration
contention, that it was Franklin's speech which
caused the crowd to move to the Computation
Center and begin an occupation there, is refuted by
much defense testimony.
First, he cannot be credited with creating the
Comp Center demonstration because the crowd had
decided what to do before he spoke. The
administration seems to ignore the context of
political literature and meetings in the days

preceeding February 10, with its claim that it was
Franklin's brief speech which convinced people of
the necessity to shut down the computer facility. It
is doubtful, in light of defense testimony and past
radical tradition, that the White Plaza rally was
meant to change anyone's mind.
If we remember that there was a four-hour
meeting at Dinkelspiel, the night before, where the
questions of war-related research at the
Computation Center, and possible means of halting
such research were discussed at length, it becomes
clear that the White Plaza rally was, as a defense
witness testified, "somewhere to go before going to
the Computation Center."
His speech seems to be, as he claims, a theoretical
analysis presenting his perspective on the
possibilities for a strike such as that two years ago
after the Cambodian invasion.
Franklin did use the word "shutdown" in
referring to the Comp Center, but he had earlier
defined shutdown in terms of a "fake strike" or a
voluntary boycott.
The administration has implied that Franklin
neglected his professional duties by not talking the
demonstrators out of their protest. It is specious to
suggest that a professor's job requires
propagandizing against protest.
The administration has also failed to prove that
Franklin's actions on the Comp Center lawn
"significantly interferred with orderly dispersal by
intentionally urging and inciting students and other
persons present at the Computation Center to
disregard or disobey such orders to disperse," as
alleged.
Franklin appears to have attempted
unsuccessfully to incite several faculty members,
including Lincoln Moses and Charles Stein, to stay
in the area as faculty observers. He also argued with
Sargeant Don Tamm as to the legality of the
dispersal order.
The administration contention that Franklin was
urging a dispersing crowd to return and confront the
police seems unsupported. Moses and Stein now
think that they should have stayed, and Stein has
gone as far as to say that he now feels that the
arguments Franklin directed to him were correct,
and that Franklin meant to protect students from a
possible police charge.
It appears that both of Franklin's discussions at
the Comp Center were aimed at lessening the
possibility of a police charge. It also appears that
Franklin's right to question Tamm about the
legality of the dispersal order is protected by the
First Amendment to the Constitution.
We also feel that the administration has failed to
show that Franklin's two speeches during the Old
Union courtyard rally the evening of February 10
"urged and incited students and other persons
present to engage in conduct calculated to disrupt
university functions and business and which
threatened injury to individuals and property," as
charged.
Again, Franklin spoke in general theoretical
terms, without advocating specific illegal acts. The
fact that "shortly thereafter students and other
persons were assaulted by persons present at the
rally, and later that evening other acts of violence
occurred," has not been shown to be attributable to
Franklin's speeches.
Franklin's use of the phrase "use the methods of
People's War" has been seized on by the
administration as a kind of code phrase by which
Franklin was telling the crowd to commit acts of
violence.
"People's War" has been used extensively in
Maoist literature not only in reference to warfare,
but also in terms of building broadly based political
movements. Again, Franklin did not specifically
propagandize against violence, but seemed more
intent on urging people to go back to the dorms and
begin building a campus wide protest.
The Advisory Board should recommend that
Franklin's suspension be lifted, and that he be
allowed to remain on the faculty with no
discriminatory effect on his future possibilities for
salary increases or promotion.
The charges against Bruce Franklin should be
dropped, and he should be allowed to return to his
formal teaching activities.
After six weeks of hearings, it is clear that
Franklin did not commit the acts with which he is
charged, and that his conduct at the Lodge speech
January 1 I and at White Plaza, the Computation
Center, and the Old Union courtyard February 10
in no way "constituted a substantial and manifest
neglect of duty and substantial impairment of the
performance of his appropriate functions within the
University community,"
We feel that a careful examination of the
evidence will show that Franklin's actions on those
days do not justify punishment.
Bruce Franklin is a committed revolutionary, but
everyone involved agrees that this is not the issue.
He can only be punished if proven guilty of the
specific acts with which he is charged.
We do not believe that "substantial evidence" has
been presented on any of the charges. "Almost
guilty" is not enough. He cannot be punished for
having unpopular ideas, or expressing them in
militant ways which make the administration
uncomfortable.

dispersal order.
The administration contention that Franklin was
urging a dispersing crowd to return and confront the
police seems unsupported. Moses and Stein now
think that they should have stayed, and Stein has
gone as far as to say that he now feels that the
arguments Franklin directed to him were correct,
and that Franklin meant to protect students from a
possible police charge.
It appears that both of Franklin's discussions at
the Comp Center were aimed at lessening the
possibility of a police charge. It also appears that
Franklin's right to question Tamm about the
legality of the dispersal order is protected by the
First Amendment to the Constitution.
We also feel that the administration has failed to
show that Franklin's two speeches during the Old
Union courtyard rally the evening of February 10
"urged and incited students and other persons
present to engage in conduct calculated to disrupt
university functions and business and which
threatened injury to individuals and property," as
charged.
Again, Franklin spoke in general theoretical
terms, without advocating specific illegal acts. The
fact that "shortly thereafter students and other
persons were assaulted by persons present at the
rally, and later that evening other acts of violence
occurred," has not been shown to be attributable to
Franklin's speeches.
Franklin's use of the phrase "use the methods of
People's War" has been seized on by the
administration as a kind of code phrase by which
Franklin was telling the crowd to commit acts of
violence.
"People's War" has been used extensively in
Maoist literature not only in reference to warfare,
but also in terms of building broadly based political
movements. Again, Franklin did not specifically
propagandize against violence, but seemed more
intent on urging people to go back to the dorms and
begin building a campus wide protest.
The Advisory Board should recommend that
Franklin's suspension be lifted, and that he be
allowed to remain on the faculty with no
discriminatory effect on his future possibilities for
salary increases or promotion.
