False Accusations
Editor, The Daily:
The Young Crows, in their cruelly ironical
"Red's Hot Ptofessor Contest," have seriously
misrepresented my work and the work of
members of my department. Their theatrical
effort is very insensitive to the feelings of the
many professors, students, and staff members
involved.
We have been, and still are, willing to
discuss our views and our work with any
members of this community under conditions
where respect for us as honest persons is
evidenced. To my knowledge, the Young
Crows have never approached any of us.
Instead, they seek by distortions, half-truths,
innuendo, and their own false conceptions of
our motives, to divide us from the rest of the
Stanford community. They have implied faults
in our character and arbitrarily included us in a
farce. Such tactics belie their own supposedly
humane motives.
In the case of Prof. Karamcheti and myself,
they have seized on small portions of each of
our research programs thai deal with future
rotary-wing VTOL vehicles. Neither the
contracts nor the Defense Documentation
Center provide a single word about military
uses. The allusions to "quiet, stable gun
platforms" were provided by tha supposedly
objective SWOPSI report and the Young
Crows. If anyone had asked us our motives, we
would gladly have told them that we hoped to
contribute to safer, quieter, more economical
civilian short-haul transportation.

The Young Crows seem simply to lack
judgment. Nonetheless, tactics such as theirs
hurt many people, and are capable of causing
great damage to our already dwindling sense of
community at Stanford.
The research that we do in the Aero/Astro
Department is directed at discovering (a) new
phenomena in fluid and solid mechanics, and
(b) improved techniques of analysis and
synthesis of aeronautical and space systems.
All of us hope that the results of our research
may some day be useful to society. By its
nature, much of our research has potential
application to both civilian and military
purposes. All of us would obviously prefer to
have it used for peaceful purposes.
1 urge the members of the Stanford
community, and particularly the editors of the
Daily and the Chapparal, to seek wiser and
more productive resolutions of the
complicated issues that face us. Uninformed
and false accusations are divisive and
de-humanizing.

Love And Values
Editor, The Daily:
Although I ordinarily try not to get into
arguments with men who seem to be
threatened by a measure of independence and
intelligence on the part of women, I have to
respond to E. Gordon Dalbey, Jr.'s letter in
this morning's Daily criticizing Joan Baez for
her "unfeeling arrogance". I wish Mr. Dalbey
would rethink his reasoning; he seems to be

reacting more from hurt male ego than from
any firm basis in reality.
To respond to a man because you value
what he values (or "makes political sense") is
indeed "making love"—in the highest sense of
the word. Why else should one love? Love is a
response to values, and any attempt to pretend
otherwise is to engage in a line of reasoning
that, contrary to what Mr. Dalbey seems to
think, can lead to war faster than almost
anything else. To love a man "because" (no
value-strings attached) is the same thing as
loving one's country no matter what it
does—or loving a man because he's tall and
good-looking (or wears medals or beads or
whatever) without consideration for the kind
of person he is. It is not "unfeeling arrogance"
that swoons over chest medals, but undirected
emotion, spur-of-the-moment feelings that
have never been thought through.
The sarcasm in Mr. Dalbey's criticism that
"to caress Joan's slender, tawny legs a man
must measure up politically" indicates his
insecurity in the presence of a woman who
makes the attempt to give her body selectively,
i.e., with her mind involved as well. I see in his
letter the perhaps unconscious protest against
a woman who thinks, who uses her mind to
gain a measure of moral integrity. Though I
don't share the political ideals of Joan Baez, I
can admire her attempt to love in the flesh the
values she holds in her mind.
