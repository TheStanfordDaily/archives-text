# Liberals Like Foreign Aid
## News in Review 
### Bill Evers 
Second Of Two Parts
Let us go back to the original
question of why liberals such as
Fulbright have gone along with
the foreign aid program in the
past and why they want it
reformed now.
In general, liberals who like
foreign aid (including both those
who voted for and against the
Nixon Administration foreign aid
bill on October 29) hold a
position which stems ideologically
from Henry Wallace's theories on
foreign aid.
Wallace was a corn-pone
crackpot who was Secretary of
Agriculture and Vice-President
under Franklin Roosevelt, and
Secretary of Commerce under
Harry Truman. He was an
adherent of the expansionist
ideology of the frontier
(ennunciated by Frederick
Jackson Turner) applied to
foreign markets. Wallace also
wanted to have New Deals and
build TV A projects all over the
world.
It should not be thought that
Wallace was the only foreign aid
advocate of his day. Indeed, he
was only one among many, but
his speeches provided many of the
slogans and formulas that others
used and took up.
According to historian J. Fred
Rippy, who bases his account of
the 1 9 32 election on Raymond
Moley's, "The Republicans had
assumed that the depression in the
United States had been caused
largely by the loss of export
markets occasioned by a sharp
decline in foreign purchasing
power, thus accepting the view of
the international bankers,
shipping companies, and
exporters."
Though the New Dealers
disagreed with this view at first,
Henry Wallace was saying by
1942, and FDR was agreeing with
him, that "there must be an
international bank and an
international TVA."
In December 1942, Wallace
said, "Our surplus will be far
greater than ever a few years after
this war comes to an end. We can
be decently human and really
hardheaded if we exchange our
postwar surplus of goods for
peace, and for improving the
standard of living of so-called
backward peoples." This would
mean, Wallace believed, prosperity
without depression for the U.S.
economy.
In pushing fot polcies which
were in line with his "frontier
thesis" mentality, Wallace saw
himself consciously as being in the
tradition of an earlier Secretary of
Commerce, Herbert Hoover (who
is sometimes erroneously thought
to have been an advocate of
laissez faire). Wallace said, "I have
considerable sympathy with
Herbert Hoover's problem as
Secretary of Commerce right now
because I can say that I am going
to go all out to get the maximum
use of whatever powers may
reside in the bureau of Foreign
and Domestic Commerce to foster
and develop trade here and
abroad."
In their essay, "Henry Wallace
and the Open Door," Ronald
Radosh and Leonard Liggio point
out: "America's traditional
program of foreign expansion had
seldom been questioned by
liberals, who hoped that American
influence abroad would create a
liberal international structure as
well as world peace. It was left to
a conservative critic, Senator
Robert A. Taft, to explain that
while 'dollar diplomacy is

derided... it is exactly the policy
of Government aid to our
exporters which Mr. Wallace
himself advocates to develop
foreign trade, except that
(previously) it did not involve our
lending abroad the money to pay
for all our exports'."
Foreign aid is best understood,
as Taft recognized in his criticism
of Wallace, as a form of the
traditional U.S. government
policy of dollar diplomacy.
To get back to the
international bank that Wallace

was (and Fulbright and Nixon are)
so enthusiastic about, we must
remember that the World Bank is
based on an American design
drawn up by U.S. Treasury
assistant Harry Dexter White.
The Bank is headquartered in
Washington, D.C. All its
presidents have been Americans.
Since 194 7 and until McNamara
took over in 1968, all presidents
have been men close to the Wall
Street banking houses.
According to a thesis advanced
by Steve Weissman and found in
Bruce Nissen's article in the PSC
Telegram, the ascension of John J.
McCloy to the presidency of the
World Bank in 194 7 "put control
of (the Bank) into the hands of
the financial community and out
of the hands of the (U.S.)
government."
Nissen also points out: "The
U.S. government originally
subscribed close to 40% of the
capital to the Bank, and
accordingly had almost a 40%
vote in all decisions amde. (The
present-day percentage is
approximately 25%.)" The U.S.
capital referred to is taxpayers'
money.
Furthermore, as Jacob Kaplan,
formerly Assistant Coordinator
for Foreign Assistance in the
Department of State, writes in
The Challenge of Foreign Aid:
"The Bank is not the apolitical
institution that some admirers
believe it to be. It must bear
political considerations in mind in
deciding on a loan request. Its
decisions on a large loan do affect
the distribution of power among
and within nations, and it has
always and inevitably been quite
conscious of the political impact
of its determinations ... . "
"The stuff of international
politics can be observed in many
of its loan applications. The
Bank's reluctance to finance the

Aswan Dam comes to mind, as
does its subsequent affirmative
decision to finance the
nationalized U.A.R. Suez Canal
Authority. Loans to the Indus
project and to Ghana's Volta
River project were replete with
political considerations.
"In 1965, the Malaysian
Finance Minister publicly thanked
the bank management for a large
loan that permitted his country to
continue with a development
program that should and would
have been financed out of its own

resources had it not been for the
confrontation with Indonesia.
Under the circumstances, the
defense budget had to be
increased. Financing was found by
diverting funds previously
programmed for development
projects; the resulting shortage of
development funds was to be met
in part out of the Bank's loan."
In summary, we can say that
foreign aid has been a form of
subsidy to American exporters. In
a detailed story in the November
3 Wall Street Journal, headlined
"U.S. Firms Push to Get Aid Bill
Resurrected; The Stakes: About
$1 Billion in Annual Sales,"
Robert Keatley writes: "The aid
program provides about $1 billion
of sales annually for American
manufacturers, gives U.S. shipping
companies about one-fourth of
their total revenue from outbound
cargo, and supplies assorted

research and technical
private and
non-profitâ€”with about $600
million of contracts overseas."
Foreign aid will continue to be
a subsidy to the world's largest
corporations even if economic aid
funds go to the UN, the World
Bank, and other international
agencies, because artificial foreign
purchasing power and commercial
conditions will be created.
Foreign aid is intimately related
to the theory and practice of
foreign expansionism.
If aid funds go to the
international agencies as Nixon
and the liberals (in the Henry
Wallace tradition) propose, it will
still be a case of money taken
from the pockets of the American
citizenry and put into the pockets
of an international ruling elite
both in American and in recipient
foreign countries. Foreign aid will
still be an instance of the class
struggle that Populist leader
Sockless Jerry Simpson described
as the struggle between the
"robbers" and the "robbed." The
only way to right the wrong done
to the government-exploited class
by the government-privileged class
through the foreign aid program is
to abolish foreign aid entirely.
