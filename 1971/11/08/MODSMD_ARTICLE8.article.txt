# Aretha Disappoints In Maples Concert
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Aretha Franklin has been
generally accepted as one of
music's present superstars. She has
become known to almost
everyone knowledgeable in
popular music as the "First Lady
of Soul." She has had a large
number of gold albums and hit
singles over the last few years.
Aretha has made it big.
The first time I saw her in
person, it was easy to see why she
has achieved all this success. Eight
months ago, I cut short a trip to
Los Angeles so I could make it up
to San Francisco on a Sunday
night to see Franklin's show.
I had seen many Fillmore
shows before. I'd heard many of
the so-called "heavies" and had
spent more than a few memorable
nights at Bill Graham's rock
palace before. But this night had
to be one of the most remarkable
ones ever.
The show began with strong
sets by Tower of Power and King
Curtis and the Kingpins. The
music was good and the crowd
was enjoying the show, but
everyone was waiting for "Lady
Soul" to come on. Finally with
the Kingpins playing behind them,
Aretha and the Sweethearts of
Soul came on stage. A neon
"ARETHA" sign began flashing
over the center of the stage and
the crowd exploded.
Full Speed
Aretha didn't waste any time
in going to work. She went full
speed for a long time mixing
incredible versions of rockers like
"Respect," "Don't Play That
Song" and "Dr. Feelgood," with
mellower numbers like "Bridge
Over Troubled Water" and "Make
It With You."
And in one of the most
amazing climaxes to a show ever,
Aretha left the stage momentarily
and returned with her parallel in
the male soul world, Ray Charles.
Their version of "Spirit In The
Dark" was a classic and
fortunately the whole show was
recorded on a "Live At Fillmore"
album.
This may seem like an
unnecessary and irrelevant
introduction for a review of
Aretha's concert on Friday night
in Maples Pavilion, but I think
you'd have to have seen Aretha at

her best to understand my
disappointment over Friday's
show.
Once again, the Kingpins
provided part of the preliminary
entertainment on Friday night.
Only this time they were without
King Curtis who tragically died a
few months ago. They still had
the same tight horns and the good
arrangements, but it just wasn't
the same without the King.
After a few songs, the
Sweethearts of Soul came out and
joined the Kingpins. They did one
song in a sound very reminiscent
of the old Supremes sound and
then they did "You've Got A
Friend." It was a nice-sounding
rendition of Carole King's song,
but I can't see how such a
personal, intimate song can be as
moving when sung by more than
one vocalist.
Didn't Fit In
Comedian Stu Gilliam was up
next and he had some good lines,
but I wasn't in any danger of
falling out of my seat. Gilliam did
a pretty funny piece on the
problems of bacherlorhood and he
had some good material on why
people shouldn't worry so much,
but somehow he didn't seem to
me to completely fit in.
P>anklin's management makes
their own decisions about
supporting acts and last
Wednesday night the ASSU
Special Events people who
promoted the show were notified
that they had decided on Gilliam.
He was fairly funny, but he
seemed more suited for a supper
club atmosphere and his wasn't
the kind of act which really builds
a crowd up for Franklin.
After intermission, Aretha
came out rocking to the sounds of
"Respect" and the crowd went
wild. She sang a few bars of the
song and then stopped. This was a
good indicator of what she
intended to do for most of the
night. She'd begin familiar songs,
the crowd would explode in a
type of AM-radio recognition
reaction and then she would end
the song after only a minute or so.
'Quickie' Versions
Little tastes of "Baby I Love
You" and "Say A Little Prayer,"
may have pleased some people,
but I felt terribly cheated. Some
shades of the real Aretha finally

came through on "Spanish
Harlem," but then she slipped
back into some more "quickie"
versions.
She finally sat down at the
piano and performed a fairly good
"Just Because Of You." But her
"Bridge Over Troubled Water" fell
far short of a remarkable version
she played at Fillmore. The
saxophones were drowning her
out a bit, but mostly she just
didn't seem into what she was
doing. The sound system in
Maples isn't the world's best, but
the main problem was Franklin
herself.
Finally on an encore after her
30 minute set, she got into "Spirit
In The Dark" and for the first
time all night, this was Aretha.
The incredible soulful spirit was
really cooking and all I could
think was "Why hadn't she sung
like this all night." It was a very
good rendition of the song, but to
steal a sports cliche, "It was too
little, too late."

She finished up with her
traditional "Reach Out And
Touch," and that was fairly strong
also. But a strong finish couldn't
save a weak performance. It was a
real letdown to see such a truly
remarkable artist not really
perform to her fullest. But she has
too much talent to stay in a rut
for long. Too bad that rut
occurred here.
