# Great Innovative Guitarist Sounds Good At In Your Ear
## 
### MARC BARMAN 
The fact is that Larry Coryell is
doing things to, with, and on
guitar that other guitarists haven't
even thought of yet, let alone
tried.
"Larry Coryell will appear one
night only Wednesday, Nov. 3 at
In Your Ear in Palo Alto" the ad
tells you. Man, what the ad
doesn't tell you is enough to start
a new religion. Like the band, the
sound, the music with roots
everywhere, the energy and
intensity, and the spirituality of
the whole thing.
In Your Ear was full. People
were keyed. (Just the sight of
Steve Markus standing there with
his soprano sax did it for me.)
They launched into a blues riff.
Not just any old blues riff, but
Coryell styleâ€”with an Arabian
accent in a minor mode. Going up
a half-step at the bridge, but
somehow ending on the tonic at
the bridge's end. Carried by the
bells and cymbals of Harry
Wilkinson's drums and the mellow
wooden electric bass of Mervin
Bronson, up it flew. Markus plays
like he has twenty fingers, all over
the horn from every direction.
Coryell started slowly and
pensively. The first song of the
night in a new place. What's it feel
like? Feels loose, easy. Feels like
some mean flatted fifths and
ninths. Yeah. Then cut it all loose.
Fly, soar, twist, writhe, burn.
Kick and dance. Everybody in In
Your Ear is at the edge of their
seats. These cats are going to
PLAY tonight! One hundred fifty
people share the same heartbeat,
Mervin Bronson's sinewy ostinato
bass. BAM! A rimshot from

Wilkinson and the instruments go
silent while the sound goes on for
a long, long time.
A sip of some of that In Your
Ear beer, and they're off again,
doing more impossible things.
Indian overtones. Group
improvisation, with melody and
rhythm free. Unison downward,
glissandoes scream at your
neurons.
After Afro-rhythmic
"Ruminations" Larry looks up,
smiles, and walks over to the
mike. "We sure enjoy playing for
you people. It really feels great in
here . . . . "
Coryell and Markus I think are
two projections of the same being;
alter egos. Markus doing things on
sax you can only do on a guitar.
Coryell doing things on guitar you
can only do on sax, or that just
can't be done.
The best chance to get into
Larry was during "A Guitar
Solo." Lyrical, with an intuitive
feel for chords and structure.
Harmonics on the guitar strings,
double and triple stops. On the
up-tempo things, running musical
motifs up and down the entire
range of the guitar at lightning
speed. And he exhibits beautiful
control of the electronic things,
making musical use of distortion,
feedback, etc.
But the group transcends the
individual personalities, heavy as
they are. They have an intuitive
sense of what each other will play
next, especially Wilkinson, who is
on top of every rhythmic nuance.
They have an album out as a
group: Barefoot Boy on the
Flying Dutchman label. Check it
out. Larry and Steve each have

several albums of their own, some
jointly. They will be back at In
Your Ear on Nov. 24 th, after
doing San Diego State, Los
Angeles and the New Monk in San
Francisco. Don't, don't, don't
miss them.

Good things are coming up at
In Your Ear. Don Ellis is coming,
first with a quartet including
Vince Denim, and then possibly
with his whole orchestra. Also,
look for Vince Guaraldi's Quartet
as a regular Tuesday night gig.
University Ave. never sounded
better.
