# Veterans Face Numerous Readjustment Problems
## 
### MARK WEAVER 
Over one million veterans will return from Southeast Asia
during 1971. Many will find jobs, although the hunting will be
more difficult for them than for any American veterans before
them.
Thousands of men, either unwilling or unable to gain
employment will go to school with the aid of federal funds.
565 of them are at Stanford this year.
The adjustment from a war to a peace environment is not
easy. "It takes a while to forget the way you lived," says
thrice wounded veteran, Dan Higgins, a junior here. Whenever
a car backfires, "you get that deep gut fear. It yanks you out
of the present and reminds you of the past." People develop a
very different outlook on life when they are not sure if they'll
be alive in 10 minutes.
Jerry Arnold, an organizing chairman of Veterans For
Peace here, says, "you look around bushes and listen carefully,
you're still kind of nervous."
Dennis Whitaker, a member of Veterans For Peace, finds it
hard to voice opinions. "You've been out of it so long it is
hard to know what is going on."
Not Like World War II
Guy Browning, Director of Counseling and Testing was a

counselor with the Veteran's Administration after World War
II and has frequent contact with veterans. He says many
"veterans returning now are much less certain" that they've
been doing the correct thing, than were their World War II
counterparts. It reflects on their confidence and self-worth.
"So many World War II veterans came back with a feeling
of pride and accomplishment which is not shared today.
Identification of oneself as a veteran is not as nearly as
common now as it was a generation ago."
"Many of us just don't want to remember we are veterans,"
says Arnold.
The Veterans For Peace are using their identity to oppose
the War. Higgins wants "to change the order of the society
that put me in a position where 1 had to kill or be killed."
Whitaker estimates 50 to 60 percent of Vietnam veterans
are politically opposed to the war. According to Higgins,
veterans oppose the war with more vehemence than any other
group by virtue of their experience. Sometimes Higgins gets so
frustrated "I throw things at the wall."
Veterans For Peace is a political and moral alliance, as
opposed to the social orientation of Veterans of Foreign Wars
(VFW), says Higgins. "We're not establishment veterans. The
VFW does not want anti-war vets and we don't want to join
them. The VFW didn't want us to march in the Veterans Day

parade—that is one of our biggest complaints."
No Black Members
There are no black members of the Stanford Veterans For
Peace. Whitaker thinks it is a carry-over of racial animosities in
Vietnam. Besides, he said, "blacks don't think it's their war."
Financial problems beset many veterans seeking a college
education.
Most of the 565 men receiving some sort of financial aid
here obtain federal grants of $17 5 a month for up to 4 8
months. A married veteran will get $205, and $230 a month
with a child. That does not come close to paying tuition,
though there are a wide variety of grants and loans available
from the Veteran's Administration.
Ten disabled veterans are in the rehabilitation program here
which is designed to return the vet to normal life. The
program pays tuition, books, and supplies.
However, many veterans complain checks are slow to arrive
after aid is applied for. Often a man will have no money until
months after school starts. It is up to him to make do in the
interim.
All too often the aid is not enough. A man who gets 25
percent disability after he loses a leg cannot live on that, and
finds it hard to get a job.

Higgins says the veteran is very low on the hiring list
because he has too many bitter memories which disturb him.
Counseling Director Browning agrees, but believes many
employers like veterans because they are more mature and
more confident in handling people than the younger
non-veterans.
After the Second World War, the problems were different.
The bureaucracy was overwhelmed and its functioning
impaired by the huge parade of victims claiming veterans'
benefits. After the war, demand for scarce consumer goods
fueled a boom. Today the veteran returns to a recession.
Despite his financial troubles, the veteran has an academic
advantage when he returns to school.
Studies made after World War II showed that "vets were
better students than they had been before and were better as a
group than their counter-parts," says Browning. He thinks the
same is true today.
One reason for this is that veterans, being older, are often
more mature than their fellow students. They seem to possess
a„ higher degree of motivation, perhaps due to a "sense of lost
time," says Browning. "He is not as far along in life as he
thought he'd be at that time. Veterans come to college with a
purpose, their colleagues are l» 4 ss sure of what they want."
