# Residence Staff Problem Still Lingers
## 
### BOB MICHELET Commentary 
Though months have passed
since initial criticism of new
selection procedures for residence
staff, complaints still exist over
alleged faults in the system.
At the time of their
inauguration last spring, the new
methods were criticized as
discriminatory against students,
and some charges are still being
echoed.
Notable among critics is Don
Lee, an active campus radical
whose selection as a residence
staff member last spring was
overruled by the Dean of Students
office.
Lee was chosen by Physical
Education Prof, and Mrs. Daniel
Millman to join them on the staff
of Soto House in Wilbur for this
year. His selection, however, was
nullified by acting Dean of
Students, Robert Freelen.
In a letter to Lee explaining
the action, Freelen claimed Lee
showed "an irresponsible attitude
toward university property and
officials."
Lee, a member of Venceremos
and present at the Computation
Center disruption, was named in
last year's injunction against
campus disorders. He was never
served with the injunction,
however, and was acquitted by
the Stanford Judicial Council of a
charge of assaulting a
photographer at the Comp Center.
Lee said he was "outraged"
when notified his selection as a
"House Associate" had been
vetoed. He appealed several times,
but the decision was never
reversed.
Freelen made the decision
along with Dean of Undergraduate
Studies James Biggs and Dwight
Adams, then University Business
Manager. Freelen said because he
was only an acting Dean and the
selection system was new, he
wanted additional advice in
deciding the matter.
Administrators Respond
Administrators said Lee was
rejected not simply because his

name was on the injunction, but
rather because of what that
indicated (i.e., "an irresponsible
attitude toward university
property and officials"). Freelen
explained that the three-man
board "felt doubts about (Lee's)
ability."
Lee, however, claims the
decision "shows a growing
tendency to get rid of anybody
who is effective with left-of-center
ideas, though I was told that being
a revolutionary didn't matter."
The political argument is
blunted, though, by the fact that
noted radicals John Shoch and
Sharon Winslow were allowed to
serve as residence staff members
(though Winslow had to appeal an
original rejection).
Millman said that after a
"rigorous elimination process," he
and his wife were "very
impressed" with Lee and felt
"Don would have been an
effective staff member."
The Soto faculty residents,
responding to Freelen's charge,
said "we thought he (Lee) was
responsible," and noted that Lee
was chosen "irrelevant of his
political leanings."
Further Criticism
More general criticisms of the
system had surfaced before the
actual selections late last spring.
After the new procedures were
announced in March, a group of
sponsors criticized the new plan
on several grounds.
In previous years, head
sponsors assigned to dorms those
applicants judged qualified by
preliminary screening committees.
Under the new system, faculty
residents make the final selection
of House Associates (as sponsors
and R.A.'s are now called) from a
pool of the qualified.
Old sponsors criticized the
decreased role of students in the
selection process, claiming that
tight administrative control would

limit "the individuality with
which (sponsors) have operated"
in the past.
University officials claimed the
new methods would help form
united residential staffs and
eliminate dangers of "clubbish
ness in "self-perpetuating groups."
This new "team system" was
designed, housing administrators
said, to make sponsors more
"accountable" to their superiors
and to better coordinate a house
staff.
Sponsors complained that
students were given lesser roles in
screening and selection
procedures, and also objected to
the new titles of House Associate,
Senior House Associate, etc. as
"bureaucratic and hierarchical."
At the time, many also felt the
new system was designed to
reduce the large number of radical
students who had been sponsors
in the past.
Two years ago some
complaints arose over the
configuration of committees to
interview applicants. At that time,
some students charged that
persons outside the sponsor
program were not included on all
selection committees.
Politics Discussed
Concern was also expressed
about the political nature of some
questions being asked candidates.
A meeting was held between
students and program
administrators after which one
participant said the questions
raised were "proceduralâ€”not
political."
Some of the arguments offered
in last spring's debate over the
new selection procedures are
present in Lee's case. He claims
the action "shows the
arbitrariness of power in this
university," and demonstrates an
"absolute lack of faith and lack of
trust of the people involved in the
residence system."
Millman also said it "showed a
lack of trust in our judgment... a
lack of trust in this system."
Freelen, however, cites the fact
that only one of the 15 0
appointments made was overruled
and claims "that shows a great
deal of faith in the system."
The Miilmans, who said they
were "extremely incensed" at the
decision, feel the administration
should have notified Lee earlier in
the process of selection that they

considered him an unsuitable
applicant.
Appeals Made
They backed Lee during his
several appeals, and were aided by
Mr. and Mrs. John Palmer, faculty
residents last year in Junipero. Mr.
Palmer was then an acting
economics professor. The Palmers
gave Lee "an extremely warm
recommendation," Millman said.
Millman noted that during the
appeals he "got the impression
that their minds were made up
beforehand." He added, though,
that Freelen "was sincere" and
"felt he was doing the best thing."
After Freelen refused to
change the decision, the Miilmans
consulted the University
Ombudsman (then Dr. Herant
Katchadourian) who said the
university had the legal right to
make such a decision.
At that point, the Miilmans
"figured it was a hopless cause,"
noting "we had slim hopes going
in and no hopes going out."
