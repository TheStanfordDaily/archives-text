Peking Party Arrives
NEW YORK — A six-man advance party from Peking
flew into New York yesterday to set up a base for the
Chinese Communist delegation to the United Nations.
They traveled light, with only half a dozen suitcases
among them.
After a flight via Karachi, Pakistan, the six spent
the night in Paris. Then they jetted across the
Atlantic via Air France and arrived at Kennedy
Airport without fanfare.
Leader of the group was Kao Liang, a former
member of the Hsinhua news agency. In Karachi, he
told newsmen his advance party would "provide
necessary arrangements and administrative work" for
the 10-member U.N. delegation, expected to arrive
Wednesday.
The first order of business was obtaining lodgings

and offices for the Communist Chinese, who on Oct.
25 were voted into the U.N. seat formerly held by
Nationalist China.
Since the vote, the U.N. General Assembly has
been marking time, awaiting the Peking delegation,
which will consist of five representatives and five
alternates.
Amendment Defeated
WASHINGTON — A proposed constitutional
amendment to permit official praying in public
schools died in the House yesterday when backers fell
28 votes short of the two-thirds majority needed for
approval.
The intense and often emotional debate ended
with 240 congressmen favoring and 162 opposing a
resolution which would have been the first step

toward inserting ' 1 the Constitution a clause
guaranteeing the ri 0 " t of voluntary prayer or
meditation in public buildings.
Recommending rejection of the resolution, House
Speaker, Carl Albert, D-Okla., shouted to his
colleagues that he is "not prepared to let the
meddling hand of government, at any level, to any
degree, be placed on any man's altar."
Capital 9 8 Crime Declines
WASHINGTON — Police say crime is declining in the
nation's capital, which President Nixon has helped
make the most heavily policed, and heavily
methadone-treated city in America.
Police figures show total crime has dropped 17 .9
percent in a year. Burglaries and thefts are down
dramatically but the more serious crimes of murder,
assault and rape are little changed.
