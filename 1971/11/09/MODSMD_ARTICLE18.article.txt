# Band's Show Criticized
## 
### 
Last Saturday's pre-game Stanford
Band show has come under attack this
week for its dig at UCLA's ineligible
"super soph" running back James
McAlister.
L.A. Times columnist John Hall, a
Stanford alumnus, labeled the Stanford
Band's spellout of "Jim" and "1 .6" as
"one of Stanford's distasteful
trademarks through the
yearsâ€”academic snobbery."
McAlister missed an entrance exam
and consequently did not have a
projected 1.6 CPA which he needed for
eligibility in NCAA football
The San Jose Mercury quoted Bruin
football coach Pepper Rodgers as
saying "the Stanford Band surprised us
with its pre-game cheer. It was in real
bad taste. They'll hear from him
(McAlister) in the future."

Rodgers was also unhappy with the
band's musical comment that McAlister
was "one tokc under the line," made in
conjunction with the playing of a song
of similar name.
Drum Major Bob Kurland had "no
comment" when askt'd for an opinion
on Hall's accusation that the jab at
McAlister was "particularly offensive
and misplaced display of egomania."
Explaining that the band as a whole
was responsible for the show, Kurland
said he had had little to do with the
choice.
According to Kurland, Band
Director Dr. Arthur Barnes censors
anything "too outlandishly gross,"
although for last week's show he
"probably didn't realize what we were
doing. He's not much of a football
fiend."
