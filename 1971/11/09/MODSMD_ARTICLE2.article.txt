# ACLU, Faculty File Franklin Briefs
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
Forty faculty members yesterday
asked that charges be dropped against
Professor H. Bruce Franklin. The
recommendation was part of a 22-page
written brief filed with the faculty
Advisory Board as the Board began
deliberating the charges against the
teacher-revolutionary.
A second brief, from the American
Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), has been
delayed by the ACLU's rejection of a
Board request. The Board asked the
ACLU to describe any contacts it had
with either Franklin or the
administration, the parties in the case.
Harvard Law School Professor Alan
Dershowitz, who is representing the
ACLU, called the request
"unprecedented and unreasonable" and
a "violation of confidentiality."
The request for contacts reportedly
followed questions within the Board
concerning Dershowitz's relations to
Franklin's defense team.
Board Chairman Donald Kennedy
said the Board is "seeking some kind of
accommodation" that will satisfy both
the Board and the ACLU.
Apparently, Stanford Law School
Professors Paul Brest and John Kaplan
will join Dershowitz in preparing the
ACLU brief in return for cancellation
of the Board's request for "contacts."
Faculty Brief
The faculty's brief was signed by 4 0
professors in four hours, according to
Political Science Professor Charles
Drekmeier. He said additional
signatures will be sought.
The brief closed "by demanding that
the Advisory Board refuse to make
political conformity a condition of
employment at the university."
The faculty members asked the
Advisory Board to recommend that
President Richard Lyman "drop all
charges against Professor Franklin and
reinstate him at once." The faculty also
asked that the administration pay
Franklin's expenses in the case.
Professor Raymond Giraud,
Chairman of the Department of French
and Italian, said the brief was initiated
by a "group of faculty members who
felt their interests threatened in this
case."
The faculty group was allowed to
submit a written brief after the Board
rejected its original request in
September to participate as a party
throughout the hearing.
ACLU Request
The ACLU was also invited to
submit written arguments after the
Board turned down its request
Thursday for thirty minutes of oral
arguments to state ACLU positions on
civil liberties involved in the case.
Dershowitz said he had been
authorized to prepare arguments by
both the national and regional boards
of the ACLU.

Dershowitz is visiting this year at
Stanford's Center for Advanced Study
in the Behavioral Sciences. One
"contact" which apparently concerned
the Board is Franklin co-counsel Joel
Klein, who is also Dershowitz's
assistant at the Behavioral Sciences
"think tank."
Kennedy denied that relationship
was the "exclusive trigger" of the
Board's request. But he said, "There
might obviously be some perception on
the part of people that his relationship
with Joel raised questions."
Dershowitz said, "Joel and I are
working together on other matters, but
we're not working together on this
matter."
He said the national ACLU board
was "adamant" in rejecting the request
for contacts. But the
"accommodation," involving Kaplan
and Brest in preparation of the brief,
will apparently satisfy the Board and
eliminate the request for "contacts."
Dershowitz insisted the ACLU was
"not coming in on anybody's side." He
said the ACLU wanted to suggest "rules
to the Board that would maximally
protect" the civil liberties involved.
Calling the Franklin case nationally
important, Dershowitz said, "The eyes
of many universities will focus on the
result reached in this case and the rules
laid down."

The daily public hearings are over in
the six-week-long dismissal hearing of
Professor H. Bruce Franklin. But the
seven professors on the Advisory Board
judging the case have just begun a
month or more of deliberations.
According to Biology Professor
Donald Kennedy, the Board's
Chairman, the Board will meet
Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays
from 1 to 5 p.m. for "general
discussions of issues" in the case.
But between the group meetings,
"subcommittees" assigned to particular
questions in the case will read through
several thousands of pages of
transcripts.
The Board members expect to spend
as much time in deliberations as they
did sitting through the daily afternoon
sessions. The deliberation schedule will
involve night and morning work, for
"increased flexibility," according to
Sociology Professor Sanford
Dornbusch.
After a two-hour meeting yesterday
morning, two Board members finally
found time to leave town for special
projects.
Wolfgang Panofsky, Director of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center,
went to Washington, D.C., for two days
to attend a panel meeting which had
been delayed until the Franklin
hearings were completed.
Religion Professor Robert McAfee
Brown left for a speaking engagement
on the East coast. The Board's next full

meeting is scheduled for Friday, when
he returns.
Other members of the Board are
catching up with long-delayed work on
campus. Dornbusch said, "I'm going to
have six hours of office hours on
Wednesday for my Soc. 1 students.
That's to make up for the office hours I
haven't been having."
He said his afternoons on the Board
"hurt my teaching a lot" because he
had no time to offer research seminars
for his beginning sociology class.
Panofsky's secretary, Mary Beth
Jensen, said the SLAC administrator
has "managed to keep up with his work
pretty well" during the hearings by

"sandwiching in an amazing amount"
of work during morning hours.
The administration lawyers and
Franklin have begun preparation of
their final written briefs in the case.
The documents are due one week after
receipt of the completed hearing
transcript. The last volume of the
transcript should be ready within ten
days to two weeks.

The brief closed "by demanding that
the Advisory Board refuse to make
political conformity a condition of
employment at the university."
The faculty members asked the
Advisory Board to recommend that
President Richard Lyman "drop all
charges against Professor Franklin and
reinstate him at once." The faculty also
asked that the administration pay
Franklin's expenses in the case.
Professor Raymond Giraud,
Chairman of the Department of French
and Italian, said the brief was initiated
by a "group of faculty members who
felt their interests threatened in this
case."
The faculty group was allowed to
submit a written brief after the Board
rejected its original request in
September to participate as a party
throughout the hearing.
ACLU Request
The ACLU was also invited to
submit written arguments after the
Board turned down its request
Thursday for thirty minutes of oral
arguments to state ACLU positions on
civil liberties involved in the case.
Dershowitz said he had been
authorized to prepare arguments by
both the national and regional boards
of the ACLU.

Dershowitz is visiting this year at
Stanford's Center for Advanced Study
in the Behavioral Sciences. One
"contact" which apparently concerned
the Board is Franklin co-counsel Joel
Klein, who is also Dershowitz's
assistant at the Behavioral Sciences
"think tank."
Kennedy denied that relationship
was the "exclusive trigger" of the
Board's request. But he said, "There
might obviously be some perception on
the part of people that his relationship
with Joel raised questions."
Dershowitz said, "Joel and I are
working together on other matters, but
we're not working together on this
matter."
He said the national ACLU board
was "adamant" in rejecting the request
for contacts. But the
"accommodation," involving Kaplan
and Brest in preparation of the brief,
will apparently satisfy the Board and
eliminate the request for "contacts."
Dershowitz insisted the ACLU was
"not coming in on anybody's side." He
said the ACLU wanted to suggest "rules
to the Board that would maximally
protect" the civil liberties involved.
Calling the Franklin case nationally
important, Dershowitz said, "The eyes
of many universities will focus on the
result reached in this case and the rules
laid down."

The daily public hearings are over in
the six-week-long dismissal hearing of
Professor H. Bruce Franklin. But the
seven professors on the Advisory Board
judging the case have just begun a
month or more of deliberations.
According to Biology Professor
Donald Kennedy, the Board's
Chairman, the Board will meet
Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays
from 1 to 5 p.m. for "general
discussions of issues" in the case.
But between the group meetings,
"subcommittees" assigned to particular
questions in the case will read through
several thousands of pages of
transcripts.
The Board members expect to spend
as much time in deliberations as they
did sitting through the daily afternoon
sessions. The deliberation schedule will
involve night and morning work, for
"increased flexibility," according to
Sociology Professor Sanford
Dornbusch.
After a two-hour meeting yesterday
morning, two Board members finally
found time to leave town for special
projects.
Wolfgang Panofsky, Director of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center,
went to Washington, D.C., for two days
to attend a panel meeting which had
been delayed until the Franklin
hearings were completed.
Religion Professor Robert McAfee
Brown left for a speaking engagement
on the East coast. The Board's next full

meeting is scheduled for Friday, when
he returns.
Other members of the Board are
catching up with long-delayed work on
campus. Dornbusch said, "I'm going to
have six hours of office hours on
Wednesday for my Soc. 1 students.
That's to make up for the office hours I
haven't been having."
He said his afternoons on the Board
"hurt my teaching a lot" because he
had no time to offer research seminars
for his beginning sociology class.
Panofsky's secretary, Mary Beth
Jensen, said the SLAC administrator
has "managed to keep up with his work
pretty well" during the hearings by

"sandwiching in an amazing amount"
of work during morning hours.
The administration lawyers and
Franklin have begun preparation of
their final written briefs in the case.
The documents are due one week after
receipt of the completed hearing
transcript. The last volume of the
transcript should be ready within ten
days to two weeks.

dispute, but he ran into Lassie on his way by Lake Lag. As a result, the dispute
will have to be submitted to a kennel advisory board. All power to the puppies.
Forty faculty members yesterday
asked that charges be dropped against
Professor H. Bruce Franklin. The
recommendation was part of a 22-page
written brief filed with the faculty
Advisory Board as the Board began
deliberating the charges against the
teacher-revolutionary.
A second brief, from the American
Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), has been
delayed by the ACLU's rejection of a
Board request. The Board asked the
ACLU to describe any contacts it had
with either Franklin or the
administration, the parties in the case.
Harvard Law School Professor Alan
Dershowitz, who is representing the
ACLU, called the request
"unprecedented and unreasonable" and
a "violation of confidentiality."
The request for contacts reportedly
followed questions within the Board
concerning Dershowitz's relations to
Franklin's defense team.
Board Chairman Donald Kennedy
said the Board is "seeking some kind of
accommodation" that will satisfy both
the Board and the ACLU.
Apparently, Stanford Law School
Professors Paul Brest and John Kaplan
will join Dershowitz in preparing the
ACLU brief in return for cancellation
of the Board's request for "contacts."
Faculty Brief
The faculty's brief was signed by 4 0
professors in four hours, according to
Political Science Professor Charles
Drekmeier. He said additional
signatures will be sought.

Board's request. But he said, "There
might obviously be some perception on
the part of people that his relationship
with Joel raised questions."
Dershowitz said, "Joel and I are
working together on other matters, but
we're not working together on this
matter."
He said the national ACLU board
was "adamant" in rejecting the request
for contacts. But the
"accommodation," involving Kaplan
and Brest in preparation of the brief,
will apparently satisfy the Board and
eliminate the request for "contacts."
Dershowitz insisted the ACLU was
"not coming in on anybody's side." He
said the ACLU wanted to suggest "rules
to the Board that would maximally
protect" the civil liberties involved.
Calling the Franklin case nationally
important, Dershowitz said, "The eyes
of many universities will focus on the
result reached in this case and the rules
laid down."

The daily public hearings are over in
the six-week-long dismissal hearing of
Professor H. Bruce Franklin. But the
seven professors on the Advisory Board
judging the case have just begun a
month or more of deliberations.
According to Biology Professor
Donald Kennedy, the Board's
Chairman, the Board will meet
Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays
from 1 to 5 p.m. for "general
discussions of issues" in the case.
But between the group meetings,
"subcommittees" assigned to particular
questions in the case will read through
several thousands of pages of
transcripts.
The Board members expect to spend
as much time in deliberations as they
did sitting through the daily afternoon
sessions. The deliberation schedule will
involve night and morning work, for
"increased flexibility," according to
Sociology Professor Sanford
Dornbusch.
After a two-hour meeting yesterday
morning, two Board members finally
found time to leave town for special
projects.
Wolfgang Panofsky, Director of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center,
went to Washington, D.C., for two days
to attend a panel meeting which had
been delayed until the Franklin
hearings were completed.
Religion Professor Robert McAfee
Brown left for a speaking engagement
on the East coast. The Board's next full

meeting is scheduled for Friday, when
he returns.
Other members of the Board are
catching up with long-delayed work on
campus. Dornbusch said, "I'm going to
have six hours of office hours on
Wednesday for my Soc. 1 students.
That's to make up for the office hours I
haven't been having."
He said his afternoons on the Board
"hurt my teaching a lot" because he
had no time to offer research seminars
for his beginning sociology class.
Panofsky's secretary, Mary Beth
Jensen, said the SLAC administrator
has "managed to keep up with his work
pretty well" during the hearings by

"sandwiching in an amazing amount"
of work during morning hours.
The administration lawyers and
Franklin have begun preparation of
their final written briefs in the case.
The documents are due one week after
receipt of the completed hearing
transcript. The last volume of the
transcript should be ready within ten
days to two weeks.

Forty faculty members yesterday
asked that charges be dropped against
Professor H. Bruce Franklin. The
recommendation was part of a 22-page
written brief filed with the faculty
Advisory Board as the Board began
deliberating the charges against the
teacher-revolutionary.
A second brief, from the American
Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), has been
delayed by the ACLU's rejection of a
Board request. The Board asked the
ACLU to describe any contacts it had
with either Franklin or the
administration, the parties in the case.
Harvard Law School Professor Alan
Dershowitz, who is representing the
ACLU, called the request
"unprecedented and unreasonable" and
a "violation of confidentiality."
The request for contacts reportedly
followed questions within the Board
concerning Dershowitz's relations to
Franklin's defense team.
Board Chairman Donald Kennedy
said the Board is "seeking some kind of
accommodation" that will satisfy both
the Board and the ACLU.
Apparently, Stanford Law School
Professors Paul Brest and John Kaplan
will join Dershowitz in preparing the
ACLU brief in return for cancellation
of the Board's request for "contacts."
Faculty Brief
The faculty's brief was signed by 4 0
professors in four hours, according to
Political Science Professor Charles
Drekmeier. He said additional
signatures will be sought.
The brief closed "by demanding that
the Advisory Board refuse to make
political conformity a condition of
employment at the university."
The faculty members asked the
Advisory Board to recommend that
President Richard Lyman "drop all
charges against Professor Franklin and
reinstate him at once." The faculty also
asked that the administration pay
Franklin's expenses in the case.
Professor Raymond Giraud,
Chairman of the Department of French
and Italian, said the brief was initiated
by a "group of faculty members who
felt their interests threatened in this
case."
The faculty group was allowed to
submit a written brief after the Board
rejected its original request in
September to participate as a party
throughout the hearing.
ACLU Request
The ACLU was also invited to
submit written arguments after the
Board turned down its request
Thursday for thirty minutes of oral
arguments to state ACLU positions on
civil liberties involved in the case.
Dershowitz said he had been
authorized to prepare arguments by
both the national and regional boards
of the ACLU.

Dershowitz is visiting this year at
Stanford's Center for Advanced Study
in the Behavioral Sciences. One
"contact" which apparently concerned
the Board is Franklin co-counsel Joel
Klein, who is also Dershowitz's
assistant at the Behavioral Sciences
"think tank."
Kennedy denied that relationship
was the "exclusive trigger" of the
Board's request. But he said, "There
might obviously be some perception on
the part of people that his relationship
with Joel raised questions."
Dershowitz said, "Joel and I are
working together on other matters, but
we're not working together on this
matter."
