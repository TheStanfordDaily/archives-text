# Ten Crimes Reported To Police In 'Fairly Representative Weekend'
## 
### LANG ATWOOD 
Ten crimes ranging from a drunk resisting arrest to a
battery and assault with a deadly weapon occurred on
campus between Friday morning and Sunday evening in
what was termed "a fairly representative weekend" by a
Santa Gara County Sheriff's Department, spokesman.
The incidents reported to police include: a bomb threat
against the Aretha Franklin concert (it was not evacuated,
however); two burglaries, in one, a stereo tape deck was
stolen from a car parked on Palm Drive, in the other a
jacket was stolen from the Chemistry Building; two
malicious mischiefs; a strong-arm robbery of a wallet in
Roble Hall after the victim was hit over the head with a
chair and punched; and one reported stolen car.
Two incidents were related to the UCLA football game:
a man from Los Angeles was arrested for being drunk in
public and resisting arrest after he refused to get off the
field, and a young East Palo Alto resident was taken into
custody after he allegedly took a football ticket from a
woman and then threatened her with a knife when she tried
to get it back.
Crowbar Attack
In the most serious incident, a young woman was taken
to Stanford Hospital early Saturday morning after she was
attacked in Roble Hall with a crowbar. Police issued an all
points bulletin for a 1963 white-over-blue Pontiac
convertible bearing California license BNU 584 , containing
three male suspects and one female suspect, in connection
with the incident.

The weekend crimes, which appear startling to some, fit
into the normal pattern here, according to police statistics.
More crimes are being committed, and of a more serious
nature than before.
During the 1970- 71 school year both the number of
crimes committed and the number of persons arrested
increased over the year before and reached a level double
that of 1967-68.
There were 492 reported burglaries in '70-'7l , 368 in
'6 9-'7 0 and only 112 in '6 7-'6 8. Thefts in '70-'7l
numbered 1338 (including 686 bicycles, which are not
included in this category for previous years), against 600
the year before. Arsons hit an all-time high of 11 last year;
there were three the year before.
Rapes Down
Batteries, robberies and rapes all declined slightly last
year. Only 20 batteries reported in '70-'7l, 23 the year
before; seven robberies last year, nine in '69-'7O; and only
three reported rapes last year against five the year before.
Reports of indecent exposure, stolen vehicles and
narcotics violations all showed increases. Five cases of
indecent exposure in '69-'7O, 11 were reported last year.
Only 55 vehicles were stolen in '69-'7O compared to 83 last
year. And five persons were arrested for narcotics violations
last year, only three the year before.
Police officials acknowledge that the crime rate is now
high on campus, but claim that they can't reduce it
significantly until the community becomes aware of the
situation and begins to take an active role in combatting
crime.

'6 9-'7 0 and only 112 in '6 7-'6 8. Thefts in '70-'7l
numbered 1338 (including 686 bicycles, which are not
included in this category for previous years), against 600
the year before. Arsons hit an all-time high of 11 last year;
there were three the year before.
Rapes Down
Batteries, robberies and rapes all declined slightly last
year. Only 20 batteries reported in '70-'7l, 23 the year
before; seven robberies last year, nine in '69-'7O; and only
three reported rapes last year against five the year before.
Reports of indecent exposure, stolen vehicles and
narcotics violations all showed increases. Five cases of
indecent exposure in '69-'7O, 11 were reported last year.
Only 55 vehicles were stolen in '69-'7O compared to 83 last
year. And five persons were arrested for narcotics violations
last year, only three the year before.
Police officials acknowledge that the crime rate is now
high on campus, but claim that they can't reduce it
significantly until the community becomes aware of the
situation and begins to take an active role in combatting
crime.

OFF THE FIELD—The man receiving all the attention from some Santa Clara
County Sheriff Deputies was arrested at Saturday's UCLA football game. He was
reportedly a Los Angeles resident who refused to leave the field and was arrested
for being drunk in public and resisting arrest.
Ten crimes ranging from a drunk resisting arrest to a
battery and assault with a deadly weapon occurred on
campus between Friday morning and Sunday evening in
what was termed "a fairly representative weekend" by a
Santa Gara County Sheriff's Department, spokesman.
The incidents reported to police include: a bomb threat
against the Aretha Franklin concert (it was not evacuated,
however); two burglaries, in one, a stereo tape deck was
stolen from a car parked on Palm Drive, in the other a
jacket was stolen from the Chemistry Building; two
malicious mischiefs; a strong-arm robbery of a wallet in
Roble Hall after the victim was hit over the head with a
chair and punched; and one reported stolen car.
Two incidents were related to the UCLA football game:
a man from Los Angeles was arrested for being drunk in
public and resisting arrest after he refused to get off the
field, and a young East Palo Alto resident was taken into
custody after he allegedly took a football ticket from a
woman and then threatened her with a knife when she tried
to get it back.
Crowbar Attack
In the most serious incident, a young woman was taken
to Stanford Hospital early Saturday morning after she was
attacked in Roble Hall with a crowbar. Police issued an all
points bulletin for a 1963 white-over-blue Pontiac
convertible bearing California license BNU 584 , containing
three male suspects and one female suspect, in connection
with the incident.

The weekend crimes, which appear startling to some, fit
into the normal pattern here, according to police statistics.
More crimes are being committed, and of a more serious
nature than before.
During the 1970- 71 school year both the number of
crimes committed and the number of persons arrested
increased over the year before and reached a level double
that of 1967-68.
There were 492 reported burglaries in '70-'7l , 368 in
'6 9-'7 0 and only 112 in '6 7-'6 8. Thefts in '70-'7l
numbered 1338 (including 686 bicycles, which are not
included in this category for previous years), against 600
the year before. Arsons hit an all-time high of 11 last year;
