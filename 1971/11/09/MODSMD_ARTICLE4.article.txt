# Library Workers Complain
## Grievance Procedures Criticized 
### BOB MICHELET 
An organization of Stanford Library workers has
complained about new university grievance
procedures for staff members, claiming their
proposals were ignored in the formulation of the
plan.
The Personnel Committee of the Library Staff
Association, which submitted a detailed proposal to
the university's Personnel Office during revision of
the system last summer, says it objects to several
major points of the new procedure.
Its objections were expressed in a letter in late
September to Robert Nelson, then Director of
Personnel and Employee Relations. The new
procedures went into effect recently (see Daily,
October 25).
The main feature of the university's plan is the
inclusion of an outside arbitrator to hear the case and
make a final decision. The 400-member library staff
group says, however, the principle of an outside
arbitrator as exists in the university's system "is
directly contrary to any principle of university
self-government."
Self-Government
Their letter cites a statement last February by
President Lyman which read, in part, that if the
"campus community ... is to retain control of its
affairs it must develop a genuine capacity to govern
itself."
They claim the new policy is not in keeping with
this concept, in that the final decision rests with a
person outside the Stanford community.
Sherry Bissell, Vice President of the Library Staff
Association, says the new procedure will make the
staff feel less a part of the university community and
may lead to further complications in
administration-staff relations.
She calls the new system the "final alienation" of
the staff from the university administration.
C.uy Deßall, a Personnel Committee member
involved in writing the Association's proposals, says it
objects "to having a problem solved by an outside
person," and adds "if this is a community we should
solve our own problems."

The Association argues that an outside arbitrator
denies a process of judgment by peers to staff
members. In their own plan the group suggested the
final decision rest with a five-member panel of
randomly-selected staff members.
Deßall notes there were no changes of substance in
the administration's plan after the Association
submitted its suggestions.
The Association says its proposal "seeks to
institute a genuinely responsible and representative
group for judging cases of staff discipline," and calls
the plan for an arbitrator "divisive and unjust"
because "it differentiates. . . between faculty and
students who may be judged by their peers, and staff
who may not."
Bissell notes "we haven't had a way of questioning
the rules, no way of participating in forming them."
Deßall adds that although the staff cannot affect
university rules, "in other ways, staff could be
effective" by judging rules in individual cases.
The Committee's letter says "since employees have
no voice in the formation of University rules and
policy . . . there must be employee participation in
enforcement if these policies are to be respected."
It adds that "it is especially important that rules
be upheld by the peers of those who come under
disciplinary action."
Assumes Prior Guilt
The Association also claims that the university
procedure assumes prior guilt rather than innocence.
Under the system, it is up to the affected employee
to start grievance procedures following a university
action (i.e., suspension, pay reduction, etc.).
The committee's letter claims "the staff member is
required to establish his innocence although the
university administration is not required to establish
his guilt." Deßall says it "should be up to the
administration" to show guilt.
But the broader argument of the Association
against the new procedure is not one of fact, but
rather of philosophy—of whai, Deßall calls the
"difference between what is said and what is done"
by the administration.

Critics claim the system treats staff members in a
strict management-labor manner, while the
administration talks of a unified community with self
government.
"If this is an industrial environment—fine," Deßall
says, "but it isn't. Rhetoric has always felt that this is
a community—that Stanford is different—and it is."
The Committee's letter observes "this procedure
seems to be based on the most constricted
employer-employee labor relations view of the
university and its staff."
Standard Industrial Relations
Deßall claims "the Personnel Office is taking a
standard industrial relations approach," and says the
system is creating "a straight them-and-us situation."
Bissell notes that every segment of the university
can gain from a true community approach. "When
you feel part of the community, you work harder,"
she says. There is "a feeling that you're contributing
to the whole business of education ... of what the
university can and should be."
Both agree the alleged inequities in the new system
may result in additional problems in dealings between
the university and its staff.
"If you take the straight industrial relations
approach," Deßall says, "if you run into union
problems, you shouldn't be surprised. ... If the staff
doesn't have an outlet when the pressure is on, all
their work goes down ... in the long term, it all
breaks down."
Bissell foresees that "they're going to have more
internal trouble," and though personally opposed to
unionization of staff, feels the administration's
position may force such action.
"It would be nicer to feel we had a voice without
having to resort to tactics that may dehumanize us,"
she says, but adds "power is the only kind of thing
the administration will listen to . . . I'm not sure (the
administration) thought of all the consequences."
"The university has enough problems," she says,
"dealing with students, professors and getting money;
if it had to add labor arbitration, it would be an
additional burden."

to the whole business of education ... of what the
university can and should be."
Both agree the alleged inequities in the new system
may result in additional problems in dealings between
the university and its staff.
"If you take the straight industrial relations
approach," Deßall says, "if you run into union
problems, you shouldn't be surprised. ... If the staff
doesn't have an outlet when the pressure is on, all
their work goes down ... in the long term, it all
breaks down."
Bissell foresees that "they're going to have more
internal trouble," and though personally opposed to
unionization of staff, feels the administration's
position may force such action.
"It would be nicer to feel we had a voice without

she says, but adds "power is the only kind of thing

"The university has enough problems," she says,
"dealing with students, professors and getting money;

additional burden."
An organization of Stanford Library workers has
complained about new university grievance
procedures for staff members, claiming their
proposals were ignored in the formulation of the
plan.
The Personnel Committee of the Library Staff
Association, which submitted a detailed proposal to
the university's Personnel Office during revision of
the system last summer, says it objects to several
major points of the new procedure.
Its objections were expressed in a letter in late
September to Robert Nelson, then Director of
Personnel and Employee Relations. The new
procedures went into effect recently (see Daily,
October 25).
The main feature of the university's plan is the
inclusion of an outside arbitrator to hear the case and
make a final decision. The 400-member library staff
group says, however, the principle of an outside
arbitrator as exists in the university's system "is
directly contrary to any principle of university
self-government."
Self-Government
Their letter cites a statement last February by
President Lyman which read, in part, that if the
"campus community ... is to retain control of its
affairs it must develop a genuine capacity to govern
itself."
They claim the new policy is not in keeping with
this concept, in that the final decision rests with a
person outside the Stanford community.
Sherry Bissell, Vice President of the Library Staff
Association, says the new procedure will make the
staff feel less a part of the university community and
may lead to further complications in
administration-staff relations.
She calls the new system the "final alienation" of
the staff from the university administration.
C.uy Deßall, a Personnel Committee member
involved in writing the Association's proposals, says it
objects "to having a problem solved by an outside
person," and adds "if this is a community we should
solve our own problems."

The Association argues that an outside arbitrator
denies a process of judgment by peers to staff
members. In their own plan the group suggested the
final decision rest with a five-member panel of
randomly-selected staff members.
Deßall notes there were no changes of substance in
the administration's plan after the Association
submitted its suggestions.
The Association says its proposal "seeks to
institute a genuinely responsible and representative
group for judging cases of staff discipline," and calls
the plan for an arbitrator "divisive and unjust"
because "it differentiates. . . between faculty and
students who may be judged by their peers, and staff
who may not."
Bissell notes "we haven't had a way of questioning
the rules, no way of participating in forming them."
Deßall adds that although the staff cannot affect
university rules, "in other ways, staff could be
effective" by judging rules in individual cases.
The Committee's letter says "since employees have
no voice in the formation of University rules and
policy . . . there must be employee participation in
enforcement if these policies are to be respected."
It adds that "it is especially important that rules
be upheld by the peers of those who come under
disciplinary action."
Assumes Prior Guilt
The Association also claims that the university
procedure assumes prior guilt rather than innocence.
Under the system, it is up to the affected employee
to start grievance procedures following a university
action (i.e., suspension, pay reduction, etc.).
The committee's letter claims "the staff member is
required to establish his innocence although the
university administration is not required to establish
his guilt." Deßall says it "should be up to the
administration" to show guilt.
But the broader argument of the Association
against the new procedure is not one of fact, but
rather of philosophy—of whai, Deßall calls the
"difference between what is said and what is done"
by the administration.

Critics claim the system treats staff members in a
strict management-labor manner, while the
administration talks of a unified community with self
government.
"If this is an industrial environment—fine," Deßall
says, "but it isn't. Rhetoric has always felt that this is
a community—that Stanford is different—and it is."
The Committee's letter observes "this procedure
seems to be based on the most constricted
employer-employee labor relations view of the
university and its staff."
Standard Industrial Relations
Deßall claims "the Personnel Office is taking a
standard industrial relations approach," and says the
system is creating "a straight them-and-us situation."
Bissell notes that every segment of the university
can gain from a true community approach. "When
you feel part of the community, you work harder,"
she says. There is "a feeling that you're contributing
to the whole business of education ... of what the
university can and should be."
Both agree the alleged inequities in the new system
may result in additional problems in dealings between

administration" to show guilt.
But the broader argument of the Association
against the new procedure is not one of fact, but
rather of philosophy—of whai, Deßall calls the
"difference between what is said and what is done"
by the administration.

Critics claim the system treats staff members in a
strict management-labor manner, while the
administration talks of a unified community with self
government.
"If this is an industrial environment—fine," Deßall
says, "but it isn't. Rhetoric has always felt that this is
a community—that Stanford is different—and it is."
The Committee's letter observes "this procedure
seems to be based on the most constricted
employer-employee labor relations view of the
university and its staff."
Standard Industrial Relations
Deßall claims "the Personnel Office is taking a
standard industrial relations approach," and says the
system is creating "a straight them-and-us situation."
Bissell notes that every segment of the university
can gain from a true community approach. "When
you feel part of the community, you work harder,"
she says. There is "a feeling that you're contributing
to the whole business of education ... of what the
university can and should be."
Both agree the alleged inequities in the new system
may result in additional problems in dealings between
the university and its staff.
"If you take the straight industrial relations
approach," Deßall says, "if you run into union
problems, you shouldn't be surprised. ... If the staff
doesn't have an outlet when the pressure is on, all
their work goes down ... in the long term, it all
breaks down."
Bissell foresees that "they're going to have more
internal trouble," and though personally opposed to
unionization of staff, feels the administration's
position may force such action.
"It would be nicer to feel we had a voice without
having to resort to tactics that may dehumanize us,"
she says, but adds "power is the only kind of thing
the administration will listen to . . . I'm not sure (the
administration) thought of all the consequences."
"The university has enough problems," she says,
"dealing with students, professors and getting money;
if it had to add labor arbitration, it would be an
additional burden."
An organization of Stanford Library workers has
complained about new university grievance
procedures for staff members, claiming their
proposals were ignored in the formulation of the
plan.
The Personnel Committee of the Library Staff
Association, which submitted a detailed proposal to
the university's Personnel Office during revision of
the system last summer, says it objects to several
major points of the new procedure.
Its objections were expressed in a letter in late
September to Robert Nelson, then Director of
Personnel and Employee Relations. The new
procedures went into effect recently (see Daily,
October 25).
The main feature of the university's plan is the
inclusion of an outside arbitrator to hear the case and
make a final decision. The 400-member library staff
group says, however, the principle of an outside
arbitrator as exists in the university's system "is
directly contrary to any principle of university
self-government."
Self-Government
Their letter cites a statement last February by
President Lyman which read, in part, that if the
"campus community ... is to retain control of its
affairs it must develop a genuine capacity to govern
itself."
They claim the new policy is not in keeping with
this concept, in that the final decision rests with a
person outside the Stanford community.
Sherry Bissell, Vice President of the Library Staff
Association, says the new procedure will make the
staff feel less a part of the university community and
may lead to further complications in
administration-staff relations.
She calls the new system the "final alienation" of
the staff from the university administration.
C.uy Deßall, a Personnel Committee member
involved in writing the Association's proposals, says it
objects "to having a problem solved by an outside
person," and adds "if this is a community we should
solve our own problems."

The Association argues that an outside arbitrator
denies a process of judgment by peers to staff
members. In their own plan the group suggested the
final decision rest with a five-member panel of
randomly-selected staff members.
Deßall notes there were no changes of substance in
the administration's plan after the Association
submitted its suggestions.
The Association says its proposal "seeks to
institute a genuinely responsible and representative
group for judging cases of staff discipline," and calls
the plan for an arbitrator "divisive and unjust"
because "it differentiates. . . between faculty and
students who may be judged by their peers, and staff
who may not."
Bissell notes "we haven't had a way of questioning
the rules, no way of participating in forming them."
Deßall adds that although the staff cannot affect
university rules, "in other ways, staff could be
effective" by judging rules in individual cases.
The Committee's letter says "since employees have
no voice in the formation of University rules and
policy . . . there must be employee participation in
enforcement if these policies are to be respected."
It adds that "it is especially important that rules
be upheld by the peers of those who come under
disciplinary action."
Assumes Prior Guilt
The Association also claims that the university
procedure assumes prior guilt rather than innocence.
Under the system, it is up to the affected employee
to start grievance procedures following a university
action (i.e., suspension, pay reduction, etc.).
The committee's letter claims "the staff member is
required to establish his innocence although the
university administration is not required to establish
his guilt." Deßall says it "should be up to the
administration" to show guilt.
But the broader argument of the Association
against the new procedure is not one of fact, but
rather of philosophy—of whai, Deßall calls the
"difference between what is said and what is done"
