"Man cannot live on bread
alone." Up until six weeks ago, if
Man was dependent on the
cafeteria at Tresidder Memorial
Union for his bread, he may have
just as well have given up on living.
The Tresidder food service had ail
of the worst features of the
grimier institutional kitchens of
history. The Tresidder patron was
as one with Caesar's legions, the
inmates of Bedlam, the defenders
of Tobruk, the crew of the
Bounty. Salt pork and hardtack.
The transformation of
Tresidder from one of the world's

Director retired to Oregon last
April), the powers that be, due
undoubtedly to some grievous
error, went instead to the Clift
Hotel in San Francisco, where
Schafer was in charge of feeding
the masses.
Feeding the masses at the Clift
is not like feeding the masses at
Folsom. The Clift is just about the
snootiest hotel west of Fifth
Avenue (the snootiest hotel east
of Fifth Avenue is probably the
Carlyle, just for the record). Not
only does the Clift have dress
regulations for their dining room,

strategic places, and that the
windows be cleaned.
But S chafer's greatest
contribution (aside from lowering
the outrageous prices to
something more or less
reasonable), was in the area of
food quality and menu variety. It
is obvious that he either fired the
old chef or bought him a copy of
The Joy of Cooking. The food,
which once was bought used from
the Faculty Club (another rumor I
cannot confirm) is now
apparently purchased fresh from a
reputable distributor. As was true
in the past, the fat content of the
Tresidder hamburger seems to
have moved with the price, in this
case down. It is no longer
necessary to smother it in
mustard, mayonnaise, relish and
onion. It can stand on its own. It
may not taste like much, but it
won't hurt you.
The quality of the entrees has
improved to the point that
Tresidder is now competitive, in
both price and quality, with most
restaurants in this area. I shall
never forget the moment when
Tresidder came of age. There was
Schafer himself, behind the
counter, meeting his public (truly
a man of the peopleâ€”could you
imagine Henri Soule waiting on
tables at Le Pavilion, smiling and
dishing out pate?)
"What would you like, Sir?"
quoth he. "We have some nice
lamb curry, with condiments. The
condiments are raisins, coconut
and chutney sauce."
Raisins, coconut and chutney
sauce. Chutney sauce. I hadn't
even noticed that he called me
"sir." Oh my. Chutney sauce.
But with all the improvements
that have been made, there is still
room for Tresidder to move
ahead. For instance, it stands to
reason that any kitchen capable of
turning out a quiche lorraine or
beef tips with mushrooms can
produce a more imaginative
dessert than cake. Hew about,
say, cherries jubilee, or a nice
creme brulee, for openers. And
why must a humble green salad
sell for 30 cents?
Then there is the question of
variety. Several years ago, in one
of its less rational moments, the
Black Student Union demanded
that Tresidder serve up some soul
food. The famous Tresidder
"enchilada" should have been fair
warning of what the then master
chef could do with ethnic food.
Can you imagine that genius of
Middle-American mediocrity
tackling ham hocks and chitlins?

Fortunately, he never tried.
But now, the Tresidder kitchen
has become adventurous. Perhaps
blaekeye peas are no longer out of
the realm of the possible. Not to
mention cous-cous, sushiyama,
falafel, or a piece of kishka.
As the astute reader has
probable noticed, Schafer and
crew are about to become the
victims of rising expectations.
Last week 1 almost complained to
the management because my lima
beans were a bit pale. Two
months ago, the beans would have
had to walk about on the plate
making insulting gestures before I
would consider complaining.
There are other problems.
The staff is so polite now, with
their "sirs" and "madams" and
"thank you's," that one feels
consrained to respond. The result

is a Tresidder first: lines. No more
pushing or shoving, no more
spontaneity.
And the bus boys/girls are so
damned zealous (average time of
30 seconds before they clean your
table after you have taken your
last sip of ten-cents-a-cup coffee)
that it is almost impossible to find
a used copy of the Chronicle any
more.
But then, I wonder if the
Chronicle wouldn't seem out of
place in the new Tresidder. It is
hard to imagine spilling Coquilles
St. Jacques on the Chronicle. The
New York Times, perhaps, but
not the Chronicle.
Lee Schafer has introduced
sanitation, good service and good
taste into Tresidder's heretofore
chaotic operation.
Bon appctit, Mr. Schafer.
