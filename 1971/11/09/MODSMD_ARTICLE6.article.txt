least attractive eateries to one of
Palo Alto's better restaurants, is
due largely to the personal
guidance of the new Food Service
Director, Mr. Lee Schafer. My
mother thanks him.
Schafer has done an amazing
job of cleaning the Augean tables
of the Union. Remember the old
days, the days of 8.5., Before
Schafer? Tresidder was dirty
filthy, with a homey kind of stink
that reminded one of moldy
bread. The famous Tresidder
greaseburger, guaranteed to maim
if not kill, whose price and fat
content rose together like stars on
the eastern horizon. A variety of
delicious sauces and relishes were
available to smother the offensive
meat, which never ceased to
remind one that he was in reality
consuming a piece of dead cow.
The famous Tresidder entrees,
served, occassionally, for
four-and-one-half hours out of
every day: dry meat loaf, wet
chicken, and an "enchilada,"
which while palatable enough was
as Mexican as french fried
potatoes.
As the quality of the food
declined and the prices rose,
patronage slipped. Food service
hours were cut, and personnel laid
off. Tresidder was dying as an
institution; judging from the odor,
it had died years ago as restaurant.
Then Lee Schafer arrived,
Escoffier in frosty glasses.
Instead of going to San
Quentin or Moffet Field for a new
Food Service Director (the old

they reportedly will refuse service
to men with "unacceptable" hair
styles. And in case you're not
aware of this when you check in,
the rules are posted in each guest
room.
(I must point out that I get all
of the above information about
the Clift second-hand. I have
personally never been in one of
their guest rooms, which start at
$20 a night for a single. I have
never dared to try the dining
room. I can only tell you what I
read in Herb Caen.)
Schafer brought his Clift Hotel
habits with him to Stanford.
Tresidder closed down for 10 days
in September for "renovation."
This is often a euphemism for
shutting down operations entirely,
and some of us were hoping. The
first thing that happened was that
the place was cleaned, possibly for
the first time since it was built.
Reliable reports say that Schafer
was on his hands and knees
inspecting the cleaning job in the
kitchen, and demanding that it be
repeated until he was satisfied.
The next step was paint. The
decor of the Tresidder dining
room has consisted, historically,
of a few plant separators, two
coat racks, a display case of
bakery items, and a lot of old
Chronicle's, all surrounded by
non-descript walls and dirty glass
windows. Schafer brightened
things up a bit by ordering that
the walls be painted in modish
stripes, that transparent gray
plastic separators be placed in
