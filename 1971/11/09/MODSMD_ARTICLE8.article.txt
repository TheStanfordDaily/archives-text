# Truth Vs. The Purple Worm
## WELCOME TO THE MONKEY HOUSE 
### 
"What is truth?" I asked David, who was
standing in a doorway in the English
department. Not a standard conversational
opener, but an obsession with me lately.
"Dialectical materialism," he said. David is
a very nice guy. He looks a lot like Prince
Valiant.
"I always thought truth was pea soup," I
said. "You know, thick and green and pea-y,
and there you are floating around in it."
"Typical decadent bourgeois attitude." He
smiled. We played badminton once over a used
Christmas wreath in O'Hare Airport. (It was
snowing and the plane was nine hours late.)
Kathy was there, of course, and the boy who
gave me the purple worm.
"I dunno, the pea soup theory always made
sense to me." We built a snowman too, who
looked exactly like Spiro T. Agnew. One of us
had taken a little American flag glued on a
toothpick from one of the trees in the airport,
so we stuck it in Spiro's lapel. Perfection.
"It's pea soup to you now." David said.
"But there's a big spoon coming to liberate
your revolutionary consciousness."
"A big spoon?"
"A big spoon coming."
After the snowman we had a snowball fight
on the scrap of lawn in front of the terminal.
We chased each other, laughing like goons, and
fell down in the snow and got all wet. Then
the plane came.
"Gonna scoop you right out of that pea
soup," David said. I wonder whatever
happei, ni to the guy who gave me the purple
worm. / Sig spoon.
Jack came shuffling down the hall, so I told
him about truth. He told me about how he
hates California weather because it's nice all
the time. "I really love rotten weather," Jacn
said.

After that I went to lunch at Flo Mo.
"What is truth?" I asked the clicker, for want
of something better to say, the line moving
slowly.
"Truth?" he echoed, clicking me by. His
name is John, 1 think, and I think 1 know him
from somewhere.
"There's a big spoon coming," I told him.
He smiled.
"I do know what truth is," he answered. "I
am the Way, the Truth, and the Life."
I took a spoon, a knife and a spoon, put
back one spoon and got a fork. "Gee whiz," I

said, embarassed, "You're the Truth, eh?" I
took a tray.
"I wasn't speaking for myself," he said,
clicking. "I really believe that." I took a
napkin and slid towards the egg foo yung.
After lunch I went outside and lay on the
grass in the sun. It was hot, but good.
Whatever happened to Ferd Firko,you ask?
And Joe and Carol and Dolly? And the Mad
Rapist?
It is night. Ferd Firko is lying on his bed in
his cinderblock dorm, staring at his
roommate's poster as it slowly detatches from
the wall, the scotch tape drying up before his
eyes. Jane Fonda in "Barbarella."
Maybe I'll go down to the lounge and play a

few hands of bridge, Ferd thinks. Of course, I
should do that bio lab first. Maybe I'll go
knock on Joe's door and see if he's in. Or just
go get a drink of water and talk with the
people in the hall. Maybe I'll get up and open
the window, let a little air in here.
Ferd Firko lies motionless on his bed.
Joe and Carol lie together on Joe's bed,
listening to noises in the hall, listening for the
return of Joe's roommate. "He won't be back
for at least a half hour," Carol says. "Will he?"
Footsteps approach the door and then pass by.
"I bet Firko comes over and knocks his
head on the door," Joe says."It would be just
like him." Carol's arm begins to fall asleep.
In the TV room in the Roble basement,
Dolly is watching Johnny Carson. A girl slinks
on screen, brings Johnny a message from
backstage. "What's your name?" Johnny says.
"Yvonne."
"Well Yvonne, what do you do in your
spare time?"
"Welding."
"I never would have guessed. Where do you
do this, uh, welding?"
"Behind my father's garage."
Johnny reads the note. "Stay tuned for an
important message," the message says.
And the Mad Rapist? He is shooting baskets
on one of the courts between Wilbur and Stern.
Although it is cold, he wears no shirt, only
royal blue gym shorts and a pair of Adidas
shoes.
It is very dark. The Mad Rapist works on his
lay-up. Bounce, bounce, bounce, leap, turn,
shoot, clunk, bounce. Oh well, try again.
"Beauty is truth,"the Mad Rapist
murmurs. "Truth beauty." Bounce, bounce,
bounce, leap, turn, shoot, swish, bounce.
"That is all ye know on earth, and all ye need
to know." Nice shot, Mad Rapist.
