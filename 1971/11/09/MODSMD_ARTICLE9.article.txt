If we assume, as various proponents of
Women's Liberation have implied we should, that
from the authors of the Old Testament through
Saint Paul and Aristotle to Nietzsche and Freud
there has been a vast male conspiracy to
subjugate and exploit women, this speaks rather
badly for the women (practically all of women)
who have gone along with this hoax. It is far
likelier that, however clumsily and tactlessly, the
male "myths" reflect some durable truths.
With all due allowance for existentialist
"situation", societal (including parental)
conditioning and "role-playing", the very
persistance of these myths and their broad
acceptance indicate that despite all the overlays
of will-propelled mind, there are metaphysical or
physical givens which antedate man and dog him
through his history and recurrently overwhelm
his constructs. For example, Heidegger asserts
that the "finite and limited character of human
existence is more primordial than man himself."
More recently, Gabriel Marcel has argued that we
have been too quick to accept the one-sided
notion that "existence precedes essence". Camus
in his later writings rediscovered that man had a
nature after all.
The societal manipulations outlined by social
scientists like the Bems are thus only half the
picture (leaving aside, for the moment, the
question of the accuracy or completeness of their
data). Unless we want to be guilty of
"calumniating life" (Nietzsche), we ought to at
least try to see it whole in its concrete
manifestations: we must respect the fact that, in
sober reality, the vast majority of men and
women have tended to act or appear in certain
ways, and we must never let go of this
concreteness when confronted by attempts,
however well-meaning, to prove that it could all
be otherwise. Only the lived experience together
with a profound effort of mind can begin to tell
us anything about the phenomenon of man as
opposed to the schemata of an Utopian order
projected into a vague and altogether uninviting
future.
The absolute equality of women and men is
grounded in the perfect reciprocity of
transcendence (doing or striving) and immanence
(being or stasis). This law is clearly visible only in
a prolonged series of phenomena (the case with
all such basic laws, e.g. the law of probability),
but that is precisely what we are speaking of: the
male-female relationship throughout history, or
at least lengthy stretches of it. Although both
poles (transcendence and immanence) obviously
function in the two sexes, the male is
generically —i.e. preponderately—characterized by
an emphasis on transcendence, the female,
immanance.
Modern biology tells us that the female is
developmentally closer to the unified organism
which preceded the bipartite phenomenon of
sexuality, hence closer to "nature" or original

Being in this sense of integrality. This is echoed
in her hormone structure according to
contemporary endocrinologists like
Gilbert-Dreyfus. Even if one disputed the
foregoing claims, it can hardly be denied that the
power to give birth is, to the male—anthropology
has documented this in thousands of ways—an
awe-inspiring "magic" power that he totally lacks.
Karen Homey has written convincingly of
"womb envy", Robert Graves of the "White
Goddess", the mother-of-us-all whom a
patriarchal culture tried to subdue in vain, with
dire consequences. The quasi-unanimity of male
silence in this regard, their embarrassment when
the question is raised, their malaise during a
birth-scene, the compensatory ritual of the
"couvade", the revelations of a few unsurpassed
geniuses—the pre-creative "void" in Pascal,
Baudelaire, Eliot; Proust's description of
substitute male creativity, Mallarme's "Gift of

The societal manipulations outlined

the Poem" which ends with a pathetic appeal to
the true this ought to arouse a few
suspicions. .. .
It is very probably because of a deficiency in
this respect of Being (in alienation from the
Source)—even Spock recognizes the extra
restlessness and aggressiveness of little boys—that
the male "runs scared" and turns to doing,
including mental or spiritual striving. He must
learn to "flv", find his dignity to a large extent
in the realm of the abstract, negation, void;
another world beyond. But any pride (or hubris)
he derives from this always eventually comes a
cropper, thanks to that implacable old law of
reciprocity. Thus the male's archetypal pattern
of action or passion is relatively extreme,
vertical, daemonic: to some varying extent, like
Lucifer or Icarus, he soars above and falls below
the female anterior norm of life. From time to
time, thanks to this anima, or feminine
component, he regains equilibrium.
Women, relatively, are temperate: at first in
terms of the original immanence, which we can
schematize as a self-sufficient point or circle—the
legendary Penelope in her home, versus the
far-adventuring Ulysses—and, further, along a
time-line, where her pattern hews more closely to
the horizontal. Thus her poetic image has been

typically that of water which seeks its own level
and flows, like a river: she goes on and can even
intermittently persuade a man to abandon his
Hamletic adolescent posture and "come on" or
"become" and mature. Her curves, however
remotely, reflect (fragments of) the immemorial
circle; her gentle grace in motion (and the
"liquefaction of her dress"), the undine flow of
the river, reflects the ancestral wholeness of
Being: water, even as it changes and moves-la
donna e mobile—is totally fluid, hence
harmonious, integral.
Men show affinities rather to the line, the
limited. Form, the sense of direction, the banks
of the river o; the dam (the transcendental
"hangup"), the Logos, law, the intervening and
delimiting word. Since transcendence evidently
implies a rising up, a spiritual man tends to
achieve his own grace or harmony through
"vision", the integration of truth, and looks up
to the sun (or another star) as the glorious
symbol of this convergent final point: a simpler
doer aspires in this same direction. Women are
inclined to integrate through the opposite
principle of grace: gravity, the convergent point
at the center of the earth. Thus the feminine
gesture par excellence is a yielding to the telluric
force, of the hand, the arms, the entire body (see
Kleist's Parable of the Puppets).
Since the realm of woman is pre-eminently
the median, her ego is stronger; men tend rather
toward the superego and the compensatory id.
"Men have very weak egos" (Phyllis McGinely).
It is apt to be in this area that the law of
reciprocity asserts itself: at almost any time a
"feminine" woman can pull the rug out from
under a man's ego, e.g. just by looking at another
man, or by judging him.
She is not so much given to violence—violence
implies a directed or channelized force—as to a
natural inner power which can be terrible
enough; it asserts itself notably in her deep
resources of love—which usually pulses in and
from her like a river rather than flashes in an
instant—and the awesome (at least to a man)
upheaval of nature in childbirth. She can make or
break a man with a look, but her pattern of
action, her outward behavior, is to repeat, more
sensible and temperate. Periods probably help in
this respect, and various other devices for
"hanging loose" such as weeping, sleeping,
diversion, amusement. She converses with an
admirable ease. Partly because of the directness
of the lineage between mother and daughter (as
opposed to son, who must very early be pushed
away) she is better off in her body and in
relation to other bodies. She is by all odds more
realistic, contrary to a sentimental Victorian
myth. She lives longer on the average. She often
stands—or should we say lies?—for life. She is
likely to finish a long novel and, if she is gifted
for self-expression, to write one. A Dante, a
Beethoven, an Einstein she is not at all inclined
to be; rather a Kme. de Lafayette, a George

Eliot, a Dorris Lessing (nothing to sneeze at
there; together with the rest of her this challenge
can be downright scary; it certainly was to
Joyce. . . ).
Theorists like the Bems and Roszaks, of
course, reject this picture either as another
elaborate male distortion (I suppose even
Finnegans Wake, let alone Ulysses, would irritate
them in this vise) or as the limning of a past to be
superseded in a rosier future when men and
women will be equal not only in the total sense
but in all specific areas of existence. Men and
women should both be "whole beings". What
sterile obsession lurks in this imperialistic
perfectionism! "If sensitivity, emotionality, and
warmth are desirable human characteristics, then
they are desirable for men as well as women. If
independence, assertiveness, intellectual
commitment are desirable human characteristics,
then they are desirable for women as well as for
men". (Bems).

Women spontaneously are attracted
by the achievement, heroic or
distinguished, of men, even ugly
men .... She needs what negates her,
as man does: the law of
complementarity is a fact of healthy
functioning, i.e. for all but a few rare
individuals who find it in themselves.

Desirable, yes—and increasingly visible in
many moderns, including the talented Bems—but
desirable to what point? What of the limits which
make life operationally livable? Beyond a certain
point, troubling consequences set in. At that
point you begin to make an unusually interesting
individual of a kind most people can ill afford to
be. Two "whole beings" of physically opposite
sex would bounce off each other like beach-balls.
I imagine such a pair installed on a bicycle built
for two: going somewhere, indubitably, but
unable to see each other head on. Underneath,
the two round wheels make an ironic comment:
locked in a single frame but never touching.
The more you develop or "bring out" the
female temperament in the male (beyond a
certain point), the more self-sufficient he
becomes (like a priest, or the "androgynous
angel" -Joyce sees in the "pure" artist), and,
although the underlying need for a complement
remains very strong, it is buried under so thick a
layer of self-cancelling factors that it takes an
enormous struggle for it to fight to the surface.
These cases are notorious in life and art and
fraught with pathetic and even tragic results. We
know, for example, of Proust, in whom, as
George Painter puts it, "there was a heterosexual
screaming to be let out". The history of
literature is loaded with leading figures who were
fatherless or mother-dominated (I have provided

a partial list in my "Plumes and Prisons") who
were forced in this way, or various other ways
(disease, deformity. . . ) into the independent
stance, at least for long lonely years. When they
have fully proven their virility or dignity to
themselves, they occasionally burst out of their
shells into wild pursuit of a woman (Swift,
Goethe, Joyce). Only rather rare individuals
(preferably geniuses) can take this life style. Who
in his right mind would try to raise his boy to be
a Proust, or anything approaching?
The same is true for women. Anyone who has
been around for a while has run into successful
professional women whose curiously specific
buried needs appear in the stricken expression of
a trapped creature. If she turns to a man of her
own profession, or a comparable level of
achievement, he is apt to be blocked not only by
his own "pale cast of thought" but, in addition,
by hers, which challeges his mind to further
competitive activity rather than relaxation. They
may, god bless them, make it anyway, break
through, but that takes extraordinary
perseverance and luck. If she turns to a simpler
man, that may work more quickly, but on the
face of it that is a strange relationship; it
certainly makes for difficulties in marriage. What
she really needs, one supposes, is an unusual man
of remarkable achievement (usually an older
man) who can "bring out the woman in her". A
Sartre, for example, in the case of Simone de
Beauvoir. But such men are had to come by and
may have other plans: they may simply not have
enough energy, in their later years, to devote
themselves to this challenging enterprise. Sartre's
grand amour it is known, was with a rather
normal lady at a point in his career when he was
beginning to weary of it all.
Those of us who have taught many girl
graduate students know that at a "certain point"
(operational limit) they tend to lose motivation,
precisely because of the foregoing considerations.
That "certain point" is usually the writing of a
dissertation, the potential scholarly book, a
particularly male endeavor. At that juncture, a
young woman seems instinctively to sense that
she is carrying herself beyond the reach of most
men, reducing her chances of effective
heterosexual relationship and marriage. Almost
any day she can see that most me.) are
spontaneously attracted to the sheer (physical or
psychic) Being of a woman, that women
spontaneously are attracted by the achievement,
heroic or distinguished, of men, even ugly men.
For her, the merely physically attractive element
is there, but it smacks of incompleteness, perhaps
philogenetic immaturity. She needs what negates
her, as man does: the law of complementarity is
a fact of healthy funcioning, i.e. for all but a few
rare individuals who find it in themselves.
