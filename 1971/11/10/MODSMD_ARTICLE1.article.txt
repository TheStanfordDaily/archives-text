# Paper Panic? Do It By Mail, Leave The Thinking To Them

### PATTY FELS 
Have a term paper due next Friday? Worrying
about how and when and where you're going to get it
done?
Forget it. Buy one.
Need a few dollars to go to the City Friday night?
Wondering how to earn the money?
Forget it. Sell an old term paper.
Termpapers, Inc., the conception of a Stanford
undergraduate, is one firm in a growing industry that
is trying to take the worry out of being a student. If
you need a paper, they'll supply it for a dollar a page;
if you need money, they're buying at roughly 60
cents a page.
So far, Termpapers, Inc. is the only supplier in the
Stanford area, but there are plenty of other similar
operations across the country.
Began Last Fall
Termpapers Unlimited began last fall in Boston.
Under the direction of Kenneth and Ward Warren, it
had sold nearly 10,000 papers by the middle of last
summer. The process is simple—a student selects his
topic from a catalogue listing papers on hand. He
pays $2 a page and receives a photostatic copy. If
there are no ready-made papers available, he can
commission an original one for $3.50 a page. Seven
days is the usual waiting period although rush jobs
can be handled for a higher price.
Original writers for Termpapers Unlimited include
graduate students, professors and professional writers.
They are all college graduates and most have Ph.D.'s
or masters. Some earn from $300-$4 00 a week and
are required to write at least fifty pages a week.
Student work is purchased for $5 a paper.
In Madison, Wisconsin, UCLA graduate Marty
Pesham handles a staff of 150 writers and two

secretaries. Ironically, the staff includes TA's and
university professors who have agreed to give A's to
students who hand in papers written by them. In fact,
9 2 percent of the ready-made papers have received
"A's" and a refund is guaranteed for anything below
a "B."
The Madison enterprise also provides research
material for people who have qualms about
out-and-out copying. Their new specialty is
take-home exams although they have balked at the
suggestion that they take in-class exams for their
clients.
Advertising Program
So far, Termpapers, Inc. hasn't started selling, but
is conducting a large advertising campaign for both
old term papers and ghost writers for original papers.
It is completely owned by one student who remains
anonymous. It is not undue caution, considering a
Northeastern student was denied his master's degree
after being revealed as a termpaper writer.
Reaction to the campaign has been surprisingly
slight. After spending $150 on Daily ads, the business
has received only 15 calls. However, some people
have a lot to offer. One graduate student volunteered
to sell a whole file of papers which he has kept since
high school—all of it "A" work.
The ghostwriters will be approved by an advisory
board. Many of them are teachers who can't find
work in the Bay Area. Others are impoverished
graduate students. Pay for the staff is fairly
high—over $2 a page. The company hopes that most
of the more inferior student papers will be eliminated
within a year. The ghost staff will continue to write
and their papers will be re-circulated.
No Duplications
Termpapers, Inc. customers follow a slightly
different procedure to order papers. Names are

optional on the order blanks but the teacher and class
are mandatory to avoid duplications. Students specify
the subject, topic and length and, for originals, they
can select an aspect on their topic. Duplicate papers
are sold only twice in the same area. The owner
noted, "We're very careful about sending the same
paper to the same college. The only problem is with
teachers who move."
There is no guarantee on the Stanford company's
papers. However, papers are read carefully before
they're accepted and "B" papers are scrutinized
closely. Since teacher comments are often written in
the margins, the graders can easily notice weaknesses
and generally reject those papers covered with
corrections.
The question of legality has been faced by all the
companies. In fact, the Boston firm has spent
$10,000 in legal fees to assure that nothing will go
wrong. In spite of this, Harvard University is thinking
of taking legal action against it. The State of
California considers Termpapers, Inc. a publishing
firm and has not given it trouble so far.
Ethical Aspect
Far more pertinent is the ethical aspect of the
business. Is it actually, as Harvard Dean Archie Epps
stated, "a strike at the heart of the academic
process?" Teachers are divided. Some maintain that it
will force professors to re-examine their program.
Others feel that it will cause those students who don't
use the system to become even more cynical about
education.
Right now Stanford's representative isn't worried,
though. He insists, "if it's plagiarism, it's on the heads
of the students who buy the papers, not the
company. If they're stupid enough to turn in the
Xerox copy, they deserve to flunk. They know
they're going to have to be careful."
