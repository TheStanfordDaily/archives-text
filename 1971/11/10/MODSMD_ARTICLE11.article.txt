# Computer Music Shifts Space
## 
### TERRIE McDONALD 
When John Chowning's computer music
"moved" the audience in the balloon-adorned
geodesic dome on White Plaza last Friday, it was
more than an emotional response to freaky sounds.
An Assistant Professor of Music, Chowning has
developed a computer-based system that uses
loudspeakers to manipulate illusory space through
the control of sound. As the introductory
demonstration for a SCIRE symposia on innovative
applications of knowledge, Chowning's project let
students participate in altering their apparent
environment.
People normally locate a sound source by means
of directional and distance cues, Channing explains.
As these audio hints are perceived, they give an
approximate fix on the object issuing the sound.
The direction from which a car approaches and its
distance from a given point can be judged by what is
heard, before the car is seen.
Chowning, who has a Ph.D. in composition and
insists that he is "a musician, not an engineer,"
learned enough computer programming to construct
a system that takes these principles out of their

ordinary context and confounds audio perception.
I lis demonstration of the project involved four
loudspeakers emitting tape-recorded music
generated by a computer. Inside the dome (illusory
acoustical space), students operated a "joy stick"
which controlled the direction and intensity of the
music coming from the loudspeakers. Wearing masks
or closing their eyes to block out their physical
environment, people standing within the dome felt
like the were moving as the sound traveled around
the enclosure, receding and advancing from speaker
to speaker.
Chowning developed the system in conjunction
with the Stanford Department of Music and the
Artificial Intelligence Project.
SCIRE Director Jane Huseby stressed that a lot
of attention has been given to innovation in
education in the form of broadened curriculum
content while approaches to that content have been
neglected.
The second SCIRE symposium will be a
multi-sensory Whole Earth Happening at 7:30 p.m.
on Friday, November 12, in the open yard of the
Cowell complex.
