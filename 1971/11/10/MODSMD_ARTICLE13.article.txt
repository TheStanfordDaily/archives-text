## Changes 
### Charlie Hoffman 
Saturday's game with UCLA represented more than the clinching
of a second consecutive Rose Bowl trip for the Indians. Several new
tactics were employed that increased the effectiveness of both the
offensive and defensive units.
The most important change in offensive strategy displayed
Saturday was the shift in Miles Moore's tactics as a split end.
Early in the season, Moore shot to the top ranks of Pac-8 receivers
as he successfully worked his way free of defenders on long streak
patterns and medium distance "out" patterns. Seeing Moore as a
threat, opposing coaches began giving him double coverage and Moore
found it hard to get open on the patterns he had been running all
year.
No Catches
Things got progressively worse for Moore and culminated in the
Washington State game when he did not catch one pass. He figured
that the time had come for a change. "The secondary men were
getting smarter and quicker and I had to change my thinking as a
receiver. So against Oregon State I started experimenting with shorter
patterns run more to the inside."
One of those inside patterns against the Beavers was instrumental
in keeping the Indians alive in the Rose Bowl race. Moore caught a 20
yard Bunce pass on a post pattern and ran 48 more yards for a
touchdown that brought Stanford to within seven points of OSU in
their great second half comeback drive.
Moore finished the OSU game with six catches for 140 yards, and
all of the passes were completed on short patterns. If the Beaver
defenders had not tried to knock Moore down at the line on most
plays, he would have had more catches.
Single Coverage
Last week against UCLA, Moore was given single coverage and he
made six catches for 109 yards, with many of the successful
completions coming on passes over the middle for 8-15 yards. This
type of pattern made his longer patterns more effective and he caught
a 29 yard pass for a touchdown.
Moore would not take much credit for his recent resurgence. "The
other guys have had to start to pay attention to John Winesberry who
is a tremendous receiver and he has taken a lot of the pressure off me
lately."
Defensively, the Indians proved to be much better at stopping the
triple option Saturday against the Bruins. Ralston insisted that, "Jeff
Siemon and Mike Simone were the main reasons we handled the
option so well." Simone was especially effective at trailing behind the
play to shut off the reverse and use his speed to take down the
ballcarrier.
* * *
Stanford's mid-week injury report is not very good, but most of
the players will be ready for the San Jose State game here Saturday.
Jeff Siemon, Dennis Peterson, and Roger Cowan are out with the flu
but are expected to be ready by Saturday.
Tom Somes is not practicing fully due to a knee injury and Miles
Moore was held out of Tuesday's contact work but will play Saturday.
John Winesberry did some running yesterday and Coach Ralston
believes that he will practice with the team this afternoon.
Hillary Shockley, Phil Satre, and Jim Kehl encouraged observers by
practicing at full speed yesterday.
