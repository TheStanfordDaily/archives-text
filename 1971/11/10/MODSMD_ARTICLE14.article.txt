# Massimino Spurs Indian Title Hopes
## 
### DOUG WILSON 
"Like most guys that play it
today, I found out I liked water
polo better than I liked
swimming. It's an individual sport,
it's a team sport—it's given me
everything I want out of
athletics."
It is apropos that a bright
yellow water-polo ball is the first
thing to catch your eye in Rick
Massimino's boathouse living
room, the ball sits where a plant
should be, in the shallow bowl
above the plaster head of a Greek
figure, in a corner by the door.
The ball belongs to Stanford's
water polo team, of which Rick is
the captain, high scorer, and
leading publicist. Despite the fact
that he is the most widely-known
Stanford player, and responsible
to a significant degree for the
success the team has enjoyed this
year, it is difficult to keep him on
the subject at hand—himself. His
mind is preoccupied with an
objective which he and the
squad's other senior players set
for themselves four years ago.
Aspirations
"Our goal is to take a team
that nobody thinks is very
good—one on which everybody
thinks only Massimino knows how
to play—and make it the national
champion."
Admittedly, the task will be
difficult. Although Stanford
sports its best water polo team
since the days of Gary Sheerer
and John Parker, they have been
defeated in squeakers by San Jose
State and UCLA, and the Bruins
won again, decisively, last
weekend.
Despite the losses, Massimino is
confident that the Indians have as
good a chance as any squad to
leave Long Beach the nation's
champion come Thanksgiving.
"We suffer from a lack of
experience in being good. That's
why we always lose eight to seven
after we're ahead. I'm convinced
that if we play a good game as a
team, which we haven't yet this
year, we are two or three goals
better than any team around."
High Scoring
If so, the chances are good that
at least one of those goals will be
put past an opposing goalie by
Massimino. He has been
responsible for almost one-third
of the total Stanford goals scored
against opponents this season (51
out of 158), and leads the team

both in scoring percentage (.646)
and assists (16).
Massimino is definitely not a
favorite of goalies, other than his
teammate and roommate,
Stanford goalie Pete Gadd. Rick is
consistently successful in penalty
throws, and earns the loud
applause of the crowd with
deftly-handled shots that appear
effortless to the spectator and
impossible to the shooter. He is,
as a result, an "established"
player, well-known and
recognized among the elite of a
sport known to be clique-ish in its
reward of talent.
"In this game, you have to
establish yourself before you are
given any recognition; but after
you get recognition, it's very
difficult for a newcomer to take
your position from you. With me,
I could screw up the whole year
and still make the All-America
team—it doesn't mean anything."
Achievement
This is perhaps a major impetus
behind Massimino's drive for
achievement this year. As Bill
Huck, the team's manager
commented:
"I think Rick would agree that
scoring one-third of our goals isn't
his foremost asset. It's his team
leadership and direction."
Stanford Coach Jim Gaughran,
himself a developer of major
acquatic talent, concurs:
"Rick is certainly one of the
outstanding players we've ever
had here at Stanford. If we were
to name an All-Star team, he'd
surely be on it. But he also does a
lot of work with the guys in
teaching techniques; he's as much
an assistant coach as he is a
player. He's a steadying
influence."
Argentinian
Born of Argentine-immigrant
parents, who have recently
returned to Argentina, both Rick
and his brother Ferdie, a standout
player for UC-Irvine, and a
member of the Pan-Am and
Olympic teams, achieved
high-school stardom in Fullerton,
Calif., as well as summer
recognition playing for a Newport
Beach AAU team.
Both Massiminos were invited
to try out for the Pan-American
team last spring, and both
participated on the 11-man
American squad which went to
Oali, Colombia and won the gold
medal by beating Cuba, 6-3

(Ferdie scoring twice), this
summer. Yet Rick has no definite
plans to continue with an eye
towards Munich '72.
"If I think 1 can contribute to
the game, I will keep on playing.
But I've been playing a long time,
and I'm not going to go on just to
make the Olympic team.
Everybody's got to stop
sometime."
Thus, the predictable goal: all
the marbles this year. "To win
this year: that's all I really
thought about, especially this
year. Representing the United

States was to me not as important 1
as playing with my friends here
and winning with them."
An 8-1-4 season (counting
tournament play) has been the
result, and it is unlikely that the
University of the Pacific or
UC-Berkeley will upset a fired-up
Stanford squad before the
nationals. And Massimino is
determined that his friends at
Stanford be given a share of the
credit by "friends" and fans of
opposing teams with higher
rankings—such as USC and UCLA.
"For years, USC and UCLA

have managed to kick our ass in
the pool, but we were always
gracious and made sure to
congratulate them. This year, we
beat USC twice; 1 went up to
several old teammates afterwards,
and found them very hostile and
nasty. I feel sorry for them."
Massimino hopes to extend his
sympathy to UCLA and San Jose
State down in Long Beach.
Then maybe he'll return that
water polo ball from his living
room and put a plant in the Greek
planter.

WATCHING THE ACTION—Rick Massimino watches from poolside
as his teammates battle with UCLA's Bruins in Los Angeles last
month. Massimino has scored 51 goals this season for the Indians,
roughly a third of all the goals scored by the team thus far this season.
