# Dolly Grievance Panel Hears More Testimony
## 
### GARY CLARK 
The grievance hearing for John
Dolly, a hospital staff member fired for
participation in last Spring's Medical
Center sit-in, went into its second day,
taking testimony which may eventually
be thrown out.
The three-man grievance board has
yet to rule on the admissibility of
defense testimony concerning the
background causes for the sit-in. The
board has taken two days of such
testimony with the understanding that
it may be ruled inadmissible at a future
time.
The University has declined to offer
prosecution testimony and has instead
filed a deposition specifying the charges
against Dolly and the evidence
supporting them. It is the position of
the University that the hearing
proceedings be limited to the
disruption itself and Dolly's actions
during that time.
The Dolly defense maintains that
the Med-Center demands were
reasonable attempts to redress
long-standing grievances, and that no
alternative channels were given to
provide redress. Consequently, they
maintain that the sit-in was a valid
means of labor negotiation given the
situation at the Med-Center.
Reverse Charges
According to Linda Crouse, who is
helping to conduct Dolly's defense,
"We are going to reverse the charges
and direct them against the University.
We maintain that there was no
disruption at the Med Center until the

University used military tactics to
handle a labor dispute."
The defense, however, is being
handicapped by one major procedural
question. Dolly has asked immunity
from punitive University action for
several witnesses who will not testify
unless immunity is granted. The
University is opposed to blanket
immunity for anyone connected with
the sit-in on the grounds that future
evidence may reveal acts by these
persons which would require
prosecution.
Grievance board member Juan
Flores objected vigorously to the
University's position on granting
immunity: "The University," he said,
"can't have it both ways. They define
anything happening after the
invocation of the (anti-disruption)
injunction as a disruption, but they will
not exempt from prosecution people
who took part in the sit-in but left
before that time."
The board, which also includes Iris
Brest of the General Secretary's office,
and Doug DuPenn of SLAC, will go
into closed session to reach a decision
with the University on questions of
immunity.
The hearings on Tuesday concerned
testimony on the history of labor
organizing at Stanford, and background
on the Sam Bridges case by Jim Berk
who has also presented Bridge's case to
the Nation Labor Relations Board. The
hearings continue on Thursday from
11:00 to 2:00 p.m. in Med Center
room M-l 12.

evidence may reveal acts by these
persons which would require
prosecution.
Grievance board member Juan
Flores objected vigorously to the
University's position on granting
immunity: "The University," he said,
"can't have it both ways. They define
anything happening after the
invocation of the (anti-disruption)
injunction as a disruption, but they will
not exempt from prosecution people
who took part in the sit-in but left
before that time."
The board, which also includes Iris
Brest of the General Secretary's office,
and Doug DuPenn of SLAC, will go
into closed session to reach a decision
with the University on questions of
immunity.
The hearings on Tuesday concerned
testimony on the history of labor
organizing at Stanford, and background
on the Sam Bridges case by Jim Berk
who has also presented Bridge's case to
the Nation Labor Relations Board. The
hearings continue on Thursday from
11:00 to 2:00 p.m. in Med Center
room M-l 12.

STANFORD DOLLY?—John Dolly's grievance hearing continued yesterday with
the defense introducing background evidence which may later be thrown out.
The grievance hearing for John
Dolly, a hospital staff member fired for
participation in last Spring's Medical
Center sit-in, went into its second day,
taking testimony which may eventually
be thrown out.
The three-man grievance board has
yet to rule on the admissibility of
defense testimony concerning the
background causes for the sit-in. The
board has taken two days of such
testimony with the understanding that
it may be ruled inadmissible at a future
time.
The University has declined to offer
prosecution testimony and has instead
filed a deposition specifying the charges
against Dolly and the evidence
supporting them. It is the position of
the University that the hearing
proceedings be limited to the
disruption itself and Dolly's actions
during that time.
The Dolly defense maintains that
the Med-Center demands were
reasonable attempts to redress
long-standing grievances, and that no
alternative channels were given to
provide redress. Consequently, they
maintain that the sit-in was a valid
means of labor negotiation given the
situation at the Med-Center.
Reverse Charges
According to Linda Crouse, who is
helping to conduct Dolly's defense,
"We are going to reverse the charges
and direct them against the University.
We maintain that there was no
disruption at the Med Center until the

University used military tactics to
handle a labor dispute."
The defense, however, is being
handicapped by one major procedural
question. Dolly has asked immunity
from punitive University action for
several witnesses who will not testify
unless immunity is granted. The
University is opposed to blanket
immunity for anyone connected with
the sit-in on the grounds that future
evidence may reveal acts by these
persons which would require
prosecution.
Grievance board member Juan
Flores objected vigorously to the
