NAACP Attacks Rehnquist
WASHINGTON (AP)—Supreme Court nominees
William H. Rehnquist and Lewis F. Powell Jr. came
under attack yesterday in testimony to the Senate
Judiciary Committee by civil rights advocates.
Meanwhile, Rehnquist, a Stanford alumnus,
submitted a sworn affidavit to the committee sa; 'ng
he is not and has not been at any time a member of
the ultra-conservative John Birch Society.
Joseph L. Rauh Jr. of the Leadership Conference
on Civil Rights called Rehnquist "a laundered
McCarthyite" and charging that he had been evasive
when he appeared before the committee last week.
"He is a lawyer without compassion for blacks and
other minorities and a lawyer who never once has
spoken up for the Bill of Rights," Rauh told the
Judiciary Committee.
Clarence Mitchell, speaking for the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People,
said that with the nomination of Rehnquist "the foot
of racism is placed in the door of the temple of
justice."
Labor Attacks Phase II
MIAMI BEACH, FIa.—AFL-CIO leaders voiced
mounting criticism yesterday of new federal wage
control in reactions ranging from caution to a call
for a general protest strike of the labor federation's
nearly 14 million members.
The Meat Cutters and several construction union
leaders urged AFL-CIO President George Meany to
quit President Nixon's 15-man labor-industry public
Pay Board, which Monday ordered a general 5.5
percent limit on future pay hikes.

The five labor members of the Pay Board,
including Meany, were outvoted 10 to 5 by the
industry and public members in the decision which
also ruled out most retroactive pay for the current
90-day wage-price freeze and indicated some
scheduled pay hikes could be rolled back.
Three Of Coral Sea Quit
SAN FRANCISCO—Three men identifying
themselves as officers from a Vietnam-bound aircraft
carrier said they submitted their resignations from the
Navy yesterday because of opposition to the war.
"We do not wish to be a part of the continuing
insanity of the Vietnam War," the men said at a news
conference in a San Francisco church. They said they
were officers aboard the USS Coral Sea, set to sail
Friday from Alameda.
All three said they would remain aboard the ship if
the Secretary of the Navy did not accept their
resignations by Friday. They said that if accepted, the
resignations would result in honorable discharges.
Chinese Confer With UN
UNITED NATIONS—In their first appearance at the
United Nations, three members of Red China's
advance guard visited headquarters yesterday to
discuss problems related to the arrival of the main
Peking delegation Thursday.
The 2-hour and 25-minute visit came as a 46-man
delegation took off from the mainland capital with a
personal send-off by Premier Chou Enlai and a
cheering crowd of thousands.
The delegation, invited by the General Assembly
in its Oct. 25 vote, is expected to take its place
formally on U.N. committees and in the 131-nation
General Assembly on Friday.

High Court Backs Women
WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court yesterday
shored up the rights of men and women to be treated
equally on the job. In one case the justices let stand a
ruling that Pan American World Airways must
consider men for stewards. In a second case, the court
refused to review a ruling—and thus let it stand—that
a South Bend, Ind., brewery cannot force women to
retire at 62 while allowing men to work until they are
65.
Nixon Takes Political Tour
CHICAGO--President Nixon, leapfrogging
half-way across the continent to help Republicans
build up a 1972 campaign war chest, called on
Congress last night to rise above partisanship and
revive the foreign aid program—or face greatly
increased danger of war in the world.
Sounding a theme of peace with prosperity, Nixon
appeared in person at a $500 per plate "salute to the
President" dinners in New York and Chicago—and via
closed circuit television in 18 other cities from coast
to coast. He used the forum not only to help the GOP
raise an estimated $5 million, but also to urge
Congress to keep alive the foreign aid program struck
down by the Senate two weeks ago.
About 2,500 demonstrators gathered outside the
Hilton Hotel here four hours before the President was
due to arrive. But by the time Nixon landed the
crowd had dwindled to about 500.
Earlier, in New York, about 200 demonstrators
were kept at a distance from the Americana Hotel,
where Nixon was speaking. A block away, 50
counterpickets demonstrated in favor of the
President. Mounted police kept both groups in their
separate areas.
