# Aide Hits Vietnam Plans
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
A Nixon aide discussed the Vietnam War here yesterday,
picturing the American decision makers as ignorant, the
North Vietnamese as villians, and the South Vietnamese as
being caught in the middle.
Dolf Droge, who is on a leave of absence from the
Agency for International Development (AID) in order to
assist the President and the National Security Council on
matters relating to Vietnam, stated his belief that the major
hindrance to American efforts in Vietnam has been that
U.S. political decision makers as well as military
commanders and the educational community have had
almost no knowledge of the Vietnamese people.
He said that "the homework gap is a very real challenge
to us."
Droge described himself as neither a hawk nor a dove,
saying that he preferred to call himself "an owl." He said
that "the owls are needed in great numbers now and there's
not much time to get them." Apparently, an "owl" would
b> one who has managed to close the Vietnam homework
gap-

A substantial portion of Droge's talk was devoted to a
history of the Vietnam War and its combatants. Droge said
that the fact that "there are three Vietnams: North, Central
and South" made unworkable any effort to either unify the
country or to continue its bisection.
He explained that since the Vietnamese had lived under
a unified government for only sixty of their 2500 years,
they would not know how to deal with unification.
U.S. Policies
Droge, who also advised former President Johnson on
the war, stated that "history will write that between 1965
and 1971, the only reason that the South Vietnamese have
not been living under the bayonets of the North
Vietnamese Army has been the presence of the United
States."
Speaking of the South Vietnamese at present, Droge said
that "they still need time for training, they need
technological and economic assistance" in order to
continue to survive after the American withdrawal. He said
that the Senate's decision to abolish the foreign aid system
was "immoral, unsupportable and unacceptable."
