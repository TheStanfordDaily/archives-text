# Venceremos Stresses 'Centralism'
## 
### KEVIN SMITH First of a series 
(Editor's Note: This article is the beginning of a series
detailing certain campus organizations: how they
operate, who operates them, who participates in
them, and what they do.
Today's article deals with Venceremos—the
revolutionary organization whose name in Spanish
means "We Will Win!")
Venceremos was formed in the summer of 19 70 as
a Marxist-Leninist revolutionary group. Before that,
most of the Venceremos membership had been in the
Brown Berets, a militant Chicano organization, fairly
inactive now, which operated somewhat along the
lines of the Black Panthers.
Aaron Manganiello, now Chairman of the
Venceremos Central Committee, was one of the
founders of the Brown Berets. Manganiello explained
the split by saying, "We began taking a more Marxist,
multi-nationalist position. The Brown Berets were
lie iming anti-Marxist and anti-Third World. They
threw us out."
Almost all of the Northern California Brown Beret
membership joined Manganiello in the split.
Manganiello said that the Brown Berets were not
"Third World" because "they said they didn't want
anything to do with 'niggers' or even Latins, only
with Mexican-born Americans."
Third World
The term "Third World" began chiefly in the
writings of Franz Fanon, a black author, who used
the term for the underdeveloped countries of the
world—those in Asia, Africa, and America—in a
hook about Third World revolution entitled The
Wretched of the Earth. Manganiello said that "Third
\ rid" as applied inside the United States means
"people of color."
Manganiello said that he could not give the size of
Venceremos' membership for "security reasons," but
rl' I say that Venceremos has grown to one and

one-half times its original size. As of now,
Venceremos is a Bay Area organization with branches
from San Francisco to San Jose.
A segment of Venceremos used to be a part of a
national organization called the Revolutionary Union
(RU). This faction thought that the RU was
becoming "racist" and "revisionist."
According to senior Don Lee, "They didn't want
to struggle. They weren't willing to fight for what
they believed in." There was a split with the RU last
Christmas. At that time, Venceremos was an
all-Chicano organization centered in the Redwood
City area which asked the former RU members to
join.
Local Section
Bruce Franklir. was one of the founders of the RU
when, in the fall of 1 967, Franklin, his wife Jane, and
a few others saw the need for a
Communist revolutionary organization. Franklin said,
"Our idea was to start a local group which would be a
local section of what a party would be if there were a
party."
They encountered people from the Richmond area
who had similar ideas. TTie RU started in California
and became national in 19 70 "when a lot of internal
contradictions became much more extreme,"
according to Franklin.
"The split occurred because," said Franklin,
"there was a contradiction on the question of Third
World leadership. All had the original agreement that
the national liberation struggle would unfold into a
proletarian revolution. We felt that they were
lowering the importance of nationalism and directing
themselves toward white workers.
Principal Contradiction
"Third World people are principal members of the
main contradiction. We don't believe that the
principal contradiction is between the bourgeoisie
and the proletariat under the capitalist system. We

believe that the contradiction is between imperialism
and the oppressed peoples and nations. The white
working class is not in the same position ... there's
no real pressure on the white working class to go
above the economic relationship."
The people of Franklin's viewpoint became more
and more upset that the emphasis within the RU was
being placed on white working class leadership rather
than Third World leadership. The split came because
"it was more and more like two organizations pasted
together," said Franklin.
The nationalizing of the organization hastened the
split. According to Franklin, "Decisions affecting a
small number of people began affecting the whole
revolutionary movement."
The RU had been working with Venceremos
people for a long time. The RU faction favoring Third
World leadership felt that their connection with RU
was inhibiting relations with Venceremos. "There
were a lot of tensions," Franklin said.
Thus the group that split off from the
Revolutionary Union joined Venceremos less than a
month after the split.
Venceremos Splits
There was also a split within the Stanford branch
of Venceremos last summer. According to an article
in the Daily of September 27, "About half of the
Stanford campus contingent. . . left the organization
this summer and re-emerged as an 'intercommunal'
subgroup of the Oakland Black Panther Party." This
group is known as the Intercommunal Survival
Committee (ISC) of the Black Panther Party.
The split was between those people (the ISC) who
wanted to concentrate on community service projects
along the lines of Huey Newton's Black Panthers and
those members who felt that the resistance or
military aspects of the "fight against, imperialism"
were primary.

here addressing a press conference following Bruce franklins suspension last
February.
One of the manifestations of this split was that
ISC members did not spend time working on behalf
of Bruce Franklin during the suspended professor's
hearing. They felt that there were more important
things to be done, such as fighting to free people on
death row.
Central Committee
Two-thirds of the Venceremos Central Committee
is Chicano. Venceremos is a Democratic Centralist
organization, which means that the members must
follow the instructions of the Central Committee,
which in turn must be responsive to the people who
elect it.
The most important function of the Central
Committee is solving problems, the solutions of
which lie in correct applications of Marxist, Leninist,
and Maoist thought.
The Central Committee's second task is generating
the "correct" political position. At a later time,
Manganiello feels this will take primary importance.
Manganiello explained that he feels Democratic
Centralism is a better system than the most
frequently used alternatives: complete dictatorship or
complete democracy.
Mao, in an essay entitled "On Correcting Mistaken

Ideas in the Party," explains the concept of a Central
Committee further: "(1) The individual is
subordinate to the organization; (2) the minority is
subordinate to the majority; (3) the lower level is
subordinate to the higher level; (4) the entire
membership is subordinate to the Central
Committee."
The Committee's followers implement its decision
immediately and mandatorily. The people have a
form of redress in that they can question and criticize
a directive, but it still must be carried out unless the
Central Committee decides that the criticisms are
valid. Manganiello felt, however, that one of the
Black Panthers' faults is that one or two people from
above tell everybody what "the line" is.
Unity Principles
There has been some Central Committee turnover.
Six to eight people have come and gone from the
Committee. Manganiello explained that the Central
Committee is not necessarily comprised of the best
leaders. It might be more important to have the best
leaders in one's own geographic area on the
Committee. Each area is represented by at least one
member. All of the Committee members are known
(open), but there are unknown (closed) members in
the organization.

Venceremos has five principles of unity: (1) The
dictatorship of the proletariat; (2) Democratic
Centralism; (3) Liberation of women; (4) The need
for an armed struggle; (5) National liberation and the
right of self-determination.
The Venceremos philosophy is perhaps best
summed up in the phrase "Power to the People."
Members believe that revolution is vital in this
country because, in Lee's words, "In this country,
there is a ruling class who hold power over not only
the people of this country, but also over the people
of the world. Russia is also an imperialist country.
The People's Republic of China is in fact a People's
Republic. We believe that Mao has done a lot to
inform the peoples of the world a great deal about
conducting a revolution.
"Venceremos and the whole revolutionary
movement are growing incredibly rapidly. People are
getting more and more tired of the shit they have to
put up with every day. The people are realizing that
the channels of change held out to them by the ruling
class in this country are a joke, a hoax, a fraud.
They're saying that it's gonna take a revolution to
straighten things out."

The Committee's followers implement its decision

form of redress in that they can question and criticize
a directive, but it still must be carried out unless the
Central Committee decides that the criticisms are

Unity Principles
There has been some Central Committee turnover.
Six to eight people have come and gone from the
Committee. Manganiello explained that the Central
Committee is not necessarily comprised of the best
leaders. It might be more important to have the best
leaders in one's own geographic area on the
Committee. Each area is represented by at least one
member. All of the Committee members are known
(open), but there are unknown (closed) members in
the organization.

Venceremos has five principles of unity: (1) The
dictatorship of the proletariat; (2) Democratic
Centralism; (3) Liberation of women; (4) The need
for an armed struggle; (5) National liberation and the
right of self-determination.
The Venceremos philosophy is perhaps best
summed up in the phrase "Power to the People."
Members believe that revolution is vital in this
country because, in Lee's words, "In this country,
there is a ruling class who hold power over not only
the people of this country, but also over the people
of the world. Russia is also an imperialist country.
The People's Republic of China is in fact a People's
Republic. We believe that Mao has done a lot to
inform the peoples of the world a great deal about
conducting a revolution.
"Venceremos and the whole revolutionary
movement are growing incredibly rapidly. People are
getting more and more tired of the shit they have to
put up with every day. The people are realizing that
the channels of change held out to them by the ruling
class in this country are a joke, a hoax, a fraud.
They're saying that it's gonna take a revolution to
straighten things out."

(Editor's Note: This article is the beginning of a series
detailing certain campus organizations: how they
operate, who operates them, who participates in
them, and what they do.
Today's article deals with Venceremos—the
revolutionary organization whose name in Spanish
means "We Will Win!")
Venceremos was formed in the summer of 19 70 as
a Marxist-Leninist revolutionary group. Before that,
most of the Venceremos membership had been in the
Brown Berets, a militant Chicano organization, fairly
inactive now, which operated somewhat along the
lines of the Black Panthers.
Aaron Manganiello, now Chairman of the
Venceremos Central Committee, was one of the
founders of the Brown Berets. Manganiello explained
the split by saying, "We began taking a more Marxist,
multi-nationalist position. The Brown Berets were
lie iming anti-Marxist and anti-Third World. They
threw us out."
Almost all of the Northern California Brown Beret
membership joined Manganiello in the split.
Manganiello said that the Brown Berets were not
"Third World" because "they said they didn't want
anything to do with 'niggers' or even Latins, only
with Mexican-born Americans."
Third World
The term "Third World" began chiefly in the
writings of Franz Fanon, a black author, who used
the term for the underdeveloped countries of the
world—those in Asia, Africa, and America—in a
hook about Third World revolution entitled The
Wretched of the Earth. Manganiello said that "Third
\ rid" as applied inside the United States means
"people of color."
Manganiello said that he could not give the size of
Venceremos' membership for "security reasons," but
rl' I say that Venceremos has grown to one and

one-half times its original size. As of now,
Venceremos is a Bay Area organization with branches
from San Francisco to San Jose.
A segment of Venceremos used to be a part of a
national organization called the Revolutionary Union
(RU). This faction thought that the RU was
becoming "racist" and "revisionist."
According to senior Don Lee, "They didn't want
to struggle. They weren't willing to fight for what
they believed in." There was a split with the RU last
Christmas. At that time, Venceremos was an
all-Chicano organization centered in the Redwood
City area which asked the former RU members to
join.
Local Section
Bruce Franklir. was one of the founders of the RU
when, in the fall of 1 967, Franklin, his wife Jane, and
a few others saw the need for a
Communist revolutionary organization. Franklin said,
"Our idea was to start a local group which would be a
local section of what a party would be if there were a
party."
They encountered people from the Richmond area
who had similar ideas. TTie RU started in California
and became national in 19 70 "when a lot of internal
contradictions became much more extreme,"
according to Franklin.
"The split occurred because," said Franklin,
"there was a contradiction on the question of Third
World leadership. All had the original agreement that
the national liberation struggle would unfold into a
proletarian revolution. We felt that they were
lowering the importance of nationalism and directing
themselves toward white workers.
Principal Contradiction
"Third World people are principal members of the
main contradiction. We don't believe that the
principal contradiction is between the bourgeoisie
and the proletariat under the capitalist system. We

believe that the contradiction is between imperialism
and the oppressed peoples and nations. The white
working class is not in the same position ... there's
no real pressure on the white working class to go
above the economic relationship."
The people of Franklin's viewpoint became more
and more upset that the emphasis within the RU was
being placed on white working class leadership rather
than Third World leadership. The split came because
"it was more and more like two organizations pasted
together," said Franklin.
The nationalizing of the organization hastened the
split. According to Franklin, "Decisions affecting a
small number of people began affecting the whole
revolutionary movement."
The RU had been working with Venceremos
people for a long time. The RU faction favoring Third
World leadership felt that their connection with RU
was inhibiting relations with Venceremos. "There
were a lot of tensions," Franklin said.
Thus the group that split off from the
Revolutionary Union joined Venceremos less than a
month after the split.
Venceremos Splits
There was also a split within the Stanford branch
of Venceremos last summer. According to an article
in the Daily of September 27, "About half of the
Stanford campus contingent. . . left the organization
this summer and re-emerged as an 'intercommunal'
subgroup of the Oakland Black Panther Party." This
group is known as the Intercommunal Survival
Committee (ISC) of the Black Panther Party.
The split was between those people (the ISC) who
wanted to concentrate on community service projects
along the lines of Huey Newton's Black Panthers and
those members who felt that the resistance or
military aspects of the "fight against, imperialism"
were primary.

RIGHT ON—Venceremos Central Committee Chairman Aaron Manginello is seen
here addressing a press conference following Bruce franklins suspension last
February.
One of the manifestations of this split was that
ISC members did not spend time working on behalf
of Bruce Franklin during the suspended professor's
hearing. They felt that there were more important
things to be done, such as fighting to free people on
death row.
Central Committee
Two-thirds of the Venceremos Central Committee
is Chicano. Venceremos is a Democratic Centralist
organization, which means that the members must
follow the instructions of the Central Committee,
which in turn must be responsive to the people who
elect it.
The most important function of the Central
Committee is solving problems, the solutions of
which lie in correct applications of Marxist, Leninist,
and Maoist thought.
The Central Committee's second task is generating
the "correct" political position. At a later time,
Manganiello feels this will take primary importance.
Manganiello explained that he feels Democratic
Centralism is a better system than the most
frequently used alternatives: complete dictatorship or
complete democracy.
Mao, in an essay entitled "On Correcting Mistaken

Ideas in the Party," explains the concept of a Central
Committee further: "(1) The individual is
subordinate to the organization; (2) the minority is
subordinate to the majority; (3) the lower level is
subordinate to the higher level; (4) the entire
membership is subordinate to the Central
Committee."
The Committee's followers implement its decision
immediately and mandatorily. The people have a
form of redress in that they can question and criticize
a directive, but it still must be carried out unless the
Central Committee decides that the criticisms are
valid. Manganiello felt, however, that one of the

RIGHT ON—Venceremos Central Committee Chairman Aaron Manginello is seen
here addressing a press conference following Bruce franklins suspension last
February.
One of the manifestations of this split was that
ISC members did not spend time working on behalf
of Bruce Franklin during the suspended professor's
hearing. They felt that there were more important
things to be done, such as fighting to free people on
death row.
Central Committee
Two-thirds of the Venceremos Central Committee
is Chicano. Venceremos is a Democratic Centralist
organization, which means that the members must
follow the instructions of the Central Committee,
which in turn must be responsive to the people who
elect it.
The most important function of the Central
Committee is solving problems, the solutions of
which lie in correct applications of Marxist, Leninist,
and Maoist thought.
The Central Committee's second task is generating
the "correct" political position. At a later time,
Manganiello feels this will take primary importance.
Manganiello explained that he feels Democratic
Centralism is a better system than the most
frequently used alternatives: complete dictatorship or
complete democracy.
Mao, in an essay entitled "On Correcting Mistaken

Ideas in the Party," explains the concept of a Central
Committee further: "(1) The individual is
subordinate to the organization; (2) the minority is
subordinate to the majority; (3) the lower level is
subordinate to the higher level; (4) the entire
membership is subordinate to the Central
Committee."
The Committee's followers implement its decision
immediately and mandatorily. The people have a
form of redress in that they can question and criticize
a directive, but it still must be carried out unless the
Central Committee decides that the criticisms are
valid. Manganiello felt, however, that one of the
Black Panthers' faults is that one or two people from
above tell everybody what "the line" is.
Unity Principles
There has been some Central Committee turnover.
Six to eight people have come and gone from the
Committee. Manganiello explained that the Central
Committee is not necessarily comprised of the best
leaders. It might be more important to have the best
leaders in one's own geographic area on the
Committee. Each area is represented by at least one
member. All of the Committee members are known
(open), but there are unknown (closed) members in
the organization.

Venceremos has five principles of unity: (1) The
dictatorship of the proletariat; (2) Democratic
Centralism; (3) Liberation of women; (4) The need
for an armed struggle; (5) National liberation and the
right of self-determination.
The Venceremos philosophy is perhaps best
summed up in the phrase "Power to the People."
Members believe that revolution is vital in this
country because, in Lee's words, "In this country,
there is a ruling class who hold power over not only
the people of this country, but also over the people
of the world. Russia is also an imperialist country.
The People's Republic of China is in fact a People's
Republic. We believe that Mao has done a lot to
inform the peoples of the world a great deal about
conducting a revolution.
"Venceremos and the whole revolutionary
movement are growing incredibly rapidly. People are
getting more and more tired of the shit they have to
put up with every day. The people are realizing that
the channels of change held out to them by the ruling
class in this country are a joke, a hoax, a fraud.
They're saying that it's gonna take a revolution to
straighten things out."

Radical-Libertarian Alliance.)
(Editor's Note: This article is the beginning of a series
detailing certain campus organizations: how they
operate, who operates them, who participates in
them, and what they do.
Today's article deals with Venceremos—the
revolutionary organization whose name in Spanish
means "We Will Win!")
Venceremos was formed in the summer of 19 70 as
a Marxist-Leninist revolutionary group. Before that,
most of the Venceremos membership had been in the
Brown Berets, a militant Chicano organization, fairly
inactive now, which operated somewhat along the
lines of the Black Panthers.
Aaron Manganiello, now Chairman of the
Venceremos Central Committee, was one of the
founders of the Brown Berets. Manganiello explained
the split by saying, "We began taking a more Marxist,
multi-nationalist position. The Brown Berets were
lie iming anti-Marxist and anti-Third World. They
threw us out."
Almost all of the Northern California Brown Beret
membership joined Manganiello in the split.
Manganiello said that the Brown Berets were not
"Third World" because "they said they didn't want
anything to do with 'niggers' or even Latins, only
with Mexican-born Americans."
Third World
The term "Third World" began chiefly in the
writings of Franz Fanon, a black author, who used
the term for the underdeveloped countries of the
world—those in Asia, Africa, and America—in a
hook about Third World revolution entitled The
Wretched of the Earth. Manganiello said that "Third
\ rid" as applied inside the United States means
"people of color."
Manganiello said that he could not give the size of
Venceremos' membership for "security reasons," but
rl' I say that Venceremos has grown to one and

one-half times its original size. As of now,
Venceremos is a Bay Area organization with branches
from San Francisco to San Jose.
A segment of Venceremos used to be a part of a
national organization called the Revolutionary Union
(RU). This faction thought that the RU was
becoming "racist" and "revisionist."
According to senior Don Lee, "They didn't want
to struggle. They weren't willing to fight for what
they believed in." There was a split with the RU last
Christmas. At that time, Venceremos was an
all-Chicano organization centered in the Redwood
City area which asked the former RU members to
join.
Local Section
Bruce Franklir. was one of the founders of the RU
when, in the fall of 1 967, Franklin, his wife Jane, and
a few others saw the need for a
Communist revolutionary organization. Franklin said,
"Our idea was to start a local group which would be a
local section of what a party would be if there were a
party."
They encountered people from the Richmond area
who had similar ideas. TTie RU started in California
and became national in 19 70 "when a lot of internal
contradictions became much more extreme,"
according to Franklin.
"The split occurred because," said Franklin,
"there was a contradiction on the question of Third
World leadership. All had the original agreement that
the national liberation struggle would unfold into a
proletarian revolution. We felt that they were
lowering the importance of nationalism and directing
themselves toward white workers.
Principal Contradiction
"Third World people are principal members of the
main contradiction. We don't believe that the
principal contradiction is between the bourgeoisie
and the proletariat under the capitalist system. We

believe that the contradiction is between imperialism
and the oppressed peoples and nations. The white
working class is not in the same position ... there's
no real pressure on the white working class to go
above the economic relationship."
The people of Franklin's viewpoint became more
and more upset that the emphasis within the RU was
being placed on white working class leadership rather
than Third World leadership. The split came because
"it was more and more like two organizations pasted
together," said Franklin.
The nationalizing of the organization hastened the
split. According to Franklin, "Decisions affecting a
small number of people began affecting the whole
revolutionary movement."
The RU had been working with Venceremos
people for a long time. The RU faction favoring Third
World leadership felt that their connection with RU
was inhibiting relations with Venceremos. "There
were a lot of tensions," Franklin said.
Thus the group that split off from the
Revolutionary Union joined Venceremos less than a
month after the split.
Venceremos Splits
There was also a split within the Stanford branch
of Venceremos last summer. According to an article
in the Daily of September 27, "About half of the
Stanford campus contingent. . . left the organization
this summer and re-emerged as an 'intercommunal'

Bruce Franklir. was one of the founders of the RU
when, in the fall of 1 967, Franklin, his wife Jane, and
a few others saw the need for a
Communist revolutionary organization. Franklin said,
"Our idea was to start a local group which would be a
local section of what a party would be if there were a
party."
They encountered people from the Richmond area
who had similar ideas. TTie RU started in California
and became national in 19 70 "when a lot of internal
contradictions became much more extreme,"
according to Franklin.
"The split occurred because," said Franklin,
"there was a contradiction on the question of Third
World leadership. All had the original agreement that
the national liberation struggle would unfold into a
proletarian revolution. We felt that they were
lowering the importance of nationalism and directing
themselves toward white workers.
Principal Contradiction
"Third World people are principal members of the
main contradiction. We don't believe that the
principal contradiction is between the bourgeoisie
and the proletariat under the capitalist system. We

believe that the contradiction is between imperialism
and the oppressed peoples and nations. The white
working class is not in the same position ... there's
no real pressure on the white working class to go
above the economic relationship."
The people of Franklin's viewpoint became more
and more upset that the emphasis within the RU was
being placed on white working class leadership rather
than Third World leadership. The split came because
"it was more and more like two organizations pasted
together," said Franklin.
The nationalizing of the organization hastened the
split. According to Franklin, "Decisions affecting a
small number of people began affecting the whole
revolutionary movement."
The RU had been working with Venceremos
people for a long time. The RU faction favoring Third
World leadership felt that their connection with RU
was inhibiting relations with Venceremos. "There
were a lot of tensions," Franklin said.
Thus the group that split off from the
Revolutionary Union joined Venceremos less than a
month after the split.
Venceremos Splits
There was also a split within the Stanford branch
of Venceremos last summer. According to an article
in the Daily of September 27, "About half of the
Stanford campus contingent. . . left the organization
this summer and re-emerged as an 'intercommunal'
subgroup of the Oakland Black Panther Party." This
group is known as the Intercommunal Survival
Committee (ISC) of the Black Panther Party.
The split was between those people (the ISC) who
wanted to concentrate on community service projects
along the lines of Huey Newton's Black Panthers and
those members who felt that the resistance or
military aspects of the "fight against, imperialism"
were primary.

RIGHT ON—Venceremos Central Committee Chairman Aaron Manginello is seen
here addressing a press conference following Bruce franklins suspension last
February.
One of the manifestations of this split was that
ISC members did not spend time working on behalf
of Bruce Franklin during the suspended professor's
hearing. They felt that there were more important
things to be done, such as fighting to free people on
death row.
Central Committee
Two-thirds of the Venceremos Central Committee
is Chicano. Venceremos is a Democratic Centralist
organization, which means that the members must
follow the instructions of the Central Committee,
which in turn must be responsive to the people who
elect it.
The most important function of the Central
Committee is solving problems, the solutions of
which lie in correct applications of Marxist, Leninist,
and Maoist thought.
The Central Committee's second task is generating
the "correct" political position. At a later time,
Manganiello feels this will take primary importance.
Manganiello explained that he feels Democratic
Centralism is a better system than the most
frequently used alternatives: complete dictatorship or
complete democracy.
Mao, in an essay entitled "On Correcting Mistaken

Ideas in the Party," explains the concept of a Central
Committee further: "(1) The individual is
subordinate to the organization; (2) the minority is
subordinate to the majority; (3) the lower level is
subordinate to the higher level; (4) the entire
membership is subordinate to the Central
Committee."
The Committee's followers implement its decision
immediately and mandatorily. The people have a
form of redress in that they can question and criticize
a directive, but it still must be carried out unless the
Central Committee decides that the criticisms are
valid. Manganiello felt, however, that one of the
Black Panthers' faults is that one or two people from
above tell everybody what "the line" is.
Unity Principles
There has been some Central Committee turnover.
Six to eight people have come and gone from the
Committee. Manganiello explained that the Central
Committee is not necessarily comprised of the best
leaders. It might be more important to have the best
leaders in one's own geographic area on the
Committee. Each area is represented by at least one
member. All of the Committee members are known
(open), but there are unknown (closed) members in
the organization.

Venceremos has five principles of unity: (1) The
dictatorship of the proletariat; (2) Democratic
Centralism; (3) Liberation of women; (4) The need
for an armed struggle; (5) National liberation and the
right of self-determination.
The Venceremos philosophy is perhaps best
summed up in the phrase "Power to the People."
Members believe that revolution is vital in this
country because, in Lee's words, "In this country,
there is a ruling class who hold power over not only
the people of this country, but also over the people
of the world. Russia is also an imperialist country.
The People's Republic of China is in fact a People's
Republic. We believe that Mao has done a lot to
inform the peoples of the world a great deal about
conducting a revolution.
"Venceremos and the whole revolutionary
movement are growing incredibly rapidly. People are
getting more and more tired of the shit they have to
put up with every day. The people are realizing that
the channels of change held out to them by the ruling
class in this country are a joke, a hoax, a fraud.
They're saying that it's gonna take a revolution to
straighten things out."

Radical-Libertarian Alliance.)
(Editor's Note: This article is the beginning of a series
detailing certain campus organizations: how they
operate, who operates them, who participates in
them, and what they do.
Today's article deals with Venceremos—the
revolutionary organization whose name in Spanish
means "We Will Win!")
Venceremos was formed in the summer of 19 70 as
a Marxist-Leninist revolutionary group. Before that,
most of the Venceremos membership had been in the
Brown Berets, a militant Chicano organization, fairly
inactive now, which operated somewhat along the
lines of the Black Panthers.
Aaron Manganiello, now Chairman of the
Venceremos Central Committee, was one of the
founders of the Brown Berets. Manganiello explained
the split by saying, "We began taking a more Marxist,
multi-nationalist position. The Brown Berets were
lie iming anti-Marxist and anti-Third World. They
threw us out."
Almost all of the Northern California Brown Beret
membership joined Manganiello in the split.
Manganiello said that the Brown Berets were not
"Third World" because "they said they didn't want
anything to do with 'niggers' or even Latins, only
with Mexican-born Americans."
Third World
The term "Third World" began chiefly in the
writings of Franz Fanon, a black author, who used
the term for the underdeveloped countries of the
world—those in Asia, Africa, and America—in a
hook about Third World revolution entitled The
Wretched of the Earth. Manganiello said that "Third
\ rid" as applied inside the United States means
"people of color."
Manganiello said that he could not give the size of
Venceremos' membership for "security reasons," but
rl' I say that Venceremos has grown to one and

one-half times its original size. As of now,
Venceremos is a Bay Area organization with branches
from San Francisco to San Jose.
A segment of Venceremos used to be a part of a
national organization called the Revolutionary Union
(RU). This faction thought that the RU was
becoming "racist" and "revisionist."
According to senior Don Lee, "They didn't want
to struggle. They weren't willing to fight for what
they believed in." There was a split with the RU last
Christmas. At that time, Venceremos was an
all-Chicano organization centered in the Redwood
City area which asked the former RU members to
join.
Local Section
Bruce Franklir. was one of the founders of the RU
when, in the fall of 1 967, Franklin, his wife Jane, and
