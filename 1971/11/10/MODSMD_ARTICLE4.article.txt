# Surprise Visit
## Seale Explains Attica Role 
### SCOTT THACHER STEVE WEINER 
Bobby Seale made a surprise
appearance before a crowd of 200
people in Cubberley Auditorium last
night, expressing his tremendous
respect for the courage and sincerity of
the Attica rebels.
Explaining his role in the
negotiations at Attica, the chairman of
the Black Panther Party denounced
"Nixon, Rockefeller, etc." for
"deliberately ignoring" his attempts to
mediate at Attica.
The black leader's remarks were
delivered to a largely favorable
audience originally assembled to hear
Mrs. Georgia Jackson, mother of slain
convict George Jackson- who was
unable to appear due to illness.
According to Seale, the police
attempted to intimidate him and his
Panther delegation from the moment
they arrived at Attica State Prison.
Shotguns were levelled at his car when
he was driving to the scene, he said.
Intense Reaction
Deeply impressed by the intensity of
the prisoners' reactions to his call for
"Power to the People," Seale chided

the radical movement for its ritualistic
clenched-fist behavior at rallies. By way
of contrast, he stated that the Attica
rebels "really meant it."
After his initial mediation efforts, he
flew to California to consult with the
Panther Central Committee. While in
California, he said, he telephoned New
York State Corrections Commissioner
Russell Oswald, telling Oswald of his
determination to return to Attica.
When he got back to New York, he
learned that the prison was already
being stormed.
After his talk on Attica, Seale
turned his attention to defense of the
Panther "survival programs" in the
black community. These programs
include the giving away of groceries and
shoes, as well as free medical care.
Build Consciousness
Seeking to counter left-wing
criticism that these programs are
"reformist" he stated that they serve to
build revolutionary consciousness in
the black community.
He also defended Huey Newton's
residing in a plush Oakland penthouse
saying that the Panthers had decided on
the penthouse location for reasons of

security, in light of the assassinations of
previous black leaders.
He stated, "black people have
criticized black leaders being ripped
off. We put Huey 25 floors up in an
apartment with all those middle-class
white folks, because we know the pigs
aren't going to go messing around in
there. It's security. It's what we need.
That's what black people say."
Discussing his differences of opinion
with other black leaders, Seale
criticized both Eldridge Cleaver and the
ideology of Pan-Africanism. Concerning
Cleaver, he said: "Groups of four or
five leave the party, and one of those
happened to contain the author of
'Soul on Ice.' The power structure of
the press has played up the split."
On Pan-Africanism he said, "We are
not going back to the womb in
Africa .. . this technological society
makes it impossible ... the only
culture you have is a revolutionary
culture."

Preceding Seale on the program was
Phil Ryan, a white attorney for Ruchell
Magee, who attacked what he called the
"contradictions" in the official version
of the events at San Quentin on Aug.
21 when George Jackson was killed.
"It doesn't matter to me," whether
or not Jackson tried to escape, he said,
blasting the conditions in San Quentin's
"Adjustment Center."
Mrs. Inez Williams, mother of
Soledad Brother Fleeta Drumgo,
attacked courtroom procedure in the
Soledad Brothers' trial in San
Francisco, and pleaded with the
audience to go to the courtroom and
lend support.
Seale will appear again at Stanford
November 22 in Memorial Church.

culture you have is a revolutionary
culture."
Ryal Speaks
Preceding Seale on the program was
Phil Ryan, a white attorney for Ruchell
Magee, who attacked what he called the
"contradictions" in the official version
of the events at San Quentin on Aug.
21 when George Jackson was killed.
"It doesn't matter to me," whether
or not Jackson tried to escape, he said,
blasting the conditions in San Quentin's
"Adjustment Center."
Mrs. Inez Williams, mother of
Soledad Brother Fleeta Drumgo,
attacked courtroom procedure in the
Soledad Brothers' trial in San
Francisco, and pleaded with the
audience to go to the courtroom and
lend support.
Seale will appear again at Stanford
November 22 in Memorial Church.
Bobby Seale made a surprise
appearance before a crowd of 200
people in Cubberley Auditorium last
night, expressing his tremendous
respect for the courage and sincerity of
the Attica rebels.
Explaining his role in the
negotiations at Attica, the chairman of
the Black Panther Party denounced
"Nixon, Rockefeller, etc." for
"deliberately ignoring" his attempts to
mediate at Attica.
The black leader's remarks were
delivered to a largely favorable
audience originally assembled to hear
Mrs. Georgia Jackson, mother of slain
convict George Jackson- who was
unable to appear due to illness.
According to Seale, the police
attempted to intimidate him and his
Panther delegation from the moment
they arrived at Attica State Prison.
Shotguns were levelled at his car when
he was driving to the scene, he said.
Intense Reaction
Deeply impressed by the intensity of
the prisoners' reactions to his call for
"Power to the People," Seale chided

the radical movement for its ritualistic
clenched-fist behavior at rallies. By way
of contrast, he stated that the Attica
rebels "really meant it."
After his initial mediation efforts, he
flew to California to consult with the
Panther Central Committee. While in
California, he said, he telephoned New
York State Corrections Commissioner
Russell Oswald, telling Oswald of his
determination to return to Attica.
When he got back to New York, he
learned that the prison was already
being stormed.
After his talk on Attica, Seale
turned his attention to defense of the
Panther "survival programs" in the
black community. These programs
include the giving away of groceries and
shoes, as well as free medical care.
Build Consciousness
Seeking to counter left-wing
criticism that these programs are
"reformist" he stated that they serve to
build revolutionary consciousness in
the black community.
He also defended Huey Newton's
residing in a plush Oakland penthouse
saying that the Panthers had decided on
the penthouse location for reasons of

security, in light of the assassinations of
previous black leaders.
He stated, "black people have
criticized black leaders being ripped
off. We put Huey 25 floors up in an
apartment with all those middle-class
white folks, because we know the pigs
aren't going to go messing around in
there. It's security. It's what we need.
That's what black people say."
Discussing his differences of opinion
with other black leaders, Seale
criticized both Eldridge Cleaver and the
ideology of Pan-Africanism. Concerning
Cleaver, he said: "Groups of four or
five leave the party, and one of those
happened to contain the author of
'Soul on Ice.' The power structure of
the press has played up the split."
On Pan-Africanism he said, "We are
not going back to the womb in
Africa .. . this technological society
makes it impossible ... the only
culture you have is a revolutionary
culture."
