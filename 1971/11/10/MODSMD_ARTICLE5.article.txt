## 'Chilling Effect' 
### 
Justice Robert H. Jackson wrote, "We can afford no liberties with
liberty itself." William H. Rehnquist, who once served as Jackson s
law cleik and now stands nominated for the Supreme Court himself,
has exhibited a general lack of concern with regard to the crucial
balance between individual rights and governmental powers.
Rehnquist, a graduate of Stanford in 1948 and Stanford Law School
in 1952, has repeatedly denied the "chilling effect" that information
gathering, such as wiretaps, has had on individuals' exercising of First
Amendment freedoms.
Denouncing campus rioters as "new barbarians,' Rehnquist
declared that "law and order will be preserved at whatever cost to
individual liberties and rights."
Rehnquist, who as Assistant Attorney General allegedly played a
major role in the illegal arrests of over 7,000 May Day protesters,
clarified his position on governmental surveillance by stating that
. . self-discipline on the part of the Executive branch will provide an
answer to virtually all of the legitimate complaints against excesses of
information gathering
Self-discipline may indeed represent the only check on the
Executive if, as Rehnquist says,"the First Amendment does not
prohibit even foolish or unauthorized information gathering by the
government."
While opposition to Rehnquist's nomination has been retarded by
his relative quality in comparison to the mediocrity of President
Nixon's six primary choices, nevertheless the elevation of Rehnquist
to the Supreme Court will mark the culmination of a dangerous
transition from an assertive Judicial branch to one which may arrogate
too much unchecked power to the Executive wing at the expense of
individual rights and liberties.
With the important Constitutional issues of the death penalty,
abortion, prisoner rights, full Fifth Amendment immunity, and
wiretaps sure to face the court, Rehnquist's appointment will insure
not only the Court endorsing "judicial conservatism" as Nixon has
envisioned, but also a high court which may well retreat from, if not
overturn, bold interpretations of the Miranda, and Brown vs Board of
Education decisions.
Clarence Mitchell, Washington bureau director of the NAACP, has
labeled Rehnquist's nomination as "an insult to Americans who
support civil rights." Rehnquist has allegedly stated, "I'm against all
civil rights laws."
Entrusted with the responsibility of preserving the people's rights
under the Constitution, Rehnquist's philosophy-added to the
majority temperament of the proposed Supreme Court—will not only
fail in establishing confidence in governmental balance but also arrest
whatever progress has been made toward equal justice in America.

his relative quality in comparison to the mediocrity of President
Nixon's six primary choices, nevertheless the elevation of Rehnquist
to the Supreme Court will mark the culmination of a dangerous
transition from an assertive Judicial branch to one which may arrogate
too much unchecked power to the Executive wing at the expense of
individual rights and liberties.
With the important Constitutional issues of the death penalty,
abortion, prisoner rights, full Fifth Amendment immunity, and
wiretaps sure to face the court, Rehnquist's appointment will insure
not only the Court endorsing "judicial conservatism" as Nixon has
envisioned, but also a high court which may well retreat from, if not
overturn, bold interpretations of the Miranda, and Brown vs Board of
Education decisions.
Clarence Mitchell, Washington bureau director of the NAACP, has
labeled Rehnquist's nomination as "an insult to Americans who
support civil rights." Rehnquist has allegedly stated, "I'm against all
civil rights laws."
Entrusted with the responsibility of preserving the people's rights
under the Constitution, Rehnquist's philosophy-added to the
majority temperament of the proposed Supreme Court—will not only
fail in establishing confidence in governmental balance but also arrest
whatever progress has been made toward equal justice in America.
