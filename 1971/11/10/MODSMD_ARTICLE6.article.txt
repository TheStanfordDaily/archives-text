## The 						Crisis Of Sexual Identity 
### 
> Robert g. cohn

Second of Two Parts
There is no doubt why the cosmos came up with
sexuality in the first place: it adds the immediately
proximate aspect of multiplicity (duality) to unity,
suppleness to solidity. This is the dialectical law of
becoming. In an immediately proximate (familiar) way,
the sexual Other negates you to a refinding of your
identity and allows for growth, thriving. Men and
women are mutually dependent in this sense, and their
individual independence is only half of a viable normal
pattern.
The next derivative of this two-in-one formula is the
family which is essentially a male-female polarity crossed
by a parent-child polarity, whereby in an analogous way
a unitary (old) pattern is in time renewed, modified
through a dialectic. This "tetrapolar" scheme (an
important phase of the complex epistemological universe
of "polypolarity") is closely analogous to the patterns
observable in other related fields of being such as the
initial organization of the cells of the embryo into
two-polar and then four-polar clusters; or, lower down in
the overall scheme of things, the similar formation of
crystals. At a level higher than that of the family, the
pattern is found in the organization of the community,
for example in the division into two main parties, left
and right, crossed by the tension between generations
which polarizes each party internally into a left-right of
youth-age. Then there is the division of the ancient city
into four mutually complementary quarters (see John W.
Perry Lord of the Four Quarters).
This cross—referring now to the family version of
it—is not so easily dispensed with: one suspects it will
outlive the Margaret Meads. It is the base from which the
further business of dialectical enrichment proceeds in an
orderly way, i.e. further factors of multiplicity
(suppleness) are brought into the original unity, by
progressive intermarriage of families and groups. Thus,
the species can multiply while maintaining the original
unity or control (family lines, names) all the way
through the process of complication. Thus,
providentially, the degenerative short-circuitry of incest
(which prematurely seeks the old unity) is avoided. The
destructive genes can no longer reinforce each other, at
least for a good long while.
If this multiplication gets out of
hand—overpopulation—the sensible thing to do, like a
sane gardener, is trim around the edges, not hack at the
roots.
But back to the Bems. By now it should be
reasonably apparent why "girls improve their
mathematical performance if problems are reworded in
that they deal with cooking and gardening, even though
the abstract reasoning required for their solution remains
the same" (Milton, 1958, in Bems). Moreover, beyond
this level, it is precisely the concreteness of Being that
prevents them from rising in most cases to that realm of
abstraction where you must fly free, unencumbered by
cooking utensils and garden tools. It is clearly lack of
motivation, but of a deeper sort than the Bems imagine,
that makes the other cases (the few girls really talented
for Math) falter on the edge of this abyss-summit as it
does at the threshold of the dissertation. What really is
in it for them?
We have seen that resources of male and female
component exist in both sexes and can be "brought out"
by manipulation or circumstances. But beneath these
two branching ways of animus and anima lies the even
deeper phenomenon of sexual determination, the
imbalance of one over the other, the infinitely important
"petite difference". It is this which emerges in a crisis
and, through all the layers of superimposed complexity,
asserts itself as a holding back, a sudden loss of impulse
to proceed along a sterile path. This is a total judgment,

a thorough choice, a "fundamental project" to use the
Sartrean phrase. It involves not only the rediscovery of
one's basic sexual determination but also the corollary
fact of the heterosexual self-other relationship. In this
way, one finds one's identity, fulfills oneself, in the
surprisingly specific totality of the world, despite all the
bewildering complexities of modern relativism.
Relativism, like Husserl's phenomenology, is healthy only
as a stage, a method for keeping the mind open
until .. . Until the "certain point" of profound
resolution, when meaning arises. The meaning of
meaning is nothing other than this: the occasional
privileged sense of relationship to the whole Shebang.
Compared to this, of what importance are men's
myths? Since men "run scared", are vulnerable at their

core, their myths reflect this: the characteristic way a
man reassures himself in these so-hard-to-handle realms is
to swagger, to do something about it, very visibly, to
demonstrate his superiority by mental or physical
self-assertion. Accordingly, along with the considerable
substance of approximate truth in the male myths—i.e.
those created by lucid, sensitive and honest men—there
is almost always present a factor of self-propping, bad
faith. Women have usually been willing to go along with
the male view because (a) it largely mirrors truth (b)
they knew secretly that men can hardly help acting in
this way and there is no use trying to talk them down in
this area since their true feminine power is not
diminished thereby, rather the contrary. They simply
and smugly await the inevitable fall, like the girls in
Peanuts or Thurber's recumbent spouses.
The "homogenization" (Bems) of women's roles is,
then, the result not so much of a plot as of the elemental
fact that, by definition, being is less varied than doing.
That is its very source of power: men love most that
which stays; one never tires of feminine grace, just as the
hallmark of enduring art is that self-fidelity, that
"monotony" which makes one Cezanne painting close
kin to another by him; or the serene stillness of a
Vermeer. So Richard Wilbur speaks of beauty's being
"ever the same".
As long as there are male-female relations, men will
prefer that their wives maintain as their central role the
care of the home, the family. Actually, this is
"homogenization" only from one perspective, the
outside view of the social scientist looking over the
spectrum of professions and jobs. Why fixate on this one
perspective? In the total view, a homemaking woman's
life may be less boring and routine than what her
husband is doing at the office or factory. And despite
the grounding in the One and the circumscribed nature
of the home which reflects this Being, the texture of a
woman's personality is highly variable: no two women
are alike any more than two men. Moreover, if we are
talking about personality, rather than jobs, the
"grounding" is an integral part of her "unique identity"
(which the Bems associate with varying talents and

activities); for identity is eventually rooted in the One,
as it is for the most lucid mystics. That is why women
often seem more personable than their mates, e.g. to
Malcolm Cowley (in The Literary Situation). All right,
men can find their identity through doing or creating,
but this shows how arbitrary the "homogenization"
argument is: it involves a begging of the question, i.e.,
that jobs are equally desirable for both sexes/
There have always been exceptional women who have
a stronger male component (animus) and who want to
do something about male swagger (Christine de Pisan,
Queen Christina. . . .) That, I submit, is another form of
all-too-human reaction based on resentment, bad faith.
Even if it is an understandable response to male
fallibility, it has nothing to do with the gist of the
matter. Not that a Simone de Beauvoir doesn't have the
perfect right to be a Doer as she chooses (providing she
is willing to pay the price; a rather terrible one, to judge
from her later writings): the distortion is to make a
universal program of her particular stance, to try to
convince all women that they ought to be like her. This
reminds one of a La Fontaine fable: a fox is trying to
persuade a conclave of animals, with their heads together
in a circle, to cut off their tails; until one of them turns
his head and notices that the ruse renard has lost his
appendage in a trap. ... There is no question that
Simone de Beauvoir is an extremely energetic and quite
gifted person; here I am referring only to her Second Sex
which is a poorly organized and crudely tendentious
book; not just men, but highly qualified women (e.g.
Suzanne Lilar) have judged it so.
One of the causes of the current confusion is that in
historical time many women have become freer, more
transcendent and "individuated". But so have many
men: the basic relationship has not altered. For every
Simone de Beauvoir there is a Jean-Paul Sartre, and a
Malreux and .... This dynamic equilibrium should not
be lost sight of when we hear proposals to change
everything in the professions, impose quotas, and the
like. A charming Russian film (made in 1963) about a
girl who wants to become a Soccer star has fully
confirmed much of what we have been saying here: even
in a society which has stubbornly attempted to "change
all that", neither my wife nor myself could detect any
perceptible difference in the relation between the sexes
portrayed there (that was what the film was about) with
seriousness, obvious honesty, subtle art and appeal.
On the contrary, the relations were really closer to
those of several decades ago in our country: the women
appeared as very feminine, so much so that I am
beginning to wonder if there is not an ironic reversal of
history in the making here! More and more information
coming out of Russia indicates that "plus ca change plus
c'est la meme chose": the return of fashions and
family-patterns, the true qualitative facts about medical
careers (almost all the surgeons are men; the women are
essentially para-medics or nurses). I don't know about
the lady engineers, but obviously a lot depends on what
they are doing. In short, these are grounds for
scepticism. And what we have learned about the Israeli
army makes us even more sceptics.
The codes of modern cultures represente an attempt
to take the primordial violence of male doing (in war,
etc.) as well as female ontic, or natural, power. This is a
noble experiment. But we have learned that the old
forces will out: one of the prices we pay for civilization
(with its discontents) is the outbreak of new forms of
violence and power-play. So there will probably be more
and more shrill voices raised in the latest querelle des
femmes. But nothing fundamental—nothing much
beyond our eardrums—will be affected.

As long as there are male-female relations,
men will prefer that their wives maintain as

Second of Two Parts
There is no doubt why the cosmos came up with
sexuality in the first place: it adds the immediately
proximate aspect of multiplicity (duality) to unity,
suppleness to solidity. This is the dialectical law of
becoming. In an immediately proximate (familiar) way,
the sexual Other negates you to a refinding of your
identity and allows for growth, thriving. Men and
women are mutually dependent in this sense, and their
individual independence is only half of a viable normal
pattern.
The next derivative of this two-in-one formula is the
family which is essentially a male-female polarity crossed
by a parent-child polarity, whereby in an analogous way
a unitary (old) pattern is in time renewed, modified
through a dialectic. This "tetrapolar" scheme (an
important phase of the complex epistemological universe
of "polypolarity") is closely analogous to the patterns
observable in other related fields of being such as the
initial organization of the cells of the embryo into
two-polar and then four-polar clusters; or, lower down in
the overall scheme of things, the similar formation of
crystals. At a level higher than that of the family, the
pattern is found in the organization of the community,
for example in the division into two main parties, left
and right, crossed by the tension between generations
which polarizes each party internally into a left-right of
youth-age. Then there is the division of the ancient city
into four mutually complementary quarters (see John W.
Perry Lord of the Four Quarters).
This cross—referring now to the family version of
it—is not so easily dispensed with: one suspects it will
outlive the Margaret Meads. It is the base from which the
further business of dialectical enrichment proceeds in an
orderly way, i.e. further factors of multiplicity
(suppleness) are brought into the original unity, by
progressive intermarriage of families and groups. Thus,
the species can multiply while maintaining the original
unity or control (family lines, names) all the way
through the process of complication. Thus,
providentially, the degenerative short-circuitry of incest
(which prematurely seeks the old unity) is avoided. The
destructive genes can no longer reinforce each other, at
least for a good long while.
If this multiplication gets out of
hand—overpopulation—the sensible thing to do, like a
sane gardener, is trim around the edges, not hack at the
roots.
But back to the Bems. By now it should be
reasonably apparent why "girls improve their
mathematical performance if problems are reworded in
that they deal with cooking and gardening, even though
the abstract reasoning required for their solution remains
the same" (Milton, 1958, in Bems). Moreover, beyond
this level, it is precisely the concreteness of Being that
prevents them from rising in most cases to that realm of
abstraction where you must fly free, unencumbered by
cooking utensils and garden tools. It is clearly lack of
motivation, but of a deeper sort than the Bems imagine,
that makes the other cases (the few girls really talented
for Math) falter on the edge of this abyss-summit as it
does at the threshold of the dissertation. What really is
in it for them?
We have seen that resources of male and female
component exist in both sexes and can be "brought out"
by manipulation or circumstances. But beneath these
two branching ways of animus and anima lies the even
deeper phenomenon of sexual determination, the
imbalance of one over the other, the infinitely important
"petite difference". It is this which emerges in a crisis
and, through all the layers of superimposed complexity,
asserts itself as a holding back, a sudden loss of impulse
to proceed along a sterile path. This is a total judgment,

a thorough choice, a "fundamental project" to use the
Sartrean phrase. It involves not only the rediscovery of
one's basic sexual determination but also the corollary
fact of the heterosexual self-other relationship. In this
way, one finds one's identity, fulfills oneself, in the
surprisingly specific totality of the world, despite all the
bewildering complexities of modern relativism.
Relativism, like Husserl's phenomenology, is healthy only
as a stage, a method for keeping the mind open
until .. . Until the "certain point" of profound
resolution, when meaning arises. The meaning of
meaning is nothing other than this: the occasional
privileged sense of relationship to the whole Shebang.
Compared to this, of what importance are men's
myths? Since men "run scared", are vulnerable at their

core, their myths reflect this: the characteristic way a
man reassures himself in these so-hard-to-handle realms is
to swagger, to do something about it, very visibly, to
demonstrate his superiority by mental or physical
self-assertion. Accordingly, along with the considerable
substance of approximate truth in the male myths—i.e.
those created by lucid, sensitive and honest men—there
is almost always present a factor of self-propping, bad
faith. Women have usually been willing to go along with
the male view because (a) it largely mirrors truth (b)
they knew secretly that men can hardly help acting in
this way and there is no use trying to talk them down in
this area since their true feminine power is not
diminished thereby, rather the contrary. They simply
and smugly await the inevitable fall, like the girls in
Peanuts or Thurber's recumbent spouses.
The "homogenization" (Bems) of women's roles is,
then, the result not so much of a plot as of the elemental
fact that, by definition, being is less varied than doing.
That is its very source of power: men love most that
which stays; one never tires of feminine grace, just as the
hallmark of enduring art is that self-fidelity, that
"monotony" which makes one Cezanne painting close
kin to another by him; or the serene stillness of a
Vermeer. So Richard Wilbur speaks of beauty's being
"ever the same".
As long as there are male-female relations, men will
prefer that their wives maintain as their central role the
care of the home, the family. Actually, this is
"homogenization" only from one perspective, the
outside view of the social scientist looking over the
spectrum of professions and jobs. Why fixate on this one
perspective? In the total view, a homemaking woman's
life may be less boring and routine than what her
husband is doing at the office or factory. And despite
the grounding in the One and the circumscribed nature
of the home which reflects this Being, the texture of a
woman's personality is highly variable: no two women
are alike any more than two men. Moreover, if we are
talking about personality, rather than jobs, the
"grounding" is an integral part of her "unique identity"
(which the Bems associate with varying talents and

activities); for identity is eventually rooted in the One,
as it is for the most lucid mystics. That is why women
often seem more personable than their mates, e.g. to
Malcolm Cowley (in The Literary Situation). All right,
men can find their identity through doing or creating,
but this shows how arbitrary the "homogenization"
argument is: it involves a begging of the question, i.e.,
that jobs are equally desirable for both sexes/
There have always been exceptional women who have
a stronger male component (animus) and who want to
do something about male swagger (Christine de Pisan,
Queen Christina. . . .) That, I submit, is another form of
all-too-human reaction based on resentment, bad faith.
Even if it is an understandable response to male
fallibility, it has nothing to do with the gist of the
matter. Not that a Simone de Beauvoir doesn't have the
perfect right to be a Doer as she chooses (providing she
is willing to pay the price; a rather terrible one, to judge
from her later writings): the distortion is to make a
universal program of her particular stance, to try to
convince all women that they ought to be like her. This
reminds one of a La Fontaine fable: a fox is trying to
persuade a conclave of animals, with their heads together
in a circle, to cut off their tails; until one of them turns
his head and notices that the ruse renard has lost his
appendage in a trap. ... There is no question that
Simone de Beauvoir is an extremely energetic and quite
gifted person; here I am referring only to her Second Sex
which is a poorly organized and crudely tendentious
book; not just men, but highly qualified women (e.g.
Suzanne Lilar) have judged it so.
One of the causes of the current confusion is that in
historical time many women have become freer, more
transcendent and "individuated". But so have many
men: the basic relationship has not altered. For every
Simone de Beauvoir there is a Jean-Paul Sartre, and a
Malreux and .... This dynamic equilibrium should not
be lost sight of when we hear proposals to change
everything in the professions, impose quotas, and the
like. A charming Russian film (made in 1963) about a
girl who wants to become a Soccer star has fully
confirmed much of what we have been saying here: even
in a society which has stubbornly attempted to "change
all that", neither my wife nor myself could detect any
perceptible difference in the relation between the sexes
portrayed there (that was what the film was about) with
seriousness, obvious honesty, subtle art and appeal.
On the contrary, the relations were really closer to
those of several decades ago in our country: the women
appeared as very feminine, so much so that I am
beginning to wonder if there is not an ironic reversal of
history in the making here! More and more information
coming out of Russia indicates that "plus ca change plus
c'est la meme chose": the return of fashions and
family-patterns, the true qualitative facts about medical
careers (almost all the surgeons are men; the women are
essentially para-medics or nurses). I don't know about
the lady engineers, but obviously a lot depends on what
they are doing. In short, these are grounds for
scepticism. And what we have learned about the Israeli
army makes us even more sceptics.
The codes of modern cultures represente an attempt
to take the primordial violence of male doing (in war,
etc.) as well as female ontic, or natural, power. This is a
noble experiment. But we have learned that the old
forces will out: one of the prices we pay for civilization
(with its discontents) is the outbreak of new forms of
violence and power-play. So there will probably be more
and more shrill voices raised in the latest querelle des
femmes. But nothing fundamental—nothing much
beyond our eardrums—will be affected.

army makes us even more sceptics.
The codes of modern cultures represente an attempt
to take the primordial violence of male doing (in war,

noble experiment. But we have learned that the old
forces will out: one of the prices we pay for civilization
(with its discontents) is the outbreak of new forms of
violence and power-play. So there will probably be more
and more shrill voices raised in the latest querelle des
femmes. But nothing fundamental—nothing much
beyond our eardrums—will be affected.

As long as there are male-female relations,
men will prefer that their wives maintain as

fixate on this one perspective? In the total

Second of Two Parts
There is no doubt why the cosmos came up with
sexuality in the first place: it adds the immediately
proximate aspect of multiplicity (duality) to unity,
suppleness to solidity. This is the dialectical law of
becoming. In an immediately proximate (familiar) way,
the sexual Other negates you to a refinding of your
identity and allows for growth, thriving. Men and
women are mutually dependent in this sense, and their
individual independence is only half of a viable normal
pattern.
The next derivative of this two-in-one formula is the
family which is essentially a male-female polarity crossed
by a parent-child polarity, whereby in an analogous way
a unitary (old) pattern is in time renewed, modified
through a dialectic. This "tetrapolar" scheme (an
important phase of the complex epistemological universe
of "polypolarity") is closely analogous to the patterns
observable in other related fields of being such as the
initial organization of the cells of the embryo into
two-polar and then four-polar clusters; or, lower down in
the overall scheme of things, the similar formation of
crystals. At a level higher than that of the family, the
pattern is found in the organization of the community,
for example in the division into two main parties, left
and right, crossed by the tension between generations
which polarizes each party internally into a left-right of
youth-age. Then there is the division of the ancient city
into four mutually complementary quarters (see John W.
Perry Lord of the Four Quarters).
This cross—referring now to the family version of
it—is not so easily dispensed with: one suspects it will
outlive the Margaret Meads. It is the base from which the
further business of dialectical enrichment proceeds in an
orderly way, i.e. further factors of multiplicity
(suppleness) are brought into the original unity, by
progressive intermarriage of families and groups. Thus,
the species can multiply while maintaining the original
unity or control (family lines, names) all the way
through the process of complication. Thus,
providentially, the degenerative short-circuitry of incest
(which prematurely seeks the old unity) is avoided. The
destructive genes can no longer reinforce each other, at
least for a good long while.
If this multiplication gets out of
hand—overpopulation—the sensible thing to do, like a
sane gardener, is trim around the edges, not hack at the
roots.
But back to the Bems. By now it should be
reasonably apparent why "girls improve their
mathematical performance if problems are reworded in
that they deal with cooking and gardening, even though
the abstract reasoning required for their solution remains
the same" (Milton, 1958, in Bems). Moreover, beyond
this level, it is precisely the concreteness of Being that
prevents them from rising in most cases to that realm of
abstraction where you must fly free, unencumbered by
cooking utensils and garden tools. It is clearly lack of
motivation, but of a deeper sort than the Bems imagine,
that makes the other cases (the few girls really talented
for Math) falter on the edge of this abyss-summit as it
does at the threshold of the dissertation. What really is
in it for them?
We have seen that resources of male and female
component exist in both sexes and can be "brought out"
by manipulation or circumstances. But beneath these
two branching ways of animus and anima lies the even
deeper phenomenon of sexual determination, the
imbalance of one over the other, the infinitely important
"petite difference". It is this which emerges in a crisis
and, through all the layers of superimposed complexity,
asserts itself as a holding back, a sudden loss of impulse
to proceed along a sterile path. This is a total judgment,

a thorough choice, a "fundamental project" to use the
Sartrean phrase. It involves not only the rediscovery of
one's basic sexual determination but also the corollary
fact of the heterosexual self-other relationship. In this
way, one finds one's identity, fulfills oneself, in the
surprisingly specific totality of the world, despite all the
bewildering complexities of modern relativism.
Relativism, like Husserl's phenomenology, is healthy only
as a stage, a method for keeping the mind open
until .. . Until the "certain point" of profound
resolution, when meaning arises. The meaning of
meaning is nothing other than this: the occasional
privileged sense of relationship to the whole Shebang.
Compared to this, of what importance are men's
myths? Since men "run scared", are vulnerable at their

core, their myths reflect this: the characteristic way a
man reassures himself in these so-hard-to-handle realms is
to swagger, to do something about it, very visibly, to
demonstrate his superiority by mental or physical
self-assertion. Accordingly, along with the considerable
substance of approximate truth in the male myths—i.e.
those created by lucid, sensitive and honest men—there
is almost always present a factor of self-propping, bad
faith. Women have usually been willing to go along with
the male view because (a) it largely mirrors truth (b)
they knew secretly that men can hardly help acting in
this way and there is no use trying to talk them down in
this area since their true feminine power is not
diminished thereby, rather the contrary. They simply
and smugly await the inevitable fall, like the girls in
Peanuts or Thurber's recumbent spouses.
The "homogenization" (Bems) of women's roles is,
then, the result not so much of a plot as of the elemental
fact that, by definition, being is less varied than doing.
That is its very source of power: men love most that
which stays; one never tires of feminine grace, just as the
hallmark of enduring art is that self-fidelity, that
"monotony" which makes one Cezanne painting close
kin to another by him; or the serene stillness of a
Vermeer. So Richard Wilbur speaks of beauty's being
"ever the same".
As long as there are male-female relations, men will
prefer that their wives maintain as their central role the
care of the home, the family. Actually, this is
"homogenization" only from one perspective, the
outside view of the social scientist looking over the
spectrum of professions and jobs. Why fixate on this one
perspective? In the total view, a homemaking woman's
life may be less boring and routine than what her
husband is doing at the office or factory. And despite
the grounding in the One and the circumscribed nature
of the home which reflects this Being, the texture of a
woman's personality is highly variable: no two women
are alike any more than two men. Moreover, if we are
talking about personality, rather than jobs, the
"grounding" is an integral part of her "unique identity"
(which the Bems associate with varying talents and

activities); for identity is eventually rooted in the One,
as it is for the most lucid mystics. That is why women
often seem more personable than their mates, e.g. to
Malcolm Cowley (in The Literary Situation). All right,
men can find their identity through doing or creating,
but this shows how arbitrary the "homogenization"
argument is: it involves a begging of the question, i.e.,
that jobs are equally desirable for both sexes/
There have always been exceptional women who have
a stronger male component (animus) and who want to
do something about male swagger (Christine de Pisan,
Queen Christina. . . .) That, I submit, is another form of
all-too-human reaction based on resentment, bad faith.
Even if it is an understandable response to male
fallibility, it has nothing to do with the gist of the
matter. Not that a Simone de Beauvoir doesn't have the
perfect right to be a Doer as she chooses (providing she
is willing to pay the price; a rather terrible one, to judge
from her later writings): the distortion is to make a
universal program of her particular stance, to try to
convince all women that they ought to be like her. This
reminds one of a La Fontaine fable: a fox is trying to
persuade a conclave of animals, with their heads together
in a circle, to cut off their tails; until one of them turns
his head and notices that the ruse renard has lost his
appendage in a trap. ... There is no question that
Simone de Beauvoir is an extremely energetic and quite
gifted person; here I am referring only to her Second Sex
which is a poorly organized and crudely tendentious
book; not just men, but highly qualified women (e.g.
Suzanne Lilar) have judged it so.
One of the causes of the current confusion is that in
historical time many women have become freer, more
transcendent and "individuated". But so have many
men: the basic relationship has not altered. For every
Simone de Beauvoir there is a Jean-Paul Sartre, and a
Malreux and .... This dynamic equilibrium should not
be lost sight of when we hear proposals to change
everything in the professions, impose quotas, and the
like. A charming Russian film (made in 1963) about a
girl who wants to become a Soccer star has fully
confirmed much of what we have been saying here: even
in a society which has stubbornly attempted to "change
all that", neither my wife nor myself could detect any
perceptible difference in the relation between the sexes
portrayed there (that was what the film was about) with
seriousness, obvious honesty, subtle art and appeal.
On the contrary, the relations were really closer to
those of several decades ago in our country: the women
appeared as very feminine, so much so that I am
beginning to wonder if there is not an ironic reversal of
history in the making here! More and more information
coming out of Russia indicates that "plus ca change plus
c'est la meme chose": the return of fashions and
family-patterns, the true qualitative facts about medical
careers (almost all the surgeons are men; the women are
essentially para-medics or nurses). I don't know about
the lady engineers, but obviously a lot depends on what
they are doing. In short, these are grounds for
scepticism. And what we have learned about the Israeli
army makes us even more sceptics.

appeared as very feminine, so much so that I am
beginning to wonder if there is not an ironic reversal of
history in the making here! More and more information
coming out of Russia indicates that "plus ca change plus
c'est la meme chose": the return of fashions and
family-patterns, the true qualitative facts about medical
careers (almost all the surgeons are men; the women are
essentially para-medics or nurses). I don't know about
the lady engineers, but obviously a lot depends on what
they are doing. In short, these are grounds for
scepticism. And what we have learned about the Israeli
army makes us even more sceptics.
The codes of modern cultures represente an attempt
to take the primordial violence of male doing (in war,
etc.) as well as female ontic, or natural, power. This is a
noble experiment. But we have learned that the old
forces will out: one of the prices we pay for civilization
(with its discontents) is the outbreak of new forms of
violence and power-play. So there will probably be more
and more shrill voices raised in the latest querelle des
femmes. But nothing fundamental—nothing much
beyond our eardrums—will be affected.

As long as there are male-female relations,
men will prefer that their wives maintain as
their central role the care of the home, the
family. Actually, this is "homogenization"
only from one perspective, the outside view
of the social scientist looking over the
spectrum of professions and jobs. Why
fixate on this one perspective? In the total

Second of Two Parts
There is no doubt why the cosmos came up with
sexuality in the first place: it adds the immediately
proximate aspect of multiplicity (duality) to unity,
suppleness to solidity. This is the dialectical law of
becoming. In an immediately proximate (familiar) way,
the sexual Other negates you to a refinding of your
identity and allows for growth, thriving. Men and
women are mutually dependent in this sense, and their
individual independence is only half of a viable normal
pattern.
The next derivative of this two-in-one formula is the
family which is essentially a male-female polarity crossed
by a parent-child polarity, whereby in an analogous way
a unitary (old) pattern is in time renewed, modified
through a dialectic. This "tetrapolar" scheme (an
important phase of the complex epistemological universe
of "polypolarity") is closely analogous to the patterns
observable in other related fields of being such as the
initial organization of the cells of the embryo into
two-polar and then four-polar clusters; or, lower down in
the overall scheme of things, the similar formation of
crystals. At a level higher than that of the family, the
pattern is found in the organization of the community,
for example in the division into two main parties, left
and right, crossed by the tension between generations
which polarizes each party internally into a left-right of
youth-age. Then there is the division of the ancient city
into four mutually complementary quarters (see John W.
Perry Lord of the Four Quarters).
This cross—referring now to the family version of
it—is not so easily dispensed with: one suspects it will
outlive the Margaret Meads. It is the base from which the
further business of dialectical enrichment proceeds in an
orderly way, i.e. further factors of multiplicity
(suppleness) are brought into the original unity, by
progressive intermarriage of families and groups. Thus,
the species can multiply while maintaining the original
unity or control (family lines, names) all the way
through the process of complication. Thus,
providentially, the degenerative short-circuitry of incest
(which prematurely seeks the old unity) is avoided. The
destructive genes can no longer reinforce each other, at
least for a good long while.
If this multiplication gets out of
hand—overpopulation—the sensible thing to do, like a
sane gardener, is trim around the edges, not hack at the
roots.
But back to the Bems. By now it should be
reasonably apparent why "girls improve their
mathematical performance if problems are reworded in
that they deal with cooking and gardening, even though
the abstract reasoning required for their solution remains
the same" (Milton, 1958, in Bems). Moreover, beyond
this level, it is precisely the concreteness of Being that
prevents them from rising in most cases to that realm of
abstraction where you must fly free, unencumbered by
cooking utensils and garden tools. It is clearly lack of
motivation, but of a deeper sort than the Bems imagine,
that makes the other cases (the few girls really talented
for Math) falter on the edge of this abyss-summit as it
does at the threshold of the dissertation. What really is
in it for them?
We have seen that resources of male and female
component exist in both sexes and can be "brought out"
by manipulation or circumstances. But beneath these
two branching ways of animus and anima lies the even
deeper phenomenon of sexual determination, the
imbalance of one over the other, the infinitely important
"petite difference". It is this which emerges in a crisis
and, through all the layers of superimposed complexity,
asserts itself as a holding back, a sudden loss of impulse
to proceed along a sterile path. This is a total judgment,

a thorough choice, a "fundamental project" to use the
Sartrean phrase. It involves not only the rediscovery of
one's basic sexual determination but also the corollary
fact of the heterosexual self-other relationship. In this
way, one finds one's identity, fulfills oneself, in the
surprisingly specific totality of the world, despite all the
bewildering complexities of modern relativism.
Relativism, like Husserl's phenomenology, is healthy only
as a stage, a method for keeping the mind open
until .. . Until the "certain point" of profound
resolution, when meaning arises. The meaning of
meaning is nothing other than this: the occasional
privileged sense of relationship to the whole Shebang.
Compared to this, of what importance are men's
myths? Since men "run scared", are vulnerable at their

core, their myths reflect this: the characteristic way a
man reassures himself in these so-hard-to-handle realms is
to swagger, to do something about it, very visibly, to
demonstrate his superiority by mental or physical
self-assertion. Accordingly, along with the considerable
substance of approximate truth in the male myths—i.e.
those created by lucid, sensitive and honest men—there
is almost always present a factor of self-propping, bad
faith. Women have usually been willing to go along with
the male view because (a) it largely mirrors truth (b)
they knew secretly that men can hardly help acting in
this way and there is no use trying to talk them down in
this area since their true feminine power is not
diminished thereby, rather the contrary. They simply
and smugly await the inevitable fall, like the girls in
Peanuts or Thurber's recumbent spouses.
The "homogenization" (Bems) of women's roles is,
then, the result not so much of a plot as of the elemental
fact that, by definition, being is less varied than doing.
That is its very source of power: men love most that
which stays; one never tires of feminine grace, just as the
hallmark of enduring art is that self-fidelity, that
"monotony" which makes one Cezanne painting close
kin to another by him; or the serene stillness of a
Vermeer. So Richard Wilbur speaks of beauty's being
"ever the same".
As long as there are male-female relations, men will
prefer that their wives maintain as their central role the
care of the home, the family. Actually, this is
"homogenization" only from one perspective, the
outside view of the social scientist looking over the
spectrum of professions and jobs. Why fixate on this one
perspective? In the total view, a homemaking woman's
life may be less boring and routine than what her
husband is doing at the office or factory. And despite
the grounding in the One and the circumscribed nature
of the home which reflects this Being, the texture of a
woman's personality is highly variable: no two women
are alike any more than two men. Moreover, if we are
talking about personality, rather than jobs, the
"grounding" is an integral part of her "unique identity"
(which the Bems associate with varying talents and

activities); for identity is eventually rooted in the One,
as it is for the most lucid mystics. That is why women
often seem more personable than their mates, e.g. to
Malcolm Cowley (in The Literary Situation). All right,
men can find their identity through doing or creating,
but this shows how arbitrary the "homogenization"
argument is: it involves a begging of the question, i.e.,
that jobs are equally desirable for both sexes/
There have always been exceptional women who have
a stronger male component (animus) and who want to
do something about male swagger (Christine de Pisan,
Queen Christina. . . .) That, I submit, is another form of
all-too-human reaction based on resentment, bad faith.
Even if it is an understandable response to male
fallibility, it has nothing to do with the gist of the
matter. Not that a Simone de Beauvoir doesn't have the
perfect right to be a Doer as she chooses (providing she
is willing to pay the price; a rather terrible one, to judge
from her later writings): the distortion is to make a
universal program of her particular stance, to try to
convince all women that they ought to be like her. This
reminds one of a La Fontaine fable: a fox is trying to
persuade a conclave of animals, with their heads together
in a circle, to cut off their tails; until one of them turns
his head and notices that the ruse renard has lost his
appendage in a trap. ... There is no question that
Simone de Beauvoir is an extremely energetic and quite
gifted person; here I am referring only to her Second Sex
which is a poorly organized and crudely tendentious
book; not just men, but highly qualified women (e.g.
Suzanne Lilar) have judged it so.
One of the causes of the current confusion is that in
historical time many women have become freer, more
transcendent and "individuated". But so have many
men: the basic relationship has not altered. For every
Simone de Beauvoir there is a Jean-Paul Sartre, and a
Malreux and .... This dynamic equilibrium should not
be lost sight of when we hear proposals to change
everything in the professions, impose quotas, and the
like. A charming Russian film (made in 1963) about a
girl who wants to become a Soccer star has fully
confirmed much of what we have been saying here: even
in a society which has stubbornly attempted to "change
all that", neither my wife nor myself could detect any
perceptible difference in the relation between the sexes
portrayed there (that was what the film was about) with
seriousness, obvious honesty, subtle art and appeal.
On the contrary, the relations were really closer to

everything in the professions, impose quotas, and the
like. A charming Russian film (made in 1963) about a
girl who wants to become a Soccer star has fully
confirmed much of what we have been saying here: even
in a society which has stubbornly attempted to "change
all that", neither my wife nor myself could detect any
perceptible difference in the relation between the sexes
portrayed there (that was what the film was about) with
seriousness, obvious honesty, subtle art and appeal.
On the contrary, the relations were really closer to
those of several decades ago in our country: the women
appeared as very feminine, so much so that I am
beginning to wonder if there is not an ironic reversal of
history in the making here! More and more information
coming out of Russia indicates that "plus ca change plus
c'est la meme chose": the return of fashions and
family-patterns, the true qualitative facts about medical
careers (almost all the surgeons are men; the women are
essentially para-medics or nurses). I don't know about
the lady engineers, but obviously a lot depends on what
they are doing. In short, these are grounds for
scepticism. And what we have learned about the Israeli
army makes us even more sceptics.

(with its discontents) is the outbreak of new forms of
violence and power-play. So there will probably be more
and more shrill voices raised in the latest querelle des

beyond our eardrums—will be affected.

As long as there are male-female relations,
men will prefer that their wives maintain as

spectrum of professions and jobs. Why
fixate on this one perspective? In the total

Second of Two Parts
There is no doubt why the cosmos came up with
sexuality in the first place: it adds the immediately
proximate aspect of multiplicity (duality) to unity,
suppleness to solidity. This is the dialectical law of
becoming. In an immediately proximate (familiar) way,
the sexual Other negates you to a refinding of your
identity and allows for growth, thriving. Men and
women are mutually dependent in this sense, and their
individual independence is only half of a viable normal
pattern.
The next derivative of this two-in-one formula is the
family which is essentially a male-female polarity crossed
by a parent-child polarity, whereby in an analogous way
a unitary (old) pattern is in time renewed, modified
through a dialectic. This "tetrapolar" scheme (an
important phase of the complex epistemological universe
of "polypolarity") is closely analogous to the patterns
observable in other related fields of being such as the
initial organization of the cells of the embryo into
two-polar and then four-polar clusters; or, lower down in
the overall scheme of things, the similar formation of
crystals. At a level higher than that of the family, the
pattern is found in the organization of the community,
for example in the division into two main parties, left
and right, crossed by the tension between generations
which polarizes each party internally into a left-right of
youth-age. Then there is the division of the ancient city
into four mutually complementary quarters (see John W.
Perry Lord of the Four Quarters).
This cross—referring now to the family version of
it—is not so easily dispensed with: one suspects it will
outlive the Margaret Meads. It is the base from which the
further business of dialectical enrichment proceeds in an
orderly way, i.e. further factors of multiplicity
(suppleness) are brought into the original unity, by
progressive intermarriage of families and groups. Thus,
the species can multiply while maintaining the original
unity or control (family lines, names) all the way
through the process of complication. Thus,
providentially, the degenerative short-circuitry of incest
(which prematurely seeks the old unity) is avoided. The
destructive genes can no longer reinforce each other, at
least for a good long while.
If this multiplication gets out of
hand—overpopulation—the sensible thing to do, like a
sane gardener, is trim around the edges, not hack at the
roots.
But back to the Bems. By now it should be
reasonably apparent why "girls improve their
mathematical performance if problems are reworded in
that they deal with cooking and gardening, even though
the abstract reasoning required for their solution remains
the same" (Milton, 1958, in Bems). Moreover, beyond
this level, it is precisely the concreteness of Being that
prevents them from rising in most cases to that realm of
abstraction where you must fly free, unencumbered by
cooking utensils and garden tools. It is clearly lack of
motivation, but of a deeper sort than the Bems imagine,
that makes the other cases (the few girls really talented
for Math) falter on the edge of this abyss-summit as it
does at the threshold of the dissertation. What really is
in it for them?
We have seen that resources of male and female
component exist in both sexes and can be "brought out"
by manipulation or circumstances. But beneath these
two branching ways of animus and anima lies the even
deeper phenomenon of sexual determination, the
imbalance of one over the other, the infinitely important
"petite difference". It is this which emerges in a crisis
and, through all the layers of superimposed complexity,
asserts itself as a holding back, a sudden loss of impulse
to proceed along a sterile path. This is a total judgment,

a thorough choice, a "fundamental project" to use the
Sartrean phrase. It involves not only the rediscovery of
one's basic sexual determination but also the corollary
fact of the heterosexual self-other relationship. In this
way, one finds one's identity, fulfills oneself, in the
surprisingly specific totality of the world, despite all the
bewildering complexities of modern relativism.
Relativism, like Husserl's phenomenology, is healthy only
as a stage, a method for keeping the mind open
until .. . Until the "certain point" of profound
resolution, when meaning arises. The meaning of
meaning is nothing other than this: the occasional
privileged sense of relationship to the whole Shebang.
Compared to this, of what importance are men's
myths? Since men "run scared", are vulnerable at their

core, their myths reflect this: the characteristic way a
man reassures himself in these so-hard-to-handle realms is
to swagger, to do something about it, very visibly, to
demonstrate his superiority by mental or physical
self-assertion. Accordingly, along with the considerable
substance of approximate truth in the male myths—i.e.
those created by lucid, sensitive and honest men—there
is almost always present a factor of self-propping, bad
faith. Women have usually been willing to go along with
the male view because (a) it largely mirrors truth (b)
they knew secretly that men can hardly help acting in
this way and there is no use trying to talk them down in
this area since their true feminine power is not
diminished thereby, rather the contrary. They simply
and smugly await the inevitable fall, like the girls in
Peanuts or Thurber's recumbent spouses.
The "homogenization" (Bems) of women's roles is,
then, the result not so much of a plot as of the elemental
fact that, by definition, being is less varied than doing.
That is its very source of power: men love most that
which stays; one never tires of feminine grace, just as the
hallmark of enduring art is that self-fidelity, that
"monotony" which makes one Cezanne painting close
kin to another by him; or the serene stillness of a
Vermeer. So Richard Wilbur speaks of beauty's being
"ever the same".
As long as there are male-female relations, men will
prefer that their wives maintain as their central role the
care of the home, the family. Actually, this is
"homogenization" only from one perspective, the
outside view of the social scientist looking over the
spectrum of professions and jobs. Why fixate on this one
perspective? In the total view, a homemaking woman's
life may be less boring and routine than what her
husband is doing at the office or factory. And despite
the grounding in the One and the circumscribed nature
of the home which reflects this Being, the texture of a
woman's personality is highly variable: no two women
are alike any more than two men. Moreover, if we are
talking about personality, rather than jobs, the
"grounding" is an integral part of her "unique identity"
(which the Bems associate with varying talents and

activities); for identity is eventually rooted in the One,
as it is for the most lucid mystics. That is why women
often seem more personable than their mates, e.g. to
Malcolm Cowley (in The Literary Situation). All right,
men can find their identity through doing or creating,
but this shows how arbitrary the "homogenization"
argument is: it involves a begging of the question, i.e.,
that jobs are equally desirable for both sexes/
There have always been exceptional women who have
a stronger male component (animus) and who want to
do something about male swagger (Christine de Pisan,
Queen Christina. . . .) That, I submit, is another form of
all-too-human reaction based on resentment, bad faith.
Even if it is an understandable response to male
fallibility, it has nothing to do with the gist of the
matter. Not that a Simone de Beauvoir doesn't have the
perfect right to be a Doer as she chooses (providing she
is willing to pay the price; a rather terrible one, to judge
from her later writings): the distortion is to make a
universal program of her particular stance, to try to
convince all women that they ought to be like her. This
reminds one of a La Fontaine fable: a fox is trying to
persuade a conclave of animals, with their heads together
in a circle, to cut off their tails; until one of them turns
his head and notices that the ruse renard has lost his
appendage in a trap. ... There is no question that
Simone de Beauvoir is an extremely energetic and quite
gifted person; here I am referring only to her Second Sex
which is a poorly organized and crudely tendentious
book; not just men, but highly qualified women (e.g.
Suzanne Lilar) have judged it so.
One of the causes of the current confusion is that in
historical time many women have become freer, more
transcendent and "individuated". But so have many
men: the basic relationship has not altered. For every
Simone de Beauvoir there is a Jean-Paul Sartre, and a
Malreux and .... This dynamic equilibrium should not
