Dear Dick,
One month has passed since I
publicly announced my candidacy
for the Deanship of Engineering at
Stanford. To this date I have
received no personal, or even
general notification of procedures
that will assure that my name will
be listed on the election ballot.
While it would be too hasty to
jump to conclusions about the
reasons for this lack of response, I
am, to say the least, disappointed.
Please notify me, as soon as

possible, what the election
procedures will be.
I must apologize for this
inconvenience, but I am a very
busy man. I do not have the time
to go through my usual channels
of urging friends to steal
inter-office memos.
sincerely not yours,
Lenny Siegel

Dear Prof. Bryson,
I object to your comments
about our SWOPSI report, DOD
Sponsored Research at Stanford,
Volume I, made in a November
letter to the Daily. Every principal
investigator with work described
in Volume I was given an

opportunity to review our
descriptions of his work before it
was included. Most made
suggestions which we
incorporated; a few held views we
could not support, so we invited
them to write a statement which
we included in Volume I
verbatim. Neither you nor Prof.
Karamcheti exercised this option.
While we were unable to obtain
Defense Documentation Center
statements for you and Prof.
Karamchet's contracts because the
Army Air Mobility Research and
Development Laboratory funds
them through NASA, we stand
behind our assessment of the
military implications. Unlike the
Young Crows, our report did not
ignore civilian applications of
your work (even though they
were not explicitly mentioned in

the contracts); we would
appreciate it if you not ignore the
military ones.
Sincerely,
Stanton A. Glantz,
Workshop Leader
More Creative Strategy
What will it take to convince
those hassling the Placement
Center, that rather than effect
corporate policy one iota, they
simply prevent students from
getting jobs? When the market for
labor is such that companies can
take it or leave it, turning away
their recruiters should not be
expected to effectively intimidate
them.
Best wishes for developing a
more creative strategy.

Dear Prof. Bryson,
I object to your comments
about our SWOPSI report, DOD
Sponsored Research at Stanford,
Volume I, made in a November
letter to the Daily. Every principal
investigator with work described
in Volume I was given an

opportunity to review our
descriptions of his work before it
was included. Most made
suggestions which we
incorporated; a few held views we
could not support, so we invited
them to write a statement which
we included in Volume I
verbatim. Neither you nor Prof.
Karamcheti exercised this option.
While we were unable to obtain
Defense Documentation Center
statements for you and Prof.
Karamchet's contracts because the
Army Air Mobility Research and
Development Laboratory funds
them through NASA, we stand
behind our assessment of the
military implications. Unlike the
Young Crows, our report did not
ignore civilian applications of
your work (even though they
were not explicitly mentioned in

the contracts); we would
appreciate it if you not ignore the
military ones.
Sincerely,
Stanton A. Glantz,
Workshop Leader
More Creative Strategy
What will it take to convince
those hassling the Placement
Center, that rather than effect
corporate policy one iota, they
simply prevent students from
getting jobs? When the market for
labor is such that companies can
take it or leave it, turning away
their recruiters should not be
expected to effectively intimidate
them.
Best wishes for developing a
more creative strategy.
