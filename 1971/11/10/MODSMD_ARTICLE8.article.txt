# 'Fiddler On Roofâ€™: Weak Film Version
## 
### TODD MCCARTHY 
The film version of "Fiddler on the Roof" is a major
disappointment, but then that was to be expected. "Funny Girl" and
"Sweet Charity" emerged decently and occasionally excitingly on
screen, but generally, the adaptation of major Broadway musicals to
wide-screen movie spectacles has meant artistic and, increasingly,
financial disaster.
It seems doubtful that "Fiddler" will suffer at the box-office, for it
has a substantial built-in audience, but even the pre-sold audience I
saw it with was a little weary by the time the third hour rolled
around.
At the moment, the stage version of "Fiddler on the Roof" holds
the long-run record for Broadway musicals. In the middle of next
year, the production will become the longest running show of any
kind of all time and, judging from recent advertisements and
continued healthy business, it intends to make it.
Solid Material
The material on which the musical is based, the storeis of Sholom
Aleichem, is certainly solid, as are the music and lyrics of Jerry Bock
and Sheldon Harnick. The part of Tevye is, of course, any actor's
dream and it is difficult to imagine anyone not doing well by it. The
Chagalesque stylized settings were vital to the show, as the rural
village couldn't afford to appear too dirty and desparate.
Even more importantly, it was a dancing show. Everyone went out
talking about the bottle dance and wondering if the dancers were able
to pull it off every night. Even if all this failed to grab you, there was
the stunning curtain call, with the entire company trucking across a
turn-table with dizzying speed.
The problem of a screen version must have been intimidating and,
as usual, was met with all the money and scope Hollywood could
muster. The film was shot in Yugoslavia and while my original
premonition was that the increased realism of location shooting would
result in such preposterous goings on as dancing in the mud and
singing in the slums, what has happened is that the town appears more
prosperous and cheerful than anyone had a right to expect.
We even hear the strains of Isaac Stern's violin blazing out across
the rooftops at the opening of the film. Despite the money poured
into the project, "Fiddler" doesn't look as expensive and
overproduced as most of the reserved-seat musicals which preceded it.
The problems lie elsewhere.
Uneasy Combination
Norman Jewison, darling director of the mid-sixties for such
overrated films as "The Russians Are Coming" and "In the Heat of
the Night," has patched together a visual style for this film which
looks Hke an uneasy combination of the foggy filters of "McCabe and
Mrs. Miller," the horizontal scope of "Ryan's Daughter" and the
affected earthiness of "Camelot."
Again following the lead of the scandalous Joshua Logan's
"Camelot," Jewison shoots the majority of "Fiddler" in tight
close-up, undoubtedly with the intent of bringing us on to more
intimate terms with the characters. A very few directors (notably
Francois Truffaut) have pulled off successful intimate stories in
wide-screen, but Jewison has no idea how to compose his frames in
Panavision, the result being that the simple, unassuming characters
don't so much come closer as loom far larger in a visual sense than
they could ever presume to do as characters.
Another result of Jewison's wide-screen close-ups with a short lens
is that the film is very rarely in focus, as the center of the screen at
least is always slightly blurred. A brownish filter also seems to have
been used throughout, which grates curiously during the opening
section of the film which takes place in the sunny summer. Most of
the larger, outdoor musical numbers occur earlier on and the
dampening filter renders even "Tradition" relatively joyless.
Gradually, the seasons change and by the time the somber ending
transpires in the dead of winter, the emotional tone of the
proceedings seems finally, and rather coincidentally, to have matched
the visual tone previously established by the murky filter.
By far the most crippling debit of "Fiddler on the Roof" is that
Jewison has absolutely no idea how to stage musical numbers. Like
the rest of the film, vocal solos are shot in close-up, with an occasional
cumbersome visual metaphor to suggest lyricism, and the ensemble
dances are framed so tightly that you can hardly see the dancing for
the movement. Even in the bottle dance, the feet and often legs of the
dancers are rarely visible.
Surprisingly in a film this dependant on its humanity and
universality for its effect, none of the actors registers with much
impact. Tevye seems relatively better integrated emotionally with the
action in the film than on stage and Topol, an Israeli actor who played
the role in London, restrains himself from delivering each song and
philosophical soliloquy in a show-stopping manner suitable to stage
bi't not screen. Like the film, both his theatrics and emotions seem
somewhat muted. Like almost all other film musicals of the sixties
and now seventies, the film not only gives little indication of what
made the project a success on the boards, but is unsatisfying (and
exhausting) as a purely cinematic experience as well.
