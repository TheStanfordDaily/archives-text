# The 						Beat Goes On At Winterland
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Last summer when the two Fillmores
closed down, Bill Graham released a long
list of reasons why he was closing his rock
palaces and cited such factors as the rising
prices demanded by groups, the inferior
quality of many groups and the
unappreciative and unknowledgeable
nature of much of rock music's present
audience.
Many people thought that rock music
had seen the end of Graham, at least
temporarily. But as most people know, he
has not stopped producing shows in the
Bay Area and is in fact putting on nearly
the same number of shows as before,
primarily at San Francisco's Winterland
Arena, but also at the Berkeley
Community Theater and the San Francisco
Civic Auditorium.
The heir apparent to Fillmore West as
the major San Francisco rock showplace is
Winterland. The hall which has housed
many boxing matches and Ice Follies
performances had been used sporadically
for big shows when Fillmore was still in
operation.
But after an incident at a Grateful Dead
concert last spring, in which numerous
audience members tripped out after
drinking some acid-spiked beverage which
had been passed around, the San Francisco
Police Department tried to take away
Graham's permit to use Winterland.
Personal Appearance
Graham worked out his problems with
the police, adhered to the fire department's
wishes for clear aisles and stairways and so
the beat goes on at Winterland. Last
Saturday, Graham made a personal

appearance during one of the better recent
bills at the arena to announce some future
shows.
To have three out of four groups
perform well is fairly impressive, but it's
too bad when the headliner is the weak
link. Such was the case last Saturday.
Wet Willie is a hard country-rock group
out of Macon, Georgia who opened the
night with a fairly good set. They have a
sound which is something like a
combination of the Allman Brothers
(another Macon group whose lead singer
Duane was tragically killed a. few weeks
ago) and the J. Geils band out of Boston.
They weren't at all bad for a fourth group.
Lamb used to be a poor ac oustic group
which I had heard a couple of times in
Frost Ampitheater and which I didn't
really want to hear again. But fortunately,
the group has undergone a very big
transformation.
Good Vocals
They've added some personnel, gone
electric, and they come off as a fine local
group. They move around from some nice,
mellow songs to some good fast rock and
the vocal range of lead singer Barbara
Mauritz is very good.
Next, an unaccompanied black man
came on stage and proceeded to keep a
packed house completely attentive for a
very lengthy set. Taj Mahal, a master of
country blues, moved through his whole
range of blues in a most extraordinary
performance.
Late in his set, Taj made a comment
about Tina Turner which merits quotation.
He said, "When Tina Turner sings, the
words come out of her body." I don't want

to be accused of subtle plagarism, but
when Taj Mahal sings, the words are all
over his face.
If you aren't close enough to see his
face, you miss a lot of the experience of
really hearing Taj. His singing alone, both
recorded and live, is outstanding. But when
combined with seeing his face, it's a
remarkable experience.
Simple Things
Taj sings about simple things like fishing
and food and watching people walk by in a
way that provides more insight into life
than many of the so-called "social
comment" songs. When he sings songs like
"Ain't Nobody's Business," "Going
Fishing," "Good Morning Miss Brown,"
and "Dust My Broom," it is hard to
describe how much he gets out of the
words.
And his guitar playing isn't often
matched. He moves from clear chords to
amazingly quick runs to really funky blues
riffs in a single song. When you put the
music and the singing and the facial
emotion together, you have a single man
hard to equal.
When a person can come out for an
encore and get a whole crowd up and
moving and shaking and chanting "Shake
'em on down," by using just his voice
without any instruments, you've got an
incredible performer. Taj Mahal fills the
description completely.
The crowd went predictably crazy over
his set and in retrospect, the show could've
ended with this highpoint. But Van
Morrison was still ahead. Unfortunately,
this Irish singer who has recorded some
fine albums and singles, fell far short of his

potefitial.
Talented Saxophonist
Morrison has an excellent back-up band.
Most of the other musicians performed
well on Saturday night. His saxophonist is
very talented on a number of different
saxes and he duplicated his recorded
performances with a couple of very good
solos.
The pianist did some good honky-tonk
material and he combined with the bass
player on some strong passages. Even the
drummer did a short, talented solo which
was a refreshing change from the old
traditional and tedious three or four
minute routine.
But Morrison didn't come through. He
did a decent job on a couple of songs, but
then he slipped into some instrumental
passages which weren't bad, but which
aren't the showplace for his real talent.
Morrison can sing a number of different
types of music very well and it's too bad
that he decided to just get by on Saturday.
After
hearing Aretha fall short of her vast
potential on Friday, it was another
letdown to watch Morrison be satisfied
with mostly easy-going music which
exhibited very little of his great vocal
ability. It was a bad end to an otherwise
strong show.
Graham continues to line up some big
shows at Winterland. Ten Years After, Big
Brother and The Holding Company, Buddy
Miles, J. Geils and Sha-Na-Na are all lined
up for this month. Winterland will never
achieve the mystique or atmosphere of
Fillmore. But I'd much rather have it than
face only the big arena roadshows.

the group has undergone a very big
transformation.
Good Vocals
They've added some personnel, gone
electric, and they come off as a fine local
group. They move around from some nice,
mellow songs to some good fast rock and
the vocal range of lead singer Barbara
Mauritz is very good.
Next, an unaccompanied black man
came on stage and proceeded to keep a
packed house completely attentive for a
very lengthy set. Taj Mahal, a master of
country blues, moved through his whole
range of blues in a most extraordinary
performance.
Late in his set, Taj made a comment
about Tina Turner which merits quotation.
He said, "When Tina Turner sings, the
words come out of her body." I don't want

to be accused of subtle plagarism, but
when Taj Mahal sings, the words are all
over his face.
If you aren't close enough to see his
face, you miss a lot of the experience of
really hearing Taj. His singing alone, both
recorded and live, is outstanding. But when
combined with seeing his face, it's a
remarkable experience.
Simple Things
Taj sings about simple things like fishing
and food and watching people walk by in a
way that provides more insight into life
than many of the so-called "social
comment" songs. When he sings songs like
"Ain't Nobody's Business," "Going
Fishing," "Good Morning Miss Brown,"
and "Dust My Broom," it is hard to
describe how much he gets out of the
words.
And his guitar playing isn't often
matched. He moves from clear chords to
amazingly quick runs to really funky blues
riffs in a single song. When you put the
music and the singing and the facial
emotion together, you have a single man
hard to equal.
When a person can come out for an
encore and get a whole crowd up and
moving and shaking and chanting "Shake
'em on down," by using just his voice
without any instruments, you've got an
incredible performer. Taj Mahal fills the
description completely.
The crowd went predictably crazy over
his set and in retrospect, the show could've
ended with this highpoint. But Van
Morrison was still ahead. Unfortunately,
this Irish singer who has recorded some
fine albums and singles, fell far short of his

potefitial.
Talented Saxophonist
Morrison has an excellent back-up band.
Most of the other musicians performed
well on Saturday night. His saxophonist is
very talented on a number of different
saxes and he duplicated his recorded
performances with a couple of very good
solos.
The pianist did some good honky-tonk
material and he combined with the bass
player on some strong passages. Even the
drummer did a short, talented solo which
was a refreshing change from the old
traditional and tedious three or four
minute routine.
But Morrison didn't come through. He
did a decent job on a couple of songs, but
then he slipped into some instrumental
passages which weren't bad, but which
aren't the showplace for his real talent.
Morrison can sing a number of different
types of music very well and it's too bad
that he decided to just get by on Saturday.
After
hearing Aretha fall short of her vast
potential on Friday, it was another
letdown to watch Morrison be satisfied
with mostly easy-going music which
exhibited very little of his great vocal
ability. It was a bad end to an otherwise
strong show.
Graham continues to line up some big
shows at Winterland. Ten Years After, Big
Brother and The Holding Company, Buddy
Miles, J. Geils and Sha-Na-Na are all lined
up for this month. Winterland will never
achieve the mystique or atmosphere of
Fillmore. But I'd much rather have it than
face only the big arena roadshows.
Last summer when the two Fillmores
closed down, Bill Graham released a long
list of reasons why he was closing his rock
palaces and cited such factors as the rising
prices demanded by groups, the inferior
quality of many groups and the
unappreciative and unknowledgeable
nature of much of rock music's present
audience.
Many people thought that rock music
had seen the end of Graham, at least
temporarily. But as most people know, he
has not stopped producing shows in the
Bay Area and is in fact putting on nearly
the same number of shows as before,
primarily at San Francisco's Winterland
Arena, but also at the Berkeley
Community Theater and the San Francisco
Civic Auditorium.
The heir apparent to Fillmore West as
the major San Francisco rock showplace is
Winterland. The hall which has housed
many boxing matches and Ice Follies
performances had been used sporadically
for big shows when Fillmore was still in
operation.
But after an incident at a Grateful Dead
concert last spring, in which numerous
audience members tripped out after
drinking some acid-spiked beverage which
had been passed around, the San Francisco
Police Department tried to take away
Graham's permit to use Winterland.
Personal Appearance
Graham worked out his problems with
the police, adhered to the fire department's
wishes for clear aisles and stairways and so
the beat goes on at Winterland. Last
Saturday, Graham made a personal

appearance during one of the better recent
bills at the arena to announce some future
shows.
To have three out of four groups
perform well is fairly impressive, but it's
too bad when the headliner is the weak
link. Such was the case last Saturday.
Wet Willie is a hard country-rock group
out of Macon, Georgia who opened the
night with a fairly good set. They have a
sound which is something like a
combination of the Allman Brothers
(another Macon group whose lead singer
Duane was tragically killed a. few weeks
ago) and the J. Geils band out of Boston.
They weren't at all bad for a fourth group.
Lamb used to be a poor ac oustic group
which I had heard a couple of times in
Frost Ampitheater and which I didn't
really want to hear again. But fortunately,
the group has undergone a very big
transformation.
Good Vocals

fine albums and singles, fell far short of his

potefitial.
Talented Saxophonist
Morrison has an excellent back-up band.
Most of the other musicians performed
well on Saturday night. His saxophonist is
very talented on a number of different
saxes and he duplicated his recorded
performances with a couple of very good
solos.
The pianist did some good honky-tonk
material and he combined with the bass
player on some strong passages. Even the
drummer did a short, talented solo which
was a refreshing change from the old
traditional and tedious three or four
minute routine.
But Morrison didn't come through. He
did a decent job on a couple of songs, but
then he slipped into some instrumental
passages which weren't bad, but which
aren't the showplace for his real talent.
Morrison can sing a number of different
types of music very well and it's too bad
that he decided to just get by on Saturday.
After
hearing Aretha fall short of her vast
potential on Friday, it was another
letdown to watch Morrison be satisfied
with mostly easy-going music which
exhibited very little of his great vocal
ability. It was a bad end to an otherwise
strong show.
Graham continues to line up some big
shows at Winterland. Ten Years After, Big
Brother and The Holding Company, Buddy
Miles, J. Geils and Sha-Na-Na are all lined
up for this month. Winterland will never
achieve the mystique or atmosphere of
Fillmore. But I'd much rather have it than
face only the big arena roadshows.
Last summer when the two Fillmores
closed down, Bill Graham released a long
list of reasons why he was closing his rock
palaces and cited such factors as the rising
prices demanded by groups, the inferior
quality of many groups and the
unappreciative and unknowledgeable
nature of much of rock music's present
audience.
Many people thought that rock music
had seen the end of Graham, at least
temporarily. But as most people know, he
has not stopped producing shows in the
Bay Area and is in fact putting on nearly
the same number of shows as before,
primarily at San Francisco's Winterland
Arena, but also at the Berkeley
Community Theater and the San Francisco
Civic Auditorium.
The heir apparent to Fillmore West as
the major San Francisco rock showplace is
Winterland. The hall which has housed
many boxing matches and Ice Follies
performances had been used sporadically
for big shows when Fillmore was still in
operation.
But after an incident at a Grateful Dead
concert last spring, in which numerous
audience members tripped out after
drinking some acid-spiked beverage which
had been passed around, the San Francisco
Police Department tried to take away
Graham's permit to use Winterland.
Personal Appearance
Graham worked out his problems with
the police, adhered to the fire department's
wishes for clear aisles and stairways and so
the beat goes on at Winterland. Last
Saturday, Graham made a personal

appearance during one of the better recent
bills at the arena to announce some future
shows.
To have three out of four groups
perform well is fairly impressive, but it's
too bad when the headliner is the weak
link. Such was the case last Saturday.
Wet Willie is a hard country-rock group
out of Macon, Georgia who opened the
night with a fairly good set. They have a
sound which is something like a
combination of the Allman Brothers
(another Macon group whose lead singer
Duane was tragically killed a. few weeks
ago) and the J. Geils band out of Boston.
They weren't at all bad for a fourth group.
Lamb used to be a poor ac oustic group
which I had heard a couple of times in
Frost Ampitheater and which I didn't
really want to hear again. But fortunately,
the group has undergone a very big
transformation.
Good Vocals
They've added some personnel, gone
electric, and they come off as a fine local
group. They move around from some nice,
mellow songs to some good fast rock and
the vocal range of lead singer Barbara
Mauritz is very good.
Next, an unaccompanied black man
came on stage and proceeded to keep a
packed house completely attentive for a
very lengthy set. Taj Mahal, a master of
country blues, moved through his whole
range of blues in a most extraordinary
performance.
Late in his set, Taj made a comment
about Tina Turner which merits quotation.
He said, "When Tina Turner sings, the
words come out of her body." I don't want

to be accused of subtle plagarism, but
when Taj Mahal sings, the words are all
over his face.
If you aren't close enough to see his
face, you miss a lot of the experience of
really hearing Taj. His singing alone, both
recorded and live, is outstanding. But when
combined with seeing his face, it's a
remarkable experience.
Simple Things
Taj sings about simple things like fishing
and food and watching people walk by in a
way that provides more insight into life
than many of the so-called "social
comment" songs. When he sings songs like
"Ain't Nobody's Business," "Going
Fishing," "Good Morning Miss Brown,"
and "Dust My Broom," it is hard to
describe how much he gets out of the
words.
And his guitar playing isn't often
matched. He moves from clear chords to
amazingly quick runs to really funky blues
riffs in a single song. When you put the
music and the singing and the facial
emotion together, you have a single man
hard to equal.
When a person can come out for an
encore and get a whole crowd up and
moving and shaking and chanting "Shake
'em on down," by using just his voice
without any instruments, you've got an
incredible performer. Taj Mahal fills the
description completely.
The crowd went predictably crazy over
his set and in retrospect, the show could've
ended with this highpoint. But Van
Morrison was still ahead. Unfortunately,
this Irish singer who has recorded some
fine albums and singles, fell far short of his

potefitial.
