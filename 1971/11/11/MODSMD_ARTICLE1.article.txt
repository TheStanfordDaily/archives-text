# Survey Shows High Readership, Varying Complaints Against Daily
## 
### 
More than three out of four
members of the Stanford Community
read the Stanford Daily on any given
day, according to a recent survey.
The survey claims, on the basis of
335 returned questionnaires, that "on
any given day 75 percent of the
students, 75 percent of the staff, and
78 percent of the faculty will read the
Daily." Based on a student population
of 12,500 and a faculty staff of over
7,000, the daily readership would reach
around 15,000.
A part of a SWOPSI course studying
the possible independence of the
newspaper and financed by the Dean of
Students Office, the eight page
questionnaire asked students, faculty,
and staff about their readership habits
of newspapers, and their opinions of
the Daily.
The report claims that students,
faculty and staff all feel the Daily is the
most important source of campus news,
although Campus Report and the
Stanford Observer are also important
sources for faculty and staff.
According to Frank Miller, author of
the survey and news editor of the
Daily, "Students generally felt the
Daily was reliable in its news coverage,
staff generally agreed, but faculty were
extremely critical of the newspaper's
reliability—sl percent felt it was below
average."
In a comparison with the reliability
of other publications, Campus Report
was given the best reliability rating
(although there was a large percentage
of people who felt they didn't know)
and the San Francisco Chronicle and
Palo Alto Times were given very poor
reliability ratings.
The survey revealed that although

the Stanford community reads the
newspaper often, few people would be
willing to buy it if it were for sale at 10
cents per issue.
According to Miller, "Only about 8
percent of the students, 24 percent of
the faculty and 21 percent of the staff
indicated that they would be willing to
buy the paper regularly. And,
furthermore, about half of those
surveyed said they would never buy the
Daily if it were for sale." (The Daily is
currently distributed free on campus
although students pay $4 per year
added on to their tuition bill for the
newspaper.)
Miller termed the low number of
those willing to buy the newspaper
"discouraging" to those within the
Stanford community who wish the
paper to go to individual subscriptions.
Readers were critical of the Daily's
news coverage last year in most areas
except political coverage. Students gave
the overall news coverage a "fair to
good rating" and faculty gave the
newspaper an "adequate to poor
rating."
Everyone was very critical of the
quality and quantity of the news
coverage of faculty affairs, staff affairs,
science and research news and graduate
student news. In each instance, about
one-half of those surveyed felt the
Daily should run more on each of these
subjects.
According to the survey, most
people read the front page news and
over 60 percent of the students and
staff read the Associated Press News
Summary "frequently or always,"
making it the most popular feature of
the newspaper.
The opinion section was read

principally by faculty and staff with
about two-thirds of the faculty reading
it at least frequently compared to
about one-third of the students. The
sports and entertainment sections were
read principally by students.
Miller notes that "most faculty
members read only the news sections
and the opinion page while students
and staff skip around. I was surprised
that the readership of the
entertainment and sports sections
weren't higher but when the survey was
conducted (spring 1971) these sections
were only being printed sporadically
due to space restrictions caused by a
bleak financial situation."
Staff and faculty were extremely
critical of the "objectivity" of the
Daily with 65 percent feeling that
objectivity was "poor or very poor."
Students were not quite as critical
although over 4 0 percent felt the

LOYAL READERS—A recent survey showed that 15,000 people in the Stanford community read the Daily—among them
these two typical devotees. What keeps their interest at such a peak? Well, read on, read on.
