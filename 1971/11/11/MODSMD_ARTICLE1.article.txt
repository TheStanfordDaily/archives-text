# Survey Shows High Readership, Varying Complaints Against Daily
## 
### 
More than three out of four
members of the Stanford Community
read the Stanford Daily on any given
day, according to a recent survey.
The survey claims, on the basis of
335 returned questionnaires, that "on
any given day 75 percent of the
students, 75 percent of the staff, and
78 percent of the faculty will read the
Daily." Based on a student population
of 12,500 and a faculty staff of over
7,000, the daily readership would reach
around 15,000.
A part of a SWOPSI course studying
the possible independence of the
newspaper and financed by the Dean of
Students Office, the eight page
questionnaire asked students, faculty,
and staff about their readership habits
of newspapers, and their opinions of
the Daily.
The report claims that students,
faculty and staff all feel the Daily is the
most important source of campus news,
although Campus Report and the
Stanford Observer are also important
sources for faculty and staff.
According to Frank Miller, author of
the survey and news editor of the
Daily, "Students generally felt the
Daily was reliable in its news coverage,
staff generally agreed, but faculty were
extremely critical of the newspaper's
reliability—sl percent felt it was below
average."
In a comparison with the reliability
of other publications, Campus Report
was given the best reliability rating
(although there was a large percentage
of people who felt they didn't know)
and the San Francisco Chronicle and
Palo Alto Times were given very poor
reliability ratings.
The survey revealed that although

the Stanford community reads the
newspaper often, few people would be
willing to buy it if it were for sale at 10
cents per issue.
According to Miller, "Only about 8
percent of the students, 24 percent of
the faculty and 21 percent of the staff
indicated that they would be willing to
buy the paper regularly. And,
furthermore, about half of those
surveyed said they would never buy the
Daily if it were for sale." (The Daily is
currently distributed free on campus
although students pay $4 per year
added on to their tuition bill for the
newspaper.)
Miller termed the low number of
those willing to buy the newspaper
"discouraging" to those within the
Stanford community who wish the
paper to go to individual subscriptions.
Readers were critical of the Daily's
news coverage last year in most areas
except political coverage. Students gave
the overall news coverage a "fair to
good rating" and faculty gave the
newspaper an "adequate to poor
rating."
Everyone was very critical of the
quality and quantity of the news
coverage of faculty affairs, staff affairs,
science and research news and graduate
student news. In each instance, about
one-half of those surveyed felt the
Daily should run more on each of these
subjects.
According to the survey, most
people read the front page news and
over 60 percent of the students and
staff read the Associated Press News
Summary "frequently or always,"
making it the most popular feature of
the newspaper.
The opinion section was read

principally by faculty and staff with
about two-thirds of the faculty reading
it at least frequently compared to
about one-third of the students. The
sports and entertainment sections were
read principally by students.
Miller notes that "most faculty
members read only the news sections
and the opinion page while students
and staff skip around. I was surprised
that the readership of the
entertainment and sports sections
weren't higher but when the survey was
conducted (spring 1971) these sections
were only being printed sporadically
due to space restrictions caused by a
bleak financial situation."
Staff and faculty were extremely
critical of the "objectivity" of the
Daily with 65 percent feeling that
objectivity was "poor or very poor."
Students were not quite as critical
although over 4 0 percent felt the

Daily's objectivity was less than
adequate.
About 65 percent of the Stanford
community rated the Daily's
"timeliness" good or excellent although
most feel the Daily's "fairness" is only
adequate.
Individual sections of the newspaper
came under criticism, especially the
opinion section. Miller says that "there
can be little doubt that people were
critical" of the opinion section. "Fully
80 percent of those questioned felt the
Daily's opinion section was biased
either extremely or slightly to the
political left," the report notes.
"People disliked what they generally
felt was a bias in favor of the left and
the granting of too much space to
radical elements," Miller said.
"Last year's entertainment section
was rated adequate to good by most
groups but virtually everyone,
especially students, expressed a desire
to see the section expanded," the
report says.
Although the sports section was
rated adequate by most, many felt "it
lacked excitement and hence interest,"
Miller noted.
Everyone surveyed felt the Daily
was oriented toward students,
especially undergraduates, but there
was a tremendous disagreement about
its direction.
Miller said he expected everyone to
feel the newspaper should aim itself to
an audience of students, faculty and
staff but "a substantial portion of the
students and faculty feel the Daily
should be oriented toward students and
only about one-third of the students
feel the paper should be oriented
toward faculty, staff, and students."
People were critical in open-ended
questions on the Daily's political bias in
reporting, poor writing, inaccuracies,
too many ads, and the small size of the
paper.
Miller noted that although only
about one-half of those questionnaires
sent out were returned, he felt the

sample was "representative of most
views about the Daily."
The Daily was praised for its
community services such as Once
Around the Quad, its general news
coverage on campus, its Associated
Press News Summary, and its
timeliness.
Many of those surveyed also praised
the newspaper for its consistent
publication, conciseness, entertainment
section, open forum on the opinion
page, and informational value.
Fred Mann, editor of the Daily, said
he was "pleased" with the high

readership of the Daily and felt the
criticisms of the newspaper were
usually valid. "We are taking the results
of the survey very seriously," he said,
"and are trying to respond better to the
wishes of our readers."
He noted that this quarter, in
response to the survey, the
entertainment section and the AP news
summary have been expanded, the
proportion of advertising in the
newspaper has been reduced, and the
average size of the newspaper has
increased nearly two pages from last
year.

political left," the report notes.
"People disliked what they generally
felt was a bias in favor of the left and
the granting of too much space to
radical elements," Miller said.
"Last year's entertainment section
was rated adequate to good by most
groups but virtually everyone,
especially students, expressed a desire
to see the section expanded," the
report says.
Although the sports section was
rated adequate by most, many felt "it
lacked excitement and hence interest,"
Miller noted.
Everyone surveyed felt the Daily
was oriented toward students,
especially undergraduates, but there
was a tremendous disagreement about
its direction.
Miller said he expected everyone to
feel the newspaper should aim itself to
an audience of students, faculty and
staff but "a substantial portion of the
students and faculty feel the Daily
should be oriented toward students and
only about one-third of the students
feel the paper should be oriented
toward faculty, staff, and students."
People were critical in open-ended
questions on the Daily's political bias in
reporting, poor writing, inaccuracies,
too many ads, and the small size of the
paper.
Miller noted that although only
about one-half of those questionnaires
sent out were returned, he felt the

sample was "representative of most
views about the Daily."
The Daily was praised for its
community services such as Once
Around the Quad, its general news
coverage on campus, its Associated
Press News Summary, and its
timeliness.
Many of those surveyed also praised
the newspaper for its consistent
publication, conciseness, entertainment
section, open forum on the opinion
page, and informational value.
Fred Mann, editor of the Daily, said
he was "pleased" with the high

readership of the Daily and felt the
criticisms of the newspaper were
usually valid. "We are taking the results
of the survey very seriously," he said,
"and are trying to respond better to the
wishes of our readers."
He noted that this quarter, in
response to the survey, the
entertainment section and the AP news
summary have been expanded, the
proportion of advertising in the
newspaper has been reduced, and the
average size of the newspaper has
increased nearly two pages from last
year.
More than three out of four
members of the Stanford Community
read the Stanford Daily on any given
day, according to a recent survey.
The survey claims, on the basis of
335 returned questionnaires, that "on
any given day 75 percent of the
students, 75 percent of the staff, and
78 percent of the faculty will read the
Daily." Based on a student population
of 12,500 and a faculty staff of over
7,000, the daily readership would reach
around 15,000.
A part of a SWOPSI course studying
the possible independence of the
newspaper and financed by the Dean of
Students Office, the eight page
questionnaire asked students, faculty,
and staff about their readership habits
of newspapers, and their opinions of
the Daily.
The report claims that students,
faculty and staff all feel the Daily is the
most important source of campus news,
although Campus Report and the
Stanford Observer are also important
sources for faculty and staff.
According to Frank Miller, author of
the survey and news editor of the
Daily, "Students generally felt the
Daily was reliable in its news coverage,
staff generally agreed, but faculty were
extremely critical of the newspaper's
reliability—sl percent felt it was below
average."
In a comparison with the reliability
of other publications, Campus Report
was given the best reliability rating
(although there was a large percentage
of people who felt they didn't know)
and the San Francisco Chronicle and
Palo Alto Times were given very poor
reliability ratings.
The survey revealed that although

the Stanford community reads the
newspaper often, few people would be
willing to buy it if it were for sale at 10
cents per issue.
According to Miller, "Only about 8
percent of the students, 24 percent of
the faculty and 21 percent of the staff
indicated that they would be willing to
buy the paper regularly. And,
furthermore, about half of those
surveyed said they would never buy the
Daily if it were for sale." (The Daily is
currently distributed free on campus
although students pay $4 per year
added on to their tuition bill for the
newspaper.)
Miller termed the low number of
those willing to buy the newspaper
"discouraging" to those within the
Stanford community who wish the
paper to go to individual subscriptions.
Readers were critical of the Daily's
news coverage last year in most areas
except political coverage. Students gave
the overall news coverage a "fair to
good rating" and faculty gave the
newspaper an "adequate to poor
rating."
Everyone was very critical of the
quality and quantity of the news
coverage of faculty affairs, staff affairs,
science and research news and graduate
student news. In each instance, about
one-half of those surveyed felt the
Daily should run more on each of these
subjects.
According to the survey, most
people read the front page news and
over 60 percent of the students and
staff read the Associated Press News
Summary "frequently or always,"
making it the most popular feature of
the newspaper.
The opinion section was read

principally by faculty and staff with
about two-thirds of the faculty reading
it at least frequently compared to
about one-third of the students. The
sports and entertainment sections were
read principally by students.
Miller notes that "most faculty
members read only the news sections
and the opinion page while students
and staff skip around. I was surprised
that the readership of the
entertainment and sports sections
weren't higher but when the survey was
conducted (spring 1971) these sections
were only being printed sporadically
due to space restrictions caused by a
bleak financial situation."
Staff and faculty were extremely
critical of the "objectivity" of the
Daily with 65 percent feeling that
objectivity was "poor or very poor."
Students were not quite as critical
although over 4 0 percent felt the

Daily's objectivity was less than
adequate.
About 65 percent of the Stanford
community rated the Daily's
"timeliness" good or excellent although
most feel the Daily's "fairness" is only
adequate.
Individual sections of the newspaper
came under criticism, especially the
opinion section. Miller says that "there
can be little doubt that people were
critical" of the opinion section. "Fully
80 percent of those questioned felt the
Daily's opinion section was biased
either extremely or slightly to the
political left," the report notes.
"People disliked what they generally
felt was a bias in favor of the left and

newspaper an "adequate to poor
rating."
Everyone was very critical of the
quality and quantity of the news
coverage of faculty affairs, staff affairs,
science and research news and graduate
student news. In each instance, about
one-half of those surveyed felt the
Daily should run more on each of these
subjects.
According to the survey, most
people read the front page news and
over 60 percent of the students and
staff read the Associated Press News
Summary "frequently or always,"
making it the most popular feature of
the newspaper.
The opinion section was read

principally by faculty and staff with
about two-thirds of the faculty reading
it at least frequently compared to
about one-third of the students. The
sports and entertainment sections were
read principally by students.
Miller notes that "most faculty
members read only the news sections
and the opinion page while students
and staff skip around. I was surprised
that the readership of the
entertainment and sports sections
weren't higher but when the survey was
conducted (spring 1971) these sections
were only being printed sporadically
due to space restrictions caused by a
bleak financial situation."
Staff and faculty were extremely
critical of the "objectivity" of the
Daily with 65 percent feeling that
objectivity was "poor or very poor."
Students were not quite as critical
although over 4 0 percent felt the

Daily's objectivity was less than
adequate.
About 65 percent of the Stanford
community rated the Daily's
"timeliness" good or excellent although
most feel the Daily's "fairness" is only
adequate.
Individual sections of the newspaper
came under criticism, especially the
opinion section. Miller says that "there
can be little doubt that people were
critical" of the opinion section. "Fully
80 percent of those questioned felt the
Daily's opinion section was biased
either extremely or slightly to the
political left," the report notes.
"People disliked what they generally
felt was a bias in favor of the left and
the granting of too much space to
radical elements," Miller said.
"Last year's entertainment section
was rated adequate to good by most
groups but virtually everyone,
especially students, expressed a desire
to see the section expanded," the
report says.
Although the sports section was
rated adequate by most, many felt "it
lacked excitement and hence interest,"
Miller noted.
Everyone surveyed felt the Daily
was oriented toward students,
especially undergraduates, but there
was a tremendous disagreement about
its direction.
Miller said he expected everyone to
feel the newspaper should aim itself to
an audience of students, faculty and
staff but "a substantial portion of the
students and faculty feel the Daily
should be oriented toward students and
only about one-third of the students
feel the paper should be oriented
toward faculty, staff, and students."
People were critical in open-ended
questions on the Daily's political bias in
reporting, poor writing, inaccuracies,
too many ads, and the small size of the
paper.
Miller noted that although only
about one-half of those questionnaires
sent out were returned, he felt the

sample was "representative of most
views about the Daily."
The Daily was praised for its
community services such as Once
Around the Quad, its general news
coverage on campus, its Associated
Press News Summary, and its
timeliness.
Many of those surveyed also praised
the newspaper for its consistent
publication, conciseness, entertainment
section, open forum on the opinion
page, and informational value.
Fred Mann, editor of the Daily, said
he was "pleased" with the high

readership of the Daily and felt the
criticisms of the newspaper were
usually valid. "We are taking the results
of the survey very seriously," he said,
"and are trying to respond better to the
wishes of our readers."
He noted that this quarter, in
response to the survey, the
entertainment section and the AP news
summary have been expanded, the
proportion of advertising in the
newspaper has been reduced, and the
average size of the newspaper has
increased nearly two pages from last
year.
More than three out of four
members of the Stanford Community
read the Stanford Daily on any given
day, according to a recent survey.
The survey claims, on the basis of
335 returned questionnaires, that "on
any given day 75 percent of the
students, 75 percent of the staff, and
78 percent of the faculty will read the
Daily." Based on a student population
of 12,500 and a faculty staff of over
7,000, the daily readership would reach
around 15,000.
A part of a SWOPSI course studying
the possible independence of the
newspaper and financed by the Dean of
Students Office, the eight page
questionnaire asked students, faculty,
and staff about their readership habits
of newspapers, and their opinions of
the Daily.
The report claims that students,
faculty and staff all feel the Daily is the
most important source of campus news,
although Campus Report and the
Stanford Observer are also important
sources for faculty and staff.
According to Frank Miller, author of
the survey and news editor of the
Daily, "Students generally felt the
Daily was reliable in its news coverage,
staff generally agreed, but faculty were
extremely critical of the newspaper's
reliability—sl percent felt it was below
average."
In a comparison with the reliability
of other publications, Campus Report
was given the best reliability rating
(although there was a large percentage
of people who felt they didn't know)
and the San Francisco Chronicle and
Palo Alto Times were given very poor
reliability ratings.
The survey revealed that although

the Stanford community reads the
newspaper often, few people would be
willing to buy it if it were for sale at 10
cents per issue.
According to Miller, "Only about 8
percent of the students, 24 percent of
the faculty and 21 percent of the staff
indicated that they would be willing to
buy the paper regularly. And,
furthermore, about half of those
surveyed said they would never buy the
Daily if it were for sale." (The Daily is
currently distributed free on campus
although students pay $4 per year
added on to their tuition bill for the
newspaper.)
Miller termed the low number of
those willing to buy the newspaper
"discouraging" to those within the
Stanford community who wish the
paper to go to individual subscriptions.

except political coverage. Students gave
