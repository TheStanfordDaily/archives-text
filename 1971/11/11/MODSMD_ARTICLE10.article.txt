## ‘Hear No Evil...’ 
### 
Joel s. yudken

After reading the various letters
and articles in the Daily written
by faculty in the Engineering and
Medical school, in defense of their
research, I get the distinct
impression that they have adopted
a stance of "Hear no evil, See no
evil, Speak no evil." If these
supposedly rational and objective
men would stop cawing like old
crows and listen to what is really
being said they may begin to
comprehend that what Young

Crows and others are attacking is
not the researcher's personal
motives but rather military
research.
Their personal motivations no
matter how noble, are relative
irrelevant to that of the military.
Researchers are merely servants of
the system, not makers of policy.
However we believe that it is their
responsibility as citizens and
human beings to begin to at least
become aware of the destructive
consequences of their work that
other people are forced to reap.
What the SWOPSI report
strongly suggests, and what the
Young Crows are trying to prove,
is that military sponsored research
at Stanford is part of a large
military technology
establishment. This establishment
has determined what research it
will support according to specific
needs and requirements, derived
from actual military programs and
combat situations. The DOD
research program has been
carefully nurtured ever since
World War II by Pentagon
planners, industrialists,
administrators and some eminent
faculty members and tailored to
the technological requirements of
the military.
The Young Crows have never
denied that a lot of military work
has potential non-military
applications. In fact we'll even
admit that some of these
applications could be useful to
people. But in dealing with this
issue most researchers show a
profound ignorance of the
historical milieu in which they
live.

In most cases of military
sponsored work the DOD has
relatively specific and immediate
ends in mind. Meanwhile,
non-military applications are
always given the vague appellation
of "potential."
In other words, the probability
of a peaceful applications of this
sort of research is significantly
smaller than military ones in the
context of a United States at war
in Southeast Asia, and a United
States government which is trying
to control as much of its peoples
resources in order to extend
American domination.
In all cases the Young Crows
have only made statements which
it feels are true and can be
supported by documentation.
Such documentaiton includes
Congressional hearings, the
SWOPSI report and many
industrial and military journals
where they openly discuss with
pride the various military
appliations of the technologies
developed in industrial and
university laboratories.
It is nnfortuantely not possible
to debate here all the various
complexities of the issue.
However, we welcome any
researcher, or anyone else for that
matter, to come to the Indo-China
Group symposium, on DOD at
Stanford, tonight, to debate the
issue at length. We will also be
happy to discuss rationally, and
specific half-truths and errors in
judgment that some may feel we
have made.
