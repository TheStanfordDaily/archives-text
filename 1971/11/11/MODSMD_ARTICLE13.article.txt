# Kid To Conduct Stanford Band
## 
### 
Thirteen-year-old Andy
Radford of Oakland will be the
happiest kid in the Bay Area
about 3 p.m. Saturday, Nov. 13.
That will be about the time he
personally conducts the 110-piece
Stanford University marching
band at halftime during the
Stanford-San Jose State game.
What's more, Andy paid $140
for the privilege. He won the right
to conduct the band by making
the highest bid for them at the
annual KQED auction earlier this
year.
Andy, who lives with his
mother, Mrs. Jean M. Radford in
Oakland, confided in a recent
letter to Band Manager Dave Ruiz
that he played the trumpet
himself and was looking forward
to conducting the band as a
"unique musical experience."

Mrs. Radford, a Stanford
alumna of the Class of 195 2,
wrote Ruiz that Andy earned
most of the money he bid for the
band as a carrier boy for the
Oakland Tribune. He hopes to
attend Stanford himself some day,
she added.
Andy will rehearse a few times
with the band before making his
debut before an estimated 35,000
persons in Stanford Stadium.
