". . . come one, come all, we 're gonna have a
ball,
Down at the function at the junction.

San Francisco's Harding Theatre, at 616
Divisadero St., hasn't been noted for staging
any notable musical performances, rock, soul,
or otherwise. Oh yes, Curtis Mayfield and
Hugh Masakela both made appearances on the
small stage there, but that's kinda what you'd
expect from a tiny, community-oriented
theatre in the primarily black Fillmore district.
It's an absolutely wonderful little place.
There are old, wood-paneled doors; a big,
weathered marquee outside; an airy lobby with
a nice rug; very passable acoustics in a fairly
unadorned theater proper; and maybe 500
roomy seats on the ground floor. Upstairs, in
the balcony, are perhaps 300 huge, plush seats
cum sofas—sporting such niceties as double
legroom, padded armrests and seat backs (to
rest one's head), and a perfect view of the
stage from every angle.
You can feel pleasantly comfortable, and
intimate, with whomever is on stage at the
Harding. The worst seat in the house is no
more than a hundred feet away.
A lot of us, you see, still can't quite believe
that the Grateful Dead (Lord-A-Mercy!)
played the Harding this past Saturday and
Sunday nights. Essentially it's like bopping
down to the local Bijou to catch the Stones.
But the Dead simply called it "a little party for
our friends." And for the friends who couldn't
make it, the exceedingly wonderful KSFX
(103.7 on the FM dial) broadcast the Sunday
night gig live.
The Truely Faithful
Admittedly the regularly scheduled
gatherings at Winterland are attended by the
devoted, but it was the truly faithful who
made it to the Harding last weekend. It was a
gathering right out of the old Haight, five years
before. Older faces, gentled faces. Faithful
friends.
"It's like walking into a huge party,"
exclaimed Uncle Bub. And so it was. Why,
there was Big Mac, Erwin Clair, Funk and
Tomaso (not to mention Mr. Mellow, C. Mel
Chewey and Robbie Sue) and Stony Ralph
Brown and the Boys. It was so good to be back
together!
One still tends, you see, to associate the
Dead with the great assemblings of the masses
at the Fillmore and Winterland. And quite
rightly, for they synthesized more of the
memorable nights there than any other group,
with the possible exception of the Airplane.
Unfortunately, one could never feel entirely
comfortable, in a physical sense, at the latter
two; once everybody pressed forward you
could always find room to sit on the floor, but
that's exactly what it was—sitting on the floor.
Rock Without Seats
For the first time in living memory, San
Franciscans and their friends who had been
weaned on rock concerts without seats could
sit back in pure physical comfort and absorb
their Dead. This is not to say that the folks
couldn't get up and "truck," for there was
plenty of space for that down front or in front
of your seat, or even on top of your seat, but
there is something to be said for the pleasure
of lounging back.
It would have been enough (as the old
Jewish Passover song goes) that the Dead
re-affirmed that they are the Great American
Band, the greatest and most powerful
rock-and-roll band alive today. It would have
been enough that the Dead played for
four-and-one-half hours on both nights (and
absolutely nobody plays four-and-one-half
hours anymore) and only charged Three
Dollars ($3.00). It would have been enough
that technically and musically they were tight,
drivin', cookin' as always, and played most of
the favorite tunes superbly well. It would have
been enough to know that some friend was
probably making a tape off KSFX of the
whole thing. It would have been enough that
the crowd was typically warm and friendly and
well-stoked.
But the Dead at the little Harding? That
combination was almost too much to take.
Long Road Tour
The Dead had been, for several months, on
a long road tour through Texas and the
Southwest. Probably the last time they played
in the Bay Area was the closing of the Fillmore
West, when they were tired and feeling hassled.
Pigpen had not accompanied them; he is still
recuperating from liver maladies. But Keith
Godcheaux (formerly with Dave Mason) filled
in superbly at the concert on keyboards.
Although it was assumed that they
wouldn't be back in town till Thanksgiving,
the Dead family decided to rent out the
Harding for a two-night "party." It was
cheaply acquired, small, and it gave them the
chance to do a live broadcast, without the
hassles of Winterland, KSAN, and Bill Graham.
Rock Scully, the Dead's manager, contacted
Eric Christensen of KSFX, the ABC-affiliated
station that, along with WPLJ in New York,
has been returning a measure of the old-time
greatness to rock radio.

They had only two days to set up the
equipment, and although the monitors cut out
several times and the signal was sometimes
weak, the quality of the broadcast and the
music was sensational. (KSFX, by the way,
intends to air a live 8.8. King broadcast
recorded in New York, on Thanksgiving Eve.)
Workingman's Dead
Just as their memorable four-night gig at
the Fillmore West two summers ago ushered in
the era of "Workingman's Dead" and
"American Beauty," hallmarked by intricate
harmony and a mellow country influence, this
two-day gig at the Harding marked their
transition into good oF rock n' roll. They're a
band you not only come to see and hear, but
also to dance and jump and smile to. A band,
not just a group.
But why don't people go to concerts to
dance anymore?
Dead freaks, for instance, go to concerts
fully expecting to shake a leg. "Getting up to
truck" is the way it's usually put. But today
that's something unique in the rock world. For
one thing, the closing of the two Fillmores
dealt a severe blow to the small rock concert
scene. Now there's only Winterland, or the
S.F. Civic, or, God forbid, the Oakland
Coliseum. In New York, there are only
overpriced clubs, over-sold Howard Stein
rip-offs, and Madison Square Garden.
But there hasn't been an emphasis on
dancing since the early days of rock'n roll.
Probably it goes back even further, back to the
great dance bands of the '40's and '5 o's. Just
read the Autobiography of Malcolm X,
wherein you'll find colorful descriptions of the

emotional frenzy and excitement generated by
the Kings of "Swing" in the East coast
ballrooms. Much of that excitement was
translated into the early boppin' rock of Bill
Haley, Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, and Elvis,
which in turn became Chubby Checker and the
British invasion.
Old Hips—Dance Steps
The Dead hearken back to a time when it
was fun to throw the old hips around and
work out new dance steps on the living room
floor.
For more than a year now the Dead have
been putting on huge dance concerts, or so
they've seemed. Recall the "Airwaves" benefit
at the Fillmore, when we danced until 4:00
a.m., or the great Memorial Day concerts. It
might be described as constant rushing for five
hours.
Or maybe you were at the Gaelic Park
outdoor concert this summer in New York,
where the music went on from 6:30 till 11:45 .
Or maybe you were at the Harding.
But even if you weren't, you've probably
heard their newest release, the double live LP,
recorded at Winterland, the Fillmore East, and
the Manhattan Centre in New York.
Honest Dance Music
Most critics have been down on this release,
although it's been anxiously awaited for more
than a year now. So impatient were the local
freaks that they even started unearthing old
tapes of great concerts, swapping them, and
lending them to radio stations.
It is a legitimately great album. If nothing
else, it's the only honest-to-God dance music
album we have from the Dead, and if you're
not privileged to own an underground Dead
tape, here are a whole mess of 'em on an
album.

Unfortunately the album doesn't convey
the incredible power that the Dead unleash in
concetrt. But the fault lies not with the Dead,
but with the inherent difficulty of pressing
into vinyl the whole emotional frenzy and
continuous body rush these fellows create live.
With the exception of "St. Stephen" from
"Live Dead," they've never been able to
capture on record the ethereal qualities that so
move their following. Yes, "Workingman's
Dead" and "American Beauty" are classic
albums; but they don't even give an inkling of
what can be done with those songs live in
concert.
Pretty Stony
Dead concerts are traditionally pretty
stony/trippy affairs. But the real high is the
emotional esctasy that builds up internally for
their music.
This aspect is most difficult to write on.
How can I really describe why I felt like
passing out atthes/29 concert simply because
the Dead were "so beautiful." Perhaps it's
sufficient to say that these musicians have the
power to transport you away from
yourself—away from the concert hall, away
from the buddies, from the girl or boyfriend,
and into the realm of pure, unadulterated bliss.
It's very hard, for instance, to hold onto
someone during a Dead concert; both of you
want to feel this psychic force full blast. And
you see it externally expressed in almost every
face; in joyful eyes, constantly moving bodies,
and tears streaming down cheeks.
Truckin' Along
It was the most incredible four-hour rush
you could ever hope to experience. And those

of you who don't know what on earth I'm
babbling about probably never will.
Backed by one of the finer light shows
produced this year, courtesy of heavy water,
the Dead opened with "Truckin';" not the
high-powered version they've been grinding
out during the past year, but a very personal
rendition right out of "American Beauty"
bespoke their return to their stomping
grounds.
Highlights of their first set included a fine,
hard-rock version of "Cumberland Blues" (off
"Workingmans Dead"), the famous Bob Weir
rendition of Jay and the American's classic "El
Paso," Garcia's "Big Railroad Blues" off the
new release, and "Sugarbee," a song they've
often played in concert but never
recorded—featuring a happy, lilting melody
with a bass-rhythm interplay that carries the
tune right into the rafters.
Breathing Resumes
"Saturday Night," probably an old Chuck
Berry hit but which sounded more like the
Dave Clark Five, ended the first set, and
everybody sat back, talked, and resumed
breathing for awhile.
"Me and Bobby McGee," their version of
the Janis/Kristofferson hit that sounds so fine
on the new album, got the second set moving,
and without wasting any energy soared into a
rendition of "Sugar Magnolia" that was
nothing less than a cosmic orgasm.
The first of the traditional flares was lit
sometime in the middle, and everyone let out a
collective groan of pleasure.
"Dark Star," the great acidic triumph off
"Live-Dead," featuring free-form guitar work
from Garcia, Weir, and Lesh followed. Flowing
into "The Other One," (another acid-based
floater from "Anthem of the Sun" and the
new album), the Dead 'tripped-out' many in
the crowd, zonked or not. This journey lasted
an hour, but before it was done they launched
into a madcap version of "Me and My Uncle'
(off the new release), only to return again to
"The Other One."
A superb "Brokedown Palace" followed,
capped by "Playing In The Band,' an old
favorite of past concerts which is included on
the new album. An unimpressive "Casey
Jones" was offered up, but was more than
compensated for by "Not Fade Away' into
"Coin' Down the Road Feelin' Bad," proving
once again that the album version may be fine
indeed but when they cook it for you on stage
you may be sure that it's well-done.
Following a 20 minute standing ovation
that seemed more desperate than excited, they
returned with the traditional closing piece
"Johnny B. Goode," and followed that with
"Uncle John's Band."
KSFX is hoping that the Dead will
renounce their traditional New Year's Eve
concert at Bill Graham's Winterland for the
intimacy of the Harding. That could be a little
hard to take; you'd almost have to go into
training for it. I mean, twelve hours of the
Grateful Dead at the Harding? Could you
believe it? Huh?
