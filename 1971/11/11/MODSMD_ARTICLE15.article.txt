# Big Names At Circle Star
## Great Night Of Jazz 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
When one mentions jazz festivals, places like
Newport and Monterey immediately come to mind.
The picture is one of top jazz groups and thousands
of fans coming together for a few days of constantly
high-level music. No one would dare to say that San
Carlos is about to join this list, but there is a very
fine assortment of jazz being offered there at the
Circle Star Theatre.
Eddie Harris, Ramsey Lewis, Sarah Vaughan and
Joe Williams are performing through Sunday in a
show which gives you a taste of some of the best
performers from different areas of jazz.
Tuesday's opening night show led off with tenor
saxophonist Eddie Harris. Harris is commonly
referred to as "Electric Eddie." Electrifying is an
apt adjective not only for his frequent method of
sound amplification but also for his effect on an
audience.
Extraordinary Saxophone
Harris has combined with Les McCann to
produce some great albums, but his live saxophone
is extraordinary. He has mastered the concept of an
electric saxophone to incredible dimensions. By
combining his musical talent with a great
understanding of electronic sound, Harris is able to
produce some of the finest sax sounds I have heard.
He mixes long clear notes with tricky trills and
runs. He can move smoothly from traditional tenor
sax sounds to some reminiscient of an old theater
pipe organ to innovative new ones. On a number
called "The Children's Song," he produces some
African sounds which I would never believe could
come out of a saxophone.
At times he made his sax into a strictly rhythm
instrument, often sounding like somebody using a
washboard. He also used an electrical device in his
mouth which allowed him to develop some
remarkable woo-woo vocal effects through his
instrument. All this is done without playing a note.
Explaining what he had done in "The Children's
Song," he said, "Those of you who think it is
gimmickery or bullshitting—try it. I'm not playing
notes, I sing right through it and I have to stay on
key and rhythm. He aptly described his back-up
musicians (a guitarist, bassist, drummer and pianist)
as musicians who "can really play their asses off."
Next up was singer Joe Williams. I embarrassingly
confess that I had never heard of Williams before
last night. A biographical sketch in the program
described him as "a singer's singer . . . who may well
be the last of the great band-orientated singers."
Big bands may be pretty much gone, but now
that I've seen Williams I can say that the kind of
singing which was a trademark of that era is still
alive.
Williams started off with a classic blues number,
"Every Day." He slipped in some lines from more
contemporary songs like "C.C. Ryder" and "It's
Your Thing" and produced a most interesting
effect. The way Williams sings "00000000-hh," is
unforgettable. And with bassist Rufus Reed doing as
fine a job as he did with Harris and pianist Ellis
Hawkins "playing the blues" as Williams put it, it
was a great song.
Singing The Blues
For the rest of his slot, Williams moved around

from slow things like Duke Ellington's "Heritage"
to swingers like "I'm An Evil Man," and the old
1938 Joe Turner-Pete Johnson hit (you all
remember Joe and Pete), "Rollin' Pete." He was
definitely at his best singing the blues on songs like
"Monkey Woman," Bessie Smith's "Nobody Knows
You," and a very poignant song by a girl from
Jackson State College called "Why For You."
Following intermission, the Ramsey Lewis trio
came flying on stage. And 1 mean flying. Bass player
Cleveland Eaton moves as much as some go-go
dancers when he plays and at times, Lewis seems to
be attacking the piano. But Lewis can change in a
minute to the mellowest, sweetest notes imaginable.
On one of Eaton's composition, "Love Now
On," all three members of the trio get to display
their individual talents. Eaton does some
out-of-this-world things on his bass with some great
riffs in which he utilizes some fine trills and some
good old thumping. Percussionist Morris Jennings
handles his drums expertly. And out in front is
Lewis himself.
He covers a whole spectrum of piano techniques
in a single song, maneuvering tempo, rhythm and
harmony expertly. At one point he even plucks a
piano string in a totally unexpected move.
Remarkable Refrains
The trio performed their classic "In Crowd" and
ended up with an outstanding version of Buddy
Miles hit, "Them Changes," in which Eaton played
some remarkable refrains. A musical dream would
be to have "Them Changes" with Eaton thumping
out the beginning of the refrain, followed by
Buddy's blazing horns. When it happens, I want to
be there.
To finish up the night, out came the legendary
vocalist, Sarah Vaughan. I had seen her at the
Monterey Jazz Festival in September but 1 got a lot
more out of Tuesday's night performance. Vaughan
took a while to get going, but she finally got into
some songs which demonstrated why she has been
credited with having one of the great voices in jazz
history.
Like Williams, she does some good swingers like
"Got A Lot of Living To Do." But she is at her best
on the slower things, especially love songs like
"What Are You Doing The Rest Of Your Life,"
"Misty," "There Will Never Be Another You," and
even "Love Story. Her tendency to bellow at times
bothers me and age seems to have taken a bit of a
toll, but Vaughan is still a strong vocalist.
Unfortunately only a sparse crowd saw the show.
Hopefully things will pick up this weekend. This is a
truly rare chance to see some of the bigger names in
jazz all at once in the same place. Longer sets,
especially by Harris and Lewis would've been nice,
but I was quite impressed with the high quality
short sets I heard.
(Performances will be given tonight and
tomorrow night at 8:30 p.m., Saturday night at
7:30 and 10:30 p.m. and on Sunday at 3 and 7:30
p.m. Tickets arc priced from $2.50 to $4.50 tonight
and tomorrow night, $3-$5 Friday and Saturday
nights and $2-$4 on Sunday night. The Circle Star-

produce some of the finest sax sounds I have heard.
He mixes long clear notes with tricky trills and
runs. He can move smoothly from traditional tenor
sax sounds to some reminiscient of an old theater
pipe organ to innovative new ones. On a number
called "The Children's Song," he produces some
African sounds which I would never believe could
come out of a saxophone.
At times he made his sax into a strictly rhythm
instrument, often sounding like somebody using a
washboard. He also used an electrical device in his
mouth which allowed him to develop some
remarkable woo-woo vocal effects through his
instrument. All this is done without playing a note.
Explaining what he had done in "The Children's
Song," he said, "Those of you who think it is
gimmickery or bullshitting—try it. I'm not playing
notes, I sing right through it and I have to stay on
key and rhythm. He aptly described his back-up
musicians (a guitarist, bassist, drummer and pianist)
as musicians who "can really play their asses off."
Next up was singer Joe Williams. I embarrassingly
confess that I had never heard of Williams before
last night. A biographical sketch in the program
described him as "a singer's singer . . . who may well
be the last of the great band-orientated singers."
Big bands may be pretty much gone, but now
that I've seen Williams I can say that the kind of
singing which was a trademark of that era is still
alive.
Williams started off with a classic blues number,
"Every Day." He slipped in some lines from more
contemporary songs like "C.C. Ryder" and "It's
Your Thing" and produced a most interesting
effect. The way Williams sings "00000000-hh," is
unforgettable. And with bassist Rufus Reed doing as
fine a job as he did with Harris and pianist Ellis
Hawkins "playing the blues" as Williams put it, it
was a great song.
Singing The Blues
For the rest of his slot, Williams moved around

from slow things like Duke Ellington's "Heritage"
to swingers like "I'm An Evil Man," and the old
1938 Joe Turner-Pete Johnson hit (you all
remember Joe and Pete), "Rollin' Pete." He was
definitely at his best singing the blues on songs like
"Monkey Woman," Bessie Smith's "Nobody Knows
You," and a very poignant song by a girl from
Jackson State College called "Why For You."
Following intermission, the Ramsey Lewis trio
came flying on stage. And 1 mean flying. Bass player
Cleveland Eaton moves as much as some go-go
dancers when he plays and at times, Lewis seems to
be attacking the piano. But Lewis can change in a
minute to the mellowest, sweetest notes imaginable.
On one of Eaton's composition, "Love Now
On," all three members of the trio get to display
their individual talents. Eaton does some
out-of-this-world things on his bass with some great
riffs in which he utilizes some fine trills and some
good old thumping. Percussionist Morris Jennings
handles his drums expertly. And out in front is
Lewis himself.
He covers a whole spectrum of piano techniques
in a single song, maneuvering tempo, rhythm and
harmony expertly. At one point he even plucks a
piano string in a totally unexpected move.
Remarkable Refrains
The trio performed their classic "In Crowd" and
ended up with an outstanding version of Buddy
Miles hit, "Them Changes," in which Eaton played
some remarkable refrains. A musical dream would
be to have "Them Changes" with Eaton thumping
out the beginning of the refrain, followed by
Buddy's blazing horns. When it happens, I want to
be there.
To finish up the night, out came the legendary
vocalist, Sarah Vaughan. I had seen her at the
Monterey Jazz Festival in September but 1 got a lot
more out of Tuesday's night performance. Vaughan
took a while to get going, but she finally got into
some songs which demonstrated why she has been
credited with having one of the great voices in jazz
history.
Like Williams, she does some good swingers like
"Got A Lot of Living To Do." But she is at her best
on the slower things, especially love songs like
"What Are You Doing The Rest Of Your Life,"
"Misty," "There Will Never Be Another You," and
even "Love Story. Her tendency to bellow at times
bothers me and age seems to have taken a bit of a
toll, but Vaughan is still a strong vocalist.
Unfortunately only a sparse crowd saw the show.
Hopefully things will pick up this weekend. This is a
truly rare chance to see some of the bigger names in
jazz all at once in the same place. Longer sets,
especially by Harris and Lewis would've been nice,
but I was quite impressed with the high quality
short sets I heard.
(Performances will be given tonight and
tomorrow night at 8:30 p.m., Saturday night at
7:30 and 10:30 p.m. and on Sunday at 3 and 7:30
p.m. Tickets arc priced from $2.50 to $4.50 tonight
and tomorrow night, $3-$5 Friday and Saturday
nights and $2-$4 on Sunday night. The Circle Star-
Theatre is located off the Bayshore Freeway in San
Carlos.)
When one mentions jazz festivals, places like
Newport and Monterey immediately come to mind.
The picture is one of top jazz groups and thousands
of fans coming together for a few days of constantly
high-level music. No one would dare to say that San
Carlos is about to join this list, but there is a very
fine assortment of jazz being offered there at the
Circle Star Theatre.
Eddie Harris, Ramsey Lewis, Sarah Vaughan and
Joe Williams are performing through Sunday in a
show which gives you a taste of some of the best
performers from different areas of jazz.
Tuesday's opening night show led off with tenor
saxophonist Eddie Harris. Harris is commonly
referred to as "Electric Eddie." Electrifying is an
apt adjective not only for his frequent method of
sound amplification but also for his effect on an
audience.
Extraordinary Saxophone
Harris has combined with Les McCann to
produce some great albums, but his live saxophone
is extraordinary. He has mastered the concept of an
electric saxophone to incredible dimensions. By
combining his musical talent with a great
understanding of electronic sound, Harris is able to
produce some of the finest sax sounds I have heard.
He mixes long clear notes with tricky trills and
runs. He can move smoothly from traditional tenor
sax sounds to some reminiscient of an old theater

confess that I had never heard of Williams before
last night. A biographical sketch in the program
described him as "a singer's singer . . . who may well
be the last of the great band-orientated singers."
Big bands may be pretty much gone, but now
that I've seen Williams I can say that the kind of
singing which was a trademark of that era is still
alive.
Williams started off with a classic blues number,
"Every Day." He slipped in some lines from more
contemporary songs like "C.C. Ryder" and "It's
Your Thing" and produced a most interesting
effect. The way Williams sings "00000000-hh," is
unforgettable. And with bassist Rufus Reed doing as
fine a job as he did with Harris and pianist Ellis
Hawkins "playing the blues" as Williams put it, it
was a great song.
Singing The Blues
For the rest of his slot, Williams moved around

from slow things like Duke Ellington's "Heritage"
to swingers like "I'm An Evil Man," and the old
1938 Joe Turner-Pete Johnson hit (you all
remember Joe and Pete), "Rollin' Pete." He was
definitely at his best singing the blues on songs like
"Monkey Woman," Bessie Smith's "Nobody Knows
You," and a very poignant song by a girl from
Jackson State College called "Why For You."
Following intermission, the Ramsey Lewis trio
came flying on stage. And 1 mean flying. Bass player
Cleveland Eaton moves as much as some go-go
dancers when he plays and at times, Lewis seems to
be attacking the piano. But Lewis can change in a
minute to the mellowest, sweetest notes imaginable.
On one of Eaton's composition, "Love Now
On," all three members of the trio get to display
their individual talents. Eaton does some
out-of-this-world things on his bass with some great
riffs in which he utilizes some fine trills and some
good old thumping. Percussionist Morris Jennings
handles his drums expertly. And out in front is
Lewis himself.
He covers a whole spectrum of piano techniques
in a single song, maneuvering tempo, rhythm and
harmony expertly. At one point he even plucks a
piano string in a totally unexpected move.
Remarkable Refrains
The trio performed their classic "In Crowd" and
ended up with an outstanding version of Buddy
Miles hit, "Them Changes," in which Eaton played
some remarkable refrains. A musical dream would
be to have "Them Changes" with Eaton thumping
out the beginning of the refrain, followed by
Buddy's blazing horns. When it happens, I want to
be there.
To finish up the night, out came the legendary
vocalist, Sarah Vaughan. I had seen her at the
Monterey Jazz Festival in September but 1 got a lot
more out of Tuesday's night performance. Vaughan
took a while to get going, but she finally got into
some songs which demonstrated why she has been
credited with having one of the great voices in jazz
history.
Like Williams, she does some good swingers like
"Got A Lot of Living To Do." But she is at her best
on the slower things, especially love songs like
"What Are You Doing The Rest Of Your Life,"
"Misty," "There Will Never Be Another You," and
even "Love Story. Her tendency to bellow at times
bothers me and age seems to have taken a bit of a
toll, but Vaughan is still a strong vocalist.
Unfortunately only a sparse crowd saw the show.
Hopefully things will pick up this weekend. This is a
truly rare chance to see some of the bigger names in
jazz all at once in the same place. Longer sets,
especially by Harris and Lewis would've been nice,
but I was quite impressed with the high quality
short sets I heard.
(Performances will be given tonight and
tomorrow night at 8:30 p.m., Saturday night at
7:30 and 10:30 p.m. and on Sunday at 3 and 7:30
p.m. Tickets arc priced from $2.50 to $4.50 tonight
and tomorrow night, $3-$5 Friday and Saturday
nights and $2-$4 on Sunday night. The Circle Star-
Theatre is located off the Bayshore Freeway in San
Carlos.)
When one mentions jazz festivals, places like
Newport and Monterey immediately come to mind.
The picture is one of top jazz groups and thousands
of fans coming together for a few days of constantly
high-level music. No one would dare to say that San
Carlos is about to join this list, but there is a very
fine assortment of jazz being offered there at the
Circle Star Theatre.
Eddie Harris, Ramsey Lewis, Sarah Vaughan and
Joe Williams are performing through Sunday in a
show which gives you a taste of some of the best
performers from different areas of jazz.
Tuesday's opening night show led off with tenor
saxophonist Eddie Harris. Harris is commonly
referred to as "Electric Eddie." Electrifying is an
apt adjective not only for his frequent method of
sound amplification but also for his effect on an
audience.
Extraordinary Saxophone
Harris has combined with Les McCann to
produce some great albums, but his live saxophone
is extraordinary. He has mastered the concept of an
electric saxophone to incredible dimensions. By
combining his musical talent with a great
understanding of electronic sound, Harris is able to
produce some of the finest sax sounds I have heard.
He mixes long clear notes with tricky trills and
runs. He can move smoothly from traditional tenor
sax sounds to some reminiscient of an old theater
pipe organ to innovative new ones. On a number
called "The Children's Song," he produces some
African sounds which I would never believe could
come out of a saxophone.
At times he made his sax into a strictly rhythm
instrument, often sounding like somebody using a
washboard. He also used an electrical device in his
mouth which allowed him to develop some
remarkable woo-woo vocal effects through his
instrument. All this is done without playing a note.
Explaining what he had done in "The Children's
Song," he said, "Those of you who think it is
gimmickery or bullshitting—try it. I'm not playing
notes, I sing right through it and I have to stay on
key and rhythm. He aptly described his back-up
musicians (a guitarist, bassist, drummer and pianist)
as musicians who "can really play their asses off."
Next up was singer Joe Williams. I embarrassingly
confess that I had never heard of Williams before
last night. A biographical sketch in the program
