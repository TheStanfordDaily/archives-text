## Foreign Aid Bills 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” The Senate passed last night a trimmed
$1.1-billion foreign economic aid bill while the House
approved interim new life for foreign assistance.
By a vote of 61 to 23, the Senate passed its new bill
after rejecting amendments increasing funds and easing
lending restrictions. Action on military aid, the second half
of the $2 .3-billion package, is scheduled today.
The House rejected by a 175 -34 vote an effort to limit
its foreign aid action to military assistance by eliminating
economic aid from a resolution temporarily continuing the
program at current levels.
The economic aid measure passed Wednesday night by
the Senate includes many of the restrictions in the bill that
was killed, including a ban on aid and military sales to
Pakistan and a requirement that $12 billion in impounded
domestic funds be released before aid funds can be spent.
Before the final vote, the Senate rejected 45 to 39 a
nonbinding move to register congressional approval of a
reduction in U.S. support for United Nations agencies.
