MIAMI BEACH, Fla. â€” AFL-CIO President George Meany
and other labor leaders vowed Wednesday to fight new
federal wage controls which they said would violate labor
contracts covering millions of workers.
"We will not stand still and see our contracts abrogated,
our work standards destroyed, our earnings drastically
diminished while all around us other sectors of the
economy are doing business as usual," Meany said.
But there was a deepening split among union leaders
over whether Meany and four other labor members should
quit President Nixon's 15-man Pay Board or stay on it to
fight from within.
The executive board of the 500,000-member
Amalgamated Meat Cutters said it will call strikes if
employers who have raised prices refuse to give its members
pay hikes blocked by the 90-day wage-price freeze which
expires Nov. 15.
