# Rose Bowl Tickets
## 
### CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
The Department of Athletics has
tentatively set December 2 as the date
for student sale of Rose Bowl tickets.
Tickets will be on sale from 3-10 p.m.
at Roscoe Maples Pavilion.
The procedure will be the same as
last year, with one ticket allowed per
student body card and a maximum of
fwo cards per buyer. The price for
student tickets has not been
determined yet, but students may have
to pay the full face value of the tickets
instead of the 50 percent discount they
received last year. Any current student
is assured of a ticket if he goes to
Maples during the allotted time for
student ticket sales.
All regular season ticket holders will
receive an application good for one
Rose Bowl ticket for every season pass
purchased. Faculty and staff family
season ticket buyers will be able to buy
two tickets for every family ticket
purchased. Family ticket holders who
bought them through an agency must
bring their stub to the ticket office
because they will not be mailed an
application form.
Buck Club members will receive an

application form entitling them to as
many as eight tickets, according to
their Buck Club classification. A "big
chief" ($5 00 contributor) can buy eight
tickets while a contributor of any
amount has options on two tickets.
Only contributions made before
September Ist of this year will apply
toward Rose Bowl ticket privileges.
Stanford's share of Rose Bowl
tickets is approximately 41,000, and
after the students, season ticket
holders, family ticket holders, and
Buck Club members have exercised
their options, the remaining tickets will
be put in the Alumni draw. The draw
will probably be smaller this year due
to the rise in season and family tickets
sales of about 3,500 over last year.
Faculty, staff, and alumni
association members will be eligible to
enter the draw using the forms
distributed in November's Stanford
Observer. The only way to enter the
draw will be with the Observer form.
All ticket prices have not been set
yet because of President Nixon's wage
and price freeze. The price should be
established on or around November 15 ,
and w ill be either $ 8 or $ 10.
