## 
### BOB BACON 
Faculty and staff salary increases
scheduled to take effect September 1
will probably be implemented
beginning November 15, according to
Robert R. Augsberger, Vice President
for Business and Finance.
During a press conference on KZSU
Tuesday, Augsberger stressed that this
was only his tentative interpretation
and that he had not yet carefully
studied the Pay Board's regulations on
pay increases and retroactivity.
He also told student newsmen that
the Board of Trustees yesterday
approved remodeling of Building 120,
Outer Quad (the former Business
School Building). Following the
remodeling the Economics Department
will move from History Corner to the
fourth floor of Encina Hall, and the
Department of Spanish and Portuguese
from 120 to History Corner. The
Sociology Department will expand into
all of Building 120.
In its statement Monday, the Pay
Board said: "On and after Nov. 14,
1971, permissable annual aggregate
increases would be those normally
considered supportable by productivity
improvement and cost of living trends.
Initially, the general pay standard is
established a 55.5 percent." '
The aggregate increase at Stanford is
within this general range.
Concerning possible retroactive
increases, the Pay Board said:
"Scheduled increases in payments
rendered during the 'freeze' of Aug. 16
through Nov. 1 3 may be made only if
approved by the Board in specific
cases."

The University scheduled increases
in tuition room and board rates, which
became effective Sept. 1 in most
instances.
As soon as the promised procedures
are disclosed, Augsburger said the
University would seek Pay Board
approval to make the 1971-72 wage
and salary increases retroactive to Sept.
1.
The 19 71 -72 University budget
provided for average increases of 5 to 6
percent for faculty and staff. The
increase amounts to $100,000 or more
per month.
The Trustees also approved the
addition of a student member to their
Committee on Investments. The
member will be appointed by the ASSU
Senate.
Augsberger also announced the
election of Peter Haas, of the San
Francisco family which owns Levi,
Strauss, and Company, to a seat on the
Board of Trustees.
Augsberger said that "we thought
we were being very fair to the staff" in
asking for their comments on the newly
implemented grievance procedure, and
then modifying it in response to their
suggestions. He added that "the staff
often thinks that we aren't looking
after their best interests, but we like to
think we are considering their interests
along with the others. Without a union,
we don't know who speaks for the
staff."
The panel questioning Augsberger
included Tina Swent, of the Chaparral
Seth Neumann, Pete Williams, and Bob
Lundstrom of KZSU.

studied the Pay Board's regulations on
pay increases and retroactivity.
He also told student newsmen that
the Board of Trustees yesterday
approved remodeling of Building 120,
Outer Quad (the former Business
School Building). Following the
remodeling the Economics Department
will move from History Corner to the
fourth floor of Encina Hall, and the
Department of Spanish and Portuguese
from 120 to History Corner. The
Sociology Department will expand into
all of Building 120.
In its statement Monday, the Pay
Board said: "On and after Nov. 14,
1971, permissable annual aggregate
increases would be those normally
considered supportable by productivity
improvement and cost of living trends.
Initially, the general pay standard is
established a 55.5 percent." '
The aggregate increase at Stanford is
within this general range.
Concerning possible retroactive
increases, the Pay Board said:
"Scheduled increases in payments
rendered during the 'freeze' of Aug. 16
through Nov. 1 3 may be made only if
approved by the Board in specific
cases."

The University scheduled increases
in tuition room and board rates, which
became effective Sept. 1 in most
instances.
As soon as the promised procedures
are disclosed, Augsburger said the
University would seek Pay Board
approval to make the 1971-72 wage
and salary increases retroactive to Sept.
1.
The 19 71 -72 University budget
provided for average increases of 5 to 6
percent for faculty and staff. The
increase amounts to $100,000 or more
per month.
The Trustees also approved the
addition of a student member to their
Committee on Investments. The
member will be appointed by the ASSU
Senate.
Augsberger also announced the
election of Peter Haas, of the San
Francisco family which owns Levi,
Strauss, and Company, to a seat on the
Board of Trustees.
Augsberger said that "we thought
we were being very fair to the staff" in
asking for their comments on the newly
implemented grievance procedure, and
then modifying it in response to their
suggestions. He added that "the staff
often thinks that we aren't looking
after their best interests, but we like to
think we are considering their interests
along with the others. Without a union,
we don't know who speaks for the
staff."
The panel questioning Augsberger
included Tina Swent, of the Chaparral
Seth Neumann, Pete Williams, and Bob
Lundstrom of KZSU.
Faculty and staff salary increases
scheduled to take effect September 1
will probably be implemented
beginning November 15, according to
Robert R. Augsberger, Vice President
for Business and Finance.
During a press conference on KZSU
Tuesday, Augsberger stressed that this
was only his tentative interpretation
and that he had not yet carefully
studied the Pay Board's regulations on
pay increases and retroactivity.
