# Overseas Ballots
## Election Tally Challenged 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
The ASSU has denied an appeal
from students at Stanford's overseas
campuses to invalidate the recent
elections on the grounds that they were
illegally deprived of voting.
And the Senate is scheduled to vote
tonight on whether or not to verify and
validate the results from that election.
According to a letter from Joy
Kelly, a student at the Florence, Italy
campus, the ballots for nominations,
referenda, and the Senate all arrived at
the campus the day after they were due
back at Stanford.
And Ed Kohn, a student at Tours,
France, reported that the campus
received no ballots at all.
Elections Commissioner Alice
Furumoto made the decision to let the
results stand after she received no
direct notification that there had been
any slip-ups.
She cited the fact that the results
from the referenda in Germany were
cabled back to Stanford before the
deadline.
The students from the Italian
campus based their request for
invalidation on Article IV, Section
4.04(f) of the ASSU by-laws, which
provides that the Elections
Commissioner "shall provide the
overseas campuses with official ballots
and directions for voting prior to each
election."
There has been no word on the fate
of the ballots sent to other overseas
campuses, and no word about the

ballots in the Senatorial election from
Germany.
Deadlines Sent
Furumoto explained that a tentative
schedule of deadlines had been sent
along with the nomination petitions,
but admitted that the official
notification of deadlines was sent with
the ballots themselves.
She said that she had allowed extra
time after the deadline in case the
results had been slowed in the mails,
but that nothing ever came.
"In fact, I still haven't received any
word from -them. They could have at
least sent me a telegram telling me that
the results would be late."
"If they don't tell me that things are
going wrong, how am I supposed to
know?"
In her letter, Kelly charged that
"Italy XXIII did not receive
nominations ballots until the day after
the nominations closed, nor did we
receive elections ballots until the day
after they were due back at the home
campus."
Furumoto suggested that, in at least
some cases, the presidents of the
individual campuses might be held
responsible for not arranging the
elections to allow enough time for
voting and returning the results.
Actions Refused
Yesterday morning, she flatly ruled
out the possibility of holding the
complete election over again. "Frankly,
I just can't do it. If they want a new
election, they'll have to get themselves

another commissioner."
Later yesterday, she also ruled out
withdrawing the announced election
results until the overseas votes could be
counted and added to the previous
totals.
"Some people have been disturbed
about the way the election went. But I
know that I can't make a decision in
this that will please everybody.
Somebody's going to be unhappy," said
Furumoto.
She said that she would change the
previously announced results only if
the Senate voted to accept the new
votes.
"Mow that the whole thing's been
run through, I really think it would be
up to the Senate," she said.
By last night, however, she had
firmly decided not to allow the
overseas campus votes.
Diane Fields of the ASSU Council of
Presidents commented "it's the
Election Commissioner's decision to
make, and we'll support her on it all
the way. However, we hope some
provision will be made for an election
to fill the 10 seats currently vacant in
the Senate."
The vacancies occured when not
enough candidacies were filed in two
graduate divisions.
Doug McHenry of the Council
added, "the fault is either with the
overseas presidents or with the mails,"
he stated. He said it would be
"ludicrous" to hold up the Senate
while waiting for "80 or 90 votes."
Need Cited
"It is imperative that there be a
Senate" to decide on several important
issues such as the SJC that will be
coming up for a decision soon, he said.
Furumoto estimated that there are
approximately 400 eligible voters
overseas. Thus, it would be
mathematically impossible for them to
change the results of the defeated
minority appropriations referendum.
However, the child care center vote,
as well as the Senate elections, could
have been effected by the overseas
ballots.

and directions for voting prior to each
election."
There has been no word on the fate
of the ballots sent to other overseas
campuses, and no word about the

ballots in the Senatorial election from
Germany.
Deadlines Sent
Furumoto explained that a tentative
schedule of deadlines had been sent
along with the nomination petitions,
but admitted that the official
notification of deadlines was sent with
the ballots themselves.
She said that she had allowed extra
time after the deadline in case the
results had been slowed in the mails,
but that nothing ever came.
"In fact, I still haven't received any
word from -them. They could have at
least sent me a telegram telling me that
the results would be late."
"If they don't tell me that things are
going wrong, how am I supposed to
know?"
In her letter, Kelly charged that
"Italy XXIII did not receive
nominations ballots until the day after
the nominations closed, nor did we
receive elections ballots until the day
after they were due back at the home
campus."
Furumoto suggested that, in at least
some cases, the presidents of the
individual campuses might be held
responsible for not arranging the
elections to allow enough time for
voting and returning the results.
Actions Refused
Yesterday morning, she flatly ruled
out the possibility of holding the
complete election over again. "Frankly,
I just can't do it. If they want a new
election, they'll have to get themselves

another commissioner."
Later yesterday, she also ruled out
withdrawing the announced election
results until the overseas votes could be
counted and added to the previous
totals.
"Some people have been disturbed
about the way the election went. But I
know that I can't make a decision in
this that will please everybody.
Somebody's going to be unhappy," said
Furumoto.
She said that she would change the
previously announced results only if
the Senate voted to accept the new
votes.
"Mow that the whole thing's been
run through, I really think it would be
up to the Senate," she said.
By last night, however, she had
firmly decided not to allow the
overseas campus votes.
Diane Fields of the ASSU Council of
Presidents commented "it's the
Election Commissioner's decision to
make, and we'll support her on it all
the way. However, we hope some
provision will be made for an election
to fill the 10 seats currently vacant in
the Senate."
The vacancies occured when not
enough candidacies were filed in two
graduate divisions.
Doug McHenry of the Council
added, "the fault is either with the
overseas presidents or with the mails,"
he stated. He said it would be
"ludicrous" to hold up the Senate
while waiting for "80 or 90 votes."
Need Cited
"It is imperative that there be a
Senate" to decide on several important
issues such as the SJC that will be
coming up for a decision soon, he said.
Furumoto estimated that there are
approximately 400 eligible voters
overseas. Thus, it would be
mathematically impossible for them to
change the results of the defeated
minority appropriations referendum.
However, the child care center vote,
as well as the Senate elections, could
have been effected by the overseas
ballots.
The ASSU has denied an appeal
from students at Stanford's overseas
campuses to invalidate the recent
elections on the grounds that they were
illegally deprived of voting.
And the Senate is scheduled to vote
tonight on whether or not to verify and
validate the results from that election.
According to a letter from Joy
Kelly, a student at the Florence, Italy
campus, the ballots for nominations,
referenda, and the Senate all arrived at
the campus the day after they were due
back at Stanford.
And Ed Kohn, a student at Tours,
France, reported that the campus
received no ballots at all.
Elections Commissioner Alice
Furumoto made the decision to let the
results stand after she received no
direct notification that there had been
any slip-ups.
She cited the fact that the results
from the referenda in Germany were
cabled back to Stanford before the
deadline.
The students from the Italian
campus based their request for
invalidation on Article IV, Section
4.04(f) of the ASSU by-laws, which
provides that the Elections
Commissioner "shall provide the
overseas campuses with official ballots
and directions for voting prior to each
election."
