# Libertarians Offer Diverse Views
## 
### KEVIN SMITH Second of a Series 
One of the best known conservative
organizations on campus is the Free
Campus Movement. Junior Chris
Hocker is Chairman of the FCM and
editor of the newspaper, The Arena.
Hocker has been writing for The
Arena and attending FCM meetings
since 1969. This year, he replaced
current Vice-Chairman Ray White as
Chairman.
Hocker describes the FCM as being
composed of two factions, one more
libertaiian than the other. He says he
was concerned that the FCM would
turn into a "go out and monitor the
rads type routine which I didn't want
to see happen." Hocker sees his main
role as bringing FCM philosophy to
public attention.
Since "Ray (White) places more
value in the action aspects than the
implementation of theory," Hocker
said, a compromise was reached: White
handles rallies, and Hocker the
information and publicity.
Regarding the FCM's libertarian

faction, Hocker said they "are
concerned with the limitation of
government controls on people's lives.
Libertarians tend to question any move
by the government." Hocker conceded
that he agrees with the radical left some
of the time.
The FCM's non-libertarian branch
feels that its primary duty is to see that
overt attacks on university property
and people are minimized. Protection
of private property is one of FCM's
main goals.
As of now, FCM exists only at
Stanford. The only other known
organization with a combination of
picture-takers and libertarians is at
Columbia University. There are similar
independent groups on other campuses.
The FCM was formerly a chapter of
the Young Americans for Freedom, a
large national organization with
headquarters in Washington, D.C.
In 1969 a split occurred between
"libertarians" and "traditionalists," in
the YAF. Hocker describes
traditionalists as "sort of Spiro
Agnew-type conservatives."

The big split came when the
libertarians became upset during the
1969 elections of the YAF council. The
incumbent YAF 10-man council,
traditionalists, had presented a list of
hand-picked successors. Hocker termed
this the faction's "way of perpetuating
itself." He said there was "total
disregard for the libertarian faction,
which was a substantial minority."
Hocker noted that four months
before the split, the Stanford chapter
had been voted the best YAF chapter
in the country.
War Analyzed
Hocker elaborated on his
interpretation of libertarian views. "If a
libertarian doesn't smoke grass himself,
he will certainly grant your right to
smoke it. . . libertarians were always
anti-draft." Libertarians stress complete
laissez-faire government.
About the war in Vietnam, Hocker
said, "To go in and just stop
Communism because it's
Communism—well it's been proven as a
little silly, even just in terms of
practical results." He described

libertarianism as fighting Communism
on an intellectual level.
There are about "15 regulars and 15
irregulars" in the Stanford FCM, plus a
"sizable silent group." Hocker cites
harassment as the reason the FCM is
not larger. "People got tired of all the
shit they had to put up with."
Another libertarian approach is
illustrated by the Radical Libertarian
Alliance. The RLA was formed
partially from disenchanted members
of the YAF and the Students for a
Democratic Society (SDS).
The RLA has no officers and the
Stanford chapter consists of only about
10 members.
More Organizations
The Society for Individual Liberty
(SIL) was also a product of the YAF
split that produced the RLA. RLA
member Bill Evers, a writer for both
the Daily and Chaparral, feels the
"Stanford RLA should really be an SIL
chapter" because most members agree
more with the SIL position. There is no
SIL chapter at Stanford yet, but one is
being formed. The contemplated
Stanford SIL would be an organization
of conscious, activist libertarians, some
of whom would come from RLA.
Stanford RLA has been mainly a
discussion group.
Both the RLA and the SIL are
individualist anarchist organizations.
However, it sees little difficulty in
working with communitarian anarchists
like David Harris, former ASSU
President. Communitarian anarchists
believe that individuality can really be
expressed only in freely-formed
communes. The RLA sees itself both as
part of the national libertarian
movement and as part of the New Left.
SIL, on the other hand, believes in
only one correct kind of anarchism, in
accordance with the following
principles: one should have a complete
and total social theory, believe in
laissez-faire economics, believe in
rationalist psychology, believe in
Aristotelian-Thomist epistemology (the
belief that one can know reality with
his own mind), believe in Nietzscheian
hero-worship (admiration of
outstanding, independent individuals),
and believe in the natural law of theory
of justice ("all men have natural rights
to life, liberty, and pursuit of
happiness").
SIL, formed from the libertarian
caucus of YAF and the Society for
Rational Individualism, has
approximately 2,000 paying members.


BURNING ISSUE -Members of the former Stanford chapter of the Young Americans for Freedom burni their YAF. c »<Js ata
1 969 press conference to announce their split with the national organization and the formation of the libertarian Free
Campus Movement.
RLA is basically disorganized, with a
maximum of 200 members nationwide.
Ideals Expressed
Each RLA member is independent
as long as he agrees with the statement
of principles listed on the RLA
membership card: "(1) That individuals
must be free to organize their lives, and
the forms of their communities and
societies on whatever voluntary bases
they choose;
"—(2) That any attempt to
introduce violence into social
relationships is a crime committed
against each one of us: the ruling class
and their states murder, tyrannize and
loot us in order to maintain their
predatory position of privilege; thus the
state and its tentacles of power
constitute the major criminal element
in society today—it must be isolated
and destroyed; alternate institutions
can respond to all the needs and
life-styles of the people;
"—3 That as revolutionaries, we
reject mere parliamentary reformism;
we reject power-plays that always

substitute one state tyranny for
another: political power must be
decentralized and ultimately abolished,
not seized; we must take control over
our own lives.
We are truly enemies of the state!"
The SIL will accept members who
are not anarchists if they believe in a
miniscule government. The RLA is
blatantly anarchistic.
The RLA publishes a newsletter, has
marched in anti-war demonstrations,
and has engaged in "general
propaganda." RLA chapters exchange
information and all receive the
newsletter.
Ayn Rand Influence
The SIL grew faster than the RLA
because there were many disaffected
members of the Ayn Rand objectivist
movement, based on the writings of
novelist Ayn Rand, who believes in a
Constitutional Republic of limited
powers. Rand's "night watchman
state," is a state limited to adjudicating
disputes, protecting persons and
property, and providing military
defense against invasion from other
countries.

The SIL was built out of that
residual leadership. Differences arose
with Ayn Rand because some followers
decided that her philosophic system led
to an anarchist position, which she
doesn't support. Since she demands
total agreement within her following,
people broke with her in favor of the
SIL, but retained a strong Ayn Rand
influence.
The RLA agrees with Venceremos'
positions of opposition to gun control
and any U.S. military intervention. The
RLA doesn't feel that Venceremos is as
great a threat as the U.S. government
because Venceremos isn't in power.
The RLA is separate from the FCM
because the FCM "perceives radicals as
a threat to them." The RLA doesn't see
the FCM as being ideologically
consistent and doesn't like the FCM's
practical politics which RLA members
feel are largely in support of the police,
or whatever the police do. As Evers put
it, "there's sort of a gut feeling (in the
FCM) that if the radicals are doing
something, it must be wrong."

Party and the Young Republicans.)
