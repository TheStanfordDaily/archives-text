# Readership Survey
## 
### 
In an attempt to better respond to the wishes of our
readers, some members of the Daily staff conducted a
survey of the readership of the Daily last spring (see story
on page 1). We are both encouraged and disappointed with
the results.
We are encouraged because of the high readership of the
newspaper and because the Daily is the main source of news
of the Stanford campus. We are disappointed because some
readers are so dissatisfied with some of the things we are
doing. But it didn't take a survey to make us realize we had
problems. It did, however, help us to pinpoint particular
areas of dissatisfaction and enable us to act on them.
It should be remembered that last spring, when the
survey was conducted, the Daily was engaged in a massive
austerity program-designed to improve the paper's bleak
financial picture. Since then, our financial status has
improved greatly, but we are still strapped with a $10,000
debt to pay, and unable to make all the improvements we
would like.
We have already attacked some of the problems
mentioned prominently in the report, and are making
progress in our attempt to improve the paper.
Specifically:
1. We have increased the size of the newspaper from an average last
spring of 5.2 pages per issue to 7.5 this quarter and have reduced the
proportion of ads accordingly.
2. We have greatly expanded our entertainment section, and
Tuesday began running a full schedule of entertainment events in the
Bay Area oriented specifically for the Stanford community.
3. In response to the high readership of the AP News Summary, we
have expanded the section and attempt to run a maximum of national
and international news each day.
4. In response to complaints that students and staff cannot find
copies of the Daily to read, we have increased the number of issues we
are printing from 12,000 last spring to 1 5,000 this fall.
5. Since many people enjoy reading the "Today in the Daily" box,
we have made it a policy to run that feature every day unless
impossible for space reasons.
6. We have become even more conscious of our problem of
left-political bias on the Opinion page and are constantly seeking guest
columns to balance the predominant views submitted to us.
Publishing a newspaper for a college community is not an
easy task. Being surrounded by a society of critical experts
(or those who believe they are experts) on nearly every
subject is a challenge few professional papers must face. It is
one which we enjoy.
There is no doubt that readers will continue to let us
know when they are dissatisfied with the Daily; it is our
policy to print as many letters to the editor-critical or
not—that we possibly can.
Oftentimes, when we do things right, the letters slack
off.
We encourage all Daily readers to keep us informed not
only of your opinions about the paper, but also concerning
events and ideas you would like to see covered by the Daily.
Only through feedback from the readership can we continue
to improve our service to the community.

of the Stanford campus. We are disappointed because some
readers are so dissatisfied with some of the things we are
doing. But it didn't take a survey to make us realize we had
problems. It did, however, help us to pinpoint particular
areas of dissatisfaction and enable us to act on them.
It should be remembered that last spring, when the
survey was conducted, the Daily was engaged in a massive
austerity program-designed to improve the paper's bleak
financial picture. Since then, our financial status has
improved greatly, but we are still strapped with a $10,000
debt to pay, and unable to make all the improvements we
would like.
We have already attacked some of the problems
mentioned prominently in the report, and are making
progress in our attempt to improve the paper.
Specifically:
1. We have increased the size of the newspaper from an average last
spring of 5.2 pages per issue to 7.5 this quarter and have reduced the
proportion of ads accordingly.
2. We have greatly expanded our entertainment section, and
Tuesday began running a full schedule of entertainment events in the
Bay Area oriented specifically for the Stanford community.
3. In response to the high readership of the AP News Summary, we
have expanded the section and attempt to run a maximum of national
and international news each day.
4. In response to complaints that students and staff cannot find
copies of the Daily to read, we have increased the number of issues we
are printing from 12,000 last spring to 1 5,000 this fall.
5. Since many people enjoy reading the "Today in the Daily" box,
we have made it a policy to run that feature every day unless
impossible for space reasons.
6. We have become even more conscious of our problem of
left-political bias on the Opinion page and are constantly seeking guest
columns to balance the predominant views submitted to us.
Publishing a newspaper for a college community is not an
easy task. Being surrounded by a society of critical experts
(or those who believe they are experts) on nearly every
subject is a challenge few professional papers must face. It is
one which we enjoy.
There is no doubt that readers will continue to let us
know when they are dissatisfied with the Daily; it is our
policy to print as many letters to the editor-critical or
not—that we possibly can.
Oftentimes, when we do things right, the letters slack
off.
We encourage all Daily readers to keep us informed not
only of your opinions about the paper, but also concerning
events and ideas you would like to see covered by the Daily.
Only through feedback from the readership can we continue
to improve our service to the community.
In an attempt to better respond to the wishes of our
readers, some members of the Daily staff conducted a
survey of the readership of the Daily last spring (see story
on page 1). We are both encouraged and disappointed with
the results.
We are encouraged because of the high readership of the
newspaper and because the Daily is the main source of news
of the Stanford campus. We are disappointed because some
readers are so dissatisfied with some of the things we are
doing. But it didn't take a survey to make us realize we had
