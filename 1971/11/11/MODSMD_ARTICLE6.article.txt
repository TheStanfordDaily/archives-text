Farcical, one man elections in
Vietnam didn't disturb the Nixon
administration. Their widespread
public recognition did.
Similarly rigged elections in the
oil-rich U.S.-supported military
state of Indonesia passed by the
public eye this summer almost
unnoticed. That these elections
could be passed off as indications
of democracy in U.S. colonies,
that repressive control over the
elections was kept from public
view is an indication of how well
the U.S. government can do in
controlling third world countries,
if it works at it.
The U.S. has done a sloppy job
in Vietnam. By its own standards,
it has done a relatively good one
in Indonesia.
"With its 100 million people
and its 3,000 mile arc of islands,
containing the region's richest
hoard of natural resources,
Indonesia constitutes the greatest
prize in the S.E. Asian
area."â€”Richard Nixon, Foreign
Affairs, October 1967.
Indonesian natural resources
have long been coveted by
Americans, especially since the
development of the Sumatran oil
fields in the fourties.
Through the fifties, the U.S.
worked to undermine Sukarno's
independent brand of nationalism
by training a pro-American elite.
Credit goes largely to the Ford
Foundation. Through MIT and
Cornell Ford sent field staff to
Indonesia who "made contacts,
collected data and built up
expertise." Through Berkeley,
Ford-funded programs brought
sympathetic Indonesian
technocrats to the U.S. for
training.
In late September 1965, in
response to an attempted coup,
US-sympathetic groups within the
ruling elite brutally destroyed
their massive organized
opposition. Contrary to reports
commonly carried in the Western
press blaming the powerful
communist party, the coup which
percipitated the bloody slaughter
was itself largely an internal army
affair. The killings which followed
were far more.
They represented long
smoldering class conflicts resulting
in particular from the growing
threat of an organized peasantry.
Unleashed class tensions resulted
in the murder of some 500,000
largely lower class people. Upon
this base, a U.S. supported
alliance of generals and
technocrats began to build its
regime.
Following Sukarno's official
fall from power in 1937, the
Suharto regime began to speak of
the need to formalize its position
with elections. That met initially
with disapproval by the regime's
advisors from the Ford-funded
Harvard Development Advisory
service, which was tying together
vital threads of the earlier Ford
programs in Indonesia.
When DAS did accept the idea
of elections, it began to work
particularly hard to assure that
the necessary people and

programs were on hand to win the
elections. By June 1968, the new
regime had appointed a
"development cabinet" with a
high representation of
ford-trained technocrats.

DAS had now began to express
a desire to phase more technocrats
in and phase more of the less
compliant military out. Although
prepared for trouble, they began
to see> the elections as a way to do
this.
In order to assure at least the
appearance of a democratic
election, the Suharto government
created the "non-political political
party", Golongan Karva (the
officials' group). Golkar was to be
made up of all groups which
supported the pro-Western
development of the government.
The government line was that
economic development is
non-political.

The badly lopsided nature of
the current development plan,
however, opening wide doors for
foreign investment and control,
belies that assumtpion. Efforts by
other political parties to gain

power were viewed not as a threat
to the regime, but as a threat to
"development" and economic
stability.
More important, the
government hardly assumed that
people would of their own free
will accept political non-politics.
Golkar was created, in fact, as a
fake front for intimidation and
repression. With memories of the
coup strong in people's minds the
press daily reported new arrests of
"communist remnants," a
constant reminder of government
treatment of opposition forces.
Papers also ran commentaries
of the numbers of people barred
from running or voting for

suspected former communist ties.
Several million people were
included in this vague category, in
addition to those openly charged
with communist ties. All voters
and candidates regardless of their
party had to be approved by the
government.
As the elections drew closer,
intimidation began to take on
more serious tones. Opposition
newspapers were supressed. A
prominent nationalist party leader
was sent out of the country for
"health reasons," another
mysteriously died of a heart
attack. Amir Machmud, home
minister and one of the brains
behind Golkar, admitted that
Golkar had played a part in
aggrevating tensions within other
parties. Said Machmud,
"Intimidation is a natural
phenomena in campaign
struggles."
No opposition went
unscrutinized. No one's political
views were secret. Voting was
mandatory and particularly in
lower class and rural areas, people
were issued voting ultimatums.
Since even ballots in the
government offices were
sometimes marked, there were
few illusions about the privacy of
one's vote. It came as no surprise

then that Golkar not only won
the elections but won them by as
high as 90 or 95% in opposition
strongholds.
Thus the Harvard DAS has won
its elections. By mid-September,
with his control reassured,
Suharto began reshuffling the
cabinet, easing out of power
military figures in particular and
putting in their places members of
the elite DAS-backed group. All
of the major economic ministries
are now in the hands of this
special "development" group,
assuring a rosy future for US
development plans in Indonesia at
the higest levels.
The victory of the
non-political political party was
not that of a political magician,
but rather that of a highly
integrated economic and political
strategy. American imperialism
doesn't often lay bare its
contradicitons the way it has in
Indochina. Yet they are
essentially the same for Indonesia
and Vietnam, and the ease with
which DAS won its Indonesian
elections should not abscure that
fact.
