# photoemission vs military need
## Off All Basic Research? 
### 
*William e. spicer

Over the last eight years my
students and I have pioneered the
use of photoemission to
investigate the electronic structure
of solids. This work is supported
by the National Science
Foundation (NSF), NASA, and
the Department of Defense
(DOD).
Photoemission has been used
for over fifty years in practical
devices for detecting light. Among
such devices are the camera tubes
used in most television studios,
the photomultipliers used in
Electric eyes and at SLAC for
fundamental experiments in
particle physics; and in night
vision devices by most military
forces in the world.
The night vision devices used
by the American military depend
upon the material [Cs]Na 2 KSb
for photoemission. Similar devices
with this material are used by
astronomers and in
photomultipliers. Experiments
have never been carried out in my
laboratory at Stanford on this
night vision material.
I was approached by an Army
scientist to do this in 1964 and
1965 but turned them down
because I did not think that the
nature of this work was proper for
the education of PhD candidates.
I believe that a most important
consideration in choosing research
projects is their potential to
develop the student. Thw work on
[Cs]Na 2 KSb photocathodes did

not meet these criteria.
Another very important criteria
for evaluating the suitability of
research support at the University
is that it not hinder publication or
open decision even with
communist countries. No contract
which would have reduced
scientific communication would
have been acceptable to me in
1964 or today. Today, University
regulations prevent any such
restrictions. This is very
important.
If research has immediate
military applications, the DOD
attempts to protect its priority by
placing restrictions on the
freedom with which the research
workers can discuss it with others.
If no such restrictions are allowed
by Stanford, it is highly unlikely
that the research done at Stanford
has immediate military
applications, even if it is
supported by the DOD.
Let me say more about the
work going on in my laboratory.
We shine light on solids. The light
excites electrons which escape
from the solid into vacuum where
their energy is measured. Knowing
this energy as well as the energy
of the exciting light, we can
deduce the energy of the electrons
in the solid before excitation. We
then attempt to relate this
information to a wide range of
properties in the solid.
The indictment against this
work by the "yÂ° un g crows" is

that it might lead to improved
night vision devices. Presumably,
thf> logic is that, since we are using
photoemission for basic studies of
amorphous semiconductors and
transition metals, and since
photoemission is used in night
vision devices, we are working to
make improved night vision
devices. The logic, as weak as it is,
can equally well be applied to the
work support by NSF and NASA.
In this work, we are also using
photoemission to study the
electronic structure of solids.
Why then does the DOD
support this and other
fundamental work? The reasons
are both political and historic.
During the emergencies of World
War 11, it became apparent that
strong scientific knowledge and
ability were essential to national
survival. Because of this
realization the DOD, after World
War 11, set up agencies whose
main function was to identify and
support basic research in areas
where the lack of fundamental
understanding allows for only the
most hazy forecaset of possible
applications. Because.of the broad
nature of this research, civilian
applications are often more likely
than military applications.
This trend of funding
fundamental work through
military agencies has been
strongly reinforced by a
congressional willingness to
support such funding. This has
been essential to the support of
research since Congress has never
given sufficient fundamental
support through agencies such as

the National Science Foundation.
The Mansfield Amendment
which was attached to the 1970
DOD appropriation bill was an
angry break with this tradition.
The amendment stated that DOD
funding should go only to work
which had a clear military
application. This amendment was
difficult to interpret because of
the question of judgment and
time scale involved in saying what
was a clear military appliation. In
any case, it's only teeth lay in
Congress's threat to withhold
funds the following year if their
directives were not carried out.
Last year, the corresponding
amendment made it clear that the
support of basic work in areas
which might be of interest to the
DOD was acceptable. Thus, the
Mansfield Amendment was
effectively repelled.
Where does all of this leave
Stanford and its position on DOD
research? Stanford now has rules
that make sure that nothing in a
contract can restrict the flow of
information from the research at
Stanford. This effectively prevents
the DOD from supporting any
work which will not be available
to the USSR, China, or North
Vietnam as well as itself. I can't
think of a more effective way to
limit work at Stanford on true
weapons research. The logical
alternative is to allow no scientific
research at Stanford since any
basic work may have military
application sometime in the
distant future.
