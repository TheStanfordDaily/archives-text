## Apply Minimal Standards 
### 
Robert a. packenham

It is important to emphasize
the substance of the remarks of
Professor Herbert Packer in his
letter to the Daily on Friday,
November 5. As he noted, the
issue in the Franklin case is not
Vietnam or university complicity
in the war; it is whether, in
Packer's apt paraphrase of the
University's charges, Professor
Franklin incited "students and
others to perform acts
inconsistent with the minimal
obligations of membership in an
academic community," and
whether Professor Franklin
himself performed such acts.
These charges have nothing
whatever to do with free speech,
or protest against the war, or
protest against any other social ill.
If this were the University's aim,
it would have moved against
Professor Franklin long ago, for
he has been exercising his rights of
free speech and protest for years.
The charges have rather to do
with alleged violations of the
absolutely essential requisites for
any university that wishes to
remain worthy of the name or for
that matter for any process of free
inquiry.
The notion that membership in
an academic community imposes
minimal obligations may come
hard these days, but a moment's
reflection reveals how true and
essential this notion is. For
instance, a professor who
preached that all students should
cheat and plagiarize on papers and
exams and who himself did so
clearly would not be fit for an
academic position.
Such a professor would have to
be removed from his post no
matter what his other virtues and
accomplishments, no matter what
justification he used to rationalize
his pronouncements, and even if it
was not possible to demonstrate
that his statements had a clear
casual relationship to the actions
of his students Similarly, a
professor who could be shown to
have passed or failed students on
the basis of their race or religion,
or whether they paid him money,
or whether they delivered votes to
him in an election, would also be
acting in ways inconsistent with
the minimal obligations of
membership in an academic
community. He would have to be
dismissed. This also would hold
no matter what moral principle or
political injustice the accused
might appeal to in order to justify
his acitons.
Obviously, Professor Franklin's

behavior is not so clearly in
violation of the minimal
obligations of a faculty member;
nor is such a claim made here.
That is not the point of the
illustrations. The point is that
there are modes of behavior which
are intolerable in a university
community, which in and of
themselves are corrosive to the
search for truth and for learning,
and which if left unchecked can
destroy the university as a place
decicated to the ideal of free and
honest inquiry. Anyone who
engages in these modes of
behavior no longer satisfies the
minimal criteria for membership
in the community. No matter
what his other virtues, such a
person has to be dismissed.
Now, removal of a tenured
faculty member on these grounds
is, to put it mildly, a grave matter.
Moveover, the question of what
constitutes unacceptable behavior
is not easy. The standards are not
precise (nor in the nature of the
case can they be, although one
wishes they were sharper than
they appear to be). These are
among the reasons why the
Advisory Board's job is so
difficult.
But none of this obviates the
points made earlier. Nor does the
imprecision of the "minimal
obligation" standard render it
completely invalid. There is a
danger that the criteria in this and
similar cases are or will be too
vague or for some other reason
inappropriate. This danger is
well-known in the Stanford
community. But refusal to apply a
standard when it needs to be
applied can also be very dangerous
and corrosive.
This second danger has been
perhaps less well understood in
the community during the
hearings.
Moreover, it is worth noting
that while defining a proper
standard is difficult and poses
tough dilemmas, still we are all
familiar with roughly comparable
standards which are used and
accepted almost every day by a
great many people. "Due process
of law" and "clear and present
danger" are two examples of

comparable standards I find
useful, even essential.
So it would
seem impossible to reject the
"minimal obligation" principle
simply because it is not precise
enough.
The foregoing comments relate
only to the principles involved in
the Franklin case; they do not
deal with the specific standard to
be applied or with the facts in the
case. Therefore nothing said so far
pre-judges Professor Franklin
(although my personal opinion, if
anyone cares and just to be candid
about it, is that he probably
should be dismissed).
Whether he did in fact commit
the alleged acts; the precise nature
of the standard that is applicable
in this case; and the penalty, if
anyâ€”all these are matters for the
Advisory Board to decide and
make recommendations about to
the president.
As for the Board, any
reasonable man observing the

hearings carefully and honestly
would have to conclude, it seems
to me, that Professor Franklin
received as fair a hearing as it is
reasonably possible to expect
mere mortals to provide. No other
persons are in as good a position
to make a just decision in this case
as those seven men. No matter
what the Board does, its members
surely deserve the strong support
of the entire Stanford community
and the most serious respect for
their decisions.
Professor Franklin in his
defense, and many of his
supporters, have tried to obscure
these elemental facts. They have
had, one infers, considerable
success in their efforts. Such
efforts may be understandable;
that does not make them right.
That is why it is important to
underscore the remarks made by
Professor Packer.

is, to put it mildly, a grave matter.
Moveover, the question of what
constitutes unacceptable behavior
is not easy. The standards are not
precise (nor in the nature of the
case can they be, although one
wishes they were sharper than
they appear to be). These are
among the reasons why the
Advisory Board's job is so
difficult.
But none of this obviates the
points made earlier. Nor does the
imprecision of the "minimal
obligation" standard render it
completely invalid. There is a
danger that the criteria in this and
similar cases are or will be too
vague or for some other reason
inappropriate. This danger is
well-known in the Stanford
community. But refusal to apply a
standard when it needs to be
applied can also be very dangerous
and corrosive.
This second danger has been
perhaps less well understood in
the community during the
hearings.
Moreover, it is worth noting
that while defining a proper
standard is difficult and poses
tough dilemmas, still we are all
familiar with roughly comparable
standards which are used and
accepted almost every day by a
great many people. "Due process
of law" and "clear and present
danger" are two examples of

comparable standards I find
useful, even essential.
So it would
seem impossible to reject the
"minimal obligation" principle
simply because it is not precise
enough.
The foregoing comments relate
only to the principles involved in
the Franklin case; they do not
deal with the specific standard to
be applied or with the facts in the
case. Therefore nothing said so far
pre-judges Professor Franklin
(although my personal opinion, if
anyone cares and just to be candid
about it, is that he probably
should be dismissed).
Whether he did in fact commit
the alleged acts; the precise nature
of the standard that is applicable
in this case; and the penalty, if
anyâ€”all these are matters for the
Advisory Board to decide and
make recommendations about to
the president.
As for the Board, any
reasonable man observing the

hearings carefully and honestly
would have to conclude, it seems
to me, that Professor Franklin
received as fair a hearing as it is
reasonably possible to expect
mere mortals to provide. No other
persons are in as good a position
to make a just decision in this case
as those seven men. No matter
what the Board does, its members
surely deserve the strong support
of the entire Stanford community
and the most serious respect for
their decisions.
Professor Franklin in his
defense, and many of his
supporters, have tried to obscure
these elemental facts. They have
had, one infers, considerable
success in their efforts. Such
efforts may be understandable;
that does not make them right.
That is why it is important to
underscore the remarks made by
Professor Packer.

It is important to emphasize
the substance of the remarks of
Professor Herbert Packer in his
letter to the Daily on Friday,
November 5. As he noted, the
issue in the Franklin case is not
Vietnam or university complicity
in the war; it is whether, in
Packer's apt paraphrase of the
University's charges, Professor
Franklin incited "students and
others to perform acts
inconsistent with the minimal
obligations of membership in an
academic community," and
whether Professor Franklin
himself performed such acts.
These charges have nothing
whatever to do with free speech,
or protest against the war, or
protest against any other social ill.
If this were the University's aim,
it would have moved against
Professor Franklin long ago, for
he has been exercising his rights of
free speech and protest for years.
The charges have rather to do
with alleged violations of the
absolutely essential requisites for
any university that wishes to
remain worthy of the name or for
that matter for any process of free
inquiry.
The notion that membership in
an academic community imposes
minimal obligations may come
hard these days, but a moment's
reflection reveals how true and
essential this notion is. For
instance, a professor who
preached that all students should
cheat and plagiarize on papers and
exams and who himself did so
clearly would not be fit for an
academic position.
Such a professor would have to
be removed from his post no
matter what his other virtues and
accomplishments, no matter what
justification he used to rationalize
his pronouncements, and even if it
was not possible to demonstrate
that his statements had a clear
casual relationship to the actions
of his students Similarly, a
professor who could be shown to
have passed or failed students on
the basis of their race or religion,
or whether they paid him money,
or whether they delivered votes to
him in an election, would also be
acting in ways inconsistent with
the minimal obligations of
membership in an academic
community. He would have to be
dismissed. This also would hold
no matter what moral principle or
political injustice the accused
might appeal to in order to justify
his acitons.
Obviously, Professor Franklin's

behavior is not so clearly in
violation of the minimal
obligations of a faculty member;
nor is such a claim made here.
That is not the point of the
illustrations. The point is that
there are modes of behavior which
are intolerable in a university
community, which in and of
themselves are corrosive to the
search for truth and for learning,
and which if left unchecked can
destroy the university as a place
decicated to the ideal of free and
honest inquiry. Anyone who
engages in these modes of
behavior no longer satisfies the
minimal criteria for membership
in the community. No matter
what his other virtues, such a
person has to be dismissed.
Now, removal of a tenured

It is important to emphasize
the substance of the remarks of
Professor Herbert Packer in his
letter to the Daily on Friday,
November 5. As he noted, the
issue in the Franklin case is not
Vietnam or university complicity
in the war; it is whether, in
Packer's apt paraphrase of the
University's charges, Professor
Franklin incited "students and
others to perform acts
inconsistent with the minimal
obligations of membership in an
academic community," and
whether Professor Franklin
himself performed such acts.
These charges have nothing
whatever to do with free speech,
or protest against the war, or
protest against any other social ill.
If this were the University's aim,
it would have moved against
Professor Franklin long ago, for
he has been exercising his rights of
free speech and protest for years.
The charges have rather to do
with alleged violations of the
absolutely essential requisites for
any university that wishes to
remain worthy of the name or for
that matter for any process of free
inquiry.
The notion that membership in
an academic community imposes
minimal obligations may come
hard these days, but a moment's
reflection reveals how true and
essential this notion is. For
instance, a professor who
preached that all students should
cheat and plagiarize on papers and
exams and who himself did so
clearly would not be fit for an
academic position.
Such a professor would have to
be removed from his post no
matter what his other virtues and
accomplishments, no matter what
justification he used to rationalize
his pronouncements, and even if it
was not possible to demonstrate
that his statements had a clear
casual relationship to the actions
of his students Similarly, a
professor who could be shown to
have passed or failed students on
the basis of their race or religion,
or whether they paid him money,
or whether they delivered votes to
him in an election, would also be
acting in ways inconsistent with
the minimal obligations of
membership in an academic
community. He would have to be
dismissed. This also would hold
no matter what moral principle or
political injustice the accused
might appeal to in order to justify
his acitons.
Obviously, Professor Franklin's

behavior is not so clearly in
violation of the minimal
obligations of a faculty member;
nor is such a claim made here.
That is not the point of the
illustrations. The point is that
there are modes of behavior which
are intolerable in a university
community, which in and of
themselves are corrosive to the
search for truth and for learning,
and which if left unchecked can
destroy the university as a place
decicated to the ideal of free and
honest inquiry. Anyone who
engages in these modes of
behavior no longer satisfies the
minimal criteria for membership
in the community. No matter
what his other virtues, such a
person has to be dismissed.
Now, removal of a tenured
faculty member on these grounds
is, to put it mildly, a grave matter.
Moveover, the question of what
constitutes unacceptable behavior
is not easy. The standards are not
precise (nor in the nature of the
case can they be, although one
wishes they were sharper than
they appear to be). These are
among the reasons why the
Advisory Board's job is so
difficult.
But none of this obviates the
points made earlier. Nor does the
imprecision of the "minimal
obligation" standard render it
completely invalid. There is a
danger that the criteria in this and
similar cases are or will be too
vague or for some other reason
inappropriate. This danger is
well-known in the Stanford
community. But refusal to apply a
standard when it needs to be
applied can also be very dangerous
and corrosive.
This second danger has been
perhaps less well understood in
the community during the
hearings.
Moreover, it is worth noting
that while defining a proper
standard is difficult and poses
tough dilemmas, still we are all
familiar with roughly comparable
standards which are used and
accepted almost every day by a
great many people. "Due process
of law" and "clear and present
danger" are two examples of

comparable standards I find
useful, even essential.
So it would
seem impossible to reject the
"minimal obligation" principle
simply because it is not precise
enough.
The foregoing comments relate
only to the principles involved in
the Franklin case; they do not
deal with the specific standard to
be applied or with the facts in the
case. Therefore nothing said so far
pre-judges Professor Franklin
(although my personal opinion, if
anyone cares and just to be candid
about it, is that he probably
should be dismissed).
Whether he did in fact commit
the alleged acts; the precise nature
of the standard that is applicable
in this case; and the penalty, if
anyâ€”all these are matters for the
Advisory Board to decide and
make recommendations about to
the president.
As for the Board, any
reasonable man observing the

hearings carefully and honestly
would have to conclude, it seems
to me, that Professor Franklin
received as fair a hearing as it is
reasonably possible to expect
mere mortals to provide. No other
persons are in as good a position
to make a just decision in this case
as those seven men. No matter
what the Board does, its members
surely deserve the strong support
of the entire Stanford community
and the most serious respect for
their decisions.
Professor Franklin in his
defense, and many of his
supporters, have tried to obscure
these elemental facts. They have
had, one infers, considerable
success in their efforts. Such
efforts may be understandable;
that does not make them right.
That is why it is important to
underscore the remarks made by
Professor Packer.
