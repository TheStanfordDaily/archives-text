in the opinion of the Secretary of Defense, a
potential relationship to a military function or

view must be precisely that which had always
been taken by any reasonable DOD
administrator, even before Congress enunciated
it. We shall return to this matter of objectives
later.
Second, in your Vol. I, much effort went into
investigating each Principal Investigator's
perception of his research, but very little went
into exploring that of the companion sponsor.
Only the government DDC statements served as
an information base for the latter "perception."
When one recalls that the DDC statements were
prepared at various times, by a variety of
contract monitors, under a variety of agency
policies, and for a variety of purposes, the value
of the database is limited to say the least. For
example, one agency has used substantially the
same descriptive material for four different
projects guided by four different principal
investigators, two each in two separate Schools.
We wonder how reasonable it is to probe that
"perception" of University research deeply. It
seems a little unfair, too, to explore deeply the
meaning and intent of sponsor project "titles"
which in many instances were sequential
arrangements of key words appropriate for use in
an automatic data retrieval system.
Another point relevant to the DDC
statements, project titles and even the continued
existence of a project's support at Stanford, and
the short-term effects on them of the Mansfield
Amendment, is the "time-to-application" of
basic research. By their nature, university
researchers in science and engineering undertake
primarily long-term basic projects, not the
production of hardware. The development from
idea to practical application takes typically ten
years or more. Thus, the Mansfield Amendment
forced speculation on the applications (perhaps
10 years distant) of DOD-sponsored projects.
Given the differences in perspective of DOD
monitors and faculty and the uncertainty of
p ediction of even the short-term future progress
of research on any idea, it is not surprising (a)
that differences occur between faculty and DOD
"perceptions" and (b) that the Mansfield
Amendment was opposed by DOD (SWOPSI
Report, Vol. I, pp. 29 and 33 ).
Before moving to broader questions, let us
refer again specifically to Vol. I and what it tells
us about the nature of DOD and the process by
which faculty get research contracts and grants.
It is an inescapable conclusion of the section
"How the Faculty Members Obtain Grants and
Contracts" that, in virtually all cases, the
initiation of the proposal for support is by the
in the opinion of the Secretary of Defense, a
potential relationship to a military function or
operation." We would presume that this latter
view must be precisely that which had always

"How the Faculty Members Obtain Grants and
Contracts" that, in virtually all cases, the
initiation of the proposal for support is by the
in the opinion of the Secretary of Defense, a
potential relationship to a military function or
operation." We would presume that this latter
view must be precisely that which had always
been taken by any reasonable DOD
administrator, even before Congress enunciated
it. We shall return to this matter of objectives
later.
Second, in your Vol. I, much effort went into
investigating each Principal Investigator's
perception of his research, but very little went
into exploring that of the companion sponsor.
Only the government DDC statements served as
an information base for the latter "perception."
When one recalls that the DDC statements were
prepared at various times, by a variety of
contract monitors, under a variety of agency
policies, and for a variety of purposes, the value
of the database is limited to say the least. For
example, one agency has used substantially the
same descriptive material for four different
projects guided by four different principal
investigators, two each in two separate Schools.
We wonder how reasonable it is to probe that
"perception" of University research deeply. It
seems a little unfair, too, to explore deeply the
meaning and intent of sponsor project "titles"
which in many instances were sequential
arrangements of key words appropriate for use in
an automatic data retrieval system.
Another point relevant to the DDC
statements, project titles and even the continued
existence of a project's support at Stanford, and
the short-term effects on them of the Mansfield
Amendment, is the "time-to-application" of
basic research. By their nature, university
researchers in science and engineering undertake
primarily long-term basic projects, not the
production of hardware. The development from
idea to practical application takes typically ten
years or more. Thus, the Mansfield Amendment
forced speculation on the applications (perhaps
10 years distant) of DOD-sponsored projects.
Given the differences in perspective of DOD
monitors and faculty and the uncertainty of
p ediction of even the short-term future progress
of research on any idea, it is not surprising (a)
that differences occur between faculty and DOD
"perceptions" and (b) that the Mansfield
Amendment was opposed by DOD (SWOPSI
Report, Vol. I, pp. 29 and 33 ).
Before moving to broader questions, let us
refer again specifically to Vol. I and what it tells
us about the nature of DOD and the process by
which faculty get research contracts and grants.
It is an inescapable conclusion of the section
"How the Faculty Members Obtain Grants and
Contracts" that, in virtually all cases, the
initiation of the proposal for support is by the
