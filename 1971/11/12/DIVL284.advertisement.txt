Joseph M. Pettit, Dean of the School of
Engineering, and Professor Robert L. Street,
associate dean for research, have prepared
detailed comments relative to DOD sponsored
research at Stanford and made them available to
the Stanford community.
Dean Pettit received a letter from Stanton
Glantz, a graduate student in applied mechanics
and a member of the committee on research on
the Academic Council, in which he requested
comments on the SWOPSI book, D.O.D.
Sponsored Research at Stanford, Vol. 1.
The dean and Professor Street said that,
"Because we feel that our reply is of interest to
our colleagues and the Stanford community in
general, we are treating our reply ... as an open
letter
The letter follows:
Dear Mr. Glantz:
We are writing to you in response to your
letter of 4 October 19 71 which requested
comments on the SWOPSI Report, D.O.D.
Sponsored Research at Stanford, Vol. I, and
comments relevant to the analysis of the factual
material in that report. It was claimed last Spring
that Volume I would be aimed at objectivity. For
this reason a great many of our School faculty
provided data for Volume I. It is unfortunate
that the report was launched in a mood of
controversy, with the title "Two Perceptions:
The Investigator's and the Sponsor's." As a result
we find it appropriate to address our comments
to two separate points. The first is the basis and
relevance of the supposed inconsistency in
perceptions; the second is related to a broader
question of the place of sponsored research and
various sponsors in the University.
The context in which the two perceptions of
Volume I are developed is based on the so-called
Mansfield Amendment, that appeared in a Fiscal
Year 1 97 0 Authorization Bill, and on Sections
204 and 205 of the Fiscal Year 1971
Authorization Bill (SWOPSI Report: Vol. I, pp.
29 through 37). In understanding the effect of
these measures one must first account for the
natural differences of perspective, objectives, and
motivations of the three parties involved, viz.,
the university faculty, the various administrators
in DOD and Congressmen. As your historical
outline in Volume I shows, the faculty and DOD
developed research contracts and projects
relatively independent of congressional stricture
from 19 47 through 1969. In 1969, through the
Mansfield Amendment, Congress imposed its
view of DOD research, namely, the research must
have "a direct and apparent relationship to a
specific military function or operation." Of
course, we all know that this view did not long
endure, for in 1970 the law for FY 71 read "has,
