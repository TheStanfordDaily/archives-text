faculty member, and not a result of a request for
a proposal on a specific topic initiated by DOD.
Also, in pages 21 through 29 you make it
abundantly clear that DOD is not a monolithic
agency. Indeed, you say "Only the highest levels
of DOD are unified however," and you quote
Foster as saying ".. .they seek to promote
'university research and teaching, industrial
research and development, and discussion of
national security issues among informed,
experienced and independent individuals' by the
research they support."
Because there is a wide variety of separate,
and often quite independent, sponsor agencies in
DOD (there are 29 identifiable agencies in Vol.
I), those in our faculty who seek DOD support
have great freedom to choose those to which
they will submit proposals. Those agencies who
either by imposition of administrative "red-tape"
or by over-strong guidance of project goals or
directions have made themselves incompatible
with the "university-way" of research are not
sent proposals by our faculty. It is, thus, very
difficult for DOD to exert any single-minded
"direction" of research. In any case it would be
hard for DOD to direct research, should it desire
to, as DOD does not provide a majority of the
University's overall sponsored support (27%
University-wide in the 9-months ending 31 May
1971, excluding SLAC).
With regard to sponsored research in the
University, it is not unfair to say that Stanford is
a research-oriented university and that the
sponsored research expenditures each year of
nearly 50 million dollars support the graduate
programs at Stanford. It is important then to
consider the perceived objectives of the
university and those of the sponsors. We can
think of the perceived objectives of each to be
comprised of a "sphere of collected objectives.
From the university-faculty point of view, their
sphere includes:
a. An intellectual component: This means the
research must represent a genuine contribution
to the sum total of knowledge in the field. As a
by-product of the way we do research, the
research must be of interest to the faculty leader
because faculty participation is voluntary and he
takes the initiative in arranging for the support.
b. An education component: This means that
the research must contribute to the educational
program, most specifically through support of
graduate students who obtain financial support,
equipment, faculty advisers, technician back-up,
and facilities as a direct consequence of the
University's use of research funds. Also, the
results of the work, especially thesis work, must
be freely publishable.
