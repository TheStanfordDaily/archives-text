c. A support component: The sponsored
research must carry its own weight by providing
for direct salaries, staff benefits (student tuition
for example), overhead for the organization that
backs up each investigator, equipment, etc.
The sponsor has another set of objectives or
goals that comprise his sphere. Each sponsor has
a different sphere. For DOD we know their
sphere includes:
a. Support of an up-to-date technology as a
means of preparedness: this means both technical
knowledge and well educated scientists and
engineers.
b. Research leading to applications with a
potential relationship to a military function or
operation (a legal requirement in FY 1971). On
the other hand, an objective of NSF is to initiate
and support scientific research and programs to
strengthen national scientific research potential
(Foreword, Grants for Scientific Research, NSF
69-23 ).
The only requirements of principle that must
be met for the university and a sponsor to get
together and agree on a grant or contract for
research is that their objective spheres intersect
and thus have a minimum common ground. If
the spheres do not intersect no sponsorship is
possible. We have such a case with those DOD
sponsors whose research would necessarily be
classified; here the spheres are mutually exclusive
as the university does not now accept classified
research.
The most important point is that the spheres
never need to be congruent (identical) and in all
probability never are. We simply do not need to
share all the goals of DOD or any other sponsor
to find a common ground upon which a
beneficial relationship can be maintained. If you
consider it further, the sphere of objectives
concept is applicable in many areas, including the
differences between the goals of the university
and donors to the fund drives and, indeed,
between the university and you yourself in your
relationship to Stanford in receiving an
education. We might reasonably presume that
our goals and yours are not congruent, yet your
presence here indicates the existence of the
necessary overlap!
Finally, may we refer you to the Harvard
University "Report of the Committee on Criteria
for Acceptance of Sponsored Research in the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences." The report was
generated as a result of a review of the practices
of that Faculty in accepting externally sponsored
research. Six numbered points, which are closely
aligned with our university's policy statement for
research, form the framework of the report and
