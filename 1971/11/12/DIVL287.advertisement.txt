were approved by the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences on 1 December 19 70 .
The preamble of that report and the
discussions following each of the six points,
though not a part of the formal adoption, were
included to provide a fuller explanation of the
considerations that led to the formulation of the
six points. We commend the report and the six
points to consideration of the Stanford
community. In particular, we find that the
following quoted paragraphs 6,7, and 8 of the
Harvard report preamble, concisely and strongly
reflect our view and the views of many of our
faculty colleagues:
"Our committee subscribes to the principle of
freedom of research as it has been traditionally
interpreted in the University. This principle
establishes the right of the scholar to determine
the subject matter and conclusions and
sponsorship of his own research and protects him
from the imposition on his work of goals or
criteria other than professional ones.
"In discussing the freedom of research it is
important to distinguish between the methods
and techniques of research on the one hand and
the subject matter or conclusions of the research
on the other. The methods of research are clearly
subject to limitations of a variety of sorts. For
example, research techniques which might injure
human health, invade personal privacy without
consent, or which involve unnecessary pain or
suffering to any living things, are already
partially or wholly proscribed by existing
policies. Programs which interfere with the
freedom of research or other scholars by
pre-empting space and facilities, or by involving
the University in future commitments of its
unrestricted funds, cannot be left entirely to the
decision of the scholars participating.
"In contrast with methods, however, the
subject matter of research and the conclusions
reached should be the sole responsibility of the
scholar himself, for which he is answerable to his
scholarly peers only in his individual capacity. If
this freedom sometimes results in research that
some may regard as trivial, shoddy, or wrong, or
in conclusions which others misquote or misuse
for purposes thought undesirable, this is a risk
which must be run, and it appears a lesser evil in
comparison with allowing one segment of the
academic community to impose its own
standards of truth on another."
