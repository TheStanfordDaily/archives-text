# Profs, Mariner Investigate Mars
## 
### CRAIG MOLLOY 
Tomorrow afternoon Mariner 9 will
enter an orbit around Mars and begin a
three month investigation of the planet.
Stanford Nobel Laureate Joshua
Lederberg is one of five principal
investigators conducting the television
experiment, one of six mission
operations.
Because previous "flyby" missions
could observe the planet for only a
short time, Mariner 9 will provide for
the first time a long term study of the
fixed and variable features of the
planet. The fixed feature investigation
will map 70 percent of the Martian
surface in the finest detail yet obtained.
Dr. Elliot Levinthal, director of
Stanford's Genetics Instrumentation
Research Laboratory, is one of four
co-investigators working with
Lederberg. Their primary concern will

be the variable features investigation
which will provide information on
non-periodic, daily and season changes
in the surface and atmosphere.
"The focus of our interest," said
Levinthal, "is looking for variable
features. We've been designing methods
of analyzing data so that surface
changes are made apparent. Much of
this work was done in our Artificial
Intelligence Laboratory by a team
which includes Professor John G.
McCarthy (Computer Science) and
research associates Lynn Quam
(Computer Science) and Robert Tucker
(Genetics)."
Data from the mission will be
analyzed continuously at Stanford and
at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)
in Pasadena, the mission headquarters.
The results will be used to make
recommendations to change mission

planning and operations throughout the
90 day period.
"Our concern is with data that can
affect the mission," Levinthal
explained. "Decisions we make may
change the spacecraft's operations a
few days later.
"We can't anticipate where
something interesting might turn up. If
it does, and we'd like to take a better
look at it, we can change our plans
accordingly."
An interesting development could
involve the "wave of darkening" that
supposedly sweeps Mars in a seasonal
cycle. This long-favored hypothesis
may go the way of "Martian canals,"
whose existence was disproved by
earlier Mariner spacecrafts.
Because the darkening period
apparently coincides with the Martian
spring season, a very attractive

explanation of the phenomenon is an
annual renewal of vegetation. However,
many scientists believe the darkening is
caused by dust storms in the
atmosphere or even changes in optical
geometry (how we look at the planet).
Mariner 9 will arrive at Mars during
the peak of the darkening period (late
spring) in the southern hemisphere.
Since the planet will be observed at
close range for three months, the
mission should settle the question
whether the darkening is on the
surface, in the atmosphere or is indeed
an optical illusion.
An experiment important to
resolving this question is the technique
of radio occultation. Dr. Gunnar
Fjeldbo (now at JPL) and his associates
at Stanford played a leading role in its
development. By measuring changes in
the radio waves transmitted through
the Martian atmosphere by Mariner just
before it passes behind the planet,
precise information about atmospheric
temperature and pressure can be
obtained.
The special interests of the Stanford
team are the biological inferences
drawn from the Mars data. This
information will be especially valuable
for designating prime targets for the
Viking lander that will seek evidence of
life on Mars in 1971.
"We'll be looking at this information
to see what implications it could have
for biological hypotheses about the
planet," Levinthal said. "Generally, we
believe Mars is very hostile to life. The
experiment probably won't provide
direct evidence about thy possibility of
life on the planet, but rather an
indication whether there are ecological
niches which may be hospitable to
biological life."
