aid for the current year,
$480,000, is only the new or
incremental funds being provided
to cushion the impact of this
year's tuition and room and board
increase.
In actual fact, $1,730,795 has
been alloccated by the University
this year for undergraduate
student aid with the largest
proporition going to the
middle-income students. The staff
of this office in consort with
many others in the University
contrinues to seek additional
financial aid resources and
alternative means of funding for
all students.
(Robert P. Huff is the University
Director of Financial Aids.)

Madison Grose's article,
"Middle Class May Suffer from
Financial Pinch", seems to be yet
another effort to blame minority
and poverty level students for the
financial difficulties of
middle-income students. Such a
contention, if this was indeed
what was intended, is not borne
out by the facts and is patently
unfair to students who are in
either or both of those two
categories.
At the present time,
proportionately few
undergraduate students from
low-income families are enrolled
in the University. The number is
at the very most less than 700 and
the total scholarship support of
these students from all sources is
less than 30% of the total
scholarship and grant dollars
currently being received by all
undergraduate students.
It also needs to be known that
approximately 40% of our
freshman minority students
themselves come from
middle-income families and,
hence, face at the very least the
same problems of financing
education as confront
middle-income students generally.
Further, our minority students in
increasing numbers are bringing
with them substantial support
from outside sources, particularly
from the California State

Scholarship Commission and
federal government agencies, like
the Bureau of Indian affairs.
There is absolutely no question
but that serious financial
problems are faced by our
middle-income students but they
should be attributed more
appropraitely to the state of the
economy, under which I would
include inflation and the
uncertain employment status of
scientists, engineers, and other
middle-management personnel,
and a substantial fall-off in gifts
for scholarship purposes in the
face of mounting fees.
This year gifts for scholarship
purposes are down by some 15%,
a fact which results in large
measure from a misconception on
the part of corporations and
foundations that government,
both state and federal, has
pre-empted the area of aid to
students to the point that private
support is no longer needed.
I think, too, that tuition and
other educational expenses have
too often been raised without
being as certain as we should be of
what the consequences would be
for middle-income families. It
seems entirely probable that
conventional forms of student aid
cannot be expected to serve these
families and we may have to seek
alternativers, such as a system of
income tax credits for the

payment of tuition.
There are also two other points
in connection with Mr. Grose's
interview with me which need
clarification. First, lest the
Financial Aids Office be
descended upon by a number of
students from families with
incomes of $35,000 a year who
expect, as a result of reading the
article, that they will not qualify
for financial aid, I want to say
that we are able to do little more
for them at this stage than to
suggest some sources of loan
support and possible means of
employment. Expansion of the
perimeters of middle-income
status have not yet reached
$35,000 a year, although they
have gone well beyond $20,000 a
year incomes.
Lastly, the reporter's
enumeration of one of the ways in
which the undergraduate financial
aid program is attempting to keep
pace with the increased demands
placed upon it needs explanation.
The amount which Mr. Grose
refers to as being contributed
from the general fund for student

aid for the current year,
$480,000, is only the new or
incremental funds being provided
to cushion the impact of this
year's tuition and room and board
increase.

been alloccated by the University
this year for undergraduate

proporition going to the

Director of Financial Aids.)

Madison Grose's article,
"Middle Class May Suffer from
Financial Pinch", seems to be yet
another effort to blame minority
and poverty level students for the
financial difficulties of
middle-income students. Such a
contention, if this was indeed
what was intended, is not borne
out by the facts and is patently
unfair to students who are in
either or both of those two
categories.
At the present time,
proportionately few
undergraduate students from
low-income families are enrolled
in the University. The number is
at the very most less than 700 and
the total scholarship support of
these students from all sources is
less than 30% of the total
scholarship and grant dollars
currently being received by all
undergraduate students.
It also needs to be known that
approximately 40% of our
freshman minority students
themselves come from
middle-income families and,
hence, face at the very least the
same problems of financing
education as confront
middle-income students generally.
Further, our minority students in
increasing numbers are bringing
with them substantial support
from outside sources, particularly
from the California State

Scholarship Commission and
federal government agencies, like
the Bureau of Indian affairs.
There is absolutely no question
but that serious financial
problems are faced by our
middle-income students but they
should be attributed more
appropraitely to the state of the
economy, under which I would
include inflation and the
uncertain employment status of
scientists, engineers, and other
middle-management personnel,
and a substantial fall-off in gifts
for scholarship purposes in the
face of mounting fees.
This year gifts for scholarship
purposes are down by some 15%,
a fact which results in large
measure from a misconception on
the part of corporations and
foundations that government,
both state and federal, has
pre-empted the area of aid to
students to the point that private
support is no longer needed.
I think, too, that tuition and
other educational expenses have
too often been raised without
being as certain as we should be of
what the consequences would be
for middle-income families. It
seems entirely probable that
conventional forms of student aid
cannot be expected to serve these
families and we may have to seek
alternativers, such as a system of
income tax credits for the

payment of tuition.
There are also two other points
in connection with Mr. Grose's
interview with me which need
clarification. First, lest the
Financial Aids Office be
descended upon by a number of
students from families with
incomes of $35,000 a year who
expect, as a result of reading the
article, that they will not qualify
for financial aid, I want to say
that we are able to do little more
for them at this stage than to
suggest some sources of loan
support and possible means of
employment. Expansion of the
perimeters of middle-income
status have not yet reached
$35,000 a year, although they
have gone well beyond $20,000 a
year incomes.
Lastly, the reporter's
enumeration of one of the ways in
which the undergraduate financial
aid program is attempting to keep
pace with the increased demands
placed upon it needs explanation.
