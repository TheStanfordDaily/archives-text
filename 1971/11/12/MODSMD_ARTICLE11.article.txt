# Season's Best Opera
## Stunning, Sexy 'Lulu' 
### GARY SCHMIDGALL 
Sex is the most common
day-to-day pretext we have come
up with for annihiliation and
self-annihiliation. We all know
what is the ultimate in blunt
instruments. Anyone slow to
recognize the virtuosity of the
human mind should consider the
numberless ways in which man
has taken the neutral fact of sex
and twisted it to prove every
imaginable point of perversity.
This virtuosic perversity is the
subject of Alban Berg's "Lulu,"
one of the tiny handful of
unquestionably great modem
operas.
The San Francisco Opera's
production of "Lulu" is brilliant in
the most darksome ways: the
usual pleasant superlatives just
don't lie well with the opera. It is
a lacerating, repulsive, morbid
experience. "Lulu" makes
thin-blooded subscribers
harrumph up the aisle wagging
double chins in disgust. "Lulu"
makes the flesh crawl. "Lulu" is
almost unbearably exhilirating.
Berg has set in an ugly
constellation around the
sex-symbol of Lulu all the
cankered responses to sex:
regression, lesbianism, idolatry,
narcissism, spiritual idealization,
utilitarianism, passion, and finally
in the person of Jack the Ripper,
homicide.
Berg's score does not work on

the level of ideas or even
intelligible leitmotivs; it is rather a
form of impressionism which
works its effects upon the listener,
as does much of modern life,
obliquely and insidiously. Like air
pollution, the effects of Berg's
music are not so much discrete as
cumulative.
Berg's music swirls around the
figure of Lulu. The effects she has
upon all the characters in the
opera are reflected in the score's
brassy insistencies, sinister
rumblings, mindlessly frenetic
rhythms. And this production
swirls around a perfect Lulu in
Anja Silia.
Exotically Attractive
She knows nothing about
Love, Truth, Belief, or her Soul.
These, not Sex, are the troublous
words. The one fact Lulu is alive
to is that she is beautiful. And
Anja Silja is easily one of the most
erotically attractive sopranos ever.
And she knows perfectly how to
use the forces of this magnetism.
What is more, Silja is now in
her very best voice. Her soprano is
not a pretty one—none of the
voices in this production are, or
should be, pleasant ones.
But Silja's
voice was projected with the
assurance and power and athletic
suppleness to make her Lulu the
highlight of the season thus far. It
showed the kind of command one
associates with Nilsson.

The casting for the menagerie
which follows Lulu was shrewd,
not to say daring. The choice of
three very colorless, compressed,
but incisive tenors helped to
emphasize the desperateness and
lack of warmth in their
relationships with Lulu.
Kinky Quartet
John Reardon as Dr. Schoen
came closest to matching Silja's
vocal power. Only a tendency to
let aloofness become mere
stiffness marred his role. Bruce
Yarnell was fine in what must
surely be the kinkiest quartet of
roles ever taken by one man: an
animal trainer, a man who has a
heart attack on stage, an aging
athlete, and Jack the Ripper.
Christoph von Dohnanyi's
leadership in the pit was galvanic.
He was clearly in control not only
of the inner formal mechanisms
with which Berg loaded his music,
but also of the music's
sound-track-like relationship to
the drama on stage. The settings
(from 1965) are stylized and
thoroughly effective, as is the
direction of the omnipresent Paul
Hager, though on a few occasions
he wriggled tamely out of
situations where real obsenity is
called for.
One of the characters in
"Lulu" remarks that a very
interesting opera could be written
about this intriguing woman. The
S.F. production—l won't hesitate
to say it is a definitive one—proves
this beyond cavil.
("Lulu" will be repeated on
Sunday ct 2 pm and next Friday
at 8 pm. $3
standing room is the least
expensive price and prices for
other tickets range up to $15.)

rhythms. And this production
swirls around a perfect Lulu in
Anja Silia.
Exotically Attractive
She knows nothing about
Love, Truth, Belief, or her Soul.
These, not Sex, are the troublous
words. The one fact Lulu is alive
to is that she is beautiful. And
Anja Silja is easily one of the most
erotically attractive sopranos ever.
And she knows perfectly how to
use the forces of this magnetism.
What is more, Silja is now in
her very best voice. Her soprano is
not a pretty one—none of the
voices in this production are, or
should be, pleasant ones.
But Silja's
voice was projected with the
assurance and power and athletic
suppleness to make her Lulu the
highlight of the season thus far. It
showed the kind of command one
associates with Nilsson.

The casting for the menagerie
which follows Lulu was shrewd,
not to say daring. The choice of
three very colorless, compressed,
but incisive tenors helped to
emphasize the desperateness and
lack of warmth in their
relationships with Lulu.
Kinky Quartet
John Reardon as Dr. Schoen
came closest to matching Silja's
vocal power. Only a tendency to
let aloofness become mere
stiffness marred his role. Bruce
Yarnell was fine in what must
surely be the kinkiest quartet of
roles ever taken by one man: an
animal trainer, a man who has a
heart attack on stage, an aging
athlete, and Jack the Ripper.
Christoph von Dohnanyi's
leadership in the pit was galvanic.
He was clearly in control not only
of the inner formal mechanisms
with which Berg loaded his music,
but also of the music's
sound-track-like relationship to
the drama on stage. The settings
(from 1965) are stylized and
thoroughly effective, as is the
direction of the omnipresent Paul
Hager, though on a few occasions
he wriggled tamely out of
situations where real obsenity is
called for.
One of the characters in
"Lulu" remarks that a very
interesting opera could be written
about this intriguing woman. The
S.F. production—l won't hesitate
to say it is a definitive one—proves
this beyond cavil.
("Lulu" will be repeated on
Sunday ct 2 pm and next Friday
at 8 pm. $3
standing room is the least
expensive price and prices for
other tickets range up to $15.)
Sex is the most common
day-to-day pretext we have come
up with for annihiliation and
self-annihiliation. We all know
what is the ultimate in blunt
instruments. Anyone slow to
recognize the virtuosity of the
human mind should consider the
numberless ways in which man
has taken the neutral fact of sex
and twisted it to prove every
imaginable point of perversity.
This virtuosic perversity is the
subject of Alban Berg's "Lulu,"
one of the tiny handful of
unquestionably great modem
operas.
The San Francisco Opera's
production of "Lulu" is brilliant in
the most darksome ways: the
usual pleasant superlatives just
don't lie well with the opera. It is
a lacerating, repulsive, morbid
experience. "Lulu" makes
thin-blooded subscribers
harrumph up the aisle wagging
double chins in disgust. "Lulu"
makes the flesh crawl. "Lulu" is
almost unbearably exhilirating.
Berg has set in an ugly
constellation around the
sex-symbol of Lulu all the
cankered responses to sex:
regression, lesbianism, idolatry,
narcissism, spiritual idealization,
utilitarianism, passion, and finally
in the person of Jack the Ripper,
homicide.
Berg's score does not work on

the level of ideas or even
intelligible leitmotivs; it is rather a
form of impressionism which
works its effects upon the listener,
as does much of modern life,
obliquely and insidiously. Like air
pollution, the effects of Berg's
music are not so much discrete as
cumulative.
Berg's music swirls around the
figure of Lulu. The effects she has
upon all the characters in the
opera are reflected in the score's
brassy insistencies, sinister
rumblings, mindlessly frenetic
rhythms. And this production

Anja Silia.
