# Tolly's Follies
## Premieres-Previews 
### 
Because of the new weekly
entertainment calendar which will
appear in each Tuesday's Daily,
the scope of this column is going
to change a bit. Rather than list a
number of major events as I have
in the past, I will now focus on
and comment about a few things
each weekend which may be of
particular interest.
Ten Years After
(above) is appearing tonight at
Winterland, but unfortunately the
show is completely sold out.
If you still want to hear some
rock, the Joy of Cooking returns
to the Bay Area for a show at the
Berkeley Community Theater
tonight at 8 p.m. Twelve-string
guitarist John Fahey, who has
become sort of a small legend in
folk music, is also on the bill and
it should be an interesting night.
Tickets are only $2.50.
Tomorrow night again in
Berkeley, the American premiere
performance of Ezra Pound's

opera, Le Testament de Villon
will be given at Cal's Zellerbach
Auditorium at 8 p.m.
Tickets are priced at $3-5
and $2-4 for students.
Two local movie attractions
tonight deserve mentioning.
Tonight at 8:30 p.m. at the
Varsity Theatre in Palo Alto there
will be a sneak preview followed
by the regular showing of Bless
The Beasts And Children. There
will also be a sneak preview at 9
p.m. at the Menlo Theatre in
Menlo Park before the regular
screening of Sunday Bloody
Sunday. Both of these regular
attractions are highly
recommended and the inside word
on the sneak previews is that
either one is worth seeing.
