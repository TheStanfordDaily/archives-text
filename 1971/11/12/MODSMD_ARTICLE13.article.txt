# Life With Chimps: Insight About Man
## 
### TERRIF McDONALD 
Welcome to the original monkey house. This one is neither a
Vonnegut novel nor a Stanford dormitory. It is a tree in Tanzania. In
it sit Flo, Mike, Flint, Leakey and Jane Van Lawick-Goodall.
All of the above mentioned parties belong in this same family tree,
but it must be said that Jane has broken away fron the group and
progressed in a different direction. Flo, Mike, Flint and Leakey are a
few of the chimpanzees that Jane Goodall has spent the last eleven
years observing on the Gombe Stream Reserve in Africa.
Last Friday night Jane Goodall drew a crowd that filled U.C.
Berkeley's Zellerbach Auditorium (the equivalent of Stanford's Mem
Aud) and left an overflow of more than 100 hopefuls outside wihtout
tickets. She amazed, amused and just generally fascinated the
audience with her comments on man's closest primate relative.
She prefaced her talk with two scholarly cautions. Recalling the
formerly accepted dictim that man is the only tool-making animal, she
proceeded to show slides of chimps probing termite holes with
tailored blades of grass and soaking up water with leaves they had
chewed into porous pongers. "We can't say that a chimp 'doesn't do'
something; it may be that we just haven't observed it yet," she said.
Her second remark that "one must be careful in what human
behavior and motives are projected onto chimps," was accompanied
by an example of 'apparent' group co-operation in hunting. She said
that while it is tempting to presume that a group of chimps closing in
on a lone baboon might be acting in concert, it is a presumptious
observation because each chimp might very well be motivated by the
singular goal of "making an opportunistic seizure" for himself.
She introduced the assembly to a number of chimp personalities
with the slides taken by her photographer-husband, Hugo Van Lawick
and by telling "monkey" anecdotes. She noted that in keeping a
journal on over 80 chimps, she found it easier to keep track of them
by giving them names. She pointed out that she had not compromised
her scientific objectivity by naming the chimps (Leakey having the
famed anthropologist-paleontologist for a name-sake). However, when
chimp behavior lent itself to striking human comparisons, she did not
hesitate to discuss its implications.
Chimp mothers generally exhibit great concern and tenderness for
their offspring, and practice some of today's revered child psychology.
Goodall reports she has practiced some of the child-rearing methods
observed among the chimps at Gombe and suggests that the chimp
mothers have a very effective manner of distracting their children
from mischief before it becomes necessary to punish them.
The baby chimpanzee, like the human child, has a prolonged
period of dependency. Goodall has observed apes up to eight years old
crying and fretting should they lose sight of their mothers. Remarking
on the psychological damage done to chimps whose mothers ignored
or were impatient with them, Goodall felt a careful analysis of her
observations might yield clues on helping human orphans.
In her years of daily observation of the chimps carried on by
assistants in her absence, Goodall had only a few incidents of violence
or physical aggression to report. Some of her most interesting stories
about these creatures who shared common ancestors with man
perhaps as little as one million years ago, concerned their means of
avoiding violence. She told of how they usually establish dominance,
mating claims and priority for food through elaborate 'bluffing'
displays. They rant, pant, stomp and threaten each other into
submission with the weaker party crouching in surrender.
Watching the chimps interact, oblivious to her presence, Jane
Goodall recorded behavior and emotions unquestionably analogous to
human expressions of joy, sadness, jealousy, anger, worry and
embarrassment. What is missing, she said, is the chimp equivalents of
human love and hate.
Referring to a chimpanzee raised in captivity and taught the sign
language of the deaf, Goodall related Washoe's behavior when viewing
her reflection in a mirror. Her human guardians asked the chimp what
she saw. Washoe signed back, "Me, Washoe." Jane Goodall not only
found this self-awareness remarkable, but speculated that "perhaps
the chimpanzee has not yet finished evolving; not toward man, but
toward a better monkey."

toward a better monkey."
Welcome to the original monkey house. This one is neither a
Vonnegut novel nor a Stanford dormitory. It is a tree in Tanzania. In
it sit Flo, Mike, Flint, Leakey and Jane Van Lawick-Goodall.
All of the above mentioned parties belong in this same family tree,
but it must be said that Jane has broken away fron the group and
progressed in a different direction. Flo, Mike, Flint and Leakey are a
few of the chimpanzees that Jane Goodall has spent the last eleven
years observing on the Gombe Stream Reserve in Africa.
Last Friday night Jane Goodall drew a crowd that filled U.C.
Berkeley's Zellerbach Auditorium (the equivalent of Stanford's Mem
Aud) and left an overflow of more than 100 hopefuls outside wihtout
tickets. She amazed, amused and just generally fascinated the
audience with her comments on man's closest primate relative.
She prefaced her talk with two scholarly cautions. Recalling the
formerly accepted dictim that man is the only tool-making animal, she
proceeded to show slides of chimps probing termite holes with
tailored blades of grass and soaking up water with leaves they had
chewed into porous pongers. "We can't say that a chimp 'doesn't do'
something; it may be that we just haven't observed it yet," she said.
Her second remark that "one must be careful in what human
behavior and motives are projected onto chimps," was accompanied
by an example of 'apparent' group co-operation in hunting. She said
that while it is tempting to presume that a group of chimps closing in
on a lone baboon might be acting in concert, it is a presumptious
observation because each chimp might very well be motivated by the
singular goal of "making an opportunistic seizure" for himself.
She introduced the assembly to a number of chimp personalities
with the slides taken by her photographer-husband, Hugo Van Lawick
and by telling "monkey" anecdotes. She noted that in keeping a
journal on over 80 chimps, she found it easier to keep track of them
by giving them names. She pointed out that she had not compromised
her scientific objectivity by naming the chimps (Leakey having the
famed anthropologist-paleontologist for a name-sake). However, when
chimp behavior lent itself to striking human comparisons, she did not
hesitate to discuss its implications.
Chimp mothers generally exhibit great concern and tenderness for
their offspring, and practice some of today's revered child psychology.
Goodall reports she has practiced some of the child-rearing methods
observed among the chimps at Gombe and suggests that the chimp
mothers have a very effective manner of distracting their children
from mischief before it becomes necessary to punish them.
The baby chimpanzee, like the human child, has a prolonged
period of dependency. Goodall has observed apes up to eight years old
crying and fretting should they lose sight of their mothers. Remarking
on the psychological damage done to chimps whose mothers ignored
or were impatient with them, Goodall felt a careful analysis of her
observations might yield clues on helping human orphans.
In her years of daily observation of the chimps carried on by
assistants in her absence, Goodall had only a few incidents of violence
or physical aggression to report. Some of her most interesting stories
about these creatures who shared common ancestors with man
perhaps as little as one million years ago, concerned their means of
avoiding violence. She told of how they usually establish dominance,
mating claims and priority for food through elaborate 'bluffing'
displays. They rant, pant, stomp and threaten each other into
submission with the weaker party crouching in surrender.
Watching the chimps interact, oblivious to her presence, Jane
Goodall recorded behavior and emotions unquestionably analogous to
human expressions of joy, sadness, jealousy, anger, worry and
embarrassment. What is missing, she said, is the chimp equivalents of
human love and hate.
Referring to a chimpanzee raised in captivity and taught the sign
language of the deaf, Goodall related Washoe's behavior when viewing
her reflection in a mirror. Her human guardians asked the chimp what
she saw. Washoe signed back, "Me, Washoe." Jane Goodall not only
found this self-awareness remarkable, but speculated that "perhaps
the chimpanzee has not yet finished evolving; not toward man, but
toward a better monkey."
