# Unique Music At Dink
## 
### 
When was the last time you were at a concert
where the instruments played included a rebec,
vielle, chitara, saracenica, sackbutt, crumhorns and
bladderpipe? If you can't remember, you have a
chance to hear all of these instruments and more
tonight at 8:00 p.m. when the Early Music Quartet
performs in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
The Early Music Quartet is a group of four
musicians based in Munich who concentrate on
Middle Ages and Rennaissance works composed
between the eleventh and sixteenth centuries. The
group was founded in 1960 by Thomas Binkley who
is the winds player of the group.
The four artists, mezzo-soprano Andrea Von
Ramm and countertenor Richard Levitt,
strings-player Sterling Jones and Binkley, are all
specially trained performers who have devoted years

of study to recreating this historical music in the
authentic spirit of the age.
Their instruments are either exact copies of the
old ones, or reconstructions based on iconographic
material, literary sources and still extant related
instruments. By the way, Webster's defines sackbutt
as "an early form of the slide trombone."
According to Binkley, this music, extremely
varied in mood and style, is anything but
"primitive." Highly complex, it has melody and
rhythm and, Binkley finds, even a certain affinity to
elements of our own "avant-garde" compositions.
(Tickets for tonight's performance are priced at
$4 and $3.25 for students. $2 student rush tickets
will be sold 15 minutes before curtain if available.
The quartet will also give a concert at Cals Hertz
Hall on Sunday night at Bp.m.)
