# Borge Still Going Strong
## 
### STU ALLEN 
Proving that talent is talent
regardless of to which generation
it belongs, Victor Borge is
entertaining old fans and new this
week at the Curran Theater in San
Francisco. Borge, a
self-proclaimed Great Dane, is
noted for his unique blend of
comedy and serious piano
performances.
Explaining that he wished a
belatedly happy birthday to
Beethoven, he sat down at the
piano and began the "Moonlight"
Sonata. His skill was
unmistakeable as the audience
focused in silence upon the single
figure on stage.
Suddenly, however it dawned:
We were listening not to the
"Moonlight" sonata, but to
"Happy Birthday," as Borge had
made a subtle transition, playing a
joke on his entire audience.
Later, Borge explained that he
was going to play something by
Mozart. Once again he captured
the full attention of all in the
theater. This time, however, he
ended the piece without any
warning by falling off the piano
bench. Indeed, one of Borge's
trademarks must surely be his
unwillingness to play any work
from start to finish in one sitting.
He explained his reasons for
this quirk: one, he "doesn't know
how . . . and that is the second
reason too." It is clear that Victor
Borge enjoys his businessâ€”he has
been a stand-up comedian and
sit-down musician for more than
thirty years.
Accompanying Borge on this
tour are Sahan Arzruni, a
Turkish-American pia.iist, and
Marylvn Mulvey, a tall, blonde
opera singer from Connecticut.

Both function as the proverbial
"Straight man" for Borge's antics.
Take Arzruni for example,
Borge would roll some
unintelligible syllables off his
tongue, ostensibly speaking
Turkish to his ostensibly ignorant
partner (who has a degree in
electrical engineering). On that
cue, they would begin to play a
duet. Borge would gradually
abandon the piece by freelancing
until the rendition was nothing
but a boring muddle of two
pianos.
At this point, Borge would
accusingly shout some more
"Turkish" at his partner, and the
audience, including this member,
would laugh appreciatively. To

pull off this routine is a mark of a
truly humorous man, which
Victor Borge is.
His talents extend beyond
music and slapstick, however, for
he was once the object of a Nazi
manhunt as a result of his political
satire. Now Borge's targets are
"Shapiro" you-know-who and the
D.A.R.'s "Prostitution Hall" in
Washington D.C.
Overdone, but perhaps
appropriate for the audience,
Borge provided a genuinely warm
conclusion and goodbye to his
visit from television-land of the
1950'5.
(Victor Borge's final two shows
will' be given tonight and
tomorrow night at 8:30 p.m.
