## Once Around The Turntable 
### 
CAT STEVENS
"Teaser and the Firecat"—Cat
Stevens-A & MSP43I3.
Sometimes (although all too
infrequently), reviewing a record
is a pure delight. The songs are
just so; the artist knows what he's
doing and does it well; the record
is perfectly produced. So it is with
Cat Stevens' new one.
"Fantastic" is not a word to be
tossed around lightly, but in this
case it is well-deserved. "Teaser
and the Firecat" is easily Stevens'
best, surpassing both the spotty
and experimental "Mona Bone
Jakon" and the excellent "Tea for
the Tillerman."
Two breaths of fresh air on
Top 40 radio in recent months
have been "Moonshadow" and
"Peace Train," and both are
included here. Basically,
instrumentation is simple
throughout the album, with the
exception of "Peace Train."
Credit producer Paul
Samwell-Smith (ex-Yardbirds)
with an excellent job.
Everyone will have their own
favorites among the ballads and
uptempo numbers. Mine happen
to be, excluding the singles,
"Rubylove," a Greek folk song
type, and "Tuesday's Dead." But
everything on this album is
deserving of attention. Four Stars!

CHICAGO
"Chicago at Carnegie Hall,
Volumes I-4," Chicago -Columbia
C4X 30865.
My roommate went out and
bought this one. Cost him eight
bucks. It's a nice thick package,
mysterious and inviting, in a
cardboard slip cover.
Inside this wonderful package,
we discovered, are: 1) two regular
wall posters; 2) one incredibly
huge poster that covers about a
third of a dorm wall; 3) a photo
book that in addition lists every
gig the group has ever played; and

4) instructions on how to register
to vote in all 50 states.
Am I forgetting something?
Oh, yeah, there are also four discs,
each made out of the new
super-thin plastic, and each in its
own individual fall-apart record
jacket sans paper duster.
Now this, to me, is the
ultimate insult to the public from
this group. All right, so they only
release two-record sets. All right,
so the singles they release are off
of three-year-old albums (latest
two singles, "Beginnings" and
"Questions 67 and 68" are both
off their first lp set, "Chicago
Transit Authority"). But this is
IT.
The music? A generally
mediocre rendition of all their
greatest hits: "Does Anybody
Really Know What Time It Is?"
"Beginnings," "Free," "Make Me
Smile," "25 or 6 to 4." Vocals are
in many places slurred, horns are
generally competent, percussion is
passable. Only the guitars really
shine, as when they save "25 or 6
to 4" from bombing completely.
And it's really a shame,
because, in the studio at least, this
band is the best of its genre,
better than Columbia's other
jazz-rock band, Blood Sweat &
Tears. But someone please tell
Chicago to either stick to the
studio or do some rehearsing. And
for the next set, how about
including a little packet with some
of Terry Kath's toenail clippings?

JOHN MANNING
"W'hite Bear"—John
Manning—Columbia C-30741.
John Manning really has a very
lovely voice. Unfortunately he
doesn't often let you enjoy it on
his new album. At best its a husky
but exceedingly mellow cross
between Richard Harris and
Gordon Lightfoot; at worst, he
simply proves that he's a disaster
as a rock vocalist.
On his slower pieces such as

"Warm Inside," "Mother Earth,"
of "The Whole Song" his fine
poetry and tender emotion is
displayed, amply, even if his band
(Bazaar) tends to get a little
schmaltzy in the Richard Harris
tradition. But on hard rockers
such as "Music Belongs To The
People," Manning demonstrates
that he has very little high range
and is simply inept at thrusting his
voice into a song, driving and
driving it onwards. Take a lesson
from Van, John.
Manning is also shown to be a
fairly competent 10-String
guitarist, but what really shines on
this album is his poetry and his
slow, drawn out melodies. Just
listen to him warble "broooooken
in the fields." This album may
hold your interest, but chances
are you won't be playing it too
often. If he'd only realize what
he's best at!

POCO
"From The Inside"-Poco-
Epic KE 30753.
This is easy goin' Poco, he
warned. Probably if you like your
Quicksilver because of Dino
Valenti's crooning, you'll like this
album for Richie Furay's
extended warbling. It's good but
it tends to get a bit boring.
This album just doesn't show
inventive country music with a bit
of Buffalo Springfield
sophistication which their earlier
works had.
"Hoedown," the first cut, is a
little misleading. Excepting
"Railroad Days" from the first
side, it's the only rock 'em,
sock 'em song, featuring an
incredibly bassy bass. Now if the
whole album only had that
quality.
"Bad Weather" has a
wonderful pedal steel guitar
backing, stretched over an
over-heavy bass. "You are the
One" again has great bass but is

kinda uninspired as a song.
Probably that's because its lacking
any substantial guitar lead.
But why does this album have
to sound like a vehicle for Furay?
"01 Forgiver" is the kind of
Richie, mellow and inventive as a
vocalist, that we can all enjoy, but
the quality of his lead here is not
in evidence much anywhere else
on the album.
I like my Poco moving. Moving
real fast, in fact. And"From the
Inside" just drags and drags.

PG&E
' 'PG&E' '—PG&E—Columbia
The former Pacific Gas &
Electric group has abbreviated
their name, added five new
musicians and come up with one
of the better new albums by a
lesser-known group. This Bay
Area band's only real exposure
came on a single'called "Are You
Ready," which received some AM
airplay a while back.
PG&E is highlighted by the
singing of Charlie Allen, who does
a mostly strong job throughout
the album. He can sing well on
moving blues numbers like "Death
Row No. 172" and "Rock &
Roller's Lament," but he really
gets going on rockers like "One
More River to Cross," "See the
Monkey Run"and "The Time Has
Come (To Make Your Peace)."
Not many groups in recorded
form make you want to get up
and move, but PG&E does that.
On those aforementioned rockers,
Allen's soulful vocals combined
with some good guitar riffs and
skillful horn refrains, really do
make you move around.
It's good to see a talented local
group make it to the level of
getting an LP out on a major
label. Hopefully enough people
will get into their music so that
PG&E will no longer mainly
connote the utility company
alone.
