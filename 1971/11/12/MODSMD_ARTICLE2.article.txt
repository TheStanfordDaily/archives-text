# Faculty Senate Vote
## Committee To Study Professoriate 
### PHIL REVZIN 
The faculty Senate yesterday voted
to establish an ad hoc committee to
deal with broad questions of the
professoriate, and began discussion of a
statement on principles of freedom of
research.
Also at the meeting President
Richard Lyman explained his position
on the Placement Center issue, saying
that the University could not become
"government by referenda," and that
the student passed referenda on the
Placement Center were not binding. He
reiterated his support for open
recruitment on campus.
Lyman further stated that as a
principle, "the University ought to be
as little involved as possible in dictating
to individuals the moral beliefs by
which they govern their lives."
The Senate action on the
professoriate, which requires the
Committee on Committees to
formulate a charge and present this for
approval, came after submission of a
report on the need for such a
committee, at the last meeting.
The resolution calls for the
establishment of the committee to
study issues relating to, among other
areas, tenure, appointments,
and retirement.
The Senate began discussion of a
proposed statement on principles of
freedom of research. The proposal,
from the Committee on Research, will
not receive formal Senate action for
some time.
The proposed statement
recommends that "the University
affirm the principle of the freedom of
scholarly research as an inherent pari of
the open and unfettered search for
truth. It follows that the individual
scholar must be free to select the
subject matter of his own research, that
he must be free to seek support, from
any source, for his work, which does
not violate the University's research
policy guidelines on secrecy in research;
and that he must be free to form and

express his own conclusions derived
from the results of his research.
"Speculations as to possible forms
of potential applications, including
those contemplated by the sponsor, if
known, should not control evaluation
of the propriety of the work."
The Senate also heard a report from
Advisory Board Chairman Donald
Kennedy, explaining the procedures the
board used in the Franklin hearing.
Kennedy said that the board would
take at least a month to formulate its
recommendations to President Lyman.
The report thanked attorney Jan Vetter

and others who aided the Board during
the hearings.
Lyman pointed out to the Senate
that the University is currently without
a judicial apparatus, due to the refusal
of last year's ASSU Senate to appoint
student members to a committee
which, in turn, selects students for the
Stanford Judicial Council (SJC).
Lyman said that if the Senate did not
appoint the members by November 19
he would investigate instigation of an
interim system. Lyman said he sent a
letter to each of the new Senate
members expressing his concerns.

members expressing his concerns.
The faculty Senate yesterday voted
to establish an ad hoc committee to
deal with broad questions of the
professoriate, and began discussion of a
statement on principles of freedom of
research.
Also at the meeting President
Richard Lyman explained his position
on the Placement Center issue, saying
that the University could not become
"government by referenda," and that
the student passed referenda on the
Placement Center were not binding. He
reiterated his support for open
recruitment on campus.
Lyman further stated that as a
principle, "the University ought to be
as little involved as possible in dictating
to individuals the moral beliefs by
which they govern their lives."
The Senate action on the
professoriate, which requires the
Committee on Committees to
formulate a charge and present this for
approval, came after submission of a
report on the need for such a
committee, at the last meeting.
The resolution calls for the
establishment of the committee to
study issues relating to, among other
areas, tenure, appointments,
and retirement.
The Senate began discussion of a
proposed statement on principles of
freedom of research. The proposal,
from the Committee on Research, will
not receive formal Senate action for
some time.
The proposed statement
recommends that "the University
affirm the principle of the freedom of
scholarly research as an inherent pari of
the open and unfettered search for
truth. It follows that the individual
scholar must be free to select the
subject matter of his own research, that
he must be free to seek support, from
any source, for his work, which does
not violate the University's research
policy guidelines on secrecy in research;
and that he must be free to form and

express his own conclusions derived
from the results of his research.
"Speculations as to possible forms
of potential applications, including
those contemplated by the sponsor, if
known, should not control evaluation
of the propriety of the work."
The Senate also heard a report from
Advisory Board Chairman Donald
Kennedy, explaining the procedures the
board used in the Franklin hearing.
Kennedy said that the board would
take at least a month to formulate its
recommendations to President Lyman.
The report thanked attorney Jan Vetter

and others who aided the Board during
the hearings.
Lyman pointed out to the Senate
that the University is currently without
a judicial apparatus, due to the refusal
of last year's ASSU Senate to appoint
student members to a committee
which, in turn, selects students for the
Stanford Judicial Council (SJC).
Lyman said that if the Senate did not
appoint the members by November 19
he would investigate instigation of an
interim system. Lyman said he sent a
letter to each of the new Senate
members expressing his concerns.
