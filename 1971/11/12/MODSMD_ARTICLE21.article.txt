## Championship 
### Charlie Hoffman 
Referring to the upcoming San Jose State-Stanford game, Coach
John Ralston stated that, . . this one is for the championship of
Santa Clara County. Those who don't live here may laugh at that, but
it's pretty serious business for the players, the coaches and all the fans
who have shared this traditional rivalry for so long."
Stanford has a ten game winning streak in the series, and looking at
the power of this year's Indian squad, many people would dismiss this
contest as a mismatch. Los Vegas oddsmakers believe that the game
will not even be fair, because they have refused to establish a point
spread and won't take bets.
The Indians rolled over the Spartans last season 34-3, but that will
not be the story this year. Ralston believes that "Washington State is
the most improved team over last year that we have played, but San
Jose State is a close second."
The Spartans destroyed highly rated San Diego State 45-7 last
Saturday night. The defense, led by one of the West Coast's finest
linebackers Dave Chaney, held San Diego State to minus 49 yards
rushing. A balanced attack led by quarterback Dave Ellis dominated
the contest, moving against the country's ninth ranked small college
defense.
San Jose State coach Dewey King has a tackle who made 21 tackles
against SDS, dumping the quarterback three times and recovering one
fumble. King feels that his squad is tightening up and is ready to play
outstanding football that it displayed last Saturday.
The Indians are aware of the Spartans strength and are preparing to
cope with a balanced offense that can throw well and also execute the
infamous triple option well. Stanford's defensive unit played very well
last week, however, and hopefully can handle the Spartan's explosive
attack. Jeff Siemon was named NCAA's defensive player of the week
for his 17 tackle performance against the Bruins, and Mike Simone
and Larry Butler also played superbly.
Offensively for the Indians, Hillary Shockley will see considerable
action Saturday, and John Winesberry and Miles Moore will also be
ready to play. The only player definitely out of the San Jose State
contest will be defensive tackle Roger Cowan who has a virus
infection.
Early in the season, the San Jose State game appeared to be a good
opportunity for Stanford to give its younger players valuable game
experience, but on the eve of the contest it looks like the Indians will
have their hands full.
Ralston is determined, however, that the squad will not repeat past
history tomorrow. "We are almost in the same position we were a year
ago, having clinched a Rose Bowl berth with two games remaining on
the season schedule. All of our players remember what happened just
12 months ago, and we're simply not going to go through that again."
San Jose State is going to make the Indians prove that tomorrow, and
the defending Rose Bowl champions should come through in style.
