# Runners Compete In Pac-8 Meet At UCLA
## 
### 
The Stanford Cross-country
team travels south to UCLA this
weekend for the Pacific Eight
Championships.
The Indians are led by Duncan
Macdonald, Bernie Lahde, and
Arvid Kretz. Kretz is still
hampered by a cold, but hopes to
be healthy by race time. Robert
Coe, one of the Indian's top
runners, is out for the season with
a sore knee. Others making the
trip are Brian Middlestaedt, Kurt
Sehonerock, Mark McConnell and

Robert Hayman.
Coach Marshall Clark figures
Washington State will win easily,
with Oregon a distant second. He
believes UCLA has the best
chance for third with Stanford
and Oregon State battling for
fourth.
Individually, Clark sees Duncan
Macdonald as having an excellent
chance to finish third, possibly
second. Bernie Lahde also has a
chance to finish well.
