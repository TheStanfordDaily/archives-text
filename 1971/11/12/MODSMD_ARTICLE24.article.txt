# Ready For Pac-8 Meet
## MacDonald Paces Harriers 
### MIKE CHASSON 
Duncan Maedonald is presently
the Stanford cross-country team's
number one runner as they
prepare for the Pacific Eight
Championships this weekend.
He has won against UCLA,
USC, and Cal. He has finished
high against conference favorite
Washington State and in the
Sacramento State Invitational.
Duncan's success this year at
distances of four and six miles has
gone a long way in destroying the
myth that half milers and milers
can't run cross-country.
Duncan attributes his success
this year primarily to two factors:
his staying completely healthy,
unlike during track when he was
constantly getting colds, and his
running more than usual during
the summer. Duncan's success,
however, may be attributable in
part to how he views running. He
sees it as divided into two parts,
running for enjoyment and
running to complete. Duncan runs

cross-country because as he
simply says,"it is fun to run."
Even during a race he is running
primarily for enjoyment.
Much of the enjoyment and
inspiration on this year's team has
been supplied by Duncan. One of
his teammates, Arvid Kretz,
states, "Duncan is responsible for
the fun on the team. It is great to
run with him. His determination
in the face of all his hardships has
been great. He is a real team
leader." It is believed by many on
the team that Duncan's success
this year has provided the
necessary inspiration for the rest
of the team to do so well this
year.
Duncan wouldn't say how he
thought he might do at the Pacific
Eight Championships. He would
just say that his performance that
day will depend on how he feels
at starting time and how the
competition feels. However, the
UCLA course, the site of the
championships, is much in his

favor, as he likes its hilly terrain.
He also has the advantage of
having run on the course before,
something that the runners from
Washington State and Oregon
haven't done.
Coach Marshall Clark believes
Duncan has an excellent chance to
finish at the top at the Pac-8
meet. He too admits, however,
that many varibles are involved
and only on race day will
everything be decided.

Washington State and in the
Sacramento State Invitational.
Duncan's success this year at
distances of four and six miles has
gone a long way in destroying the
myth that half milers and milers
can't run cross-country.
Duncan attributes his success
this year primarily to two factors:
his staying completely healthy,
unlike during track when he was
constantly getting colds, and his
running more than usual during
the summer. Duncan's success,
however, may be attributable in
part to how he views running. He
sees it as divided into two parts,
running for enjoyment and
running to complete. Duncan runs

cross-country because as he
simply says,"it is fun to run."
Even during a race he is running
primarily for enjoyment.
Much of the enjoyment and
inspiration on this year's team has
been supplied by Duncan. One of
his teammates, Arvid Kretz,
states, "Duncan is responsible for
the fun on the team. It is great to
run with him. His determination
in the face of all his hardships has
been great. He is a real team
leader." It is believed by many on
the team that Duncan's success
this year has provided the
necessary inspiration for the rest
of the team to do so well this
year.
Duncan wouldn't say how he
thought he might do at the Pacific
Eight Championships. He would
just say that his performance that
day will depend on how he feels
at starting time and how the
competition feels. However, the
UCLA course, the site of the
championships, is much in his

favor, as he likes its hilly terrain.
He also has the advantage of
having run on the course before,
something that the runners from
Washington State and Oregon
haven't done.
Coach Marshall Clark believes
Duncan has an excellent chance to
finish at the top at the Pac-8
meet. He too admits, however,
that many varibles are involved
and only on race day will
everything be decided.
