# Freshman Play Cal Today
## 
### MIKE HERMAN 
Coming off a physically
bruising and mentally depressing
contest with UCLA, the Stanford
Freshmen finally arrive at the
final game of their brief four game
season when they take on the
California Bears today at 2 p.m.
on the Berkeley campus. Once
again, the Indians will enter the
game, as they did against UCLA
and USC, as the distinct
underdog.

The Bears enter the game also
with dual losses to UCLA and
USC, but the games were less
one-sided than the ones Stanford
participated in.
The Cal Freshmen resemble
their Varsity in offensive format.
The team plays a wide-open
passing game, with help from a
rather strong running game.There
are numerous stars on the team as
witnessed by the fact that there
were 25 football scholarships

handed out by the Berkeley
Athletic Department this year
while Stanford offered only seven.
If the Indians are to realize any
dreams of coming back from their
catastrophic venture with the
Brubabes, much of the
responsibility will fall on the
shoulders of Duf Sundheim, the
Indians former part- time
quarterback. Through the
previous three games, Sundheim
has shared quarterbacking duties

with Bob Glick, but in the second
half of the game with UCLA,
Glick was forced to leave the
game after sustaining a concussion
Sundheim took over for the
injured Glick and moved Stanford
to its only score of the game,
scoring the touchdown himself on
a end run.
To have any chance of
winning, the Frosh will have to
return to their form of two weeks
ago.
