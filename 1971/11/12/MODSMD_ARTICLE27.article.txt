### 
The Stanford Ice Hocky team's offense finally came to life as the
team poured in 21 goals in two victories over Cal and the University
of San Francisco.
In the triumph over Cal the Indian squad took awhile to get used
to the scrappy Bear team. The club was sluggish and Cal jumped ahead
and led 3-2 going into the third period. But single shift goals by Eddie
Leonard and Russ MacAusland gave the club much-needed impetus.
Though the Bears knotted the score at 4-4. Tom Bedford tallied the
winner and Pat Baldwin added an insurance goal for the Cards' first
victory of the season.
The Cards then faced USF who are playing their first year in the
Bay Area Senior League. The Indians romped to a 15-1 victory.
The Stanford team faces USF tonight at 5:45 and the San
Francisco Seals on Sunday at 8:15. Both games are at Legg's Arena in
San Francisco.
