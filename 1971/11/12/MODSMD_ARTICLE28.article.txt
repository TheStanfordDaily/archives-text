Chinese Arrive At UN
NEW YORK — Communist China's chief delegates to the United Nations flew into
New York from Paris yesterday, announcing that their aim was "safeguarding the
international peace and promoting human progress."
As they debarked at Kennedy Airport, demonstrators for and against them
sang, chanted and raised banners - but out of sight and sound of the Chinese
visitors.
The pro-Red Chinese sang paeans to Communist party chairman Mao Tse-tung,
waved red banners and displayed signs reading, "Warmly welcome our delegates
from motherland."
The counterdemonstrators brandished signs reading "Down With Mao," and
one which urged the arriving Chinese to "Defect Now."
Rehnquist Vote Postponed
WASHINGTON - The nominations of William H. Rehnquist and Lewis F. Powell
to the Supreme Court were postponed for a week yesterday by the Senate
Judiciary Committee.
However, opponents of Rehnquist lost a bid to have his nomination separated
from that of Powell, who has encountered no major opposition.
Committee rules permit a seven-day postponement if any member wishes it.
Supporters of the two expect that the nominations will be sent to the Senate floor
before Thanksgiving.
Feds, Berkeley Council Tangle
SAN FRANCISCO — U.S. Atty. James L. Browning said yesterday that anyone,
including members of the Berkeley City Council, who willfully harbors a military
deserter is subject to federal prosecution.
The Berkeley Council Wednesday offered sanctuary to any crewmen who
might choose not to sail with the carrier Coral Sea, scheduled to leave nearby
Alameda today for the waters off Vietnam.
The mere offer of space to conceal deserters does not necessarily violate federal
law, Browning said. He added, however, that he will not hesitate to prosecute
persons concealing deserters.
