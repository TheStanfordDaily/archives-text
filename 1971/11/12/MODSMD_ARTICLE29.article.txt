# More Faculty Sign Franklin Brief
## 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
Sixty-two faculty members have
now signed the "faculty brief" on the
Franklin case, Political Science
Professor Charles Drekmeier said
yesterday.
Forty faculty members had
originally signed the 22-page document
which was submitted to the Advisory
Board Monday.
Drekmeier, who is collecting the

signatures in his office, said he would
continue to submit signatures to the
Board as they came in.
Signatories of the brief so far
include: Nobel Laureate in chemistry,
Linus Pauling; Chairman of the French
and Italian Departments, Raymond
Giraud; Associate Law School Dean
Thelton Henderson; and Halsted
Holman, for ten years Chairman of the
Department of Medicine

In argues "that the charges brought
against Prof. Franklin and the standards
invoked are ambiguous, vague and
overbroad, that they threaten our
constitutional protections and that if
the prosecution succeeds in this case
one major consequence will be a sense
of intimidation—that is often referred
to as a 'chilling effect'—which will
impede the performance of our
responsibilities as teachers, scholars and

citizens."
The brief goes on to say that "we
are disturbed at the possible precedent
for dismissal of an effective teacher and
scholar for the advocacy of unpopular
ideas."
Concerning the responsibility of the
Advisory Board in the case, the brief
states that the Board should keep in
mind that "standards of conduct
should be clear and well-defined prior
to any expectation that a person hold
himself to those standards."
Concerning those standards of
behavior which should be considered in
the case, the brief says that there are
two types of conduct for which a
professor may be fired: failure in his
teaching and research duties, or
wrongdoing in non-professional
contexts.
The brief argues that the competent
forum to adjucate this latter type of
wrongdoing is the courts and that the
Advisory Board should not consider
firing someone for this type of conduct
unless the person has previously been
found guilty of such conduct in the
courts.
The brief ends calling for the
Advisory Board to "refuse to make
political conformity a condition of
employment at the University."
It concludes urging that "President
Lyman be advised to drop all charges
against Professor Franklin and reinstate
him at once.
The faculty group also says it
believes "the expenses incurred by
Professor Franklin in presenting his
case should be assumed by the
University."

himself to those standards."
Concerning those standards of
behavior which should be considered in
the case, the brief says that there are
two types of conduct for which a
professor may be fired: failure in his
teaching and research duties, or
wrongdoing in non-professional
contexts.
The brief argues that the competent
forum to adjucate this latter type of
wrongdoing is the courts and that the
Advisory Board should not consider
firing someone for this type of conduct
unless the person has previously been
found guilty of such conduct in the
courts.
The brief ends calling for the
Advisory Board to "refuse to make
political conformity a condition of
employment at the University."
It concludes urging that "President
Lyman be advised to drop all charges
against Professor Franklin and reinstate
him at once.
The faculty group also says it
believes "the expenses incurred by
Professor Franklin in presenting his
case should be assumed by the
University."
