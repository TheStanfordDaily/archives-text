# Where Are Skin Flicks Made? Cooper Says 'My Back Yard,' Sues
## 
### 
Kenneth Cooper, former director of the Bechtel
International Institute, and his wife Sally are suing a group
of filmmakers who rented the Coopers' Woodside estate
and used it to film sexual orgies for a pornographic movie.
Cooper, now on leave from Stanford, is studying in Italy
to prepare a course he will teach next year.
The lawsuit, filed Friday in San Mateo County Superior
Court, asks $2.3 million in damages, claiming that the film
Love, Yolanda violated the Coopers' constitutional right to
privacy.
The suit alleges that the feature-length film, shown for
13 weeks this summer at the Supper Cinema in San
Francisco, was shot while the Coopers traveled in the Far
East during the spring of 1971.
Love, Yolanda stars a long-legged, 20-year-old redhead,
Donna Sutter, who plays an aging Hollywood sex symbol.
Sutter claims lineal descent from California pioneer John
Sutter, at whose mill gold was found in 1848.
The suit claims that the Coopers leased their property at
290 Family Farm Road, near Searsville Lake, to Charles T.
Waugaman, Michael Wisenberg, and William D. Hyde for a
nine-week period beginning in February, 1971.
In the lease agreement, the three men agreed not to use
the residence for any illegal or immoral purposes, the suit
contends.
It charges that the defendants filmed "natural and
unnatural sex acts" and "sexual orgies in the making of a
lewd, lascivious and immoral motion picture."
According to Bunim, the Coopers reacted with

"absolute horror and revulsion" to the movie. "One scene
was shot in their teen-age daughter's bedroom. It was
extremely upsetting to them."
Because of the movie, the Coopers have "suffered
extreme humiliation and embarassment" and their
"character and reputation have been defamed," the suit
charges.
Bunim would not disclose how the Coopers learned the
movie was filmed at their estate but observed "there was
enough evidence left around the home" to give them an
idea of what had happened.
The Cooper home and furnishings are "readily
identifiable" in the film, Bunim maintains.
The suit also claims that the Cooper estate, which has a
swimming pool, tennis court, and guest cottage, sustained
$25,000 damage.
Choked on Panty-Hose
Part of the damages asked in the suit involve the
swimming pool pump, which choked on a pair of
panty-hose.
Other defendants in the suit are Lowell Pickett, head of
Leo Productions; Arlene Elster, owner of the Sutter
Cinema; and Pumpernickel, Ltd., the firm that produced
the movie.
Elster conceded she exhibited the film, "but with the
understanding that it was legitimately made in all respects.
I don't know the three men who rented the house, and I've
never been there myself."
A court hearing date has not yet been set.
