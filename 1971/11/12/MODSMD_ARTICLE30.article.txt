# Witnesses Defend Hospital Sit-In
## 
### BOB MICHELET 
Three witnesses in the grievance hearing of hospital
worker John Dolly testified yesterday that the hospital
sit-in of April 8-9 was orderly and not disruptive to basic
hospital operations.
The grievance committee also announced the university
administration will not grant immunity to witnesses who
testify as to their presence or activities after the
proclamation of the sit-in as an illegal assembly.
Testimony on the nature of the sit-in before it was
declared illegal, on the afternoon of its second day, would
not be taken as evidence or reason for prosecution,
according to the administration.
Bruce Pollock, a former graduate student, testified that
the persons sitting in were very concerned with maintaining
order and cleanliness in the area they occupied.
The group, he said, wanted to be sure that normal
hospital operations were not disrupted, but that only
"decision-makers in the hospital" and "outside
provocateurs" were kept out of the occupied administrative
offices.
Claiming the sit-in was "entirely orderly," Pollock said
the "primary concern was addressing grievances . . . but
within that general aim, we would not disrupt hospital

activities." Care was taken, he said, to maintain a clear aisle
for patient travel.
Sit-In 'Orderly'
Paul Williams, a fourth-year Med student, said of the
sit-in: "I would characterize it as orderly." He noted that
ofseveral interns and residents he spoke with after the sit-in,
none thought it had disrupted or upset any patients.
Dr. Averam Goldstein, a professor of Pharmacology, said
he visited the sit-in twice on Friday, April 9, noting he was
"struck by the orderly way things were being conducted."
He agreed with Pollock's claim that "a special effort"
was made to keep the area clean and to leave an aisle clear.
"There was certainly no noise or disturbance that could
be construed as disturbing the patients," Goldstein
testified.
He said he was "astonished" that police were called late
that Friday afternoon, calling it "an action that was totally
out of keeping with what had gone before . . .(and). . . in
view of the demeanour of demonstrators and the feeling
that things were improving."
In a related development, Provost William Miller last
week upheld the dismissal of library employee John Keilch
for his part in the Hospital sit-in. His ouster had been
recommended by a 2-1 vote of a similar grievance
committee.
