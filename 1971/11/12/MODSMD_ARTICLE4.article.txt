# ASSU Senate Chooses Jefferson Chairman
## 
### TINA COOPER 
In a meeting marked by confusion
and rhetoric, the Student Senate last
night elected James Jefferson Senate
Chairman, confirmed the present
election results, and called for a special
election to fill ten empty graduate
seats.
Yesterday afternoon President
Lyman stated his intention to
investigate possibilities for an interim
judicial system, if the Senate fails to act
on nominations for the Student
Judicial Council (SJC) by next Friday.
In reaction to that statement, the
Senate scheduled a special meeting for
next Tuesday to fully discuss possible
courses of action.
Candidates for Senate Chairman
were Ken Kraft, Herb Borock, Scott
Burke and James Jefferson. Burke ran a
close second; however, when it became
clear that Jefferson would win, he
withdrew to make the election
unanimous.
In his comments before the election,
Jefferson said he felt he was the only
candidate who could lead a "strong and
cohesive" Senate. Other candidates, he
felt, would be "divisive."
McHenry Questions
Doug McHenry, one of the Council
of Presidents, asked Jefferson if he
agreed with sentiment that he might
not be a good chairman because he was
black. McHenry suggested the
"symbolic significance" might not
appear positive to the student body,
since the chairmen of the last two
Senates had been black and these
bodies had been factional and
ineffective.
Jefferson replied that the Senate
would be judged by what it produced,
and this was not decided by the
chairman. In answer to a question by
Senator Chuck Fay as to whether he
would be impartial to blacks, however,
he stated he would be partial. "I don't

consider myself a fool," he stated, "I
am partial to a people struggling for
survival."
As the Senate Chairman, he said, he
would control factionalism along
judicial lines.
The Senate moved on to elect
Senator Scott Burke Deputy Chairman.
It then confirmed the Nomination
Committee's student nominations to
University committees.
Election Validity
The Senate introduced the subject
of the validity of the recent elections.
Doug McHenry moved that the results
be immediately accepted. However,
Senator Phil Farrel moved for
discussion, since he was curious about
what had happened to the missing
overseas ballots.
Diane Fields explained that only the
German campus had wired back any
results, and those were only on the
referendum. None of the campuses had
returned Senate ballots.
After a short and inconclusive
discussion on the possible location of
the ballots, the Senate moved to
support the election results. They also
moved for a special election to fill the
empty graduate seats.
Discussion on the SJC issue was
delayed until next Tuesday. President
Lyman's deadline, as given in his speech
yesterday to the Faculty Senate,
extends until next Friday.
Students nominated and confirmed
to student committees were:
Committee on Services to Students,
Neil Bernstein, Chris Winkle;
Committee on Public Events, Lawrence
Gamble, Larry Papale; Committee on
Investment Responsibility, Harold
Hemingway, Ed Jackson, Bob Wolfe;
University Library Council, Brian
Coleman; Committee on Academic
Appraisal and Achievement, Mark
Eaton, Mary Kiely, Bonnie Watts;
SCIRE Policy Board, Linda Johnston,
Ray Riggles.
