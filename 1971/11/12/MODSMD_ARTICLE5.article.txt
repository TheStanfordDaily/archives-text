# Pribram: Brain Research Pioneer

### NANCY MERRICK 
"Can you imagine walking into class and seeing six
of yourself? You might have a real identity problem."
So says Karl Pribram, noted neuropsychologist and
Stanford Professor of Psychiatry and Psychology in
speaking of the effects of modern research on the
individual.
Referring to current research at Oxford University
paralleling Brave New World in which genetically
identical individuals can be created in test tubes,
Pribram spoke of the need for a "biological bill of
rights" to protect the individual and to keep modern
research from getting out of hand.
"Scientists got burned on the development of the
atom bomb. This time we want to be there with the
answers." To do this, Pribram believes that "both the
individual and society have to agree, they have to
make a contract."
Replication Problems
Citing the Oxford research as an example, Pribram
explained that should an individual not wish to be
"replicated" he could simply refuse society
permission to do so. The entire question of who was
fit to be duplicated would be handled within the
present legal system by allowing only qualified
organizations or individuals to participate in the
procedure.
For example, "If some guy really liked himself-and
wanted 100 copies made but he wasn't fit, the
qualified organizations and finally the courts would
have the power to refuse him." This would not result
in a reshaping of the court system, but rather in a
redirection of the problems that it deals with. The
system could be extended to all other such questions
posed by current research.
Pribram does not concern himself so much with
the theoretical, however, as with the scientific. The

small, seemingly reserved professor, complete with
white turtleneck shirt and glasses chain, is regarded as
a dynamo of thoughts and ideas by many of his
students.
One of the first 300 brain surgeons in the world,
Pribram initially became interested in the brain in
order to study the effects of frontal lobotomies, the
severing of nerve fibers in the brain which was at one
time widely performed on the violent in mental
institutions.
Early Work
Among his first studies were those dealing with the
frontal lobotomies of monkeys, and Pribram spent
several years working at the Yerkes Primate
Laboratory in Florida. Ke continued his research at
Yale in an effort to find out "what makes man
human, how he builds cultures, and what mechanism
in his brain makes him do it."
Unlike many other observers of primate behavior,
Pribram studies the brains of primates in the
laboratory rather than in the wild, insisting "I'm
interested in what's pertinent to man and want to see
how humanlike they can be made to behave."
Through studying the brains of primates, the
professor hopes to answer why even the mentally
slow are capable of propositional speech whereas the
chimpanzee, man's closest living relative, is not.
Through this understanding he feels "either our
culture could be changed to make room for those
with deficiencies or the deficiencies could be
eliminated completely."
Another large part of Pribram's research to which
much of his new book Languages of the Brain is
devoted is his theory that the mind functions much as
does the "holograph," a relatively new photographic
process.
In holography, light from every point in the

photographed scene is distributed to all points in the
film, thus resulting not in a picture of the scene, but
rather in a pattern of interference patterns which
appear as swirls on the film.
The advantage of the holograph is that even if only
a small bit of it is illuminated, the entire original
scene reappears. In addition, holographs can be
layered atop one another yet be separately
reconstructed. Hence, an enormous amount of
information can be retrievably coded, such as would
be necessary in the brain.
Pribram refers to himself as a "subjective
behaviorist" stating "if we stick to just behavior then
we miss so much." He reacts "violently" to works
such as B.F. Skinner's new book Beyond Freedom
and Dignity.
Referring to Skinner's claim that behavioral
psychology can create a "Golden Age" through the
use of strict controls over man, Pribram states, "He
just doesn't see the consequences of his research
adequately."
Ptibram maintains that as man learns more, he is
faced with more alternatives, and thus more, not less,
freedom. "We're approaching autonomy, not
control," he claims.
However, he does not refute the possibility of
man's reaching a "golden age" and feels that "each
epoch in time gets a little bit better because it recodes
information over and over into its own experience.
Every group of teenagers takes existing language and
language structures (cultures) and screws it up in its
own image and so produces novel arrangements no
one had until then thought of."
Adding to his thoughts on man's continuing
movement forward, Pribram concludes, "After all,
football games aren't quite the same as throwing
Christians to lions, so we must be improving."

YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THE ONE THAT GOT AWAY—Actually
Neuropsychologist Karl Pribram is not making a point about fish, but about
brains. Pribram was one of the first 300 neurosurgeons in the world and is
currently deeply involved in research as to how the brain functions.
