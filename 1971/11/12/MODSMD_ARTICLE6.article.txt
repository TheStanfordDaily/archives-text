# Facing The Reality Of China
## 
### 
TOURS, France, Nov. 4—The
United States government's
hostile reaction to the United
Nation's recent ouster of
Nationalist China and its
replacement by the People's
Republic of China reeks of
hypocrisy and illustrates well the
government's refusal to
acknowledge the increasing
impotence of U.S. foreign policy.
The United States' ambassador
to the U.N., George Bush, called
the overwhelming (76-35 with 17
abstentions and three absences)
vote a "moment of infamy," thus
comparing it with Roosevelt's
denunciation of the Japanese
bombing of Pearl Harbor at the
beginning of the Second World
War.
Secretary of State William P.
Rogers, who titularly is
responsible for some of the most
blatent arm-twisting in recent
diplomatic history, only went so
far as to term the U.N. vote
"unfortunate." Running truer to
form, however, he hinted that the
administration would
consider asking Congress to cut
back part of the $107.8 million it
has appropriated for the U.N. and
its associated agencies this year.
In what must have been the
understatement of the day, Bush,
a former Texas congressman, told
newsmen: "Obviously, I did not
do a good job."
i Actually, the mistakes were
not all Bush's. The landslide vote
finally forced an end to the U.S.'s
longstanding (20-year) policy of
excluding Peking from the world
assembly, bankrupt (morally and
financially) though it may be.
The circumstances of the China
vote must have seemed strange to
diplomats from all parts of the
world. As the roll was being
called, Dr. Henry A. Kissinger,
President Nixon's right-hand
foreign affairs and national
security advisor, was in Peking
laying the groundwork for
Nixon's forthcoming visit there.
Bush, meanwhile, was in the
General Assembly arguing for an
incongruous two-China policy
that satisfied no one, especially
the Peking and Taiwan
governments. The member nations
of the U.N. must have asked
themselves which man actually
represented the U.S. policy

towards China; it appears that a
majority placed more faith in
Kissinger than in Bush.
The U.S.'s own foreign policy
aside, the vote in favor of seating
Peking clearly signals a vast shift
in the attitude of most
nations—particularly those in the
"Free World" towards China.
Many countries expected China to
collapse or revert to another era
of war-lords and international
impotence in the wake of the
Great Proletarian Cultural
Revolution (GPCR). Those views

were not particularly enlightened
at the time, and now have been
proven wrong.
Many diplomats and China
experts now argue that the GPCR
has strengthened China, and
judging from her new diplomatic
activities, it is apparent that the
Peking leadership believes this.
The Chinese nation apparently
feels stronger and better able to
meet foreign—and hostile—nations
on equal terms; she can now
bargain from a position of relative
strength. With this growing
confidence has emerged a more
flexible diplomatic policy.

The U.N. vote means more
than just China's joining the
world; it also signifies that the
world now welcomes—and
needs—China. Since the
Communist revolution, China has
been intent on straightening out
her own house and in general has
ignored the dangers of following a
policy of isolation. She was and
despite the recent U.N. vote, still
is—at odds with the two great
military super-powers, the U.S.
and the U.S.S.R.: Russia is a
tremendous land power, while the
U.S. dominates the Pacific Ocean
and other seas surrounding China.
This policy of isolation has in
the past proved exceedingly
disasterous to Chinese
governments. The famed Manchu

Dynasty made no friends and
consequently was attacked or
encroached upon by Japan,
Russia, Germany, France, Great
Britain and the U.S. The
Nationalists followed essentially
the same policy, and when Japan
invaded, the Chinese had no
strong allies.
The focus of China's
newly-assumed role in the U.N.
remains unclear. She could use the
forum to pursue her dispute with
Russia. This is not likely,
however, since rhetoric in the

U.N. never has had any great
effect on the Russian leadership.
Few other communist nations
would like to see such a focus,
since it would not help them gain
support for their various causes.
It is most likely that China will
do what other countries in the
U.N. do: use the platform to
promote her own policies, to
out-politic as many nations as
possible, and to champion causes
that fit into her ideology.
Emerging Third World nations will
no doubt find a new and vivacious
advocate.
At the same time, however,
China will be subject to influences
from other countries in the world,
including the Western nations
with their alien ideologies; this is
more likely to occur in
behind-the-scenes discussions than
in the General Assembly or in the
Security Council. China is now a
member of "the club' I—and1 —and she
will be forced to pay at least
minimal attention to the attitudes
of some other members.

It seems reasonably clear that a
new era in international relations
is developing. Soon there will be
at least four super-powers: Russia,
the United States, China and the
European Common Market. Japan
could join the list should she
choose to do so and increase her
military expenditures. The world

no longer will revolve around two
poles; diplomacy will become
even more intricate as the four or
five super-powers combine and
interact.
In short, we could have
another return to the oft-ridiculed
system of "balance of power,"
such as the one that existed
during the 19th Century in
Europe.
It is becoming increasingly
evident that simply because a
country does not possess nuclear
weapons does not mean that it
doesn't "count" in the overall
power structure; guerilla or
"brush-fire" wars waged between
two lesser powers are perhaps the
best evidence of this.
President Nixon—who, if the
pollsters are correct, has scored a
diplomatic and political coup of
sorts with his planned trip to
Peking—has prophesized that an
"era of negotiations" is beginning.
His talks with the Chinese leaders
could be a large first step. The
weaker (i.e., non-nuclear) nations
probably would carry more
diplomatic weight during such a
period of negotiations.
This "era of negotiations"
should it come to pass—will not
be an easy one in which to live.
Combinations between
communist and capitalist
super-powers to check the
strength of another super-power
will be hard to achieve, maintain,
and, especially, control. It seems
liekly that the division of the
world into two "camps"
capitalist and communist—will
continue, at least for the
foreseeable future; a dramatic
"reversal of alliances," in the 19th
century sense of the phrase, is not
likely for a long time.
Both "camps"have reiterated
their ideological standpoints too
many times to abandon them
without losing prestige. This "era
of negotiations" again, should it
come to pass-then may begin
with what will appear to be an era
of deceit. Kissinger's secret first
trip to China, followed by Nixon's
dramatic announcement of the
journey immediately after his
return to Washington, may be the
first good example of this "new"
diplomatic style.
Instead of Woodrow Wilson's
"open treaties openly arrived at,"
it appears that we may be in for a
period of secret agreements
openly publicized.
