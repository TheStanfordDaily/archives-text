# the 						judgement of nuremberg
## Simplistic Approach 
### 
John d. black

Some months ago a little
handbook entitled "Principles and
Techniques of Employee
Counseling," which I had written
several years ago, was rediscovered
by someone in the U.S. Civil
Service and orders began dribbling
in from various government
departments. Finally, I received a
huge order from the Department
of Defense. I confess this fact in
the hope that my promise to
donate to charity my profit of
$175 will mitigate my punishment
as a war criminal.
But alas! I have a further
confession. 1 bought some acreage
near Grass Valley (as a hedge
against urban sprawl) and leased it
to a farmer for grazing his cows.
Now I find, to my horror, that he
is selling milk to families whose
fathers work at Beale Air Force
Base. Please, Mr. Diamond, what
can I do now to escape the
judgment of Nuremberg?
I cite these two experiences to
suggest how absurd it is to argue
that any contributor to or
beneficiary of the DOD is morally
corrupt and thus unfit to tread
this hallowed ground. How does
one distinguish between
Honeywell, Hunt Foods, the
U.S.O, or the American Hospital
Supply Corp.? Directly or
indirectly, they all contribute to
the maintenance of some aspect
of our military posture.
Having contributed hundreds
of dollars and scores of hours to

protest the war in Vietnam, over
more years than I like to
remember, I think my opposition
to it—and what it stands
for—qualifies me to be heard by
the zealous protestors at the
Placement Service.
How, pray tell, can one argue
that a company which makes
tanks is contributing more to the
military than one which makes
paper? Certainly the D.O.D.
would collapse far sooner without
paper than without tanks. If
A.T.& T. refused all DOD
telephone calls, the war and all
military operations would be
brought to a grinding halt. And if
the government could not buy
clothing for its troops—or food to
feed them—America would indeed
becme the first great power to
disarm itself.
The point is that, directly or
indirectly, millions of individuals
and thousands of corporations
participate in serving the military
establishment. The Placement
Service disruptors act as if they
had some magical basis for judging
the moral purity of would-be
recruiters. If they have such a
formula—one that can be fairly
and objectively applied-then they
should share it with the university
administration. It is not
reasonable to expect the
administration to develop
objective criteria for rating the
moral rectitude of G.E., Dow,
McDonald-Douglas, or the
Sunshine Dairy when it does not

believe that such guidelines arc
possible, even if they were
desirable.
But even more sophisticated
distinctions will have to be made.
However misquided and
despicable our role in Vietnam,
however excessive our defense
budgets, no informed person can
argue seriously that we could
suddenly dismantle our entire
defense establishment without
greatly increasing world instability
and the chances of wars. It is
therefore necessary to distinguish
between "desirable" or
"essential" defense expenditures
and those that are undesirable and
unwarranted by world conditions.
Which companies have acceptable
DOD contracts and which have
unacceptable ones?
Picketing the Placement
Service makes sense to me if it is
viewed as a symbolic act designed
to focus attention on the Vietnam
war and our overgrown military
budget. It does not make sense if
the protestors manage to convince
themselves that Honeywell is
really more evil than Dow
Chemical, or Continental Oil, or
Pan American Airways, or more
evil than the millions of
Americans who own stock in
these corporations or the tens of
thousands who choose to work
for them.
I have argued in other
circumstances that a college
education is designed to stimulate
an appreciation for complexity
and an ability to evaluate facts on
many sides of difficult issues. The
Placement Service disruptors
obviously prefer a simplistic
approach which, in the long run,
can only discredit and weaken the
anti-war movement.
