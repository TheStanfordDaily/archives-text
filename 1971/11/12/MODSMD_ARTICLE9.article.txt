To Professor Cohn
I am not a river.
I am not a circle.
I have never broken
a man with a look.
Tho I have ridden
a bicycle built for two,
we ended face-to-face.
I am not a beachball.
I am, perhaps, a
troubling consequence—
which has its compensations.

Support Library Workers
Editor, THE DAILY:
We write this letter as both
criticism and in support of the
position taken by the Library
Staff Association with regard to
the meaningless and autocratic
Grievance Procedure forced down
the throats of workers by the
adninistration.
We agree that "power is the
only kind of thing the
administration understands" and
that the administration failed to
consider all the ramifications of
the arbitrary and self-defeating
tactics. Many of the
recommendations made by the
Staff Association are solid and
worth considering. In these we
support them completely.
But there has been a faulty
analysis of the traditional
relationship between employer
and employee on the Stanford
campus. The University has never
paid-in any of our Government
unemployment costs, and still
gains delays in its lawfull
requirement to do so. This alone
shows-up the disregard in which
ordinary workers are held by the
administration. Did anyone
expect an administration with
unchecked powers to act in any
other manner? So we have our
Grievance Procedure.
The Staff Association calls this
"the final alienation", but at the
same time states that a real
workers union would be nothing
but a "dehumanizing tactic". Here
we disagree. Workers must
organize or be exploited. Has it
ever been any other way?

Racist, Sexist, LSJUMB
Editor, THE DAILY:
The Incomparable?? Leland

Stanford Junior University
Marching Band, which has in the
past shown itself to be a sexist
and chauvinistic boys club
through the exclusion of women
members, has now exposed its
overt racism towards black
people, in its ethnic degradation
attempt at James McAlister during
the U.C.L.A. pre-game show.
Although this makes me sick to
my stomach, it comes as no
surprise. Any group that excludes
women as vehemently as the
"boys in the band" have, will in
all likelihood take the same
attitude toward black people.
What really infuriates me
though is the fact that I was
forced to pay one dollar at
registration for the support of this
patently racist and sexist
buffoonery!
We can have a band here at
Stanford which includes both
sexes and doesn't perform racist
shows if we want. Therefore, I
urge all concerned members of the
Stanford community to join me in
expressing opposition to this gross
example of racism and sexism
displayed by the eunuch "boys in
the band."
Keep on tokin' bro' James.

German Dept. Reply
Editor, THE DAILY:
As the authors of the German
Department petition in support of
Bruce Franklin published in the
Daily on Tuesday, November 2,
we find it necessary to reply to
the two examples of professorial
comment which appeared in
Friday's Daily. These two
professors are telling us students
and other faculty members that
we have no right to speak out or
are even qualified to form an
opinion on issues that directly
concern us, but must rather leave
all such matters to the "proper
authoritieis" regardless of how
those authorities are constituted.
This active support of the
repressive forces is far more
frightening than the simple passive
acceptance that we were
lamenting in our original letter.
Professor Herbert Packer tells
us that he would prefer the
advisory board's judgement to
ours as we have no obligation to
listen to the evidence (only those
in an official capacity are
qualified to judge) and because he
feels we are biased. It doesn't
seem to occur to him that the
Ad ministr at ion-constituted

Advisory Board might be
somewhat biased also. Or perhaps
he simply prefers their bias.
Professor Rhinelander, after
exhaustively refuting an argument
that we did not present—i.e. that a
self-proclaimed Fascist state
already exists—goes on to tell us
not to oppose an unsatisfactory
Republican government (no
matter how oppressive it is) for
fear of bringing on that Fascism.
In effect, he informs us that we
may take no action at all, that we
must offer no resistance to a
government which we find clearly
criminal. The Declaration of
Independence itself states that
"whenever any form of
government becomes destructive
of these ends (life, liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness) it is the right
of the people to alter and abolish
it... it is their right, it is their
duty to throw off such
government and to provide new
guards for their future security."
Rhinelander, in condemning
our petition, tells us that we may
not even take legal, constitutional
means to criticize the government,
its policies, or Stanford University
for supporting those policies. We
uphold our right to appeal and
reassert our appeal to retain Bruce
Franklin.
