Yesterday In The 'Daily 9
Yesterday was Sunday, November 14, 1971. On that date, in
the year 1851, Professor H. Bruce Franklin's great-great
grandfather decided there was a reason for living after all when
he heard that the American writer, Herman Melville, had just
published an allegorical novel called "Moby Dick." Knowing
there was a future in store for the man who could explain its
conundrums to the world, Franklin's ancestor abandoned his
plans to emigrate to China and concentrated instead on finding
a suitable great-great grandmother for a potential Melville
scholar.
