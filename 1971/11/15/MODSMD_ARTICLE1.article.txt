# Huge Flying Beast Attacks Early Morning Jogger
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT FRANK MILLER 
As it skimmed the tree-tops like a low-level fighter
bomber, the early-morning sun on its four-and-a-half
foot wingspan cast a massive shadow over the grass and
dirt of Angell Field. The "big bird" sped toward Oliver
Saffir, a mere speck of breakfast birdseed for the aviary
Flying Fortress.
The big bird attacked when Saffir was at the start of
his daily jog on the track at Angell Field, Friday
morning.
"The first time, he bumped me with his stomach or
whatever birds have," Saffir recalled. "1 felt a big bump
and all these feathers."
He knew immediate that it was "some kind of crazy
bird." But the electronics engineer did not know until
several laps later that he was under "a really weird"
dive-bombing attack from "a big brownish-red bird with
a five- to six-foot wing span."
Saffir jogged on. "When I got to the straightaway he
swooped down and got me on the side of the head."
Why didn't Saffir leave the track after suffering a
small scratch on the back of his head? "When you're
working out, you just don't stop," Saffir explained.
Then, minutes later, "the last lap is when he got me
again." The big bird returned to inflict a second cut to
the back of the jogger's head.
Saffir at last admitted defeat and left the field. He is
reportedly in fine condition after a tetanus shot, but the
fate of his strange attacker is not yet known.
â€¢ Saffir said he alerted a coach of the hazard on the
track and the coach, in turn, called Stanford Police.
According to the victim, two squad cars soon arrived but
the police "didn't seem too shook up about it."
Saffir later called the county animal control office. A

trapper was supposed to come and catch the warrior-bird
Saturday, but it is not yei known whether he succeeded.
In the meantime, there was campus-wide speculation
about the winged attacker. Stanford police said the bird
had been seen in the area for about a month in the
eucalyptus trees near the athletic field.
They reported the bird has been helping athletic
department groundskeepers by eating the gophers which
plague the field.
But Saffir said that since the attack he has heard
rumors that the bird earlier had hassled other joggers.
One experienced ornithologist believes he also
spotted the big bird. Biology Department Chairman
Donald Kennedy, termed "Stanford's resident
bird-watcher" by a colleague, said a hawk swooped
down at Stanford Stadium and "cruised into the UCLA
game."
Kennedy said the red-tailed hawk, which closely
matches the description by Saffir, is the most common
species of hawk in the area.
Kennedy explained the hawks rarely attack people,
but he added that the appearance in the stadium showed
this particular bird "obviously gets closer to people than
most."
The "red-hawk" theory apparently put an end to
earlier reports that the long-lost Air Force Falcon had
reappeared. That falcon, one of two mascots of the Air
Force football team, flew off during a halftime show
here at a 1 969 football game.
Whatever kind of bird blitzed him, Saffir is worried
that its next victim may be more seriously injured.
"If they're not going to catch the bird, at least they
ought to put up a sign or something."


FEATHERED FURY-A jogger practicing on Angell Field was reportedly attacked Friday by a large predatory bird similar to this one.
The illustration shows a specimen of Harris' Hawk, very similar to the Red-Tail Hawk which has been sighted in the vicinity of the
athletic field.
