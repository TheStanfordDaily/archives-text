## Nixonomics And Capitalism 
### John Gurley 
President Nixon's new economic policy can
be understood only within the context of the
relative decline of U.S. capitalism.
The main concern of capitalist governments
is to promote private enterprise. In the
monopoly capitalism of our present-day
economy, this means that the prosperity of a
few hundred giant corporations is usually the
government's principal goal, and corporate
profits often become the principal focus for
policymaking.
Domestically, successive U.S. governments
throughout the postwar period have promoted
private corporations and their profits through
monetary and fiscal policies designed to
achieve a growing aggregate demand for goods
and services. These have been kept within
bounds so as not to generate "excessive" wage
demands and thereby unduly threaten
corporate profits.
Internationally, at the close of World War 11,
the U.S. was clearly the dominant economic
and military power in the world.
Our national administration pursued the
goal of keeping as much as possible of the
world open for trade and investment by U.S.
corporations. As a result, U.S. trade and
especially foreign investments grew
enormously and became increasingly
important as sources of profits for U.S.
corporations. Postwar U.S. governments
extended economic and military aid to
"friendly" governments (those hospitable to
U.S. foreign investments), and made use of
counter-insurgency operations and military
force.
For a time, these domestic and international
efforts paid off quite handsomely. But the
overwhelming superiority of U.S. capitalism in
the early postwar years did not last long.
In short, the supremacy of U.S. capitalism
has been much reduced by increasing
economic competition from other capitalist
countries, especially West Germany and Japan,
within a smaller capitalist world; by enlarged
military expenditures abroad to keep this

capitalistic world safe for profitable trade and
investment, but which has sapped the U.S.'s
international strength; and by the growing
ability of U.S. labor unions to raise their share
of national income at the expense of corporate
profits.
All together, these forces have compelled
new economic policies and new diplomatic
moves by the Nixon administration in its
attempt to halt the relative decline of U.S.
capitalism. These new actions are designed (1)
to shift income from labor to capital in the
U.S., and (2) to shift income mainly from
Japanese and German capitalists to U.S.
capitalists.
The first shift is being tried through wage
and price controls at home, which it is hoped
will permit profits to rise with the growth of
the economy while unreasonable wage
demands are curbed, and by further net
subsidies (especially the investment tax credit)
to the capitalist class. The second shift is being
implemented by a new international policy
that is intended to change relative prices,
relative trade and investment barriers, and
relative defense burdens in favor of the U.S.
capitalist class and by new diplomatic moves
vis-a-vis China that are intended to establish a
less costly and a more profitable area in Asia
for trade, investment, and natural resource
exploitation by U.S. corporations.
Thus, the new domestic economic policies,
including Phase Two, should be seen as only
one element of a broader attempt by Nixon to
rescue a deteriorating situation. During the
postwar period, successive administrations
have promoted and protected corporate profits
by maintaining a considerable reserve army of
labor on the sidelines to moderate wage
demands. All of this has been passed off as a
"full-employment" policy. But no postwar
administration, in fact, has been committed to
full employment, only to the promotion of
"maximum employment...in a manner
calculated to foster and promote free
competitive enterprise and the general

welfare" (Employment Act of 1 9 4 6 ).
The large Vietnam War expenditures upset
this policy by pushing the economy to levels
of employment that greatly increased labor's
bargaining power and that created deeply-held
expectations throughout the economy of
continuing inflation. When Nixon took office,
he attempted at first to stem this adverse tide
by deflationary monetary and fiscal policies,
which very quickly doubled the
unemployment rate. However, these policies
proved a failure: they not only failed to reduce
wage demands, but they came very close to
toppling the entire financial structure of Wall
Street, as stock prices fell sharply because of a
declining ability of corporations to raise their
prices, as aggregate demand weakened, to
counter the continuing large wage increases.
Nixon was then forced to retreat to slightly
expansionary monetary and fiscal policies. But
these, while serving Wall Street, gave added
power to labor and reinforced the already
deeply-embedded expectations of future
inflation, which threatened to hit corporate
profits hard both from the side of U.S. labor
and from the side of foreign capitalist
competition.
Nixon at this point was squeezed between
two unworkable policies, and his only
alternatives were to stay put or to jump clear.
Thus, we have the new domestic controls and
the additional subsidies to U.S. corporations.
But, as I implied above, these by themselves
would not be sufficient; they had to be
accompanied by a new international economic
policy that would disadvantage West Germany
and Japan to the benefit of the T T.S., and by a
new diplomacy that could i.ope for the
defusing of national liberation movements.
Only if all of this package worked well could
the world be made safer for profit-making by
the U.S. capitalist class.

President Nixon's new economic policy can
be understood only within the context of the
relative decline of U.S. capitalism.
The main concern of capitalist governments
is to promote private enterprise. In the
monopoly capitalism of our present-day
economy, this means that the prosperity of a
few hundred giant corporations is usually the
government's principal goal, and corporate
profits often become the principal focus for
policymaking.
Domestically, successive U.S. governments
throughout the postwar period have promoted
private corporations and their profits through
monetary and fiscal policies designed to
achieve a growing aggregate demand for goods
and services. These have been kept within
bounds so as not to generate "excessive" wage
demands and thereby unduly threaten
corporate profits.
Internationally, at the close of World War 11,
the U.S. was clearly the dominant economic
and military power in the world.
Our national administration pursued the
goal of keeping as much as possible of the
world open for trade and investment by U.S.
corporations. As a result, U.S. trade and
especially foreign investments grew
enormously and became increasingly
important as sources of profits for U.S.
corporations. Postwar U.S. governments
extended economic and military aid to
"friendly" governments (those hospitable to
U.S. foreign investments), and made use of
counter-insurgency operations and military
force.
For a time, these domestic and international
efforts paid off quite handsomely. But the
overwhelming superiority of U.S. capitalism in
the early postwar years did not last long.
In short, the supremacy of U.S. capitalism
has been much reduced by increasing
economic competition from other capitalist
countries, especially West Germany and Japan,
within a smaller capitalist world; by enlarged
military expenditures abroad to keep this

capitalistic world safe for profitable trade and
investment, but which has sapped the U.S.'s
international strength; and by the growing
ability of U.S. labor unions to raise their share
of national income at the expense of corporate
profits.
All together, these forces have compelled
new economic policies and new diplomatic
moves by the Nixon administration in its
attempt to halt the relative decline of U.S.
capitalism. These new actions are designed (1)
to shift income from labor to capital in the
U.S., and (2) to shift income mainly from
Japanese and German capitalists to U.S.
capitalists.
The first shift is being tried through wage
and price controls at home, which it is hoped
will permit profits to rise with the growth of
the economy while unreasonable wage
demands are curbed, and by further net
subsidies (especially the investment tax credit)
to the capitalist class. The second shift is being
implemented by a new international policy
that is intended to change relative prices,
relative trade and investment barriers, and
relative defense burdens in favor of the U.S.
capitalist class and by new diplomatic moves
vis-a-vis China that are intended to establish a
less costly and a more profitable area in Asia
for trade, investment, and natural resource
exploitation by U.S. corporations.
Thus, the new domestic economic policies,
including Phase Two, should be seen as only
one element of a broader attempt by Nixon to
rescue a deteriorating situation. During the
postwar period, successive administrations
have promoted and protected corporate profits
by maintaining a considerable reserve army of
labor on the sidelines to moderate wage
demands. All of this has been passed off as a
"full-employment" policy. But no postwar
administration, in fact, has been committed to
full employment, only to the promotion of
"maximum employment...in a manner
calculated to foster and promote free
competitive enterprise and the general

welfare" (Employment Act of 1 9 4 6 ).
The large Vietnam War expenditures upset
this policy by pushing the economy to levels
of employment that greatly increased labor's
bargaining power and that created deeply-held
expectations throughout the economy of
continuing inflation. When Nixon took office,
he attempted at first to stem this adverse tide
by deflationary monetary and fiscal policies,
which very quickly doubled the
unemployment rate. However, these policies
proved a failure: they not only failed to reduce
wage demands, but they came very close to
toppling the entire financial structure of Wall
Street, as stock prices fell sharply because of a
declining ability of corporations to raise their
prices, as aggregate demand weakened, to
counter the continuing large wage increases.
Nixon was then forced to retreat to slightly
expansionary monetary and fiscal policies. But
these, while serving Wall Street, gave added
power to labor and reinforced the already
deeply-embedded expectations of future
inflation, which threatened to hit corporate
profits hard both from the side of U.S. labor
and from the side of foreign capitalist
competition.
Nixon at this point was squeezed between
two unworkable policies, and his only
alternatives were to stay put or to jump clear.
Thus, we have the new domestic controls and
the additional subsidies to U.S. corporations.
But, as I implied above, these by themselves
would not be sufficient; they had to be
accompanied by a new international economic
policy that would disadvantage West Germany
and Japan to the benefit of the T T.S., and by a
new diplomacy that could i.ope for the
defusing of national liberation movements.
Only if all of this package worked well could
the world be made safer for profit-making by
the U.S. capitalist class.

be understood only within the context of the
relative decline of U.S. capitalism.
The main concern of capitalist governments
is to promote private enterprise. In the
monopoly capitalism of our present-day
economy, this means that the prosperity of a
few hundred giant corporations is usually the
government's principal goal, and corporate
profits often become the principal focus for
policymaking.
Domestically, successive U.S. governments
throughout the postwar period have promoted
private corporations and their profits through
monetary and fiscal policies designed to
achieve a growing aggregate demand for goods
and services. These have been kept within
bounds so as not to generate "excessive" wage
demands and thereby unduly threaten
corporate profits.
Internationally, at the close of World War 11,
the U.S. was clearly the dominant economic
and military power in the world.
Our national administration pursued the
goal of keeping as much as possible of the
world open for trade and investment by U.S.
corporations. As a result, U.S. trade and
especially foreign investments grew
enormously and became increasingly
important as sources of profits for U.S.
corporations. Postwar U.S. governments
extended economic and military aid to
"friendly" governments (those hospitable to
U.S. foreign investments), and made use of
counter-insurgency operations and military
force.
For a time, these domestic and international
efforts paid off quite handsomely. But the
overwhelming superiority of U.S. capitalism in
the early postwar years did not last long.
In short, the supremacy of U.S. capitalism
has been much reduced by increasing
economic competition from other capitalist
countries, especially West Germany and Japan,
within a smaller capitalist world; by enlarged
military expenditures abroad to keep this

capitalistic world safe for profitable trade and
investment, but which has sapped the U.S.'s
international strength; and by the growing
ability of U.S. labor unions to raise their share
of national income at the expense of corporate
profits.
All together, these forces have compelled
new economic policies and new diplomatic
moves by the Nixon administration in its
attempt to halt the relative decline of U.S.
capitalism. These new actions are designed (1)
to shift income from labor to capital in the
U.S., and (2) to shift income mainly from
Japanese and German capitalists to U.S.
capitalists.
The first shift is being tried through wage
and price controls at home, which it is hoped
will permit profits to rise with the growth of
the economy while unreasonable wage
demands are curbed, and by further net
subsidies (especially the investment tax credit)
to the capitalist class. The second shift is being
implemented by a new international policy
that is intended to change relative prices,
relative trade and investment barriers, and
relative defense burdens in favor of the U.S.
capitalist class and by new diplomatic moves
vis-a-vis China that are intended to establish a
less costly and a more profitable area in Asia
for trade, investment, and natural resource
exploitation by U.S. corporations.
Thus, the new domestic economic policies,
including Phase Two, should be seen as only
one element of a broader attempt by Nixon to
rescue a deteriorating situation. During the
postwar period, successive administrations
have promoted and protected corporate profits
by maintaining a considerable reserve army of
labor on the sidelines to moderate wage
demands. All of this has been passed off as a
"full-employment" policy. But no postwar
administration, in fact, has been committed to
full employment, only to the promotion of
"maximum employment...in a manner
calculated to foster and promote free
competitive enterprise and the general

welfare" (Employment Act of 1 9 4 6 ).
The large Vietnam War expenditures upset
this policy by pushing the economy to levels
of employment that greatly increased labor's
bargaining power and that created deeply-held
expectations throughout the economy of
continuing inflation. When Nixon took office,
he attempted at first to stem this adverse tide
by deflationary monetary and fiscal policies,
which very quickly doubled the
unemployment rate. However, these policies
proved a failure: they not only failed to reduce
wage demands, but they came very close to
toppling the entire financial structure of Wall
Street, as stock prices fell sharply because of a
declining ability of corporations to raise their
prices, as aggregate demand weakened, to
counter the continuing large wage increases.
Nixon was then forced to retreat to slightly
expansionary monetary and fiscal policies. But
these, while serving Wall Street, gave added
power to labor and reinforced the already
deeply-embedded expectations of future
inflation, which threatened to hit corporate
profits hard both from the side of U.S. labor
and from the side of foreign capitalist
competition.
Nixon at this point was squeezed between
two unworkable policies, and his only
alternatives were to stay put or to jump clear.
Thus, we have the new domestic controls and
the additional subsidies to U.S. corporations.
But, as I implied above, these by themselves
would not be sufficient; they had to be
accompanied by a new international economic
policy that would disadvantage West Germany
and Japan to the benefit of the T T.S., and by a
new diplomacy that could i.ope for the
defusing of national liberation movements.
Only if all of this package worked well could
the world be made safer for profit-making by
the U.S. capitalist class.
