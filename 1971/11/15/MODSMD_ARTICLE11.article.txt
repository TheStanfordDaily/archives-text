### 
The Santa Clara County
Sheriff's Department has
announced that an informational
meeting for men and women
interested in joining the North
County reserve deputy unit will
be held tomorrow night at 7:30
p.m. in the Tresidder Chess

Room.
The North County reserve
deputy unit is one of four groups
being organized in the County.
The North County unit will
encompass the Stanford-Barron
Park area. The units are being
organized to involve members of

the community in law
enforcement and protection
activities in their local areas and
to provide supplemental
manpower for the Sheriff's office.
TTirough membership in the
reserve, the Sheriff's department
feels that community residents
will come to a better
understanding of the duties of a
police officer and the
responsiblities of the Sheriff.
Primarily reserve deputies, who
have peace officer power when on
duty, will be used for patrol work.
They will work with a regular
deputy in a radio car on patrol in
their area.
Reserve deputies also work at
special events and may be called
into service by the Sheriff in
emergencies or natural disasters.

However, they are not called to
riots or disturbances.
Before assuming duties, reserve
deputies take a short but intensive
training course that encompasses
all phases of police work as well as
weapons training. A full
background investigation of all
applicants is also conducted by
the department. General good
health and eyesight and a
minimum age of 21 is required for
joining the unit.
Reserve deputies are essentially
volunteers, they receive no regular
salary for patrol work. They are
credited with time that is applied
against the cost of uniforms and
equipment. Reserve deputies are
expected to volunteer to work a
minimum of 16 hours per month,
according to Lieutenant Elton
Heck, Director of Reserves.
