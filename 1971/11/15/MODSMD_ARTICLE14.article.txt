# 'Last Picture Show': Commendable Disappointment
## 
### TODD McCARTHY 
Peter Bogdanovich's "The Last
Picture Show" has been the
subject of an almost uniquely
unanimous amount of critical
praise, praise which has run the
journalistic gamut from dailies to
national magazines to cultists to
director Howard Hawks, who
elated Bogdanovich by telling
him, "It's a good picture."
Newsweek called it"the most
impressive work by a young
American director since 'Citizen
Kane,' " which is not only an
outrageous claim but
misrepresents even what is good
in the film.
Personally, I would have been
more liable to enthuse over
Bogdanovich's promise on the
basis of his 1 968 debut effort
"Targets" than on "The Last
Picture Show." "Targets,"
ostensibly a study of a crazed
California sniper but more
importantly an exhilarating
exercise in the craft of the
cinema, emerged as one of the
tightest thrillers of the decade.
Bogdanovich, who has published
studies of such favorite directors
as Hitchcock, Hawks, Ford, Lang
and Dwan, dubbed "Targets" his
"Hitchcock film," an hommage to
the legendary master of suspense.
As it happens, Bogdanovich is
just now putting the finishing
touches on an exhaustive study of
another mentor, Orson Welles
(with Welles himself collaborating
on the project) and the 31 year
old director has similarly declared
that he likes to think of "The Last
Picture Show" as his Welles film.
Stylistically, Bogdanovich's film
bears little resemblance to any of
Welles' work but just as Welles'
second film, "The Magnificent
Ambersons," was set during the
period of transition from horse to
horseless carriage, Bogdanovich's
second feature coincidentally
catches the passing of movies in
deference to television as people's
principle pastime.
Nothing Has Changed
On the surface, the film is a
study of a remote and random
Texas town in 1951. Much
attention has been paid to period
details but aside from clothes, cars
and the sounds emanating from
the juke box, I can't see that the
last twenty years have changed
anything basic in small
southwestern towns, as the same
hang ups, obsessions and steadfast
isolationism remain today.
Above all else, "The Last
Picture Show" struck me as a
pervasively sex-conscious film. All
the kids are out to get laid for the
first time (and do), none of the
marriages are even remotely
successful and no one, married or
unmarried, sticks with just one
sexual partner. As in "Carnal
Knowledge," it is the sex lives of
the characters that are dwelled
upon above all else, even to the
point where we are never allowed
to glimpse the home life of
Sonny, the main protagonist and
still a high school student, what
his relationship with his parents is
and where he sleeps.
Coming from such a staunch
admirer of Ford and Hawks, it is
surprising that "The Last Picture

Show" offers so little sense of the
passing of time. The film takes
place over a period of many
months, but even that is difficult
to discern at first. Actually, in
terms of the town, it doesn't
matter that time goes unheeded,
for the landscape (except for the
theatre marquee, which is bare at
the conclusion) changes not at all.
In terms of the people,
however, a sense of time is
mandatory, for everyone
undergoes experiences and
changes which have a bearing on
how they see their world and
embrace or reject their
surroundings. In this respect, the
most fully rounded character is
Sonny's best friend, Duane, who
after a long period of itinerant
self-exile prompted by rejection in
love, returns home only to depart
again, this time for Korea.
Anything to get away. All the
same, his final gesture to Sonny is
to ask what happened to his
inamorata, an indication that
despite the elapsed time, his
teen-age tragedy at home remains
the dominant reason for his
enforced absense, as well as the
prospect of some "yellow skin."
Vicariously Personal
In a film by a self-proclaimed
auteurist and projected auteur,
the vision of the world could be
rightly expected to be a personal
one. But in "The Last Picture
Show," Bogdanovich's vision is
vicariously personal, an attitude
of the events once removed from
reality. The heritage of the film is
not that of Middle America
(Bogdanovich is a native New
Yorker) but of cinema history. It
is a film by a man more familiar
with the methods of movies than
with his subject and thus the film
emerges as more objectively

admirable than emotionally
affecting.
To his credit, Bogdanovich
does not, like several European
critics-turned-directors, load his
work with literal references to
films he likes, though he presents
his local movie house as a
veritable showcase for auteur
classics such as Ford's
"Wagonmaster," Walsh's "White
Heat," Dwan's "Sands of Iwo
Jima" and Hawks' "Red River."
Near the beginning, however,
the director carries off a very sly
and subtle exercise in movie
cross-referencing when Sonny
attends Minnelli's "Father of the
Bride" with his by-now tiresome
steady girl. As the teen-age couple
routinely begin to make out,
Sonny looks up at Elizabeth
Taylor (herself then only 18)
radiating at him from the screen.
Later that night, Sonny must
decide how to dump his girlfriend,
which is precisely what
Montgomery Clift had to do with
Shelley Winters in order to get
Elizabeth Taylor in George
Stevens' "A Place in the Sun"
made, by the way, in 1951. Due
to my warped, esoteric sensibility,
this was one of the most exciting
sequences in the movie for me.
Also exciting are the excellent
performances Bogdanovich draws
from a cast largely comprised of
actors new to the screen (it is
here, in my judgment, that lies
Bogdanovich's only similarity to
Welles). Most impressive is the

knockout mot her-daughter
combination of Ellen Burstyn and
Cybill Shepherd, the beautiful
rich bitches who live in a mansion
outside town and belong to a
country club. The mother copes
by drinking and sleeping with
truck drivers and the daughter
virtually controls the town simply
through being the most beautiful
girl there.
Tantalizing Tease
Ellen Burstyn, who was fine as
Donald Sutherland's wife in "Alex
in Wonderland," is pure fifties and
makes an entrance worthy of the
toughness of Bette Davis in her
prime and the sleekness of Janet
Leigh in her "Touch of
Evil"—"Psycho" period. Cy bill
Shepherd is the most tantalizing
tease since Claire in "Claire's
Knee" and Bogdanovich did
indeed score a casting coup in
transferring her from the cover of
Glamour magazine to a pivotal
role in his film.
Also memorable are veteran
cowboy Ben Johnson as a sort of
walking memorial to the West that
Ford and Hawks knew and Jeff
Bridges as Duane, the only poor
person to escape the town
without dying (though we don't
know what fate awaits him in
Korea). In Sonny, Timothy
Bottoms has a part only slightly
less passive than in "Johnny Got
His Gun" and in Cloris
Leachman's aging housewife is
found perhaps the best personal
correlative of the waste and decay

of the town at large.
Bogdanovich is also sensitive to
what it means to be different ages,
from the horny talk of the
teen-age boys to the aging
wallflowers who line the edges of
a Christmas party dance floor.
Also, the film can be praised even
without seeing it merely for
having been shot in black and
white, which hopefully will
induce other film makers to take
the same "risk."
Ultimately, however, "The
Last Picture Show" lacks a
necessary fullness, due both to its
limited obsessions and
unsatisfying texture of the
characters' movement in time.
Perhaps 1 would have reacted
slightly differently had not the
film been preceded by such an
avalanche of adulation. All the
same, "The Last Picture Show"
remains a commendable
disappointment.

Later that night, Sonny must
decide how to dump his girlfriend,
which is precisely what
Montgomery Clift had to do with
Shelley Winters in order to get
Elizabeth Taylor in George
Stevens' "A Place in the Sun"
made, by the way, in 1951. Due
to my warped, esoteric sensibility,
this was one of the most exciting
sequences in the movie for me.
Also exciting are the excellent
performances Bogdanovich draws
from a cast largely comprised of
actors new to the screen (it is
here, in my judgment, that lies
Bogdanovich's only similarity to
Welles). Most impressive is the

knockout mot her-daughter
combination of Ellen Burstyn and
Cybill Shepherd, the beautiful
rich bitches who live in a mansion
outside town and belong to a
country club. The mother copes
by drinking and sleeping with
truck drivers and the daughter
virtually controls the town simply
through being the most beautiful
girl there.
Tantalizing Tease
Ellen Burstyn, who was fine as
Donald Sutherland's wife in "Alex
in Wonderland," is pure fifties and
makes an entrance worthy of the
toughness of Bette Davis in her
prime and the sleekness of Janet
Leigh in her "Touch of
Evil"—"Psycho" period. Cy bill
Shepherd is the most tantalizing
tease since Claire in "Claire's
Knee" and Bogdanovich did
indeed score a casting coup in
transferring her from the cover of
Glamour magazine to a pivotal
role in his film.
Also memorable are veteran
cowboy Ben Johnson as a sort of
walking memorial to the West that
Ford and Hawks knew and Jeff
Bridges as Duane, the only poor
person to escape the town
without dying (though we don't
know what fate awaits him in
Korea). In Sonny, Timothy
Bottoms has a part only slightly
less passive than in "Johnny Got
His Gun" and in Cloris
Leachman's aging housewife is
found perhaps the best personal
correlative of the waste and decay

of the town at large.
Bogdanovich is also sensitive to
what it means to be different ages,
from the horny talk of the
teen-age boys to the aging
wallflowers who line the edges of
a Christmas party dance floor.
Also, the film can be praised even
without seeing it merely for
having been shot in black and
white, which hopefully will
induce other film makers to take
the same "risk."
Ultimately, however, "The
Last Picture Show" lacks a
necessary fullness, due both to its
limited obsessions and
unsatisfying texture of the
characters' movement in time.
Perhaps 1 would have reacted
slightly differently had not the
film been preceded by such an
avalanche of adulation. All the
same, "The Last Picture Show"
remains a commendable
disappointment.

TEXAS TEASE—Cybill Shepherd plays the Big-Girl-In-High School in
Peter Bogdanovich's "The Last Picture Show." The film deals with life
in a rural Texas community during the early 1950'5. It is currently
playing at the Vogue Theater in San Francisco.
Peter Bogdanovich's "The Last
Picture Show" has been the
subject of an almost uniquely
unanimous amount of critical
praise, praise which has run the
journalistic gamut from dailies to
national magazines to cultists to
director Howard Hawks, who
elated Bogdanovich by telling
him, "It's a good picture."
Newsweek called it"the most
impressive work by a young
American director since 'Citizen
Kane,' " which is not only an
outrageous claim but
misrepresents even what is good
in the film.
Personally, I would have been
more liable to enthuse over
Bogdanovich's promise on the
basis of his 1 968 debut effort
"Targets" than on "The Last
Picture Show." "Targets,"
ostensibly a study of a crazed
California sniper but more
importantly an exhilarating
exercise in the craft of the
cinema, emerged as one of the
tightest thrillers of the decade.
Bogdanovich, who has published
studies of such favorite directors
as Hitchcock, Hawks, Ford, Lang
and Dwan, dubbed "Targets" his
"Hitchcock film," an hommage to
the legendary master of suspense.
As it happens, Bogdanovich is
just now putting the finishing
touches on an exhaustive study of
another mentor, Orson Welles
(with Welles himself collaborating
on the project) and the 31 year
old director has similarly declared
that he likes to think of "The Last
Picture Show" as his Welles film.
Stylistically, Bogdanovich's film
bears little resemblance to any of
Welles' work but just as Welles'
second film, "The Magnificent
Ambersons," was set during the
period of transition from horse to
horseless carriage, Bogdanovich's
second feature coincidentally
catches the passing of movies in
deference to television as people's
principle pastime.
Nothing Has Changed
On the surface, the film is a
study of a remote and random
Texas town in 1951. Much
attention has been paid to period
details but aside from clothes, cars
and the sounds emanating from
the juke box, I can't see that the
last twenty years have changed
anything basic in small
southwestern towns, as the same
hang ups, obsessions and steadfast
isolationism remain today.
Above all else, "The Last
Picture Show" struck me as a
pervasively sex-conscious film. All
the kids are out to get laid for the
first time (and do), none of the
marriages are even remotely
successful and no one, married or
unmarried, sticks with just one
sexual partner. As in "Carnal
Knowledge," it is the sex lives of
the characters that are dwelled
upon above all else, even to the
point where we are never allowed
to glimpse the home life of
Sonny, the main protagonist and
still a high school student, what
his relationship with his parents is
and where he sleeps.
Coming from such a staunch
admirer of Ford and Hawks, it is
surprising that "The Last Picture

Show" offers so little sense of the
passing of time. The film takes
place over a period of many
months, but even that is difficult
to discern at first. Actually, in
terms of the town, it doesn't
matter that time goes unheeded,
for the landscape (except for the
theatre marquee, which is bare at
the conclusion) changes not at all.
In terms of the people,
however, a sense of time is
mandatory, for everyone
undergoes experiences and
changes which have a bearing on
how they see their world and
embrace or reject their
surroundings. In this respect, the
most fully rounded character is
Sonny's best friend, Duane, who
after a long period of itinerant
self-exile prompted by rejection in
love, returns home only to depart
again, this time for Korea.
Anything to get away. All the
same, his final gesture to Sonny is
to ask what happened to his
inamorata, an indication that
despite the elapsed time, his
teen-age tragedy at home remains
the dominant reason for his
enforced absense, as well as the
prospect of some "yellow skin."
Vicariously Personal
In a film by a self-proclaimed
auteurist and projected auteur,
the vision of the world could be
rightly expected to be a personal
one. But in "The Last Picture
Show," Bogdanovich's vision is
vicariously personal, an attitude
of the events once removed from
reality. The heritage of the film is
not that of Middle America
(Bogdanovich is a native New
Yorker) but of cinema history. It
is a film by a man more familiar
with the methods of movies than
with his subject and thus the film
emerges as more objectively

admirable than emotionally
affecting.
To his credit, Bogdanovich
does not, like several European
critics-turned-directors, load his
work with literal references to
films he likes, though he presents
his local movie house as a
veritable showcase for auteur
classics such as Ford's
"Wagonmaster," Walsh's "White
Heat," Dwan's "Sands of Iwo
Jima" and Hawks' "Red River."
Near the beginning, however,
the director carries off a very sly
and subtle exercise in movie
cross-referencing when Sonny
attends Minnelli's "Father of the
Bride" with his by-now tiresome
steady girl. As the teen-age couple
routinely begin to make out,
Sonny looks up at Elizabeth
Taylor (herself then only 18)
radiating at him from the screen.
Later that night, Sonny must
decide how to dump his girlfriend,
which is precisely what
Montgomery Clift had to do with
Shelley Winters in order to get
Elizabeth Taylor in George
Stevens' "A Place in the Sun"

Above all else, "The Last
Picture Show" struck me as a
pervasively sex-conscious film. All
the kids are out to get laid for the
first time (and do), none of the
marriages are even remotely
successful and no one, married or
unmarried, sticks with just one
sexual partner. As in "Carnal
Knowledge," it is the sex lives of
the characters that are dwelled
upon above all else, even to the
point where we are never allowed
to glimpse the home life of
Sonny, the main protagonist and
still a high school student, what
his relationship with his parents is
and where he sleeps.
Coming from such a staunch
admirer of Ford and Hawks, it is
surprising that "The Last Picture

Show" offers so little sense of the
passing of time. The film takes
place over a period of many
months, but even that is difficult
to discern at first. Actually, in
terms of the town, it doesn't
matter that time goes unheeded,
for the landscape (except for the
theatre marquee, which is bare at
the conclusion) changes not at all.
In terms of the people,
however, a sense of time is
mandatory, for everyone
undergoes experiences and
changes which have a bearing on
how they see their world and
embrace or reject their
surroundings. In this respect, the
most fully rounded character is
Sonny's best friend, Duane, who
after a long period of itinerant
self-exile prompted by rejection in
love, returns home only to depart
again, this time for Korea.
Anything to get away. All the
same, his final gesture to Sonny is
to ask what happened to his
inamorata, an indication that
despite the elapsed time, his
teen-age tragedy at home remains
the dominant reason for his
enforced absense, as well as the
prospect of some "yellow skin."
Vicariously Personal
In a film by a self-proclaimed
auteurist and projected auteur,
the vision of the world could be
rightly expected to be a personal
one. But in "The Last Picture
Show," Bogdanovich's vision is
vicariously personal, an attitude
of the events once removed from
reality. The heritage of the film is
not that of Middle America
(Bogdanovich is a native New
Yorker) but of cinema history. It
is a film by a man more familiar
with the methods of movies than
with his subject and thus the film
emerges as more objectively

admirable than emotionally
affecting.
To his credit, Bogdanovich
does not, like several European
critics-turned-directors, load his
work with literal references to
films he likes, though he presents
his local movie house as a
veritable showcase for auteur
classics such as Ford's
"Wagonmaster," Walsh's "White
Heat," Dwan's "Sands of Iwo
Jima" and Hawks' "Red River."
Near the beginning, however,
the director carries off a very sly
and subtle exercise in movie
cross-referencing when Sonny
attends Minnelli's "Father of the
Bride" with his by-now tiresome
steady girl. As the teen-age couple
routinely begin to make out,
Sonny looks up at Elizabeth
Taylor (herself then only 18)
radiating at him from the screen.
Later that night, Sonny must
decide how to dump his girlfriend,
which is precisely what
Montgomery Clift had to do with
Shelley Winters in order to get
Elizabeth Taylor in George
Stevens' "A Place in the Sun"
made, by the way, in 1951. Due
to my warped, esoteric sensibility,
this was one of the most exciting
sequences in the movie for me.
Also exciting are the excellent
performances Bogdanovich draws
from a cast largely comprised of
actors new to the screen (it is
here, in my judgment, that lies
Bogdanovich's only similarity to
Welles). Most impressive is the

knockout mot her-daughter
combination of Ellen Burstyn and
Cybill Shepherd, the beautiful
rich bitches who live in a mansion
outside town and belong to a
country club. The mother copes
by drinking and sleeping with
truck drivers and the daughter
virtually controls the town simply
through being the most beautiful
girl there.
Tantalizing Tease
Ellen Burstyn, who was fine as
Donald Sutherland's wife in "Alex
in Wonderland," is pure fifties and
makes an entrance worthy of the
toughness of Bette Davis in her
prime and the sleekness of Janet
Leigh in her "Touch of
Evil"—"Psycho" period. Cy bill
Shepherd is the most tantalizing
tease since Claire in "Claire's
Knee" and Bogdanovich did
indeed score a casting coup in
transferring her from the cover of
Glamour magazine to a pivotal
role in his film.
Also memorable are veteran
cowboy Ben Johnson as a sort of
walking memorial to the West that
Ford and Hawks knew and Jeff
Bridges as Duane, the only poor
person to escape the town
without dying (though we don't
know what fate awaits him in
Korea). In Sonny, Timothy
Bottoms has a part only slightly
less passive than in "Johnny Got
His Gun" and in Cloris
Leachman's aging housewife is
found perhaps the best personal
correlative of the waste and decay

of the town at large.
Bogdanovich is also sensitive to
what it means to be different ages,
from the horny talk of the
teen-age boys to the aging
wallflowers who line the edges of
a Christmas party dance floor.
Also, the film can be praised even
without seeing it merely for
having been shot in black and
white, which hopefully will
induce other film makers to take
the same "risk."
Ultimately, however, "The
Last Picture Show" lacks a
necessary fullness, due both to its
limited obsessions and
unsatisfying texture of the
characters' movement in time.
Perhaps 1 would have reacted
slightly differently had not the
film been preceded by such an
avalanche of adulation. All the
same, "The Last Picture Show"
remains a commendable
disappointment.

TEXAS TEASE—Cybill Shepherd plays the Big-Girl-In-High School in
Peter Bogdanovich's "The Last Picture Show." The film deals with life
in a rural Texas community during the early 1950'5. It is currently
playing at the Vogue Theater in San Francisco.
Peter Bogdanovich's "The Last
Picture Show" has been the
subject of an almost uniquely
unanimous amount of critical
praise, praise which has run the
journalistic gamut from dailies to
national magazines to cultists to
director Howard Hawks, who
elated Bogdanovich by telling
him, "It's a good picture."
Newsweek called it"the most
impressive work by a young
American director since 'Citizen
Kane,' " which is not only an
outrageous claim but
misrepresents even what is good
in the film.
Personally, I would have been
more liable to enthuse over
Bogdanovich's promise on the
basis of his 1 968 debut effort
"Targets" than on "The Last
Picture Show." "Targets,"
ostensibly a study of a crazed
California sniper but more
importantly an exhilarating
exercise in the craft of the
cinema, emerged as one of the
tightest thrillers of the decade.
Bogdanovich, who has published
studies of such favorite directors
as Hitchcock, Hawks, Ford, Lang
and Dwan, dubbed "Targets" his
"Hitchcock film," an hommage to
the legendary master of suspense.
As it happens, Bogdanovich is
just now putting the finishing
touches on an exhaustive study of
another mentor, Orson Welles
(with Welles himself collaborating
on the project) and the 31 year
old director has similarly declared
that he likes to think of "The Last
Picture Show" as his Welles film.
Stylistically, Bogdanovich's film
bears little resemblance to any of
Welles' work but just as Welles'
second film, "The Magnificent
Ambersons," was set during the
period of transition from horse to
horseless carriage, Bogdanovich's
second feature coincidentally
catches the passing of movies in
deference to television as people's
principle pastime.
Nothing Has Changed
On the surface, the film is a
study of a remote and random
Texas town in 1951. Much
attention has been paid to period
details but aside from clothes, cars
and the sounds emanating from
the juke box, I can't see that the
last twenty years have changed
anything basic in small
southwestern towns, as the same
hang ups, obsessions and steadfast
isolationism remain today.
Above all else, "The Last
Picture Show" struck me as a
pervasively sex-conscious film. All
the kids are out to get laid for the
first time (and do), none of the
marriages are even remotely
successful and no one, married or
unmarried, sticks with just one
sexual partner. As in "Carnal
Knowledge," it is the sex lives of
the characters that are dwelled
upon above all else, even to the
point where we are never allowed
to glimpse the home life of
Sonny, the main protagonist and
still a high school student, what
his relationship with his parents is
and where he sleeps.
Coming from such a staunch
admirer of Ford and Hawks, it is

TEXAS TEASE—Cybill Shepherd plays the Big-Girl-In-High School in
Peter Bogdanovich's "The Last Picture Show." The film deals with life
in a rural Texas community during the early 1950'5. It is currently
playing at the Vogue Theater in San Francisco.
Peter Bogdanovich's "The Last
Picture Show" has been the
subject of an almost uniquely
unanimous amount of critical
praise, praise which has run the
journalistic gamut from dailies to
national magazines to cultists to
director Howard Hawks, who
elated Bogdanovich by telling
him, "It's a good picture."
Newsweek called it"the most
impressive work by a young
American director since 'Citizen
Kane,' " which is not only an
outrageous claim but
misrepresents even what is good
in the film.
Personally, I would have been
more liable to enthuse over
Bogdanovich's promise on the
basis of his 1 968 debut effort
"Targets" than on "The Last
Picture Show." "Targets,"
ostensibly a study of a crazed
California sniper but more
importantly an exhilarating
exercise in the craft of the
cinema, emerged as one of the
tightest thrillers of the decade.
Bogdanovich, who has published
studies of such favorite directors
as Hitchcock, Hawks, Ford, Lang
and Dwan, dubbed "Targets" his
"Hitchcock film," an hommage to
the legendary master of suspense.
As it happens, Bogdanovich is
just now putting the finishing
touches on an exhaustive study of
another mentor, Orson Welles
(with Welles himself collaborating
on the project) and the 31 year
old director has similarly declared
that he likes to think of "The Last
Picture Show" as his Welles film.
Stylistically, Bogdanovich's film
bears little resemblance to any of
Welles' work but just as Welles'
second film, "The Magnificent
Ambersons," was set during the
period of transition from horse to
horseless carriage, Bogdanovich's
second feature coincidentally
catches the passing of movies in
deference to television as people's
principle pastime.
Nothing Has Changed
On the surface, the film is a
study of a remote and random
Texas town in 1951. Much
attention has been paid to period
details but aside from clothes, cars
and the sounds emanating from
the juke box, I can't see that the
last twenty years have changed
anything basic in small
southwestern towns, as the same
hang ups, obsessions and steadfast
isolationism remain today.
Above all else, "The Last
Picture Show" struck me as a
pervasively sex-conscious film. All
the kids are out to get laid for the
first time (and do), none of the
marriages are even remotely
successful and no one, married or
unmarried, sticks with just one
sexual partner. As in "Carnal
Knowledge," it is the sex lives of
the characters that are dwelled
upon above all else, even to the
point where we are never allowed
to glimpse the home life of
Sonny, the main protagonist and
still a high school student, what
his relationship with his parents is
and where he sleeps.
Coming from such a staunch
admirer of Ford and Hawks, it is
surprising that "The Last Picture

Show" offers so little sense of the
passing of time. The film takes
place over a period of many
months, but even that is difficult
to discern at first. Actually, in
terms of the town, it doesn't
matter that time goes unheeded,
for the landscape (except for the
theatre marquee, which is bare at
the conclusion) changes not at all.
In terms of the people,
however, a sense of time is
mandatory, for everyone
undergoes experiences and
changes which have a bearing on
how they see their world and
embrace or reject their
surroundings. In this respect, the
most fully rounded character is
Sonny's best friend, Duane, who
after a long period of itinerant
self-exile prompted by rejection in
love, returns home only to depart
again, this time for Korea.
Anything to get away. All the
same, his final gesture to Sonny is
to ask what happened to his
inamorata, an indication that
despite the elapsed time, his
teen-age tragedy at home remains
the dominant reason for his
enforced absense, as well as the
prospect of some "yellow skin."
Vicariously Personal
In a film by a self-proclaimed
auteurist and projected auteur,
the vision of the world could be
rightly expected to be a personal
one. But in "The Last Picture
Show," Bogdanovich's vision is
vicariously personal, an attitude
of the events once removed from
reality. The heritage of the film is
not that of Middle America
(Bogdanovich is a native New
Yorker) but of cinema history. It
is a film by a man more familiar
with the methods of movies than
with his subject and thus the film
emerges as more objectively

admirable than emotionally
affecting.
To his credit, Bogdanovich
does not, like several European
critics-turned-directors, load his
work with literal references to
films he likes, though he presents
his local movie house as a
veritable showcase for auteur
classics such as Ford's
"Wagonmaster," Walsh's "White
Heat," Dwan's "Sands of Iwo
Jima" and Hawks' "Red River."
Near the beginning, however,
the director carries off a very sly
and subtle exercise in movie
cross-referencing when Sonny
attends Minnelli's "Father of the
Bride" with his by-now tiresome
steady girl. As the teen-age couple
routinely begin to make out,
Sonny looks up at Elizabeth
Taylor (herself then only 18)
radiating at him from the screen.
Later that night, Sonny must
decide how to dump his girlfriend,
which is precisely what
Montgomery Clift had to do with
Shelley Winters in order to get
Elizabeth Taylor in George
Stevens' "A Place in the Sun"
made, by the way, in 1951. Due
to my warped, esoteric sensibility,
this was one of the most exciting
sequences in the movie for me.
Also exciting are the excellent
performances Bogdanovich draws
from a cast largely comprised of
actors new to the screen (it is
here, in my judgment, that lies
Bogdanovich's only similarity to
Welles). Most impressive is the

knockout mot her-daughter
combination of Ellen Burstyn and
Cybill Shepherd, the beautiful
rich bitches who live in a mansion
outside town and belong to a
country club. The mother copes
by drinking and sleeping with
truck drivers and the daughter
virtually controls the town simply
through being the most beautiful
girl there.
Tantalizing Tease
Ellen Burstyn, who was fine as
Donald Sutherland's wife in "Alex
in Wonderland," is pure fifties and
makes an entrance worthy of the
toughness of Bette Davis in her
prime and the sleekness of Janet
Leigh in her "Touch of
Evil"—"Psycho" period. Cy bill
Shepherd is the most tantalizing
tease since Claire in "Claire's
Knee" and Bogdanovich did
indeed score a casting coup in
transferring her from the cover of
Glamour magazine to a pivotal
role in his film.
Also memorable are veteran
cowboy Ben Johnson as a sort of
walking memorial to the West that
Ford and Hawks knew and Jeff
Bridges as Duane, the only poor
person to escape the town
without dying (though we don't
know what fate awaits him in
Korea). In Sonny, Timothy
Bottoms has a part only slightly
less passive than in "Johnny Got
His Gun" and in Cloris
Leachman's aging housewife is
found perhaps the best personal
correlative of the waste and decay

of the town at large.
Bogdanovich is also sensitive to
what it means to be different ages,
from the horny talk of the
teen-age boys to the aging
wallflowers who line the edges of
a Christmas party dance floor.
Also, the film can be praised even
without seeing it merely for
having been shot in black and
white, which hopefully will
induce other film makers to take
the same "risk."
Ultimately, however, "The
Last Picture Show" lacks a
necessary fullness, due both to its
limited obsessions and
unsatisfying texture of the
characters' movement in time.
Perhaps 1 would have reacted
slightly differently had not the
film been preceded by such an
avalanche of adulation. All the
same, "The Last Picture Show"
remains a commendable
disappointment.
