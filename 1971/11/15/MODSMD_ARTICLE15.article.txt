# Stanford Absorbs Undeserved Loss
## 
### 
San Jose State won the Santa
Clara Championship for the first
time in 10 years Saturday,
winning by a score of 13-12 in
what John Ralston termed, "... a
crazy football game. I have never
been around one as crazy. Any
time you run up 4 00 yards to
your opponent's 80, you should
win."
The Indians did play well
enough to win, but a couple of
costly errors and a luckless
kicking game gave the hustling but
outgunned Spartans a victory. As
in the Duke game, Stanford
dominated every statistical
category except the most
important one.
Rod Garcia entered the San
Jose State game as the Nation's
leading kicker with 14 field goals
in 22 tries. No other kicker in the

nation had more than 11. He, as
much as any other Indian, is
responsible for returning Stanford
to the Rose Bowl for the second
straight year. On Saturday,
however, Garcia could not hit on
any of five field goal attempts.
Offense Sputters
Garcia cannot be solely faulted
because the Indian offense
.sputtered frequently, close to the
San Jose State goal line,
precipitating Garcia's errant field
goal attempts.
The Stanford offense moved
unchallenged through the open
field on drives fueled by Don
Bunce's 10-20 yard strikes to
John Winesberry, Miles Moore,
Bill Scott, and Don Alvarado.
When the Indians closed in on the
Spartan goal line, however, they
once again displayed their chronic

inability to move the ball across.
The difference between the San
Jose State; game and previous
contests is that Garcia was not
able to bail them out.
The Thunder Chickens stopped
the Spartan's opening drive
without allowing them a first
down and after the Indian offense
took over on its own 43, Bunce
hit Winesberry for a 20 yard gain.
Two incomplete passes stalled the
drive and Garcia's 52 yard field
goal attempt was blocked by left
end John McMillion.
Discreet Punches
The first two series of the game
set a pattern of unusually rough
play that would continue
throughout the first half. Spartan
defensive back Calvin Owens was
throwing discreet punches at Miles
Moore as he came off the line to
run his patterns and many San

Jose players came close to
receiving penalties for piling on.
On the Spartan's second series,
the Thunder Chickens began
responding in kind to their
opponents violent overtures.
Running all over quarterback
Dave Ellis' protection, Jeff
Siemon dumped him for a nine
yard loss and Pete Lazetich and
Pierre Perreault duplicated exactly
Siemon's feat on the next play.
No team was able to penetrate
the other's defense successfully
until Steve Murray was tackled on
the one yard line by Dave Chaney
while attempting to flee upfield
after chasing down a bad snap.
The Spartans scored two plays
later and made the only successful
conversion of the game, to take a
7-0 lead.
Indians Defensive
The rest of the half developed
into a defensive struggle. Mike
Boryla took over for Bunce late in
the first quarter just before SJS's
touchdown, after Bunce suffered
a hip pointer while attempting to
run. Bunce came back in to lead
the team in the second quarter,
but left the game in the middle of
a drive late in the quarter. Boryla
took the squad down to the 15
yard line but fumbled in the
backfield as the Indians lost
another scoring opportunity.
Bunce came back to play the
whole second half in what Ralston
called "a very gutty
performance." He finished the
game with 221 yards in passing
with 20 completions in 36
attempts. Bunce was also the
game's leading rusher with 68
yards.
The Indians dominated the
third quarter as the defense shut
off the Spartan's attack. Jeff
Siemon intercepted a pass and
rolled 23 yards to the SJS 13, and
Bunce then hit Alvarado on the

first play for Stanford's first
score. Garcia's extra point
attempt was wide and the
Spartans had a one point lead.
Spartans Score
Ron TYibble intercepted a
Bunce pass in the fourth quarter
on Stanford's 30, and although
the defense held, a fake field goal
attempt moved the ball to the
Indian 11. Lawrence Brice took
the ball in on the next play and a
missed conversion kick gave the
Spartans al3 -6 edge.
Stanford got the touchdown
back on the next series as Jackie
Brown broke through the SJS
defenders, picked up a crushing
block on Dave Chaney and
romped 38 yards for a
touchdown. Bunce rolled around
his right end on the two point
conversion try, but was held back
inches short of winning points by
Emanuel Armstrong.
Last Attempt Fails
Two series later, the Indians
were driving, but a Bunce fumble
on the snap gave the ball to San
Jose. The defense led by Lazetich
held the Spartans magnificantly
on three plays and the offense
came back with 2:11 left, starting
out on their own 30. Passes to
Moore and Winesberry took the
Indians down to the three yard
line where with 13 seconds left on
second down, Ralston sent in
Garcia who could not overcome
the cold swirling winds and a
personally bad day, and San Jose
State took home the
championship for Santa Clara
County for the first time since
1960.
Pete Lazetich played a
tremendous game, netting 10
tackles and dealing out an
unbelievably crushing block at a
full run on Mac Arthur Kelly, who
was chasing down Eric Gross on a
punt return.

hip pointer that put him out of the game twice in the first half.
Chaney made 17 tackles to lead the San Jose State defense that was
able to stifle the Indian attack when it neared touchdown range.
San Jose State won the Santa

time in 10 years Saturday,

the finishing touches to Don Bunce after he was submarined by an
unidentified teammate. It was this kind of action that gave Bunce his
hip pointer that put him out of the game twice in the first half.
Chaney made 17 tackles to lead the San Jose State defense that was
able to stifle the Indian attack when it neared touchdown range.
San Jose State won the Santa
Clara Championship for the first
time in 10 years Saturday,
winning by a score of 13-12 in
what John Ralston termed, "... a
crazy football game. I have never
been around one as crazy. Any
time you run up 4 00 yards to
your opponent's 80, you should
win."
The Indians did play well
enough to win, but a couple of
costly errors and a luckless
kicking game gave the hustling but
outgunned Spartans a victory. As
in the Duke game, Stanford
dominated every statistical
category except the most
important one.
Rod Garcia entered the San
Jose State game as the Nation's
leading kicker with 14 field goals
in 22 tries. No other kicker in the

nation had more than 11. He, as
much as any other Indian, is
responsible for returning Stanford
to the Rose Bowl for the second
straight year. On Saturday,
however, Garcia could not hit on
any of five field goal attempts.
Offense Sputters
Garcia cannot be solely faulted
because the Indian offense
.sputtered frequently, close to the
San Jose State goal line,
precipitating Garcia's errant field
goal attempts.
The Stanford offense moved
unchallenged through the open
field on drives fueled by Don
Bunce's 10-20 yard strikes to
John Winesberry, Miles Moore,
Bill Scott, and Don Alvarado.
When the Indians closed in on the
Spartan goal line, however, they
once again displayed their chronic

inability to move the ball across.
The difference between the San
Jose State; game and previous
contests is that Garcia was not
able to bail them out.
The Thunder Chickens stopped
the Spartan's opening drive
without allowing them a first
down and after the Indian offense
took over on its own 43, Bunce
hit Winesberry for a 20 yard gain.
Two incomplete passes stalled the
drive and Garcia's 52 yard field
goal attempt was blocked by left
end John McMillion.
Discreet Punches
The first two series of the game
set a pattern of unusually rough
play that would continue
throughout the first half. Spartan
defensive back Calvin Owens was
throwing discreet punches at Miles
Moore as he came off the line to
run his patterns and many San

Jose players came close to
receiving penalties for piling on.
On the Spartan's second series,
the Thunder Chickens began
responding in kind to their
opponents violent overtures.
Running all over quarterback
Dave Ellis' protection, Jeff
Siemon dumped him for a nine
yard loss and Pete Lazetich and
Pierre Perreault duplicated exactly
Siemon's feat on the next play.
No team was able to penetrate
the other's defense successfully
until Steve Murray was tackled on
the one yard line by Dave Chaney
while attempting to flee upfield
after chasing down a bad snap.
The Spartans scored two plays
later and made the only successful
conversion of the game, to take a
7-0 lead.
Indians Defensive
The rest of the half developed
into a defensive struggle. Mike
Boryla took over for Bunce late in
the first quarter just before SJS's
touchdown, after Bunce suffered
a hip pointer while attempting to
run. Bunce came back in to lead
the team in the second quarter,
but left the game in the middle of
a drive late in the quarter. Boryla
took the squad down to the 15
yard line but fumbled in the
backfield as the Indians lost
another scoring opportunity.
Bunce came back to play the
whole second half in what Ralston
called "a very gutty
performance." He finished the
game with 221 yards in passing
with 20 completions in 36
attempts. Bunce was also the
game's leading rusher with 68
yards.
The Indians dominated the
third quarter as the defense shut
off the Spartan's attack. Jeff
Siemon intercepted a pass and
rolled 23 yards to the SJS 13, and
Bunce then hit Alvarado on the

first play for Stanford's first
score. Garcia's extra point
attempt was wide and the
Spartans had a one point lead.
Spartans Score
Ron TYibble intercepted a
Bunce pass in the fourth quarter
on Stanford's 30, and although
the defense held, a fake field goal
attempt moved the ball to the
Indian 11. Lawrence Brice took
the ball in on the next play and a
missed conversion kick gave the
Spartans al3 -6 edge.
Stanford got the touchdown
back on the next series as Jackie
Brown broke through the SJS
defenders, picked up a crushing
block on Dave Chaney and
romped 38 yards for a
touchdown. Bunce rolled around
his right end on the two point
conversion try, but was held back
inches short of winning points by
Emanuel Armstrong.
Last Attempt Fails
Two series later, the Indians
were driving, but a Bunce fumble
on the snap gave the ball to San
Jose. The defense led by Lazetich
held the Spartans magnificantly
on three plays and the offense
came back with 2:11 left, starting
out on their own 30. Passes to
Moore and Winesberry took the
Indians down to the three yard
line where with 13 seconds left on
second down, Ralston sent in
Garcia who could not overcome
the cold swirling winds and a
personally bad day, and San Jose
State took home the
championship for Santa Clara
County for the first time since
1960.
Pete Lazetich played a
tremendous game, netting 10
tackles and dealing out an
unbelievably crushing block at a
full run on Mac Arthur Kelly, who
was chasing down Eric Gross on a
punt return.

CRUNCH—San Jose State's fine middle linebacker prepares to apply
the finishing touches to Don Bunce after he was submarined by an
unidentified teammate. It was this kind of action that gave Bunce his
hip pointer that put him out of the game twice in the first half.
Chaney made 17 tackles to lead the San Jose State defense that was
able to stifle the Indian attack when it neared touchdown range.
San Jose State won the Santa
Clara Championship for the first
time in 10 years Saturday,
winning by a score of 13-12 in
what John Ralston termed, "... a
crazy football game. I have never
been around one as crazy. Any
time you run up 4 00 yards to
your opponent's 80, you should
win."
The Indians did play well
enough to win, but a couple of
costly errors and a luckless
kicking game gave the hustling but
outgunned Spartans a victory. As
in the Duke game, Stanford
dominated every statistical
category except the most
important one.
Rod Garcia entered the San
Jose State game as the Nation's
leading kicker with 14 field goals
in 22 tries. No other kicker in the

nation had more than 11. He, as
much as any other Indian, is
responsible for returning Stanford
to the Rose Bowl for the second
straight year. On Saturday,
however, Garcia could not hit on
any of five field goal attempts.
Offense Sputters
Garcia cannot be solely faulted
because the Indian offense
.sputtered frequently, close to the
San Jose State goal line,
precipitating Garcia's errant field
goal attempts.
The Stanford offense moved
unchallenged through the open
field on drives fueled by Don
Bunce's 10-20 yard strikes to
John Winesberry, Miles Moore,
Bill Scott, and Don Alvarado.
When the Indians closed in on the
Spartan goal line, however, they
once again displayed their chronic

inability to move the ball across.
The difference between the San
Jose State; game and previous
contests is that Garcia was not
able to bail them out.
The Thunder Chickens stopped
the Spartan's opening drive
without allowing them a first
down and after the Indian offense
took over on its own 43, Bunce
hit Winesberry for a 20 yard gain.
Two incomplete passes stalled the
drive and Garcia's 52 yard field
goal attempt was blocked by left
end John McMillion.
Discreet Punches
The first two series of the game
set a pattern of unusually rough
play that would continue
throughout the first half. Spartan
defensive back Calvin Owens was
throwing discreet punches at Miles
Moore as he came off the line to
run his patterns and many San

Jose players came close to
receiving penalties for piling on.
On the Spartan's second series,
the Thunder Chickens began
responding in kind to their
opponents violent overtures.
Running all over quarterback
Dave Ellis' protection, Jeff
Siemon dumped him for a nine
yard loss and Pete Lazetich and
Pierre Perreault duplicated exactly
Siemon's feat on the next play.
No team was able to penetrate
the other's defense successfully
until Steve Murray was tackled on
the one yard line by Dave Chaney
while attempting to flee upfield
after chasing down a bad snap.
The Spartans scored two plays
later and made the only successful
conversion of the game, to take a
7-0 lead.
Indians Defensive
The rest of the half developed
into a defensive struggle. Mike
Boryla took over for Bunce late in
the first quarter just before SJS's
touchdown, after Bunce suffered
a hip pointer while attempting to
run. Bunce came back in to lead
the team in the second quarter,
but left the game in the middle of
a drive late in the quarter. Boryla
took the squad down to the 15
yard line but fumbled in the
backfield as the Indians lost
another scoring opportunity.
Bunce came back to play the
whole second half in what Ralston
called "a very gutty
performance." He finished the
game with 221 yards in passing
with 20 completions in 36
attempts. Bunce was also the
game's leading rusher with 68
yards.
The Indians dominated the
third quarter as the defense shut
off the Spartan's attack. Jeff
Siemon intercepted a pass and
rolled 23 yards to the SJS 13, and
Bunce then hit Alvarado on the

first play for Stanford's first
score. Garcia's extra point
attempt was wide and the
Spartans had a one point lead.
Spartans Score
Ron TYibble intercepted a
Bunce pass in the fourth quarter
on Stanford's 30, and although
the defense held, a fake field goal
attempt moved the ball to the
Indian 11. Lawrence Brice took
the ball in on the next play and a
missed conversion kick gave the
Spartans al3 -6 edge.
Stanford got the touchdown
back on the next series as Jackie
Brown broke through the SJS
defenders, picked up a crushing
block on Dave Chaney and
romped 38 yards for a
touchdown. Bunce rolled around
his right end on the two point
conversion try, but was held back
inches short of winning points by
Emanuel Armstrong.
Last Attempt Fails
Two series later, the Indians
were driving, but a Bunce fumble
on the snap gave the ball to San
Jose. The defense led by Lazetich
held the Spartans magnificantly
on three plays and the offense
came back with 2:11 left, starting
out on their own 30. Passes to
Moore and Winesberry took the
Indians down to the three yard
line where with 13 seconds left on
second down, Ralston sent in
Garcia who could not overcome
the cold swirling winds and a
personally bad day, and San Jose
State took home the
championship for Santa Clara
County for the first time since
1960.
Pete Lazetich played a
tremendous game, netting 10
tackles and dealing out an
unbelievably crushing block at a
full run on Mac Arthur Kelly, who
was chasing down Eric Gross on a
punt return.
