After San Jose State's startling upset of the Indians Saturday
afternoon, Dewey King, the Spartan coach, held court for the press
high atop Stanford Stadium. He opened his remarks claiming that,
"There was supposed to be a battle out there between linebackers. We
had the All-American linebacker out there today. The other boy was
good, but our boy was the best. There isn't any better."
The majority of the press evidently believed King, and their
sentiment was typified by the San Francisco Examiner's reporter Glen
Schwarz who followed King's quote about middle linebacker Dave
Chaney with the comment, "How could anybody argue?"
Although Dave Chaney played a brilliant game and is an
outstanding football player, there is significant room for argument.
The other boy, Jeff Siemon, also played a brilliant game and his
accomplishments should not be drowned under the waves of accolades
accorded to the underdog Spartans and their fine middle linebacker.
The statistics show that Chaney did not outclass Siemon. Both
players made one interception, with Siemon returning his 23 yards to
set up the Indians' only touchdown. Chaney tipped a Don Bunce pass
up in the air and caught his own deflection, falling for no gain.
Chaney was in on two fumble recoveries and clearly had the edge on
Siemon in this category.
Writers made much of the fact that Chaney had 17 tackles to
Siemon's 8. They neglected to note, however, that the San Jose State
defense was on the field for 95 plays to Stanford's 59. Thus Chaney
had many more opportunities to pile up his impressive statistics.
It is also important that due to the strength of the Thunder
Chickens, Spartan ballcarriers did not often get past the line into the
territory of the Stanford linebackers. The front four of the Indians
made more tackles than the linebackers, while the Spartan linemen
made six fewer tackles than their linebackers.
Siemon has many more talented men in the defense to help him
than Chaney. This was proven by the fact that the Indians held SJS to
only 80 yards of total offense while the Spartan defense was riddled
for 391 yards.
Both Siemon and Chaney turned in tremendous efforts, and
nothing should be taken away from one in order to promote the
other. The issue will not be decided until both players face the test of
professional football.
A New Orleans Saints scout speculated on Chaney's and Siemon's
pro future on a post game radio show saying that he felt that,
although Chaney is a great player, he is too small for linebacking in
the pros and would have to be shifted to another position. He also
predicted that Siemon would make a good pro linebacker, and his
informed opinions may be the most significant comments about the
fine performances of two excellent football players Saturday.

had the All-American linebacker out there today. The other boy was
good, but our boy was the best. There isn't any better."
The majority of the press evidently believed King, and their
sentiment was typified by the San Francisco Examiner's reporter Glen
Schwarz who followed King's quote about middle linebacker Dave
Chaney with the comment, "How could anybody argue?"
Although Dave Chaney played a brilliant game and is an
outstanding football player, there is significant room for argument.
The other boy, Jeff Siemon, also played a brilliant game and his
accomplishments should not be drowned under the waves of accolades
accorded to the underdog Spartans and their fine middle linebacker.
The statistics show that Chaney did not outclass Siemon. Both
players made one interception, with Siemon returning his 23 yards to
set up the Indians' only touchdown. Chaney tipped a Don Bunce pass
up in the air and caught his own deflection, falling for no gain.
Chaney was in on two fumble recoveries and clearly had the edge on
Siemon in this category.
Writers made much of the fact that Chaney had 17 tackles to
Siemon's 8. They neglected to note, however, that the San Jose State
defense was on the field for 95 plays to Stanford's 59. Thus Chaney
had many more opportunities to pile up his impressive statistics.
It is also important that due to the strength of the Thunder
Chickens, Spartan ballcarriers did not often get past the line into the
territory of the Stanford linebackers. The front four of the Indians
made more tackles than the linebackers, while the Spartan linemen
made six fewer tackles than their linebackers.
Siemon has many more talented men in the defense to help him
than Chaney. This was proven by the fact that the Indians held SJS to
only 80 yards of total offense while the Spartan defense was riddled
for 391 yards.
Both Siemon and Chaney turned in tremendous efforts, and
nothing should be taken away from one in order to promote the
other. The issue will not be decided until both players face the test of
professional football.
A New Orleans Saints scout speculated on Chaney's and Siemon's
pro future on a post game radio show saying that he felt that,
although Chaney is a great player, he is too small for linebacking in
the pros and would have to be shifted to another position. He also
predicted that Siemon would make a good pro linebacker, and his
informed opinions may be the most significant comments about the
fine performances of two excellent football players Saturday.
After San Jose State's startling upset of the Indians Saturday
afternoon, Dewey King, the Spartan coach, held court for the press
high atop Stanford Stadium. He opened his remarks claiming that,
"There was supposed to be a battle out there between linebackers. We
had the All-American linebacker out there today. The other boy was
good, but our boy was the best. There isn't any better."
