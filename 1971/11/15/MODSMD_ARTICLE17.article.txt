# Freshman Gridders Mauled By Cal
## 
### MIKE HERMAN 
Amid the drizzling rain and
slippery mud, the Freshmen from
Stanford were driven unmercifully
into the ground by an
overwhelming California Frosh
team, 4 0-0, in a game that
emotionally bore little
resemblance to the free-for-all
atmosphere of the previous three
games this season.
The overpowering Bear unit,
established around several
sparkling stars, battered the
Indians unceasingly, racking up
thirty-three first-half points to all
but quash any hopes Stanford
might have had of evening their
record and achieve some measure
of satisfaction in a very
disappointing season.
The Indians had only one
sustained drive throughout the
entire game, the one begun by the
opening kickoff. Duf Sundheim,
who played a courageous if
unsuccessful game, led the team
from deep in its own territory to
the thirty-five yard line of
California. It all looked so easy;
the spirits were high on the
sidelines as the Indians moved
almost effortlessly through the
gigantic Cal front four on defense.
But with first down on the Cal 35,
a fumbled handoff attempt halted
the drive, and from then on, it
was all California.
Starting from his own
thirty-five, Bear quarterback,
Steve Bartkowski moved his team
the sixty-five yards to the goalline
in eleven plays. Seven of these

plays came on carries by former
All-CIF halfback Claude
Westmoreland, who finally
plunged over from the two for the
score.
Cal didn't waste any time in
scoring again as its defensive unit
stiffened and forced Stanford to
f>unt. Again, from his thirty-five,
Bartkowski directed Cal up the
field, the drive culminating in a
powerful twenty-two yard thrust
by Westmoreland to make the
score 14-0.
At the beginning of the second
quarter Bears' fullback Kim
Staskus took an Indian punt at his
45 and swept down the sidelines
for an apparent touchdown. The
brilliant run was called back
however by a holding penalty.
Another major infraction forced
the Bears to punt, marking the
first time the Indian defense had
held.
Later in the quarter, with the
Indians in control of the ball,
Sundheim, under heavy pressure
as he was all day, managed to get
off a sideline pass to his flanker,
Bill Singler, who scampered
sixty-one yards before being
hauled down on the Cal 8. The
momentum seemed to have
changed sides and, with plenty of
time still remaining, the spectators
saw a small glimmer of hope for
an Indian comeback. But, as it
always seemed to be, the Stanford
offense could not convert. On
consecutive plays, Sundheim was
dumped for five and seven yard
losses. Cal took over once again as

the Indians could gain no more
yardage on their two remaining
plays.
The next drive by California
typified the power that was at
their command. The Bears moved
eighty yards on only eight ground
plays. Halfback Phil Rossi picked
up an even fifty yards on four
carries in the drive, while Staskus
carried for the remaining thirty
yards.
After a punt and an exchange
of interceptions, Cal drove for its
final touchdown of the half. The
Indians appeared to have the drive
stifled when Bartkowski pitched
the ball from the Stanford 20 past
Westmoreland on the option play
and the ball rolled to the forty
yard line. The Bear halfback raced
after it, followed in hot pursuit by
the Indian linemen. Westmoreland
arrived first, fired a strike to
Bartkowski who was standing
alone on the 30. Seeing running
room in front of him, he started
down the sidelines only to be hit
from the blind side at the fifteen
by an Indian defender. The ball
squirted from his hands only to be
recovered by offensive guard Rich
Copeland, who rolled seven yards
more to the Indian 8.
On the next play, Bartkowski

found end Chuck Dickenson with
a pass in the end zone and Cal left
the field with a 33-0 lead at the
half. Stanford left the field in a
daze.
At the start of the second half,
the Stanford Freshmen came out
fired up to a fever pitch and
played remarkably better because
of it. The only touchdown scored
in the half came on California's
first drive, ending with
Bartkowski nailing halfback Jeff
Orlich with a twenty yard pass.
From that point on, the Indians
stayed even with Cal in scoring
and in performance. The total
frustration of the game was
written on the faces of the
Stanford players. The inevitability
of the Indians' losing was
apparent to many observers when
the Bears first took the field. At
almost every position, California
outweighed their counterparts by
twenty or thirty pounds.
Toward the end of the game,
several of the players and a couple
of the assistant coaches started to
take the game as a joke,
something to be laughed at. But
to other players, men who knew
that this would probably be the
last time that they would ever
wear any organized football

uniform again, those players who
had taken a beating all year in the
anonymity of a Frosh football
player, the crushing defeat sent a
wave of despair over them that
was shown in their words and
actions. In some cases players
wept, not out of self-pity or pain,
but out of total desolation as they
watched their teammates on the
field being thrashed. At one point,
as time ran out, a pleading yell
was heard from the end of the
bench, "Don't let the season end;
make every second count."

time still remaining, the spectators
saw a small glimmer of hope for
an Indian comeback. But, as it
always seemed to be, the Stanford
offense could not convert. On
consecutive plays, Sundheim was
dumped for five and seven yard
losses. Cal took over once again as

the Indians could gain no more
yardage on their two remaining
plays.
The next drive by California
typified the power that was at
their command. The Bears moved
eighty yards on only eight ground
plays. Halfback Phil Rossi picked
up an even fifty yards on four
carries in the drive, while Staskus
carried for the remaining thirty
yards.
After a punt and an exchange
of interceptions, Cal drove for its
final touchdown of the half. The
Indians appeared to have the drive
stifled when Bartkowski pitched
the ball from the Stanford 20 past
Westmoreland on the option play
and the ball rolled to the forty
yard line. The Bear halfback raced
after it, followed in hot pursuit by
the Indian linemen. Westmoreland
arrived first, fired a strike to
Bartkowski who was standing
alone on the 30. Seeing running
room in front of him, he started
down the sidelines only to be hit
from the blind side at the fifteen
by an Indian defender. The ball
squirted from his hands only to be
recovered by offensive guard Rich
Copeland, who rolled seven yards
more to the Indian 8.
On the next play, Bartkowski

found end Chuck Dickenson with
a pass in the end zone and Cal left
the field with a 33-0 lead at the
half. Stanford left the field in a
daze.
At the start of the second half,
the Stanford Freshmen came out
fired up to a fever pitch and
played remarkably better because
of it. The only touchdown scored
in the half came on California's
first drive, ending with
Bartkowski nailing halfback Jeff
Orlich with a twenty yard pass.
From that point on, the Indians
stayed even with Cal in scoring
and in performance. The total
frustration of the game was
written on the faces of the
Stanford players. The inevitability
of the Indians' losing was
apparent to many observers when
the Bears first took the field. At
almost every position, California
outweighed their counterparts by
twenty or thirty pounds.
Toward the end of the game,
several of the players and a couple
of the assistant coaches started to
take the game as a joke,
something to be laughed at. But
to other players, men who knew
that this would probably be the
last time that they would ever
wear any organized football

uniform again, those players who
had taken a beating all year in the
anonymity of a Frosh football
player, the crushing defeat sent a
wave of despair over them that
was shown in their words and
actions. In some cases players
wept, not out of self-pity or pain,
but out of total desolation as they
watched their teammates on the
field being thrashed. At one point,
as time ran out, a pleading yell
was heard from the end of the
bench, "Don't let the season end;
make every second count."

WRONG MAN—Dave Ellis, the Spartan quarterback found the wrong
man with one of his passes as Jeff Siemon intercepted and ran the ball
down to the SJS 13 yard line. This set up Indian s first touchdown, a
13 yard pass to Don Alvarado.
Amid the drizzling rain and
slippery mud, the Freshmen from
Stanford were driven unmercifully
into the ground by an
overwhelming California Frosh
team, 4 0-0, in a game that
emotionally bore little
resemblance to the free-for-all
atmosphere of the previous three
games this season.
The overpowering Bear unit,
established around several
sparkling stars, battered the
Indians unceasingly, racking up
thirty-three first-half points to all
but quash any hopes Stanford
might have had of evening their
record and achieve some measure
of satisfaction in a very
disappointing season.
The Indians had only one
sustained drive throughout the
entire game, the one begun by the
opening kickoff. Duf Sundheim,
who played a courageous if
unsuccessful game, led the team
from deep in its own territory to
the thirty-five yard line of
California. It all looked so easy;
the spirits were high on the
sidelines as the Indians moved
almost effortlessly through the
gigantic Cal front four on defense.
But with first down on the Cal 35,
a fumbled handoff attempt halted
the drive, and from then on, it
was all California.
Starting from his own
thirty-five, Bear quarterback,
Steve Bartkowski moved his team
the sixty-five yards to the goalline
in eleven plays. Seven of these

plays came on carries by former
All-CIF halfback Claude
Westmoreland, who finally
plunged over from the two for the
score.
Cal didn't waste any time in
scoring again as its defensive unit
stiffened and forced Stanford to
f>unt. Again, from his thirty-five,
Bartkowski directed Cal up the
field, the drive culminating in a
powerful twenty-two yard thrust
by Westmoreland to make the
score 14-0.
At the beginning of the second
quarter Bears' fullback Kim
Staskus took an Indian punt at his
45 and swept down the sidelines
for an apparent touchdown. The
brilliant run was called back
however by a holding penalty.
Another major infraction forced
the Bears to punt, marking the
first time the Indian defense had
held.
Later in the quarter, with the
Indians in control of the ball,
Sundheim, under heavy pressure
as he was all day, managed to get
off a sideline pass to his flanker,
Bill Singler, who scampered
sixty-one yards before being
hauled down on the Cal 8. The
momentum seemed to have
changed sides and, with plenty of
time still remaining, the spectators
saw a small glimmer of hope for
an Indian comeback. But, as it
always seemed to be, the Stanford

last time that they would ever
wear any organized football

uniform again, those players who
had taken a beating all year in the
anonymity of a Frosh football
player, the crushing defeat sent a
wave of despair over them that
was shown in their words and
actions. In some cases players
wept, not out of self-pity or pain,
but out of total desolation as they
watched their teammates on the
field being thrashed. At one point,
as time ran out, a pleading yell
was heard from the end of the
bench, "Don't let the season end;

WRONG MAN—Dave Ellis, the Spartan quarterback found the wrong
man with one of his passes as Jeff Siemon intercepted and ran the ball
down to the SJS 13 yard line. This set up Indian s first touchdown, a
13 yard pass to Don Alvarado.
Amid the drizzling rain and
slippery mud, the Freshmen from
Stanford were driven unmercifully
into the ground by an
overwhelming California Frosh
team, 4 0-0, in a game that
emotionally bore little
resemblance to the free-for-all
atmosphere of the previous three
games this season.
The overpowering Bear unit,
established around several
sparkling stars, battered the
Indians unceasingly, racking up
thirty-three first-half points to all
but quash any hopes Stanford
might have had of evening their
record and achieve some measure
of satisfaction in a very
disappointing season.
The Indians had only one
sustained drive throughout the
entire game, the one begun by the
opening kickoff. Duf Sundheim,
who played a courageous if
unsuccessful game, led the team
from deep in its own territory to
the thirty-five yard line of
California. It all looked so easy;
the spirits were high on the
sidelines as the Indians moved
almost effortlessly through the
gigantic Cal front four on defense.
But with first down on the Cal 35,
a fumbled handoff attempt halted
the drive, and from then on, it
was all California.
Starting from his own
thirty-five, Bear quarterback,
Steve Bartkowski moved his team
the sixty-five yards to the goalline
in eleven plays. Seven of these

plays came on carries by former
All-CIF halfback Claude
Westmoreland, who finally
plunged over from the two for the
score.
Cal didn't waste any time in
scoring again as its defensive unit
stiffened and forced Stanford to
f>unt. Again, from his thirty-five,
Bartkowski directed Cal up the
field, the drive culminating in a
powerful twenty-two yard thrust
by Westmoreland to make the
score 14-0.
At the beginning of the second
quarter Bears' fullback Kim
Staskus took an Indian punt at his
45 and swept down the sidelines
for an apparent touchdown. The
brilliant run was called back
however by a holding penalty.
Another major infraction forced
the Bears to punt, marking the
first time the Indian defense had
held.
Later in the quarter, with the
Indians in control of the ball,
Sundheim, under heavy pressure
as he was all day, managed to get
off a sideline pass to his flanker,
Bill Singler, who scampered
sixty-one yards before being
hauled down on the Cal 8. The
momentum seemed to have
changed sides and, with plenty of
time still remaining, the spectators
saw a small glimmer of hope for
an Indian comeback. But, as it
always seemed to be, the Stanford
offense could not convert. On
consecutive plays, Sundheim was
dumped for five and seven yard
losses. Cal took over once again as

the Indians could gain no more
yardage on their two remaining
plays.
The next drive by California
typified the power that was at
their command. The Bears moved
eighty yards on only eight ground
plays. Halfback Phil Rossi picked
up an even fifty yards on four
carries in the drive, while Staskus
carried for the remaining thirty
yards.
After a punt and an exchange
of interceptions, Cal drove for its
final touchdown of the half. The
Indians appeared to have the drive
stifled when Bartkowski pitched
the ball from the Stanford 20 past
Westmoreland on the option play
and the ball rolled to the forty
yard line. The Bear halfback raced
after it, followed in hot pursuit by
the Indian linemen. Westmoreland
arrived first, fired a strike to
Bartkowski who was standing
alone on the 30. Seeing running
room in front of him, he started
down the sidelines only to be hit
from the blind side at the fifteen
by an Indian defender. The ball
squirted from his hands only to be
recovered by offensive guard Rich
Copeland, who rolled seven yards
more to the Indian 8.
On the next play, Bartkowski

found end Chuck Dickenson with
a pass in the end zone and Cal left
the field with a 33-0 lead at the
half. Stanford left the field in a
daze.
At the start of the second half,
the Stanford Freshmen came out
fired up to a fever pitch and
played remarkably better because
of it. The only touchdown scored
in the half came on California's
first drive, ending with
Bartkowski nailing halfback Jeff
Orlich with a twenty yard pass.
From that point on, the Indians
stayed even with Cal in scoring
and in performance. The total
frustration of the game was
written on the faces of the
Stanford players. The inevitability
of the Indians' losing was
apparent to many observers when
the Bears first took the field. At
almost every position, California
outweighed their counterparts by
twenty or thirty pounds.
Toward the end of the game,
several of the players and a couple
of the assistant coaches started to
take the game as a joke,
something to be laughed at. But
to other players, men who knew
that this would probably be the
last time that they would ever
wear any organized football

uniform again, those players who
had taken a beating all year in the
anonymity of a Frosh football
player, the crushing defeat sent a
