# Runners Place 7th

### MIKE CHASSON 
The Stanford Cross-country
team ended its season on a sour
note last Saturday as the Indians
placed seventh in the Pacific Eight
Championships at UCLA.
Washington State won as
expected with 31 points, placing
five men in the top ten. They
were followed by Oregon 44,
UCLA 77, USC 124, Oregon State
133, Cal 14 2, Stanford 15 4, and
Washington 203.
The Indians received a big jolt
before the meet even started as
Duncan Macdonald woke up
Saturday morning very sick.
Macdonald decided to run
anyway, but he was obviously just
too sick as he placed 31st, where
as if he had been healthy he
would probably have placed in the
top five. The top finisher for
Stanford was Bernie Lahde who
placed 15 th. Coach Marshall Clark
said Lahde ran well, but not as
fast as in the UCLAâ€”Stanford
dual meet.
The next Stanford finisher was
freshman Kurt Schonerock who
placed 30 th. Schonerock was
slightly sick Saturday morning
and very nervous, and Clark
believed this affected his
performance. Arvid Kretz still had
his cold on Saturday and finished
back in the pack. Robert Haymen

ran his best race of the year, and
Clark was very pleased with his
performance.
The illness of Macdonald was a
severe shock to the Stanford
team. This shock coupled with
the illnesses was probably in large
part responsible for Stanford's
poor performance. However,
Coach Clark said, "The results
were very disppointing, but I
don't want to offer any alibis for
our performance." It was obvious
however, that much of what
happened Saturday was out of the
Indians' hands.
