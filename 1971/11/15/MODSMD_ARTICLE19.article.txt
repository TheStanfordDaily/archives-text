Funny Money
RICHMOND, Va. — Secret Service agents said
yesterday someone is using an ordinary office
photocopying machine to obtain black-and-white
copies of $1 bills and then using the fakes,
successfully, in money-changing machines.
The newspaper said the counterfeit bills—just
the front side has been copied—have started
showing up in the bill-changing machines on the
campus of Virginia Commonwealth University
here.
The Secret Service was notified when vending
machine operators discovered the photocopy
fakes in their change machines. The machines
have been handing over $1 in change for the
worthless copies, the Secret Service said.
Phase II Ignored
SAN FRANCISCO — A strike-ending soft coal
contract with pay boosts far exceeding the Phase
2 guideline highlighted a series of labor
developments yesterday. The East and Gulf coast
dock strike grew worse, as longshoremen in West
Gulf ports from Lake Charles, La., to
Brownsville, Tex., threatened to join the walkout
for the first time.
A strike by 10,000 employees of the
Greyhound Bus Co., which had been set for noon
yesterday, was postponed until Friday. It
threatened to shut down all service east of the
Rockies and curtail operations in the far West.

In Florida, some 7,000 employees of the
General Telephone Co. of Florida won pay
boosts which, like the coal settlement, were more
than double the Phase 2 guideline of 5.5 per cent
a year.
Mariner 9 Pictures
PASADENA Calif. — Mariner 9, steadily orbiti
Mars twice a day, sent back the first closeup
television pictures of the Red Planet yesterday
but a thick global haze robbed scientists of a
detailed view. The first 10 pictures beamed 76
million miles back to earth appeared uniformly
gray on television monitors at California Institute
of Technology's Jet Propulsion Laboratory here.
Scientists focused on a photograph taken early
Saturday, while Mariner was 70,000 miles from
Mars on its approach to orbit, showing a crater
"as big across as the State of Indiana."
The haze that obscured initial closeup photos
is believed to be dust kicked up by winds that
began raging across Mars in late September.
Communist Takeover
SAN FRANCISCO — Oil millionaire H. L. Hunt
said yesterday that United States has only three
or four years left before the Communist
takeover.
Hunt told a news conference at his plush hotel
suite here that all foreign diplomacy problems

should be blamed on Henry Kissinger, President
Nixon's advisor for national security affairs.
He called Kissinger a "super manager." •
"There's no one like him since Alexander the
Great, he couldn't get elected and yet he's been
running the country for the last 21 years," Hunt
said.
Great Tuna War
QUITO, Ecuador — White House counselor
Robert H. Finch and a high-level U.S.
fact-finding delegation arrived in this Ecuadorian
capital yesterday just in time for the latest round
of the Great Tuna War.
The American Tuna Boat Association reported
Saturday in San Diego, Calif., that Ecuador had
seized four more U.S. Tuna boats and a Canadian
ship, bringing to 13 the number of U.S. vessels
seized in the past week.
HAMBURG, Germany — A Rand Corp. study on
the indoctrination and tactics of the Viet Cong
commissioned by the Petagon has been supressed
because the findings clashed with official U.S.
Government thinking, the news magazine Der
Spiegel reported yesterday.
The 281-page study, based on interviews with
Viet Cong deserters, concluded that the
battlefield successes of the movement resulted
from the high ideological motivation of the
guerrilla fighters, Spiegel claimed.
The study also implied that the policy of
"Vietnamizing" the war effort was futile, the
magazine said.

India Border Trouble
NEW DELHI — Three Pakistani jet fighters
violated Indian air space yesterday over the
northern state of Kashmir, United News of India
reported.
The alleged air intrusion is the second to be
reported in the past four days in the Indian and
Pakistani governments' continued exchange of
charges of military provocation.
One of the French-built Mirage jets in
yesterday's incident was chased back to Pakistan
by Indian air force planes, the news agency
reported. The others were fired on and missed by
antiaircraft batteries, according to the agency.
Guerilla Captured
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — British troops
held a man identified as a top guerrilla fighter
yesterday while in Londonderry soldiers battled
rioters and a youth was tarred for looting.
An army spokesman said the man under
detention was a "well-known" member of the
illegal Irish Republican Army. He was seized in a
Belfast swoop by 25 troops who found him
hiding under a bed.
Officials withheld his name as police
questioned him but the spokesman commented:
"He is important enough for us to be very
pleased to have captured him. He was one of the
IRA doers -not just a talker."
One press report identified him as Sean
McGuigan.

Demonstrators
Resume Protest
After a one-week "moratorium,"
protesters will return to the Placement
Center this afternoon to picket against
job recruitpient for military-related
industries.
Dave Josephson of Columbae House
said campus job interviews are
scheduled for today with recruiters
from four companies with Defense
Department contracts—the Bell System,
General Research Corporation,
Standard Oil of California, and United
Technology Center of United Aircraft.
The protesters have demanded
cancellation of alj "military-related"
recruitment. They say a student
referendum last spring mandated such a
ban.
Two weeks ago, four days of
protests ended when police threatened
arrest of about 150 demonstrators who
were "milling-in" inside the Placement
Center, Nov. 4.
The demonstrators have also called
an open "community meeting," tonight
at 7 :30 p.m. in Soto Lounge, according
to Josephson. He said the meeting will
attempt "to set up some procedures to
resolve the dispute" between the
protesters and the administration.
Today's pickets will include
members of Columbae, Young Crows,
Faculty Political Action, and
Venceremos.
