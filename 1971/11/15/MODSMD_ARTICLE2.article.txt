# Hopkins Marine Station
## Students Experience Applied Biology 
### CAROL GREENE 
Editor's note: A committee of
prominent scientists, chosen by
Stanford, was formed to undertake a
review of all aspects of Hopkins Marine
Station and make recommendations for
its future.
Located on Monterey Bay, Hopkins
functions academically as part of the
Biology Department, under its own
director as a division of the University.
Although receiving funds from the
federal government and the University,
and income from its original
endowment, the station is presently
having financial difficulties.
The review committee visited
Hopkins over a week ago, and
according to the Provost's Office, parts
of its report may be released after at
least a week's time.

First of two parts
Hopkins Marine Station, Stanford's
campus by the sea, offers
undergraduates a rare chance each
spring to do their own research on an
untouched problem of marine biology,
and frequently to see their results
published or acted upon.
About 25 undergraduate students,
most of them from Stanford, have an
experience which Donald P. Abbott,
Associate Director of Hopkins,
describes as "feeling what it's like to be
a scientist."
For example, in 1969, five
undergraduate students were assigned
to investigate pollution from the
Carmel sewage outfall into Monterey
Bay. Carmel's Sanitation Engineers
claimed at the time that no pollution
was being dumped into the bay, but the
state park below the outfall claimed it
was being destroyed by the so-called
non-existent pollution.
For their spring research, the
students looked at currents, animal
distribution and tested elements of the
sewage in the laboratory, trying to ask
those questions which would be

important to local officials and the
general public.
In an open meeting at the end of the
course, to which were invited the
Sanitation Engineers and various state,
local and national officials, the students
presented their results. As a direct
result of the presentation, the
Sanitation Engineers of Carmel decided
to put up a bond issue for a complete
secondary treatment plant. The bond
issue passed—so five students can, in a
sense, take credit for the existence of a
secondary treatment plant for sewage
in Carmel.
A general field of research is chosen
for every class and the students' initial
time at the station is spent in acquiring
the background information and
research techniques critical to the
problem.
Once a student chooses a particular
topic in the area to pursue, he begins to
work closely with the professor and
graduate students most familiar with
the subject.
Each professor works with four or
five students, but "everybody is free to
consult everyone else," according to
Abbott.
The past three years, the general
topics have concerned themselves with
pollution. Much work done on DDT
and heavy metal pollution in 1968 and
1970 by undergraduates has been
published and has become a foundation
for further work and legislation.
The Hopkins course provides an
opportunity for undergraduate students
to do independent research and to
publish their results. Throughout the
history of the Hopkins Spring Course,
student research papers have been
published collectively or
independently. Early spring courses
have produced collected studies of
single marine organisms such as the
limpet or the Turbin Snail. The Turbin
Snail study has become a well-known
standard reference work.
Graduate students Jim Rote and
Bruce Tobison, alumni of the course,

described Bio 175H as a "powerful
course" that can "change the life" of a
student taking it.
Bio 175H is not the only course
offered by Hopkins. Each summer, a
set of courses is offered to
professionals, graduate students and
undergraduate students from all over
the world.
The purpose of the summer courses
is "to furnish some comprehensive
information in a field of
specialization," according to Dr.
Isabella Abbott, Research Biologist at
Hopkins.
Summer courses have been offered
in various subjects since the station's
foundation, depending upon the
availability of a qualified instructor.
The oldest courses offered are on
marine invertebrates and on algae. In
various forms they have been part of
the summer curriculum for 70 to 80
years. The newest course, offered for
the first time last year, is on the
ecology of kelp beds. This course was

the first Hopkins course to involve
students in a class diving experience.
The structure of each course is
adjusted to the teacher and to the
subject. In some cases this involves field
work every low tide period—at 4, 5, or
6 a.m. every morning for two weeks.
Some summer classes assign
problems for research, to be reported in
written or oral form. "This kind of
production necessitates a lot of
attention by faculty members" said
Abbott. There is no time in a five week
research period to make mistakes, she
explained, so students receive close
supervision.
Teaching is made more difficult by
the great difference of knowledge and
experience among the students in the
summer program. A single class might
include an undergraduate, a third year
grad student, and a high school biology
teacher attending the Hopkins summer
program for a refresher course.
Teaching needs to be adjusted to the
students, said Abbott—a difficult task
with such a variety in students.

STANFORD BY THE SEA—Students, studying marine biology, are able to do their own research at Hopkins Marine Station.
The Marine Station is in financial straits and a report to determine the relationship between the Marine station and the
University may be released soon.
Editor's note: A committee of
prominent scientists, chosen by
Stanford, was formed to undertake a
review of all aspects of Hopkins Marine
Station and make recommendations for
its future.
Located on Monterey Bay, Hopkins
functions academically as part of the
Biology Department, under its own
director as a division of the University.
Although receiving funds from the
federal government and the University,
and income from its original
endowment, the station is presently
having financial difficulties.
The review committee visited
Hopkins over a week ago, and
according to the Provost's Office, parts
of its report may be released after at
least a week's time.

First of two parts
Hopkins Marine Station, Stanford's
campus by the sea, offers
undergraduates a rare chance each
spring to do their own research on an
untouched problem of marine biology,
and frequently to see their results
published or acted upon.
About 25 undergraduate students,
most of them from Stanford, have an
experience which Donald P. Abbott,
Associate Director of Hopkins,
describes as "feeling what it's like to be
a scientist."
For example, in 1969, five
undergraduate students were assigned
to investigate pollution from the
Carmel sewage outfall into Monterey
Bay. Carmel's Sanitation Engineers
claimed at the time that no pollution
was being dumped into the bay, but the
state park below the outfall claimed it
was being destroyed by the so-called
non-existent pollution.
For their spring research, the
students looked at currents, animal
distribution and tested elements of the
sewage in the laboratory, trying to ask
those questions which would be

important to local officials and the
general public.
In an open meeting at the end of the
course, to which were invited the
Sanitation Engineers and various state,
local and national officials, the students
presented their results. As a direct
result of the presentation, the
Sanitation Engineers of Carmel decided
to put up a bond issue for a complete
secondary treatment plant. The bond
issue passed—so five students can, in a
sense, take credit for the existence of a
secondary treatment plant for sewage
in Carmel.
A general field of research is chosen
for every class and the students' initial
time at the station is spent in acquiring
the background information and
research techniques critical to the
problem.
Once a student chooses a particular
topic in the area to pursue, he begins to
work closely with the professor and
graduate students most familiar with
the subject.
Each professor works with four or
five students, but "everybody is free to
consult everyone else," according to
Abbott.
The past three years, the general
topics have concerned themselves with
pollution. Much work done on DDT
and heavy metal pollution in 1968 and
1970 by undergraduates has been
published and has become a foundation
for further work and legislation.
The Hopkins course provides an
opportunity for undergraduate students
to do independent research and to
publish their results. Throughout the
history of the Hopkins Spring Course,
student research papers have been
published collectively or
independently. Early spring courses
have produced collected studies of
single marine organisms such as the
limpet or the Turbin Snail. The Turbin
Snail study has become a well-known
standard reference work.
Graduate students Jim Rote and
Bruce Tobison, alumni of the course,

described Bio 175H as a "powerful
course" that can "change the life" of a
student taking it.
Bio 175H is not the only course
offered by Hopkins. Each summer, a
set of courses is offered to
professionals, graduate students and
undergraduate students from all over
the world.
The purpose of the summer courses
is "to furnish some comprehensive
information in a field of
specialization," according to Dr.
Isabella Abbott, Research Biologist at
Hopkins.
Summer courses have been offered
in various subjects since the station's
foundation, depending upon the
availability of a qualified instructor.
The oldest courses offered are on
marine invertebrates and on algae. In
various forms they have been part of
the summer curriculum for 70 to 80
years. The newest course, offered for
the first time last year, is on the
ecology of kelp beds. This course was

the first Hopkins course to involve
students in a class diving experience.
The structure of each course is
adjusted to the teacher and to the
subject. In some cases this involves field
work every low tide period—at 4, 5, or
6 a.m. every morning for two weeks.
Some summer classes assign
problems for research, to be reported in
written or oral form. "This kind of
production necessitates a lot of
attention by faculty members" said
Abbott. There is no time in a five week
research period to make mistakes, she
explained, so students receive close
supervision.
Teaching is made more difficult by
the great difference of knowledge and
experience among the students in the
summer program. A single class might
include an undergraduate, a third year
grad student, and a high school biology
teacher attending the Hopkins summer
program for a refresher course.
Teaching needs to be adjusted to the
students, said Abbott—a difficult task
with such a variety in students.

summer program. A single class might
include an undergraduate, a third year
grad student, and a high school biology
teacher attending the Hopkins summer
program for a refresher course.
Teaching needs to be adjusted to the
students, said Abbott—a difficult task
with such a variety in students.

STANFORD BY THE SEA—Students, studying marine biology, are able to do their own research at Hopkins Marine Station.
The Marine Station is in financial straits and a report to determine the relationship between the Marine station and the
University may be released soon.
Editor's note: A committee of
prominent scientists, chosen by
Stanford, was formed to undertake a
review of all aspects of Hopkins Marine
Station and make recommendations for
its future.
Located on Monterey Bay, Hopkins
functions academically as part of the
Biology Department, under its own
director as a division of the University.
Although receiving funds from the
federal government and the University,
and income from its original
endowment, the station is presently
having financial difficulties.
The review committee visited
Hopkins over a week ago, and
according to the Provost's Office, parts
of its report may be released after at
least a week's time.

Hopkins Marine Station, Stanford's
campus by the sea, offers
undergraduates a rare chance each
spring to do their own research on an
untouched problem of marine biology,
and frequently to see their results
published or acted upon.
About 25 undergraduate students,
most of them from Stanford, have an
experience which Donald P. Abbott,
Associate Director of Hopkins,
describes as "feeling what it's like to be
a scientist."
For example, in 1969, five
undergraduate students were assigned
to investigate pollution from the
Carmel sewage outfall into Monterey
Bay. Carmel's Sanitation Engineers
claimed at the time that no pollution
was being dumped into the bay, but the
state park below the outfall claimed it
was being destroyed by the so-called
non-existent pollution.
For their spring research, the
students looked at currents, animal
distribution and tested elements of the
sewage in the laboratory, trying to ask
those questions which would be

important to local officials and the
general public.
In an open meeting at the end of the
course, to which were invited the
Sanitation Engineers and various state,
local and national officials, the students
presented their results. As a direct
result of the presentation, the
Sanitation Engineers of Carmel decided
to put up a bond issue for a complete
secondary treatment plant. The bond
issue passed—so five students can, in a
sense, take credit for the existence of a
secondary treatment plant for sewage
in Carmel.
A general field of research is chosen
for every class and the students' initial
time at the station is spent in acquiring
the background information and
research techniques critical to the
problem.
Once a student chooses a particular
topic in the area to pursue, he begins to
work closely with the professor and
graduate students most familiar with
the subject.
Each professor works with four or
five students, but "everybody is free to
consult everyone else," according to
Abbott.
The past three years, the general
topics have concerned themselves with
pollution. Much work done on DDT
and heavy metal pollution in 1968 and
1970 by undergraduates has been
published and has become a foundation
for further work and legislation.
The Hopkins course provides an
opportunity for undergraduate students
to do independent research and to
publish their results. Throughout the
history of the Hopkins Spring Course,
student research papers have been
published collectively or
independently. Early spring courses
have produced collected studies of
single marine organisms such as the
limpet or the Turbin Snail. The Turbin
Snail study has become a well-known
standard reference work.
Graduate students Jim Rote and
Bruce Tobison, alumni of the course,

described Bio 175H as a "powerful
course" that can "change the life" of a
student taking it.
Bio 175H is not the only course
offered by Hopkins. Each summer, a
set of courses is offered to
professionals, graduate students and
undergraduate students from all over
the world.
The purpose of the summer courses
is "to furnish some comprehensive
information in a field of
specialization," according to Dr.
Isabella Abbott, Research Biologist at
Hopkins.
Summer courses have been offered
in various subjects since the station's
foundation, depending upon the
availability of a qualified instructor.
The oldest courses offered are on
marine invertebrates and on algae. In
various forms they have been part of
the summer curriculum for 70 to 80
years. The newest course, offered for
the first time last year, is on the
ecology of kelp beds. This course was

the first Hopkins course to involve
students in a class diving experience.
The structure of each course is
adjusted to the teacher and to the
subject. In some cases this involves field
work every low tide period—at 4, 5, or
6 a.m. every morning for two weeks.
Some summer classes assign
problems for research, to be reported in
written or oral form. "This kind of
production necessitates a lot of
attention by faculty members" said
Abbott. There is no time in a five week
research period to make mistakes, she
explained, so students receive close
supervision.
Teaching is made more difficult by
the great difference of knowledge and
experience among the students in the
summer program. A single class might
include an undergraduate, a third year
grad student, and a high school biology
teacher attending the Hopkins summer
program for a refresher course.
