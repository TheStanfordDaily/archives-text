# Stanford Rose Bowl Bid To Be Threatened In Suit
## 
### CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
California versus Michigan in the
Rose Bowl?
This admittedly slim possibility has
added significance to this weekend's
traditional Big Game between the
California Bears and Stanford Indians
this Saturday in Stanford Stadium.
Before the 1971 season began, the
NCAA suspended Isaac Curtis and
Larry Brumsey for violation of the 1.6
academic minimum standard. California
decided to play the ineligible athletes
despite the NCAA ruling and the Pac-8
Conference Council met to consider the
issue. On October Bth, the council
voted 5-3 to classify all of Cal's games
with conference opponents as
non-conference contests. This ruling

effectively eliminated Cal from any
chance of going to the Rose Bowl or
even significantly determining which
school would represent the conference
in the annual post-season classic at
Pasadena.
The specifics of the vote were not
announced, but Stanford declared that
it had voted against the elimination of
Cal from conference contention.
A federal court suit has been filed
against the NCAA, and the Pacific-B's
executive director Wiles Hallock
described the origin and nature of the
litigation to the Daily yesterday in an
effort to clear up confusion
surrounding the matter.
"Private attorneys for Curtis and
Brumsey have filed the suit in an effort
to obtain an injunction against the
NCAA's 1.6 rule. The University of
California is not involved with the suit
and has had no comment about it."
The case has encountered many
delays and will come up again for
consideration in two weeks. There may
be no decision for many months but
there is the possibility that a ruling
could come soon, and if the court rules
against Curtis and Brumsey, the case
would probably be appealed and
continue long past the Rose Bowl on
January 1 st.
Hallock explained the consequences
of a favorable ruling for the players. "If
they get a temporary restraining order
which would temporarily nullify the
1.6 rule, the NCAA's probation of the
players would be voided and we would
have to have a conference meeting to
consider California's status in the
conference."
"It would be up to the conference
to decide if its own ruling was at this
point pertinent."
The issue of Cal's elimination from
the Rose Bowl this season has gained
importance since Cal upset Oregon last
week to improve its record against

Pac-8 schools to 4 -2. The Indians have a
5-1 record and a loss to Cal this
Saturday would give the rivals identical
5-2 records. If the Bears had not been
suspended, their season record to date
plus a win over Stanford would've sent
them to the Rose Bowl to face
Michigan.
A Cal win on Saturday plus a quick
and favorable ruling for Curtis and
Brumsey would leave it up to the Pac-8
as to whether the Bears would be
reinstated. Hallock does not feel that
the issue can be decided for the
conference since the rulings were
separate. "Since the court action does
not enjoin the conference to reconsider
its action, it would be unlikely that the
court would order this as a condition of
the ruling."
A conference meeting would be
attended by the athletic directors and
faculty athletic representatives from
each school. The two men from each
school would combine to cast one vote
for their school. The key issue at this
meeting would be whether it would be
fair to suddenly classify all of Cal's
games as conference contests when all
of the Pac-8 schools they faced went
into the game with the understanding
that it would not count toward picking
a Rose Bowl representative.
All of this is speculation based on an
improbable series of "ifs." Hallock and
Pac-8 publicity director Bob Sprenger
were emphatic in stating, "Nothing has
changed. Stanford is our Rose Bowl
representative. There is no reason at
this time for the Pac-8 to reconsider its
October Bth ruling. Only a favorable
federal ruling for Curtis and Brumsey
could prompt us into action."
The possibility of Stanford being
supplanted as the Pac-B's Rose Bowl
entry is slim, but it does exist. The
Indians can end all speculation with a
win, however, this Saturday in the Big
Game.
