# Compromise Reached On Big Game Bonfire
## 
### WARD HEADSTROM 
Thousands of people and one large
fire will be in the dry lakebed of Lake
Lagunita next Friday night. It's been
that way for many years on the night
before Stanford's "big game" with Cal,
but it may not be that way next year.
Two recent meetings and two
subsequent compromises assured the
existence of this year's bonfire, but put
its future in doubt.
In the first meeting, bonfire
representatives and local ecology
groups, decided that an effort would be
made to make up for the bonfire's air
pollution with cutbacks in other areas.
Fraternities and other bonfire watchers
will be urged to leave their cars at home
on Thursday and' Friday and refrain
from their nightly fires in fireplaces.

Rich Dickenson, chairman of the
bonfire committee, referred to the
compromise as i "convenient cop-out"
but said, "if we take it seriously, I
think it is valid."
The Interfraternity-Council and the
Council of Presidents also reached an
agreement last week. The bonfire will
take place this year, but a student
referendum in the spring will decide the
fate of future fires.
Bonfire activities will start
Wednesday morning when the phone
company installs the framework of
telephone poles. The freshmen will
then guard the structure and drink their
beer. Thursday afternoon and Friday,
freshmen will fill the ring of poles with
wood in preparation for its ignition
between 7:30 and 8:00 p.m. Friday
night.
