## G.L.Bach Praises Nixon's New Economic Program 
### Ross Millie 
Editor's Note: George Leland Bach, professor of Economics,
was interviewed on Nixon's new economic policies by Ross
Millie, a second-year M.B.A. student. What follows is a
portion of that October 29th interview. More excerpts can be
heard on KZSU on Thursday at 7 p.m. Prof. Bach is Senior
consultant to the Federal Reserve Board and Consultant to
the Secretary of the Treasury.
Q. Many observers have said that the "new economic
game plan" was long overdue. Would you agree?
A. I find it a very reasonable position for Nixon to have
held onto his old plan as long as he did, because he and his
people . . . were and still are . . . convinced that the old one
was a sensible program. But given the realities of the
democratic process in America, it was just more than we
could tolerate to live with that amount of inflation and
unemployment. So I do not think it was grossly overdue. If
Nixon had tried it a lot sooner he would have gotten no
massive public support for it, whereas he did get very massive
public support for Phase I, and apparently there's still a lot
of public support for Phase 11.
Q. What has been your reaction to Phase I, and do you
think it has affected the country's inflationary psychology?
A. My reaction to Phase I is that it's worked amazingly
well. The main purpose of Phase I was to break the
momentum of the inflationary psychology. The massive
freeze was essentially a psychological move ... We had to
have something fairly vivid because we had an inflationary
spiral of expectations which was not slowing down very
rapidly. The whole situation, given the dynamics of modern
inflation (cost-push, then more demand in the system, then
more cost-push) was something you just had to attack
massively, and I think Nixon pulled it off well.
The American people do not like inflation a bit. They're
convinced it's a very bad thing indeed. So I think Nixon got
what he wanted, which was a real break in inflationary
psychology.
Of course he did not buy in that program any real attack
on the unemployment problem. One of the reasons is that
the administration apparently is not convinced that
unemployment is a massive problem at this point. They're
convinced that there is a gradual pick up in the economy.
They are not convinced that unemployment is so permanent
and so large that they ought to throw all the ammunition in
on that one, because to throw it in would clearly damage the
inflation fight.

Q. Would your prescriptions for Phase II have been
different from the currently emerging set of structures and
mechanisms?
A. It's clear that the whole role of Phase I was very
transitory, so the problem with Phase II is to utilize this
break in the dynamics of inflation and extend that break
long enough so that you gradually get the inflationary
expectations started on a downward path . . .
How do you bring that about? One thing you must do is
make sure your Phase II carries conviction to all parts of the
American people—labor, business, and consumers—that the
anti-inflation program will last, and that there's still some

bite in it. .. The bite must be fundamentally on wages
because it's clear from the data that they've been the real
driving force in the inflationary picture . . .
I think the sensible thing to do was to come out with a set
of wage-price guidelines... then institute them so that
they're controlling without being a mandatory set of rules in
the society ... You have to have some participation from the
major parties in the setting of these guidelines and an
enforcement process dependent heavily on the willingness of
the people to go along.
The tough part was the mechanics of how you do this. I
did not agree with what went on. I would have taken a

stronger position for some public agency to really take the
leadership in setting some*guidelines, rather than just setting
up a pay board and a price board.
It's clear that behind the scenes some very hard bargaining
went on. It was a poker game between Mr. Nixon and Mr.
Meany with very high stakes. They were playing chicken, and
Nixon was the fellow who backed down every time at first.
But he clearly couldn't give in indefinitely, he came back by
appointing five tough public numbers to the Pay Board. Now
they've come up with a tough but reasonable set of rules, and
the Labor members are pretty much committed to going
along.
Q. What are your expectations concerning the success of
President Nixon's program?
A. The efficacy of wage-price controls in the past has not
been great over long periods of time. What we've really got to
do is change the expectational patterns as a first
condition ... A lot of the real trouble we're having is due to
the fact that we've had a whole post-war period of inflation.
By and large, inflation is a way of life for modern man. I
think the success of the whole Nixon program depends very
heavily on whether he convinces the American people that
we've really changed things.
It is clear, and this is a large part of the problem, that our
aspirations have outrun our ability to perform on this whole
thing. That's been going on ever since the Keynesian
revolution of the 1930'5. We've overlearned Keynes'
lessons .. . The notion that we've got all the problems of
inflation, unemployment, business cycles, and so on licked is
a mistake. We've oversold it to the people. They've bought it
too much, partly because we in the Western world have done
relatively well with it.
Q. What are your expectations concerning the possibility
of long-run centralized control over the American capitalistic
system?
A. I think the probability is strong that we will not have
continuing substantial direct controls. If the control
apparatus is there two years from now, my prediction is that
it would be largely a sort of public information—education
kind of operation, not a control device.
It's easy to get overdramatic about this whole thing. The
recession we've been having is really scarcely visible on the
path of history. The inflation rate is high, but not
phenomenally high. So one has to have some perspective that
the system hasn't blown apart by a long ways.
