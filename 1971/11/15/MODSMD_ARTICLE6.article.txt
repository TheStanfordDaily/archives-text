# Pot Boils Over
## Freeze Puts Lid On Inflation 
### Richard Muth 
Of the measures taken to influence the
domestic economy under the President's new
"game plan," wage and price controls will have
the most important and far reaching effects.
These effects, however, are likely to be quite
different than most people anticipate.
Wage and price controls are designed as a
temporary expedient to reduce the rate of
inflation. In my judgment, they are neither
needed for this purpose nor likely to have the
desired result. I think such controls may
become permanent and result in a much
greater degree of government intervention in
individual economic decisions than has
previously existed in this country.
It is a trite but still apt analogy to compare
inflation to a pot boiling over on a stove. The
only effective way to keep a pot from boiling
over is to turn down the heat on the stove.
This is precisely what the Nixon
administration has done already by curtailing
government expenditures and by reducing the
growth rate of money stock.
However, an economic system, like a stove,
has delayed responses. There is a period of
time after the heat has been turned down
during which the pot continues to boil
vigorously.
Prior to August's wage-price freeze, the rate
of increase in prices had fallen from roughly 6
percent to 4 percent per year. Because of
inherent shortcomings, the Consumer Price
Index would probably record increases of
about 2 percent per year even if true prices
were constant. So turning down the heat had
already reduced the rate of inflation by about
half.

Largely because of impatience for quicker
results, price and wage controls were instituted
in August as a means of putting a lid on the
boiling pot. To be effective, some force must
be applied to the lid. During World War 11, in
this country, the Consumer Price Index rose
approximately 10 per cent from 1942 to 1945.
Wages, as measured by average hourly earnings
in manufacturing, rose even moreâ€”by about
20 percent over the same period. These
increases occurred despite an elaborate price
control enforcement mechanism, which the
President has said he wishes to avoid.
Thus, controls as currently contemplated
are not likely to have much effect on the rate
of inflation. Indeed, controls may be
counter-productive. Having appeared to put a
lid on the pot, the Congress in its tax and
expediture decisions and the Federal Reserve
System in its monetary actions may each feel
freer to turn up the heat on the stove once
again. The same clamor which produced the
weak form of controls initially, is likely to lead
to demands for more stringent controls as the
earlier ones prove ineffective. Programs
undertaken by government are rarely
abandoned; rather, unsuccessful ones are
frequently followed by stronger versions of the
same program. Thus I foresee a strong
likelihood that Phase I will turn out to be like
an alcoholic's first drink.
Some, no doubt, will welcome government
intervention in the setting of wages and prices
on a permanent basis. The unrestricted
workings of the market system can, in

principle, be improved upon. Yet in virtually
every case where government in this country
has intervened in individual economic
decisions on a permanent basis the results have
probably been worse than no intervention at
all.
To raise the prices of farm products, the
government has accumulated stocks of
"surplus" food products while people go
hungry, left land unused, and reduced the
productivity of farm labor, contributing to
urban growth. In the name of conservation,
timber has been allowed to rot in the forest
and our oil reserves have been used up too
rapidly. Under its urban renewal program, the
government has demolished the homes of
about a third of a million poor families and
added to their housing difficulties.
Whether it be, as some argue, that
government is responsive to the self interest of
some vaguely defined "establishment" or, as I
believe, primarily because of ignorance,
government intervention in economic life
frequently turns out quite differently than
most of us intend it should. It is indeed ironic
that a Congress which regrets one Gulf of
Tonkin resolution has written another in the
form of legislation permitting wage and price
controls largely at the discretion of the
President. And it is even more ironic that a
Republican administration with the strong
support of the business community may
inadvertently have sounded the death toll of
the free enterprise system.
