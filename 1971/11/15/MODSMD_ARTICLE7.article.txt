## Dollar Dies As International Value 
### Ron McKinnon 
Except for students, whose tuition went
up as usual, people identify August 15 th as
the day when the wage-price freeze was
implemented. The accompanying shifts in
foreign trade policy are equally important
and could signal the end of the
Bretton-Woods trading system initiated at
the end of World War 11, which was based
on the United States dollar as a settlement
currency and as an international standard
of value.
The President's formally declared end of
gold sales to foreign central banks releases
major trading countries from legal
obligations to maintain "parity" in foreign
exchange rates with their neighbors by
each pegging his currency to the dollar.
The tariff surcharge on imports into the
United States, together with restrictive
quotas on imports of textile and steel
products, weakens the obligations of other
nations not to retaliate with additional
restrictions of their own. In short, the
whole postwar movement toward greater
liberalization of trade among
nations—astonishingly successful when
measured by the standards of earlier
eras—is in jeopardy.
Because the United States is relatively
closed to foreign trade—exports are only
about 5 per cent of total output whereas in
Europe the ratio is closer to 20 or 25 per
cent—America has less to lose from a
substantial impairment of international
trade than other countries outside the
Communist bloc. Despite the fact that the
use of the dollar as an international

currency is the major cause of the U.S.
imbalance, much pressure to "do
something" about American payments
deficits over the past 12 or 14 years has
come from foreign countries who have
enjoyed a much faster growth than the
U.S. in trade abroad—a growth in fact
facilitated by foreign holdings of U.S.
dollars.
Why the paradox? First, some European
countries resent having to accumulate
reserves in dollar form under a fixed
exchange-rate regime. This acquisition of
dollars has been the counterpart of
American "deficits." Secondly,
underdeveloped countries imagined it was
possible to set up an alternative
international money—whose issue could be
designed to benefit them as a more or less
disguised form of foreign aid. (UNCTAD
advocated such a policy.) Thirdly, the use
of the dollar as an international trading
currency was thought to confer unfair
mercantile advantages to American banks
and manufacturing firms over their
international competitors. Finally, the
asymmetrical position of the center
country in being able to run deficits,
without having or being able to adjust its
exchange rate unilaterally, seemed to give
the United States too much external
freedom of action.
Although foreign resentment—not
always rational—against the dollar standard
has been simmering for two decades, it was
brought to a boil when the standard itself
became unstable, due to aggravated

unemployment and inflation resulting from
the Vietnam War in the American
economy.
Quixotically, the American government
itself may have joined the detractors of the
international dollar system and seems
willing to explore the possiblity of
introducing more economic symmetry
among nations.
The administration has become
convinced that the over valuation of the
dollar vis-a-vis the currencies of Japan,
Germany, France, Britain, etc. has
contributed to the rapid rise in imports and
accompanying unemployment in this
country. Having our own exchange rate to
adjust (devalue)—an option not presently
open to us—would let us better protect our
commercial interests according to
mercantilist politics. Such a change
requires that the dollar no longer be the
center currency to which all others are
pegged—at rates they decide and not us.
Finally, the unregulated international
market for money—the Eurodollar
market—is felt by some to subvert the
operations of the American central
bank—the Federal Reserve System.
Many detractors and few defenders. One
would think that the dollar standard would
soon be replaced. But the technical
problems of setting up an alternative
international money have proven difficult.
Nobody wants to resurrect the barbarous
relic gold—except the South Africans and
possibly the French. No other national
currency is a conceivable substitute except

possibly the Deutschmark— and Germany
has suffered from two hyperinflations in
this century. It is difficult to legislate a
purely international money under the aegis
of the International Monetary Fund when
that agency has no real political strength.
Somehow the world still needs an
international money in order to avoid
inconvertibility among national currencies.
Like Lazarus, a resurrected dollar
standard seems the most likely solution.
After a round of discrete appreciations by
major European countries as well as
Canada and Japan against the dollar,
exchange-parities will probably be
redefined in dollar items—albeit with more
systematic flexibility to make continuous
rate changes than has existed in the past.
Again the dollar would be the central
currency, again without the United States
having continuous freedom to change its
own exchange rate.
Hopefully, the American government
could then shed its neo-mercantilism and
resume its liberal policy of benign neglect
towards international payments flows—a
policy which worked so well from the end
of the Marshall Plan to the early 1960'5.
While perhaps not politically satisfactory,
this limited tinkering with the dollar
system is probably sufficient to make it
non-exploitive and quite efficient in an
economic sense provided that inflation is
halted and full employment is restored in
the United States.

each pegging his currency to the dollar.
The tariff surcharge on imports into the
United States, together with restrictive
quotas on imports of textile and steel
products, weakens the obligations of other
nations not to retaliate with additional
restrictions of their own. In short, the
whole postwar movement toward greater
liberalization of trade among
nations—astonishingly successful when
measured by the standards of earlier
eras—is in jeopardy.
Because the United States is relatively
closed to foreign trade—exports are only
about 5 per cent of total output whereas in
Europe the ratio is closer to 20 or 25 per
cent—America has less to lose from a
substantial impairment of international
trade than other countries outside the
Communist bloc. Despite the fact that the
use of the dollar as an international

currency is the major cause of the U.S.
imbalance, much pressure to "do
something" about American payments
deficits over the past 12 or 14 years has
come from foreign countries who have
enjoyed a much faster growth than the
U.S. in trade abroad—a growth in fact
facilitated by foreign holdings of U.S.
dollars.
Why the paradox? First, some European
countries resent having to accumulate
reserves in dollar form under a fixed
exchange-rate regime. This acquisition of
dollars has been the counterpart of
American "deficits." Secondly,
underdeveloped countries imagined it was
possible to set up an alternative
international money—whose issue could be
designed to benefit them as a more or less
disguised form of foreign aid. (UNCTAD
advocated such a policy.) Thirdly, the use
of the dollar as an international trading
currency was thought to confer unfair
mercantile advantages to American banks
and manufacturing firms over their
international competitors. Finally, the
asymmetrical position of the center
country in being able to run deficits,
without having or being able to adjust its
exchange rate unilaterally, seemed to give
the United States too much external
freedom of action.
Although foreign resentment—not
always rational—against the dollar standard
has been simmering for two decades, it was
brought to a boil when the standard itself
became unstable, due to aggravated

unemployment and inflation resulting from
the Vietnam War in the American
economy.
Quixotically, the American government
itself may have joined the detractors of the
international dollar system and seems
willing to explore the possiblity of
introducing more economic symmetry
among nations.
The administration has become
convinced that the over valuation of the
dollar vis-a-vis the currencies of Japan,
Germany, France, Britain, etc. has
contributed to the rapid rise in imports and
accompanying unemployment in this
country. Having our own exchange rate to
adjust (devalue)—an option not presently
open to us—would let us better protect our
commercial interests according to
mercantilist politics. Such a change
requires that the dollar no longer be the
center currency to which all others are
pegged—at rates they decide and not us.
Finally, the unregulated international
market for money—the Eurodollar
market—is felt by some to subvert the
operations of the American central
bank—the Federal Reserve System.
Many detractors and few defenders. One
would think that the dollar standard would
soon be replaced. But the technical
problems of setting up an alternative
international money have proven difficult.
Nobody wants to resurrect the barbarous
relic gold—except the South Africans and
possibly the French. No other national
currency is a conceivable substitute except

possibly the Deutschmark— and Germany
has suffered from two hyperinflations in
this century. It is difficult to legislate a
purely international money under the aegis
of the International Monetary Fund when
that agency has no real political strength.
Somehow the world still needs an
international money in order to avoid
inconvertibility among national currencies.
Like Lazarus, a resurrected dollar
standard seems the most likely solution.
After a round of discrete appreciations by
major European countries as well as
Canada and Japan against the dollar,
exchange-parities will probably be
redefined in dollar items—albeit with more
systematic flexibility to make continuous
rate changes than has existed in the past.
Again the dollar would be the central
currency, again without the United States
having continuous freedom to change its
own exchange rate.
Hopefully, the American government
could then shed its neo-mercantilism and
resume its liberal policy of benign neglect
towards international payments flows—a
policy which worked so well from the end
of the Marshall Plan to the early 1960'5.
While perhaps not politically satisfactory,
this limited tinkering with the dollar
system is probably sufficient to make it
non-exploitive and quite efficient in an
economic sense provided that inflation is
halted and full employment is restored in
the United States.

cent—America has less to lose from a
substantial impairment of international
trade than other countries outside the
Communist bloc. Despite the fact that the
use of the dollar as an international

currency is the major cause of the U.S.
imbalance, much pressure to "do
something" about American payments
deficits over the past 12 or 14 years has
come from foreign countries who have
enjoyed a much faster growth than the
U.S. in trade abroad—a growth in fact
facilitated by foreign holdings of U.S.
dollars.
Why the paradox? First, some European
countries resent having to accumulate
reserves in dollar form under a fixed
exchange-rate regime. This acquisition of
dollars has been the counterpart of
American "deficits." Secondly,
underdeveloped countries imagined it was
possible to set up an alternative
international money—whose issue could be
designed to benefit them as a more or less
disguised form of foreign aid. (UNCTAD
advocated such a policy.) Thirdly, the use
of the dollar as an international trading
currency was thought to confer unfair
mercantile advantages to American banks
and manufacturing firms over their
international competitors. Finally, the
asymmetrical position of the center
country in being able to run deficits,
without having or being able to adjust its
exchange rate unilaterally, seemed to give
the United States too much external
freedom of action.
Although foreign resentment—not
always rational—against the dollar standard
has been simmering for two decades, it was
brought to a boil when the standard itself
became unstable, due to aggravated

unemployment and inflation resulting from
the Vietnam War in the American
economy.
Quixotically, the American government
itself may have joined the detractors of the
international dollar system and seems
willing to explore the possiblity of
introducing more economic symmetry
among nations.
The administration has become
convinced that the over valuation of the
dollar vis-a-vis the currencies of Japan,
Germany, France, Britain, etc. has
contributed to the rapid rise in imports and
accompanying unemployment in this
country. Having our own exchange rate to
adjust (devalue)—an option not presently
open to us—would let us better protect our
commercial interests according to
mercantilist politics. Such a change
requires that the dollar no longer be the
center currency to which all others are
pegged—at rates they decide and not us.
Finally, the unregulated international
market for money—the Eurodollar
market—is felt by some to subvert the
operations of the American central
bank—the Federal Reserve System.
Many detractors and few defenders. One
would think that the dollar standard would
soon be replaced. But the technical
problems of setting up an alternative
international money have proven difficult.
Nobody wants to resurrect the barbarous
relic gold—except the South Africans and
possibly the French. No other national
currency is a conceivable substitute except

possibly the Deutschmark— and Germany
has suffered from two hyperinflations in
this century. It is difficult to legislate a
purely international money under the aegis
of the International Monetary Fund when
that agency has no real political strength.
Somehow the world still needs an
international money in order to avoid
inconvertibility among national currencies.
Like Lazarus, a resurrected dollar
standard seems the most likely solution.
After a round of discrete appreciations by
major European countries as well as
Canada and Japan against the dollar,
exchange-parities will probably be
redefined in dollar items—albeit with more
systematic flexibility to make continuous
rate changes than has existed in the past.
Again the dollar would be the central
currency, again without the United States
having continuous freedom to change its
own exchange rate.
Hopefully, the American government
could then shed its neo-mercantilism and
resume its liberal policy of benign neglect
towards international payments flows—a
policy which worked so well from the end
of the Marshall Plan to the early 1960'5.
While perhaps not politically satisfactory,
this limited tinkering with the dollar
system is probably sufficient to make it
non-exploitive and quite efficient in an
economic sense provided that inflation is
halted and full employment is restored in
the United States.

Except for students, whose tuition went
up as usual, people identify August 15 th as
the day when the wage-price freeze was
implemented. The accompanying shifts in
foreign trade policy are equally important
and could signal the end of the
Bretton-Woods trading system initiated at
the end of World War 11, which was based
on the United States dollar as a settlement
currency and as an international standard
of value.
The President's formally declared end of
gold sales to foreign central banks releases
major trading countries from legal
obligations to maintain "parity" in foreign
exchange rates with their neighbors by
each pegging his currency to the dollar.
The tariff surcharge on imports into the
United States, together with restrictive
quotas on imports of textile and steel
products, weakens the obligations of other
nations not to retaliate with additional
restrictions of their own. In short, the
whole postwar movement toward greater
liberalization of trade among
nations—astonishingly successful when
measured by the standards of earlier
eras—is in jeopardy.
Because the United States is relatively
closed to foreign trade—exports are only
about 5 per cent of total output whereas in
Europe the ratio is closer to 20 or 25 per
cent—America has less to lose from a
substantial impairment of international
trade than other countries outside the
Communist bloc. Despite the fact that the
