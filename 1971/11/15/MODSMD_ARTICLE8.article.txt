# Widespread Support
## America Welcomes Freeze 
### Paul Cootner 
The Nixon wage-price freeze
announced on August 15 th, was
received with a popular acclaim
that has been accorded to very
few Presidential proposals in the
last seven years. Most workers,
unionized or not, enthusiastically
welcomed the initiative. Business
men were so strong in their praise
that many lept to attack their
fellow executives who maintained
the more conventional antagonism
to governmental controls.
This rare unanimity arose from
the unpopularity of the recent
inflation, plus a growing
discontent with the more
conventional economic
prescriptions. Labor and its

friends laid the inflation to
monopolistic pricing practices of
Big Business. Executives and the
white collar class placed the blame
on exorbitant wage settlements.
Either party was willing to absorb
some temporary inconvenience
because each was conviced that
most of the burden of "fair"
controls would fall on the other.
The immediate result of the
proposals was a 10 % rise in prices
and a widespread euphoria. More
recently, however, some of this
mood is turning a little sour as the
various parties lose their faith that
the main burden will fall on the
"real villain"—the other guy.
But the burden will not fall on
"the other guy" unless the
popular theories of inflation are
correct: That the other guy is a
monopolist who can easily be
forced to give up his
"unreasonable" wage or price
increase without imposing
shortages or discomfort on
anyone else.
Doubts Raised
My doubts about the efficacy
of the freeze arise from three
premises.
1. While there are substantial
non-competitive elements in the
U.S. economy the element of real
monopoly is quite small.
2. Unless there is substantial
monopoly power, controls—to the
extent they actually have an
produce shortages.
3. Shortages require some
mechanism for allocating the
scarce goods resulting in either a
rationing bureaucracy or a huge
enforcement bureaucracy and a
very detailed intervention in
economic activity—something the
Administration has said it will not
impose.
If this chain of logic is faultless,
the wage-price freeze will prove
ineffective or very unpopular.
I think that the Nixon
Administration really shares my
view of the ineffectiveness of a
prolonged freeze. This reveals
itself in the current promulgations
of the wage and price boards
which are so full of loopholes that
they clearly are designed to
discreetly lift the controls except
over the limited areas of the
economy where monopoly power
is presumed to exist. It was never
believed that controls would work
for long without the imposition of

an undesired bureaucracy.
The wage-price freeze was
imposed for two quite different
"political" reasons; one domestic,
one foreign. The domestic reason
was simple—regardless of its
efficacy, controls were popular at
the time as a means of
superficially conciliating the
popular outcries for stopping
inflation and eliminating
unemployment promptly. Nixon's
economists were telling him that
the steps already taken would
soon achieve price stability and a
rise in employment—if they were
right, the popular move would
appear to produce success. If they
were wrong he would have bought
three month relief from public
outrage.
International Aspects
The international aspects may
have been much more important.
Ten, even five, years ago the
possiblity of a U.S.
develuation—bankruptcy some
called it—stimulated rage and fear
in U.S. nationalists. Yet one
hardly hears the subject
mentioned today, now that it has
occurred, outside of the narrow
circles directly affected. The
previously hot issue has been
defused by the popular wage-price
freeze, plus some nationalistic
sloganeering about how we were
getting back at the foreigners who
had been victimizing us.
Overseas, the freeze served to
assure foreigners that we intended
to reverse our international
economic weakness. From the
view of international ritual,
wage-price freeze is a symbol of
determination to manage one's
affairs better in the future.
If my view is correct, we will
see a gradual withering away of
the freeze in the next six months
until it becomes "jawbone"
controls, much like we saw in the
Kennedy Administration. In that
same period the basic inflationary
forces will also gradually dissipate.
If, however, I am wrong and basic
inflationary forces continue at the
old rate, the control mechanism
will either be widely evaded or it
will have to give way to rationing
and detailed controls just before
election time—not a very palatable
prospect for a Presidential
nominee.

inflationary forces continue at the
old rate, the control mechanism
will either be widely evaded or it
will have to give way to rationing
and detailed controls just before
election time—not a very palatable
prospect for a Presidential
nominee.
Prof. Paul Cootner is a C.O.G.
Professor of Finance.
The Nixon wage-price freeze
announced on August 15 th, was
received with a popular acclaim
that has been accorded to very
few Presidential proposals in the
last seven years. Most workers,
unionized or not, enthusiastically
welcomed the initiative. Business
men were so strong in their praise
that many lept to attack their
fellow executives who maintained
the more conventional antagonism
to governmental controls.
This rare unanimity arose from
the unpopularity of the recent
inflation, plus a growing
discontent with the more
conventional economic
prescriptions. Labor and its

friends laid the inflation to
monopolistic pricing practices of
Big Business. Executives and the
white collar class placed the blame
on exorbitant wage settlements.
Either party was willing to absorb
some temporary inconvenience
because each was conviced that
most of the burden of "fair"
controls would fall on the other.
The immediate result of the
proposals was a 10 % rise in prices
and a widespread euphoria. More
recently, however, some of this
mood is turning a little sour as the
various parties lose their faith that
the main burden will fall on the
"real villain"—the other guy.
But the burden will not fall on
"the other guy" unless the
popular theories of inflation are
correct: That the other guy is a
monopolist who can easily be
forced to give up his
"unreasonable" wage or price
increase without imposing
shortages or discomfort on
anyone else.
Doubts Raised
My doubts about the efficacy
of the freeze arise from three
premises.
1. While there are substantial
non-competitive elements in the
U.S. economy the element of real
monopoly is quite small.
2. Unless there is substantial
monopoly power, controls—to the
extent they actually have an
produce shortages.
3. Shortages require some
mechanism for allocating the
scarce goods resulting in either a
rationing bureaucracy or a huge
enforcement bureaucracy and a
very detailed intervention in
economic activity—something the
Administration has said it will not
impose.
If this chain of logic is faultless,
the wage-price freeze will prove
ineffective or very unpopular.
I think that the Nixon
Administration really shares my
view of the ineffectiveness of a
prolonged freeze. This reveals
itself in the current promulgations
of the wage and price boards
which are so full of loopholes that
they clearly are designed to
discreetly lift the controls except
over the limited areas of the
economy where monopoly power
is presumed to exist. It was never
believed that controls would work
for long without the imposition of

an undesired bureaucracy.
The wage-price freeze was
imposed for two quite different
"political" reasons; one domestic,
one foreign. The domestic reason
was simple—regardless of its
efficacy, controls were popular at
the time as a means of
superficially conciliating the
popular outcries for stopping
inflation and eliminating
unemployment promptly. Nixon's
economists were telling him that
the steps already taken would
soon achieve price stability and a
rise in employment—if they were
right, the popular move would
appear to produce success. If they
were wrong he would have bought
three month relief from public
outrage.
International Aspects
The international aspects may
have been much more important.
Ten, even five, years ago the
possiblity of a U.S.
develuation—bankruptcy some
called it—stimulated rage and fear
in U.S. nationalists. Yet one
hardly hears the subject
mentioned today, now that it has
occurred, outside of the narrow
circles directly affected. The
previously hot issue has been
defused by the popular wage-price
freeze, plus some nationalistic
sloganeering about how we were
getting back at the foreigners who
had been victimizing us.
Overseas, the freeze served to
assure foreigners that we intended
to reverse our international
economic weakness. From the
view of international ritual,
wage-price freeze is a symbol of
determination to manage one's
affairs better in the future.
If my view is correct, we will
see a gradual withering away of
the freeze in the next six months
until it becomes "jawbone"
controls, much like we saw in the
Kennedy Administration. In that
same period the basic inflationary
forces will also gradually dissipate.
If, however, I am wrong and basic
inflationary forces continue at the
old rate, the control mechanism
will either be widely evaded or it

If my view is correct, we will
see a gradual withering away of
the freeze in the next six months
until it becomes "jawbone"
controls, much like we saw in the
Kennedy Administration. In that
same period the basic inflationary
forces will also gradually dissipate.
If, however, I am wrong and basic
inflationary forces continue at the
old rate, the control mechanism
will either be widely evaded or it
will have to give way to rationing
and detailed controls just before
election time—not a very palatable
prospect for a Presidential
nominee.
