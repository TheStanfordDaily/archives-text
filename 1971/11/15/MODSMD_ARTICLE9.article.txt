# Freezing Unemployment
## Government Steps In 
### Mark Venezia 
Phase II of Nixon's price and
rage controls, if effective, will
•use serious problems of resource
olsallocation. But if the
overnment ignores quality
hanges and clamps down
specially hard on industries
ontributing to its price indices,
re may see a temporary decline in
nflation as measured by this data.
Of course, effectively outlawing
hanges in government statistics
ould be achieved much less
«infully by issuing special
lirectives to the survey-takers
/ho compile them. So it is not
ur prising that even some
•oliticians have found it necessary
o come up with other reasons for
upporting controls.
Arguments for controls usually
all into one of two categories.
Either permanent controls and
uidelines are necessary to halt
he phenomena of "cost-push"
fiflation, or temporary controls
re needed to halt inflationary
xpectations.
The presence of excessive
nemployment is supposed to
•rove that today's price inflation
$ not being caused by excessive
lemand but by the monopoly
•ower of big business and
rganized labor.
Even to the extent that this
rgument is valid—it does not
how that controls will remedy
ur problems. Government
itervention in the labor market,
o help various organized interest
roups restrict the supply of
idividuals competing for their
ositions, definitely increases the
verage amount of time people
pend searching for jobs. So an
icrease in this monopoly power
rill cause an increase in the
nemployment rate.
But where are these increases in
larket power? Has there been a
ramatic rise in industry
oncentration or union power
ver the last three or four years?
ire we expected to believe that
nions have been holding back on
leir power to restrict labor
jpplies until recently?
Only the monopoly powers of
overnment itself seem to make
ew gains every year.
Any price or wage control will
snd to limit market competition,
ut the Phase II directives seem
(most designed to bring about
idustrial concentration. Firms
iVe been ordered to keep profits
•ozen as a percentage of sales. If
n industry is not faced with
icpanding demand, how can a
rm increase its earnings without
icreasing its market share?
That controls will decrease
iflationary expectations is very
ebatable. They are more likely to

have the opposite effect. In the
spirit of the freeze, monetary
authorities may forget about price
stability and expand the money
supply to cut interest rates in the
short run.
The public, believing that
controls are not permanent, may
act as if prices will run up when
the "phases" run out. Indeed this
type of consumer confidence was
anticipated. It was assumed that
the freeze would contribute to
aggregate demand.
Even the simple faith that
temporary gains will be made by
outlawing inflation are
unfounded. Wage and price
controls are difficult to enforce.
Like other laws restricting trade
between freely consenting adults,
they are often ignored. Rational
people do not take seriously
proclamations that they are
committing crimes without
victims.
Earlier this month the San
Francisco Chronicle spot
checked 18 stores for compliance
with the freeze. They were met
with surprise and hostility. Many
small stores knew nothing of the
rule.
For businesses, the more
complex the combination of
goods, services and information
they sell, the easier it is to
deteriorate the quality of one
item of the bundle, keeping the
price frozen. Advertising,
customer service, prompt
delivery—the many costs which
made price hikes possible in the
past—can be adjusted downward.
There are large areas of retail
trade, including car sales, where
the list prices, only occasionally
used in the past, will give retailers
plenty of upward price flexibility.
Then there's "wage drift." Real
wage and salary competition in
the form of better working
conditions, job security, fewer
hours, and other fringe benefits to
attract labor to expanding
industries. And like the "new"
product, the new job has no base
price.
Unfortunately the many
mechanisms of control evasion are
rather expensive to use, nor will
they be able to do the entire job
of adjusting production to new
conditions of relative demand. If
the method of changing the
quality of labor and product units
at controlled prices fails, then
shortages, blacker markets and

non-price rationing mechanisms
will have to develop.
Roger W. Spencer, in the
September 1971 issue of the St.
Louis Federal Reserve Bank's
Review puts forward a general
theory of unemployment.
Underlying all unemployment "is
the fact that job information and
relocation costs are positive."
From this base he analyzes the
structural and frictional sources of
"normal" unemployment.
Legislative reform removing
government-enforced monopolies
from labor markets is the only
costless way to cut this normal
rate. Controls distorting the price
system and thus increasing the
cost of accurate information on
expected wages won't help.
Monetary expansion can
produce temporary cuts in
unemployment as long as its
stimulation of aggregate demand
is unanticipated. When
inflationary policies are
abandoned after many years,
people, using the cheap
information of the recent past,
need time to adjust prices to new
demand conditions. Job seekers
using this same information will
continue to search for jobs that
do not exist at wages they expect.
Wage and price controls will
not cut the costs of information
needed by employers and job
seekers to adjust to new demand
conditions; they will not solve the
problem of inflation with
excessive unemployment. Only
time and monetary stability will.
