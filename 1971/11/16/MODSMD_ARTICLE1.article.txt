# Hopkins Offers Opportunities In Various Bio Fields

### CAROL GREENE (Second of two parts) 
Hopkins Marine Station is known and respected throughout
the world for its contributions to the biological sciences.
Approximately one-third of all graduate students in
Biology at Stanford receive their Ph.D.'s from Hopkins Marine
Station—but Hopkins has less than one-sixth of the total
faculty of the Biology Department.
Usually 18 to 22 graduate students work at Hopkins each
year, along with four or five faculty members and four or five
visiting investigators. Their research is carried on in many
different areas of biology, from the effects of certain toxins to
investigation of and descriptions of a single marine animal.
Much of the research also concerns itself with environmental
problems or ecology.
Hopkins researchers not only study environmental
problems, but, according to Dr. John Phillips, director of
Hopkins, "assist in decision making in government as concerns
the environment." Three graduate students and Dr. Phillips
serve on committees of the Monterey Bay experimental pilot
monitoring program—a model for a California system of
monitoring environmentally harmful materials.
Other Hopkins faculty members serve in various local, state
and national capacities. Faculty members of the Hopkins

Station have testified before the legislature in connection with
pollution legislation, and, according to Dr. Phillips, "many
state and federal agencies ask for advice and opinions" from
Hopkins faculty and graduate students.
Internationally Renown
Hopkins is active internationally as well as nationally.
Visiting investigators and summer students come from many
different countries, including England, Japan and Yugoslavia.
Joint investigation programs have been carried out with other
countries. A program of combined research with a Yugoslavian
institute is currently being planned.
Not all investigators come from distant countries. Some
come from the Stanford Campus—including a husband and
wife team—the Furhmans from the Stanford Medical Center.
Drs. Furham began work on the effects of certain toxins at the
Stanford Med Center, but found the research "couldn't be
done at the Med Center," and that it was advisable to work at
a marine station.
It's a "good thing that Stanford has a marine station for
people like us" they said. The Furhmans have worked at
Hopkins before, using simple marine animals to solve basic
problems in physiology and pharmacology so that more
detailed studies could be made on higher animals.
Interaction between biology and medicine is important to

the Furhmans. Biologists at the station can assist them in
identification and classification of marine animals for medical
research. Other researchers note the importance of
interdisciplinary interaction in Hopkins. Dr. Welton Lee, for
example, cited the "tremendous interplay across disciplines of
different ideas, backgrounds and different approaches to the
same problem."
This inter-disciplinary exchange is of especially great
importance to graduate students. According to Sam Johnson,
graduate student, "people from Hopkins receive a wider
introduction to and experience in problems of biology."
Hopkins graduate students are given training and
experience in all phases of research. In the oceanography
program, students are involved in ship design, conversion, the
designing and conducting of research, the running of the ship
and the designing of the equipment.
Impressive Placement Record
Graduate students at Hopkins are "forced to become more
self-reliant." This broader training may account for the
"impressive" post-graduate placement of Hopkins graduates in
the most prestigous research institutes and government
agencies.
Another impressive list at Hopkins is a list of emerti.
Former professors at Hopkins include C.B. Van Niel,
microbiologist noted for work on micro-organisms and

photosynthesis, Dr. Lawrence R. Clinks, plant physiologist
and former director of the National Academy of Science, and
Dr. Rolf Bolin, icthyologist, who did pioneer work in keys by
which mid water and deep sea fishes could be identified.
Hopkin's Personality
"Hopkins Marine Station has a personality—new people
come in, and the station maintains its personality" says Bruce
Robison, a graduate studer* at Hopkins. It is this atmosphere
which makes Hopkins a unique and exciting place to work and
learn.
The "personality" of the station consists of many
factors—of a long tradition of resear hand achievement, of a
close working relationship between teachers, researchers and
students and of many others.
Working at Hopkins holds different advantages for different
people, but all agree that it is one of the most rewarding
experiences at Stanford University. In the words of one
Stanford undergraduate, there is a "widespread, totally
positive response" to the Hopkins programs among students
who have taken courses there.
Letters received by the Station when the pending
committee investigation of Hopkins was announced reinforce
the students' opinion. Letters were received from all over the
world in support of the Hopkins programs from present and
former students, researchers and teachers.
