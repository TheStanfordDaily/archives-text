Enforcing Lyman's Rules
Editor, THE DAILY:
President Lyman has at various
times issued rules governing
political conduct at Stanford.
We are by no means in
agreement with Lyman's rules.
But we feel that a test case has
come up which will show whether
Lyman will apply these rules
across the board.
These rules are now apparently
being violated by people who
should know better-officials of
the student government—and
Lyman who is in close and
personal contact with these
individuals, should know better
than to allow these violations to
continue. (Jim Siena, call your
office.)
First, selections from the rules
(quoted from Campus Report,
July 22, 1970):
"2. No University
office... should be used as a
return mailing address for the
solicitation of funds for political
purposes. .. "
"4. University duplicating
machines,. .. telephones, or other
equipment or supplies may not be
used for political or other
non-University purposes, nor may
any office employee or other
employee of the University be
asked to perform tasks in any way
related to political activities while
on regular duty."
"5. University space and
facilities may not be used in any
manner inconsistent with the
foregoing. .. "
"Regarding number 2
above,. . . no University telephone
extension may be used for similar
solicitations."
Second, selections from the
violations:
A letter postmarked November
11 asks the addressee to join Pete
McCloskey and A 1 Lowenstein at a
fund-raising cocktail party.
"Admission is $5.00 per head;
drinks are $1.00 apiece." The
fund-raising letter is promoting a
November 18 conference for new
voters which "will focus on
encouraging young people to
register, vote, and work for
campaigns of candidates pleged to
ending the war immediately and
turning the country around"
(emphasis added).
The letter concludes: "Checks
in advance can be made payable
to the Association of Student
Governments, c/o Larry Diamond,
Assoc. Students Stanford
University, Box 205, Tresidder
Memorial Union. . ."
At the bottom of the letter,
the telephone number (415)
321-2300 (Ext. 4331) is given.
This is a Stanford University
extension.
Similarly, a reproduction of a
San Francisco Chronicle article
enclosed with the fund-raising
letter has printed at the bottom:
"Call 321-2300—Ext. 4331 to
Help."
The press release put out by
the conference organizers has at
the top the words: "Further
Information Contact Michael
Barrett 415-321-2300, ext.
4331."
The press release notes that
"the movement will demand
representaiton in the delegate
slates of all candidates contending
for the presidential (sic)
nomination on the California
primary."
A letter dated November 7 and
signed Michael Barrett points out
that the conference has as its
ultimate purpose the organization
of "a 'dump Nixon' drive in
northern California."
This letter says: "Our number
is 415-321-2300, x 4331 and we
are working in the student
government offices, Tresidder
Union, Stanford."
In summary, we have a
political organization of corporate
liberals (of roughly the same
political perspective as President
Lyman) working in a University
building, using a University
building as a return address in

soliciting funds, using a University
telephone extension to conduct
political business, urging voters to
vote and work for candidates with
an anti-war foreign policy and a
corporate liberal domestic policy,
trying to inject their adherents
into political party nominating
conventions, and holding a thinly
disguised Youth for McCloskey
(McGovern) conference.
Furthermore, "Youth
Politics," the McCloskey
presidential campaign, and other
similar off-campus political
organizations intended to use
university facilities for political
rallies, in violation of University
Presidential edicts and University
rules.

With Friends Like That. . .
Editor, THE DAILY:
The members of the German
department seem to believe that I
object to their supporting
Professor Franklin. Quite the
contrary. What I suggested in my
letter was that their support might
prove more of a liability than an
asset to Professor Franklin, since
their claims on his behalf seemed
to be self-defeating. No cause is
strengthened by having bad
arguments put forward in its
favor. It seems quite possible that
Professor Franklin may have more
to fear from his defenders than
from his accusers.
The rather angry rejoinder
(Daily, Nov. 12) confirms my
initial criticism. There is a strong
reassertion of the right to support
Professor Franklin—which I never
questioned. There is still no
apparent concern for the
difference between good
arguments and bad ones.
There is no concern for
accuracy—witness the assertion
that the Advisory Board is
"Administrative-constituted",
whereas in fact the Advisory
Board is elected by the faculty.
And there is a rejection of the
legitimacy of debate. The writers
now say that to question or
criticize their published views is to
deny their "right to speak out."
This implies that while they are
free to attack others, any critical
response is an act of repression.
What emerges is less an
argument than a kind of ritual
incantation, directed at "true
believers" but offering nothing to
those who think that the issues in
the Franklin case call for careful
and critical judgment. Of course,
they are free to talk any way they
wish. But their audience is free to
be disenchanted.

Male Chauvinist Pigs
Open letter to the Band, via THE
DAILY:

Shit! Of course you guys are male
chauvinist pigs. Why deny it? Or
pretend you don't like being
called M.C.P.'s?
There is enough room in the
world for funny, crass, gross,
frantic, wierd male chauvinist pigs
who toot instruments. What I
can't understand is how there is so
little room in your world for
funny, crass, gross, frantic wierd
women who toot instruments.
As for separate sleeping
quarters—who are you trying to
kid, anyway? Of course, this
whole thing won't really get
tested until some funny, crass,
gross, frantic wierd sisters figure
out that they belong in the band.
And when that happens, your
vote will be about as significant as
the "Whites Only" signs over the
bathroom doors in Alabama.
And you guys will just have to
figure out a comfortable way to
sit at the back of the bus, too.
Until then, peace, but how 'bout
cutting out that liberal drivel of
"Sure its coming, but we don't
want them moving in so fast." It
didn't sound so good in the South
in the 60's and it still doesn't
sound so good at Stanford in the
70's.

"Official" Student Policy?
Editor, THE DAILY:
An opinion poll does not
create a "policy." Even if it did
more than 50% of the electorate
would have to turn out in order to
prove that the majority wanted a
policy one way or the other. That
didn't happen for the referendum
on recruiting. But it did happen
for another referendum.
That referendum was on
ROTC. Now, as seriously as Mr.
Diamond takes himself and the
status of official "student
policies" I am sure he will devote
every effort to implement the
"student policy" on ROTC, which
the administration has refused to
enact. The majority voting wanted
ROTC on campus without credit.
C'mon Larry, rip us a
demonstration!
