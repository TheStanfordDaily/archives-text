# Multi-Lingual Tutoring Crows
## 
### 
A unique linguistics program
here which supplies multi-lingual
tutors for minority students in
Stanford-area schools is well into
Its second year.
Funded and sponsored by the
University Fellows Innovation
Fund, it is taught by Andrew D.
Cohen, a teaching fellow in
linguistics.
Since its inception last fall, the
program has grown from 3 3
Stanford tutors serving 61
elementary and secondary school
pupils to last spring's total of 4 9
tutors serving 96 pupils.
The number of schools using
Stanford student services grew
from 16 to 21 in districts
adjoining the University. The
number of districts expressing
interest grew from six to 10.
Cohen believes that his
two-quarter, six-unit course is
unique to Stanford. "I don't

believe there's one like it in any
other American university"
offering "undergraduates practice
tutoring in English as second
language."
The course, titled Linguistics
110, has proceeded by trial and
error, but now has settled into
one month of training, followed
by a quarter and a half of actual
on-site tutoring.
The age range of tutees runs
from pre-schoolers to adults in the
mid-30 's.
