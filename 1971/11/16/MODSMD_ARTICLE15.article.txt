# Donizetti's 'Maria Stuarda An Operatic Conflagration
## 
### GARY SCHMIDGALL 
Two imperious queens, with
imperial voices to match turned
the S.F. Opera's American stage
premiere of Donizetti's "Maria
Stuarda" on Friday into a
conflagration of vocal fireworks.
Indeed, most of the other values
in this bel canto feast, and there
aren't many, were consumed in the
fiery battle of wits and voices
between Queen Elizabeth and
Mary, Queen of Scots.
While Mozart is crystallizing
human passions and Verdi is
tearing them to tatters,
Donizetti's habit is to translate
these passions into facades of
ear-filling vocal arabesques.
Though his set-piece arias have
thoroughly two-dimensional
quality, they still possess a
towering heroic musical vision of
human nature. Donizetti's music
has a gothic immensity which, to
modern ears, may seem merely
grotesque and self-indulgent. But
the Romantics, opera composers
included, were nothing if not
self-indulgent.
The trick, then, with Romantic
music, especially Romantic opera
like "Maria Stuarda," is to
transform mere self-indulgence
through spiritual fervor and
virtuosity into something which
transcends. Shelly expressed the
Romantic ideal in "Adonais:"
A godlike mind soars forth, in
its delight
Making earth bare and veiling
heaven.. .
And since the Romantics listened
so closely to the inner voice, it
should not surprise that their
operas count upon godlike voices
which soar forth and make earth
seem a little bare.
Joan Sutherland, as Mary, is
one of those few singers who has
the power to approach this
Romantic ideal. Her voice truly
soars, and when she is not falling
into her occasional habit of pallid
detachment, she can give a
stunning performance. Such was
the case in this "Maria." Her
staggering ability to catapult the
most pedestrian melodic material,
her gleaming voice and — lest we
forget - her near-legendary top
register were all present.

Dramatically, she gave an
admirably poised and motivating
protrayal of the sad queen.
Exciting Mezzo
Meting Sutherland on her own
ground as Elizabeth was a brilliant
debut artist, Huguette
Tourangeau. Tourangeau is a rara
avis: a coloratura mezzo-cum
contralto. Such a voice, to my
mind, is one of the most
scintillating there is, her forays
into the lower reaches were easily
as exciting as Sutherland's scaling
of the heights. Deprived of all
ability to act by inch-thick
make-up and the encasement of a
huge farthingale, Tourangeau was
forced to over-play the angularity
and waspishness of Elizabeth.
"Maria" is decidely a woman's
world; the men's roles seem so
dull. Stuart Burrows, as Mary's
beloved, provided some fine
ensemble moments with his light,
extremely appealing tenor. But his
upper register was not in evidence,
which in this genre is a real
lacking. Cornelis Opthof sang well
as Talbot; as did Ara Berberian in
the role of Cecil.
Sutherland's husband,
conductor Richard Bonynge, was
as usual completely respectful of
the values of vocal display, and
this invariably leads to a rather
syrupy pace. Bonynge did,
however, keep firm control of the
rum-ti-dum rhythms and even on
occasion brought out their vigor
underneath the patented
Donizetti melodies. It must be
said here that "Maria" does not
measure up musically to
Donizetti's other more commonly

performed operas ("Lucia,"
"Puritani," or "Lucrezia Borgia").
One need only compare the
Sextet in Act II with the great
Sextet in "Lucia" to see the
difference between good and
great.
Dreadful Sets
The stage director for "Maria"
had a tough job; the Schiller play
on which it is based is no miracle
of intensity or structure. So
perhaps Capobianco's pot-boiling
blocking was inevitable. On the
other hand, perhaps all his
creative energy was sapped by the
dreadful sets, which mark-for
this writer—the absolute nadir of a
decade of S.F. opera-going.
Shipped over from Florence,
the sets should be taken into
international waters and
sunk -water pollution be damned.
The Act I"Court" of Elizabeth
was grim, barren and monastic;
she was a pinchpenny, but not
like this! Fotheringay Park was
icy, stark, and grey; and Act 111,
all scrimshaw and dank moldiness,
brought the opera to a nice
negative climax. Still, one has to
admire the scheer economizing
genius of using the same circular
"thing" to represent in successive
scenes a settee, a prie-dieu, and an
executioner's block. The idea, I
assume, was to develop
tunnel-vision and see only the
costumes, which were certainly
splendid.
("Maria Stuarda" will be given
again on November 16, 21, 24,
27. Only standing-room is
available 2 hours before each
performance, at $3.)

human nature. Donizetti's music
has a gothic immensity which, to
modern ears, may seem merely
grotesque and self-indulgent. But
the Romantics, opera composers
included, were nothing if not
self-indulgent.
The trick, then, with Romantic
music, especially Romantic opera
like "Maria Stuarda," is to
transform mere self-indulgence
through spiritual fervor and
virtuosity into something which
transcends. Shelly expressed the
Romantic ideal in "Adonais:"
A godlike mind soars forth, in
its delight
Making earth bare and veiling
heaven.. .
And since the Romantics listened
so closely to the inner voice, it
should not surprise that their
operas count upon godlike voices
which soar forth and make earth
seem a little bare.
Joan Sutherland, as Mary, is
one of those few singers who has
the power to approach this
Romantic ideal. Her voice truly
soars, and when she is not falling
into her occasional habit of pallid
detachment, she can give a
stunning performance. Such was
the case in this "Maria." Her
staggering ability to catapult the
most pedestrian melodic material,
her gleaming voice and — lest we
forget - her near-legendary top
register were all present.

Dramatically, she gave an
admirably poised and motivating
protrayal of the sad queen.
Exciting Mezzo
Meting Sutherland on her own
ground as Elizabeth was a brilliant
debut artist, Huguette
Tourangeau. Tourangeau is a rara
avis: a coloratura mezzo-cum
contralto. Such a voice, to my
mind, is one of the most
scintillating there is, her forays
into the lower reaches were easily
as exciting as Sutherland's scaling
of the heights. Deprived of all
ability to act by inch-thick
make-up and the encasement of a
huge farthingale, Tourangeau was
forced to over-play the angularity
and waspishness of Elizabeth.
"Maria" is decidely a woman's
world; the men's roles seem so
dull. Stuart Burrows, as Mary's
beloved, provided some fine
ensemble moments with his light,
extremely appealing tenor. But his
upper register was not in evidence,
which in this genre is a real
lacking. Cornelis Opthof sang well
as Talbot; as did Ara Berberian in
the role of Cecil.
Sutherland's husband,
conductor Richard Bonynge, was
as usual completely respectful of
the values of vocal display, and
this invariably leads to a rather
syrupy pace. Bonynge did,
however, keep firm control of the
rum-ti-dum rhythms and even on
occasion brought out their vigor
underneath the patented
Donizetti melodies. It must be
said here that "Maria" does not
measure up musically to
Donizetti's other more commonly

performed operas ("Lucia,"
"Puritani," or "Lucrezia Borgia").
One need only compare the
Sextet in Act II with the great
Sextet in "Lucia" to see the
difference between good and
great.
Dreadful Sets
The stage director for "Maria"
had a tough job; the Schiller play
on which it is based is no miracle
of intensity or structure. So
perhaps Capobianco's pot-boiling
blocking was inevitable. On the
other hand, perhaps all his
creative energy was sapped by the
dreadful sets, which mark-for
this writer—the absolute nadir of a
decade of S.F. opera-going.
Shipped over from Florence,
the sets should be taken into
international waters and
sunk -water pollution be damned.
The Act I"Court" of Elizabeth
was grim, barren and monastic;
she was a pinchpenny, but not
like this! Fotheringay Park was
icy, stark, and grey; and Act 111,
all scrimshaw and dank moldiness,
brought the opera to a nice
negative climax. Still, one has to
admire the scheer economizing
genius of using the same circular
"thing" to represent in successive
scenes a settee, a prie-dieu, and an
executioner's block. The idea, I
assume, was to develop
tunnel-vision and see only the
costumes, which were certainly
splendid.
("Maria Stuarda" will be given
again on November 16, 21, 24,
27. Only standing-room is
available 2 hours before each
performance, at $3.)
Two imperious queens, with
imperial voices to match turned
the S.F. Opera's American stage
premiere of Donizetti's "Maria
Stuarda" on Friday into a
conflagration of vocal fireworks.
Indeed, most of the other values
in this bel canto feast, and there
aren't many, were consumed in the
fiery battle of wits and voices
between Queen Elizabeth and
Mary, Queen of Scots.
While Mozart is crystallizing
human passions and Verdi is
tearing them to tatters,
Donizetti's habit is to translate
these passions into facades of
ear-filling vocal arabesques.
Though his set-piece arias have
thoroughly two-dimensional
quality, they still possess a
towering heroic musical vision of

one of those few singers who has
the power to approach this
Romantic ideal. Her voice truly
soars, and when she is not falling
into her occasional habit of pallid
detachment, she can give a
stunning performance. Such was
the case in this "Maria." Her
staggering ability to catapult the
most pedestrian melodic material,
her gleaming voice and — lest we
forget - her near-legendary top
register were all present.

Dramatically, she gave an
admirably poised and motivating
protrayal of the sad queen.
Exciting Mezzo
Meting Sutherland on her own
ground as Elizabeth was a brilliant
debut artist, Huguette
Tourangeau. Tourangeau is a rara
avis: a coloratura mezzo-cum
contralto. Such a voice, to my
mind, is one of the most
scintillating there is, her forays
into the lower reaches were easily
as exciting as Sutherland's scaling
of the heights. Deprived of all
ability to act by inch-thick
make-up and the encasement of a
huge farthingale, Tourangeau was
forced to over-play the angularity
and waspishness of Elizabeth.
"Maria" is decidely a woman's
world; the men's roles seem so
dull. Stuart Burrows, as Mary's
beloved, provided some fine
ensemble moments with his light,
extremely appealing tenor. But his
upper register was not in evidence,
which in this genre is a real
lacking. Cornelis Opthof sang well
as Talbot; as did Ara Berberian in
the role of Cecil.
Sutherland's husband,
conductor Richard Bonynge, was
as usual completely respectful of
the values of vocal display, and
this invariably leads to a rather
syrupy pace. Bonynge did,
however, keep firm control of the
rum-ti-dum rhythms and even on
occasion brought out their vigor
underneath the patented
Donizetti melodies. It must be
said here that "Maria" does not
measure up musically to
Donizetti's other more commonly

performed operas ("Lucia,"
"Puritani," or "Lucrezia Borgia").
One need only compare the
Sextet in Act II with the great
Sextet in "Lucia" to see the
difference between good and
great.
Dreadful Sets
The stage director for "Maria"
had a tough job; the Schiller play
on which it is based is no miracle
of intensity or structure. So
perhaps Capobianco's pot-boiling
blocking was inevitable. On the
other hand, perhaps all his
creative energy was sapped by the
dreadful sets, which mark-for
this writer—the absolute nadir of a
decade of S.F. opera-going.
Shipped over from Florence,
the sets should be taken into
international waters and
sunk -water pollution be damned.
The Act I"Court" of Elizabeth
was grim, barren and monastic;
she was a pinchpenny, but not
like this! Fotheringay Park was
icy, stark, and grey; and Act 111,
all scrimshaw and dank moldiness,
brought the opera to a nice
negative climax. Still, one has to
admire the scheer economizing
genius of using the same circular
"thing" to represent in successive
scenes a settee, a prie-dieu, and an
executioner's block. The idea, I
assume, was to develop
tunnel-vision and see only the
costumes, which were certainly
splendid.

Two imperious queens, with
imperial voices to match turned
the S.F. Opera's American stage
premiere of Donizetti's "Maria
Stuarda" on Friday into a
conflagration of vocal fireworks.
Indeed, most of the other values
in this bel canto feast, and there
aren't many, were consumed in the
fiery battle of wits and voices
between Queen Elizabeth and
Mary, Queen of Scots.
While Mozart is crystallizing
human passions and Verdi is
tearing them to tatters,
Donizetti's habit is to translate
these passions into facades of
ear-filling vocal arabesques.
Though his set-piece arias have
thoroughly two-dimensional
quality, they still possess a
towering heroic musical vision of
human nature. Donizetti's music
has a gothic immensity which, to
modern ears, may seem merely
grotesque and self-indulgent. But
the Romantics, opera composers
included, were nothing if not
self-indulgent.
The trick, then, with Romantic
music, especially Romantic opera
like "Maria Stuarda," is to
transform mere self-indulgence
through spiritual fervor and
virtuosity into something which
transcends. Shelly expressed the
Romantic ideal in "Adonais:"
A godlike mind soars forth, in
its delight
Making earth bare and veiling
heaven.. .
And since the Romantics listened
so closely to the inner voice, it
should not surprise that their
operas count upon godlike voices
which soar forth and make earth
seem a little bare.
