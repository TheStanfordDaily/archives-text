Power Struggle In Peking?
TOKYO — Unexplained developments in China increasingly
suggest that Peking's Communist leadership is caught up in
a power struggle revolving around Mao Tse-tung's
designated heir—Lin Piao.
Lin, the 6 4 -year-old defense minister, has been absent
from public functions since June. His disappearance has
been accompanied by hints in the government and party
press that he may have fallen from grace or been elbowed
aside by Premier Chou En-lai.
Western experts have speculated that Lin failed in a
power play against Mao and Chou and died in a plane crash
in Mongolia on Sept. 13. Both the Russians and the Chinese
reported the crash but gave no information on its causes or
victims.
Buttressing their theory that Lin has dropped from
power, China watchers note that the press has stopped its
ritual salute of Lin as Mao's "closest comrade in arms" and
deputy leader of the Chinese Communist party. Instead, it
is building up a campaign against an unidentified
"bourgeois ambitionist" whose crimes could be traced to
Lin.
If reports of Lin's death are accurate, Peking may
continue to hide it for fear of repercussions in the selection
of Mao's new heir. The delay also could stem from
deference to Mao, who is reported to have personally
selected Lin as his successor.

debut last night with a bitter attack on the United States.
The top Chinese delegate demanded the immediate
withdrawal of U.S. forces from Indochina and of U.S.
military support cT Taiwan.
Chiano Kuan-hua, Peking's deputy foreign minister,
took the floor in the U.N. General Assembly at the end of a
day-long ceremony of welcome, including a speech by U.S.
Ambassador George Bush.
Surprising many who had expected the first Chinese

Communist speech to be a brief acknowledgement of the
warm welcome, Chiao accused the United States of
aggression by sending U.S. naval forces into the Taiwan
Strait and by its military intervention in Vietnam,
Cambodia and Laos.
The withdrawal of U.S. forces, he said, "is the key to a
relaxation of tensions in the Far East."
Chiao also threw his support behind the Arab countries
in the Middle East conflict, charging Israel with aggression
and demanding the withdrawal of Israeli forces from
occupied Arab territory.
The Chinese delegate attacked imperialism, colonialism
and the "superpowers," which he did not identify by name
but referred to several times as "one or two"—apparently
meaning the United States and the Soviet Union.
House Votes Cancer Funds
WASHINGTON — The House voted 35 0 to 5 yesterday for
a $1.6-billion bill to wage a three-year war on cancer
despite the American Cancer Society's intense campaign for
a Senate-passed rival measure.
Passage by the House came after Republican leaders said
President Nixon—who had endorsed the Senate
version—now approves the House bill.
This leaves it up to a Senate-House conference
committee to settle on a compromise.
Chairman Paul G. Rogers, D-Fla., of the House Public
Health subcommittee chief architect of the House bill, told
reporters he hopes to resolve the conflict before Christmas.
At the heart of the controversy is the basic structure of
the government's organizational approach to helping
science find the cause and develop a cure for cancer.
The House measure would create a three-member cancer
attack panel to be named by the President and to report to
him on Congress.
The House bill also would speed up the granting of
research funds, set up 15 new cancer clinics which could
get up to $5 million a year through a block grant, and
required national plan of attack on cancer.

Power Struggle In Peking?
TOKYO — Unexplained developments in China increasingly
suggest that Peking's Communist leadership is caught up in
a power struggle revolving around Mao Tse-tung's
designated heir—Lin Piao.
Lin, the 6 4 -year-old defense minister, has been absent
from public functions since June. His disappearance has
been accompanied by hints in the government and party
press that he may have fallen from grace or been elbowed
aside by Premier Chou En-lai.
Western experts have speculated that Lin failed in a
power play against Mao and Chou and died in a plane crash
in Mongolia on Sept. 13. Both the Russians and the Chinese
reported the crash but gave no information on its causes or
victims.
Buttressing their theory that Lin has dropped from
power, China watchers note that the press has stopped its
ritual salute of Lin as Mao's "closest comrade in arms" and
deputy leader of the Chinese Communist party. Instead, it
is building up a campaign against an unidentified
"bourgeois ambitionist" whose crimes could be traced to
Lin.
If reports of Lin's death are accurate, Peking may
continue to hide it for fear of repercussions in the selection
of Mao's new heir. The delay also could stem from
deference to Mao, who is reported to have personally
selected Lin as his successor.

The top Chinese delegate demanded the immediate
withdrawal of U.S. forces from Indochina and of U.S.
military support cT Taiwan.
Chiano Kuan-hua, Peking's deputy foreign minister,
took the floor in the U.N. General Assembly at the end of a
day-long ceremony of welcome, including a speech by U.S.
Ambassador George Bush.
Surprising many who had expected the first Chinese

Communist speech to be a brief acknowledgement of the
warm welcome, Chiao accused the United States of
aggression by sending U.S. naval forces into the Taiwan
Strait and by its military intervention in Vietnam,
Cambodia and Laos.
The withdrawal of U.S. forces, he said, "is the key to a
relaxation of tensions in the Far East."
Chiao also threw his support behind the Arab countries
in the Middle East conflict, charging Israel with aggression
and demanding the withdrawal of Israeli forces from
occupied Arab territory.
The Chinese delegate attacked imperialism, colonialism
and the "superpowers," which he did not identify by name
but referred to several times as "one or two"—apparently
meaning the United States and the Soviet Union.
House Votes Cancer Funds
WASHINGTON — The House voted 35 0 to 5 yesterday for
a $1.6-billion bill to wage a three-year war on cancer
despite the American Cancer Society's intense campaign for
a Senate-passed rival measure.
Passage by the House came after Republican leaders said
President Nixon—who had endorsed the Senate
version—now approves the House bill.
This leaves it up to a Senate-House conference
committee to settle on a compromise.
Chairman Paul G. Rogers, D-Fla., of the House Public
Health subcommittee chief architect of the House bill, told
reporters he hopes to resolve the conflict before Christmas.

the government's organizational approach to helping
