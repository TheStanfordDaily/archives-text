# Recruiting Protests To Continue
## 
### BOB BACON DAN BRENNER 
Protesters opposed to recruiting by
defense contractors and the military
have scheduled another day of
picketing at the Placement Center
today, and a rally is slated for 12:30
p.m. in front of the Center.
About fifteen pickets stood outside
the building for about two hours
yesterday morning.
Recruiters for the United States
Navy, the Institute for Defense
Analysis, the Mobil Oil Corporation,
and the General Research Corporation
will be interviewing at the Center
today.
Plans for today's demonstration
were made last night at a meeting
attended by about 40 people in Soto
Lounge. The group is under the
leadership of Dave Josephson of
Columbae House.
Josephson said that the recruiters
would be invited to address the rally
today, and that some of the protesters
would attempt to talk to Navy and IDA
representatives in the afternoon.
He added that the protesters are not
trying to keep the recruiters off the
campus; "we just want to keep them
from doing their business with
students."
Another rally will be held on
Wednesday, at which time the Young
Crows, an anti-Defense-research group,
will present awards to the winners of
their recent "Red Hot Professors
Contest." Awards will be presented to
the top five vote-getters in their
popularity poll of defense researchers,
along with a "special award winner for
long-time service."
Young Crows promise that "should
the winners not appear, we will walk to
their offices for the presentations."
The meeting last night endorsed a
statement by Josephson condemning
President Richard Lyman for closing
"all legitimate channels" for expression
of opinion on the placement center
issue.
Lyman, in an advertisement in
yesterday's Daily, made clear his
opposition to ideological screening of
recruiters and sought "to spare anyone
the illusion that I simply await advice
on this fundamental point."
Josephson's statement pointed out
last spring's student referendum on
war-related research was "vetoed" by
Lyman; then "He sent his
interpretation of this issue to a
committee, but he has already resolved
it in his mind and awaits no advice, so
the committee system is out."
Josephson claimed that
representative bodies were unable to
act on community wishes in this matter
because staff have no such body and

"last year it was shown that even these
representative bodies have policies
overruled, almost by whim (i.e. Faculty
Senate on new students into ROTC) by
Richard Lyman."
Faced with the closure of all
legitimate channels, Josephson
concluded, "we can withdraw our
support of the present system and work
to set up alternative sturctures."
Yesterday protesters won a
concession from Placement Center

Director Ralph Keller when he
permitted any student to make an
appointment to see any recruiter,
according to Josephson. At past
protests, some demonstrators had been
refused permission to see recruiters
since they were neither seniors nor
graduate students.
However, according to Josephson,
some Placement Center staff members
later refused to allow protestors to sign
up to meet recruiters.
