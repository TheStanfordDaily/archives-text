# South African Bishop Attacks Racial Policies
## 
### 
Colin O'Brien Winter, the Episcopal
Bishop of Southwest Africa, yesterday
denounced the minority white regime
of South Africa which rules his country
under U.N. mandate. In describing the
situation in Southwest Africa, Bishop
Winter said that there had been
"apartheid since 1 948 and racism since
the first white entered the country."
The Episcopal Diocese in Southwest
Africa under Winter currently operates
a hospital and a school which are the
only facilities of their kind available to
the native Africans. As a result of
South African government policy, the
hospital has no doctor and only six
white nurses. Any black nurses wishing
to serve on the hospital staff are either
prohibited from doing so or are given
inadequate training.
According to Winter, attempts to
relieve the plight of the Southwest
Africans have proven to be fruitless.
The United Nations has been appealed

to, but it has taken no action. Winter
described the world body as "the most
impotent international organization
now in operation."
Winter said that the Episcopal
Bishop of California had sent several
thousand dollars worth of penicillin to
the Southwest Africans which the
South African government had dumped
into the ocean.
White citizens who protest against
government policy are either exiled or
placed under house arrest, while
protesting Africans are immediately
imprisoned without trial. Winter
asserted that 90 percent of all black
workers are separated from their
families for all but one day in the year
to labor in the Southwest African
diamond mines.
He also denounced the American,
French and British industrialists who
retain interests in these mining
operations despite the policies of the
South African government.
