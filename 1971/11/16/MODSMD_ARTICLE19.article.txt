# Dorm Residents Survive Gastronomical Infections
## 
### 
Rumors of food poisoning at
Rinconada, a freshman dorm in Wilbur
Hall, were finally quelled today after
tests revealed that the alleged food
poisoning epidemic last week was viral
gastroenteritis or intestinal flu. Over 40
persons have been stricken with the
disease to date.
A representative from the County
Health Service arrived Friday after
eight new cases were contracted
Thursday night. The health service
advised all residents to eat only hot
foods while it conducted tests.
The possibility of poisoning was
ruled out since there was no sickness at
Otero whose residents eat in the same

food line. Food poisoning is more
severe than the flu cases and generally
shows up exactly 24 hours after one
meal. The cases were scattered
throughout the week.
A list posted in the Rinconada lobby
kept a running score of new illnesses.
One freshman commented that "the
first floor was completely wiped-out."
The concentration of the highly
contagious disease was probably due to
the close proximity of dorm living.
Dr. David Torin, who examined
most of the sick people at Cowell
Health Center, felt that the disease had
been mild. He noted that Cowell sees a
few cases of this type every day.
