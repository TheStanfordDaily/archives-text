# Tax Status Threatened
## ASSU Office Misuse Charged 
### CHRIS PECK 
Charges that ASSU office facilities
and addresses are being used illegally by
the group organizing the November
18th Peace rally in Memorial
Auditorium were made public today
through a letter to the Daily.
The letter says the ASSU Council of
Presidents and President Lyman are
willfully allowing a political-oriented
group, the Emergency Conference for
New Voters, to use University facilities
for furthering their political aims, while
knowing that such use of Stanford
facilities is illegal under University and
Internal Revenue Service rules
concerning tax exempt organizations.
Stanford currently enjoys such status,
according to the IRS.
Quoting from a July 22, 1970 issue
of Campus Report, which outlines the
University policy on the use of
Stanford facilities, the letter notes,
"University facilities may not be used
for political or other non-University
purposes" and that "no University
office should be used as a return
mailing address for the solicitation of
funds for political purposes."
The letter then notes that for the

past two weeks, the anti-Nixon
Emergency Conference for New Voters
has been using the ASSU office as a
co-ordination point for the peace rally
to be held in Memorial Auditorium
Thursday.
On numerous leaflets and handouts
produced by the so-called "Dump
Nixon" group, the telephone numbers
of the ASSU offices have been given as
numbers to call to help in the
organization of the rally, and in at least
one sheet sent to Bay-area anti-war
political supporters, the name of ASSU
Council of Presidents member Larry
Diamond and the ASSU mailing address
were used as a reference and place
where donations to the anti-war rally
could be sent.
'Sounds Suspect'
Presidential Legal Advisor James
Siena said last night that "President
Lyman has no knowledge of the
activities of the Emergency Conference
for New Voters," but Siena added that
the group's activity in the ASSU offices
"sounds very suspect because it is
illegal for the University to devote any
of it's tax exempt resources to a
political organization."
ASSU Financial Manager Tom
Huseby said he had no knowledge of
the anti-war group using the ASSU
address as a place where donations were
to be sent, and added that he would
not have allowed it because it is a direct
violation of University and ASSU
policy to have accounts with political
organizations.
Huseby added that the use of the
ASSU office for political purposes
could severely damage the tax exempt
status of both the University and the

ASSU.
ASSU Council of Presidents
members Diane Fields and Ann Kimball
said that while they had approved the
use of the student government offices
by the anti-war group two weeks ago,
they no longer approved of the use of
the office space by the group.
No Rationalization
"There's no way we can rationalize
the fact that this group was using the
ASSU office as a political headquarters
where donations were being sent,"
Fields said.
Fields added that she and the other

Council of President members had
warned the Emergency Conference
organizers not to associate the ASSU
with their work. But one of the
organizers of the upcoming rally,
Michael Barrett, says that his group
came to the ASSU "at the invitation of
Larry Diamond" who is one of the four
Council of Presidents members.
Diamond says that while his name
has appeared on various pamphlets
supporting the work of the Emergency
Conference for New Voters, it was
"perfectly legal for us to use the ASSU

ASSU CONTROVERSY—Larry Diamond, member of the ASSU Council of
Presidents, has recently been involved with the Emergency Conference of New
Voters. The group has been using ASSU offices as a Co-ordination point for a
November 18th peace rally. A letter in today's Daily, written by a student and
a staff member, claims that such use is a violation of printed university policy.
The question of a possible violation of the University's tax exempt status has
also been raised in light of the charges.
offices because the work of this group
is really educational, not political.
"The University has already granted
us the use of Memorial Auditorium for
Thursday's rally," Diamond continued,
"so they obviously don't judge this
group to be politically oriented or they
would have not allowed us to use a
University building.
"There are some people in this
University who will seize on any issue
they can to try to discredit the ASSU,"
Diamond concluded.
Author Claims No Malice
Bill Evers, a part-time University
employee and former student who
helped write the insinuating letter
disavowed any malice towards
Diamond and the ASSU. "The real
reason I wrote this letter was because I
was pissed off that the University is
allowing this blatant violation of it's

rules on political conduct at Stanford.
"I don't agree with the University
rules," Evers continued, "I've probably
violated them myself. But it makes me
mad that various radical groups have
been denied use of University facilities
for organizing, but a group with the
same political perspective as President
Lyman can use the University as a
headquarters."
The ASSU has already responded to
the accusations by ordering the
anti-war group to stop using the ASSU
mailing address in any future mailings
or leaflets, but Council member
Diamond admitted that "there aren't
many more leaflets that we'll be
sending out anyway."
Two More Days
As of press time last night, the
Council of Presidents said the
Emergency Conference of New Voters

would be allowed to occupy the ASSU
offices for another two days until the
Peace Rally on Thursday, barring
action by University administrators.
The other author of the letter, Herb
Borock, formerly the Parliamentarian
of the Student Senate said last night
that it "isn't impossible that we'll send
a copy of our letter to the Internal
Revenue Service and let them know
what's going on in the ASSU offices."
Financial Manager Huseby predicted
that the IRS will probably run an audit
check on the ASSU books because of
this incident and will carefully review
the present tax exempt status of the
ASSU.
Presidential Assistant Siena summed
up the entire affair saying, "If the
ASSU is in violation of the IRS rules
and the University policy both, the
University and the ASSU stand to lose
a lot."

"University facilities may not be used

purposes" and that "no University
office should be used as a return

The letter then notes that for the

past two weeks, the anti-Nixon
Emergency Conference for New Voters
has been using the ASSU office as a
co-ordination point for the peace rally
to be held in Memorial Auditorium
Thursday.
On numerous leaflets and handouts
produced by the so-called "Dump
Nixon" group, the telephone numbers
of the ASSU offices have been given as
numbers to call to help in the
organization of the rally, and in at least
one sheet sent to Bay-area anti-war
political supporters, the name of ASSU
Council of Presidents member Larry
Diamond and the ASSU mailing address
were used as a reference and place
where donations to the anti-war rally
could be sent.
'Sounds Suspect'
Presidential Legal Advisor James
Siena said last night that "President
Lyman has no knowledge of the
activities of the Emergency Conference
for New Voters," but Siena added that
the group's activity in the ASSU offices
"sounds very suspect because it is
illegal for the University to devote any
of it's tax exempt resources to a
political organization."
ASSU Financial Manager Tom
Huseby said he had no knowledge of
the anti-war group using the ASSU
address as a place where donations were
to be sent, and added that he would
not have allowed it because it is a direct
violation of University and ASSU
policy to have accounts with political
organizations.
Huseby added that the use of the
ASSU office for political purposes
could severely damage the tax exempt
status of both the University and the

ASSU.
ASSU Council of Presidents
members Diane Fields and Ann Kimball
said that while they had approved the
use of the student government offices
by the anti-war group two weeks ago,
they no longer approved of the use of
the office space by the group.

"There's no way we can rationalize

Fields said.
Fields added that she and the other

warned the Emergency Conference
organizers not to associate the ASSU
with their work. But one of the
organizers of the upcoming rally,
Michael Barrett, says that his group
came to the ASSU "at the invitation of

Council of Presidents members.

ASSU CONTROVERSY—Larry Diamond, member of the ASSU Council of
Presidents, has recently been involved with the Emergency Conference of New
Voters. The group has been using ASSU offices as a Co-ordination point for a
November 18th peace rally. A letter in today's Daily, written by a student and

"The University has already granted
us the use of Memorial Auditorium for
Thursday's rally," Diamond continued,

"There are some people in this
University who will seize on any issue

Diamond concluded.
Author Claims No Malice
Bill Evers, a part-time University
employee and former student who
helped write the insinuating letter
disavowed any malice towards
Diamond and the ASSU. "The real
reason I wrote this letter was because I
was pissed off that the University is
allowing this blatant violation of it's

rules on political conduct at Stanford.
"I don't agree with the University

violated them myself. But it makes me
mad that various radical groups have
been denied use of University facilities

The ASSU has already responded to

would be allowed to occupy the ASSU
offices for another two days until the

Borock, formerly the Parliamentarian
of the Student Senate said last night
that it "isn't impossible that we'll send
a copy of our letter to the Internal
Revenue Service and let them know
what's going on in the ASSU offices."
Financial Manager Huseby predicted
that the IRS will probably run an audit
check on the ASSU books because of
this incident and will carefully review
the present tax exempt status of the
ASSU.

Diamond and the ASSU mailing address
were used as a reference and place
where donations to the anti-war rally
could be sent.
'Sounds Suspect'
Presidential Legal Advisor James
Siena said last night that "President
Lyman has no knowledge of the
activities of the Emergency Conference
for New Voters," but Siena added that
the group's activity in the ASSU offices
"sounds very suspect because it is
illegal for the University to devote any
of it's tax exempt resources to a
political organization."
ASSU Financial Manager Tom
Huseby said he had no knowledge of
the anti-war group using the ASSU
address as a place where donations were
to be sent, and added that he would
not have allowed it because it is a direct
violation of University and ASSU
policy to have accounts with political
organizations.
Huseby added that the use of the
ASSU office for political purposes
could severely damage the tax exempt
status of both the University and the

ASSU.
ASSU Council of Presidents
members Diane Fields and Ann Kimball
said that while they had approved the
use of the student government offices
by the anti-war group two weeks ago,
they no longer approved of the use of
the office space by the group.
No Rationalization
"There's no way we can rationalize
the fact that this group was using the
ASSU office as a political headquarters
where donations were being sent,"
Fields said.
Fields added that she and the other

Council of President members had
warned the Emergency Conference
organizers not to associate the ASSU
with their work. But one of the
organizers of the upcoming rally,
Michael Barrett, says that his group
came to the ASSU "at the invitation of
Larry Diamond" who is one of the four
Council of Presidents members.
Diamond says that while his name
has appeared on various pamphlets
supporting the work of the Emergency
Conference for New Voters, it was
"perfectly legal for us to use the ASSU

ASSU CONTROVERSY—Larry Diamond, member of the ASSU Council of
Presidents, has recently been involved with the Emergency Conference of New
Voters. The group has been using ASSU offices as a Co-ordination point for a
November 18th peace rally. A letter in today's Daily, written by a student and
a staff member, claims that such use is a violation of printed university policy.
The question of a possible violation of the University's tax exempt status has
also been raised in light of the charges.
offices because the work of this group
is really educational, not political.
"The University has already granted
us the use of Memorial Auditorium for
Thursday's rally," Diamond continued,
"so they obviously don't judge this
group to be politically oriented or they
would have not allowed us to use a
University building.
"There are some people in this
University who will seize on any issue
they can to try to discredit the ASSU,"
Diamond concluded.
Author Claims No Malice
Bill Evers, a part-time University
employee and former student who
helped write the insinuating letter
disavowed any malice towards
Diamond and the ASSU. "The real
reason I wrote this letter was because I
was pissed off that the University is
allowing this blatant violation of it's

rules on political conduct at Stanford.
"I don't agree with the University
rules," Evers continued, "I've probably
violated them myself. But it makes me
mad that various radical groups have
been denied use of University facilities
for organizing, but a group with the
same political perspective as President
Lyman can use the University as a
headquarters."
The ASSU has already responded to
the accusations by ordering the
anti-war group to stop using the ASSU
mailing address in any future mailings
or leaflets, but Council member
Diamond admitted that "there aren't
many more leaflets that we'll be
sending out anyway."
Two More Days
As of press time last night, the
Council of Presidents said the
Emergency Conference of New Voters

would be allowed to occupy the ASSU
offices for another two days until the
Peace Rally on Thursday, barring
action by University administrators.
The other author of the letter, Herb
Borock, formerly the Parliamentarian
of the Student Senate said last night
that it "isn't impossible that we'll send
a copy of our letter to the Internal
Revenue Service and let them know
what's going on in the ASSU offices."
Financial Manager Huseby predicted
that the IRS will probably run an audit
check on the ASSU books because of
this incident and will carefully review
the present tax exempt status of the
ASSU.
Presidential Assistant Siena summed
up the entire affair saying, "If the
ASSU is in violation of the IRS rules
and the University policy both, the
University and the ASSU stand to lose
a lot."
Charges that ASSU office facilities
and addresses are being used illegally by
the group organizing the November
18th Peace rally in Memorial
Auditorium were made public today
through a letter to the Daily.
The letter says the ASSU Council of
Presidents and President Lyman are
willfully allowing a political-oriented
group, the Emergency Conference for
New Voters, to use University facilities
for furthering their political aims, while
knowing that such use of Stanford
facilities is illegal under University and
Internal Revenue Service rules
concerning tax exempt organizations.
Stanford currently enjoys such status,
according to the IRS.
Quoting from a July 22, 1970 issue
of Campus Report, which outlines the
University policy on the use of
Stanford facilities, the letter notes,
"University facilities may not be used
for political or other non-University
purposes" and that "no University
office should be used as a return
mailing address for the solicitation of
funds for political purposes."
The letter then notes that for the

past two weeks, the anti-Nixon
Emergency Conference for New Voters
has been using the ASSU office as a
co-ordination point for the peace rally
to be held in Memorial Auditorium
Thursday.
On numerous leaflets and handouts
produced by the so-called "Dump
Nixon" group, the telephone numbers
of the ASSU offices have been given as
numbers to call to help in the
organization of the rally, and in at least
one sheet sent to Bay-area anti-war
political supporters, the name of ASSU
Council of Presidents member Larry
Diamond and the ASSU mailing address
were used as a reference and place
where donations to the anti-war rally
could be sent.
