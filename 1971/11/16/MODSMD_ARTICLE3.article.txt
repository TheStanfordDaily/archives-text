# Rallies, Bonfire Head Big Game Axetivities
## 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
If your idea of big game is lions and
water buffalo, this week's activities to
prepare for the 7 4 th Stanford-Cal game
hopefully will change your mind.
The Leland Stanford Junior
University Marching Band (LSJUMB) is
already helping police guard the
campus against potential Cal
pranksters. They usually try highly
original tricks like painting blue Cs on
walls.
But no incidents have been reported
so far. "We haven't been fucked yet,"
politely comments one bandsman in
charge of security.
He adds that the LSJUMB is

coordinating its patrols this year with a
highly sensitive communications system
of "tin cans and long string."
Thursday night the band plans to
march through the campus and arrive in
front of the bookstore at about 9 p.m.
for a rally with coach John Ralston and
at least the football team co-captains.
Friday night is the traditional
bonfire rally at Lake Lag.
On Wednesday tall poles will be
planted upright in the shape of a C on
the bottom of Lake Lag.
On Thursday, a forest or two will be
trucked into the lake and added to the
log pile, or rather Lag pile.
Freshmen will then guard the fire
hazard with friendly kegs of beer.
Friday night at 7 p.m. the Lag rally
will begin with the band playing for an
hour and possibly a short speech by
former Stanford football great, Dick
McCall, who later played for the
Chicago Bears.
The bonfire will then be lit by
assorted football co-captains, freshman
guardians and rally organizers.
The band will proceed to alumni
parties on the Peninsula.
In the past, the alumni parties have
been in the city. The band would
serenade them and then march to
North Beach to play at Strip joints.
But even though the alums are not
in the city this year, that hasn't
stopped the Band from going to North
Beach after piayi.ng at their parties.
The march will probably start at
Union Square and then proceed
through Chinatown to Broadway.
Band manager Dave Ruiz said
yesterday that in an effort "to have
something for everyone" this year the
band may also stop at the gay bar,
Finocchio's.
And that brings to mind Gaieties
which opens tonight and runs through
Saturday.
This year's production is "Dracula,"
a biting musical comedy that won rave
reviews in Transylvania. However, some
critics said that the lead man sucks.
In the story, Dracula is a nightclub
owner in the thirties who falls in love
with the club's leading singer, Lucy.
One more recent tradition of Big
Game week is the Big Game Frisbee
Contest against Cal. Tryouts for the
Stanford team will be Wednesday at 2
p.m. on the Intramural field in front of
Lagunita.
The game will be in Lower Sproul
Plaza at Berkeley Thursday afternoon.
The San Francisco Chronicle
reported yesterday that Berkeley has
already chosen its Big Game Queen.
Although Stanford is not planning
to have one, with the possibility of the
band going to Finocchio's Friday, it's
still a little too early to say.

bonfire rally at Lake Lag.
On Wednesday tall poles will be
planted upright in the shape of a C on
the bottom of Lake Lag.
On Thursday, a forest or two will be
trucked into the lake and added to the
log pile, or rather Lag pile.
Freshmen will then guard the fire
hazard with friendly kegs of beer.
Friday night at 7 p.m. the Lag rally
will begin with the band playing for an
hour and possibly a short speech by
former Stanford football great, Dick
McCall, who later played for the
Chicago Bears.
The bonfire will then be lit by
assorted football co-captains, freshman
guardians and rally organizers.
The band will proceed to alumni
parties on the Peninsula.
In the past, the alumni parties have
been in the city. The band would
serenade them and then march to
North Beach to play at Strip joints.
But even though the alums are not
in the city this year, that hasn't
stopped the Band from going to North
Beach after piayi.ng at their parties.
The march will probably start at
Union Square and then proceed
through Chinatown to Broadway.
Band manager Dave Ruiz said
yesterday that in an effort "to have
something for everyone" this year the
band may also stop at the gay bar,
Finocchio's.
And that brings to mind Gaieties
which opens tonight and runs through
Saturday.
This year's production is "Dracula,"
a biting musical comedy that won rave
reviews in Transylvania. However, some
critics said that the lead man sucks.
In the story, Dracula is a nightclub
owner in the thirties who falls in love
with the club's leading singer, Lucy.
One more recent tradition of Big
Game week is the Big Game Frisbee
Contest against Cal. Tryouts for the
Stanford team will be Wednesday at 2
p.m. on the Intramural field in front of
Lagunita.
The game will be in Lower Sproul
Plaza at Berkeley Thursday afternoon.
The San Francisco Chronicle
reported yesterday that Berkeley has
already chosen its Big Game Queen.
Although Stanford is not planning
to have one, with the possibility of the
band going to Finocchio's Friday, it's
still a little too early to say.
If your idea of big game is lions and
water buffalo, this week's activities to
prepare for the 7 4 th Stanford-Cal game
hopefully will change your mind.
The Leland Stanford Junior
University Marching Band (LSJUMB) is
already helping police guard the
campus against potential Cal
pranksters. They usually try highly
original tricks like painting blue Cs on
walls.
But no incidents have been reported
so far. "We haven't been fucked yet,"
politely comments one bandsman in
charge of security.
He adds that the LSJUMB is

coordinating its patrols this year with a
highly sensitive communications system
of "tin cans and long string."
Thursday night the band plans to
march through the campus and arrive in
front of the bookstore at about 9 p.m.
for a rally with coach John Ralston and
at least the football team co-captains.
