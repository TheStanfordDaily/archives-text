# Franklin's Class Cut From Winter Schedule

### LARRY LIEBERT 
Professor H. Bruce Franklin's
proposed course for next quarter was
deleted at the last minute from the
winter quarter time schedule.
Associate Dean of Humanities and
Sciences Gordon Wright said he
personally ordered cancellation of the
listing Thursday morning, after learning
that the official course schedule
included Franklin's course, "Literature
and Revolution."
Wright said "it did not seem wise to
list it in the general course
catalog ... as in any case where there is
serious uncertainty whether the course
would be offered."
Franklin claimed Wright's action
prejudged dismissal charges against him,
which are now being evaluated by the
faculty Advisory Board.
"They're not only assuming my guilt
but also my punishmentâ€”that I won't
be able to teach next quarter," the
Maoist professor said.
Wright replied that it was
"ridiculous" to interpret his action as
an assumption of guilt. He said he
would scratch a course listing for a
large lecture course in any case of
"uncertainty," such as "if a professor
were ill and you weren't sure he'd be
able to teach."
Wright commented that he took the
action to help students who would "get
botched up" if they pre-registered for
Franklin's course and later learned it
would not be taught.
On the other hand, Franklin said
cancellation of the listing was "very
unfair to students who want to take the
course" because they would not know
about it duirng pre-registration.

Wright conceded that he departed
from customary precedure by not
consulting before his decision with
Franklin's department chairman. He
said he had no time because the
schedule was "already at the printer."
English Department Chairman W.B.
Carnochan said his department had
submitted its section of the time
schedule with Franklin's course
included.
Although saying no one is "exempt
from making questionable decisions,"
Carnochan said that Wright's veto
seemed "absolutely unprecedented. It
would normally be a departmental
decision. There is not normally an
administrative review of what's in the
time schedule."
Carnochan said Wright's action
"might seem to predetermine the
results of the case, and I think it's
important not to make prejudgments."
Wright said he first inquired about
Franklin's course after a copy of "the
Arena happened to come in my hands."
The conservative newspaper last week
published what it said was Franklin's
reading list for next quarter.
The next morning, according to
Wright, he called the registrar's office
and was told a decision on the listing
had to be made immediately.
Wright said, "I took the
responsibility to make the decision. I
didn't know if I could get hold of
Carnochan. I said I would make a
decision, then I would make my peace
with Mr. Carnochan."
Wright added that he phoned
Carnochan "10 seconds later" to
inform him that a final decision had
been made.
