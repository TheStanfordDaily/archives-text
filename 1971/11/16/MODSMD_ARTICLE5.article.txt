# ACLU Submits Brief
## 
### PHIL REVZIN 
The American Civil Liberties Union
of Northern California (ACLUNC)
submitted late yesterday afternoon a
brief amicus curiae in the hearing of
suspended English professor H. Bruce
Franklin.
The 18 -page brief, aimed at
expressing the ACLUNC's views "on
the civil liberties issues surrounding the
disciplinary proceeding" against
Franklin was submitted to the Advisory
Board and released to the Daily by one
of the parties in the case.
The Union makes clear throughout
the brief that they are not judging the
facts of the case as presented, but are
merely presenting the ACLUNC's view
of the law in regard to issues of free
speech and civil liberties raised during
the hearing.
The brief states that the ACLU 'is
aware that Stanford is a 'private'
University which may not be bound by
the First Amendment," but "urges
Stanford to bind itself to the principles
of the First Amendment because these
principles are desirable ones."
In discussing guidelines for conduct,

the brief says that "a reasonable person
must have been able to anticipate-Avith
relative certainty—that a given sanction
would or could have been imposed on
him for his conduct, before that
conduct can properly be administered."
Franklin's defense repeatedly said
that no clearly defined guidelines were
in effect during the time in question.
Franklin has stated that he "tailored his
conduct" to fall within the guidelines
of proper action as he understood them
at the time.
The brief states that "a calculating
person has the right to go right up to
the line; and he must be told in advance
of his conduct precisely where that line
is. The line may not be drawn or
discovered after the activity has been
completed.
"Not only must the board be able to
point to pre-existing standards, but
those standards must be relatively
precise and unambiguous. If reasonable
persons could disagree over whether the
activities at issue were specifically
encompassed within the standards, then
no discipline may properly be
imposed."

In regard to the specifics of the
charge that Franklin contributed to the
disruption of Henry Cabot Lodge's
speech January 11, the brief states that
the ACLU "can conceive of no possible
fact situation under which any member
of the Stanford community would have
had a right to silence—that is, prevent
from speaking at all, Ambassador
Lodge." The ACLU stated, however, its
belief that "a member of the audience
at a speech open to the general public
or to members of the University has a
constitutional right to heckle, to boo,
and to express displeasure at the
speaker or disagreement with his
views."
The brief sums up the issue of the
charge that Franklin urged and incited
people to disobey a lawful order to
disperse at the Computation Center
February 11 by saying "it would be
improper to discipline professor
Franklin for arguing with the police
that their order to disperse was
unlawful, or for urging others to refuse
to comply with it (unless, in the latter
case, his speech constituted a clear and
present danger of serious violence).
This would be so even if the order were
lawful and reasonable."
The brief concludes that Franklin's
speeches at White Plaza and the Old
Union Courtyard, when viewed in
isolation, "are so clearly within the
protection of the First Amendment
that it would be highly improper to
discipline anyone for delivering them.
They are not even close to the
line. . . They were not given in
situations where the crowd is 'swept
up' in the emotion of rhetoric and
provoked into immediate action. They
were not 'fighting words."
The ACLU points out that its
conclusion was drawn from a literal
reading of the speeches, without
consideration of whether Franklin was
speaking in "secret code" whereby
members of the audience would
understand that he was advocating acts
of violence. The report concludes that
Franklin's speeches do not even come
close to the line of unprotected speech,
unless the Board finds beyond a
reasonable doubt that they were
delivered in a 'secret language."

facts of the case as presented, but are
merely presenting the ACLUNC's view
of the law in regard to issues of free
speech and civil liberties raised during
the hearing.
The brief states that the ACLU 'is
aware that Stanford is a 'private'
University which may not be bound by
the First Amendment," but "urges
Stanford to bind itself to the principles
of the First Amendment because these
principles are desirable ones."
In discussing guidelines for conduct,

the brief says that "a reasonable person
must have been able to anticipate-Avith
relative certainty—that a given sanction
would or could have been imposed on
him for his conduct, before that
conduct can properly be administered."
Franklin's defense repeatedly said
that no clearly defined guidelines were
in effect during the time in question.
Franklin has stated that he "tailored his
conduct" to fall within the guidelines
of proper action as he understood them
at the time.
The brief states that "a calculating
person has the right to go right up to
the line; and he must be told in advance
of his conduct precisely where that line
is. The line may not be drawn or
discovered after the activity has been
completed.
"Not only must the board be able to
point to pre-existing standards, but
those standards must be relatively
precise and unambiguous. If reasonable
persons could disagree over whether the
activities at issue were specifically
encompassed within the standards, then
no discipline may properly be
imposed."

In regard to the specifics of the
charge that Franklin contributed to the
disruption of Henry Cabot Lodge's
speech January 11, the brief states that
the ACLU "can conceive of no possible
fact situation under which any member
of the Stanford community would have
had a right to silence—that is, prevent
from speaking at all, Ambassador
Lodge." The ACLU stated, however, its
belief that "a member of the audience
at a speech open to the general public
or to members of the University has a
constitutional right to heckle, to boo,
and to express displeasure at the
speaker or disagreement with his
views."
The brief sums up the issue of the
charge that Franklin urged and incited
people to disobey a lawful order to
disperse at the Computation Center
February 11 by saying "it would be
improper to discipline professor
Franklin for arguing with the police
that their order to disperse was
unlawful, or for urging others to refuse
to comply with it (unless, in the latter
case, his speech constituted a clear and
present danger of serious violence).
This would be so even if the order were
lawful and reasonable."
The brief concludes that Franklin's
speeches at White Plaza and the Old
Union Courtyard, when viewed in
isolation, "are so clearly within the
protection of the First Amendment
that it would be highly improper to
discipline anyone for delivering them.
They are not even close to the
line. . . They were not given in
situations where the crowd is 'swept
up' in the emotion of rhetoric and
provoked into immediate action. They
were not 'fighting words."
The ACLU points out that its
conclusion was drawn from a literal
reading of the speeches, without
consideration of whether Franklin was
speaking in "secret code" whereby
members of the audience would
understand that he was advocating acts
of violence. The report concludes that
Franklin's speeches do not even come
close to the line of unprotected speech,
unless the Board finds beyond a
reasonable doubt that they were
delivered in a 'secret language."

of Northern California (ACLUNC)
submitted late yesterday afternoon a
brief amicus curiae in the hearing of
suspended English professor H. Bruce
Franklin.
