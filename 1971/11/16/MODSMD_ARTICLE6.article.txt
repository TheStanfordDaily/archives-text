# 'Big Bird' Still Loose, Evades Control Officer
## 
### 
Stanford's "Big Bird" is still on the
loose.
A County animal control officer
searched unsuccessfully yesterday for
the red-tailed hawk that attacked a
jogger at Angell Field Friday.
Gilbert Lamb, senior animal control
officer for Santa Clara County, said
simply: "All I came up with was a big
blank."
He noted that a red-tailed hawk
attacking someone was highly unusual.
"They'll rarely take on anything larger
than a ground squirrel or other
rodent," he said.
The stories of the bird are "pretty
conflicting" said. Some observors
maintain the mysterious creature is the
falcon lost during an Air

Force-Stanford football game two-years
ago. But most people agree the
winged-monster was or is a red-tailed
hawk.
Lamb notes that there are many
red-tailed hawks in the hills behind
highway 280 and that the Air Force
falcon would probably have migrated
south.
He theorized that if the "Big Bird"
had been once trained by someone and
escaped, its "attacks" on people might
really be attempts by the bird to try to
get someone to take it home. The bird
had plenty of food in small game earlier
in the year when it was warmer, he
theorized, but now with rodents going
into hibernation the bird might be
getting hungry and want to go home
for food.
