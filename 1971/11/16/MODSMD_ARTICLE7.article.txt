## ASSU Merry-Go-Round 
### 
The current session of the ASSU Senate has
sputtered to an inauspicious start. If the activities of
the last week are typical of what the community
can expect for the next eight months, then student
government at Stanford is in danger of losing any
remnants of credibility which still adhere.
The recent Senate election was, as always, a
shambles. It was postponed once due to a complete
breakdown of the balloting procedure. Previously,
graduate students indicated the extent of their
commitment to the present government structure
by presenting so few candidates for office Irom
their constituency that only two of 20 scats were
contested, and 10 remained unfilled.
If this were not sufficient to convince a skeptical
observor that all was not well with the Senate
election, surely the problem of the European
campuses would have settled the issue.
Transmitting election material across the Atlantic
has always been a problem in ASSU elections. The
students in attendance at the European campuses
have the same right to vote as do students in
California, but informing them of election
procedure and collecting their votes presents special
difficulties. Last Spring, election results were
delayed for weeks awaiting the receipt of overseas
ballots.
This year, corplaints have been voiced in Italy.
France and England that election material did not
arrive until after the deadline for results to be
received at Stanford. Although all the campuses
were originally instructed to immediately telegraph
their results on the two referenda, only Germany
responded. Apparently the other campuses felt that
they had missed their opportunity to vote when
election material was received after the appointed
date for its return.
None of the campuses, including Germany,
bothered to submit results on Senate balloting.
However, the Senate did receive an angry
complaint from Italy XXIII (via a letter sent to the
Daily demanding that the election be voided due to
their disenfranchisement. After only the most
cursory of discussions, the Senate ignored the letter
and voted to install itself by validating its own
election, thereby sweeping the disagreeable
complaints of the European campuses under its
parliamentary rug.
At the same time, the Senate did respond to
complaints received by Elections Commissioner
Alice Furumoto from several disgruntled graduate
engineers who felt they had been denied sufficient
opportunity to run for office. The Senate agreed to
hold a special election to fill the heretofore vacant
graduate seats.
Elections Commissioner is a thankless task, as we
are sure Furumoto has discovered by this time.

Cajoled into accepting the disagreeable appointment
one day before nominations opened, her training
consisted of a few brief conversations with ASSU
officials and with former Commissioner Louis
Humphreys. She inherited an electoral system that
has been demonstrated by every previous election to
be hopelessly inefficient and subject to numerous
difficulties.
Furumoto has made the eminently sensible
suggestion that a three-member Election
Commission be established to not only supervise
future elections, but to revise the present chaotic
and totally inefficient system, to make it more
responsive and realistic. She has expressed the desire
that the Commission be established prior to the
pending special election. We support her proposal
and hope to see significant improvement in election
procedures instituted immediately.
But, returning to the present election, we cannot
accept her thesis (shared incidently by ASSU
Presidents Diane Fields and Doug McHenry, who
should know better) that it is the overseas campuses
themselves that were responsible for their own
disenfranchisement. It is the duty of the Elections
Commissioner to see that ballots are delivered
properly to the various constitutents of the
Universityâ€”it is not the responsibility of the
"overseas presidents or with the mails," as McHenry
contends.
Furumoto is understandably fed up with the
whole elections business, and would probably like
to get on with being a student. When presented with
the Italy XXIII demand that the elections be
voided, her response was, "If they want a new
election, they'll have o get themselves another
commissioner."
While we sympathize with her impatience and
frustration, we also feel that the overseas campuses
have the right to first-class citizenship in this
community. Graduate students are to be offered a
second chance to participate in the Senate; do
students in Europe deserve less, or are they to be
given no more consideration than the back of the
hand from a Senate that "rules" with neither their
advice nor their consent.
