# almost another world
## On Young Lords At Stanford 
### 
The East Coast of the United
States is in so many ways
different from the West Coast that
it sometimes seems like a different
world. The weather is different.
Life's rhythm is different. Living
conditions are different.
The people are different, too.
The Brown people on the East
Coast are, by and large, Puerto
Ricans, recent immigrants from a
United States colony which is the
favorite cheap tropical
vacationland of snow-bound
upper middle class New Yorkers.
For centuries we have been
taught that we are a small,
quiet, insignificant, shuffling
people who cannot even govern
ourselves and who are very
happy having outside
governments control our lives.
We are taught that revolution is
the work of maniacs and
fanatics and has nothing to do
with nice, docile spies. Yet we
have not been quiet.
All italicized quotations are from
Palante: Young Lords Party, by
The Young Lords Party and
Michael Abramson (McGraw-Hill).
A third of all the PUerto
Ricans now alive reside in the
United States, and almost all of
them live in New York. So when
Juan Gonzales, of the Young
Lords Party, appeared on the
Stanford campus this week, at
least some people in the audience
welcomed him as a brother not
simply from another culture, but
almost from another world.
Juan's talk was preceded by a
new, excellent Newsreel movie
documenting the first year of the
Young Lords Party. The movie
dispelled some of the other-world
feelings, for it portrays the Lords
early "serve the people"
programs. And serving the
people—providing free breakfasts
for school children, TB tests and
urine tests for lead poisoning, for
example—is not much different in
East Harlem than in East Oakland.
But it was Juan Gonzales who
finally destroyed the notion that
differences of color, of culture, of
conditions dominate the

fundamental similarities. Juan
began his talk by elaborating on
the movie's documentation of the
Lords' takeover of Lincoln
Hospital in New York, "because I
understand that one of your
struggles here at Stanford has
been around the hospital." The
conditions at the Stanford
Hospital and Lincoln Hospital are
radically different. Stanford is a
well-equipped upper-class hospital
which excludes poor people.
Lincoln Hospital is about the
worst of the city hospitals. It was
condemned twenty years
ago . . . Lincoln Hospital used to
be a rest home for slaves, for
Black slaves, where they were
treated after they were very old.
And that's what it remains—a
home for slave Third World
people.
As Juan described the work of
the Health Revolutionary Unity
Movement and the Lords, which
focused on Lincoln Hospital's
total inadequacy, the surface
differences between the Stanford
Hospital struggle and the Lincoln
struggle disappeared, leaving a
bare truth. A capitalist society
provides health care only for
those who can pay. The hospital
industry, like everything in this
capitalist society, is interested
only in making itself wealthy.
Juan explained the significant
new direction the Lords have
taken in the last six months. Serve
the people programs are not
enough, the Lords realized. They
will not, by themselves, free
Puerto Rico from United States
imperialism; nor will they liberate
the Puerto Ricans living in New
York. Recently the Lords have
expanded their operations to
Puerto Rico, and at the same
time, they have become a
Marxist-Leninist revolutionary
party.
There was a period in our Party
from July of '69 when we first
started, to about August of
1970. . . when we ran really on
the personal magnetism of the
leadership. But as we started to
grow we said, "Look man, there

ain't no way you can get a party
going on that—you can 7 build a
national liberation movement on
the charisma of five pr six
people". .. Right now we are
going through a whole big thing of
teaching ourselves to think in
scientific terms, to study the
theories of other revolutionary
philosophers—people like Marx,
Lenin and Mao.
Juan outlined the ideological
problems the Lords have grappled
with: what classes exist in the
Puerto Rican nation? What is the
revolutionary role of the lumpen,
the street people: prostitutes,
junkies, two-bit pushers, hustlers,
welfare mothers. What about the
Puerto Rican working class? What
role will they play? And the
students? How does this analysis
relate to the liberation struggle in
Puerto Rico?
He spoke of two events which
have dismayed some white
American radicals and
revolutionaries, and which have
called for much discussion and
analysis within the Lords: the

Judy strasser

split in the Black Panther Party,
and China's "ping-pong
diplomacy." These are critical
events, Juan said, but in the long
run they will serve to teach us
more about revolution and about
our roles as revolutionaries. They
are not cause for despair.
Juan spoke for more than an
hour and, point by point,
reinforced a growing sense of
unity between himself and his
party and the audience, which was
largely comprised of Chicano,
Black and white radicals and
revolutionaries.

All over the world,
the people know
that the streets
are ours, the moon
is ours, the future
is ours, men, it's all
ours! all of it!
And we here today
will not rest until
it's won and placed
firmly in the hands
of the people.

people". .. Right now we are
going through a whole big thing of
teaching ourselves to think in
scientific terms, to study the
theories of other revolutionary
philosophers—people like Marx,
Lenin and Mao.
Juan outlined the ideological
problems the Lords have grappled
with: what classes exist in the
Puerto Rican nation? What is the
revolutionary role of the lumpen,
the street people: prostitutes,
junkies, two-bit pushers, hustlers,
welfare mothers. What about the
Puerto Rican working class? What
role will they play? And the
students? How does this analysis
relate to the liberation struggle in
Puerto Rico?
He spoke of two events which
have dismayed some white
American radicals and
revolutionaries, and which have
called for much discussion and
analysis within the Lords: the

Judy strasser

split in the Black Panther Party,
and China's "ping-pong
diplomacy." These are critical
events, Juan said, but in the long
run they will serve to teach us
more about revolution and about
our roles as revolutionaries. They
are not cause for despair.
Juan spoke for more than an
hour and, point by point,
reinforced a growing sense of
unity between himself and his
party and the audience, which was
largely comprised of Chicano,
Black and white radicals and
revolutionaries.

All over the world,
the people know
that the streets
are ours, the moon
is ours, the future
is ours, men, it's all
ours! all of it!
And we here today
will not rest until
it's won and placed
firmly in the hands
of the people.

"What is this?. . .A freeze or a snow-job?"
The East Coast of the United
States is in so many ways
different from the West Coast that
it sometimes seems like a different
world. The weather is different.
Life's rhythm is different. Living
conditions are different.
The people are different, too.
The Brown people on the East
Coast are, by and large, Puerto
Ricans, recent immigrants from a
United States colony which is the
favorite cheap tropical
vacationland of snow-bound
upper middle class New Yorkers.
For centuries we have been
taught that we are a small,
quiet, insignificant, shuffling
people who cannot even govern
ourselves and who are very
happy having outside
governments control our lives.
We are taught that revolution is
the work of maniacs and
fanatics and has nothing to do
with nice, docile spies. Yet we
have not been quiet.
All italicized quotations are from
Palante: Young Lords Party, by
The Young Lords Party and
Michael Abramson (McGraw-Hill).
A third of all the PUerto
Ricans now alive reside in the
United States, and almost all of
them live in New York. So when
Juan Gonzales, of the Young
Lords Party, appeared on the
Stanford campus this week, at
least some people in the audience
welcomed him as a brother not
simply from another culture, but
almost from another world.
Juan's talk was preceded by a
new, excellent Newsreel movie
documenting the first year of the
Young Lords Party. The movie
dispelled some of the other-world
feelings, for it portrays the Lords
early "serve the people"
programs. And serving the
people—providing free breakfasts
for school children, TB tests and
urine tests for lead poisoning, for
example—is not much different in
East Harlem than in East Oakland.
But it was Juan Gonzales who
finally destroyed the notion that
differences of color, of culture, of
conditions dominate the

fundamental similarities. Juan
began his talk by elaborating on
the movie's documentation of the
Lords' takeover of Lincoln
Hospital in New York, "because I
understand that one of your
struggles here at Stanford has
been around the hospital." The
conditions at the Stanford
Hospital and Lincoln Hospital are
radically different. Stanford is a
well-equipped upper-class hospital
which excludes poor people.
Lincoln Hospital is about the
worst of the city hospitals. It was
condemned twenty years
ago . . . Lincoln Hospital used to
be a rest home for slaves, for
Black slaves, where they were
treated after they were very old.
And that's what it remains—a
home for slave Third World
people.
As Juan described the work of
the Health Revolutionary Unity
Movement and the Lords, which
focused on Lincoln Hospital's
total inadequacy, the surface
differences between the Stanford
Hospital struggle and the Lincoln
struggle disappeared, leaving a
bare truth. A capitalist society
provides health care only for
those who can pay. The hospital
industry, like everything in this
capitalist society, is interested
only in making itself wealthy.
Juan explained the significant
new direction the Lords have
taken in the last six months. Serve
the people programs are not
enough, the Lords realized. They
will not, by themselves, free
Puerto Rico from United States
imperialism; nor will they liberate
the Puerto Ricans living in New
York. Recently the Lords have
expanded their operations to
Puerto Rico, and at the same
time, they have become a
Marxist-Leninist revolutionary
party.
There was a period in our Party
from July of '69 when we first
started, to about August of
1970. . . when we ran really on
the personal magnetism of the
leadership. But as we started to
grow we said, "Look man, there

ain't no way you can get a party
going on that—you can 7 build a
national liberation movement on
the charisma of five pr six
people". .. Right now we are
going through a whole big thing of
teaching ourselves to think in

struggles here at Stanford has
been around the hospital." The
conditions at the Stanford
Hospital and Lincoln Hospital are
radically different. Stanford is a
well-equipped upper-class hospital
which excludes poor people.
Lincoln Hospital is about the
worst of the city hospitals. It was
condemned twenty years
ago . . . Lincoln Hospital used to
be a rest home for slaves, for
Black slaves, where they were
treated after they were very old.
And that's what it remains—a
home for slave Third World
people.
As Juan described the work of
the Health Revolutionary Unity
Movement and the Lords, which
focused on Lincoln Hospital's
total inadequacy, the surface
differences between the Stanford
Hospital struggle and the Lincoln
struggle disappeared, leaving a
bare truth. A capitalist society
provides health care only for
those who can pay. The hospital
industry, like everything in this
capitalist society, is interested
only in making itself wealthy.
Juan explained the significant
new direction the Lords have
taken in the last six months. Serve
the people programs are not
enough, the Lords realized. They
will not, by themselves, free
Puerto Rico from United States
imperialism; nor will they liberate
the Puerto Ricans living in New
York. Recently the Lords have
expanded their operations to
Puerto Rico, and at the same
time, they have become a
Marxist-Leninist revolutionary
party.
There was a period in our Party
from July of '69 when we first
started, to about August of
1970. . . when we ran really on
the personal magnetism of the
leadership. But as we started to
grow we said, "Look man, there

ain't no way you can get a party
going on that—you can 7 build a
national liberation movement on
the charisma of five pr six
people". .. Right now we are
going through a whole big thing of
teaching ourselves to think in
scientific terms, to study the
theories of other revolutionary
philosophers—people like Marx,
Lenin and Mao.
Juan outlined the ideological
problems the Lords have grappled
with: what classes exist in the
Puerto Rican nation? What is the
revolutionary role of the lumpen,
the street people: prostitutes,
junkies, two-bit pushers, hustlers,
welfare mothers. What about the
Puerto Rican working class? What
role will they play? And the
students? How does this analysis
relate to the liberation struggle in
Puerto Rico?
He spoke of two events which
have dismayed some white
American radicals and
revolutionaries, and which have
called for much discussion and
analysis within the Lords: the

Judy strasser

split in the Black Panther Party,
and China's "ping-pong
diplomacy." These are critical
events, Juan said, but in the long
run they will serve to teach us
more about revolution and about
our roles as revolutionaries. They
are not cause for despair.
Juan spoke for more than an
hour and, point by point,
reinforced a growing sense of
unity between himself and his
party and the audience, which was
largely comprised of Chicano,
Black and white radicals and
revolutionaries.

All over the world,
the people know
that the streets
are ours, the moon
is ours, the future
is ours, men, it's all
ours! all of it!
And we here today
will not rest until
it's won and placed
firmly in the hands
of the people.

"What is this?. . .A freeze or a snow-job?"
The East Coast of the United
States is in so many ways
different from the West Coast that
it sometimes seems like a different
world. The weather is different.
Life's rhythm is different. Living
conditions are different.
The people are different, too.
The Brown people on the East
Coast are, by and large, Puerto
Ricans, recent immigrants from a
United States colony which is the
favorite cheap tropical
vacationland of snow-bound
upper middle class New Yorkers.
For centuries we have been
taught that we are a small,
quiet, insignificant, shuffling
people who cannot even govern
ourselves and who are very
happy having outside
governments control our lives.
We are taught that revolution is
the work of maniacs and
fanatics and has nothing to do
with nice, docile spies. Yet we
have not been quiet.
All italicized quotations are from
Palante: Young Lords Party, by
The Young Lords Party and
Michael Abramson (McGraw-Hill).
A third of all the PUerto
Ricans now alive reside in the
United States, and almost all of
them live in New York. So when
Juan Gonzales, of the Young
Lords Party, appeared on the
Stanford campus this week, at
least some people in the audience
welcomed him as a brother not
simply from another culture, but
almost from another world.
Juan's talk was preceded by a
new, excellent Newsreel movie
documenting the first year of the
Young Lords Party. The movie
dispelled some of the other-world
feelings, for it portrays the Lords
early "serve the people"
programs. And serving the
people—providing free breakfasts
for school children, TB tests and
urine tests for lead poisoning, for
example—is not much different in
East Harlem than in East Oakland.
But it was Juan Gonzales who
finally destroyed the notion that
differences of color, of culture, of
conditions dominate the

fundamental similarities. Juan
began his talk by elaborating on
the movie's documentation of the
Lords' takeover of Lincoln
Hospital in New York, "because I
understand that one of your
struggles here at Stanford has
been around the hospital." The
conditions at the Stanford
