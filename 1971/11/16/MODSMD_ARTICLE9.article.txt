# Stony Ferd Firko Seeks Sex, Of Course
## 
### 
Stoned. Getting stoned. Wanna
get stoned? We're really wrecked.
Really ba-aad shape. Jes wasted.
Hee hee hee hee hee hee.
Ahahaha.
Ferd Firko, stoned out of his
frustrated frosh mind, sucks
smoke and stares, slow swaying.
Corner curled girl. Who?

Me? Nah. She strokes the thin
carpet, rolling Waverly Wafer
crumbs, salt stuck under
fingernails. Roll on 0 Crumbly
Wafer, pocket crushed till stony
moment when. Wasted.
"I'm starving."
"Wanna cracker? Kinda old
and cumbly."
"No thanks, but thanks
anyhow."
Thanks anyhoo. Eat it myself,
damn her, crumbling on the
carpet. Corner girl too damn good
for an old Waverly Wafer, prolly
goes out with a fratman. Never
from a stanger. Never asked. You
wanna piece of? Sweet 18 and
never been. Wasted.
"Don't just sit there, Wallace
Middendorp. Make a noise. Or
drink Sprite, the noisy soft
drink."

Wallace who? Middledorp. Mad
Rapist or something, I bet. Sprite
too, prolly some kinda fairy. Nosy
soft. Says right here in the
Stanford Daily, Monday, Nov. 21,
1966, right here in the ed. Hee
hee ahahee. Hate girlish giggles.
"How To Get a Teen-age Boy
& What To Do With Him When
You Get him" by Ellen Peck,
Bernard Geis Associates, Inc.,
1969.
Hey, wait a second. I'm not
that kind of boy. I mean I am a,
but I. Wat do you do with?
Whatever.
"A teen-age boy is basically
insecure."
Yup.
"It all started when you were
twelve and he suddenly noticed
you were wearing a bra."
Funny wrinkles under their
T-shirt, caught on right away.
Wonder if she in the corner?
Looking at that dorp. Yeah, the
Mad Rapist'll liberate her all right,
heh.
"That's all the evidence he
needed that you were definitely
and completely femaleßut you left
him feeling very unsure of himself
as a male. Especially when you
started acting giggly and
embarassed whenever he came
around. (Yes, you did too.) And
that nice comfortable feeling he
had with you—and with all girls
when they looked pretty much
like he did—changed. You became
different then. Because of that
bra, and the giggly behavior, he
began to feel uncomfortable and
tongue-tied around you. And
maybe he isn't quite over that

feeling yet. Even though you've
stopped the giggling. (Or, if you
haven't, do.)"
Hee hee hee hee hee hee.
Hohohahee. Hungry as hell and
not for a lousy old Waverly Wafer
neither. No more left, anyhoo.
"What did you do when Joe
(Boxcar) Brkczpmlug was kicked
off the football team just because
he flunked six out of four of his
majors? What did you do, Wallace
Middendorp?"
What am I supposed to do?
Don't even know the dorp.

"He's not qutie so sure of his
ability to function as a member of
the male sex. His unsureness
concerns his sexual identity."
Just give me a chance, corner
chickie.
"Oh he has very strong sex
drives; in fact, in many cases the
teen-age boy is in a constant state
of sexual frustration."
No kidding.
"He definitely has an appetite
that's not being satisfied."

Anybody got anything to eat?
"And when the school
newspaper's editors resigned in
protest because The Chancellor
wouldn't allow the publication of
certain salacious portions of
"Night in a Girl's Dormitory" you
just sat, didn't you?"
Did not! Volunteered for
extensive research, intensive work
in the field, Salacions. That's how
I got into Stanford. Extensive
vocabulary. In the field.
"You've made a mockery of
your life, Wallace Middendorp!

muonmi

You're a vegetable."
Parsnip, turnip, catnip.
Zucchini! Eggplant! Squash!!!
"You see it's not just the sex
that's important."
Oh yeah?
"So in search of both sex per
se, and in search of security,
about 50 per cent of guys over 14
experiment with serious sex."
My God, what happens to the
other 50 percent? Jeesh, that's
prolly where I am, the control
group. What the hell's going on
around her anyhoo? Nothing.
"And that's usually just what it
is. Experimenting."
No wonder Bio Lab is so hard
to get into.
"And it shouldn't be with
you."
Why not? I'm pre-med.
"Casual making-out is OK."
Okay!
"(And by this I mean stopping
short of passionate frenzy and
possible pregnancy. I am also
assuming you know this guy

you're kissing 'n' stuff."
'N' stuff? Hello there, corner
curled girl. My name is Ferd Firko
and I wonder if you'd like to. Hee
hee hee.
"But total sex?"
???
"NO"
Aw.
"Protest, Wallace Middendorp.
Take a stand, Make a noise! Or
drink Sprite, the noisy soft
drink."
Plop, shpritzsh. Ah, refreshing.
High on life. Ole Wally Dorp
introduced me to it. Used to
sneak out during lunch period,
behind the Girl's Gym.
"Without the right rules,
equipment, and strategy, things
seldom happen. It is seldom that a
wildly handsome guy will walk
into your life just when you need
a date for a school dance; it is
seldom that the best crowd will
reach out, on its own, to enfold
you with bright wings and carry
you to the heights of popularity.
"Instead you get the prizes of
the game—boys, a crowd, and a
nice social life—by conscious
efforts to manipulate things and
people around you.
"Manipulate. It has a cold
sound and an almost sinister
connotation."
"Open a bottle of Sprite at the
next campus speak-out. Letit fizz
and bubble to the masses."
Right on, Mad Rapist, whoever
you are. If I can't have her. ..
"Let its lusty carbonates echo
through the halls of ivy."
Or anybody else in this damn
place...
"Let its tart, tingling
exuberance infect the crowd with
excitement."
Jes wasted, wasted out of my
ever-freshings. Wrecked out of
my. Really ba-aad shape.
"Do these things, Wallace
Middendorp. Do these things and
what big corporation is going to
hire you?"
Stony Ferd swaying on crushed
carpet. Back and forth, side to
side, around and around and
around.
