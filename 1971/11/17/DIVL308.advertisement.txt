BACK TO ITS PEOPLE

Who said citizen action is futile? Populism in the
nineteenth century left an indelible mark on the
nation. Citizen action won the vote for women in
1920 and brought the abolition of child labor. The
labor movement, the civil rights movement, the
peace movement, the conservation movement — all
began with concerned citizens. If we had waited for
the government or Congress or the parties to initiate
any of them, we'd still be waiting. Try to think of a
significant movement in our national life that was
initiated by the bureaucracy. Or by Congress. Or by
the parties.
For a while, we lost confidence in our capacity to
act as citizens, but the citizen is getting back to his
feet. And citizen action is taking on a tough minded
professional edge it never had before. Never has our
society needed more desperately the life-giving
spark of citizen action. We must make our instru
ments of self-government work. We must halt the
abuse of the public interest by self-seeking special
interests.
The special interests buy favor through campaign
gifts. What flows back is literally scores of billions of
dollars in tax breaks, in lucrative defense contracts,
in favored treatment of certain regulated industries,
in tolerance of monopolistic practices. And the tax
payer foots the bill.
To combat such pervasive corruption, we must
strike at the two instruments of corruption in public
life—money and secrecy.
To combat the corrupting power of money, we
must control campaign spending and lobbying, and
require full disclosure of conflict of interest on the
part of public officials.
To tear away the veil of secrecy, we must enact
"freedom of information" or "right to know" statutes
which require that the public business be done pub
licly. And that's only a beginning. We can regain
command of our instruments of self-government.
To accomplish this, each citizen must become an
activist, especially the college student with his
newly acquired right to vote. He must make his voice
heard. Common Cause, a national citizens' lobby,
was created to accomplish just that. It hoped to en
roll 100,000 members in its first year, and got that
number in 23 weeks! On its first anniversary, it had
200,000 members.
• It was the chief citizens' group lobbying for the Constitu
tional Amendment on the 18-year old vote.
• It joined with environmental groups to defeat the SST.
• It brought the first real challenge in a generation to the
tyrannical seniority system in Congress.
• It helped bring the House of Representatives to its first
recorded vote on the Vietnam War.
• It has sued the major parties to enjoin them from violat
ing the campaign spending laws.
There is much more to do. And the time to do it is
now. The American people are tired of being bilked
and manipulated. It's time to give this country back
to its people. For additional information, write Com
