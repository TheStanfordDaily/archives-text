WORRIED ABOUT YOUR CIVIL LIBERTIES?
HEAR WHAT THE AMERICAN CIVIL
LIBERTIES UNION HAS TO SAY
"Unless a college bars all occupational recruitment of students,
the Army, Navy, and Air Force should be allowed the same
campus facilities as other government agencies and private
corporations. Since on-campus recruitment is essentially a service
to students and not central to the educational purposes of the
university, colleges may prohibit all recruitment as a matter of
institutional policy. But if outside recruitment is allowed, the
ACLU believes it should be on a non-discriminatory basis and in
accordance with established policies and procedures. Selective
exclusions, arising primarily from a political controversy, that
deny students access to particular recruiters are discriminatory in
their applications and suggest a possible infringement of the spirit
of the equal protection clause of the Constitution."
Quoted from "Academic Freedom and Civil Liberties of
Students in Colleges and Universities". A.C.L.U. Booklet, 2nd
printing. May 1971, pages 22 and 23.
