# Mayor Endures Bombs, Blessings
## 
### DAVID THIEMANN 
Kirke Comstock, the most durable of Palo Alto's
councilmen, has survived a recall drive which ousted
other liberals to be elected mayor by an unusual
coalition of conservatives and liberals.
Comstock, a councilman since 1963 was elected
mayor by a five to four vote in July, with
now-resigned conservative Frances Dias, often
Comstock's opponent on major issues, casting the
swing vote for him on the second ballot.
City officials and other councilmen voice
unanimous respect for Comstock as a public official,
although he is ideologically the most liberal member
of the council.
In the face of dire prophecies, he has maintained
flexible, calm control over council deliberations,
without allowing dominant personalities or issues to
stalemate the opposing pro-business and residential
factions.
"I've tried to set a tone that keeps council
members away from each other's throats. Being on
the council is not necessarily a bloody proposition,"
Comstock remarked in an interview with the Daily.
Several Vacancies
The mayor has several vacancies to fill—one on the
council, two on the planning commission, and the
city manager's position—providing an unanticipated
opportunity to exert influence on Palo Alto's future
direction, if the council will confirm his
appointments. •
City relations with Stanford, except through the
business office, are "pretty near non-existent,"
according to Comstock. "We have not really begun to
scratch the surface" in faculty and student relations,
he observed, "but there are the beginnings of a
change."
Comstock, unlike James Zurcher, Palo Alto's
Police Chief, reacts unhappily to proposals for a
"joint policing agreement" which would have Palo
Alto policemen patrol the Stanford campus.
Annexation
In a related issue, he stated that he would consider
annexing Stanford only if University residents want
to become part of the city, though legally Palo Alto

could annex with the owner's (the Board of Trustees)
consent. "We have taken a passive, low profile
approach to annexation," he said.
"We wouldn't gain much in terms of run of the
mill municipal considerations, but would gain a lot of
additional obligations," he explained, but added that
"Stanford is now being serviced at all levels" by Palo
Alto, using business arrangements with the city.
Two years ago, Comstock's house was bombed by
a group of ultra-conservatives. "After I got my front
door blown in," he recounts, "I became aware of
what a potent psychological weapon terrorism is,
especially in a community unaccustomed to it."
Free U
At the time his house was bombed, he was
scheduled to teach a course at the now-defunct
Midpeninsula Free University.
He believes that the original Free U "was a noble
idea, with an astounding selection of things to offer
the community. The people originally involved were
idealistic-ally motivated."
As the Free U became political, Comstock said,
"gentler people quietly withdrew," and the group
liquidated itself. "The community at large was not
able to make distinctions" between radical politics
and the offerings at the F'ree U, Comstock believes.
Political Resolutions
Comstock frequently asks the council to pass
resolutions on state and national issues and, when it
refuses, he may issue a proclamation as mayor
expressing his own feelings. He argues that these
issues are not the exclusive province of state and
national government, and that "it's proper to take
positions on them."
In addition, he said that he clearly stated his
position on these issues during his most recent
campaign for re-election to the city council. "I'm
going to comment on issues as they appear
important," he asserted.
Palo Alto has recently become active in the low
and middle-income housing field, but the mayor
maintains that "the city should have foreseen the
low-cost housing problem created by industrial
developments" it allowed in the area.

"The gut battle of the suburbs is occurring here,"
he commented, referring to neighborhood resistance
to new housing projects and the re-zoning of land
parcels for low-cost development.
In the environmental field, "the ability to legislate
has been taken out of our hands, but the people who
took it have done nothing about it. It's a pre-emptive
thing," Comstock asserts.
He opposes the proposed Southern Crossing (a
new bridge across the Bay), calling it "just another
freeway," and has supported efforts to extend the
Bay Area Rapid Transit system to Santa Clara
County. Comstock supports a proposal for a
county-wide transit system, and says he will present a
resolution advocating this proposal to the council
during the coming year.
Zoning Battle
Comstock expects a continuing battle over city
planning and zoning restrictions, but anticipates no
increase in the city's population, because zoning
density requirements will revert to lower levels.
He advocates "definite limitations on further
development," though with its present zoning the
whole downtown area is "up for grabs." He plans to
continue his opposition to "unnecessary" business
and real estate development by "going very slow on
townhouses." The mayor has opposed the Oregon
Expressway, the proposed Superblock, a proposed
downtown hospital, and (in a meeting two weeks ago)
a 28 n -room hotel on El Camino Real opposite
Stanford.
The Berkeley City Council's resolution offering
sanctuary to crewmen from the aircraft carrier Coral
Sea was "nothing improper," he believes, although
"as a real thine, it's meaningless, even if it has
symbolic importance."
Comstock might consider political office on the
state or national levels, especially if reapportionment
is favorable to an election bid. He is dissatisfied with
the quality of representation, but dislikes the remote
aspect of higher office. "As you go up and up, you
get farther and farther away from the people you deal
with," Comstock concluded.

national government, and that "it's proper to take
positions on them."
In addition, he said that he clearly stated his
position on these issues during his most recent
campaign for re-election to the city council. "I'm
going to comment on issues as they appear
important," he asserted.
Palo Alto has recently become active in the low
and middle-income housing field, but the mayor
maintains that "the city should have foreseen the
low-cost housing problem created by industrial
developments" it allowed in the area.

"The gut battle of the suburbs is occurring here,"
he commented, referring to neighborhood resistance
to new housing projects and the re-zoning of land
parcels for low-cost development.
In the environmental field, "the ability to legislate
has been taken out of our hands, but the people who
took it have done nothing about it. It's a pre-emptive
thing," Comstock asserts.
He opposes the proposed Southern Crossing (a
new bridge across the Bay), calling it "just another
freeway," and has supported efforts to extend the
Bay Area Rapid Transit system to Santa Clara
County. Comstock supports a proposal for a
county-wide transit system, and says he will present a
resolution advocating this proposal to the council
during the coming year.
Zoning Battle
Comstock expects a continuing battle over city
planning and zoning restrictions, but anticipates no
increase in the city's population, because zoning
density requirements will revert to lower levels.
He advocates "definite limitations on further
development," though with its present zoning the
whole downtown area is "up for grabs." He plans to
continue his opposition to "unnecessary" business
and real estate development by "going very slow on
townhouses." The mayor has opposed the Oregon
Expressway, the proposed Superblock, a proposed
downtown hospital, and (in a meeting two weeks ago)
a 28 n -room hotel on El Camino Real opposite
Stanford.
The Berkeley City Council's resolution offering
sanctuary to crewmen from the aircraft carrier Coral
Sea was "nothing improper," he believes, although
"as a real thine, it's meaningless, even if it has
symbolic importance."
Comstock might consider political office on the
state or national levels, especially if reapportionment
is favorable to an election bid. He is dissatisfied with
the quality of representation, but dislikes the remote
aspect of higher office. "As you go up and up, you
get farther and farther away from the people you deal
with," Comstock concluded.

CURT KIRKE?—PaIo Alto Mayor Kirke Comstock is a liberal faced with
the problems of a big city. Comstock has stated his opposition to unchecked
expansion of Palo Alto.
Kirke Comstock, the most durable of Palo Alto's
councilmen, has survived a recall drive which ousted
other liberals to be elected mayor by an unusual
coalition of conservatives and liberals.
Comstock, a councilman since 1963 was elected
mayor by a five to four vote in July, with
now-resigned conservative Frances Dias, often
Comstock's opponent on major issues, casting the
swing vote for him on the second ballot.
City officials and other councilmen voice
unanimous respect for Comstock as a public official,
although he is ideologically the most liberal member
of the council.
In the face of dire prophecies, he has maintained
flexible, calm control over council deliberations,
without allowing dominant personalities or issues to
stalemate the opposing pro-business and residential
factions.
"I've tried to set a tone that keeps council
members away from each other's throats. Being on
the council is not necessarily a bloody proposition,"
Comstock remarked in an interview with the Daily.
Several Vacancies
The mayor has several vacancies to fill—one on the
council, two on the planning commission, and the
city manager's position—providing an unanticipated
opportunity to exert influence on Palo Alto's future
direction, if the council will confirm his
appointments. •
City relations with Stanford, except through the
business office, are "pretty near non-existent,"
according to Comstock. "We have not really begun to
scratch the surface" in faculty and student relations,
he observed, "but there are the beginnings of a
change."
Comstock, unlike James Zurcher, Palo Alto's
Police Chief, reacts unhappily to proposals for a
"joint policing agreement" which would have Palo
Alto policemen patrol the Stanford campus.
Annexation
In a related issue, he stated that he would consider
annexing Stanford only if University residents want
to become part of the city, though legally Palo Alto

could annex with the owner's (the Board of Trustees)
consent. "We have taken a passive, low profile
approach to annexation," he said.
"We wouldn't gain much in terms of run of the
mill municipal considerations, but would gain a lot of
additional obligations," he explained, but added that
"Stanford is now being serviced at all levels" by Palo
Alto, using business arrangements with the city.
Two years ago, Comstock's house was bombed by
a group of ultra-conservatives. "After I got my front
door blown in," he recounts, "I became aware of
what a potent psychological weapon terrorism is,
especially in a community unaccustomed to it."
Free U
At the time his house was bombed, he was
scheduled to teach a course at the now-defunct
Midpeninsula Free University.
He believes that the original Free U "was a noble
idea, with an astounding selection of things to offer
the community. The people originally involved were
idealistic-ally motivated."
As the Free U became political, Comstock said,
"gentler people quietly withdrew," and the group
liquidated itself. "The community at large was not
able to make distinctions" between radical politics
and the offerings at the F'ree U, Comstock believes.
Political Resolutions
Comstock frequently asks the council to pass
resolutions on state and national issues and, when it
refuses, he may issue a proclamation as mayor
expressing his own feelings. He argues that these
issues are not the exclusive province of state and
national government, and that "it's proper to take

stalemate the opposing pro-business and residential
factions.
"I've tried to set a tone that keeps council
members away from each other's throats. Being on
the council is not necessarily a bloody proposition,"
Comstock remarked in an interview with the Daily.
Several Vacancies
The mayor has several vacancies to fill—one on the
council, two on the planning commission, and the
city manager's position—providing an unanticipated
opportunity to exert influence on Palo Alto's future
direction, if the council will confirm his
appointments. •
City relations with Stanford, except through the
business office, are "pretty near non-existent,"
according to Comstock. "We have not really begun to
scratch the surface" in faculty and student relations,
he observed, "but there are the beginnings of a
change."
Comstock, unlike James Zurcher, Palo Alto's
Police Chief, reacts unhappily to proposals for a
"joint policing agreement" which would have Palo
Alto policemen patrol the Stanford campus.
Annexation
In a related issue, he stated that he would consider
annexing Stanford only if University residents want
to become part of the city, though legally Palo Alto

could annex with the owner's (the Board of Trustees)
consent. "We have taken a passive, low profile
approach to annexation," he said.
"We wouldn't gain much in terms of run of the
mill municipal considerations, but would gain a lot of
additional obligations," he explained, but added that
"Stanford is now being serviced at all levels" by Palo
Alto, using business arrangements with the city.
Two years ago, Comstock's house was bombed by
a group of ultra-conservatives. "After I got my front
door blown in," he recounts, "I became aware of
what a potent psychological weapon terrorism is,
especially in a community unaccustomed to it."
Free U
At the time his house was bombed, he was
scheduled to teach a course at the now-defunct
Midpeninsula Free University.
He believes that the original Free U "was a noble
idea, with an astounding selection of things to offer
the community. The people originally involved were
idealistic-ally motivated."
As the Free U became political, Comstock said,
"gentler people quietly withdrew," and the group
liquidated itself. "The community at large was not
able to make distinctions" between radical politics
and the offerings at the F'ree U, Comstock believes.
Political Resolutions
Comstock frequently asks the council to pass
resolutions on state and national issues and, when it
refuses, he may issue a proclamation as mayor
expressing his own feelings. He argues that these
issues are not the exclusive province of state and
national government, and that "it's proper to take
positions on them."
In addition, he said that he clearly stated his
position on these issues during his most recent
campaign for re-election to the city council. "I'm
going to comment on issues as they appear
important," he asserted.
Palo Alto has recently become active in the low
and middle-income housing field, but the mayor
maintains that "the city should have foreseen the
low-cost housing problem created by industrial
developments" it allowed in the area.

"The gut battle of the suburbs is occurring here,"
he commented, referring to neighborhood resistance
to new housing projects and the re-zoning of land
parcels for low-cost development.
In the environmental field, "the ability to legislate
has been taken out of our hands, but the people who
took it have done nothing about it. It's a pre-emptive
thing," Comstock asserts.
He opposes the proposed Southern Crossing (a
new bridge across the Bay), calling it "just another
freeway," and has supported efforts to extend the
Bay Area Rapid Transit system to Santa Clara
County. Comstock supports a proposal for a
county-wide transit system, and says he will present a
resolution advocating this proposal to the council
during the coming year.
Zoning Battle
Comstock expects a continuing battle over city
planning and zoning restrictions, but anticipates no
increase in the city's population, because zoning
density requirements will revert to lower levels.
He advocates "definite limitations on further
development," though with its present zoning the
whole downtown area is "up for grabs." He plans to
continue his opposition to "unnecessary" business
and real estate development by "going very slow on
townhouses." The mayor has opposed the Oregon
Expressway, the proposed Superblock, a proposed
downtown hospital, and (in a meeting two weeks ago)
a 28 n -room hotel on El Camino Real opposite
Stanford.
The Berkeley City Council's resolution offering
sanctuary to crewmen from the aircraft carrier Coral
Sea was "nothing improper," he believes, although
"as a real thine, it's meaningless, even if it has
symbolic importance."
Comstock might consider political office on the
state or national levels, especially if reapportionment
is favorable to an election bid. He is dissatisfied with
the quality of representation, but dislikes the remote
aspect of higher office. "As you go up and up, you
get farther and farther away from the people you deal
with," Comstock concluded.

CURT KIRKE?—PaIo Alto Mayor Kirke Comstock is a liberal faced with
the problems of a big city. Comstock has stated his opposition to unchecked
expansion of Palo Alto.
Kirke Comstock, the most durable of Palo Alto's
councilmen, has survived a recall drive which ousted
other liberals to be elected mayor by an unusual
coalition of conservatives and liberals.
Comstock, a councilman since 1963 was elected
mayor by a five to four vote in July, with
now-resigned conservative Frances Dias, often
Comstock's opponent on major issues, casting the
swing vote for him on the second ballot.
City officials and other councilmen voice
unanimous respect for Comstock as a public official,
although he is ideologically the most liberal member
of the council.
In the face of dire prophecies, he has maintained
flexible, calm control over council deliberations,
without allowing dominant personalities or issues to
stalemate the opposing pro-business and residential
factions.
