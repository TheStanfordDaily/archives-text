# Women In Politics In '72
## 
### 
Pauline Gore, a lawyer and the wife
of former Tennessee senator Albert
Gore, discussed "Women in Politics:
Possibilities and Predictions for 1972"
at a lunch meeting with women of the
Stanford community last Monday.
"I think it's important for women to
participate in politics," Gore stated. "I
predict more women will run and win
in 1972."
Gore does not approve of increased
militancy on the part of women,
however.
In discussing Shirley Chisholm's
candidacy for the Presidency ; Gore
stated, "I'm a realist and I know
Chisholm doesn't have a chance. I wish
she did, but she doesn't."
Gore does not believe that women's
issues are of great concern in Congress
at the present time. "Issues vie for

attention in Washington," she
explained. "There are plenty of
so-called chivalrous older congressmen
who don't think women's issues are
important."
Gore sees many limitations in the
present position of women in politics.
"Women are expected to be volunteers
rather than candidates," she pointed
out. "I feel pretty schizophrenic about
this. On the one hand, I don't like it,
but at the same time, I know how
badly volunteers are needed. I've
resolved the dilemma by doing some of
both."
Gore received her law degree from
Vanderbilt University. Right after she
got it she married Albert Gore and
decided to throw her lot in with his
rather than pursue an independent
career. The Gores have two children.
