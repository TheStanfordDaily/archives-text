# WOMEN's FORUM
## Fields and Kimball Women's Roles In ASSU 
### TINA COOPER 
Ann Kimball and Diane Fields are
the two women on the ASSU Council
of Presidents. They were elected last
spring, with Larry Diamond and Doug
Mc Henry, on a platform of more
student influence within the University.
This interview was conducted one hot
afternoon in their office, punctuated
by the telephone and by Doug's
plaintive inquiries about the location of
his keys. Eventually he found them
himself.
Daily: I'll begin with the obvious
question. How do you two feel about
being the women on the Council?
Ann: We're the two most qualified
members.
Diane: The real power at Stanford is
right here.
Daily: That goes without saying. But
have you had any problems?
Diane: We had problems at the
beginning. Annie was in charge of
pre-registration, for instance, but the
pre-reg chairman kept going to Doug.
We got letters addressed to "Dear Sir,"
or "Dear Mr. President." A few people
thought we were Doug and Larry's
secretaries.
Ann: Within the University, we aren't
affected much by sexual stereotyping.
We're treated well because of our
position. We see it in the structure here,
though. It's strange to deal with
administrators who regard their
secretary as "their girl." We've tried
hard not to misuse our secretaries
because we've seen how it can happen.
Diane: It's an extension of the home
situation into the office. The secretary
plays the role of wife. Men in the
University administration would be at a
loss if their secretaries quit.
Daily: What reactions do you get
outside the University?
Ann: I think Diane and I get more
political flak at alumni meetings
because we seem more vulnerable. And
there we're regarded more as women. I
told one man, after speaking at an
alumni meeting, that I planned to go
into radiology. He approved because
that was a good field for a woman.
Diane: Once we spoke at a men's club
in San Francisco, and they had invited
a Stanford women's club to join them.
I think so we would feel more at home.
But those women didn't ask us one
question. The men raised their hands
and asked questions after we finished,
but the women stayed quiet. Women
accept the traditional women's values
too much—that kind of repression
would make a man neurotic.
Ann: If you speak out as a woman
you're a bitch; if you're a man, you're
intelligent and outspoken. That kind of
stereotyping is hard to break down.
Daily: How does holding a traditional
man's job affect your private lives?
Diane: Most men seem to feel freer
around women who have interests of
their own; who can move away from
the "hee-hee, aren't you funny" line.
Some don't. I told a guy at a party
once that I was on the Council, and it
surprised him that I could be a social
person. He had only thought of me

politically. It shocked him to find I
could be soft, gentle—"normal."
Ann: There are probably people on this
campus who would never ask us out.
But they aren't among our friends.
Diane: My social life only suffers in
terms of never having enough time. But
when I do have time to party, I really
enjoy it, more than I did before. I
really appreciate my friends now.
Ann: The people in Grove House,
where I live, are really fine and
independent. They never hassle me. I
have a single, so lack of privacy doesn't
bother me.
Diane: It almost drove me up the wall
last summer. People were always calling
me at home. I could never leave the
ASSU behind. Now I'm off-campus and
have an unlisted phone, which makes
people realize that I do have an office.
Daily: Ann, you mentioned the
stereotyped woman—meek and mild.
Do you think that preconception
affects the way you handle the
presidency?
Ann: I think women in a position of
responsibility tend to work harder.
Diane and I often feel we are on trial.
So we polish our speeches, we get
involved in campus issues, we work on
our projects and see them through. We
do a good job. That way, when we
speak out, people can't just say "oh,
there's that bitch raging again."
Diane: I'm in a difficult position as a
black woman. I have to decide whether
I want to stand behind or beside my
black man. To be myself, I've decided I
have to stand beside him as an equal.
When I was considering running for
President I talked to a lot of BSU
leaders. Some were encouraging; they
thought of me as a person and liked my
political ideas. Some weren't. Many
black men are admittedly chauvinists
and will never change. But I want to do
this job for itself, because I think it
should be done; not just to prove a
woman can do it.

Ann: I agree. We're trying to do
something we feel is important. So we
have to throw off the stereotypes and
work a little harder. We have a lot of
help now from men as well as women.
Larry and Doug never take a
chauvinistic attitude around the office.
Daily: How does the Council work?
Diane: We try to emphasize the
Council—togetherness as people.
There's no division of work according
to sex. It's based on who's available and
who's requested. Sometimes people
who have business in our area go to
Doug and Larry, to the "real
presidents," and Doug and Larry send
them right back to us. We get along
well; we even go out to dinner together.
It would be so frustrating if we didn't
get along, on top of everything else.
Ann: Diane gets the most speaking
invitations.
Diane: It's typecasting. Liberal
organizations will kill two birds with
one stone and invite a black woman to
speak. But we try to divide the
invitations equally. And we all have
special areas of responsibility.
Daily: What are yours?
Ann: I was in charge of pre-registration.
We worked with the report on
Tressider, and Diane is our BSU liaison.
Diane: I try to take the black viewpoint
and stay involved with blacks on
campus.
Ann: The main thing right now,
though, is our work on the Stanford
committee structure.
Diane: We're trying to coordinate the
different committees. We want to
establish a file of committee histories
with the minutes of past meetings. If
it's possible, we want minority reports
too. That way new committee members
can find out what's going on. The
present system is hopelessly confusing.
Ann: We're trying to bring the whole
government closer to the students—in
dorm discussions, for instance. We
organized the Franklin discussions.

The Daily Women's Forum grew out
of a need felt by many women on the
Stanford campus to communicate with
each other. It is an open page; we
welcome any and all articles which
relate to issues concerning women.
The Forum will be published with a
minimum of editorial guidance. There
is certainly no "line " which the page is
pushing. Pieces can take any form. We
would like factual articles, opinion,
fictions, personal experiences, analyses,
poems, graphics, photographs,
manifestoes, or anything else you feel
like submitting.
If you would like to contribute to
the page or if you would like to work
on creating and editing it (and if you
have never worked on a newspaper
before, but want to learn how to do it,
don't hesitate!)

We're also working on a health plan for
cooperative health care within the
University.
Daily: What changes would you like to
see in the University?
Ann: I'd like to see an advising system
for special groups. There should be
counseling to help women fight sexist
obstacles in their fields.
Diane: Yes. I get tired of hearing "If
you're going to be a lawyer you'll never
get married."
Ann: In my. dorm freshman year there
were a few girls who wanted to go into
physics and engineering. "Men's fields."
They met a lot of resistance. We need a
system to encourage women students
to do what they want to do.
Daily: How do you feel about women
in politics?
Ann: If you have an interest, it's a very
positive thing. People have varying
reasons for going into politics: altruism,
personal benefits in meeting people,
learning how the University structure
works. And a woman in politics learns
to give up the traditional woman's role.
She has to have emotional stability and
honesty.
Diane:
Politics puts you in a position to see
sexism around you. Stanford is a liberal
place; Annie and I are treated according
to our office.
'Nice Girl 9
Three women from the Graduate
School of Business will present a
multi-media show tonight entitled
"What's a Nice Girl Like You Doing in
a Place Like This?" The show explores
what it means to be a woman in a
man's world. Last year the three
graduate students presented it at
Harvard and other Eastern schools.
The show will take place tonight in
Jordon Hall, the new psych building, at
7:30 in Room 040. It is free and open
to everyone.

could be soft, gentle—"normal."
Ann: There are probably people on this
campus who would never ask us out.
But they aren't among our friends.
Diane: My social life only suffers in
terms of never having enough time. But
when I do have time to party, I really
enjoy it, more than I did before. I
really appreciate my friends now.
Ann: The people in Grove House,
where I live, are really fine and
independent. They never hassle me. I
have a single, so lack of privacy doesn't
bother me.
Diane: It almost drove me up the wall
last summer. People were always calling
me at home. I could never leave the
ASSU behind. Now I'm off-campus and
have an unlisted phone, which makes
people realize that I do have an office.
Daily: Ann, you mentioned the
stereotyped woman—meek and mild.
Do you think that preconception
affects the way you handle the
presidency?
Ann: I think women in a position of
responsibility tend to work harder.
Diane and I often feel we are on trial.
So we polish our speeches, we get
involved in campus issues, we work on
our projects and see them through. We
do a good job. That way, when we
speak out, people can't just say "oh,
there's that bitch raging again."
Diane: I'm in a difficult position as a
black woman. I have to decide whether
I want to stand behind or beside my
black man. To be myself, I've decided I
have to stand beside him as an equal.
When I was considering running for
President I talked to a lot of BSU
leaders. Some were encouraging; they
thought of me as a person and liked my
political ideas. Some weren't. Many
black men are admittedly chauvinists
and will never change. But I want to do
this job for itself, because I think it
should be done; not just to prove a
woman can do it.

Ann: I agree. We're trying to do
something we feel is important. So we
have to throw off the stereotypes and
work a little harder. We have a lot of
help now from men as well as women.
Larry and Doug never take a
chauvinistic attitude around the office.
Daily: How does the Council work?
Diane: We try to emphasize the
Council—togetherness as people.
There's no division of work according
to sex. It's based on who's available and
who's requested. Sometimes people
who have business in our area go to
Doug and Larry, to the "real
presidents," and Doug and Larry send
them right back to us. We get along
well; we even go out to dinner together.
It would be so frustrating if we didn't
get along, on top of everything else.
Ann: Diane gets the most speaking
invitations.
Diane: It's typecasting. Liberal
organizations will kill two birds with
one stone and invite a black woman to
speak. But we try to divide the
invitations equally. And we all have
special areas of responsibility.
Daily: What are yours?
Ann: I was in charge of pre-registration.
We worked with the report on
Tressider, and Diane is our BSU liaison.
Diane: I try to take the black viewpoint
and stay involved with blacks on
campus.
Ann: The main thing right now,
though, is our work on the Stanford
committee structure.
Diane: We're trying to coordinate the
different committees. We want to
establish a file of committee histories
with the minutes of past meetings. If
it's possible, we want minority reports
too. That way new committee members
can find out what's going on. The
present system is hopelessly confusing.
Ann: We're trying to bring the whole
government closer to the students—in
dorm discussions, for instance. We
organized the Franklin discussions.

The Daily Women's Forum grew out
of a need felt by many women on the
Stanford campus to communicate with
each other. It is an open page; we
welcome any and all articles which
relate to issues concerning women.
The Forum will be published with a
minimum of editorial guidance. There
is certainly no "line " which the page is
pushing. Pieces can take any form. We
would like factual articles, opinion,
fictions, personal experiences, analyses,
poems, graphics, photographs,
manifestoes, or anything else you feel
like submitting.
If you would like to contribute to
the page or if you would like to work
on creating and editing it (and if you
have never worked on a newspaper
before, but want to learn how to do it,
don't hesitate!)

We're also working on a health plan for
cooperative health care within the
University.
Daily: What changes would you like to
see in the University?
Ann: I'd like to see an advising system
for special groups. There should be
counseling to help women fight sexist
obstacles in their fields.
Diane: Yes. I get tired of hearing "If
you're going to be a lawyer you'll never
get married."
Ann: In my. dorm freshman year there
were a few girls who wanted to go into
physics and engineering. "Men's fields."
They met a lot of resistance. We need a
system to encourage women students
to do what they want to do.
Daily: How do you feel about women
in politics?
Ann: If you have an interest, it's a very
positive thing. People have varying
reasons for going into politics: altruism,
personal benefits in meeting people,
learning how the University structure
works. And a woman in politics learns
to give up the traditional woman's role.
She has to have emotional stability and
honesty.
Diane:
Politics puts you in a position to see
sexism around you. Stanford is a liberal
place; Annie and I are treated according
to our office.
'Nice Girl 9
Three women from the Graduate
School of Business will present a
multi-media show tonight entitled
"What's a Nice Girl Like You Doing in
a Place Like This?" The show explores
what it means to be a woman in a
man's world. Last year the three
graduate students presented it at
Harvard and other Eastern schools.
The show will take place tonight in
Jordon Hall, the new psych building, at
7:30 in Room 040. It is free and open
to everyone.


SECRETARIES?—No, but that's what people are apt to assume, according to Ann Kimball and Diane Fields. Actually of
course, they're the two women members of the Council of Presidents. Below, in a Daily interview, they discuss the problems
and pleasures of their position.
Ann Kimball and Diane Fields are
the two women on the ASSU Council
of Presidents. They were elected last
spring, with Larry Diamond and Doug
Mc Henry, on a platform of more
student influence within the University.
This interview was conducted one hot
afternoon in their office, punctuated
by the telephone and by Doug's
plaintive inquiries about the location of
his keys. Eventually he found them
himself.
Daily: I'll begin with the obvious
question. How do you two feel about
being the women on the Council?
Ann: We're the two most qualified
members.
Diane: The real power at Stanford is
right here.
Daily: That goes without saying. But
have you had any problems?
Diane: We had problems at the
beginning. Annie was in charge of
pre-registration, for instance, but the
pre-reg chairman kept going to Doug.
We got letters addressed to "Dear Sir,"
or "Dear Mr. President." A few people
thought we were Doug and Larry's
secretaries.
Ann: Within the University, we aren't
affected much by sexual stereotyping.
We're treated well because of our
position. We see it in the structure here,
though. It's strange to deal with
administrators who regard their
secretary as "their girl." We've tried
hard not to misuse our secretaries
because we've seen how it can happen.
Diane: It's an extension of the home
situation into the office. The secretary
plays the role of wife. Men in the
University administration would be at a
loss if their secretaries quit.
Daily: What reactions do you get
outside the University?
Ann: I think Diane and I get more
political flak at alumni meetings
because we seem more vulnerable. And
there we're regarded more as women. I
told one man, after speaking at an
alumni meeting, that I planned to go
into radiology. He approved because
that was a good field for a woman.
Diane: Once we spoke at a men's club
in San Francisco, and they had invited
a Stanford women's club to join them.
I think so we would feel more at home.
But those women didn't ask us one
question. The men raised their hands
and asked questions after we finished,
but the women stayed quiet. Women
accept the traditional women's values
too much—that kind of repression
would make a man neurotic.
Ann: If you speak out as a woman
you're a bitch; if you're a man, you're
intelligent and outspoken. That kind of
stereotyping is hard to break down.
Daily: How does holding a traditional
man's job affect your private lives?
Diane: Most men seem to feel freer
around women who have interests of
their own; who can move away from
the "hee-hee, aren't you funny" line.
Some don't. I told a guy at a party
once that I was on the Council, and it
surprised him that I could be a social
person. He had only thought of me

politically. It shocked him to find I
could be soft, gentle—"normal."
Ann: There are probably people on this
campus who would never ask us out.
But they aren't among our friends.
Diane: My social life only suffers in

Daily: What are yours?
Ann: I was in charge of pre-registration.
We worked with the report on
Tressider, and Diane is our BSU liaison.
Diane: I try to take the black viewpoint
and stay involved with blacks on
campus.
Ann: The main thing right now,
though, is our work on the Stanford
committee structure.
Diane: We're trying to coordinate the
different committees. We want to
establish a file of committee histories
with the minutes of past meetings. If
it's possible, we want minority reports
too. That way new committee members
can find out what's going on. The
present system is hopelessly confusing.
Ann: We're trying to bring the whole
government closer to the students—in
dorm discussions, for instance. We
organized the Franklin discussions.

The Daily Women's Forum grew out
of a need felt by many women on the
Stanford campus to communicate with
each other. It is an open page; we
welcome any and all articles which
relate to issues concerning women.
The Forum will be published with a
minimum of editorial guidance. There
is certainly no "line " which the page is
pushing. Pieces can take any form. We
would like factual articles, opinion,
fictions, personal experiences, analyses,
poems, graphics, photographs,
manifestoes, or anything else you feel
like submitting.
If you would like to contribute to
the page or if you would like to work
on creating and editing it (and if you
have never worked on a newspaper
before, but want to learn how to do it,
don't hesitate!)

We're also working on a health plan for
cooperative health care within the
University.
Daily: What changes would you like to
see in the University?
Ann: I'd like to see an advising system
for special groups. There should be
counseling to help women fight sexist
obstacles in their fields.
Diane: Yes. I get tired of hearing "If
you're going to be a lawyer you'll never
get married."
Ann: In my. dorm freshman year there
were a few girls who wanted to go into
physics and engineering. "Men's fields."
They met a lot of resistance. We need a
system to encourage women students
to do what they want to do.
Daily: How do you feel about women
in politics?
Ann: If you have an interest, it's a very
positive thing. People have varying
reasons for going into politics: altruism,
personal benefits in meeting people,
learning how the University structure
works. And a woman in politics learns
to give up the traditional woman's role.
She has to have emotional stability and
honesty.
Diane:
Politics puts you in a position to see
sexism around you. Stanford is a liberal
place; Annie and I are treated according
to our office.
'Nice Girl 9
Three women from the Graduate
School of Business will present a
multi-media show tonight entitled
"What's a Nice Girl Like You Doing in
a Place Like This?" The show explores
what it means to be a woman in a
man's world. Last year the three
graduate students presented it at
Harvard and other Eastern schools.
The show will take place tonight in
Jordon Hall, the new psych building, at
7:30 in Room 040. It is free and open
to everyone.


SECRETARIES?—No, but that's what people are apt to assume, according to Ann Kimball and Diane Fields. Actually of
course, they're the two women members of the Council of Presidents. Below, in a Daily interview, they discuss the problems
and pleasures of their position.
Ann Kimball and Diane Fields are
the two women on the ASSU Council
of Presidents. They were elected last
spring, with Larry Diamond and Doug
Mc Henry, on a platform of more
student influence within the University.
This interview was conducted one hot
afternoon in their office, punctuated
by the telephone and by Doug's
plaintive inquiries about the location of
his keys. Eventually he found them
himself.
Daily: I'll begin with the obvious
question. How do you two feel about
being the women on the Council?
Ann: We're the two most qualified
members.
Diane: The real power at Stanford is
right here.
Daily: That goes without saying. But
have you had any problems?
Diane: We had problems at the
beginning. Annie was in charge of
pre-registration, for instance, but the
pre-reg chairman kept going to Doug.
We got letters addressed to "Dear Sir,"
or "Dear Mr. President." A few people
thought we were Doug and Larry's
secretaries.
Ann: Within the University, we aren't
affected much by sexual stereotyping.
We're treated well because of our
position. We see it in the structure here,
though. It's strange to deal with
administrators who regard their
secretary as "their girl." We've tried
hard not to misuse our secretaries
because we've seen how it can happen.
Diane: It's an extension of the home
situation into the office. The secretary
plays the role of wife. Men in the
University administration would be at a
loss if their secretaries quit.
Daily: What reactions do you get
outside the University?
Ann: I think Diane and I get more
political flak at alumni meetings
because we seem more vulnerable. And
there we're regarded more as women. I
told one man, after speaking at an
alumni meeting, that I planned to go
into radiology. He approved because
that was a good field for a woman.
Diane: Once we spoke at a men's club
in San Francisco, and they had invited
a Stanford women's club to join them.
I think so we would feel more at home.
But those women didn't ask us one
question. The men raised their hands
and asked questions after we finished,
but the women stayed quiet. Women
accept the traditional women's values
too much—that kind of repression
would make a man neurotic.
Ann: If you speak out as a woman
you're a bitch; if you're a man, you're
intelligent and outspoken. That kind of
stereotyping is hard to break down.
Daily: How does holding a traditional
man's job affect your private lives?
Diane: Most men seem to feel freer
around women who have interests of
their own; who can move away from
the "hee-hee, aren't you funny" line.
Some don't. I told a guy at a party
once that I was on the Council, and it
surprised him that I could be a social
person. He had only thought of me

politically. It shocked him to find I
could be soft, gentle—"normal."
Ann: There are probably people on this
campus who would never ask us out.
But they aren't among our friends.
Diane: My social life only suffers in
terms of never having enough time. But
when I do have time to party, I really
enjoy it, more than I did before. I
really appreciate my friends now.
Ann: The people in Grove House,
where I live, are really fine and
independent. They never hassle me. I
have a single, so lack of privacy doesn't
bother me.
Diane: It almost drove me up the wall
last summer. People were always calling
me at home. I could never leave the
ASSU behind. Now I'm off-campus and
have an unlisted phone, which makes
people realize that I do have an office.
Daily: Ann, you mentioned the
stereotyped woman—meek and mild.
Do you think that preconception
affects the way you handle the
presidency?
Ann: I think women in a position of
responsibility tend to work harder.
Diane and I often feel we are on trial.
So we polish our speeches, we get
involved in campus issues, we work on
our projects and see them through. We
do a good job. That way, when we
speak out, people can't just say "oh,
there's that bitch raging again."
Diane: I'm in a difficult position as a
black woman. I have to decide whether
I want to stand behind or beside my
black man. To be myself, I've decided I
have to stand beside him as an equal.
When I was considering running for
President I talked to a lot of BSU
leaders. Some were encouraging; they
thought of me as a person and liked my
political ideas. Some weren't. Many
black men are admittedly chauvinists
and will never change. But I want to do
this job for itself, because I think it
should be done; not just to prove a
woman can do it.

Ann: I agree. We're trying to do
something we feel is important. So we
have to throw off the stereotypes and
work a little harder. We have a lot of
help now from men as well as women.
Larry and Doug never take a
chauvinistic attitude around the office.
Daily: How does the Council work?
Diane: We try to emphasize the
Council—togetherness as people.
There's no division of work according
to sex. It's based on who's available and
who's requested. Sometimes people
who have business in our area go to
Doug and Larry, to the "real
presidents," and Doug and Larry send
them right back to us. We get along
well; we even go out to dinner together.
It would be so frustrating if we didn't
get along, on top of everything else.
Ann: Diane gets the most speaking
invitations.
Diane: It's typecasting. Liberal
organizations will kill two birds with
one stone and invite a black woman to
speak. But we try to divide the
invitations equally. And we all have
special areas of responsibility.
Daily: What are yours?
Ann: I was in charge of pre-registration.
We worked with the report on
Tressider, and Diane is our BSU liaison.

Harvard and other Eastern schools.

SECRETARIES?—No, but that's what people are apt to assume, according to Ann Kimball and Diane Fields. Actually of
course, they're the two women members of the Council of Presidents. Below, in a Daily interview, they discuss the problems
and pleasures of their position.
Ann Kimball and Diane Fields are
the two women on the ASSU Council
of Presidents. They were elected last
spring, with Larry Diamond and Doug
Mc Henry, on a platform of more
student influence within the University.
This interview was conducted one hot
afternoon in their office, punctuated
by the telephone and by Doug's
plaintive inquiries about the location of
his keys. Eventually he found them
himself.
Daily: I'll begin with the obvious
question. How do you two feel about
being the women on the Council?
Ann: We're the two most qualified
members.
Diane: The real power at Stanford is
right here.
Daily: That goes without saying. But
have you had any problems?
Diane: We had problems at the
beginning. Annie was in charge of
pre-registration, for instance, but the
pre-reg chairman kept going to Doug.
We got letters addressed to "Dear Sir,"
or "Dear Mr. President." A few people
thought we were Doug and Larry's
secretaries.
Ann: Within the University, we aren't
affected much by sexual stereotyping.
We're treated well because of our
position. We see it in the structure here,
though. It's strange to deal with
administrators who regard their
secretary as "their girl." We've tried
hard not to misuse our secretaries
because we've seen how it can happen.
Diane: It's an extension of the home
situation into the office. The secretary
plays the role of wife. Men in the
University administration would be at a
loss if their secretaries quit.
Daily: What reactions do you get
outside the University?
Ann: I think Diane and I get more
political flak at alumni meetings
because we seem more vulnerable. And
there we're regarded more as women. I
told one man, after speaking at an
alumni meeting, that I planned to go
into radiology. He approved because
that was a good field for a woman.
Diane: Once we spoke at a men's club
in San Francisco, and they had invited
a Stanford women's club to join them.
I think so we would feel more at home.
But those women didn't ask us one
question. The men raised their hands
and asked questions after we finished,
but the women stayed quiet. Women
accept the traditional women's values
too much—that kind of repression
would make a man neurotic.
Ann: If you speak out as a woman
you're a bitch; if you're a man, you're
intelligent and outspoken. That kind of
stereotyping is hard to break down.
Daily: How does holding a traditional
man's job affect your private lives?
Diane: Most men seem to feel freer
around women who have interests of
their own; who can move away from
the "hee-hee, aren't you funny" line.
Some don't. I told a guy at a party
once that I was on the Council, and it
surprised him that I could be a social
person. He had only thought of me

politically. It shocked him to find I
could be soft, gentle—"normal."
Ann: There are probably people on this
campus who would never ask us out.
But they aren't among our friends.
Diane: My social life only suffers in
terms of never having enough time. But
when I do have time to party, I really
enjoy it, more than I did before. I
really appreciate my friends now.
Ann: The people in Grove House,
where I live, are really fine and
independent. They never hassle me. I
have a single, so lack of privacy doesn't
bother me.
Diane: It almost drove me up the wall
last summer. People were always calling
me at home. I could never leave the
ASSU behind. Now I'm off-campus and
have an unlisted phone, which makes
people realize that I do have an office.
Daily: Ann, you mentioned the
stereotyped woman—meek and mild.
Do you think that preconception
affects the way you handle the
presidency?
Ann: I think women in a position of
responsibility tend to work harder.
Diane and I often feel we are on trial.
So we polish our speeches, we get
involved in campus issues, we work on
our projects and see them through. We
do a good job. That way, when we
speak out, people can't just say "oh,
there's that bitch raging again."
Diane: I'm in a difficult position as a
black woman. I have to decide whether
I want to stand behind or beside my
black man. To be myself, I've decided I
have to stand beside him as an equal.
When I was considering running for
President I talked to a lot of BSU
leaders. Some were encouraging; they
thought of me as a person and liked my
political ideas. Some weren't. Many
black men are admittedly chauvinists
and will never change. But I want to do
this job for itself, because I think it
should be done; not just to prove a
woman can do it.

Ann: I agree. We're trying to do
something we feel is important. So we
have to throw off the stereotypes and
work a little harder. We have a lot of
help now from men as well as women.
Larry and Doug never take a
chauvinistic attitude around the office.
Daily: How does the Council work?
Diane: We try to emphasize the
Council—togetherness as people.
There's no division of work according
to sex. It's based on who's available and
who's requested. Sometimes people
who have business in our area go to
Doug and Larry, to the "real
presidents," and Doug and Larry send
them right back to us. We get along
well; we even go out to dinner together.
It would be so frustrating if we didn't
get along, on top of everything else.
Ann: Diane gets the most speaking
invitations.
Diane: It's typecasting. Liberal
organizations will kill two birds with
one stone and invite a black woman to
speak. But we try to divide the
invitations equally. And we all have
special areas of responsibility.
Daily: What are yours?
Ann: I was in charge of pre-registration.
We worked with the report on
Tressider, and Diane is our BSU liaison.
Diane: I try to take the black viewpoint
and stay involved with blacks on
campus.
Ann: The main thing right now,
though, is our work on the Stanford
committee structure.
Diane: We're trying to coordinate the
different committees. We want to
establish a file of committee histories
with the minutes of past meetings. If
it's possible, we want minority reports
too. That way new committee members
can find out what's going on. The
present system is hopelessly confusing.
Ann: We're trying to bring the whole
government closer to the students—in
dorm discussions, for instance. We
organized the Franklin discussions.

The Daily Women's Forum grew out
of a need felt by many women on the
Stanford campus to communicate with
each other. It is an open page; we
welcome any and all articles which
relate to issues concerning women.
The Forum will be published with a
minimum of editorial guidance. There
is certainly no "line " which the page is
pushing. Pieces can take any form. We
would like factual articles, opinion,
fictions, personal experiences, analyses,
poems, graphics, photographs,
manifestoes, or anything else you feel
like submitting.
If you would like to contribute to
the page or if you would like to work
on creating and editing it (and if you
have never worked on a newspaper
before, but want to learn how to do it,
don't hesitate!)

We're also working on a health plan for
cooperative health care within the
University.
Daily: What changes would you like to
see in the University?
Ann: I'd like to see an advising system
for special groups. There should be
counseling to help women fight sexist
obstacles in their fields.
Diane: Yes. I get tired of hearing "If
you're going to be a lawyer you'll never
get married."
Ann: In my. dorm freshman year there
were a few girls who wanted to go into
physics and engineering. "Men's fields."
They met a lot of resistance. We need a
system to encourage women students
to do what they want to do.
Daily: How do you feel about women
in politics?
Ann: If you have an interest, it's a very
positive thing. People have varying
reasons for going into politics: altruism,
personal benefits in meeting people,
learning how the University structure
works. And a woman in politics learns
to give up the traditional woman's role.
She has to have emotional stability and
honesty.
Diane:
Politics puts you in a position to see
sexism around you. Stanford is a liberal
place; Annie and I are treated according
to our office.

man's job affect your private lives?
Diane: Most men seem to feel freer
around women who have interests of
their own; who can move away from
the "hee-hee, aren't you funny" line.
Some don't. I told a guy at a party
once that I was on the Council, and it
surprised him that I could be a social
person. He had only thought of me

politically. It shocked him to find I
could be soft, gentle—"normal."
Ann: There are probably people on this
campus who would never ask us out.
But they aren't among our friends.
Diane: My social life only suffers in
terms of never having enough time. But
when I do have time to party, I really
enjoy it, more than I did before. I
really appreciate my friends now.
Ann: The people in Grove House,
where I live, are really fine and
independent. They never hassle me. I
have a single, so lack of privacy doesn't
bother me.
Diane: It almost drove me up the wall
last summer. People were always calling
me at home. I could never leave the
ASSU behind. Now I'm off-campus and
have an unlisted phone, which makes
people realize that I do have an office.
Daily: Ann, you mentioned the
stereotyped woman—meek and mild.
Do you think that preconception
affects the way you handle the
presidency?
Ann: I think women in a position of
responsibility tend to work harder.
Diane and I often feel we are on trial.
So we polish our speeches, we get
involved in campus issues, we work on
our projects and see them through. We
do a good job. That way, when we
speak out, people can't just say "oh,
there's that bitch raging again."
Diane: I'm in a difficult position as a
black woman. I have to decide whether
I want to stand behind or beside my
black man. To be myself, I've decided I
have to stand beside him as an equal.
When I was considering running for
President I talked to a lot of BSU
leaders. Some were encouraging; they
thought of me as a person and liked my
political ideas. Some weren't. Many
black men are admittedly chauvinists
and will never change. But I want to do
this job for itself, because I think it
should be done; not just to prove a
woman can do it.

Ann: I agree. We're trying to do
something we feel is important. So we
have to throw off the stereotypes and
work a little harder. We have a lot of
help now from men as well as women.
Larry and Doug never take a
chauvinistic attitude around the office.
Daily: How does the Council work?
Diane: We try to emphasize the
Council—togetherness as people.
There's no division of work according
to sex. It's based on who's available and
who's requested. Sometimes people
who have business in our area go to
Doug and Larry, to the "real
presidents," and Doug and Larry send
them right back to us. We get along
well; we even go out to dinner together.
It would be so frustrating if we didn't
get along, on top of everything else.
Ann: Diane gets the most speaking
invitations.
Diane: It's typecasting. Liberal
organizations will kill two birds with
one stone and invite a black woman to
speak. But we try to divide the
invitations equally. And we all have
special areas of responsibility.
Daily: What are yours?
Ann: I was in charge of pre-registration.
We worked with the report on
Tressider, and Diane is our BSU liaison.
Diane: I try to take the black viewpoint
and stay involved with blacks on
campus.
Ann: The main thing right now,
though, is our work on the Stanford
committee structure.
Diane: We're trying to coordinate the
different committees. We want to
establish a file of committee histories
with the minutes of past meetings. If
it's possible, we want minority reports
too. That way new committee members
can find out what's going on. The
present system is hopelessly confusing.
Ann: We're trying to bring the whole
government closer to the students—in
dorm discussions, for instance. We
organized the Franklin discussions.

The Daily Women's Forum grew out
of a need felt by many women on the
Stanford campus to communicate with
each other. It is an open page; we
welcome any and all articles which
relate to issues concerning women.
The Forum will be published with a
minimum of editorial guidance. There
is certainly no "line " which the page is
pushing. Pieces can take any form. We
would like factual articles, opinion,
fictions, personal experiences, analyses,
poems, graphics, photographs,
manifestoes, or anything else you feel
like submitting.
If you would like to contribute to
the page or if you would like to work
on creating and editing it (and if you
have never worked on a newspaper
before, but want to learn how to do it,
don't hesitate!)

We're also working on a health plan for
cooperative health care within the
University.
Daily: What changes would you like to
see in the University?
Ann: I'd like to see an advising system
for special groups. There should be
counseling to help women fight sexist
obstacles in their fields.
Diane: Yes. I get tired of hearing "If
you're going to be a lawyer you'll never
get married."
Ann: In my. dorm freshman year there
were a few girls who wanted to go into
physics and engineering. "Men's fields."
They met a lot of resistance. We need a
system to encourage women students
to do what they want to do.
Daily: How do you feel about women
in politics?
Ann: If you have an interest, it's a very
positive thing. People have varying
reasons for going into politics: altruism,
personal benefits in meeting people,
learning how the University structure
works. And a woman in politics learns
to give up the traditional woman's role.
She has to have emotional stability and
honesty.
Diane:
Politics puts you in a position to see
sexism around you. Stanford is a liberal
place; Annie and I are treated according
to our office.
'Nice Girl 9
Three women from the Graduate
School of Business will present a
multi-media show tonight entitled
"What's a Nice Girl Like You Doing in
a Place Like This?" The show explores
what it means to be a woman in a
man's world. Last year the three
graduate students presented it at
Harvard and other Eastern schools.
The show will take place tonight in
Jordon Hall, the new psych building, at
7:30 in Room 040. It is free and open
to everyone.


SECRETARIES?—No, but that's what people are apt to assume, according to Ann Kimball and Diane Fields. Actually of
course, they're the two women members of the Council of Presidents. Below, in a Daily interview, they discuss the problems
and pleasures of their position.
