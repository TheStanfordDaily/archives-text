# Women's Sports Here Reflect Second Rate Status

### DEBBIE GILBERT 
A strange, new thing is happening at Stanford this fall.
UGLY is experiencing an unprecedented boom; pre-meds
and prospective law students are popping up under every
palm tree; and the Stanford Woman, cum "Dolly", is
assuming her proper place; i.e., beside her man, but with a
twist. This time it's on the playing fields of this hallowed
institution.
We will disregard for the moment the fact that Paloma's
efforts to participate in the intramural football season were
ingloriously snubbed, and that the Band is as chauvinistic as
ever. Revolutionists are to be cautioned that change comes
slowly nowadays. We will have our day!
That is not to say that those of us who are out jogging
or attempting to haul in a pass are of the "dumb jock"
variety, which in the past has been the catchall label
applied to women athletes. Neither are we particularly
more aggressive than our sisters from last year.
A lessening in the strict application of sex roles has
allowed women at Stanford to display what until now has
been a latent wish for relaxation and stimulation, both
mental and physical, through athletics. That co-ed sports
are beginning to abound on campus is a sign of the times to
come.
Miniscule WRA
W.R.A., the Women's Recreation Association, is an
important part of the women's sport scene at Stanford.
This is the miniscule counterpart of the men's association
of Intramural and Club Sports. W.R.A. is staffed by female
students who are willing to donate their time in an
inevitably frustrating cause.
For instance, the budget allocated by the University for
women's recreation is a fraction of what the Athletic
Department just donated to the Band.
Its very name underlines the fact that women's needs
by way of athletics are seen as invariably recreational,
rather than in some part competitive: a fallacy that is
becoming more and more apparent as girls get turned on to
the benefits of keeping in shape and applying themselves to
a certain sport.
W.R.A. uses its limited funds to sponsor such events as
are considered to be of interest to a majority of the women

on campus according to the sparse feed-back that is
obtained from students. It also backs the planning of
certain tournaments, and lends moral support to the
fledgling clubs now beginning to appear in various sports.
Two New Clubs
Have you seen women running all over campus in striped
track shoes, trying not to appear too out of breath, and
valiantly attempting to finish their two miles before
dinner? They might be members of the Women's Running
Club, along with the Aquatic Arts Club, one of the two
new women's sports clubs at Stanford affiliated with
W.R.A. Jogging has gained widespread popularity as a
means for women to get in shape without having to bo
hassled by the stigma of being a "female jock". The club
was formed to accommodate those who were interested in
learning more about the proper methods of conditioning
through running; emphasis being on warm-up exercises,
form, and technique. Club membership is completely open,
and everyone is welcome to come and run.
The weather is beautiful these days in the Bay Area if
you can ignore the high ratings on the pollution index. Go
out and enjoy it! If your thing is bicycling, or running, or
playing football, do it!
ANNOUNCEMENTS
Wednesday and Thursday nights the Women's Gym is
kept open from 7-9 for co-ed volleyball and badminton
respectively.
The 25-yard pool adjacent to the Gym is also
maintained at certain times for recreational use by both
sexes. See how magnanimous W.R.A. is: no sexual
discrimination there.
A co-ed golf tournament, now being organized, is
similarly being run through the W.R.A.: call Helena Barbey
at 327-9687 or 327-9731.
Running workouts are Monday at 4:15, and Tuesday
and Thursday at noon at the playing fields by the Women's
Gym; or at any time when two or more women from the
club get together to run. Wednesday there is a special
meeting at Angell Field at 4:15 for those who want to
work on their speed and who might be interested in
competing as a team this spring. Those to get in touch with
are Debbie Gilbert: 491-2066 and Maggie Hume: 491-4278.


SWINGINGâ€”Women's sports at Stanford, which up until now have hardly had a reputation for being cool, are beginning to
come into their own. Women seem to be deciding that they should do something more active than sit on the sidelines and
cheer for their man. The W.R.A., although it receives a miniscule budget, is actively working to capitalize on this new interest.
