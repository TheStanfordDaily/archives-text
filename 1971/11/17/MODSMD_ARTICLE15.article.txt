# Frosh Like Small Seminars
## 
### DANIEL BRENNER 
"Bolts, Nuts, and People" and
"Communist China's Policy on
Literature" are two of the 79
Freshman Seminars being offered
this year.
The Freshman Seminar
Program, started by two
professors in 1965 as an
experiment in small group
learning has expanded to cover
topics in the humanities, social
sciences, and natural sciences and
technology.
"The seminars break down the
feeling that teachers and
professors are too removed from
students," says Professor John
Goheen, Philosophy the present
director of the program. "They
are one way of trying to improve
relations in a university where
graduate research is so stressed."
Freshman are able to work
with full professors at a very close
level. The professors are paid an
honorarium.
Lynn Francis, secretary of the
program, notes that a wide variety
of courses are offered. This year,
for example, Professor Kurt
Steiner, Political Science, is
leading a course in War Crimes

Trials, while Professor James
Ingle, Jr., Geology, takes his frosh
to the seaside for a course on
"Nearshore Oceanography and the
Dynamics of Beaches."
The program is very appealing
to incoming students. Last year,
1331 of the 1434 incoming
freshmen requested a seminar.
Only 843 could be placed in the
12-student sections, since lack of
funding limits the number of
seminars offered.
Another problem arises out of
the proposal selection process.
The seminar subcommittee (of the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies) strives to keep the
offerings balanced across all
disciplines. High quality proposals
which might have become
freshman seminars have been
vetoed by the subcommittee
because too many proposals were
submitted on similar subjects.
Last year for example, Francis
notes that there were "too many
[proposals] is psychiatry. So we
had to balance."
But lthis balancing meant that
fewer frosh could be admitted
into the program, even though
neither funds nor good ideas were

lacking.
"If I were a freshman, I would
have a complaint if I didn't get
into a seminar," Francis says. But
she added, "We try. There aren't
enough spaces."
This eyar a new feature is being
introduced to the program.
Thirty-four of the seminars are
now based within a University
student residence. The seminar
instructor becomes the freshman
advisor for the group.
"It becomes a kind of group
experience," Goheen explains.
Results of this format for the
program will be analyzed when
the annual student evaluations of
the program are written.
Francis comments that other
universities are beginning to
initiate Stanford's freshman
seminars.

freshman seminars have been
vetoed by the subcommittee
because too many proposals were
submitted on similar subjects.
Last year for example, Francis
notes that there were "too many
[proposals] is psychiatry. So we
had to balance."
But lthis balancing meant that
fewer frosh could be admitted
into the program, even though
neither funds nor good ideas were

lacking.
"If I were a freshman, I would
have a complaint if I didn't get
into a seminar," Francis says. But
she added, "We try. There aren't
enough spaces."
This eyar a new feature is being
introduced to the program.
Thirty-four of the seminars are
now based within a University
student residence. The seminar
instructor becomes the freshman
advisor for the group.
"It becomes a kind of group
experience," Goheen explains.
Results of this format for the
program will be analyzed when
the annual student evaluations of
the program are written.
Francis comments that other
universities are beginning to
initiate Stanford's freshman
seminars.

"Bolts, Nuts, and People" and
"Communist China's Policy on
Literature" are two of the 79
Freshman Seminars being offered
this year.
The Freshman Seminar
Program, started by two
professors in 1965 as an
experiment in small group
learning has expanded to cover
topics in the humanities, social
sciences, and natural sciences and
technology.
"The seminars break down the
feeling that teachers and
professors are too removed from
students," says Professor John
Goheen, Philosophy the present
director of the program. "They
are one way of trying to improve
relations in a university where
graduate research is so stressed."
Freshman are able to work
with full professors at a very close
level. The professors are paid an
honorarium.
Lynn Francis, secretary of the
program, notes that a wide variety
of courses are offered. This year,
for example, Professor Kurt
Steiner, Political Science, is
leading a course in War Crimes

Trials, while Professor James
Ingle, Jr., Geology, takes his frosh
to the seaside for a course on
"Nearshore Oceanography and the
Dynamics of Beaches."
The program is very appealing
to incoming students. Last year,
1331 of the 1434 incoming
freshmen requested a seminar.
Only 843 could be placed in the
12-student sections, since lack of
funding limits the number of
seminars offered.
Another problem arises out of
the proposal selection process.
The seminar subcommittee (of the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies) strives to keep the
offerings balanced across all
disciplines. High quality proposals
which might have become
freshman seminars have been
vetoed by the subcommittee
because too many proposals were
submitted on similar subjects.
Last year for example, Francis
notes that there were "too many
[proposals] is psychiatry. So we
had to balance."
But lthis balancing meant that
