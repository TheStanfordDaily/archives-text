# Statistics Prof 'Faces' Data
## 
### GEORGE DOBBINS 
A picture is worth a thousand words, a
Chinese philosopher once said. According to
Statistics Professor Herman Chernoff, it is
worth quite a few numbers as well.
Chernoff has devised a method of analyzing
numerical data by expressing it as
computer-drawn human faces. He assigns each
number to a specific facial feature.
He feels that a person can look at a lot of
facially-ex pressed data all at once and come to
reliable conclusions both quickly and
efficiently. Mathematical analysis takes more
time.
The professor admits that his faces are not
as accurate as numbers, but, "You can quickly
look at the face and get an overview of what's
going on, and the main object of this is just to
give you a quick overview; it's not a precise
instrument."
Vary Variables
Presently, he is only able to assign 18
"variables," or different types of data to each
of his faces, although he emphasizes that,
"This was the simplest face I could draw; if
you wanted to put ears or hair on, you could
easily get up to 36 variables."
Chernoff adds, "The beautiful thing about
this is that it is the reverse of what's been
going on. We talk about artificial intelligence,
having the computers do the thinking for us,
but here we've used not the computer's ability
to think, but its brute power to draw faces for
us and leave the thinking to people. . ..
"Basically, I think the advantage of this is
that it's easier for people to look at the faces
to detect whatever regularities there are
because of the emotional impact, whereas
looking at the numbers is psychologically more
difficult, even for someone who is trained to
look at numbers.

"Recently, my secretary had a job trying to
separate two groups of faces. For one group,
her description was, These faces look like
they're smiling but tense.' The ability of
people to describe things in this manner gives
them greater flexibility than a computer
program has."
Mineral Project Screens
Chernoff has conducted eight research
projects using the computer face program. One
project conerned an analysis of the mineral
content of various core sampels taken from a
Colorado mountainside. Each of 53 samples
was represented by a row of twelve percentage
numbers or "variables," which were to be fed
into the computer.
Professor Chernoff let one number
represent the upper half outline of the face,
another, the lower half, a third, the mouth, etc.
The computer faces made it immediately
obvious where major changes in mineral
composition occurred in the mountainside.
In this case, the system was proven to be
both convenient and effective, but in research
conducted for the Stanford Law School, the
results were not positive.
Law School Study
The study involved 17 convicted
murderers, about half of whom had received
death sentences, and the other half life. The
students hoped to discover whether such
factors as the number of defense attorneys, or
prosecutors, the victim or defendant's race,
kinds of pleas or other variables could make
any significant difference in the outcome.
Unfortunately the study was inconclusive.
"The law school case was a more difficult
case partly because all of the variables were
yes/no and partly because I hadn't seriously
thought out the objectives to be attained, and
possibly because there is no very dominant

message in the data," states Professor
Chernoff. "With the geological data, I just
threw it into the computer and the faces told a
story."
Wide Use of Technique
The professor's technique has also been
used on botanical data for classifying flowers,
on marine biological data, on a study of
electrocardiograms aimed at identifying
potential heart victims and on an analysis of
rock samples from data supplied by geologists
at Clemson University.
This research is supported by an ONR
(Office of Naval Research) basic research
contract in stastistics. The current major
emphasis of this project concerns research on
cluster analysis, pattern recognition and other
theoretical problems involving high
dimensional multivariate data.
When asked if he gets bored by studying
only faces Chernoff responds, "Faces are
extremely powerful devices, but you can use
other things.. .. Some of my colleagues want
to know when I'll be using the female body,
but I'm not that ambitious. Seriously, the face
is easy to draw and it has a lot of richness to it.
I don't see much point in going beyond the
face.
