# 'Joy Of Cooking'
## Back In Berkeley 
### STUART ACKERMAN 
Just a short time ago people
might have scoffed at the idea of a
rock band led by two thirty-two
year old women ever making it to
the top, but the Joy of Cooking
has done just that, maturing from
a local, Berkeley based group into
a nationally known band with a
distinctive and very solid sound.
There are, of course, other
bands which feature female
singers, and several new bands
which are led by or composed
entirely of women, but no group
led by women is quite as top-level
as the Joy.
Terry Garthwaite, lead vocalist,
plays electric guitar and sings in a
raspy, Joplin-like voice, but with a
style that is still distinctively her
own. Her partner, Toni Brown,
writes many of the songs, sins,
and does a fine job on an electric
keyboard.
The three men in the group,
bassist Jeff Neighbor, drummer
Fritz Kasten, and Ron Wilson,
who sets a very heavy beat on the
congas, supply most of the strong
rhythm which pervades many of
the Joy's songs.
Capacity Crowd
The Joy of Cooking returned
home to Berkeley last I- riday
night after having taken an eight
week tour to promote their new
album "Closer to the Ground.
The capacity crowd at the
Berkeley Community Theatre was
more than happy to have them
back.
The Joy appeared with John
Fahey, who has been called "one
of the well-known unknowns of
folk music." Fahey, an
outstanding six and twelve string

acoustical guitarist, alter
recording eleven albums on two
lesser-known labels, Takoma and
Vanguard, has just signed a
contract with Warner Bros.
In his solo performance Friday,
Fahey demonstrated outstanding
technique, and the crowd was
impressed and perhaps awed by
his intricate and complex
arrangements. But because of that
intricacy he couldn't really get
through to and turn on a crowd
which was eager for the pounding
beat and recently matured sound
of the Joy.
Dancing In The Aisles
They started out easy with
some of their country-rock
numbers, and then really pleased
the audience with a very long and
very strong version of
"Brownsville-Mockingbird" that
had everyone in the theater on
their feet and dancing in the
aisles. The bad acoustics
notwithstanding, the crowd loved
the heavy gospel-rock beat of
"Brownsville" which was
combined with the strong
harmony which Terry Garthwaite
and Toni Brown's intertwining
voices produced.
The song was done in the more
free and confident style which the
group has developed and exhibits
in their new album, as opposed to
the all-too-polished and almost
"sterile" style in which the songs
on their first album (including the
well-known version of
"Brownsville") were performed.
After "Brownsville," 1 feel the
Joy made a mistake by
performing another country-rock
number, which failed to satisfy a

very hyped-up crowd, but they
soon returned to a heavier beat,
finishing with the title song of
their new album, "Closer to the
Ground," only to be called back
again and again by a wildly
stamping and shouting crowd to
perform three encores.

From the crowd's reaction
Friday night it seems that the Joy
of Cooking has progressed and
turned what was a good, but
perhaps overpolished sound into a
wild, free form of musical
expression which leaves few
people unaffected.

COOKING—Lead singer Terry Garthwaite is the central figure in the
Joy of Cooking which returned to Berkeley last Friday night after an
eight week national tour. The group is considered to be possibly the
best female-led rock group in America. They had a big AM hit with
"Brownsville-Mockingbird" a few months ago and have just released
their second album.
