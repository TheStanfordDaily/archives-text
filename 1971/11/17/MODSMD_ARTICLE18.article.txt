# Testament de Villon
## Operatic Wildfowl Fly 
### GARY SCHMIDGALL 
One of the strangest specimens
of operatic wildfowl flew the
coop in Berkeley Saturday night
when Ezra Pound's opera "Le
Testament de Villon" was given
its American premiere. This
one-act piece, composed in 1921,
was part of a multi-media
celebration of the problematical
American expatriate, which
included a reading from his
''Cantos" and a short
documentary from the BBC.
It is telling that the poetry,
read with an igniting sense of
purpose by two ACT stalwarts
Angela Paton and Mark Bramhall,
was the highlight of the evening.
The opera seemed so arcane and
inaccessible. Even the film,
showing Pound as pleasantly
crabbed and unbending, was more
interesting than the opera. At one
point the narrator says that Pound
has a way with words, and his
ex-mistress—who was in the
audience—added loudly, "and
ladies too."
Unfortunately, Pound does not
have a way with music. Although
he wrote musical criticism for
decades and was influential in the
Vivaldi revival, his "Le
Testament" is evidence—no pun
intended—that mere musical
knowledge does not necessarily
lead to great music.
Pound's text is taken verbatim
from the Middle French poet
Francois Villon, who was one of
the very first Renaissance men to
discover and relish in his own
individuality. Nearing his death
(at age 32), Villon wrote his long,
discursive last poetic will and
testament. His "Testament" is a
splendid, multi-faceted
achievement.
Fascinating Figure
Villon himself is a fascinating
figure. He was a vagabond, a thief,
a murderer, and generally a free
agent. It seems all too
coincidental that such an outcast
should appeal to Pound, and in
fact this identification causes one
of the major problems of the
opera.
Villon was a victim of society
who did not feel the rage of the
victimized, which is so natural to
Pound and our century. Villon at
I heart loved and reveled in the
society from which he was
I alienated and which incarcerated
I him. Pound himself is another
matter. He is, alternatively, the
hater and vilifier of the human
condition 20-th-century style (a
kind of Mencken-in-verse) and the
self-exiled recluse from the
modern mire, hermetically sealed
| off with his oriental ideograms or
I whatever philosophical artifact
currently fascinates him.
Thus, the reactions of Villon
and Pound to essentially the same
nasty view of civilization were
different, one might even say
antithetical. It was then perhaps
inevitable that the Villon in the
opera is really a medieval
reincarnation of Pound himself.
The exuberance, the humor of
ribaldry, the charm and humanity
of the Villon poetry are destroyed
by the more darksome Pound,
whose desire is to anatomize the
rotten corpse of modern life.

The choice of the Pound
poetry which prefaced the opera
emphasized this modern
morbidity: "Canto XIV," one of
the "Hell Cantos" is a nauseating,
excrementary frontal attack upon
the 20th century. Pound it is, and
any spiritual relationship to Villon
seems circumstantial.
Self-indulgent
Just as his way with the poetry
is self-indulgent, so also is Pound's
music typical of his poetic style:
obscure, archaelogical, terribly
learned, and—above all—deficient
as a form of artistic
communication. The style is a
strange jumble (like so many of
the "Cantos") of semi-melismatic
wanderings, earth-crawling
speech-rhythms, a little Webern,
and a little Stravinsky performed
by a small, oddly constituted
orchestra.
The medievalism of Pound's
music is affectatious, and its
modernity is overburdened by the
forms and conceits of early music.
Pound simply does not show the
compositional power to "see" a
musical vision into orchestration
(he needed help from his musician

friend Antheil as it was). Pound
may be a genius, but not in this
art form.
As Villon, Philip Booth gave a
solid baritone performance and
came across as quite magisterial
(fine for Pound but alien to
Villon). Since he never budged
from his stool the question of
acting was mooted. All the other
characters, grotesques of one sort
or another, sang well what they
had to sing. Aside from the music,
all other aspects of the production
were admirably conceived. These!
was a marvel of economy and the
costumes by Ariel Parkinson were
a real sartorial tour de force.
If nothing else, "Le
Testament" gave me the almost
unbearable desire to see Carl
Orff's "Carmina Burana"
(opening, propitiously enough,
tonight at the Opera). In
"Carmina" we have the finest,
most exhilirating coalescence of
medieval and modern musical
idioms ever written. Orff
communicates and Pound does
not; this is the secret to success in
opera-and the lesser art-forms as
well.

VILLON-Philip Booth appeared in the title role of Ezra Pound s
opera "Le Testament de Villon" which was performed for the first
time in America, last Saturday night at UC-Berkeley. The opera,
which was composed in 19 21, was presented with some readings from
other Pound works and a documentary film.
