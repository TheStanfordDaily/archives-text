# Chorica Dance Theatre Company Presents Theatrical Misconceptions
## 
### DOUG ARTHUR 
Theatrical misconceptions can sometimes be intriguing. For a few
minutes anyway. Such was the case with the Greek Chorica Dance
Theatre Company" last Sunday at Cal Berkeley
Somewhere Zouzou Nicoloudi got the idea of reaching "total and
effortless dramatic expression through unified training" in acting,
music and dancing. She put a great deal of effort into the venture and
her final expression is anything but dramatic.
It's certainly not acting; there is music (recorded), but I couldn't in
good conscience call the series of positions and bizarre movements
dancing. 1 suppose this little effort in fatuity was a stab at

choreography. Choreography which caused its two components oi
music and dancing (I use the term loosely) to appear equally
ridiculous. There was no acting to speak of.
It's an interesting idea, and ! don't believe the project would
necessarily be doomed to failure. And you can't beat the material:
"Agamemnon," "The Choephoroe," "Orestes," "The Eumenides,"
"The Bacchae" and"The Birds."
"Horrifying Dance"
The program notes the "horrifying dance 1 ol the furies. Well, the
furies weren't the only ones. Equally horrifying were most ol the
other arrangements.
A scene from "Agamemnon" began the program innocently
enough with the chorus of Argive elders, identically dressed in while
robes wigs, and masks, taking conscious steps forward while
mouthing the play. The chanting was recorded which made the elders
look twice as silly. Meanwhile, Cassandra writhed around downstage.
Actually, she didn't even writhe, but just threw her head back and
forth as she lay sprawled on the floor. Or, was that Electra? At any
rate, the emphasis continued to be upon stylized gestures which,
throughout the evening, became more unrestrained.
The Bacchantes for instrance performed such artistic and creative
things as their atrocious lunging movements, running around in a
circle, jumping in the air, banging their tambourines, and throwing
their heads up and down.
Good Scene
One scene, taken from "Orestes," did work. We view Electra s
anguish along with a sexual dance between Clytemnestra and
Aegisthus on a platform upstage. Electra\s black dress and clear
features contrast the masks and elaborate costumes (both by M. Ga/i)
of the Queen and her lover. The choreography was sufficiently lively
to create action rather than simply illustrating the music.
In most scenes however, gestures merely imitated the qualitv of
the music. It's like being told the same thing twice: it bores you, and
you begin to resent it.
The lowest point of the evening concerned a bastardization of
"The Birds." Fortunately for Aristophanes, this had nothing in
common with his play. Except that the male dancers wore beaks and
had feathers fastened to their tights. They threatened, ran around, and
fought each other; finally, the group sunk in a big heap.
Artistically, "Chorica" is a heap of superfluous gestures, recorded
noise and inane movement. The director had lamented the separate
categories of dancing, acting and music. Unfortunately, her company
could neither act nor dance!
