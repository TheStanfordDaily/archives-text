# SJC Action Thursday
## Senate To Reconsider Elections 
### TINA COOPER 
The Student Senate last night
reconsidered the validity of the recent
Senate elections, and called for
Administration representatives to
attend Thursday's Senate meeting to
discuss action on student nominations
to the selection committee for the
Stanford Judicial Council (SJC).
In other action at the meeting,
ASSU Council of Presidents member
Doug McHenry announced that the
Conference of New Voters had been
given 24 hours to leave the ASSU
offices.
In introducing the issue of the
election, the results of which the
Senate validated last Thursday,
McHenry said that "the students at the
overseas campuses have been
disenfranchised. Under the constitution
they, as members of the ASSU, have
the right to vote."
Many Letters
He mentioned the many letters
which have been received from the
overseas campuses protesting their
exclusion. Senator Beth Garfield stated
that a petition had been received from
the Italian campus protesting that
group's disenfranchisement.
McHenry concluded by requesting
that the Senate vote to consider itself
an interim organization until the
overseas campuses can vote.
Senator Willie Newberry commented
that if the Senate invalidated the
election results, the students would be
left without a representative body
during fall quarter. Several Senators
raised questions about the
constitutionality of an interim Senate,
and after extended debate, the Senate
moved that the issue be considered by
the Rules Committee and returned to
the floor as soon as possible.
Regarding the controversy
surrounding the Conference of New
Voters, whose slogan was "Dump
Nixon," McHenry said, "We (the
Council of Presidents) didn't know
some of the activities were going on.
We didn't know they were going to act
on a specific candidate.
"We met with University lawyers,
and then gave them (the conference
organizers) 24 hours to vacate the
Council of President's offices. Thev will

be out by tomorrow night—before their
official work on campus is finished."
'Diamond Lied To'
Larry Diamond, a member of the
Council of Presidents who is active in
the planning of the conference was not
present at the meeting. When asked if
Diamond had also been deluded by the
organizers of the event, McHenry
replied, "Diamond had been lied to by
those people several times."
Reached by the Daily after the
meeting. Diamond said, "They never
deliberately deceived me; the problem
was they did not keep either me or the

Council as a whole informed of how
they were using our names, office and
facilities."
Senate Chairman James Jefferson
said he had spoken with President
Lyman about the current impasse faced
by the SJC. Jefferson termed Lyman's
comments "vague."
Mike Dawson proposed that the
Senate request the Administration to
send representatives to the regular
Senate meeting Thursday night to
discuss the issue. President Lyman's
deadline for Senate action on the SJC
crisis is Friday.
