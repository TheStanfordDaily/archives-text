The Stanford Soccer Team
shut out Cal State Hayward 2-0
Tuesday after falling to the
number two team in the country,
UCLA, 5-0. The split leaves
Stanford with a 5-6-2 record,
5-4-2 in league play.
The problem of a weak offense
again plagued Stanford. So far this
season, they have only scored 16
goals in their 13 games. This total

represents the least scoring in
Coach Priddle's 20 years here at
Stanford. The blanking by UCLA
marked the fourth time Stanford
has been shutout this season.
The defense, led by goalie Walt
Harris' four shutouts, would have
been more than adequate any
other year. But with the few
scores this season, the 28 goals
allowed virtually doubled the
Cards' offensive output.

Stanford, in an attempt to
subdue the explosive UCLA
offense, used an unconventional
set-up of 9 men on defense. For
the first half the plan seemed to
work. Stanford held UCLA even
in the first quarter, with the
Indians coming close to scoring a
few times. In the second quarter,
however, UCLA's Agenafer broke
through on the left wing, and
scored the first goal of the game.
The score remained 1-0 at half.
In the second half, UCLA ran
away with the game. Scoring two
goals in both the third and fourth
quarters, UCLA turned a close

game into a 5-0 rout. The nine
men back for Stanford were
unable to get on offense fast
enough in the second half, making
it easy for the Bruins to shut out
the Cards.
Against Cal State Hay ward,
Stanford returned to its
conventional six man defense.
Outshooting Cal State Hayward
16-6, Stanford scored on a
rebound shot by Sam Casey in the
second quarter. They put an
insurance goal in late in the third
quarter on a Larry Geise cross
from the right side.


CROSS THAT LINE' DARE YA San Jose State ran for only 32 yards through the Thunder Chickens who are shown above waiting to see if
the Spartans are going to come out of the huddle and try to move past them again. Not many people have accomplished much against the
fearsome foursome of Pierre Perreault (90) who weighs in at 228, Larry Butler (73) 237 lbs., Pete Lazetich (78) 244 lbs., and Greg Sampson
(91) 240 lbs. Not pictured is Roger Cowan who missed the SJS game because of a virus. Cowan is no baby either, weighing 235 and standing
6'5". Defensive halfback Tim Robnett is shown to the left of Perreault and linebackers Mike Simone and Jeff Siemon stand in back of the
Thunder Chickens to catch anyone who might slip past the front line. The seven men in the above picture have made a total of 472 tackles so
far this season.
