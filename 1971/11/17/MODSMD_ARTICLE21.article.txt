### CHRIS COUNIHAN 
After routing the University of
San Francisco for the second
straight time, the Stanford Ice
Hockey team's three game
winning streak came to a halt at
>r the hands of a strong San
Francisco Seals club as the Cards
dropped their second game of the
year by a score of 7-3.
Will Mcllvaine led the Indian
attack with five goals in the romp
over the Dons of USF. He scored
the first three Stanford goals in
the 20-2 rout. John Mackall and
Eddie Leonard recorded hat tricks
for the Cards.
On Sunday, the Indians faced a
much improved San Francisco
club. The Seals' depth and
strength in the corners had
improved a great deal from last
year.
Stanford jumped out in front
early in the game as they scored
two quick goals. On the first, Pat
Baldwin's shot from the point
caught the Seal goalie out of
position. The second score came
as Will Mcllvaine rushed into the
Seal zone. With no one to pass to
he elected to shoot from just
inside the blue line. The slapshot
was partially stopped by the San
Francisco netminder but the puck
dribbled in and the Cards were
ahead, 2-0.
The second period was a
complete turnaround. The Seals
gained the momentum early. They
tallied three times in five minutes
and though the Cards also had
their chances, they were thwarted
by the San Francisco defense. The
Seals dominated the rest of the

game as they were able to keep
the Cards' offense in check and
earned a 3-2 victory.
Though Stanford's record is
3-2-1, the Cards have salvaged
only a tie in three games against
San Francisco, Belmont, and the
Berkeley Juniors. The Indians
must do better against those
teams if they are to be in
contention for first place.
The Cards face the San
Francisco Seals on Friday, Belmont
the following Tuesday, and
Berkeley the Monday after
Thanksgiving.
