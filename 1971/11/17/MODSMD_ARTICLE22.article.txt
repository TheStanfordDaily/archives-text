# Poloists Lose To Cal
## 
### 
The Stanford water polo squad dropped its third Pac-8 game
last Saturday to Cal, 13-11, but the Indians still managed to
remain in second place in the conference, assuring them of a bid
to the NCAA Championships later this month in Long Beach.
The Bears avenged a loss to Stanford earlier in the season
with their narrow victory Saturday morning in the Stanford
Pool. The Indian poloists had an easier time, however, on
Friday as they rolled to an easy 11-6 victory over the University
of the Pacific.
The draws for the NCAA Championship Tournament will be
made on Monday, November 22nd. San Jose State, UCLA, and
Stanford will probably be the top-ranked teams in the
competition.
