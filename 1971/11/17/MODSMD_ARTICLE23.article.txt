## Last Minute Heroics 
### Charlie Hoffman 
The Stanford Indians are going
to meet the Oakland Raiders of
Pac-8 football this Saturday, and
if the game is not decided until
the final minutes of the fourth
quarter, Coach John Ralston's
men may find themselves in
trouble.
California is 4-2 in Pac-8
unofficial competition, and the
Bears have won all four of their
"conference" contests in the final
seconds. Led by substitute
quarterback Jay Cruze, Cal edged
Oregon State by three points with
no time left on the clock in its
first clash with a Pac-8 club early
this season.
The following week, the Bears
from Berkeley put the winning
points on the board with 1:06
remaining to grab a 24-23 victory
over WSU. Cal scored a
touchdown the next week against
UCLA to break a tie with 1:19
left in the game and hand the
hapless Bruins a 31-24 loss.
Finally, the Bears racked up their
fourth last minute win last
weekend against Oregon, pushing
over the winning touchdown with
:54 remaining in the fourth
quarter to upset the Ducks, 17-10.
Starting quarterback Reed
Chastang was injured in Cal
opening game loss to Arkansas
and Jay Cruze was forced into
emergency duty. Cruze and the
Bears swept past West Virginia
20-10 and San Jose State 34-10
after their initial 51-20
humiliation at the hands of the
Razorbacks. Cal was destroyed by
Ohio State 35-3 in its fourth game
and then embarked upon a seven
game schedule against Pac-8
opponents that will end this
weekend in Palo Alto.
Only Southern Cal and

Washington have been able to
handle the suspended Bears since
the Ohio State debacle. Both
teams' margins of victory were
impressive, however, as the
Trojans shut out Cal 28-0 and the
Huskies rolled to an effortless
30-7 win.
Since Stanford handily
defeated both conference
conquerors of Cal, it would seem
likely that the Indians would have
an easy time beating the Bears in
the 74th annual Big Game. Las
Vegas oddsmakers have agreed
with this analysis as they have
installed the Cards as solid 13'/2
point favorites.
This point spread does not
bode well for the Cards since they
have been heavily favored by 17
to 24 points in all three of the
losses they have incurred this
season.
Last year the Rose Bowl bound
Indians marched into Memorial
Stadium with an 8-2 record to
face a relatively weak Berkeley
squad that could manage only a
5-5 season mark.
Once again Stanford is headed
for t h e Roses and is coming off an
embaTas-ing non-conference loss
(last year i f was Air Forcp). The
Indians will a vastly
improved Cal squad that can win
the unofficial Pac-8 Championship
with a win over the Cards.
The Bears' Sports Information
Director Bob Steiner explains the
attitude of Cal towards the Big
Game. "Aside from anything else,
this is the Big Game. But, add to
it the possibility that the winner
may be the Rose Bowl
representative. Even if this does
not prove to be the case,
California certainly feels that it is
playing for the Pacific-8

championship, official or
otherwise."
A near sellout crowd will
watch a game Saturday where all
the rulebooks are thrown out.
Barring court action, Stanford will
go to the Rose Bowl regardless of
the results of the Big Game. But if
tiie Indians lose, they would go to
Pasadena only because the better
team was suspended on a
technicality, and no one wants to
be pretender to the throne.

conquerors of Cal, it would seem
likely that the Indians would have
an easy time beating the Bears in
the 74th annual Big Game. Las
Vegas oddsmakers have agreed
with this analysis as they have
installed the Cards as solid 13'/2
point favorites.
This point spread does not
bode well for the Cards since they
have been heavily favored by 17
to 24 points in all three of the
losses they have incurred this
season.
Last year the Rose Bowl bound
Indians marched into Memorial
Stadium with an 8-2 record to
face a relatively weak Berkeley
squad that could manage only a
5-5 season mark.
Once again Stanford is headed
for t h e Roses and is coming off an
embaTas-ing non-conference loss
(last year i f was Air Forcp). The
Indians will a vastly
improved Cal squad that can win
the unofficial Pac-8 Championship
with a win over the Cards.
The Bears' Sports Information
Director Bob Steiner explains the
attitude of Cal towards the Big
Game. "Aside from anything else,
this is the Big Game. But, add to
it the possibility that the winner
may be the Rose Bowl
representative. Even if this does
not prove to be the case,
California certainly feels that it is
playing for the Pacific-8

championship, official or
otherwise."
A near sellout crowd will
watch a game Saturday where all
the rulebooks are thrown out.
Barring court action, Stanford will
go to the Rose Bowl regardless of
the results of the Big Game. But if
tiie Indians lose, they would go to
Pasadena only because the better
team was suspended on a
technicality, and no one wants to
be pretender to the throne.
The Stanford Indians are going
to meet the Oakland Raiders of
Pac-8 football this Saturday, and
if the game is not decided until
the final minutes of the fourth
quarter, Coach John Ralston's
men may find themselves in
trouble.
California is 4-2 in Pac-8
unofficial competition, and the
Bears have won all four of their
"conference" contests in the final
seconds. Led by substitute
quarterback Jay Cruze, Cal edged
Oregon State by three points with
no time left on the clock in its
first clash with a Pac-8 club early
this season.
The following week, the Bears
from Berkeley put the winning
points on the board with 1:06
remaining to grab a 24-23 victory
over WSU. Cal scored a
touchdown the next week against
UCLA to break a tie with 1:19
left in the game and hand the
hapless Bruins a 31-24 loss.
Finally, the Bears racked up their
fourth last minute win last
weekend against Oregon, pushing
over the winning touchdown with
:54 remaining in the fourth
quarter to upset the Ducks, 17-10.
Starting quarterback Reed
Chastang was injured in Cal
opening game loss to Arkansas
and Jay Cruze was forced into
emergency duty. Cruze and the
Bears swept past West Virginia
20-10 and San Jose State 34-10
after their initial 51-20
humiliation at the hands of the
Razorbacks. Cal was destroyed by
Ohio State 35-3 in its fourth game
and then embarked upon a seven
game schedule against Pac-8
opponents that will end this
weekend in Palo Alto.
Only Southern Cal and

Washington have been able to
handle the suspended Bears since
the Ohio State debacle. Both
teams' margins of victory were
impressive, however, as the
Trojans shut out Cal 28-0 and the
Huskies rolled to an effortless
30-7 win.
Since Stanford handily
defeated both conference
conquerors of Cal, it would seem
likely that the Indians would have
an easy time beating the Bears in
the 74th annual Big Game. Las
