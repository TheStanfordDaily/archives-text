# Bomb Scare Routs Students
## 
### 
Students from all six dormitories in Lagunita Court were
evacuated for almost three hours early this morning after an
unidentified person called the campus switchboard operator
and said that two bombs would explode in the complex at
1:45 a.m.
The midnight warning came as Stanford fire and police
units were already en route to the rear of Lagunita Court in
response to a report of a motorcycle on fire.
When they reached the scene, however, students had put
out the fire, which appeared to have been set. The fuel
from the motorcycle's gas tank was used to set it ablaze
after it was pushed against a parked car. Students turned
over to police a note found on the windshield of another car
parked nearby which said, "White Man We Want Our Land
Back" and was signed "Venceremos 13."
The owner of the burned motorcycle, Earl Young, a
junior from Hawaii, could offer no explanation as to why
someone might want to set it on fire. The machine was
extensively damaged in the blaze, the car next to it had
only minor damage to the paint.
The fire department bomb squad searched the exterior
and areas of public access inside Lagunita but found no
explosives. Individual rooms were not searched.
At 12:15 a.m. Assistant Fire Chief John Barr advised the
300 evacuated students that they would have to stay out of
the building until 3 a.m. Some of the students went to the
women's gym, which was opened for their use, while others
disappeared into other dorms.
The students encamped in the women's gym took
advantage of the many facilities there, engaging in
basketball games, co-ed volleyball, playing Chopin waltzes
on the piano, studying, sleeping, or just sitting around.
One girl huddled in a nightgown in the corner of the
dance studio muttered, "I assumed it would be a practice
drill, the fire exit was propped open and it seemed too easy
to be a real fire."
Most people adjusted amicably to their new quarters as
some did not really care about the cause of their eviction.
Some even found romance on this hectic night. Chuck
Glenn said that, "I met this girl I had not met before and
now Dorothy and I are good friends. We have a date in the
city Wednesday night."
This was the third reported bomb scare this fall, the
previous ones were directed against Soto House in Wilbur
and the Aretha Franklin concert im Maples Pavilion. There
were no explosives found in any of the incidents.
