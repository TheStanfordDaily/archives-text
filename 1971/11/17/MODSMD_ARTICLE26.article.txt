Mayor Sam Tosses Hat
LOS ANGELES â€” Mayor Sam Yorty took the biggest
political plunge of his career yesterday and announced he is
a candidate for the Democratic nomination for President.
He conceded it would be "an uphill fight."
Yorty, 62, said he would enter the New Hampshire
primary election, first in the nation, and then decide which
others to enter.
"We have no intention of trying to raise the huge sums
of money necessary to enter all of the primaries," he
declared in his gruff baritone voice at a news conference.
"We will be selective. The California primary will climax
our campaign. Other states may be added as the campaign
progresses."
The third-term mayor of the nation's third largest city,
whose own campaign literature has described him as a
"political maverick," said, "My position on the issues will
be that of a moderate Democrat," explaining he felt this
would appeal to party members dissatisfied both with
"left-wing Democratic leaders" and President Nixon.
Yorty, a longtime hawk on Vietnam, criticized Nixon's
troop withdrawals in Southeast Asia as "playing into the
hands of the doves" and added that he always has
maintained the United States should have tried harder to
win the war.
Sen. Henry Jackson, D-Wash., announced meanwhile in
Los Angeles and San Francisco that he hadn't made up his
mind whether to seek the Democratic nomination but
would hold a news conference Friday in Washington, D.C.,
that would be "political." "The more the merrier," Jackson
exclaimed in San Francisco when he heard Yorty was
running.
Import Surcharge Upheld
WASHINGTON - The Senate voted 53 to 29 to grant
President Nixon authority to impose a 15 per cent
surcharge on imports into the United States, in place of the
present 10 per cent levy.
It voted in the same action to grant Nixon authority to
impose quotas on any products coming into this country.
Sen. Wallace F. Bennett, R-Utah, said the administration
had sought the provision and had no present intention of
using it but wanted it retained in the bill.
The powers could be invoked when the President finds a
serious international balance-of-payments emergency exists.
