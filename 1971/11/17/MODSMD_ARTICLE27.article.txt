# Closed Hearings In Dolly Case
## 
### GLENN GARVIN JON TEPPER 
Grievance Board Chairman Doug
DuPenn yesterday offered to hold
"completely confidential" sessions in
the hearing of fired Hospital worker
John Dolly in order to protect
witnesses who admit participation in
the April hospital sit-in.
Dolly, who was fired for taking part
in the sit-in, did not make an
immediate reply.
The administration submitted a brief
to the Board last week stating that
witnesses would not be prosecuted for
the mere admission of being present at
the sit-in before 4:30 p.m. on April
police ordered demonstrators
out of the hospital—but refused to
grant immunity for specific acts that
may have been committed.
Testimony at yesterday's three-hour
session centered around the question of
whether or not the two-day sit-in
interfered significantly in the running
of the Hospital and patient care.
Wilson Testifies
Dr. John Wilson, Hospital Chief of
Staff during the disturbance of April
8-9, claimed that while there was no
direct interference in the care of
patients, the sit-in did hurt the Hospital
in administrative ways. He gave no
specific instances, however.
Dr. Halsted Holman, who at the
time chaired the Department of
Medicine, said, "I don't think you can
say it (the demonstration)
compromised patient care. It may have
upset some patients, I don't
know ... the real issue is exposing
conditions which, if uncorrected,
would compromise patient care."
He told of a meeting with blacks and
chicanos that revealed injustices that
"astonished" him. They complained,
for instance, that it was usually a black
or chicano that cleaned up the mess left
by an emergency call.

Holman added that, "I don't think
anybody would deny the hospital was
widely disrupted by that whole action"
in reference to the police charge that
finally cleared out the demonstrators.
Police Charge
Holman also testified as to what he
saw of the police charge, which turned
out to be very little since Holman
found it difficult to see over the high
barricades erected by demonstrators.
Defense counsel Linda Crouse asked if
he had seen any clubbing by the police.
Homan hesitated a few seconds, then
said, "I think so." He said most of the

demonstrators he treated after the
charge suffered from blows to the head.
"I can't recall a single good
development at Stanford in the last five
to seven years that was not prompted
by this sort of thing," he answered in
reply to a question about whether
disruptive techniques were necessary to
effect change.
In earlier testimony, Wilson
admitted that he hadn't seen Dolly at
the sit-in, and that demonstrators told
him no one person was responsible for
the action.
The hearing will continue Thursday
at 11 a.m. in Mll2 at the Hospital.

conditions which, if uncorrected,
would compromise patient care."
He told of a meeting with blacks and
chicanos that revealed injustices that
"astonished" him. They complained,
for instance, that it was usually a black
or chicano that cleaned up the mess left
by an emergency call.

Holman added that, "I don't think
anybody would deny the hospital was
widely disrupted by that whole action"
in reference to the police charge that
finally cleared out the demonstrators.
Police Charge
Holman also testified as to what he
saw of the police charge, which turned
out to be very little since Holman
found it difficult to see over the high
barricades erected by demonstrators.
Defense counsel Linda Crouse asked if
he had seen any clubbing by the police.
Homan hesitated a few seconds, then
said, "I think so." He said most of the

demonstrators he treated after the
charge suffered from blows to the head.
"I can't recall a single good
development at Stanford in the last five
to seven years that was not prompted
by this sort of thing," he answered in
reply to a question about whether
disruptive techniques were necessary to
effect change.
In earlier testimony, Wilson
admitted that he hadn't seen Dolly at
the sit-in, and that demonstrators told
him no one person was responsible for
the action.
The hearing will continue Thursday
at 11 a.m. in Mll2 at the Hospital.
Grievance Board Chairman Doug
DuPenn yesterday offered to hold
"completely confidential" sessions in
the hearing of fired Hospital worker
John Dolly in order to protect
witnesses who admit participation in
the April hospital sit-in.
Dolly, who was fired for taking part
in the sit-in, did not make an
immediate reply.
The administration submitted a brief
to the Board last week stating that
witnesses would not be prosecuted for
the mere admission of being present at
the sit-in before 4:30 p.m. on April
police ordered demonstrators
out of the hospital—but refused to
grant immunity for specific acts that
may have been committed.
Testimony at yesterday's three-hour
session centered around the question of
whether or not the two-day sit-in
interfered significantly in the running
of the Hospital and patient care.
Wilson Testifies
Dr. John Wilson, Hospital Chief of
Staff during the disturbance of April
8-9, claimed that while there was no
direct interference in the care of
patients, the sit-in did hurt the Hospital
in administrative ways. He gave no
specific instances, however.
Dr. Halsted Holman, who at the
time chaired the Department of
Medicine, said, "I don't think you can
say it (the demonstration)
compromised patient care. It may have
upset some patients, I don't
know ... the real issue is exposing
conditions which, if uncorrected,
would compromise patient care."

chicanos that revealed injustices that
