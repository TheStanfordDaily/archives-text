## 
### ROBERT BACON 
About 20 people briefly entered the
Placement Center yesterday following a
noon rally, but spoke to no recruiters
and left after a short time.
Another rally to protest recruiting
on campus by defense contractors has
been scheduled for this afternoon at
12:30 p.m. in front of the Center.
This afternoon, the Association of
Young Crows, which seeks to expose
war-related research at Stanford, will
present its "Red Hot Professor" awards
to the five top vote-getters in its recent
popularity poll of Defense research
contracts, plus an additional award "for
long-time service." Winners will be
announced at the rally.
The Young Crows say that should
the winners not appear at the rally,
they will go to the researchers' offices
to make the presentations.
Scheduled for the Placement Center
today are representatives of
Philco-Ford, the Lawrence Radiation

Laboratories, Gulf Energy and
Environmental Systems, Inc., and
Applied Technology, Inc.
Yesterday, demonstrators discussed
Placement Center policies and
procedures briefly with Center Director
Ralph Keller. Later, some attempted to
arrange recruiting for Venceremos and
the National Liberation Front at the
Center.
A handful of protesters stood
outside the interview rooms in the
Center for a short time but did not talk
to the recruiters. They were observed
and photographed by University
photographers.
The group dwindled away and was
nearly all gone by 2:15 p.m. an hour
after they had entered the building.
At the Center yesterday were
representatives of the U.S. Navy,
General Research Corporation, the
