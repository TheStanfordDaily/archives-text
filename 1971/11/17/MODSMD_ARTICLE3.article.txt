## 
### JIM WASCHER 
In an effort to increase student
power in electoral politics, an estimated
1600 Bay area students will gather
tomorrow evening at 8:30 p.m. in
Memorial Auditorium to voice their
opposition to President Nixon and the
Vietnam War.
Main speakers at the rally will be
Republican Congressman and
Presidential candidate Paul N. ("Pete")
McCloskey, .Jr. (R-San Mateo); former
New York Congressman A Hard K.
Lowenstein (now Chairman of the
Americans for Democratic Action);
Senator Alan Cranston (Dem.-Calif.)
and John Kerry, spokesman of the
Vietnam Veterans Against the War.
The "Emergency Conference of New
Voters" is being organized by the
student body presidents of 19 local
colleges and universities to "ignite
students into seizing the political
process to change the country,"
according to ASSU co-president Larry
Diamond.
The student leaders feel that
although President Nixon is winding
down that war for middle class
American college students, he is
increasing the horrors for the victims of
our bombing policy in Cambodia
and the two Vietnams. They assert that
the President has no moral justification

for his policies and that he has been
dishonest in presenting those policies
and their effects to the American
people.

represented at the rally have 189,000
potential voters enrolled as students, a

out of office."

Riegle, Jr. (Rep.-Mich.); State Senate
