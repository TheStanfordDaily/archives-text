# Urban Campus
## SCIRE Seeks Foundation Aid, Approval 
### 
By GLENN GARVIN
An urban campus in San Francisco may be a reality by
the beginning of spring quarter.
Project coordinator Gail Bingham expects to obtain
sufficient foundation financing for the program to start it
on a small scale this spring.
SCIRE (Student Center for Innovation and Research in
Education) has been nursing along the idea of the campus
for nearly a year.
Bingham envisions a living group in San Francisco,
where students would work as interns in a chosen
field—communication, art, sociology, anything—and then
share their experiences with other students through seminar
meetings in the evening.
The internships would place a student in a job at least
loosely related to whatever field he or she intends to pursue
after college.
An engineering student, for instance, could work in the
construction and planning division of an urban renewal
program. Specific details will be worked out as the program
comes closer to being a reality.
There would be one or two groups of 30 students, each
organized around a general theme. Bingham hopes to
obtain 10 units of credit per quarter for the internships,
plus another five or six for the seminar.
Several Alternatives
She says there are alternatives to the live-in group
arrangement; for example, students could form a house on
campus built around a theme and commute to San
Francisco, but she feels that the living group based in the
city is the best idea because, she said, "The center of
society is in the city."
"That's where economic and political interactions are
taking place, that's where ecology programs are taking
place, in fact, that's where the ecological problems start.
That's where medical and health care problems are the
most dire, engineering and construction problems are;
where nearly everything is or starts out from," Bingham said.
The program has apparently snagged on financial
matters. No one is -opposed to the concept of an urban
campus, but money is a problem right now.
"We think we'll have the money ready by spring,"
Bingham said. "I have my doubts about financing," said
Dean -James Gibbs, Dean of Undergraduate Studies.
I he SCIRE outline on the project estimates $45,000
expenses for a full year of campus operation. The money
could come from the University or from a private
foundation.

For internal (Stanford) financing, the proposition would
have to bo in around December 1; for external (foundation)
funding, the deadline would be somewhat later.
SCIRE isn't eliminating either possibility right now, but
Bingham says the "route they'll most likely take is private
funding. We feel there is opportunity for finance through
alumni contributions and foundation support to initiate the
program," she said.
Gibbs points out that foundation grants aren't
perpetual. Usually a foundation will carry a project for no
more than five years, after which they expect it to stand on
its own feet. "And they won't usually support it if they
don't think it's permanent," he adds. "They want the name
of Ford Foundation or whatever to live on through the
ages."
Place In Budget
"We think that by that time the campus would prove
itself to the University, to be of enough value to win a
place in the budget," Bingham replies.
"The competition is going to be tough," Gibbs insists.
He points to the Budget Adjustment Program, which is
trying to balance the University budget by cutting off $6
million over the next four years.
The accreditation for the program must come through
Gibbs and Edwin Good, chairman of the Undergraduate
Studies Committee. Final approval for the whole program
is up to the Provost's staff.
One principal drawback is that SCIRE has not as yet
presented names of professors willing to work on the
program, coordinating seminars. Since teaching loads are
usually set nine months in advance, that could be a major
roadbiock to getting the campus operating in the spring.
SCIRE is working on it.
Two Surveys
"We're in the midst of two surveys," Bingham says.
"One is of the entire student body, to make sure that there
is interest in this thing. The other is of faculty members,
and will be followed up by informal discussions with
faculty."
Gibbs stresses that whenever the University adds a new
program, it affects many other facets of the system. For
instance, if 60 students are spending the year in San
Francisco, it would moan Stanford could admit another 60
applicants. "Does the University want 60 more students?
he asks. "What kind of budget adjustments would that,
require? We would have to check with all the parts of the
University that would be affected."

could come from the University or from a private
foundation.

Bingham says the "route they'll most likely take is private

perpetual. Usually a foundation will carry a project for no
more than five years, after which they expect it to stand on
its own feet. "And they won't usually support it if they
don't think it's permanent," he adds. "They want the name
of Ford Foundation or whatever to live on through the
ages."
Place In Budget
"We think that by that time the campus would prove
itself to the University, to be of enough value to win a
place in the budget," Bingham replies.
"The competition is going to be tough," Gibbs insists.
He points to the Budget Adjustment Program, which is
trying to balance the University budget by cutting off $6
million over the next four years.
The accreditation for the program must come through
Gibbs and Edwin Good, chairman of the Undergraduate
Studies Committee. Final approval for the whole program
is up to the Provost's staff.
One principal drawback is that SCIRE has not as yet
presented names of professors willing to work on the
program, coordinating seminars. Since teaching loads are
usually set nine months in advance, that could be a major
roadbiock to getting the campus operating in the spring.
SCIRE is working on it.
Two Surveys
"We're in the midst of two surveys," Bingham says.
"One is of the entire student body, to make sure that there
is interest in this thing. The other is of faculty members,
and will be followed up by informal discussions with
faculty."
Gibbs stresses that whenever the University adds a new
program, it affects many other facets of the system. For
instance, if 60 students are spending the year in San
Francisco, it would moan Stanford could admit another 60
applicants. "Does the University want 60 more students?
he asks. "What kind of budget adjustments would that,
require? We would have to check with all the parts of the
University that would be affected."

An urban campus in San Francisco may be a reality by
the beginning of spring quarter.
Project coordinator Gail Bingham expects to obtain
sufficient foundation financing for the program to start it
on a small scale this spring.
SCIRE (Student Center for Innovation and Research in
Education) has been nursing along the idea of the campus
for nearly a year.
Bingham envisions a living group in San Francisco,
where students would work as interns in a chosen
field—communication, art, sociology, anything—and then
share their experiences with other students through seminar
meetings in the evening.
The internships would place a student in a job at least
loosely related to whatever field he or she intends to pursue
after college.
An engineering student, for instance, could work in the
construction and planning division of an urban renewal
program. Specific details will be worked out as the program
comes closer to being a reality.
There would be one or two groups of 30 students, each
organized around a general theme. Bingham hopes to
obtain 10 units of credit per quarter for the internships,
plus another five or six for the seminar.
Several Alternatives
She says there are alternatives to the live-in group
arrangement; for example, students could form a house on
campus built around a theme and commute to San
Francisco, but she feels that the living group based in the
city is the best idea because, she said, "The center of
society is in the city."
"That's where economic and political interactions are
taking place, that's where ecology programs are taking
