A Return to McCarthyism?
Chairman of Advisory Board: Dr.
Kennedy,
May I respectfully remind your
committee that any
recommendation to fire Dr.
Franklin is equivalent to
recommending a long term prison
sentence.
I am very deeply concerned
because I vividly remember The
McCarthy period. Many men and
women, some as well known as
"The Hollywood Ten", Philip
Oppenheimer, and literally
thousands of other lesser known
people listed in "The Little Red
Book" lost their jobs, some never
knowing why.
Many were unable to secure
jobs for many years in their own
field or for that matter in other
fields. Many, some of whom I
knew, suffered economically as
well as psychologically and never
recovered. Their wives and
children also suffered untold
hardships. No criminal could
suffer more.
I am fearful because I sense a
pattern developing. We must be
sensitive and alert to prevent it. It
happened before The McCarthy
era, such as the Palmer Raids. It
can happen again.
Let me add that I feel a deep
empathy for Dr. Franklin because
of his early involvement against
the war long before the rest of the
community was willing to take
action.

I urge your committee to
carefully consider the long-term
consequences of your decision not
only for the Franklin family but
for all the people of this country.

Mr. Lenny Siegel,
c/o Editor, THE DAILY:
Dear Mr. Siegel,
Your recent letter to President
Lyman published in Wednesday's
Daily reminded me of a concern I
have long held.
As you know, I have followed
your career at Stanford with great
interest, including your long range
plans for the School of
Engineering. Being this well
informed of your talents and
aims, I have been naturally greatly
worried by your candidacy for
Dean of Engineering. Should you
be selected, the Pacific Studies
Center will have suffered a blow
which not even Joel Yudken can
repair.
Therefore, in consideration of
the sacrifice you have offered to

make, I want you to know that I
offer my services as Director of
PSC should Stanford make you
Dean of Engineering. My
qualifications for this office are
public knowledge. My first act on
assuming duty as Director will be
to institute a strict publish or
perish policy: failure to publish at
least one article per quarter in a
computer journal of my choosing
will be considered grounds for
dismissal.
Lots of luck,
Gene F. Franklin,
Professor of Electrical Engineering,
Associate Provost for Computing
Ticket Prices Outrageous
Editor, THE DAILY:
It appears that the only group
of persons not protected by
President Nixon's wage and price
freeze are students. First, we all
found that tuition had increased
by not inconsiderable
amounts—this, or course, was
specifically exempted from the
freeze. A little later, when we
went round to renew our
students' supplemental health
insurance with Blue Cross, we
found that the premiums had

been raised by approximately 50%
from the previous quarter. This
increase was not explained or even
referred to by Blue Cross, and
very cleverly was not dated (that
presumably fooled us all into
believing that the not - discussed -
therefore - non - existent increase
in premium was effected before
the price freeze went into effect).
Now, students are being asked
to pay an amount of $8 or $10
for a Rose Bowl ticket, increases
of 100% or 125% over the price
paid last year. Unless it is believed
by the Rose Bowl Committee that
the game will provide twice as
much pleasure (perhaps it will last
120 minutes), I cannot see any
justification for this increase.
School football exists for the
enjoyment of students as well as
for the treasury of schools in the
PAC-8, or so I would have
innocently thought. Now, to be
fair to the Administration of
Stanford University and to the
Athletics Department, I
understand that the proposed
student ticket price emanated
from a Committee representing
the two conferences. But, I would
ask both the Administration and
the Athletics Department to put

whatever pressure they can on the
Committee BEFORE IT IS TOO
LATE.
For $10, I can buy a lot of
beer, and enjoy the spectacle on
TV; in doing so, I will also save
the fare down to LA and will
deprive the Committee of at least
one check (presumably one of
many) for $10.

Dear Prof. Cohn
Editor, THE DAILY:
I am writing in reference to
Prof. Robert Cohn's article of
Nov. 10 and 11, "The Crisis of
Sexual Identity." Aside from the
purely sexist aspects of the article
— (which I found too many and
too revolting to want to even
begin to go into), it has been a
long time since I've read such
circumloquacious, pompous and
meaningless drivel.
In addition to the rampant
name-dropping, the melange (or
better, hodge-podge) of odds and
ends of Sartre, Buber, Eastern
Mysticism, shreds of traditional
philosophy — mostly out of
context — plus a fable for good
measure, left me breathless.
Prof. Cohn has not proved his
point (if there was a point); he has
merely confirmed my opinion
that just because a person has a
Ph.D. there is no guarantee that
he has grown beyond
pseudo-intellectualism and just
plain fatuousness.
I suggest that Prof. Cohn read
The Feminine Mystique — or have
his wife read it to him. He might
learn something from it — both as
to the actual problems of women
today, and as to proper methods
of researching one's topics before
spewing them on paper.

More Bonfire Fire
Editor, THE DAILY:
I would like to commend
Messieurs Barnum and Sayre for
the excellent letters concerning
the big game bonfire. Their
castigation of the event was both
articulate and cogent.
The bonfire is a prime example
of "liberal" rhetoric, where the
supposedly sincere words are
betrayed by the subsequent

actions. This community is known
for its ecological sensitivity, yet it
condones an activity that
produces approximately 4.37 tons
of air contaminant emissions.
Furtermore, the bonfire will
cost $1,000. I realize that the
term "money to burn," does
exist, but why do the students
have to implement it? Surely, the
University could find several
organizations or community
projects that would accept the
money. It's ironic that Stanford,
which is suffering from a definite
financial crisis, chooses to be so
frivolous with its funds.
If Palo Alto High School
students are willing to forego their
annual football bonfire, then it
behooves us to do the same.
If eliminating the bonfire is
beyond our capacities; then what
happens when we are faced by a
situation that requires a major
sacrifice?
I hope that the students,
Administration, and community
collectively decide not to
perpetuate hypocrisy. Why don't
we replace tradition with
rationality? Isn't it about time?

Recruitment Reconsideration
Editor, THE DAILY:
After having read several letters
in the Daily which pointed out
the misuses of the Nuremberg
Principles as a defense for
Professor Franklin's actions of last
spring, I was somewhat surprised
to find an article in the November
sth issue in which Larry Diamond
used them in a similar manner to
justify the barring of industries
with defense contracts from
campus recruitment.
He states, "The United States
is guilty of crimes against peace
and of war crimes in Southeast
Asia," actions which violate the
Nuremberg Principles.
Such a statement is a personal
opinion which has been upheld in
no court, and as such, reminds me
of the days of lynching and mob
justice in our country. It directly
contradicts the spirit of both of
our judicial system and the
Nuremberg Principles, which
presume a man or a country
innocent until proven guilty.
But beyond this
misinterpretation of the
Nurembujt Principles lies the
broader issue of whether this or

any student body has the right to
enforce such a referendum. It is
questionable in my mind as to
whether the presence of recruiters
from any industry affects anyone
on campus other than those who
desire an interview.
As a student who will not be a
member of this community for
more than seven years, I do not
feel that I have the right to
abrogate the privileges of a
minority on campus for many
years to come by a referendum
passed as the result of a
temporary political crisis.
For me, the issues of
constitutionality and equal
opportunity of employment have
a great bearing on this question,
enough to cast doubt on the right
of students to enforce this kind of
proposal on their fellow members.
What is ?most amusing to me is
that this piece of legislation,
which basically makes a moral
judgment for everyone concerning
one's involvement in propagating
a war, however indirect, spring
from the same mouths which
oppose such laws as those dealing
with marijuana, premarital sex,
and abortion because they force
the same moral standard on
everyone. This seems to me a
most nearsighted and hypocritical
stance.
In light of these and other
arguments, the issue of campus
recruitment bears careful and
rational reconsideration on the
part of the student body.

Conclusion
Editor, THE DAILY:
The exciting Red's Hot
Professor Contest will reach a
climactic conclusion at the awards
presentation scheduled for noon
today directly in front of the
placement center. At this moment
the results of the contest are being
finalized and "suitable" awards are
being chosen. The winners are
invited of course, but if any are
unable to attend, their awards will
be delivered to their office or lab
as a part of the ceremony.
We invite everyone in the
Stanford community to witness
this exciting and informative
presentation.

era, such as the Palmer Raids. It
can happen again.
Let me add that I feel a deep
empathy for Dr. Franklin because
of his early involvement against
the war long before the rest of the

action.

I urge your committee to
carefully consider the long-term
consequences of your decision not
only for the Franklin family but
for all the people of this country.

Mr. Lenny Siegel,
c/o Editor, THE DAILY:
Dear Mr. Siegel,
Your recent letter to President
Lyman published in Wednesday's
Daily reminded me of a concern I
have long held.
As you know, I have followed
your career at Stanford with great
interest, including your long range
plans for the School of
Engineering. Being this well
informed of your talents and
aims, I have been naturally greatly
worried by your candidacy for
Dean of Engineering. Should you
be selected, the Pacific Studies
Center will have suffered a blow
which not even Joel Yudken can
repair.
Therefore, in consideration of
the sacrifice you have offered to

make, I want you to know that I
offer my services as Director of
PSC should Stanford make you
Dean of Engineering. My
qualifications for this office are
public knowledge. My first act on
assuming duty as Director will be
to institute a strict publish or
perish policy: failure to publish at
least one article per quarter in a
computer journal of my choosing
will be considered grounds for
dismissal.
Lots of luck,
Gene F. Franklin,
Professor of Electrical Engineering,
Associate Provost for Computing
Ticket Prices Outrageous
Editor, THE DAILY:
It appears that the only group
of persons not protected by
President Nixon's wage and price
freeze are students. First, we all
found that tuition had increased
by not inconsiderable
amounts—this, or course, was
specifically exempted from the
freeze. A little later, when we
went round to renew our
students' supplemental health
insurance with Blue Cross, we
found that the premiums had

been raised by approximately 50%
from the previous quarter. This
increase was not explained or even
referred to by Blue Cross, and
very cleverly was not dated (that
presumably fooled us all into
believing that the not - discussed -
therefore - non - existent increase
in premium was effected before
the price freeze went into effect).
Now, students are being asked
to pay an amount of $8 or $10
for a Rose Bowl ticket, increases
of 100% or 125% over the price
paid last year. Unless it is believed
by the Rose Bowl Committee that
the game will provide twice as
much pleasure (perhaps it will last
120 minutes), I cannot see any
justification for this increase.
School football exists for the
enjoyment of students as well as
for the treasury of schools in the
PAC-8, or so I would have
innocently thought. Now, to be
fair to the Administration of
Stanford University and to the
Athletics Department, I
understand that the proposed
student ticket price emanated
from a Committee representing
the two conferences. But, I would
ask both the Administration and
the Athletics Department to put

whatever pressure they can on the
Committee BEFORE IT IS TOO
LATE.
For $10, I can buy a lot of
beer, and enjoy the spectacle on
TV; in doing so, I will also save
the fare down to LA and will
deprive the Committee of at least
one check (presumably one of
many) for $10.

Dear Prof. Cohn
Editor, THE DAILY:
I am writing in reference to
Prof. Robert Cohn's article of
Nov. 10 and 11, "The Crisis of
Sexual Identity." Aside from the
purely sexist aspects of the article
— (which I found too many and
too revolting to want to even
begin to go into), it has been a
long time since I've read such
circumloquacious, pompous and
meaningless drivel.
In addition to the rampant
name-dropping, the melange (or
better, hodge-podge) of odds and
ends of Sartre, Buber, Eastern
Mysticism, shreds of traditional
philosophy — mostly out of
context — plus a fable for good
measure, left me breathless.
Prof. Cohn has not proved his
point (if there was a point); he has
merely confirmed my opinion
that just because a person has a
Ph.D. there is no guarantee that
he has grown beyond
pseudo-intellectualism and just
plain fatuousness.
I suggest that Prof. Cohn read
The Feminine Mystique — or have
his wife read it to him. He might
learn something from it — both as
to the actual problems of women
today, and as to proper methods
of researching one's topics before
spewing them on paper.

Editor, THE DAILY:
I would like to commend
Messieurs Barnum and Sayre for
the excellent letters concerning
the big game bonfire. Their
castigation of the event was both
articulate and cogent.
The bonfire is a prime example
of "liberal" rhetoric, where the
supposedly sincere words are
betrayed by the subsequent

actions. This community is known
for its ecological sensitivity, yet it
condones an activity that
produces approximately 4.37 tons
of air contaminant emissions.
Furtermore, the bonfire will
cost $1,000. I realize that the
term "money to burn," does
exist, but why do the students
have to implement it? Surely, the
University could find several
organizations or community
projects that would accept the
money. It's ironic that Stanford,
which is suffering from a definite
financial crisis, chooses to be so
frivolous with its funds.
If Palo Alto High School
students are willing to forego their
annual football bonfire, then it
behooves us to do the same.
If eliminating the bonfire is
beyond our capacities; then what
happens when we are faced by a
situation that requires a major
sacrifice?
I hope that the students,
Administration, and community
collectively decide not to
perpetuate hypocrisy. Why don't
we replace tradition with
rationality? Isn't it about time?

Recruitment Reconsideration
Editor, THE DAILY:
After having read several letters
in the Daily which pointed out
the misuses of the Nuremberg
Principles as a defense for
Professor Franklin's actions of last
spring, I was somewhat surprised
to find an article in the November
sth issue in which Larry Diamond
used them in a similar manner to
justify the barring of industries
with defense contracts from
campus recruitment.
He states, "The United States
is guilty of crimes against peace
and of war crimes in Southeast
Asia," actions which violate the
Nuremberg Principles.
Such a statement is a personal
opinion which has been upheld in
no court, and as such, reminds me
of the days of lynching and mob
justice in our country. It directly
contradicts the spirit of both of
our judicial system and the
Nuremberg Principles, which
presume a man or a country
innocent until proven guilty.
But beyond this
misinterpretation of the
Nurembujt Principles lies the
broader issue of whether this or

any student body has the right to
enforce such a referendum. It is
questionable in my mind as to
whether the presence of recruiters
from any industry affects anyone
on campus other than those who
desire an interview.
As a student who will not be a
member of this community for
more than seven years, I do not
feel that I have the right to
abrogate the privileges of a
minority on campus for many
years to come by a referendum
passed as the result of a
temporary political crisis.
For me, the issues of
constitutionality and equal
opportunity of employment have
a great bearing on this question,
enough to cast doubt on the right
of students to enforce this kind of
proposal on their fellow members.
What is ?most amusing to me is
that this piece of legislation,
which basically makes a moral
judgment for everyone concerning
one's involvement in propagating
a war, however indirect, spring
from the same mouths which
oppose such laws as those dealing
with marijuana, premarital sex,
and abortion because they force
the same moral standard on
everyone. This seems to me a
most nearsighted and hypocritical
stance.
In light of these and other
arguments, the issue of campus
recruitment bears careful and
rational reconsideration on the
part of the student body.

A Return to McCarthyism?
Chairman of Advisory Board: Dr.
Kennedy,
May I respectfully remind your
committee that any
recommendation to fire Dr.
Franklin is equivalent to
recommending a long term prison
sentence.
I am very deeply concerned
because I vividly remember The
McCarthy period. Many men and
women, some as well known as
"The Hollywood Ten", Philip
Oppenheimer, and literally
thousands of other lesser known
people listed in "The Little Red
Book" lost their jobs, some never
knowing why.
Many were unable to secure
jobs for many years in their own
field or for that matter in other
fields. Many, some of whom I
knew, suffered economically as
well as psychologically and never
recovered. Their wives and
children also suffered untold
hardships. No criminal could
suffer more.
I am fearful because I sense a
pattern developing. We must be
sensitive and alert to prevent it. It
happened before The McCarthy
era, such as the Palmer Raids. It
can happen again.
Let me add that I feel a deep
empathy for Dr. Franklin because
of his early involvement against
the war long before the rest of the
community was willing to take

which not even Joel Yudken can
repair.
Therefore, in consideration of
the sacrifice you have offered to

make, I want you to know that I
offer my services as Director of
PSC should Stanford make you
Dean of Engineering. My
qualifications for this office are
public knowledge. My first act on

to institute a strict publish or

Ticket Prices Outrageous
Editor, THE DAILY:
It appears that the only group
of persons not protected by
President Nixon's wage and price
freeze are students. First, we all
found that tuition had increased
by not inconsiderable
amounts—this, or course, was
specifically exempted from the
freeze. A little later, when we
went round to renew our
students' supplemental health
insurance with Blue Cross, we
found that the premiums had

been raised by approximately 50%
from the previous quarter. This
increase was not explained or even
referred to by Blue Cross, and
very cleverly was not dated (that
presumably fooled us all into
believing that the not - discussed -
therefore - non - existent increase
in premium was effected before
the price freeze went into effect).
Now, students are being asked
to pay an amount of $8 or $10
for a Rose Bowl ticket, increases
of 100% or 125% over the price
paid last year. Unless it is believed
by the Rose Bowl Committee that
the game will provide twice as
much pleasure (perhaps it will last
120 minutes), I cannot see any
justification for this increase.
School football exists for the
enjoyment of students as well as
for the treasury of schools in the
PAC-8, or so I would have
innocently thought. Now, to be
fair to the Administration of
Stanford University and to the
Athletics Department, I
understand that the proposed
student ticket price emanated
from a Committee representing
the two conferences. But, I would
ask both the Administration and
the Athletics Department to put

whatever pressure they can on the
Committee BEFORE IT IS TOO
LATE.
For $10, I can buy a lot of
beer, and enjoy the spectacle on
TV; in doing so, I will also save
the fare down to LA and will
deprive the Committee of at least
one check (presumably one of
many) for $10.

Dear Prof. Cohn
Editor, THE DAILY:
I am writing in reference to
Prof. Robert Cohn's article of
Nov. 10 and 11, "The Crisis of
Sexual Identity." Aside from the
purely sexist aspects of the article
— (which I found too many and
too revolting to want to even
begin to go into), it has been a
long time since I've read such
circumloquacious, pompous and
meaningless drivel.
In addition to the rampant
name-dropping, the melange (or
better, hodge-podge) of odds and
ends of Sartre, Buber, Eastern
Mysticism, shreds of traditional
philosophy — mostly out of
context — plus a fable for good
measure, left me breathless.
Prof. Cohn has not proved his
point (if there was a point); he has
merely confirmed my opinion
that just because a person has a
Ph.D. there is no guarantee that
he has grown beyond
pseudo-intellectualism and just
plain fatuousness.
I suggest that Prof. Cohn read
The Feminine Mystique — or have
his wife read it to him. He might
learn something from it — both as
to the actual problems of women
today, and as to proper methods
of researching one's topics before
spewing them on paper.

I would like to commend
Messieurs Barnum and Sayre for
the excellent letters concerning
the big game bonfire. Their
castigation of the event was both
articulate and cogent.
The bonfire is a prime example
of "liberal" rhetoric, where the
supposedly sincere words are
betrayed by the subsequent

actions. This community is known
for its ecological sensitivity, yet it
condones an activity that
produces approximately 4.37 tons
of air contaminant emissions.
Furtermore, the bonfire will
cost $1,000. I realize that the
term "money to burn," does
exist, but why do the students
have to implement it? Surely, the
University could find several
organizations or community
projects that would accept the
money. It's ironic that Stanford,
which is suffering from a definite
financial crisis, chooses to be so
frivolous with its funds.
If Palo Alto High School
students are willing to forego their
annual football bonfire, then it
behooves us to do the same.
If eliminating the bonfire is
beyond our capacities; then what
happens when we are faced by a
situation that requires a major
sacrifice?
I hope that the students,
Administration, and community
collectively decide not to
perpetuate hypocrisy. Why don't
we replace tradition with
rationality? Isn't it about time?

Recruitment Reconsideration
Editor, THE DAILY:
After having read several letters
in the Daily which pointed out
the misuses of the Nuremberg
Principles as a defense for
Professor Franklin's actions of last
spring, I was somewhat surprised
to find an article in the November
sth issue in which Larry Diamond
used them in a similar manner to
justify the barring of industries
with defense contracts from
campus recruitment.
He states, "The United States
is guilty of crimes against peace
and of war crimes in Southeast
Asia," actions which violate the
Nuremberg Principles.
Such a statement is a personal
opinion which has been upheld in
no court, and as such, reminds me
of the days of lynching and mob
justice in our country. It directly
contradicts the spirit of both of
our judicial system and the
Nuremberg Principles, which
presume a man or a country
innocent until proven guilty.
But beyond this
misinterpretation of the
Nurembujt Principles lies the
broader issue of whether this or

any student body has the right to
enforce such a referendum. It is
questionable in my mind as to
whether the presence of recruiters
from any industry affects anyone
on campus other than those who
desire an interview.
As a student who will not be a
member of this community for
more than seven years, I do not
feel that I have the right to
abrogate the privileges of a
minority on campus for many
years to come by a referendum
passed as the result of a
temporary political crisis.
For me, the issues of
constitutionality and equal
opportunity of employment have
a great bearing on this question,
enough to cast doubt on the right
of students to enforce this kind of
proposal on their fellow members.
What is ?most amusing to me is
that this piece of legislation,
which basically makes a moral
judgment for everyone concerning
one's involvement in propagating
a war, however indirect, spring
from the same mouths which
oppose such laws as those dealing
with marijuana, premarital sex,
and abortion because they force
the same moral standard on
everyone. This seems to me a
most nearsighted and hypocritical
stance.
In light of these and other
arguments, the issue of campus
recruitment bears careful and
rational reconsideration on the
part of the student body.

A Return to McCarthyism?
Chairman of Advisory Board: Dr.
Kennedy,
May I respectfully remind your
committee that any
recommendation to fire Dr.
Franklin is equivalent to
recommending a long term prison
sentence.
I am very deeply concerned
because I vividly remember The
McCarthy period. Many men and
women, some as well known as
"The Hollywood Ten", Philip
Oppenheimer, and literally
thousands of other lesser known
people listed in "The Little Red
Book" lost their jobs, some never
knowing why.
Many were unable to secure
jobs for many years in their own
field or for that matter in other
fields. Many, some of whom I
knew, suffered economically as
well as psychologically and never
recovered. Their wives and
children also suffered untold
hardships. No criminal could
suffer more.
I am fearful because I sense a
pattern developing. We must be
sensitive and alert to prevent it. It
happened before The McCarthy
era, such as the Palmer Raids. It
can happen again.
Let me add that I feel a deep
empathy for Dr. Franklin because
of his early involvement against
the war long before the rest of the
community was willing to take
action.

I urge your committee to
carefully consider the long-term
consequences of your decision not
only for the Franklin family but
for all the people of this country.

freeze. A little later, when we
went round to renew our
students' supplemental health
insurance with Blue Cross, we
found that the premiums had

been raised by approximately 50%
from the previous quarter. This
increase was not explained or even
referred to by Blue Cross, and
very cleverly was not dated (that
presumably fooled us all into
believing that the not - discussed -
therefore - non - existent increase
in premium was effected before
the price freeze went into effect).
Now, students are being asked
to pay an amount of $8 or $10
for a Rose Bowl ticket, increases
of 100% or 125% over the price
paid last year. Unless it is believed
by the Rose Bowl Committee that
the game will provide twice as
much pleasure (perhaps it will last
120 minutes), I cannot see any
justification for this increase.
School football exists for the
enjoyment of students as well as
for the treasury of schools in the
PAC-8, or so I would have
innocently thought. Now, to be
fair to the Administration of
Stanford University and to the
Athletics Department, I
understand that the proposed
student ticket price emanated
from a Committee representing
the two conferences. But, I would
ask both the Administration and
the Athletics Department to put

whatever pressure they can on the
Committee BEFORE IT IS TOO
LATE.
For $10, I can buy a lot of
beer, and enjoy the spectacle on
TV; in doing so, I will also save
the fare down to LA and will
deprive the Committee of at least
one check (presumably one of
many) for $10.

Dear Prof. Cohn
Editor, THE DAILY:
I am writing in reference to
Prof. Robert Cohn's article of
Nov. 10 and 11, "The Crisis of
Sexual Identity." Aside from the
purely sexist aspects of the article
— (which I found too many and
too revolting to want to even
begin to go into), it has been a
long time since I've read such
circumloquacious, pompous and
meaningless drivel.
In addition to the rampant
name-dropping, the melange (or
better, hodge-podge) of odds and
ends of Sartre, Buber, Eastern
Mysticism, shreds of traditional
philosophy — mostly out of
context — plus a fable for good
measure, left me breathless.
Prof. Cohn has not proved his
point (if there was a point); he has
merely confirmed my opinion
that just because a person has a
Ph.D. there is no guarantee that
he has grown beyond
pseudo-intellectualism and just
plain fatuousness.
I suggest that Prof. Cohn read
The Feminine Mystique — or have
his wife read it to him. He might
learn something from it — both as
to the actual problems of women
today, and as to proper methods
of researching one's topics before
spewing them on paper.

I would like to commend
Messieurs Barnum and Sayre for
the excellent letters concerning
the big game bonfire. Their
castigation of the event was both
articulate and cogent.
The bonfire is a prime example
of "liberal" rhetoric, where the
supposedly sincere words are
betrayed by the subsequent

actions. This community is known
for its ecological sensitivity, yet it
condones an activity that
produces approximately 4.37 tons
of air contaminant emissions.
Furtermore, the bonfire will
cost $1,000. I realize that the
term "money to burn," does
exist, but why do the students
have to implement it? Surely, the
University could find several
organizations or community
projects that would accept the
money. It's ironic that Stanford,
which is suffering from a definite
financial crisis, chooses to be so
frivolous with its funds.
If Palo Alto High School
students are willing to forego their
annual football bonfire, then it
behooves us to do the same.
If eliminating the bonfire is
beyond our capacities; then what
happens when we are faced by a
situation that requires a major
sacrifice?
I hope that the students,
Administration, and community
collectively decide not to
perpetuate hypocrisy. Why don't
we replace tradition with
rationality? Isn't it about time?

Recruitment Reconsideration
Editor, THE DAILY:
After having read several letters
in the Daily which pointed out
the misuses of the Nuremberg
Principles as a defense for
Professor Franklin's actions of last
spring, I was somewhat surprised
to find an article in the November
sth issue in which Larry Diamond
used them in a similar manner to
justify the barring of industries
with defense contracts from
campus recruitment.
He states, "The United States
is guilty of crimes against peace
and of war crimes in Southeast
Asia," actions which violate the
Nuremberg Principles.
Such a statement is a personal
opinion which has been upheld in
no court, and as such, reminds me
of the days of lynching and mob
justice in our country. It directly
contradicts the spirit of both of
our judicial system and the
Nuremberg Principles, which
presume a man or a country
innocent until proven guilty.
But beyond this
misinterpretation of the
Nurembujt Principles lies the
broader issue of whether this or

any student body has the right to
enforce such a referendum. It is
questionable in my mind as to
whether the presence of recruiters
from any industry affects anyone
on campus other than those who
desire an interview.
As a student who will not be a
member of this community for
more than seven years, I do not
feel that I have the right to
abrogate the privileges of a
minority on campus for many
years to come by a referendum
passed as the result of a
temporary political crisis.
For me, the issues of
constitutionality and equal
opportunity of employment have
a great bearing on this question,
enough to cast doubt on the right
of students to enforce this kind of
proposal on their fellow members.
What is ?most amusing to me is
that this piece of legislation,
which basically makes a moral
judgment for everyone concerning
one's involvement in propagating
a war, however indirect, spring
from the same mouths which
oppose such laws as those dealing
with marijuana, premarital sex,
and abortion because they force
the same moral standard on
everyone. This seems to me a
most nearsighted and hypocritical
stance.
In light of these and other
arguments, the issue of campus
recruitment bears careful and
rational reconsideration on the
part of the student body.

A Return to McCarthyism?
Chairman of Advisory Board: Dr.
Kennedy,
May I respectfully remind your
committee that any
recommendation to fire Dr.
Franklin is equivalent to
recommending a long term prison
sentence.
I am very deeply concerned
because I vividly remember The
McCarthy period. Many men and
women, some as well known as
"The Hollywood Ten", Philip
Oppenheimer, and literally
thousands of other lesser known
people listed in "The Little Red
Book" lost their jobs, some never
knowing why.
Many were unable to secure
jobs for many years in their own
field or for that matter in other
fields. Many, some of whom I
knew, suffered economically as
well as psychologically and never
recovered. Their wives and
children also suffered untold
hardships. No criminal could
suffer more.
I am fearful because I sense a
pattern developing. We must be
sensitive and alert to prevent it. It
happened before The McCarthy
era, such as the Palmer Raids. It
can happen again.
Let me add that I feel a deep
empathy for Dr. Franklin because
of his early involvement against
the war long before the rest of the
community was willing to take
action.

I urge your committee to
carefully consider the long-term
consequences of your decision not
only for the Franklin family but
for all the people of this country.

Mr. Lenny Siegel,
c/o Editor, THE DAILY:
Dear Mr. Siegel,
Your recent letter to President
Lyman published in Wednesday's
Daily reminded me of a concern I
have long held.
As you know, I have followed
your career at Stanford with great
interest, including your long range
plans for the School of
Engineering. Being this well
informed of your talents and
aims, I have been naturally greatly
worried by your candidacy for
Dean of Engineering. Should you
be selected, the Pacific Studies
Center will have suffered a blow
which not even Joel Yudken can
repair.
Therefore, in consideration of
the sacrifice you have offered to

make, I want you to know that I
offer my services as Director of
PSC should Stanford make you
Dean of Engineering. My
qualifications for this office are
public knowledge. My first act on
assuming duty as Director will be
to institute a strict publish or
perish policy: failure to publish at
least one article per quarter in a
computer journal of my choosing
will be considered grounds for
dismissal.
Lots of luck,
Gene F. Franklin,

Ticket Prices Outrageous

PAC-8, or so I would have
innocently thought. Now, to be
fair to the Administration of
Stanford University and to the
Athletics Department, I
understand that the proposed
student ticket price emanated
from a Committee representing
the two conferences. But, I would
ask both the Administration and
the Athletics Department to put

whatever pressure they can on the
Committee BEFORE IT IS TOO
LATE.
For $10, I can buy a lot of
beer, and enjoy the spectacle on
TV; in doing so, I will also save
the fare down to LA and will
deprive the Committee of at least
one check (presumably one of
many) for $10.

Dear Prof. Cohn
Editor, THE DAILY:
I am writing in reference to
Prof. Robert Cohn's article of
Nov. 10 and 11, "The Crisis of
Sexual Identity." Aside from the
purely sexist aspects of the article
— (which I found too many and
too revolting to want to even
begin to go into), it has been a
long time since I've read such
circumloquacious, pompous and
meaningless drivel.
In addition to the rampant
name-dropping, the melange (or
better, hodge-podge) of odds and
ends of Sartre, Buber, Eastern
Mysticism, shreds of traditional
philosophy — mostly out of
context — plus a fable for good
measure, left me breathless.
Prof. Cohn has not proved his
point (if there was a point); he has
merely confirmed my opinion
that just because a person has a
Ph.D. there is no guarantee that
he has grown beyond
pseudo-intellectualism and just
plain fatuousness.
I suggest that Prof. Cohn read
The Feminine Mystique — or have
his wife read it to him. He might
learn something from it — both as
to the actual problems of women
today, and as to proper methods
of researching one's topics before
spewing them on paper.

More Bonfire Fire
Editor, THE DAILY:
I would like to commend
Messieurs Barnum and Sayre for
the excellent letters concerning
the big game bonfire. Their
castigation of the event was both
articulate and cogent.
The bonfire is a prime example
of "liberal" rhetoric, where the
supposedly sincere words are
betrayed by the subsequent

actions. This community is known
for its ecological sensitivity, yet it
condones an activity that
produces approximately 4.37 tons
of air contaminant emissions.
Furtermore, the bonfire will
cost $1,000. I realize that the
term "money to burn," does
exist, but why do the students
have to implement it? Surely, the
University could find several
organizations or community
projects that would accept the
money. It's ironic that Stanford,
which is suffering from a definite
financial crisis, chooses to be so
frivolous with its funds.
If Palo Alto High School
students are willing to forego their
annual football bonfire, then it
behooves us to do the same.
If eliminating the bonfire is
beyond our capacities; then what
happens when we are faced by a
situation that requires a major
sacrifice?
I hope that the students,
Administration, and community
collectively decide not to
perpetuate hypocrisy. Why don't
we replace tradition with
rationality? Isn't it about time?

Recruitment Reconsideration
Editor, THE DAILY:
After having read several letters
in the Daily which pointed out
the misuses of the Nuremberg
Principles as a defense for
Professor Franklin's actions of last
spring, I was somewhat surprised
to find an article in the November
sth issue in which Larry Diamond
used them in a similar manner to
justify the barring of industries
with defense contracts from
campus recruitment.
He states, "The United States
is guilty of crimes against peace
and of war crimes in Southeast
Asia," actions which violate the
Nuremberg Principles.
Such a statement is a personal
opinion which has been upheld in
no court, and as such, reminds me
of the days of lynching and mob
justice in our country. It directly
contradicts the spirit of both of
our judicial system and the
Nuremberg Principles, which
presume a man or a country
innocent until proven guilty.
But beyond this
misinterpretation of the
Nurembujt Principles lies the
broader issue of whether this or

any student body has the right to
enforce such a referendum. It is
questionable in my mind as to
whether the presence of recruiters
from any industry affects anyone
on campus other than those who
desire an interview.
As a student who will not be a
member of this community for
more than seven years, I do not
feel that I have the right to
abrogate the privileges of a
minority on campus for many
years to come by a referendum
passed as the result of a
temporary political crisis.
For me, the issues of
constitutionality and equal
opportunity of employment have
a great bearing on this question,
enough to cast doubt on the right
of students to enforce this kind of
proposal on their fellow members.
What is ?most amusing to me is
that this piece of legislation,
which basically makes a moral
judgment for everyone concerning
one's involvement in propagating
a war, however indirect, spring
from the same mouths which
oppose such laws as those dealing
with marijuana, premarital sex,
and abortion because they force
the same moral standard on
everyone. This seems to me a
most nearsighted and hypocritical
stance.
In light of these and other
arguments, the issue of campus
recruitment bears careful and
rational reconsideration on the
part of the student body.

Conclusion
Editor, THE DAILY:
The exciting Red's Hot
Professor Contest will reach a
climactic conclusion at the awards
presentation scheduled for noon
today directly in front of the
placement center. At this moment
the results of the contest are being
finalized and "suitable" awards are
being chosen. The winners are
invited of course, but if any are
unable to attend, their awards will
be delivered to their office or lab
as a part of the ceremony.
We invite everyone in the
Stanford community to witness
this exciting and informative
presentation.

A Return to McCarthyism?
Chairman of Advisory Board: Dr.
Kennedy,
May I respectfully remind your
committee that any
recommendation to fire Dr.
Franklin is equivalent to
recommending a long term prison
sentence.
I am very deeply concerned
because I vividly remember The
McCarthy period. Many men and
women, some as well known as
"The Hollywood Ten", Philip
Oppenheimer, and literally
thousands of other lesser known
people listed in "The Little Red
Book" lost their jobs, some never
knowing why.
Many were unable to secure
jobs for many years in their own
field or for that matter in other
fields. Many, some of whom I
knew, suffered economically as
well as psychologically and never
recovered. Their wives and
children also suffered untold
hardships. No criminal could
suffer more.
I am fearful because I sense a
pattern developing. We must be
sensitive and alert to prevent it. It
happened before The McCarthy
era, such as the Palmer Raids. It
can happen again.
Let me add that I feel a deep
empathy for Dr. Franklin because
of his early involvement against
the war long before the rest of the
community was willing to take
action.

I urge your committee to
carefully consider the long-term
consequences of your decision not
only for the Franklin family but
for all the people of this country.

Publish or Perish Platform
Mr. Lenny Siegel,
c/o Editor, THE DAILY:
Dear Mr. Siegel,
Your recent letter to President
Lyman published in Wednesday's
Daily reminded me of a concern I
have long held.
As you know, I have followed
your career at Stanford with great
interest, including your long range
plans for the School of
Engineering. Being this well
informed of your talents and
aims, I have been naturally greatly
worried by your candidacy for
Dean of Engineering. Should you
be selected, the Pacific Studies
Center will have suffered a blow
which not even Joel Yudken can
repair.
Therefore, in consideration of
the sacrifice you have offered to

make, I want you to know that I
offer my services as Director of
PSC should Stanford make you
Dean of Engineering. My
qualifications for this office are
public knowledge. My first act on
assuming duty as Director will be
to institute a strict publish or
perish policy: failure to publish at
least one article per quarter in a
computer journal of my choosing
will be considered grounds for
dismissal.
Lots of luck,
Gene F. Franklin,
Professor of Electrical Engineering,
Associate Provost for Computing
Ticket Prices Outrageous
Editor, THE DAILY:
It appears that the only group
of persons not protected by
President Nixon's wage and price
freeze are students. First, we all
found that tuition had increased
by not inconsiderable
amounts—this, or course, was
specifically exempted from the
freeze. A little later, when we
went round to renew our
students' supplemental health
insurance with Blue Cross, we
found that the premiums had

been raised by approximately 50%
from the previous quarter. This
increase was not explained or even
referred to by Blue Cross, and
very cleverly was not dated (that
presumably fooled us all into
believing that the not - discussed -
therefore - non - existent increase
in premium was effected before
the price freeze went into effect).
Now, students are being asked
to pay an amount of $8 or $10
for a Rose Bowl ticket, increases
of 100% or 125% over the price
paid last year. Unless it is believed
by the Rose Bowl Committee that
the game will provide twice as
much pleasure (perhaps it will last
120 minutes), I cannot see any
justification for this increase.
School football exists for the
enjoyment of students as well as
for the treasury of schools in the
PAC-8, or so I would have
innocently thought. Now, to be
fair to the Administration of
Stanford University and to the
Athletics Department, I
understand that the proposed
student ticket price emanated
from a Committee representing
the two conferences. But, I would
ask both the Administration and
the Athletics Department to put

whatever pressure they can on the
Committee BEFORE IT IS TOO
LATE.
For $10, I can buy a lot of
beer, and enjoy the spectacle on

the fare down to LA and will
