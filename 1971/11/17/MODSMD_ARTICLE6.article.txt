# Reply To President Lyman
## 
### 
When Richard Lyman made his
remarks to the faculty Senate last
week I responded to those
remarks on the floor of the
Senate. Unfortunately the budget
of the ASSU Council of Presidents
is not so large as the one allocated
to "University Relations" and so
my remarks were not reprinted as

affect.
This year the Council of
Presidents attempted to institute a
program under which the records
of Committee deliberations would
be made readily available to the
general public. We were faced
with all sorts of faculty and
administration objections that

consumption of the general
public.
I do not feel that Mr. Lymans
speech as transcribed for the Daily
should go unchallenged. For that
matter, I question the use of
University Funds for this kind of
"selling of the Building 10"
approach.
President Lyman focuses his
arguements on two premises:
governance through referendum is
unacceptable, and the University
should be as little involved in
legislating morality as possible.
The first question I would tend to
agree with him on.
Governance by referenda is not
a very acceptable means for
deciding the policies of this
University, particularly because
ASSU has had difficulty in getting
satisfactory election processes and
voter turnout.
However, I also question the
philosophy of governance by
committee. Too often at Stanford
Committee deliberations are
cloistered from the scrutiny of
those whom those decisions will

confidentiality is necessary for
free and unincumbered committee
discussion.
The students did not ask that
the Placement matter be
committeed in COSS, it was done
without the knowledge of most of
the students, and undoubtedly the
results of their deliberations will
be presented with the same lack
of community participation in
formulation. This is also
unacceptable as a means of
governance. It is to me more
unacceptable than governance by
referendum.
What, then, would be an
acceptable means to govern
Stanford University by? My
feeling is that the only truly
representative government of
Stanford University as a unit is an
unincorporated area would be
through a more equalized
tri-cameral legislative system.
Ideally, the Student Senate and
the Faculty Senate and a
formalized Staff Senate would
deal with general policy decisions.
In this way the University
could function more

representatively and the
committee system would be less
ominously closed. A more
equitable means would be
incorporation of Stanford as a
town, but the feasability of this
has yet to be thoroughly
investigated.
I am less in agreement with
President Lyman's second
argument. The University is
perfectly willing to make moral
decisions for Students in regards
to conduct. The University Policy
on Disruptions is not a legally
binding rule, it is rather a rule
formulated by Stanford and
constitutes a moral choice.
However, when Students ask
the University to aid them in
making a statement that military
recruiters are not welcome at
Stanford the University is
suddenly unwilling to have
anything to do with our moral
choices. The students did not ask
for a committee of Young Crows,
or even an all student committee
to make these decisions. They
asked for a tripartide Committee
to deliberate on the matters which
have now, and I believe,
inappropriately, gone to COSS.
Finally, I would like to defend
the ASSU against the charge of
lack of cooperation in student
appointments. At this time last
year there were many, many more
vacant seats than there are now.
We have made a tremendous
effort to put students on
committees. In the case of COSS
we were faced with a choice,
either to put two unqualified
students on last spring, or wait
and fill the vacancies in the fall.
Either way we stood to catch
grief. We decided to hold the
places open until the Fall and give
new students the chance to apply.
It should also be kept in mind

when considering the process of
student appointments to
Committees that the ASSU does
not have a full time Academic
Secretary to do its work for it,
nor does it have a Senate which
meets year round as the faculty
does.
Also, we cannot put the same
people in all the spots every year
as the Administration can. It is
more difficult for Student
government to place their people,
and Diane and I and the rest of
the Committee on Nominations
spend a tremendous amount of
time overcoming this situation.
The students are now on COSS
(the nominations were placed
before the new Student Senate at
their first meeting), so that in
reality Mr. Lyman's comments on
this matter are of little relevance.

student appointments to
Committees that the ASSU does
not have a full time Academic
Secretary to do its work for it,
nor does it have a Senate which
meets year round as the faculty
does.
Also, we cannot put the same
people in all the spots every year
as the Administration can. It is
more difficult for Student
government to place their people,
and Diane and I and the rest of
the Committee on Nominations
spend a tremendous amount of
time overcoming this situation.
The students are now on COSS
(the nominations were placed
before the new Student Senate at
their first meeting), so that in
reality Mr. Lyman's comments on
this matter are of little relevance.
(Ann Kimball is a member of the
ASSU Council of Presidents.)
When Richard Lyman made his
remarks to the faculty Senate last
week I responded to those
remarks on the floor of the
Senate. Unfortunately the budget
of the ASSU Council of Presidents
is not so large as the one allocated
to "University Relations" and so
my remarks were not reprinted as

affect.
This year the Council of
Presidents attempted to institute a
program under which the records
of Committee deliberations would
be made readily available to the
general public. We were faced
with all sorts of faculty and
administration objections that

consumption of the general
public.
I do not feel that Mr. Lymans
speech as transcribed for the Daily
should go unchallenged. For that
matter, I question the use of
University Funds for this kind of
"selling of the Building 10"
approach.
President Lyman focuses his
arguements on two premises:
governance through referendum is
unacceptable, and the University
should be as little involved in
legislating morality as possible.
The first question I would tend to
agree with him on.
Governance by referenda is not
a very acceptable means for
deciding the policies of this
University, particularly because
ASSU has had difficulty in getting
satisfactory election processes and
voter turnout.
However, I also question the
philosophy of governance by
committee. Too often at Stanford
Committee deliberations are
cloistered from the scrutiny of
those whom those decisions will

confidentiality is necessary for
free and unincumbered committee
discussion.
The students did not ask that
the Placement matter be
committeed in COSS, it was done
without the knowledge of most of
the students, and undoubtedly the
results of their deliberations will
be presented with the same lack
of community participation in
formulation. This is also
unacceptable as a means of
governance. It is to me more
unacceptable than governance by
referendum.
What, then, would be an
acceptable means to govern
Stanford University by? My
feeling is that the only truly
representative government of
Stanford University as a unit is an
unincorporated area would be
through a more equalized
tri-cameral legislative system.
Ideally, the Student Senate and
the Faculty Senate and a
formalized Staff Senate would
deal with general policy decisions.
In this way the University
could function more

representatively and the
committee system would be less
ominously closed. A more
equitable means would be
incorporation of Stanford as a
town, but the feasability of this
has yet to be thoroughly
investigated.
I am less in agreement with
President Lyman's second
argument. The University is
perfectly willing to make moral
decisions for Students in regards
to conduct. The University Policy
on Disruptions is not a legally
binding rule, it is rather a rule
formulated by Stanford and
constitutes a moral choice.
However, when Students ask
the University to aid them in
making a statement that military
recruiters are not welcome at
Stanford the University is
suddenly unwilling to have
anything to do with our moral
choices. The students did not ask
for a committee of Young Crows,
or even an all student committee
to make these decisions. They
asked for a tripartide Committee
to deliberate on the matters which
have now, and I believe,
inappropriately, gone to COSS.
Finally, I would like to defend
the ASSU against the charge of
lack of cooperation in student
appointments. At this time last
year there were many, many more
vacant seats than there are now.
We have made a tremendous
effort to put students on
committees. In the case of COSS
we were faced with a choice,
either to put two unqualified
students on last spring, or wait
and fill the vacancies in the fall.
Either way we stood to catch
grief. We decided to hold the
places open until the Fall and give
new students the chance to apply.
It should also be kept in mind

asked for a tripartide Committee
to deliberate on the matters which
have now, and I believe,
inappropriately, gone to COSS.
Finally, I would like to defend
the ASSU against the charge of
lack of cooperation in student
appointments. At this time last
year there were many, many more
vacant seats than there are now.
We have made a tremendous
effort to put students on
committees. In the case of COSS
we were faced with a choice,
either to put two unqualified
students on last spring, or wait
and fill the vacancies in the fall.
Either way we stood to catch
grief. We decided to hold the
places open until the Fall and give
new students the chance to apply.
It should also be kept in mind

when considering the process of
student appointments to
Committees that the ASSU does
not have a full time Academic
Secretary to do its work for it,
nor does it have a Senate which
meets year round as the faculty
does.
Also, we cannot put the same
people in all the spots every year
as the Administration can. It is
more difficult for Student
government to place their people,
and Diane and I and the rest of
the Committee on Nominations
spend a tremendous amount of
time overcoming this situation.
The students are now on COSS
(the nominations were placed
before the new Student Senate at
their first meeting), so that in
reality Mr. Lyman's comments on
this matter are of little relevance.
