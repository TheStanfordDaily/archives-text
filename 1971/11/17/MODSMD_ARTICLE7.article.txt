# criteria for the placement center
## Difference Between Guns & Butter 
### 
In last Friday's Daily, Dr. John D. Black
asked, "How does one distinguish between
Honeywell, Hunt Foods, the U.S.O. or the
American Hospital Supply Corp.? Directly or
indirectly, they all contribute to the
maintenance of some aspect of our military
posture."
If it is difficult for Dr. Black to distinguish
between Honeywell and Hunt Foods when it
comes to "our military posture" he is luckier
than the more than 350,000 dead and
wounded Vietnamese children who have
learned, the hard way, the difference between
American weapons and American ketchup.
Milk, tomato sauce, paper and telephone
service can be used by civilians as well as
armies. But products such as M-16's, napalm,
white phosphorous, bombs and other missiles
can be used in only one way—to destroy
human beings, painfully and usually
indiscriminately. It seems to many of us quite
reasonable to ask the University to deny the
use of campus facilities to the manufacturers
of such weapons.
Establishing criteria for determining who
may use the Placement Center is not as
difficult as Dr. Black assumes. Some criteria
already exist. The present policy says that

companies that discriminate against minority
students may not use the Placement Center;
while companies, and organizations, that kill
Asians are welcome.
Those of us who picket are merely asking
that the policy be refined, that it be made
more in keeping with the values most of us
profess to hold. As for the technical
difficulties, if Stanford can determine each
year who, among several thousand high school
seniors, is worthy of enrollment here, surely it
can also determine what companies may use
campus facilities.
Several faculty members who hold DOD
contracts have recently explained at length
that their work has no direct military
application, or if it has, that it is heavily
overbalanced by potential civilian applications.
The unstated assumption clearly seems to be
that purely military research—even if
unclassified—would be considered
unacceptable by the Stanford community.
The same standard could be applied to
those who use the Placement Center.
Manufacturers who make devices that can only
be used to destroy life could, and should, be
declared unwelcome.
Such a declaration by Stanford might bring

rachelle marshall

about a change in production priorities for
some companies, perhaps eventually even a
change of policy in Washington. Contrary to
Dr. Black's fears, however, it seems unlikely
that there would be an immediate dismantling
of our defense establishment.
At present the U.S. is capable of blowing up
every Russian several times over; each of our
nuclear-equipped submarines can release more
explosive power than was used in World Wars I
and II combined. This year's military budget is
$71 billion.
If, and when, it is ever reduced to, say, half
that, and when the nation's resources are going
in greater proportion toward medical care,
housing, restoration of our air and water, then
discussion of Placement Center policies could
always be re-opened.
Meanwhile, it is not enough simply to
oppose the war and the military establishment.
The military establishment and the national
administration have learned that they can live
comfortably with such opposition as long as
the active cooperation of institutions such as
Stanford can be counted on. Only when such
vital cooperation is withdrawn will we see an
end to war and militarism in this country.
