## ‘Problem’ Of Women 
### James Isaak 
The question of an all male
organization becoming co-ed is
non-trivial. The local chapter of Alpha
Phi Omega has been attempting to deal
with this issue for the last two years,
and we are far from becoming co-ed.
Alpha Phi Omega was started as a
service fraternity (i.e., no house) in
1925, and was restricted to ex-Boy
Scouts. The limitation of members to
just Scouts was dropped in the 60's. It
is currently one of the largest fraternal
organizations in the world with nearly
200,000 active or alumni members.
So why is it all male? Certainly
service, such as the book exchange and
bicycle registration, is not a sex
sensitive area; in fact, APO can use all
the people we can get.
With this in mind, Zeta Chapter
(Stanford), along with a few others
suggested a change to make the
fraternity co-ed at the 1970 national
convention. More surprising than the
defeat of the motion, was that it was a
resounding defeat!
Part of the problem was surprise—no
one had ever thought of it before.
Tradition played a role too, although it
had yielded previously on the "Boy
Scout" question. Some felt that women
could not be equals in terms of doing
the kinds of manual labor that APO
sometimes does. Finally, and probably
most significant was the problem of
"Brotherhood".
Brotherhood
Brotherhood is one of the cardinal
principles of Alpha Phi Omega. For
some this means the brotherhood of
mankind, for others it is an exclusively
male to male relationship. Part of this is
the experience the men have with

women.
Many chapters form auxiliaries,
which are essentially made up of girl
friends. This restricts that group, and
may exclude women who are more
interested in the APO service program
than the APO membership. Until the
"sweetheart" image is dropped, women
will not be able to obtain an equal
status.
Stanford's chapter has gotten
through most of this problem, and has
women who are interested in serving
the principles of APO. But one last
cultural barrier remains, the problem of
sharing the full responsibilities and
rights of membership with women. Part
of this is legislative; voting, initiation,
and so forth.
The biggest part is sociological:
being able to overcome the roles of the
"male" and the "female" and to take
on an equal share of the work.
To bring about full co-ed
membership, Alpha Phi Omega will
have to change some deeply ingrained
images. Women must be accepted as
being capable of doing the same work
and taking the same responsibilities as
the men.
The kinds of relationships that men
expect with women have to be
expanded to include a working
comradeship as well as the traditional
sweetheart and "lady-gentleman"
relationships. This won't happen
overnight; rather it will have to be built
up over a period of time. Until men,
both in Alpha phi Omega and out start
accepting this and working towards it,
women are not going to gain any real
equality.

(Stanford), along with a few others
suggested a change to make the
fraternity co-ed at the 1970 national
convention. More surprising than the
defeat of the motion, was that it was a
resounding defeat!
Part of the problem was surprise—no
one had ever thought of it before.
Tradition played a role too, although it
had yielded previously on the "Boy
Scout" question. Some felt that women
could not be equals in terms of doing
the kinds of manual labor that APO
sometimes does. Finally, and probably
most significant was the problem of
"Brotherhood".
Brotherhood
Brotherhood is one of the cardinal
principles of Alpha Phi Omega. For
some this means the brotherhood of
mankind, for others it is an exclusively
male to male relationship. Part of this is
the experience the men have with

women.
Many chapters form auxiliaries,
which are essentially made up of girl
friends. This restricts that group, and
may exclude women who are more
interested in the APO service program
than the APO membership. Until the
"sweetheart" image is dropped, women
will not be able to obtain an equal
status.
Stanford's chapter has gotten
through most of this problem, and has
women who are interested in serving
the principles of APO. But one last
cultural barrier remains, the problem of
sharing the full responsibilities and
rights of membership with women. Part
of this is legislative; voting, initiation,
and so forth.
The biggest part is sociological:
being able to overcome the roles of the
"male" and the "female" and to take
on an equal share of the work.
To bring about full co-ed
membership, Alpha Phi Omega will
have to change some deeply ingrained
images. Women must be accepted as
being capable of doing the same work
and taking the same responsibilities as
the men.
The kinds of relationships that men
expect with women have to be
expanded to include a working
comradeship as well as the traditional
sweetheart and "lady-gentleman"
relationships. This won't happen
overnight; rather it will have to be built
up over a period of time. Until men,
both in Alpha phi Omega and out start
accepting this and working towards it,
women are not going to gain any real
equality.

The question of an all male
organization becoming co-ed is
non-trivial. The local chapter of Alpha
Phi Omega has been attempting to deal
with this issue for the last two years,
and we are far from becoming co-ed.
Alpha Phi Omega was started as a
service fraternity (i.e., no house) in
1925, and was restricted to ex-Boy
Scouts. The limitation of members to
just Scouts was dropped in the 60's. It
is currently one of the largest fraternal
organizations in the world with nearly
200,000 active or alumni members.
So why is it all male? Certainly
service, such as the book exchange and
bicycle registration, is not a sex
sensitive area; in fact, APO can use all
the people we can get.
With this in mind, Zeta Chapter
(Stanford), along with a few others
suggested a change to make the
fraternity co-ed at the 1970 national
convention. More surprising than the
