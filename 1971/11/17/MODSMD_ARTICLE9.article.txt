# Poems To A Friend
## 
### 
The following are poems written to a friend of 6 years standing. They may be
appropriate for your Woman's Page, because I've come to realize that many
women don't experience such a loving and close relationship with someone of
their own sex, and that's a waste. The warmth, openness and support we can share
with each other is a rich human experience none of us should miss.

\ fir,i physical poem
Vou re tiny and soft.
You smell sweet.
I can hold you and love you.
It is very pure.
Is that bisexual?
That isn't even a problem, is it.
All these loving things are
Supposed to be problems,
But they're not.
Ain't it good to know you got a
friend?

Friend
Irregular aura
Field flashing electron disorder
Darkness pierced by white rays.
Neighboring fields change thru light and
warmth.
Delightful image to young friends:
When we're 90 we can compare
boyfriends!
