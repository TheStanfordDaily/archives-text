JEAN RENOIR'S
RULES OF THE GAME
"...Released in Paris in 1939 after being cut by the distributors, cut
again after violent audience reactions, then banned as demoralizing
by the Vichy government and then by the Nazis. The original
negative was destroyed when the Allies bombed the studios at
Boulogne. Reassembled (from two hundred cans of film and bits of
sound track) and restored in the late fifties. Selected in the 1962
international poll of critics as third among the greatest motion
pictures of all time. I set that down only for the record: a numbered
honor is an insult to the greatest living film artist."
