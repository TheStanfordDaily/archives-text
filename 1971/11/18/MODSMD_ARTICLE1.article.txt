# Lincoln's 'Spirit' Roams Old Campus Haunts
## 
### SCOTT THACHER 
Did Abraham Lincoln ever attend Stanford? Although the
University's founding date makes this unlikely, a man claiming
to be "The Spirit Booth's Bullet did not Kill" has been
spooking astonished members of the Stanford community for
the past two days.
The Spirit, standing at least a head shorter than his
namesake when last seen at large in Ford's Theatre, and
doggedly clinging to the same fashions in top hats and beards
popular eleven decades ago, spent six years studying at
Stanford and received a law degree in 1918.

The respect normally given to important-looking alumni
was noticeably lacking yesterday, as he roamed the campus
trying to talk his way into a place in the upcoming Rose Bowl
Parade.
A Stanford employee who spotted the alumnus near the
Medical Center yesterday commented, "I thought maybe
someone was doing a play. It was really wierd ... he had a top
hat and the perfect dress. That was what really freaked me
out."
Besides spooking the drowsy or the unwary, Lincoln's
Spirit appeared on campus to establish a "Student State," and
to encourage support for the "Ten Demandments of Youth."
Governors and lieutenant governors would be elected from
each chapter of the Student State on college and high school
campuses under his plan. His Ten Demandments of Youth ask
for fairer laws for those who have not reached the age of
adulthood.
"I am trying to get to be the leader of the youth of
America,"he says.
Appeals Fail
His appeal to students here at his alma mater apparently
has been less than seductive. According to Ann Kimball of the
ASSU Council of Presidents, when she saw him, "I just about
jumped out of my skin."
The unlikely looking leader of youth says of his visit to the
ASSU offices that "they discouraged me here." Visits to the
President's Office and the General Secretary's Office did not
meet with success, either.
But he claims his attempts to set up student states around
the Bay Area has met with interest in many other schools and
colleges.
The first Student State was founded at Cambrian
Elementary School in Campbell, by 12-year old Lana
Schetzer. A headline of the thirty-first issue of the Lincoln
Aide Bulletin announces "Red Tape Cut to Shreds by Little
Girl. Gets First Student State in America Going in One Hour."
But the Spirit, just as well known in his role as 78-year-old
San Jose attorney Arthur L. "Abe" Johnson, has a history
that extends far back before his recent identity as Abe
Lincoln.
Says an employee at News and Publications in Encina, "His
story is kinda wierd and then maybe it isn't so wierd."
As far as his beard goes, Johnson says that on April 26,

1968, when a cashier at his bank told him he would look just
like the Abe Lincoln in Disneyland if he had a beard, he was
convinced to grow one. "Abe Lincoln is my patron saint," he
says.
He adds that now, "I worship my beard." And in an effort
to promote support for his "Lincoln Aide" society, of which
he is the chief member, he hands shiny 1971 Lincoln pennies
to those he talks to.
The $651 he has spent so far on this form of publicity in
the last three years are worth it, he says. They are perfumed,
and when you smell one, "you get the scent."
Johnson's dedication to the memory of President Lincoln's
ideals and aims is understandable in light of his personal
history.
During the 1930's he held the position of attorney and
chief deputy of the California state labor commission, where
he was credited with drafting the California state wage law
prevailing at that time.
According to an article in The San Francisco News of
March 19, 1934, "His chief attributes, according to those
about him, are a quick resentment at injustice, particularly
when it affects a person in no position to fight back.
"He has been deprived of many a dinner on time and many
an hour of sleep by an immigrant who can't speak English, a
common laborer owed a few dollars in pay, or an entertainer
gypped by a fly-by-night promoter."
He himself has faced a physical disadvantage since birth.
Due to a birth defect he has no right hand, and a finger on his
left hand was taken off in an accident at the age of three.
Moving on to bigger things in 1938, Johnson says he
became the chief counsel for 150 congressmen of both parties
on matters relating to the newly drafted social security law.
This "most sacred statute" as he calls it, was lacking in
many respects, and one aspect he fought particularly hard for
was medical care for the aged.
At the same time he acted as editor for the General Welfare
News-Advocate, which sported below its banner the saying,
"America ... Love it or Leave it."
Johnson claims to have originated the saying, but has been
upset to see it appear in recent times as a bumper sticker. He
has "partially disowned it,"he says and has expanded it
further: "America . .. Love It or Leave It; Perfect It or Lose
It."
At 78 years old, he has now turned his attention from the

aged to youth. His conviction is that if we "remedy the
defects in our society and in our youth, things will be
perfect."
His office in San Jose, where he sleeps at night to be near
his telephone, contains two warnings among his many
facsimiles of important national documents along with
portraits of Lincoln.
Dc.vn in one corner is a snake representing the pernicious
influence of dope. Higher up in another is a picture of flames,
he says, representing "the flames of campus violence which
can consume all of America Beautiful."
