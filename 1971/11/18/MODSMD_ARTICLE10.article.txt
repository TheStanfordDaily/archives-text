## The 						Real Pete McCloskey 
### 
David mund

In Berkeley on September 10th, Republican
Congressman Pete McCloskey was asked, "Why do
you support the draft?"
McCloskey replied that "Eighteen months in
the army is a small price to pay for the privilege of
being an American."
This answer should not be considered
surprising, although it does clash with McCloskey's
image. Congressman McCloskey is the prototype
of a new kind of politician, the media progressive,
a presidential candidate whose public image bears
little resemblance to his actual record.
Take the question of endorsements, a key
indicator of a politician's own philosophy. In
1970, McCloskey supported Governor Ronald
Reagan and Senator George Murphy for
re-election.
In the field of Constitutional rights and civil
liberties, McCloskey has a dismal record.
McCloskey was one of only 15 Congressmen who
voted against the 1970 Women's Rights
Amendment banning discrimination on account of
sex.
Yet McCloskey has voted consistently in favor
of appropriations for investigative work by the
House Un-American Activities Committee
(HUAC), now renamed the House Internal
Security Committee. McCloskey also supported
the 1970 D.C. Crime Bill which contained
provisions for preventive detention, "no-knock,"
and wiretapping.
In addition, McCloskey backed a measure in
1968 to deny Federal aid to students who
participate in campus demonstrations. In his home
district of San Mateo, McCloskey runs for
Congress as a law and order candidate.
While other Congressmen and Senators have
tried for many years to re-order national priorities
McCloskey has repeatedly opposed efforts to cut
military spending.
McCloskey voted against a recent effort to
eliminate 370 million dollars budgeted for the new
B-l long range bomber. He also opposed a pair of
recent motions to reduce the fiscal 1972 military
research and development budget.
Although McCloskey resists efforts to reduce
military spending, he has no such qualms about
cutting domestic spending. McCloskey has been
among the staunchest supporters of President
Nixon's domestic policies. When Nixon vetoed

bills to provide Federal funding for hospital
construction, housing programs, and Health,
Education, and Welfare spending, McCloskey
voted to sustain Nixon's vetoes.
McCloskey voted against the Housing and
Urban Development Act of 1968 which was
designed to solve the housing shortage by helping
the poor purchase homes and rent apartments.
In the field of health, McCloskey has voted
against funds for medical services, and the
National Institute of Health. When President
Nixon sought to cut Labor-Health, Education and
Welfare funds for fiscal year 1970, McCloskey
supported him.
McCloskey has voted to limit expenditures for
aid to education and food stamps. He supported a
bill to compel food stamp recipients to take jobs
paying $1.30 per hour, 30 cents below the
minimum wage, and also backed a proposal to
restrict the rights of students and striking workers
to receive food stamps.
Congressman McCloskey has also supported the
loan of U.S. military vessels to the Greek
dictatorship, while opposing a measure to ease
controls on the export of non-strategic goods to
Communist nations.
In June of 1971 Conress was debating the Sugar
Act and some liberal congressmen wished to try
and challenge the section of the Act which
provided for a certain quota of sugar to be
purchased from the Republic of South Africa. A
parliamentary motion was introduced to prevent
this attack on the South African sugar quota and
McCloskey voted in favor of the motion.
The Congressional Quarterly, source for
material in this article, provides the best capsule
analysis of Pete McCloskey's record. On those
issues in 1970 where the liberals were on one side,
the conservatives on the other, McCloskey cast a
majority of his votes with the conservatives.
In conclusion, the McCloskey record is a tribute
to the power of press agents and the media to
create a progressive image that cannot be
supported by the facts. How far McCloskey's
media image can take him is anybody's guess, but
sooner or later his record is bound to catch up
with him.

In the field of health, McCloskey has voted
against funds for medical services, and the
National Institute of Health. When President
Nixon sought to cut Labor-Health, Education and

supported him.
McCloskey has voted to limit expenditures for
aid to education and food stamps. He supported a
bill to compel food stamp recipients to take jobs
paying $1.30 per hour, 30 cents below the
minimum wage, and also backed a proposal to
restrict the rights of students and striking workers

Congressman McCloskey has also supported the

In Berkeley on September 10th, Republican
Congressman Pete McCloskey was asked, "Why do
you support the draft?"
McCloskey replied that "Eighteen months in
the army is a small price to pay for the privilege of
being an American."
This answer should not be considered
surprising, although it does clash with McCloskey's
image. Congressman McCloskey is the prototype
of a new kind of politician, the media progressive,
a presidential candidate whose public image bears
little resemblance to his actual record.
Take the question of endorsements, a key
indicator of a politician's own philosophy. In
1970, McCloskey supported Governor Ronald
Reagan and Senator George Murphy for
re-election.
In the field of Constitutional rights and civil
liberties, McCloskey has a dismal record.
McCloskey was one of only 15 Congressmen who
voted against the 1970 Women's Rights
Amendment banning discrimination on account of
sex.
Yet McCloskey has voted consistently in favor
of appropriations for investigative work by the
House Un-American Activities Committee
(HUAC), now renamed the House Internal
Security Committee. McCloskey also supported
the 1970 D.C. Crime Bill which contained
provisions for preventive detention, "no-knock,"
and wiretapping.
In addition, McCloskey backed a measure in
1968 to deny Federal aid to students who
participate in campus demonstrations. In his home
district of San Mateo, McCloskey runs for
Congress as a law and order candidate.
While other Congressmen and Senators have
tried for many years to re-order national priorities
McCloskey has repeatedly opposed efforts to cut
military spending.
McCloskey voted against a recent effort to
eliminate 370 million dollars budgeted for the new
B-l long range bomber. He also opposed a pair of
recent motions to reduce the fiscal 1972 military
research and development budget.
Although McCloskey resists efforts to reduce
military spending, he has no such qualms about
cutting domestic spending. McCloskey has been
among the staunchest supporters of President
Nixon's domestic policies. When Nixon vetoed

bills to provide Federal funding for hospital
construction, housing programs, and Health,
Education, and Welfare spending, McCloskey
voted to sustain Nixon's vetoes.
McCloskey voted against the Housing and
Urban Development Act of 1968 which was
designed to solve the housing shortage by helping
