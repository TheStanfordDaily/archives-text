Are you unsure of the future?
Does the thought of leaving the
University Community plague you
with insecurity?
To solve these and other
related problems, a student
volunteer group recently began
Career Consultants, designed to
provide students with alumni
contacts in professional areas of
interest to both. The aim of the
program is to provide, on a
one-to-one basis, career conseling
to a student interested in a
particular field.
The Consultant service,
sponsored by the Stanford
Alumni Association, has been set
up to arrange meetings amond
interested students and
professionals in the field or they
set up interviews or arrange
short-term internships. Thus the
student has a chance to investigate
the realities of a profession that
may have only been vaguely
familiar to him.

The program is under the
direction of Laurie Laven, a
sophomore from Rock ford
Illinois, who modeled it after one
initiated by her father at
Rock ford College several years
ago.
"The program really helped
Rockford College students,
(many) of who graduated with
B.A.'s they don't know what to
do with. They talked to people in
a variety of areas.. . toured
hospitals, jails, the Chrysler
plant—anything they wanted to
do was provided for."
Laven also feels that "the
program would be a great success
here using the additional resources
of Stanford and Stanford Alumni
in the Bay Area."
Clause Shelling, an insurance
broker from Palo Alto, heads the
professional Advisory Board set
up to aid the consultant program.
Board members include
representatives from the areas of
law, graphic arts/advertising,
insurance, real estate
development, banking, and public
education administration.
Shelling stated, "We are hoping
that students interested will
generate enough activity that we
may occasionally receive some
rather difficult assignments;
however I am confident that
between the Advisory Board and
our business contacts, we can

fulfill any request, no matter how
unusual."
Don Casey, a Board member in
graphic arts, emphasizes that this
program is designed to counsel,
not recruit: "We are interested in
providing the student with a real
insight into both good and bad
aspects of a profession and are not
trying to sell them on any
particular career."
Cognizant of a trend away
from big business and corporate
endeavor, the Advisory Board will
be focusing on new areas of
interest.
Jack Alexander, with the Palo
Alto Unified School District,
comments: "As I work with civic
groups, city government,
newspapers and school people, I
am acutely aware of the
community's ever-expanding
efforts related to problems which
I believe students find critical,
such as environmental control,
minority group enterprise and a
wide range of social services.
"We can put students together
with people in these endeavors
who share their concerns and
expectations,"
The success of Career
Consulting will depend on student
interest. Laven says,"The
program will grow as large as
student demand requires. It's
extremely flexible, designed to fit
individual students needs. Those

interested should call Bowman
Alumni House or drop by."
Should student interest
demand, the program is prepared
to move into other geographic
areas and alumni clubs all over the
country' have already been alerted
that the program would like their
assistance. A particularly
enthusiastic response has already
come from Los Angeles.
