## Barber Styles Hairy Mess 
### RICK HASKELL 
How many of you long hairs
have been staying away from the
barbershops for fear that an
unscrupulous barber will cut off
some of your long beautiful
locks? Have no more fears for
Leland Stanford Junior University
now has its own men's hair stylist
who specializes in long tresses.
No longer should there be
shaggy hair, unmanageable
cowlicks, or (dread the thought)
split ends! If you have these
problems you must run to set up
an appointment with Jim
Newman in the Tresidder Union
barber shop.
When you go in to see
Newman, you will find him hard
at work sculptering the locks of a
customer with all the enthusiasm
of a true artist. His careful work
makes him seem to be an artist
trying to get just the right effect
out of each strand.
His working area is partitioned
off from the rest of the barber
S!lop, stating by physical means
ithat he is not one of those
white-shirted hair rapists that call
themselves barbers. Around the

walls he has drawings of the
various styles that he is capable of
creating, all on young men either
golfing, playing tennis, or making
a hit with a young lady.
Regular Barber
Once inside you will get all the
hairy details from Newman on
what it takes to become a stylist.
Some oldtimers around campus
probably remember when Jim was
a regular barber on campus about
four years ago. But, according to
him, "There had to be more to
hair than just cutting it. Anyone
could do that. I wanted to fix hair
so that it fit the personality,
looks, and character of the
individual."
So Newman went to school for
two years and took the equivalent
of 180 units of courses in men's
hair styling. He also claims that
his education did not end there.
He still goes to seminars 8 to 10
times a year. The many
certificates on his wall stand as
evidence that he has completed
course after course in the art of
styling.
Newman's workshop looks like
a miniature laboratory. He has a
microscope set up to study the
hairs of his clients and discover
any defects. His shelves are not
lined with the clippers and greasy
kid's stuff of conventional barbers.
Rather, he has hair spray, dryers,

and organic shampoos.
He will rarely let anyone tell
him what style they want.
Instead, he wili tell his patients
(almost like a doctor) how he
thinks they will look best. He
takes into account such things as
root patterns (the natural way
that the hair goes) and facial
features. He claims that there are
certain hair styles for long, square,
or fat faces. Newman says that
"chainging your hair style is the
only way to change your face,
short of plastic surgery."
Avante Look
The success of a men's hair
stylist depends greatly on his
specialty, and Newman calls his
the Avante look. The Avante look
lets the man who wants to be
straight wear his hair short during
the day, but with a flip of his
styling brush at night become
"hip or mod", as Newman puts it.
The idea is to make the hair
look longer than it really is. If all

the hairs are cut to the same
length, combing the short hairs
over the ear can disguise the
previously serious daytime
personality.
