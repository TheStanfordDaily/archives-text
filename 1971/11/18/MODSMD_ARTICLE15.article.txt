Following recommendations of
a three-member selection panel
from other institutions, President
Ricahrd W. Lyman of Stanford
Tuesday, Nov. 16, announced the
appointment of five arbitrators to
serve as prospective hearing
officers under new grievance
procedures at the University.
They are Prof. Reginald H.
Alleyne Jr., acting professor of
law at UCLA; Prof. Alice H. Cook
of the New York State School of
Industrial and Labor Relations at
Cornell; Julius G. Getman,
professor of law at Indiana
University; Adolf M. Koven, San
Francisco attorney and arbitrator
who has taught at Berkeley, USF,
UCLA, and San Francisco State;
and Melvin Lennard, Pacific
Palisades attorney and arbitrator,
who has heard and decided

approximately 700
labor-management disputes in the
past 18 years.
The selection panel which
made its recommendations to
President Lyman included Prof.
Benjamin Aaron, director of the
UCLA Institute of Industrial
Relations; William B. Gould of the
Wayne State University Law
School, now visiting Harvard; and
Jean T. McKelvey of the New
York School of Industrial and
Labor Relations.
Under the new Stanford
grievance procedure, an employee
who is dissatisfied with the
disposition of his grievance in the
initial stages may in certain
instances request that his
grievance be heard by an outside
officer.
