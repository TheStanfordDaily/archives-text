# Disappointing 'Dracula' Show
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
It seemed like a verrrry-interesting idea for a musical. Dracula has
left Transylvania (presumably because it's all sucked up) and he is a
night club proprietor in New York during the 1930'5. But he still gets
to live in a castle and bleed his harem which is made up primarily of
the club's chorus girls.
And then in the tradition of great romantics, he falls for the club's
headliner and we see that there is a heart somewhere under all that
blood. He is saved by the police at the last moment from his conniving
assistant who is intending to knife him. Then her love overcomes her
hesitancy about marrying a vampire, and the dream is fulfilled: After
700 years, Dracula finds the perfect wife. Erich Segal might even be
moved to write another novel.
Ram's Head decided to perform this piece of nostalgia spiced with
horror for their annual Big Game Gaities this year. The cast seemed to
enjoy the show as did many friends and relatives who were quite
evident in a sparse opening night crowd on Tuesday. Unfortunately,
the problems of execution outweighed the built-in humor of the idea.
"Dracula" shows some promise as a musical comedy. A few of the
numbers are noteworthy. "Poor Crazy Renfield" is a hilarious
description of Dracula's right hand man who has an insect fetish. "No
One Loves Their Mother" and "A Doctor's Advice" are also funny,
well-written songs. And "Carfax" is a very catchy finale to ACT I,
complete with a cleverly choreographed Axe-Cheer. But these good
numbers are matched by an equal or greater number of forgettable
ones.
Simple And Unexciting
Too often the music is very simple and basically unexciting. And
many of the lyrics are equally simple and unoriginal, especially in
some of the love songs. The musical by itself still needs some work.
Still, "Dracula" has the advantage of many naturally funny

characters. First there's the vampire with the big cape and the funny
accent who has an assistant who likes to eat flies because "They're
crunchy." Then there's the stereotyped goodie-goodie boyfriend who
idolizes a beautiful girl, who has an over-protective and domineering
old bag of a mother. Characters like these have to provoke a
considerable amount of laughter.
But there could've been many more laughs and much more
enjoyment and a much higher overall reaction if more of the cast
achieved a level comparable to that of a few performers.
Ten Hannon as Renfield, is the best performer of the production.
He has a beautiful New York accent which fits in perfectly with his
suave, gangster mannerisms. He is slow at the beginning, but comes on
strong to be the highlight of the night. He also can sing clearly and
powerfully, a talent which is not universally found in the cast.
Mixed Reaction
David K. Miller as Count Dracula provokes a mixed reaction. He
does act well at times and some of his facial expressions are great,
especially when he is looking ghoulishly at the leading lady's neck. His
accent, which is very important to a successful performance, is good
sometimes, but at certain points it seems more nasal and sometimes
more Italian than Draculish. Still he does deliver some lines perfectly,
especially the hilarious one, "Becoming a vampire was one of the great
achievements of my life."
But Miller additionally has some problems with the way he moves
around. He seems to often be walking on his tiptoes or moving in a
strange fashion which doesn't really fit the image of the character.
However he does show enough potential overall to make you feel that
he could be impressive, after a little more practice.
Miranda Barry would be good as Dracula's true love, Lucy, if she
could sing better. Seh seemed to lack clarity and power many times
and if I couldn't understand her in the sixth row, 1 wonder what it
was like farther back. Especially difficult to understand was her debut
song as the new headliner at Dracula's club.
There's a big build-up for this new superstar, she comes down the
stairs followed by the Vampettes, and she sings the "Forty-Second
Street Vamp." Unfortunately it might as well have been an
instrumental, for I didn't catch too many complete phrases. Her "In A
Dream" solo was fine, but her singing overall needs improvement.
Overwhelmed Boy Friend
Some of the lesser characters were quite competent. Robert L.
Saenz was good as the dumb, overwhelmed boyfriend of Lucy who
finally finds what he needs and decides to marry his female
equivalent, the shy hat check girl at the club, Alice, who is played well
by Barb Honegger.
Emily Leavitt was strong as Lucy's battle-axe mother as was E.
Christopher Ryan as a police inspector. And Emmitt Leon O'Neill did
a great scene singing "A Doctor's Advice", the hilarious number about
the power of positive thinking.
The chorus girls at the club, who all doubled as member's of
Dracula's harem of brides, gave mixed performances. Some girls could
sing and dance. Others couldn't. At times, the mixture of the two
produced some fairly obvious problems. Some of Dracula's waiters
also had problems co-ordinating their movements as a group.
The sets were fairly well-done, but the noise with which they were
moved was a bit discomforting. Most of Shirlee Dodge's choreography
was alright in conception, if not always perfect in execution. But
some of her blocking and movements seemed to produce confusion
and unnecessary problems.
Admittedly the show had to be put together quickly. With a little
more time and practice, the production could possibly improve.
Probably what is most needed is additional talent. "Dracula" was
somewhat entertaining, but for what it could've been, it was a
dissappointment.
(Dracula will be performed in Dinkelspiel Auditorium tonight and
Saturday night at 8:30 p.m. and tomorrow night at 9:30 p.m. Tickets
are priced at $3.50 general and $2 for students.)

considerable amount of laughter.
But there could've been many more laughs and much more
enjoyment and a much higher overall reaction if more of the cast
achieved a level comparable to that of a few performers.
Ten Hannon as Renfield, is the best performer of the production.
He has a beautiful New York accent which fits in perfectly with his
suave, gangster mannerisms. He is slow at the beginning, but comes on
strong to be the highlight of the night. He also can sing clearly and
powerfully, a talent which is not universally found in the cast.
Mixed Reaction
David K. Miller as Count Dracula provokes a mixed reaction. He
does act well at times and some of his facial expressions are great,
especially when he is looking ghoulishly at the leading lady's neck. His
accent, which is very important to a successful performance, is good
sometimes, but at certain points it seems more nasal and sometimes
more Italian than Draculish. Still he does deliver some lines perfectly,
especially the hilarious one, "Becoming a vampire was one of the great
achievements of my life."
But Miller additionally has some problems with the way he moves
around. He seems to often be walking on his tiptoes or moving in a
strange fashion which doesn't really fit the image of the character.
However he does show enough potential overall to make you feel that
he could be impressive, after a little more practice.
Miranda Barry would be good as Dracula's true love, Lucy, if she
could sing better. Seh seemed to lack clarity and power many times
and if I couldn't understand her in the sixth row, 1 wonder what it
was like farther back. Especially difficult to understand was her debut
song as the new headliner at Dracula's club.
There's a big build-up for this new superstar, she comes down the
stairs followed by the Vampettes, and she sings the "Forty-Second
Street Vamp." Unfortunately it might as well have been an
instrumental, for I didn't catch too many complete phrases. Her "In A
Dream" solo was fine, but her singing overall needs improvement.
Overwhelmed Boy Friend
Some of the lesser characters were quite competent. Robert L.
Saenz was good as the dumb, overwhelmed boyfriend of Lucy who
finally finds what he needs and decides to marry his female
equivalent, the shy hat check girl at the club, Alice, who is played well
by Barb Honegger.
Emily Leavitt was strong as Lucy's battle-axe mother as was E.
Christopher Ryan as a police inspector. And Emmitt Leon O'Neill did
a great scene singing "A Doctor's Advice", the hilarious number about
the power of positive thinking.
The chorus girls at the club, who all doubled as member's of
Dracula's harem of brides, gave mixed performances. Some girls could
sing and dance. Others couldn't. At times, the mixture of the two
produced some fairly obvious problems. Some of Dracula's waiters
also had problems co-ordinating their movements as a group.
The sets were fairly well-done, but the noise with which they were
moved was a bit discomforting. Most of Shirlee Dodge's choreography
was alright in conception, if not always perfect in execution. But
some of her blocking and movements seemed to produce confusion
and unnecessary problems.
Admittedly the show had to be put together quickly. With a little
more time and practice, the production could possibly improve.
Probably what is most needed is additional talent. "Dracula" was
somewhat entertaining, but for what it could've been, it was a
dissappointment.
(Dracula will be performed in Dinkelspiel Auditorium tonight and
Saturday night at 8:30 p.m. and tomorrow night at 9:30 p.m. Tickets
are priced at $3.50 general and $2 for students.)

"MY WHAT BIG TEETH YOU HAVE!"~David MiUer is seen in the
biting title role of "Dracula" which is currently being presented in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium. Miranda Barry appears at Lucy in the Ram's
Head Gaieties production which will run through Saturday night.
It seemed like a verrrry-interesting idea for a musical. Dracula has
left Transylvania (presumably because it's all sucked up) and he is a
night club proprietor in New York during the 1930'5. But he still gets
to live in a castle and bleed his harem which is made up primarily of
the club's chorus girls.
And then in the tradition of great romantics, he falls for the club's
headliner and we see that there is a heart somewhere under all that
blood. He is saved by the police at the last moment from his conniving
assistant who is intending to knife him. Then her love overcomes her
hesitancy about marrying a vampire, and the dream is fulfilled: After
700 years, Dracula finds the perfect wife. Erich Segal might even be
moved to write another novel.
Ram's Head decided to perform this piece of nostalgia spiced with
horror for their annual Big Game Gaities this year. The cast seemed to
enjoy the show as did many friends and relatives who were quite
evident in a sparse opening night crowd on Tuesday. Unfortunately,
the problems of execution outweighed the built-in humor of the idea.
"Dracula" shows some promise as a musical comedy. A few of the
numbers are noteworthy. "Poor Crazy Renfield" is a hilarious
description of Dracula's right hand man who has an insect fetish. "No
One Loves Their Mother" and "A Doctor's Advice" are also funny,
well-written songs. And "Carfax" is a very catchy finale to ACT I,
complete with a cleverly choreographed Axe-Cheer. But these good
numbers are matched by an equal or greater number of forgettable
ones.
Simple And Unexciting
Too often the music is very simple and basically unexciting. And
many of the lyrics are equally simple and unoriginal, especially in
some of the love songs. The musical by itself still needs some work.
Still, "Dracula" has the advantage of many naturally funny

characters. First there's the vampire with the big cape and the funny
accent who has an assistant who likes to eat flies because "They're
crunchy." Then there's the stereotyped goodie-goodie boyfriend who
idolizes a beautiful girl, who has an over-protective and domineering
old bag of a mother. Characters like these have to provoke a
considerable amount of laughter.

equivalent, the shy hat check girl at the club, Alice, who is played well
by Barb Honegger.
Emily Leavitt was strong as Lucy's battle-axe mother as was E.
Christopher Ryan as a police inspector. And Emmitt Leon O'Neill did
a great scene singing "A Doctor's Advice", the hilarious number about
the power of positive thinking.
The chorus girls at the club, who all doubled as member's of
Dracula's harem of brides, gave mixed performances. Some girls could
sing and dance. Others couldn't. At times, the mixture of the two
produced some fairly obvious problems. Some of Dracula's waiters
also had problems co-ordinating their movements as a group.
The sets were fairly well-done, but the noise with which they were
moved was a bit discomforting. Most of Shirlee Dodge's choreography
was alright in conception, if not always perfect in execution. But
some of her blocking and movements seemed to produce confusion
and unnecessary problems.
Admittedly the show had to be put together quickly. With a little
more time and practice, the production could possibly improve.
Probably what is most needed is additional talent. "Dracula" was
somewhat entertaining, but for what it could've been, it was a
dissappointment.
(Dracula will be performed in Dinkelspiel Auditorium tonight and
Saturday night at 8:30 p.m. and tomorrow night at 9:30 p.m. Tickets
are priced at $3.50 general and $2 for students.)

"MY WHAT BIG TEETH YOU HAVE!"~David MiUer is seen in the
biting title role of "Dracula" which is currently being presented in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium. Miranda Barry appears at Lucy in the Ram's
Head Gaieties production which will run through Saturday night.
It seemed like a verrrry-interesting idea for a musical. Dracula has
left Transylvania (presumably because it's all sucked up) and he is a
night club proprietor in New York during the 1930'5. But he still gets
to live in a castle and bleed his harem which is made up primarily of
the club's chorus girls.
And then in the tradition of great romantics, he falls for the club's
headliner and we see that there is a heart somewhere under all that
blood. He is saved by the police at the last moment from his conniving
assistant who is intending to knife him. Then her love overcomes her
hesitancy about marrying a vampire, and the dream is fulfilled: After
700 years, Dracula finds the perfect wife. Erich Segal might even be
moved to write another novel.
Ram's Head decided to perform this piece of nostalgia spiced with
horror for their annual Big Game Gaities this year. The cast seemed to
enjoy the show as did many friends and relatives who were quite
evident in a sparse opening night crowd on Tuesday. Unfortunately,
the problems of execution outweighed the built-in humor of the idea.
"Dracula" shows some promise as a musical comedy. A few of the
numbers are noteworthy. "Poor Crazy Renfield" is a hilarious
description of Dracula's right hand man who has an insect fetish. "No
One Loves Their Mother" and "A Doctor's Advice" are also funny,
well-written songs. And "Carfax" is a very catchy finale to ACT I,
complete with a cleverly choreographed Axe-Cheer. But these good
numbers are matched by an equal or greater number of forgettable
ones.
Simple And Unexciting
Too often the music is very simple and basically unexciting. And
many of the lyrics are equally simple and unoriginal, especially in
some of the love songs. The musical by itself still needs some work.
Still, "Dracula" has the advantage of many naturally funny

characters. First there's the vampire with the big cape and the funny
accent who has an assistant who likes to eat flies because "They're
crunchy." Then there's the stereotyped goodie-goodie boyfriend who
idolizes a beautiful girl, who has an over-protective and domineering
old bag of a mother. Characters like these have to provoke a
considerable amount of laughter.
But there could've been many more laughs and much more
enjoyment and a much higher overall reaction if more of the cast
achieved a level comparable to that of a few performers.
Ten Hannon as Renfield, is the best performer of the production.
He has a beautiful New York accent which fits in perfectly with his
suave, gangster mannerisms. He is slow at the beginning, but comes on
strong to be the highlight of the night. He also can sing clearly and
powerfully, a talent which is not universally found in the cast.
Mixed Reaction
David K. Miller as Count Dracula provokes a mixed reaction. He
does act well at times and some of his facial expressions are great,
especially when he is looking ghoulishly at the leading lady's neck. His
accent, which is very important to a successful performance, is good
sometimes, but at certain points it seems more nasal and sometimes
more Italian than Draculish. Still he does deliver some lines perfectly,
especially the hilarious one, "Becoming a vampire was one of the great
achievements of my life."
But Miller additionally has some problems with the way he moves
around. He seems to often be walking on his tiptoes or moving in a
strange fashion which doesn't really fit the image of the character.
However he does show enough potential overall to make you feel that
he could be impressive, after a little more practice.
Miranda Barry would be good as Dracula's true love, Lucy, if she
could sing better. Seh seemed to lack clarity and power many times
and if I couldn't understand her in the sixth row, 1 wonder what it
was like farther back. Especially difficult to understand was her debut
song as the new headliner at Dracula's club.
There's a big build-up for this new superstar, she comes down the
stairs followed by the Vampettes, and she sings the "Forty-Second
Street Vamp." Unfortunately it might as well have been an
instrumental, for I didn't catch too many complete phrases. Her "In A
Dream" solo was fine, but her singing overall needs improvement.
Overwhelmed Boy Friend
Some of the lesser characters were quite competent. Robert L.
Saenz was good as the dumb, overwhelmed boyfriend of Lucy who
finally finds what he needs and decides to marry his female
equivalent, the shy hat check girl at the club, Alice, who is played well
by Barb Honegger.
