# Brilliant Evening Of Brecht
## 
### DOUG ARTHUR 
What makes an entertainer
first-rate? Perhaps it's something
more than excellent audience
rapport (Gisela May received no
less than eleven curtain calls at
Cal's Zellerbach auditorium
Tuesday night,) or singing
expertise, or stage charisma.
It's a feeling that we, the
audience, experience: a
realization that we're watching
quality material performed by
competent artists who enjoy their
art. Gisela May knows how to
create that feeling.
From the moment that she
walked into the spotlight to
perform the works of Bertolt
Brecht, to the endless 'bravo's' at
the conclusion of the
performance, she commanded the
stage. Although she sang mostly in
German, no one required a
translator.

May's gestures and facial
expressions illustrated the songs
of Brecht better than any English
lyrics could. The audience
perceived her virtuosity from the
very beginning, she was free to
perform a rich variety of songs
and poems.
Major Songs
And what a variety! She sang
the major songs with scores by
Brecht's three collaborators: Kurt
Weill, Paul Dessau, and Hans
Eisler, read poetry and acted in a
monologue from"The Jewish
Wife."
She began with songs from the
Brecht/Weill play, "Happy End."
"The Bilbao Song," one of three
from this play, utilized a muted
trumpet and had a swinging
rhythm. The singer became almost
anti-musical with her emphasis
upon each word which undercuts
the musical accompaniment. She

comes to a grinding halt and says
"Ich habe es vergessen" ("I've
forgetten the words")—a stagey
trick, but it works.
One song from"The Rise and
Fall of Mahagonny" entitled "Das
Lied der Eisenbahntruppe von
Fort Donald," gendered an
immediate response from the
spectators. The Doors recorded
this a few years back and I believe
their title was "Whiskey Bar."
Also familiar were the
selections from"The Three penny
Opera;" but the presentation was
quite innovative. When Mrs.
Peachum sings the "Ballad of
Sexual Submissiveness" to her
daughter, we view as well as hear
the message.
Humorous Effect
May strikes a stiff attitude to
deliver this tirade, she holds her
hands close together and rocks
back and forth on her feet. The
somber saxophone and piano
music completed the humorous
effect of the song.
Weill's music has the ability to
suggest an atmosphere. We
formulated a feeling of revenge
from the dissonance in the "Song
of the Pirate Jenny."
A demonstration of pacifist
war cripples in Potsdam inspired
Brecht's "Zu Potsdam under den
Eichen." Weill's musical score
employs the motifs of a funeral
dirge. The rigorous trumpet and
snare drum lend a tone of the
military march to contrast the
satirical words.
May next sang numbers from
"Mother Courage," Brecht's best
known play in the
English-speaking world. She wore
a simple white shawl to denote
the character of Anna Fierling.
Mother Courage's theme song,
where she calls the soldiers to

come and buy/die, gains an added
insight with the singer's agonizing,
monotonous step movements. She
is truging onward through the
devastated land. The song ends
with her closed eyes and dying
voice.
Have you ever seen anyone
laugh and cry simultaneously?
Gisela May does it in a moving
scene from"The Jewish Wife."
The wife (being Jewish) must
leave her husband and her home
for her own safety. She calls a few
friends to say farewell; she gives
them false reasons for her "trip."
The conversations are lively, often
humorous, and are painfully
human. All the time, the wife is
looking at a picture of her
husband and wondering how she
will be able to leave him.
Other political songs included
the "Ballad of the prostitute
Marie Sanders" and a "Song of a
proletarian Mother." In both of
these, the piano accompanies the
verses while a clarinet and
saxophone play the chorus.
So often we think of Brecht as
only composing satirical or ironic
lyrics to his songs. At least two
songs from "Schweyk in World
War II" possessed a cheery,
good-natured quality. "Song of a
small Wind" conjured up soft
rememberances while "Song of
the Goblet" enumerated all the
joys of the tavern (which you
could have for only eight hellers.)
"The Ballad of the Soldier's
Wife" exposes the close
association between the words
and music when Brecht wants to
make a point. In this case, the
soldier's wife receives gifts from
every country that the Nazis
occupy until she receives a
widow's veil from Russia. May's
gruff voice and the prominent
snare drum drive the last lines
home.
Skillfully Simple
The singer next read Brecht's
moving poem, "To Posterity." It
sets forth a personal testament of
the poet to future ages. Her
presentation was skillfully simple
and straightforward.
The evening almost closed with
a splendid "Friedenslied," (peace
song) written by Pablo Neruda
and Brecht and composed by
Eisler. It has a catchy tune and
pleasing lyrics which we heard in
German, then English.
The audience wasn't about to
let May leave. They demanded,
and got, three more songs,
including "Mack the Knife."
Gisela May gives the type of
performance where its an honor
to be a spectator.

joys of the tavern (which you
could have for only eight hellers.)
"The Ballad of the Soldier's
Wife" exposes the close
association between the words
and music when Brecht wants to
make a point. In this case, the
soldier's wife receives gifts from
every country that the Nazis
occupy until she receives a
widow's veil from Russia. May's
gruff voice and the prominent
snare drum drive the last lines
home.
Skillfully Simple
The singer next read Brecht's
moving poem, "To Posterity." It
sets forth a personal testament of
the poet to future ages. Her
presentation was skillfully simple
and straightforward.
The evening almost closed with
a splendid "Friedenslied," (peace
song) written by Pablo Neruda
and Brecht and composed by
Eisler. It has a catchy tune and
pleasing lyrics which we heard in
German, then English.
The audience wasn't about to
let May leave. They demanded,
and got, three more songs,
including "Mack the Knife."
Gisela May gives the type of
performance where its an honor
to be a spectator.
What makes an entertainer
first-rate? Perhaps it's something
more than excellent audience
rapport (Gisela May received no
less than eleven curtain calls at
Cal's Zellerbach auditorium
Tuesday night,) or singing
expertise, or stage charisma.
It's a feeling that we, the
audience, experience: a
realization that we're watching
quality material performed by
competent artists who enjoy their
art. Gisela May knows how to
create that feeling.
From the moment that she
walked into the spotlight to
perform the works of Bertolt
Brecht, to the endless 'bravo's' at
the conclusion of the
performance, she commanded the
stage. Although she sang mostly in
German, no one required a
translator.

May's gestures and facial
expressions illustrated the songs
of Brecht better than any English
lyrics could. The audience
perceived her virtuosity from the
very beginning, she was free to
perform a rich variety of songs
and poems.
Major Songs
And what a variety! She sang
the major songs with scores by
Brecht's three collaborators: Kurt
Weill, Paul Dessau, and Hans
Eisler, read poetry and acted in a
monologue from"The Jewish
Wife."
She began with songs from the
Brecht/Weill play, "Happy End."
"The Bilbao Song," one of three
from this play, utilized a muted
trumpet and had a swinging
rhythm. The singer became almost
anti-musical with her emphasis
upon each word which undercuts
the musical accompaniment. She

comes to a grinding halt and says
"Ich habe es vergessen" ("I've
forgetten the words")—a stagey
trick, but it works.
One song from"The Rise and
Fall of Mahagonny" entitled "Das
Lied der Eisenbahntruppe von
Fort Donald," gendered an
immediate response from the
spectators. The Doors recorded
this a few years back and I believe
their title was "Whiskey Bar."
Also familiar were the
selections from"The Three penny
Opera;" but the presentation was
quite innovative. When Mrs.
Peachum sings the "Ballad of
Sexual Submissiveness" to her
daughter, we view as well as hear
the message.
Humorous Effect
May strikes a stiff attitude to
deliver this tirade, she holds her
hands close together and rocks
back and forth on her feet. The
somber saxophone and piano
music completed the humorous
effect of the song.
Weill's music has the ability to
suggest an atmosphere. We
formulated a feeling of revenge
from the dissonance in the "Song
of the Pirate Jenny."
A demonstration of pacifist
war cripples in Potsdam inspired
Brecht's "Zu Potsdam under den
Eichen." Weill's musical score
employs the motifs of a funeral
dirge. The rigorous trumpet and
snare drum lend a tone of the
military march to contrast the
satirical words.
May next sang numbers from
"Mother Courage," Brecht's best
known play in the
English-speaking world. She wore
a simple white shawl to denote
the character of Anna Fierling.
Mother Courage's theme song,
where she calls the soldiers to

come and buy/die, gains an added
insight with the singer's agonizing,
monotonous step movements. She
is truging onward through the
devastated land. The song ends
with her closed eyes and dying
voice.
Have you ever seen anyone
laugh and cry simultaneously?
Gisela May does it in a moving
scene from"The Jewish Wife."
The wife (being Jewish) must
leave her husband and her home
for her own safety. She calls a few
friends to say farewell; she gives
them false reasons for her "trip."
The conversations are lively, often
humorous, and are painfully
human. All the time, the wife is
looking at a picture of her
husband and wondering how she
will be able to leave him.
Other political songs included
the "Ballad of the prostitute
Marie Sanders" and a "Song of a
proletarian Mother." In both of
these, the piano accompanies the
verses while a clarinet and
saxophone play the chorus.
So often we think of Brecht as
only composing satirical or ironic
lyrics to his songs. At least two
songs from "Schweyk in World
War II" possessed a cheery,
good-natured quality. "Song of a
small Wind" conjured up soft
rememberances while "Song of
the Goblet" enumerated all the
joys of the tavern (which you
could have for only eight hellers.)

devastated land. The song ends
with her closed eyes and dying
voice.
Have you ever seen anyone
laugh and cry simultaneously?
Gisela May does it in a moving
scene from"The Jewish Wife."
The wife (being Jewish) must
leave her husband and her home
for her own safety. She calls a few
friends to say farewell; she gives
them false reasons for her "trip."
The conversations are lively, often
humorous, and are painfully
human. All the time, the wife is
looking at a picture of her
husband and wondering how she
will be able to leave him.
Other political songs included
the "Ballad of the prostitute
Marie Sanders" and a "Song of a
proletarian Mother." In both of
these, the piano accompanies the
verses while a clarinet and
saxophone play the chorus.
So often we think of Brecht as
only composing satirical or ironic
lyrics to his songs. At least two
songs from "Schweyk in World
War II" possessed a cheery,
good-natured quality. "Song of a
small Wind" conjured up soft
rememberances while "Song of
the Goblet" enumerated all the
joys of the tavern (which you
could have for only eight hellers.)
"The Ballad of the Soldier's
Wife" exposes the close
association between the words
and music when Brecht wants to
make a point. In this case, the
soldier's wife receives gifts from
every country that the Nazis
occupy until she receives a
widow's veil from Russia. May's
gruff voice and the prominent
snare drum drive the last lines
home.
Skillfully Simple
The singer next read Brecht's
moving poem, "To Posterity." It
sets forth a personal testament of
the poet to future ages. Her
presentation was skillfully simple
and straightforward.
The evening almost closed with
a splendid "Friedenslied," (peace
song) written by Pablo Neruda
and Brecht and composed by
Eisler. It has a catchy tune and
pleasing lyrics which we heard in
German, then English.
The audience wasn't about to
let May leave. They demanded,
and got, three more songs,
including "Mack the Knife."
Gisela May gives the type of
performance where its an honor
to be a spectator.
What makes an entertainer
first-rate? Perhaps it's something
more than excellent audience
rapport (Gisela May received no
less than eleven curtain calls at
Cal's Zellerbach auditorium
Tuesday night,) or singing
expertise, or stage charisma.
It's a feeling that we, the
audience, experience: a
realization that we're watching
quality material performed by
competent artists who enjoy their
art. Gisela May knows how to
create that feeling.
From the moment that she
walked into the spotlight to
perform the works of Bertolt
Brecht, to the endless 'bravo's' at
the conclusion of the
performance, she commanded the
stage. Although she sang mostly in
German, no one required a
translator.

May's gestures and facial
expressions illustrated the songs
of Brecht better than any English
lyrics could. The audience
perceived her virtuosity from the
very beginning, she was free to
perform a rich variety of songs
and poems.
Major Songs
And what a variety! She sang
the major songs with scores by
Brecht's three collaborators: Kurt
Weill, Paul Dessau, and Hans
Eisler, read poetry and acted in a
monologue from"The Jewish
Wife."
She began with songs from the
Brecht/Weill play, "Happy End."
"The Bilbao Song," one of three
from this play, utilized a muted
trumpet and had a swinging
rhythm. The singer became almost
anti-musical with her emphasis
upon each word which undercuts
the musical accompaniment. She

comes to a grinding halt and says
"Ich habe es vergessen" ("I've
forgetten the words")—a stagey
trick, but it works.
One song from"The Rise and
Fall of Mahagonny" entitled "Das
Lied der Eisenbahntruppe von
Fort Donald," gendered an
immediate response from the
spectators. The Doors recorded
this a few years back and I believe
their title was "Whiskey Bar."
Also familiar were the
selections from"The Three penny
Opera;" but the presentation was
quite innovative. When Mrs.
Peachum sings the "Ballad of
Sexual Submissiveness" to her
daughter, we view as well as hear
the message.
Humorous Effect
May strikes a stiff attitude to
deliver this tirade, she holds her
hands close together and rocks
back and forth on her feet. The
somber saxophone and piano
music completed the humorous
effect of the song.
Weill's music has the ability to
suggest an atmosphere. We
formulated a feeling of revenge
from the dissonance in the "Song
of the Pirate Jenny."
A demonstration of pacifist
war cripples in Potsdam inspired
Brecht's "Zu Potsdam under den
Eichen." Weill's musical score
employs the motifs of a funeral
dirge. The rigorous trumpet and
snare drum lend a tone of the
military march to contrast the
satirical words.
May next sang numbers from
"Mother Courage," Brecht's best
known play in the
English-speaking world. She wore
a simple white shawl to denote
the character of Anna Fierling.
Mother Courage's theme song,
where she calls the soldiers to

come and buy/die, gains an added
insight with the singer's agonizing,
monotonous step movements. She
is truging onward through the
devastated land. The song ends
with her closed eyes and dying
voice.
