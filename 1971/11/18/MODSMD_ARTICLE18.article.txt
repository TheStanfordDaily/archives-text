# 'Harold and Maude'
## Outrageous New Film 
### CRAIG WILSON 
When he was in film school at UCLA, Colin
Higgins' first short was laden with horrible
camerawork and non-synchronized sound. It was
titled simply "Opus One" and it won immediate
recognition among college audiences around the
country as part of the Genesis I film series.
"Opus I" was successful as a satire on student
films and Higgins wry view of the trials and
tribulations of the learning process in film making
made him a success amond his college counterparts.
Last Friday night at the Varsity Theater in Palo
Alto, Higgins got his first contact with a mass
audience with a sneak preview of "Harold and
Maude," a film he co-produced and wrote the script
for. If "Opus One" was a humorous caricature of
student films, "Harold and Maude" can best be
described as one of the most outrageous films to
enter commercial theaters in some time.
As Ruth Gordon, who plays Maude, says at one
point in the film, "You live, otherwise you got
nothing to talk about in the locker room."
Paramount Pictures thought the idea was lively
enough to invest a million dollars in its production.
The result is nearly two hours of episodic cinema
telling the story of a love affair between a nineteen
year old boy and a seventy-nine year old woman.
And it's very lively.
Mutual Attraction
Miss Gordon, who may be remembered as one of
the witches in "Rosemary's Baby," plays the wildly
vivacious Maude who falls in love with Harold after
the two meet by coincidence on several
occasions—at funerals. It seems that Harold, who
has a fetish «for death, and Maude, who is
thoroughly in love with life, share a mutual
attraction for funerals. The two manage to make it
to the same funerals, he in his Rolls, she in whatever
she can rip-off. Their attraction develops with
astounding speed, although Harold's personal life
never seems to alter appreciably because of it.
Harold, played by Bud Cort (Brewster McCloud),
delights in committing elaborate fake suicides to
impress his mother. The movie opens with Harold's
mother finding her son hanging by the neck from a
rope strung from the ceiling in the living room. She
says simply, "I suppose you think this is very funny,
Harold." It is just the first of many funnies to
follow.
The film plays on stereotypes to get many of its
laughs. If you get tired of Harold's bizarre suicide
efforts, and there are many, there is a military man
ludicrous enough to make General Ky look like a
pacifist. And there is an insane portrayal of a
Catholic priest who lectures Harold about how
disgusting it would be for the ripe young man to
marry such a relic like Maude. Of course there is a
psychiatrist who looks and acts more insane than
any act Harold could conceive.
None of it is credible and its not meant to be. It
comes as no serious problem then, at the
conclusion of the movie, when Maude, who has
been the stimulus that Harold has needed to live,
decides to throw it all in. There is no logic to such
absurd humor. It is more a question of what is
entertaining, of what will keep the audience
interested. In the last analysis the film relies on
technique, on its visual aspects, to pull it through.
Higgins has created enough sight gags to keep you
going for a couple of hours. And it can be funny.
Bed Scene
Perhaps the only real shock, if it can be called
shocking after all the bizarre goings on which have
preceded it, it the bed scene with Harold and
Maude. Higgins was worried about that and said that
"it's very strange in this society that an eighty year
old man sleeping with a twenty year old woman can
be accepted, but you reverse it and something
happens to people's psyches. Its like incest". That
may be so, but it fits into the film quite smoothly,

and if one has been able to accept what has
happened before, it's difficult to imagine anyone
being upset with this one section.
The film was originally conceived as a fifteen
minute thesis film at UCLA. Higgins decided to
wirte the idea into a feature length script and won a
Samuel Goldwyn writing award for his efforts. He
also sold the idea to Edward Lewis, who was
employing him as a chauffeur and general
handyman at the time. Lewis, you all remember, has
produced such projects as "Spartacus" and more
recently "The Horseman" which was directed by
John Frankenheimer.
It quickly opened some doors for Higgins, a
former undergraduate here in the English
Department, whose only contact with film before
UCLA was in Henry Breitrose's class in Film
Aesthetics. Paramount originally allocated a half a
million dollars to make "Harold and Maude" and
they gave Higgins $7000, a union crew, and a
Columbia sound stage to turn out a short rough to
see how well he could direct it.
Higgins says"it was pathetic. They wouldn't
even give me a fourth wall to work with and I had
to handle the crew and the cutting myself."
New Role
After that experiment Higgins was hired as
scriptwriter and co-producer and Hal Ashby was
brought in to direct. Ashby added considerable
polish to the production, tightening the film up and
teaching Higgins at the same time. Cat Stevens was
recruited to do the score. Higgins influence was still
integrated, but he says that even much of the
location shooting in Palo Alto was someone else's
idea.
In spite of being unable to direct his own work,
Higgins' film points to a growing, thought still
limited number of student film makers who have
been able to break into commercial film on the basis
of work accomplished while still in school. Francis
Ford Coppola submitted "You're A Big Boy Now"
as his masters thesis at UCLA—although it took him
ten years to get to produce the film after he left
school. George Lucas made "THX-1138 -4eb" while
at USC and it was lengthened from the fifteen
minute original version into a full length film done
for Warner Brothers. Paul Kenworthy began "The
Living Desert" as a masters thesis project and
eventually completed it under contract to Walt
Disney Studios.
Even so, there is discontent in the success. The
finshed version of "The Living Desert" was made
into a typical Disney feature which pleased
Kenworthy very little. Coppola, after several battles
with Hollywood producers, quit and started
American Zoetrope in San Francisco, the theory
being that better films could be made in an
atmosphere conducive to more freedom and
independence. He took Lucas with him.
Higgins, speaking of his experience in losing the
direction of "Harold and Maude" has said that, "I
don't like it now and I didn't like it then. But I'll
live with it."
He has already written another script which he
says he won't sell "until I'm set." But he says he
"expects a lot of fights with studios".
Until that time, he is nervously waiting the
reaction to his first major film. The audience at the
Varsity, largely composed of friends and
acquaintances seemed to enjoy this first showing. It
will be fascinating to see how well the film does
elsewhere. If it is successful it may very well be
related to the success of "Opus One." That first film
was successful because it was the most obvious
student film of the series—and it laughed at itself.
"Harold and Maude" has enough action to keep just
about any commercial audience happy. In that sense
it is satirizing itself. The question is simply: is
commercialism enough?

ON LOCATION—Much of the shooting for "Harold and Maude" was done on location in Palo Alto. St
Thomas Aquinas Church (above) was the scene of one of the film's biggest moments—the first meeting of
the strange pair. The film concerns a love affair between al9 year old boy and a 79 year old woman who
meet on several occasions at funerals. Colin Higgins, who co-producaed the movie and wrote the script for
it is a former Stanford English student.
