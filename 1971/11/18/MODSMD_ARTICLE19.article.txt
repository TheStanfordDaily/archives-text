Thai Premier Grabs Power
BANGKOK — Thailand's brief experiment with limited
democracy ended yesterday as Premier Thanom
Kittikachorn dissolved Parliament, suspended the
constitution and assumed absolute power.
Paratroopers moved into Bangkok to buttress regular
police patrols, and tanks encircled the Parliament building.
But despite imposition of martial law and police
checkpoints in the streets, the capital appeared calm.
Regular announcements on Radio Thailand, interspersed
with patriotic songs, said Thanom would lead a
Revolutionary Council with power to decide all civil and
military matters. The Cabinet was disbanded.
The council pledged to continue Thailand's foreign
policy, which has been strongly anti-Communist and
pro-American during the Indochina war. There was no
indication Thanom's assumption of absolute power would
endanger the status of U.S. air bases in Thailand.
McCloskey Redistricted
SACRAMENTO — Republican presidential candidate Paul
N. McCloskey — who first gained political fame by
defeating Shirley Temple Black — could lose his U.S. House
seat in 1972 under a redistricting plan revealed in the
legislature yesterday.
The plan would give McCloskey, 44, the option of
running in either of two congressional districts on the
peninsula south of San Francisco — the 11th in the north
or the 17th to the south — if he should bow out of his
underdog presidential campaign.
McCloskey, a Republican who lives in Portola Valley,
said he will decide what to do after challenging President
Nixon in the March 7 New Hampshire primary.
That will give him just three days to make up his mind.
The deadline for filing for office in California is March 10.
Agnew Blames Press
BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. - Spiro Agnew says certain
commentators on television and in newspapers are
responsible for touching off a wide letter-writing effort to
oust him from his job as vice president.
Agnew said 2 days ago he was "quite amused at
statements that come from the pundits on the tube and in
the newspapers about my efforts to intimidate them."
The reverse is true, he said, "when one considers the

tremendous number of letters that have been written in an
effort to persuade me to relinquish the vice presidency or
persuade the President to have me relinquish it."
This, Agnew said, is evidence that the intimidation
actually comes from "certain pundits of one point of view
towards me in an effort to eliminate me as a spokesman for
the people I represent in this country."
He didn't elaborate.
Labor Stays On Pay Board
MIAMI BEACH, Fla. Top AFL-CIO leaders decided
privately yesterday to stay on President Nixon's Pay Board
despite what they called efforts by industry and public
members to harass them into quitting and blame them for
any failure of new wage controls, it was learned.
"There is no such thing as us walking off the board,"
said a source who took part in the closed meeting of the big
labor federation's powerful executive council. That panel
made the "consensus" decision to remain on the board and
fight its rulings from within.
"It's better to participate on the Pay Board rather than
be on the outside looking in," the source said about the
decision that will be presented formally to the AFL-CIO
convention today.
The 15-man Pay Board has five members each from
labor, industry and the public.
Nixon Signs Military Bill
WASHINGTON — Accusing Congress of hindering his
search for a negotiated settlement, President Nixon signed
yesterday a $21.3-billion military-procurement bill but
brushed aside a provision calling for a deadline for U.S.
withdrawal from Indochina.
His action was challenged quickly by antiwar senators
who plan to seek a fund cutoff to force presidential
acceptance of the amendment.
Even as Nixon declared he would not be bound by the
procurement bill's withdrawal clause, the House headed for
a vote on a move by Rep. Edward P. Boland, D-Mass., to
cut off all U.S. war money next June 1.
Nixon strongly opposes the Boland amendment, just as
he fought the amendment sponsored by Senate Democratic
Leader Mike Mansfield of Montana which was tacked on
the procurement bill.
The Mansfield amendment "is without binding force or
effect," Nixon said.

a vote on a move by Rep. Edward P. Boland, D-Mass., to
cut off all U.S. war money next June 1.
Nixon strongly opposes the Boland amendment, just as
he fought the amendment sponsored by Senate Democratic
Leader Mike Mansfield of Montana which was tacked on
the procurement bill.
The Mansfield amendment "is without binding force or
effect," Nixon said.
Thai Premier Grabs Power
BANGKOK — Thailand's brief experiment with limited
democracy ended yesterday as Premier Thanom
Kittikachorn dissolved Parliament, suspended the
constitution and assumed absolute power.
Paratroopers moved into Bangkok to buttress regular
police patrols, and tanks encircled the Parliament building.
But despite imposition of martial law and police
checkpoints in the streets, the capital appeared calm.
Regular announcements on Radio Thailand, interspersed
with patriotic songs, said Thanom would lead a
Revolutionary Council with power to decide all civil and
military matters. The Cabinet was disbanded.
The council pledged to continue Thailand's foreign
policy, which has been strongly anti-Communist and
pro-American during the Indochina war. There was no
indication Thanom's assumption of absolute power would
endanger the status of U.S. air bases in Thailand.
McCloskey Redistricted
SACRAMENTO — Republican presidential candidate Paul
N. McCloskey — who first gained political fame by
defeating Shirley Temple Black — could lose his U.S. House
seat in 1972 under a redistricting plan revealed in the
legislature yesterday.
The plan would give McCloskey, 44, the option of
running in either of two congressional districts on the
peninsula south of San Francisco — the 11th in the north
or the 17th to the south — if he should bow out of his
underdog presidential campaign.
McCloskey, a Republican who lives in Portola Valley,
said he will decide what to do after challenging President
Nixon in the March 7 New Hampshire primary.
That will give him just three days to make up his mind.
The deadline for filing for office in California is March 10.
Agnew Blames Press
BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. - Spiro Agnew says certain
commentators on television and in newspapers are
responsible for touching off a wide letter-writing effort to
oust him from his job as vice president.
Agnew said 2 days ago he was "quite amused at
statements that come from the pundits on the tube and in
the newspapers about my efforts to intimidate them."
The reverse is true, he said, "when one considers the

tremendous number of letters that have been written in an
effort to persuade me to relinquish the vice presidency or
persuade the President to have me relinquish it."
This, Agnew said, is evidence that the intimidation
actually comes from "certain pundits of one point of view
towards me in an effort to eliminate me as a spokesman for
the people I represent in this country."
He didn't elaborate.
Labor Stays On Pay Board
MIAMI BEACH, Fla. Top AFL-CIO leaders decided
privately yesterday to stay on President Nixon's Pay Board
despite what they called efforts by industry and public
members to harass them into quitting and blame them for
any failure of new wage controls, it was learned.
"There is no such thing as us walking off the board,"
said a source who took part in the closed meeting of the big
labor federation's powerful executive council. That panel
made the "consensus" decision to remain on the board and
fight its rulings from within.
"It's better to participate on the Pay Board rather than
be on the outside looking in," the source said about the
decision that will be presented formally to the AFL-CIO
convention today.
The 15-man Pay Board has five members each from
labor, industry and the public.
Nixon Signs Military Bill
WASHINGTON — Accusing Congress of hindering his
search for a negotiated settlement, President Nixon signed
yesterday a $21.3-billion military-procurement bill but
brushed aside a provision calling for a deadline for U.S.
withdrawal from Indochina.
His action was challenged quickly by antiwar senators
who plan to seek a fund cutoff to force presidential
acceptance of the amendment.
Even as Nixon declared he would not be bound by the
procurement bill's withdrawal clause, the House headed for
a vote on a move by Rep. Edward P. Boland, D-Mass., to
cut off all U.S. war money next June 1.
Nixon strongly opposes the Boland amendment, just as
