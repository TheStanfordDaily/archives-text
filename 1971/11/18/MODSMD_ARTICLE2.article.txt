# In Monterey Bay
## SWOPSI Report Probes Water Pollution 
### GARY CLARK 
The pollution problem in Monterey
Bay has grown so acute that the bay
may become a "dead lake" within a
few years according to a report issued
by SWOPSI and the Environmental
Research Project.
Three Stanford students co-authored
the report, spending almost two years
preparing the study. Background
research included interviewing
Monterey Bay area politicians, health
authorities, and sanitation officials. The
project was funded through a National
Science Foundation grant.
The report says the pollution
problem is two-fold. First, the natural
conditions in the Bay aggravate the
ecological pressures of sewage dumping.
On shore, the report adds, a quilt-work
of conflicting jurisdictions, 'financial
problems, and varying degrees of

concern by public officials hamper
effects to correct this.
Monterey Bay, the report says, is
like a lake in the ocean. Due to current
patterns in the bay, there is little
intermixing of Bay water with the
current flow down the coast or off the
continental shelf.
Sewage Trapped
The effect of these currents is to
"trap" sewage and pollutants in the
Bay rather than allow them to disperse.
The pollution was so great at one time
that Monterey and some of the
surrounding communities were forced
to close several beaches because of the
health hazard.
The report, however, 112 cused mainly
on the politics behind the pollution
problem. Co-author Dan Green, an
undergraduate, said, "we tried to
approach the problem without bias, but

the results are biased in the sense that
we assign guilt to various parties. It is
hard to remain unbiased when you see
animal entrails floating down the river
in Santa Cruz, and you know that there
is only one possible source for that
garbage."
"For the most part," Green said, "it
was surprising how cooperative the
various officials we dealt with were.
Often, they would volunteer
information that was not particularly
favorable about conditions under their
jurisdiction."
Undergraduate Adrian Arima and
Medical School student Joseph Welch
were also co-authors of the report.
Local officials, however, can only
take limited action, and only when
pollution levels represent an immediate
danger to health, the report states. It
adds that jurisdiction beyond these
emergency situations lies with federal,
state, and regional control bodies. For
various reasons, most of them
budgetary, these agencies are not up to
the task.
Some Action
Some cities on the bay have
recognized the problem and have taken
measures to correct their own
contributions to it, the report says. It
points out that the cities of Monterey
and Marina, as well as Fort Ord, have
secondary treatment that involves
breaking down the raw sewage into
basic chemical components.
But the report adds that it is mainly
the economic dependence of the region
on tourism, and not altruism, that is
motivating public officials to take
action.
Other cities, notably Carmel and
Santa Cruz, have only primary
treatment facilities, the report says.
The problem, according to Green, is
that questions of method of treatment
are compounded by the sheer volume
of sewage to be treated and disposed
of.
"At present, over 30 million gallons
a day (mgd) of domestic sewage Â§re
pumped into Monterey Bay . .. Sewage
effluents within the next ten years
could increase four-fold to as much as
120 mgd."
Individual towns usually cannot
afford the cost of modern sewage
treatment facilities and the authors see
effective action only through the
creation of unified sewage treatment
districts and obtaining federal or state
grants for such a plan.
Delta Program
The proposed San Francisco
Bay-Delta Ptogram, which would
collect all sewage from the San
Francisco Bay area and pipe it to an
outfall north of Monterey Bay, presents
both a threat and a model for pollution
control for the entire area. While the
Bay-Delta program calls only for
primary treatment of sewage, thus

causing pollution problems, its
centralized treatment facilities should
provide a model for a Monterey Bay
project similar to it.
Green pointed out it is ultimately
much cheaper to build, expand, and
update one large treatment facility than
many small ones.
Beyond unification of treatment
facilities and pollution control districts,
Green sees two goals for effective
action in curbing the pollution. One of
the greatest steps would be taken, he
said, if all sewage received secondary
treatment. Ultimately, however, any
comprehensive control program would
have to develop tertiary treatment for
most of the sewage.
Tertiary treatment makes sewage
water ready for re-use or for
replenishing ground water sources. It is
an efficient method of recycling
resources and all but eliminates the
problems of sewage pollution since
none is discharged into the ocean.
So far there has been no strong
reaction to the report. Green sees the
primary value of the report in the
research that went into it and the fact
that it collects vital facts from diverse
sources. By providing both the people
and public officials with necessary
information, he hopes they will feel
compelled to take effective action.
