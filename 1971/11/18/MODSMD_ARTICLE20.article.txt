# War's Medical Problems Remain
## 
### JAMES E. LOBSENZ 
Dr. Mark Gorney of the Medical
School's Clinical Staff, spoke yesterday
on his recent experiences at the Saigon
Children's Hospital in Vietnam, whose
yearly budget of $200,000 he bitterly
equated to "two hours worth of war."
He contends that although the war
may be winding down for the American
soldier, it is not winding down for the
people of Vietnam, and that Americans
cannot pretend that it is. The plight of
civilian war victims is statistically as
bad now as it was during "the height of
the war," when American military
involvement was at its fiercest point,
Dr. Gorney claimed.
Gorney, a nationally eminent plastic
surgeon, was accompanied by Dr.
Richard Bacon of the Berkeley Medical
School.
The most impressive aspects of the
talk were visual. Comments centered
around the slides shown, and at times
talk became completely unnecessary
because of the vivid nature of the
pictures.
Dr. Gorney warned his audience of
the painful and unpleasant nature of his
talk, and explained that he had decided
to include rather gruesome slides of his
patients not solely in order to shock
them, but to combat the growing
feeling that says,"I don't want to hear
about it [the war] anymore."
Dr. Gorney became involved in
treating child war victims through the
Committee of Responsibility, a
organization similar to the Children's
Medical Relief International, that
brings war victims to this country for
extensive surgical treatment not
available in Vietnam.
Dr. Gorney was asked by the
Committee to treat a young girl who
had had her lips shot off by an M-l
bullet. He explained that the
experience inspired him to tackle the
problem in a different way—by going to
Vietnam rather than by bringing the
injured to the U.S. He said when the
girl left to return to Vietnam he felt he
was "throwing her back on the garbage
pile."

He emphasized that "if you're going
to do something about it you've got to
go there."
Dr. Gorney then explained the
special nature of reconstructive surgery,
and especially that of facial plastic
surgery. He describes the injuries he
encounters as "three-dimensional
wounds" that are "psychic as well as
physical. The face is the mirror of the
soul," and it is the one part of the body
that a person "can't hide beneath his
clothes."
Also stressed was the fact that the
hospital has a twofold purpose: first, to
create an alternative for the injured
other than "to die or to become a living
scar." And second, to train the
Vietnamese to be able to take care of
themselves.
The hospital residency program is
designed to train Vietnamese doctors to
eventually take over the entire
administration of the hospital.
Not all of the patients treated have
directly war-related injuries. Dr. Bacon
spoke of the tremendous increase in
cases of severe burns received in
domestic situations. He traced the
problem to the widespread use of black
market aviation fuel in homes.
Kerosene and gasoline is scarce, so the
highly explosive substitute is used
instead.
Dr. Gorney also commented on the

increase in congenital defects. The
reasons for this are unclear. Dr. Bacon's
hypothesis is that they are directly
related to poor diets of the people and
to the extensive use of pesticides for
defoliation.
Dr. Gorney elaborated on the
typical "hellhole hospitals which smell
of death and carboxylic acid," where
relatives must come and feed the
patients or leave them to starve. He also
spoke of the crowding which results in
the "semi-private bed" situation, where
three or four people with different
diseases must share the same bed. One
public hospital he mentioned claimed
240 beds and 360 patients.
The Children's Hospital, which is
supported by AID and the Children's
Medical Relief Internatinal, offers free
medical treatment to injured children
of all ages. The hospital makes no
distinction between the nationality of
the injured. It was founded by Dr.
Arthur J. Barsky in 1968. Dr. Barsky
has previously worked in Japan aiding
the victims of the Hiroshima and
Nagasaki bombings.
Dr. Gorney admitted that the total
number of cases they can treat is but a
drop in the bucket but quoted the
hospital's motto: "Better to light a
candle than to curse the darkness." He
spoke of the inadequate facilities for
treating burn cases, however, though a
special burn unit is being planned.

pictures.
Dr. Gorney warned his audience of
the painful and unpleasant nature of his
talk, and explained that he had decided
to include rather gruesome slides of his
patients not solely in order to shock
them, but to combat the growing
feeling that says,"I don't want to hear
about it [the war] anymore."
Dr. Gorney became involved in
treating child war victims through the
Committee of Responsibility, a
organization similar to the Children's
Medical Relief International, that
brings war victims to this country for
extensive surgical treatment not
available in Vietnam.
Dr. Gorney was asked by the
Committee to treat a young girl who
had had her lips shot off by an M-l
bullet. He explained that the
experience inspired him to tackle the
problem in a different way—by going to
Vietnam rather than by bringing the
injured to the U.S. He said when the
girl left to return to Vietnam he felt he
was "throwing her back on the garbage
pile."

He emphasized that "if you're going
to do something about it you've got to
go there."
Dr. Gorney then explained the
special nature of reconstructive surgery,
and especially that of facial plastic
surgery. He describes the injuries he
encounters as "three-dimensional
wounds" that are "psychic as well as
physical. The face is the mirror of the
soul," and it is the one part of the body
that a person "can't hide beneath his
clothes."
Also stressed was the fact that the
hospital has a twofold purpose: first, to
create an alternative for the injured
other than "to die or to become a living
scar." And second, to train the
Vietnamese to be able to take care of
themselves.
The hospital residency program is
designed to train Vietnamese doctors to
eventually take over the entire
administration of the hospital.
Not all of the patients treated have
directly war-related injuries. Dr. Bacon
spoke of the tremendous increase in
cases of severe burns received in
domestic situations. He traced the
problem to the widespread use of black
market aviation fuel in homes.
Kerosene and gasoline is scarce, so the
highly explosive substitute is used
instead.
Dr. Gorney also commented on the

increase in congenital defects. The
reasons for this are unclear. Dr. Bacon's
hypothesis is that they are directly
related to poor diets of the people and
to the extensive use of pesticides for
defoliation.
Dr. Gorney elaborated on the
typical "hellhole hospitals which smell
of death and carboxylic acid," where
relatives must come and feed the
patients or leave them to starve. He also
spoke of the crowding which results in
the "semi-private bed" situation, where
three or four people with different
diseases must share the same bed. One
public hospital he mentioned claimed
240 beds and 360 patients.
The Children's Hospital, which is
supported by AID and the Children's
Medical Relief Internatinal, offers free
medical treatment to injured children
of all ages. The hospital makes no
distinction between the nationality of
the injured. It was founded by Dr.
Arthur J. Barsky in 1968. Dr. Barsky
has previously worked in Japan aiding
the victims of the Hiroshima and
Nagasaki bombings.
Dr. Gorney admitted that the total
number of cases they can treat is but a
drop in the bucket but quoted the
hospital's motto: "Better to light a
candle than to curse the darkness." He
spoke of the inadequate facilities for
treating burn cases, however, though a
special burn unit is being planned.
Dr. Mark Gorney of the Medical
School's Clinical Staff, spoke yesterday
on his recent experiences at the Saigon
Children's Hospital in Vietnam, whose
yearly budget of $200,000 he bitterly
equated to "two hours worth of war."
He contends that although the war
may be winding down for the American
soldier, it is not winding down for the
people of Vietnam, and that Americans
cannot pretend that it is. The plight of
civilian war victims is statistically as
bad now as it was during "the height of
the war," when American military
involvement was at its fiercest point,
Dr. Gorney claimed.
Gorney, a nationally eminent plastic
surgeon, was accompanied by Dr.
Richard Bacon of the Berkeley Medical
School.
The most impressive aspects of the
talk were visual. Comments centered
around the slides shown, and at times
talk became completely unnecessary
because of the vivid nature of the
pictures.
