# Young Crows Present 'Red Hot Professor' Awards

### ROBERT BACON 
The Association of Young Crows presented awards to the
six winners of its "Red Hot Professor Contest" yesterday, and
held discussions with top vote-getters in the satirical
popularity poll on defense research contracts.
About thirty members and supporters of the organization
which seeks to expose war-related research at Stanford, were
led by Lenny Siegel of the Pacific Studies Center on a tour to
the offices of the winners yesterday afternoon, after the
winners were announced at White Plaza noon rally.
Psychology Professor Philip Zimbardo won first place for
his study of rebellion in total institutional environments. His
prizes were a goldfish bowl "for his research subjects" and a
carrot-on-a-stick "for motivating people." Zimbardo is on
leave and did not meet with the Young Crows.
Long-Term Service
A "special award for long-term service" was given to
William R. Rambo, Director of the Stanford Electronics
Laboratories. Protestors presented the award, a bottle of Old
Crow bourbon, to his secretary. Rambo is on sabbatical leave.
The fourth-place winner, Electrical Engineering Professor
James D. Meindl, who studies miniaturized electronic circuits,
defended his work in a 30-minute discussion outside the
McCullough Building.
According to the "Crows," the Defense Department

intends to use Meindl's results to develop communication
equipment for soldiers in the field. Meindl stressed that 90 to
95 percent of his funding comes from the National Institutes
of Health and the most important applications of the research
are medical.
Fifth place winner Richard Pantell, also on the Electrical
Engineering faculty, appeared at the White Plaza rally to
discuss his work with lasers. He stressed his long-time
opposition to the Vietnam war and his personal opposition to
doing classified military research. "You would be hard pressed
to find any research contract here at Stanford that is less
amenable to war-related applications than mine," Pantell said.
The second place winner was Electrical Engineering
Professor William Spicer, for a project involving night vision.
He received a bunch of carrots, which was presented to his
secretary.
Arthur E. Bryson, Jr., Chairman of the Department of
Aeronautics and Astronautics, received third place for his
work with helicopters. The protesters left at his office a
pop-gun, which they called a "Vietnajnese anti-helicopter
weapon," and an apple. The "Crows" pointed out that "Eve
lost some of her innocence when she ate an apple; Bryson
might, too."
Civilian Applications
Meindl stressed that "civilian applications far outweigh in
number and value any uses that the Department of Defense

will ever make of my research." He noted that its applications
include implanted heart pacemakers and blood flow meters
which have saved the lives of many persons with heart disease,
and also pointed out that its military applications "may be
helpful in saving lives by keeping us militarily strong and
thereby preventing war."
Geraldine Foote asked Meindl "what classes of people get
heart pacemakers and implanted blood flow meters?" Meindl
did not answer the question.
His award was a tin-can-and-string telephone set, to
symbolize the communications apparatus that is the defense
application of his research.
Pantell, in his White Plaza remarks, said he thought two
things "unfortunate; first, that the Defense Department was
required to invent a military rationale for my project, and
second, that the Young Crows' writeup of my project was, I
think, intentionally misleading.
"I took the SWOPSI report (on defense research contracts
at Stanford) to be very useful; I'm sorry the Young Crows
don't have a similar balance."
He said the military applications of his work were
"essentially nil," and described the Defense Department's
statement of military applications of his research, reprinted in
the SWOPSI report, as a "non sequiteur ... I don't know what
motivates the DOD."
His work involves ultra-violet lasers. The "Crows"
presented him with a "portable anti-laser device," a mirror, to

which he responded, "I'll keep this as a symbol of the
confusion that can arise over these issues."
Old Crows
The Young Crows' name is taken from the "Association of
Old Crows," an organization "dedicated to the advancement
of the art of electronic warfare." Rambo is a member of that
organization; hence the Old Crow liquor.
Siegel said the award was being presented to Rambo "in the
spirit that his work will not continue."
Before announcing the award winners, Siegel told the White
Plaza crowd of about 100 that "research is just the tip of the
iceberg in Stanford support of the Department of Defense "
He mentioned the military contractors leasing land in the
Stanford Industrial Park, the consulting done by Engineering
professors with such firms, recruitment by such firms at the
placement center, Stanford's investments in stocks and bonds,
and the corporate affiliations of Stanford trustees.
Zimbardo, who attracted national attention last August for
his research into prison rebellions, is studying at the Center for
Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences in the foothills this
year, and a note on his Jordan Hall office door yesterday said
that "he would be glad to talk to any Young Crows up there,
anytime."
Siegel told the tour group that "Zimbardo says he isn't
doing what DOD wants him to ... he likes to remind people
of his anti-war efforts." Zimbardo was a leader of anti-war
activities at Stanford in the spring of 1970.
