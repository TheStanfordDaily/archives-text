# Lyman Airs Faculty Concern Over Tenure
## 
### 
Many junior faculty here are
beginning to worry about their
possibilities of receiving tenure,
President Richard Lyman told a group
of alumni Tuesday night.
"There is sharp worry among our
current junior faculty, who can see the
handwriting on the wall, and who do
not see how we can avoid extruding
many of them from the University
when the six-year probationary period
is up," Lyman told the Stanford
Associates in San Francisco.
The problem, he explained, came
during the early 60's when Stanford
greatly expanded its faculty and often
raided other universities by offering
tenure to a large number of faculty.
The result, he said, is that "among the
leading universities, we may well have
the highest ratio of tenured to
non-tenured faculty."
"As long as the faculty was growing
steadily in size, this still allowed us to
maintain a good and necessary influx
also of bright, younger people, fresh
from their Ph.D.'s," he said.
Now, the faculty is not growing,
there is a high ratio of tenured faculty
and few are retiring each year, he said.
The result: few young faculty members
can be given tenure each year.
Lyman noted that not only young
faculty are concerned, but also senior
faculty, "who do not want to preside
over a massacre of the innocents, but
do not want to promote so many to
tenure that there is no room in the
lower decks of the Ark for fresh young
minds."

Lyman said that although the
problem of either giving professor
tenure or not after being here for ten
years "may seem harsh ... but at the
very least it focuses the maximum
amount of attention upon the critical
question of the faculty member's
capability."
He noted that some people have
proposed substituting a system of
five-year renewable appointments
instead of permanent tenure. He fears,
however, that under such a system "the
temptation would be terribly strong to
avoid hard choices in borderline cases,"
or to keep someone for the good of his
family.
To work out of the problem of a
lack of young faculty, Lyman said
Stanford is considering ways of
providing for early retirement, though
he is concerned about the monetary
problems inherent in any such
situation.
In addition, the University is
considering anticipating some
retirements and providing replacements
before the positions become vacant.
In his speech, Lyman defended the
faculty of the nation's universities,
noting "that we are once again in a
period in which many Americans feel a
kind of ambivalence, almost a love-hate
relationship to university faculty
members." He also noted the growing
attacks upon professors for what many
people consider light teaching loads. He
defended teaching loads, explaining the
time a professor spends in preparing his
classes, informally advising and
teaching, and conducting research.
