# Grant To Aid Funding Of Business Program
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
A half-million dollar grant from the
Alfred P. Sloan Foundation will act as
seed money for a new urban
management program in the Graduate
School of Business, Dean Arjay Miller
announced yesterday.
The $550,000 grant is about half of
what the program will cost over the
next five years. "With the interest and
support so far, I'm optimistic we'll get
the rest of the money," Miller said.
"We'll definately get it launched with
this grant."
A news release from Herb Blanchett,
Business School publicity man, called
the program "a first-of-a-kind" and
Miller agrees that he knows of no other
program "quite comparable ... where
business and government are growing
together, where the private sector is
moving into the public domain."
Miller called the program itself
"exciting."
Need Money
"In order to solve urban problems
you've got to have money," he said.
"That will probably come from
increased public allocations. Then you
must have managed programs in health,
public housing, sanitation, law
enforcement, and so on.
"Thirdly, you must have properly
trained people to operate the
programs." That is where the urban
management training comes in, to
implement "our belief that the skills
used so successfully in modern business
management can be applied with equal
effectiveness in attacking complex
problems of the city," Miller said.
The urban management option will
operate within the framework of the
two-year master of Business
Administration program.
The curriculum will require the same
core classes now taught in the School,
but the emphasis will be on applying
business techniques to problems of city
government. In addition to the regular
courses, the program will offer paid
summer internships in city government;
a year long workshop that will

coordinate internship experience,
course work, and bring in outside
experts to talk to the students; and new
electives and related processes—urban
economics, urban political processes,
and so on.
Case Studies
The program will also feature
extensive first-year study of urban
issues through case studies of local
political units like city councils and
school boards.
The program, which already has 19
students, will accept another 21 next
year to operate with a full quota of 40.
"We went ahead and accepted
students into the School," said Miller,
explaining why students were already
enrolled in a program that just received
funding yesterday,"and then we said:
'We have this urban management
option, would you like to sign up?"
"From now on, though, it will be in
the catalog and it will be a part of our
recruiting program. The dean of
admissions will start using it as an
enticement to enroll with us," Miller
continued.
Urban Institute
"Part of the input we expect to get
in this workshop will come from the
Urban Institute," Miller said. "It's a
Washington-based think tank that has
done extensive study of urban
problems, but has never gone into
training of urban experts."
The foundation also provided a
$75,000 planning grant last year, and a
faculty group headed by Organizational
Behavior Professor Eugene J. Webb
worked all year on the framework of
the program. They submitted a final
plan in June, and approval at last came
yesterday.

business techniques to problems of city
government. In addition to the regular
courses, the program will offer paid
summer internships in city government;
a year long workshop that will

coordinate internship experience,
course work, and bring in outside
experts to talk to the students; and new
electives and related processes—urban
economics, urban political processes,
and so on.
Case Studies
The program will also feature
extensive first-year study of urban
issues through case studies of local
political units like city councils and
school boards.
The program, which already has 19
students, will accept another 21 next
year to operate with a full quota of 40.
"We went ahead and accepted
students into the School," said Miller,
explaining why students were already
enrolled in a program that just received
funding yesterday,"and then we said:
'We have this urban management
option, would you like to sign up?"
"From now on, though, it will be in
the catalog and it will be a part of our
recruiting program. The dean of
admissions will start using it as an
enticement to enroll with us," Miller
continued.
Urban Institute
"Part of the input we expect to get
in this workshop will come from the
Urban Institute," Miller said. "It's a
Washington-based think tank that has
done extensive study of urban
problems, but has never gone into
training of urban experts."
The foundation also provided a
$75,000 planning grant last year, and a
faculty group headed by Organizational
Behavior Professor Eugene J. Webb
worked all year on the framework of
the program. They submitted a final
plan in June, and approval at last came
yesterday.


SPEAK!—California Senator Alan Cranston (above) will be one of several speakers
at a "Dump Nixon" rally to be held tonight at 8:30 p.m. in Mem Aud. Also
scheduled as speakers are Congressman Pete McCloskey, former New York
Congressman Allard Lowenstein and John Kerry, a spokesman for Vietnam
Veterans Against the War. SeveraJ other Bay Area figures will speak on ways of
defeating President Nixon in 197 2. Entertainment by John Kay and Bill Withers
begins at 7:4 5 p.m.
A half-million dollar grant from the
Alfred P. Sloan Foundation will act as
seed money for a new urban
management program in the Graduate
School of Business, Dean Arjay Miller
announced yesterday.
The $550,000 grant is about half of
what the program will cost over the
next five years. "With the interest and
support so far, I'm optimistic we'll get
the rest of the money," Miller said.
"We'll definately get it launched with
this grant."
A news release from Herb Blanchett,
Business School publicity man, called
the program "a first-of-a-kind" and
Miller agrees that he knows of no other
program "quite comparable ... where
business and government are growing
together, where the private sector is
moving into the public domain."
Miller called the program itself
"exciting."
Need Money
"In order to solve urban problems
you've got to have money," he said.
"That will probably come from
increased public allocations. Then you
must have managed programs in health,
public housing, sanitation, law
enforcement, and so on.
"Thirdly, you must have properly
trained people to operate the
programs." That is where the urban
management training comes in, to
implement "our belief that the skills
used so successfully in modern business
management can be applied with equal
effectiveness in attacking complex
problems of the city," Miller said.
The urban management option will
operate within the framework of the
two-year master of Business
Administration program.
The curriculum will require the same
core classes now taught in the School,
but the emphasis will be on applying
business techniques to problems of city
government. In addition to the regular
courses, the program will offer paid
summer internships in city government;
a year long workshop that will

coordinate internship experience,
