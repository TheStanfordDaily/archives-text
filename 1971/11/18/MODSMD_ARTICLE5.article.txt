# Protest Aimed At Viet Judges
## 
### 
Three South Vietnamese judges are
scheduled to visit campus today and
the Third World Liberation Front
(TWLF) and other radical groups have
said they will attempt to "deny access
and use" of Stanford facilities to the
justices.
Kwonping Ho, a student and TWLF
member, claimed last night that the
three justices were directly responsible
for the "election rig" in South
Vietnam, "the 400,000 political
prisoners" there, the alleged "tiger
cages," and that the three "are directly
contributing to the killing in Vietnam."
TWLF and other groups have called
a noon White Plaza rally to discuss
what organizers termed "war
atrocities." Ho indicated that the
groups would then try to "physically"
prevent the three justices from having
lunch at the faculty club at 12:30,
meeting with several people in the law
school at 1:30 and then at 2:30 prevent
scheduled visit by the three to the East
Asian Collection at the Hoover
Institution.
The visit was initiated by the State
Department and organized through the
Foreign Visitors Office, according to
Barbara Given, director of that office.
The three justices are scheduled to
meet with Joseph E. Leininger,
associate dean of the law school and
several others at the law school.
Given noted that visits of foreigners
sponsored by the State Department is
not unusual and that her office
followed normal procedure in arranging
the visit. She knew of no special reason
why they chose to visit Stanford.
