The recent letter from Bill
Evers and Herb Borock regarding
the organizing for the Emergency
Conference of New Voters tonight
has made a number of charges
that deserve an answer from me.
The first charge is that a
University office—namely the
ASSU office (care of me) was

(OVHCikmhs

used as a return address for a
fundraising appeal for political
purposes. For the most part, this
charge is correct. My office and
name was listed as the return
address in a letter inviting
individuals in the community to a
fund-raising cocktail party in Los
Altos.
The party is being held to raise
money to help pay for the
Emergency Conference—for the
advance leaflets and advertising,
for the travel expenses of the
speakers, and for the costs of the
rally itself. In that sense, the
fundraising appeal was no more
political than the rally itself; and
the rally itself is being organized
more as an educational conference
(on voter registration and delegate
selection processes) than as
anything blatantly political.
But whether the fundraising
appeal return address is illegal
under President Lyman's policy is
irrelevant as far as I am
concerned. In any case, it is
wrong. It is wrong because I don't
believe the ASSU office should be
the return address for any
fundraising for a non-campus
organization, however worthy.
The use of this return address
and my name was done without
my knowledge. Had I known
about it I would not have allowed
it. On discovering it, I ordered the
return address changed to my
personal post office box for all
future communications and
forwarding mail.
A second major charge of Evers
and Borock is that University
office space and University
extensions were being used for the
organizing of this rally. This is
also true, but it is a very gray
matter as to whether such use
constitutes a violation of
President Lyman's policy or
places our tax exempt status in
jeopardy.
Again I would emphasize that
ths is not a political rally in the
sense that the tax laws are
concerned with. As far as this
rally is political, it is concerned
with issues: namely, ending the
war in Vietnam, and opening up
the political processes of all
parties to fair representation by
women, young people, and

minorities.
This rally is NOT advocating or
supporting any candidate or
party. It is nonpartisan:
Independents, Republicans,
Democrats, and a Peace and
Freedom representative have all
been invited to speak. The charge
that this is a "Youth for

McCloskey" conference is simply
inconsistent with the facts. The
majority of the people organizing
this rally do not support Pete
McCloskey, or any other
candidate, for President.
So we return to the question of
what is "political" and what is
not. Because it is non-partisan,
because it is not supporting or
opposing officially any political
candidate, and because there is an
educational and public service
aspect to it, I do not believe this
rally can be defined as "political"
in the way that the regulations in
question mean that term to be
defined.
Still, we are left with two
problems. First, anytime
organizing related in any way to
state and national elections is
conducted in tax-exempt
University office space with
University phones, this issue may
be raised. It isn't worth the
trouble and confusion. Tuesday
morning the Council of Presidents
met with University attorneys Jim
Siena and George Gregory and
Assistant Provost Sally Mahoney.
We all agreed that all such future
organizing will be carried on in
office space rented from the
University (negotiations to begin
soon) which will not endanger its
tax-exempt status.
As for the present problem of
the rally organizers continuing to
use the ASSU office, the Council
of Presidents met with them
Tuesday afternoon and asked
them to cease the use of our
office within 24 hours. As of 5:00
p.m. yesterday, the Register for
Peace interns were no longer using
ASSU phones or office space to
organize the rally.
This action was taken not
because we regard their organizing
as in violation of Federal or
University rules, but because the
interns have been careless and
indiscrete in how they have used
my name and our offices, and, in
view of the present controversy
and the agreement made with Mr.
Siena on Tuesday, we decided
that the use of our offices and
phones was no longer appropriate.
I would hope that the Register
for Peace Interns are not unfairly
characterized in this controversy.

They are committed more deeply
and passionately to the issues that
challenge us than most of the
students on this—or any
other-campus. They have
incurred no expenses for the
ASSU in terms of long distance
phone calls or mimeograph or
xerox costs. They have worked on
this rally at great personal
sacrifice. When they have gotten
around to telling me what they
were doing, they have always been
honest and open.
Their mistake has not been
dishonesty or deception, but
rather, serious carelessness. And
their mistake has been my mistake
as well for not having watched
their activities more closely.

The party is being held to raise
money to help pay for the
Emergency Conference—for the
advance leaflets and advertising,
for the travel expenses of the
speakers, and for the costs of the
rally itself. In that sense, the
fundraising appeal was no more
political than the rally itself; and
the rally itself is being organized
more as an educational conference
(on voter registration and delegate
selection processes) than as
anything blatantly political.
But whether the fundraising
appeal return address is illegal
under President Lyman's policy is
irrelevant as far as I am
concerned. In any case, it is
wrong. It is wrong because I don't
believe the ASSU office should be
the return address for any
fundraising for a non-campus
organization, however worthy.
The use of this return address
and my name was done without
my knowledge. Had I known
about it I would not have allowed
it. On discovering it, I ordered the
return address changed to my
personal post office box for all
future communications and
forwarding mail.
A second major charge of Evers
and Borock is that University
office space and University
extensions were being used for the
organizing of this rally. This is
also true, but it is a very gray
matter as to whether such use
constitutes a violation of
President Lyman's policy or
places our tax exempt status in
jeopardy.
Again I would emphasize that
ths is not a political rally in the
sense that the tax laws are
concerned with. As far as this
rally is political, it is concerned
with issues: namely, ending the
war in Vietnam, and opening up
the political processes of all
parties to fair representation by
women, young people, and

minorities.
This rally is NOT advocating or
supporting any candidate or
party. It is nonpartisan:
Independents, Republicans,
Democrats, and a Peace and
Freedom representative have all
been invited to speak. The charge
that this is a "Youth for

McCloskey" conference is simply
inconsistent with the facts. The
majority of the people organizing
this rally do not support Pete
McCloskey, or any other
candidate, for President.
So we return to the question of
what is "political" and what is
not. Because it is non-partisan,
because it is not supporting or
opposing officially any political
candidate, and because there is an
educational and public service
aspect to it, I do not believe this
rally can be defined as "political"
in the way that the regulations in
question mean that term to be
defined.
Still, we are left with two
problems. First, anytime
organizing related in any way to
state and national elections is
conducted in tax-exempt
University office space with
University phones, this issue may
be raised. It isn't worth the
trouble and confusion. Tuesday
morning the Council of Presidents
met with University attorneys Jim
Siena and George Gregory and
Assistant Provost Sally Mahoney.
We all agreed that all such future
organizing will be carried on in
office space rented from the
University (negotiations to begin
soon) which will not endanger its
tax-exempt status.
As for the present problem of
the rally organizers continuing to
use the ASSU office, the Council
of Presidents met with them
Tuesday afternoon and asked
them to cease the use of our
office within 24 hours. As of 5:00
p.m. yesterday, the Register for
Peace interns were no longer using
ASSU phones or office space to
organize the rally.
This action was taken not
because we regard their organizing
as in violation of Federal or
University rules, but because the
interns have been careless and
indiscrete in how they have used
my name and our offices, and, in
view of the present controversy
and the agreement made with Mr.
Siena on Tuesday, we decided
that the use of our offices and
phones was no longer appropriate.
I would hope that the Register
for Peace Interns are not unfairly
characterized in this controversy.

They are committed more deeply
and passionately to the issues that
challenge us than most of the
students on this—or any
other-campus. They have
incurred no expenses for the
ASSU in terms of long distance
phone calls or mimeograph or
xerox costs. They have worked on
this rally at great personal
sacrifice. When they have gotten
around to telling me what they
were doing, they have always been
honest and open.
Their mistake has not been
dishonesty or deception, but
rather, serious carelessness. And
their mistake has been my mistake
as well for not having watched
their activities more closely.

The recent letter from Bill
Evers and Herb Borock regarding
the organizing for the Emergency
Conference of New Voters tonight
has made a number of charges
that deserve an answer from me.
The first charge is that a
University office—namely the
ASSU office (care of me) was

(OVHCikmhs

used as a return address for a
fundraising appeal for political
purposes. For the most part, this
charge is correct. My office and
name was listed as the return
address in a letter inviting
individuals in the community to a
fund-raising cocktail party in Los
Altos.

wrong. It is wrong because I don't
believe the ASSU office should be
the return address for any
fundraising for a non-campus
organization, however worthy.
The use of this return address
and my name was done without
my knowledge. Had I known
about it I would not have allowed
it. On discovering it, I ordered the
return address changed to my
personal post office box for all
future communications and
forwarding mail.
A second major charge of Evers
and Borock is that University
office space and University
extensions were being used for the
organizing of this rally. This is
also true, but it is a very gray
matter as to whether such use
constitutes a violation of
President Lyman's policy or
places our tax exempt status in
jeopardy.
Again I would emphasize that
ths is not a political rally in the
sense that the tax laws are
concerned with. As far as this
rally is political, it is concerned
with issues: namely, ending the
war in Vietnam, and opening up
the political processes of all
parties to fair representation by
women, young people, and

minorities.
This rally is NOT advocating or
supporting any candidate or
party. It is nonpartisan:
Independents, Republicans,
Democrats, and a Peace and
Freedom representative have all
been invited to speak. The charge
that this is a "Youth for

McCloskey" conference is simply
inconsistent with the facts. The
majority of the people organizing
this rally do not support Pete
McCloskey, or any other
candidate, for President.
So we return to the question of
what is "political" and what is
not. Because it is non-partisan,
because it is not supporting or
opposing officially any political
candidate, and because there is an
educational and public service
aspect to it, I do not believe this
rally can be defined as "political"
in the way that the regulations in
question mean that term to be
defined.
Still, we are left with two
problems. First, anytime
organizing related in any way to
state and national elections is
conducted in tax-exempt
University office space with
University phones, this issue may
be raised. It isn't worth the
trouble and confusion. Tuesday
morning the Council of Presidents
met with University attorneys Jim
Siena and George Gregory and
Assistant Provost Sally Mahoney.
We all agreed that all such future
organizing will be carried on in
office space rented from the
University (negotiations to begin
soon) which will not endanger its
tax-exempt status.
As for the present problem of
the rally organizers continuing to
use the ASSU office, the Council
of Presidents met with them
Tuesday afternoon and asked
them to cease the use of our
office within 24 hours. As of 5:00
p.m. yesterday, the Register for
Peace interns were no longer using
ASSU phones or office space to
organize the rally.
This action was taken not
because we regard their organizing
as in violation of Federal or
University rules, but because the
interns have been careless and
indiscrete in how they have used
my name and our offices, and, in
view of the present controversy
and the agreement made with Mr.
Siena on Tuesday, we decided
that the use of our offices and
phones was no longer appropriate.
I would hope that the Register
for Peace Interns are not unfairly
characterized in this controversy.

They are committed more deeply
and passionately to the issues that
challenge us than most of the
students on this—or any
other-campus. They have
incurred no expenses for the
ASSU in terms of long distance
phone calls or mimeograph or
xerox costs. They have worked on
this rally at great personal
sacrifice. When they have gotten
around to telling me what they
were doing, they have always been
honest and open.
Their mistake has not been
dishonesty or deception, but
rather, serious carelessness. And
their mistake has been my mistake
as well for not having watched
their activities more closely.

The recent letter from Bill
Evers and Herb Borock regarding
the organizing for the Emergency
Conference of New Voters tonight
has made a number of charges
that deserve an answer from me.
The first charge is that a
University office—namely the
ASSU office (care of me) was

(OVHCikmhs

used as a return address for a
fundraising appeal for political
purposes. For the most part, this
charge is correct. My office and
name was listed as the return
address in a letter inviting
individuals in the community to a
fund-raising cocktail party in Los
Altos.
The party is being held to raise
money to help pay for the
Emergency Conference—for the
advance leaflets and advertising,
for the travel expenses of the
speakers, and for the costs of the
rally itself. In that sense, the
fundraising appeal was no more
political than the rally itself; and
the rally itself is being organized
more as an educational conference
(on voter registration and delegate
selection processes) than as
anything blatantly political.
But whether the fundraising
appeal return address is illegal
under President Lyman's policy is
irrelevant as far as I am
concerned. In any case, it is
wrong. It is wrong because I don't
believe the ASSU office should be
the return address for any
fundraising for a non-campus
organization, however worthy.
The use of this return address
and my name was done without
my knowledge. Had I known
