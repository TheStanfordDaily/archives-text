# S.E. Asian Oil – A Key Factor
## 
### 
Most Thais, on looking over
their country's historical
development, are proud of its
ability to absorb and adapt to new
influences brought on by changing
power realities in Southeast Asia.
In effect, an enlightened and
forward looking Thai monarch,
under the pressure of Western
demands incorporated in the
unequal treaties of the last 19th
century, was able to effect limited
but vital reforms softening the
effect of the treaties and enabling
Thailand to enter the 20th
century in a much more stable
position than her neighbors.
The country was also spared
political colonization partly due
to its geographical position as a
buffer between French and
English imperial interests, and
partly due to a tradition of
extremely clever diplomacy.
Finally, in World War II under the
leadership of a military elite,
Thailand officially accepted
Japanese occupation and declared
war on the Allies, while a
significant proportion of the
civilian intellectuals in positions as
high as the Regency was able to
organize an anti-Japanese
resistance force supplying the
Allies with intelligence reports on
activities of the occupiers.
This Free Thai movement, as it
was called, was cited after the war
as a major factor in the U.S.
decision not to recognize the Thai
declaration of war, thus enabling
Thailand to emerge as a strong
ally of the United States—the
emerging dominant power in
Southeast Asia.
However, such flexibility and
ability to maneuver involved elite
decisions affecting small numbers
of people based on conditions of
relatively unchanging social,
economic, and political
configurations. Foreign economic
and cultural influence did not
penetrate to any profound degree;

changes in administrative and tax
systems did take place, but
population, land distribution,
peasant income, and commerce
did not undergo any great
transformations. The fact that the
renegotiation of the unequal
treaties in 1937 had so little effect
on the Thai economy is proof of
this.
Regional challenge to central
authority has been relatively
unimportant due to the
establishment of a centralized
bureaucracy in the 15th century
which removed land as a power
base and replaced it with officially
legitimized bureaucratic office.
The peasantry has known a stable
and plentiful environment, and
one finds literally no evidence of
peasant rebellions. Perhaps the
most telling illustration of this is
the often heard Thai song which
includes the words .. in the
fields there is rice and in the water
there is fish."
The question at present is
whether the policies followed
since around 1950 are creating
profound, new difficulties which
will require just as profound
solutions, and in doing so limit
Thailand's traditional flexibility
within Southeast Asia.
Internally, the slightly
tempered military dictatorship has
committed the country to a
prebendal type of capitalist
development based in large part
on public and private funds from
the U.S. and Japan as well as aid
from U.S. influenced multilateral
organizations. Private western
investment continues to grow in
areas of machinery and luxury
goods, while resource extraction is
beginning to be investigated as an
attractive possibility.
Besides increasing economic
and thus political dependence on
foreign-multinational companies,
the result of this strategy has been
a high growth rate in absolute

terms along with increasingly
unequal income distribution.
Given Thailand's policy of
"building on the best," the
disparity between Bangkok and
some of the airbase towns on one
hand and the rural areas on the
other is becoming more and more
glaring in terms of physical and
intellectual wealth.
The largely agricultural
economy depends on the sale of

rice and is thus now subjected to a
declining export market where
one of its chief competitors is the
U.S. trying to get rid of its rice
surpluses. This is beginning to
significantly affect peasant
incomes and the national balance
of payments.
Agricultural diversification is
proving next to impossible due to
the lack of a cooperative tradition
among the peasantry, but even
more to the failure of the huge,
inert, urban based bureaucracy to
establish real contact with the
countryside. Whatever capital is
being produced in the rural areas
is largely diverted into Bangkok
where it's used by a westernized
elite for consumption of foreign
luxury goods and/or capital
investment of the type attracting
more U.S. and Japanese funds.
Of course there is a degree of
peasant participation in all this;
large numbers of farmers, having
lost their land in central Thailand
to Bangkok based landlords, are
streaming into the city and
finding wage labor jobs in the
construction of luxury hotels,

office buildings, and factories
built with and for foreign
investment. All this has created
incredible problems of urban
housing, transportation,
population density, as well as a
breakdown of cultural identity.
This domestic strategy
corresponds to a pro-U.S. foreign
policy which has taken the form
of membership in SEATO
(SEATO headquarters is located

in Bangkok), disguised Thai forces
in Laos for almost 10 years, Thai
soldiers in Vietnam receiving large
material benefits through the
good offices of the U.S.,
American run counter-insurgency
schools since at least 1960, the
past use of Thai areas of the
northern part of the
Thai-Cambodian border for a CIA
sponsored anti-Sihanouk guerilla
movement, and most importantly,
the acceptance of U.S. airbases in
northeast and central Thailand.
Nor do the bases seem to be a
short term phenomenon. As the
war "winds down," American
soldiers are being replaced on a
long term basis by U.S. airpower,
a vital portion of which is
stationed in Thailand.
If the Thais are beginning to
have second thoughts about the
advisability of a staunch pro-U.S.
anti-Chinese stance, any change in
policy direction will be seriously
limited by the existence of the
bases. Nor will the bases be so
easy to get rid of. For it is here
that the nexus between foreign
and domestic interests is so

important.
U.S. investment and aid is
playing a vital role in Thai
economic development as well as
constituting the major factor in
the extensive development of the
Thai military. In short, the U.S.
has plenty of avenues to exert
influence, and there is no reason
to think that such influence won't
be exerted.
If the Thai military leaders do
see the airbases (or any other of
the more blatant aspects of their
relationship with the U.S.) as an
obstacle to a more realistic
position vis-a-vis China in the
context of Southeast Asian
realities, attempts to remove these
obstacles will most likely imply a
reaction from the U.S. having
serious consequences for the
military leadership's position in
Thai politics as well as for those
who are benefitting from the
present direction of the Thai
economy. It is doubtful whether
the leadership would be willing to
accept such consequences, and it
is here that one sees the
disapperance of the historical
flexibilitv of which the Thais have
been so proud.
And yet, the continuation of
the present policies externally and
internally will bring on problems
in the long run of an amplitute
which the present leaders cannot
forsee.
