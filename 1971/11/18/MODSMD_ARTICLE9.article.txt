Wrong Parties Criticized
Editor, THE DAILY:
While I am not surprised over
the seemily permissable violation
of President Lyman's edict on
political use of university facilities
by Mr. Diamond and his
dump-Nixon cohorts, I do feel
that the criticisms are being
directed at the wrong parties.
It comes as no surprise to
anyone that there are few if any
controls over the use of the ASSU
bullpen and mailboxes. In fact,
one can make a rather strong case
that the Financial Manager of the
ASSU is not the appropriate
person to enforce university
policy.
The most obvious fault in this
case lies with that arm of the
university administration that has
given sanction to the use of
Memorial Auditorium by the
dump-Nixon forces—namely, the
Office of Public Events. There is
an obvious parallel between their
neglecting their own policies in
this case and their allowing or
helping the Hoover Institution to
disregard policy in the case of the
Lodge speech last year. Clearly
the regulations do not apply
equally to all.

Derogating Franklin
Editor, THE DAILY:
Your last week's Monday
editorial urging the retention of
Bruce Franklin was most
persuasive. It reflected the bland
tone of "Prof. Franklin—who
he?" that pervaded the testimony
during the last two weeks of the
hearings. Indeed, I now find it
almost impossible to believe he
was even on campus during the
relevant episodes last February.
According to his witnesses, he
was a most extraordinarily
ineffectual speaker. He urged
people to go to their rooms and

think, but they went to the Comp
Center instead. He urged faculty
observers to stay and watch the
police, but they didn't. (One of
them has now had a delayed
reaction and thinks he should
have, so perhaps all is not lost.) If
Prof. Franklin spoke of "fucking
fascist faculty cops" after this
failure, as was testified, one can
scarcely blame him. It must be
tough to be a revolutionary leader
and still have so little influence.
Or have I missed something? A
year ago, Franklin did not appear
so harmless and ineffectual. We
had had the People's Park at
Berkeley, the Kent State murders,
a million dollar computer
destroyed at Fresno, another one
seriously threatened at NYU, and
not long past was the Cambodian
insanity. The atmosphere was
explosive. Bruce Franklin took a
leading position in the public
discussion of our difficulties—on
February 9 and 10. He did not
reduce the tension, nor did he
lead people away from the Comp
Center.
If the Administration felt
concern about the installation, in
the highly charged atmosphere of
last February, it is not surprising
that the police were called for
protection.
That time was not a time of
reason, of discussion; it was a time
of high tempers and a recent
history of violence. To pretend
that a Professor, who for years has
boasted of his revolutionary role
and intent, had no effect in this
situation is to pretend that the
people to whom he speaks are
supine, ineffectual, and of no
importance. I cannot derogate
Prof. Franklin or the people he
has been presumed to led, in the
way your Editorial did.

Official Response
Editor, THE DAILY:
Tuesday morning, after first
learning from the Daily of the
problem posed by the Emergency
Conference for New Voter's use
of ASSU facilities, a meeting of
the Council of Presidents was
convened by and with concerned
University officers. At that
meeting the guidelines which
govern political activities on
campus were discussed, and as
they relate to the Emergency
Conference's activities two points
were agreed upon.
First, it was agreed that the
rally sponsored by the Emergency
Conference is a legitimate public
event consonant with University
policies. Those policies permit
public political events on campus,
sponsored by voluntary
organizations, including events
which involve the appearance of
candidates for office or those who
oppose certain candidates for
office. Such events do not pose
problems under the University's
guidelines because of their
"one-time" nature which does not
suggest University involvement in
a campaign for political office or
University commitment to a
political issue.
Second, it was agreed by all
present that, because the activity
appears to some extent at least to
involve organization for a
campaign for political office, the
use of University tax-exempt
space for its organization should
no longer go on. The reason for
this is that activities involving
campaigns for public office do not
qualify for housing in academic
facilities under the University's
guidelines and the law.
One final point. Mr. Evers is
quoted in the Tuesday news story
as saying that the application of
the policy has been discriminatory
in that "various radical groups

have been denied use of
University facilities for
organizing . . . It is true that
other groups (and not just radical
groups) have been denied the use
of University tax-exempt space
for political purposes, and on the
same grounds that the Emergency
Conference committee has been
asked to move.

An Apology
Editor, THE DAILY:
We want to make clear our
responsibilities for the activities of
the Emergency Conference of
New Voters in the ASSU office
over the past ten days. We wish to
apologize to the Council of
Presidents, and especially to Larry
Diamond for the use of his name
and mail box as a return address.
We did so without Larry's consent
or knowledge. Our error, however
unintentional, was a breach of
university policy in which no
university official, staff, or
student took part. As soon as
Larry discovered our indiscretion,
it was stopped.
The circulation of leaflets
bearing "Dump Nixon"
inscriptions was not connected to
activities of any Stanford person.
"Dump Nixon" is not the
intention of Thursday's
conference, as yesterday's letter
to The Daily illustrates in quoting
from one of our letters. The
circulation of that leaflet was
stopped.
Those who abhor the presence
of bipartisan political efforts on
university premises should address
their attack to us, not to members
of the ASSU who did not permit
nor condone our oversights.

of President Lyman's edict on
political use of university facilities
by Mr. Diamond and his
dump-Nixon cohorts, I do feel
that the criticisms are being
directed at the wrong parties.
It comes as no surprise to
anyone that there are few if any
controls over the use of the ASSU
bullpen and mailboxes. In fact,
one can make a rather strong case
that the Financial Manager of the
ASSU is not the appropriate
person to enforce university
policy.
The most obvious fault in this
case lies with that arm of the
university administration that has
given sanction to the use of
Memorial Auditorium by the
dump-Nixon forces—namely, the
Office of Public Events. There is
an obvious parallel between their
neglecting their own policies in
this case and their allowing or
helping the Hoover Institution to
disregard policy in the case of the
Lodge speech last year. Clearly
the regulations do not apply
equally to all.

Derogating Franklin
Editor, THE DAILY:
Your last week's Monday
editorial urging the retention of
Bruce Franklin was most
persuasive. It reflected the bland
tone of "Prof. Franklin—who
he?" that pervaded the testimony
during the last two weeks of the
hearings. Indeed, I now find it
almost impossible to believe he
was even on campus during the
relevant episodes last February.
According to his witnesses, he
was a most extraordinarily
ineffectual speaker. He urged
people to go to their rooms and

think, but they went to the Comp
Center instead. He urged faculty
observers to stay and watch the
police, but they didn't. (One of
them has now had a delayed
reaction and thinks he should
have, so perhaps all is not lost.) If
Prof. Franklin spoke of "fucking
fascist faculty cops" after this
failure, as was testified, one can
scarcely blame him. It must be
tough to be a revolutionary leader
and still have so little influence.
Or have I missed something? A
year ago, Franklin did not appear
so harmless and ineffectual. We
had had the People's Park at
Berkeley, the Kent State murders,
a million dollar computer
destroyed at Fresno, another one
seriously threatened at NYU, and
not long past was the Cambodian
insanity. The atmosphere was
explosive. Bruce Franklin took a
leading position in the public
discussion of our difficulties—on
February 9 and 10. He did not
reduce the tension, nor did he
lead people away from the Comp
Center.
If the Administration felt
concern about the installation, in
the highly charged atmosphere of
last February, it is not surprising
that the police were called for
protection.
That time was not a time of
reason, of discussion; it was a time
of high tempers and a recent
history of violence. To pretend
that a Professor, who for years has
boasted of his revolutionary role
and intent, had no effect in this
situation is to pretend that the
people to whom he speaks are
supine, ineffectual, and of no
importance. I cannot derogate
Prof. Franklin or the people he
has been presumed to led, in the
way your Editorial did.

Official Response
Editor, THE DAILY:
Tuesday morning, after first
learning from the Daily of the
problem posed by the Emergency
Conference for New Voter's use
of ASSU facilities, a meeting of
the Council of Presidents was
convened by and with concerned
University officers. At that
meeting the guidelines which
govern political activities on
campus were discussed, and as
they relate to the Emergency
Conference's activities two points
were agreed upon.
First, it was agreed that the
rally sponsored by the Emergency
Conference is a legitimate public
event consonant with University
policies. Those policies permit
public political events on campus,
sponsored by voluntary
organizations, including events
which involve the appearance of
candidates for office or those who
oppose certain candidates for
office. Such events do not pose
problems under the University's
guidelines because of their
"one-time" nature which does not
suggest University involvement in
a campaign for political office or
University commitment to a
political issue.
Second, it was agreed by all
present that, because the activity
appears to some extent at least to
involve organization for a
campaign for political office, the
use of University tax-exempt
space for its organization should
no longer go on. The reason for
this is that activities involving
campaigns for public office do not
qualify for housing in academic
facilities under the University's
guidelines and the law.
One final point. Mr. Evers is
quoted in the Tuesday news story
as saying that the application of
the policy has been discriminatory
in that "various radical groups

have been denied use of
University facilities for
organizing . . . It is true that
other groups (and not just radical
groups) have been denied the use
of University tax-exempt space
for political purposes, and on the
same grounds that the Emergency
Conference committee has been
asked to move.

it was stopped.

dump-Nixon cohorts, I do feel
that the criticisms are being
directed at the wrong parties.
It comes as no surprise to
anyone that there are few if any
controls over the use of the ASSU
bullpen and mailboxes. In fact,
one can make a rather strong case
that the Financial Manager of the
ASSU is not the appropriate
person to enforce university
policy.
The most obvious fault in this
case lies with that arm of the
university administration that has
given sanction to the use of
Memorial Auditorium by the
dump-Nixon forces—namely, the
Office of Public Events. There is
an obvious parallel between their
neglecting their own policies in
this case and their allowing or
helping the Hoover Institution to
disregard policy in the case of the
Lodge speech last year. Clearly
the regulations do not apply
equally to all.

Derogating Franklin
Editor, THE DAILY:
Your last week's Monday
editorial urging the retention of
Bruce Franklin was most
persuasive. It reflected the bland
tone of "Prof. Franklin—who
he?" that pervaded the testimony
during the last two weeks of the
hearings. Indeed, I now find it
almost impossible to believe he
was even on campus during the
relevant episodes last February.
According to his witnesses, he
was a most extraordinarily
ineffectual speaker. He urged
people to go to their rooms and

think, but they went to the Comp
Center instead. He urged faculty
observers to stay and watch the
police, but they didn't. (One of
them has now had a delayed
reaction and thinks he should
have, so perhaps all is not lost.) If
Prof. Franklin spoke of "fucking
fascist faculty cops" after this
failure, as was testified, one can
scarcely blame him. It must be
tough to be a revolutionary leader
and still have so little influence.
Or have I missed something? A
year ago, Franklin did not appear
so harmless and ineffectual. We
had had the People's Park at
Berkeley, the Kent State murders,
a million dollar computer
destroyed at Fresno, another one
seriously threatened at NYU, and
not long past was the Cambodian
insanity. The atmosphere was
explosive. Bruce Franklin took a
leading position in the public
discussion of our difficulties—on
February 9 and 10. He did not
reduce the tension, nor did he
lead people away from the Comp
Center.
If the Administration felt
concern about the installation, in
the highly charged atmosphere of
last February, it is not surprising
that the police were called for
protection.
That time was not a time of
reason, of discussion; it was a time
of high tempers and a recent
history of violence. To pretend
that a Professor, who for years has
boasted of his revolutionary role
and intent, had no effect in this
situation is to pretend that the
people to whom he speaks are
supine, ineffectual, and of no
importance. I cannot derogate
Prof. Franklin or the people he
has been presumed to led, in the
way your Editorial did.

Official Response
Editor, THE DAILY:
Tuesday morning, after first
learning from the Daily of the
problem posed by the Emergency
Conference for New Voter's use
of ASSU facilities, a meeting of
the Council of Presidents was
convened by and with concerned
University officers. At that
meeting the guidelines which
govern political activities on
campus were discussed, and as
they relate to the Emergency
Conference's activities two points
were agreed upon.
First, it was agreed that the
rally sponsored by the Emergency
Conference is a legitimate public
event consonant with University
policies. Those policies permit
public political events on campus,
sponsored by voluntary
organizations, including events
which involve the appearance of
candidates for office or those who
oppose certain candidates for
office. Such events do not pose
problems under the University's
guidelines because of their
"one-time" nature which does not
suggest University involvement in
a campaign for political office or
University commitment to a
political issue.
Second, it was agreed by all
present that, because the activity
appears to some extent at least to
involve organization for a
campaign for political office, the
use of University tax-exempt
space for its organization should
no longer go on. The reason for
this is that activities involving
campaigns for public office do not
qualify for housing in academic
facilities under the University's
guidelines and the law.
One final point. Mr. Evers is
quoted in the Tuesday news story
as saying that the application of
the policy has been discriminatory
in that "various radical groups

have been denied use of
University facilities for
organizing . . . It is true that
other groups (and not just radical
groups) have been denied the use
of University tax-exempt space
for political purposes, and on the
same grounds that the Emergency
Conference committee has been
asked to move.

An Apology
Editor, THE DAILY:
We want to make clear our
responsibilities for the activities of
the Emergency Conference of
New Voters in the ASSU office
over the past ten days. We wish to
apologize to the Council of
Presidents, and especially to Larry
Diamond for the use of his name
and mail box as a return address.
We did so without Larry's consent
or knowledge. Our error, however
unintentional, was a breach of
university policy in which no
university official, staff, or
student took part. As soon as
Larry discovered our indiscretion,
it was stopped.
The circulation of leaflets
bearing "Dump Nixon"
inscriptions was not connected to
activities of any Stanford person.
"Dump Nixon" is not the
intention of Thursday's
conference, as yesterday's letter
to The Daily illustrates in quoting
from one of our letters. The
circulation of that leaflet was
stopped.
Those who abhor the presence
of bipartisan political efforts on
university premises should address
their attack to us, not to members
of the ASSU who did not permit
nor condone our oversights.
