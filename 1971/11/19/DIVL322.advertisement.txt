x Republican Convention, made a rather crass plea for support g
from the powerful Pennsylvania envelope industry by *
8 composing a major speech on the reverse side of a B'/2x2% |
I Presidential Special Bond Pre-gummed. Industry spokesmen, |
never known for their perspecacity, responded with an x
indignant telegram accusing the President of being so stupid as |
to not to know which side of an envelope to write the Address, x
If you forget our address, you can call us at 321-2300, ext. 5
4632. If you'd like to advertise a cloth-tinting service, call our
business office at ext. 4630; you will not have dyed in vain.
