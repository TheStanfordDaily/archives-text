## McCloskey, Lowenstein Urge Political Overhaul 
### JIM WASCHER DAVID THIEMANN 
"The Nixon administration can't do
anything without practicing deception,
deceit and dishonesty," said
Congressman Paul N. (Pete) McCloskey,
Jr. (Rep.-Calif.) before 2,000 people at
the Emergency Conference of New
Voters in Memorial Auditorium last
night.
McCloskey, who is challenging
President Nixon for the Republican
nomination for President, was joined
on the platform by Allard K.
Lowenstein, the organizer of the
"Dump Johnson" movement in 1968,
and by John Kerry, the national
spokesman of the Vietnam Veterans
Against the War.
McCloskey is a Stanford graduate
and was a Marine hero in Korea. He
said that his candidacy was directed at
ending all American involvement in the
Vietnam War and at restoring truth in
the national government.
Maverick
The maverick Republican went on
to say "It's not so important whether I
win or lose, but it is essential that we
recognize that there must be a
complete overhaul of the political
system." McCloskey suggested that the
best way for new voters to effect that
overhaul is "to participate in the
political system." He said that "the
White House is depending for its
survival upon the continued apathy of
young people" with regard to political
involvement.
„ McCloskey recommended that
young people register to vote, work to
reform the two political parties, register
their friends to vote, and then go out
and vote themselves.
According to a brief canvas of the
participants, two-thirds of the
aisle-clogging audience at Mem Aud was
composed of students from outside
Stanford University. Some came from
as far away as Marin County and
Oakland to attend the rally.
ADA Chairman
Lowenstein, a former Democratic
Congressman from New York and now
National Chairman of the Americans
for Democratic Action and guest
lecturer in The Human Biology
program here, praised McCloskey as
"one of those transcendentally great
figures who says what he believes even
when he is under pressure." He urged
those Republicans and Independents
who are not already doing so to work
in McCloskey's behalf.
Saying that the time has passed for
self-pity and speculation about what is
and what is not possible, Lowenstein
concluded that "we have an
opportunity to reclaim this country.
We can be the government. We are the
yeomen of the nation and the
upholders of the Constitution."
Kerry, who was the first of the
speakers, attacked President Nixon for
"doubling the bombing of Cambodia
and Laos, for a Hiroshima and a half of
bombing each week." He went on to

say that he was "tired of hearing that
nothing can be done about the war
because that's a tremendous injustice to
all of those who have fought so long for
peace" and to the men now in combat
in Vietnam.
Country Has Conscience
Kerry said that "the Vietnam
Veterans Against the War are trying to
prove that this country still does have a
conscience." He bitterly attacked the
treatment given to Vietnam veterans on
their return to the United States, citing
inadequate job opportunities and drug
addiction care.
Senator Alan Cranston, who was
scheduled to appear at the rally, was
held in Washington for an important
vote in the Senate. His son, Kim, read a
telegram from the Senator extending
his best wishes.
Other speakers at the rally were
Assemblyman John Vasconcellos
(Dem.-San Jose); Assemblyman Willie
L. Brown, Jr. (Dem.-San Francisco) and
Congressman Donald W. Riegle, Jr.
(Rep.-Mich.).

Before they spoke at the rally,
several of the participants conducted
informal press conferences and
interviews with newspaper and radio
reporters.
McCloskey arrived backstage after
delaying his trip for a planned House
vote on an election reform bill
requiring full disclosure of all campaign
contributions. Final consideration in
the House has been delayed until after
the Thanksgiving recess by a
conservative "filibuster," he said.
The liberal Republican supports
reform because it may improve the
quality of the Congress, which "is the
most archaic, damaging, serious
problem in the country today," in his
opinion.
He believes "the Republican party is
gradually diminishing, both in numbers

and elected members," because of the
quality of its leadership.
Dissent Desirable
Republican leaders should tolerate
dissent, McCloskey believes, rather than
"purging" members like former
California Senator Thomas Kuchel,
former New York Senator Charles
Goodell, and former Secretary of the
Interior Walter Hickel, who disagree
with the policies of the party
leadership.
Commenting on current issues,
McCloskey criticized the nuclear test
on Amchitka Island because it
destroyed a game preserve and because
the executive branch withheld the
recommendations of environmental
impact statements on the test from
Congress and the public.
Air Force Condemned
He discussed indiscriminate
American bombing in Cambodia and
Laos, condemning the Air Force and
the administration for their
indiscriminate bombing of civilian
targets, especially neutral villages.
Supporting his accusations,
McCloskey cited results of intelligence
photographs of the village area,
showing almost all villages destroyed by
bombing, and statements made to his
office by about 60 pilots who flew
combat missions in the area.
In a press conference John Kerry
said the publicity which surrounded the
My Lai atrocities had reduced personal
acts of illegal killing or torture, but had
not affected U.S. bombing operations
and activities within "free fire zones."
However, the Yale graduate
disapproves of war crimes trials on any
level, "because I believe they serve no
purpose, ultimately."
Kerry's organization, with about
23,500 members, 3,000 of whom are
now in Vietnam, supports all efforts to
defeat Nixon, but has not endorsed any
candidate.

SJC CONTROVERSY CONTINUES-ASSU Council of Presidents member Doug McHenry addresses last night's student
senate meeting in Cummings Art Auditorium. McHenry criticized the current judicial system as unjust and undemocratic. The
Senate later voted not to nominate students to the Stanford Jrdicial Council (SJC) as President Lyman requested. Lyman has
said that if no students were nominated by today, he would institute his own interim judicial system.
