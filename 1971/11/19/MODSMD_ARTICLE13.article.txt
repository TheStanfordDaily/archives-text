## It's Big Game Time!!!! Mrs. Lyman Picks Cards Band Heads To City 
### 
Ms. JinLyman yesterday
predicted Stanford to win the Big
Game. The Farm's first lady said she
was "confident in our team" but added
that she was not "knowledgeable
enough" to predict how much the
Indians would win by.
She also did not say whether she and
President Lyman would attend the
bonfire tonight.
The traditional Lake Lagunita rally
is scheduled to commence at 7 p.m.
Axe Comm Chairman Bruce Hart
said yesterday he expects the big fire to
be lit about 7:45 p.m.
He added that he was
"disappointed" with the Freshman
turnout this year to help build the fire.
Volunteers are also being sought to
recycle cans at the Big Game itself,
which involves collecting cans along the
aisles and cleaning up briefly after the
game. -
Recyclers have found the fans to be
friendly, and the work refreshing
exercise. If you are interested sign up at
the Conservation Group Desk in
Tresidder or at Alpha Phi Omega in the
old firehouse today.
The band's march through the city
tonight will begin at Union Square
hopefully between 10 and 10:30 p.m.
The Big Game is tomorrow at 1:30
p.m. in Memorial Stadium here.
All Stanford is hoping that its 11
will be able to win back the axe.


RAH, RAH—This dolly looks pretty excited about Big Game. And rightly so! She
was Big Game Queen back in 19 58. Stanford no longer chooses a Big Game
Queen. Needless to say, some traditions are better left dead.
