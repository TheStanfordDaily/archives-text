# What Is The Axe?
## Whence Does This Fine Tradition Come? 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
Billy Erb is certainly not one of the
world's ten most well-known people.
In fact, he's probably not even in
the top ten thousand.
But then, neither are you.
To make a short story long it was
Spring, 1899. Stanford was preparing

for its big game against Cal in baseball.
We'd already gotten clobbered in
football and baseball. Plus we were
missing our star pitcher.
Naturally, everyone was optimistic.
Morale Boost
In order to boost morale, the
incredible Billy Frb brought a large
broadaxe to a pregame rally on April
13. He figured it would go swell with
the "give 'em the axe cheer," an
inspired piece of poetry that Will Irwin
had composed in 1895.
Billy's axe was then carried to the
game where it was paraded in front of
the stands. The new Stanford symbol
boosted morale to such a degree that
we committed five errors and gave up
seven runs in the first two innings,
eventually losing 9-7.
That was bad enough. But with
incredible dexterity Stanford managed
to lose more than the game.
The axe had been entrusted to Carl
liayden, later to become President pro
tem of the U.S. Senate. Carl quickly
received his first taste of political life
when a group of Cal students pulled a
real hatchet job.
Axe Lost
The group pounced on Carl and
deaxetivated him, making off with the
blade to Cal where a giant rally was
held.
At this point enters Harry Dutton,
whose enthusiasm unfortunately was
never matched by his brain size. Harry,
a student at Stanford, attended the Cal
rally on a white horse. He cleverly
offered to hold up the axe so the crowd
could see it better.
Soon given the axe, Harry quickly
realized however, that as everyone
crowded around to see the axe, they
effectively blocked any escape route.
Harry had to return the trophy to the
crowd.
But that didn't stop old Harry.
Several days later he went to the Chi
Phi house at Cal where the axe was
being stored. This time Harry was
clever enough to glue on a fake
mustache and carry a note which read,
"Send by this fellow (a tall man) the
axe to me this afternoon for I want to
number it and fix the handle. This
fellow is a painter. AI Lean."
No H air
The Chi Phi house immediately gave
Harry the axe, an act which apparently
excited him so much that his mustache
came unglued. Hairless Harry split, fast,
and without the axe.
The axe remained at Berkeley for
thirty years in a bank value and was

only taken out once a year, for a rally
before the Big Game in baseball. Cal
was really axeing for it.
It's now 1930. There's a Stanford
man in the White House. Thanks to
him, no one is spending their free time
holding down a part time job or playing
the market.
Don Kropp is spending his time
planning—planning what is probably
the best known caper in Stanford
history.
On April 3, Don and 20 friends
drove from Sequoia Hall to Berkeley.
As the axe was being returned to the
Berkeley bank after the Big Game rally,
several cameramen asked if they might
photograph the trophy. But the
cameramen were to take more than
pictures.
Ours Again
As the flash powder went off, other
members of the Stanford group
grabbed the blade and passed it to the
get-away car.
Art Miller then threw a teargas
bomb into the crowd to further cloud
the events, and other marauders
quickly organized search parties of Cal
students to go in the opposite direction
of the planned escape route.
The axe was successfully returned to
Stanford where people were so elated
that classes were called off the next
day. The axenappers became known as
the "Immortal 21" and all received
varsity letters.
In 1933, Stanford and Cal agreed to

bury the hatchet for good and use the
axe as a Big Game trophy, an
agreement which apparently has been
axeceptable to everyone.

TOWER POWER—It looks like the people in Pisa, Italy are leaning toward
Stanford in the Big Game rivalry. Stanford-in-Italy did this decorating in 1960.
But the .n tig tower is not the only exotic spot where Beat Cal banners have
been unfurled. Others include: the Tower of London, on top of the Matterhorn
(not the one in Disneyland), the Berkeley Campanile, Coit tower, and in Red
Square
