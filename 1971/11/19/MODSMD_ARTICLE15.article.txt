# Ink Bowl Is A Big Deal!
## Scribes Play Ball 
### HALL DAILY 
Since 1952, the Stanford
Daily-Daily Californian Ink Bowl has
been the most accurate yardstick for
the Big Game. Only once since 1954
has the winner of the Ink Bowl failed
to lose Big Game with the Daily Cal
winning eight times to the Daily's seven
(two were ties).
In the first bowl, the "Typo Bowl,"
in '52, the Indian press erased the
Bears, 18-7, capturing the "Turkey
Hatchet," symbol of the Ink Axe. After
gloom reigned in 1953 when the Tribe
scribes not only failed to win but also
neglected to hand down the game score
for posterity, glory returned with an
18-0 win in '54. The Cub reporters
wrote off the second half due to a
sterling performance by referee Phil
Berman, who had earlier clinched a
26-6 Daily victory over the Chaparral
by calling back eight Chappie
touchdowns. Besides the official help,
the Card bards were sided by the

hidden deflated ball trick and the
double ball maneuver.
In '56, Cal's Dirty Dan McElbow,
ousted late in the game for puncturing
the pigskin, led the amoral Bears to a
6-0 win.
Since 1959, the Daily has managed
only one triumph in eight contests.
While Coaches Ralston and Willsey are
awaiting the kickoff tomorrow
afternoon, the Stanford Daily will
know who gets the Axe.


THEY GAVE US THE AXE, THE AXE, THE AXE-Some of the "Immortal 21" with leader Don Kropp (the short
guy in front) pose after successfully stealing the axe back from Cal in 1 930. The axe had remained at Cal for thirty years after
it was stolen from Stanford in 1899.
