# RFs Also Traditional
## But What Is An RF? 
### Jerry Coleman 
In the finest tradition of the Great
Train Robbery, "Topkapi," and the
Fort Knox heist of "Goldfinger,"
Stanford and Cal red hots every year
try to pull incredible pranks on each
other during Big Game week.
These pranks, or RF's as they're
commonly called, take intricate
planning, cunning, engineering
know-how, complicated tooks, and
guts.
Take for example the classic
Stanford RF of the early 1960'5: a
"Beat Cal" banner, made of bedsheets
tied to a length of 100 feet, was
dropped down the side of the Berkeley
campus Campanile (Cal's equivalent of
Hoover Tower). How was this feat
accomplished?"
A Stanford woman was wrapped in
the banner, giving her the appearance
of a 12-month pregnant woman. The
bundled coed and several Stanford
males journeyed to Berkeley and rode
up to the tower's observation deck.
Hoo Tow Attempts
The males distracted the tower guide
on one side of the structure as their
female accomplice gracefully
priouetted, slowly letting the banner
down.
Through the years, Cal men have
tried similar stunts on our own Hoover
Tower, but their banners have been
smaller in scale, barely reaching a
length of 30 feet. This very year, just
last Tuesday night, 8 carloads of Cal
red hots tried a new Too Tow trick.
Climbing atop the Hoover Institute,
they attempted to shoot water balloons
filled with blue paint at the tower.
Typical of Cal ineptitude, every balloon
missed, either hitting the sidewalk or
exploding before launch.
Cal fans once did succeed in
distinctly marking the tower: Stanford
students looked up at the imposing
monument one Big Game week

morning to find giant blue footprints
walking up the side.
Amazing Feet
Officials ordered that the prints
"come down immediately." Two
mornings later, the footprints were seen
descending the tower's other side!
Cal students also managed to paint a
big "C" on the book store roof. A
much better RF was perpetrated on
Cal's own concrete "C" which
majestically guards a Berkeley hillside.
Stay tuned for details.
A Stanford engineering class
considered what problems would be
involved inchanging the C to an S.
Stress points, forces requried, and
equations worked out, Stanford men
travelled north with their hydraulic
jacks and blocks and tackles.
The C was cracked in the middle,
pulled into an S. recemented, and, as a
final touch, repainted red.
The Stanford RF taking the most
time and effort occurred in 1962,
involving a switcheroo on the Daily
Californian. Stanford people went to
Cal every night for four weeks,
followed the Daily Cal delivery boys,
and made note of all routes and
schedules.
A peninsula printer was then hired
to make bogus issues of the Daily Cal
featuring the original masthead and
type set. This 4 page paper looked
normal at first glance, with the
exception that all the front page
articles praised Stanford.
Surprises lurked inside, for page 2
and 3 were blank, save for the words
"Beat Cal" in letters 4 inches high. At
the bottom of the page was the
explanation for the asterisks:
"Compliments of Leland Stanford
Junior University, organized 1891."
The Stanford red hots followed the
delivery boys on Friday before the
game, replacing every original Daily Cal
with their own. The originals — all
20,000 copies — were politely dumped
on the UC Chancellor's lawn.
Bonfire Attacked
Cal RF's often strike at the Lake
Lag bonfire, Stanford's greatest Big
Game tradition. As one year's bonfire
was being built, nobody noticed several
Berkeleyites across Junipero Serra
constructing a large wooden frame.

Hours later, when the bonfire was
lit, 200 road flares — spelling "Cal" in
15 foot letters — were also set ablaze
across the road. Incredibly, the Cal
students got away.
In another Cal bonfire RF, the
perpetrator was not so lucky: he
succeeded in lighting the fire half an
hour ahead of schedule but could not
escape the maddened crowd. Stanford
police rescued him and depositied him,
still bleeding, at the Menlo Park Bus
Depot.
Late in the 60's, Stanford students
pulled an RF with a personalflair —
kidnapping the Cal pom-pon dollies.
Posing as San Francisco Chronicle
cameramen sent out to get Public
Relations photos of the girls in Cal's
Sproul Plaza, several Stanford males
gained the dollies' trust.
Taken For A Ride
The women were picked up at their
sororities and hustled into cars, a male
on each side of every dolly. The cars
headed off toward Sproul, but by the
time they had passed the Bay Bridge
toll gate, the girls had figured out what
was going on.
One dolly became quite flustered
and commented, "You know this is
kidnapping; my father is a lawyer!"
The driver coolly turned around and
replied, "That's OK — so's mine."
The 1964 football season brought
out the best in both school's red hots,
resulting in several days of see-sawing
RF's. Stanford started the fun, stealing
Cal's cannon from their stadium on
Halloween night.
Conditions were at their worst for
the quartet of RF'ers: a driving rain,
and a discovery that the cannon
weighed 600 lbs. Yet, amazingly, the
four carried the cannon out and
brought it down to the Farm in the
back of their sagging car.
Unfortunately due to a security
leak, Cal forces learned the
whereabouts of their cannon — a trunk
of a car in the Stern parking lot. The
next night, Cal men broke into the
trunk and stole back the cannon, this
time storing it in a safe, secret place.
Knd of story? No! Two nights later,
Stanford restole the cannon from the
locked inner office of the director of
the Cal Student Union.
