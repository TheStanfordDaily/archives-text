# Frosh Like The Bonfire!
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
Almost the first thing you hear
about on arriving here in September is
the bonfire—how, as a freshman, you'll
have to guard it.
So, when my roommate came in
Wednesday and said, "Let's go to the
bonfire tonight to guard it," 1 said "Not
on your life." Then he recited the
magic words:
"Fifteen kegs of free beer."
That is why 1 was stumbling though
the bottom of Lake Lagunita at
midnight Wednesday, getting stickers
bigger than watermelons in my feet and
a very cold feeling on my face.
Lake Lag, when dry, takes on all the
bad attributes of the surface of the
moon. There are craters and dust and
funny rocks that you can fall on and
break your head. I know about all these
things because I did them.
Finally, after a fierce struggle, we
got to the telephone pole frame. Off to
the side was a small fire, with about 30
or 40 people clustered around, and—ta
da! -a keg of beer. When faced with a
choice between getting warm and
drinking beer, the correct alternative is
obvious: we snatched paper cups and
stumbled over to the kegs.
Then we got about the business of
guarding.
Guarding a bonfire is relatively
simple work: you just sit in a circle
around the small fire, drink beer, and
discuss politics, religion, girls—and the
lack thereof—and whether or not to get
another beer. I kept thinking to myself
that there must be more to it than this,
but there really wasn't, or if there was,
we never did it.
Since there is absolutely no way to
get into Lake Lag with
torches—unobserved, anyway—about
the only way those fiends from Cal
could have burned the thing down
would be to rent a plane and bomb it,
or fire mortar shells at us over the dike.
Around 1:30 a.m. things started to
degenerate. First, the Jesus freaks
started performing "Jesus Christ,
Superstar." Actually, I like the opera,
but it is not my idea of fine
entertainment for a drunk in a lake bed
when it's 40 degrees. It could be
tolerated, however. But also about this
time I got tired of hearing about the
many faults of Stanford women (the
chief one, by consensus, is that there
aren't any to be found). I know all
about it, anyway, and it gets depressing
to be reminded after a while.
But then the inconceivable, the
impossible, the unimaginable
happened: they ran out of beer.
