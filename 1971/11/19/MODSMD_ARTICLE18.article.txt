# Yugoslavian Folk Dancers
## 'Frula' Appears On Sunday 
### 
Yugoslavian folk tradition will
be recreated at Stanford on
Sunday, when the "Frula!" dance
company appears in Memorial
Auditorium at 2:30 p.m.
The success of this youngest of
Yugoslavia's four major dance
companies is due largely to its en
terprising director, Dragoslav Dzad
zevic. A Dancer, engineer and actor
in his own right, Dzadzevic found

ed the group in 1964.
In order to form a dance
company truly representative of
all the Yugoslavian peoples,
Dzadzevic travelled throughout
the six republics in order to locate
and audition the best and most
beautiful dancers and the best
musicians.
He chose at first 25 dancers
who were to become the core of

the company that was to bear the
name "Frula!"—meaning flute, the
instrument that accompanies
many dances along with other
instruments. He took the group,
all talented dancers in their own
right, to the wilderness of the
mountains and other regions to
retrain them in his own particular
style.
Yugoslavia's history of many

foreign occupations, along with
the country's composition of
these six heterogeneous republics,
offerred Dzadzevic a rich
background for creating the
choreography costumes and
lighting used in the company's
performances.
The 36 member company has
an average age of only 20. Aside
from their Yugoslavian folk dance
heritage, their dancing
encompasses many foreign
influences, particularly Oriental.
As of yesterday afternoon,
only 300 tickets remained for the
Sunday performance. They are
priced at $2, $3 and $4 with a 75
cent discount in all categories for
students. Tickets will be on sale
today at the Tresidder Box Office
from 9 to 5:30 p.m. If available
$2 student rush tickets will be
sold 15 minutes before curtain
time.
The dance company is also
performing on Saturday night at
the Masonic Auditorium in San
Francisco. Tickets for that 8:30
p.m. performance are priced at
$3.50, $4.25, $5 and $5.75.

companies is due largely to its en
terprising director, Dragoslav Dzad
zevic. A Dancer, engineer and actor
in his own right, Dzadzevic found

ed the group in 1964.
In order to form a dance
company truly representative of
all the Yugoslavian peoples,
Dzadzevic travelled throughout
the six republics in order to locate
and audition the best and most
beautiful dancers and the best
musicians.
He chose at first 25 dancers
who were to become the core of

the company that was to bear the
name "Frula!"—meaning flute, the
instrument that accompanies
many dances along with other
instruments. He took the group,
all talented dancers in their own
right, to the wilderness of the
mountains and other regions to
retrain them in his own particular
style.
Yugoslavia's history of many

foreign occupations, along with
the country's composition of
these six heterogeneous republics,
offerred Dzadzevic a rich
background for creating the
choreography costumes and
lighting used in the company's
performances.
The 36 member company has
an average age of only 20. Aside
from their Yugoslavian folk dance
heritage, their dancing
encompasses many foreign
influences, particularly Oriental.
