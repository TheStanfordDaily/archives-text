# Tolly's Follies
## If You Ain't Gonna Party 
### Don Tollefson 
The traditional pre- and
post-Big Game parties will take up
most of the weekend for some
people, but I'm sure there will be
a lot of you who will pass them
up for other forms of
entertainment. Fortunately, there
are a number of good events
which might tempt someone to go
off campus.
Winterland in San Francisco
has a fairly promising four act
show tonight and tomorrow night
at 8 p.m. Headlining will be
drummer Buddy Miles whose
group has a combination rock,
jazz and soul sound. Miles was
featured on the "Band of Gypsys"
album which he recorded live at
Fillmore East with Buddy Cox
and the late Jimi Hendrix.
Second on the bill is the J Geils
Band, a fine hard rock group out
of Boston who put on a great
show at Fillmore West last spring.
Commander Cody and His Lost
Planet Airmen and Redlegs
complete the bill. Tickets are $4.
Canned Heat
Also tonight and tomorrow
night, Canned Heat will be at the
Circle Star Theatre in San Carlos
along with Linda Ronstadt. This
will be the first major rock show
at the Circle Star since Ike and
Tina Turner were there back in
September. Shows will be at 7:30
and 10:30 p.m. each night and
tickets are priced at $3.50, $4.50
and $5.50.

Bill Cosby is appearing
Saturday night at the new Marin
Veterans Memorial Building in
San Rafael. Bill "Ain't No
Sunshine" Withers, who appeared
here last night at the "Dump
Nixon" rally, will also be on the
bill. Showtifnes are 7 and 10 p.m.
and a few tickets priced at $4.50,
$5.50 and $6.50 were still
available late yesterday afternoon.
For late ticket information call
472-3500.
Cosby is currently studying at
the University of Massachusetts
for a teaching credential.
Reportedly he wants to go into a
kind of "media teaching" utilizing
radio, television and movies. The
Marin Veterans Memorial Building
where he will appear is a brand
new three million dollar building
which opened on September 25.
It seats 2088 people and among
the artists scheduled to appear
there in the next few months are
Nina Simone, Les McCann,
Carmen McCrae and Jose
Feliciano.
In the world of cinema, the
People's Film Festival is going on
this weekend at the Harding
Theatre in San Francisco, site of
the recent Grateful Dead concert
a few weekends ago.
Among the films being shown
this weekend are Torture in
Brazil, Angela Davis: Portrait of A
Revolutionary, Rescued from
Laos, and Mexico: The Frozen

Revolution. For a complete
schedule of times and showings
consult the Who, What, When and
Where calendar in Tuesday's
Daily.
Dramatic highlights include a
preview performance of the ACT
production of The Cavern,
tomorrow at 2:30 p.m. at the
Geary Theatre in San Francisco.
George M. Cohan's
comedy-melodrama will have
another preview performance on
Monday at 8:30 p.m. Tickets are
