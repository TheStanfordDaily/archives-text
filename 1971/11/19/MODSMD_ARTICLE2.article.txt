# Diamond Tells Plans For Student Politicking

### BOB LITTERMAN 
At a strategy session immediately
preceeding the mass meeting for new
voters last night, ASSU President Larry
Diamond told about 100 student
leaders of schools throughout the Bay
Area that "there are many ways of
getting around" the laws against using
University facilities for political
purposes.
Diamond's statement was made in
response to apprehension expressed by
several of the student leaders that the
kinds of organizing Diamond called for
would jeopardize the tax status of their
schools.
At the meeting Diamond had
outlined his strategy of creating a
voter's union which would attempt to
place young people as delegates to the
Democratic Party national convention.
Diamond has been the center of a
controversy this week on whether the
ASSU office facilities were being used
illegally by the group organizing last
night's rally.
Avoid Problems
He told the leaders they could avoid
such problems by, for example, "using
plain stationary instead of letterhead,
and identifying yourself as a student
leader rather than as student body
president."
Responding to Diamond's
statement, University legal council
James Siena told the Daily, "his
suggestion is probably not illegal, but it

seems that Larry is calling for a form of
deception which is certainly unethical.
To mask the real purpose of University
space is something we can not
condone."
Although the mass meeting which
followed was billed as "not political"
by Diamond, the strategy session
beforehand clearly supported the
reform platform of the Democratic
Party.
Partisan Leaflet
A leaflet called "Some Proposed
Tactics," which Diamond distributed,
said, "Our initial premise should be
that, at this early juncture of the '72
campaign, California youth cannot
agree on a candidate best suited to
advance the principles we believe in. On
the other hand ... we should work to
build a consensus around a set of
principles, embodied in the
recommendations set forth by
the . . . McGovern Commission."
One woman at the session asked if it
were completely out of consideration
to support Pete McCloskey. A
Democratic Party worker told her,
"The Republican Party is a very tough
nut to crack . . . There just won't be
any reforms in that party this year."
A youth, who identified himself as a
member of the Socialist Youth Party,
was widely heckled when he said his
work in 1968 taught him that the
Democratic Party was also a "tough
nut."
