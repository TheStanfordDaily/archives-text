### PAUL GRUSHKIN 
Its A Beautiful Day — "Choice
Quality Stuff/Anytime"
(Columbia KC 30734).
It was fortunate that my
roommate and I didn't hear, on
that October night two years ago,
that the first major
Crosby/Stills/Nash & Young
concert at Winterland was to be
cancelled due to the death of
Crosby's fiancee. Fortunate
because we rushed up to the City
ail hot and excited and were
served It's A Beautiful Day
instead.
The little "low-key" band from
the City and Marin simply
proceeded to blow us right up
into the sky. It was one of those
nights when I stumbled out of
Winterland absolutely spinning
from the power and creativity of a
rock band.
In fact, since their albums are
equally mesmerizing on a slightly
different plane, I'm even
perversely glad that almost
nobody listens to them, or even
takes them half-seriously. Ha Ha.
Those fools.
Their first release, entitled "It's
A Beautiful Day" (Columbia CS
9768) with the white-rock girl
standing on the album cover, was
on the stands a week or two
before that concert. Sales were
helped because their hit single,
"White Bird" (eventually
destroyed by AM radio just as The
Doors' "Light My Fire" was
reduced to a "short" version),
keynoted the production.
'White Bird'
If people have heard of The
Day, it's because of "White Bird";
while that's justly so, it would be
as great a mistake to judge
Santana simply on the basis of
"Soul Sacrifice" or "Jingo." But
the song is a technical
masterpiece, lacing a clear organ
backing to a perfectly controlled
Hal Wagenet acoustic guitar,
bonded together by the David
LaFlamme violin and the Pattie
Santos/LaFlamme vocals. Much of
their first album is in the "White
Bird" motif.
The following summer they
released their second album,
"Marrying Maiden" (Columbia CS
1058), which was a nigh-on
disaster in terms of sales and FM
airplay. But it's also their best,
their most exquisite offering,
proving nothing so much as that
these musicians are among the
most talented and creative in rock
music.
k 'Don and Dewey" features
Fred Webb's organ work with a
madcap LaFlamme violin. Fred
Neil's "The Dolphins" follows
with some of the smoothest vocal
work to rival the "American
Beauty" Dead. "Hoedown"
follows that, featuring Jerry
Garcia on country banjo (the first
and only time on the album)

against a soaring LaFlamme fiddle
and a thumping stand-up bass of
Mitchell Holman. Poco's new
"Hoedown" sounds positively
amateurish alongside this.
Perfectly enunciated vocals
(listen how they sing the word
"mountain") highlight
"Soapstone Mountain" but
they're curiously slapped into a
hard-rock coalescence, which
soars to a stunning electric
crescendo and then cuts out
entirely, leaving the wonderful
vocals once again.

Tour-I)e-Forces
"Galileo" and "Do You
Remember The Sun" are the
"musically intellectual"
tour-de-forces on this album,
combining riffs and styles from
nearly every mode of music—off
the top of my head 1 can think of
flamenco guitar, classical violin
passages, church organ bars, even
a snatch of a jazzy nightclub
interlude. Try and listen to these
songs wrecked, and you'll see

what we're talking about.
But another year has passed in
which The Day became frequent
headliners at the Fillmore West. I
was only able to catch one of
their shows (actually an
appearance at the Fillmore East),
and the impression 1 got was one
of a hard-driving band utilizing
flashes of their brilliant
musicianship. They still
demonstrated that they are almost
classic students of music; they
know how to create all types
extremely proficiently.

Their new album "Choice
Quality Stuff/Anytime" is a
slightly disheartening reflection of
that status. They're very good, I
suppose, as a hard-driving rock
band, but that simply isn't why I
have great admiration for them.
But once again the recording is
impeccable, although The Day
switched from Wally Heider's and
Pacific High Recording Studios to
the new Columbia studios in San
Francisco.

"Creed of Love" begins the
"Choice Quality Stuff" side. If
you like the Papa John Creech
violin on the electric Hot Tuna
album, you'll just love the
LaFlamme pyrotechnics here,
screeching, piercing, but
controlled all the way through the
high registers. Occasionally a
mellow mouth harp adds some
wah-wahs to the steady, driving
beat.
'Bye, Bye, Baby'
Fred Webb's piano dances over
an even faster beat on "Bye Bye
Baby." You'll find excellent blues
violin here from LaFlamme, but
his vocals are subpar and the beat
unchanging. Note Webb's Lee
Michaels-style organ on "Grand
Camel Suits."
"No World For Glad" is
magnificent in the style of
"Marrying Maiden." The vocals are
smoother and mellower, with
Pattie Santos responding to
LaFlamme in the old way. And
the piano work? Superb!
If you think "Words" sounds a
little like Santana is playing,
you're not far off. Jose "Chepito"
Areas contributes on the timbales
and Coke Escovedo on the congas.
Rhythmic changes in the vocals
are handled well, but the
LaFlamme violin comes off
second-best to Carlos Santana's
guitar. On the whole, a moving,
driving side but without the
brilliante of the "Marrying
Maiden" musicianship. Nobody
really shows how very good they
are.
The "Anytime" side is a little
quieter. The classical violin and
tinkling piano provide interest,
but once again the drumming and
bass work are too ordinary on
"Place of Dreams."
Real Treat
"Oranges and Apples" is a real
treat, however. Webb's organ,
harpsichord, and French horn is in
a word, lovely, and the bass
(about time!) thumps the whole
house. Just try turning that bass
up, I dare you! LaFlamme's violin

perfectly complements the
moving, almost trilling
harpsichord.
Horns highlight "Anytime"
and the vocals are more
challenging; LaFlamme and
Santos have to work to sing this
one. A very pleasing song, on the
par with their best efforts. And
they prove once again that they
can hold a note till it starts singing
by itself.
"Bitter Wine" and "Misery
Loves Company" would be good
songs for they move well, but
they feature miserably uninspired
lyrics. And that's just a shame,
because The Day are still able to
put more musicianship into an
album than most rock groups.
Why they wasted their time with
some of this material is
inexplicable. If only it had the
quality of "Oranges & Apples"
throughout. After all, it's pretty
difficult to wait a year between
releases—and then to find out
they should have waited just a
little longer.
"Freedom Flight"— Shuggie
Otis—Epic E-30752
I believe that this is Shuggie's
second solo album. Shuggie's only

17 or 18 now, so by the time he's
finished, he's gonna have said one
hell of a lot. "Freedom Flight"
isn't as spell-binding as his first
"Here Comes Shuggie Otis,"
probably because there aren't as
many brilliant flashes on this
album. Shuggie's very good—just
listen to that guitar flash on
"Purple"—but his artistry only
comes in spurts and snorts.
I'd rather he concentrated on
developing his guitar technique
and included more of his fine, fine
blues runs on this album. Instead
he's mixed himself into playing
every instrument on several
selections (on "Strawberry Letter"
he does the vocal, guitars, organ,
piano, bass drums, sleigh, and
orchestra bells, and background
vocals) and the effect is just
ordinary; not one element is
especially breathtaking, the way
his works should be.
Occasionally Shuggie shines
with a brilliance; listen to his bass
runs on "Ice Cold Daydream," or
his tack piano on "Sweet Thang,"
or his wonderful vocals on "Me
and My Woman."
If there's a fault to this album
it's that he's regressed a bit since
that legendary first album at age

16. And if its not regression, he's
standing still, and that isn't good
enough for Shuggie Otis.
The title track, by the way,
"Freedom Flight," might
disconcert you, for it goes into
the realms of free-form jazz, not
at all the blues motif that he's
(and his father Johnny) are noted
for. I enjoyed his reverberating
guitar, but seems to lose its
central theme too often.

flashes of their brilliant
musicianship. They still
demonstrated that they are almost
classic students of music; they
know how to create all types
extremely proficiently.

Their new album "Choice
Quality Stuff/Anytime" is a
slightly disheartening reflection of
that status. They're very good, I
suppose, as a hard-driving rock
band, but that simply isn't why I
have great admiration for them.
But once again the recording is
impeccable, although The Day
switched from Wally Heider's and
Pacific High Recording Studios to
the new Columbia studios in San
Francisco.

"Creed of Love" begins the
"Choice Quality Stuff" side. If
you like the Papa John Creech
violin on the electric Hot Tuna
album, you'll just love the
LaFlamme pyrotechnics here,
screeching, piercing, but
controlled all the way through the
high registers. Occasionally a
mellow mouth harp adds some
wah-wahs to the steady, driving
beat.
'Bye, Bye, Baby'
Fred Webb's piano dances over
an even faster beat on "Bye Bye
Baby." You'll find excellent blues
violin here from LaFlamme, but
his vocals are subpar and the beat
unchanging. Note Webb's Lee
Michaels-style organ on "Grand
Camel Suits."
"No World For Glad" is
magnificent in the style of
"Marrying Maiden." The vocals are
smoother and mellower, with
Pattie Santos responding to
LaFlamme in the old way. And
the piano work? Superb!
If you think "Words" sounds a
little like Santana is playing,
you're not far off. Jose "Chepito"
Areas contributes on the timbales
and Coke Escovedo on the congas.
Rhythmic changes in the vocals
are handled well, but the
LaFlamme violin comes off
second-best to Carlos Santana's
guitar. On the whole, a moving,
driving side but without the
brilliante of the "Marrying
Maiden" musicianship. Nobody
really shows how very good they
are.
The "Anytime" side is a little
quieter. The classical violin and
tinkling piano provide interest,
but once again the drumming and
bass work are too ordinary on
"Place of Dreams."
Real Treat
"Oranges and Apples" is a real
treat, however. Webb's organ,
harpsichord, and French horn is in
a word, lovely, and the bass
(about time!) thumps the whole
house. Just try turning that bass
up, I dare you! LaFlamme's violin

perfectly complements the
moving, almost trilling
harpsichord.
Horns highlight "Anytime"
and the vocals are more
challenging; LaFlamme and
Santos have to work to sing this
one. A very pleasing song, on the
par with their best efforts. And
they prove once again that they
can hold a note till it starts singing
by itself.
"Bitter Wine" and "Misery
Loves Company" would be good
songs for they move well, but
they feature miserably uninspired
lyrics. And that's just a shame,
because The Day are still able to
put more musicianship into an
album than most rock groups.
Why they wasted their time with
some of this material is
inexplicable. If only it had the
quality of "Oranges & Apples"
throughout. After all, it's pretty
difficult to wait a year between
releases—and then to find out
they should have waited just a
little longer.
"Freedom Flight"— Shuggie
Otis—Epic E-30752
I believe that this is Shuggie's
second solo album. Shuggie's only

17 or 18 now, so by the time he's
finished, he's gonna have said one
hell of a lot. "Freedom Flight"
isn't as spell-binding as his first
"Here Comes Shuggie Otis,"
probably because there aren't as
many brilliant flashes on this
album. Shuggie's very good—just
listen to that guitar flash on
"Purple"—but his artistry only
comes in spurts and snorts.
I'd rather he concentrated on
developing his guitar technique
and included more of his fine, fine
blues runs on this album. Instead
he's mixed himself into playing
every instrument on several
selections (on "Strawberry Letter"
he does the vocal, guitars, organ,
piano, bass drums, sleigh, and
orchestra bells, and background
vocals) and the effect is just
ordinary; not one element is
especially breathtaking, the way
his works should be.
Occasionally Shuggie shines
with a brilliance; listen to his bass
runs on "Ice Cold Daydream," or
his tack piano on "Sweet Thang,"
or his wonderful vocals on "Me
and My Woman."
If there's a fault to this album
it's that he's regressed a bit since
that legendary first album at age

16. And if its not regression, he's
standing still, and that isn't good
enough for Shuggie Otis.
The title track, by the way,
"Freedom Flight," might
disconcert you, for it goes into
the realms of free-form jazz, not
at all the blues motif that he's
(and his father Johnny) are noted
for. I enjoyed his reverberating
guitar, but seems to lose its
central theme too often.

Its A Beautiful Day — "Choice
Quality Stuff/Anytime"
(Columbia KC 30734).
It was fortunate that my
roommate and I didn't hear, on
that October night two years ago,
that the first major
Crosby/Stills/Nash & Young
concert at Winterland was to be
cancelled due to the death of
Crosby's fiancee. Fortunate
because we rushed up to the City
ail hot and excited and were
served It's A Beautiful Day
instead.
The little "low-key" band from
the City and Marin simply
proceeded to blow us right up
into the sky. It was one of those
nights when I stumbled out of
Winterland absolutely spinning
from the power and creativity of a
rock band.
In fact, since their albums are
equally mesmerizing on a slightly
different plane, I'm even
perversely glad that almost
nobody listens to them, or even
takes them half-seriously. Ha Ha.
Those fools.
Their first release, entitled "It's
A Beautiful Day" (Columbia CS
9768) with the white-rock girl
standing on the album cover, was
on the stands a week or two
before that concert. Sales were
helped because their hit single,
"White Bird" (eventually
destroyed by AM radio just as The
Doors' "Light My Fire" was
reduced to a "short" version),
keynoted the production.
'White Bird'
If people have heard of The
Day, it's because of "White Bird";
while that's justly so, it would be
as great a mistake to judge
Santana simply on the basis of
"Soul Sacrifice" or "Jingo." But
the song is a technical
masterpiece, lacing a clear organ
backing to a perfectly controlled
Hal Wagenet acoustic guitar,
bonded together by the David
LaFlamme violin and the Pattie
Santos/LaFlamme vocals. Much of
their first album is in the "White
Bird" motif.
The following summer they
released their second album,
"Marrying Maiden" (Columbia CS
1058), which was a nigh-on
disaster in terms of sales and FM
airplay. But it's also their best,
their most exquisite offering,
proving nothing so much as that
these musicians are among the
most talented and creative in rock
music.
k 'Don and Dewey" features
Fred Webb's organ work with a
madcap LaFlamme violin. Fred
Neil's "The Dolphins" follows
with some of the smoothest vocal
work to rival the "American
Beauty" Dead. "Hoedown"
follows that, featuring Jerry
Garcia on country banjo (the first
and only time on the album)

against a soaring LaFlamme fiddle
and a thumping stand-up bass of
Mitchell Holman. Poco's new
"Hoedown" sounds positively
amateurish alongside this.
Perfectly enunciated vocals
(listen how they sing the word
"mountain") highlight
"Soapstone Mountain" but
they're curiously slapped into a
hard-rock coalescence, which
soars to a stunning electric
crescendo and then cuts out
entirely, leaving the wonderful
vocals once again.

Tour-I)e-Forces
"Galileo" and "Do You
Remember The Sun" are the
"musically intellectual"
tour-de-forces on this album,
combining riffs and styles from
nearly every mode of music—off
the top of my head 1 can think of
flamenco guitar, classical violin
passages, church organ bars, even
a snatch of a jazzy nightclub
interlude. Try and listen to these
songs wrecked, and you'll see

what we're talking about.
But another year has passed in
which The Day became frequent
headliners at the Fillmore West. I
was only able to catch one of
their shows (actually an
appearance at the Fillmore East),
and the impression 1 got was one
of a hard-driving band utilizing
flashes of their brilliant
musicianship. They still
demonstrated that they are almost
classic students of music; they
know how to create all types
extremely proficiently.

many brilliant flashes on this
album. Shuggie's very good—just
listen to that guitar flash on
"Purple"—but his artistry only
comes in spurts and snorts.
I'd rather he concentrated on
developing his guitar technique
and included more of his fine, fine
blues runs on this album. Instead
he's mixed himself into playing
every instrument on several
selections (on "Strawberry Letter"
he does the vocal, guitars, organ,
piano, bass drums, sleigh, and
orchestra bells, and background
vocals) and the effect is just
ordinary; not one element is
especially breathtaking, the way
his works should be.
Occasionally Shuggie shines
with a brilliance; listen to his bass
runs on "Ice Cold Daydream," or
his tack piano on "Sweet Thang,"
or his wonderful vocals on "Me
and My Woman."
If there's a fault to this album
it's that he's regressed a bit since
that legendary first album at age

16. And if its not regression, he's
standing still, and that isn't good
enough for Shuggie Otis.
The title track, by the way,
"Freedom Flight," might
disconcert you, for it goes into
the realms of free-form jazz, not
at all the blues motif that he's
(and his father Johnny) are noted
for. I enjoyed his reverberating
guitar, but seems to lose its
central theme too often.

Its A Beautiful Day — "Choice
Quality Stuff/Anytime"
(Columbia KC 30734).
It was fortunate that my
roommate and I didn't hear, on
that October night two years ago,
that the first major
Crosby/Stills/Nash & Young
concert at Winterland was to be
cancelled due to the death of
Crosby's fiancee. Fortunate
because we rushed up to the City
ail hot and excited and were
served It's A Beautiful Day
instead.
The little "low-key" band from
the City and Marin simply
proceeded to blow us right up
into the sky. It was one of those
nights when I stumbled out of
Winterland absolutely spinning
from the power and creativity of a
rock band.
In fact, since their albums are
equally mesmerizing on a slightly
different plane, I'm even
perversely glad that almost
nobody listens to them, or even
takes them half-seriously. Ha Ha.
Those fools.
Their first release, entitled "It's
A Beautiful Day" (Columbia CS
9768) with the white-rock girl
standing on the album cover, was
on the stands a week or two
before that concert. Sales were
helped because their hit single,
"White Bird" (eventually
destroyed by AM radio just as The
Doors' "Light My Fire" was
reduced to a "short" version),
keynoted the production.
'White Bird'
If people have heard of The
Day, it's because of "White Bird";
while that's justly so, it would be
as great a mistake to judge
Santana simply on the basis of
"Soul Sacrifice" or "Jingo." But
the song is a technical
masterpiece, lacing a clear organ
backing to a perfectly controlled
Hal Wagenet acoustic guitar,
bonded together by the David
LaFlamme violin and the Pattie
Santos/LaFlamme vocals. Much of
their first album is in the "White
Bird" motif.
The following summer they
released their second album,
"Marrying Maiden" (Columbia CS
1058), which was a nigh-on
disaster in terms of sales and FM
airplay. But it's also their best,
their most exquisite offering,
proving nothing so much as that
these musicians are among the
most talented and creative in rock
music.
k 'Don and Dewey" features
Fred Webb's organ work with a
madcap LaFlamme violin. Fred
Neil's "The Dolphins" follows
with some of the smoothest vocal
work to rival the "American
Beauty" Dead. "Hoedown"
follows that, featuring Jerry
Garcia on country banjo (the first
and only time on the album)

against a soaring LaFlamme fiddle
and a thumping stand-up bass of
Mitchell Holman. Poco's new
"Hoedown" sounds positively
amateurish alongside this.
Perfectly enunciated vocals
(listen how they sing the word
"mountain") highlight
"Soapstone Mountain" but
they're curiously slapped into a
hard-rock coalescence, which
soars to a stunning electric
crescendo and then cuts out
entirely, leaving the wonderful
vocals once again.

Tour-I)e-Forces
"Galileo" and "Do You
Remember The Sun" are the
"musically intellectual"
tour-de-forces on this album,
combining riffs and styles from
nearly every mode of music—off
the top of my head 1 can think of
flamenco guitar, classical violin
passages, church organ bars, even
a snatch of a jazzy nightclub
interlude. Try and listen to these
songs wrecked, and you'll see

what we're talking about.
But another year has passed in
which The Day became frequent
headliners at the Fillmore West. I
was only able to catch one of
their shows (actually an
appearance at the Fillmore East),
and the impression 1 got was one
of a hard-driving band utilizing
flashes of their brilliant
musicianship. They still
demonstrated that they are almost
classic students of music; they
know how to create all types
extremely proficiently.

Their new album "Choice
Quality Stuff/Anytime" is a
slightly disheartening reflection of
that status. They're very good, I
suppose, as a hard-driving rock
band, but that simply isn't why I
have great admiration for them.
But once again the recording is
impeccable, although The Day
switched from Wally Heider's and
Pacific High Recording Studios to
the new Columbia studios in San
Francisco.

"Creed of Love" begins the
"Choice Quality Stuff" side. If
you like the Papa John Creech
violin on the electric Hot Tuna
album, you'll just love the
LaFlamme pyrotechnics here,
screeching, piercing, but
controlled all the way through the
high registers. Occasionally a
mellow mouth harp adds some
wah-wahs to the steady, driving
beat.
'Bye, Bye, Baby'
Fred Webb's piano dances over
an even faster beat on "Bye Bye
Baby." You'll find excellent blues
violin here from LaFlamme, but
his vocals are subpar and the beat
unchanging. Note Webb's Lee
Michaels-style organ on "Grand
Camel Suits."
"No World For Glad" is
magnificent in the style of
"Marrying Maiden." The vocals are
smoother and mellower, with
Pattie Santos responding to
LaFlamme in the old way. And
the piano work? Superb!
If you think "Words" sounds a
little like Santana is playing,
you're not far off. Jose "Chepito"
Areas contributes on the timbales
and Coke Escovedo on the congas.
Rhythmic changes in the vocals
are handled well, but the
LaFlamme violin comes off
second-best to Carlos Santana's
guitar. On the whole, a moving,
driving side but without the
brilliante of the "Marrying
Maiden" musicianship. Nobody
really shows how very good they
are.
The "Anytime" side is a little
quieter. The classical violin and
tinkling piano provide interest,
but once again the drumming and
bass work are too ordinary on
"Place of Dreams."
Real Treat
"Oranges and Apples" is a real
treat, however. Webb's organ,
harpsichord, and French horn is in
a word, lovely, and the bass
(about time!) thumps the whole
house. Just try turning that bass
up, I dare you! LaFlamme's violin

perfectly complements the
moving, almost trilling
harpsichord.
Horns highlight "Anytime"
and the vocals are more
challenging; LaFlamme and
Santos have to work to sing this
one. A very pleasing song, on the
par with their best efforts. And
they prove once again that they
can hold a note till it starts singing
by itself.
"Bitter Wine" and "Misery
Loves Company" would be good
songs for they move well, but
they feature miserably uninspired
lyrics. And that's just a shame,
because The Day are still able to
put more musicianship into an
album than most rock groups.
Why they wasted their time with
some of this material is
inexplicable. If only it had the
quality of "Oranges & Apples"
throughout. After all, it's pretty
difficult to wait a year between
releases—and then to find out
they should have waited just a
little longer.
"Freedom Flight"— Shuggie
Otis—Epic E-30752
I believe that this is Shuggie's
second solo album. Shuggie's only

17 or 18 now, so by the time he's
finished, he's gonna have said one
hell of a lot. "Freedom Flight"
isn't as spell-binding as his first
"Here Comes Shuggie Otis,"
probably because there aren't as
many brilliant flashes on this
album. Shuggie's very good—just
listen to that guitar flash on

Neil's "The Dolphins" follows
with some of the smoothest vocal
work to rival the "American
Beauty" Dead. "Hoedown"
follows that, featuring Jerry
Garcia on country banjo (the first
and only time on the album)

against a soaring LaFlamme fiddle
and a thumping stand-up bass of
Mitchell Holman. Poco's new
"Hoedown" sounds positively
amateurish alongside this.
Perfectly enunciated vocals
(listen how they sing the word
"mountain") highlight
"Soapstone Mountain" but
they're curiously slapped into a
hard-rock coalescence, which
soars to a stunning electric
crescendo and then cuts out
entirely, leaving the wonderful
vocals once again.

Tour-I)e-Forces
"Galileo" and "Do You
Remember The Sun" are the
"musically intellectual"
tour-de-forces on this album,
combining riffs and styles from
nearly every mode of music—off
the top of my head 1 can think of
flamenco guitar, classical violin
passages, church organ bars, even
a snatch of a jazzy nightclub
interlude. Try and listen to these
songs wrecked, and you'll see

what we're talking about.
But another year has passed in
which The Day became frequent
headliners at the Fillmore West. I
was only able to catch one of
their shows (actually an
appearance at the Fillmore East),
and the impression 1 got was one
of a hard-driving band utilizing
flashes of their brilliant
musicianship. They still
demonstrated that they are almost
classic students of music; they
know how to create all types
extremely proficiently.

Their new album "Choice
Quality Stuff/Anytime" is a
slightly disheartening reflection of
that status. They're very good, I
suppose, as a hard-driving rock
band, but that simply isn't why I
have great admiration for them.
But once again the recording is
impeccable, although The Day
switched from Wally Heider's and
Pacific High Recording Studios to
the new Columbia studios in San
Francisco.

"Creed of Love" begins the
"Choice Quality Stuff" side. If
you like the Papa John Creech
violin on the electric Hot Tuna
album, you'll just love the
LaFlamme pyrotechnics here,
screeching, piercing, but
controlled all the way through the
high registers. Occasionally a
mellow mouth harp adds some
wah-wahs to the steady, driving
beat.
'Bye, Bye, Baby'
Fred Webb's piano dances over
an even faster beat on "Bye Bye
Baby." You'll find excellent blues
violin here from LaFlamme, but
his vocals are subpar and the beat
unchanging. Note Webb's Lee
Michaels-style organ on "Grand
Camel Suits."
"No World For Glad" is
magnificent in the style of
"Marrying Maiden." The vocals are
smoother and mellower, with
Pattie Santos responding to
LaFlamme in the old way. And
the piano work? Superb!
If you think "Words" sounds a
little like Santana is playing,
you're not far off. Jose "Chepito"
Areas contributes on the timbales
and Coke Escovedo on the congas.
Rhythmic changes in the vocals
are handled well, but the
LaFlamme violin comes off
second-best to Carlos Santana's
guitar. On the whole, a moving,
driving side but without the
brilliante of the "Marrying
Maiden" musicianship. Nobody
really shows how very good they
are.
The "Anytime" side is a little
quieter. The classical violin and
tinkling piano provide interest,
but once again the drumming and
bass work are too ordinary on
"Place of Dreams."
Real Treat
"Oranges and Apples" is a real
treat, however. Webb's organ,
harpsichord, and French horn is in
a word, lovely, and the bass
(about time!) thumps the whole
house. Just try turning that bass
up, I dare you! LaFlamme's violin

perfectly complements the
moving, almost trilling
harpsichord.
Horns highlight "Anytime"
and the vocals are more
challenging; LaFlamme and
Santos have to work to sing this
one. A very pleasing song, on the
par with their best efforts. And
they prove once again that they
can hold a note till it starts singing
by itself.
"Bitter Wine" and "Misery
Loves Company" would be good
songs for they move well, but
they feature miserably uninspired
lyrics. And that's just a shame,
because The Day are still able to
put more musicianship into an
album than most rock groups.
Why they wasted their time with
some of this material is
inexplicable. If only it had the
quality of "Oranges & Apples"
throughout. After all, it's pretty
difficult to wait a year between
releases—and then to find out
they should have waited just a
little longer.
"Freedom Flight"— Shuggie
Otis—Epic E-30752
I believe that this is Shuggie's
second solo album. Shuggie's only

17 or 18 now, so by the time he's
finished, he's gonna have said one
hell of a lot. "Freedom Flight"
isn't as spell-binding as his first
"Here Comes Shuggie Otis,"
probably because there aren't as
many brilliant flashes on this
album. Shuggie's very good—just
listen to that guitar flash on
"Purple"—but his artistry only
comes in spurts and snorts.
I'd rather he concentrated on
developing his guitar technique
and included more of his fine, fine
blues runs on this album. Instead
he's mixed himself into playing
every instrument on several
selections (on "Strawberry Letter"
he does the vocal, guitars, organ,
piano, bass drums, sleigh, and
orchestra bells, and background
vocals) and the effect is just
ordinary; not one element is
especially breathtaking, the way
his works should be.
Occasionally Shuggie shines
with a brilliance; listen to his bass
runs on "Ice Cold Daydream," or
his tack piano on "Sweet Thang,"
or his wonderful vocals on "Me
and My Woman."
If there's a fault to this album
it's that he's regressed a bit since
that legendary first album at age

16. And if its not regression, he's
standing still, and that isn't good
enough for Shuggie Otis.
The title track, by the way,
"Freedom Flight," might
disconcert you, for it goes into
the realms of free-form jazz, not
at all the blues motif that he's
(and his father Johnny) are noted
for. I enjoyed his reverberating
guitar, but seems to lose its
central theme too often.

Its A Beautiful Day — "Choice
Quality Stuff/Anytime"
(Columbia KC 30734).
It was fortunate that my
roommate and I didn't hear, on
that October night two years ago,
that the first major
Crosby/Stills/Nash & Young
concert at Winterland was to be
cancelled due to the death of
Crosby's fiancee. Fortunate
because we rushed up to the City
ail hot and excited and were
served It's A Beautiful Day
instead.
The little "low-key" band from
the City and Marin simply
proceeded to blow us right up
into the sky. It was one of those
nights when I stumbled out of
Winterland absolutely spinning
from the power and creativity of a
rock band.
In fact, since their albums are
equally mesmerizing on a slightly
different plane, I'm even
perversely glad that almost
nobody listens to them, or even
takes them half-seriously. Ha Ha.
Those fools.
Their first release, entitled "It's
A Beautiful Day" (Columbia CS
9768) with the white-rock girl
standing on the album cover, was
on the stands a week or two
before that concert. Sales were
helped because their hit single,
"White Bird" (eventually
destroyed by AM radio just as The
Doors' "Light My Fire" was
reduced to a "short" version),
keynoted the production.
'White Bird'
If people have heard of The
Day, it's because of "White Bird";
while that's justly so, it would be
as great a mistake to judge
Santana simply on the basis of
"Soul Sacrifice" or "Jingo." But
the song is a technical
masterpiece, lacing a clear organ
backing to a perfectly controlled
Hal Wagenet acoustic guitar,
bonded together by the David
LaFlamme violin and the Pattie
Santos/LaFlamme vocals. Much of
their first album is in the "White
Bird" motif.
The following summer they
released their second album,
"Marrying Maiden" (Columbia CS
1058), which was a nigh-on
disaster in terms of sales and FM
airplay. But it's also their best,
their most exquisite offering,
proving nothing so much as that
these musicians are among the
most talented and creative in rock
music.

(about time!) thumps the whole
house. Just try turning that bass
up, I dare you! LaFlamme's violin

perfectly complements the
moving, almost trilling
harpsichord.
Horns highlight "Anytime"
and the vocals are more
challenging; LaFlamme and
Santos have to work to sing this
one. A very pleasing song, on the
par with their best efforts. And
they prove once again that they
can hold a note till it starts singing
by itself.
"Bitter Wine" and "Misery
Loves Company" would be good
songs for they move well, but
they feature miserably uninspired
lyrics. And that's just a shame,
because The Day are still able to
put more musicianship into an
album than most rock groups.
Why they wasted their time with
some of this material is
inexplicable. If only it had the
quality of "Oranges & Apples"
throughout. After all, it's pretty
difficult to wait a year between
releases—and then to find out
they should have waited just a
little longer.
"Freedom Flight"— Shuggie
Otis—Epic E-30752
I believe that this is Shuggie's
second solo album. Shuggie's only

17 or 18 now, so by the time he's
finished, he's gonna have said one
hell of a lot. "Freedom Flight"
isn't as spell-binding as his first
"Here Comes Shuggie Otis,"
probably because there aren't as
many brilliant flashes on this
album. Shuggie's very good—just
listen to that guitar flash on
"Purple"—but his artistry only
comes in spurts and snorts.
I'd rather he concentrated on
developing his guitar technique
and included more of his fine, fine
blues runs on this album. Instead
he's mixed himself into playing
every instrument on several
selections (on "Strawberry Letter"
he does the vocal, guitars, organ,
piano, bass drums, sleigh, and
orchestra bells, and background
vocals) and the effect is just
ordinary; not one element is
especially breathtaking, the way
his works should be.
Occasionally Shuggie shines
with a brilliance; listen to his bass
runs on "Ice Cold Daydream," or
his tack piano on "Sweet Thang,"
or his wonderful vocals on "Me
and My Woman."
If there's a fault to this album
it's that he's regressed a bit since
that legendary first album at age

16. And if its not regression, he's
standing still, and that isn't good
enough for Shuggie Otis.
The title track, by the way,
"Freedom Flight," might
disconcert you, for it goes into
the realms of free-form jazz, not
at all the blues motif that he's
(and his father Johnny) are noted
for. I enjoyed his reverberating
guitar, but seems to lose its
central theme too often.
