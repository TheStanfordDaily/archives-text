# Cal Favored In Ink Classic
## 
### 
Tomorrow morning at 10 a.m.
on field six behind Maples
Pavilion, the Stanford Daily tests
its perfect season record in the
18th annual Ink Bowl against the
perennially pesky Daily
Californian from Berkeley. The
Tribe scribes, 0-5 on the year, are
currently 12-point underpens.
"We've piled up 26 points
during the '71 campaign spanning
five games. Last year, we scored
that much in two games," Ink
Bowl recidivist Hall Daily mused.
"Last winter, our defense gave up
only three touchdowns in eight
quarters. This year, let's see — 85
divided by six is .. ." the veteran
quarterback muttered.
The Daily, defending Ink Rose
Bowl champs (after blotting out
the Ohio State Daily Lantern, 8-0),
were overruled a year ago in
Berkeley, 22-18, after failing on
all three conversion attempts.
After that struggle, road
blocker Marshall Schwartz (who
plays only away games) praised
Daily's extra-point calling: "Well,
kid, at least you're consistent."
Daily go Daily, who is listed as
"doubtful" for this classic, will
coach the Cardinal pensmen. "I've
been watching Coach Purina on
the weekends and drawing plays
during classes. We've fielded a
strong team this year with the
exception of blockers, pass
receivers, and defensive backs,"
Daily confided.
"Along with Buz Battle, our
Snowmobile editor, and Cliff
Nancarrow, roving rugby reporter,
we'll unviel our secret weapons —
Trixie "National Velvet"
Boom boom, Lois Lane, and
Crusher Thunderthighs," Daily
revealed.
However, the loss of Ink Bowl
Hall-of-Famer Fred Mann, who
hauled in two touchdown passes
last year, may hurt the Red
journalists. At last report, news
editor Frank Miller was training

his "huge flying beast" to Bite
Oski. Inspiring rushes will be
expected from Steve "The Fly"
Ungar and cropped coverage is
assured by shuttering Joe Berman.
According to retired sports
editor Don "Tolly's Follies"
Tollefson, "No, we don't expect a
letdown against Cal. We're not
looking past any of our games this
year," the mean Swede frowned.
We'll make these Wolverines wish
they'd stayed in Urbana!" he
concluded.

Charlie "Hatchet" Hoffman,
sports editor and erstwhile pundit,
expects no trouble. "Give me a
nickle and I'll ovens 'em," he
chortled. "Yeah .. . really."
The Daily's kicking game will
boast several new features. In
addition to third world punting
by T.N.V. Boomboom, the
opinionated croquet style kicker
R. Bruce Litterman will dropkick
all field goals.
The Daily's final practice of
the regular season last night on W.
F. Durand's lighted asphal-turf
warm-up corner was termed a
"singular success" by the Stanford

Police Department.
Also tomorrow morning, the
ASSU (Financial Office, Council
of Presidents, and ASSU Senate)
will square off with a "cross
functional" team from ASUC at
10 a.m. on Field 8. Coach Tom
Huseby, who doubles in the
off-season as ASSU Financial
Manager, requested no ringers
from Cal in the Big Game Union
telephone confirmation. Cal hung
up.

IF YOU CROSS THAT LINE.. . YOU WON'T BE THE FIRST—In direct contradiction to the varsity's stingy attitude toward opponents, the
Daily defensive corps approaches every battle with charity in its hearts. The Tribe scribes have allowed an average of three touchdowns a game,
but THC Daily, Magic Beans Spector, Hatchet Hoffman, Mean Swede Tollefson, and Beast Miller have different ideas for tomorrow. Psyching
up for tomorrow's bowl game, The Fly Ungar missed Camera Day.
