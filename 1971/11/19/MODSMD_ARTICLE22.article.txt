# Prince Lightfoot Plays Dual Role For Tribe
## 
### DANIEL BRENNER 
During the week he is Harry D.
Timm Williams, an administrator
for the California Indian
Assistance Project in Sacramento.
But come football Saturdays, he is
Prince Lightfoot, reigning as
"mascot" for Stanford University
in full Indian regalia.
Tomorrow marks Williams'
20th year with the Stanford Band.
He is, as the announcer booms, a
full-blooded California Indian

and is "leading spokesman" for
his tribe of Yuroks who are
situated near the Klamath River
near Eureka.
His spirit for the Stanford
Indians is great; he has never
missed a home game since
becoming official "mascot."
About tomorrow's Big Game,
Lightfoot said, "I am sure we are
going to be up for it."
His optimism is also reflected
in his appraisal of San Jose's
victory over Stanford: "You may
call that win a fluke." And on
Rod Garcia's missed field goal, the
Prince philosophizes, "We
wouldn't be in the Rose Bowl if it
wasn't for his toe in the first
place."
His search for the brighter side
of things has dictated his career,
especially in regard to working to
improve the plight of the
forgotten Indian. He has been a

strident critic of the often
impotent Federal Bureau of
Indian Affairs in their denial of
rights to the Yuroks. He has
written and spoken about the
capricious style of relocation of
Indians by the Bureau and their
trade school emphasis in Indian
education.
His appointment to the
California Indian Assistance
Project was made by Governor
Reagan in March, 1971. Although
some minority leaders would
prefer to have nothing to do with
Reagan, Lightfoot believes that he
can do some good for his people.
Furthermore, he is encouraged
by the little-known fact that the
state of California leads the nation
in the number of minority
employees, a fact which he
attributes to the governor's tenure
in office.
"Speaking as an Indian, the

consideration the administration
has given to the Indians has been
responsive," he emphasized.
Among his tasks in the project
is to clarify current proposals and
responsibilities of each public
agency dealing with Indian affairs,
to develop plans of state action
for California's native Americans,
and to promote Indian economic
self sufficiency.
But out of his coat-and-tie
government costume and into his
native dress, Prince Lightfoot is
out to cheer Stanford on to
victory as the personification of
its symbol, the Indian.
He views his role of "mascot"
in a highly positive sense. He
believes that it symbolizes the
values of "honesty, truth, and
intelligence" of Indians. Just as
the native American has delivered
its agricultural bounty to the
nation, so Stanford brings the
nation its share of wisdom, he
said, with sincerity.
"I think it is quite an honor
that Stanford chooses an Indian as
its symbol," Prince Lightfoot
declared. Many California Indians
he has talked to think that

Stanford has become "their"
team.
The symbol of the Indian has
of course been much debated.
A year ago the Bookstore
stopped selling shirts with the
big-nosed Indian caricature. And
some persons have suggested that
having an Indian as a "mascot"—a
classification that usually conjures
up bears, lions, or bobcats—is a
racist, discriminatory attitude.
Lorenzo Stars, a native
American Student residing at the
Loro Indian house this year, sees
the issue as "half and half,"
accepting the Indian "as a symbol,
yes, and as a mascot, no."
Stars believes that the public
misuses the symbol of the Indian,
treating it as validation of the
commercial, false Indian
stereotype portrayed in many
westerns.
Nevertheless, as tomorrow's
fans begin to melt into the
colorful cardstunts and noisy
cheers that make up a Big Game
crowd, Prince Lightfoot, alias
Timm Williams, will perform his
traditional dance, as he has done
for over five million spectators for
the last twenty vears.

Stars believes that the public
misuses the symbol of the Indian,
treating it as validation of the
commercial, false Indian
stereotype portrayed in many
westerns.
Nevertheless, as tomorrow's
fans begin to melt into the
colorful cardstunts and noisy
cheers that make up a Big Game
crowd, Prince Lightfoot, alias
Timm Williams, will perform his
traditional dance, as he has done
for over five million spectators for
the last twenty vears.
During the week he is Harry D.
Timm Williams, an administrator
for the California Indian
Assistance Project in Sacramento.
But come football Saturdays, he is
Prince Lightfoot, reigning as
"mascot" for Stanford University
in full Indian regalia.
Tomorrow marks Williams'
20th year with the Stanford Band.
He is, as the announcer booms, a
full-blooded California Indian

and is "leading spokesman" for
his tribe of Yuroks who are
situated near the Klamath River
near Eureka.
His spirit for the Stanford
Indians is great; he has never
missed a home game since
becoming official "mascot."
About tomorrow's Big Game,
Lightfoot said, "I am sure we are
going to be up for it."
His optimism is also reflected
in his appraisal of San Jose's
victory over Stanford: "You may
call that win a fluke." And on
Rod Garcia's missed field goal, the
Prince philosophizes, "We
wouldn't be in the Rose Bowl if it
wasn't for his toe in the first
place."
His search for the brighter side
of things has dictated his career,
especially in regard to working to
improve the plight of the
forgotten Indian. He has been a

strident critic of the often
impotent Federal Bureau of
Indian Affairs in their denial of
rights to the Yuroks. He has
written and spoken about the
capricious style of relocation of
Indians by the Bureau and their
trade school emphasis in Indian
education.
His appointment to the
California Indian Assistance
Project was made by Governor
Reagan in March, 1971. Although
some minority leaders would
prefer to have nothing to do with
Reagan, Lightfoot believes that he
can do some good for his people.
Furthermore, he is encouraged
by the little-known fact that the
state of California leads the nation
in the number of minority
employees, a fact which he
attributes to the governor's tenure
in office.
"Speaking as an Indian, the

consideration the administration
has given to the Indians has been
responsive," he emphasized.
Among his tasks in the project
is to clarify current proposals and
responsibilities of each public
agency dealing with Indian affairs,
to develop plans of state action
for California's native Americans,
and to promote Indian economic
self sufficiency.
But out of his coat-and-tie
government costume and into his
native dress, Prince Lightfoot is
out to cheer Stanford on to
victory as the personification of
its symbol, the Indian.
He views his role of "mascot"
in a highly positive sense. He
believes that it symbolizes the
values of "honesty, truth, and
intelligence" of Indians. Just as
the native American has delivered
its agricultural bounty to the
nation, so Stanford brings the
nation its share of wisdom, he
said, with sincerity.
"I think it is quite an honor
that Stanford chooses an Indian as
its symbol," Prince Lightfoot
declared. Many California Indians
he has talked to think that

Stanford has become "their"
team.
The symbol of the Indian has
of course been much debated.
A year ago the Bookstore
stopped selling shirts with the
big-nosed Indian caricature. And
some persons have suggested that
having an Indian as a "mascot"—a
classification that usually conjures
up bears, lions, or bobcats—is a
racist, discriminatory attitude.
Lorenzo Stars, a native
American Student residing at the
Loro Indian house this year, sees
the issue as "half and half,"
accepting the Indian "as a symbol,
yes, and as a mascot, no."
Stars believes that the public
misuses the symbol of the Indian,
treating it as validation of the
commercial, false Indian
stereotype portrayed in many
westerns.
