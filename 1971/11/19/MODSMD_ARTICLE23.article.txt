# Indians Go After The Axe
## 
### 
Stanford will try to get the
Axe away from the Bears
tomorrow when the two rivals
meet in the 74th edition of the
Big Game beginning at 1:30 p.m.
in Stanford Stadium.
The Indians lead 33-30-10 in
the glorious series which began
back in 1892. Cal upset the Pac-8
champions last year in Berkeley
22-14. In a quarterback's battle,
Dave Penhall threw for 231 yards
and 18 completions while
Heisman Trophy winner Jim
Plunkett completed 20 passes for
280 yards. But the Cards could
not capitalize on several scoring
opportunities and the Bears took
the Axe away from the Farm.
The Bears will be lead by
quarterback Jay Cruze who has
piloted them to four last minute
victories against Pac-8 teams.
Reed Chastang has recovered from
an early season injury and started
for the Bears last week against
Oregon but was replaced just
before the end of the first half by
Cruze who led the squad to 17-10
upset win. Cruze is a fine passer
with a 119 yard per game average.
Cal boasts the finest pair of
receivers statistically in the Pac-8.
Geoff DeLapp leads the
conference with 45 receptions for
445 yards and Steve Sweeney
ranks fourth with 35 catches and
531 yards.

The Bear's fine passing attack
is balanced by a solid running
game paced by Steve Kemnitzer
who rates seventh in the
conference with a per game
rushing average of 65 yards. Isaac
Curtis moves over from his wide
receiver position frequently to do
some running for Cal and is in
tenth place in the Pac-8 rushing
statistics with an average of 49
yards per game. The versatile
Curtis also returns kickoffs and is
the third best in the league in that
category.
The Cal offensive is very
explosive but it ranks last in the
Pac-8 total offense statistics with
an average of 269. In sharp
contrast is the Indians' league
leading total offensive output of
376 yards.
Berkeley's defense is anchored
by the feasome Sherman White
who weighs in at 250 pounds and
has made 67 tackles from his
tackle positiion. O.Z. White's
absence will probably hamper the
Bear's defensive effort.
Stanford's injury situation is
less favorable than Cal's in that
Hillary Shockley, Tom Sones,
and Roger Cowan will miss the
Big Game. Shockley reinjured his
sprained ankle last week and will
join Sones and Cowan on the
sidelines. Cowan is suffering from
a virus infection that will also

keep him out of uniform. Randy
Poltl suffered a slight shoulder
dislocation, against San Jose State
but might see action tomorrow.
Mike Kloos played well last week
in Poltl's position, grabbing one
interception, and will start at the
strong safety position tomorrow.
Don Bunce was held out of
contact in Wednesday's drill

because of a slight hip pointer he
received in the San Jose State
game, but he participated in
contact work yesterday and will
be ready for the Bears.
The Indians are favored by
13'/2 points to win the Axe back
tomorrow, but if this year's Big
Game is true to its hectic heritage,
no odds can be relied upon.

WHERE DID THEY GO?—Reggie Sanderson looks downfield for potential tacklers as Jackie Brown and
Younger Klippert give him protection. Sanderson will start for the Cards tomorrow in Hillary Shockley's
place. Reggie has a 4.7 yard average per carry and has run for a total of 307 yards, second on the team.
The most outstanding play he has been involved in this season was the lateral he took from Don Bunce
against USC and ran 80 yards with it for a touchdown.
