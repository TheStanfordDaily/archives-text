## 
### 
On a windy day at Sproul Plaza, Cal shut out the Stanford hurlers
in the second annual Big Game frisbee contest. Over 300 spectators
looked on yesterday afternoon as the Berkeleyites swept all four
events en route to their second straight discus title.
In the straight accuracy test, where a six by six foot square is
positioned two feet off the ground 25 yards from the throwers, Cal
outpointed Stanford, 23-6. Bob Sellers picked up the most points for
the Cards.
Bill Elliot led the Indians in the medley competition, although the
Bears won again, 12-7. In the straight distance event, Sellers finished
third with a 70 yard toss. Scott Oswald and Kit Keyes of Stanford
both hurled the disc over 50 yards.
In the "Guts" competition, southpaws Irwin Adler and Bob
Coleman, and Don "Doades" Borchers carried the Tribe pitchers to a
first game 22-20 win. "Guts" is a contest in which four teammates
stand side by side fourty feet from the opposition and throw as hard
as they can until someone drops the frisbee. Cal swept the second set,
8-21. The lead changed hands several times in the deciding set with
cal winning, 18-21.
