Stanford is going towintheßig
Game tomorrow.
That may sound foolishly
confident in light of the Indians'
erratic play this season and the
established tradition of the Big
Game in which upset and the
unexpected reign.
Last year, the bowl bound
Indians were upset by a Cal squad
that was struggling to have a
winning season. Statistically,
Stanford should have chased the
Bears out of Memorial Stadium,
but Cal had the incentive of eking
out a winning season and gaining
the distinction of being the only
Pac-8 team to beat the conference
champs. The Bears had nothing to
lose and their play displayed that
attitude.
Cal has even a greater incentive
this year in that a victory over
Stanford would give them the
mythical conference
championship that could be
legitimized by a federal court
decision and a Pac-8 ruling. Even
if Larry Brumsey and Isaac Curtis
lose their suit against the NCAA, a
Cal win on Saturday would taint
the Indians' Rose Bowl bid.
The press has been speculating
all week on the possibilities of the
Bears supplanting Stanford as the
Pac-B's Rose Bowl representative.
Curtis and Brumsey's lawyer, Stan
Sanders, gives the athletes a 50-50

chance to win their suit against
the NCAA on the grounds that
the 1.6 rule discriminates against
blacks. If the federal court rules in
favor of the plaintiffs, the Pac-8
would have to meet to consider
whether it sees fit to lift its
penalty on Cal for playing the
suspended athletes. If the Bears
win the Big Game and are restored
to full conference status, they will
meet Michigan in the Rose Bowl.
Stanford Fired Up
No one knows this better than
the Stanford team. While Cal has
used the court action to raise its
hopes and spirit for the Big Game,
the Indians have been doing the
same thing. John Ralston's men
know that they must win
tomorrow's game in order to
render their hard fought bowl bid
untouchable. A loss in the Big
Game would make the players
wait for at least a week to see
what they will be doing on
January Ist.
The Indians do not want
someone else to decide their post
season fate, and they will decide
the issue on the field tomorrow.
The precedent that has the most
bearing on this year's Big Game is
the fact that Stanford has won
every "must" game during the
past two seasons. Although the
Indians have had the talent to win
them all, they have stumbled in

Charlie Hoffman

the unimportant contests. Because
of recent court action, the Indians
have been forced into the position
of having to win this one, and if
they maintain the pattern of the
last two years, they will not falter
now.
Fickle Fans
Fans this season have found
the team hard to follow and
support. Maybe it is time,
however, to begin believing in the
fact that this Stanford squad has
won when it had to. A Stanford
loss tomorrow would break a well
established two year precedent. I
find it hard to accept that the
Indians will let the Pac-8
chamionship slip from their grasp,
and even though they will be
involved in the perenially upset
dominated Big Game series, I
think that they will legitimize
their crown tomorrow.

An 85,000 plus crowd in
Stanford Stadium will be greeted
by an alien sight when the Cards
come onto the field in their white
road uniforms. The players have
the option of choosing their
jerseys, since the Bears always
wear their Blue and Gold
uniforms. The Indian's white
jerseys have had great success this
season, as the team has won all
five games in which they have
worn them.

The Indians do not want
someone else to decide their post
season fate, and they will decide
the issue on the field tomorrow.
The precedent that has the most
bearing on this year's Big Game is
the fact that Stanford has won
every "must" game during the
past two seasons. Although the
Indians have had the talent to win
them all, they have stumbled in

Charlie Hoffman

the unimportant contests. Because
of recent court action, the Indians
have been forced into the position
of having to win this one, and if
they maintain the pattern of the
last two years, they will not falter
now.
Fickle Fans
Fans this season have found
the team hard to follow and
support. Maybe it is time,
however, to begin believing in the
fact that this Stanford squad has
won when it had to. A Stanford
loss tomorrow would break a well
established two year precedent. I
find it hard to accept that the
Indians will let the Pac-8
chamionship slip from their grasp,
and even though they will be
involved in the perenially upset
dominated Big Game series, I
think that they will legitimize
their crown tomorrow.

An 85,000 plus crowd in
Stanford Stadium will be greeted
by an alien sight when the Cards
come onto the field in their white
road uniforms. The players have
the option of choosing their
jerseys, since the Bears always
wear their Blue and Gold
uniforms. The Indian's white
jerseys have had great success this
season, as the team has won all
five games in which they have
worn them.
Stanford is going towintheßig
Game tomorrow.
That may sound foolishly
confident in light of the Indians'
erratic play this season and the
established tradition of the Big
Game in which upset and the
unexpected reign.
Last year, the bowl bound
Indians were upset by a Cal squad
that was struggling to have a
winning season. Statistically,
Stanford should have chased the
Bears out of Memorial Stadium,
but Cal had the incentive of eking
out a winning season and gaining
the distinction of being the only
Pac-8 team to beat the conference
champs. The Bears had nothing to
lose and their play displayed that
attitude.
Cal has even a greater incentive
this year in that a victory over
Stanford would give them the
mythical conference
championship that could be
legitimized by a federal court
decision and a Pac-8 ruling. Even
if Larry Brumsey and Isaac Curtis
lose their suit against the NCAA, a
Cal win on Saturday would taint
the Indians' Rose Bowl bid.
The press has been speculating
all week on the possibilities of the
Bears supplanting Stanford as the
Pac-B's Rose Bowl representative.
Curtis and Brumsey's lawyer, Stan
Sanders, gives the athletes a 50-50

chance to win their suit against
the NCAA on the grounds that
the 1.6 rule discriminates against
blacks. If the federal court rules in
favor of the plaintiffs, the Pac-8
would have to meet to consider
whether it sees fit to lift its
penalty on Cal for playing the
suspended athletes. If the Bears
win the Big Game and are restored
to full conference status, they will
meet Michigan in the Rose Bowl.
Stanford Fired Up
No one knows this better than
the Stanford team. While Cal has
used the court action to raise its
hopes and spirit for the Big Game,
the Indians have been doing the
same thing. John Ralston's men
know that they must win
tomorrow's game in order to
render their hard fought bowl bid
untouchable. A loss in the Big
Game would make the players
wait for at least a week to see
what they will be doing on
January Ist.
