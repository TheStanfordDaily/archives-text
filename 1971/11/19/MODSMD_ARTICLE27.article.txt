# Mac Donald Runs In NCAA
## 
### MIKE CHASSON 
The Cross-country season
officially ends next Monday as
Coach Marshall Clark and Duncan
Macdonald travel to the
University of Tennessee for the
NCAA Championships.
Macdonald, who suffered a
strep throat at the Pacific Eight
Championships, is now fully
recovered. According to Clark he
was running as good as ever by
Tuesday afternoon.
Macdonald is the only Indian
runner going to the NCAA
Championships, and it is hoped he
will make Ail-American. To
accomplish this he must finish in
the top 25 at Tennessee. Clark
stated, "I believe Duncan has a
good chance to finish in the top
25 or he wouldn't be going. If ho
manages to stay healthy he should
do well."
Season Review
In reviewing the season Clark
stated, "It was hard to believe the
finish." He attributes the Indians
poor showing at the Pacific Eight

Championships to a loss of
confidence by the younger
members of the team. This
occurred because Macdonald, Coe,
and Kretz were ill or injured.
Clark stated, "The team didn't
believe they could do well
without these top runners in good
form."
In terms of the future, Clark
believes that the air of
invincibility that surrounded
Stanford in regards to UCLA and
SC is now gone, as a result of the
Pacific Eight meet. Those schools
now know that they can beat
Stanford, where as before they
were unsure, because Stanford
had beaten them so many times in
the past.
Top Men Depart
The best runners from this
years squad are all graduating.
They are Duncan Macdonald,
Arvid Kretz, Robert Coe, and
Bernie Lahde. Clark stated, "It
will be up to the returning runners
how good we will be next year."
Clark believes the returning

runners have a great deal of
potential, but they must decide
how much work they are going to
do. Basically this means how
much running they will do during
the summer. If they are willing to
do the work they should do well.
