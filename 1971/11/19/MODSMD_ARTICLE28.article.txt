Rehnquist Receives Boost
WASHINGTON — The Senate Judiciary Committee
rejected 10 to 5 yesterday a liberal Democratic move to
reopen its hearings on the Supreme Court nomination of
William H. Rehnquist.
By an identical vote it also refused to separate
Rehnquist's nomination from that of Lewis F. Powell Jr.,
for a second vacancy on the court.
The committee agreed to meet again next Tuesday and
to vote then on the nominations of both Rehnquist and
Powell, who were selected by President Nixon on Oct. 21
to replace retired Justice John M. Harlan and the late
Justice Hugo L. Black.
This appeared to clear the way for bringing the
nominations up in the Senate shortly after the
Thanksgiving recess.
Powell, 64, a Richmond, Va., lawyer and former
president of the American Bar Association, has not been
affected by the controversy that developed over the
nomination of Rehnquist, 47, a former Phoenix, Ariz.,
lawyer and now an assistant attorney general.
Supporters of both nominations, in a clear majority on
the committee, have insisted on acting on both at the same
time.
Regents Override Protests
SAN FRANCISCO — A University of California Regents'
committee overrode student protests yesterday and voted
to spend $3.2 million from student fees on buildings rather
than scholarships and loans.
Last month, the regents voted to spend $19 million
from student fees for building new classrooms, libraries,
laboratories and other facilities and UC President Charles
Hitch wanted the additional $3.2 million in unallocated
funds to go for building too.
US Ups Cambodian Aid
SAIGON — With the military situation becoming critical in
Cambodia, U.S. warplanes have stepped up their support of
Cambodian troops, official American sources reported
yesterday.
Reports circulated in Saigon that the South Vietnamese
government was considering a Cambodian request for
infantry and heavy weapons for the defense of Phnom
Penh. Hand-to-hand fighting was reported near the western
outskirts of the Cambodian capital.

Dispatches from Phnom Penh reported U.S. Cobra
helicopter gunships have been thrown into the battle raging
from 10 to 12 miles west of the capital.
The U.S. sources said the Cambodians have been getting
substantially more American air support in the last 10 days.
The increased support has been mainly U.S.
fighter-bombers, flying from bases in South Vietnam and
Thailand, the informants reported. The planes have been
active on Cambodia's northeastern front.
Weather Shift Cuts Smog
BIRMINGHAM, Ala. — The air pollution crisis in this
industrial city was eased yesterday by changing weather
patterns, but 23 major industries were preparing to cease
operations under a federal court order.
John White, director of the Environmental Protection
Agency's regional enforcement division, said his staff would
decide this morning whether to ask a federal judge to lift
the shutdown order, depending on the effectiveness of the
shift in weather.
County health officials said there was no marked
increase in respiratory patients admitted to local hospitals.
Persons with respiratory and heart ailments had been
warned to stay indoors and avoid exercise during the air
pollution crisis.
Castro Counsels Caution
CONCEPTION, Chile — Fidel Castro advised Chilean
students yesterday to take it easy on the road to socialism.
The visiting Cuban prime minister spoke at the
University of Conception, a center of ultra-leftist groups
which criticize President Salvador Allende's government as
not revolutionary enough.
Castro, in a two-hour dialogue with 3,000 students,
urged them to support Allende's methods. The Chilean
chiet has called for building of socialism through peaceful
means—different than those that brought Castro to power.
"Leftist groups of all hues and colors must unite and
agree on four or five principal points in order to defeat the
imperialist forces," Castro said.
Castro invited students one at a time to the dais.
One asked if Castro thought Allende's government was
truly revolutionary or just "a reformist administration."
"I can categorically and sincerely say that a
revolutionary process has been started in Chile,"* Castro
replied. "A revolutionary process is not a revolution. It is
just an initial phase."
