# Dolly Says He Was Trapped

Suspended hospital worker John
Dolly said yesterday at his grievance
hearing that he did not willingly remain
in the occupied administrative offices
before police cleared the area to end
the April 8-9 Hospital sit-in.
Dolly said he had been working at
his job at the Hospital most of the day,
and had gone to the sit-in to tell his
wife he would be working late.
But by the time they decided to
leave, the exits had been barricaded by
the demonstrators and there was no
way out. Consequently, Dolly and his
wife were caught in the police charge.

The reason he stayed, Dolly said,
was that his wife was two months
pregnant and he worried about her
condition. It was "not a political
judgment on my part," Dolly said of
remaining in the area. Rather, he said,
it was a concern that his wife be led out
of the area safely.
Several witnesses corroborated
various parts of Dolly's story, most
placing him away from the sit-in about
45 minutes before the police charge.
Some witnesses testified that Dolly had
no knowledge that negotiations had
been broken off, that the sit-in had
been declared illegal, or of rumors that

police were on the way.
Although claiming he did not remain
in the area voluntarily, Dolly said this
does not mean he disagreed with what
went on, adding he thought that if the
demonstrators had been able to hold
off the police for about two hours,
there might have been a chance for a
negotiated settlement.
A tape, belonging to KZSU, was also
played which recorded the action of
police in moving observers of the
demonstration back behind closed
doors. Grievance committee member
Juan Flores, a professor of German,
noted the tape ''brings out the
frustration of the crowd ... the
frustration over the irrationality of this
military approach."
