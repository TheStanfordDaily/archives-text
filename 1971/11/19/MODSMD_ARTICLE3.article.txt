# Lyman Action Expected
## Senate Refuses SJC Support 
### BOB MICHELET 
The Student Senate last night once again refused to
appoint three student members to the selection committee
for the Stanford Judicial Council, thus paving the way for
President Lyman to create a new, interim system.
Responding to an ultimatum from Lyman that the
Senate either begin the long-delayed selection process for
student SJC members or have the President set up the
system himself, the Senate voted 13 to 12 (with one
abstention) not to appoint the students.
Lyman is now expected to break the current deadlock
over the SJC by some action, but the administration will
not say what is contemplated.
University Legal Adviser James Siena, who appeared
before the Senate to present the administration's case, said
after the vote "we have not finally decided what it is going
to look like ... and we're not going to hold out the
alternatives so the Senate can pick and choose between
what is offered and the present system."
Grievance Model Expected
Well-informed sources expressed the feeling, however,
that Lyman plans to establish an arbitration system similar
to one recently instituted to hear staff grievances. Cases
would be heard by outside hearing officers, backed up by a
review board of faculty and students.
After the vote to not appoint student members, the
Senate passed a resolution, 19-7, which read: "The Senate
encourages all students not to participate in President
Lyman's interim judicial procedure, pending Committee of
Fifteen recommendations for change in the SJC, as passed
by students last year."
According to one senator, resolution sponsors felt its
intent was to show "the Senate felt a definite distrust of
President Lyman." He elaborated, explaining that many
senators felt the President had ignored last spring's
referendum on SJC changes, and that the administration
had exhibited bad faith in much of its dealings over the
SJC.
In his remarks, Siena told the Senate "you have a
constitutional obligation to make the system work,"
meaning it should appoint the three students. And in
explaining the rationale for Presidential action, he added
"if the Senate does not meet the obligations, then the
President has his obligations."

Former A&SU President John Grube, newly appointed
liason between the administration and student government,
said the "overall issue" was one "of student participation in
university governance," and claimed the Senate's already
weak position would be further "undermined" by a refusal
to appoint the students.
Much of the debate centered on criticism of the SJC as
unfair and undemocratic and whether a Senate vote for
appointing members would amount to an endorsement of
the present system.
Council of Presidents member Doug McHenry said the
council campaigned last spring with the feeling that they
"did not want to see an SJC that was inherently unjust,"
and cited the reforms proposed in the referendum—and
presently under consideration by the Committee of Fifteen
(C-l s )—as a basis for an improved system.
Senator Willie Newberry said of the vote "we had to
make a decision on the basis of the responsibility we felt
we had to the students ... we could not say tonight."
Appointments Suggested
Some suggestions were made during debate to appoint
the three students, but instruct them to withhold
participation pending a clearer Senate opinion on what
changes should be made in the SJC.
Siena said, however, the administration "would view
dimly" any "half-hearted gestures" to skirt the issue. He
said, "we're not playing games," and several times
tempered his hard-line argument by calling for a
"good-faith agreement" by the Senate.
Senator Chris Hocker reported that two of the 13 voting
for the refusal did so in the belief that direct Presidential
action is the way to create a better judicial system. Such
action now seems imminent.
But the general mood of the Senate was one of irritation
over Lyman's ultimatum and a feeling that the Senate
should not urge participation in a system considered unfair.
In his letter to Senators last week, Lyman said "if the
SJC cannot be forced promptly ... then a different judicial
procedure will have to be established." If continuation of
the present system is not possible, Lyman said, "I will
institute a judicial procedure to remain in effect
until. . . the C-l 5 proposes a new system."
