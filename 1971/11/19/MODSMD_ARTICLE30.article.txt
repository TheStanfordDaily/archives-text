## Threat Credit Denied 
### LANG ATWOOD 
Venceremos central committee
members yesterday denied any
responsibility for the burning of a
motorcycle and bomb threats at
Lagunita Court Tuesday night.
Aaron Manganiello, central
committee chairman of the Redwood
City-based revolutionary organization,
also blasted the police and some
companies for trying to drive a wedge
between Venceremos members and
workers by blaming the organization
for a series of bomb threats at
peninsula industries in recent months.
"We are not making threats against
the people or the community in
general." stated suspended English
professor and central committee
member H. Bruce Franklin.
He explained that all the incidents
seemed to fit into a pattern intended to
intimidate workers and discredit the
organization by someone who knew the
systems and operations of the
organization fairly well.
Franklin reported that yesterday
just before he spoke at Menlo College
in Menlo Park, a bomb threat was

pnoned in by a woman who said she
was black and a member of
Venceremos. She reportedly said that if
Franklin was not allowed to speak, the
college would be bombed.
There was no attempt made by the
administration to stop him from
appearing, according to Franklin, and
almost no one in Venceremos knew he
was scheduled to speak at the school.
Central committee members don't
think that a Venceremos member is
responsible for the threats. Manganiello
said that continuous internal
investigations prevent any police
informers from reaching a position in
the organization from which they
might do damage.
Franklin put responsibility for the
Stanford incident on either the right
wing or the police. He said that the
owner of the damaged motorcycle did
not hold Venceremos responsible and
wants to find out who really did burn
it.
The central committee asked that if
anyone is threatened by someone
claiming to be from Venceremos they
should check with the organization,
