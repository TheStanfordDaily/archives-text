# Fire Damages History Corner
## 
### 
A quickly-extinguished
fire did approximately $750 damage to
a room in the basement of History
Corner yesterday afternoon.
According to the County fire
marshal on the scene, "We're assuming
that it was a pile of papers" in a
cardboard box left in the room which
ignited the blaze. It was reported at
about 3 p.m. yesterday. The cause of
the fire was still undetermined last
night, according to a fire department
spokesman.
The fire broke out in the southwest
corner of Room 200S, charring the
floor and wall and filling most of the
basement with smoke.
Two pumpers and a rescue unit were
sent to the building, but only one was
used. After extinguishing the blaze,
four oxygen-masked firemen entered
the room to open the windows, and a
large fan was set up in the hall to blow
the smoke out of the building.
One fireman, leaving the building,
remarked that the cause of the fire was
"452 degrees Farenheit," the
temperature at which paper ignites.
