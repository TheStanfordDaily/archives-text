# Vietnamese Cancel After Radical Threat
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
A campus visit by three prominent
South Vietnamese judges was cancelled
yesterday by State Department officials
after they learned of radical pledges to
"physically" disrupt the schedule of
private, informal meetings.
Kwonping Ho, a student and a
leader of the Third World Liberation
Front, told a noon rally, "We declare
that we have won a people's victory.
These people are too frightened to even
come and confront us."
Less than 100 spectators attended
the White Plaza rally, which was hastily
called last night when radicals learned
of the judges' impending visit.
The three judges, called officals of
"rather high stature" by a State
Department spokesman, included a
judge in the "secretariat of the
Supreme Court,"the director of legal
research for that court, and a judge in
the Saigon Court of Appeals.
Following a typical routine for
foreign visitors, the judges had been
scheduled to have lunch with Associate
Law School Dean Joseph Leininger and
several students. Then, they were to
briefly visit the Law School and the
East Asian collection in Hoover

Barbara M. Givan, the University's
Coordinator of Foreign Visitors, said
the group's State Department escort
called off the visit after Givan read
them an article from yesterday's Daily
about the planned protest.
"The decision was up to them. It
was a little appalling to be threatened"
with disruption, she said.
"It didn't seem like it would be a
very pleasant day," Givan added.
Blanche Moore, a Program Officer
for the State Department in San
Francisco, said that foreign "people of
high caliber" usually visit Berkeley,
Stanford, or both during such
"standard 30-day tours" of the U.S.
Speakers at the noon rally
denounced government-sponsored visits
to campus, which account for about 40
percent of the hundreds of foreign
guests at Stanford every year.
History Professor Hal Kahn said,
"Stanford remains open—not unlike a
whore—to the the imperialists in
Washington for their uses."
Katherine Barkley said the South
Vietnamese judges act as a "rubber
stamp," condoning torture and the
"rigged" election of President Thieu.
