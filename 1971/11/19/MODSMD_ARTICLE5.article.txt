# Correspondence On The Bonfire

Pollution Festival
Stanford University's annual
Fall Pollution Festival, commonly
referred to as the "big-game
bonfire", came a week too late
this year as far as the foot-ball
team was concerned; San Jose
State's Spartans effectively
bottled up a lackadaisical Indian
offense. After this loss to San Jose
State, the "big-game" with the
University of California at
Berkeley will be anti-climatic, to
say the least.
Let us consider, in all
seriousness, how spewing over
eight thousand pounds of
pollutants into our already
over-polluted air supply can help
our team's spirit. What is the
secret ingredient that gets our
boys up for their pigskin contest
with the California Bears the
following afternoon?
Could it be the six thousand
pounds of carbon monoxide gas
(CO) released by the fire? Would
the deadly poisonous CO gas
remind them of expressways,
commuting, and driving their
shiny new metal machines? And
of how the corporate elite, who
are Stanford's Trustees, direct an
economy which produces
pollution, over-consumption, and
genocide? (Ah, the joys of playing
for an elite institution like leland
junior u.. .)
Perhaps the spirit-raiser is the
two thousand pounds of organic
contaminants produced by the
fire. These unburned
hydrocarbons are a vital
ingredient necessary for the
production of our beloved
"photo-chemical smog", that
eye-irritating yellow-brown
blanket that covers the Bay ARea
most of the year.
Or maybe the secret is the
mere two hundred and forty
pounds of particulate matter
which the big fire releases into the
atmosphere; this visibility
reducing haze can be seen for
miles around — a sort of giant
smoke signal — showing that our

mighty "big red machine" means
business. So watch out California
Bears and Michigan Wolverines, if
our pigskin team doesn't get you,
maybe our pollution will, aw
Society for an extra course in the
area.
Well, gang, it's for you to
decide — which air pollutant does
the best job of raising "school
spirit" and "team spirit"? Or
maybe it is something else. Is it
the mindless consumption of
natural resources that turns our
boys on? Or the waste of human
time, energy and initiative? Who
knows?
Whatever. . . Let's all show our
support for the pigskinners, for
the Farm, and for the good
old-fashioned American way of
doing things by driving to the
Pollution Festival, smoking a few
more cigarettes, and tossing some
beer cans around the lakebed.

We are outraged by Associate
Dean Wright's blatantly unjust
deletion of Bruce Franklin's
course from the Winter Quarter
Time Schedule. We feel, with
Bruce and Eliss Carnochan, that
prejudgments should be avoided,
and Wright's action seems to us an
expression of bureaucratic
prejudgment on Bruce's guilt. We
find it, further, an ill-considered
attempt to manipulate the climate
of opinion on campus against
Bruce by giving political overtones
to a routine departmental
function.

Wright's use of the time factor
to explain his failure to consult
with the English Department
chairman is ludicrous. He could
indeed have reached Mr.
Carnochan before making his
decision if he was able to contact
him ten seconds afterward.
We demand that Bruce's course
be included in the Winter Quarter
offerings of the English
Department, in a special
supplement to the Time Schedule

We, the undersigned freshmen
residents of the Alondra house,
wish to lodge our own protest
against the upcoming "Big Game"
bonfire on Nov. 18.
We realize that the bonfire is a
tradition deeply entwined in
Stanford history. We further
realize that the bonfire, along
with the numerous other events
during the week preceeding the
Cal game, raises the espirit de
corps of the Stanford student
body as a whole (and the
freshmen in particular).
However, in light of today's
increasing concern regarding the
destruction of the environment by
mankind, we feel that the bonfire
is out of step with the wishes of
the majority of people.
"Big Game" bonfire advocates
have pointed out the fact that the
bonfire adds only an infinitesimal
amount of pollution to an already
polluted environment. True as this
may be, we feel that the
cancellation of the bonfire, or the
lack of support thereof, would
emphasize the fact that
conservation is as much a "grass
roots" problem as it is a problem
for* General Motors, Standard Oil,
et al, and being such a problem,
we should attack it at all possible
points.

We realize that this letter will
have little, if any, effect on the
eventual fate of the bonfire. The
bonfire, as it is with most
traditions, will not be abandoned
overnight. It will take the
enlightenment of and subsequent
action by a collected body, the
Stanford community, to break
tradition and stop this small, but
needless, threat to our
environment.

Editor, THE DAILY:
This is a partial response to
David Barnum's letter of Nov. 5
which challenged anyone to
defend the Big-Game bonfire. I
am not about to do that; I think
the bonfire should be an obsolete
tradition, with or without
ecological considerations thrown
in. However, I'm aware that some
people seem to dig bonfires, and
I'm not so arrogant to try to force
my personal preferences on
everyone else.
Whatl do want to do is
comment on two of Barnum's
points concerning the air
pollution aspects of the bonfire.
(For reference, I was the leader of
the SWOPSI workshop that
published a massive report on Air
Pollution in the San Francisco
Bay Area last year.)
First, Barnum states that the
bonfire has "measurably harmful
environmental effects." I assume
he is referring to the estimated
4-plus tons of air pollutants that
are released by burning such a
monumental pile of trash.
However, it is fallacious to claim
that the mere existence of air
contaminants is "measurably
harmful" to the environment. In
fact, there has never been, and
probably will never be, any way
to determine accurately whether
there is any harm at all to the
environment from a single event

of this size. Experience would
indicate that there is not. (To put
this bonfire in perspective, all the
pollution it causes is less than
one-fifteenth of one per cent of
the pollution caused by
automobiles in a'single day in the
bay area.)
This is not to say that the
bonfire is not without adverse
effects; but the harm is not
environmental damage. It's
esthetic and moral outrage, which
is in people's heads. Since this is a
valid and important ground of
objection to the bonfire, I think
it's wise to separate it from
concern for ecological stability,
which is not really in any danger
from this particular source of
pollution.
Barnum's third point was a
gratuitous attack on the Bay Area
Air Pollution Control District
(BAAPCD), which he referred to
as the San Francisco Air Pollution
Control Board. Barnum
apparently believes that the
agency's failure to stop the
bonfire indicates that they are
"Soft on smog." He could use a
few facts about the powers and
desires of the BAAPCD in regard

to bonfire.
The BAAPCD would like
nothing better than to be able to
keep those 4-plus tons of
contaminants out of the air, but
they have no legai authority to do
so. The pertinent law is BAAPCD
Regulation +1, which is a general
ban on all outdoor burning;
however, there are several
exceptions, included because, in
1957, when the regulation was
adopted, it was considered
reasonable to allow fires for
certain restricted purposes. One of
these if "Fires used only for
cooking of food for human
beings, or for recreational
purposes."
The obvious intent of this
exception is to permit barbecues
and campfires; even today, most
people would agree that the value
derived from such fires outweight
the adverse effects of any
pollutants they may generate. The
Stanford bonfire, a somewhat
bizarre event in any case, can
legitimately be viewed as a fire set
"for recreational purposes" (if we
are to assume that any rational
purpose exists for the bonfire.) So

it qualifies under this exemption.
This does not mean that the
BAAPCD gleefully told the
sponsors of the bonfire, "Sure —
go ahead and have your fun" The
position the local BAAPCD
inspector took was one of moral
persuasion — not unlike the stance
of Barnum and others — roughly
stated, "We can't stop you, but
we'd sure be a lot happier if you
wouldn't have your bonfire." As
on many other issues, it appears
that moral persuasion is not very
effective when (perceived)
"immoral" behavior is legitimate
under law.
Barnum then extrapolated
from a subject on which he has
few facts to one on which he has
none, and suggested that the
BAAPCD might be similarly
impotent in the face of "requests"
by industry to be allowed to
pollute. I don't see what this has
to do with the bonfire, but if he
really cares, Barnum can read our
SWOPSI report, or contact me for
more details, on the strengths and
weaknesses of the BAAPCD's
handling of pollution sources that
are within their legal jurisdiction.
Instead of wasting his energy
attacking the BAAPCD, Barnum
and his friends might better invest
their efforts in trying to change
the existing regulations, so that
big bonfires, like Stanford's,
would be specifically forbidden.
In spite of his crynicism, I think
there is a good chance that the
present BAAPCD Board of
Directors would see things his
way. (After all, the regulation was
written in 1957 — long before
"Thou Shalt Not Pollute" was
engraved in tablets of stone as the
Eleventh Commandment.) Such a
request would certainly get a fair
hearing, and unless the
pro-bonfire forces could mount an
active counteroffensive, the

clean-air zealots should carry the
day.
It should give Bamum et al
enormous satisfaction to see their
moral views written into law, so
this is a goal worth working for.
Alas, such changes could not be
brought about in time to stop this
year's bonfire; but the
anti-bonfire crusaders could rest
easy once they were assured that
they had protected future
generations of Stanfordites from
having to suffer through this
unspeakable ecological atrocity.
Mainly, it would help protect
future generations from having to
suffer through this ridiculous
argument every year.

impotent in the face of "requests"
by industry to be allowed to
pollute. I don't see what this has
to do with the bonfire, but if he
really cares, Barnum can read our
SWOPSI report, or contact me for
more details, on the strengths and
weaknesses of the BAAPCD's
handling of pollution sources that
are within their legal jurisdiction.
Instead of wasting his energy
attacking the BAAPCD, Barnum
and his friends might better invest
their efforts in trying to change
the existing regulations, so that
big bonfires, like Stanford's,
would be specifically forbidden.
In spite of his crynicism, I think
there is a good chance that the
present BAAPCD Board of
Directors would see things his
way. (After all, the regulation was
written in 1957 — long before
"Thou Shalt Not Pollute" was
engraved in tablets of stone as the
Eleventh Commandment.) Such a
request would certainly get a fair
hearing, and unless the
pro-bonfire forces could mount an
active counteroffensive, the

clean-air zealots should carry the
day.
It should give Bamum et al
enormous satisfaction to see their
moral views written into law, so
this is a goal worth working for.
Alas, such changes could not be
brought about in time to stop this
year's bonfire; but the
anti-bonfire crusaders could rest
easy once they were assured that
they had protected future
generations of Stanfordites from
having to suffer through this
unspeakable ecological atrocity.
Mainly, it would help protect
future generations from having to
suffer through this ridiculous
argument every year.

Pollution Festival
Stanford University's annual
Fall Pollution Festival, commonly
referred to as the "big-game
bonfire", came a week too late
this year as far as the foot-ball
team was concerned; San Jose
State's Spartans effectively
bottled up a lackadaisical Indian
offense. After this loss to San Jose
State, the "big-game" with the
University of California at
Berkeley will be anti-climatic, to
say the least.
Let us consider, in all
seriousness, how spewing over
eight thousand pounds of
pollutants into our already
over-polluted air supply can help
our team's spirit. What is the
secret ingredient that gets our
boys up for their pigskin contest
with the California Bears the
following afternoon?
Could it be the six thousand
pounds of carbon monoxide gas
(CO) released by the fire? Would
the deadly poisonous CO gas
remind them of expressways,
commuting, and driving their
shiny new metal machines? And
of how the corporate elite, who
are Stanford's Trustees, direct an
economy which produces
pollution, over-consumption, and
genocide? (Ah, the joys of playing
for an elite institution like leland
junior u.. .)
Perhaps the spirit-raiser is the
two thousand pounds of organic
contaminants produced by the
fire. These unburned
hydrocarbons are a vital
ingredient necessary for the
production of our beloved
"photo-chemical smog", that
eye-irritating yellow-brown
blanket that covers the Bay ARea
most of the year.
Or maybe the secret is the
mere two hundred and forty
pounds of particulate matter
which the big fire releases into the
atmosphere; this visibility
reducing haze can be seen for
miles around — a sort of giant
smoke signal — showing that our

mighty "big red machine" means
business. So watch out California
Bears and Michigan Wolverines, if
our pigskin team doesn't get you,
maybe our pollution will, aw
Society for an extra course in the
area.
Well, gang, it's for you to
decide — which air pollutant does
the best job of raising "school
spirit" and "team spirit"? Or
maybe it is something else. Is it
the mindless consumption of
natural resources that turns our
boys on? Or the waste of human
time, energy and initiative? Who
knows?
Whatever. . . Let's all show our
support for the pigskinners, for
the Farm, and for the good
old-fashioned American way of
doing things by driving to the
Pollution Festival, smoking a few
more cigarettes, and tossing some
beer cans around the lakebed.

We, the undersigned freshmen
residents of the Alondra house,
wish to lodge our own protest
against the upcoming "Big Game"
bonfire on Nov. 18.
We realize that the bonfire is a
tradition deeply entwined in
Stanford history. We further
realize that the bonfire, along
with the numerous other events
during the week preceeding the
Cal game, raises the espirit de
corps of the Stanford student
body as a whole (and the
freshmen in particular).
However, in light of today's
increasing concern regarding the
destruction of the environment by
mankind, we feel that the bonfire
is out of step with the wishes of
the majority of people.
"Big Game" bonfire advocates
have pointed out the fact that the
bonfire adds only an infinitesimal
amount of pollution to an already
polluted environment. True as this
may be, we feel that the
cancellation of the bonfire, or the
lack of support thereof, would
emphasize the fact that
conservation is as much a "grass
roots" problem as it is a problem
for* General Motors, Standard Oil,
et al, and being such a problem,
we should attack it at all possible
points.

We realize that this letter will
have little, if any, effect on the
eventual fate of the bonfire. The
bonfire, as it is with most
traditions, will not be abandoned
overnight. It will take the
enlightenment of and subsequent
action by a collected body, the
Stanford community, to break
tradition and stop this small, but
needless, threat to our
environment.

Editor, THE DAILY:
This is a partial response to
David Barnum's letter of Nov. 5
which challenged anyone to
defend the Big-Game bonfire. I
am not about to do that; I think
the bonfire should be an obsolete
tradition, with or without
ecological considerations thrown
in. However, I'm aware that some
people seem to dig bonfires, and
I'm not so arrogant to try to force
my personal preferences on
everyone else.
Whatl do want to do is
comment on two of Barnum's
points concerning the air
pollution aspects of the bonfire.
(For reference, I was the leader of
the SWOPSI workshop that
published a massive report on Air
Pollution in the San Francisco
Bay Area last year.)
First, Barnum states that the
bonfire has "measurably harmful
environmental effects." I assume
he is referring to the estimated
4-plus tons of air pollutants that
are released by burning such a
monumental pile of trash.
However, it is fallacious to claim
that the mere existence of air
contaminants is "measurably
harmful" to the environment. In
fact, there has never been, and
probably will never be, any way
to determine accurately whether
there is any harm at all to the
environment from a single event

of this size. Experience would
indicate that there is not. (To put
this bonfire in perspective, all the
pollution it causes is less than
one-fifteenth of one per cent of
the pollution caused by
automobiles in a'single day in the
bay area.)
This is not to say that the
bonfire is not without adverse
effects; but the harm is not
environmental damage. It's
esthetic and moral outrage, which
is in people's heads. Since this is a
valid and important ground of
objection to the bonfire, I think
it's wise to separate it from
concern for ecological stability,
which is not really in any danger
from this particular source of
pollution.
Barnum's third point was a
gratuitous attack on the Bay Area
Air Pollution Control District
(BAAPCD), which he referred to
as the San Francisco Air Pollution
Control Board. Barnum
apparently believes that the
agency's failure to stop the
bonfire indicates that they are
"Soft on smog." He could use a
few facts about the powers and
desires of the BAAPCD in regard

to bonfire.
The BAAPCD would like
nothing better than to be able to
keep those 4-plus tons of
contaminants out of the air, but
they have no legai authority to do
so. The pertinent law is BAAPCD
Regulation +1, which is a general
ban on all outdoor burning;
however, there are several
exceptions, included because, in
1957, when the regulation was
adopted, it was considered
reasonable to allow fires for
certain restricted purposes. One of
these if "Fires used only for
cooking of food for human
beings, or for recreational
purposes."
The obvious intent of this
exception is to permit barbecues
and campfires; even today, most
people would agree that the value
derived from such fires outweight
the adverse effects of any
pollutants they may generate. The
Stanford bonfire, a somewhat
bizarre event in any case, can
legitimately be viewed as a fire set
"for recreational purposes" (if we
are to assume that any rational
purpose exists for the bonfire.) So

it qualifies under this exemption.
This does not mean that the
BAAPCD gleefully told the
sponsors of the bonfire, "Sure —
go ahead and have your fun" The
position the local BAAPCD
inspector took was one of moral
persuasion — not unlike the stance
of Barnum and others — roughly
stated, "We can't stop you, but
we'd sure be a lot happier if you
wouldn't have your bonfire." As
on many other issues, it appears
that moral persuasion is not very
effective when (perceived)
"immoral" behavior is legitimate
under law.
Barnum then extrapolated
from a subject on which he has
few facts to one on which he has
none, and suggested that the
BAAPCD might be similarly
impotent in the face of "requests"
by industry to be allowed to
pollute. I don't see what this has
to do with the bonfire, but if he
really cares, Barnum can read our
SWOPSI report, or contact me for
more details, on the strengths and
weaknesses of the BAAPCD's

keep those 4-plus tons of
contaminants out of the air, but
they have no legai authority to do
so. The pertinent law is BAAPCD
Regulation +1, which is a general
ban on all outdoor burning;
however, there are several
exceptions, included because, in
1957, when the regulation was
adopted, it was considered
reasonable to allow fires for
certain restricted purposes. One of
these if "Fires used only for
cooking of food for human
beings, or for recreational
purposes."
The obvious intent of this
exception is to permit barbecues
and campfires; even today, most
people would agree that the value
derived from such fires outweight
the adverse effects of any
pollutants they may generate. The
Stanford bonfire, a somewhat
bizarre event in any case, can
legitimately be viewed as a fire set
"for recreational purposes" (if we
are to assume that any rational
purpose exists for the bonfire.) So

it qualifies under this exemption.
This does not mean that the
BAAPCD gleefully told the
sponsors of the bonfire, "Sure —
go ahead and have your fun" The
position the local BAAPCD
inspector took was one of moral
persuasion — not unlike the stance
of Barnum and others — roughly
stated, "We can't stop you, but
we'd sure be a lot happier if you
wouldn't have your bonfire." As
on many other issues, it appears
that moral persuasion is not very
effective when (perceived)
"immoral" behavior is legitimate
under law.
Barnum then extrapolated
from a subject on which he has
few facts to one on which he has
none, and suggested that the
BAAPCD might be similarly
impotent in the face of "requests"
by industry to be allowed to
pollute. I don't see what this has
to do with the bonfire, but if he
really cares, Barnum can read our
SWOPSI report, or contact me for
more details, on the strengths and
weaknesses of the BAAPCD's
handling of pollution sources that
are within their legal jurisdiction.
Instead of wasting his energy
attacking the BAAPCD, Barnum
and his friends might better invest
their efforts in trying to change
the existing regulations, so that
big bonfires, like Stanford's,
would be specifically forbidden.
In spite of his crynicism, I think
there is a good chance that the
present BAAPCD Board of
Directors would see things his
way. (After all, the regulation was
written in 1957 — long before
"Thou Shalt Not Pollute" was
engraved in tablets of stone as the
Eleventh Commandment.) Such a
request would certainly get a fair
hearing, and unless the
pro-bonfire forces could mount an
active counteroffensive, the

clean-air zealots should carry the
day.
It should give Bamum et al
enormous satisfaction to see their
moral views written into law, so
this is a goal worth working for.
Alas, such changes could not be
brought about in time to stop this
year's bonfire; but the
anti-bonfire crusaders could rest
easy once they were assured that
they had protected future
generations of Stanfordites from
having to suffer through this
unspeakable ecological atrocity.
Mainly, it would help protect

Pollution Festival
Stanford University's annual
Fall Pollution Festival, commonly
referred to as the "big-game
bonfire", came a week too late
this year as far as the foot-ball
team was concerned; San Jose
State's Spartans effectively
bottled up a lackadaisical Indian
offense. After this loss to San Jose
State, the "big-game" with the
University of California at
Berkeley will be anti-climatic, to
say the least.
Let us consider, in all
seriousness, how spewing over
eight thousand pounds of
pollutants into our already
over-polluted air supply can help
our team's spirit. What is the
secret ingredient that gets our
boys up for their pigskin contest
with the California Bears the
following afternoon?
Could it be the six thousand
pounds of carbon monoxide gas
(CO) released by the fire? Would
the deadly poisonous CO gas
remind them of expressways,
commuting, and driving their
shiny new metal machines? And
of how the corporate elite, who
are Stanford's Trustees, direct an
economy which produces
pollution, over-consumption, and
genocide? (Ah, the joys of playing
for an elite institution like leland
junior u.. .)
Perhaps the spirit-raiser is the
two thousand pounds of organic
contaminants produced by the
fire. These unburned
hydrocarbons are a vital
ingredient necessary for the
production of our beloved
"photo-chemical smog", that
eye-irritating yellow-brown
blanket that covers the Bay ARea
most of the year.
Or maybe the secret is the
mere two hundred and forty
pounds of particulate matter
which the big fire releases into the
atmosphere; this visibility
reducing haze can be seen for
miles around — a sort of giant
smoke signal — showing that our

mighty "big red machine" means
business. So watch out California
Bears and Michigan Wolverines, if
our pigskin team doesn't get you,
maybe our pollution will, aw
Society for an extra course in the
area.
Well, gang, it's for you to
decide — which air pollutant does
the best job of raising "school
spirit" and "team spirit"? Or
maybe it is something else. Is it
the mindless consumption of
natural resources that turns our
boys on? Or the waste of human
time, energy and initiative? Who
knows?
Whatever. . . Let's all show our
support for the pigskinners, for
the Farm, and for the good
old-fashioned American way of
doing things by driving to the
Pollution Festival, smoking a few
more cigarettes, and tossing some
beer cans around the lakebed.

We, the undersigned freshmen
residents of the Alondra house,
wish to lodge our own protest
against the upcoming "Big Game"
bonfire on Nov. 18.
We realize that the bonfire is a
tradition deeply entwined in
Stanford history. We further
realize that the bonfire, along
with the numerous other events
during the week preceeding the
Cal game, raises the espirit de
corps of the Stanford student
body as a whole (and the
freshmen in particular).
However, in light of today's
increasing concern regarding the
destruction of the environment by
mankind, we feel that the bonfire
is out of step with the wishes of
the majority of people.
"Big Game" bonfire advocates
have pointed out the fact that the
bonfire adds only an infinitesimal
amount of pollution to an already
polluted environment. True as this
may be, we feel that the
cancellation of the bonfire, or the
lack of support thereof, would
emphasize the fact that
conservation is as much a "grass
roots" problem as it is a problem
for* General Motors, Standard Oil,
et al, and being such a problem,
we should attack it at all possible
points.

We realize that this letter will
have little, if any, effect on the
eventual fate of the bonfire. The
bonfire, as it is with most
traditions, will not be abandoned
overnight. It will take the
enlightenment of and subsequent
action by a collected body, the
Stanford community, to break
tradition and stop this small, but
needless, threat to our
environment.

Editor, THE DAILY:
This is a partial response to
David Barnum's letter of Nov. 5
which challenged anyone to
defend the Big-Game bonfire. I
am not about to do that; I think
the bonfire should be an obsolete
tradition, with or without
ecological considerations thrown
in. However, I'm aware that some
people seem to dig bonfires, and
I'm not so arrogant to try to force
my personal preferences on
everyone else.
Whatl do want to do is
comment on two of Barnum's
points concerning the air
pollution aspects of the bonfire.
(For reference, I was the leader of
the SWOPSI workshop that
published a massive report on Air
Pollution in the San Francisco
Bay Area last year.)
First, Barnum states that the
bonfire has "measurably harmful
environmental effects." I assume
he is referring to the estimated
4-plus tons of air pollutants that
are released by burning such a
monumental pile of trash.
However, it is fallacious to claim
that the mere existence of air
contaminants is "measurably
harmful" to the environment. In
fact, there has never been, and
probably will never be, any way
to determine accurately whether
there is any harm at all to the
environment from a single event

of this size. Experience would
indicate that there is not. (To put
this bonfire in perspective, all the
pollution it causes is less than
one-fifteenth of one per cent of
the pollution caused by
automobiles in a'single day in the
bay area.)
This is not to say that the
bonfire is not without adverse
effects; but the harm is not
environmental damage. It's
esthetic and moral outrage, which
is in people's heads. Since this is a
valid and important ground of
objection to the bonfire, I think
it's wise to separate it from
concern for ecological stability,
which is not really in any danger
from this particular source of
pollution.
Barnum's third point was a
gratuitous attack on the Bay Area
Air Pollution Control District
(BAAPCD), which he referred to
as the San Francisco Air Pollution
Control Board. Barnum
apparently believes that the
agency's failure to stop the
bonfire indicates that they are
"Soft on smog." He could use a
few facts about the powers and
desires of the BAAPCD in regard

to bonfire.
The BAAPCD would like
nothing better than to be able to
keep those 4-plus tons of
contaminants out of the air, but
they have no legai authority to do
so. The pertinent law is BAAPCD
Regulation +1, which is a general

Bay Area last year.)
First, Barnum states that the
bonfire has "measurably harmful
environmental effects." I assume
he is referring to the estimated
4-plus tons of air pollutants that
are released by burning such a
monumental pile of trash.
However, it is fallacious to claim
that the mere existence of air
contaminants is "measurably
harmful" to the environment. In
fact, there has never been, and
probably will never be, any way
to determine accurately whether
there is any harm at all to the
environment from a single event

of this size. Experience would
indicate that there is not. (To put
this bonfire in perspective, all the
pollution it causes is less than
one-fifteenth of one per cent of
the pollution caused by
automobiles in a'single day in the
bay area.)
This is not to say that the
bonfire is not without adverse
effects; but the harm is not
environmental damage. It's
esthetic and moral outrage, which
is in people's heads. Since this is a
valid and important ground of
objection to the bonfire, I think
it's wise to separate it from
concern for ecological stability,
which is not really in any danger
from this particular source of
pollution.
Barnum's third point was a
gratuitous attack on the Bay Area
Air Pollution Control District
(BAAPCD), which he referred to
as the San Francisco Air Pollution
Control Board. Barnum
apparently believes that the
agency's failure to stop the
bonfire indicates that they are
"Soft on smog." He could use a
few facts about the powers and
desires of the BAAPCD in regard

to bonfire.
The BAAPCD would like
nothing better than to be able to
keep those 4-plus tons of
contaminants out of the air, but
they have no legai authority to do
so. The pertinent law is BAAPCD
Regulation +1, which is a general
ban on all outdoor burning;
however, there are several
exceptions, included because, in
1957, when the regulation was
adopted, it was considered
reasonable to allow fires for
certain restricted purposes. One of
these if "Fires used only for
cooking of food for human
beings, or for recreational
purposes."
The obvious intent of this
exception is to permit barbecues
and campfires; even today, most
people would agree that the value
derived from such fires outweight
the adverse effects of any
pollutants they may generate. The
Stanford bonfire, a somewhat
bizarre event in any case, can
legitimately be viewed as a fire set
"for recreational purposes" (if we
are to assume that any rational
purpose exists for the bonfire.) So

it qualifies under this exemption.
This does not mean that the
BAAPCD gleefully told the
sponsors of the bonfire, "Sure —
go ahead and have your fun" The
position the local BAAPCD
inspector took was one of moral
persuasion — not unlike the stance
of Barnum and others — roughly
stated, "We can't stop you, but
we'd sure be a lot happier if you
wouldn't have your bonfire." As
on many other issues, it appears
that moral persuasion is not very
effective when (perceived)
"immoral" behavior is legitimate
under law.
Barnum then extrapolated
from a subject on which he has
few facts to one on which he has
none, and suggested that the
BAAPCD might be similarly
impotent in the face of "requests"
by industry to be allowed to
pollute. I don't see what this has
to do with the bonfire, but if he
really cares, Barnum can read our
SWOPSI report, or contact me for
more details, on the strengths and
weaknesses of the BAAPCD's
handling of pollution sources that
are within their legal jurisdiction.
Instead of wasting his energy
attacking the BAAPCD, Barnum
and his friends might better invest
their efforts in trying to change
the existing regulations, so that
big bonfires, like Stanford's,
would be specifically forbidden.
In spite of his crynicism, I think
there is a good chance that the
present BAAPCD Board of
Directors would see things his
way. (After all, the regulation was
written in 1957 — long before
"Thou Shalt Not Pollute" was
engraved in tablets of stone as the
Eleventh Commandment.) Such a
request would certainly get a fair
hearing, and unless the
pro-bonfire forces could mount an
active counteroffensive, the

clean-air zealots should carry the
day.
It should give Bamum et al
enormous satisfaction to see their
moral views written into law, so
this is a goal worth working for.
Alas, such changes could not be
brought about in time to stop this
year's bonfire; but the
anti-bonfire crusaders could rest
easy once they were assured that
they had protected future
generations of Stanfordites from
having to suffer through this
unspeakable ecological atrocity.
Mainly, it would help protect
future generations from having to
suffer through this ridiculous
argument every year.

Pollution Festival
Stanford University's annual
Fall Pollution Festival, commonly
referred to as the "big-game
bonfire", came a week too late
this year as far as the foot-ball
team was concerned; San Jose
State's Spartans effectively
bottled up a lackadaisical Indian
offense. After this loss to San Jose
State, the "big-game" with the
University of California at
Berkeley will be anti-climatic, to
say the least.
Let us consider, in all
seriousness, how spewing over
eight thousand pounds of
pollutants into our already
over-polluted air supply can help
our team's spirit. What is the
secret ingredient that gets our
boys up for their pigskin contest
with the California Bears the
following afternoon?
Could it be the six thousand
pounds of carbon monoxide gas
(CO) released by the fire? Would
the deadly poisonous CO gas
remind them of expressways,
commuting, and driving their
shiny new metal machines? And
of how the corporate elite, who
are Stanford's Trustees, direct an
economy which produces
pollution, over-consumption, and
genocide? (Ah, the joys of playing
for an elite institution like leland
junior u.. .)
Perhaps the spirit-raiser is the
two thousand pounds of organic
contaminants produced by the
fire. These unburned
hydrocarbons are a vital
ingredient necessary for the
production of our beloved
"photo-chemical smog", that
eye-irritating yellow-brown
blanket that covers the Bay ARea
most of the year.
Or maybe the secret is the
mere two hundred and forty
pounds of particulate matter
which the big fire releases into the
atmosphere; this visibility
reducing haze can be seen for
miles around — a sort of giant
smoke signal — showing that our

mighty "big red machine" means
business. So watch out California
Bears and Michigan Wolverines, if
our pigskin team doesn't get you,
maybe our pollution will, aw
Society for an extra course in the
area.
Well, gang, it's for you to
decide — which air pollutant does
the best job of raising "school
spirit" and "team spirit"? Or
maybe it is something else. Is it
the mindless consumption of
natural resources that turns our
boys on? Or the waste of human
time, energy and initiative? Who
knows?
Whatever. . . Let's all show our
support for the pigskinners, for
the Farm, and for the good
old-fashioned American way of
doing things by driving to the
Pollution Festival, smoking a few
more cigarettes, and tossing some
beer cans around the lakebed.

We, the undersigned freshmen
residents of the Alondra house,
wish to lodge our own protest
against the upcoming "Big Game"
bonfire on Nov. 18.
We realize that the bonfire is a
tradition deeply entwined in
Stanford history. We further
realize that the bonfire, along
with the numerous other events
during the week preceeding the
Cal game, raises the espirit de
corps of the Stanford student
body as a whole (and the
freshmen in particular).
However, in light of today's
increasing concern regarding the
destruction of the environment by
mankind, we feel that the bonfire
is out of step with the wishes of
the majority of people.
"Big Game" bonfire advocates
have pointed out the fact that the
bonfire adds only an infinitesimal
amount of pollution to an already
polluted environment. True as this
may be, we feel that the
cancellation of the bonfire, or the
lack of support thereof, would
emphasize the fact that
conservation is as much a "grass
roots" problem as it is a problem
for* General Motors, Standard Oil,
et al, and being such a problem,
we should attack it at all possible
points.

We realize that this letter will
have little, if any, effect on the
eventual fate of the bonfire. The
bonfire, as it is with most
traditions, will not be abandoned
overnight. It will take the
enlightenment of and subsequent
action by a collected body, the
Stanford community, to break
tradition and stop this small, but
needless, threat to our
environment.

This is a partial response to
David Barnum's letter of Nov. 5
which challenged anyone to
defend the Big-Game bonfire. I
am not about to do that; I think
the bonfire should be an obsolete
tradition, with or without
ecological considerations thrown
in. However, I'm aware that some
people seem to dig bonfires, and
I'm not so arrogant to try to force
my personal preferences on
everyone else.
Whatl do want to do is
comment on two of Barnum's

Editor, THE DAILY:
This is a partial response to
David Barnum's letter of Nov. 5
which challenged anyone to
defend the Big-Game bonfire. I
am not about to do that; I think
the bonfire should be an obsolete
tradition, with or without
ecological considerations thrown
in. However, I'm aware that some
people seem to dig bonfires, and
I'm not so arrogant to try to force
my personal preferences on
everyone else.
Whatl do want to do is
comment on two of Barnum's
points concerning the air
pollution aspects of the bonfire.
(For reference, I was the leader of
the SWOPSI workshop that
published a massive report on Air
Pollution in the San Francisco
Bay Area last year.)
First, Barnum states that the
bonfire has "measurably harmful
environmental effects." I assume
he is referring to the estimated
4-plus tons of air pollutants that
are released by burning such a
monumental pile of trash.
However, it is fallacious to claim
that the mere existence of air
contaminants is "measurably
harmful" to the environment. In
fact, there has never been, and
probably will never be, any way
to determine accurately whether
there is any harm at all to the
environment from a single event

of this size. Experience would
indicate that there is not. (To put
this bonfire in perspective, all the
pollution it causes is less than
one-fifteenth of one per cent of
the pollution caused by
automobiles in a'single day in the
bay area.)
This is not to say that the
bonfire is not without adverse
effects; but the harm is not
environmental damage. It's
esthetic and moral outrage, which
is in people's heads. Since this is a
valid and important ground of
objection to the bonfire, I think
it's wise to separate it from
concern for ecological stability,
which is not really in any danger
from this particular source of
pollution.
Barnum's third point was a
gratuitous attack on the Bay Area
Air Pollution Control District
(BAAPCD), which he referred to
as the San Francisco Air Pollution
Control Board. Barnum
apparently believes that the
agency's failure to stop the
bonfire indicates that they are
"Soft on smog." He could use a
few facts about the powers and
desires of the BAAPCD in regard

to bonfire.
The BAAPCD would like
nothing better than to be able to
keep those 4-plus tons of
contaminants out of the air, but
they have no legai authority to do
so. The pertinent law is BAAPCD
Regulation +1, which is a general
ban on all outdoor burning;
however, there are several
exceptions, included because, in
1957, when the regulation was
adopted, it was considered
reasonable to allow fires for
certain restricted purposes. One of
these if "Fires used only for
cooking of food for human
beings, or for recreational
purposes."
The obvious intent of this
exception is to permit barbecues
and campfires; even today, most
people would agree that the value
derived from such fires outweight
the adverse effects of any
pollutants they may generate. The
Stanford bonfire, a somewhat
bizarre event in any case, can
legitimately be viewed as a fire set
"for recreational purposes" (if we
are to assume that any rational
purpose exists for the bonfire.) So

it qualifies under this exemption.
This does not mean that the
BAAPCD gleefully told the
sponsors of the bonfire, "Sure —
go ahead and have your fun" The
position the local BAAPCD
inspector took was one of moral
persuasion — not unlike the stance
of Barnum and others — roughly
stated, "We can't stop you, but
we'd sure be a lot happier if you
wouldn't have your bonfire." As
on many other issues, it appears
that moral persuasion is not very
effective when (perceived)
"immoral" behavior is legitimate
under law.
Barnum then extrapolated
from a subject on which he has
few facts to one on which he has
none, and suggested that the
BAAPCD might be similarly
impotent in the face of "requests"
by industry to be allowed to
pollute. I don't see what this has
to do with the bonfire, but if he
really cares, Barnum can read our
SWOPSI report, or contact me for
more details, on the strengths and
weaknesses of the BAAPCD's
handling of pollution sources that
are within their legal jurisdiction.
Instead of wasting his energy
attacking the BAAPCD, Barnum
and his friends might better invest
their efforts in trying to change
the existing regulations, so that
big bonfires, like Stanford's,
would be specifically forbidden.
In spite of his crynicism, I think
there is a good chance that the
present BAAPCD Board of
Directors would see things his
way. (After all, the regulation was
written in 1957 — long before
"Thou Shalt Not Pollute" was
engraved in tablets of stone as the
Eleventh Commandment.) Such a
request would certainly get a fair
hearing, and unless the
pro-bonfire forces could mount an
active counteroffensive, the

clean-air zealots should carry the
day.
It should give Bamum et al
enormous satisfaction to see their
moral views written into law, so
this is a goal worth working for.
Alas, such changes could not be
brought about in time to stop this
year's bonfire; but the
anti-bonfire crusaders could rest
easy once they were assured that
they had protected future
generations of Stanfordites from
having to suffer through this
unspeakable ecological atrocity.
Mainly, it would help protect
future generations from having to
suffer through this ridiculous
argument every year.

Pollution Festival
Stanford University's annual
Fall Pollution Festival, commonly
referred to as the "big-game
bonfire", came a week too late
this year as far as the foot-ball
team was concerned; San Jose
State's Spartans effectively
bottled up a lackadaisical Indian
offense. After this loss to San Jose
State, the "big-game" with the
University of California at
Berkeley will be anti-climatic, to
say the least.
Let us consider, in all
seriousness, how spewing over
eight thousand pounds of
pollutants into our already
over-polluted air supply can help
our team's spirit. What is the
secret ingredient that gets our
boys up for their pigskin contest
with the California Bears the
following afternoon?
Could it be the six thousand
pounds of carbon monoxide gas
(CO) released by the fire? Would
the deadly poisonous CO gas
remind them of expressways,
commuting, and driving their
shiny new metal machines? And
of how the corporate elite, who
are Stanford's Trustees, direct an
economy which produces
pollution, over-consumption, and
genocide? (Ah, the joys of playing
for an elite institution like leland
junior u.. .)
Perhaps the spirit-raiser is the
two thousand pounds of organic
contaminants produced by the
fire. These unburned
hydrocarbons are a vital
ingredient necessary for the
production of our beloved
"photo-chemical smog", that
eye-irritating yellow-brown
blanket that covers the Bay ARea
most of the year.
Or maybe the secret is the
mere two hundred and forty
pounds of particulate matter
which the big fire releases into the
atmosphere; this visibility
reducing haze can be seen for
miles around — a sort of giant
smoke signal — showing that our

mighty "big red machine" means
business. So watch out California
Bears and Michigan Wolverines, if
our pigskin team doesn't get you,
maybe our pollution will, aw
Society for an extra course in the
area.
Well, gang, it's for you to
decide — which air pollutant does
the best job of raising "school
spirit" and "team spirit"? Or
maybe it is something else. Is it
the mindless consumption of
natural resources that turns our
boys on? Or the waste of human
time, energy and initiative? Who
knows?
Whatever. . . Let's all show our
support for the pigskinners, for
the Farm, and for the good
old-fashioned American way of
doing things by driving to the
Pollution Festival, smoking a few
more cigarettes, and tossing some
beer cans around the lakebed.

We are outraged by Associate
Dean Wright's blatantly unjust
deletion of Bruce Franklin's
course from the Winter Quarter
Time Schedule. We feel, with
Bruce and Eliss Carnochan, that
prejudgments should be avoided,
and Wright's action seems to us an
expression of bureaucratic
prejudgment on Bruce's guilt. We
find it, further, an ill-considered
attempt to manipulate the climate
of opinion on campus against
Bruce by giving political overtones
to a routine departmental
function.

Wright's use of the time factor
to explain his failure to consult
with the English Department
chairman is ludicrous. He could
indeed have reached Mr.
Carnochan before making his
decision if he was able to contact
him ten seconds afterward.
We demand that Bruce's course
be included in the Winter Quarter

Department, in a special
supplement to the Time Schedule
