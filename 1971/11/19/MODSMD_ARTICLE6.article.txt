## Voting Power Of Youth 
### 
There have been many attacks
by left of liberal people on the
two-partv system in the last four
years. These attacks have ranged
from boycotts of regular meetings
of the party faithful, formation of
third, fourth and fifth parties, to
informal coalitions of racial and
ideological groups which attempt
to atomize their political force.
As many establishment
politicos—mostly Democratic and
mostly liberal—suggest, this
devisiveness within the left
infrastructure might very well
assure the re-election of President
Nixon. Rather than split off, this
reasoning goes, the disenchanted
left should acquiece to whoever
the Democrats nominate because
he will surely delight them far
more than Mr. Nixon has been
able to.
There are many loopholes to
this rationale. Primarily
splinterists state that this proposal
is like asking them to choose
between the lesser of two evils:
between someone who doesn't
know any better (Mr. Nixon) and
someone who knows better but
refuses to do anything about it
(Mr. Muskie). Rather than
entering the machinations in
Miami, this group would prefer to
compete with the Democrats,
possibly attract Ralph Nader or
someone of his prestige to head a
ticket, and go into the elections as
a bona fide third party.
Added to this equilibrium are
the new voters arising out of the

26th Amendment. Their influence
cannot be weighted
probabilistically because they are
registering decidedly Democratic
across the country.
After trying to review what
possible plans may be vis a vis the
1972 election, I am becoming
more convicned thai the stakes
are too high to change tenancy in
the White House by other than
the two-party system. This is an
unsettling compromise when one
reviews the Chicago convention in
1968 and the dragons from that
meeting that still lurk in
Democratic caverns. But I prefer
the possibility of working on a
man like Senator Muskie when he
is in the seat of power than having
to sit through another term of
insensitivity in the executive
branch.
That the stakes are high has
been a slogan often befitting
election times. The stakes have
never exactly been low in
presidential history, owing to the
frenetic movements of the
American state. But there are a
few things which make it very
clear — and let me make this
perfectly clear — that a change in
presidential personnel will affect
areas beyond formal foreign and
domestic policy.
For example, we have the
Supreme Court nominations
announced last week. Any of the
liberal Democratic contenders
might have widened his power to
nominate a pair that might have
fitted into the Warren court.

Instead, while the calibre of
nominees is high — none of that
Carswell stuff — they still reflect
the president's strict
constructionist philosophy. The
number of Nixon appointees
following his philosophical tastes
now number four. So the balance
that was there when Mr. Nixon
took office has begun to tip to the
conservative.
Then there is the Federal
Communications Commission.
The term of F.C.C. Commissioner
Nicholas Johnson, the dissenting
voice of people's rights <. in
broadcasting, will be up in 1973.
Commission watchers are sure
that Mr. Nixon would not pick up
Johnson's option.
Another key appointment that
will face the President in 1973
will be the director of selective
services. It will be in 1-&73,
according to Secretary Laird, that
an all-volunteer military w,pyld
become functional. Although the
Democratic position on this is
split, a Democrat nonetheless
would be obligated to the party
plank on this matter. And
indications are that one area of
party reform will be in the
selection of resolutions to avoid a
watered-down platform that was
part of the 1968 defeat
machinery.
So, as political scientist
Michael Harrington said at
Stanford a few weeks ago, a new
president can make a difference. I
would propose that those who
still have not opted for the
politically easy state of apathy to
consider what direction they will
choose to take. Those faithful to
Republicanism and Nixon but
who would like to see a fresh
point of view taken on some
issues should plan ahead to make
sure that their voice will not be
denied its platform next year.
But I think the key here is
planning. The professional
political merchants are probably
in production right now. Unless
those who have been sitting on
the bench for four years make
their desires known — by insisting
on representation at the national
conventions, by getting into the
local party organization, and by
probing the various contenders —
the president will once more
caress his silent majority into
returning him to office with no
change in philosophy.
