# who pays for what
## University Propaganda? 
### 
Peculiar Advertisement
Editor, THE DAILY:
Last Friday's (November 12)
Daily displayed a rather peculiar
"advertisement." Large bold-faced
type introduced an "Open Letter
from Joseph Petit II and Robert
Street Concerning D.O.D.
Research at Stanford." What
seemed even more interesting was
the sponsor of this half-page
"letter" — University Relations.
As a concerned member of the
Stanford Student Body (who pays
tuition), I am perplexed at why
one particular university
organization (University
Relations, in this case) should
have access to money from the
Stanford General Fund for the
purpose of spreading its own
views.
Two important questions are
raised by this issue: 1) Why is the
university administration using
my money to pay for the printing
of a piece of propaganda wihtout
consulting me? and 2) If Stanford
is a place for the free and
open-minded exchange of ideas,
why isn't material for the other
viewpoint accorded equal
consideration for university
funds?
The first question is a
reflection of an even deeper issue,
the disenfranchisement of the
students (along with the faculty
and staff). There is no mechanism
by which the students of this
university can implement
decisions that they make as a
community. The administration

and the Board of Trustees made
final decisions on issues, even
though those decisions affect
other groups.
The second question requires
some clarification. There are
various opinions held by
responsible people on this campus
regarding D.O.D. funding, ranging
from the opinions of men like
Robert Street and Joseph Petit to
the opinions of groups like the
Young Crows. Instead of helping
to investigate a means by which a
decision can be made between
these opinions and how that
decision is to be implemented,
one small group at Stanford, the
administration, has monopolized
the resources of the university in
order to promote its particular
point of view.
Outside the university, the
control of a community by a
small group is called an oligarchy
— a power structure which even the
administration would consider
despotism. Perhaps at Stanford we
call this structure by some more
pleasant name. (To paraphrase
Shakespeare, "Shit by any other
name would taste the same.")
In conclusion, I would like to
request of Mr. Nelson, head of
University Relations, and the
administration that if they wish to
print such open letters in the
future, then they either consult
with the Stanford Community
before using our monies to
advertise their views, or submit it
to the Daily for consideration as a
newspaper article.

Daily Explanation
Editor's Note: The open letter
from Deans Pettit and Street was
originally submitted to the Daily
for consideration on its opinions
page. Due primarily to his space
• limitations, the opinions editor
felt he could not publish the
letter. However, because of the
letter's value as an official
correspondence which included a
statement of the University policy
toward sponsored research, the
Daily asked University Relations
if they were interested in running
it as a paid advertisement.
A Response
The decision to have the
Pettit-Street letter run on a paid
basis was mine.
The general rationale for
statements published on a paid
basis in The Daily is to provide
more detailed coverage on topics
of broad student and faculty
interest than would otherwise be
possible.
Normally, this is limited to
statements like those published
Monday from President Lyman on
recruitment policy and from
Professor Kennedy on the
Advisory Board's progress.
Hopefully, this will be the case in
the future.
In view of the space devoted
by The Daily to the initial
SWOPSI report and to comentary
from other sources concerning
sponsored research at Stanford, it
seemed surprising the paper could
not publish the Pettit-Street open
letter except on a paid basis. It
represented a fairly detailed
critique of the SWOPSI report
from the dean of the school most
directly affected by its findings.
The initial SWOPSI report on
Defense Department sponsored
research at Stanford received
extensive coverage both on
campus and nationally, in large
part through the efforts of News
Service. Future SWOPSI reports,
and dissents from them, will
receive similar treatment on a
straight news basis.
