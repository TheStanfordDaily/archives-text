# S.E. Asian Oil--A Key Factor
## 
### 
In a recent KZSU interview,
President Richard Lyman, quoting
a French author, remarked that
the war in Indochina "is worse
than a crime; it's a blunder."
There's no question that the
murderous U.S. intervention "is
worse than a crime" 0 genocide is
the correct term. But the
American involvement in
Indochina is certainly no
"blunder," as Lyman and most
other liberals would have us
believe. The purpose of the
continuing U.S. military presence
in Southeast Asia is to ensure
American corporations access to
the region's rich natural resources,
untapped markets, and cheap
labor.
American business and
government interest in the
economic potential of Southeast
Asia, particularly in its raw
materials, is longstanding. In
March, 1954, with the U.S.
supporting 80% of the French
colonial war effort against the
Indochinese peoples, Secretary of
State John Foster Dulles pointed
out the importance of the
Southeast Asian region when he
noted that, "It is rich in many raw
materials such as tin, oil, rubber
and iron ore."
Fifteen years later, in
February, 1965, just after the
intensive bombing of North
Vietname had begun, U.S.
Ambassador to South Vietnam,
Henry Cabot Lodge, echoed the
same sentiments: "He who holds
or has influence in Vietnam can
affect the future of the
Philippines and Formosa to the
east, Thailand and Burma, with
their huge rice surpluses to the
west, and Malaysia and Indonesia
with their rubber, oil and tin to
the south. Vietnam thus does not
exist in a geographical vacum —
from it large storehouses of
wealth and population can be
influenced and undermined." .
Only recently have American
businessmen learned just how
lucrative the greatest of those
resources — Southeast Asian oil —
will be.
American interests in
Southeast Asian oil dates back to
John D. Rockefeller's 1911 entry
into the rich fields of the Dutch
East Indies. Competition with the
U.S. for control of the Indies' oil
was a major reason for Japan's
strike at Pearl Harbor and its
subsequent invasion of Indonesia.

When Indonesian president
Sukarno threatened to nationalize
American oil holdings in 1963,
President Kennedy dispatched a
top-flight team to negotiate on
behalf of the oil companies. When
Sukarno was threatened with the
termination of the U.S. aid, he
backed down, and the oil
remained in American hands.

The American oil giants'
stampede to Southeast Asia began
after the 1965 coup in Indonesia
by pro-American generals which
left half a million communists and
supporters dead, but opened the
door wide to foreign investment.
Southeast Asian oil's importance
was heightened by the Six Day
War in 1967, which cut off the
Suez Canal to important Middle
Eastern oil shipments. "Major
companies are eager to diversify
their sources of petroleum
because of political uncertainty in
the Middle East, the world's major
source of crude [oil] today,"
wrote Fortune magazine in March,
1970.
Southeast Asia has been an
important oil-producing region for
some time. Indonesia is already
the world's 11th largest producer,
yielding over a million barrels a
day. Now the whole area is being
carved up. The South Vietnamese
government has recently sold 17
major offshore oil concessions
completing the division of the
region.
The potential of the Southeast
Asian fields is apparently
immense. One top oil company
official has said that "compared
to the Southeast Asian offshore
deposits, those of Louisiana are
like a postage stamp on the back
of an elephant."
James Gauntt, a veteran U.S.
seismologist has been paraphrased
as saying that in five years, "the
offshore fields of Thailand,
Cambodia, Malaysia, South
Vietnam, and Indonesia will be
ready to produce ... more than is
now produced in the whole
western world."

The ultimate reason for
American companies' passionate
interest in Southeast Asian oil is
not simply profit (although there
will be plenty of that), but
control of vital oil reserves. As has
been the case since WW 11,
American economic hegemony in
Asia rests on the American ability
to control Japan's supply of raw

inno

materials and its available
markets. An independent,
socialist, resurgent Southeast Asia
would pull Japan into expanded
trade both with itself and China
and end its reliance on the U.S.
Such a shift in the Pacific
balance of power could deal a
shattering blow to the American
big business strategy to defend
and extend its position in the
world economy.
As the major source of the
world's usable energy, oil has an
importance in international
politics far out of proporition to
its dollar volume.
The U.S. government is
particularly "aware of the place of
energy supplies in its political and
economic life," as Secrtary
Trezise diplomatically put it, since
the American petroleum industry
is the world's largest industry of
any kind.

U.S. overseas investment in oil
production, refining, and
marketing accounts for 70% of
America's $75 billion worth of
foreign investments. Jack
Anderson, the knowledgeable
Washington columnist, wrote in
1967, ". .. the State Dept. has
often taken its policies right out
of the executive suites of the big
oil companies. When Big Oil can't
get what it wants in foreign
countries, the State Dept. tries to
get it for them. In many
countries, the American
Embassies function virtually as
branch offices for the oil
combine. . ."
But the petroleum industry's
influence doesn't stop at the State
Department. America's great oil
families have a strong ally in the
White House, too. The Mellons
(Gulf), the Rockefellers (who
have large interests in all
companies that grew out of the
Standard Oil trust), and other oil
families contributed some
$600,000 to Nixon's 1968
presidential campaign. They need
only remind him that his political
fortunes rest upon the continued
expansion of American corporate
capitalism — an expansion fueled
by Asian oil and Asian oil
revenues.
The vast quantity of oil lying
beneath Southeast Asian waters,
combined with the size and power
of the petroleum industry, make
it clear that oil will remain a key
factor in Southeast Asian politics.
