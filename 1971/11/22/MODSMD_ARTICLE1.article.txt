FRUITS OF VICTORY-Thunder Chickens Greg Sampson (91) and Pete Lazetich (78) (top) return the axe to Stanford after
a year's absence. The running and catching of halfback Jackie Brown (3 3) played a large part in Stanford's winning the
trophy back. Brown scored this touchdown on a 5 8-yard pass play and was voted offensive player of the game.
