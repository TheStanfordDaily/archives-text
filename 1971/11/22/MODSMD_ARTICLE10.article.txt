## Eddie Gale: A New Musician 
###

During the years that I have
been a part of the Stanford
community, years that I saw bring
many changes, it was always a
more positive kind of relationship
that could develop between blacks
and whites a relation built on
human understanding.
Human understanding? Put it
like this, the gulf between the
races is such that unless you have
some common denominators that
people can relate to, like a
culture, better yet. a music since
like Duke Ellington says, "when
every thing else is gone, the music
will still be there," when you get
to where you have this kind of
thing going, then you can talk in a
honest and "candid" fashion with
one another.

A way of getting out of and
away from this paranoid trip a lot
of us unfortunately go on is to get
out of this "protesting" bag, this
so-called "demanding" bag,
putting people in the ridiculous
position of subordinate and
superordinate relations. The best
way for us all to come together is
by you and me digging on the
music, "ghetto music."
"Ghetto music," what is it one
has to ask? And then, the answer,
that Ghetto Music goes through
the length and breadth of the
human spirit, that it projects all of
the vibrations in the soul, the
collective spirit of a people,
ghetto people, there for 400 years
and still able to survive. That
"ghetto music" is an assertion of
the self, the spirit, the will to
survive because of repression.
Eddie Gale's Ghetto Music. Is

here. From Bedford-Stuyvesant to
Palo Alto, to Stanford.
Introduced to the Stanford radio
audience by appearing on Buff
Parham's Wednesday night spot,
"Things and Stuff, Part I." Was
asked on the show "what do you
plan to do while you're here" and
shot back that "I plan to bring a
music to these people, a music
they can rejoice in, a music people
can believe in, can come together
around, a music that gets away
from all these colors and things
and gets us to where we can really
communicate with one another
without all of thesehang-upsthat
society puts on us."
I wondered to myself,
watching Eddie rap on the show,
well, what is this cat into? What
does he need? How do I go about
helping him? You see, in the end,
I care about the music, about the
music of the people, about the
need for this music as well to be
heard and exposed, to be known.
You know, to where you really
don't want to be put into bags
where you feel you have to justify
the music.
You don't. You see, the music
is already there. "Eddie Gale's
Ghetto Music," the album that
has Eddie and teh Singers, the

Noble Gale Sisters, there on the
cover, flanked by two giant Great
Danes. Blue Note. Or the second
album, "Black Rhythm
Happening," where the brother
stretches out and does some really
groovy things with voices that the
people out here, that all of you,
have got to hear.
So what it is? Well, you can
start out by going to what should
be one of the heaviest sets to be
on this campus in a long while.
Memorial Church, through Dean
Napier, have come together with
the Sickle Cell Anemia Committee
and Intercommunal Survival
Committee to bring Bobby Seale
to the Church this evening as a
guest speaker on the issue of
"survival" and this should be
something else in itself.
But you also have Eddie Gale,
who will be there at 7:30 to bless
the church with "God Is The
Spirit," a one hour musical
excursion into the world that
promises to bring things right up
to date. For Bobby to speak. Add
anyone else if you want. But the
fact is that Memorial Church has
always been what's happening for
the really hip, heavy carriers of
the music, the word.
John Handv did his number

there and really got "out" on the
people who were privileged
enough to be there. They now
have a memory, of something
heavy that went down. A way of
them seeing something new and
they could dig on it, we all could
dig on it. It was real. Like when
Duke Ellington came, to Stanford,
to the Church, and performed his
"Jazz Mass."
At that particular moment you
had seen people come together.
No more were we really sitting
stiff-shouldered next to one
another. Tensions had melted, the
vibrations in the air were good. It
was a "happening" in the best
sense of the word. Now, Eddie
will be there and it promises to go
a whole lot further out. This time,
Memorial Church and "Ghetto
Music" existing side-by-side.
With him comes Russell Lyle,
young brother, 25 years old, by
way of Newark, New Jersey, tenor
saxophone and guitar, a different
sensibility altogether on the sax, a
different hom, but squarely in the
mold of previous cats who have
come out of Newark, cats like the
Shorter Brothers, Lester Young.
Played with Sunny Murray in New
York but doing his main gigging
with Eddie in and around New
York.
A melodic horn, but driving,
driving with that same fierce
energy that you need to survive
being hurt while growing up in the
slums, this is what Russell Lyle is
all about and he does it well, real
well, my friends, and as many
of you as you can ought to hear
him before they leave.
A sister, a young, 23 year-old
sister from Brooklyn who does
the music on the piano. As James
Cotton once said, "the piano is
the 'Mother' of the rhythm
section" and Briding Newell, the

young lady in question, gets it on.
The way that she and Eddie
communicate when playing is
fantastic, and it ought to be, they
are married, but more than that,
they are in the mold of an earlier
master that we all know of,
Ohnedaruth, John, John Coltrane,
and his wife, Alice, Alice Coltrane
(check out her album "Universal
Consciousness" and really get into
some good sound).
And we are, after all, culturally
deprived, here, in the Ivory
Tower, in tellectualized,
grab-assing over tenure and
tripping off who is taking pictures
of who and how the Man sho' is
funky, really fascist, when it all
boils down to how it is that some
people "can't see the forests for
the trees." Are real short-sighted.
And don't even know it.
You don't need a big "hype"
to go see Eddie Gale this evening
at Memorial Church. You should
be there anyway, if you care
anything at all about what the
whole program is about, the fight
to raise funds for research into the
disease, the fact that you will get
the chance to hear people of deep
convictions from all walks of life
come together over something
that is, after all, very human, and
very real.
This is where it's at, people,
right here in our Church, not out
in the streets, lost and abandoned,
tripped-out and nonsense like
that, hard and cold in your dealins
with each other, the Ghetto Music
is going to be available to us for a
while and we all of us owe it to
ourselves to come on and check it
out for what it is!
