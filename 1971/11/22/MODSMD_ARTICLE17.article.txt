Bill Meyers made a startling revelation in the
locker room following the Indians 14-0 win over Cal
in the Big Game. "The Rose Bowl was at stake for
the offensive and defensive lines in today's game.
We talked about this earlier in the week and decided
that we did not deserve to go if we lost to Cal. We
decided that we would refuse to go."
This courageous display of pride is something
that would not be expected by outsiders of a team
that had lost possibly the three easiest games on its
1971 season schedule. Some felt that the lack of
pride was the main reason for the three
embarrassing losses.
Lines Responsible
Meyers claimed that, "The lines felt responsible
for our loss last weekend and we vowed that we
would win this game." They were confident that
they could beat the Bears, but as an extra incentive
the linemen proudly decided not to go into the
Rose Bowl through the back door if they lost.
Don Bunce acknowledged that some players had
been talking about not accepting their Rose Bowl
bid if they lost the Big Game, but he cautioned that,
"1 was worried early in the week, because 1 thought
that it was a negative way of thinking about the Cal

game." Bunce did however, agree with the basic
sentiment of the linemen. "We felt that we were not
deserving of a bowl bid if we lost another game. It
was bad enough going to the Rose Bowl last year
with an 8-3 record."
Unknown
It will never be known if the Indians would have
turned down their Rose Bowl bid, but Bill Meyers
sounded deadly serious when he said that he would
not go to Pasadena with a 7-4 record. At the very
least, the linemen's proposal would have been
seriously considered by the team. It is my feeling,
however, that the pride which drove the squad to
come back against OSU and trounce heavily favored
Washington and USC would also not allow the
Indians to go into one of the country's most
prestigious bowl games after blowing four games.
This pride is the strength of a team that likes to
beat squads that they are not supposed to come
close to. They have proven this over the past two
seasons, and I think that they will continue to do
so.
On that basis, I would like to be one of the first
to predict that the underdog Indians will beat
undefeated Michigan on New Year's Day.
