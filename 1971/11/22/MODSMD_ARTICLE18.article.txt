# Oski Bites Drum Major
## 
### BOB BACON LANG ATWOOD 
Bob Kurland, drum major of
the Stanford Marching Band, was
bitten on the leg by a Cal
cheerleader in an altercation
following Saturday's Big Game.
Kurland's skin was broken but he
was not seriously hurt.
The scuffle apparently broke
out following the game when the
cheerleader, whose name is not
known, took Kurland's hat and
tried to run away. Kurland and
several other Stanford bandsmen
pursued and a pileup ensued. It
was then that Kurland was bitten.
The ruckus was broken up with
the assistance of Alec Rooke, the
band's liaison officer with the
Athletic Department, according to
Band Manager Dave Ruiz.
Attacker Angry
Ruiz said that the cheerleader
escaped. "He was very upset. He
felt he was being attacked. He

thought it was OK for him to steal
the hat and he didn't think
Kurland should be angry," Ruiz
noted.
He added that the band is
looking into possible legal actions
with regard to the biting incident,
as well as regarding catapults in
the stands. He declined to
elaborate for publication.
Sheriff's deputies reported
almost no success in halting the
catapult and slingshot activities in
the stadium during the game.
One catapult, in the Cal section
below the press box, was put out
of action by a deputy, but that
was the only success of the day
for the officers
Sheriffs Assigned
four plainclothes deputy
sheriffs were assigned to seize
catapults in the stands but were
not successful. Field-level officers
spotted most of the devices but
clogged aisles in the stands

prevented deputies from reaching
them.
Ruiz said that 110 Stanford
bandsmen were injured by
missiles, but noted that one tuba
player was hit in the back with an
orange.
The LSJUMB official pointed
out that "although people think
it's kind of humorous to see the
band out there getting hit, at that
velocity even a water balloon
could knock out a few teeth."
"We're angry," Ruiz went on.
"The cops did nothing." He noted
that the band officials were
looking into possible courses of
legal action to protect the
musicians from such incidents in
the future.
Regarding both incidents, he
pointed out that "We're sort of
holding back, it being the Big
Game. We really don't want
anything very serious, but we just
want somebody to realize that
we're very pissed off."

holding back, it being the Big
Game. We really don't want
anything very serious, but we just
want somebody to realize that
we're very pissed off."
Bob Kurland, drum major of
the Stanford Marching Band, was
bitten on the leg by a Cal
cheerleader in an altercation
following Saturday's Big Game.
Kurland's skin was broken but he
was not seriously hurt.
The scuffle apparently broke
out following the game when the
cheerleader, whose name is not
known, took Kurland's hat and
tried to run away. Kurland and
several other Stanford bandsmen
pursued and a pileup ensued. It
was then that Kurland was bitten.
The ruckus was broken up with
the assistance of Alec Rooke, the
band's liaison officer with the
Athletic Department, according to
Band Manager Dave Ruiz.
Attacker Angry
Ruiz said that the cheerleader
escaped. "He was very upset. He
felt he was being attacked. He

thought it was OK for him to steal
the hat and he didn't think
Kurland should be angry," Ruiz
noted.
He added that the band is
looking into possible legal actions
with regard to the biting incident,
as well as regarding catapults in
the stands. He declined to
elaborate for publication.
Sheriff's deputies reported
almost no success in halting the
catapult and slingshot activities in
the stadium during the game.
One catapult, in the Cal section
below the press box, was put out
of action by a deputy, but that
was the only success of the day
for the officers
Sheriffs Assigned
four plainclothes deputy
sheriffs were assigned to seize
catapults in the stands but were
not successful. Field-level officers
spotted most of the devices but
clogged aisles in the stands

prevented deputies from reaching
them.
Ruiz said that 110 Stanford
bandsmen were injured by
missiles, but noted that one tuba
player was hit in the back with an
orange.
The LSJUMB official pointed
out that "although people think
it's kind of humorous to see the
band out there getting hit, at that
velocity even a water balloon
could knock out a few teeth."
"We're angry," Ruiz went on.
"The cops did nothing." He noted
that the band officials were
looking into possible courses of
legal action to protect the
musicians from such incidents in
the future.
Regarding both incidents, he
pointed out that "We're sort of
holding back, it being the Big
Game. We really don't want
anything very serious, but we just
want somebody to realize that
we're very pissed off."
