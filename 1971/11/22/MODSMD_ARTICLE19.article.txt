# 'Daily' Triumphs In Inkbowl, 20-7
## 
### 
The Stanford Daily
successfully reversed the Big
Game Ink Bowl jinx for the
second straight year Saturday by
defeating the Daily Californian,
20-7.
The most outstanding
performance came from Bob
Litterman who intercepted three
Cal aerials and tagged the Bear
passer for at least one long loss.
Steve Ungar led a rushing corps
composed of Brian Hardy, Frank
Miller, and Scott Thacher which
harassed the Cal attack all
morning.

Offensively, Lenny Seigel hit
Charles Lyle on a 40 yard scoring
strike for the first touchdown. In
the second half, Jim Baer
scampered 60 yards with a Davy
Jones screen pass to ice the
contest. The Daily scoring ended
with a 15 yard pass from Hall

Daily to Don Bohoffer before Cal
ran for its lone score late in the
game.
While the ASSU downed the
ASUC, the Cal varsity managers
shut out the Indian managers,
16-0, on an interception, safety,
and a swing pass.
