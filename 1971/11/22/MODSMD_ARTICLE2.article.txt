# Jewish Holidays Petition
## Schedule Changes Denied 
### ROBERT VINING 
The Faculty Senate Steering
Committee has denied a request by
Jewish students that registration and
the first two days of classes not be
scheduled in conflict with Jewish
holidays. The Committee said that
students and faculty should be notified
that they will not be penalized for
missing University functions which fall
on religious holidays.
The first day of classes this year fell
on Yom Kipper, the holiest day of the
year in the Jewish religion.
The Steering Committee's decision is
basically the same as that
recommended, before the petition was
submitted, by the Subcommittee on
Academic Standing, Petitions, and
Exceptions.
Academic Secretary H. Donald
Winbigler, contacted after the
committee meeting, said, "To the best
of my knowledge, there is no intent to
bring before the Senate the matter of
changing the calendar." The Steering
Committee normally sets the agenda

for the Faculty Senate.
Steering Committee Chairman Daniel
Bershader, Professor of Aerophysics,
said the committee felt a concern for
the basic principle of University
impartiality toward sectarian groups.
Religious Studies major David
Axelrad, who helped draft the petition,
commented last night that the decision
"doesn't make me fighting mad" but is
"very disappointing." Axelrad said the
decision was like "slipping out the back
door without confronting" the issue.
Rabbi Charles Familant, director of
Stanford Hillel, could not be reached
for comment.
Besides alleging discrimination in the
University calendar, the group's
petition detailed complaints about
campus facilities provided for religious
services.
The petition stated that Memorial
Church and the Women's Clubhouse,
designated by the Trustees in 1 966 as
the only campus facilities where
sectarian religious services could be
held, were unsuitable for Jewish

services. The petition cited the church
building's elaborately Christian decor
and the small seating capacity of the
Clubhouse, located in the Old Union.
The President's Office brought up
the problem of facilities at the Board of
Trustees meeting November 9 th. The
matter will be placed on the formal
agenda of the January Board meeting.
The Trustees have responsibility over
the use of campus facilities for religious
services, while the faculty is responsible
for the University calendar.
Assistant to the President Bill Stone
said the President's Office might ask
the Trustees to rewrite their 1966
ruling so as to authorize someone on
campus to decide what facilities may be
used for sectarian worship. Another
possibility, Stone added, is that the
President's Office could ask the
Trustees to specify another campus
facility for Jewish services.
The President's Office reported that
the petition was received with 549
signatures.
