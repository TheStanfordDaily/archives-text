Castro Acclaimed
PUNTA ARENAS' Chile — Cuban Prime Minister Fidel
Castro came to this southernmost city in the world
yesterday and got one of the most enthusiastic receptions
so far on his state visit to Chile.
More than 10,000 persons came out in frigid wind and
rain to cheer him in Punta Arenas' central plaza.
"It's impossible not to have confidence in the future of
our peoples, of our contcontinent ... of an immense Latin
American fatherland," the bearded Prime Minister said,
sharing the speaker's platform with his friend and host,
President Salvador Allende.
Clark Scores Prisons
SAN FRANCISCO — Former Attorney General Ramsey
Clark yesterday advocated doing away with prisons as they
now exist, calling them "warehouses of crime and human
degradation."
Instead, Clark told an audience at the University of San
Francisco, there should be small community-based facilities
of the type most suited to the needs of the prisoners
themselves. He mentioned detoxification units for alcohol
and drug offenders, psychological counselling services and
family service agencies.
In response to a question from the floor about Supreme
Court nominee William Rehnquist, Clark said: "If what I
have heard and read is true, there is real doubt that
Rehnquist can support major parts of the Constitution."
19 Perish in Fires
PONTIAC, Michigan — Nineteen people were killed in three
early morning fires yesterday in Michigan, California and
Alaska. Authorities said the blaze here was the work of an
arsonits.
Fifteen of the victims were children.
Authorities said someone had kicked open the front
door of the two-level, two-family dwelling and scattered
combustible fluid just inside. The liquid also was spread on
a wooden porch, they said.

"There are no suspects, but it appears we have seven
murders on our hands," said Pontiac Police Sgt. Herbert
Cooley.
Flames raging through a one-storv farmhouse near the
Riverside County community of Blvthe, California killed
five children aged three to 13. The parents, two other
children and a visiting friend were able to escape into the
predawn darkness.
Killed when fire swept a house trailer in Fairbanks,
Alaska, were a 26 year old woman, three of her children
and three nieces and nephews whom she was babysitting.
Humphrey Hits Nixon
WASHINGTON — Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey accused
President Nixon last night of deliberately seeking to
"provoke confrontation" during his appearance Friday at
the AFL-CIO convention in Miami Beach.
In a telegram to AFL-CIO President George Meany,
which he asked be read to the convention delegates,
Humphrey said:
"Richard Nixon came to this convention not to seek
cooperation but rather with a set script to provoke
confrontation; not to correct inequities, but to accentuate
differences; not to explain to the convention and the
American people his economic program, but rather to
demand obedience to executive edict.
"An opportunity for bringing Americans together was
cast aside in the interest of personal political gain,"
Humphrey said. "A president should act to unify, not
divide."
Dock Strike Threatened
HONOLULU — The Hawaiian Islands, still recovering from
hardships brought about by the more than three-month
long West Coast dock strike, are facing a new threat—a
complete sealing up of Island ports.
The International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's
Union, local 142, representing 900 dock workers
throughout Hawaii, gave notice over the weekend they'll
strike after Dec. 4, unless "substantial progress" is made in
local contract talks.

Humphrey Hits Nixon
WASHINGTON — Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey accused
President Nixon last night of deliberately seeking to
"provoke confrontation" during his appearance Friday at
the AFL-CIO convention in Miami Beach.
In a telegram to AFL-CIO President George Meany,
which he asked be read to the convention delegates,
Humphrey said:
"Richard Nixon came to this convention not to seek
cooperation but rather with a set script to provoke
confrontation; not to correct inequities, but to accentuate
differences; not to explain to the convention and the
American people his economic program, but rather to
demand obedience to executive edict.
"An opportunity for bringing Americans together was
cast aside in the interest of personal political gain,"
Humphrey said. "A president should act to unify, not
divide."
Dock Strike Threatened
HONOLULU — The Hawaiian Islands, still recovering from
hardships brought about by the more than three-month
long West Coast dock strike, are facing a new threat—a
complete sealing up of Island ports.
The International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's
Union, local 142, representing 900 dock workers
throughout Hawaii, gave notice over the weekend they'll
strike after Dec. 4, unless "substantial progress" is made in
local contract talks.
Castro Acclaimed
PUNTA ARENAS' Chile — Cuban Prime Minister Fidel
Castro came to this southernmost city in the world
yesterday and got one of the most enthusiastic receptions
so far on his state visit to Chile.
More than 10,000 persons came out in frigid wind and
rain to cheer him in Punta Arenas' central plaza.
"It's impossible not to have confidence in the future of
our peoples, of our contcontinent ... of an immense Latin
American fatherland," the bearded Prime Minister said,
sharing the speaker's platform with his friend and host,
President Salvador Allende.
Clark Scores Prisons
SAN FRANCISCO — Former Attorney General Ramsey
Clark yesterday advocated doing away with prisons as they
now exist, calling them "warehouses of crime and human
degradation."
Instead, Clark told an audience at the University of San
Francisco, there should be small community-based facilities
of the type most suited to the needs of the prisoners
themselves. He mentioned detoxification units for alcohol
and drug offenders, psychological counselling services and
family service agencies.
In response to a question from the floor about Supreme
Court nominee William Rehnquist, Clark said: "If what I
have heard and read is true, there is real doubt that
Rehnquist can support major parts of the Constitution."
