# YR's Rebound From Group Split
## 
### KEVIN SMITH Third in a Series 
Young Republicans are fighting for
influence on campus after a stormy,
divisive election of officers last May.
Noel Casey, current Young
Republican President and a business
student, said he announced his
candidacy the day of the election
because he "feared a merger" of the
YR's and the McCloskey for President
Organization.
Casey said that then-President
Roman Buhler was hoping to name

Kevin Whiteside, an active McCloskey
worker, as heir to the YR leadership.
After Casey was elected, he charged,
Buhler used a trick maneuver to seek
his impeachment. Casey said that
Buhler, feigning friendliness,
recommended that Casey appoint
certain people to the group's Executive
Board.
Never Appointed?
Casey said that he never made the
appointments because he discovered
Buhler's candidates were about to take
impeachment action against him. But
Buhler insisted the Board members had
already been approved and the
impeachment was official.
Buhler has left Stanford and could
not be reached. But Whitesides
confirmed that Buhler deliberately
"misrepresented himself and portrayed
himself as conciliator" to Casey.
Whitesides said his faction had few
qualms about trying to trick Casey
because Casey's late candidacy was
unethical.
Buhler and Casey went before the
Santa Clara County YR's, which has
jurisdiction over the Stanford chapter.
Casey won the debate with his
arguments against Buhler's
impeachment effort.
'Not Liberal'
Looking back on the dispute, Casey
said that Buhler's faction opposed him
because he was "not a liberal
Republican."
Whitesides said that Casey won the
election through his personal skill as a
"very good power politician."
Despite last spring's turmoil, the
YR's continue to function both here at
Stanford and around the country. In
1968, the Young Republicans had a
membership of half a million, mostly
on college campuses. Membership in
the Stanford YR's totaled about 136
last year.
Began In '36
The national YR's began in New
England after World War I. The
organization was founded around 1936
and grew quickly after World War 11.
Some county headquarters of the
YR's have expelled the college YR's
under their jurisdiction, fearing he
latter might become dominant. In
California, the county and college
organizations work together peacefully.
The Young Republicans'
counterparts, the Young Democrats,
were virtually abolished when President
Johnson was irked by the YD's antiwar
position.
The YR's, in contrast, have been
influential in the Republican Party.
According to Casey, they were
instrumental in getting Barry
Goldwater the 1 964 Presidential
nomination.
Aside from support for candidates,

YR activity is usually low-keyed
because, according to Casey, "It's
difficult to get people working when
there isn't an election just around the
corner."
FCM
The only connection the YK's have
with the Free Campus Movement
(FCM) is that many FCM members also
belong to the Young Republicans. The
FCM concentrates mainly on
on-campus activity while the YR's arc
involved with off-campus politics.
The national Young Americans for
Freedom (YAF) was formed by active
YR's, and at times the two groups have
worked closely together. But the YR's
are working for President Nixon'f
re-election while the YAF is supporting
Ronald Reagan for the Presidency.
Casey sees supplying new Republican
leadership and feeding the competitive
sense within the Party as the principle
Young Republican functions.
