# Seale Speaks At Mem Chu
## 
### 
Bobby Seale, Chairman of the Black
Panther Party, will make his second
campus appearance within a month,
tonight at 8:00 p.m. in Memorial
Church. A $1.50 donation will be asked
at the door.
Seale will discuss "revolutionary
intercommunalism," the militant
Panthers' current emphasis on "survival
programs." The programs involve free
food, shoes, medical aid, and other
services to poor people.
Seale made a surprise appearance on
campus Nov. 9, substituting for a
scheduled speaker.
A second speaker tonight will be
Don Williams, president of the
Midpeninsula Sickle Cell Anemia
Foundation.
Seale's speech, which will be
broadcast live on KZSU, is being
sponsored by the Black Students Union
(BSU) and the Intercommunal Survival
Committee (ISC).
