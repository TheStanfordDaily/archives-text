# Women Rally For Abortion
## 
### 
Women rallied to repeal all abortioh
laws on Saturday in San Francisco,
Washington D.C. and New York,
bringing a topic into the headlines
which was taboo ten years ago.
Some 2,000 participants marched
from Embarcadero Plaza to the Civic
Center. The crowd dwindled down to
about 300 as the speakers, including
Pat Maginnis, president of the Society
for Humane Abortion and Helen
Meyers, regional-coordinator for the
national abortion coalition, presented
the position of the Women's National
Abortion Action Coalition.
Speakers urged repealing all abortion
laws in order to insure a woman's right
to choose about having children,
"restrictive contraception" and "forced
sterilization."
"Women must have the right to
control their own bodies" declared Dr.
Sadja Goldsmith, a gynecologist who
heads a Planned Parenthood Clinic in
the Bay Area.
Although some expressed
disappointment and even surprise that
the crowd was not larger, one
participant said, "The fact that it
happened at all is fantastic because
abortion was always a secret thing, not
something to have a rally about."
Forces supporting laws against
abortion rallied at the same time in
Union Square, but no noticeable
problems with the group appeared.
The loudest noise of the day came
when a women's rock group called
Sappho performed in Civic Center.
