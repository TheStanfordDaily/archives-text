# Indians Dump Cal, 14-0
## 
### CHARLIE HOFFMAN Sports Editor 
After Stanford's methodical 14-0 victory over Cal
Saturday in the 7 4 th Big Game, Pete Lazetich and Greg
Sampson went over to the Bears' rooting section to regain
possession of the Axe that they and their teammates had so
clearly earned.
It was fitting thai the Thunder Chickens reclaimed the
Axe, because they played possibly the biggest part in a
magnificent defensive effort that held the Bears to 62 yards
total offense until the last two minutes of the game when
Cal quarterback Jay Cruze piloted a desperation 61 yard
drive that stalled on the Card 33 yard line.
Rose Bowl Wrapped Up
Stanford's convincing win ended all speculation about
the Bears' chances of going to the Rose Bowl through
favorable federal court and Pac-8 rulings. As a first step
towards a possible trip to Pasadena, Cal had to beat the
league leading Indians, and Coach John Ralston's players
decided the whole complicated issue on the football field
Saturday.
Although the Indians outgunned a good Bear team in
every phase of the game, prompting Ralston to praise his
men for playing their first "complete game," much of the
usual Big Game excitement was missing. For all its
importance, this year's battle was such a ho-hum affair that
even the band was restrained. Wells Twombly commented
in his Sunday column in the San Francisco Examiner that,
"Not only was it a dull game, the usually insulting Stanford
band put on one of its greyest halftime shows in years, a
salute to brush fire wars or something."
The excitement on the Card sideline never waned,
however, as the squad relentlessly pursued a strong

Berkeley team that was in the (jame all the way except for
one big Stanford play.
The Indians had taken the ball on their own seven with
five minutes left in the half, and moved up to the Cal 4 2 on
the fine running of Jim Kehl and Vie Lamanuzzi and a 19
yard pass to Bill Scott. A holding penalty moved the ball
back into Stanford territory to the 4 2 where Don Bunce hit
Jackie Brown for about 10 yards over the middle after he
had swung out of the backfield. Brown took the ball in
while running at top speed and with a few fine moves plus a
devastating downfield block by Reggie Sanderson, Brown
streaked down the Cal sideline into the endzone to
complete the 58 yard play and give the Indians their first
score. The whole stadium watched nervously on the extra
point attempt, but Rod Garcia showed no signs of last
week's performance as he drilled the ball through the
uprights to give his squad a 7-0 lead.
Control And Confidence
It was a controlled and confident Stanford squad that
soundly defeated a California team that has beaten four
Pac-8 opponents this year in the closing seconds of the
game. Pete Lazetich explained the attitude of the victorious
Indians. "There was a lot of emotion on the field, but we
knew that we were going to win. We were really confident.
Confidence to me is the greatest emotion."
Jeff Siemon also attempted to verbalize the team's
feelings towards the Cal game. "We were ready. We were
not as enthusiastic as the SC game last year or the Rose
Bowl. But we knew that we had to play well today. It is
hard to get super excited unless you are the underdog."
The Indians felt that they had to win the Big Came in
order to command any respect and generate any spirit for
