# Indians Dump Cal, 14-0
## 
### CHARLIE HOFFMAN Sports Editor 
After Stanford's methodical 14-0 victory over Cal
Saturday in the 7 4 th Big Game, Pete Lazetich and Greg
Sampson went over to the Bears' rooting section to regain
possession of the Axe that they and their teammates had so
clearly earned.
It was fitting thai the Thunder Chickens reclaimed the
Axe, because they played possibly the biggest part in a
magnificent defensive effort that held the Bears to 62 yards
total offense until the last two minutes of the game when
Cal quarterback Jay Cruze piloted a desperation 61 yard
drive that stalled on the Card 33 yard line.
Rose Bowl Wrapped Up
Stanford's convincing win ended all speculation about
the Bears' chances of going to the Rose Bowl through
favorable federal court and Pac-8 rulings. As a first step
towards a possible trip to Pasadena, Cal had to beat the
league leading Indians, and Coach John Ralston's players
decided the whole complicated issue on the football field
Saturday.
Although the Indians outgunned a good Bear team in
every phase of the game, prompting Ralston to praise his
men for playing their first "complete game," much of the
usual Big Game excitement was missing. For all its
importance, this year's battle was such a ho-hum affair that
even the band was restrained. Wells Twombly commented
in his Sunday column in the San Francisco Examiner that,
"Not only was it a dull game, the usually insulting Stanford
band put on one of its greyest halftime shows in years, a
salute to brush fire wars or something."
The excitement on the Card sideline never waned,
however, as the squad relentlessly pursued a strong

Berkeley team that was in the (jame all the way except for
one big Stanford play.
The Indians had taken the ball on their own seven with
five minutes left in the half, and moved up to the Cal 4 2 on
the fine running of Jim Kehl and Vie Lamanuzzi and a 19
yard pass to Bill Scott. A holding penalty moved the ball
back into Stanford territory to the 4 2 where Don Bunce hit
Jackie Brown for about 10 yards over the middle after he
had swung out of the backfield. Brown took the ball in
while running at top speed and with a few fine moves plus a
devastating downfield block by Reggie Sanderson, Brown
streaked down the Cal sideline into the endzone to
complete the 58 yard play and give the Indians their first
score. The whole stadium watched nervously on the extra
point attempt, but Rod Garcia showed no signs of last
week's performance as he drilled the ball through the
uprights to give his squad a 7-0 lead.
Control And Confidence
It was a controlled and confident Stanford squad that
soundly defeated a California team that has beaten four
Pac-8 opponents this year in the closing seconds of the
game. Pete Lazetich explained the attitude of the victorious
Indians. "There was a lot of emotion on the field, but we
knew that we were going to win. We were really confident.
Confidence to me is the greatest emotion."
Jeff Siemon also attempted to verbalize the team's
feelings towards the Cal game. "We were ready. We were
not as enthusiastic as the SC game last year or the Rose
Bowl. But we knew that we had to play well today. It is
hard to get super excited unless you are the underdog."
The Indians felt that they had to win the Big Came in
order to command any respect and generate any spirit for
the Rose Bowl. Bunce exemplified
this attitude, stating that, "We
had to win this one in order to go
to the Rose Bowl with any kind
of momentum at all. Last year
against Cal we lost because our
fundamentals broke down. This
year we played a complete game."
Ralston felt that the offense
and defense achieved the best
balance of any game played this
year, although defense dominated
the first quarter of the contest
played before a Stanford stadium
crowd of 86,000. Cal took the
opening kickoff and made one
first down on a Stanford penalty
and had to give up the ball. On
the Indians' second play from
scrimmage at their 20 yard line,
John Winesberry dropped a pitch
back on a reverse. Winesberry
recovered his own fumble, but he
had the whole field open ahead of
him if he had held onto the ball.
Ralston felt that Winesberry
would have "gone all the way."
Winesberry came right back,
however, catching an 11 yard pass
for an apparent first down. The
officials spotted the ball just short
of the first, and Stanford was
forced to punt. Each team had
possession of the ball twice more
in the first quarter, but could not
generate a significant drive. Steve
Murray's booming punts kept the
Bears from getting good field
position, and the Thunder
Chickens took care of the rest.
Under Jay Cruze's leadership,
Cal tried to establish a running
game with Isaac Curtis and Steve
Kemnitzer. These efforts were
unsuccessful as the Indians
defense was even able to stop the
option play that has pestered
them during the last half of the
season. After the game, Mike
Simone said that, "They thought
that they could run against us, but
I don't think that anyone can run
against us all day."
Stanford was also trying to
establish a running game in the

first quarter, but could not do
much better than Cal. Although
the Card runners totalled 148
yards in rushing offense, most of
their success came on short passes
after swinging out of the
back field.
Go For The Touchdown
Stanford's first scoring
opportunity came at the
beginning of the second quarter
when Mike Simone recovered a
fumble by Curtis at the Cal 31
yard line. Jackie Brown went for
21 yards on the first play after
taking a pitch from Bunce. Three
running plays took the Cards
down to the three yard line.
Stanford went for the touchdown
on fourth and goal and Bunce was
dropped for a two yard loss trying
to skirt the left end.
Ralston explained that, "Early
in the game we wanted to go for
touchdowns. But 1 was concerned
when we got down there early and
could not score." It seemed as if
the Indians were going to once
again pile up a lot of yardage
without scoring, but the offense
soon put together that 93 yard
drive capped by Browns 58 yard
touchdown pass.
Stanford's onside kick failed,
but the Thunder Chickens held
once again. The Cards could not
mount a drive and relinquished
the ball to the Bears with a
minute left in the half. The Tribe
defense forced another punt,
allowing Cal only one yard in
three plays, and Eric Cross took
the kick and ran out of bounds
with five seconds left. Cross
re-pulled his hamstring on that
play and missed the rest of the
game, but will be ready for the
Rose Bowl. The offense could not
take advantage of the last play of
the half, and the teams left the
field with the Indians on top, 7 -0 .
Cal Threatens
Cal threatened for the first time
in the game on the second series
of the third quarter. Cruze began
hitting the Bear's all-time leading

receiver, Geoff DeLapp, and
moved down to the Indian 24.
Benny Barnes nailed Kemnitzer
for a seven yard loss on a
pitch-out, and on the next play,
Tim Robnett jumped over the
back of Bill Stowers to pick off
Cruze's pass to his tight end.
Robnett's spectacular play
provided the momentum for the
offense which took the ball on the
2 4 and moved upfield on the
running of Brown and Sanderson.
The big play of the drive came on
a 27 yard pass to Brown over the
middle on the same play he scored
on earlier. With a first and 10 on
the 15 , the Indians moved the ball
in for the score in three plays,
with Sanderson picking up the six
points on a 1 yard plunge.
Once again, the crowd viewed
Garcia's extra point attempt with
apprehension, but the nation's
leading kicker came through again
to the wild cheers of the Stadium
fans.
A penalty and an out of bounds
kick resulted in Garcia finally
kicking off from his own 30 yard
line. Cal had good field position
on its own 35, but Cruze had
another pass intercepted by
Robnett on the first play. Cruze
threw a bomb which Robnett
took over his shoulder while
running alongside the Bear
receiver. Cal recovered a fumble
by Miles Moore after catching a
short pass, but could not
penetrate the Card defense after
taking the ball at mid-field and
punted.
After this, neither team could

move to within field goal range as
both defenses stiffened. Towards
the end of the fourth quarter, the
Stanford attack stayed mostly on
the ground in an attempt to run
out the clock, and the score
remained at 14-0.
The only drive in the fourth
quarter came after Don Alvarado
downed a Murray punt on the Cal
one yard line. The Bears moved
down to the Stanford 3 8 where
the drive stalled. Two runs by
Kehl ran out the clock and the
Indians went across the field to
get back the Axe.
Jackie Brown had one of his
finest days for Stanford, running
for 56 yards and catching 7 passes
for 119 yards to lead the team in
both categories for the afternoon.
He was voted offensive player of
the game for his efforts. Tim
Robnett was named defensive
player of the game for his two
interceptions, and the assistance
he gave the linebackers in
stopping (Jal's option.
'Gutty Performance'
Don Bunce passed for 211
yards and ran for another 24 in
what Ralston termed "a real gutty
performance." Playing with back
problems that kept him out of
workouts during the week, Bunce
broke his nose in the third quarter
but came back soon thereafter to
keep moving the team and ensure
Stanford's Big Game victory.
The Rose Bowl bound Indians
will now take about three weeks
off, with practices resuming either
on December 11th or 13 th.
Ralston expects to have all his
players healthy by then.

NOW WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITII IT?—Reggie Sanderson takes a handoff from Don Bunce as
he prepares to leap over Cal's defenders from the one yard line to score Stanford's second and final
touchdown. Middle linebacker Paul Giroday (94) braces to stop Sanderson while center Dennis Sheehan
moves over a fallen Bear lineman to hit Giroday. Younger Klippert (6 3) can be seen to the left of Sheehan
leading the way for Sanderson.

JACKIE'S DAY- Jackie Brown hangs onto a Don Bunce pass for dear
life as Bill Meyers looks on. For the first time this year, Brown was
used frequently as a pass receiver, a tactic which paid off well, as
Brown caught seven aerials for 119 yards to lead all receivers in the
' 4 ig Game. Brown would swing out of the backfield and streak down
t!>f middle, and this play resulted in a 58 yard touchdown and
another time went for 2 7 yards down to the California 15 to set up
the Indians' second touchdown.

yards and ran for another 24 in
what Ralston termed "a real gutty
performance." Playing with back
problems that kept him out of
workouts during the week, Bunce
broke his nose in the third quarter
but came back soon thereafter to
keep moving the team and ensure
Stanford's Big Game victory.
The Rose Bowl bound Indians
will now take about three weeks
off, with practices resuming either
on December 11th or 13 th.
Ralston expects to have all his
players healthy by then.

JACKIE'S DAY- Jackie Brown hangs onto a Don Bunce pass for dear
life as Bill Meyers looks on. For the first time this year, Brown was
used frequently as a pass receiver, a tactic which paid off well, as
Brown caught seven aerials for 119 yards to lead all receivers in the
' 4 ig Game. Brown would swing out of the backfield and streak down
t!>f middle, and this play resulted in a 58 yard touchdown and
another time went for 2 7 yards down to the California 15 to set up
the Indians' second touchdown.
After Stanford's methodical 14-0 victory over Cal
Saturday in the 7 4 th Big Game, Pete Lazetich and Greg
Sampson went over to the Bears' rooting section to regain
possession of the Axe that they and their teammates had so
clearly earned.
It was fitting thai the Thunder Chickens reclaimed the
Axe, because they played possibly the biggest part in a
magnificent defensive effort that held the Bears to 62 yards
total offense until the last two minutes of the game when
Cal quarterback Jay Cruze piloted a desperation 61 yard
drive that stalled on the Card 33 yard line.
Rose Bowl Wrapped Up
Stanford's convincing win ended all speculation about
the Bears' chances of going to the Rose Bowl through
favorable federal court and Pac-8 rulings. As a first step
towards a possible trip to Pasadena, Cal had to beat the
league leading Indians, and Coach John Ralston's players
decided the whole complicated issue on the football field
Saturday.
Although the Indians outgunned a good Bear team in
every phase of the game, prompting Ralston to praise his
men for playing their first "complete game," much of the
usual Big Game excitement was missing. For all its
importance, this year's battle was such a ho-hum affair that
even the band was restrained. Wells Twombly commented
in his Sunday column in the San Francisco Examiner that,
"Not only was it a dull game, the usually insulting Stanford
band put on one of its greyest halftime shows in years, a
salute to brush fire wars or something."
The excitement on the Card sideline never waned,
however, as the squad relentlessly pursued a strong

Berkeley team that was in the (jame all the way except for
one big Stanford play.
The Indians had taken the ball on their own seven with
five minutes left in the half, and moved up to the Cal 4 2 on
the fine running of Jim Kehl and Vie Lamanuzzi and a 19
yard pass to Bill Scott. A holding penalty moved the ball
back into Stanford territory to the 4 2 where Don Bunce hit
Jackie Brown for about 10 yards over the middle after he
had swung out of the backfield. Brown took the ball in
while running at top speed and with a few fine moves plus a
devastating downfield block by Reggie Sanderson, Brown
streaked down the Cal sideline into the endzone to
complete the 58 yard play and give the Indians their first
score. The whole stadium watched nervously on the extra
point attempt, but Rod Garcia showed no signs of last
week's performance as he drilled the ball through the
uprights to give his squad a 7-0 lead.
Control And Confidence
It was a controlled and confident Stanford squad that
soundly defeated a California team that has beaten four
Pac-8 opponents this year in the closing seconds of the
game. Pete Lazetich explained the attitude of the victorious
Indians. "There was a lot of emotion on the field, but we
knew that we were going to win. We were really confident.
Confidence to me is the greatest emotion."
Jeff Siemon also attempted to verbalize the team's
feelings towards the Cal game. "We were ready. We were
not as enthusiastic as the SC game last year or the Rose
Bowl. But we knew that we had to play well today. It is
hard to get super excited unless you are the underdog."
The Indians felt that they had to win the Big Came in
order to command any respect and generate any spirit for
the Rose Bowl. Bunce exemplified
this attitude, stating that, "We
had to win this one in order to go
to the Rose Bowl with any kind
of momentum at all. Last year
against Cal we lost because our
fundamentals broke down. This
year we played a complete game."
Ralston felt that the offense
and defense achieved the best
balance of any game played this
year, although defense dominated
the first quarter of the contest
played before a Stanford stadium
crowd of 86,000. Cal took the
opening kickoff and made one
first down on a Stanford penalty
and had to give up the ball. On
the Indians' second play from
scrimmage at their 20 yard line,
John Winesberry dropped a pitch
back on a reverse. Winesberry
recovered his own fumble, but he
had the whole field open ahead of
him if he had held onto the ball.
Ralston felt that Winesberry
would have "gone all the way."
Winesberry came right back,
however, catching an 11 yard pass
for an apparent first down. The
officials spotted the ball just short
of the first, and Stanford was
forced to punt. Each team had
possession of the ball twice more
in the first quarter, but could not
generate a significant drive. Steve
Murray's booming punts kept the
Bears from getting good field
position, and the Thunder
Chickens took care of the rest.
Under Jay Cruze's leadership,
Cal tried to establish a running
game with Isaac Curtis and Steve
Kemnitzer. These efforts were
unsuccessful as the Indians
defense was even able to stop the
option play that has pestered
them during the last half of the
season. After the game, Mike
Simone said that, "They thought
that they could run against us, but
I don't think that anyone can run
against us all day."
Stanford was also trying to
establish a running game in the

first quarter, but could not do
much better than Cal. Although
the Card runners totalled 148
yards in rushing offense, most of
their success came on short passes
after swinging out of the
back field.
Go For The Touchdown
Stanford's first scoring
opportunity came at the
beginning of the second quarter
when Mike Simone recovered a
fumble by Curtis at the Cal 31
yard line. Jackie Brown went for
21 yards on the first play after
taking a pitch from Bunce. Three
running plays took the Cards
down to the three yard line.
Stanford went for the touchdown
on fourth and goal and Bunce was
dropped for a two yard loss trying
to skirt the left end.
Ralston explained that, "Early
in the game we wanted to go for
touchdowns. But 1 was concerned
when we got down there early and
could not score." It seemed as if
the Indians were going to once
again pile up a lot of yardage
without scoring, but the offense
soon put together that 93 yard
drive capped by Browns 58 yard
touchdown pass.
Stanford's onside kick failed,
but the Thunder Chickens held
once again. The Cards could not
mount a drive and relinquished
the ball to the Bears with a
minute left in the half. The Tribe
defense forced another punt,
allowing Cal only one yard in
three plays, and Eric Cross took
the kick and ran out of bounds
with five seconds left. Cross
re-pulled his hamstring on that
play and missed the rest of the
game, but will be ready for the
Rose Bowl. The offense could not
take advantage of the last play of
the half, and the teams left the
field with the Indians on top, 7 -0 .
Cal Threatens
Cal threatened for the first time
in the game on the second series
of the third quarter. Cruze began
hitting the Bear's all-time leading

receiver, Geoff DeLapp, and
moved down to the Indian 24.
Benny Barnes nailed Kemnitzer
for a seven yard loss on a
pitch-out, and on the next play,
Tim Robnett jumped over the
back of Bill Stowers to pick off
Cruze's pass to his tight end.
Robnett's spectacular play
provided the momentum for the
offense which took the ball on the
2 4 and moved upfield on the
running of Brown and Sanderson.
The big play of the drive came on
a 27 yard pass to Brown over the
middle on the same play he scored
on earlier. With a first and 10 on
the 15 , the Indians moved the ball
in for the score in three plays,
with Sanderson picking up the six
points on a 1 yard plunge.
Once again, the crowd viewed
Garcia's extra point attempt with
apprehension, but the nation's
leading kicker came through again
to the wild cheers of the Stadium
fans.
A penalty and an out of bounds
kick resulted in Garcia finally
kicking off from his own 30 yard
line. Cal had good field position
on its own 35, but Cruze had
another pass intercepted by
Robnett on the first play. Cruze
threw a bomb which Robnett
took over his shoulder while
running alongside the Bear
receiver. Cal recovered a fumble
by Miles Moore after catching a
short pass, but could not
penetrate the Card defense after
taking the ball at mid-field and
punted.
After this, neither team could

move to within field goal range as
both defenses stiffened. Towards
the end of the fourth quarter, the
Stanford attack stayed mostly on
the ground in an attempt to run
out the clock, and the score
remained at 14-0.
The only drive in the fourth
quarter came after Don Alvarado
downed a Murray punt on the Cal
one yard line. The Bears moved
down to the Stanford 3 8 where
the drive stalled. Two runs by
Kehl ran out the clock and the
Indians went across the field to
get back the Axe.
Jackie Brown had one of his
finest days for Stanford, running
for 56 yards and catching 7 passes
for 119 yards to lead the team in
both categories for the afternoon.
He was voted offensive player of
the game for his efforts. Tim
Robnett was named defensive
player of the game for his two
interceptions, and the assistance
he gave the linebackers in
stopping (Jal's option.
'Gutty Performance'
Don Bunce passed for 211
yards and ran for another 24 in
what Ralston termed "a real gutty
performance." Playing with back
problems that kept him out of

kicking off from his own 30 yard
line. Cal had good field position
on its own 35, but Cruze had
another pass intercepted by
Robnett on the first play. Cruze
threw a bomb which Robnett
took over his shoulder while
running alongside the Bear
receiver. Cal recovered a fumble
by Miles Moore after catching a
short pass, but could not
penetrate the Card defense after
taking the ball at mid-field and
punted.
After this, neither team could

move to within field goal range as
both defenses stiffened. Towards
the end of the fourth quarter, the
Stanford attack stayed mostly on
the ground in an attempt to run
out the clock, and the score
remained at 14-0.
The only drive in the fourth
quarter came after Don Alvarado
downed a Murray punt on the Cal
one yard line. The Bears moved
down to the Stanford 3 8 where
the drive stalled. Two runs by
Kehl ran out the clock and the
Indians went across the field to
get back the Axe.
Jackie Brown had one of his
finest days for Stanford, running
for 56 yards and catching 7 passes
for 119 yards to lead the team in
both categories for the afternoon.
He was voted offensive player of
the game for his efforts. Tim
Robnett was named defensive
player of the game for his two
interceptions, and the assistance
he gave the linebackers in
stopping (Jal's option.
'Gutty Performance'
Don Bunce passed for 211
yards and ran for another 24 in
what Ralston termed "a real gutty
performance." Playing with back
problems that kept him out of
workouts during the week, Bunce
broke his nose in the third quarter
but came back soon thereafter to
keep moving the team and ensure
Stanford's Big Game victory.
The Rose Bowl bound Indians
will now take about three weeks
off, with practices resuming either
on December 11th or 13 th.
Ralston expects to have all his
players healthy by then.

JACKIE'S DAY- Jackie Brown hangs onto a Don Bunce pass for dear
life as Bill Meyers looks on. For the first time this year, Brown was
used frequently as a pass receiver, a tactic which paid off well, as
Brown caught seven aerials for 119 yards to lead all receivers in the
' 4 ig Game. Brown would swing out of the backfield and streak down
t!>f middle, and this play resulted in a 58 yard touchdown and
another time went for 2 7 yards down to the California 15 to set up
the Indians' second touchdown.
After Stanford's methodical 14-0 victory over Cal
Saturday in the 7 4 th Big Game, Pete Lazetich and Greg
Sampson went over to the Bears' rooting section to regain
possession of the Axe that they and their teammates had so
clearly earned.
It was fitting thai the Thunder Chickens reclaimed the
Axe, because they played possibly the biggest part in a
magnificent defensive effort that held the Bears to 62 yards
total offense until the last two minutes of the game when
Cal quarterback Jay Cruze piloted a desperation 61 yard
drive that stalled on the Card 33 yard line.
Rose Bowl Wrapped Up
Stanford's convincing win ended all speculation about
the Bears' chances of going to the Rose Bowl through
favorable federal court and Pac-8 rulings. As a first step
towards a possible trip to Pasadena, Cal had to beat the
league leading Indians, and Coach John Ralston's players
decided the whole complicated issue on the football field
Saturday.
Although the Indians outgunned a good Bear team in
every phase of the game, prompting Ralston to praise his
men for playing their first "complete game," much of the
usual Big Game excitement was missing. For all its
importance, this year's battle was such a ho-hum affair that
even the band was restrained. Wells Twombly commented
in his Sunday column in the San Francisco Examiner that,
"Not only was it a dull game, the usually insulting Stanford
band put on one of its greyest halftime shows in years, a
salute to brush fire wars or something."
The excitement on the Card sideline never waned,
however, as the squad relentlessly pursued a strong

Berkeley team that was in the (jame all the way except for
one big Stanford play.
The Indians had taken the ball on their own seven with
five minutes left in the half, and moved up to the Cal 4 2 on
the fine running of Jim Kehl and Vie Lamanuzzi and a 19
yard pass to Bill Scott. A holding penalty moved the ball
back into Stanford territory to the 4 2 where Don Bunce hit
Jackie Brown for about 10 yards over the middle after he
had swung out of the backfield. Brown took the ball in
while running at top speed and with a few fine moves plus a
devastating downfield block by Reggie Sanderson, Brown
streaked down the Cal sideline into the endzone to
complete the 58 yard play and give the Indians their first
score. The whole stadium watched nervously on the extra
point attempt, but Rod Garcia showed no signs of last
week's performance as he drilled the ball through the
uprights to give his squad a 7-0 lead.
Control And Confidence
It was a controlled and confident Stanford squad that
soundly defeated a California team that has beaten four
Pac-8 opponents this year in the closing seconds of the
game. Pete Lazetich explained the attitude of the victorious
Indians. "There was a lot of emotion on the field, but we
knew that we were going to win. We were really confident.
Confidence to me is the greatest emotion."
Jeff Siemon also attempted to verbalize the team's
feelings towards the Cal game. "We were ready. We were
not as enthusiastic as the SC game last year or the Rose
Bowl. But we knew that we had to play well today. It is
hard to get super excited unless you are the underdog."
The Indians felt that they had to win the Big Came in
order to command any respect and generate any spirit for
the Rose Bowl. Bunce exemplified
this attitude, stating that, "We
had to win this one in order to go
to the Rose Bowl with any kind
of momentum at all. Last year
against Cal we lost because our
fundamentals broke down. This
year we played a complete game."
Ralston felt that the offense
and defense achieved the best
balance of any game played this
year, although defense dominated
the first quarter of the contest
played before a Stanford stadium
crowd of 86,000. Cal took the
opening kickoff and made one
first down on a Stanford penalty
and had to give up the ball. On
the Indians' second play from
scrimmage at their 20 yard line,
John Winesberry dropped a pitch
back on a reverse. Winesberry
recovered his own fumble, but he
had the whole field open ahead of
him if he had held onto the ball.
Ralston felt that Winesberry
would have "gone all the way."
Winesberry came right back,
however, catching an 11 yard pass
for an apparent first down. The
officials spotted the ball just short
of the first, and Stanford was
forced to punt. Each team had
possession of the ball twice more
in the first quarter, but could not
generate a significant drive. Steve
Murray's booming punts kept the
Bears from getting good field
position, and the Thunder
Chickens took care of the rest.
Under Jay Cruze's leadership,
Cal tried to establish a running
game with Isaac Curtis and Steve
Kemnitzer. These efforts were
unsuccessful as the Indians
defense was even able to stop the
option play that has pestered
them during the last half of the
season. After the game, Mike
Simone said that, "They thought
that they could run against us, but
I don't think that anyone can run
against us all day."
Stanford was also trying to
establish a running game in the

first quarter, but could not do
much better than Cal. Although
the Card runners totalled 148
yards in rushing offense, most of
their success came on short passes
after swinging out of the
back field.
Go For The Touchdown
Stanford's first scoring
opportunity came at the
beginning of the second quarter
when Mike Simone recovered a
fumble by Curtis at the Cal 31
yard line. Jackie Brown went for
21 yards on the first play after
taking a pitch from Bunce. Three
running plays took the Cards
down to the three yard line.
Stanford went for the touchdown
on fourth and goal and Bunce was
dropped for a two yard loss trying
to skirt the left end.
Ralston explained that, "Early
in the game we wanted to go for
touchdowns. But 1 was concerned
when we got down there early and
could not score." It seemed as if
the Indians were going to once
again pile up a lot of yardage
without scoring, but the offense
soon put together that 93 yard
drive capped by Browns 58 yard
touchdown pass.
Stanford's onside kick failed,
but the Thunder Chickens held
once again. The Cards could not
mount a drive and relinquished
the ball to the Bears with a
minute left in the half. The Tribe
defense forced another punt,
allowing Cal only one yard in
three plays, and Eric Cross took
the kick and ran out of bounds
with five seconds left. Cross
re-pulled his hamstring on that
play and missed the rest of the
game, but will be ready for the
Rose Bowl. The offense could not
take advantage of the last play of
the half, and the teams left the
field with the Indians on top, 7 -0 .
Cal Threatens
Cal threatened for the first time
in the game on the second series
of the third quarter. Cruze began
hitting the Bear's all-time leading

receiver, Geoff DeLapp, and
moved down to the Indian 24.
Benny Barnes nailed Kemnitzer
for a seven yard loss on a
pitch-out, and on the next play,
Tim Robnett jumped over the
back of Bill Stowers to pick off
Cruze's pass to his tight end.
Robnett's spectacular play
provided the momentum for the
offense which took the ball on the
2 4 and moved upfield on the
running of Brown and Sanderson.
The big play of the drive came on
a 27 yard pass to Brown over the
middle on the same play he scored
on earlier. With a first and 10 on
the 15 , the Indians moved the ball
in for the score in three plays,
with Sanderson picking up the six
points on a 1 yard plunge.
Once again, the crowd viewed
Garcia's extra point attempt with
apprehension, but the nation's
leading kicker came through again
to the wild cheers of the Stadium
fans.
A penalty and an out of bounds
kick resulted in Garcia finally
kicking off from his own 30 yard
line. Cal had good field position
on its own 35, but Cruze had
another pass intercepted by
Robnett on the first play. Cruze
threw a bomb which Robnett
took over his shoulder while
running alongside the Bear
receiver. Cal recovered a fumble

with five seconds left. Cross
re-pulled his hamstring on that
play and missed the rest of the
game, but will be ready for the
Rose Bowl. The offense could not
take advantage of the last play of
the half, and the teams left the
field with the Indians on top, 7 -0 .
Cal Threatens
Cal threatened for the first time
in the game on the second series
of the third quarter. Cruze began
hitting the Bear's all-time leading

receiver, Geoff DeLapp, and
moved down to the Indian 24.
Benny Barnes nailed Kemnitzer
for a seven yard loss on a
pitch-out, and on the next play,
Tim Robnett jumped over the
back of Bill Stowers to pick off
Cruze's pass to his tight end.
Robnett's spectacular play
provided the momentum for the
offense which took the ball on the
2 4 and moved upfield on the
running of Brown and Sanderson.
The big play of the drive came on
a 27 yard pass to Brown over the
middle on the same play he scored
on earlier. With a first and 10 on
the 15 , the Indians moved the ball
in for the score in three plays,
with Sanderson picking up the six
points on a 1 yard plunge.
Once again, the crowd viewed
Garcia's extra point attempt with
apprehension, but the nation's
leading kicker came through again
to the wild cheers of the Stadium
fans.
A penalty and an out of bounds
kick resulted in Garcia finally
kicking off from his own 30 yard
line. Cal had good field position
on its own 35, but Cruze had
another pass intercepted by
Robnett on the first play. Cruze
threw a bomb which Robnett
took over his shoulder while
running alongside the Bear
receiver. Cal recovered a fumble
by Miles Moore after catching a
short pass, but could not
penetrate the Card defense after
taking the ball at mid-field and
punted.
After this, neither team could

move to within field goal range as
both defenses stiffened. Towards
the end of the fourth quarter, the
Stanford attack stayed mostly on
the ground in an attempt to run
out the clock, and the score
remained at 14-0.
The only drive in the fourth
quarter came after Don Alvarado
downed a Murray punt on the Cal
one yard line. The Bears moved
down to the Stanford 3 8 where
the drive stalled. Two runs by
Kehl ran out the clock and the
Indians went across the field to
get back the Axe.
Jackie Brown had one of his
finest days for Stanford, running
for 56 yards and catching 7 passes
for 119 yards to lead the team in
both categories for the afternoon.
He was voted offensive player of
the game for his efforts. Tim
Robnett was named defensive
player of the game for his two
interceptions, and the assistance
he gave the linebackers in
stopping (Jal's option.
'Gutty Performance'
Don Bunce passed for 211
yards and ran for another 24 in
what Ralston termed "a real gutty
performance." Playing with back
problems that kept him out of
workouts during the week, Bunce
broke his nose in the third quarter
but came back soon thereafter to
keep moving the team and ensure
Stanford's Big Game victory.
The Rose Bowl bound Indians
will now take about three weeks
off, with practices resuming either
on December 11th or 13 th.
Ralston expects to have all his
players healthy by then.

JACKIE'S DAY- Jackie Brown hangs onto a Don Bunce pass for dear
life as Bill Meyers looks on. For the first time this year, Brown was
used frequently as a pass receiver, a tactic which paid off well, as
Brown caught seven aerials for 119 yards to lead all receivers in the
' 4 ig Game. Brown would swing out of the backfield and streak down
t!>f middle, and this play resulted in a 58 yard touchdown and
another time went for 2 7 yards down to the California 15 to set up
the Indians' second touchdown.
After Stanford's methodical 14-0 victory over Cal
Saturday in the 7 4 th Big Game, Pete Lazetich and Greg
Sampson went over to the Bears' rooting section to regain
possession of the Axe that they and their teammates had so
clearly earned.
It was fitting thai the Thunder Chickens reclaimed the
Axe, because they played possibly the biggest part in a
magnificent defensive effort that held the Bears to 62 yards
total offense until the last two minutes of the game when
Cal quarterback Jay Cruze piloted a desperation 61 yard
drive that stalled on the Card 33 yard line.
Rose Bowl Wrapped Up
Stanford's convincing win ended all speculation about
the Bears' chances of going to the Rose Bowl through
favorable federal court and Pac-8 rulings. As a first step
towards a possible trip to Pasadena, Cal had to beat the
league leading Indians, and Coach John Ralston's players
decided the whole complicated issue on the football field
Saturday.
Although the Indians outgunned a good Bear team in
every phase of the game, prompting Ralston to praise his
men for playing their first "complete game," much of the
usual Big Game excitement was missing. For all its
importance, this year's battle was such a ho-hum affair that
even the band was restrained. Wells Twombly commented
in his Sunday column in the San Francisco Examiner that,
"Not only was it a dull game, the usually insulting Stanford
band put on one of its greyest halftime shows in years, a
salute to brush fire wars or something."
The excitement on the Card sideline never waned,
however, as the squad relentlessly pursued a strong

Berkeley team that was in the (jame all the way except for
one big Stanford play.
The Indians had taken the ball on their own seven with
five minutes left in the half, and moved up to the Cal 4 2 on
the fine running of Jim Kehl and Vie Lamanuzzi and a 19
yard pass to Bill Scott. A holding penalty moved the ball
back into Stanford territory to the 4 2 where Don Bunce hit
Jackie Brown for about 10 yards over the middle after he
had swung out of the backfield. Brown took the ball in
while running at top speed and with a few fine moves plus a
devastating downfield block by Reggie Sanderson, Brown
streaked down the Cal sideline into the endzone to
complete the 58 yard play and give the Indians their first
score. The whole stadium watched nervously on the extra
point attempt, but Rod Garcia showed no signs of last
week's performance as he drilled the ball through the
uprights to give his squad a 7-0 lead.
Control And Confidence
It was a controlled and confident Stanford squad that
soundly defeated a California team that has beaten four
Pac-8 opponents this year in the closing seconds of the
game. Pete Lazetich explained the attitude of the victorious
Indians. "There was a lot of emotion on the field, but we
knew that we were going to win. We were really confident.
Confidence to me is the greatest emotion."
Jeff Siemon also attempted to verbalize the team's
feelings towards the Cal game. "We were ready. We were
not as enthusiastic as the SC game last year or the Rose
Bowl. But we knew that we had to play well today. It is
hard to get super excited unless you are the underdog."
The Indians felt that they had to win the Big Came in
order to command any respect and generate any spirit for
the Rose Bowl. Bunce exemplified
this attitude, stating that, "We
had to win this one in order to go
to the Rose Bowl with any kind
of momentum at all. Last year
against Cal we lost because our
fundamentals broke down. This
year we played a complete game."
Ralston felt that the offense
and defense achieved the best
balance of any game played this
year, although defense dominated
the first quarter of the contest
played before a Stanford stadium
crowd of 86,000. Cal took the
opening kickoff and made one
first down on a Stanford penalty
and had to give up the ball. On
the Indians' second play from
scrimmage at their 20 yard line,
John Winesberry dropped a pitch
back on a reverse. Winesberry
recovered his own fumble, but he
had the whole field open ahead of
him if he had held onto the ball.
Ralston felt that Winesberry
would have "gone all the way."
Winesberry came right back,
however, catching an 11 yard pass
for an apparent first down. The
officials spotted the ball just short
of the first, and Stanford was
forced to punt. Each team had
possession of the ball twice more
in the first quarter, but could not
generate a significant drive. Steve
Murray's booming punts kept the
Bears from getting good field
position, and the Thunder
Chickens took care of the rest.
Under Jay Cruze's leadership,
Cal tried to establish a running
game with Isaac Curtis and Steve
Kemnitzer. These efforts were
unsuccessful as the Indians
defense was even able to stop the
option play that has pestered
them during the last half of the
season. After the game, Mike
Simone said that, "They thought
that they could run against us, but
I don't think that anyone can run
against us all day."
Stanford was also trying to
establish a running game in the

first quarter, but could not do
much better than Cal. Although
the Card runners totalled 148
yards in rushing offense, most of
their success came on short passes
after swinging out of the
back field.
Go For The Touchdown
Stanford's first scoring
opportunity came at the
beginning of the second quarter
when Mike Simone recovered a
fumble by Curtis at the Cal 31
yard line. Jackie Brown went for
21 yards on the first play after
taking a pitch from Bunce. Three
running plays took the Cards
down to the three yard line.
Stanford went for the touchdown
on fourth and goal and Bunce was
dropped for a two yard loss trying
to skirt the left end.
Ralston explained that, "Early
in the game we wanted to go for
touchdowns. But 1 was concerned
when we got down there early and
could not score." It seemed as if
the Indians were going to once
again pile up a lot of yardage
without scoring, but the offense
soon put together that 93 yard
drive capped by Browns 58 yard
touchdown pass.
Stanford's onside kick failed,
but the Thunder Chickens held
once again. The Cards could not
mount a drive and relinquished
the ball to the Bears with a
minute left in the half. The Tribe
defense forced another punt,
allowing Cal only one yard in
three plays, and Eric Cross took
the kick and ran out of bounds
with five seconds left. Cross
re-pulled his hamstring on that
play and missed the rest of the
game, but will be ready for the
Rose Bowl. The offense could not
take advantage of the last play of
the half, and the teams left the
field with the Indians on top, 7 -0 .

I don't think that anyone can run
against us all day."
Stanford was also trying to
establish a running game in the

first quarter, but could not do
much better than Cal. Although
the Card runners totalled 148
yards in rushing offense, most of
their success came on short passes
after swinging out of the
back field.
Go For The Touchdown
Stanford's first scoring
opportunity came at the
beginning of the second quarter
when Mike Simone recovered a
fumble by Curtis at the Cal 31
yard line. Jackie Brown went for
21 yards on the first play after
taking a pitch from Bunce. Three
running plays took the Cards
down to the three yard line.
Stanford went for the touchdown
on fourth and goal and Bunce was
dropped for a two yard loss trying
to skirt the left end.
Ralston explained that, "Early
in the game we wanted to go for
touchdowns. But 1 was concerned
when we got down there early and
could not score." It seemed as if
the Indians were going to once
again pile up a lot of yardage
without scoring, but the offense
soon put together that 93 yard
drive capped by Browns 58 yard
touchdown pass.
Stanford's onside kick failed,
but the Thunder Chickens held
once again. The Cards could not
mount a drive and relinquished
the ball to the Bears with a
minute left in the half. The Tribe
defense forced another punt,
allowing Cal only one yard in
three plays, and Eric Cross took
the kick and ran out of bounds
with five seconds left. Cross
re-pulled his hamstring on that
play and missed the rest of the
game, but will be ready for the
Rose Bowl. The offense could not
take advantage of the last play of
the half, and the teams left the
field with the Indians on top, 7 -0 .
Cal Threatens
Cal threatened for the first time
in the game on the second series
of the third quarter. Cruze began
hitting the Bear's all-time leading

receiver, Geoff DeLapp, and
moved down to the Indian 24.
Benny Barnes nailed Kemnitzer
for a seven yard loss on a
pitch-out, and on the next play,
Tim Robnett jumped over the
back of Bill Stowers to pick off
Cruze's pass to his tight end.
Robnett's spectacular play
provided the momentum for the
offense which took the ball on the
2 4 and moved upfield on the
running of Brown and Sanderson.
The big play of the drive came on
a 27 yard pass to Brown over the
middle on the same play he scored
on earlier. With a first and 10 on
the 15 , the Indians moved the ball
in for the score in three plays,
with Sanderson picking up the six
points on a 1 yard plunge.
Once again, the crowd viewed
Garcia's extra point attempt with
apprehension, but the nation's
leading kicker came through again
to the wild cheers of the Stadium
fans.
A penalty and an out of bounds
kick resulted in Garcia finally
kicking off from his own 30 yard
line. Cal had good field position
on its own 35, but Cruze had
another pass intercepted by
Robnett on the first play. Cruze
threw a bomb which Robnett
took over his shoulder while
running alongside the Bear
receiver. Cal recovered a fumble
by Miles Moore after catching a
short pass, but could not
penetrate the Card defense after
taking the ball at mid-field and
punted.
After this, neither team could

move to within field goal range as
both defenses stiffened. Towards
the end of the fourth quarter, the
Stanford attack stayed mostly on
the ground in an attempt to run
out the clock, and the score
remained at 14-0.
The only drive in the fourth
quarter came after Don Alvarado
downed a Murray punt on the Cal
one yard line. The Bears moved
down to the Stanford 3 8 where
the drive stalled. Two runs by
Kehl ran out the clock and the
Indians went across the field to
get back the Axe.
Jackie Brown had one of his
finest days for Stanford, running
for 56 yards and catching 7 passes
for 119 yards to lead the team in
both categories for the afternoon.
He was voted offensive player of
the game for his efforts. Tim
Robnett was named defensive
player of the game for his two
interceptions, and the assistance
he gave the linebackers in
stopping (Jal's option.
'Gutty Performance'
Don Bunce passed for 211
yards and ran for another 24 in
what Ralston termed "a real gutty
performance." Playing with back
problems that kept him out of
workouts during the week, Bunce
broke his nose in the third quarter
but came back soon thereafter to
keep moving the team and ensure
Stanford's Big Game victory.
The Rose Bowl bound Indians
will now take about three weeks
off, with practices resuming either
on December 11th or 13 th.
Ralston expects to have all his
players healthy by then.

JACKIE'S DAY- Jackie Brown hangs onto a Don Bunce pass for dear
life as Bill Meyers looks on. For the first time this year, Brown was
used frequently as a pass receiver, a tactic which paid off well, as
Brown caught seven aerials for 119 yards to lead all receivers in the
' 4 ig Game. Brown would swing out of the backfield and streak down
t!>f middle, and this play resulted in a 58 yard touchdown and
another time went for 2 7 yards down to the California 15 to set up
the Indians' second touchdown.
After Stanford's methodical 14-0 victory over Cal
Saturday in the 7 4 th Big Game, Pete Lazetich and Greg
Sampson went over to the Bears' rooting section to regain
possession of the Axe that they and their teammates had so
clearly earned.
It was fitting thai the Thunder Chickens reclaimed the
Axe, because they played possibly the biggest part in a
magnificent defensive effort that held the Bears to 62 yards
total offense until the last two minutes of the game when
Cal quarterback Jay Cruze piloted a desperation 61 yard
drive that stalled on the Card 33 yard line.
Rose Bowl Wrapped Up
Stanford's convincing win ended all speculation about
the Bears' chances of going to the Rose Bowl through
favorable federal court and Pac-8 rulings. As a first step
towards a possible trip to Pasadena, Cal had to beat the
league leading Indians, and Coach John Ralston's players
decided the whole complicated issue on the football field
Saturday.
Although the Indians outgunned a good Bear team in
every phase of the game, prompting Ralston to praise his
men for playing their first "complete game," much of the
usual Big Game excitement was missing. For all its
importance, this year's battle was such a ho-hum affair that
even the band was restrained. Wells Twombly commented
in his Sunday column in the San Francisco Examiner that,
"Not only was it a dull game, the usually insulting Stanford
band put on one of its greyest halftime shows in years, a
salute to brush fire wars or something."
The excitement on the Card sideline never waned,
however, as the squad relentlessly pursued a strong

Berkeley team that was in the (jame all the way except for
one big Stanford play.
The Indians had taken the ball on their own seven with
five minutes left in the half, and moved up to the Cal 4 2 on
the fine running of Jim Kehl and Vie Lamanuzzi and a 19
yard pass to Bill Scott. A holding penalty moved the ball
back into Stanford territory to the 4 2 where Don Bunce hit
Jackie Brown for about 10 yards over the middle after he
had swung out of the backfield. Brown took the ball in
while running at top speed and with a few fine moves plus a
devastating downfield block by Reggie Sanderson, Brown
streaked down the Cal sideline into the endzone to
complete the 58 yard play and give the Indians their first
score. The whole stadium watched nervously on the extra
point attempt, but Rod Garcia showed no signs of last
week's performance as he drilled the ball through the
uprights to give his squad a 7-0 lead.
Control And Confidence
It was a controlled and confident Stanford squad that
soundly defeated a California team that has beaten four
Pac-8 opponents this year in the closing seconds of the
game. Pete Lazetich explained the attitude of the victorious
Indians. "There was a lot of emotion on the field, but we
knew that we were going to win. We were really confident.
Confidence to me is the greatest emotion."
Jeff Siemon also attempted to verbalize the team's
feelings towards the Cal game. "We were ready. We were
not as enthusiastic as the SC game last year or the Rose
Bowl. But we knew that we had to play well today. It is
hard to get super excited unless you are the underdog."
The Indians felt that they had to win the Big Came in
order to command any respect and generate any spirit for
the Rose Bowl. Bunce exemplified
this attitude, stating that, "We
had to win this one in order to go
to the Rose Bowl with any kind
of momentum at all. Last year
against Cal we lost because our
fundamentals broke down. This
year we played a complete game."
Ralston felt that the offense
and defense achieved the best
balance of any game played this
year, although defense dominated
the first quarter of the contest
played before a Stanford stadium
crowd of 86,000. Cal took the
opening kickoff and made one
first down on a Stanford penalty
and had to give up the ball. On
the Indians' second play from
scrimmage at their 20 yard line,
John Winesberry dropped a pitch
back on a reverse. Winesberry
recovered his own fumble, but he
had the whole field open ahead of
him if he had held onto the ball.
Ralston felt that Winesberry
would have "gone all the way."
Winesberry came right back,
however, catching an 11 yard pass
for an apparent first down. The
officials spotted the ball just short
of the first, and Stanford was
forced to punt. Each team had
possession of the ball twice more
in the first quarter, but could not
generate a significant drive. Steve
Murray's booming punts kept the
Bears from getting good field
position, and the Thunder
Chickens took care of the rest.
Under Jay Cruze's leadership,
Cal tried to establish a running
game with Isaac Curtis and Steve
Kemnitzer. These efforts were
unsuccessful as the Indians
defense was even able to stop the
option play that has pestered
them during the last half of the
season. After the game, Mike
Simone said that, "They thought
that they could run against us, but
I don't think that anyone can run
against us all day."
Stanford was also trying to
establish a running game in the

first quarter, but could not do
