# Financial Aid Cutbacks Force Graduate Enrollment Decrease
## 
### CHRIS WILHELM 
Reductions of government aid and
the ending of a Ford Foundation grant
have resulted in a recent decrease in
graduate enrollment here in the last
two years.
At the same time, the national level
has remained the same. Lincoln Moses,
Dean of Graduate Studies, explained,
"There's been a tendency for
government programs to be associated
with superior academic enterprises, so
leading institutions get hit hardest by a
cutback." The government has
withdrawn one graduate aid program
after another, he said.
The Ford Foundation recently
ended a four-year 40-million dollar aid
program to ten schools, including
programs designed specifically to aid
graduate education. The Ford
Foundation had supported four
consecutive classes of Ph.D. students
from 1967 to 1970, guaranteeing each
student four years of financial support.
The Foundation had hoped that
when it ended the program the federal
government would step in and take it
over. Instead, the government began to
cut back. According to Moses, "The
program proved controversial because a
lot of people didn't agree that a student
should be guaranteed four years of
support."
Masters' Not Essential
Because it was felt that aid was not
as essential for those seeking masters
degrees as for those desiring doctorates,
the program ignored masters degrees
programs. Moses said, "You want to
use a limited resource at its highest
level of performance."
In many Stanford departments,
masters degrees are offered only on the
way to a Ph.D. degree.
Moses feels there are several reasons
for the drop in support for graduate
education in the last several years:

—Only in the last three or four years
was it recognized that more Ph.D's
were being produced than society had
places for. Before that time, it was
assumed that more were needed.
--Higher education has been a
"hero" in this country for a longtime.
Recently, it has been losing this "hero"
status.
— The particular
political-philosophical tendencies of the
present national administration have
not been favorable for higher
education. But Moses added, "It would
be an uphill struggle to get anything
out of Congress."
—In addition, the increases in overall
costs in running a university have not
been matched by increases in university
money from investments, gifts, tuition,
and rents.
BAP
Stanford responded to these events
by instituting what it has called the
Budget Adjustment Program (BAP) to
cut six million dollars out of its budget
beginning last year.
Moses suggested that in graduate
schools, limits be placed on the number
of graduate students in the departments
affected by the cutbacks. Psychology
Professor Douglas Lawrence said that
these limits are sometimes difficult to
adhere to, especially because the
acceptance rates to graduate schools
have been increasing lately as students

now tend to receive fewer offers from
schools.
In the Psychology Department, the
yearly admission quota had been about
25. This has recently been readjusted
downward to 20. Anthropology has cut
back from an average of 15 new
students each year to 12.

In many Stanford departments,
masters degrees are offered only on the
way to a Ph.D. degree.
Moses feels there are several reasons
for the drop in support for graduate
education in the last several years:

—Only in the last three or four years
was it recognized that more Ph.D's
were being produced than society had
places for. Before that time, it was
assumed that more were needed.
--Higher education has been a
"hero" in this country for a longtime.
Recently, it has been losing this "hero"
status.
— The particular
political-philosophical tendencies of the
present national administration have
not been favorable for higher
education. But Moses added, "It would
be an uphill struggle to get anything
out of Congress."
—In addition, the increases in overall
costs in running a university have not
been matched by increases in university
money from investments, gifts, tuition,
and rents.
BAP
Stanford responded to these events
by instituting what it has called the
Budget Adjustment Program (BAP) to
cut six million dollars out of its budget
beginning last year.
Moses suggested that in graduate
schools, limits be placed on the number
of graduate students in the departments
affected by the cutbacks. Psychology
Professor Douglas Lawrence said that
these limits are sometimes difficult to
adhere to, especially because the
acceptance rates to graduate schools
have been increasing lately as students

now tend to receive fewer offers from
schools.
In the Psychology Department, the
yearly admission quota had been about
25. This has recently been readjusted
downward to 20. Anthropology has cut
back from an average of 15 new
students each year to 12.
Reductions of government aid and
the ending of a Ford Foundation grant
have resulted in a recent decrease in
graduate enrollment here in the last
two years.
At the same time, the national level
has remained the same. Lincoln Moses,
Dean of Graduate Studies, explained,
"There's been a tendency for
government programs to be associated
with superior academic enterprises, so
leading institutions get hit hardest by a
cutback." The government has
withdrawn one graduate aid program
after another, he said.
The Ford Foundation recently
ended a four-year 40-million dollar aid
program to ten schools, including
programs designed specifically to aid
graduate education. The Ford
Foundation had supported four
consecutive classes of Ph.D. students
from 1967 to 1970, guaranteeing each
student four years of financial support.
The Foundation had hoped that
when it ended the program the federal
government would step in and take it
over. Instead, the government began to
cut back. According to Moses, "The
program proved controversial because a
lot of people didn't agree that a student
should be guaranteed four years of
support."
Masters' Not Essential
Because it was felt that aid was not
as essential for those seeking masters
degrees as for those desiring doctorates,
the program ignored masters degrees
programs. Moses said, "You want to
use a limited resource at its highest
level of performance."
