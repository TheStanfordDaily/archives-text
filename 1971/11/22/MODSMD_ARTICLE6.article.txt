# Ravenswood Innovations Hasten Desegregation
## 
### GARY ATKINS First of two parts 
Widespread integration finally came to some of
Stanford's high school neighbors this year—not by
busing, but by students freely choosing the school
they wanted to attend.
And for now the attempt to make voluntary
desegregation work seems to be succeeding, in spite
of the fact that it has failed in many communities.
The six high schools involved, all in the Sequoia
Union district lying to the north of Stanford, actually
had little choice but to integrate with volunteers.
Faced on the one hand with a Federal
desegregation order and on the other with adamant
community opposition to busing, school officials
opted for the alternative of voluntary desegregation.
For two years voluntary desegregation had failed
to work in the district, but officials decided to try it
again—this time with a few new elements.
Innovative School
The key to the success of the plan rests on an
attempt to turn the formerly all-black
school—Ravenswood High in East Palo Alto—into
what school officials call an "innovative school of
excellence."
"First though, we had to figure out how to create a
school of excellence there," the coordinator of the
desegregation program. Merle Fruehling, said.
•Just three years ago, the school was investigated
and strongly criticized by the California Teachers'

Association (CTA). The CTA recommended that
Ravenswood actually be shut down for a year—"they
said very little in the way of education was going on
there," according to Fruehling.
Out of the Hills
The major problem in integrating was to encourage
enough whites to come down out of the hills to
attend Ravenswood.
The Sequoia district encompasses some 12,0 00
high school students living in essentially two areas.
Black and chicano communities predominate in the
Hat, bavshore sections like East Palo Alto, while
Menlo Park-Atherton and Redwood City are mixed
ethnically. The foothills, reaching in a crescent from
Stanford north through Woodside, San Carlos and
Belmont are white communities.
Expectedly, there is a marked contrast between the
white "hill" schools—Woodside, San Carlos.
Carlmont— and Ravenswood. located just off the
Bavshore Freeway in the low-lying areas.
Students Allowed to Choose
Until recently, none of the schools, for all practical
purposes, was integrated.
Not until 1 968 were students allowed to choose
their schools. At that point, and during the following
year, 100 blacks transferred out of Ravenswood; only
1 8 whites transferred in.
By last year, Ravenswood was essentially half a
school, operating 40 percent below capacity.
Obviously, if the school was going to exist, something

had to be done.
In essence, Fruehling says, the district killed the
old Ravenswood and started an entirely new school in
its place.
In the process, it solved two problems—that of a
dying school and that of integration. The new
Ravenswood was specifically designed to draw whites
out of the hills.
"We decided we would try to have the best
teachers in the district move to Ravenswood,"
Fruehling says. "Many of these same people had been
trying to get changes in the traditional classroom
program where they were, but they hadn't been
allowed to do it. Essentially, we told them if they
would transfer to Ravenswood, they could put
together the program they wanted."
That promise lured not only volunteer teachers,
but enough white students to greatly alter
Ravenswood's racial mix—some 95 percent of
Ravenswood's students were black or chicano last
year; only 54 percent are this year.
Meanwhile, the also created new jourses
and services for blacks and chicanos at tne white
r-'hools to encourage Ravenswood students to
transfer there.
All together this year, some 150 blacks traasferred
out of Ra* nswood and over 500 whites transferred
in.

NEW SCHOOL HEAD—Clarence Cryer is in his first year as principal of

transfers. The school offered an innovative curriculum to attract students.
Although the program appears successful so far, Cryer feels more time is needed
to really tell.
when the white man came," Ravenswood's new
principal, Clarence Crver, says.
In spite of the apparent success in luring whites
though, the question of whether voluntary
desegregation can produce long-lasting integration is
still in the air.
Both black and white political issues have confused
the issues. " X
On the one hand, some black leaders in East Palo v \
Alto desire a community controlled school at
Ravenswood. Last year they demanded that
Ravenswood remain at least 5 0 percent black and
chicano.
On the other hand, voters in the district are
adamantly opposed to anything resembling forced
busing.
Thus, when the district school board last year
attempted to bus a few more whites into
Ravenswood, and a few more blacks out, voters

promptly defeated two members and elected a board
strongly opposed to forced integration.
Integration in the district now depends upon the
success of the volunteer program. That in turn
depends not only upon the reception blacks get at the
formerly all-white schools, but, perhaps most
importantly this year, the success of the new
Ravenswood.
The school's innovations, according to Cryer, aim
mainly at replacing the rigid "college prep" program
with more flexible schedules and more variety in
Classes.
for example, the school uses flexible modular
scheduling which replaces old one-hour classes with
classes that can run anywhere from 30 minutes up.
Additionally, the school runs in cycles—l 6 days are
spent in class and the 17 th day is spent evaluating
problems and or just simply taking a break.
Students who are organized in "houses" of about 100
each may go anywhere from a beach to a museum.

Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the school
is organized on the idea of offering choices to
students who dislike traditional high school courses.
"Rather than having a student take English I or 11,
for example, he might take a course in filmmaking, or
Hughes' poetry, or folk rock," Oyer says.
"It's a lot more interesting this year," said Craig
Taylor, a senior. Taylor has studied at Ravenswood
for the past three years. "There are a lot of good
teachers here this year—just as there were last year.
But I think students are listening a lot more this
year."
"We think we have a tremendous thing going
here," Cryer says. But, as he very quickly adds, there
are problems, or at least potential problems. And like
other school officials, he's waiting for a while before
he claims success for Ravenswood or for voluntary
desegregation.

desegregation work.)
