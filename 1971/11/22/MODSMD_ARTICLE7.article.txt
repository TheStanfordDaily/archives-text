Thanks For The Bonfire
Editor, THE DAILY:
In a time when sentimentality is old fashioned,
when festivity is trite and celebration silly, and
when the problem of atmospheric pollution is a very
real issue, I nevertheless call upon the Stanford
community to see the Big Game bonfire in a
different light.
Sir James Frazer describes the Saturnalia festival
of the ancient Romans as a "period of license when
the customary restraints of law and morality are
thrown aside (for) extravagant mirth and jollity."
Similar festivals, he notes, "commonly occur at the
end of the year, frequently associated with one or
another of the agricultural seasons, especially the
time of sowing and harvest."
The obvious phallic appearance of the flame
itself would appease the god of fertility, Priapus;
but with Hoover Tower around all year long such
symbolism alone is hardly a special occasion.
It is significant, though, that youths kindle the
fire by running from the edge of the lake to the
center with their Olympic torches. How fascinating
that the builders and guardians of the pyre are the
youngest males; their task is similar to that of the
Vestal Virgins in ancient Rome!
The setting this season is an obvious attempt by
the pagan originators of the ceremony to provide
for the refilling of the barren lakebed, the blooming
of surrounding vegetation, and the "harvesting" of
frosh dollies by anxious upperclassmen during the
upcoming weekend.
That's why the lack of enthusiasm for the fire
worries me: this could have resulted in a deservedly
frustrating weekend for those who did not pay due
respect to the gods.

Certainly Stanford students should not be denied
the few pleasures available to them during this
fertile festival. But the increasing numbers of
apathetic and pragmatic "have better things to do
with (their) time." Oh, why can't we give ourselves
up to the gods of mirth once in a while?
To those of you who did help build the bonfire
and who did participate in its ceremony, I thank
you for helping keep alive a great classical tradition.

Morals Police
Editor, THE DAILY:
I was alarmed to leam from History Professor
Hal Kahn that "Stanford remains open—not unlike a
whore—to the imperialists in Washington for their
use." (Daily, 19 November 1971.)
I share his moral indignation, and am glad that
he, Kwonping Ho, and Katherine Barkley are
working to stop the University's scandalous
openness or opening. Would it be possible to
constitute a committee, perhaps to be chaired by
Kahn, that would decide on the morality of the
University's intercourse with the outside world?
License has clearly gone too far; the matter is
delicate: a form of morals police is clearly what we
need, and what some of us want.
