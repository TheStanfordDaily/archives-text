# free from coercion
## Pacifism & Libertarianism 
### 
David fowler

In politics and all social
interaction there is one principle
fundamental to Libertarianism:
freedom from coercion. The only
moral relationships (and, in the
long run, the only prctical ones)
are completely voluntary—i.e.,
free from physical force. In a
civilized society—by definition of
"civilization"—the initiation of
physical force is banned. Strictly,
this is not a pure Pacifist
principle, since the right remains
to employ force ONLY in
self-defense against those who
initiate it, who attempt to
physically coerce you into
obeying their commands. And, in
practical terms, this often
thankless duty of defending our
rights is contracted (delegated)
out—to the police or, if necessary,
the armed forces. They are
supposed to guard you, however
sometimes it is THEIR sins of
omission or commission one must
guard against.
Which brings the subject to the
single most blatantly coercive
gang of men operating openly in
the U.S. (and every other nation)
today. By threatening force to
punish disobedience they: (1)
extort billions of dollars every
year to support their
activities—many of which would
fold if men were free to
voluntarily support only those
they found worthwile; (2) capture
and enslave thousands of men a
year, shipping them whereever the
ruler-gang find the work so dirty
or so meaningless that no
self-respecting man would
voluntarily take the job; (.'})
enforce rationally unjustifiable
standards of social behavior on
their subjects, forbidding a variety
of completely voluntary
economic, social, or sexual acts
between people.
This is not the Mafia—nor is it
(yet) any heinous conspiracy of a
power-drunk ruling class. All the
above crimes are perpetrated in
the name of Morality, and in the
name of each one of us. For the
most dangerous violator of peace
and freedom in the world—far
outweighing run-of-the-mill thugs
and barbarians—is runaway

Government. Not only this
nation's (perhaps we ARE still the
most free, and peaceful, large
nation), but all Governments. The
stronger, more totalitarian,more
dictatorial they are (Mao fans take
note), the more dangerous they
become-to their enemies, their
neighbors, and to their own
citizens.
For 3000 years the concept
Government has been used as a
veil, to cloak the coercive rule
some men impose on their
neighbors, with the finery - of
Mystic Powers (Pharaohs and
Emperors), Divine Right (Kings),
Demagogic Charisma (Lenin,
Hitler, Mao), and established
Authority (a plethora of present
day politicians). By what right?
A Libertarian can find none,
neither granted by God nor the
majority vote of his fellow slaves.
If no man has the Right to
Coerce, no group of men can
endow it to government officials.
Only the mystique of Rule, a
vestige of belief in Divine Right,
permits government officials to
trample over us in the name of
Public Good or National Goals.
Libertarian ideals renounce the
use of criminal force, the kind
thugs and thieves employ to
achieve their goals by sacrificing

their victims. On this point there
is universal agreement from all
shades of the political spectrum.
It is nothing new.
But Libertarian philosophy
adds one more consistent step:
the proclamation that
Government is not mystically
endowed with the Right to coerce
its citizens—that government
officials are hired to provide a
service (basically: protection from
criminal coercion, and institution
of an objective judiciary to settle
disputes), NOT to enslave some
citizens in order to serve real or
imagined needs of some others or
to save the world from real or
imagined Evils. The government
that initiates force against one of
its citizens negates its reason for
existence.
If ALL our actions are,
someday, freed from coercion it
will be a victory of Libertarian
philosophy. It will also be the
only time when a committed
Pacifist can safely live by his
principles, shielded from those
too blind or evil to recognize that
aggression is the lowest level of
perversion possible to Man.
