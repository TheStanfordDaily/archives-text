## Peace-Making President?

"I will not place any limits on the use of air
power."—Pres. Nixon, February, 1971
Twelve year old Quang retained a
remarkably stoic composure as he related the
story of his family. Two months before, Quang
and his grandfather were in the rice fields to
Graph 1.

"dap nuoc" (pedal a bamboo water wheel to
irrigate the paddy fields) when they heard
bombers overhead. They dived into the fields
for cover.
It was not the first time they had
experienced terror as planes swooped low and
disgorged their earth-trembling
explosives—but this time the bombs seemed
even closer than before. When the silver
air-borne cowards had unloaded their
destruction and fled, Quang and his
grandfather picked themselves up out of the
field—again lucky enough to emerge
unharmed. They ran toward the family
homestead, a thatch hut surrounded by
coconut palms. Their worst fears had become
reality. A direct hit had destroyed the house
and left Quang's little brother seriously
wounded, his older sister and mother dead.
President Nixon has expended considerable
effort to make the American war in Indochina
go away—at least in the minds of the American
people. The strategy of Vietnamization was
intended to lower American casualties and
relegate news of Indochina to page 14 in
domestic newspapers. It has become
fashionable for policy-makers now to speak of
"winding down the war" and "post-war
reconstruction."
But the sad reality for the people of
Indochina is that stories similar to Quang's are
still being repeated every day. In cynical
disregard for the lives of Vietnamese,
Cambodians, and Laotians, "peace-maker"
Nixon has pursued a course of unlimited
bombing, which means unlimited Indochinese
casualties, while claiming that he is ending the
war.
The statistics of bombing levels in
Indochina under the Nixon administration
compared with those of the Johnson
administration dispel any illusions that
President Nixon is acting as a peace-maker.
According to Cornell University's Air War
Study, sometime between Nov. 1, 1971 and
March 1, 1972, the point will be reached
where the majority of bombs dropped in
Indochina will have been dropped under the
Nixon administration. The study further
reports that more bombs have been dropped

on Indochina since President Nixon took
office than the total (2.9 million tons)
dropped during World War II and the Korean
War combined. (See chart 1)
Furthermore, much of this bombing is
carried out in the most cynically technological
manner imaginable. The military boasts
without sham of systems which allow a pilot
to set coordinates in aircraft computers,
monitor computer data from a distant ground
station, and, at an electronic signal,
automatically releast death onto Indochina.
The intense bombing sponsored by the
Nixon administration has resulted in a
devastating toll in civilian casualties for Quang
and his Indochinese brothers. An April, 1971,
report of the Kennedy Subcommittee on
Refugees stated, "In this year, 1971, more
civilians are being killed and wounded in the
three countries of Indochina, and more made
refugees, than at any time in history. Most of
the casualties and the refugees are caused by
American and Allied military activity."
The number of civilians killed, wounded,
and refugeed under Johnson (1964-1968) is
estimated at 5,655,300, while in the less than
three years of the Nixon administration
(1969-Aug., 1971) the estimate is 4,100,000.
This means that the monthly civilian toll under
Nixon has been considerably higher than under
Johnson. (See chart 2)

The racist nature of Nixon's war policy,
which condones massive Indochinese casualties
as long as American casualties are low enough
to be politically acceptable, is scarcely
disguised by Nixon's rhetoric of peace. As long
as the Nixon administration refuses to respond

administration dispel any illusions that
President Nixon is acting as a peace-maker.
According to Cornell University's Air War
Study, sometime between Nov. 1, 1971 and
March 1, 1972, the point will be reached
where the majority of bombs dropped in
Indochina will have been dropped under the
Nixon administration. The study further
reports that more bombs have been dropped

on Indochina since President Nixon took
office than the total (2.9 million tons)
dropped during World War II and the Korean
War combined. (See chart 1)
Furthermore, much of this bombing is
carried out in the most cynically technological
manner imaginable. The military boasts
without sham of systems which allow a pilot
to set coordinates in aircraft computers,
monitor computer data from a distant ground
station, and, at an electronic signal,
automatically releast death onto Indochina.
The intense bombing sponsored by the
Nixon administration has resulted in a
devastating toll in civilian casualties for Quang
and his Indochinese brothers. An April, 1971,
report of the Kennedy Subcommittee on
Refugees stated, "In this year, 1971, more
civilians are being killed and wounded in the
three countries of Indochina, and more made
refugees, than at any time in history. Most of
the casualties and the refugees are caused by
American and Allied military activity."
The number of civilians killed, wounded,
and refugeed under Johnson (1964-1968) is
estimated at 5,655,300, while in the less than
three years of the Nixon administration
(1969-Aug., 1971) the estimate is 4,100,000.
This means that the monthly civilian toll under
Nixon has been considerably higher than under
Johnson. (See chart 2)

The racist nature of Nixon's war policy,
which condones massive Indochinese casualties
as long as American casualties are low enough
to be politically acceptable, is scarcely
disguised by Nixon's rhetoric of peace. As long
as the Nixon administration refuses to respond

Winding Down The War

"I will not place any limits on the use of air
power."—Pres. Nixon, February, 1971
Twelve year old Quang retained a
remarkably stoic composure as he related the
story of his family. Two months before, Quang
and his grandfather were in the rice fields to
Graph 1.

"dap nuoc" (pedal a bamboo water wheel to
irrigate the paddy fields) when they heard
bombers overhead. They dived into the fields
for cover.
It was not the first time they had
experienced terror as planes swooped low and
disgorged their earth-trembling
explosives—but this time the bombs seemed
even closer than before. When the silver
air-borne cowards had unloaded their
destruction and fled, Quang and his
grandfather picked themselves up out of the
field—again lucky enough to emerge
unharmed. They ran toward the family
homestead, a thatch hut surrounded by
coconut palms. Their worst fears had become
reality. A direct hit had destroyed the house
and left Quang's little brother seriously
wounded, his older sister and mother dead.
President Nixon has expended considerable
effort to make the American war in Indochina
go away—at least in the minds of the American
people. The strategy of Vietnamization was
intended to lower American casualties and
relegate news of Indochina to page 14 in
domestic newspapers. It has become
fashionable for policy-makers now to speak of
"winding down the war" and "post-war
reconstruction."
But the sad reality for the people of
Indochina is that stories similar to Quang's are
still being repeated every day. In cynical
disregard for the lives of Vietnamese,
Cambodians, and Laotians, "peace-maker"
Nixon has pursued a course of unlimited
bombing, which means unlimited Indochinese
casualties, while claiming that he is ending the
war.
The statistics of bombing levels in
Indochina under the Nixon administration
compared with those of the Johnson
administration dispel any illusions that
