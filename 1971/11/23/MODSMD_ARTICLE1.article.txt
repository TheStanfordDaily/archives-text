# Grievance Panel Unanimously Recommends Dolly Rehiring
## 
### FRANK MILLER 
The three-man grievance board
hearing the case of fired hospital
worker John Dolly unanimously
recommended yesterday that Dolly be
immediately rehired, and suspended
any more hearings in the case.
Grievance Board Chairman Doug
DuPenn said last night that "we will be
recommending the reinstatement of
John Dolly and have suspended future
hearings on the basis of evidence
presented." He said that he hoped to
formally present the board's
recommendations to President Lyman
within the next few days.
He said the board had not discussed
their reasons for recommending the
reinstatement and had only taken the
vote late yesterday afternoon after a
closed hearing. The board still must
consider the issue of Dolly's back pay
in the four and one-half months he has

been fired, the entire background to
the report, and the basis for the
reinstatement.
The Administration had presented its
case to the board by brief and Dolly
was half-way through his defense
through the first five hearings when the
Board made its decision yesterday.
President Lyman can overrule the
recommendations of the board,
although this is considered by many
unlikely.
Dolly was fired along with four other
University workers last June for his
alleged participation in the April 9
sit-in at the Medical Center and the
violence that followed.
Before a written statement is
released by himself and the grievance
board, Dolly would say only that the
decision to recommend that he be
reinstated is "a victory for the working
people and the movement."
The University originally fired Dolly
for "unacceptable behavior by an
employee," according to former
Director of Personnel Robert Nelson.
Dolly's defense maintained that the
demands at the time of the sit-in were
reasonable attempts to redress
long-standing grievances and that no
alternative channels were given to
provide redress.
In testimony last week he also

argued that he did not willingly remain
in the occupied administrative offices
before police cleared the area. He said
that he was concerned about the safety
of his wife, who was two months
pregnant at the time, and went to the
sit-in to tell her he would be working
late. By the time they decided to leave,
the exits had been barricaded by the
demonstrators and there was no way
out, he claimed.
At the same time, however, he
emphasized that, "If Jeanie (his wife)
wasn't pregnant and I had known the
police were coming, I probably would
have stayed" in the Medical Center.
His hearings have been frought with
bickering and problems since they
began. The actual hearing did not begin
until November 4, four and one-half
months after he was fired.
Dolly had urged originally that his
grievance hearings be delayed until
after his case in state court on criminal
charges arising from the sit-in was
decided. He protested that making his
case public before his appearance in
court would hamper his ability to
present an adequate defense.
The committee agreed and
recommended during the summer that
Dolly be reinstated until his hearings
were able to begin. Acting President
William Miller would not accept the
recommendation.
