# Off-Campus Interns Learn By Field Work
## 
### 
Twenty-two Stanford students have enrolled for academic credit in
five off-campus internship public service projects.
The internships, under the auspices of the University's Program on
Urban Studies, range from two to three quarters in length.
They include helping train underskilled or "unemployable" people
with the Menlo Park office of the Opportunities Industrialization
Center West (0ICW), working with officials in local city governments,
assiting attorneys at the Legal Aid Society of San Mateo County,
working with the Stanford Mid-Peninsula Urban Coalition, and serving
as teachers' aides in the bi lingual programs of Alviso and Union City.
Program director is Henry van der Voort, senior in psychology,
who works under the sponsorship of the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies, James Gibbs.
In van der Voort's words, "the internship program has two
purposes: one, to provide the student with sufficient practical
experience to both guide and evaluate his studies; and two, to provide
a service requested by the community."
The internships are open by interview to juniors, seniors and
graduates, who must make a weekly commitment of 10 to 15 hours of
service during at least two quarters.
