# 'II Tabarro,' 'Carmina Burana'
## Two Wonderfully Complementary Works 
### GARY SCHMIDGALL 
A song of innocence and a song of experience, this sums up the
impact of two wonderfully complementary works now in the S.F.
Opera repertory. The goal of innocence is pleasure, sensualism and
orgasm, and these are celebrated as never before in Carl Orff's
propulsive "Carmina Burana" (1936).
And if the end of experience is oppression and death, then
Puccini's taut little shocker "II tabarro" (The Cloak — 1916) is the
perfect represenative of this darker side of life.
Artistically, the powers of darkness seemed better served on this
occasion. "Tabarro's" crux, vital versus moribund passion, seemed
more powerfully conveyed and its cast and conductor more congenial
to the music. "Carmina," though impressively rendered, lacked the
ultimate charismatic thrust of a perfect performance.
"Opera," however, poorly describes both pieces. "Tabarro" is
really an emotional tone-poem, Puccini's finest mood-setting. It is full
of acute orchestration which paints a picture of the

Lumpenproletariat who run the barges on the Seine worthy of Zola.
The plot is simple: Giorgetta, married to a barge-master twice her age,
falls in love with a young stevedore. When the old man realizes this, he
strangles his rival.
Black Hoplessness
Puccini called "Tabarro" his "black" piece and such it certainly is.
The dark, impersonal, ceaseless Seine figures prominently in the
music, and in this production a bridge across the river broods
crushingly over the action. The mood is one of black hopelessness of
an oppressed class, a terrible kind of ennui. Emotion surfaces just
enough to show that, somewhere in the darkness, blood is seething.
All the singers rose in the high level of dramatic intensity which the
very condensed score demands. Leontyne Price is here performing the
role of Giorgetta for the first time, though she has already recorded it
(If this sounds like the cart before the horse, you are right).
Price clearly finds this mid-range role grateful to her voice, and she
is well into its vocal drama. She knows how to let the rough edges of
passion show through a vocal line. Visually, however, Price's tendency
to walk through a role is increasing. Her hands seem to have a mind of
their own.
Stunning Debut
As the aging husband, Gabriel Bacquier made a stunning if rather
odd S.F. debut. Stunning fn the power and inner engagement of his
dark-timbred baritone and the intelligence of his acting; odd in that
this is such a small role for a man famous for his Don Giovanni, lago,
and Scarpia. We should be thankful for such extravagant casting and
hope for Bacquier's return.
Aldo Bottion looked perfect as the virile young stevedore and sang
with perhaps more intensity than finesse. Newcomer Betty Allen
made a fine impression with her rounded and solidly produced mezzo.
She, also, was given a role too small for her abilities.
Conductor Sanzogno was in his element. He kept the sombre mood
appropriately dominant, while giving tl 1 passionate outbursts and
inbursts their due. Paolo Bregni's new set is simply superb.
Delightfully Vigorous
If the dominant color of "Tabarro" is black and its accessory
shades of grey, "Carmina Burana" is an exhilirating spate of reds, pure
whites, rich purples — a feast for the senses. And this is the Opera's
approach to the work, which is essentially a plotless setting of various

poems (in Latin and medieval German) written by the wandering
scholars of the 12th century. Jacob Burckhardt thought these poems
the greatest of this period, and indeed they are delightfully vigorous,
uninhibited, witty and often moving poems by and about those who
loved living.
Rhythm is life; it is the vital force of music. And rhythmic power
and inventiveness are the overwhelming features of Orff's style
("Carmina" requires five percussionists!). "Carmina" stands beside
Stavinsky's "Rite of Spring" in this respect. The music is a perfect
instance of the medium as the message. It is an evocation of the life
forces, of ribaldry, of blasphemy toward social conventions, of
sex-passion. There is not a bar of that musty, pedantic invention of
the Age of Reason, counterpoint.
What makes "Carmina" unique, however, is its fidelity to the
medieval world-view and musical idioms. The piece is parenthesized
by the great chorus Fortuna imperatrix mundi, the wheel of fortune
which begins and ends all. Within this framework the three sections
(Springtime, The Tavern, the Court of Love) unfold their typically
medieval subject-matter. Both Orff and this production capture the
essential medievalism of the poetry.
Spectacular Effect
Huge chorus, large corps de ballet, brilliant costumes and an
eye-filling set give S.F.'s "Carmina" a spectacular effect.
Except for roughness in the soprano section and a few jagged edges in
attack, the chorus sang well, though falling below their high standards
for this season. Raymond Wolansky hefted a rich and agile baritone
into his two thrilling numbers, and Shigemi Matsumoto, though shrill
in the higher reaches, was a pleasing Burgundian Lady. Tenor Bruce
Brewer, for what it is worth, is the Roasted Cygnet for our time.
Sanzogno found the change from Puccini to Orff a bit heady (what
conductor wouldn't!) and could not keep the orchestra on pinpoint
accuracy. A little more daring-do and charisma could happily have
been added.
Ghita Hager's direction was basically good, with a few instances of
preciousness (especially with the six boy-sopranos). The ballet was
unpretentiously conceived and performed by dancers to match.
(This double bill will be repeated tonight and Friday at 8 p.m. at the
Opera House in San Francisco. Standing room only will be available at
$3.)

this is such a small role for a man famous for his Don Giovanni, lago,
and Scarpia. We should be thankful for such extravagant casting and
hope for Bacquier's return.
Aldo Bottion looked perfect as the virile young stevedore and sang
with perhaps more intensity than finesse. Newcomer Betty Allen
made a fine impression with her rounded and solidly produced mezzo.
She, also, was given a role too small for her abilities.
Conductor Sanzogno was in his element. He kept the sombre mood
appropriately dominant, while giving tl 1 passionate outbursts and
inbursts their due. Paolo Bregni's new set is simply superb.
Delightfully Vigorous
If the dominant color of "Tabarro" is black and its accessory
shades of grey, "Carmina Burana" is an exhilirating spate of reds, pure
whites, rich purples — a feast for the senses. And this is the Opera's
approach to the work, which is essentially a plotless setting of various

poems (in Latin and medieval German) written by the wandering
scholars of the 12th century. Jacob Burckhardt thought these poems
the greatest of this period, and indeed they are delightfully vigorous,
uninhibited, witty and often moving poems by and about those who
loved living.
Rhythm is life; it is the vital force of music. And rhythmic power
and inventiveness are the overwhelming features of Orff's style
("Carmina" requires five percussionists!). "Carmina" stands beside
Stavinsky's "Rite of Spring" in this respect. The music is a perfect
instance of the medium as the message. It is an evocation of the life
forces, of ribaldry, of blasphemy toward social conventions, of
sex-passion. There is not a bar of that musty, pedantic invention of
the Age of Reason, counterpoint.
What makes "Carmina" unique, however, is its fidelity to the
medieval world-view and musical idioms. The piece is parenthesized
by the great chorus Fortuna imperatrix mundi, the wheel of fortune
which begins and ends all. Within this framework the three sections
(Springtime, The Tavern, the Court of Love) unfold their typically
medieval subject-matter. Both Orff and this production capture the
essential medievalism of the poetry.
Spectacular Effect
Huge chorus, large corps de ballet, brilliant costumes and an
eye-filling set give S.F.'s "Carmina" a spectacular effect.
Except for roughness in the soprano section and a few jagged edges in
attack, the chorus sang well, though falling below their high standards
for this season. Raymond Wolansky hefted a rich and agile baritone
into his two thrilling numbers, and Shigemi Matsumoto, though shrill
in the higher reaches, was a pleasing Burgundian Lady. Tenor Bruce
Brewer, for what it is worth, is the Roasted Cygnet for our time.
Sanzogno found the change from Puccini to Orff a bit heady (what
conductor wouldn't!) and could not keep the orchestra on pinpoint
accuracy. A little more daring-do and charisma could happily have
been added.
Ghita Hager's direction was basically good, with a few instances of
preciousness (especially with the six boy-sopranos). The ballet was
unpretentiously conceived and performed by dancers to match.
(This double bill will be repeated tonight and Friday at 8 p.m. at the
Opera House in San Francisco. Standing room only will be available at

IL TABARRO—Leontyne Price is seen as Giorgetta in the San
Francisco Opera's production of II Tabarro. The double bill of II
Tabarro and Carmina Burana will be presented tonight and tomorrow
night in the final week of the opera season.
A song of innocence and a song of experience, this sums up the
impact of two wonderfully complementary works now in the S.F.
Opera repertory. The goal of innocence is pleasure, sensualism and
orgasm, and these are celebrated as never before in Carl Orff's
propulsive "Carmina Burana" (1936).
And if the end of experience is oppression and death, then
Puccini's taut little shocker "II tabarro" (The Cloak — 1916) is the
perfect represenative of this darker side of life.
Artistically, the powers of darkness seemed better served on this
occasion. "Tabarro's" crux, vital versus moribund passion, seemed
more powerfully conveyed and its cast and conductor more congenial
to the music. "Carmina," though impressively rendered, lacked the
ultimate charismatic thrust of a perfect performance.
"Opera," however, poorly describes both pieces. "Tabarro" is
really an emotional tone-poem, Puccini's finest mood-setting. It is full
of acute orchestration which paints a picture of the

Lumpenproletariat who run the barges on the Seine worthy of Zola.
The plot is simple: Giorgetta, married to a barge-master twice her age,
falls in love with a young stevedore. When the old man realizes this, he
strangles his rival.
Black Hoplessness
Puccini called "Tabarro" his "black" piece and such it certainly is.
The dark, impersonal, ceaseless Seine figures prominently in the
music, and in this production a bridge across the river broods
crushingly over the action. The mood is one of black hopelessness of
an oppressed class, a terrible kind of ennui. Emotion surfaces just
enough to show that, somewhere in the darkness, blood is seething.
All the singers rose in the high level of dramatic intensity which the
very condensed score demands. Leontyne Price is here performing the
role of Giorgetta for the first time, though she has already recorded it
(If this sounds like the cart before the horse, you are right).
Price clearly finds this mid-range role grateful to her voice, and she
is well into its vocal drama. She knows how to let the rough edges of
passion show through a vocal line. Visually, however, Price's tendency
to walk through a role is increasing. Her hands seem to have a mind of
their own.

into his two thrilling numbers, and Shigemi Matsumoto, though shrill
in the higher reaches, was a pleasing Burgundian Lady. Tenor Bruce
Brewer, for what it is worth, is the Roasted Cygnet for our time.
Sanzogno found the change from Puccini to Orff a bit heady (what
conductor wouldn't!) and could not keep the orchestra on pinpoint
accuracy. A little more daring-do and charisma could happily have
been added.
Ghita Hager's direction was basically good, with a few instances of
preciousness (especially with the six boy-sopranos). The ballet was
unpretentiously conceived and performed by dancers to match.
(This double bill will be repeated tonight and Friday at 8 p.m. at the
Opera House in San Francisco. Standing room only will be available at

IL TABARRO—Leontyne Price is seen as Giorgetta in the San
Francisco Opera's production of II Tabarro. The double bill of II
Tabarro and Carmina Burana will be presented tonight and tomorrow
night in the final week of the opera season.
A song of innocence and a song of experience, this sums up the
impact of two wonderfully complementary works now in the S.F.
Opera repertory. The goal of innocence is pleasure, sensualism and
orgasm, and these are celebrated as never before in Carl Orff's
propulsive "Carmina Burana" (1936).
And if the end of experience is oppression and death, then
Puccini's taut little shocker "II tabarro" (The Cloak — 1916) is the
perfect represenative of this darker side of life.
Artistically, the powers of darkness seemed better served on this
occasion. "Tabarro's" crux, vital versus moribund passion, seemed
more powerfully conveyed and its cast and conductor more congenial
to the music. "Carmina," though impressively rendered, lacked the
ultimate charismatic thrust of a perfect performance.
"Opera," however, poorly describes both pieces. "Tabarro" is
really an emotional tone-poem, Puccini's finest mood-setting. It is full
of acute orchestration which paints a picture of the

Lumpenproletariat who run the barges on the Seine worthy of Zola.
The plot is simple: Giorgetta, married to a barge-master twice her age,
falls in love with a young stevedore. When the old man realizes this, he
strangles his rival.
Black Hoplessness
Puccini called "Tabarro" his "black" piece and such it certainly is.
The dark, impersonal, ceaseless Seine figures prominently in the
music, and in this production a bridge across the river broods
crushingly over the action. The mood is one of black hopelessness of
an oppressed class, a terrible kind of ennui. Emotion surfaces just
enough to show that, somewhere in the darkness, blood is seething.
All the singers rose in the high level of dramatic intensity which the
very condensed score demands. Leontyne Price is here performing the
role of Giorgetta for the first time, though she has already recorded it
(If this sounds like the cart before the horse, you are right).
Price clearly finds this mid-range role grateful to her voice, and she
is well into its vocal drama. She knows how to let the rough edges of
passion show through a vocal line. Visually, however, Price's tendency
to walk through a role is increasing. Her hands seem to have a mind of
their own.
Stunning Debut
As the aging husband, Gabriel Bacquier made a stunning if rather
odd S.F. debut. Stunning fn the power and inner engagement of his
dark-timbred baritone and the intelligence of his acting; odd in that
this is such a small role for a man famous for his Don Giovanni, lago,
and Scarpia. We should be thankful for such extravagant casting and
hope for Bacquier's return.
Aldo Bottion looked perfect as the virile young stevedore and sang
with perhaps more intensity than finesse. Newcomer Betty Allen
made a fine impression with her rounded and solidly produced mezzo.
She, also, was given a role too small for her abilities.
Conductor Sanzogno was in his element. He kept the sombre mood
appropriately dominant, while giving tl 1 passionate outbursts and
inbursts their due. Paolo Bregni's new set is simply superb.
Delightfully Vigorous
If the dominant color of "Tabarro" is black and its accessory
shades of grey, "Carmina Burana" is an exhilirating spate of reds, pure
whites, rich purples — a feast for the senses. And this is the Opera's
approach to the work, which is essentially a plotless setting of various

poems (in Latin and medieval German) written by the wandering
scholars of the 12th century. Jacob Burckhardt thought these poems
the greatest of this period, and indeed they are delightfully vigorous,
uninhibited, witty and often moving poems by and about those who
loved living.
Rhythm is life; it is the vital force of music. And rhythmic power
and inventiveness are the overwhelming features of Orff's style
("Carmina" requires five percussionists!). "Carmina" stands beside
Stavinsky's "Rite of Spring" in this respect. The music is a perfect
instance of the medium as the message. It is an evocation of the life
forces, of ribaldry, of blasphemy toward social conventions, of
sex-passion. There is not a bar of that musty, pedantic invention of
the Age of Reason, counterpoint.
What makes "Carmina" unique, however, is its fidelity to the
medieval world-view and musical idioms. The piece is parenthesized
by the great chorus Fortuna imperatrix mundi, the wheel of fortune
which begins and ends all. Within this framework the three sections
(Springtime, The Tavern, the Court of Love) unfold their typically
medieval subject-matter. Both Orff and this production capture the
essential medievalism of the poetry.
Spectacular Effect
Huge chorus, large corps de ballet, brilliant costumes and an
eye-filling set give S.F.'s "Carmina" a spectacular effect.
Except for roughness in the soprano section and a few jagged edges in
attack, the chorus sang well, though falling below their high standards
for this season. Raymond Wolansky hefted a rich and agile baritone
into his two thrilling numbers, and Shigemi Matsumoto, though shrill
in the higher reaches, was a pleasing Burgundian Lady. Tenor Bruce
Brewer, for what it is worth, is the Roasted Cygnet for our time.
