Israelis Prepared
TEL AVIV — Israeli troops were reported ready for
any eventuality along the Suez Canal front yesterday
following weekend war talk by President Anwar
Sadat of Egypt.
"We have been taking Sadat at his word for some
time and have taken the necessary precautions,"
military sources said.
They added, however, that there has been no
unusual activity by Egyptian forces dug in across the
waterway.
But, as one expert commented, Israeli troops "are
ready to fire at any time" and their present
deployment would not require any early warning
signs.
If there was increased preparedness throughout the
Israeli network of frontline bunkers there was no
excitement or concern visible in the civilian rear.
"We have heard Egyptian shouting before," one
Israeli worker said.
Some Israelis see Sadat's announcement of an
Egyptian "decision to fight" as a dangerous game of
brinkmanship designed to draw more international
and particularly American pressure on Israel to make
political concessions.
Pakistan Attacked
RAWALPINDI, Pakistan — Pakistani reports said
yesterday that India had launched a massive attack on
East Pakistan, sending 12 regular divisions and other
forces into battle in four sectors with air and armored
support.
Pakistan radio said India launched an "all-out

offensive" without declaration of war and added that
it had made "dents" in Pakistani defenses.
The radio account claimed 130 Indians were killed
and perhaps 500 wounded in fighting around Jessore
on the western border with Indian West Bengal.
Pakistani casualties were put at 7 killed and 4 0
wounded.
The report said the battle included tank units on
the ground and India's homemade Gnat jets and
Russian-supplied MIG fighters in the air.
At the United Nations in New York, Indian
Ambassador Samar Sen denied the reports of an
Indian attack. He said the fighting involved Pakistani
regulars and East Pakistan rebel forces.
A Pakistani spokesman at the United Nations said
he had been told by telephone from Islamabad,
Pakistan, that 12 regular Indian divisions supported
by 38 battalions of Indian border security forces had
assaulted Jessore, Chittagong, Sylhet and Rangpur.
Pakistan's U.N. delegation said it was considering
asking for an emergency meeting of the Security
Council to deal with the situation.
Sexism Court Ruling
WASHINGTON — In a landmark ruling the Supreme
Court yesterday unanimously barred arbitrary
discrimination against women by legislators
everywhere in the nation.
The startling decision, announced by Chief Justice
Warren E. Burger, was the first by the high court
cloaking women with the equal-protection clause of
the Constitution, the basis for earlier rulings
advancing the rights of Negroes.
Burger said legislatures may treat women

differently from men only when the purpose is
reasonable.
The decision came in a relatively obscure case from
Idaho in which the father and mother of a deceased
son had vied for the right to administer his estate of
less than $1,000. Under state law the father had been
named the administrator.
"We have conluded," Burger said, "that the
arbitrary preference established in favor of males
by .. . the Idaho code cannot stand in the face of the
14 th Amendment's command that no state deny the
equal protection of the laws to any person within its
jurisdiction."
War Toys Banned
SACRAMENTO — A ban on so-called "torture toys"
and toy bombs and grenades won final legislative
approval yesterday on a 45 -8 Assembly vote and was
sent to Gov. Reagan.
Assemblyman John Burton, the bill's author, said
it is the first of its kind passed anywhere in the
nation. It is scaled-down version of a blanket war toy
•ban which Burton has proposed unsuccessfully each
of the past five years.
Burton said he amended his bill (AB 1108) this
year to outlaw the manufacture or sale of toys he saw
advertised depicting "mad scientists torturing young
women in dungeons with racks, hot coals and
guillotines.
"How anyone could label these kinds of things as
toys is beyond me," Burton said.
He sid his bill would not affect toy sales for this
Christmas, but added tha he hopes it would influence
merchants not to stock such toys. If signed into law,
it would give merchants until next July 1 to rid their
stocks of the banned toys.

War Toys Banned
SACRAMENTO — A ban on so-called "torture toys"
and toy bombs and grenades won final legislative
approval yesterday on a 45 -8 Assembly vote and was
sent to Gov. Reagan.
Assemblyman John Burton, the bill's author, said
it is the first of its kind passed anywhere in the
nation. It is scaled-down version of a blanket war toy
•ban which Burton has proposed unsuccessfully each
of the past five years.
Burton said he amended his bill (AB 1108) this
year to outlaw the manufacture or sale of toys he saw
advertised depicting "mad scientists torturing young
women in dungeons with racks, hot coals and
guillotines.
"How anyone could label these kinds of things as
toys is beyond me," Burton said.
He sid his bill would not affect toy sales for this
Christmas, but added tha he hopes it would influence
merchants not to stock such toys. If signed into law,
it would give merchants until next July 1 to rid their
stocks of the banned toys.
Israelis Prepared
TEL AVIV — Israeli troops were reported ready for
any eventuality along the Suez Canal front yesterday
following weekend war talk by President Anwar
Sadat of Egypt.
"We have been taking Sadat at his word for some
time and have taken the necessary precautions,"
military sources said.
They added, however, that there has been no
unusual activity by Egyptian forces dug in across the
waterway.
But, as one expert commented, Israeli troops "are
ready to fire at any time" and their present
deployment would not require any early warning
signs.
If there was increased preparedness throughout the
Israeli network of frontline bunkers there was no
excitement or concern visible in the civilian rear.
"We have heard Egyptian shouting before," one
Israeli worker said.
Some Israelis see Sadat's announcement of an
Egyptian "decision to fight" as a dangerous game of
brinkmanship designed to draw more international
and particularly American pressure on Israel to make
political concessions.
Pakistan Attacked
RAWALPINDI, Pakistan — Pakistani reports said
yesterday that India had launched a massive attack on
East Pakistan, sending 12 regular divisions and other
forces into battle in four sectors with air and armored
support.
Pakistan radio said India launched an "all-out

offensive" without declaration of war and added that
it had made "dents" in Pakistani defenses.
The radio account claimed 130 Indians were killed
and perhaps 500 wounded in fighting around Jessore
on the western border with Indian West Bengal.
Pakistani casualties were put at 7 killed and 4 0
wounded.
The report said the battle included tank units on
the ground and India's homemade Gnat jets and
Russian-supplied MIG fighters in the air.
At the United Nations in New York, Indian
Ambassador Samar Sen denied the reports of an
Indian attack. He said the fighting involved Pakistani
regulars and East Pakistan rebel forces.
A Pakistani spokesman at the United Nations said
he had been told by telephone from Islamabad,
Pakistan, that 12 regular Indian divisions supported
by 38 battalions of Indian border security forces had
assaulted Jessore, Chittagong, Sylhet and Rangpur.
Pakistan's U.N. delegation said it was considering
asking for an emergency meeting of the Security
Council to deal with the situation.
Sexism Court Ruling
WASHINGTON — In a landmark ruling the Supreme
Court yesterday unanimously barred arbitrary
discrimination against women by legislators
everywhere in the nation.
The startling decision, announced by Chief Justice
Warren E. Burger, was the first by the high court
cloaking women with the equal-protection clause of
the Constitution, the basis for earlier rulings
advancing the rights of Negroes.
Burger said legislatures may treat women

differently from men only when the purpose is
reasonable.
The decision came in a relatively obscure case from
Idaho in which the father and mother of a deceased
son had vied for the right to administer his estate of
less than $1,000. Under state law the father had been
named the administrator.
"We have conluded," Burger said, "that the
arbitrary preference established in favor of males
by .. . the Idaho code cannot stand in the face of the
14 th Amendment's command that no state deny the
equal protection of the laws to any person within its
jurisdiction."
