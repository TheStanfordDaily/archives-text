# Army Advocate General Discusses Legal System
## 
### 
The military justice system is "at a
legislative crossroads," the Acting
Judge Advocate General of the U.S.
Army, Major General Harold Parker,
said yesterday in a lecture at the Law
Forum.
Parker, a Stanford graduate,
identified efforts by Senators Bayh and
Hatfield as "crucial" in determining the
future form of the military system.
After a brief description of the
system, concentrating on an analysis of
the role of the convening authority,
Parker opened the lecture to questions
from the audience. He faced aggressive
inquiries from a number of Venceremos
members and supporters, who had
passed out a leaflet on the case of
Private Billy Smith,' an enlisted man
accused of fragging 3 officers in
Vietnam.
The authority for the military
system of justice stems from Congress,
according to Parker, and the system is
not subject to civilian review at any
level, including the Supreme Court.
In the military system, the convening
authority—the officer in charge of the
unit involved—is essential. He chooses,
at least formally, the judge, panel of
officers, defense counsel, and
prosecutor in any court-martial. He also
decides whether charges should be
brought against an individual, and
reviews the decision of the
court-martial.
In fiscal 1971, the military held
2,8 00 general court-martials
(comparable to a felony trial), and
31,000 special courts-martial (similar to
a misdemeanor proceeding, with a
maximum six month sentence).
Parker advocated a change in the role
of the convening authority, removing
him from the processes selecting
members of the panel, and from review
of issues of fact in the trial.

He commented briefly on the Calley
case, estimating appeal time at a
minimum of one year, and
commending the military lawyers who
represented the prosecution and
defense.
