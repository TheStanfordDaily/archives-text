# Consumers Ask Fair Labelling
## 
### 
A Palo Alto-based consumers' group
is mailing letters today to 500
manufacturers, asking them to
voluntarily reform their labelling and
packaging practices.
The polite plea for a "standard of
candor and fair dealing between
producers and consumers" was issued
by Consumer Alliance, which has
several hundred members across the
country.
Biology Professor and ecologist Paul
Ehrlich and an assistant organized the
project five months ago.
Consumer Alliance President Roy
Kiesling said the consumer movement is
tied to the ecologists' "pressure to sell
us products that last, that can be
repaired and recycled.
"We inform them politely, and then
it's their move."
The letter asked that a "tag or
insert" be included with each product,
listing: the address of its manufacturer,
the complete ingredients of foods and
household chemicals, how the product
performed in tests and whether it has
caused any injuries, how to repair it,
and the date it was made or packaged.
The group promised to publicize the
efforts of companies cooperating with
the program and to "buy your product
instead of someone else's."
