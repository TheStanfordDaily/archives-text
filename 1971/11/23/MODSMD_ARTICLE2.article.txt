# Seale Explains Increased Programs To Aid Black Community Survival
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
Black Panther Party Chairman
Bobby Seale insisted last night that the
Panthers will make real the "pig
politicians' " pledge of "a chicken in
every pot."
He told an audience of over 800 in
Memorial Church that guns are only "a

tool" to defend Panther "survival
programs" in case of attack "by the
pigs."
Seale said that the Panthers'
"concrete" programs include free food,
shoes, and medical care for ghetto
blacks.
The black revolutionary repeatedly

called for "humanism" and opposed
indiscriminate animosity toward
whites: "Running around hating a
white person just because of the color
of his skin, it just don't make sense. It's
the same thing the Ku Klux Klan did."
The audience gave Seale a standing
ovation at the beginning and end of his
speech. The church was quiet during his
comments, except for occasional
applause and repetition of Seale's
chant, "Power to the People."
Black Expression
Seale commented that the "black
expression" movement of the last ten
years was "very necessary." But he said
making "black ice cream cones that
taste just like vanilla" is less important
than "feeding a hungry child in the
black community."
Seale, a co-founder of the Party,
told the crowd the Panthers "need
hammers and nails to build free medical
clinics. We keep the guns handy to
defend the right to pick up the
hammer."
The Panthers earn support in black
communities, Seale said, by actually
giving away "1000 bags of groceries
and 400 pairs of shoes" during a rally.
Algiers
In an obvious reference to Eldridge
Cleaver's Panther faction in Algiers,
Seale criticized those who "tell you
some wild stuff about coming back for
guerilla warfare."
Citing the slogan, "power grows out
of the barrel of the gun," Seale said,
"We have a few defectors in the black
community who believe that power
actually is the gun."
People are learning to support the
Panthers as a group rather than through
specific, well-known leaders, according
to Seale.
He said the Party is attempting to
eliminate hierarchical titles, including
his own: "We're working now to see if

in the next three years we can get rid of
the title, 'Chairman."
Seale, who was acquitted this
summer of murder charges in
Connecticut, said that police brutality
on college campuses has given students
"a crash course" in the oppression
faced by blacks.
Scale's speech was sponsored by the
Black Students Union and the
Intercommunal Survival Committee, a
group of radicals organizing local
"survival programs."
Second Speech
The speech was Seale's second
Stanford appearance this month.
November 9, he was a surprise
substitute for the ailing Georgia
Jackson.
Seale was accompanied by five
Panther leaders, who stood around him
during the speech and acted as watchful
bodyguards.
Before Seale was introduced, the
audience heard "ghetto music" by the
visiting Eddie Gale jazz group and a
lengthy speech on sickel cell anemia, a
hereditary disorder afflicting blacks.
Medical student Don Williams said
the Midpeninsula Sickle Cell Anemia
Foundation is setting up research
programs and "screening" facilities to
detect those with the disease.
In a Daily interview before his
speech, Seale commented that he still
has "constant contact with the observer
team" which is investigating Attica
Prison.
Seale said the deaths at Attica, when
police charged a prison rebellion, would
"definitely" have been avoided if the
charge had been delayed until he could
have additional meetings with
prisoners.
Seale charged the rebellion was
ended just before he could return to
prisoners with "a whole big machinery"
to end the uprising.
