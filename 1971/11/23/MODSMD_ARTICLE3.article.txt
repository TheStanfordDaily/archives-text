# Tensions Still Present
## Ravenswood Still Beset By Problems 
### GARY ATKINS Second of two parts 
People at Ravenswood High School in East Palo
still talk about this year's "white invasion" of the
school—but its still too early for them to tell how
successful the "invasion" has been.
Until this year, Ravenswood was virtually all black.
Then, this fall, the school became the key to success
in an innovative attempt to make voluntary
desegregation work throughout the Sequoia Union
district.
So far, both Ravenswood and desegregation seem
to be doing fine—over 500 whites have transferred
into a school that until this year could count no more
than 18 whites among its students.
However, the voluntary integration hasn't
succeeded completely yet. School officials are quick
to point out that there are still serious problems to be
overcome and, as one official says, voluntary
desegregation may at best turn out to be only
temporarily successful.
New Promise
Much depends upon Ravenswood, where white
students were attracted by a promise that the
traditional high school curricula could be ditched and
an innovative program created in its place.
This year, in place of the standard college
preparatory program of other high schools,
Ravenswood offers flexible scheduling, and a variety

of classes that range from "War Criminals" to
"Mountaineering."
The problems fall in three categories:
—tensions between blacks and whites arising from
integration itself, along with a lingering debate about
Ravenswood being a community-controlled and
community-oriented school;
—a potential gap in the types of blacks and whites
attending Ravenswood; and
—the yardstick by which Ravenswood's success will
be measured.
Little Tension
On the first point, Ravenswood principal Clarence
Cryer notes that "We had a lot of very enthusiastic
white kids transferring in from the hills to a school
that's already inhabited. At first, I thought blacks
might be fighting to maintain their identity, their
leadership. But that hasn't happened."
So far, both whites and blacks have kept primarily
to themselves. There have been a few incidents but,
Cryer says, nothing that could not be handled by the
school itself.
"Many people felt it was really going to be hell for
us the first couple days of school," he says. "And I
suppose I felt that if 1 could just make it through
those first few days, we'd make it."
"So far though, we've had no incident any more
serious than in any other school, or in any other
years."

Several students interviewed said the same thing.
"At first there was the usual, typical hassle," one
said. "But it's cooled down a lot. It's been a lot worse
in other places. I think relationships between blacks
and whites here are improving."
And, a white associate editor of the school
newspaper, Mike McCurry says, "You had a lot of
liberal white students—in some cases knee-jerk
liberals—transferring in from the hills. Of course black
students were going to be suspicious. Now though, I
think many are trying to put it all together."
But, he adds, "It'll take time. The black students
obviously had a very strong identification with the
school. You can detect a real love for Ravenswood in
them. And now that whites are here, it's a completely
different school."
The blacks are not unanimous in their reaction to
the whites.
Whites Curious
"You have a lot of white students who are trying
to find out what blacks are all about here," Sherry
Mitchell, the Commissioner of Cultural Affairs for the
Ravenswood student government, says."And they
seem disgusted that we're not trying to make friends
with them."
"They're trying to force us to mix and we'd much
rather see an organization, a black family created."
