# Tensions Still Present
## Ravenswood Still Beset By Problems 
### GARY ATKINS Second of two parts 
People at Ravenswood High School in East Palo
still talk about this year's "white invasion" of the
school—but its still too early for them to tell how
successful the "invasion" has been.
Until this year, Ravenswood was virtually all black.
Then, this fall, the school became the key to success
in an innovative attempt to make voluntary
desegregation work throughout the Sequoia Union
district.
So far, both Ravenswood and desegregation seem
to be doing fine—over 500 whites have transferred
into a school that until this year could count no more
than 18 whites among its students.
However, the voluntary integration hasn't
succeeded completely yet. School officials are quick
to point out that there are still serious problems to be
overcome and, as one official says, voluntary
desegregation may at best turn out to be only
temporarily successful.
New Promise
Much depends upon Ravenswood, where white
students were attracted by a promise that the
traditional high school curricula could be ditched and
an innovative program created in its place.
This year, in place of the standard college
preparatory program of other high schools,
Ravenswood offers flexible scheduling, and a variety

of classes that range from "War Criminals" to
"Mountaineering."
The problems fall in three categories:
—tensions between blacks and whites arising from
integration itself, along with a lingering debate about
Ravenswood being a community-controlled and
community-oriented school;
—a potential gap in the types of blacks and whites
attending Ravenswood; and
—the yardstick by which Ravenswood's success will
be measured.
Little Tension
On the first point, Ravenswood principal Clarence
Cryer notes that "We had a lot of very enthusiastic
white kids transferring in from the hills to a school
that's already inhabited. At first, I thought blacks
might be fighting to maintain their identity, their
leadership. But that hasn't happened."
So far, both whites and blacks have kept primarily
to themselves. There have been a few incidents but,
Cryer says, nothing that could not be handled by the
school itself.
"Many people felt it was really going to be hell for
us the first couple days of school," he says. "And I
suppose I felt that if 1 could just make it through
those first few days, we'd make it."
"So far though, we've had no incident any more
serious than in any other school, or in any other
years."

Several students interviewed said the same thing.
"At first there was the usual, typical hassle," one
said. "But it's cooled down a lot. It's been a lot worse
in other places. I think relationships between blacks
and whites here are improving."
And, a white associate editor of the school
newspaper, Mike McCurry says, "You had a lot of
liberal white students—in some cases knee-jerk
liberals—transferring in from the hills. Of course black
students were going to be suspicious. Now though, I
think many are trying to put it all together."
But, he adds, "It'll take time. The black students
obviously had a very strong identification with the
school. You can detect a real love for Ravenswood in
them. And now that whites are here, it's a completely
different school."
The blacks are not unanimous in their reaction to
the whites.
Whites Curious
"You have a lot of white students who are trying
to find out what blacks are all about here," Sherry
Mitchell, the Commissioner of Cultural Affairs for the
Ravenswood student government, says."And they
seem disgusted that we're not trying to make friends
with them."
"They're trying to force us to mix and we'd much
rather see an organization, a black family created."
She opposed the desegregation plan for
Ravenswood when it was developed and still does. "It
didn't look like it was designed to meet the needs of
the black students, and it still doesn't. It seemed to
me that since this was a black school, in a black
community, it should meet the needs of blacks. But
the integration plan was designed only to reach white
students."
Indeed, school officials admit blacks were perhaps
not as involved in the development of the plan as
they should have been.
Still, some students who initially felt as Mitchell
does have since modified their views. Craig Taylor,
who has attended Ravenswood for three years, and
who was a candidate for student body president, says
his first reaction to the plan was that "it was a sort of
divide-and-conquer program aimed at the blacks."
But, he says, "after a week or two of hearing the
plans, I thought it was an excellent idea. School is
supposed to prepare you for life after high school,
and life isn't all black or white, so this plan helps put
it right on the line."
As for the second difficulty Ravenswood faces, the
possibility of a large academic gap between whites
and blacks, Cryer notes that the problem may exist
but says it's too early to tell yet.
All Volunteers
What it amounts to is that everyone at
Ravenswood, both teachers and students, is a
volunteer—except possibly many of the black

students. Though they were free to volunteer out,
they may have stayed more out of convenience than
choice.
So, there may be highly motivated whites seeking
new educational experiences at Ravenswood, and less
motivated blacks who may simply have not wanted to
transfer to a strange school.
The only problem is that Ravenswood itself is now
a strange school, compared to what it was a year ago.
"We have tremendously good students here," Cryer
says. "But it does make sense that if a black student
had trouble in junior high school, he is going to go to
high school where he feels most comfortable." Up
until this year, that school may have been
Ravenswood.
Academic Gaps
"If this were true, and it continued to be true," he
says, "we could have serious academic gaps if the
white coming in is the type who feels he has a better
chance to achieve here while the black is
unmotivated.
"We feel we can meet the needs of all," Cryer says,
"both those who are academically talented and those
who are not.
"We think we have enough options available to
handle students at any level. If we can stimulate
interest by giving an unmotivated student a unit of
folk rock, then maybe we can lead him into political
science. If we can get him involved in community
action, then we may be able to get him involved in
looking at government processes.

"We have to start somewhere with him. We just
can't say 'Take American Government or forget it
and get out."
Measuring Stick
On the third question, that of measuring
Ravenswood's success, Cryer says evaluating the
school's success and in turn the success of the
voluntary desegregation program will be rather
simple. "It'll depend on how many students want to
stay here next year and how many are lined up
outside the door trying to get in," he says.
Yet, at the same time there is another measuring
stick which creates something of a dilemma for the
school, the question of how many of the several
hundred blacks who left Ravenswood will want to
come back.
"If the school is as successful as is hoped, we
should attract all those blacks back here," Cryer says.
"If we do, if we reverse the flow, we will have
succeeded, yet failed, since the percentage of black
students might go back up."
Only with spring then, will the district get its first
indication of just how well the program has worked.
Some students though are not waiting that long to
proclaim results.
"For myself," McCurry said, "it's already been a
big success. The real test after all is going to come for
the whites when we get out of school. It's going to be
in how we relate to blacks. Because of Ravenswood,
we should be in a far better position to deal with life
later on."

traditional high school curricula could be ditched and
an innovative program created in its place.
This year, in place of the standard college
preparatory program of other high schools,
Ravenswood offers flexible scheduling, and a variety

of classes that range from "War Criminals" to
"Mountaineering."
The problems fall in three categories:
—tensions between blacks and whites arising from
integration itself, along with a lingering debate about
Ravenswood being a community-controlled and
community-oriented school;
—a potential gap in the types of blacks and whites
attending Ravenswood; and
—the yardstick by which Ravenswood's success will
be measured.
Little Tension
On the first point, Ravenswood principal Clarence
Cryer notes that "We had a lot of very enthusiastic
white kids transferring in from the hills to a school
that's already inhabited. At first, I thought blacks
might be fighting to maintain their identity, their
leadership. But that hasn't happened."
So far, both whites and blacks have kept primarily
to themselves. There have been a few incidents but,
Cryer says, nothing that could not be handled by the
school itself.
"Many people felt it was really going to be hell for
us the first couple days of school," he says. "And I
suppose I felt that if 1 could just make it through
those first few days, we'd make it."
"So far though, we've had no incident any more
serious than in any other school, or in any other
years."

Several students interviewed said the same thing.
"At first there was the usual, typical hassle," one
said. "But it's cooled down a lot. It's been a lot worse
in other places. I think relationships between blacks
and whites here are improving."
And, a white associate editor of the school
newspaper, Mike McCurry says, "You had a lot of
liberal white students—in some cases knee-jerk
liberals—transferring in from the hills. Of course black
students were going to be suspicious. Now though, I
think many are trying to put it all together."
But, he adds, "It'll take time. The black students
obviously had a very strong identification with the
school. You can detect a real love for Ravenswood in
them. And now that whites are here, it's a completely
different school."
The blacks are not unanimous in their reaction to
the whites.
Whites Curious
"You have a lot of white students who are trying
to find out what blacks are all about here," Sherry
Mitchell, the Commissioner of Cultural Affairs for the
Ravenswood student government, says."And they
seem disgusted that we're not trying to make friends
with them."
"They're trying to force us to mix and we'd much
rather see an organization, a black family created."
She opposed the desegregation plan for
Ravenswood when it was developed and still does. "It
didn't look like it was designed to meet the needs of
the black students, and it still doesn't. It seemed to
me that since this was a black school, in a black
community, it should meet the needs of blacks. But
the integration plan was designed only to reach white
students."
Indeed, school officials admit blacks were perhaps
not as involved in the development of the plan as
they should have been.
Still, some students who initially felt as Mitchell
does have since modified their views. Craig Taylor,
who has attended Ravenswood for three years, and
who was a candidate for student body president, says
his first reaction to the plan was that "it was a sort of
divide-and-conquer program aimed at the blacks."
But, he says, "after a week or two of hearing the
plans, I thought it was an excellent idea. School is
supposed to prepare you for life after high school,
and life isn't all black or white, so this plan helps put
it right on the line."
As for the second difficulty Ravenswood faces, the
possibility of a large academic gap between whites
and blacks, Cryer notes that the problem may exist
but says it's too early to tell yet.
All Volunteers
What it amounts to is that everyone at
Ravenswood, both teachers and students, is a
volunteer—except possibly many of the black

students. Though they were free to volunteer out,
they may have stayed more out of convenience than
choice.
So, there may be highly motivated whites seeking
new educational experiences at Ravenswood, and less
motivated blacks who may simply have not wanted to
transfer to a strange school.
The only problem is that Ravenswood itself is now
a strange school, compared to what it was a year ago.
"We have tremendously good students here," Cryer
says. "But it does make sense that if a black student
had trouble in junior high school, he is going to go to
high school where he feels most comfortable." Up
until this year, that school may have been
Ravenswood.
Academic Gaps
"If this were true, and it continued to be true," he
says, "we could have serious academic gaps if the
white coming in is the type who feels he has a better
chance to achieve here while the black is
unmotivated.
"We feel we can meet the needs of all," Cryer says,
"both those who are academically talented and those
who are not.
"We think we have enough options available to
handle students at any level. If we can stimulate
interest by giving an unmotivated student a unit of
folk rock, then maybe we can lead him into political
science. If we can get him involved in community
action, then we may be able to get him involved in
looking at government processes.

"We have to start somewhere with him. We just
can't say 'Take American Government or forget it
and get out."
Measuring Stick
On the third question, that of measuring
Ravenswood's success, Cryer says evaluating the
school's success and in turn the success of the
voluntary desegregation program will be rather
simple. "It'll depend on how many students want to
stay here next year and how many are lined up
outside the door trying to get in," he says.
Yet, at the same time there is another measuring
stick which creates something of a dilemma for the
school, the question of how many of the several
hundred blacks who left Ravenswood will want to
come back.
"If the school is as successful as is hoped, we
should attract all those blacks back here," Cryer says.
"If we do, if we reverse the flow, we will have
succeeded, yet failed, since the percentage of black
students might go back up."
Only with spring then, will the district get its first
indication of just how well the program has worked.
Some students though are not waiting that long to
proclaim results.
"For myself," McCurry said, "it's already been a
big success. The real test after all is going to come for
the whites when we get out of school. It's going to be
in how we relate to blacks. Because of Ravenswood,
we should be in a far better position to deal with life
later on."
People at Ravenswood High School in East Palo
still talk about this year's "white invasion" of the
school—but its still too early for them to tell how
successful the "invasion" has been.
Until this year, Ravenswood was virtually all black.
Then, this fall, the school became the key to success
in an innovative attempt to make voluntary
desegregation work throughout the Sequoia Union
district.
So far, both Ravenswood and desegregation seem
to be doing fine—over 500 whites have transferred
into a school that until this year could count no more
than 18 whites among its students.
However, the voluntary integration hasn't
succeeded completely yet. School officials are quick
to point out that there are still serious problems to be
overcome and, as one official says, voluntary
desegregation may at best turn out to be only
temporarily successful.

to themselves. There have been a few incidents but,
Cryer says, nothing that could not be handled by the
school itself.
"Many people felt it was really going to be hell for
us the first couple days of school," he says. "And I
suppose I felt that if 1 could just make it through
those first few days, we'd make it."
"So far though, we've had no incident any more
serious than in any other school, or in any other
years."

Several students interviewed said the same thing.
"At first there was the usual, typical hassle," one
said. "But it's cooled down a lot. It's been a lot worse
in other places. I think relationships between blacks
and whites here are improving."
And, a white associate editor of the school
newspaper, Mike McCurry says, "You had a lot of
liberal white students—in some cases knee-jerk
liberals—transferring in from the hills. Of course black
students were going to be suspicious. Now though, I
think many are trying to put it all together."
But, he adds, "It'll take time. The black students
obviously had a very strong identification with the
school. You can detect a real love for Ravenswood in
them. And now that whites are here, it's a completely
different school."
The blacks are not unanimous in their reaction to
the whites.
Whites Curious
"You have a lot of white students who are trying
to find out what blacks are all about here," Sherry
Mitchell, the Commissioner of Cultural Affairs for the
Ravenswood student government, says."And they
seem disgusted that we're not trying to make friends
with them."
"They're trying to force us to mix and we'd much
rather see an organization, a black family created."
She opposed the desegregation plan for
Ravenswood when it was developed and still does. "It
didn't look like it was designed to meet the needs of
the black students, and it still doesn't. It seemed to
me that since this was a black school, in a black
community, it should meet the needs of blacks. But
the integration plan was designed only to reach white
students."
Indeed, school officials admit blacks were perhaps
not as involved in the development of the plan as
they should have been.
Still, some students who initially felt as Mitchell
does have since modified their views. Craig Taylor,
who has attended Ravenswood for three years, and
who was a candidate for student body president, says
his first reaction to the plan was that "it was a sort of
divide-and-conquer program aimed at the blacks."
But, he says, "after a week or two of hearing the
plans, I thought it was an excellent idea. School is
supposed to prepare you for life after high school,
and life isn't all black or white, so this plan helps put
it right on the line."
As for the second difficulty Ravenswood faces, the
possibility of a large academic gap between whites
and blacks, Cryer notes that the problem may exist
but says it's too early to tell yet.
All Volunteers
What it amounts to is that everyone at
Ravenswood, both teachers and students, is a
volunteer—except possibly many of the black

students. Though they were free to volunteer out,
they may have stayed more out of convenience than
choice.
So, there may be highly motivated whites seeking
new educational experiences at Ravenswood, and less
motivated blacks who may simply have not wanted to
transfer to a strange school.
The only problem is that Ravenswood itself is now
a strange school, compared to what it was a year ago.
"We have tremendously good students here," Cryer
says. "But it does make sense that if a black student
had trouble in junior high school, he is going to go to
high school where he feels most comfortable." Up
until this year, that school may have been
Ravenswood.
Academic Gaps
"If this were true, and it continued to be true," he
says, "we could have serious academic gaps if the
white coming in is the type who feels he has a better
chance to achieve here while the black is
unmotivated.
"We feel we can meet the needs of all," Cryer says,
"both those who are academically talented and those
who are not.
"We think we have enough options available to
handle students at any level. If we can stimulate
interest by giving an unmotivated student a unit of
folk rock, then maybe we can lead him into political
science. If we can get him involved in community
action, then we may be able to get him involved in
looking at government processes.

"We have to start somewhere with him. We just
can't say 'Take American Government or forget it
and get out."
Measuring Stick
On the third question, that of measuring
Ravenswood's success, Cryer says evaluating the
school's success and in turn the success of the
voluntary desegregation program will be rather
simple. "It'll depend on how many students want to
stay here next year and how many are lined up
outside the door trying to get in," he says.
Yet, at the same time there is another measuring
stick which creates something of a dilemma for the
school, the question of how many of the several
hundred blacks who left Ravenswood will want to
come back.
"If the school is as successful as is hoped, we
should attract all those blacks back here," Cryer says.
"If we do, if we reverse the flow, we will have
succeeded, yet failed, since the percentage of black
students might go back up."
Only with spring then, will the district get its first
indication of just how well the program has worked.
Some students though are not waiting that long to
proclaim results.
"For myself," McCurry said, "it's already been a
big success. The real test after all is going to come for
the whites when we get out of school. It's going to be
in how we relate to blacks. Because of Ravenswood,
we should be in a far better position to deal with life
later on."
People at Ravenswood High School in East Palo
still talk about this year's "white invasion" of the
school—but its still too early for them to tell how
successful the "invasion" has been.
Until this year, Ravenswood was virtually all black.
Then, this fall, the school became the key to success
in an innovative attempt to make voluntary
desegregation work throughout the Sequoia Union
district.
So far, both Ravenswood and desegregation seem
to be doing fine—over 500 whites have transferred
into a school that until this year could count no more
than 18 whites among its students.
However, the voluntary integration hasn't
succeeded completely yet. School officials are quick
to point out that there are still serious problems to be
overcome and, as one official says, voluntary
desegregation may at best turn out to be only
temporarily successful.
New Promise
Much depends upon Ravenswood, where white
students were attracted by a promise that the
traditional high school curricula could be ditched and
an innovative program created in its place.
This year, in place of the standard college
preparatory program of other high schools,
Ravenswood offers flexible scheduling, and a variety

of classes that range from "War Criminals" to
"Mountaineering."
The problems fall in three categories:
—tensions between blacks and whites arising from
integration itself, along with a lingering debate about
Ravenswood being a community-controlled and
community-oriented school;
—a potential gap in the types of blacks and whites
attending Ravenswood; and
—the yardstick by which Ravenswood's success will
be measured.
Little Tension
On the first point, Ravenswood principal Clarence
Cryer notes that "We had a lot of very enthusiastic
white kids transferring in from the hills to a school
that's already inhabited. At first, I thought blacks
might be fighting to maintain their identity, their
leadership. But that hasn't happened."
So far, both whites and blacks have kept primarily
to themselves. There have been a few incidents but,
Cryer says, nothing that could not be handled by the

students were going to be suspicious. Now though, I
think many are trying to put it all together."
But, he adds, "It'll take time. The black students
obviously had a very strong identification with the
school. You can detect a real love for Ravenswood in
them. And now that whites are here, it's a completely
different school."
The blacks are not unanimous in their reaction to
the whites.
Whites Curious
"You have a lot of white students who are trying
to find out what blacks are all about here," Sherry
Mitchell, the Commissioner of Cultural Affairs for the
Ravenswood student government, says."And they
seem disgusted that we're not trying to make friends
with them."
"They're trying to force us to mix and we'd much
rather see an organization, a black family created."
She opposed the desegregation plan for
Ravenswood when it was developed and still does. "It
didn't look like it was designed to meet the needs of
the black students, and it still doesn't. It seemed to
me that since this was a black school, in a black
community, it should meet the needs of blacks. But
the integration plan was designed only to reach white
students."
Indeed, school officials admit blacks were perhaps
not as involved in the development of the plan as
they should have been.
Still, some students who initially felt as Mitchell
does have since modified their views. Craig Taylor,
who has attended Ravenswood for three years, and
who was a candidate for student body president, says
his first reaction to the plan was that "it was a sort of
divide-and-conquer program aimed at the blacks."
But, he says, "after a week or two of hearing the
plans, I thought it was an excellent idea. School is
supposed to prepare you for life after high school,
and life isn't all black or white, so this plan helps put
it right on the line."
As for the second difficulty Ravenswood faces, the
possibility of a large academic gap between whites
and blacks, Cryer notes that the problem may exist
but says it's too early to tell yet.
All Volunteers
What it amounts to is that everyone at
Ravenswood, both teachers and students, is a
volunteer—except possibly many of the black

students. Though they were free to volunteer out,
they may have stayed more out of convenience than
choice.
So, there may be highly motivated whites seeking
new educational experiences at Ravenswood, and less
motivated blacks who may simply have not wanted to
transfer to a strange school.
The only problem is that Ravenswood itself is now
a strange school, compared to what it was a year ago.
"We have tremendously good students here," Cryer
says. "But it does make sense that if a black student
had trouble in junior high school, he is going to go to
high school where he feels most comfortable." Up
until this year, that school may have been
Ravenswood.
Academic Gaps
"If this were true, and it continued to be true," he
says, "we could have serious academic gaps if the
white coming in is the type who feels he has a better
chance to achieve here while the black is
unmotivated.
"We feel we can meet the needs of all," Cryer says,
"both those who are academically talented and those
who are not.
"We think we have enough options available to
handle students at any level. If we can stimulate
interest by giving an unmotivated student a unit of
folk rock, then maybe we can lead him into political
science. If we can get him involved in community
action, then we may be able to get him involved in
looking at government processes.

"We have to start somewhere with him. We just
can't say 'Take American Government or forget it
and get out."
Measuring Stick
On the third question, that of measuring
Ravenswood's success, Cryer says evaluating the
school's success and in turn the success of the
voluntary desegregation program will be rather
simple. "It'll depend on how many students want to
stay here next year and how many are lined up
outside the door trying to get in," he says.
Yet, at the same time there is another measuring
stick which creates something of a dilemma for the
school, the question of how many of the several
hundred blacks who left Ravenswood will want to
come back.
"If the school is as successful as is hoped, we
should attract all those blacks back here," Cryer says.
"If we do, if we reverse the flow, we will have
succeeded, yet failed, since the percentage of black
students might go back up."
Only with spring then, will the district get its first
indication of just how well the program has worked.
Some students though are not waiting that long to
proclaim results.
"For myself," McCurry said, "it's already been a
big success. The real test after all is going to come for
the whites when we get out of school. It's going to be
in how we relate to blacks. Because of Ravenswood,
we should be in a far better position to deal with life
later on."
People at Ravenswood High School in East Palo
still talk about this year's "white invasion" of the
school—but its still too early for them to tell how
successful the "invasion" has been.
Until this year, Ravenswood was virtually all black.
Then, this fall, the school became the key to success
in an innovative attempt to make voluntary
desegregation work throughout the Sequoia Union
district.
So far, both Ravenswood and desegregation seem
to be doing fine—over 500 whites have transferred
into a school that until this year could count no more
than 18 whites among its students.
However, the voluntary integration hasn't
succeeded completely yet. School officials are quick
to point out that there are still serious problems to be
overcome and, as one official says, voluntary
desegregation may at best turn out to be only
temporarily successful.
New Promise
Much depends upon Ravenswood, where white
students were attracted by a promise that the
traditional high school curricula could be ditched and
an innovative program created in its place.
This year, in place of the standard college
preparatory program of other high schools,
Ravenswood offers flexible scheduling, and a variety

of classes that range from "War Criminals" to
"Mountaineering."
The problems fall in three categories:
—tensions between blacks and whites arising from
integration itself, along with a lingering debate about
Ravenswood being a community-controlled and
community-oriented school;
—a potential gap in the types of blacks and whites
attending Ravenswood; and
—the yardstick by which Ravenswood's success will
be measured.
Little Tension
On the first point, Ravenswood principal Clarence
Cryer notes that "We had a lot of very enthusiastic
white kids transferring in from the hills to a school
that's already inhabited. At first, I thought blacks
might be fighting to maintain their identity, their
leadership. But that hasn't happened."
So far, both whites and blacks have kept primarily
to themselves. There have been a few incidents but,
Cryer says, nothing that could not be handled by the
school itself.
"Many people felt it was really going to be hell for
us the first couple days of school," he says. "And I
suppose I felt that if 1 could just make it through
those first few days, we'd make it."
"So far though, we've had no incident any more
serious than in any other school, or in any other
years."

Several students interviewed said the same thing.
"At first there was the usual, typical hassle," one
said. "But it's cooled down a lot. It's been a lot worse
in other places. I think relationships between blacks
and whites here are improving."
And, a white associate editor of the school
newspaper, Mike McCurry says, "You had a lot of
liberal white students—in some cases knee-jerk
liberals—transferring in from the hills. Of course black
students were going to be suspicious. Now though, I
think many are trying to put it all together."
But, he adds, "It'll take time. The black students
