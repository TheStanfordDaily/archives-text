# Sacramento St. Blacks Halt Shockley Speech
## 
### 
SACRAMENTO (AP) â€” A group of black students forced cancellation of a scheduled
speech by Nobel Prize winner William Shockley at Sacramento State College
yesterday, charging he is a racist.
The demonstrators, saying they were members of the college's Pan-African
Students Union, took over the speakers platform and demanded the firing of
those who invited the Stanford University engineer to speak.
Despite some shoving and fighting on the stage, there were no arrests or injuries
reported.
An overflow audience of about 500 was on hand for the speech, arranged by a
faculty-student committee using student fees.
Shockley, co-winner of the 1 956 Nobel Prize for physics for development of
the transistor, had just begun to speak when the disruption occurred. He left the
campus immediately.
He has been the target of young activists since a 1968 speech in which he said
he believes the "genetic potential for intelligence" among blacks has deteriorated
in the past 30 years because of the welfare system's encouragement of large Negro
families.
One unidentified black who took over the microphone said "there is no
freedom for racists at Sacramento State College, Nobel Prize-winner or not."
Later the demonstrators marched to the administration building and presented
a list of demands including a prohibition against using black students' fees for
"racist" speakers, hiring of additional black faculty and administrators and more
financial aid to black students.
Darrell Inabnit, administrative vice president who met with the blacks, said the
incident was "very unfortunate" and "breaches the entire matter of freedom of
speech."
