# Conservative Nominee...
## Rehnquist's Law Interpretation Favors Government 
### Linda Ho 
Recently, while being
questioned before the Senate in
regard to his 1964 stand against
forced integration of public
accomodations (hotels,
restaurants) in Phoenix, Arizona,
Supreme Court nominee William
H. Rehnquist stated simply that
he had changed his mind. No one
apparently tried to find out why
he had changed his mind, nor did
Rehnquist volunteer the
information.
In 1964 he had stood in front
of the Phoenix City Council, and
said, "1 am a lawyer without a
client tonight. I am speaking only
for myself. I would like to speak
in opposition to the proposed
ordinance because I believe that
the values it sacrifices are greater
than the values which it gives. . . .
So far as equality of treatment by
the Federal, State or the Local
government is concerned, I think
there is no question. | But) Here
you are talking about a man's
private property, and you are
saying, in effect, that people shall
have access to that man's property
whether he wants it or not. .. .
This, to me, would lead to the
conclusion that the ordinance
ought to be rejected.
"What has brought people to
Phoenix and Arizona?.. . . Free
enterprise and by that I mean not
just free enterprise in the sense of
the right to make a buck but to
manage your own affairs as free as
possible from the interference of
government."
What has made Rehnquist
reject this valid and libertarian
position? If he did so because of
fear that an unpopular standpoint,
for which he might be
characterized as racist, would
jeapordize his chance to sit on the
Court, one would not be
impressed by his integrity. But the
alternative, i.e., that he truly did
change his mind, is perhaps even
more frightening.
Examination of some of

Rehnquist's speeches and writings
indicates that the lawyer with
libertarian ideas of 1964 has all
but disappeared. The consistency
of his rejection of individual rights
in various areas of the law falls
into a politically Conservative
pattern.
Take a most obvious example:
Rehnquist criticized a Supreme
court decision holding that the
constitutional rights of an avowed
Communist and an ex-communist
were violated because a state bar
had refused to let them sit for a
bar examination. Rehnquist
wrote:
"A decision of any court based
on a combination of charity and

ideological sympathy is
regrettable no matter whence it
comes. But what could be
tolerated as a warm-hearted
aberration in the local trial judge
becomes nothing less than a
constitutional transgression when
enunciated by the highest court of
the land." (American Bar
Association Journal, 1968;
emphasis mine).
Beyond the obvious criticism
that Rehnquist does not believe
that a man's Sixth Amendment
right to counsel includes
the individual's right to choose his
own counsel, including instances
in which the counsel has
unpopular political views. It
should be pointed out that the
restrictions Rehnquist would like
to see cannot be based on the
restricted person's practice of the
law, but are based on the
restricted person's views.
A Communist lawyer has his

First Amendment rights to argue
his ideology in and out of court.
But there is no way he can impose
his ideology on others, where the
laws of the land stand in the way
(assuming that the lawyer is not a
member of the legislature, which
possibility is not properly part of
the subject Rehnquist is
considering here). And if the laws
of the land do not stand in the
way, presumably the same
position might have been argued
by a lawyer with a different
political persuasion. Therefore,
there is no cause and effect
relationship between "Communist
lawyers" and "Communist law,"
"subversion," or what you will.

'...Rehnquist (is) the kind of man who
jealously guards his government from the
assaults of its citizens, justified or unjustified/

Furthermore, the implication
of Rehnquist's position, could just
as reasonably be that the
government has a right to
disqualify an applicant for a
licensed profession purely on the
basis of his political beliefs. The
readiness of Rehnquist to accept
the government's right to license
certain professions is some
indication of a non-libertarian
reference point, as such licensing
procedures invariably produce
economic cartels on the order of
the medieval guild systems.
In the realm of civil
disobedience, Rehnquist
remarked: "In the area of public
law .. . disobedience cannot be
tolerated, whether it is violent or
nonviolent disobedience. If force
or the threat of force is required
to enforce the law, we must not
shirk from its employment." (as
quoted in the N.Y. Times,
3/11/71).

Those who practice civil
disobedience do not expect it to
be tolerated; they expect to go to
jail for their disobedience. But
from Rehnquist's failure to
distinguish between violent and
non-violent civil disobedience, the
nonviolent, non-resisting ones in
these groups may also begin to
expect the nightstick.
Rehnquist also has had his say
on foreign affairs. "The
President's determination to
authorize incursion into these
Cambodian border areas is
precisely the sort of tactical
decision traditionally confided to
the Commander in Chief in the
conduct of armed conflict. From
the time of the drafting of the
Constitution it has been clear that
the Commander in Chief has
authority to take prompt action
to protect American lives in
situations involving hostilities..
(NYU Law Review, June 1970).
Assuming arguendo the
constitutionality of such an act, a
forceful reply to Rehnquist's
argument is provided in the
following statement: "Justice
Frankfurter, in more than one
ooinion which he authored while
on the Supreme Court, warned
against the tendency to equate
constitutionality with
desirability."
The Speaker? William
Rehnquist (speech on "Privacy,
Surveillance and the Law").
Apparently, in this context,
"desirability" to Rehnquist is

synonymous with military
expediencey, and is independent
of the morality of the war, or
worse, he believes both the
incursion and the war to be
morally justified. Consider also
the way that the vote on the
Court would go if it ever decided
to hear the issue of the
Constitutionality of the Vietnam
war.
Rehnquist has argued before
the Federal Bar Association that
government employees who
criticize U.S. policy in Vietnam
should lose their jobs. He said,
"The government as an employer
has a legitimate and
constitutionally recognized
interest in limiting public criticism
on the part of its employees, even
though the same Government has
no similar constitutionally valid
claim to limit dissent on the part
of its citizens" (N.Y. Times,
3/11/72).

I do not wish to argue the
point that the Government may
discharge which of its employees
it wishes; but to say that there is a
legitimate and constitutionally
recognized interest in limiting
dissent is simply factually
incorrect. Public employees are
also private citizens, and I am not
convinced that their First
Amendment rights should be
diluted the moment that they are
in government employ.
First of all, if their criticism is
invalid, no one, least of all
Rehnquist, would deny the
government the right to reply; and
secondly, if the criticism is valid,
it is the right of every citizen to
hear it. Therefore, the curtailment
of the First Amendment rights of
public employees is probably
based on some unstated fear that
their criticism is apt to be more
valid, as they have greater access

to information than the average
private citizen.
All this tends to paint a picture
of Rehnquist as the kind of man
who jealously guards his
government from the assaults of
its citizens, justified or
unjustified.
Perhaps, it's all part of being a
good public employee. . . Any
President, and any Attorney
General, wants his immediate
underlings to be not only
competent attorneys but to be
politically and philosophically
attuned to the policies of the
administration." (N.Y. Times,
11/11/71). Rehnquist seems to
have been made for that job.
There is little reason to believe
that he and the administration
will be any less content with each
other when he sits on the Court.
