# Post Warren Era...
## Stasis Predicted In High Court 
### Herbert Packer 
As we enter the post-Warren era what can
we expect of the Supreme Court? I use the
term "post-Warren era" because nobody
knows what simplistic label will be attached to
this era. It is interesting that we are so
habituated to the label "Warren Court" that
no one pauses to reflect that no one today
talks about the Vinson Court, or the Stone
Court or the Hughes Court. We are so bemused
by contemporary history that we attach undue
importance to what the Supreme Court
decided during Earl Warren's Chief Justiceship.
The major innovations of that era were the
segregation decisions, the reapportionment
cases, and the extension of constitutional
protections to criminal defendants. The
principal techniques of the Court during those
years were (a) the use of the Equal Protection
clause to enforce such substantive rights as the
right not to be discriminated against on the
ground of race and the right to have one's vote
counted equally with those of others; and (b)
the use of the Due Process clause to
incorporate and to develop the guarantees of
the Bill of Rights against the states.
It is certainly appropriate to ask whether
(a) these newly-developed rights will be
maintained and further developed, or
neglected and eroded and (b) these techniques
will continue to be employed.
Assuming that President Nixon's most
recent nominees — Lewis Powell and William
Rehnquist — are confirmed by the Senate, and
that they have a predisposition to question the
rights just mentioned, is it reasonable to
conclude that they will routinely vote for
positions inconsistent with those rights?
Using "box scores" on the Supreme court is
a very dubious enterprise, even assuming that
the votes have already been cast. That can be
shown to be true of Hugo Black and John
Harlan. Black, people tend to forget, came to
the Supreme Court as a populist Senator who
had belonged to the Klu Klux Klan. He then
became an ardent advocate of the view that

free speech is an absolute. Harlan came to the
Court as a conservative lawyer. During his
tenure on the Court he took a very dim view
of Black's position that speech must be
protected at all costs. How, then, would one
have expected Black and Harlan to vote on this
issue:
One, Street, angered by the shooting of
James Meredith while on a peace march in
Mississippi burns an American flag on the
stated ground that "we don't need no flag. . . .
If they let that happen to Meredith we don't
need an American flag." He is convicted of
burning the flag and he argues that his act in
doing so is protected because he was exercising
his right of free speech.
Harlan held in an opinion for the majority
that Street's act was a symbolic form of speech
and was entitled to constitutional protection.
Black, in dissent, argued that "speech is
speech" and what Street was convicted of was
an act.
Examples could be easily multiplied of how
easy it is to confound the simplistic
practitioners of the "box score" technique.
When one tries to predict how the Court or
given members thereof will act in the future,
the perils of the "box score" approach are
multiplied.
What I would hope is that Messrs. Powell
and Rehnquist will cast their votes in a manner
consistent with their obligation to write
opinions that will with-stand the scrutiny of
their colleagues on the Court and of people
who are competent to judge the caliber of
those opinions. As students of the Court
know, a "vote" is not final until the Justice
involved has agreed to an opinion. There are
many instances in which a Justice has written
an opinion and has changed his vote after
seeing how his colleagues treat his opinion.
I refuse to believe that either of these men
is so much the prisoner of his past that he will
ignore how his colleagues and critics judge his
work. Colleagues and critics include people

whose predispositions run counter to one's
own. It would be a rash justice who would
earn for himself the title of another
Macßeynolds (the worst justice of this
century).
The Supreme Court has influence not
merely for what it does and how it rationalizes
its results, but also by what it does not do and
by how it rationalizes its not-doing. Its
not-doing can be either by an opinion (which
all can evaluate) or by voting not to decide a
given case.
It is in that numerically largest area of the
Court's jurisdiction, where what it does is not
open to public inspection, that those who fear
what Messrs. Powell and Rehnquist will do the
Court ought to have their principal concern.
A vote not to hear a case — what is known
as a vote for a denial of certiorari — may
involve a prediction that one cannot muster a
majority for one's own position. The difficulty
of making that sort of prediction is probably
the best guarantee that we have that votes on
granting or denying certiorari will be made
rationally, because of the importance of
obtaining adherence to a written opinion if the
Court decides to hear the case.
My own hope and expectation is that no
given appointee to the Court will be so
afflicted by tunnel vision that he will vote his
preconceptions and then try to rationalize
them. Unless one believes that irrationality is
the rule of the day, I hope and expect that
Messrs. Powell and Rehnquist will adopt the
discipline that the Court's use of written
opinions imposes on its members.
While that does not mean that I would have
appointed either one of them, I think that the
best achievements of the recent Court will not
be overturned. I also think that the Warren
Court's techniques will not be used to extend
the rights that it developed. In short, stasis
may well become the word to describe the
next period in the Court's history.

whose predispositions run counter to one's
own. It would be a rash justice who would
earn for himself the title of another
Macßeynolds (the worst justice of this
century).
The Supreme Court has influence not
merely for what it does and how it rationalizes
its results, but also by what it does not do and
by how it rationalizes its not-doing. Its
not-doing can be either by an opinion (which
all can evaluate) or by voting not to decide a
given case.
It is in that numerically largest area of the
Court's jurisdiction, where what it does is not
open to public inspection, that those who fear
what Messrs. Powell and Rehnquist will do the
Court ought to have their principal concern.
A vote not to hear a case — what is known
as a vote for a denial of certiorari — may
involve a prediction that one cannot muster a
majority for one's own position. The difficulty
of making that sort of prediction is probably
the best guarantee that we have that votes on
granting or denying certiorari will be made
rationally, because of the importance of
obtaining adherence to a written opinion if the
Court decides to hear the case.
My own hope and expectation is that no
given appointee to the Court will be so
afflicted by tunnel vision that he will vote his
preconceptions and then try to rationalize
them. Unless one believes that irrationality is
the rule of the day, I hope and expect that
Messrs. Powell and Rehnquist will adopt the
discipline that the Court's use of written
opinions imposes on its members.
While that does not mean that I would have
appointed either one of them, I think that the
best achievements of the recent Court will not
be overturned. I also think that the Warren
Court's techniques will not be used to extend
the rights that it developed. In short, stasis
may well become the word to describe the
next period in the Court's history.
(Herbert Packer is a professor of law at
Stanford Law School.)
As we enter the post-Warren era what can
we expect of the Supreme Court? I use the
term "post-Warren era" because nobody
knows what simplistic label will be attached to
this era. It is interesting that we are so
habituated to the label "Warren Court" that
no one pauses to reflect that no one today
talks about the Vinson Court, or the Stone
Court or the Hughes Court. We are so bemused
by contemporary history that we attach undue
importance to what the Supreme Court
decided during Earl Warren's Chief Justiceship.
The major innovations of that era were the
segregation decisions, the reapportionment
cases, and the extension of constitutional
protections to criminal defendants. The
principal techniques of the Court during those
years were (a) the use of the Equal Protection
clause to enforce such substantive rights as the
right not to be discriminated against on the
ground of race and the right to have one's vote
counted equally with those of others; and (b)
the use of the Due Process clause to
incorporate and to develop the guarantees of
the Bill of Rights against the states.
It is certainly appropriate to ask whether
(a) these newly-developed rights will be
maintained and further developed, or
neglected and eroded and (b) these techniques
will continue to be employed.
Assuming that President Nixon's most
recent nominees — Lewis Powell and William
Rehnquist — are confirmed by the Senate, and
that they have a predisposition to question the
rights just mentioned, is it reasonable to
conclude that they will routinely vote for
positions inconsistent with those rights?
Using "box scores" on the Supreme court is
a very dubious enterprise, even assuming that
the votes have already been cast. That can be
shown to be true of Hugo Black and John
Harlan. Black, people tend to forget, came to
the Supreme Court as a populist Senator who
had belonged to the Klu Klux Klan. He then
became an ardent advocate of the view that

free speech is an absolute. Harlan came to the
Court as a conservative lawyer. During his
tenure on the Court he took a very dim view
of Black's position that speech must be
protected at all costs. How, then, would one
have expected Black and Harlan to vote on this
issue:
One, Street, angered by the shooting of
James Meredith while on a peace march in
Mississippi burns an American flag on the
stated ground that "we don't need no flag. . . .
If they let that happen to Meredith we don't
need an American flag." He is convicted of
burning the flag and he argues that his act in
doing so is protected because he was exercising
his right of free speech.
Harlan held in an opinion for the majority
that Street's act was a symbolic form of speech
and was entitled to constitutional protection.
Black, in dissent, argued that "speech is
speech" and what Street was convicted of was
an act.
Examples could be easily multiplied of how
easy it is to confound the simplistic
practitioners of the "box score" technique.
When one tries to predict how the Court or
given members thereof will act in the future,
the perils of the "box score" approach are
multiplied.
What I would hope is that Messrs. Powell
and Rehnquist will cast their votes in a manner
consistent with their obligation to write
opinions that will with-stand the scrutiny of
their colleagues on the Court and of people
who are competent to judge the caliber of
those opinions. As students of the Court
know, a "vote" is not final until the Justice
involved has agreed to an opinion. There are
many instances in which a Justice has written
an opinion and has changed his vote after
seeing how his colleagues treat his opinion.
I refuse to believe that either of these men
is so much the prisoner of his past that he will
ignore how his colleagues and critics judge his
work. Colleagues and critics include people

whose predispositions run counter to one's
own. It would be a rash justice who would
earn for himself the title of another

became an ardent advocate of the view that

free speech is an absolute. Harlan came to the
Court as a conservative lawyer. During his
tenure on the Court he took a very dim view
of Black's position that speech must be
protected at all costs. How, then, would one
have expected Black and Harlan to vote on this
issue:
One, Street, angered by the shooting of
James Meredith while on a peace march in
Mississippi burns an American flag on the
stated ground that "we don't need no flag. . . .
If they let that happen to Meredith we don't
need an American flag." He is convicted of
burning the flag and he argues that his act in
doing so is protected because he was exercising
his right of free speech.
Harlan held in an opinion for the majority
that Street's act was a symbolic form of speech
and was entitled to constitutional protection.
Black, in dissent, argued that "speech is
speech" and what Street was convicted of was
an act.
Examples could be easily multiplied of how
easy it is to confound the simplistic
practitioners of the "box score" technique.
When one tries to predict how the Court or
given members thereof will act in the future,
the perils of the "box score" approach are
multiplied.
What I would hope is that Messrs. Powell
and Rehnquist will cast their votes in a manner
consistent with their obligation to write
opinions that will with-stand the scrutiny of
their colleagues on the Court and of people
who are competent to judge the caliber of
those opinions. As students of the Court
know, a "vote" is not final until the Justice
involved has agreed to an opinion. There are
many instances in which a Justice has written
an opinion and has changed his vote after
seeing how his colleagues treat his opinion.
I refuse to believe that either of these men
is so much the prisoner of his past that he will
ignore how his colleagues and critics judge his
work. Colleagues and critics include people

whose predispositions run counter to one's
own. It would be a rash justice who would
earn for himself the title of another
Macßeynolds (the worst justice of this
century).
The Supreme Court has influence not
merely for what it does and how it rationalizes
its results, but also by what it does not do and
by how it rationalizes its not-doing. Its
not-doing can be either by an opinion (which
all can evaluate) or by voting not to decide a
given case.
It is in that numerically largest area of the
Court's jurisdiction, where what it does is not
open to public inspection, that those who fear
what Messrs. Powell and Rehnquist will do the
Court ought to have their principal concern.
A vote not to hear a case — what is known
as a vote for a denial of certiorari — may
involve a prediction that one cannot muster a
majority for one's own position. The difficulty
of making that sort of prediction is probably
the best guarantee that we have that votes on
granting or denying certiorari will be made
rationally, because of the importance of
obtaining adherence to a written opinion if the
Court decides to hear the case.
My own hope and expectation is that no
given appointee to the Court will be so
afflicted by tunnel vision that he will vote his
preconceptions and then try to rationalize
them. Unless one believes that irrationality is
the rule of the day, I hope and expect that
Messrs. Powell and Rehnquist will adopt the
discipline that the Court's use of written
opinions imposes on its members.
While that does not mean that I would have
appointed either one of them, I think that the
best achievements of the recent Court will not
be overturned. I also think that the Warren
Court's techniques will not be used to extend
the rights that it developed. In short, stasis
may well become the word to describe the
next period in the Court's history.

Stanford Law School.)
As we enter the post-Warren era what can
we expect of the Supreme Court? I use the
term "post-Warren era" because nobody
knows what simplistic label will be attached to
this era. It is interesting that we are so
habituated to the label "Warren Court" that
no one pauses to reflect that no one today
talks about the Vinson Court, or the Stone
Court or the Hughes Court. We are so bemused
by contemporary history that we attach undue
importance to what the Supreme Court
decided during Earl Warren's Chief Justiceship.
The major innovations of that era were the
segregation decisions, the reapportionment
cases, and the extension of constitutional
protections to criminal defendants. The
principal techniques of the Court during those
years were (a) the use of the Equal Protection
clause to enforce such substantive rights as the
right not to be discriminated against on the
ground of race and the right to have one's vote
counted equally with those of others; and (b)
the use of the Due Process clause to
incorporate and to develop the guarantees of
the Bill of Rights against the states.
It is certainly appropriate to ask whether
(a) these newly-developed rights will be
maintained and further developed, or
neglected and eroded and (b) these techniques
will continue to be employed.
Assuming that President Nixon's most
recent nominees — Lewis Powell and William
Rehnquist — are confirmed by the Senate, and
that they have a predisposition to question the
rights just mentioned, is it reasonable to
conclude that they will routinely vote for
positions inconsistent with those rights?
Using "box scores" on the Supreme court is
a very dubious enterprise, even assuming that
the votes have already been cast. That can be
shown to be true of Hugo Black and John
Harlan. Black, people tend to forget, came to
the Supreme Court as a populist Senator who
had belonged to the Klu Klux Klan. He then
became an ardent advocate of the view that

free speech is an absolute. Harlan came to the
