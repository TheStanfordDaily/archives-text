## Supreme Court Justices And Their 'Philosophies' 
### Allan Dershowitz 
In announcing the nominations of Lewis Powell and
William Rehnquist as associate justices of the Supreme Court,
President Nixon declared that he had based his selection on
two criteria: (1) their "excellence" as lawyers and (2) their
"judicial philosophy."
There can be little doubt about what the President meant
by the first criterion, or about the fact that his nominees met
it. Both Mr. Powell and Mr. Rehnquist are well-educated and
successful lawyers who seem intellectually equipped to
compete on what Mr. Nixon characterized as "the fastest
track in the nation."
What the President meant by "judicial philosophy" is far
less clear. "Now I emphasize the word 'judicia', " he said,
and, "by judicial philosophy I don't mean agreeing with the
President on every issue." "A justice," he continued, "should
not bend or twist the Constitution in order to perpetuate his
political and social views."
After assuring his audience that the nominees shared his
judicial philosophy and that they were conservatives ("but
only in a judicial, not a political sense"), the President went
on to give an example of what a conservative judicial
philosophy means to him:
"As a judicial conservative I believe that some Court
decisions have gone too far in the past in weakening the
peace forces as against the criminal forces in our society. The
peace forces must not be denied the legal tools they need to
protect the innocent from criminal elements."
Two critically important phrases occur and recur in the
President's words: "judicial philosophy" and "judicial
conservative." Though their meaning may appear, to a
layman, abundantly clear, Mr. Nixon's usage seems to fly in
the face of traditional legal understanding of just what these
words connote.

Thus, the President's law-and-order attitude is not a
"judicial philosophy." It is just the sort of "personal political
and social view" that the President emphasized should not be
perpetuated by a Supreme Court justice.
A judicial philosophy deals with the role of the Court as
an institution. It is responsive to questions such as: What
precedental weight should be given to prior decisions? What
power should the Court exercise over the other branches of
the Federal Government and over the states? The tools of
judicial construction should it employ in giving meaning to a
constitutional or statutory provision? A judicial philosophy,
if it is truly judicial rather than "political" or "social," does
not speak in terms of giving the peace forces "tools" to
"protect the innocent from criminal elements."
A "conservative" judicial philosophy is one that respects
precedent, and that avoids deciding cases on constitutional
grounds whenever a narrower ground for decision is available.
Most important, a judge with a conservative judicial
philosophy abjures employing the courts to effectuate his
own political or social program—he is a decider of cases
rather than an advocate of causes.
Oliver Wendell Homes described such a judge as one who
has "no thought but that of solving a problem according to
the rules by which he is bound," and who has learned to
transcend his own convictions and to leave room for much
that he would hold dear to be done away with.. . . "In short,
he is a judge who focuses his concern on process rather than
result, and who lets the political chips fall where they may.
This is why it is so difficult to predict how a true judicial
conservative will decide a given issue. For him, so much
depends on how the issue is framed; on what the statute says;
on the prior cases; on whether it arose in a Federal or state

context. Justice Louis Brandeis was a judicial conservative,
though a political liberal. Justice Holmes was a judicial and
political conservative. But the judicial opinions of these
giants tell us little about their individual political (or
economic or social) views; for that we must go to their
extra-judicial writings. Indeed, many people are surprised to
learn how differently these men felt about the social and
political issues of their day, since their judicial opinions were
so similar.
Justice James C. Macßeynolds, the inveterate opponent of
New Deal legislation, represents the other side of the coin. A
political conservative and a judicial activist, he reached out to
strike down statutes that were inconsistent with his political
and economic views.
Mr. Nixon's two previous appointments to the Supreme
Court — Chief Justice Burger and Justice Blackmun — were
also described as having a conservative judicial philosophy.
Yet they have seemed to show no reluctance to overrule
prior decisions or to "perpetuate their own political and
social views," especially on issues of crime and civil liberties.
In the Harris case, for example, Chief Justice Burger wrote
an opinion holding that a defendant who takes the witness
stand in his own behalf can be confronted with an illegally
obtained confession. This opinion significantly undercut the
Court's prior decision in the Miranda case. Many observers
commented that he had decided a critical constitutional
issue that could well have been avoided considering the
record of that case.
In the James case — holding that welfare searches could be
conducted without a warrant — Justice Blackman overruled a
long line of prior decisions, though the Government sought a
decision on a far narrower ground. Thus, in this sense, the
two previous Nixon appointees come closer to reflecting the

judicial activism of Justic Mcßeynolds (complete with his
political conservatism) than the judicial conservatism of
Justices Holmes or Brandeis.
It is too early of course to speculate about the judicial
philosophies of President Nixon's most recent nominees.
Since neither of them has ever served in the judiciary before
or has written about judicial issues, virtually nothing is
known about their views on precedent, judicial restraint, and
the other factors that go into making a true judicial
philosophy.
Mr. Rehnquist did make a speech last year suggesting that
the Court should overrule decisions like Miranda, without
feeling bound by "stare decisis" (former decisions) - a
position which cannot be characterized as judicially
conservative.
Somewhat more is known about law and order: They
favor wire-tapping, increased protection for victims of crime.
(Mr. Rehnquist once wrote an article charging his fellow
Supreme Court law clerks with "extreme solicitude for the
claims of Communists and other criminal defendents,
expansion of Federal power at the expense of state power,
and great sympathy toward any government regualtion of
business." More may be learned about their true judicial
philosophies as the Senate Judiciary Committee considers
their nominations.
