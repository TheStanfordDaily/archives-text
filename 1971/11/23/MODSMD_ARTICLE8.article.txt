Supreme Court, originally appeared in its entirety in the

By WILLIAM H. REHNQUIST
The Supreme Court of the United States is now in the
midst of one of the storms of criticism which have
periodically assailed it. Bills have been introduced in
Congress to limit the jurisdiction of the high court, to
over-rule some of its controversial non-constitutional
decisions, and to declare the sentiment of the Senate as to
the necessity of judicial background on the part of a nominee
to the Court. It has been urged that the "advice" of the
Senate be sought by the President before any nomination to
the Court is made.
Criticism of the Supreme Court can easily become
frustrating to the critics, because the individual justices arc
not accountable in any formal sense to even the strongest
current of public opinion. Nonetheless, it ill behooves the
critics of the present Court to seek imposition of new curbs
on it until such controls as now exist are fully tested and
found wanting. Specifically, until the Senate restores its
practice of thoroughly informing itself on the judicial
philosophy of a Supreme Court nominee before voting to
confirm him, it will have a hard time convincing doubters
that it could make effective use of any additional part in the
selection process.
Dearth of Inquiry
As of this writing, the most recent Supreme Court Justice
to be confirmed by the Senate was Charles Evans Whittaker.
Examination of the Congressional Record for debate relating
to his confirmation reveals a startling dearth of inquiry or
even concern over the views of the new Justice on
constitutional interpretation. . . .
If any interest in the views of Mr. Justice Whittaker on

important cases was manifested by the members of the
Senate, it was done either in the cloakroom or in the meeting
of the Judiciary Committee. The discussion of the new
Justice on the floor of the Senate succeeded in adducing only
the following facts: (a) proceeds from skunk trapping in rural
Kansas assisted him in obtaining his early education; (b) he
was both fair and able in his decisions as a judge of the lower
Federal courts; (c) he was the first Missourian ever appointed
to the Supreme Court; (d) since he had been born in Kansas
but now resided in Missouri his nomination honored two
states.
Given these facts—the Senators could still have no
indication of what Mr. Justice Whittaker thought about the
Supreme Court and segregation or about the Supreme Court
and Communism.
Less than thrity years before, the Senate had made no
bones about its concern with the judicial philosophy of a
Supreme Court nominee.
The labor injunction, the strike as a conspiracy, and the
"yellow-dog" contract were in their heyday. When, in
February, 1930, President Hoover sent to the Senate the
name of Circuit Judge John J. Parker, he sparked one of the
most remarkable battles over a judicial nomination in the
history of the upper chamber.
The most surprising fact about this great debate of 1930
was that none of the protagonists on either side doubted that
the question should be: What were Parker's views on labor
injunctions and yellow-dog contracts? The New York World,
in opposing Parker's confirmation, probably spoke for both
sides when it said editorially on April 23, 1930:
"... The Senate has every right, if it so chooses, to ask the
President to maintain on the Supreme Court bench a balance
between liberal and conservative opinion in the country as a
whole, and every right on this premise to object that the
presence of Judge Parker on the bench would increase, rather
than lessen, the top heavily conservative bias of the Supreme
Court as now constituted."
Opposition
The forces opposing confirmation were led by Senator
William E. Borah of Idaho.

During the debate on Parkers' confirmation, Borah said,
"The Supreme Court of the United States passes upon what
we do. Therefore, it is exceedingly important that we pass
upon them before they decide upon these matters. I say this
in great sincerity. We declare a national policy. They reject it.
I feel I am well justified in inquiring of men on their way to
the Supreme Court something of their views on these
questions." -
Again, during the debate he said:
"Upon some judicial tribunals it is enough, perhaps, that
there be men of integrity and of great learning in the law, but
upon this tribunal something more is needed, something
more is called for, here the widest, broadest, deepest
questions of government and governmental policies are
involved."
Surely the first part of this last quotation epitomizes the
Senate's attitude as manifested in discussion on the floor,
toward the confirmation of Mr. Justice Whittaker. His
integrity, his learning, his success at the bar, would be the
only necessary subjects of inquiry in the case of a judge
appointed to a lower court. He is not there to apply his own
judicial philosophy, willy-nilly, to the litigants before him
but rather to decide the case of those litigants by application
of the principles laid down by higher courts. Such a process
involves the use of the same ability to reason by analogy as
lawyers call on constantly, and therefore the legal ability of
an appointee to a trial court is of paramount importance.
Similarly, in the case of the judge who actually tries the
case, we do not expect a decision between individual litigants
strictly in terms of popular sentiment. The people through
their legislative representatives enact what laws they will,
subject to constitutional limitations. But once a law is
written, neither the" people nor their representatives are
further consulted as to what was meant by it; the written
words, together with relevant background material, are
interpreted by a presumably impartial judge. Democracy
ends at the courthouse door, and Joe Doaks is not to be
imprisoned simply because a majority of the people sitting in
the jury box or on the courthouse steps think he should be.

These reasons suggest that the primary concern with an
appointee to an inferior Federal court should be his ability to
apply rules laid down by more authoritative sources, rather
than his feeling as to whether this material is right or wrong.
But in the case of the Supreme Court, the "something more"
which Borah spoke of comes into play. I would prefer to
interpret this phrase, not as meaning that it takes more
ability to be a Justice of the Supreme Court than a judge of
the lower Federal courts, but rather that there are additional
factors which come into play in the exercise of the function
of a Supreme Court Justice.
The Supreme Court, in interpreting the Constitution, is
the highest authority in the land. Nor is the law of the
Constitution just "there," waiting to be applied in the same
sense that an inferior court may match precedents. There are
those who bemoan the absence of stare decisis in
constitutional law, but of its absence there can be no doubt.
And it is no accident that the provisions of the Constitution
which have been most productive of judicial law-making—the
"due process of law" and "equal protection of the laws"
clauses—are about the vaguest and most general of any in the
instrument. The Court, in Brown v. Board of Education,
supra, held in effect that the framers of the Fourteenth
Amendment left it to the Court to decide what "due
process" and "equal protection" meant. Whehter or not the
framers thought this, it is sufficient for this discussion that
the present Court thinks the framers thought it.
Given this state of things in March, 1957, what could have
been more important to the Senate than Mr. Justice
Whittaker's views on equal protection and due process? It is
high time that those critical of the present Court recognize
with the late Charles Evans Hughes that for one hundred
seventy-five years the Constitution has been what the judges
say it is. If greater judicial self-restraint is desired, or a
different interpretation of the phrases "due process of law"
or "equal protection of the laws," then men sympathetic to
such desires must sit upon the high court. The only way for
the Senate to learn of these sympathies is to "Inquire of men
on their way to the Supreme Court something of their views
on these questions."

By WILLIAM H. REHNQUIST
The Supreme Court of the United States is now in the
midst of one of the storms of criticism which have
periodically assailed it. Bills have been introduced in
Congress to limit the jurisdiction of the high court, to
over-rule some of its controversial non-constitutional
decisions, and to declare the sentiment of the Senate as to
the necessity of judicial background on the part of a nominee
to the Court. It has been urged that the "advice" of the
Senate be sought by the President before any nomination to
the Court is made.
Criticism of the Supreme Court can easily become
frustrating to the critics, because the individual justices arc
not accountable in any formal sense to even the strongest
current of public opinion. Nonetheless, it ill behooves the
critics of the present Court to seek imposition of new curbs
on it until such controls as now exist are fully tested and
found wanting. Specifically, until the Senate restores its
practice of thoroughly informing itself on the judicial
philosophy of a Supreme Court nominee before voting to
confirm him, it will have a hard time convincing doubters
that it could make effective use of any additional part in the
selection process.
Dearth of Inquiry
As of this writing, the most recent Supreme Court Justice
to be confirmed by the Senate was Charles Evans Whittaker.
Examination of the Congressional Record for debate relating
to his confirmation reveals a startling dearth of inquiry or
even concern over the views of the new Justice on
constitutional interpretation. . . .
If any interest in the views of Mr. Justice Whittaker on

important cases was manifested by the members of the
Senate, it was done either in the cloakroom or in the meeting
of the Judiciary Committee. The discussion of the new
Justice on the floor of the Senate succeeded in adducing only
the following facts: (a) proceeds from skunk trapping in rural
Kansas assisted him in obtaining his early education; (b) he
was both fair and able in his decisions as a judge of the lower
Federal courts; (c) he was the first Missourian ever appointed
to the Supreme Court; (d) since he had been born in Kansas
but now resided in Missouri his nomination honored two
states.
Given these facts—the Senators could still have no
indication of what Mr. Justice Whittaker thought about the
Supreme Court and segregation or about the Supreme Court
and Communism.
Less than thrity years before, the Senate had made no
bones about its concern with the judicial philosophy of a
Supreme Court nominee.
The labor injunction, the strike as a conspiracy, and the
"yellow-dog" contract were in their heyday. When, in
February, 1930, President Hoover sent to the Senate the
name of Circuit Judge John J. Parker, he sparked one of the
most remarkable battles over a judicial nomination in the
history of the upper chamber.
The most surprising fact about this great debate of 1930
was that none of the protagonists on either side doubted that
the question should be: What were Parker's views on labor
injunctions and yellow-dog contracts? The New York World,
in opposing Parker's confirmation, probably spoke for both
sides when it said editorially on April 23, 1930:
"... The Senate has every right, if it so chooses, to ask the
President to maintain on the Supreme Court bench a balance
between liberal and conservative opinion in the country as a
whole, and every right on this premise to object that the
presence of Judge Parker on the bench would increase, rather
than lessen, the top heavily conservative bias of the Supreme
Court as now constituted."
Opposition
The forces opposing confirmation were led by Senator
William E. Borah of Idaho.

During the debate on Parkers' confirmation, Borah said,
"The Supreme Court of the United States passes upon what
we do. Therefore, it is exceedingly important that we pass
upon them before they decide upon these matters. I say this
in great sincerity. We declare a national policy. They reject it.
I feel I am well justified in inquiring of men on their way to
the Supreme Court something of their views on these
questions." -
Again, during the debate he said:
"Upon some judicial tribunals it is enough, perhaps, that
there be men of integrity and of great learning in the law, but
upon this tribunal something more is needed, something
more is called for, here the widest, broadest, deepest
questions of government and governmental policies are
involved."
Surely the first part of this last quotation epitomizes the
Senate's attitude as manifested in discussion on the floor,
toward the confirmation of Mr. Justice Whittaker. His
integrity, his learning, his success at the bar, would be the
only necessary subjects of inquiry in the case of a judge
appointed to a lower court. He is not there to apply his own
judicial philosophy, willy-nilly, to the litigants before him
but rather to decide the case of those litigants by application
of the principles laid down by higher courts. Such a process
involves the use of the same ability to reason by analogy as
lawyers call on constantly, and therefore the legal ability of
an appointee to a trial court is of paramount importance.
Similarly, in the case of the judge who actually tries the
case, we do not expect a decision between individual litigants
strictly in terms of popular sentiment. The people through
their legislative representatives enact what laws they will,
subject to constitutional limitations. But once a law is
written, neither the" people nor their representatives are
further consulted as to what was meant by it; the written
words, together with relevant background material, are
interpreted by a presumably impartial judge. Democracy
ends at the courthouse door, and Joe Doaks is not to be
imprisoned simply because a majority of the people sitting in
the jury box or on the courthouse steps think he should be.

These reasons suggest that the primary concern with an
appointee to an inferior Federal court should be his ability to
apply rules laid down by more authoritative sources, rather
than his feeling as to whether this material is right or wrong.
But in the case of the Supreme Court, the "something more"
which Borah spoke of comes into play. I would prefer to
interpret this phrase, not as meaning that it takes more
ability to be a Justice of the Supreme Court than a judge of
the lower Federal courts, but rather that there are additional
factors which come into play in the exercise of the function
of a Supreme Court Justice.
The Supreme Court, in interpreting the Constitution, is
the highest authority in the land. Nor is the law of the
Constitution just "there," waiting to be applied in the same
sense that an inferior court may match precedents. There are
those who bemoan the absence of stare decisis in
constitutional law, but of its absence there can be no doubt.
And it is no accident that the provisions of the Constitution
which have been most productive of judicial law-making—the
"due process of law" and "equal protection of the laws"
clauses—are about the vaguest and most general of any in the
instrument. The Court, in Brown v. Board of Education,
supra, held in effect that the framers of the Fourteenth
Amendment left it to the Court to decide what "due
process" and "equal protection" meant. Whehter or not the
framers thought this, it is sufficient for this discussion that
the present Court thinks the framers thought it.
Given this state of things in March, 1957, what could have
been more important to the Senate than Mr. Justice
Whittaker's views on equal protection and due process? It is
high time that those critical of the present Court recognize
with the late Charles Evans Hughes that for one hundred
seventy-five years the Constitution has been what the judges
say it is. If greater judicial self-restraint is desired, or a
different interpretation of the phrases "due process of law"
or "equal protection of the laws," then men sympathetic to
such desires must sit upon the high court. The only way for
the Senate to learn of these sympathies is to "Inquire of men

By WILLIAM H. REHNQUIST
The Supreme Court of the United States is now in the
midst of one of the storms of criticism which have
periodically assailed it. Bills have been introduced in
Congress to limit the jurisdiction of the high court, to
over-rule some of its controversial non-constitutional
decisions, and to declare the sentiment of the Senate as to
the necessity of judicial background on the part of a nominee
to the Court. It has been urged that the "advice" of the
Senate be sought by the President before any nomination to
the Court is made.
Criticism of the Supreme Court can easily become
frustrating to the critics, because the individual justices arc
not accountable in any formal sense to even the strongest
current of public opinion. Nonetheless, it ill behooves the
critics of the present Court to seek imposition of new curbs
on it until such controls as now exist are fully tested and
found wanting. Specifically, until the Senate restores its
practice of thoroughly informing itself on the judicial
philosophy of a Supreme Court nominee before voting to
confirm him, it will have a hard time convincing doubters
that it could make effective use of any additional part in the
selection process.
Dearth of Inquiry
As of this writing, the most recent Supreme Court Justice
to be confirmed by the Senate was Charles Evans Whittaker.
Examination of the Congressional Record for debate relating
to his confirmation reveals a startling dearth of inquiry or
even concern over the views of the new Justice on
constitutional interpretation. . . .
If any interest in the views of Mr. Justice Whittaker on

important cases was manifested by the members of the
Senate, it was done either in the cloakroom or in the meeting
of the Judiciary Committee. The discussion of the new
Justice on the floor of the Senate succeeded in adducing only
the following facts: (a) proceeds from skunk trapping in rural
Kansas assisted him in obtaining his early education; (b) he
was both fair and able in his decisions as a judge of the lower
Federal courts; (c) he was the first Missourian ever appointed
to the Supreme Court; (d) since he had been born in Kansas
but now resided in Missouri his nomination honored two
states.
Given these facts—the Senators could still have no
indication of what Mr. Justice Whittaker thought about the
Supreme Court and segregation or about the Supreme Court
and Communism.
Less than thrity years before, the Senate had made no
bones about its concern with the judicial philosophy of a
Supreme Court nominee.
The labor injunction, the strike as a conspiracy, and the
"yellow-dog" contract were in their heyday. When, in
February, 1930, President Hoover sent to the Senate the
name of Circuit Judge John J. Parker, he sparked one of the
most remarkable battles over a judicial nomination in the
history of the upper chamber.
The most surprising fact about this great debate of 1930
was that none of the protagonists on either side doubted that
the question should be: What were Parker's views on labor
injunctions and yellow-dog contracts? The New York World,
in opposing Parker's confirmation, probably spoke for both
sides when it said editorially on April 23, 1930:
"... The Senate has every right, if it so chooses, to ask the
President to maintain on the Supreme Court bench a balance
between liberal and conservative opinion in the country as a
whole, and every right on this premise to object that the
presence of Judge Parker on the bench would increase, rather
than lessen, the top heavily conservative bias of the Supreme
Court as now constituted."
Opposition
The forces opposing confirmation were led by Senator
William E. Borah of Idaho.

During the debate on Parkers' confirmation, Borah said,
"The Supreme Court of the United States passes upon what
we do. Therefore, it is exceedingly important that we pass
upon them before they decide upon these matters. I say this
in great sincerity. We declare a national policy. They reject it.
I feel I am well justified in inquiring of men on their way to
the Supreme Court something of their views on these
questions." -
Again, during the debate he said:
"Upon some judicial tribunals it is enough, perhaps, that
there be men of integrity and of great learning in the law, but
upon this tribunal something more is needed, something
more is called for, here the widest, broadest, deepest
questions of government and governmental policies are
involved."
Surely the first part of this last quotation epitomizes the
Senate's attitude as manifested in discussion on the floor,
toward the confirmation of Mr. Justice Whittaker. His
integrity, his learning, his success at the bar, would be the
only necessary subjects of inquiry in the case of a judge
appointed to a lower court. He is not there to apply his own
judicial philosophy, willy-nilly, to the litigants before him
but rather to decide the case of those litigants by application
of the principles laid down by higher courts. Such a process
involves the use of the same ability to reason by analogy as
lawyers call on constantly, and therefore the legal ability of
an appointee to a trial court is of paramount importance.
Similarly, in the case of the judge who actually tries the
case, we do not expect a decision between individual litigants
strictly in terms of popular sentiment. The people through
their legislative representatives enact what laws they will,
subject to constitutional limitations. But once a law is
written, neither the" people nor their representatives are
further consulted as to what was meant by it; the written
words, together with relevant background material, are
interpreted by a presumably impartial judge. Democracy
ends at the courthouse door, and Joe Doaks is not to be
imprisoned simply because a majority of the people sitting in
the jury box or on the courthouse steps think he should be.

These reasons suggest that the primary concern with an
appointee to an inferior Federal court should be his ability to
apply rules laid down by more authoritative sources, rather
than his feeling as to whether this material is right or wrong.
But in the case of the Supreme Court, the "something more"
which Borah spoke of comes into play. I would prefer to
interpret this phrase, not as meaning that it takes more
ability to be a Justice of the Supreme Court than a judge of
the lower Federal courts, but rather that there are additional
factors which come into play in the exercise of the function
of a Supreme Court Justice.
The Supreme Court, in interpreting the Constitution, is
the highest authority in the land. Nor is the law of the
Constitution just "there," waiting to be applied in the same
sense that an inferior court may match precedents. There are
those who bemoan the absence of stare decisis in
constitutional law, but of its absence there can be no doubt.
And it is no accident that the provisions of the Constitution
which have been most productive of judicial law-making—the
"due process of law" and "equal protection of the laws"
clauses—are about the vaguest and most general of any in the
instrument. The Court, in Brown v. Board of Education,
supra, held in effect that the framers of the Fourteenth
Amendment left it to the Court to decide what "due
process" and "equal protection" meant. Whehter or not the
framers thought this, it is sufficient for this discussion that
the present Court thinks the framers thought it.
Given this state of things in March, 1957, what could have
been more important to the Senate than Mr. Justice
Whittaker's views on equal protection and due process? It is
high time that those critical of the present Court recognize
with the late Charles Evans Hughes that for one hundred
seventy-five years the Constitution has been what the judges
say it is. If greater judicial self-restraint is desired, or a
different interpretation of the phrases "due process of law"
or "equal protection of the laws," then men sympathetic to
such desires must sit upon the high court. The only way for
the Senate to learn of these sympathies is to "Inquire of men

different interpretation of the phrases "due process of law"
or "equal protection of the laws," then men sympathetic to
such desires must sit upon the high court. The only way for
the Senate to learn of these sympathies is to "Inquire of men
on their way to the Supreme Court something of their views
on these questions."

By WILLIAM H. REHNQUIST
The Supreme Court of the United States is now in the
midst of one of the storms of criticism which have
periodically assailed it. Bills have been introduced in
Congress to limit the jurisdiction of the high court, to
over-rule some of its controversial non-constitutional
decisions, and to declare the sentiment of the Senate as to
the necessity of judicial background on the part of a nominee
to the Court. It has been urged that the "advice" of the
Senate be sought by the President before any nomination to
the Court is made.
Criticism of the Supreme Court can easily become
frustrating to the critics, because the individual justices arc
not accountable in any formal sense to even the strongest
current of public opinion. Nonetheless, it ill behooves the
critics of the present Court to seek imposition of new curbs
on it until such controls as now exist are fully tested and
found wanting. Specifically, until the Senate restores its
practice of thoroughly informing itself on the judicial
philosophy of a Supreme Court nominee before voting to
confirm him, it will have a hard time convincing doubters
that it could make effective use of any additional part in the
selection process.
Dearth of Inquiry
As of this writing, the most recent Supreme Court Justice
to be confirmed by the Senate was Charles Evans Whittaker.
Examination of the Congressional Record for debate relating
to his confirmation reveals a startling dearth of inquiry or
even concern over the views of the new Justice on
constitutional interpretation. . . .
If any interest in the views of Mr. Justice Whittaker on

important cases was manifested by the members of the
Senate, it was done either in the cloakroom or in the meeting
of the Judiciary Committee. The discussion of the new
Justice on the floor of the Senate succeeded in adducing only
the following facts: (a) proceeds from skunk trapping in rural
Kansas assisted him in obtaining his early education; (b) he
was both fair and able in his decisions as a judge of the lower
Federal courts; (c) he was the first Missourian ever appointed
to the Supreme Court; (d) since he had been born in Kansas
but now resided in Missouri his nomination honored two
states.
Given these facts—the Senators could still have no
indication of what Mr. Justice Whittaker thought about the
Supreme Court and segregation or about the Supreme Court
and Communism.
Less than thrity years before, the Senate had made no
bones about its concern with the judicial philosophy of a
Supreme Court nominee.
The labor injunction, the strike as a conspiracy, and the
"yellow-dog" contract were in their heyday. When, in
February, 1930, President Hoover sent to the Senate the
name of Circuit Judge John J. Parker, he sparked one of the
most remarkable battles over a judicial nomination in the
history of the upper chamber.
The most surprising fact about this great debate of 1930
was that none of the protagonists on either side doubted that
the question should be: What were Parker's views on labor
injunctions and yellow-dog contracts? The New York World,
in opposing Parker's confirmation, probably spoke for both
sides when it said editorially on April 23, 1930:
"... The Senate has every right, if it so chooses, to ask the
President to maintain on the Supreme Court bench a balance
between liberal and conservative opinion in the country as a
whole, and every right on this premise to object that the
presence of Judge Parker on the bench would increase, rather
than lessen, the top heavily conservative bias of the Supreme
Court as now constituted."
Opposition
The forces opposing confirmation were led by Senator
William E. Borah of Idaho.

During the debate on Parkers' confirmation, Borah said,
"The Supreme Court of the United States passes upon what
we do. Therefore, it is exceedingly important that we pass
upon them before they decide upon these matters. I say this
in great sincerity. We declare a national policy. They reject it.
I feel I am well justified in inquiring of men on their way to
the Supreme Court something of their views on these
questions." -
Again, during the debate he said:
"Upon some judicial tribunals it is enough, perhaps, that
there be men of integrity and of great learning in the law, but
upon this tribunal something more is needed, something
more is called for, here the widest, broadest, deepest
questions of government and governmental policies are
involved."
Surely the first part of this last quotation epitomizes the
Senate's attitude as manifested in discussion on the floor,
toward the confirmation of Mr. Justice Whittaker. His
integrity, his learning, his success at the bar, would be the
only necessary subjects of inquiry in the case of a judge
appointed to a lower court. He is not there to apply his own
judicial philosophy, willy-nilly, to the litigants before him
but rather to decide the case of those litigants by application
of the principles laid down by higher courts. Such a process
involves the use of the same ability to reason by analogy as
lawyers call on constantly, and therefore the legal ability of
an appointee to a trial court is of paramount importance.
Similarly, in the case of the judge who actually tries the
case, we do not expect a decision between individual litigants
strictly in terms of popular sentiment. The people through
their legislative representatives enact what laws they will,
subject to constitutional limitations. But once a law is
written, neither the" people nor their representatives are
further consulted as to what was meant by it; the written
words, together with relevant background material, are
interpreted by a presumably impartial judge. Democracy
ends at the courthouse door, and Joe Doaks is not to be
imprisoned simply because a majority of the people sitting in
the jury box or on the courthouse steps think he should be.

These reasons suggest that the primary concern with an
appointee to an inferior Federal court should be his ability to
apply rules laid down by more authoritative sources, rather
than his feeling as to whether this material is right or wrong.
But in the case of the Supreme Court, the "something more"
which Borah spoke of comes into play. I would prefer to
interpret this phrase, not as meaning that it takes more
ability to be a Justice of the Supreme Court than a judge of
the lower Federal courts, but rather that there are additional
factors which come into play in the exercise of the function
of a Supreme Court Justice.
The Supreme Court, in interpreting the Constitution, is
the highest authority in the land. Nor is the law of the
Constitution just "there," waiting to be applied in the same
sense that an inferior court may match precedents. There are
those who bemoan the absence of stare decisis in
constitutional law, but of its absence there can be no doubt.
And it is no accident that the provisions of the Constitution
which have been most productive of judicial law-making—the
"due process of law" and "equal protection of the laws"
clauses—are about the vaguest and most general of any in the
instrument. The Court, in Brown v. Board of Education,
supra, held in effect that the framers of the Fourteenth
Amendment left it to the Court to decide what "due
process" and "equal protection" meant. Whehter or not the
framers thought this, it is sufficient for this discussion that
the present Court thinks the framers thought it.
Given this state of things in March, 1957, what could have
been more important to the Senate than Mr. Justice
Whittaker's views on equal protection and due process? It is
high time that those critical of the present Court recognize
with the late Charles Evans Hughes that for one hundred
seventy-five years the Constitution has been what the judges
say it is. If greater judicial self-restraint is desired, or a
different interpretation of the phrases "due process of law"
or "equal protection of the laws," then men sympathetic to
such desires must sit upon the high court. The only way for
the Senate to learn of these sympathies is to "Inquire of men
