Rolling Along
Editor, THE DAILY:
The grievance procedure just keeps rolling along.
Despite the fact that not one employee organization
favors the new procedure, which is supposed to
benefit the employee, President Lyman has just
appointed his own board of arbitors from a list
compiled by a selection panel which has had no
contact with workers. Workers don't pick the panel.
Workers don't pick the list of arbitors. Workers
can't initiate the grievance procedure against the
administration without administration permission.
Seem like a stacked deck? Workers are even
considered guilty until proven innocent, and the
administration retains the right to refuse any worker
the chance to prove him or herself innocent in front
of the administration's own hand-picked arbitor.
And so our grievance procedure becomes a more
and more permanent fixture of employer/employee
relations.
The only place workers find themselves in
agreement with the administration is when it chides
workers for not having an effective union with
which the administration can deal. Until we do have
a union which represents all workers at Stanford,
the administration will continue to operate in its
high-handed and arbitrary manner.

McCloskey Response
Editor, THE DAILY:
The author of the article in Friday's Daily
entitled "The Real Pete McCloskey" apparently
went through my voting record in search of any
items that would appear to contradict any "liberal
image." In doing so, he not only failed to present a
balanced picture, but he also knowingly or
unknowingly misinterpreted or misrepresented
several of my votes.
In regard to the House Internal Security
Committee, for example, I have supported

Congressman Waldie's legislation to seal the
Committee's files and place its legitimate security
operations with the Judiciary Committee, which has
proper jurisdiction. I was bothered by the no-knock
and preventive detention provisions of the 1970
District of Columbia Crime Bill, but voted for the
whole bill in the belief that, on balance, it would
help fight crime.
The 1969 bill on demonstrations in Washington
D.C. did not limit at all the Constitutional right to
demonstrate. It simply prohibited overnight
camping and required the posting of a bond prior to
potentially destructive activities. This was in
response to the $2,000,000 costs of cleaning up
after Resurrection City.
Many of the votes cited in the areas of health,
nutrition, housing and education were actually votes
on amendments or procedural matter, and do not
reflet my basic positions. For instance, I have
voted to sustain and expand the food stamp
program. On some occasions I have opposed
appropriation increases in the belief that we must
hold down the size of the budget in order to
discourage inflation.
As did most of the anti-war members of the
House, I voted in November, 1969 to commend the
President's intention to bring an end to the war in
Vietnam. Insofar as President Nixon takes action to
bring peace, I support him. This is not inconsistent
with my repeated efforts over the years to persuade
Presidents Johnson and Nixon to move more
quickly and decisively to end our involvement in
Indochina.
Finally, I do not deny my differences with
Former Congressmen Cohelan and Brown and
now-Senator Tunney. I am not a Democrat. I am a
Republican who believes that the present
Administration's policies on Vietnam, truth in
government and civil rights must be changed. These
are the main issues on which I base my candidacy.

The ROTC Vote
Editor, THE DAILY:
Though many opponents of military recruiting on campus have
made the mistake of considering such policy to be the domain only of
people fortunate (?) enough to be members of the Stanford
community, Ray White does them a disservice by raising the Spring,
1970 referendum on ROTC. According to White's letter, "The
majority voting wanted ROTC on campus without credit."
Comparison of the following statistics (reprinted from the Mann
Committee's report to the Academic Council) with Stanford's current
plans for ROTC should shed some light on the subject. Whether or not
the Department of Defense will try to set up a voluntary students
organization (maybe FCMROTC), as suggested by 32% of those voting
is an open question, depending, of course, on how long they are able
to maintain ROTC credit courses.
