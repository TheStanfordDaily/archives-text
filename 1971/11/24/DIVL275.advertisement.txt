The Smaller Advent
Loudspeaker
a small, moderately-priced speaker
system of unique performance. Its effective frequency
bandwidth is exactly the same as the original Advent
Loudspeaker's, and it sounds as close to it in overall
character, octave for octave, as any loudspeaker model
can to another.
On all kinds of musical material, and under most
listening conditions likely to apply in most homes, it is
the equal of any speaker system available.
