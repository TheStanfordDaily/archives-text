# Report Cites Dangers Of Pesticide Use, Recommends Restrictions On Campus
## 
### GARY CLARK 
Campus ecologists are halfway home in scoring a
victory over the use of pesticides in the Stanford
community.
A report from the University Ombudswoman's
office calls for a radically reduced use of pesticides in
both amount and toxicity. President Lyman has
passed the report's recommendations to the heads of
University services currently using the pesticides.
The report criticizes the lack of co-ordination
between those who use and apply the pesticides and
sources knowledgeable about the effects of those
pesticides. At present, the Physical Plant, Escondido
Village, and the Athletic Department run their own
separate ground maintenance programs.
Ombudswoman Lois Amsterdam took the initiative
to issue the report because "the complaints cannot be
resolved by a simple channeling to appropriate
persons . . . there are university-wide concerns, and
decision-making on biocides is scattered." The various
departments concerned have received copies of the
report and are considering its contents for possible
action.
Three Recommendations
There are three central recommendations in the
report. The primary subject is the use of the
extremely potent pesticide "1080" which Amsterdam

criticizes as a "telling example of the lack of
coordination and expert input."
The poison 1080 is so potent that it is not available
for commercial use and must be applied by the
county Department of Agriculture. The poison was
developed primarily for use in agricultural areas and
the report questions its use in a recreational
environment. At Stanford, corn "bait" carrying 1080
is used on the golf course to control ground squirrels.
1080 is colorless, odorless, and will not break
down easily. It attacks the central nervous system,
causing convulsions and eventual death. It is deadly
to all mammals, especially canines, and has no known
antidote.
It is believed that 1080 is already responsible for
the deaths of two dogs belonging to residents
neighboring the golf course. Although no tests were
run, the symptoms displayed by the dogs before
death suggest possible 1080 poisoning.
Amsterdam expressed concern that the use of
poisoned bait will endanger children playing in the
vicinity and may effect legally protected species of
birds and tree squirrels.
Secondary Poisoning
In addition, the poison's stability raises the threat
of secondary poisoning. A dog eating the carcass of a
poisoned ground squirrel could be killed by the
residual poison.

Included in the report is a clarification by the
county Department of Agriculture of 1080 use at
Stanford. The Department says only minimum levels
of toxicity concentration are used and that care is
taken to protect "non-target" species.
It further contends that poisoned bait use is
localized to areas adjacent to rodent dens and that
the secondary poisoning threat is reduced since most
of the animals die in their burrows.
The report's second recommendation incorporates
suggestions by biology Professor Donald Kennedy in
relation to the use of specific biocides in the
Escondido Village area. He recommends that
chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides be banned,
claiming "they have no unique value for any campus
use, and present a substantial (though not necessarily
local) environmental hazard."
The final recommendation urges that the practice
of preventative spraying, done around most dorms on
a monthly basis, be suspended. Spraying should occur
only when a specific pest problem arises.
To correct the problem of coordination of
pesticide use and environmental concerns, the report
urges the creation of a Stanford Environmental
Protection Committee.
This committee, formed of professors and others
knowledgeable about the effects of pesticides, would
work with the diverse source responsible for pesticide
use on campus.

MEET THE PRESS—President Richard Lyman (second from left at table) answers questions from campus newsmen during
KZSU news conference last night after his announcement of the interim judicial system for students.
Campus ecologists are halfway home in scoring a
victory over the use of pesticides in the Stanford
community.
A report from the University Ombudswoman's
office calls for a radically reduced use of pesticides in
both amount and toxicity. President Lyman has
passed the report's recommendations to the heads of
University services currently using the pesticides.
The report criticizes the lack of co-ordination
between those who use and apply the pesticides and
sources knowledgeable about the effects of those
pesticides. At present, the Physical Plant, Escondido
Village, and the Athletic Department run their own
separate ground maintenance programs.
Ombudswoman Lois Amsterdam took the initiative
to issue the report because "the complaints cannot be
resolved by a simple channeling to appropriate
persons . . . there are university-wide concerns, and
decision-making on biocides is scattered." The various
departments concerned have received copies of the
report and are considering its contents for possible
action.
Three Recommendations
There are three central recommendations in the
report. The primary subject is the use of the
extremely potent pesticide "1080" which Amsterdam

criticizes as a "telling example of the lack of
coordination and expert input."
The poison 1080 is so potent that it is not available
for commercial use and must be applied by the
county Department of Agriculture. The poison was
developed primarily for use in agricultural areas and
the report questions its use in a recreational
environment. At Stanford, corn "bait" carrying 1080
is used on the golf course to control ground squirrels.
1080 is colorless, odorless, and will not break
down easily. It attacks the central nervous system,
causing convulsions and eventual death. It is deadly
to all mammals, especially canines, and has no known
antidote.
It is believed that 1080 is already responsible for
the deaths of two dogs belonging to residents
neighboring the golf course. Although no tests were
run, the symptoms displayed by the dogs before
death suggest possible 1080 poisoning.
Amsterdam expressed concern that the use of
poisoned bait will endanger children playing in the
vicinity and may effect legally protected species of
birds and tree squirrels.
Secondary Poisoning
In addition, the poison's stability raises the threat
of secondary poisoning. A dog eating the carcass of a
poisoned ground squirrel could be killed by the
residual poison.

Included in the report is a clarification by the
county Department of Agriculture of 1080 use at
Stanford. The Department says only minimum levels
of toxicity concentration are used and that care is
taken to protect "non-target" species.
It further contends that poisoned bait use is
localized to areas adjacent to rodent dens and that
the secondary poisoning threat is reduced since most
of the animals die in their burrows.
The report's second recommendation incorporates
suggestions by biology Professor Donald Kennedy in
relation to the use of specific biocides in the
Escondido Village area. He recommends that
chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides be banned,
claiming "they have no unique value for any campus
use, and present a substantial (though not necessarily
local) environmental hazard."
The final recommendation urges that the practice
of preventative spraying, done around most dorms on
a monthly basis, be suspended. Spraying should occur
only when a specific pest problem arises.
To correct the problem of coordination of
pesticide use and environmental concerns, the report
urges the creation of a Stanford Environmental
Protection Committee.
This committee, formed of professors and others
knowledgeable about the effects of pesticides, would
work with the diverse source responsible for pesticide
use on campus.
