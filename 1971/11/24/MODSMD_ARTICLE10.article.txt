# peace, happiness, and alpha waves
## Transcendental Meditation And I 
###

A few weeks back I went to a
lecture on Transcendental
Meditation at Stanford. From the
flyer, distributed to the different
departments, it sounded more like
a lecture on creative art. The
expression Transcendental
Meditation was not mentioned in
it. When I got to the lecture hall,
however, I found all this literature
which I did not understand too
well. It was about oxygen
consumption, and skin resistance,
and alpha waves. At first I

thought I was in the wrong room.
But then the speaker arrived.
He told us in somewhat simpler
words about oxygen
consumption, and skin resistance,
about creativity, and alpha waves.
It was about an art? science?
religion? philosophy? lost 5000
years ago in India, rediscovered
and now spreading fast all over
this World. It sounded like a pease
message.
I thought if everybody
participated we would be so

happy and fulfilled, there would
not be any time for war even. I
began to understand what it was.
It is a modern version of Yoga,
teaching you how to reach the
subconscious.
I still did not know what alpha
waves were, but I did not want to
ask. Everybody else seemed to be
much better informed that I.
After all, 1 had come to the
lecture more or less by accident.
But I certainly wanted to find out
about my subconscious. I thought
of all the subjects I had studied

and forgotten which were stacked
away somewhere now, waiting to
come up to the surface.
I went to the second lecture. It
was going to tell us how it is done.
However, since a large part of the
audience had missed the first
lecture, the speaker spent most of
his time repeating what he had
said the first time. Towards the
end there was something about a
sound that is used to relax the
student and help him get into this
state of meditation, which is
called I believe the Fourth State
of Consciousness.
I was eager to improve my
potentials. I signed up for the
private appointment. It was to be
Saturday morning at the
downstairs history comer at
Stanford at 10 o'clock. I was
there with my bunch of fresh
flowers, a new white hankerchief
which I had specially purchased, a
couple of apples, and a check for
$75.00 which is the donation
requested from the working class
by SIMS. (Students pay $35.00).
I was ten minutes early and all
excited. This could be the turning
point of my life. After I had tried
all the doors of the history corner,
upstairs and downstairs and found
them all locked I stood and
waited.
I watched the people go by. It

was Big Game weekend. Parents
were visiting. Students, freshly
scrubbed, were showing them
around.
I stood there with my paper
sack holding the flowers, the
apples, and the new white
hankerchief, feeling less and less
excited, and more and more mad,
and somewhat let down.
I should have accepted that
invitation for a ride to Monterey.
It was such a beautiful day. I had
declined, telling my friend I had
made an appointment to find my
subconscious. Even my flowers
looked sad after one hours
waiting. Their leaves drooped.
Flowers have feelings too, you
know.
Finally, I went home. I called
the SIMS number given to me
when I made the appointment.
But nobody answered all day
Saturday. I did not try Sunday.
Everybody was most probably
meditating. They did not want to
be disturbed. Nobody answered
on Monday either when I called.
May be they had fulfilled their
quota and left town. I certainly
had tried.

and forgotten which were stacked
away somewhere now, waiting to
come up to the surface.
I went to the second lecture. It
was going to tell us how it is done.
However, since a large part of the
audience had missed the first
lecture, the speaker spent most of
his time repeating what he had
said the first time. Towards the
end there was something about a
sound that is used to relax the
student and help him get into this
state of meditation, which is
called I believe the Fourth State
of Consciousness.
I was eager to improve my
potentials. I signed up for the
private appointment. It was to be
Saturday morning at the
downstairs history comer at
Stanford at 10 o'clock. I was
there with my bunch of fresh
flowers, a new white hankerchief
which I had specially purchased, a
couple of apples, and a check for
$75.00 which is the donation
requested from the working class
by SIMS. (Students pay $35.00).
I was ten minutes early and all
excited. This could be the turning
point of my life. After I had tried
all the doors of the history corner,
upstairs and downstairs and found
them all locked I stood and
waited.
I watched the people go by. It

was Big Game weekend. Parents
were visiting. Students, freshly
scrubbed, were showing them
around.
I stood there with my paper
sack holding the flowers, the
apples, and the new white
hankerchief, feeling less and less
excited, and more and more mad,
and somewhat let down.
I should have accepted that
invitation for a ride to Monterey.
It was such a beautiful day. I had
declined, telling my friend I had
made an appointment to find my
subconscious. Even my flowers
looked sad after one hours
waiting. Their leaves drooped.
Flowers have feelings too, you
know.
Finally, I went home. I called
the SIMS number given to me
when I made the appointment.
But nobody answered all day
Saturday. I did not try Sunday.
Everybody was most probably
meditating. They did not want to
be disturbed. Nobody answered
on Monday either when I called.
May be they had fulfilled their
quota and left town. I certainly
had tried.

A few weeks back I went to a
lecture on Transcendental
Meditation at Stanford. From the
flyer, distributed to the different
departments, it sounded more like
a lecture on creative art. The
expression Transcendental
Meditation was not mentioned in
it. When I got to the lecture hall,
however, I found all this literature
which I did not understand too
well. It was about oxygen
consumption, and skin resistance,
and alpha waves. At first I

thought I was in the wrong room.
But then the speaker arrived.
He told us in somewhat simpler
words about oxygen
consumption, and skin resistance,
about creativity, and alpha waves.
It was about an art? science?
religion? philosophy? lost 5000
years ago in India, rediscovered
and now spreading fast all over
this World. It sounded like a pease
message.
I thought if everybody
participated we would be so

happy and fulfilled, there would
not be any time for war even. I
began to understand what it was.
It is a modern version of Yoga,
teaching you how to reach the
subconscious.
I still did not know what alpha
waves were, but I did not want to
ask. Everybody else seemed to be
much better informed that I.
After all, 1 had come to the
lecture more or less by accident.
But I certainly wanted to find out
about my subconscious. I thought
of all the subjects I had studied

and forgotten which were stacked
away somewhere now, waiting to
come up to the surface.
