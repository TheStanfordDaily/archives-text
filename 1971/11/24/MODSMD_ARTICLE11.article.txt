Women And Physics
Editor, THE DAILY:
I was dismayed to read in the November 17
Stanford Daily Ann Kimball reported that in her
freshman dorm a "few girls who wanted to go into
physics and engineering" "met a lot of resistance"
(by whom?).
Miss Kimball and her friends may be intersted in
the following letter that the Department of Physics
is mailing to graduate applicants (the same intent
applies to undergraduates):
"The Department of Physics welcomes women
applicants to its graduate program. Contrary to a
popular opinion, we feel that physics as a career is
an appropriate field for women as well as men. In
the past, women have contributed to the advances
in physics. We are afraid that some women do not
apply to our graduate program because they expect
to encounter discrimination because of sex. The
purpose of this note is to assure you that our
department is committed to providing equal
opportunities at all levels for both men and women.
W.E. Meyerhof, Chairman
Physics Department

From The Placement Center Staff
Editor, THE DAILY:
The undersigned members of the staff of the
Career Planning and Placement Center would like,
by means of this letter to the Editor of the Stanford
Daily, to express our appreciation to the 1,912
students currently registered for service for their
patience and understanding during the current
period of disruption.
We especially appreciate the expressions of
understanding of the many students who have lost
employment opportunities for part-time and other
immediate need type jobs. Equally, of course, we
appreciate the similar understanding expressed by
those whose applications for permanent positions
have been delayed.
We also want to express our regret to all those
registered for our service that we have not been able
to serve you in other ways in the manner which you
and we alike have come to expect.
We believe that President Lyman is doing
everything possible to resolve the issues involved.
We hope that you will join us in supporting his
efforts to return our service to its normal state at
the earliest possible moment.
