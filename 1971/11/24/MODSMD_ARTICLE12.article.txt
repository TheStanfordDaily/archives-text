## Open Letter To The Silent Majority 
### 
Sidney slomich

Here is a story, my friends.
One night a man dreamt that a
monster was on his chest, choking
him, trying to kill him. The man
woke up in terror and saw the
monster above him. "What is
going to happen to me," the man
cried. "Don't ask me," replied the
monster, "it's your dream."
Take your society, your law's
integrity, and your country back
from the experts. I have been an
"expert" and I can tell you that
experts gone wild — and they have
— are like cancer. They know only
one thing: more, more, more of
the same. Nothing is more expert
than cancer, nothing a better
example of power without
purpose. Cancer is ignorant, but,
oh, it works, it grows.
I have been an expert, have
lived among them in their
anti-communities — could have
rested among them. I hope I have
left them well behind me. An
expert sees his small piece of
reality and little else. He confuses
understanding with control and
makes of the latter his single
virtue. One of our leading social
scientists has said that the chief
accomplishment of this age is to
have changed so many political
problems into technical ones. We
see in Vietnam, as at Auschwitz,
the result of technical solutions to
political problems.
So I have been an expert, and
I'm not bragging about it. I
accepted the necessity of working
within the system, believed that it
was possible in that way both to
affect the system itself
constructively and to accomplish
something. Only in the late sixties
did I come to understand that
government, business, and what is
correctly called "the
Establishment," were too inert,
too committed to the shape of
things as they have been to
inaugurate human policies, that
for change the people had to take
government back to themselves.
Only the people awakened and
grasping for power from these
mindless megainstitutions, can
effect change.
In 1964 I sat in disbelieve in a
Washington think tank, listening
to a very well-financed Army
proposal to develop a
computerized electronic warning
system to alert the Pentagon when
a Latin American country was
likely to go "red," and — the
system having been perfected on
paper — to rent a whole Latin
American coountry and army to
test it out. This stupid and
unbelievably naive project was the
product of Ph.D.'s, men who call
themselves and are called the
scientists. When this project was
discovered by Chileans who
observed some strangely behaving
researchers, it hit the press and
was investigated by Congress.
When, from the beginning, I
criticized Project Camelot, I was

asked, annoyedly, why I was
always being so "negative." This is
a particularly apt, yet typical,
example of the allegedly scientific
thinking that likes behind
Vietnam and all the horrors it has
brought to roost in this country
and all over the world.
I could give many more
examples, but I don't want to
take up time with horror stories.
Suffice it to say that over the last
generation, especially the last
fifteen years, the United States —
at home and abroad — has been
preoccupied not with human life
and its purposes, but with
ignorant power and control — that
is to say with death — and has
become, along with the Soviet
Union, as a colleague in mindless
adversity, the planet's greatest
polluter, an agent of potentially
total repression, and the greatest
threat to continued human life
the world has ever faced. I do not
like to say these things, but one
must speak plainly. There is a
monster on our chest.
But it is our dream, and what
happens next is up to us, to no
one else. I can speak so plainly
because I think this nation can
throw the monster off its chest.
The hope of this nation, that
of any nation, is its people. You
are that hope. The entire system
of expertise and secrecy designed
to prevent the people of this
country from determining their
own destinies is basically a fake.
Over the last twenty years I have
had a continuous Top Secret
clearances from the Army, State,

CIA, Defense, ACDA —
sometimes from more than one. I
never learned one thing of value.
Everything valuable that I have
learned, known, said, perceived,
or written has come from an
open, scholarly unclassified source
or from newspapers, journals, or
my own obserations. All these
sources are open to you.
There is no silent majority.
Man is a speaking animal. There is
only a silenced majority, a
repressed, clamped-down, and
frightened majority. You. You
have been frightened and you
have been silenced.
Look, these war rooms paneled
in walnut, those massive files,
those contracts for millions of
dollars worth of death and
death-research, those fancy desks
and chairs, all the paraphernalia of
power, bases, buildings, bombs,
and all the rest, they are all yours.
They belong to you. Take them
back, make a human use of them,
make this your society, as it is
your life, Everything you do,
everything you can do, to please
yourself and build your life is
more beautiful and more real than
the fakery, abstraction, obsession,
and desire for death that rules this
country today. That's the only
secret worth knowing. Once you
know it you can take back this
nation — with difficulty.
Once you know it you will.
And then we'll speak not of the
American Nightmare, but the
American Dream.

American Nightmare, has done
research for the Army on
Czechoslovakia, spent a number
of years as an officer of the CIA,
and has worked on strategic
problems — including Vietnam —
in Army think tanks, among them
the Research Analysis
Corporation. Slomich was senior
scientist and then Director of the
Arms Control and Disarmament
Study Group at Cal Tech's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory, immersed
in studies for NASA and ACDA

on vital inspection and
proliferation issues. He has also
studied educational policy and
counseled foreign governments in
urban affairs for the Stanford
Research Institute. For 16 years,
Slomich worked exclusively
within the established foreign
policy and governmental system,
in public and private
organizations, usually in
circumstances involving heavy or
nearly exclusive use of classified,
secret materials.)
