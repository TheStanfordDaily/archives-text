# Ominous Television Policy Proposal
## 
### DAN BRENNER Commentary 
I imagine that one thing the Nixon
administration will be remembered for is
its appointments: Carswell to the Supreme
Court; Butz to the Agricultural
Department; and Clay "Tom" Whitehead
to the newly-created Office of
Telecommunication Policy.
As broadcasting trouble-shooter for the
White House, Whitehead presented to the
National Association of Broadcasters a
month ago a novel—and ominous—proposal
that would drastically alter the shape of
television broadcasting in America.
The major premise of the Whitehead
doctrine is that the "Fairness
Doctrine"—the statutory provision that
confirms the public's right to be
informed—be scrapped. He would replace
the giant procedural void that would result
with new standards for granting
broadcasters their license to do business in
a community.
Radical Proposals
Whitehead's radical proposals stem from
a growing interest in the business of
broadcasters which has resulted in a

reconsideration of the whole fairness issue
by both government and industry.
Network broadcasters are presently
besieged by both the public and the
government for irresponsibility. Ever since
Vice President Spiro Agnew made the
now-famous Des Moines speech about
network news bias, there has been a
non-stop assault on the TV news bosses.
The latest indictment of network
objectivity comes from long-time TV critic
Edith Efron in her new book, The News
Twisters. Using her own statistical
methodology, the TV Guide columnist
counts up the number of biased remarks
made by newsmen in the 1968 election
coverage and concludes that network
figures run into the red when it comes to
objectivity.
And the public—from the Citizen's
Communication Council in Washington to
the United Church of Christ in San
Francisco—have been hounding the
broadcasters for more open access, greater
say in programming, and more minority
interest programming.
"Fairness Doctrine"
Against this background of public and

private harassment, the Whitehead
statement has sent network bosses jumping
for economic joy. For it is the "Fairness
Doctrine"—established by Congress in
1934 and re-interpreted to its present use
in 1949—that has served as the critics' foot
,in the door.
Simply stated, the "Fairness Doctrine,"
by insuring the public's right to know,
forces a broadcaster to provide equal time
to responsible, opposing viewpoints on any
subject that is aired on his station. It also
encourages the broadcaster to seek out and
air controversial issues to better serve the
public "interest, convenience and
necessity."
What Whitehead and presumably Mr.
Nixon would like, is to junk this
admittedly tedious and difficult procedure
for a more lax and unspecific review
procedure when a broadcaster's license
comes up for review every three years.
Balanced Programming
The Federal Communications
Commission, which is the regulatory
administrator for the broadcasting
industry, would adjudge each licensee to
make sure that he had presented a balanced

three years of overall programming and
would not consider the question of balance
on an issue-by-issue basis.
There are other elements of Whitehead's
doctrine, some of which are more
moderate and indeed address some of the
major problems facing TV today.
For example, Whitehead suggests that
radio stations be "deregulated" and be
subject to different broadcasting
responsibilities than TV stations. He also
urges that stations be required to accept all
legal commercial advertising, regardless of
controversial content. This position has
been voiced from the conservative Taiwan
lobby, Committee of One Million to the
activist F.C.C. Commissioner, Nicholas
Johnson.
But on the matter of the "Fairness
Doctrine," Whitehead's proposal to
eliminate this complicated apparatus which
tries to insure a fair and balanced
treatment of issues is simplistic. What's
more, considering the potential for
exploitation of his suggestion, it could be a
dangerous excursion in laissez-faire politics
that might result in an unregulated,
overbearing medium.

Communication Council in Washington to
the United Church of Christ in San
Francisco—have been hounding the
broadcasters for more open access, greater
say in programming, and more minority
interest programming.
"Fairness Doctrine"
Against this background of public and

private harassment, the Whitehead
statement has sent network bosses jumping
for economic joy. For it is the "Fairness
Doctrine"—established by Congress in
1934 and re-interpreted to its present use
in 1949—that has served as the critics' foot
,in the door.
Simply stated, the "Fairness Doctrine,"
by insuring the public's right to know,
forces a broadcaster to provide equal time
to responsible, opposing viewpoints on any
subject that is aired on his station. It also
encourages the broadcaster to seek out and
air controversial issues to better serve the
public "interest, convenience and
necessity."
What Whitehead and presumably Mr.
Nixon would like, is to junk this
admittedly tedious and difficult procedure
for a more lax and unspecific review
procedure when a broadcaster's license
comes up for review every three years.
Balanced Programming
The Federal Communications
Commission, which is the regulatory
administrator for the broadcasting
industry, would adjudge each licensee to
make sure that he had presented a balanced

three years of overall programming and
would not consider the question of balance
on an issue-by-issue basis.
There are other elements of Whitehead's
doctrine, some of which are more
moderate and indeed address some of the
major problems facing TV today.
For example, Whitehead suggests that
radio stations be "deregulated" and be
subject to different broadcasting
responsibilities than TV stations. He also
urges that stations be required to accept all
legal commercial advertising, regardless of
controversial content. This position has
been voiced from the conservative Taiwan
lobby, Committee of One Million to the
activist F.C.C. Commissioner, Nicholas
Johnson.
But on the matter of the "Fairness
Doctrine," Whitehead's proposal to
eliminate this complicated apparatus which
tries to insure a fair and balanced
treatment of issues is simplistic. What's
more, considering the potential for
exploitation of his suggestion, it could be a
dangerous excursion in laissez-faire politics
that might result in an unregulated,
overbearing medium.
I imagine that one thing the Nixon
administration will be remembered for is
its appointments: Carswell to the Supreme
Court; Butz to the Agricultural
Department; and Clay "Tom" Whitehead
to the newly-created Office of
Telecommunication Policy.
As broadcasting trouble-shooter for the
White House, Whitehead presented to the
National Association of Broadcasters a
month ago a novel—and ominous—proposal
that would drastically alter the shape of
television broadcasting in America.
The major premise of the Whitehead
doctrine is that the "Fairness
Doctrine"—the statutory provision that
confirms the public's right to be
informed—be scrapped. He would replace
the giant procedural void that would result
with new standards for granting
broadcasters their license to do business in
a community.
Radical Proposals
Whitehead's radical proposals stem from
a growing interest in the business of
broadcasters which has resulted in a

reconsideration of the whole fairness issue
by both government and industry.
Network broadcasters are presently
besieged by both the public and the
government for irresponsibility. Ever since
Vice President Spiro Agnew made the
now-famous Des Moines speech about
network news bias, there has been a
non-stop assault on the TV news bosses.
The latest indictment of network
objectivity comes from long-time TV critic
Edith Efron in her new book, The News
Twisters. Using her own statistical
methodology, the TV Guide columnist
counts up the number of biased remarks
made by newsmen in the 1968 election
coverage and concludes that network
figures run into the red when it comes to
objectivity.
And the public—from the Citizen's
Communication Council in Washington to
the United Church of Christ in San
Francisco—have been hounding the
broadcasters for more open access, greater
say in programming, and more minority
interest programming.
