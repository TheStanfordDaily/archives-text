# American Dream Turns Into 'Nightmare'
## 
### HALL DAILY 
Thus long has mankind gone astray
Sidney Slomich, author of The
American Nightmare, worked for
16 years with highly classified
information, for the CIA and a
number of public and private
think tanks, and came to one
major conclusion. The people of
America are presiding over their
own solution: The American
Dream or The American
Nightmare?
In delicately woven detail,
Slomich deftly dissects and
expounds on the multifarious
problems facing the American
people as a result of our country's
headlong rush into post-Wortd
War II paranoia. Beset with the
deteriorating state of the human
condition, America continues to
search frantically for
technological solutions to any and
all social and political problems,
argues author Slomich.
He calls for the "silenced
majority" to take back their
country before it's too late, citing
the experts' obsession with
technology, as the answer to
human problems, as a grave
development.
Slomich attacks his former
colleagues, the experts, for their
narrow perspective and
manipulativeness. With his
knowledge and background, he
constructs the foundation for his
thesis with concrete historical
examples of what caused the
dream to become the nightmare.
Describing his feelings on

Apollo 10's orbit of our dead
lunar satellite in juxtaposition
with the meaning of the Berkeley
demonstration to preserve a little
remnant of living space known as
People's Park, Slomich exhibits a
rare understanding of the
perversion of human values that
darkens history and imperils the
future.
Outlining his thoughts into
alarmingly sensible patterns,
Slomich addresses himself to the
state of the American mind which
seeks to avoid or discredit the
future consequences of
contemporary actions. The
author's prose focuses on the
cacophonous voice of the
American people and strikes a
chord of exhortation in rebuking
the public for blind reactiveness
to the surface threats to their
well-being.
Slomich addresses himself most
poignantly to his fields of
expertise: an end to the hysterical
arms race, the inhumanity of
American foreign policy,
reformation of education, and
ecologically sound proposals
toward the urban problem. But
most of all, Slomich cares for his
land and his people, today and
tomorrow, and knows what the
people can and must do to clean
up the present and save th s,
future.

Nightmare, "An Open Letter to
