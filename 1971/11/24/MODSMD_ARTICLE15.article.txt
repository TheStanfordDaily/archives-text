# 'The French Connection'
## Audience Pleaser Of Year 
### TODD McCARTHY 
"The French Connection" will undoubtedly emerge as the
audience pleaser of the year and justifiably so. In its toughness and
believability of its relative realism, this slam-bang rendition of the
sixties' biggest drug bust surpasses almost everything that has gone
before it.
Both in its credits and tone, the film is a direct descendant of
"Bullitt" and "Shaft." The producer, Philip d'Antoni, performed in
like capacity on "Bullitt" and has all but perfected a patent on
modern, classic chase sequences and while each viewer will have to
decide for himself which is more exciting, the victimization of the
innocent bystander in the parallel race between Gene Hackman's
sedan and a New York elevated train lends a heightened
precariousness and danger to the new film.
In "Bullitt," no unfortunate happened to be caught crossing a
street or loading a truck when McQueen came roaring up and down
the San Francisco hills. In "The French Connection," detective Gene
Hackman first steals a car from a civilian, after which at least three
people are killed for no other reason than being caught in the wrong
place at the wrong time in the icy hell of everyday New York.
What has to be a sly reference to "Bullitt" occurs when Hackman's
aide enters one morning, awakens his friend and is told, "Hand me my
pants." To be sure, an almost word-for-word repeat of a "Bullitt"
scene, but it makes all the difference in the world that Hackman
resides in a New York housing project instead of on Russian Hill, that
his feet have been shackled together with his own handcuffs by the
chick he picked up the night before and that the girl in question is a
bicycle-riding one night stand instead of the Porsche-driving
Jacqueline Bisset.
Bigot With Balls
Bullitt spent his extra time at Coffee Cantata and Enrico's, while
Hackman's Jimmy Doyle busts blacks in bars and looks distinctly out
of place even in the lobby of the Roosevelt Hotel. Bullitt was a liberal
with style and Doyle is a bigot with balls.
Similar lines can be drawn from this summer's "Shaft" to "The
French Connection." Both were written by Ernest Tidyman and on
the surface, the two are closest in their toughness and depiction of the
black and Italian criminal undergrounds in New York. One of my
favorite elements in both pictures, however, is the evocation of the
unique big city coldness, the freezing feet and hands, the visible
breath that flows together with vehicle exhaust and street steam, the
brittle vinyl of car interiors.
Also memorable in its own way is the junk and garbage of New
York, but is this really the kind of movie-making Mayor Lindsay is
encouraging in his city? We can only look forward to the kind of films
that will be made if he ever gets to Washington.
Utterly Realistic
Gene Hackman's following should increase considerably after this
film. Already having turned in impressive supporting performances in
"Bonnie and Clyde" and "Downhill Racer" and having been
nominated for his second Oscar in last year's "I Never Sang for My
Father," his Jimmy Doyle is utterly unglamorous, utterly realistic and
rather likeable. First-hand witnesses to such things assure me that
Doyle's no holds barred roughhousing in his busts, especially of
blacks, is closer to the truth than any version previously seen and I
have no reason to doubt their corroboration.
For Doyle, it's a world of wops and niggers and frogs and spies and
let anyone try to stop him. It seems a particularly American priority,
or perhaps more specifically a symptom of New York, that the cops
can so off-handedly kill, not to mention inconvenience, innocent
people and their own men in pursuit of even the world's number one
heroin supplier.
No doubt contributing to the excitement of the story is the
knowledge that basically, it is true, as it is based on a Robin Moore
("The Green Berets") novel based on the seizure of $32 million worth
of 89 per cent pure heroin which had been smuggled from Marseilles
to New York in a car aboard a transatlantic liner. That record amount

was finally surpassed just two months ago in the Jaguar case, when
200 pounds of heroin, valued at $40 million, was confiscated from a
car which had been shipped on the Queen Elizabeth 11.
Big Stakes
With stakes as big as these, it's little wonder that the law tends to
tolerate the small-fry users, better to catch, in this case, the biggest
frog in the pond. But when, in a "Z'Mike resume at the end, the
miniscule sentences of the kingpins and departmental transferals of
the police agents are revealed, one senses that even Hollywood, for
once, has correctly pinpointed the uneven ahd hypocritical balance of
moral and legal priorities.
William Friedkin has by now confirmed himself as one of the very
best of the recent emigres from television to the cinema. His first film,
"Good Times" with Sonny and Cher, never received wide distribution
and hasn't yet been brought back for discovery, but "The Night They
Raided Minsky's" is a minor classic in the sub-genre of burlesque
musicals, his version of "The Birthday Party" is considered at least an
intelligent attempt at transferring Pinter to celluloid and Friedkin
coped admirably with the stage-bound hysterics of "Boys in the
Band."
Stylishly slick enought to please the corporate brass and fit into
the mainstream of commercial cinema, Friedkin has nonetheless been
able to evoke a strong sense of atmosphere and milieu in each of his
diverse settings. In "The French Connection" alone, not only does he
capture what beauty there is in the real dirt and stench of New York
but, when in Marseilles, catches the sun reflecting on the water as it
can only on the Mediterranean. Though the kinds of pleasures "The
French Connection" imparts can often be attributed to calculation in
the commercial cinema, I can imagine few people not responding to
such a high-powered piece of entertainment. It attacks the senses from
every direction.

Also memorable in its own way is the junk and garbage of New
York, but is this really the kind of movie-making Mayor Lindsay is
encouraging in his city? We can only look forward to the kind of films
that will be made if he ever gets to Washington.
Utterly Realistic
Gene Hackman's following should increase considerably after this
film. Already having turned in impressive supporting performances in
"Bonnie and Clyde" and "Downhill Racer" and having been
nominated for his second Oscar in last year's "I Never Sang for My
Father," his Jimmy Doyle is utterly unglamorous, utterly realistic and
rather likeable. First-hand witnesses to such things assure me that
Doyle's no holds barred roughhousing in his busts, especially of
blacks, is closer to the truth than any version previously seen and I
have no reason to doubt their corroboration.
For Doyle, it's a world of wops and niggers and frogs and spies and
let anyone try to stop him. It seems a particularly American priority,
or perhaps more specifically a symptom of New York, that the cops
can so off-handedly kill, not to mention inconvenience, innocent
people and their own men in pursuit of even the world's number one
heroin supplier.
No doubt contributing to the excitement of the story is the
knowledge that basically, it is true, as it is based on a Robin Moore
("The Green Berets") novel based on the seizure of $32 million worth
of 89 per cent pure heroin which had been smuggled from Marseilles
to New York in a car aboard a transatlantic liner. That record amount

was finally surpassed just two months ago in the Jaguar case, when
200 pounds of heroin, valued at $40 million, was confiscated from a
car which had been shipped on the Queen Elizabeth 11.
Big Stakes
With stakes as big as these, it's little wonder that the law tends to
tolerate the small-fry users, better to catch, in this case, the biggest
frog in the pond. But when, in a "Z'Mike resume at the end, the
miniscule sentences of the kingpins and departmental transferals of
the police agents are revealed, one senses that even Hollywood, for
once, has correctly pinpointed the uneven ahd hypocritical balance of
moral and legal priorities.
William Friedkin has by now confirmed himself as one of the very
best of the recent emigres from television to the cinema. His first film,
"Good Times" with Sonny and Cher, never received wide distribution
and hasn't yet been brought back for discovery, but "The Night They
Raided Minsky's" is a minor classic in the sub-genre of burlesque
musicals, his version of "The Birthday Party" is considered at least an
intelligent attempt at transferring Pinter to celluloid and Friedkin
coped admirably with the stage-bound hysterics of "Boys in the
Band."
Stylishly slick enought to please the corporate brass and fit into
the mainstream of commercial cinema, Friedkin has nonetheless been
able to evoke a strong sense of atmosphere and milieu in each of his
diverse settings. In "The French Connection" alone, not only does he
capture what beauty there is in the real dirt and stench of New York
but, when in Marseilles, catches the sun reflecting on the water as it
can only on the Mediterranean. Though the kinds of pleasures "The
French Connection" imparts can often be attributed to calculation in
the commercial cinema, I can imagine few people not responding to
such a high-powered piece of entertainment. It attacks the senses from
every direction.

TOUGH COP—Gene Hackman portrays New York detective Jimmy
Doyle in "The French Connection," a thriller detailing the biggest
drug bust of the sixties. The film, directed by William Friedkin, opens
today in San Francisco.
"The French Connection" will undoubtedly emerge as the
audience pleaser of the year and justifiably so. In its toughness and
believability of its relative realism, this slam-bang rendition of the
sixties' biggest drug bust surpasses almost everything that has gone
before it.
Both in its credits and tone, the film is a direct descendant of
"Bullitt" and "Shaft." The producer, Philip d'Antoni, performed in
like capacity on "Bullitt" and has all but perfected a patent on
modern, classic chase sequences and while each viewer will have to
decide for himself which is more exciting, the victimization of the
innocent bystander in the parallel race between Gene Hackman's
sedan and a New York elevated train lends a heightened
precariousness and danger to the new film.
In "Bullitt," no unfortunate happened to be caught crossing a
street or loading a truck when McQueen came roaring up and down
the San Francisco hills. In "The French Connection," detective Gene
Hackman first steals a car from a civilian, after which at least three
people are killed for no other reason than being caught in the wrong
place at the wrong time in the icy hell of everyday New York.
What has to be a sly reference to "Bullitt" occurs when Hackman's
aide enters one morning, awakens his friend and is told, "Hand me my
pants." To be sure, an almost word-for-word repeat of a "Bullitt"
scene, but it makes all the difference in the world that Hackman
resides in a New York housing project instead of on Russian Hill, that
his feet have been shackled together with his own handcuffs by the
chick he picked up the night before and that the girl in question is a
bicycle-riding one night stand instead of the Porsche-driving
Jacqueline Bisset.
Bigot With Balls
Bullitt spent his extra time at Coffee Cantata and Enrico's, while
Hackman's Jimmy Doyle busts blacks in bars and looks distinctly out
of place even in the lobby of the Roosevelt Hotel. Bullitt was a liberal
with style and Doyle is a bigot with balls.
Similar lines can be drawn from this summer's "Shaft" to "The
French Connection." Both were written by Ernest Tidyman and on
the surface, the two are closest in their toughness and depiction of the
black and Italian criminal undergrounds in New York. One of my
favorite elements in both pictures, however, is the evocation of the
unique big city coldness, the freezing feet and hands, the visible
breath that flows together with vehicle exhaust and street steam, the
brittle vinyl of car interiors.
Also memorable in its own way is the junk and garbage of New
York, but is this really the kind of movie-making Mayor Lindsay is
encouraging in his city? We can only look forward to the kind of films
that will be made if he ever gets to Washington.

musicals, his version of "The Birthday Party" is considered at least an
intelligent attempt at transferring Pinter to celluloid and Friedkin
coped admirably with the stage-bound hysterics of "Boys in the
Band."
Stylishly slick enought to please the corporate brass and fit into
the mainstream of commercial cinema, Friedkin has nonetheless been
able to evoke a strong sense of atmosphere and milieu in each of his
diverse settings. In "The French Connection" alone, not only does he
capture what beauty there is in the real dirt and stench of New York
but, when in Marseilles, catches the sun reflecting on the water as it
can only on the Mediterranean. Though the kinds of pleasures "The
French Connection" imparts can often be attributed to calculation in
the commercial cinema, I can imagine few people not responding to
such a high-powered piece of entertainment. It attacks the senses from
every direction.

TOUGH COP—Gene Hackman portrays New York detective Jimmy
Doyle in "The French Connection," a thriller detailing the biggest
drug bust of the sixties. The film, directed by William Friedkin, opens
today in San Francisco.
"The French Connection" will undoubtedly emerge as the
audience pleaser of the year and justifiably so. In its toughness and
believability of its relative realism, this slam-bang rendition of the
sixties' biggest drug bust surpasses almost everything that has gone
before it.
Both in its credits and tone, the film is a direct descendant of
"Bullitt" and "Shaft." The producer, Philip d'Antoni, performed in
like capacity on "Bullitt" and has all but perfected a patent on
modern, classic chase sequences and while each viewer will have to
decide for himself which is more exciting, the victimization of the
innocent bystander in the parallel race between Gene Hackman's
sedan and a New York elevated train lends a heightened
precariousness and danger to the new film.
In "Bullitt," no unfortunate happened to be caught crossing a
street or loading a truck when McQueen came roaring up and down
the San Francisco hills. In "The French Connection," detective Gene
Hackman first steals a car from a civilian, after which at least three
people are killed for no other reason than being caught in the wrong
place at the wrong time in the icy hell of everyday New York.
What has to be a sly reference to "Bullitt" occurs when Hackman's
aide enters one morning, awakens his friend and is told, "Hand me my
pants." To be sure, an almost word-for-word repeat of a "Bullitt"
scene, but it makes all the difference in the world that Hackman
resides in a New York housing project instead of on Russian Hill, that
his feet have been shackled together with his own handcuffs by the
chick he picked up the night before and that the girl in question is a
bicycle-riding one night stand instead of the Porsche-driving
Jacqueline Bisset.
Bigot With Balls
Bullitt spent his extra time at Coffee Cantata and Enrico's, while
Hackman's Jimmy Doyle busts blacks in bars and looks distinctly out
of place even in the lobby of the Roosevelt Hotel. Bullitt was a liberal
with style and Doyle is a bigot with balls.
Similar lines can be drawn from this summer's "Shaft" to "The
French Connection." Both were written by Ernest Tidyman and on
the surface, the two are closest in their toughness and depiction of the
black and Italian criminal undergrounds in New York. One of my
favorite elements in both pictures, however, is the evocation of the
unique big city coldness, the freezing feet and hands, the visible
breath that flows together with vehicle exhaust and street steam, the
brittle vinyl of car interiors.
Also memorable in its own way is the junk and garbage of New
York, but is this really the kind of movie-making Mayor Lindsay is
encouraging in his city? We can only look forward to the kind of films
that will be made if he ever gets to Washington.
Utterly Realistic
Gene Hackman's following should increase considerably after this
film. Already having turned in impressive supporting performances in
"Bonnie and Clyde" and "Downhill Racer" and having been
nominated for his second Oscar in last year's "I Never Sang for My
Father," his Jimmy Doyle is utterly unglamorous, utterly realistic and
rather likeable. First-hand witnesses to such things assure me that
Doyle's no holds barred roughhousing in his busts, especially of
blacks, is closer to the truth than any version previously seen and I
have no reason to doubt their corroboration.
For Doyle, it's a world of wops and niggers and frogs and spies and
let anyone try to stop him. It seems a particularly American priority,
or perhaps more specifically a symptom of New York, that the cops
can so off-handedly kill, not to mention inconvenience, innocent
people and their own men in pursuit of even the world's number one
heroin supplier.
No doubt contributing to the excitement of the story is the
knowledge that basically, it is true, as it is based on a Robin Moore
("The Green Berets") novel based on the seizure of $32 million worth
of 89 per cent pure heroin which had been smuggled from Marseilles
to New York in a car aboard a transatlantic liner. That record amount

was finally surpassed just two months ago in the Jaguar case, when
200 pounds of heroin, valued at $40 million, was confiscated from a
car which had been shipped on the Queen Elizabeth 11.
Big Stakes
With stakes as big as these, it's little wonder that the law tends to
tolerate the small-fry users, better to catch, in this case, the biggest
frog in the pond. But when, in a "Z'Mike resume at the end, the
miniscule sentences of the kingpins and departmental transferals of
the police agents are revealed, one senses that even Hollywood, for
once, has correctly pinpointed the uneven ahd hypocritical balance of
moral and legal priorities.
William Friedkin has by now confirmed himself as one of the very
best of the recent emigres from television to the cinema. His first film,
"Good Times" with Sonny and Cher, never received wide distribution
and hasn't yet been brought back for discovery, but "The Night They
Raided Minsky's" is a minor classic in the sub-genre of burlesque
musicals, his version of "The Birthday Party" is considered at least an
