# Yugoslavian Folk Dance Company: An Exciting Ethnic Extravaganza
## 
### 
JANE BUSSE
For two and a half hours
Sunday afternoon, a Memorial
Auditorium audience, which sadly
included only a few students,
responded spontaneously with
amazement to the ethnic
extravaganza presented by Frula,
a Yugoslavian folk dance
company.
Appreciation of this
combination of colorful costumes,
music, strenuous movement and
graceful pantomime involves
suspension of reality on the part
of an American audience.
Folk dancing is now universally
accepted as an art performed on
stage like ballet or modern dance.
But it originated from people's
desire to express folklore heritage
among themselves and not for
large audiences.
Folk dancing is world wide,
even the United States has its
indigenous square dancing. But
few countries can compare to
Yugoslavia because their dances
just don't tell a story; where the
dances in Frula depict the strife,
struggle and optimism of life
inherent in Yugoslavian character
after a history of continual
invasions.
Dancers-Actors
The dancers were all actors,

performing the roles of fishermen,
soldiers, sailors or woodcutters.
The boundless energy of the
dancers was only matched by the
fervor of the audience. It was
difficult to sit still when one
company member jumps at least
six feet over a line of dancers, or
the women are swung off their
feet by their partner, or a soldier
struts off proudly with the
woman he has won.
Director Dragoslav Dzadzevic
seeks to overwhelm an audience
by juxtaposing large groups with a
few performers, bright colors with
somber lighting and energetic
displays of male strength with
delicate steps by women.
Occasionally the choreography
overreaches the capacities of the
stage and the dancers and
terminates in confusion.
Frula is a relatively young
company. Having been in
existence only seven years, and
the median age of the dancers is
20. While Frula has experienced a
rapid rise in fame, the company's
experience cannot compare to
that of national companies from
the Soviet Union or Mexico.
Fast-Moving
A pyramid of men outlined by
tie rising curtain set the tone of
s rength for the performance. This

first dance, "Yugoslavia"
combined the most familiar
Yugoslavian songs and dance steps
into a fast-moving presentation
which was to set the pace of the
program.
A number of slow, almost
lyrical dances interjected into the
overall breathless pace, provided
the needed contrast. In "Biljana,"
the female dancers were restricted
in space and movement by
ribbons they held, yet the
figuration of the ribbons created
the illusion of weaving a wedding
veil.
Dradzevic's dancers moved in
circles, with partners, or in
attached lines, where each
member had to coordinate his
movements with the rest. The
attention focused on one person
in "The Prize" and "Dances From

Vojvodina," when each individual
showed off his mastery of
remarkable leaping, kicking and
acrobatic feats.
The integration of each dancer
into the company provided the
ensemble interaction of the
presentation. Even the orchestra,
aided by a captivating percussion
player, blended into the array of
movement and mood. The
continual feeling that the dancers
were enjoying executing the
dances as much as performing
them produced frequent applause
and occasional rhythmic clapping
in the audience.

tie rising curtain set the tone of
s rength for the performance. This

first dance, "Yugoslavia"
combined the most familiar
Yugoslavian songs and dance steps
into a fast-moving presentation
which was to set the pace of the
program.
A number of slow, almost
lyrical dances interjected into the
overall breathless pace, provided
the needed contrast. In "Biljana,"
the female dancers were restricted
in space and movement by
ribbons they held, yet the
figuration of the ribbons created
the illusion of weaving a wedding
veil.
Dradzevic's dancers moved in
circles, with partners, or in
attached lines, where each
member had to coordinate his
movements with the rest. The
attention focused on one person
in "The Prize" and "Dances From

Vojvodina," when each individual
showed off his mastery of
remarkable leaping, kicking and
acrobatic feats.
The integration of each dancer
into the company provided the
ensemble interaction of the
presentation. Even the orchestra,
aided by a captivating percussion
player, blended into the array of
movement and mood. The
continual feeling that the dancers
were enjoying executing the
dances as much as performing
them produced frequent applause
and occasional rhythmic clapping
in the audience.

For two and a half hours
Sunday afternoon, a Memorial
Auditorium audience, which sadly
included only a few students,
responded spontaneously with
amazement to the ethnic
extravaganza presented by Frula,
a Yugoslavian folk dance
company.
Appreciation of this
combination of colorful costumes,
music, strenuous movement and
graceful pantomime involves
suspension of reality on the part
of an American audience.
Folk dancing is now universally
accepted as an art performed on
stage like ballet or modern dance.
But it originated from people's
desire to express folklore heritage
among themselves and not for
large audiences.
Folk dancing is world wide,
even the United States has its
indigenous square dancing. But
few countries can compare to
Yugoslavia because their dances
just don't tell a story; where the
dances in Frula depict the strife,
struggle and optimism of life
inherent in Yugoslavian character
after a history of continual
invasions.
Dancers-Actors
The dancers were all actors,

performing the roles of fishermen,
soldiers, sailors or woodcutters.
The boundless energy of the
dancers was only matched by the
fervor of the audience. It was
difficult to sit still when one
company member jumps at least
six feet over a line of dancers, or
the women are swung off their
feet by their partner, or a soldier
struts off proudly with the
woman he has won.
Director Dragoslav Dzadzevic
seeks to overwhelm an audience
by juxtaposing large groups with a
few performers, bright colors with
somber lighting and energetic
displays of male strength with
delicate steps by women.
Occasionally the choreography
overreaches the capacities of the
stage and the dancers and
terminates in confusion.
Frula is a relatively young
company. Having been in
existence only seven years, and
the median age of the dancers is
20. While Frula has experienced a
rapid rise in fame, the company's
experience cannot compare to
that of national companies from
the Soviet Union or Mexico.
