# Bejart Ballet
## True Communication 
### CHRISTINE DOUGLAS 
On Sunday, Maurice Bejart's "Ballet of the
Twentieth Century" completed a four day round of
performances in Zellerbach Auditorium on the
UC-Berkeley Campus. Bejart' has often maintained
that the prime purpose of dance and of all true art is
communication.
His choreography and the performances of his
dancers as individuals and in group are the best to
have appeared in ballet for a long time. Bejart's
success at "communication" results from an
overwhelming honesty that creates a strong bond
from the outset between audience and dancers.
Never is there an unnecessary or unnatural
movement. Every body moves with accuracy,
precision and emotional involvement. Bejart
explores the potential for movement in the human
body to its ultimate conclusion: a beauty that left
the woman sitting next to me speechless after each
dance, seemingly on the verge of tears.
The first dance, "Choreographic-Offering," in
Bejart's words, is "a collective work and has no
other purpose than to present or to 'offer' the
public the quality called 'Ballet of the Twentieth
Century' The choreography is loose in the sense
that the dancers improvise within a set choregraphic
framework.
"Counter-Point"
Within the eight central canons of the work,
Bejart develops a "counter-point" of music and
dance. Johann Sebastian Bach's "Musical Offering"
is interrupted at various points by live modern
music - played on stage with bells, drums and sheets
of metal.
Accompanying this divergence in music is a sharp
contrast of classical and modern ballet. As Bejart
himself points out, "these two basic elements seem
to struggle to dominate the work."This struggle
creates a tension and excitement which give this
piece its particular appeal.
The struggle culminates at the end when two
groups of dancers, one dressed in traditional ballet
class garb — leotards, tights and leg-warmers — and
the other in bright jazz costumes, gather and dance
in opposition to each other. There is such confusion
that the dance seems on the verge of falling apart.
Suddenly, a ballerina dressed in white tutu and
diamond crown, carrying a red rose, enters walks to
the front of thestage,and outstretches her arms, as if
offering the rose to the audience. With this gesture,
she restores a sense of order and harmony to the
dance.
Revolutionary Spirit
Bejart's second piece, "Firebird" is an allegorical
story of the birth and eternal life of the
revolutionary spirit. The movement fuses the
actions of a bird with a basic Russian flavor for
dance and rhythm. According to Bejart. the dance
"becomes the expression of these two elements that
are always present in the music: a profound feeling
of Russian and a certain rupture with traditional
music, translated ... by an inhabitual rhythmical
violence."
Paolo Bortoluzzi, as the firebird, was so
convincing that at certain points he seemed to

actually become a bird. His thin, long legs and
expansive chest lent sensitivity and strength to the
role he played. Bortoluzzi performed a series of pas
de chats, arabesques and attitudes that indeed
caught the feeling of a bird in flight.
Bejart once again manages to maintain the
interest of the audience near the end of the piece
when the dead firebird is dragged to the middle of
the stage, by the other "birds", all of whom are
dressed in blue trousers and matching blue blouses.
Suddenly another firebird, dressed in red, enters and
brings the dead firebird back to life through the
sexual act in one of the most beautiful parts of the
dance.
While the two firebirds dance together, the
dancers dressed in blue form two circles which whir
around the firebirds and thus creating a sensation of
chaotic and uncontrollable passion. The audience
reached such a pitch of excitement that the dance
received close to fifteen curtaincalls!
Basic Life Forces
In the third dance, "Sacre de Printemps," Bejart
attempts to portray the basic life forces common to
all men. In Bejart's words, "At a time when the
borders that divide the human spirit are gradually
crumbling, we must begin to speak in terms of the
culture of all mankind. Let us avoid that which is
not universal and only retain the essential forces of
mankind which are the same all over the world and
throughout all periods of history."
The dance is divided into three parts. The first
section is danced solely by men. Because Bejart's
choreography is most impressive when it deals with
forceful strong movement, this section is by far the
best. The dancers, dressed in beige, green, brown
and grey costumes move with a primordial grace
that is reminiscent of African and Indian dance
traditions.
Throughout the piece, Bejart maintains a
remarkable diversity in intensity levels, so that a
sense of excitement and anticipation prevails. The
second section is danced solely by women, all of
whom are dressed in white leotards. The
choreography has an ephemeral light quality about
it, which at first is a welcome contrast to the first
section, but which soon becomes monotonous.
Rekindled Excitement
The last section, in which the male and female
dancers performed together, rekindles the
excitement lacking in the second section. In this
section the dancers split off into pairs, and simulate
the sexual act through dance movement. The
movements of the two lead dancers, Angele
Albrecht and Jorge Donn, are beautifully echoed by
the precise contractions, fouettes and leg extensions
of the chorus. At the end of the dance, the two lead
dancers come together in a painful, spontaneous
embrace.
At the end of the evening's performance, the
audience seemed visibly drained by the involvement
and total self-immersion which a Bejart performance
demands of its audience. One feels that indeed
Bejart has succeeded in "moving away from the
sophisticated, rich atmosphere of its history" into
the realm of true communicative art.

all men. In Bejart's words, "At a time when the
borders that divide the human spirit are gradually
crumbling, we must begin to speak in terms of the
culture of all mankind. Let us avoid that which is
not universal and only retain the essential forces of
mankind which are the same all over the world and
throughout all periods of history."
The dance is divided into three parts. The first
section is danced solely by men. Because Bejart's
choreography is most impressive when it deals with
forceful strong movement, this section is by far the
best. The dancers, dressed in beige, green, brown
and grey costumes move with a primordial grace
that is reminiscent of African and Indian dance
traditions.
Throughout the piece, Bejart maintains a
remarkable diversity in intensity levels, so that a
sense of excitement and anticipation prevails. The
second section is danced solely by women, all of
whom are dressed in white leotards. The
choreography has an ephemeral light quality about
it, which at first is a welcome contrast to the first
section, but which soon becomes monotonous.
Rekindled Excitement
The last section, in which the male and female
dancers performed together, rekindles the
excitement lacking in the second section. In this
section the dancers split off into pairs, and simulate
the sexual act through dance movement. The
movements of the two lead dancers, Angele
Albrecht and Jorge Donn, are beautifully echoed by
the precise contractions, fouettes and leg extensions
of the chorus. At the end of the dance, the two lead
dancers come together in a painful, spontaneous
embrace.
At the end of the evening's performance, the
audience seemed visibly drained by the involvement
and total self-immersion which a Bejart performance
demands of its audience. One feels that indeed
Bejart has succeeded in "moving away from the
sophisticated, rich atmosphere of its history" into
the realm of true communicative art.
On Sunday, Maurice Bejart's "Ballet of the
Twentieth Century" completed a four day round of
performances in Zellerbach Auditorium on the
UC-Berkeley Campus. Bejart' has often maintained
that the prime purpose of dance and of all true art is
communication.
His choreography and the performances of his
dancers as individuals and in group are the best to
have appeared in ballet for a long time. Bejart's
success at "communication" results from an
overwhelming honesty that creates a strong bond
from the outset between audience and dancers.
Never is there an unnecessary or unnatural
movement. Every body moves with accuracy,
precision and emotional involvement. Bejart
explores the potential for movement in the human
body to its ultimate conclusion: a beauty that left
the woman sitting next to me speechless after each
dance, seemingly on the verge of tears.
The first dance, "Choreographic-Offering," in
Bejart's words, is "a collective work and has no
other purpose than to present or to 'offer' the
public the quality called 'Ballet of the Twentieth
Century' The choreography is loose in the sense
that the dancers improvise within a set choregraphic
framework.
"Counter-Point"
Within the eight central canons of the work,
Bejart develops a "counter-point" of music and
dance. Johann Sebastian Bach's "Musical Offering"
is interrupted at various points by live modern
music - played on stage with bells, drums and sheets
of metal.
Accompanying this divergence in music is a sharp
contrast of classical and modern ballet. As Bejart
himself points out, "these two basic elements seem
to struggle to dominate the work."This struggle
creates a tension and excitement which give this
piece its particular appeal.
The struggle culminates at the end when two
groups of dancers, one dressed in traditional ballet
class garb — leotards, tights and leg-warmers — and
the other in bright jazz costumes, gather and dance
in opposition to each other. There is such confusion
that the dance seems on the verge of falling apart.
Suddenly, a ballerina dressed in white tutu and
diamond crown, carrying a red rose, enters walks to
the front of thestage,and outstretches her arms, as if
offering the rose to the audience. With this gesture,
she restores a sense of order and harmony to the
dance.
Revolutionary Spirit
Bejart's second piece, "Firebird" is an allegorical
story of the birth and eternal life of the
revolutionary spirit. The movement fuses the
actions of a bird with a basic Russian flavor for
dance and rhythm. According to Bejart. the dance
"becomes the expression of these two elements that
are always present in the music: a profound feeling
of Russian and a certain rupture with traditional
music, translated ... by an inhabitual rhythmical
violence."
Paolo Bortoluzzi, as the firebird, was so
convincing that at certain points he seemed to

actually become a bird. His thin, long legs and
expansive chest lent sensitivity and strength to the
role he played. Bortoluzzi performed a series of pas
de chats, arabesques and attitudes that indeed
caught the feeling of a bird in flight.
Bejart once again manages to maintain the
interest of the audience near the end of the piece
when the dead firebird is dragged to the middle of
the stage, by the other "birds", all of whom are
dressed in blue trousers and matching blue blouses.
Suddenly another firebird, dressed in red, enters and
brings the dead firebird back to life through the
sexual act in one of the most beautiful parts of the
dance.
While the two firebirds dance together, the
dancers dressed in blue form two circles which whir
around the firebirds and thus creating a sensation of
chaotic and uncontrollable passion. The audience
reached such a pitch of excitement that the dance
received close to fifteen curtaincalls!

In the third dance, "Sacre de Printemps," Bejart
attempts to portray the basic life forces common to

that the dance seems on the verge of falling apart.
Suddenly, a ballerina dressed in white tutu and
diamond crown, carrying a red rose, enters walks to
the front of thestage,and outstretches her arms, as if
offering the rose to the audience. With this gesture,
she restores a sense of order and harmony to the
dance.
Revolutionary Spirit
Bejart's second piece, "Firebird" is an allegorical
story of the birth and eternal life of the
revolutionary spirit. The movement fuses the
actions of a bird with a basic Russian flavor for
dance and rhythm. According to Bejart. the dance
"becomes the expression of these two elements that
are always present in the music: a profound feeling
of Russian and a certain rupture with traditional
music, translated ... by an inhabitual rhythmical
violence."
Paolo Bortoluzzi, as the firebird, was so
convincing that at certain points he seemed to

actually become a bird. His thin, long legs and
expansive chest lent sensitivity and strength to the
role he played. Bortoluzzi performed a series of pas
de chats, arabesques and attitudes that indeed
caught the feeling of a bird in flight.
Bejart once again manages to maintain the
interest of the audience near the end of the piece
when the dead firebird is dragged to the middle of
the stage, by the other "birds", all of whom are
dressed in blue trousers and matching blue blouses.
Suddenly another firebird, dressed in red, enters and
brings the dead firebird back to life through the
sexual act in one of the most beautiful parts of the
dance.
While the two firebirds dance together, the
dancers dressed in blue form two circles which whir
around the firebirds and thus creating a sensation of
chaotic and uncontrollable passion. The audience
reached such a pitch of excitement that the dance
received close to fifteen curtaincalls!
Basic Life Forces
In the third dance, "Sacre de Printemps," Bejart
attempts to portray the basic life forces common to
all men. In Bejart's words, "At a time when the
borders that divide the human spirit are gradually
crumbling, we must begin to speak in terms of the
culture of all mankind. Let us avoid that which is
not universal and only retain the essential forces of
mankind which are the same all over the world and
throughout all periods of history."
The dance is divided into three parts. The first
section is danced solely by men. Because Bejart's
choreography is most impressive when it deals with
forceful strong movement, this section is by far the
best. The dancers, dressed in beige, green, brown
and grey costumes move with a primordial grace
that is reminiscent of African and Indian dance
traditions.
Throughout the piece, Bejart maintains a
remarkable diversity in intensity levels, so that a
sense of excitement and anticipation prevails. The
second section is danced solely by women, all of
whom are dressed in white leotards. The
choreography has an ephemeral light quality about
it, which at first is a welcome contrast to the first
section, but which soon becomes monotonous.
Rekindled Excitement
The last section, in which the male and female
dancers performed together, rekindles the
excitement lacking in the second section. In this
section the dancers split off into pairs, and simulate
the sexual act through dance movement. The
movements of the two lead dancers, Angele
Albrecht and Jorge Donn, are beautifully echoed by
the precise contractions, fouettes and leg extensions
of the chorus. At the end of the dance, the two lead
dancers come together in a painful, spontaneous
embrace.
At the end of the evening's performance, the
audience seemed visibly drained by the involvement
and total self-immersion which a Bejart performance
demands of its audience. One feels that indeed
Bejart has succeeded in "moving away from the
sophisticated, rich atmosphere of its history" into
the realm of true communicative art.
On Sunday, Maurice Bejart's "Ballet of the
Twentieth Century" completed a four day round of
performances in Zellerbach Auditorium on the
UC-Berkeley Campus. Bejart' has often maintained
that the prime purpose of dance and of all true art is
communication.
His choreography and the performances of his
dancers as individuals and in group are the best to
have appeared in ballet for a long time. Bejart's
success at "communication" results from an
overwhelming honesty that creates a strong bond
from the outset between audience and dancers.
Never is there an unnecessary or unnatural
movement. Every body moves with accuracy,
precision and emotional involvement. Bejart
explores the potential for movement in the human
body to its ultimate conclusion: a beauty that left
the woman sitting next to me speechless after each
dance, seemingly on the verge of tears.
The first dance, "Choreographic-Offering," in
Bejart's words, is "a collective work and has no
other purpose than to present or to 'offer' the
public the quality called 'Ballet of the Twentieth
Century' The choreography is loose in the sense
that the dancers improvise within a set choregraphic
framework.
"Counter-Point"
Within the eight central canons of the work,
Bejart develops a "counter-point" of music and
dance. Johann Sebastian Bach's "Musical Offering"
is interrupted at various points by live modern
music - played on stage with bells, drums and sheets
of metal.
Accompanying this divergence in music is a sharp
contrast of classical and modern ballet. As Bejart
himself points out, "these two basic elements seem
to struggle to dominate the work."This struggle
creates a tension and excitement which give this
piece its particular appeal.
The struggle culminates at the end when two
groups of dancers, one dressed in traditional ballet
class garb — leotards, tights and leg-warmers — and
the other in bright jazz costumes, gather and dance
in opposition to each other. There is such confusion
that the dance seems on the verge of falling apart.
