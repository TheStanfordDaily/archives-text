# DOD Spokesman Defends Pentagon From Its Critics
## 
### 
Affirming the Defense Department's belief in a
strong and free press, Daniel Z. Henkin, DOD
undersecretary for public affairs, spoke here
Monday night to an overflow crowd of students.
"It's not every day that a member of the Defense
Department is invited to this campus," the burly,
cigarette puffing Pentagon spokesman remarked.
The 90 minute question and answer session was
part of a seminar on mass media problems
sponsored by the Communication Department.
"We were not as forthcoming as we should have
been,"the Nixon appointee admitted about the
Pentagon's treatment of Laos bombing raids.
Most questions dealt with the Pentagon Papers
and the C.B.S. television documentary, "The Selling
of the Pentagon," which criticized the multi-million
dollar public relations activities of the Defense
Department.
He agreed with his courteous questioners that
"Too much information is classified." But he added,
"Too much classified information is public."

Henkin, who was a journalist before joining the
Pentagon in 1965, fielded most questions skillfully
and attempted not to interrupt any of the students.
The spokesman felt that 'The Selling of the
Pentagon," was generally an unprofessional
presentation. "I would only hope that C.B.S. would
have the same consideration for my children and
curtail the violence on the tube," he commented.
But Henkin did admit that "some activities
(described in the film) have been curtailed." He
cited the elimination of some of the red scare
films—a few produced by C.B.S. itself—dating from
the Cold War.
Henkin was accompanied by Colonel William
Taylor of the public affairs department, who sat
silently with a briefcase full of dossiers on "The
Selling of the Pentagon" which Henkin occasionally
referred to.
Communications Professor William Rivers,
seminar discussion leader and former Washington
correspondent, funneled the many questions posed
to Henkin.
