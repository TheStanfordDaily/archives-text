# Enjoys Teaching
## Bacon Active After 40 Years Here 
### GLENN GARVIN 
In terms of years at Stanford, Harold
Bacon, at 64, is very old. He started
school here in 1924, received a Master's
degree in 1929, skipped a year to work
in the insurance field, and then came
back to work on his doctorate, which
he received in 1933. He joined the
faculty in 1931; in the fall of that year,
he taught Math 41—Elementary
Calculus. He still teaches the same Math
41-42-43 series today.
This is one of the amazing things
about Bacon. After teaching the same
course every year for 40 years, a certain
st agnation might be expected, yet there
is none. The course is a popular one
among undergraduates. It is required
for math majors, true, but they don't
approach it with a "let's get it over
with quick" attitude. They seem to
enjoy it.
"I think that each time he faces a
class, he faces it as a new group, not the
same one he faced last quarter,"
explains Bacon's Math Department
colleague, Mary Sunseri, who took a
class from Bacon in 1941 when she first
came to Stanford. "It was tops," she
says.
Bacon himself admits that avoiding a
rut in teaching is a problem—"by rights,
I ought to get bored teaching the 41
series every year."
But he doesn't. "It's a challenge to
get something new into the
presentation each quarter, especially
when the subject is so routine. It hasn't
c hanged much since I've been teaching
it,"he says. "Helping a freshman get
started in this department is a lot of
fun, too."
Infinite Time
"His interest in students is
well-known," points out Paul Berg,
another math professor, who first met
Bacon in 1953. "His willingness to

devote almost an infinite amount of
time to assisting them through office
hours plays a big role in his popularity.
And his genuine friendliness is so good.
He remembers students who were in his
class 30 years ago, by name and by
little things that they did."
This last observation is very hard to
argue with. Bacon himself offers a bit
of proof every few minutes. Going back
to a class list from 1931 to answer a
question, he began reading off the
names, absent-mindedly, with a little
comment about each one: "Harold
Severinsen—he's the executive secretary
of Standard Oil of California now ... I
could go on with this for hours."
When the Daily photographer came
in half an hour later to take some
pictures, Bacon recognized him with a
hearty "hello—how are you?" even
though he had only one class with
Bacon—two years ago.
One thing Bacon regrets is that the
increasing size of the University's
student population has made it hard to
maintain personal relationships with
those who take his class. "There's a big
difference in a class of 30 and a class of
130," he says a bit sadly. "It's so hard
to know students in a situation like
that.
"You try to get them to participate
by asking questions, or by asking them
questions ... I always try to find out
their majors, because that's a clue to
what a student is like ... there are a
few little things I do, too. I write all the
grades in the record-book myself,
trying to match grades with names,
names with faces. It's hard to do,"
Bacon says.
Those students he knows lead him to
believe that, as a whole, students
haven't changed much in the past 40
vears. "Thr good students now are no
