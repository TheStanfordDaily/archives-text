## Statistical Winner 
### Charlie Hoffman 
Although the Indians did not run away with the Pacific-8 title
this year, statistically no other team came close to the Indians in the
final league figures which were released Monday.
Statistics are usually too boring and inconclusive to pay much
attention to, but the Indians' near total dominance of the conference
statistics is too important to ignore.
The most impressive statistics were compiled by Don Bunce who
has proven in black and white that Stanford could not have possibly
hoped for a more able successor to Jim Plunkett. Bunce ran away with
the Pac-B's total offense and passing statistics after Washington's
Sonny Sixkiller led for the first few games of the season.
Third To Pass 2000
His 2513 yards gave Bunce the honor of becoming the third man in
the history of the league to pass for more than 2000 yards. Jim
Plunkett did it three times, and Craig Morton of Cal did it once.
Bunce's per game average of 229.4 yards of total offense put him far
above second place Sixkiller's mark of 188.0.
Bunce's statistics have also placed him among the top five in the
nation in total yardage, but in the year of the running back, Bunce
only rates an outside shot at the Heisman Trophy because no one
seems to accept the fact that someone actually could follow Plunkett.
Junior Benny Barnes ended the season in a three way tie for first in
pass interceptions with seven, and Rod Garcia finished second behind
Bernard Jackson of WSU in scoring with 66 points. Miles Moore
placed third in receiving with 38 catches, but his 816 yards gained was
only four yards off the league lead. John Winesberry tied for fourth
with 37 receptions for 543 yards and Bill Scott finished in tenth place
with 31 catches and 393. No other pass catching trio in the
conference came close to the Stanford receivers.
Dominate Defensively
The Indians dominated the team statistics, taking first in four of
the six categories. The defensive unit topped the conference in
passing, rushing, and total defense. Allowing only an average of 220.4
yards total offense per game, Stanford led the Pac-8 all season, and
Washington's average of 250.4 was the next best defensive effort in
the conference over the 11 game season.
Offensively, the Indians led the league in total yardage with 4143
yards and a per game average of 376.6. In this category Stanford
barely nosed out the Huskies, who finished second with figures of
4090 and 371.8. Washington, however, scored 44 touchdowns to the
Indians' 29. Stanford placed second in passing offense but could
manage only a very poor sixth place in rushing, coming in ahead of
Washington and Cal.
Steve Murray's punting improved drastically late in the season, and
he moved up to fourth place in the Pac-8 with a 38.1 average. Jackie
Brown wound up in 13th in the rushing statistics with an average of
43.5 yards per game.

Offensively, the Indians led the league in total yardage with 4143
yards and a per game average of 376.6. In this category Stanford
barely nosed out the Huskies, who finished second with figures of
4090 and 371.8. Washington, however, scored 44 touchdowns to the
Indians' 29. Stanford placed second in passing offense but could
manage only a very poor sixth place in rushing, coming in ahead of
Washington and Cal.
Steve Murray's punting improved drastically late in the season, and
he moved up to fourth place in the Pac-8 with a 38.1 average. Jackie
Brown wound up in 13th in the rushing statistics with an average of
43.5 yards per game.
Although the Indians did not run away with the Pacific-8 title
this year, statistically no other team came close to the Indians in the
final league figures which were released Monday.
Statistics are usually too boring and inconclusive to pay much
attention to, but the Indians' near total dominance of the conference
statistics is too important to ignore.
The most impressive statistics were compiled by Don Bunce who
has proven in black and white that Stanford could not have possibly
hoped for a more able successor to Jim Plunkett. Bunce ran away with
the Pac-B's total offense and passing statistics after Washington's
Sonny Sixkiller led for the first few games of the season.
Third To Pass 2000
His 2513 yards gave Bunce the honor of becoming the third man in
the history of the league to pass for more than 2000 yards. Jim
Plunkett did it three times, and Craig Morton of Cal did it once.
Bunce's per game average of 229.4 yards of total offense put him far
above second place Sixkiller's mark of 188.0.
Bunce's statistics have also placed him among the top five in the
nation in total yardage, but in the year of the running back, Bunce
only rates an outside shot at the Heisman Trophy because no one
seems to accept the fact that someone actually could follow Plunkett.
Junior Benny Barnes ended the season in a three way tie for first in
pass interceptions with seven, and Rod Garcia finished second behind
Bernard Jackson of WSU in scoring with 66 points. Miles Moore
placed third in receiving with 38 catches, but his 816 yards gained was
only four yards off the league lead. John Winesberry tied for fourth
with 37 receptions for 543 yards and Bill Scott finished in tenth place
with 31 catches and 393. No other pass catching trio in the
conference came close to the Stanford receivers.
Dominate Defensively
The Indians dominated the team statistics, taking first in four of
the six categories. The defensive unit topped the conference in
passing, rushing, and total defense. Allowing only an average of 220.4
yards total offense per game, Stanford led the Pac-8 all season, and
Washington's average of 250.4 was the next best defensive effort in
the conference over the 11 game season.
