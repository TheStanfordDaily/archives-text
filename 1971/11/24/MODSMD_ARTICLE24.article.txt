Duncan Mac Donald, Stanford's lone representative at the NCCA
Cross-country Championships, placed 55th in a field of 302 last
Monday at the University of Tennessee.
Coach Marshall Clark believes that Mac Donald ran very well even
though he didn't place high. Mac Donald himself was happy with his
performance considering the extremely tough course and the excellent
field. Mac Donald was in the top 25 for the first three miles before
tiring. Clark emphasized that the course was very hilly and the
weather near freezing. Clark stated that the pace set for the first three
miles was very fast and many runners faded after that point.
Oregon upset Washington State for the team championship. Oregon
placed five men in the top 50 in running its best team race of the year.
Washington State was expected to win after trouncing Oregon in the
Pacific Eight Championships. However, the Cougars were unable to
stay together, with some of their runners hurt by the fast first three
miles. Washington State ended up a distant second.
