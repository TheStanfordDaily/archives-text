# Basketball Hopes Rise
## 
### BILL CLASTER 
Bolstered by the addition of
four excellent first year players,
Stanford's basketball prospects
for the 1971-1972 season are very
favorable. Coach Howie Dallmar
feels, "The team will be improved
in all aspects." He notes that,
"Defensively we will be able to
play a tough man to man,
offensively we will be able to run
more effectively, and in terms of
rebounding we should be
outstanding."
Much of what Dallmar says is
based on what he calls his
"strongest front line in years."
Most likely three first year players
will man the forward line when
the Indians open against Houston
on Dec. 1 at Maples Pavilion.
6' 11" Center
The probable starter at center
is 6' 11" Jack Loomis, a transfer
from Harvard. Loomis, an
adequate shooter, gives the Tribe
not only much needed rebounding
help, but also provides them with
the height needed to cope with
other teams' big men. Mike Mann,
a 6' 9" sophomore, will probably
start at forward along with Dave
Frost, a 6' 5" junior college
transfer.
Mann's strong point are
rebounding and defense. He is a
fair outside shooter, and is most
effective offensively when he
moves toward the basket. Frost,
who was named Most Valuable
Player in the State Junior College
Tournament last year, is termed
by Dallmar as "a smart, solid
ballplayer who does everything
well." He shot 65% from the field
last year while averaging 18 points
a game.
These three will be backed by
juniors Bob Buell and Pat Stevens,
and by sophomore Steve Shupe.
Buell is an excellent shooter but
has been extremely injury prone
in the past. Stevens is a very
aggressive rebounder, while Shupe

is described by Dallmar as being
"as improved as any sophomore
I've ever coached."
Terry Outstanding
At the guards the Indians will
definitely start senior Claude
Terry, the greatest single season
scorer in Stanford history. Terry,
who averaged 21 points per game
last year, is a superb shooter, and
has the size and the moves which
make him a definite pro prospect.
At 6' 5" he is an adept ball
handler and a tough rebounder.
He will be joined in the
backcourt by either Pat Rusco,
John Stratton, Bob Nicholson,
Darrell Fregia or Gary Cain.
Dallmar says, "there will be
circumstances where certain
players will play against certain
teams." Rusco and Stratton are
both juniors and are referred to
by Dallmar as "strong-type
guards." They are both fine
shooters despite their rather poor
showings last year. Dallmar feels
that experience will cure this
problem.
Nicholson, a 6'o senior, is a
fine outside threat, and has
greatly improved over last year.
Fregia has likewise improved,
mainly because he has lost some
weight and has become much
quicker. Other guards who will see
action this year are 5' 9" senior
Gary Cain and 6' 3" junior Bruce
Menser.
Overall then, the word that
best describes the Indians is
improved. The big front line
should take the pressure off the
guards, and the increased overall
strength of the team will mean
that Dallmar will not be hesitant
to substitute. Dallmar notes, "The
big thing, of course, will be for
those four big men to get
experience in our early games. I
am extremely confident that they

can do the job and that the team
can win consistently this year."
When pressed if that meant that
beating UCLA or USC would be a
possibility for the Indians this
year, Dallmar cautiously
reiterated, "I'm confident."

last year while averaging 18 points
a game.
These three will be backed by
juniors Bob Buell and Pat Stevens,
and by sophomore Steve Shupe.
Buell is an excellent shooter but
has been extremely injury prone
in the past. Stevens is a very
aggressive rebounder, while Shupe

is described by Dallmar as being
"as improved as any sophomore
I've ever coached."
Terry Outstanding
At the guards the Indians will
definitely start senior Claude
Terry, the greatest single season
scorer in Stanford history. Terry,
who averaged 21 points per game
last year, is a superb shooter, and
has the size and the moves which
make him a definite pro prospect.
At 6' 5" he is an adept ball
handler and a tough rebounder.
He will be joined in the
backcourt by either Pat Rusco,
John Stratton, Bob Nicholson,
Darrell Fregia or Gary Cain.
Dallmar says, "there will be
circumstances where certain
players will play against certain
teams." Rusco and Stratton are
both juniors and are referred to
by Dallmar as "strong-type
guards." They are both fine
shooters despite their rather poor
showings last year. Dallmar feels
that experience will cure this
problem.
Nicholson, a 6'o senior, is a
fine outside threat, and has
greatly improved over last year.
Fregia has likewise improved,
mainly because he has lost some
weight and has become much
quicker. Other guards who will see
action this year are 5' 9" senior
Gary Cain and 6' 3" junior Bruce
Menser.
Overall then, the word that
best describes the Indians is
improved. The big front line
should take the pressure off the
guards, and the increased overall
strength of the team will mean
that Dallmar will not be hesitant
to substitute. Dallmar notes, "The
big thing, of course, will be for
those four big men to get
experience in our early games. I
am extremely confident that they

can do the job and that the team
can win consistently this year."
When pressed if that meant that
beating UCLA or USC would be a
possibility for the Indians this
year, Dallmar cautiously
reiterated, "I'm confident."
Bolstered by the addition of
four excellent first year players,
Stanford's basketball prospects
for the 1971-1972 season are very
favorable. Coach Howie Dallmar
feels, "The team will be improved
in all aspects." He notes that,
"Defensively we will be able to
play a tough man to man,
offensively we will be able to run
more effectively, and in terms of
rebounding we should be
outstanding."
Much of what Dallmar says is
based on what he calls his
"strongest front line in years."
Most likely three first year players
will man the forward line when
the Indians open against Houston
on Dec. 1 at Maples Pavilion.
6' 11" Center
The probable starter at center
is 6' 11" Jack Loomis, a transfer
from Harvard. Loomis, an
adequate shooter, gives the Tribe
not only much needed rebounding
help, but also provides them with
the height needed to cope with
other teams' big men. Mike Mann,
a 6' 9" sophomore, will probably
start at forward along with Dave
Frost, a 6' 5" junior college
transfer.
Mann's strong point are
rebounding and defense. He is a
fair outside shooter, and is most
effective offensively when he
moves toward the basket. Frost,
who was named Most Valuable
Player in the State Junior College
Tournament last year, is termed
by Dallmar as "a smart, solid
ballplayer who does everything
well." He shot 65% from the field
last year while averaging 18 points
a game.
These three will be backed by
juniors Bob Buell and Pat Stevens,
and by sophomore Steve Shupe.
Buell is an excellent shooter but
has been extremely injury prone
in the past. Stevens is a very
aggressive rebounder, while Shupe

is described by Dallmar as being
