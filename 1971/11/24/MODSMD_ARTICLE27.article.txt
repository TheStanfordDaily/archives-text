Panel Backs Nominees
WASHINGTON — The Senate Judiciary Committee
Tuesday unanimously approved the Supreme Court
nomination of Lewis F. Powell Jr. and endorsed that of
William H. Rehnquist by a vote of 12 to 4. The
nominations will next be considered by the full Senate, but
not before late next week. The two court seats have been
vacant since early September.
The committee members who voted against Rehnquist, a
Stanford alumnus, were Birch Bayh (D-Ind.), Edward M.
Kennedy (D-Mass.), Philip Hart (D-Mich.), and John V.
Tunney (D-Calif.).
Senate Democratic leader Mike Mansfield, who controls
the Senate's agenda, said that the nominations will be the
last item of business this year. The session is expected to
wind up in mid-December.
Rehnquist, an aide to Attorney General John Mitchell,
was criticized during hearings on the nomination by labor
and civil rights groups. Powell, a Richmond, Virginia,
attorney, met no significant opposition.
So far none of the liberal Republican Senators who
opposed the earlier nominations of Clement Haynsworth
and G. Harrold Carswell to the Supreme Court, have
announced their opposition to Rehnquist.
India, Pakistan Battle
NEW DELHI — India claimed yesterday that its Gnat jets
downed three Pakistani warplanes over Indian territory and
both sides reported ground fighting in East Pakistan. The
Pakistanis said they were battling Indian invaders, but India
claimed East Pakistani rebels—not Indians—were involved.
India said it lost no planes in the dogfight. Pakistan
acknowledged two losses of its own and claimed two Indian
planes shot down.
Pakistani independence fighters in East Pakistan
described the fighting that began Monday as a do-or-die
battle to drive out the Pakistan army and establish an
independent Bangla Desh—Bengali nation—in East Pakistan.
The new flare-up between the subcontinent's two
nations is the out-growth of the East Pakistan secessionist
movement that has driven millions of refugees into India.
Defense Bill Approved
WASHINGTON - The Senate passed the massive $70.8
billion defense money bill last night after rejecting a
proposed 60,000-troop cut in U.S. European forces and
approving an added $500 million for military sles to Israel.
The vote was 80-5.
President Nixon emerged victorious on both of the key
policy issues involved in the bill: Europe and Indochina
For the second time in six months, the Senate upheld
the chief executive's European policies by rejecting a
proposal to cut U.S. troop strength from 130,000 to
250,000 by next June 15. The vote was 54-39.
The President won a second victory Tuesday, in effect,
when antiwar senators decided against offering an
amendment to cut off funds for Indochina war operations
except for U.S. withdrawal.
In another action the Senate moved by an 82-14 vote to
force the President to provide additional help for Israel by
approving $500 million in credits for the sale of F4
Phantom jets and other military weapons.
Mills, Nixon Discuss Taxes
WASHINGTON — Republican talk of a presidential veto of
the pending tax-cut bill was discounted yesterday by the
man who will have a large say in whether the legislation

includes the provision for federal financing of presidential
election campaigns.
President Nixon told Republican congressional leaders
yesterday that he would give serious thought to vetoing the
bill—despite his desire for business-stimulating tax cuts—if
it contains in its final form the campaign provision and
other sections increasing the size of the tax reduction.
But Rep. Wilbur D. Mills, D-Ark., chairman of the House
Ways and Means Committee, told newsmen late yesterday
afternoon that if it were vetoed it would be impossible to
pass another tax-cut measure this year and this would be a
severe jolt to the economy.
State Colleges 'Promoted'
LOS ANGELES — Governor Ronald Reagan announced
yesterday that he will sign a bill next Monday enabling the
19 state colleges campuses to be designated as "state
universities."
The measure would allow each campus to become a state
university if it meets certain criteria yet to be established
by the state college board of trustees and the state's
Coordinating Council for Higher Education.
David Brooks, a spokesman for the state college system,
and Reagan stressed that the function of the state colleges
would not change with the name.
"It is a name change only ... to give more prestige to
the system," Brooks said. "It doesn't mean the state
colleges will start going into Ph.D. programs or research and
professional areas we are not now in—like medicine or
law."
Bus, Train Fares Hiked
SAN FRANCISCO — Major rate increases for Pacific Gas &
Electric Co., the Southern Pacific, Greyhound Lines and
San Diego Gas & Electric Co., are among 44 granted by the
State Public Utilities Commission in the wake of the federal
price freeze.
All the increases approved Monday were those blocked
by the presidential wage-price order which expired Nov. 13,
a PUC spokesman said.
Southern Pacific got a 10 percent increase in San
Francisco Peninsula commuter fares, estimated to produce
about $400,000 a year, starting Dec. 19.
The commission said this still would leave the commuter
service $500,000 a year in the red.
Greyhound was given a statewide 6.5 percent boost in
freight and passenger charges.
Fares will go up after the company gives five-day public
notices.
Other increases included $17 million in gas rates for
PG&E, the last stage of a $36.8 million increase. It had
been approved last July to take effect Oct. 1. It now goes
into immediate effect.
S. Viets Invade Cambodia
SAIGON — South Vietnam launched a second major
offensive into Cambodia today (Vietnam time).
Thousands of troops moved across the border from
assembly points in the Mekong Delta, heading for a Mekong
River crossing point about 35 miles southeast of the
Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh.
Reports from Phnom Penh indicated, the initial drive,
which began Monday and is centered around the
Cambodian rubber plantation town of Krek, already had
lessened enemy pressure on Cambodia's northeastern front.
Both offensives are aimed at North Vietnamese
sanctuaries and supply depots.
South Vietnamese military sources said about 20,000
troops were committed to the two drives.
