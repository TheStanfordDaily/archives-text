# Money Donated For Field
## 
### 
A new informal playing field on campus is taking shape
as the gift of a former student body president as a
memorial to his father.
Adam Levin, a former member of the ASSU Council of
Presidents and now a Law student at the University of
Michigan, gave funds for the field as a memorial to his late
father, Phillip Jerome Levin, president of the Madison
Square Garden Corp.

The two-acre site, to be turfed and surrounded by trees
and hedges, is east of Florence Moore Hall, adjoining
Campus Drive. The area, 180 by 250 feet, will be used for
"touch football, softball, Frisbees, or just horsing around,"
according to the university Planning Office.
The site was selected to serve students in Flo Mo, the
Row and a nearby fraternity cluster, since at present, they
have no such open space for informal sports activities.
