# Lyman Reveals System, Hearing Officer Planned
## 
### DAVID THIEMANN 
Stanford's emergency judicial system
will use Bay Area attorneys as hearing
officers, and create a seven-member
panel to review facts and
recommendations submitted by the
hearing officer, President Richard
Lyman announced last night.
Speaking at a KZSU press
conference, Lyman said a roster of
hearing officers will be compiled by a
law school faculty committee.
Individual hearing officers will be
assigned to cases by the chairman of
the judicial panel, law professor John
Kaplan.
Under the new system, the hearing
officer will hear testimony pertaining
to the facts of a case, decide the facts,
and make a preliminary
recommendation to the panel
"concerning the applicability of
University regulations" to these facts.
The hearing officers, almost all of
whom will be professors from area law
schools (excluding Stanford), will
conduct open proceedings, unless the

defendant and the chairman of the
judicial panel agree to hold a closed
hearing.
The judicial panel will have three
faculty members, who have already
been appointed by the Faculty Senate
to the now-defunct Stanford Judicial
Council: Richard Brody (Political
Science), David Nivison (Philosophy),
and Robert White (Electrical
Engineering). Three student members,
selected at random from the student
body, and a chairman, who votes only
in case of a tie, complete the group.
After reviewing the hearing officer's
recommendations, the panel will
"consider the applicability of
University regulations," decide the
sentence to be imposed, and make
recommendations to the President.
According to Lyman, after receiving
the hearing officer's report, the panel
"will consider oral and written
argument on only two questions: Do
the facts as found by the hearing
officer constitute a violation of
University regulations, and if so, what
are the appropriate sanctions to be
applied?"
Rights Outlined
At trials before a hearing officer,
students will retain the rights "to be
informed of the charges, to hear and
answer evidence on which the charges
are based, to call and confront
witnesses, and to be considered
innocent until proven guilty beyond a

reasonable doubt."
The emergency judicial system is an
interim arrangement, Lyman
emphasized, only until the Committee
of 15 agrees on a permanent system
acceptable to the administration,
faculty, and ASSU Senate.
The new judicial system faces a
backlog of 16 cases, excluding Honor
Code violations, including 3 assaults, 3
forgeries, and 2 burglaries.
In a telephone interview Kaplan
observed that procedures using a
hearing officer are "a fairly common
kind of arrangement." He does not
expect a lengthy delay before the
system begins operation, because he
"can assign cases to hearing examiners
before students are appointed to the
panel."
Rules Decided
According to Lyman, the panel, in
consultation with the administration,
will decide the rules under which the
system will operate, using the previous
SJC rules as a basis for discussion.
Throughout his prepared statement,
Lyman repeated his reluctance to
invoke emergency powers under Article
IV of the Legislative and Judicial
Charter.
He also noted that, should students
honor the ASSU Senate's request that
all students refuse to participate in any
interim judicial process, a defendant
could be suspended until he agreed to
participate in a hearing.

Stanford's emergency judicial system
will use Bay Area attorneys as hearing
officers, and create a seven-member
panel to review facts and
recommendations submitted by the
hearing officer, President Richard
Lyman announced last night.
Speaking at a KZSU press
conference, Lyman said a roster of
hearing officers will be compiled by a
law school faculty committee.
Individual hearing officers will be
assigned to cases by the chairman of
the judicial panel, law professor John
Kaplan.
Under the new system, the hearing
officer will hear testimony pertaining
to the facts of a case, decide the facts,
and make a preliminary
recommendation to the panel
"concerning the applicability of
University regulations" to these facts.
The hearing officers, almost all of
whom will be professors from area law
schools (excluding Stanford), will
conduct open proceedings, unless the

defendant and the chairman of the
judicial panel agree to hold a closed
hearing.
The judicial panel will have three
faculty members, who have already
been appointed by the Faculty Senate
to the now-defunct Stanford Judicial
Council: Richard Brody (Political
Science), David Nivison (Philosophy),
and Robert White (Electrical
Engineering). Three student members,
selected at random from the student
body, and a chairman, who votes only
in case of a tie, complete the group.
After reviewing the hearing officer's
recommendations, the panel will
"consider the applicability of
University regulations," decide the
sentence to be imposed, and make
recommendations to the President.
According to Lyman, after receiving
the hearing officer's report, the panel
"will consider oral and written
argument on only two questions: Do
the facts as found by the hearing
officer constitute a violation of
University regulations, and if so, what
are the appropriate sanctions to be
applied?"
Rights Outlined
At trials before a hearing officer,
students will retain the rights "to be
informed of the charges, to hear and
answer evidence on which the charges
are based, to call and confront
witnesses, and to be considered
innocent until proven guilty beyond a

reasonable doubt."
The emergency judicial system is an
interim arrangement, Lyman
emphasized, only until the Committee
of 15 agrees on a permanent system
acceptable to the administration,
faculty, and ASSU Senate.
The new judicial system faces a
backlog of 16 cases, excluding Honor
Code violations, including 3 assaults, 3
forgeries, and 2 burglaries.
In a telephone interview Kaplan
observed that procedures using a
hearing officer are "a fairly common
kind of arrangement." He does not
expect a lengthy delay before the
system begins operation, because he
"can assign cases to hearing examiners
before students are appointed to the
panel."
Rules Decided
According to Lyman, the panel, in
consultation with the administration,
will decide the rules under which the
system will operate, using the previous
SJC rules as a basis for discussion.
Throughout his prepared statement,
Lyman repeated his reluctance to
invoke emergency powers under Article
IV of the Legislative and Judicial
Charter.
He also noted that, should students
honor the ASSU Senate's request that
all students refuse to participate in any
interim judicial process, a defendant
could be suspended until he agreed to
participate in a hearing.
