# Future Plans Shown In Survey Of Seniors
## 
### MADISON GROSE 
Ninety-two percent of the graduating
seniors responding to a recent survey
taken by the Academic Information
Center (AIC) have indicated their plans
to study in graduate school at some
future date.
The survey, the first of its kind for
AIC, and another, conducted for the
Offices of Graduate and Undergraduate
Studnes and the Alumni Association,
were based on the voluntary response
of graduating seniors to questionaires.
The AIC survey, conducted and
reported by George R. Hamrdla, former
director of AIC and now assistant dean
of Undergraduate Studies, elicited a 61

percent response from among the
graduating seniors.
The survey revealed that 50 percent
of the seniors planned to enroll in
graduate school this fall.
Roughly a third of the class expected
to begin a job after graduation, and
only five percent of the men indicated
that they expected to serve in the
armed forces.
Four percent of the seniors
responding indicated a desire to spend
the next year traveling.
Of the students responding, more
women (24 percent) than men (16
percent) plan to attend graduate school
to work towards Ph.D.s. Also, more
women (40 percent) than men (16
percent) desire to obtain a master's
degree.
Twenty-three percent of the men
and 13 percent of the women indicated
an interest in a law degree. An M.D.
was the goal of 15 percent of the men
and a mere four percent of women
respondants.
Eight percent of the respondants had
already been accepted by at least one
graduate school but had chosen not to
go this fall.
The survey also included detailed
information concerning specific schools
to which Stanford seniors had applied
for graduate study and the students'
success in admission and attaining
financial aid.
Hamrdla stresses that the survey
must be interpreted in light of the fact
that 39 percent of the students did not
respond and that "one thing we really
need, if anything, is better return." To
make the inferences from such surveys
increasingly accurate, Hamrdla and the
AIC is moving to improve the
questionnaire, the presentation of
results, the percentage of returned
questionnaires.
The second survey considered such
things as graduating seniors' responses
to various programs, their effectiveness
and the possibilities for improvement.
Such things as small seminar classes and
inter-personal relationships among
students were viewed as salient and
appealing by the graduates. Some
graduates criticized the advising
program, which has since been
revamped.
