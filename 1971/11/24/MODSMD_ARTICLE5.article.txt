# Sic, Transit Ferd, Friends
## 
### 
It was a crisp Autumn day .
Ferd Firko, frosh football freak,
was lured from his speeding
ten-speed by the seductive shrieks
of his favorite sport: a thapping,
slapping, crunching and groaning
that meant only one thing to
Firko.
And there she was, radiant in
the late afternoon sun, racing
downfield with a football tucked
under one of her firm, round
arms, leaving a pack of howling
gridders far behind.
"Get her, get her," they cried,
jumping up and down.
Ferd lept from his bicycle,
sped across the grass and flung his
manly young body at Dolly (for it
was she) in a flying tackle. She
went down on the one yard line.
No score.
"Hi there," Ferd panted.
"Member me?"
"How could I forget," Dolly
responded. "You wanna play?"
"Sure," Ferd said.
"Football," Dolly said.
Sure, football. As Ferd joined
the defensive huddle for the goal
line stand, he realized that there
was something funny about his
team. Small, long-haired, dressed
kind of ... My God, they were
girls! Firko had cracked the sex
barrier of the Powderpuff League
without a murmur of dissent.
Although there were murmurs.
T1 • girls filled in their new
recrui on the defensive set-up.
"They try to score and we try to
stop them," they explained.
"Sounds good," Ferd said. "I'll
cover Dolly." Disguising his
unholy leer as a friendly grin, he
lined up with his team mates for
the snap.
"1-4-9-16-25-36..
"Don't mind her, she's a math
major," Dolly whispered across
the line of scrimmage.
"I don't mind," Ferd replied,
though he was tired of crouching.
". . . 81-100-121..
Pain shot through Firko's
calves, and he could hear groans
from both squads.
". . .169-196-HIKE."
Both lines fell forward in acute
agony as the center rolled the ball
to the quarterback. Ferd regained
control of his cramped legs and
tackled Dolly.
"Hey, it's touch, not tackle."
"Gee, I'm sorry. Two-handed
touch?"
"Yes, but I don't think you're
supposed to tag me unless I've got
the ball."
"Just blocking you out of the
play honey."
Since Ferd's team had failed to
stand up, much less defend, a
quarterback sneak had scored
easily. His team took control on
their own 20 yard line.

Ferd grabbed the football.
"I'm quarterback chickies. Now
here's the play." He began to
tickle his palm suggestively. "You
over there start over here, then go
out ten steps, cut left three steps
and then cut right two steps and
then just streak. You go long; you
go short and buttonhook. You
two crisscross like this." He
pointed at his index finger,

decisively. "You in the tight
sweatshirt and grass-stained
hotpants just run straight up the
middle."
"No," she said. "I'll start here,
fake left and then flare right at
the big black dog, if he doesn't
move."
"Hey wait a second. Who's
quarterback on this team, chickie?
There's got to be discipline,
leadership."
"It's my pattern, so I should
get to decide how I want to do it.
Why should you decide just
because you grabbed the football
first and hogged it?"
"Well, what if the dog. . . ?"
"And Gloria doesn't want to
buttonhook, she wants to go
long."
Gloria, a short, wide girl in a
one-piece navy blue gym suit,
nodded shyly. "I was a starting
forward on the girls' field hockey
team in high school," she told
him.
"Great."
"Right inner forward. We were
undefeated my senior year." She
dimpled.
Somewhere a loudspeaker
crackled "They're breaking the
huddle now, fans, and Ferd Firko
is calling the signals. He's one of
the studliest freshmen ever to play
Powderpuff football and Stanford
has great hopes for his future."
"Hike." Receiversand defenders
trampled each other as Dolly ran
in to cover the quarterback.
"Rush me! Rush me!" he
moaned, holding the ball as bait.
"Well fans, young Firko has
been tackled behind the line of
scrimmage and there seems to be a
personal foul on the defense. . .by
the offense. It seems that young
Firko. . .no, it's declined.
"I was open," Gloria
complained, as they returned to
the huddle. "What were you
waiting for?"

"Sorry. This time we'll do the
triple reverse. I hand off to you
and you hand off to her and..
"What about me?" Gloria
interrupted.
"Okay, you pitch it out to
Gloria, and Gloria, you run."
Gloria shook her stubby legs in
joyous assent.
"Superstar Firko rallies his
team for the big push, fans. You

should all know that Firko is a
superstudent well as a superjock.
Passed all his midterms, almost.
Lockerroom chatter says he's
pre-med. He was captain of the
debate squad, senior class
treasqrer, and editor of the
yearbook in high school. Firko is
still looking for his first down."
"Hike. Crunch. Trample."
"... and now five girls are
running at him from opposite
directions, fighting for the ball. It
looks like a reverse. Well it doesn't
look much like a reverse. Wait,
there's a pitchout, she's in the
clear, and there goes Gloria
MundyV
"Touchdown," Dolly
murmured to her battered
admirer.
"Uh," he grunted.
"I hope you'll be all right," she

said brightly. "Sorry I have to
leave when you're down."
"Uh?"
"I've got a hct date with the
Mad Rapist. We're going to study
in his secluded single in Flo Mo."
"Study what?"
"Human biologv."
"Uh!"
"He's a sophomore from
Dinuba, pre-med like you, Ferd.
Really a sweet guy, you ought to
meet him. Well, I've got to run
now."
So she did. Sic transit.
Ferd Firko, phantom stud of
Stanford, chewed on a blade of
grass as Dolly disappeared into the
gloaming. Soon only the dumpy
figure of Gloria Mundy could be
seen, jogging towards Hoover
Tower with the powderpuffs in
pursuit."
"Gollygee," Ferd thought.
"There goes Gloria Mundy."

fake left and then flare right at
the big black dog, if he doesn't
move."
"Hey wait a second. Who's
quarterback on this team, chickie?
There's got to be discipline,
leadership."
"It's my pattern, so I should
get to decide how I want to do it.
Why should you decide just
because you grabbed the football
first and hogged it?"
"Well, what if the dog. . . ?"
"And Gloria doesn't want to
buttonhook, she wants to go
long."
Gloria, a short, wide girl in a
one-piece navy blue gym suit,
nodded shyly. "I was a starting
forward on the girls' field hockey
team in high school," she told
him.
"Great."
"Right inner forward. We were
undefeated my senior year." She
dimpled.
Somewhere a loudspeaker
crackled "They're breaking the
huddle now, fans, and Ferd Firko
is calling the signals. He's one of
the studliest freshmen ever to play
Powderpuff football and Stanford
has great hopes for his future."
"Hike." Receiversand defenders
trampled each other as Dolly ran
in to cover the quarterback.
"Rush me! Rush me!" he
moaned, holding the ball as bait.
"Well fans, young Firko has
been tackled behind the line of
scrimmage and there seems to be a
personal foul on the defense. . .by
the offense. It seems that young
Firko. . .no, it's declined.
"I was open," Gloria
complained, as they returned to
the huddle. "What were you
waiting for?"

"Sorry. This time we'll do the
triple reverse. I hand off to you
and you hand off to her and..
"What about me?" Gloria
interrupted.
"Okay, you pitch it out to
Gloria, and Gloria, you run."
Gloria shook her stubby legs in
joyous assent.
"Superstar Firko rallies his
team for the big push, fans. You

should all know that Firko is a
superstudent well as a superjock.
Passed all his midterms, almost.
Lockerroom chatter says he's
pre-med. He was captain of the
debate squad, senior class
treasqrer, and editor of the
yearbook in high school. Firko is
still looking for his first down."
"Hike. Crunch. Trample."
"... and now five girls are
running at him from opposite
directions, fighting for the ball. It
looks like a reverse. Well it doesn't
look much like a reverse. Wait,
there's a pitchout, she's in the
clear, and there goes Gloria
MundyV
"Touchdown," Dolly
murmured to her battered
admirer.
"Uh," he grunted.
"I hope you'll be all right," she

said brightly. "Sorry I have to
leave when you're down."
"Uh?"
"I've got a hct date with the
Mad Rapist. We're going to study
in his secluded single in Flo Mo."
"Study what?"
"Human biologv."
"Uh!"
"He's a sophomore from
Dinuba, pre-med like you, Ferd.
Really a sweet guy, you ought to
meet him. Well, I've got to run
now."
So she did. Sic transit.
Ferd Firko, phantom stud of
Stanford, chewed on a blade of
grass as Dolly disappeared into the
gloaming. Soon only the dumpy
figure of Gloria Mundy could be
seen, jogging towards Hoover
Tower with the powderpuffs in
pursuit."
"Gollygee," Ferd thought.
"There goes Gloria Mundy."

VJUCOMfS:
jSwiwilt'P -
It was a crisp Autumn day .
Ferd Firko, frosh football freak,
was lured from his speeding
ten-speed by the seductive shrieks
of his favorite sport: a thapping,
slapping, crunching and groaning
that meant only one thing to
Firko.
And there she was, radiant in
the late afternoon sun, racing
downfield with a football tucked
under one of her firm, round
arms, leaving a pack of howling
gridders far behind.
"Get her, get her," they cried,
jumping up and down.
Ferd lept from his bicycle,
sped across the grass and flung his
manly young body at Dolly (for it
was she) in a flying tackle. She
went down on the one yard line.
No score.
"Hi there," Ferd panted.
"Member me?"
"How could I forget," Dolly
responded. "You wanna play?"
"Sure," Ferd said.
"Football," Dolly said.
Sure, football. As Ferd joined
the defensive huddle for the goal
line stand, he realized that there
was something funny about his
team. Small, long-haired, dressed
kind of ... My God, they were
girls! Firko had cracked the sex
barrier of the Powderpuff League
without a murmur of dissent.
Although there were murmurs.
T1 • girls filled in their new
recrui on the defensive set-up.
"They try to score and we try to
stop them," they explained.
"Sounds good," Ferd said. "I'll
cover Dolly." Disguising his
unholy leer as a friendly grin, he
lined up with his team mates for
the snap.
"1-4-9-16-25-36..
"Don't mind her, she's a math
major," Dolly whispered across
the line of scrimmage.
"I don't mind," Ferd replied,
though he was tired of crouching.
". . . 81-100-121..
Pain shot through Firko's
calves, and he could hear groans
from both squads.
". . .169-196-HIKE."
Both lines fell forward in acute
agony as the center rolled the ball
to the quarterback. Ferd regained
control of his cramped legs and
tackled Dolly.
"Hey, it's touch, not tackle."
"Gee, I'm sorry. Two-handed
touch?"
"Yes, but I don't think you're
supposed to tag me unless I've got
the ball."
"Just blocking you out of the
play honey."
Since Ferd's team had failed to
stand up, much less defend, a
quarterback sneak had scored
easily. His team took control on
their own 20 yard line.

Ferd grabbed the football.
"I'm quarterback chickies. Now
here's the play." He began to
tickle his palm suggestively. "You
over there start over here, then go
out ten steps, cut left three steps
and then cut right two steps and
then just streak. You go long; you
go short and buttonhook. You
two crisscross like this." He
pointed at his index finger,

decisively. "You in the tight
sweatshirt and grass-stained
hotpants just run straight up the
middle."
"No," she said. "I'll start here,
fake left and then flare right at
the big black dog, if he doesn't
move."

meet him. Well, I've got to run
now."
So she did. Sic transit.
Ferd Firko, phantom stud of
Stanford, chewed on a blade of
grass as Dolly disappeared into the
gloaming. Soon only the dumpy
figure of Gloria Mundy could be
seen, jogging towards Hoover
Tower with the powderpuffs in
pursuit."
"Gollygee," Ferd thought.
"There goes Gloria Mundy."

VJUCOMfS:
jSwiwilt'P -
It was a crisp Autumn day .
Ferd Firko, frosh football freak,
was lured from his speeding
ten-speed by the seductive shrieks
of his favorite sport: a thapping,
slapping, crunching and groaning
that meant only one thing to
Firko.
And there she was, radiant in
the late afternoon sun, racing
downfield with a football tucked
under one of her firm, round
arms, leaving a pack of howling
gridders far behind.
"Get her, get her," they cried,
jumping up and down.
Ferd lept from his bicycle,
sped across the grass and flung his
manly young body at Dolly (for it
was she) in a flying tackle. She
went down on the one yard line.
No score.
"Hi there," Ferd panted.
"Member me?"
"How could I forget," Dolly
responded. "You wanna play?"
"Sure," Ferd said.
"Football," Dolly said.
Sure, football. As Ferd joined
the defensive huddle for the goal
line stand, he realized that there
was something funny about his
team. Small, long-haired, dressed
kind of ... My God, they were
girls! Firko had cracked the sex
barrier of the Powderpuff League
without a murmur of dissent.
Although there were murmurs.
T1 • girls filled in their new
recrui on the defensive set-up.
"They try to score and we try to
stop them," they explained.
"Sounds good," Ferd said. "I'll
cover Dolly." Disguising his
unholy leer as a friendly grin, he
lined up with his team mates for
the snap.
"1-4-9-16-25-36..
"Don't mind her, she's a math
major," Dolly whispered across
the line of scrimmage.
"I don't mind," Ferd replied,
though he was tired of crouching.
". . . 81-100-121..
Pain shot through Firko's
calves, and he could hear groans
from both squads.
". . .169-196-HIKE."
Both lines fell forward in acute
agony as the center rolled the ball
to the quarterback. Ferd regained
control of his cramped legs and
tackled Dolly.
"Hey, it's touch, not tackle."
"Gee, I'm sorry. Two-handed
touch?"
"Yes, but I don't think you're
supposed to tag me unless I've got
the ball."
"Just blocking you out of the
play honey."
Since Ferd's team had failed to
stand up, much less defend, a
quarterback sneak had scored
easily. His team took control on
their own 20 yard line.

Ferd grabbed the football.
"I'm quarterback chickies. Now
here's the play." He began to
tickle his palm suggestively. "You
over there start over here, then go
out ten steps, cut left three steps
and then cut right two steps and
then just streak. You go long; you
go short and buttonhook. You
two crisscross like this." He
pointed at his index finger,

decisively. "You in the tight
sweatshirt and grass-stained
hotpants just run straight up the
middle."
"No," she said. "I'll start here,
fake left and then flare right at
the big black dog, if he doesn't
move."
"Hey wait a second. Who's
quarterback on this team, chickie?
There's got to be discipline,
leadership."
"It's my pattern, so I should
get to decide how I want to do it.
Why should you decide just
because you grabbed the football
first and hogged it?"
"Well, what if the dog. . . ?"
"And Gloria doesn't want to
buttonhook, she wants to go
long."
Gloria, a short, wide girl in a
one-piece navy blue gym suit,
nodded shyly. "I was a starting
forward on the girls' field hockey
team in high school," she told
him.
"Great."
"Right inner forward. We were
undefeated my senior year." She
dimpled.
Somewhere a loudspeaker
crackled "They're breaking the
huddle now, fans, and Ferd Firko
is calling the signals. He's one of
the studliest freshmen ever to play
Powderpuff football and Stanford
has great hopes for his future."
"Hike." Receiversand defenders
trampled each other as Dolly ran
in to cover the quarterback.
"Rush me! Rush me!" he
moaned, holding the ball as bait.
"Well fans, young Firko has
been tackled behind the line of
scrimmage and there seems to be a
personal foul on the defense. . .by
the offense. It seems that young
Firko. . .no, it's declined.
"I was open," Gloria
complained, as they returned to
the huddle. "What were you
waiting for?"

"Sorry. This time we'll do the
triple reverse. I hand off to you
and you hand off to her and..
"What about me?" Gloria
interrupted.
"Okay, you pitch it out to
Gloria, and Gloria, you run."
Gloria shook her stubby legs in
joyous assent.
"Superstar Firko rallies his
team for the big push, fans. You

should all know that Firko is a
superstudent well as a superjock.
Passed all his midterms, almost.
Lockerroom chatter says he's
pre-med. He was captain of the
debate squad, senior class
treasqrer, and editor of the
yearbook in high school. Firko is
still looking for his first down."
"Hike. Crunch. Trample."
"... and now five girls are
running at him from opposite
directions, fighting for the ball. It
looks like a reverse. Well it doesn't
look much like a reverse. Wait,
there's a pitchout, she's in the
clear, and there goes Gloria
MundyV
"Touchdown," Dolly
murmured to her battered
admirer.
"Uh," he grunted.
"I hope you'll be all right," she

said brightly. "Sorry I have to
leave when you're down."
"Uh?"
"I've got a hct date with the
Mad Rapist. We're going to study
in his secluded single in Flo Mo."
"Study what?"
"Human biologv."
"Uh!"
"He's a sophomore from
Dinuba, pre-med like you, Ferd.
Really a sweet guy, you ought to
meet him. Well, I've got to run
now."

"I'm quarterback chickies. Now
here's the play." He began to
tickle his palm suggestively. "You
over there start over here, then go
out ten steps, cut left three steps
and then cut right two steps and
then just streak. You go long; you
go short and buttonhook. You
two crisscross like this." He
pointed at his index finger,

decisively. "You in the tight
sweatshirt and grass-stained
hotpants just run straight up the
middle."
"No," she said. "I'll start here,
fake left and then flare right at
the big black dog, if he doesn't
move."
"Hey wait a second. Who's
quarterback on this team, chickie?
There's got to be discipline,
leadership."
"It's my pattern, so I should
get to decide how I want to do it.
Why should you decide just
because you grabbed the football
first and hogged it?"
"Well, what if the dog. . . ?"
"And Gloria doesn't want to
buttonhook, she wants to go
long."
Gloria, a short, wide girl in a
one-piece navy blue gym suit,
nodded shyly. "I was a starting
forward on the girls' field hockey
team in high school," she told
him.
"Great."
"Right inner forward. We were
undefeated my senior year." She
dimpled.
Somewhere a loudspeaker
crackled "They're breaking the
huddle now, fans, and Ferd Firko
is calling the signals. He's one of
the studliest freshmen ever to play
Powderpuff football and Stanford
has great hopes for his future."
"Hike." Receiversand defenders
trampled each other as Dolly ran
in to cover the quarterback.
"Rush me! Rush me!" he
moaned, holding the ball as bait.
"Well fans, young Firko has
been tackled behind the line of
scrimmage and there seems to be a
personal foul on the defense. . .by
the offense. It seems that young
Firko. . .no, it's declined.
"I was open," Gloria
complained, as they returned to
the huddle. "What were you
waiting for?"

"Sorry. This time we'll do the
triple reverse. I hand off to you
and you hand off to her and..
"What about me?" Gloria
interrupted.
"Okay, you pitch it out to
Gloria, and Gloria, you run."
Gloria shook her stubby legs in
joyous assent.
"Superstar Firko rallies his
team for the big push, fans. You

should all know that Firko is a
superstudent well as a superjock.
Passed all his midterms, almost.
Lockerroom chatter says he's
pre-med. He was captain of the
debate squad, senior class
treasqrer, and editor of the
yearbook in high school. Firko is
still looking for his first down."
"Hike. Crunch. Trample."
"... and now five girls are
running at him from opposite
directions, fighting for the ball. It
looks like a reverse. Well it doesn't
look much like a reverse. Wait,
there's a pitchout, she's in the
clear, and there goes Gloria
MundyV
"Touchdown," Dolly
murmured to her battered
admirer.
"Uh," he grunted.
"I hope you'll be all right," she

said brightly. "Sorry I have to
leave when you're down."
"Uh?"
"I've got a hct date with the
Mad Rapist. We're going to study
in his secluded single in Flo Mo."
"Study what?"
"Human biologv."
"Uh!"
"He's a sophomore from
Dinuba, pre-med like you, Ferd.
Really a sweet guy, you ought to
meet him. Well, I've got to run
now."
So she did. Sic transit.
Ferd Firko, phantom stud of
Stanford, chewed on a blade of
grass as Dolly disappeared into the
gloaming. Soon only the dumpy
figure of Gloria Mundy could be
seen, jogging towards Hoover
Tower with the powderpuffs in
pursuit."
"Gollygee," Ferd thought.
"There goes Gloria Mundy."
