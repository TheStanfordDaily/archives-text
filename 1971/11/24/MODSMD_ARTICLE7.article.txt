## Stimulating Seditive

There presently exists a contract involving
Stanford University and the U.S. Army Medical
Research and Development Command, entitled
"Analgesic Compound without Sedative Effects".
The terms of this contract are being carried out
through the Stanford Medical School.
Though rather small by Stanford Department of
Defense norms, this contract illustrates several
concepts pertinent to any consideration of
Stanford's relationship with the Department of
Defense.
These conceps are: a number of researchers are
less than satisfied with the present mechanisms for
research funding, with particular referance to the
Department of Defense, and more importantly even
the principal investigator on a given contract is not
necessarily aware of the full military implications of
his work.
According to the contract proposal for June 1,
1970 to May 31, 1971, "Our main objective is to
obtain a combined dose of morphene and
dextroamphetamine which could provide analgesia
for the soldier in the field without impairment of
the mobility and alertness of the soldier.
The concept is to offset the severely depressive,
incapacitating side effects of that excellent
pain-killer, morphene, by providing a countervailing
stimulant; dextroamphetamine. The applications of
this concept are made even more clear by another
passage from the proposal, "If a soldier is wounded
in combat such as that experienced in Vietnam,
medication with morphene and dextroamphetamine
may facilitate his ability to complete a mission .. .
the chances for successful completion of a mission
and survival might be greatly augmented by the use
of this type of combination of analgesic and
stimulant."
These passages, signed by the principal
investigator Dr. William Forrest, are made yet more
ominous when one reads from the Department of

Defense's own DDC Statement, "This item will be
used primarily by small combat units operating
some distance from field medical support."
As any former Army medic will testify, the
primary charge of a medic in the field is "to
maintain the combat effectiveness" of the unit; a
task to which the pain-killer described above may be
grotesquely well suited.
When asked directly about his work, Dr. Forrest
stated that he went to the Department of Defense
only because they could supply him with the drugs
needed for his investigation, and that the entire cost
of his work in this area far exceeds his Department
of Defense funding. He further maintained that his
objective was not as expressed in the proposal, and
that in fact he did not believe that the drug would
enhance "the chances for successful completion of a
mission".
Questioned concerning these contradictory
assessments of his own work, Dr. Forrest answered
that the proposal had been written in light of the
realities of the Department of Defense funding
mechanisms. He went on to say that although he
was not happy about having to write a misleading
proposal, he is, in fact, presently able to carry on his
research.
Finally, Dr. Forrest agreed that while he is
interested in specific non-military applications of
the drug combination, it is quite possible that Army
personnel may be aware of military uses akin to
those in his own proposal.
From speaking to Dr. Forrest, I feel that he has
no desire to aid the Army in creating fighting
zombies from wounded men. The Army, however,
may well be using Dr. Forrest and our facilities at
Stanford to further just such a project. The Young
Crows would appreciate any information, medical
or otherwise, pertinent to this work.

task to which the pain-killer described above may be
grotesquely well suited.
When asked directly about his work, Dr. Forrest
stated that he went to the Department of Defense
only because they could supply him with the drugs
needed for his investigation, and that the entire cost
of his work in this area far exceeds his Department
of Defense funding. He further maintained that his
objective was not as expressed in the proposal, and
that in fact he did not believe that the drug would
enhance "the chances for successful completion of a
mission".
Questioned concerning these contradictory
assessments of his own work, Dr. Forrest answered
that the proposal had been written in light of the
realities of the Department of Defense funding
mechanisms. He went on to say that although he
was not happy about having to write a misleading
proposal, he is, in fact, presently able to carry on his
research.
Finally, Dr. Forrest agreed that while he is
interested in specific non-military applications of
the drug combination, it is quite possible that Army
personnel may be aware of military uses akin to
those in his own proposal.
From speaking to Dr. Forrest, I feel that he has
no desire to aid the Army in creating fighting
zombies from wounded men. The Army, however,
may well be using Dr. Forrest and our facilities at
Stanford to further just such a project. The Young
Crows would appreciate any information, medical
or otherwise, pertinent to this work.

There presently exists a contract involving
Stanford University and the U.S. Army Medical
Research and Development Command, entitled
"Analgesic Compound without Sedative Effects".
The terms of this contract are being carried out
through the Stanford Medical School.
Though rather small by Stanford Department of
Defense norms, this contract illustrates several
concepts pertinent to any consideration of
Stanford's relationship with the Department of
Defense.
These conceps are: a number of researchers are
less than satisfied with the present mechanisms for
research funding, with particular referance to the
Department of Defense, and more importantly even
the principal investigator on a given contract is not
necessarily aware of the full military implications of
his work.
According to the contract proposal for June 1,
1970 to May 31, 1971, "Our main objective is to
obtain a combined dose of morphene and
dextroamphetamine which could provide analgesia
for the soldier in the field without impairment of
the mobility and alertness of the soldier.
The concept is to offset the severely depressive,
incapacitating side effects of that excellent
pain-killer, morphene, by providing a countervailing
stimulant; dextroamphetamine. The applications of
this concept are made even more clear by another
passage from the proposal, "If a soldier is wounded
in combat such as that experienced in Vietnam,
medication with morphene and dextroamphetamine
may facilitate his ability to complete a mission .. .
the chances for successful completion of a mission
and survival might be greatly augmented by the use
of this type of combination of analgesic and
stimulant."
These passages, signed by the principal
investigator Dr. William Forrest, are made yet more
ominous when one reads from the Department of

Defense's own DDC Statement, "This item will be
used primarily by small combat units operating
some distance from field medical support."
As any former Army medic will testify, the
primary charge of a medic in the field is "to
maintain the combat effectiveness" of the unit; a
task to which the pain-killer described above may be
grotesquely well suited.
