# N.Y. Cops Prove They Can Take It
## 
### 
New York City is something of
a jungle. Within a 30-mile radius,
roughly the distance from Palo
Alto to San Francisco, live 16
million people, making Greater
New York the largest
metropolitan region in the world.
The city itself is home to
nearly 8 million people, with
several million transients entering
Manhattan each day for work or
entertainment. Overseeing this ant
hill is a police force of 32,000,
New York's Finest.
Until last month. There's still
32,000 of them but the phrase
"New York's finest" is beginning
to stick in the throat.
According to the Knapp
Commission, a blue-ribbon panel
chaired by Wall Street Attorney
Whitman Knapp that has
conducted an 18-month
investigation of the NYPD, the
New York police are as crooked as
a three dollar bill.
Everyone acknowledges that
cops, like everyone else, are
susceptible to lapses of morality.
Every officer accepts an
occasional cup of coffee from the
restaurant on his beat. But the
Knapp Commission disclosed that
the quality of restaurant was on
the upswing.
According to the Commission,
in a five month period the New
York Hilton treated 4 inspectors,
8 sergeants, 6 captains, 32
detectives, 14 lieutenants and 16
patrolmen to a total of 144
meals on the house. At an average
price of $19.30 a serving, that
came out to $4,662.77, which is
some cup of coffee.
The New York Hilton wasn't
pioneering in contributing to the
delinquency of a policeman. Six
other hotels investigated by the
commission, the Taft, the Park
Sheraton, the Americana, the
Statler Hilton, the Loew's
Midtown Motor Inn, and the
Holiday Inn of LaGuardia, also
contributed free room and board,
to the tune of $60,000 a year.
While this is an impressive
statistic, quite a move up from the
old apple-off-the-pushcart, it turns
out to be but a drop in the
bucket. It appears that the
Patrolmen's Benevolent
Association, the "union" of New
York uniformed police, is one of
the more successful examples of
organized crime in America, a sort
of blue-clad Irish Cosa Nostra,

challanging the sophistication of
the Italian model in almost all
departments.
They're even in the same
business. Take shake-downs, for
instance. According to one of the
Knapp witnesses, only two of 75
patrolmen assigned to the
Bedford-Stuyvesant ghetto of
Brooklyn were not regularly "on
the take." Check-cashing
establishments, gamblers,
tow-truck operators, and

supermarket managers were
favorite targets.
Witnesses testified that
virtually every gambling
enforcement unit in the city
receives regular monthly pay-offs.
Bribes paid to plainclothesmen
vary from an average of $400 in
midtown Manhattan to $1500 in
East Harlem.
According to a building
contractor whose identity was
protected by the Commission,
"there is not a single project in
the city of New York that is put
up without paying the police." It
was estimated that 5 to 10 per
cent of construction costs in New
York goes to bribing cops. Based
on a total annual dollar value of
construction in New York of $1.5
billion, that comes out to over
$75 million per year.
The corruption, says the
commission, "must be
characterized as extensive." It can
also be rather nasty. One of the
witnesses is a gutsy fellow named
George Burkert, who drives a
tow-truck for a living, and doesn't
believe in bribing policemen.
According to Burkert, it is
customary for a tow-truck
operator to slip an officer at least
$10 for the right to tow a car
from the scene of an accident.
When Burkert refused to pay,
the word got around, and he
began to receive a large number of
tickets. He told of one 26-minute
period in which he received 13
summonses, and another time in

which he was cited for jumping a
red light while he was standing on
the sidewalk beside his parked
truck.
When Burkert complained of
harrassment, a police captain went
to his employer and had him
fired. At that, Burkert went to the
Knapp investigators and became
an undercover agent, collecting
information on further
shakedown attempts.
But the bribes and shakedowns

are pecadillos compared to the
financial activities of the narcotics
squad. According to the
commission, it is not uncommon
for narcotics detectives to barter
confiscated heroine for stolen
goods. The detective tells his
undercover informant (an addict
assigned to the detective for
intelligence work)-what he wants,
a deal is negotiated, and the
merchandise exchanged. Favorite
items for trade are power tools,
liquor, cigarettes, and motorbikes.
Occassionally the detective
haggles over brands. One officer
requested 12 bottles of liquor for
his daughter's shower, including
two bottles of 100 proof
Smirnoff, two bottles of Harvey's
Bristol Cream and two bottles of
Jack Daniels.
In one narcotics unit there was
a discrepency of 68V4 pounds of
heroin between that seized in
raids and that delivered to the
police laboratory for analysis; a
street value of $7 million dollars
in smack, disappearing into the
night someplace between the
station house and the lab.
Another witness was Waverly
Logan, a former member of the
elite Preventive Enforcement
Patrol, whose 20 black and Puerto
Rican officers are specifically
charged with cracking down on
street crime in Harlem. According
to the former patrolman, although
two of the 20 men didn't actively
solicit bribes, "there was nobody
who wouldn't take money."
How much money? "I would
say the good scorers, the heavy
scorers, may make about $3,000.
The average like myself was about

$1,500."
That's per month. Good pay
for Civil Service.
These are some of the
highlights of the Knapp hearings,
which went on for nine days last
October in the offices of the
American Bar Association in New
York. The picture that developed
was of a police department so
thoroughly rotten that it was
amazing any suspect was ever
brought to justice — any kind of
justice.
The Knapp Commission
technique of dramatic open
hearings was designed for shock
value. Broadcast live over radio
and the local educational TV
station, the hearings reached into
every home in the Metropolitan
Area with the message, "you get
the police force you deserve."
But does the police force
deserve the Knapp Commission?
The cops themselves are
understandably skeptical. Edward
J. Kiernan, President of the
Patrolmen's Benevolent
Association, blames it all on a bid
for national publicity by New
York Mayor John Lindsay. (It
should be noted that everything
unpleasant that happens in New
York is blamed on Lindsay. In
1969 he was held responsible for a
sudden snow storm.)
Lindsay, who is probably sick
of being Mayor of New York and
is looking south toward a
four-year White House vacation,
would probably be better off with
another snow storm than with the
Knapp Commission. Although he
is officially responsible for its
creation, the real initiative came
from two cops, Sergeant David
Durk and Detective Frank
Serpico, who think that police
should live on modest incomes.
Durk and Serpico went to
high-ranking Lindsay aides with
tales of widespread corruption,
but were told to get lost. Instead,
they went to the New York
Times. When the Lindsay
Administration heard that the
Times was about to break the
story, an investigating committee
was hurridly formed. The Knapp
Commission, headed by Wall
Street Attorney Whitman Knapp,
was created a month later.
The Knapp Commission
hearings are scheduled to resume
again next week, with Lindsay
officials on the stand to explain
why they didn't investigate the
corruption charges when Durk
and Serpico first brought them to
their attention. It's unlikely that

Lindsay will relish this particular
national publicity.
Another party unhappy with
the Knapp proceedings is the New
York Civil Liberties union, which
condemns "trial by public
exposure — the maligning of
whole classes of people without
any opportunity to cross-examine
their accusers." The whole affair,
they claim, smells of
McCarthyism.
Then there are the other
uniformed patrolmen in New
York, the Housing Authority
Police, the Sanitation Police, and
the Transit Police, who are all
administratively separate from the
NYPD and not under investigation
by the Knapp Commission.
Says one Transit Authority cop
who patrols the Times Square
subway station, "Down here in
the hole, how the hell can we take
any graft? There's no freebies
underground. But the public don't
realize this. Far's they're
concerned, I'm just another
crooked cop."
And then there's the public
itself. The Knapp Commission
findings imply that your local
policeman shouldn't be trusted
with grandma's false teeth. Yet
every day cops go out and get
themselves beat up and shot
protecting citizens from the
people they are ripping off. It's a
strange kind of schizophrenia.
The New York Police are good.
They have one of the highest pay
scales in the nation, one of the
toughest towns to patrol. Their
beat runs from the dregs of the
country's most miserable ghettos,
to the 131 United Nations
embassies.
They are capable of dedicated
service. Twelve have been killed
this year in the line of duty. Two
detectives recently tracked down
the murderers of an old lady, after
working for 15 hours a day, seven
days a week, for almost two
months, largely on their own
time.
Are these the kind of men to
take bribes, to protect dope
pushers, to shakedown
supermarket clerks? Probably not,
but there are enough of their
colleagues who are to give the
whole department a slightly
rotten smell.
As Whitman Knapp himself
says, "Corrupt or not, the police
respond to duty. If anything
happened where I was in trouble,
I would have absolutely no
hesitancy in dialing 911 (the New
York emergency number] and
being certain that the men would
react."
Knapp's probably right, but if I
were he, I might toy with the idea
of using a different name until
after the squad car had arrived.
