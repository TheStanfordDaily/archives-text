## Revamp The SJC 
### 
The Student Senate's decision Thursday night to boycott the
Stanford Judicial Council was only the latest in the SJC's long history
of crises. The propriety of the Senate's action is not the crucial
question. More important, last week's events have hastened the
long-overdue revamping of the entire judicial process.
The Committee of Fifteen (C-15), which frames amendments to
the judicial charter, is considering reforms recommended in last year's
student referendum. But each proposal raises important questions
which cannot be handled by piecemeal committee work.
Student critics of the SJC have posed basic challenges: Should the
SJC have jurisdiction over faculty members? If not, should students
be judged only by other students? Should President Lyman retain his
veto power over SJC decisions? Should students facing criminal
charges be prosecuted for the same act by a university judicial
procedure?
Candid administrators admit that they themselves have objections
to the present SJC. They are about to run out of law professors who
can be talked into taking the miserable job of SJC chairman.
Administrators say that SJC members are swamped by a stream of
complicated cases which they have neither the time nor the expertise
to handle. And administrators want to restrict the student
government's role to prevent a repetition of the current boycott.
In the past, the Committee of 15 has moved ploddingly through
even the most minor amendments. It has been slowed by its own
unwieldy size, the complexity of the judicial system, and delaying
tactics of both students and administrators.
But now, the Committee of 15 must move boldly to shape a new
judicial process. C-15 should express its own commitment to a
top-to-bottom study of the campus legal system. It should fully
inform the public of its reasoning as each step of the new system takes
shape.
The C-15 should hold public hearings and forums so that the
community can fully contribute to the philosophy and mechanics of a
workable judicial process.
There are estimates that it may take a year or more to build a new
Stanford court. The C-15's amendments must be approved by
students, faculty, and administrators before taking effect.
In the meantime, there is a substantial backlog of cases awaiting
adjudication. Some of the defendants have asked to have their cases
expedited, while others oppose participation in an interim process.
Because we have not yet had the opportunity to study the interim
procedures in detail, we are unable to state our opinions at this time
concerning the specific temporary system announced last night by
President Lyman.
We can say that we believe that administrators should be careful to
remember the interim status of any presidentially-ordered court. Its
procedures should remain flexible, open to improvements suggested
by any segment of the community.

But now, the Committee of 15 must move boldly to shape a new
judicial process. C-15 should express its own commitment to a
top-to-bottom study of the campus legal system. It should fully
inform the public of its reasoning as each step of the new system takes
shape.
The C-15 should hold public hearings and forums so that the
community can fully contribute to the philosophy and mechanics of a
workable judicial process.
There are estimates that it may take a year or more to build a new
Stanford court. The C-15's amendments must be approved by
students, faculty, and administrators before taking effect.
In the meantime, there is a substantial backlog of cases awaiting
adjudication. Some of the defendants have asked to have their cases
expedited, while others oppose participation in an interim process.
Because we have not yet had the opportunity to study the interim
procedures in detail, we are unable to state our opinions at this time
concerning the specific temporary system announced last night by
President Lyman.
We can say that we believe that administrators should be careful to
remember the interim status of any presidentially-ordered court. Its
procedures should remain flexible, open to improvements suggested
by any segment of the community.
The Student Senate's decision Thursday night to boycott the
Stanford Judicial Council was only the latest in the SJC's long history
of crises. The propriety of the Senate's action is not the crucial
question. More important, last week's events have hastened the
long-overdue revamping of the entire judicial process.
The Committee of Fifteen (C-15), which frames amendments to
the judicial charter, is considering reforms recommended in last year's
student referendum. But each proposal raises important questions
which cannot be handled by piecemeal committee work.
Student critics of the SJC have posed basic challenges: Should the
SJC have jurisdiction over faculty members? If not, should students
be judged only by other students? Should President Lyman retain his
veto power over SJC decisions? Should students facing criminal
charges be prosecuted for the same act by a university judicial
procedure?
Candid administrators admit that they themselves have objections
to the present SJC. They are about to run out of law professors who
can be talked into taking the miserable job of SJC chairman.
Administrators say that SJC members are swamped by a stream of
complicated cases which they have neither the time nor the expertise
to handle. And administrators want to restrict the student
government's role to prevent a repetition of the current boycott.
In the past, the Committee of 15 has moved ploddingly through
even the most minor amendments. It has been slowed by its own
unwieldy size, the complexity of the judicial system, and delaying
tactics of both students and administrators.
But now, the Committee of 15 must move boldly to shape a new
judicial process. C-15 should express its own commitment to a
top-to-bottom study of the campus legal system. It should fully
inform the public of its reasoning as each step of the new system takes
