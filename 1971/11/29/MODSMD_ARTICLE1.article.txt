# University Opens Band To Women
## 
### FRANK MILLER 
The Incomparable Stanford Band will no longer
exclude women from its membership, the Daily has
learned, despite a poll taken a month ago in which
bandsmen voted 108-22 to continue the present
policy of non-admittance of women.
The band's desire to exclude women evidently
comes into conflict with University policy that no
one shall be excluded from any course on the basis of
non-academic criteria. Bandsmen receive one unit of
credit for their playing under Music 161 C.
In a letter to music department chairman,
Professor Loran Crosten, Albert Hastorf, Dean of
Humanities and Sciences, said that in the future, the
University catalogue statement "under Music
161-C-Sports Activity Bands shall no longer include
the phrase 'Men only for Autumn Quarter.' "
The letter also says that the Director of the Band,
Dr. Arthur Barnes, "will work out a system of
auditions etc. for the selection of band members." In
the past, according to band manager Dave Ruiz, the
band "would accept just about anyone," regardless of
musical ability.
Crosten Speaks
Last night Crosten said, "In compliance with the
University policy of non-discrimination, the Music
Department will henceforth admit women to the
marching band, subject of course, to an audition
process as developed by Professor Arthur Barnes,
director of the band."
Crosten emphasized that the past restrictions on

the band had only been for the Fall Quarter, although
Ruiz indicated that this restriction probably
effectively carried over to the other two quarters.
Barnes will devise a system of auditions to give
present band members seniority while insuring some
type of input from new Stanford people. The letter
also allows Barnes "to define the musical make-up of
the band."
Ruiz maintains that the band had planned to go to
an audition basis next year anyway because they had
reached the maximum number of bandsmen the
Athletic Department would fund. It will fund only
165 members and staff for the band, and that number
is already exceeded this year, he said.
Band Doesn't Know
Ruiz said that band members as a group did not
yet know of the change of policy but would be
informed tonight at their meeting.
The issue evidently came to a climax after the
Ombudswoman, Mrs. Lois Amsterdam, delivered a
report to Hastorf concerning the band practices.
Ruiz says,"I don't think there will be that many
women interested in the band." He also doesn't think
the admission of women will change the band
substantially, although he admits there will certainly
be subtle changes. He said the all maleness of the
band had been a part of its "mystique" that it will be
losing.
Alec Rooke, a band member, said that there was
"never any doubt that women could add something
to the band" but that members were "afraid of a big

change" in the structure of a band they liked.
The policy change was not unexpected, according
to Ruiz. "After all the publicity, we were sure we
would get some sort of follow-up from the
University," he said.
Although Ruiz maintained that the decision was
"in no way handed down from on top," he did talk
of how it had been "imposed" on the band and since
the University controlled the credit and purse strings
the band didn't really have much choice.
He also said that the band vote of a month ago was
taken just because he "wanted to know opinions" of
the possibility of admitting women in the band. He
and Crosten also claim that the vote couldn't set band
policy since the University actually sets the policy.
At the time of the vote, however, Ruiz said that
the results of the ballot would be binding.
Ruiz insists that the band has not formally
discouraged any woman from entering the band in
the last two years and possibly longer. He did admit,
however, that it was "possible" women had been
informally discouraged by current band members and
the course catalogue.
Ruiz said the policy of allowing women would go
into effect either spring quarter or next fall. He said
the "basketball" band had already been chosen by
audition from the fall band and he was not sure what
would happen to the spring band. In the past, he said,
it had been open, as in the fall band to anyone who
wanted to play. The basketball band has been chosen
by audition for several years.

Traditionally the band has been all male and the dollies all female. However the
University has now told the band to end its all male tradition and accept female
members. Who knows, maybe the dollies will go coed next. After all, there's
Salvador Dali, isn't there?

to the band" but that members were "afraid of a big

change" in the structure of a band they liked.
The policy change was not unexpected, according
to Ruiz. "After all the publicity, we were sure we
would get some sort of follow-up from the
University," he said.
Although Ruiz maintained that the decision was
"in no way handed down from on top," he did talk
of how it had been "imposed" on the band and since
the University controlled the credit and purse strings
the band didn't really have much choice.
He also said that the band vote of a month ago was
taken just because he "wanted to know opinions" of
the possibility of admitting women in the band. He
and Crosten also claim that the vote couldn't set band
policy since the University actually sets the policy.
At the time of the vote, however, Ruiz said that
the results of the ballot would be binding.
Ruiz insists that the band has not formally
discouraged any woman from entering the band in
the last two years and possibly longer. He did admit,
however, that it was "possible" women had been
informally discouraged by current band members and
the course catalogue.
Ruiz said the policy of allowing women would go
into effect either spring quarter or next fall. He said
the "basketball" band had already been chosen by
audition from the fall band and he was not sure what
would happen to the spring band. In the past, he said,
it had been open, as in the fall band to anyone who
wanted to play. The basketball band has been chosen
by audition for several years.

BAND BAN BANNED—Band Manager Dave Ruiz here talks with the dollies
Traditionally the band has been all male and the dollies all female. However the
University has now told the band to end its all male tradition and accept female
members. Who knows, maybe the dollies will go coed next. After all, there's
Salvador Dali, isn't there?
The Incomparable Stanford Band will no longer
exclude women from its membership, the Daily has
learned, despite a poll taken a month ago in which
bandsmen voted 108-22 to continue the present
policy of non-admittance of women.
The band's desire to exclude women evidently
comes into conflict with University policy that no
one shall be excluded from any course on the basis of
non-academic criteria. Bandsmen receive one unit of
credit for their playing under Music 161 C.
In a letter to music department chairman,
Professor Loran Crosten, Albert Hastorf, Dean of
Humanities and Sciences, said that in the future, the
University catalogue statement "under Music
161-C-Sports Activity Bands shall no longer include
the phrase 'Men only for Autumn Quarter.' "
The letter also says that the Director of the Band,
Dr. Arthur Barnes, "will work out a system of
auditions etc. for the selection of band members." In
the past, according to band manager Dave Ruiz, the
band "would accept just about anyone," regardless of
musical ability.
Crosten Speaks
Last night Crosten said, "In compliance with the
University policy of non-discrimination, the Music
Department will henceforth admit women to the
marching band, subject of course, to an audition
process as developed by Professor Arthur Barnes,
director of the band."
Crosten emphasized that the past restrictions on

the band had only been for the Fall Quarter, although
Ruiz indicated that this restriction probably
effectively carried over to the other two quarters.
Barnes will devise a system of auditions to give
present band members seniority while insuring some
type of input from new Stanford people. The letter
also allows Barnes "to define the musical make-up of
the band."
Ruiz maintains that the band had planned to go to
an audition basis next year anyway because they had
reached the maximum number of bandsmen the
Athletic Department would fund. It will fund only
165 members and staff for the band, and that number
is already exceeded this year, he said.
Band Doesn't Know
Ruiz said that band members as a group did not
yet know of the change of policy but would be
informed tonight at their meeting.
The issue evidently came to a climax after the
Ombudswoman, Mrs. Lois Amsterdam, delivered a
report to Hastorf concerning the band practices.
Ruiz says,"I don't think there will be that many
women interested in the band." He also doesn't think
the admission of women will change the band
substantially, although he admits there will certainly
be subtle changes. He said the all maleness of the
band had been a part of its "mystique" that it will be
losing.

credit for their playing under Music 161 C.
In a letter to music department chairman,
Professor Loran Crosten, Albert Hastorf, Dean of
Humanities and Sciences, said that in the future, the
University catalogue statement "under Music
161-C-Sports Activity Bands shall no longer include
the phrase 'Men only for Autumn Quarter.' "
The letter also says that the Director of the Band,
Dr. Arthur Barnes, "will work out a system of
auditions etc. for the selection of band members." In
the past, according to band manager Dave Ruiz, the
band "would accept just about anyone," regardless of
musical ability.
Crosten Speaks
Last night Crosten said, "In compliance with the
University policy of non-discrimination, the Music
Department will henceforth admit women to the
marching band, subject of course, to an audition
process as developed by Professor Arthur Barnes,
director of the band."
Crosten emphasized that the past restrictions on

the band had only been for the Fall Quarter, although
Ruiz indicated that this restriction probably
effectively carried over to the other two quarters.
Barnes will devise a system of auditions to give
present band members seniority while insuring some
type of input from new Stanford people. The letter
also allows Barnes "to define the musical make-up of
the band."
Ruiz maintains that the band had planned to go to
an audition basis next year anyway because they had
reached the maximum number of bandsmen the
Athletic Department would fund. It will fund only
165 members and staff for the band, and that number
is already exceeded this year, he said.
Band Doesn't Know
Ruiz said that band members as a group did not
yet know of the change of policy but would be
informed tonight at their meeting.
The issue evidently came to a climax after the
Ombudswoman, Mrs. Lois Amsterdam, delivered a
report to Hastorf concerning the band practices.
Ruiz says,"I don't think there will be that many
women interested in the band." He also doesn't think
the admission of women will change the band
substantially, although he admits there will certainly
be subtle changes. He said the all maleness of the
band had been a part of its "mystique" that it will be
losing.
Alec Rooke, a band member, said that there was
"never any doubt that women could add something
to the band" but that members were "afraid of a big

change" in the structure of a band they liked.
The policy change was not unexpected, according
to Ruiz. "After all the publicity, we were sure we
would get some sort of follow-up from the
University," he said.
Although Ruiz maintained that the decision was
"in no way handed down from on top," he did talk
of how it had been "imposed" on the band and since
the University controlled the credit and purse strings
the band didn't really have much choice.
He also said that the band vote of a month ago was
taken just because he "wanted to know opinions" of
the possibility of admitting women in the band. He
and Crosten also claim that the vote couldn't set band
policy since the University actually sets the policy.
At the time of the vote, however, Ruiz said that
the results of the ballot would be binding.
Ruiz insists that the band has not formally
discouraged any woman from entering the band in
the last two years and possibly longer. He did admit,
however, that it was "possible" women had been
informally discouraged by current band members and
the course catalogue.
Ruiz said the policy of allowing women would go
into effect either spring quarter or next fall. He said
the "basketball" band had already been chosen by
audition from the fall band and he was not sure what
would happen to the spring band. In the past, he said,
it had been open, as in the fall band to anyone who
wanted to play. The basketball band has been chosen
by audition for several years.

BAND BAN BANNED—Band Manager Dave Ruiz here talks with the dollies
Traditionally the band has been all male and the dollies all female. However the
University has now told the band to end its all male tradition and accept female
members. Who knows, maybe the dollies will go coed next. After all, there's
Salvador Dali, isn't there?
