Edit Page Monopoly
Editor, THE DAILY:
I realize that the Daily does not
have a comic page, but I am
beginning to think that Lenny
Siegel, "long time campus figure,"
and his Association of Young
Crows is filling that vacuum. The
Daily has devoted more space this
year to Lenny and his little band
of Pacific Studies Center
drop-outs than to even the
Concerned Asian Scholars.
I know that Lenny, Gerry, Joel
and Jim are "members of the
university community" and are
thus able to monopolize the
editorial page of the Daily, but to
have to read about their antics in
the news stories also is becoming
tiresome. Their much touted
"Red Hot Professor Contest" was
a complete bust, as witnessed by
the Daily story on November
18th, "about thirty members and
supporters of the
organization ... were led by
Lenny Siegel of the Pacific
Studies Center .. .. "
I suggest that the Daily cover
some of the other happenings on
the campus which attract 30 or
more supporters. The intramural
football games, the electrical
engineering graduate seminars, the
ASCE talk on BART, the ASSU
Bail Fund, misuse of ASSU funds,
or many other items which might
be considered newsworthy.
I doubt that this will happen
though, because the Daily appears
to be concerned with what

trouble can be stirred up on the
campus; for instance the headline
in the November 18th Daily,
"Protest Aimed at Viet Judges."
Are you consciously trying to
have another newsworthy event,
such as the
Humph rey-Lodge-Placement
Service happenings, occur so that
once again Stanford will have
shown the world its opposition to
the war in Southeast Asia, or
more importantly and sadly,
Stanford's complete lack of
objectivity, open-mindedness and
unwillingness to listen to all sides?
It also shows that a small group of
Hitler Jugend, Brownshirts, or
Red Guard bully boys can deny
the use and access of Stanford
facilities to any group or person.
When will the Stanford
community finally realize that
every person or organization
which visits the campus can be
attacked by some other group
which is guided only by the
"highest moral principles" and is
therefore obligated to refuse those
visitors the use of Stanford lands?

PSC Rejects Franklin
Professor Gene F. Franklin
Dept. of Electrical Engineering
c/o Editor, THE DAILY:
Thank you for your application
for Director of the Pacific Studies

Center. After careful collective
consideration, however, we regret
to inform you that although your
qualifications are excellent (your
involvement in anti-war activities
and your exposure to radical
politics while on the SJC are well
known), your application has
been turned down.
It is the consensus of the
membership that the PSC program
is not well-aligned with your
professional interests.
Furthermore, in view of your
proposed reforms if you were to
be made Director, we feel that the
organizational structure of the
Center is not suitable for a man
with your administrative
ambitions.
The Pacific Studies Center is a
voluntary non-profit research
institution which makes all its
decisions on a collective basis.
Although each researcher is free
to do the research that he wants,
we also recognize that our work
does not exist in a vacuum. Each
of us understands that in doing
research we also have a
responsibility to the other
members of the Center and to the
peoples for whom we write.
As there are no salaries except a
small stipend for the Director
there are no undue constraints on
our work or channeling pressures
from funding sources. Finally, the
collective is non-hierarchical. The
Director merely serves as a
coordinator of activities, with no
authority over the selection of
membership or over the work that
is performed. Thus, unlike
universities, arbitrary dismissal of
members is impossible.
Since you are used to a very
different work environment at
Stanford, we suspect that you
would find adjustment to the role
of Director at PSC very difficult.
Nevertheless, we do have openings
for new research associates. As
you appear to be looking for
alternative employment we would

be happy to give you every
possible consideration for this
position. In fact, it is our feeling
that, with a little study, your
chances for acceptance into the
collective would be very good. We
look forward to further
communication with you.
Yours in struggle,
Pacific Studies Center
Collective
