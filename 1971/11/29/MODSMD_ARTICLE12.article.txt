# Poloists Finish Fifth In NCAA's
## 
### DOUG WILSON 
Stanford's hopes for a second
national water polo title withered
away in the very first game of the
NCAA tournament held Friday
and Saturday in Long Beach, as
the Indians dropped their third
consecutive match to the San Jose
State Spartans, 10-4. San Jose was
runner-up in the tournament,
losing in the finals to powerhouse
UCLA, 5-3.
The Stanford water polo team,
for whom the national title had
been a year-long goal, seemed
unable to put much of a team
effort together against San Jose

State. The Spartans managed to
capitalize on several Indian errors
to maintain possession of the ball
for most of the game.
Although Stanford closed the
scoring gap after halftime to come
within two points of the fired-up
San Jose squad, the Indians could
not continue the momentum, and
were hampered offensively by
poor passing through most of the
fourth quarter.
By virtue of its win over
UC-Irvine in the consolation
finals, the Indians ended up fifth
in the tournament, behind UCLA,
San Jose, Cal State-Fullerton and
Long Beach State.

GADD ZOOKS—Maybe zooks isn't the word for Peter Gadd's fine
deflection. Senior goalie Gadd finished up this season Saturday against
UC Irvine in the NCAA water polo tourney. The Indians edged the
Anteaters for fifth place.
