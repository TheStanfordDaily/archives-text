# ACT Production
## Revival Of 'The Tavern' 
### DOUG ARTHUR 
George M. Cohan knew the
theatre cold. He should: he was a
vaudevillian, actor, dancer, singer,
composer, director, producer and
a playwright. Of his plays, he
liked "The Tavern" best of all.
ACT's current production,
revived from last season's smash
hit, confirms Cohan's judgment. It
thrills you from the minute the
roll curtain cranks up until the
delightful conclusion which you
must experience to appreciate.
"The Tavern" spoofs the
traditional melodrama by stressing
its conventions. The speedy pace
and fast farcical incidents build
suspense that is finally resolved
with a few quick revelations.
Briefly, a ferocious storm
throws the governor, his wife, his
daughter, and the daughter's
fiance, along with a vagabond and
a mysterious woman into Zacceus
Freeman's tavern, which he runs
with the help of his son Zach and
a hired girl named Sally, whom
Zach loves in defiance of his
father's wishes. The Governor's
party has been held up and it
takes a couple of dramatic
entrances by the sheriff and his
men to resolve the crime.
The mysterious woman, who
' had been found in the barn,
makes some accusations of her
own. We never learn who the
[ vagabond is, but he is always in
' control of the situation.
Dramatic Possibilities
The vagabond, at once
, charming, shrewd and quite witty,
t comments on the action at
I different points: the other actors
I freeze onstage, a bright spotlight
r then shines on the main character.
■ THE DRAMA forms the main
concern of the vagabond; he tells
us of the dramatic possibilities of
the various intrigues.
Sometimes verging on camp
(when drum rolls, cymbal clashes
and peals of thunder accent high
k points in a character's speech)

the production makes a farce of
the conventional melodrama. Yet
the play has a heart of its own.
Warm touches of sentiment
vitalize the drama and emphasize
the humanity of these stock
characters.
Director Ellis Rabb (Peter
Donat restaged the show for the
Geary Theatre) found several
clever ways to make the
characters more than
melodramatic caricatures. When
the Tavem Keeper brings hot
toddies ' for the governor's
company, all characters stare
intently at the governor's wife
who rises (accompanied by a loud
drum roll) to take the alcohol.
Cued by her husband, she refrains
and follows the drink with her
longing eyes.
Physical Action
The action becomes very
physical when the mysterious
woman denounces several of the
men. The hired girl can barely
hold her back. The stage bustles
with everyone running around:
some know what they're doing,
some, like the hillbilly Willum,
haven't the slightest idea.
The melodramatic effects
provide most of the humor. Wind
machines whip up a terrific storm:
the door of the tavern scarcely
closes after it's opened, and the
governor's party, hidden by a
huge umbrella, is blown in by the
storm.
Many of the lines sound
familiar: "You're dealing with a
desperate man, I'm going to make
you suffer." Gestures tend to be
broad to ridicule conventions. The
actors played for points, which
appeared effective when they hit
the high ones.
Acting Performances
Richard Council played a
not-too-bright Zach, and his
awkward physical appearance
added much to the role. Nancy
McDoniel as the mysterious
woman should have created a

greater vocal and expressive range
when delivering her lines.
On the subject of lines, it
would have been nice if Ray
Reinhardt, in the main role, had
learned his. He made a couple of
noticeable slips. Otherwise, he
made a fine vagabond: he
manipulated all those strange
people behind the footlights.

For sheer entertainment, 'The
Tavern" makes a splendid evening.
("The Tavern " will be repeated
this Wednesday at 2:30 p.m. at
the Geary Theatre in San
Francisco and again on the
evenings of December 6, 15, 25
and 31. Student rush tickets
priced at $3 go on sale 15 minutes
