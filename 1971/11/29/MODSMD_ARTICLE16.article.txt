Leader Murdered
CAIRO — Prime Minister Wasfi Tell of
Jordan, an unrelenting foe of the
Palestinian guerrillas, was assassinated
here yesterday.
Police arrested three non-Egyptians
carrying Syrian passports. The official
Middle East news agency reported the
three said they were ordered to kill Tell
by the Black I lul —Black
September-movement, formed to
avenge the deaths of guerrillas during
fierce fighting between Palestinians and
the Jordanian army in September 1970.
Tell was gunned down at the
entrance to Cairo's Sheraton Hotel. The
51-year old prime minister was
representing his country at a 17-nation
Arab League Defense Council meeting
called to plan joint strategy against
Israel.
The three arrested assailants
admitted shooting Tell, according to
Egyptian authorities.
The assassination aroused fears
among Jordan Arabs under Israeli
occupation that more civil war is
imminent in the Arab kingdom.
Tell was widely disliked in the
occupied west bank of Jordan, where
he was termed by many as "the man
behind the slaughter of our people" in
the September 1970 and mid-1971
royal campaigns against Arab guerrillas.
In Nablus, the main west bank city
and traditional center of Palestinian
nationalism, Arabs greeted news of his
death with joyful handshakes and
slapped one another on the back.
Nixon Meets Brandt
SAN CLEMENTE — President Nixon,
due to disclose the date of his mainland
China visit by midweek, announced
yesterday another in a series of
pre-departure conferences with allied
leaders, a late December meeting with
West German Chancellor Willy Brandt,
recent winner of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Brandt and Nixon will meet Dec.
28-29 at the Florida White House in
Key Biscayne.
Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir has
a White House appointment with the
President on Thursday.
On Dec. 13 Nixon meets with
French President Georges Pompidou in
the islands of the Azores in the
Atlantic. Nixon will travel to Bermuda
for talks with British Prime Minister
Edward Heath Dec. 20-21. And he has

invited Japan's Prime Minister Eisaku
Sato to San Clemente for consultations
Jan. 6-7.
Canadian Prime Minister Elliot
Trudeau is expected to be added to the
list.
Nixon announced some time ago
that he wanted to have a meeting with
the Canadian prime minister and said
he probably would go to that country
for the session. But it now appears
likely that Trudeau will come to the
United States instead.
Three top Nixon Administration
officials will be in on all the
sessions—Secretary of State William P.
Rogers, Treasury Secretary John B.
Connally and national security adviser
Henry A. Kissinger.
India, Pakistan Clash
DACCA, East Pakistan — India threw
tanks, artillery and air power yesterday
into a fresh "large-scale offensive" in
East Pakistan, a Pakistani army
spokesman said here.
Heavy fighting was "raging in the
areas at last report," he said last night.
He claimed two Indian divisions, three
armored regiments and several artillery
units were involved.
Pakistan has charged India with
intervening to help East Pakistani rebels
fight for the independence of the
province, which is separated from West
Pakistan by cultural differences and
1,000 miles of Indian territory.
India, however, reported its troops
had crossed into East Pakistan for the
third time in a week only "in self
defense."
An Indian dispatch from Balurghat
said Pakistani guns had shelled a
crowded market place, killing six
civilians and wounding more than a
dozen others.
Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi
opposed any move to bring the crisis
before the United Nations Security
council.
"Referring the issue to the Security
Council would neither help ease the
situation, nor materially affect it", she
told a rally yesterday in Jaipur, after
visiting troops on the East Pakistan
border for the second straight day.
SJS To Pasadena
NEWPORT BEACH - San Jose State,
with a 5-5-1 record, was voted into the
Dec. 18 Pasadena Bowl for a game

against Missouri Valley Conference
representative Memphis State. The vote
was not unanimous but wasn't
announced.
The announcement was somewhat of
a surprise because Long Beach State
was the Pacific Coast Athletic
Conference champion with a 5-1 mark.
San Jose's Spartans would up 4-1 but
held a victory over Long Beach, 30-28.
San Jose scored perhaps the upset of
the season, however, with a 13-12
defeat of Rose Bowl-bound Stanford
on Nov. 13.
