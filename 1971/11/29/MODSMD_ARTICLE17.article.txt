# Bazile-Laury Trial Begins
## 
### 
The trial of Leo Bazile and Chris
Laury, accused of beating a Medical
Center employee last May, opened
Friday in San Mateo Superior Court
with their lawyers claiming the
defendants were elsewhere during the
alleged attack.
Bazile, former chairman of the BSU,
and now a law student at Berkeley's
Boalt Hall, and Laury, a leader of the
Black Liberation Front in May and
presently a member of the
Ruchell-Magee Defense Committee
here, face felony charges of burglary
and assault with a deadly weapon.
The prosecution contends that Bazile
and Laury kicked, beat, and slightly

burned Miss Mary Jane Schmidt, a
medical records librarian, at her East
Palo Alto apartment.
The incident allegedly grew out of
the work stoppage at the Hospital
following the firing of a black janitor.
Schmidt reportedly received two
anonymous telephone calls threatening
reprisals if she did not honor the work
stoppage by black employees.
Attracted Attention
The case attracted considerable
attention because a group of prominent
University and civic officials raised
money to buy a bail bond for Bazile's
release. President Lyman, Provost
Miller, and Republican Presidential
hopeful Rep. Pete McCloskey
contributed. Bazile, however, was
released on his own recognizance.
The case is being heard by an
all-white jury, selected after extensive
questioning on racial prejudice.
Before the trial, Judge Rose denied a
motion by Pharsiel Shelton, Laury's
lawyer, that the case against his client
be dismissed because Schmidt had been
unable to identify her attacker at the
preliminary hearing.
Last June Schmidt identified Bazile
but from two feet away chose a
spectator sitting next to Laury as
Laury. She said she had erroneously
identified Laury because "it was like
looking at two brothers and for a good
minute I was torn between the two."
Shelton argued that Schmidt had an
opportunity to see her attacker, had
identified Laury twice from

photographs and had sesn him once at
the Hospital before the preliminary
hearing, but could not identify him at
the time.
Schmidt said she identified Laury
Friday morning at the trial based on
her recollection of the May 2 attack
and not because her earlier
misidentification had been pointed out
to her.
'Somewhere Else'
Shelton said that he will introduce
evidence that Laury "was, in fact, some
place else at about the time of the
incident" and "whether the assault
took place or was a figment of the
complainant's imagination."
Thelton Henderson, Bazile's
attorney, said his case would show that
at the time of the alleged attack Bazile
was at home with his wife and
discussing an assignment with two
students who stopped by for 20
minutes.
Bazile's hair had been elaborately
coiffeured, he said, and it would have
been time consuming for Schmidt's
attacker, who wore a natural, to change
his hair style.
After the attack, he said, she
identified Bazile from photographs and
saw him at the Hospital before picking
him out in a lineup.
"Bazile is one of the best known
student figures. He was always at the
Hospital and in the school
paper. . . having made up her mind
(that her attacker was Bazile) on the
basis of photographs, she is consistent,"
said Henderson.
