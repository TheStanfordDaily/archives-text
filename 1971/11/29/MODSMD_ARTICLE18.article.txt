# New Magazine Out
## 
### DAN BRENNER 
The Stanford Independent, a general economic and philosophical journal makes
its first appearance this morning. Representing a conscious libertarian viewpoint,
the 16-page magazine is the latest member of the community's partisan press.
"We will try to take the offensive on Libertarian ideas with philosophical
backing," notes co-editor Buzz Thompson who was a former editor of the
conservative-libertarian Arena.
And, adds contributing writer Bill Evers, who has been extensively involved
with the New Left-oriented Chaparral, "The Independent takes a more
self-assured, self-confident approach than the Arena."
The journal is not exactly designed for easy reading.
"We are asking the reader to come up to this magazine," says Evers.
Today's issue features philosophical articles on anarchism; Congressional
political processes, and an abstruse "review article" on poetry and rationalism.
The Independent grew out of a desire by the Stanford Advocates (Buzz
Thompson, Sue Rague, Jim Rich and Robin Friedman) to advance libertarianism
beyond the resources of the Arena, which had been closely associated with the
Free Campus Movement (FCM), an organization which Thompson says has "been
sort of red-neck oriented."
According to Thompson, none of the editors were ever members of FCM.
The journal's motto, "All men are created equally free and independent," was
written by Mason in the Virginia Declaration of Rights. As Rague points out in
the "Introductory Note," libertarianism emphasizes that "people may adopt their
own preferred living patterns so long as they do not force others to conform to
it."
Unlike other partisan campus publications, it carries no advertisements.
Thompson notes that the Independent has been entirely funded by profits made
from Stanford Advocate film showings in the last year.
One of its distinctive trademarks is the drawing of a bicycle which crops up
over the paper. Evers explained that the bicycle idea comes from 'The Prisoner"
television show. The British program featured Patrick McGoohan, as a prisoner in
an eery totalitarian state and had a bicycle next to the credits.
The journal will not be limited to student think pieces. For example, a faculty
column, written by economics Professor John Scadding is featured in this issue.
The editors plan to include faculty articles on a regular basis.
Also short stories will be featured. "Emmy," a story by Scott Cummins, is
included. "Anybody is invited to submit material," Thompson says. "But the
journal will have a definite libertarian slant."
There are the traditional typos that accompany any new publication. For
instance at the end of page five the reader is instructed to turn to page "00."
And co-editor Robin Friedman, although listed for this issue, is actually at
Stan ford-In-Bri tain.

The Stanford Independent, a general economic and philosophical journal makes
its first appearance this morning. Representing a conscious libertarian viewpoint,
the 16-page magazine is the latest member of the community's partisan press.
"We will try to take the offensive on Libertarian ideas with philosophical
backing," notes co-editor Buzz Thompson who was a former editor of the
conservative-libertarian Arena.
And, adds contributing writer Bill Evers, who has been extensively involved
with the New Left-oriented Chaparral, "The Independent takes a more
self-assured, self-confident approach than the Arena."
The journal is not exactly designed for easy reading.
"We are asking the reader to come up to this magazine," says Evers.
Today's issue features philosophical articles on anarchism; Congressional
political processes, and an abstruse "review article" on poetry and rationalism.
The Independent grew out of a desire by the Stanford Advocates (Buzz
Thompson, Sue Rague, Jim Rich and Robin Friedman) to advance libertarianism
beyond the resources of the Arena, which had been closely associated with the
Free Campus Movement (FCM), an organization which Thompson says has "been
sort of red-neck oriented."
According to Thompson, none of the editors were ever members of FCM.
The journal's motto, "All men are created equally free and independent," was
written by Mason in the Virginia Declaration of Rights. As Rague points out in
the "Introductory Note," libertarianism emphasizes that "people may adopt their
own preferred living patterns so long as they do not force others to conform to
it."
Unlike other partisan campus publications, it carries no advertisements.
Thompson notes that the Independent has been entirely funded by profits made
from Stanford Advocate film showings in the last year.
One of its distinctive trademarks is the drawing of a bicycle which crops up
over the paper. Evers explained that the bicycle idea comes from 'The Prisoner"
television show. The British program featured Patrick McGoohan, as a prisoner in
an eery totalitarian state and had a bicycle next to the credits.
The journal will not be limited to student think pieces. For example, a faculty
column, written by economics Professor John Scadding is featured in this issue.
The editors plan to include faculty articles on a regular basis.
Also short stories will be featured. "Emmy," a story by Scott Cummins, is
included. "Anybody is invited to submit material," Thompson says. "But the
journal will have a definite libertarian slant."
