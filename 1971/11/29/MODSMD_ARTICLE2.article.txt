# Human Bio Dept. Goes 'Ape' Over Foothill Chimp Farm
## 
### TERRIE McDONALD 
A primate observation facility,
unique in the world for its attempt to
recreate the chimpanzee's natural
habitat and its function as a site for
behavioral studies, is planned for the
Stanford campus. The project was
conceived of by Dr. David Hamburg,
director of Stanford's department of
psychiatry in conjunction with primate
specialist and visiting professor of
Human Biology Jane van
Lawick-Goodall.
The proposed site of the primate
center is in the northwest comer of the
Webb Ranch, at the intersection of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center and
Jasper Ridge, the University's biological
preserve. The project has complete
University approval, said Hamburg, and
an application for a land use permit was
filed with the San Mateo Planning
Commission last Wednesday.
The chimp's six acre living area will
be landscaped to simulate their natural
environment as closely as possible. It
will be divided into four one-and-a-half
acre quadrants where groups of six to

eight young monkeys, generally about a
year old, will be the objects of
"non-disruptive observational studies."
The chimps will be brought from the
Delta Regional Primate Center near
New Orleans as infants. They will grow
up in the exclusive company of their
peers, rather than under the influence
of adults, who are their behavioral
models in the jungle.
Two Specific Studies
Researchers have two specific studies
planned as the chimps reach puberty
and grow into adolescence at about age
seven or eight. First, they will note the
changes in the behavior of these
chimps, raised without adult models,
and compare them with observations
made by Dr. Goodall and her staff at
the Gofnbe Stream Chimpanzee
Reserve in Tanzania.
Secondly, sex hormones will be
obtained from the chimps through the
unobtrusive use of metabolic cages.
Here, Dr. Hamburg said, bananas will
be used to entice chimps to spend the
night in a cage where urine samples can
be collected and from which the

hormones can be extracted.
The second goal of the study is to
correlate the changes in young
chimpanzee behavior with their sex
hormone measurements.
The research at Stanford is closely
aligned with Dr. Goodall's work in
Africa, where she has been studying
primates for nearly 11 years and where
she will continue to work between her
yearly three-month sojourns at
Stanford. She will be on campus two
months in the fall and one in the
spring, teaching and doing research.
Stanford-in-Africa
At this time there are two Stanford
graduate students at the Gombe Stream
Reserve and a third about to depart for
Africa. Among the first participants in
a continuing undergraduate program
are two Stanford human biology majors
who will leave for Tanzania in January.
Following them in April two more
human biology majors will depart for
the chimp reserve for six month tours
of practical field experience. The
opportunity to participate in this
program is listed in the winter time
schedule as Human Biology 161, A
Primate Behavior Workshop: An
African Elective.
The Stanford primate facility has
been designed to make captivity as
unrestrictive as possible for the
monkeys while eliminating some of the
problems encountered in the field. In
Africa it is often necessary to either
follow chimps for miles, as they wander
in search of food, or to construct
artificial feeding stations that attract
the chimps and make them easier to
observe, but somewhat compromise
their "natural" behavior.
At the new primate facility. Dr.
Hamburg reports, the food will
generally be widely distributed and
there will be little interference with the
chimps. A two -story observation building
at the center of the area will provide
students and scientists with adequate
observation vantage points.
In choosing a site, Dr. Hamburg
specified that student involvement, an
integral part of the center, dictated that
the center be within bicycling distance
of the main campus. He emphasized
that the facility would be available to
human biology undergraduates and
graduate students in biology and
sociology with the program later
expanding to include such departments
as anthropology and psychiatry.
The center, called "a large social
behavior lab" by Dr. Hamburg, is at the
center of a 23 acre plot surrounded by
wiremesh fencing. When asked about
the necessity of obtaining a county
permit, John Hornback, resident
architect at the Stanford Medical
School, noted that construction of the

facility is permitted under current
zoning. The area has a residential estate
zoning which permits the building of
schools. Homback, whose office
developed the center's physical design,
said the primate center qualifies under
this clause. A public hearing will be
held in Redwood City on Decmeber 15.
Initial funding for the construction
of the primate facility is being provided
by the Grant Foundation of New York
and operating funds will be supplied by
the National Institute for Mental
Health.
The University hopes to begin
construction this winter and have the
center operational for the opening of
the 1972 academic year, said Hamburg.

Reserve and a third about to depart for
Africa. Among the first participants in
a continuing undergraduate program
are two Stanford human biology majors
who will leave for Tanzania in January.
Following them in April two more
human biology majors will depart for
the chimp reserve for six month tours
of practical field experience. The
opportunity to participate in this
program is listed in the winter time
schedule as Human Biology 161, A
Primate Behavior Workshop: An
African Elective.
The Stanford primate facility has
been designed to make captivity as
unrestrictive as possible for the
monkeys while eliminating some of the
problems encountered in the field. In
Africa it is often necessary to either
follow chimps for miles, as they wander
in search of food, or to construct
artificial feeding stations that attract
the chimps and make them easier to
observe, but somewhat compromise
their "natural" behavior.
At the new primate facility. Dr.
Hamburg reports, the food will
generally be widely distributed and
there will be little interference with the
chimps. A two -story observation building
at the center of the area will provide
students and scientists with adequate
observation vantage points.
In choosing a site, Dr. Hamburg
specified that student involvement, an
integral part of the center, dictated that
the center be within bicycling distance
of the main campus. He emphasized
that the facility would be available to
human biology undergraduates and
graduate students in biology and
sociology with the program later
expanding to include such departments
as anthropology and psychiatry.
The center, called "a large social
behavior lab" by Dr. Hamburg, is at the
center of a 23 acre plot surrounded by
wiremesh fencing. When asked about
the necessity of obtaining a county
permit, John Hornback, resident
architect at the Stanford Medical
School, noted that construction of the

facility is permitted under current
zoning. The area has a residential estate
zoning which permits the building of
schools. Homback, whose office
developed the center's physical design,
said the primate center qualifies under
this clause. A public hearing will be
held in Redwood City on Decmeber 15.
Initial funding for the construction
of the primate facility is being provided
by the Grant Foundation of New York
and operating funds will be supplied by
the National Institute for Mental
Health.
The University hopes to begin
construction this winter and have the
center operational for the opening of
the 1972 academic year, said Hamburg.
A primate observation facility,
unique in the world for its attempt to
recreate the chimpanzee's natural
habitat and its function as a site for
behavioral studies, is planned for the
Stanford campus. The project was
conceived of by Dr. David Hamburg,
director of Stanford's department of
psychiatry in conjunction with primate
specialist and visiting professor of
Human Biology Jane van
Lawick-Goodall.
The proposed site of the primate
center is in the northwest comer of the
Webb Ranch, at the intersection of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center and
Jasper Ridge, the University's biological
preserve. The project has complete
University approval, said Hamburg, and
an application for a land use permit was
filed with the San Mateo Planning
Commission last Wednesday.
The chimp's six acre living area will
be landscaped to simulate their natural
environment as closely as possible. It
will be divided into four one-and-a-half
acre quadrants where groups of six to

eight young monkeys, generally about a
year old, will be the objects of
"non-disruptive observational studies."
The chimps will be brought from the
Delta Regional Primate Center near
New Orleans as infants. They will grow
up in the exclusive company of their
peers, rather than under the influence
of adults, who are their behavioral
models in the jungle.
Two Specific Studies
Researchers have two specific studies
planned as the chimps reach puberty
and grow into adolescence at about age
seven or eight. First, they will note the
changes in the behavior of these
chimps, raised without adult models,
and compare them with observations
made by Dr. Goodall and her staff at
the Gofnbe Stream Chimpanzee
Reserve in Tanzania.
Secondly, sex hormones will be
obtained from the chimps through the
unobtrusive use of metabolic cages.
Here, Dr. Hamburg said, bananas will
be used to entice chimps to spend the
night in a cage where urine samples can
be collected and from which the

hormones can be extracted.
The second goal of the study is to
correlate the changes in young
chimpanzee behavior with their sex
hormone measurements.
The research at Stanford is closely
aligned with Dr. Goodall's work in
Africa, where she has been studying
primates for nearly 11 years and where
she will continue to work between her
yearly three-month sojourns at
Stanford. She will be on campus two
months in the fall and one in the
spring, teaching and doing research.

behavioral studies, is planned for the
Stanford campus. The project was
conceived of by Dr. David Hamburg,
director of Stanford's department of
psychiatry in conjunction with primate
specialist and visiting professor of
Human Biology Jane van
Lawick-Goodall.
The proposed site of the primate
center is in the northwest comer of the
Webb Ranch, at the intersection of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center and
Jasper Ridge, the University's biological
preserve. The project has complete
University approval, said Hamburg, and
an application for a land use permit was
filed with the San Mateo Planning
Commission last Wednesday.
The chimp's six acre living area will
be landscaped to simulate their natural
environment as closely as possible. It
will be divided into four one-and-a-half
acre quadrants where groups of six to

eight young monkeys, generally about a
year old, will be the objects of
"non-disruptive observational studies."
The chimps will be brought from the
Delta Regional Primate Center near
New Orleans as infants. They will grow
up in the exclusive company of their
peers, rather than under the influence
of adults, who are their behavioral
models in the jungle.
Two Specific Studies
Researchers have two specific studies
planned as the chimps reach puberty
and grow into adolescence at about age
seven or eight. First, they will note the
changes in the behavior of these
chimps, raised without adult models,
and compare them with observations
made by Dr. Goodall and her staff at
the Gofnbe Stream Chimpanzee
Reserve in Tanzania.
Secondly, sex hormones will be
obtained from the chimps through the
unobtrusive use of metabolic cages.
Here, Dr. Hamburg said, bananas will
be used to entice chimps to spend the
night in a cage where urine samples can
be collected and from which the

hormones can be extracted.
The second goal of the study is to
correlate the changes in young
chimpanzee behavior with their sex
hormone measurements.
The research at Stanford is closely
aligned with Dr. Goodall's work in
Africa, where she has been studying
primates for nearly 11 years and where
she will continue to work between her
yearly three-month sojourns at
Stanford. She will be on campus two
months in the fall and one in the
spring, teaching and doing research.
Stanford-in-Africa
At this time there are two Stanford
graduate students at the Gombe Stream
Reserve and a third about to depart for
Africa. Among the first participants in
a continuing undergraduate program
are two Stanford human biology majors
who will leave for Tanzania in January.
Following them in April two more
human biology majors will depart for
the chimp reserve for six month tours
of practical field experience. The
opportunity to participate in this
program is listed in the winter time
schedule as Human Biology 161, A
Primate Behavior Workshop: An
African Elective.
The Stanford primate facility has
been designed to make captivity as
unrestrictive as possible for the
monkeys while eliminating some of the
problems encountered in the field. In
Africa it is often necessary to either
follow chimps for miles, as they wander
in search of food, or to construct
artificial feeding stations that attract
the chimps and make them easier to
observe, but somewhat compromise
their "natural" behavior.
At the new primate facility. Dr.
Hamburg reports, the food will
generally be widely distributed and
there will be little interference with the
chimps. A two -story observation building
at the center of the area will provide
students and scientists with adequate
observation vantage points.
In choosing a site, Dr. Hamburg
specified that student involvement, an
integral part of the center, dictated that
the center be within bicycling distance
of the main campus. He emphasized
that the facility would be available to
human biology undergraduates and
graduate students in biology and
sociology with the program later
expanding to include such departments
as anthropology and psychiatry.
The center, called "a large social
behavior lab" by Dr. Hamburg, is at the
center of a 23 acre plot surrounded by
wiremesh fencing. When asked about
the necessity of obtaining a county
permit, John Hornback, resident
architect at the Stanford Medical
School, noted that construction of the

facility is permitted under current
zoning. The area has a residential estate
zoning which permits the building of
schools. Homback, whose office
developed the center's physical design,
said the primate center qualifies under
this clause. A public hearing will be
held in Redwood City on Decmeber 15.
Initial funding for the construction
of the primate facility is being provided
by the Grant Foundation of New York
and operating funds will be supplied by
the National Institute for Mental
Health.
The University hopes to begin
construction this winter and have the
center operational for the opening of
the 1972 academic year, said Hamburg.
