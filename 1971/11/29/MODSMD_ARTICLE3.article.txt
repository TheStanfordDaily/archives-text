# HEW To Examine Female Hiring
## 
### SCOTT THACHER 
An investigation into all aspects of
the employment of women at Stanford
will be conducted in the near future by
the U.S. Office of Civil Rights.
The money Stanford receives from
its many federal contracts could be
withdrawn if investigators conclude
that the university discriminates against
women in hiring, job placement, or
salaries, among both faculty and staff.
According to Floyd Pierce, head of
the Civil Rights Office in San
Francisco, a branch of the Department
of Health, Education, and Welfare
(HEW), the date of the investigation
has not been scheduled.
Several other universities, including
Harvard and the University of
Michigan, have already been the
subjects of similar probes. Michigan was
asked to set certain goals for
employment of women on the faculty,
as one step towards retaining their
federal funds.
Berkeley, Too
Female employment practices at the

University of California at Berkeley are
also presently under scrutiny, and
federal action may be taken there, as
well.
The original basis of the inquiry, says
Pierce, was a general complaint filed
last April by Stanford alumna Nancy
Cross.
A letter Cross sent to the Civil Rights
Office stated in part that she was
"particularly aggrieved" for the
"sex-racist" policies she claims are
practiced by Stanford, and asked for
the withdrawal of tax exemption and
federal contracts from the university as
a whole.

A suit filed by Cross and Stanford
employee Linda Crouse, charging the
university with sexism and racism was
thrown out of court last week (see
related story).
Although Stanford is aware of the
complaint filed against it, the university
itself has not been given official notice
of the investigation, says Pierce.
Two Sides
When the investigators come, they
will have the power to look into two
sides of the female employment picture
here. One will be specific cases of
unequal treatment given to individual
women.

The second will be to study the
overall pattern of female employment
to see if it complies with an executive
order which forbids the holder of any
federal contract to practice
discrimination according to race, sex,
national origin, or religion.
The Personnel Office is required by
law to make public any information
which would allow investigators to
determine whether systematic patterns
of employment showed unfairness
towards women.
However, the question of a
one-to-one ratio of men to women in
undergraduate admissions would not be
considered. According to Pierce,
"There is some question about our
authority for challenging admissions."
Academic Focus?
Although Pierce states that he will be
looking into the "overall employment"
of women in both faculty and staff,
Anne Miner, Special Assistant to
President Lyman for Women's Affairs,
judges that from what has happened at
other places, the academic employment
of women will receive the most
emphasis.
She adds that some universities have
had to make "impressive paper
commitments" for the addition of
women to the faculty. But she says,
"The paper commitments have not
been as strong as the original
complainants could have wanted."
Besides the complaint filed by Cross,
women's groups on campus are making
an effort to solicit individual
complaints from women employees.
Linda Crouse, co-plaintiff in the sex
discrimination suit filed against the
university, says that "a co-ordinated
campus approach" is being taken by
women's groups here to present further
material for complaints to be lodged
with the Office of Civil Rights.
President Lyman, on the other hand,
announced that any cases of unequal
pay for the same work done by women
as men should be reported to his office
for immediate action.
