# Judge Dismisses Suit To End Stanford Ratio
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
An attempt to force Stanford to do
away with admission quotas for women
met with defeat last week when the
Santa Clara County Superior Court
threw out a lawsuit by two area
women.
Judge John S. Mclnemy ruled that
plaintiffs Nancy Jewell Cross, a chemist
and Stanford alumna, and Linda
Crouse, a University computer
programmer, had failed to prove that
they were affected by any sexist
policies or had "a community of
interest" with those who were.
Mclnerny also ruled that under
California law only the state Attorney
General, and not individuals
representing a class, can sue to enforce
the charter of a charitable trust such as
Stanford. The two plaintiffs asked the
court to order the University to abide
by antirsex-discrimination provisions in
its Founding Grant.
Class Action
The suit, filed last March, was a
"class action"-in which one or two
individuals sue for a large group.
Mclnery said, though, that the group of
women Crouse and Cross claimed to
represent was so large it was
undefinable and therefore invalid.
"It should be noted that plaintiff
Crouse does not allege she has applied
for, and been denied, admission to
Stanford," Mclnerny's decision said.
He was careful to point out that the
issue at hand was not the existence of
an admissions quota, but whether
Crouse and Cross actually had the right
to sue, and didn't bar the road to
further court action against the
University.
HEW Investigation
Crouse indicated that for the time
being the two women probably
wouldn't press the issue, preferring to
stake their hopes on an investigation of
Stanford sex/racial policies by the
Department of Health, Education, and
Welfare. HEW could cut off Federal
funding to the University if the
investigation turns up anything (see
related story this page).
The University never fought the
complaint on its merits, concentrating
instead on the issue of the status of
Crouse and Cross. A Stanford demurrer
to that effect was filed with the court,
and Mclnery accepted it in his decision.
Crouse and Cross had tried to get a
temporary injunction preventing the
University from sending out acceptance
notices to freshmen last spring—which

the court rejected.
They also made an attempt to have
the Federal District Court consider the
case because it involved constitutional
questions, but the Court refused and
sent it back to Santa Clara. In the
course of that attempt, Crouse and
Cross asked the Federal court to
disqualify itself, since all the judges
were white males, and allegedly had ties
with Stanford. That failed, too.
Crouse was not happy about the
decision. "The decision said we're not
the injured parties, but our experience
has been that those who are
discriminated against are often the least
likely to complain. They're already in a
bad position, and a complaint only
worsens it. It's difficult to prove
specific cases of discrimination, but it's
easy to see an overall pattern."
She also took a slap at President
Lyman stating, "He said the other night
on KZSU that we have to do this
slowly. Well, hell, they've had 70 years
now."

policies or had "a community of
interest" with those who were.
Mclnerny also ruled that under
California law only the state Attorney
General, and not individuals
representing a class, can sue to enforce
the charter of a charitable trust such as
Stanford. The two plaintiffs asked the
court to order the University to abide
by antirsex-discrimination provisions in
its Founding Grant.
Class Action
The suit, filed last March, was a
"class action"-in which one or two
individuals sue for a large group.
Mclnery said, though, that the group of
women Crouse and Cross claimed to
represent was so large it was
undefinable and therefore invalid.
"It should be noted that plaintiff
Crouse does not allege she has applied
for, and been denied, admission to
Stanford," Mclnerny's decision said.
He was careful to point out that the
issue at hand was not the existence of
an admissions quota, but whether
Crouse and Cross actually had the right
to sue, and didn't bar the road to
further court action against the
University.
HEW Investigation
Crouse indicated that for the time
being the two women probably
wouldn't press the issue, preferring to
stake their hopes on an investigation of
Stanford sex/racial policies by the
Department of Health, Education, and
Welfare. HEW could cut off Federal
funding to the University if the
investigation turns up anything (see
related story this page).
The University never fought the
complaint on its merits, concentrating
instead on the issue of the status of
Crouse and Cross. A Stanford demurrer
to that effect was filed with the court,
and Mclnery accepted it in his decision.
Crouse and Cross had tried to get a
temporary injunction preventing the
University from sending out acceptance
notices to freshmen last spring—which

the court rejected.
They also made an attempt to have
the Federal District Court consider the
case because it involved constitutional
questions, but the Court refused and
sent it back to Santa Clara. In the
course of that attempt, Crouse and
Cross asked the Federal court to
disqualify itself, since all the judges
were white males, and allegedly had ties
with Stanford. That failed, too.
Crouse was not happy about the
decision. "The decision said we're not
the injured parties, but our experience
has been that those who are
discriminated against are often the least
likely to complain. They're already in a
bad position, and a complaint only
worsens it. It's difficult to prove
specific cases of discrimination, but it's
easy to see an overall pattern."
She also took a slap at President
Lyman stating, "He said the other night
on KZSU that we have to do this
slowly. Well, hell, they've had 70 years
now."
An attempt to force Stanford to do
away with admission quotas for women
met with defeat last week when the
Santa Clara County Superior Court
threw out a lawsuit by two area
women.
Judge John S. Mclnemy ruled that
plaintiffs Nancy Jewell Cross, a chemist
and Stanford alumna, and Linda
Crouse, a University computer
programmer, had failed to prove that
they were affected by any sexist
policies or had "a community of
interest" with those who were.
