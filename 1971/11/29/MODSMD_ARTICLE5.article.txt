# Rose Bowl Tickets
## Students Pay More 
### 
Get out your wallets.
If you want to see the Incomparable
Leland Stanford Junior University
Marching Band show and the
accompanying football game at the
Rose Bowl on January 1, it's going to
cost the full ticket price of $10. Last
year's students paid $4, one half the
standard price. The basic price to the
New Year's day classic was raised this
year from $8 to $10.
"The decision (to end half-price
tickets for students) was made by the
Rose Bowl Committee and the Pacific-8
Conference before the game last year,"
Athletic Director Chuck Taylor said.
"Some students have approached us
about changing it, and we're going to
check around with the other
conference members.
"But I doubt if there will be any
change made at this late date," he
added.
On Sale Thursday
The tickets will go on sale Thursday
at 3 p.m. in Maples Pavilion, and the
ticket office will stay open till 10 p.m.
There will be three ticket lines, with
comparable tickets available at all
three.

Taylor said that the first people in
line will get the best "field position,"
i.e., tickets on the 50-yard line or
thereabouts. There is no guarantee of
how high up the seats will be, however.
Taylor also said that those students
who want to buy seats next to each
other should go through the same line
at the same time, and that all students
are guaranteed tickets.
One student can hold no more than
two student body cards.
Several Reasons
Taylor cited several reasons for the
decision to raise ticket prices.
"The scalping problem is out of
hand," he said. "We don't have any
documented estimates or anything, but
we know it's extensive. Just from
watching who sat in the stud?nt rooting
section last year we know that."
"It's not a school game in the true
sense of a school game, either," he
continued. He pointed out that other
bowl games don't offer a student
discount.
He admitted that the price is fairly
high for a student, though, and said
that the conference and the Rose Bowl
Committee might reconsider next year
iif enough students objected.
