## Third World Vs Bechtel International Center 
### 
Bechtel International Center is
not an impartial facility for
helpless foreign students at
Stanford. Ever since its inception
in 1963, Bechtel International
Center has been instrumental in
shaping and supplying a
comprador class of technocrats to
serve as the managerial elite of the
Third World.
Bechtel Corporation, initial
funder and namesake of the
I-Center, is one of the world's
largest engineering and
construction firms, and has a
vested interest in keeping the
Third World open for capitalistic
development. More than half of
the 1,200 foreign students here
are from the Third World, and the
overwhelming majority of them
are in science and engineering.
Thus Bechtel Corp. is particularly
interested in building a
technocratic elite of foreign
students who can return to
manage their countries and keep
them open for U.S. and Western
investment.
Bechtel International Center
was thus created to shape such an
elite, and its activities have been
directed towards acculturating
this elite to the American way of
life.
Bechtel Corporation
Founded during the
Spanish-American War, Bechtel
Corp. capitalised on this beginning
of big-league U.S. imperialism and
the colonisation of Cuba, Puerto
Rico, Guam, Philippines, and built
the bridges, railroads and
earthworks which literally paved
the way for U.S. worldwide
expansion.
Bechtel Coip. fed on and in
return built American
imperialism. In the 1920's and
30's Bechtel Corp. constructed
thousands of miles of pipelines
and many refineries in 23
countries, and expanded along
with U.W. involvement in the oil
of the Middle East.
Today Bechtel Corp. is involved
in almost all large-scale
development projects in the

world, from building missile silos,
nuclear power stations and
hydroelectric projects, to rapid
transit systems, petroleum and
petrochemical plants and mining
and metals projects.
It is critical to Bechtel Corp.'s
continued expansion that Third
World countries remain responsive
to the capitalist bloc. An
International Center whose
purpose is to acculturate foreign
students into bourgeois capitalist
culture will provide a future
guarantee of that responsiveness.
A picture of the Earth with
Bechtel's name across it is the
corporation's insignia. It is to
assure that Bechtel's name
remains stretched across the globe
that the Bechtel International
Center was created, and for which
it exists even today. Stephen
Bechtel Sr., a former trustee at
Stanford, saw to it that the
University would meet the needs
of his firm.
The I-Center
Bechtel Corp. not only funded
the construction of the I-Center,
but provides student financial aid
and funds for "innovative
programs." Certain unknown
"friends of the I-Center" are also
principal donors and retain a grasp
on the control of the I-Center.
The petroleum industry, with
which Bechtel Corp. is heavily
involved, has consistently used
I-Center facilities for the
recruitment of potential
engineers. An International
Program in Engineering Studies
(IPES) was initiated with the
School of Engineering to
facilitiate foreign students'
"anticipated roles in their home
countries." The I-Center is also
the campus representative for an
exchange program with the
Agency for International
Development (AID) whose
responsibility is to build an
entrepreneurial elite and
infrastructure conducive for
American investment and control
in the Third World.
Out of the 800 foreign visitors

to Stanford in 1970-71, half came
from Third World countries, and
nearly half of the total were
referrals from U.S. Govt, agencies.
The rest were sponsored by
agencies such as the Asia
Foundation, which until recently
was a conduit for CIA projects in
the Third World.
Hoover Institution by an
overwhelming majority'
participated in more campus
programs for visitors than any of
the other University divisions,
which included all the Graduate
Schools, Departments, SLAC,
Medical Center, etc.
Stanford Research Institute was
the principal participant in
off-campus programs which
encompassed business firms,
community colleges and local
organizations.

Since foreign visitors' programs
are to a large degree planned by
the I-Center's Office for Foreign
Visitors, it is evident that a
definite relationship exists
between the two most clearly
imperialistic institutions of
Stanford University and the
function of foreign visitors'
programs.
Even the superficially inane
community activities of the
voluntary organs of the I-Center
are permeated with a political
nature. A homestay program for
new foreign students involves only
solidly upper middle-class, white
families. Even the innumerable
social activities such as the
"Coffee Happy Hour", Easter Egg
Hunts, Barbecues, craft classes,
and pseudo-cultural programs do
not merely reflect an innocently

kwonping ho

benevolent paternalism towards
foreign cultures, but in actuality
serve to effectively insulate the
foreign student from ever facing
the deeper contradictions of
American society.
The principal demand of the
Third World Liberation Front is
that there be a comprehensive
restructuring of the I-Center so
that it will no longer reflect and
fulfill the needs of Bechtel Corp.
and U.S. economic imperialism
but instead reflect actual world
contradictions and respond in an
independent and serious manner.
All Third World peoples are urged
to participate in this restructuring
so that struggles for national
liberation will begin on this
campus, at the first link of a
subtle process of imperialism.

World Liberation Front.)

Out of the 800 foreign visitors

solidly upper middle-class, white

social activities such as the
"Coffee Happy Hour", Easter Egg
Hunts, Barbecues, craft classes,
and pseudo-cultural programs do
not merely reflect an innocently

benevolent paternalism towards
foreign cultures, but in actuality
serve to effectively insulate the
foreign student from ever facing
the deeper contradictions of
American society.
The principal demand of the
Third World Liberation Front is
that there be a comprehensive
restructuring of the I-Center so
that it will no longer reflect and
fulfill the needs of Bechtel Corp.

contradictions and respond in an
independent and serious manner.

Bechtel International Center is
not an impartial facility for
helpless foreign students at
Stanford. Ever since its inception
in 1963, Bechtel International
Center has been instrumental in
shaping and supplying a
comprador class of technocrats to
serve as the managerial elite of the
Third World.
Bechtel Corporation, initial
funder and namesake of the
I-Center, is one of the world's
largest engineering and
construction firms, and has a
vested interest in keeping the
Third World open for capitalistic
development. More than half of
the 1,200 foreign students here
are from the Third World, and the
overwhelming majority of them
are in science and engineering.
Thus Bechtel Corp. is particularly
interested in building a
technocratic elite of foreign
students who can return to
manage their countries and keep
them open for U.S. and Western
investment.
Bechtel International Center
was thus created to shape such an
elite, and its activities have been
directed towards acculturating
this elite to the American way of
life.
Bechtel Corporation
Founded during the
Spanish-American War, Bechtel
Corp. capitalised on this beginning
of big-league U.S. imperialism and
the colonisation of Cuba, Puerto
Rico, Guam, Philippines, and built
the bridges, railroads and
earthworks which literally paved
the way for U.S. worldwide
expansion.
Bechtel Coip. fed on and in
return built American
imperialism. In the 1920's and
30's Bechtel Corp. constructed
thousands of miles of pipelines
and many refineries in 23
countries, and expanded along
with U.W. involvement in the oil
of the Middle East.
Today Bechtel Corp. is involved
in almost all large-scale
development projects in the

world, from building missile silos,
nuclear power stations and
hydroelectric projects, to rapid
transit systems, petroleum and
petrochemical plants and mining
and metals projects.
It is critical to Bechtel Corp.'s
continued expansion that Third
World countries remain responsive
to the capitalist bloc. An
International Center whose
purpose is to acculturate foreign
students into bourgeois capitalist
culture will provide a future
guarantee of that responsiveness.
A picture of the Earth with
Bechtel's name across it is the

assure that Bechtel's name
remains stretched across the globe
that the Bechtel International
Center was created, and for which
it exists even today. Stephen
Bechtel Sr., a former trustee at
Stanford, saw to it that the
University would meet the needs
of his firm.

Bechtel Corp. not only funded
the construction of the I-Center,
but provides student financial aid
and funds for "innovative
programs." Certain unknown
"friends of the I-Center" are also
principal donors and retain a grasp

The petroleum industry, with
which Bechtel Corp. is heavily
involved, has consistently used
I-Center facilities for the
recruitment of potential

the colonisation of Cuba, Puerto
Rico, Guam, Philippines, and built
the bridges, railroads and
earthworks which literally paved
the way for U.S. worldwide
expansion.
Bechtel Coip. fed on and in
return built American
imperialism. In the 1920's and
30's Bechtel Corp. constructed
thousands of miles of pipelines
and many refineries in 23
countries, and expanded along
with U.W. involvement in the oil
of the Middle East.
Today Bechtel Corp. is involved
in almost all large-scale
development projects in the

world, from building missile silos,
nuclear power stations and
hydroelectric projects, to rapid
transit systems, petroleum and
petrochemical plants and mining
and metals projects.
It is critical to Bechtel Corp.'s
continued expansion that Third
World countries remain responsive
to the capitalist bloc. An
International Center whose
purpose is to acculturate foreign
students into bourgeois capitalist
culture will provide a future
guarantee of that responsiveness.
A picture of the Earth with
Bechtel's name across it is the
corporation's insignia. It is to
assure that Bechtel's name
remains stretched across the globe
that the Bechtel International
Center was created, and for which
it exists even today. Stephen
Bechtel Sr., a former trustee at
Stanford, saw to it that the
University would meet the needs
of his firm.
The I-Center
Bechtel Corp. not only funded
the construction of the I-Center,
but provides student financial aid
and funds for "innovative
programs." Certain unknown
"friends of the I-Center" are also
principal donors and retain a grasp
on the control of the I-Center.
The petroleum industry, with
which Bechtel Corp. is heavily
involved, has consistently used
I-Center facilities for the
recruitment of potential
engineers. An International
Program in Engineering Studies
(IPES) was initiated with the
School of Engineering to
facilitiate foreign students'
"anticipated roles in their home
countries." The I-Center is also
the campus representative for an
exchange program with the
Agency for International
Development (AID) whose
responsibility is to build an
entrepreneurial elite and
infrastructure conducive for
American investment and control
in the Third World.
Out of the 800 foreign visitors

to Stanford in 1970-71, half came
from Third World countries, and
nearly half of the total were
referrals from U.S. Govt, agencies.
The rest were sponsored by
agencies such as the Asia
Foundation, which until recently
was a conduit for CIA projects in
the Third World.
Hoover Institution by an
overwhelming majority'
participated in more campus
programs for visitors than any of
the other University divisions,
which included all the Graduate
Schools, Departments, SLAC,
Medical Center, etc.
Stanford Research Institute was
the principal participant in
off-campus programs which
encompassed business firms,
community colleges and local
organizations.

Since foreign visitors' programs
are to a large degree planned by
the I-Center's Office for Foreign
Visitors, it is evident that a
definite relationship exists
between the two most clearly
imperialistic institutions of
Stanford University and the
function of foreign visitors'
programs.
Even the superficially inane
community activities of the
voluntary organs of the I-Center
are permeated with a political
nature. A homestay program for
new foreign students involves only
solidly upper middle-class, white
families. Even the innumerable
social activities such as the
"Coffee Happy Hour", Easter Egg
Hunts, Barbecues, craft classes,
and pseudo-cultural programs do
not merely reflect an innocently

kwonping ho

benevolent paternalism towards
foreign cultures, but in actuality
serve to effectively insulate the
foreign student from ever facing
the deeper contradictions of
American society.
The principal demand of the
Third World Liberation Front is
that there be a comprehensive
restructuring of the I-Center so
that it will no longer reflect and
fulfill the needs of Bechtel Corp.
and U.S. economic imperialism
but instead reflect actual world
contradictions and respond in an
independent and serious manner.
All Third World peoples are urged
to participate in this restructuring
so that struggles for national
liberation will begin on this
campus, at the first link of a
subtle process of imperialism.
(Kwonping Ho for the Third
World Liberation Front.)


"About every four years there's as much sap outside the
trees as in . .
Bechtel International Center is
not an impartial facility for
helpless foreign students at
Stanford. Ever since its inception
in 1963, Bechtel International
Center has been instrumental in
shaping and supplying a
comprador class of technocrats to
serve as the managerial elite of the
Third World.
Bechtel Corporation, initial
funder and namesake of the
I-Center, is one of the world's
largest engineering and
construction firms, and has a

Third World open for capitalistic
development. More than half of
the 1,200 foreign students here
are from the Third World, and the

are in science and engineering.
Thus Bechtel Corp. is particularly
