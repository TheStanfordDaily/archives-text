## Stale Of Higher Education: Chaos 
### 
An Open Letter To President
Lyman:
I am a member of the Western
Civilization staff in the History
Department, and after six years at
Stanford I will be leaving this
year, hopefully, for a permanent
teaching position elsewhere. My
purpose in writing this letter is to
share with you some of my
reflections on the state of higher
education generally and,
particularly, at Stanford
University.
At the outset I should like to
make it abundantly clear that this
letter is not written in a spirit of
personal animus towards Stanford
or towards you. My graduate
education and teaching at
Stanford were both rewarding and
enjoyable, and in every way this
university has been kind and
generous to me. I have, then, no
complaints, no personal axe to
grind, and I wish you personally
only the best of fortune. I am,
however, gripped by the direct
apprehension for the fate of
higher learning here and elsewhere
in America, and it is my thoughts
on this matter that I wish to share
with you as a fellow gentleman
and scholar. Before continuing I
might say that I am a Roman
Catholic and a conservative in the
traditionalist sense of both those
terms, so that will give you an
indication of the angle of vision
from which I regard the world.
Put quite baldly, I am
convinced that higher education,
and my concern here is with the
undergraduate college, lies in a
state of utter and, I fear, hopeless
chaos and degradation. I say
hopeless because 1 believe the
fundamental forces and
conditions of a liberal, egalitarian,
technological, secular society
render the situation inevitable,
but we must set this larger
problem aside, or we shall never

get around to more tangible
considerations.
First of all, it appears to me
that Stanford and other
universities no longer have a
coherent conception of their
purpose, or, even possessing that,
the moral fortitude to assert and
maintain it. Paradoxically, the
modern university attempts to do
everything and to be everything to
everyone with the result, of
course, that it stands clearly for
nothing. Were this even a desirable
objective, I do not believe it
would be possible. But for some
time now in the West, and in
America especially since World
War 11, the universities have
rushed head-long into the business
of being all-purpose service
stations, into being socially
"relevant" multiversities. This
tendency, of course, is rooted in
the revered liberal view that real
knowledge must be pragmatically
useful, must be instrumental, but,
alas, I think it is plain that this
fallacious notion has brought us
to the end of our tether. The
radicals, I believe, have a rather
telling and, I am afraid,
unanswerable point when they
charge that the liberal university
has been a social service station
and that they now merely want to
change it to different instrumental
purposes.
Frightful Paternalism
There is one more aspect of this
part of the problem I wish to
remark on, and that is the
misconceived and frightful
paternalism that prevails in such a
supposedly emancipated world as
the modern university. I say
misconceived because, as a
traditionalist, I certainly believe in
a proper paternalism by which I
mean principally that the elders in
the university community, as in
the family, ought to be the moral
models and leaders for the young
entrusted to their tutelage and,

beyond that, to look out in a
broad way for their best interests
and to protect them, and all of us,
from the worst follies of their lack
of experience and wisdom. This
must be done above all by
example, at times by persuasion,
and when necessary at times by
force.
But I detect at Stanford and
other colleges today an obsessive
concern to create a "total life
experience" for students, a desire,
again impossible actually to
achieve and in any event highly
undesirable, to provide the young
person with all the human
enrichment and true education
which only traditional institutions
such as family, friendship, church,
and local neighborhood can offer.
I am well aware that the
enthusiastic and well intentioned
liberal might claim that these
institutions have collapsed in our
society and that we must,
therefore, fill the gap with
something else. I would simply
contend that other means cannot
appropriately fulfill the functions
which these institutions did and
that, if they are moribund which I
fairly concede, our objective must
be to resuscitate them and not to
supplant them with pernicious
surrogates.
In this respect I would draw
your attention to an article by
Nathan Glazer in the September
issue of Commentary entitled
"The Limits of Social Policy."
Professor Glazer acutely, I think,
observes that there is a limit to
the feasibility and desirability of
liberal social legislation and that
in the future we must attempt to
preserve and revive the traditional
institutions which a misguided
social engineering has tended to
replace.
Supply And Demand
Recently I happened to have a
conversation with one of our
liberal, and more illustrious,
professors of history in which he
candidly declared that he could
not justify the study of one
subject more than any other and
that there was no way of
distinguishing, beyond one's own
personal "taste," between the
goodness or badness, truth or
falsity, significance or triviality of
choices in our moral and
intellectual lives. Indeed, when
called upon, this man could not
even justify the study of his own
subject of history; his criterion of
value, insofar as he admitted one,

was the liberal market place
principle of supply and demand.
When I recovered from the
shock and dismay of this
experience, it occurred to me that
here was an open avowal of some
of the pandemic diseases rotting
the very foundations of our
civilization and education. This
conversation reminded me less
drastically of the response I
received one day at a Western
Civilization staff meeting when I
asked if there were not some basic
elements of knowledge with
which an educated man might be
expected to be familiar. The stark
answer was "no." Once more, for
our purposes here we may put
aside the broader moral and
cultural import of these issues and
focus instead upon their
immediate bearing on university
education.
At Stanford and other
universities today there seems to
me to be, among others, two
principles at loose which are
wreaking havoc upon a sound
education: the notion that all
subjects are equal and that
nothing is of any more intrinsic
importance than anything else;
and the egalitarian corollary that
all people are equal and,
therefore, each individual is the
most suitable judge of what is best
for him. As it stands today at
Stanford, a student can with
virtually no restrictions throw
together any farrago of trivial and
disparate courses and receive a
degree for it. To be sure, excellent
courses and outstanding teachers
may be found at Stanford, but
there is here no over-arching,
selective, integrative principle of
education. SWOPSI is on a par
with Shakespeare, pottery with
metaphysics, human sexuality
with human history.
The Liberal Education
Now I do not suppose for an
instant that all people are or
should be suited for and inclined
towards a liberal education, nor
do I imagine that the most
important things in life are to be
obtained from a liberal education,
or academic training of any sort.
But for those who propose to take
up what used to be called a
"liberal education," egalitarianism
as either a substantive principle or
mode of procedure is a patent
contradiction. It would be, I
think, tediously unnecessary for
me to reiterate here what the
guiding principles of a liberal
education ought to be. Suffice it
to say that I take John Henry
Newman's The Idea of a
University, and its attendant
criticism of secular liberal
education, to be as valid today as
it was some one hundred years

John w. coffey

ago. Anyone familiar with
Cardinal Newman's work, as I am
sure you are, will recognize how
far we have departed today from
his ideal.
Before I draw this letter to a
close there is one more theme I
should like to raise, and that is the
principle of authority. A short
time ago another of our professors
of history told me that he thought
one of the greatest dilemmas
facing this generation would be to
learn how to discriminate between
a principled position and a
position based upon authority.
The dichotomy was clear to him;
it is not to me. It is my belief that
neither reason nor historical
experience warrants us in
imagining that principle can be
sustained in this imperfect world
without a structure of authority.
That is as true of education as
it is of the family or society;
authority there will always be in
human affairs, even in the liberal
market place society, so that the
only germane questions pertain to
the origin, means, and degree of
authority. Those of a
traditionalist cast of mind will
also understand that it is not
participation in but immunity
from direct authority which
preserves liberty, that an
authority equally diffused can be
every . bit as tyrannical as
centralized authority. But what I
should especially like to mention
here is a point Professor Robert
Nisbet makes in his book, The
Degradation of the Academic
Dogmaâ€”that a restoration of
authority is a sine qua non if the
universities are to survive at all. I
am also convinced, as I take
Professor Nisbet to be, that the
university, like the family, is not a
proper sphere for an equal
diffusion of authority.
I sense that already this letter
has gone on sufficiently far, and
so it is best to bring my comments
to a finish. One might very well
discuss the fate of the Western
Civilization program at Stanford
as a microcosmic paradigm of the
ailments afflicting education at
Stanford. Western Civilization, to
the joy of many and the
indifference of most, has indeed
gone out with a whimper and not
a bang. But after a year of
personal embroilment in the
catastrophe, I frankly am too
weary and discouraged to discuss
it any longer. In the future I
desire personally to be able to
return to teach at a Catholic
college. I hope against hope that
in the Catholic tradition there still
exist the remnants from which
one might salvage an education
and withstand the onslaught of
modernity and barbarism, but I
am not optimistic. The Church
too must exist in the world, and it
is not altogether escaping the
ravages of our time.
Nor do I write this letter to you
with any undue expectations. My
worst fear is that most of what 1
regretfully observe is out of your
or anyone's power to alter or
reverse. I write largely from a
feeling T. S. Eliot once expressed
that in the realm of religious and
cultural values "we fight rather to
keep something alive than in the
expectation that anything will
triumph." Moreover, I appreciate
the extraordinary demands placed
upon your attention, and so it will
be enough if you give this letter a
fraction of the consideration I
have given it. Again, I wish you
well for the future, and I thank
you for your time anr
consideration.
Respectfully yours.
Dr. John W. Coffey
