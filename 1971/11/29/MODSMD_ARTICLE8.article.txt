## New Grievance Procedures 
### 
In a letter to the Editor published in the Daily on
Tuesday, November 23, Michael Bacon has
criticized President Lyman's appointments to the
list of prospective hearing officers established under
the new grievance procedures. Mr. Bacon complains
of a lack of employee participation in the
appointment process and suggests the
administration has "stacked the deck" against
any prospective grievant.
The assumption implicit in Mr. Bacon's
observations is that any process or procedure which
does not incorporate participatory decision making
at every step is inherently unfair. At the outset if
Mr. Bacon and other interested individuals would
focus their attention upon the qualifications of the
arbitrators selected, rather than the method of
selection, they would see that, at least in the present
situation, such an assumption is unfounded. The
Daily story announcing the President's appointment
of the arbitrators omitted reference to the
qualifications of the five individuals appointed. This
information will be published in the next issue of
Staff News which is scheduled to be distributed on
December 2.
In the meantime the Personnel Office has from
each arbitrator a detailed resume which employees
may inspect. Those who choose to review this
information will see that each appointee is an
arbitrator of distinction with experience which is
particularly suitable to the university context. They
will find, to take but one example, that Professor
Alice Cook, one of the appointees, was Ombudsman
at Cornell and chaired the Ad Hoc Panel for
recommendatory fact-finding for the Cornell
University employee grievance system. She was
formerly a social worker and a labor organizer and
certainly no management "tool".
The reason why the administration decided upon
the selection procedure for hearing officers has
already been explained by Vice President
Augsburger in his letter announcing the new

procedures to the staff. In brief, the administration
sought to insure that the list of prospective hearing
officers would be comprised of persons with
knowledge and understanding of
employer-employee relations in a university setting.
Labor arbitration is most successful as a means of
grievance resolution when the arbitrator is able to
bring to bear upon the issue presented his own
special knowledge of the area of employment
concerned. The selection panel consisted of three
individuals who were themselves experienced
arbitrators and familiar with the special problems of
universities. They recommended the five individuals
whom they considered to be well qualified to serve
as arbitrators in the university setting. They did not
recommend, and certainly were not requested to
recommend, individuals with a pro-administration
bias.
In the final analysis, the merits of the new
grievance procedure should, and undoubtedly will,
be judged by the extent to which it is successful in
providing fair and equitable solutions of employee
grievances. Whether or not the "deck" has been
"stacked" is for the employees to decide, but I hope
they will draw their conclusions from knowledge of
how the procedures actually work, rather than from
the initial suspicions of a few employees. In drawing
their conclusions, employees should also consider
that the University has never been under an
obligation to establish a grievance procedure of any
kind. If the University really wanted to "stack the
deck" against its employees, the most certain way
of doing so would be to have no grievance
procedure at allâ€”not a grievance procedure which
provides for final and binding decision-making by an
outside hearing officer. To paraphrase a quote from
an early American statesman, if this be
"high-handed and arbitrary" administrative action,
make the most of it.
