# protecting government, not people
## Police — The Coercive Monopoly 
### 
First of two parts
In last Wednesday's Daily,
Steven Ungar discussed examples
of police corruption in New York
City. Because these and other
police malefactions can and do
occur not only in New York, but
all over the United States, it is
worthwhile to consider the
fundamental nature of the police
in contemporary American
society and how police services
might be improved.
It is commonly held that in a
democratic country such as the
United States, the function of the
police is to protect the citizens,
while in a dictatorship police exist
to protect the government. In the
United States, however, generally
only high government officials are
given direct police protection. So
far as the typical citizen is
concerned, the police will try only
to apprehend and punish criminals
after a crime is committed.
It might be argued that a police
force protects all citizens in an
indirect way, that the very
presence of police (meaning both
specific policemen in a given
place at a given time and the
general existence of a police
force) discourages crime. While
this point is valid, one must not
overlook two other functions of
police in American society—their
role in black markets, and their
enforcement of laws which violate
your rights.
A black market is a market in
an illegal good or service or a
market in a legal good or service
traded under illegal conditions,
e.g., by selling commodities at
prices which violate government
price controls. The most
important difference between a
black market operator and a free
market entrepreneur is that to be
successful, the former necessarily
has to possess great skill in
evading laws. Because of this,
black market activities tend to
attract criminals. The three largast
black markets in America today
are those of drugs, gambling, and
prostitution.
All are activities which
individuals should be free to
patronize if they desire. But by

enforcing laws which prohibit
people from trading in these areas
the police, by and large, reserve
these lucrative fields for criminals.
The government creation of black
markets is undoubtedly the
Syndicate's greatest asset. For this
reason, Syndicate lawyers were
among the strongest fighters
against the repeal of Prohibition.
The restrictions against trade
discussed above fall into the
category of government laws
which violate your rights. But
there are many others. If you
should try to resist slavery in the
form of the "draft", for example,
the police will protect not you
but your enslavers. Policemen are
fond of saying, "We don't make
the laws, we just enforce them,"
and one might argue that the
thrust of this article so far is
against certain laws and not
against the police per se. However,
if we accept that policemen do
nothing more and nothing less
than enforce the laws, then ipso
facto, we are forced to conclude
that police do indeed protect the
government, since laws are all
government creations, and the
police enforce them irrespective
of whether they are just (e.g., laws
prohibiting assault) or unjust (e.g.,
laws prohibiting gambling).
Recall that this is the role
usually attributed to police in a
dictatorship. Without police,
unjust laws would be merely ink
scratchings on paper and of no
harm to people. However, in our
society, we are granted a package
of "free" police services and are
not able to choose for ourselves
what sort of protection we want.
Thus, if the government decrees
that we shall be "protected" from
evading the draft, then we are.
Under the present system, there
are only two basic ways to
ameliorate this situation. One is to
push for the repeal of unjust laws.
The other is to try to persuade the
police to perform more
satisfactorily—to cease corruption
and not to express their racism or
political views on innocent
victims. The only avenues to this
last end, however, are various

methods of moral persuasion,
such as television programs and
magazine articles.
Now the basic reason
policemen (and most people in
general) work is to command a
salary. Under the present system,
a policeman's salary does not
generally increase with the value
of his service to the community.
In fact, a good case can be made
for the hypothesis that the worse
policemen perform, the more
money they make. Certainly this
is the case with corruption.
But another interesting pillar
for this argument is that, in recent
years, the federal and state
legislatures have allocated more
money, often in the form of
higher police salaries, to police
forces in high crime areas. Since
poor police service is more likely

to lead to higher crime rates, it
can be argued that a policeman
seeks to maximize his income by
serving the community poorly,
since via legislation, this
eventually leads to an increase in
his salary.
The basic problem here is really
that policemen do not have
customers in the free market sense
of the word, since their revenue
does not come directly from those
they serve, as, say, a storekeeper's
does, but rather is granted by
other government officials.
Moreover, the whole government
police system is a coercive
monopoly, so that no matter how
lax, inefficient, or corrupt it
becomes, it need fear no
competition. With no worry about
competition and no direct
incentives to please its customers.

it is no wonder that police service
is as bad as it is. Tomorrow's
article will discuss an alternative
police system which has a built-in
mechanism to promote the kind
of service people want.
