# Kaplan: Provocative Law Professor
## 
### DAVID THIEMANN 
"It is customary to add at this point that any
errors or distortions are my responsibility and not
theirs (those who reviewed the manuscript]. This, of
course, is true; but, on the other hand, candor
compels the acknowledgement that if, indeed, there
are any errors or distortions, / will hold personally
responsible those who allowed me to fall into error. "
This passage from the preface to law professor
John Kaplan's Marijuana — The New Prohibition
could also serve as an introduction to Kaplan. Pithy,
humorous, and incisive, Kaplan surprises students and
colleagues with his quick wit and exhaustive
knowledge of criminal law.
"Teaching with him is both a delight and an
education, and sometimes a challenge to get words in
edgewise," remarked Paul Brest, who instructs a
first-year criminal law course with Kaplan.
However, these qualities sometimes intimidate or
antagonize students in his Law School classes and in
an undergraduate course on "the criminal law and the
'•riminal system."
To provoke thought and argument, Kaplan
deliberately presents more conservative opinions in
his first year law courses than those he expresses in
the undergraduate class. Five years ago, however, he
took a liberal position to force a conservative
majority to reply.
Constantly In Motion
While teaching, Kaplan appears to move
constantly, walking casually back and forth across the

stage or in the aisles in Dinkelspiel Auditorium, or
behind the rail in the Moot Court Room, where he
teaches criminal law.
This effect is accentuated by his pre-lecture habit
of removing his coat, hanging it from any convenient
object, rolling or pushing up the sleeves of his white
shirt, and putting his hands in his pockets.
Kaplan punctuates his lectures with emphatic
gestures, pantomiming questions, answers and
comments while speaking them, and immediately
communicating his opinion of any issue.
Kaplan obviously enjoys his teaching and research
immensely, but he first entered law school without
intending to become a lawyer. After earning a physics
A.B. at Harvard, he returned to enroll in a graduate
school, and was admitted into the law school. He
only intended to study law for a year, but continued
because he "loved it." After graduating magna cum
laude in 1954, he worked for a year as a law clerk for
a U.S. Supreme Court Justice, which, as he had
expected, was "great fun."
After this experience, Kaplan practiced law for
three months as a defense attorney, and for four
years with the Department of Justice. As a Special
U.S. Attorney, he tried tax fraud cases in Illinois for a
year, because "it was my method of squaring things
with poor people." He then transferred to the
Northern District of California as an Assistant U.S.
Attorney, specializing in cases no one else would
prosecute.
"I tried to discourage guilty pleas then," Kaplan
recalled, "because I loved to try cases."

In class, he constantly reminds students of the
practical considerations legal work involves. "I don't
know whether the psychiatrist has been bought by
the defense," he told students who were discussing
legal justifications for murder.
Challenges Jury System
In the same way, he illustrated the weaknesses of
the jury system to his undergraduate class, while
challenging student preconceptions, when he
informed them that "jurors may very well be gullible
people, and they may be gullible on the side of the
prosecution as well as that of the defense."
Because Kaplan believes continuing research
essential to effective teaching, he continues to study
drug laws, a field in which he is a recognized expert.
"I serve as a national information bank on the
legalization of marijuana, and this takes up a large
percentage of my time," he explained.
He first became involved in the marijuana question
when, in 1966, he was invited to become one of six
Reporters to the "Joint Legislative Committee to
Revise the Penal Code" in California. He was assigned
to study drug laws, at the time suspecting only that
"the penalties for marijuana offenses were somewhat
too stringent."
In 1969, shortly after Kaplan and the others
released a "Preliminary Tentative Draft" which
advocated the legalization of marijuana, the
Legislative Committee summarily fired all of the
Reporters, replacing them with a prosecutor from the
Attorney General's office.
