# 'Angel Street'
## A 						Marvelous Melodrama 
### STU ALLEN 
Very simply, I have not enjoyed a play as much as "Angel Street"
in longer than I can really remember. Beyond its other achievements,
this melodrama currently being performed by the Berkeley Repertory
Theater, has realized the key element of enjoyable drama: a rapport
between the actors and the audience. When this rapport is created, the
actors are people and players, not mere figures on a stage. The sense
of unity that emerges is refreshing and invigorating, as it flows from
the cast to the onlookers and back again.
Perhaps the main reason for the success of this production was the
circumstances under which it was reviewed. Most of the audience
seemed to be friends of the cast, some intimately so, as evidenced by
special cheers for some minor actions. The atmosphere was very close
to party-like: yet no one would suggest that this could be the case if
the play had been a failure.
Modern Melodrama
Even friends cannot hide boredom, and no subterfuge was needed
on opening night. "Angel Street" is a gaslight melodrama that is
peculiarly modern in its treatment ofnormalityand madness. The crux
of the play, written by Patrick Hamilton, is a young wife who fears
she is going crazy like her mother who died in an asylum for the
insane. Her fears are occasioned by events which draw Inspector
Rough (quite literally) into the case.
The compulsiveness of these two characters, however, pales beside
the raging, beast-like mentality o'f the lady's husband, Mr.
Manningham. A crime has been committed, and only two men know
the true facts of it. To one it is a mere theory, unbelieved by all but
himself and the other, to whom it is a haunting, frustrating passion.
Even the amateur psychologist, then, will enjoy this production. I
had not had the privilege of viewing any previous productions at this
theater, but I heard at the opening show that this was their first
top-notch set. And it's true: the set, designed by Ronald Pratt and
Eugene Angell, is a realistic version of the Victorian way of life.
Subtle Design
Dark wood, gas lights, leaded windows, and a dressing closet are
some of the important features of the stage design which, thankfully,
is subtle enough to refrain from overpowering the audience. Any
overkill on the part of the designers would be disaterous in as small a
theater as the Berkeley rep is.
As I have alluded to, the acting is largely excellent. Henry Hoffman
is delightful as the Inspector: he bounces around the stage, and stops
at off-tempo moments, bringing laughter from the audience. He
speaks firmly to Mrs. Manningham, earnestly attempting to convince
her to trust in him and his theory; when she does, he turns her off
with a humorous joke about his "dandy" shirt or some other
irrelevant matter. The rapport that he created with the audience was
that he shared with us the fun and excitement he, Henry Hoffman,
felt on stage, in that role.
Convincing Professionalism
Mr. and Mrs. Manningham did not have such light-hearted roles, yet
each showed a convincing professionalism in dealing with the
complexities and difficulties of their roles. Holly Barron (Mrs.
Manningham) came through remarkably in the final scene when no
one knew for sure whether or not she really had recovered her full
sanity. Similarly, James Edmondson (Mr. Manningham) kept his
madness fully in check and hidden from the audience until the right
time, and then displayed a frightening lunacy.
The only glaring weakness of the play was in the script. There are

simply too many climactic moments for either the cast or the
audience to sustain the tension. This difficulty may be inherent to the
genre of suspense thrillers, but at any rate, "Angel Street" suffers
from it. Some may find the play shallow, others may not believe it,
but they will undoubtedly form the minority.
