Shockley Defends Theory
DAVIS, Calif. — Nobel prize winner Dr. William Shockley
spelled out his theory on genetic disadvantages of blacks
last night and blasted students who disrupted a lecture
scheduled a week earlier.
Shockley, 61, whose work on transistors netted him a
Nobel prize in 1956, was interrupted only for questions
from about 50 students, including four blacks, and by mild
outbursts of laughter when a cuckoo clock marked each
half hour.
Shockley told University of California at Davis students
that the earlier disruption at nearby Sacramento State
College "was a symptom of a serious national illness."
"The disruption was an expression of distrust in one of
the most valuable tools invented by humanity — freedom
of speech . .he said.
"My research leads me inescapably to the opinion that
blacks' disadvantages are chiefly hereditary and racially
genetic in origin," he said.
But he said at the unannounced session that the black
students who grabbed the microphone at the start of his
speech a week ago "were courageous, idealistic youths."
The physicist then began a lengthy explanation of how
he says statistics show that whites have a genetic edge
compared to blacks as evidenced in intelligence tests.
He proposed that cash bonuses be offered blacks and
whites for sterilization at a rate of $1,000 for each point
below an IQ of 100, noting such a system would cut costs
in care for mental retards.
Shockley said the threat of genetic "downbreeding"
could lead to "a form of genetic enslavement" for blacks.
Dock Workers Return
NEW YORK — The vanguard of 45,000 East and Gulf
Coast longshoremen returned to piers from Maine to Texas
yesterday, their two-month strike interrupted by
Taft-Hartley back-to-work orders.
However, only a small fraction of the estimated 200
ships idled by the walkout were being handled at the outset
of the strike moratorium. In Boston, a shipping association
spokesman, Robert Calder, estimated it would take two
days to resume full operations.
"Machinery has got to be serviced and paperwork done,"
he explained.
Talks remained at a standstill between the AFL-CIO
International Longshoremen's Association and New York
shipping firms. It was the issue of a continued guaranteed
annual wage for 18,000 New York dockers that triggered
the Oct. 1 walkout.
Only about 1,800 of New York's longshoremen found
assignments awaiting them upon their return to the piers
after 59 days of idleness.
President Nixon invoked the 80-day cooling off
provision of the Taft-Hartley Act last Friday night.
Longshoremen began returning to work Saturday in
Mobile, Ala.
Longshoremen in Philadelphia, Savannah, Ga., and New
Orleans, La., had returned to work midway in the strike,

under local court mandates. But they resumed their
walkouts later, and returned a second time under the
Taft-Hartley edict.
Frazier Guilty Of Murder
REDWOOD CITY — John Linley Frazier, 25, was
convicted yesterday of first-degree murder in the slayings
of a surgeon and four others in a hilltop mansion near
Santa Cruz more than a year ago.
The same Superior Court jury, which began deliberations
last Friday in the trial, must now determine if Frazier is
sane.
Frazier, a former automobile mechanic, was convicted of
five counts of murder in the killings of Dr. Victor Ohta,
three members of Ohta's family and his secretary, Dorothy
Cadwallader.
Nixon To Veto Tax Bill
WASHINGTON — President Nixon declared yesterday he
will veto the pending tax-cut bill unless it is stripped of
both a check-off plan to finance presidential campaigns and
a set of "budget-busting Senate amendments."
Nixon's warning was relayed by his chief Capitol Hill
lobbyist, Clark MacGregor, as a conference committee met
to settle differences between House and Senate versions of
the bill.
Rep. Wilbur D. Mills, D-Ark., discounted the threat,
telling reporters:
"It's not the first time a statement like that has been
made. It's a polite way to put pressure on the conference."
Mills has said that if Nixon vetoes this bill it will be
impossible to pass this year a tax-cut measure which is a
major part of the presidential program for stimulating the
economy.
No Amnesty In Prison Riot
TRENTON, N.J. — The agreement that ended the Rahway
Prison rebellion did not preclude the possibility of
disciplinary or criminal action against inmates involved in
the uprising, Gov. William T. Cahill said yesterday.
Cahill told a news conference he would not speculate on
the possibility of criminal action. But he said the agreement
that ended the 24-hour Thanksgiving Day uprising made no
promise of legal amnesty.
The governor said the agreement that ended the uprising
guaranteed only two concessions: that there would be no
physical reprisals against inmates by guards and that there
would be full negotiations.
"There was never any agreement of no retribution"
through possible disciplinary or criminal action, Cahill said.
"The guards are absolutely keeping faith" on the guarantee
against reprisals, he added.
Cahill said a full investigation of the rebellion was
underway and that he was awaiting a report from Atty.
Gen. George F. Kugler Jr. before deciding on possible
prosecution of inmates.

NEW YORK — The vanguard of 45,000 East and Gulf
Coast longshoremen returned to piers from Maine to Texas
yesterday, their two-month strike interrupted by
Taft-Hartley back-to-work orders.
However, only a small fraction of the estimated 200
ships idled by the walkout were being handled at the outset
of the strike moratorium. In Boston, a shipping association
spokesman, Robert Calder, estimated it would take two
days to resume full operations.
"Machinery has got to be serviced and paperwork done,"
he explained.
Talks remained at a standstill between the AFL-CIO
International Longshoremen's Association and New York
shipping firms. It was the issue of a continued guaranteed
annual wage for 18,000 New York dockers that triggered
the Oct. 1 walkout.
Only about 1,800 of New York's longshoremen found
assignments awaiting them upon their return to the piers
after 59 days of idleness.
President Nixon invoked the 80-day cooling off
provision of the Taft-Hartley Act last Friday night.
Longshoremen began returning to work Saturday in
Mobile, Ala.
Longshoremen in Philadelphia, Savannah, Ga., and New
Orleans, La., had returned to work midway in the strike,

under local court mandates. But they resumed their
walkouts later, and returned a second time under the
Taft-Hartley edict.
Frazier Guilty Of Murder
REDWOOD CITY — John Linley Frazier, 25, was
convicted yesterday of first-degree murder in the slayings
of a surgeon and four others in a hilltop mansion near
Santa Cruz more than a year ago.
The same Superior Court jury, which began deliberations
last Friday in the trial, must now determine if Frazier is
sane.
Frazier, a former automobile mechanic, was convicted of
five counts of murder in the killings of Dr. Victor Ohta,
three members of Ohta's family and his secretary, Dorothy
Cadwallader.
Nixon To Veto Tax Bill
WASHINGTON — President Nixon declared yesterday he
will veto the pending tax-cut bill unless it is stripped of
both a check-off plan to finance presidential campaigns and
a set of "budget-busting Senate amendments."
Nixon's warning was relayed by his chief Capitol Hill
lobbyist, Clark MacGregor, as a conference committee met
to settle differences between House and Senate versions of
the bill.
Rep. Wilbur D. Mills, D-Ark., discounted the threat,
telling reporters:
"It's not the first time a statement like that has been
made. It's a polite way to put pressure on the conference."
Mills has said that if Nixon vetoes this bill it will be
impossible to pass this year a tax-cut measure which is a
major part of the presidential program for stimulating the
economy.
No Amnesty In Prison Riot
TRENTON, N.J. — The agreement that ended the Rahway
Prison rebellion did not preclude the possibility of
disciplinary or criminal action against inmates involved in
the uprising, Gov. William T. Cahill said yesterday.
Cahill told a news conference he would not speculate on
the possibility of criminal action. But he said the agreement
that ended the 24-hour Thanksgiving Day uprising made no
promise of legal amnesty.
The governor said the agreement that ended the uprising
guaranteed only two concessions: that there would be no
physical reprisals against inmates by guards and that there
would be full negotiations.
"There was never any agreement of no retribution"
through possible disciplinary or criminal action, Cahill said.
"The guards are absolutely keeping faith" on the guarantee
against reprisals, he added.
Cahill said a full investigation of the rebellion was
underway and that he was awaiting a report from Atty.
Gen. George F. Kugler Jr. before deciding on possible
prosecution of inmates.
Shockley Defends Theory
DAVIS, Calif. — Nobel prize winner Dr. William Shockley
spelled out his theory on genetic disadvantages of blacks
last night and blasted students who disrupted a lecture
scheduled a week earlier.
Shockley, 61, whose work on transistors netted him a
Nobel prize in 1956, was interrupted only for questions
from about 50 students, including four blacks, and by mild
outbursts of laughter when a cuckoo clock marked each
half hour.
Shockley told University of California at Davis students
that the earlier disruption at nearby Sacramento State
College "was a symptom of a serious national illness."
"The disruption was an expression of distrust in one of
the most valuable tools invented by humanity — freedom
of speech . .he said.
"My research leads me inescapably to the opinion that
blacks' disadvantages are chiefly hereditary and racially
genetic in origin," he said.
But he said at the unannounced session that the black
students who grabbed the microphone at the start of his
speech a week ago "were courageous, idealistic youths."
The physicist then began a lengthy explanation of how
he says statistics show that whites have a genetic edge
compared to blacks as evidenced in intelligence tests.
He proposed that cash bonuses be offered blacks and
whites for sterilization at a rate of $1,000 for each point
below an IQ of 100, noting such a system would cut costs
in care for mental retards.
Shockley said the threat of genetic "downbreeding"
could lead to "a form of genetic enslavement" for blacks.

convicted yesterday of first-degree murder in the slayings
of a surgeon and four others in a hilltop mansion near
Santa Cruz more than a year ago.
The same Superior Court jury, which began deliberations
last Friday in the trial, must now determine if Frazier is
sane.
Frazier, a former automobile mechanic, was convicted of
five counts of murder in the killings of Dr. Victor Ohta,
three members of Ohta's family and his secretary, Dorothy
Cadwallader.
Nixon To Veto Tax Bill
WASHINGTON — President Nixon declared yesterday he
will veto the pending tax-cut bill unless it is stripped of
both a check-off plan to finance presidential campaigns and
a set of "budget-busting Senate amendments."
Nixon's warning was relayed by his chief Capitol Hill
lobbyist, Clark MacGregor, as a conference committee met
to settle differences between House and Senate versions of
the bill.
Rep. Wilbur D. Mills, D-Ark., discounted the threat,
telling reporters:
"It's not the first time a statement like that has been
made. It's a polite way to put pressure on the conference."
Mills has said that if Nixon vetoes this bill it will be
impossible to pass this year a tax-cut measure which is a
major part of the presidential program for stimulating the
economy.
No Amnesty In Prison Riot
TRENTON, N.J. — The agreement that ended the Rahway
Prison rebellion did not preclude the possibility of
disciplinary or criminal action against inmates involved in
the uprising, Gov. William T. Cahill said yesterday.
Cahill told a news conference he would not speculate on
the possibility of criminal action. But he said the agreement
that ended the 24-hour Thanksgiving Day uprising made no
promise of legal amnesty.
The governor said the agreement that ended the uprising
guaranteed only two concessions: that there would be no
physical reprisals against inmates by guards and that there
would be full negotiations.
"There was never any agreement of no retribution"
through possible disciplinary or criminal action, Cahill said.
"The guards are absolutely keeping faith" on the guarantee
against reprisals, he added.
Cahill said a full investigation of the rebellion was
underway and that he was awaiting a report from Atty.
Gen. George F. Kugler Jr. before deciding on possible
prosecution of inmates.
Shockley Defends Theory
DAVIS, Calif. — Nobel prize winner Dr. William Shockley
spelled out his theory on genetic disadvantages of blacks
last night and blasted students who disrupted a lecture
scheduled a week earlier.
Shockley, 61, whose work on transistors netted him a
Nobel prize in 1956, was interrupted only for questions
from about 50 students, including four blacks, and by mild
outbursts of laughter when a cuckoo clock marked each
half hour.
Shockley told University of California at Davis students
that the earlier disruption at nearby Sacramento State
College "was a symptom of a serious national illness."
"The disruption was an expression of distrust in one of
the most valuable tools invented by humanity — freedom
of speech . .he said.
"My research leads me inescapably to the opinion that
blacks' disadvantages are chiefly hereditary and racially
genetic in origin," he said.
But he said at the unannounced session that the black
students who grabbed the microphone at the start of his
speech a week ago "were courageous, idealistic youths."
The physicist then began a lengthy explanation of how
he says statistics show that whites have a genetic edge
compared to blacks as evidenced in intelligence tests.
He proposed that cash bonuses be offered blacks and
whites for sterilization at a rate of $1,000 for each point
below an IQ of 100, noting such a system would cut costs
in care for mental retards.
Shockley said the threat of genetic "downbreeding"
could lead to "a form of genetic enslavement" for blacks.
Dock Workers Return
NEW YORK — The vanguard of 45,000 East and Gulf
Coast longshoremen returned to piers from Maine to Texas
yesterday, their two-month strike interrupted by
Taft-Hartley back-to-work orders.
However, only a small fraction of the estimated 200
ships idled by the walkout were being handled at the outset
of the strike moratorium. In Boston, a shipping association
spokesman, Robert Calder, estimated it would take two
days to resume full operations.
"Machinery has got to be serviced and paperwork done,"
he explained.
Talks remained at a standstill between the AFL-CIO
International Longshoremen's Association and New York
shipping firms. It was the issue of a continued guaranteed
annual wage for 18,000 New York dockers that triggered
the Oct. 1 walkout.
Only about 1,800 of New York's longshoremen found
assignments awaiting them upon their return to the piers
after 59 days of idleness.
President Nixon invoked the 80-day cooling off
provision of the Taft-Hartley Act last Friday night.
Longshoremen began returning to work Saturday in
Mobile, Ala.
Longshoremen in Philadelphia, Savannah, Ga., and New
Orleans, La., had returned to work midway in the strike,

under local court mandates. But they resumed their
walkouts later, and returned a second time under the
Taft-Hartley edict.
