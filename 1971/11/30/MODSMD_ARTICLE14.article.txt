# Trial Set
## 
### 
San Mateo Superior Court
Judge Frank Rose quickly
recessed the trial of former Black
Students Union Chairman Leo
Bazile and Christopher Laury
yesterday after Bazile's attorney
could not attend due to an illness.
Bazile and Laury are charged
with the beating of a Stanford
Hospital employee last May.
The prosecution alleges that on
May 2, Bazile and Laury broke
into the East Palo Alto home of
Mary Jane Schmidt, a records
clerk at the hospital, and that the
two beat, kicked and slightly
burned her.
The trial will resume
Wednesday morning at 9:30 a.m.
in Redwood City.
