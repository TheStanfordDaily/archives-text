# Pauling's Vitamin C Theories Disputed By Maryland Scientists
## 
### 
Researchers at the University of
Maryland say they have found no
support for Stanford Professor Linus
Pauling's claim that large doses of
Vitamin C can cure and prevent the
common cold.
Pauling, a Nobel Laureate in
Chemistry, published his theory last
winter in a book entitled, "Vitamin C
and the Common Cold," which
touched off a nationwide Vitamin C
fad.
The Maryland study isn't changing
Pauling's mind.
"The study didn't show anything
about the protective effects of Vitamin
C because it didn't give any
information about Vitamin C's effect
on people under ordinary conditions,"
he says.

The Maryland experiment isolated
21 subjects for a month. Eleven of the
group were given three grams of
Vitamin C daily for two weeks and the
other 11 were given sugar pills disguised
as Vitamin C.
All subjects then had doses of a cold
virus, "rhinovirus 44," injected into
their noses while they continued to
take their pills. Within 24 hours,
everyone of the subjects had runny or
stuffy noses, sore throats, and post
nasal drip.
Researchers concluded that everyone
had colds.
According to Dr. Andrew Schwartz,
a head researcher in the experiment,
"Our study showed no preventive or
therapeutic effectiveness of Vitamin C
against the common cold with the

dosage level used... We saw no
evidence of a preventive effect at three
grams per day, which is the level Dr.
Pauling recommended."
But Pauling says the Maryland study
is a "poor one" and doesn't prove
anything about Vitamin C since it
"doesn't test the question of people
catching colds in an ordinary way."
Pauling cites the injecting of the cold
virus into the nasal passages of subjects.
He feels both the method and size of
the dosage could obscure any
therapeutic value Vitamin C might have
under ordinary conditions.
He adds that whereas the Maryland
study uses 21 subjects, the studies he
cites in his book use hundreds of
subjects and are statistically more
dependable.

CONCERNED CHEMIST—NobeI Laureate Linus Pauling, shown here protesting
the opening of the Advisory Board hearing of Bruce Franklin, is concerned with
more than just the chemistry lab. One area of his interest, the common cold and
Vitamin C's effect on it, has come under fire from other scientists.
