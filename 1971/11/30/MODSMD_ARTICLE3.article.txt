# Franklin Case
## Board Decision Expected Dec. 17 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
The Advisory Board's long-awaited
decision in the Franklin case is now
expected about December 17. Board
chairman Donald Kennedy said the end
of finals week is a "reasonable"
estimate for submission of the Board's
recommendation to President Richard
Lyman.
After the report, Lyman has the
option of re-submitting the
recommendation to a review process
before making a final decision of
whether to accept or veto the Board's
findings.
The unprecedented 33-day hearing
of dismissal charges against English
Professor H. Bruce Franklin ended
November 5. Since then, the Advisory
Board has been deliberating three
afternoons a week and holding

additional subcommittee meetings.
But the process has been slowed by a
long delay in completion of a transcript
for the hearing.
After missing several earlier
deadlines, the stenographic firm
preparing the transcript now hopes to
complete it by Friday. Kennedy said
the stenographers still must type
transcripts for eight days of the
hearing, each up to 200 pages long.
Kennedy, chairman of the Biology
Department, said the court reporters
have been "tied up" with a series of
labor union negotiations.
When the completed transcript is
received, Franklin and the
Administration will be given a week to
prepare final written briefs in the case.
Kennedy said his "best guess" is that
the Board will need a week to finish its
work after receiving the briefs.
According to that schedule, the Board's
recommendation would be ready about
Dec. 17, unless there are new delays.
When Lyman receives the
recommendation, he can either accept
it or initiate the review process
specified in the faculty tenure policy.
Under that policy, he can veto the
Advisory Board's decision only after
resubmitting the case to the Board "for
reconsideration with a statement of
questions or objections."
No one has predicted how long such
review processes would take, but
Kennedy said he expects Board
members "will be around" during
Christmas vacation in case Lyman
requests a review.
It is also uncertain when the public
will be informed of the Board's
recommendations. The Board itself will
not release its findings until after
Lyman reviews them.
Administration lawyers have said
they will not release their copy of the
recommendation, and Franklin said he
has not yet decided if he will make it
public as soon as he learns it.
If Franklin is not suspended or
dismissed Winter Quarter, he will be

teaching a four-unit English course,
"Literature and Revolution."
According to the English Department
office, the course would be offered
Monday through Thursday morning at
10:00 a.m.
Students will not be able to

pre-register for the course because it
was deleted from the Winter time
schedule. Associate Dean of Humanities
and Sciences Gordon Wright said he
struck the course from the listings
because it is not known whether
Franklin will be teaching next quarter.
