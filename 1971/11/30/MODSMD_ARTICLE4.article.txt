# Dogs Being Poisoned In College Terrace
## 
### DAN BRENNER 
Two dogs in the College Terrace
area, just south of Escondido Village,
have been poisoned, probably with
strychnine, in the last week. The most
recent incident occurred last Saturday
when a German shepherd returned
from a neighborhood saunter and went
into strychnine convulsions.
The other dog, a Welsh corgi, died
last week from poisoning. Dr. Tom
Spencer of the El Camino Veterinary
Hospital, who performed an autopsy on
the corgi, noted that pieces of steak fat
were found in the dog's stomach. The
dog's owner does not remember feeding
him any fat.
Spencer believes that these incidents
have been deliberate cases of strychnine
poisoning. "We're as positive as can be
without chemical analysis," he notes.
Lieutenant E.L. Besemer of the Palo
Alto Police Department concurs:
"Because of the suddenness [of the
convulsions] it is felt that it was
strychnine."
The poisonings occurred in the
vicinity of Wellesley, California, and
Yale streets after the dogs wandered
the neighborhood without supervision.
Animal poisoning is forbidden by
Section 596 of the California Penal
Code. Poisons on private property may
be administered only after special

notices are posted to comply with the
law.
The German shepherd has been
under heavy anesthetic since he was
brought to the hospital. There is no
known antidote to strychnine; the only
remedy is to prevent convulsions long
enough for the dog's liver to detoxify
the system.
The dog recently had a litter of
puppies and, a neighbor noted, the
pups are in need of a mother to nurture
them if they are to survive.
Besemer reports that his department
is investigating the incidents, although a
special investigator has not yet been
assigned.
Spencer urges owners of victimized
dogs to bring the pet to a veterinarian
immediately. "Time is quite valuable in
these cases," he notes, emphasizing that
an owner cannot provide any relief.
Furthermore he urges that dogs in the
Terrace area be kept on leashes at all
times when outside and that they be
permitted to browse in any area for
only a few seconds.
"It looks like a clear indication that
someone is trying to get the dogs," he
warns.
Chris Young, a resident of the area
and a Stanford library employee added,
"Whoever is doing this is obviously
sick."
