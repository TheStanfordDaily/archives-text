# Young Crows Add Voice To Criticism Of DoD Work
## 
### BRUCE COLLINS 
The roster of organizations which have challenged
Stanford's relationships with the military, was joined by a
now group this fall, the Young Crows.
Although many political organizations in the past few
years have attacked research work funded by the
Department of Defense (DOD), the Young Crows is the
first to focus themselves solely on attacking what they call
the "Stanford Corporation's invaluable contribution to the
U.S. war effort."
The name of the 10 to 20 member group is a parody of
"Association of Old Crows," a national organization
"dedicated to the advancement of the art of electronic
warfare."
The Young Crows' specialty is a knack for what it calls
"joyful and imaginative publicity," as embodied in their
"Red Hot Professor" contest earlier this fall.
Until the tradition died out two years ago, students
honored a favorite professor with the opportunity to lead a
football cheer; recently the Young Crows resurrected the
contest to "honor" the professor whose DOD funded
research was the most useful to the military. This has
evoked a strong response from professors whose work is
involved.
'Stanford Corporation'
The heart of the Young Crows' criticism is the
contention that the "Stanford Corporation" contributes
vitally to the American war effort through "research
contracts intimate and mutually beneficial relationships

with local war-oriented industries, and on-campus
recruiting and training of military-industrial personnel."
They cite figures that Stanford is the sixth largest DOD
funded university. They claim that despite the dropping of
classified research two years ago Stanford research has an
often immediate and real importance to DOD.
The DOD's 29 funding agencies sponsor research ranging
from "basic," performed mostly at universities, to specific
military application, contracted mainly with industries.
The logical conclusion of the Crows' beliefs, says
Electrical Engineering Professor William Spicer, would be
to stop all research.
Spicer, who won a second-place in the Red-Hot Professor
contest for the alleged connection of his work on
amorphous materials to night vision devices, says,"It is
very hard to work in any area in which the military is not
interested."
Amorphous Materials
Spicer adds that he personally is interested in amorphous
materials because it is an exciting and undeveloped field.
He feels fortunate to have found a DOD agency to fund
him.
He admitted improvement of night-vision devices
through his research is possible, though the U.S. has made
no application yet. Spicer said his work would lead
generally to more sensitive optical instruments.
He said, however, he would not oppose future
application of his research for night-vision devices, though
he is opposed to classified research and would drop his

contract if his research became classified.
He criticizes the Young Crows' "illusions" by saying,
"By removing all research supported by the DOD and
stopping any company who does business with the DOD
from recruiting on campus, they [think they] will stop the
war."
"If our country is bad enough so that anything that adds
to the strength of the country is wrong, it would follow
that they would want to see Stanford disappear, if not for
the concentration of DOD research alone," he adds.
Negative Influence
However Joel S. Yudken, a Crow and a former Sylvania
researcher, contends the question is not so easy to resolve
since, he says, DOD exerts a strong negative influence on
research.
"All technology must be viewed within a political, social,
and economic contest, and not on some plateau above the
world."
Although a researcher in a basic area may not be aware
of any military application to his research, Yudken
continued, his funding agency ultimately directs what is
done.
Yudken described the "coupling process" in which,
"researchers are aware which agencies have money and
what they want, and which areas are restricted. . . The
majority of unsolicited contracts are rejected," he adds.
Former student Leonard Siegel, also a Young Crow,
maintains that engineering research and training should be
cut back, "as long as electronics and aeronautics are serving

military needs and as long as the social structure of
America prevents technology from having a substantially
positive impact."
Pete Knutson, another Young Crow, projects a two to
five year time lag between research and applications. He
asserts, "the U.S. is able to perpetuate unjust regimes
through U.S. technology. It constitutes the cutting edge of
American imperialism."
Spicer rejected the statement that research at Stanford
has military applications within three years. A five to ten
year time lag is much more likely, he said. Consequently,
present research at Stanford will have no effect on the
Vietnam war.
"University research is a very vital link in the system of
military development as it is now," said Yudken. "Working
conditions are very favorable, a creative atmosphere
exists . . ." Thus, he said, by attacking the research funded
by DOD agencies at Stanford, the Young Crows would be
able to put a dent into the programs of these agencies.
Yudken said the Young Crows are also trying to prove
that not all research at Stanford is basic. "Some research at
Stanford is definitely militarily applied."
The Young Crows are not committed to a specific plan
that will guarantee positive application of research. Siegel
says that attacking war research will cause the DOD to take
a more positive outlook on research. Knutson advocates
establishment of a review board to review all DOD
contracts at Stanford.
