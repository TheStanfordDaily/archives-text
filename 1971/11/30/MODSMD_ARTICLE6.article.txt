# Mad Turkey Strikes Firko Family
## 
### 
Once bitten by the Mad
Turkey, never free from the fowl
curse, Ferd Firko, notorious
pre-med turkey, woozed to
himself, biting his turkey and
grinning at Granmaw. Gobble,
gobble, gobble, as we turkeys say.
"Waaa-aaa-aaa," Baby Booboo,
Ferd's young nephew, screamed
from his highchair, turning redder
than Uncle John's nose.
"Have some more sour
potatoes," Jolly Uncle John
roared. "How 'bout it, Ferdie, ya
old rascal. Have some undressing,
heh heh."
Ho, ho, hell to them. Ferd was
hit hard just below the left ear by
a silver bullet. No, a black olive,
unpitted. That would be the work
of Cousin Bucky, giggling into his
cranberry sauce, confident that
his prey was too old and dignified
to retaliate.
Ferd, who had sustained direct
hits from three stale rolls and a
brussel sprout at the Battle of the
Broccoli, Oct. 28, 1971, and had
battled on to drown the godless
foe in tapioca pudding, loaded his
spoon with Auntie Gertie's
famous prune and cashew
dressing. Smiling fondly at fondly
smiling Granmaw, Ferd flipped
one large prune, two cashews, and
assorted mystery ingredients into
Cousin Bucky's freckled face.
"Bucky!" Gertie exclaimed.
"How rude!"
Jolly John tittered. "In your
mouth, not your nose, Buck, ya
old devil."
"Really!" Gertie said. "John!"
"Waaa-aaa-aaa," Booboo said.
May the Mad Turkey bite you
on the nose, Ferd sneered silently.
"More turkey, Granmaw?"
"Why thank you, Ferd. Just a
tiny, tiny piece. Such a nice boy."
Ferd's mother beamed at her
big, college boy, he should only
get a haircut. Oh how lovely to
get the family together once
again. How lovely Gertie looks,

I although she has put on a few
I pounds and that lipstick makes
> her complexion so sallow. And
> John is so charming, only perhaps
I he shouldn't drink so much and
, spill food all over lovely
tablecloth.
, And Bucky is such a lovely
I boy, takes after his daddy I
■ suppose, though they do say
about Gertie, of course I never

listen to, what odd table manners
he has. I wonder if? No, of course
not.
"Well, boy. Well, well, boy,"
Uncle John beamed at Ferd.
"Well, well, well."
Well what?
"Well, well, well, well. Heh,
boy?
Ferd ducked a second olive,
which scored a hit on one of
Great Aunt Ella's chins. Banzai,
Ferd thought. The Mad Turkey
strikes again.
"Ella! Bucky! Honestly! At the
dinner table!"
"Well, well, well, Ferd, ya old
hellraiser."
Well!
"How do you like college,
Ferdie? Had any good riots
lately?"
"Oh I like it fine, Uncle John."
Granpaw raised his bald head
to stare at Ferd's curly locks.
"Mmph. Hippie creep."
After two months without a
cut, Ferd's hair had finally
reached his collar.
"Ferd is going to get a haircut
this weekend," his father said.
Great Aunt Ella nodded, her

chins wobbling. "It's a disgrace,
that's what it is, to go walking
around like some kind of a, some
kind of a. . ."
"Queer," Uncle John said.
"He's getting a haircut before
he goes back to school or he's not
going back to school," Father
insisted. "We don't have any
long-haired queers in this family."
How about Cousin Will the

Pusher in Berkely? Ferd thought.
Of course he never comes home
for Thanksgiving. How about
Rhonda, the middle-aged flower
child? She's pretty damn queer if
you ask me, and her brohter
Leslie too. Nobody asked Ferd,
however, nor did he volunteer his
observations on Firko family
queers of varying hair lengths.
"I tell you these kids
nowadays.. ."
"No respect! I tell you! The
other day I saw.. .!"
"Mmph."
Granmaw finished her third
piece of turkey and ended the
conversation. "Well I don't
know," she said, slowly and
sweetly, "I suppose it's none of
our business how long Ferd wants
to grow his own hair." Granpaw
gagged on a bone, but her high
voice minced on. "Actually I
think he looks very nice."
"You always think he looks
nice, however he looks," Father
accused.
"Of course." She smiled at
Ferd, who passed her the turkey.
He vowed to grow her a
moustache for Christmas.

Uncle John guzzled another
glass of wine and returned to
jovial palsmanship. "Well, well,
well. How's those co-ed dorms,
boy? Just between you and me,
Ferdie. Slip her a little el, es and
dee and she'll never know what
hit her."
"Well actually that's not quite
how it works out, Uncle John."
"Don't have to be bashful with
me, boy. I know what happens
when boys and girls get together."
Nothing. Ferd knew this with
the early and unwanted wisdom
of untried youth. He'd learned
something at Stanford. Sadly,
Ferd chewed his cooked carrots,
Ella's special recipe with fried
turnip greens. He hated cooked
carrots. So, apparently, did Baby
Booboo, sister Dotty's bawling
child.
"Waaa-aaa-aaa," Booboo
commented.

Well said, Ferd thought.
How lovely these carrots taste,
Ferd's mother told herself. Need
more salt, of course Ella never
could cook. This is such a lovely
meal, although the turkey is a bit
dry. I'm so glad Hal and Dotty
could make it, they look all
dragged out, probably not eating
right what with Dotty's cooking
and Hal's salary. Booboo is soooo
cute. I wish to hell he'd shut up.
"Oh, poor w ickle
booboouckums am screamums,"
the blushing mother informed
young Booboo. "Gim Mommy a
big smiley wickle booboobaby.
Yeees. Noooo. Shuttie uckums oo
me killoo."
"He's really getting to be a big
boy," Ferd said brightly to his
sister.
"Yes," she replied adding to

W£LCOM£
aS(Wfagfls
the long tradition of sibling
communication in the Firko
family. She smoothed straying
wisps of hair with one carroty
hand, while the other hand played
Pick Up Spoon, a popular game
for mommies everywhere.
"I just told Dotty that the
baby is really getting to be a big
boy," Ferd told the proud father,
Hal.
"Yes, he sure is," Hal
answered, surfacing from his
cooked carrots.
It's nice that Hal and Dotty
have so much in common, Ferd
observed.

Having done his conversational
duty, Hal dived into the carrots
again. This was his first Firko
Thanksgiving and he was going to
eat everybody's special dishes,
keep his mouth shut, and try to
get some leftovers to take home
to lighten the grocery bill. He was
not such a fool as a callow
collegian might think.
Hal watched calmly as a prune
collided with an olive in midair,
both missiles falling on the early
American centerpiece. "Good for
you, Mad Turkey," Hal
whispered, moving on to the
cranberry sauce.
Once bitten by the Mad
Turkey, never free from the fowl

spoon with Auntie Gertie's
famous prune and cashew
dressing. Smiling fondly at fondly
smiling Granmaw, Ferd flipped
one large prune, two cashews, and
assorted mystery ingredients into
Cousin Bucky's freckled face.
"Bucky!" Gertie exclaimed.
"How rude!"
Jolly John tittered. "In your
mouth, not your nose, Buck, ya
old devil."
"Really!" Gertie said. "John!"
"Waaa-aaa-aaa," Booboo said.

American centerpiece. "Good for
you, Mad Turkey," Hal
whispered, moving on to the
cranberry sauce.
Once bitten by the Mad
Turkey, never free from the fowl
curse, Ferd Firko, notorious
pre-med turkey, woozed to
himself, biting his turkey and
grinning at Granmaw. Gobble,
gobble, gobble, as we turkeys say.
"Waaa-aaa-aaa," Baby Booboo,
Ferd's young nephew, screamed
from his highchair, turning redder
than Uncle John's nose.
"Have some more sour
potatoes," Jolly Uncle John
roared. "How 'bout it, Ferdie, ya
old rascal. Have some undressing,
heh heh."
Ho, ho, hell to them. Ferd was
hit hard just below the left ear by
a silver bullet. No, a black olive,
unpitted. That would be the work
of Cousin Bucky, giggling into his
cranberry sauce, confident that
his prey was too old and dignified
to retaliate.
Ferd, who had sustained direct
hits from three stale rolls and a
brussel sprout at the Battle of the
Broccoli, Oct. 28, 1971, and had
battled on to drown the godless
foe in tapioca pudding, loaded his
spoon with Auntie Gertie's
famous prune and cashew
dressing. Smiling fondly at fondly
smiling Granmaw, Ferd flipped
one large prune, two cashews, and
assorted mystery ingredients into
Cousin Bucky's freckled face.
"Bucky!" Gertie exclaimed.
"How rude!"
Jolly John tittered. "In your
mouth, not your nose, Buck, ya
old devil."
"Really!" Gertie said. "John!"
"Waaa-aaa-aaa," Booboo said.
May the Mad Turkey bite you
on the nose, Ferd sneered silently.
"More turkey, Granmaw?"
"Why thank you, Ferd. Just a
tiny, tiny piece. Such a nice boy."
Ferd's mother beamed at her
big, college boy, he should only
get a haircut. Oh how lovely to
get the family together once
again. How lovely Gertie looks,

I although she has put on a few
I pounds and that lipstick makes
> her complexion so sallow. And
> John is so charming, only perhaps
I he shouldn't drink so much and
, spill food all over lovely
tablecloth.
, And Bucky is such a lovely
I boy, takes after his daddy I
■ suppose, though they do say
about Gertie, of course I never

listen to, what odd table manners
he has. I wonder if? No, of course
not.
"Well, boy. Well, well, boy,"
Uncle John beamed at Ferd.
"Well, well, well."
Well what?
"Well, well, well, well. Heh,
boy?
Ferd ducked a second olive,
which scored a hit on one of
Great Aunt Ella's chins. Banzai,
Ferd thought. The Mad Turkey
strikes again.
"Ella! Bucky! Honestly! At the
dinner table!"
"Well, well, well, Ferd, ya old
hellraiser."
Well!
"How do you like college,
Ferdie? Had any good riots
lately?"
"Oh I like it fine, Uncle John."
Granpaw raised his bald head
to stare at Ferd's curly locks.
"Mmph. Hippie creep."
After two months without a
cut, Ferd's hair had finally
reached his collar.
"Ferd is going to get a haircut
this weekend," his father said.
Great Aunt Ella nodded, her

chins wobbling. "It's a disgrace,
that's what it is, to go walking
around like some kind of a, some
kind of a. . ."
"Queer," Uncle John said.
"He's getting a haircut before
he goes back to school or he's not
going back to school," Father
insisted. "We don't have any
long-haired queers in this family."
How about Cousin Will the

Pusher in Berkely? Ferd thought.
Of course he never comes home
for Thanksgiving. How about
Rhonda, the middle-aged flower
child? She's pretty damn queer if
you ask me, and her brohter
Leslie too. Nobody asked Ferd,
however, nor did he volunteer his
observations on Firko family
queers of varying hair lengths.
"I tell you these kids
nowadays.. ."
"No respect! I tell you! The
other day I saw.. .!"
"Mmph."
Granmaw finished her third
piece of turkey and ended the
conversation. "Well I don't
know," she said, slowly and
sweetly, "I suppose it's none of
our business how long Ferd wants
to grow his own hair." Granpaw
gagged on a bone, but her high
voice minced on. "Actually I
think he looks very nice."
"You always think he looks
nice, however he looks," Father
accused.
"Of course." She smiled at
Ferd, who passed her the turkey.
He vowed to grow her a
moustache for Christmas.

Uncle John guzzled another
glass of wine and returned to
jovial palsmanship. "Well, well,
well. How's those co-ed dorms,
boy? Just between you and me,
Ferdie. Slip her a little el, es and
dee and she'll never know what
hit her."
"Well actually that's not quite
how it works out, Uncle John."
"Don't have to be bashful with
me, boy. I know what happens
when boys and girls get together."
Nothing. Ferd knew this with
the early and unwanted wisdom
of untried youth. He'd learned
something at Stanford. Sadly,
Ferd chewed his cooked carrots,
Ella's special recipe with fried
turnip greens. He hated cooked
carrots. So, apparently, did Baby
Booboo, sister Dotty's bawling
child.
"Waaa-aaa-aaa," Booboo
commented.

Well said, Ferd thought.
How lovely these carrots taste,
Ferd's mother told herself. Need
more salt, of course Ella never
could cook. This is such a lovely
meal, although the turkey is a bit
dry. I'm so glad Hal and Dotty
could make it, they look all
dragged out, probably not eating
right what with Dotty's cooking
and Hal's salary. Booboo is soooo
cute. I wish to hell he'd shut up.
"Oh, poor w ickle
booboouckums am screamums,"
the blushing mother informed
young Booboo. "Gim Mommy a
big smiley wickle booboobaby.
Yeees. Noooo. Shuttie uckums oo
me killoo."
"He's really getting to be a big
boy," Ferd said brightly to his
sister.
"Yes," she replied adding to

W£LCOM£
aS(Wfagfls
the long tradition of sibling
communication in the Firko
family. She smoothed straying
wisps of hair with one carroty
hand, while the other hand played
Pick Up Spoon, a popular game
for mommies everywhere.
"I just told Dotty that the
baby is really getting to be a big
boy," Ferd told the proud father,
Hal.
"Yes, he sure is," Hal
answered, surfacing from his
cooked carrots.
It's nice that Hal and Dotty
have so much in common, Ferd
observed.

Having done his conversational
duty, Hal dived into the carrots
again. This was his first Firko
Thanksgiving and he was going to
eat everybody's special dishes,
keep his mouth shut, and try to
get some leftovers to take home
to lighten the grocery bill. He was
not such a fool as a callow
collegian might think.
Hal watched calmly as a prune
collided with an olive in midair,
both missiles falling on the early
American centerpiece. "Good for

whispered, moving on to the

one large prune, two cashews, and
assorted mystery ingredients into
Cousin Bucky's freckled face.
"Bucky!" Gertie exclaimed.
"How rude!"
Jolly John tittered. "In your

Hal watched calmly as a prune
collided with an olive in midair,
both missiles falling on the early
American centerpiece. "Good for
you, Mad Turkey," Hal
whispered, moving on to the
cranberry sauce.
Once bitten by the Mad
Turkey, never free from the fowl
curse, Ferd Firko, notorious
pre-med turkey, woozed to
himself, biting his turkey and
grinning at Granmaw. Gobble,
gobble, gobble, as we turkeys say.
"Waaa-aaa-aaa," Baby Booboo,
Ferd's young nephew, screamed
from his highchair, turning redder
than Uncle John's nose.
"Have some more sour
potatoes," Jolly Uncle John
roared. "How 'bout it, Ferdie, ya
old rascal. Have some undressing,
heh heh."
Ho, ho, hell to them. Ferd was
hit hard just below the left ear by
a silver bullet. No, a black olive,
unpitted. That would be the work
of Cousin Bucky, giggling into his
cranberry sauce, confident that
his prey was too old and dignified
to retaliate.
Ferd, who had sustained direct
hits from three stale rolls and a
brussel sprout at the Battle of the
Broccoli, Oct. 28, 1971, and had
battled on to drown the godless
foe in tapioca pudding, loaded his
spoon with Auntie Gertie's
famous prune and cashew
dressing. Smiling fondly at fondly
smiling Granmaw, Ferd flipped
one large prune, two cashews, and
assorted mystery ingredients into
Cousin Bucky's freckled face.
"Bucky!" Gertie exclaimed.
"How rude!"
Jolly John tittered. "In your
mouth, not your nose, Buck, ya
old devil."
"Really!" Gertie said. "John!"
"Waaa-aaa-aaa," Booboo said.
May the Mad Turkey bite you
on the nose, Ferd sneered silently.
"More turkey, Granmaw?"
"Why thank you, Ferd. Just a
tiny, tiny piece. Such a nice boy."
Ferd's mother beamed at her
big, college boy, he should only
get a haircut. Oh how lovely to
get the family together once
again. How lovely Gertie looks,

I although she has put on a few
I pounds and that lipstick makes
> her complexion so sallow. And
> John is so charming, only perhaps
I he shouldn't drink so much and
, spill food all over lovely
tablecloth.
, And Bucky is such a lovely
I boy, takes after his daddy I
■ suppose, though they do say
about Gertie, of course I never

listen to, what odd table manners
he has. I wonder if? No, of course
not.
"Well, boy. Well, well, boy,"
Uncle John beamed at Ferd.
"Well, well, well."
Well what?
"Well, well, well, well. Heh,
boy?
Ferd ducked a second olive,
which scored a hit on one of
Great Aunt Ella's chins. Banzai,
Ferd thought. The Mad Turkey
strikes again.
"Ella! Bucky! Honestly! At the
dinner table!"
"Well, well, well, Ferd, ya old
hellraiser."
Well!
"How do you like college,
Ferdie? Had any good riots
lately?"
"Oh I like it fine, Uncle John."
Granpaw raised his bald head
to stare at Ferd's curly locks.
"Mmph. Hippie creep."
After two months without a
cut, Ferd's hair had finally
reached his collar.
"Ferd is going to get a haircut
this weekend," his father said.
Great Aunt Ella nodded, her

chins wobbling. "It's a disgrace,
that's what it is, to go walking
around like some kind of a, some
kind of a. . ."
"Queer," Uncle John said.
"He's getting a haircut before
he goes back to school or he's not
going back to school," Father
insisted. "We don't have any
long-haired queers in this family."
How about Cousin Will the

Pusher in Berkely? Ferd thought.
Of course he never comes home
for Thanksgiving. How about
Rhonda, the middle-aged flower
child? She's pretty damn queer if
you ask me, and her brohter
Leslie too. Nobody asked Ferd,
however, nor did he volunteer his
observations on Firko family
queers of varying hair lengths.
"I tell you these kids
nowadays.. ."
"No respect! I tell you! The
other day I saw.. .!"
"Mmph."
Granmaw finished her third
piece of turkey and ended the
conversation. "Well I don't
know," she said, slowly and
sweetly, "I suppose it's none of
our business how long Ferd wants
to grow his own hair." Granpaw
gagged on a bone, but her high
voice minced on. "Actually I
think he looks very nice."
"You always think he looks
nice, however he looks," Father
accused.
"Of course." She smiled at
Ferd, who passed her the turkey.
He vowed to grow her a
moustache for Christmas.

Uncle John guzzled another
glass of wine and returned to
jovial palsmanship. "Well, well,
well. How's those co-ed dorms,
boy? Just between you and me,
Ferdie. Slip her a little el, es and
dee and she'll never know what
hit her."
"Well actually that's not quite
how it works out, Uncle John."
"Don't have to be bashful with
me, boy. I know what happens
when boys and girls get together."
Nothing. Ferd knew this with
the early and unwanted wisdom
of untried youth. He'd learned
something at Stanford. Sadly,
Ferd chewed his cooked carrots,
Ella's special recipe with fried
turnip greens. He hated cooked
carrots. So, apparently, did Baby
Booboo, sister Dotty's bawling
child.
"Waaa-aaa-aaa," Booboo
commented.

Well said, Ferd thought.
How lovely these carrots taste,
Ferd's mother told herself. Need
more salt, of course Ella never
could cook. This is such a lovely
meal, although the turkey is a bit
dry. I'm so glad Hal and Dotty
could make it, they look all
dragged out, probably not eating
right what with Dotty's cooking
and Hal's salary. Booboo is soooo
cute. I wish to hell he'd shut up.
"Oh, poor w ickle
booboouckums am screamums,"
the blushing mother informed
young Booboo. "Gim Mommy a
big smiley wickle booboobaby.
Yeees. Noooo. Shuttie uckums oo
me killoo."
"He's really getting to be a big
boy," Ferd said brightly to his
sister.
"Yes," she replied adding to

W£LCOM£
aS(Wfagfls
the long tradition of sibling
communication in the Firko
family. She smoothed straying
wisps of hair with one carroty
hand, while the other hand played
Pick Up Spoon, a popular game
for mommies everywhere.
"I just told Dotty that the
baby is really getting to be a big
boy," Ferd told the proud father,
Hal.
"Yes, he sure is," Hal
answered, surfacing from his
cooked carrots.
It's nice that Hal and Dotty
have so much in common, Ferd
observed.

Having done his conversational
duty, Hal dived into the carrots
again. This was his first Firko
Thanksgiving and he was going to
eat everybody's special dishes,
keep his mouth shut, and try to
get some leftovers to take home
to lighten the grocery bill. He was
not such a fool as a callow
collegian might think.

to lighten the grocery bill. He was
not such a fool as a callow
collegian might think.
Hal watched calmly as a prune
collided with an olive in midair,
both missiles falling on the early
American centerpiece. "Good for
you, Mad Turkey," Hal
whispered, moving on to the
cranberry sauce.
Once bitten by the Mad
Turkey, never free from the fowl
curse, Ferd Firko, notorious
pre-med turkey, woozed to
himself, biting his turkey and
grinning at Granmaw. Gobble,
gobble, gobble, as we turkeys say.
"Waaa-aaa-aaa," Baby Booboo,
Ferd's young nephew, screamed
from his highchair, turning redder
than Uncle John's nose.
"Have some more sour
potatoes," Jolly Uncle John
roared. "How 'bout it, Ferdie, ya
old rascal. Have some undressing,
heh heh."
Ho, ho, hell to them. Ferd was
hit hard just below the left ear by
a silver bullet. No, a black olive,
unpitted. That would be the work
of Cousin Bucky, giggling into his
cranberry sauce, confident that
his prey was too old and dignified
to retaliate.
Ferd, who had sustained direct
hits from three stale rolls and a
brussel sprout at the Battle of the
Broccoli, Oct. 28, 1971, and had
battled on to drown the godless
foe in tapioca pudding, loaded his
spoon with Auntie Gertie's
famous prune and cashew
dressing. Smiling fondly at fondly
smiling Granmaw, Ferd flipped
one large prune, two cashews, and
assorted mystery ingredients into
Cousin Bucky's freckled face.
"Bucky!" Gertie exclaimed.
"How rude!"
Jolly John tittered. "In your
mouth, not your nose, Buck, ya
old devil."
"Really!" Gertie said. "John!"
"Waaa-aaa-aaa," Booboo said.
May the Mad Turkey bite you
on the nose, Ferd sneered silently.
"More turkey, Granmaw?"
"Why thank you, Ferd. Just a
tiny, tiny piece. Such a nice boy."
Ferd's mother beamed at her
big, college boy, he should only
get a haircut. Oh how lovely to
get the family together once
again. How lovely Gertie looks,

I although she has put on a few
I pounds and that lipstick makes
> her complexion so sallow. And
> John is so charming, only perhaps
I he shouldn't drink so much and
, spill food all over lovely
tablecloth.
, And Bucky is such a lovely
I boy, takes after his daddy I
■ suppose, though they do say
about Gertie, of course I never

listen to, what odd table manners
he has. I wonder if? No, of course
not.
"Well, boy. Well, well, boy,"
Uncle John beamed at Ferd.
"Well, well, well."
Well what?
"Well, well, well, well. Heh,
boy?
Ferd ducked a second olive,
which scored a hit on one of
Great Aunt Ella's chins. Banzai,
Ferd thought. The Mad Turkey
strikes again.
"Ella! Bucky! Honestly! At the
dinner table!"
"Well, well, well, Ferd, ya old
hellraiser."
Well!
"How do you like college,
Ferdie? Had any good riots
lately?"
"Oh I like it fine, Uncle John."
Granpaw raised his bald head
to stare at Ferd's curly locks.
"Mmph. Hippie creep."
After two months without a
cut, Ferd's hair had finally
reached his collar.
"Ferd is going to get a haircut
this weekend," his father said.
Great Aunt Ella nodded, her

chins wobbling. "It's a disgrace,
that's what it is, to go walking
around like some kind of a, some
kind of a. . ."
"Queer," Uncle John said.
"He's getting a haircut before
he goes back to school or he's not
going back to school," Father
insisted. "We don't have any
long-haired queers in this family."
How about Cousin Will the

Pusher in Berkely? Ferd thought.
Of course he never comes home
for Thanksgiving. How about
Rhonda, the middle-aged flower
child? She's pretty damn queer if
you ask me, and her brohter
Leslie too. Nobody asked Ferd,
however, nor did he volunteer his
observations on Firko family
queers of varying hair lengths.
"I tell you these kids
nowadays.. ."
"No respect! I tell you! The
other day I saw.. .!"
"Mmph."
Granmaw finished her third
piece of turkey and ended the
conversation. "Well I don't
know," she said, slowly and
sweetly, "I suppose it's none of
our business how long Ferd wants
to grow his own hair." Granpaw
gagged on a bone, but her high
voice minced on. "Actually I
think he looks very nice."
"You always think he looks
nice, however he looks," Father
accused.
"Of course." She smiled at
Ferd, who passed her the turkey.
He vowed to grow her a
moustache for Christmas.

Uncle John guzzled another
glass of wine and returned to
jovial palsmanship. "Well, well,
well. How's those co-ed dorms,
boy? Just between you and me,
Ferdie. Slip her a little el, es and
dee and she'll never know what
hit her."
"Well actually that's not quite
how it works out, Uncle John."
"Don't have to be bashful with
me, boy. I know what happens
when boys and girls get together."
Nothing. Ferd knew this with
the early and unwanted wisdom
of untried youth. He'd learned
something at Stanford. Sadly,
Ferd chewed his cooked carrots,
Ella's special recipe with fried
turnip greens. He hated cooked
carrots. So, apparently, did Baby
Booboo, sister Dotty's bawling
child.
"Waaa-aaa-aaa," Booboo
commented.

Well said, Ferd thought.
How lovely these carrots taste,
Ferd's mother told herself. Need
more salt, of course Ella never
could cook. This is such a lovely
meal, although the turkey is a bit
dry. I'm so glad Hal and Dotty
could make it, they look all
dragged out, probably not eating
right what with Dotty's cooking
and Hal's salary. Booboo is soooo
cute. I wish to hell he'd shut up.
"Oh, poor w ickle
booboouckums am screamums,"
the blushing mother informed
young Booboo. "Gim Mommy a
big smiley wickle booboobaby.
Yeees. Noooo. Shuttie uckums oo
me killoo."
"He's really getting to be a big
boy," Ferd said brightly to his
sister.
"Yes," she replied adding to

W£LCOM£
aS(Wfagfls
the long tradition of sibling
communication in the Firko
family. She smoothed straying
wisps of hair with one carroty
hand, while the other hand played
Pick Up Spoon, a popular game
for mommies everywhere.
"I just told Dotty that the
baby is really getting to be a big
boy," Ferd told the proud father,
Hal.
"Yes, he sure is," Hal
answered, surfacing from his
cooked carrots.
It's nice that Hal and Dotty
have so much in common, Ferd
observed.

Having done his conversational
duty, Hal dived into the carrots
again. This was his first Firko
Thanksgiving and he was going to
eat everybody's special dishes,
keep his mouth shut, and try to
get some leftovers to take home
to lighten the grocery bill. He was
not such a fool as a callow
collegian might think.

famous prune and cashew
dressing. Smiling fondly at fondly

one large prune, two cashews, and
assorted mystery ingredients into
Cousin Bucky's freckled face.
"Bucky!" Gertie exclaimed.
"How rude!"
Jolly John tittered. "In your

old devil."
"Really!" Gertie said. "John!"
"Waaa-aaa-aaa," Booboo said.
