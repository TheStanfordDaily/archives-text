## Police In Libertarian Society

Second of two parts
One conclusion of yesterday's
article was that, under the present
system, policemen have no
built-in incentives to provide good
service since their income does
not come directly from their
customers and since the
government police system as a
unit is a coercive monopoly which
means that competitors are illegal
and consequently no business
threat.
These are reasons, not only for
poor police service, but also for
poor government service
generally, e.g., the Post Office,
and poor service in areas which
are nominally privately owned,
but to a large extent
government-controlled, e.g.,
certain railroads.
Today's article will discuss
what I believe is the best police
system possible: the replacement
of a government police system
with a system in which protection
services are bought and sold from
private police agencies.
Other vital services, such as
food and medical care, already are
provided without the government,

and I would argue, although it is
beyond the scope of this article,
that such imperfections as exist in
these markets are govern mentally
imposed. Note that just as the
market's food and medical
services obviate the need for a
given citizen to study agriculture
or medicine in order to eat or to
safeguard his health, so too uner a
private police system, each citizen
need not study criminology or
arm himself, but could delegate
his reuired protection to a private
defense agency.
Below we'll consider one
possible defense agency system,
although it must be stated that it
is impossible for us to envision the
technological advances and
efficient service that would arise
when each defense agency tries its
best to protect you better than its
competitors do. The ideas herein
are discussed in much more detail
in The Market for Liberty by
Morris and Linda Tanehill and
Society Without Coercion by
Jarret Wollstein.
Two possible methods of
financing private defense agencies
are (1) service contracts, which

would be essentially insurance
contracts between an individual
and a protection agency, and (2)
specific fees paid for specific
services. These agencies might also
gain revenue through special
contracts with other firms.
For example, if roads were
privately owned, say if the
Junipero Serra Freeway and the
Bayshore Freeway were owned by
two separate firms and each
competed to provide you with the
most pleasant journey to San
Francisco, then, among other
things, these firms would hire
policemen to guard against
reckless driving.
So far as operations are
concerned, if crimes were
reported or discovered after the
fact, then, assuming that the
victim had an insurance contract
or was willing to pay a specific
investigatory fee, the police
agency would try to rectify the
injustice. The situation is a bit
more complicated with crimes
discovered by police during their
occurrence.
If a policeman discovers that
you are being mugged, he clearly
has no time to check with his
agency to see if you are insured.
Nevertheless, it is in his and his
company's interest that he help
you. First, you might be a
customer of his agency. Second,
even if you are not, there is a
good chance that after being
rescued, you would either become
insured by his agency or at least
pay for this particular services,
although you would not be
obliged to unless you hollered
"Help, police!" in which case you
would be making a verbal contract
similar to that of a man in a
restaurant who, upon ordering a
meal, has made a verbal contract
to pay the check.
Policemen could be rewarded
on the number of new customers
they obtained for their company
and hence would have an
incentive to perform such rescues.
Finally, these rescues create good
will for the agency and,
consequently, a greater likelihood
of business.
Since a private defense
company's only function is to
protect its customers from
coercion, it must perform this
function with excellence or else
go out of business. Government
officials, as we've seen before,
have no such incentives. For
example, under the present
system, if, say, a racist policeman
should happen to brutalize an
innocent black, aroused citizens
can do little more than write
letters to the local newspaper.
Moreover, no matter how much
one disapproves of the
government's police service, one's
money is still confiscated, i.e.,
"taxed," to support the same
poor police service.
In the private market system,
black citizenscould withdraw their
sanction from a racist police
force and patronize a non-racist
one. On the same point, if an
individual did not want to be
protected from, say, the
imaginary- horrors of smoking
grass, he would not pay for this
"protection." Under the present
system, he gets this "protection"
whether he wants it or not.
A common objection to the
system proposed here is that a â€¢
state of gang warfare would arise
between the various defense
agencies. Let us briefly consider,
in the context of a completely
laissez-faire society, what some
consequences of criminal action
by the ABC defense agency would
be.
First, businesses would hesitate
to associate with ABC, for fear of
ABC's aggression in case of
disagreement, and for fear of
being an accidental casualty of the
retaliation of one of ABC's
victims. Businesses who did

associate with ABC, ipso facto,
would be identifying themselves
with these criminals and, like ABC
itself, would tend to scare off
both customers and other
businesses.
Insurance companies, which
would play a very important role
in a completely free society, have
an added obvious interest in
minimizing destruction. Many
insurance companies would
consider ABC and their associates
to be too much of a risk to insure;
those which insured ABC and
associates would have to charge
higher premiums to cover ABC's
violence and destruction, and
could be run out of business by
other insurance companies with
lower premiums.
In the long run, assuming they
were still in business, ABC and
associates would be left without
the important services of
insurance companies.
Furthermore, the employees of
ABC are liable for the violence
they create; unlike coercive
government agents, there is no
system to grant them immunity
from their victims' retaliatory
force. Therefore, the only
employees of ABC would be
idiots who did not realize this fact
or thugs who enjoy violence.
Since no honest men would
voluntarily deal with ABC, the
only way ABC could gain money
would be through open
aggression. Moreover, in order to
become a great threat to society,
ABC would have to be large and
well-organized. We noted
yesterday that organized crime in
America derives its power
primarily from black markets. But
in a completely laissez-faire
society there are no trade
restrictions and consequently no
black markets.
Some still argue that ABC
would first act as an excellent,
well-run, respectable defense
agency until it acquired a large
market share at which time it
would completely switch roles
and become an aggressive
criminal. It should be noted first
that any such agency with a large
market share would be very
financially successful and thus
would have attained the goal
(wealth) of most criminal activity.
But even if this situation held,
ABC could not command the
power a government does, since
(1) its customers are free to
switch to other agencies, once
ABC's criminal intentions are
suspected; (2) ABC could not, as a
government can, grant its
employees immunity from
retaliation when the employees
themselves initiate violence; (3)
ABC could not rob money as
easily as the government taxes;
and (4) ABC could not acquire
soldiers as easily as a government
drafts them. It seems much more
likely indeed that a government
can come to power and wage war
and shed blood than that a
criminal private defense agency
will survive on the free market, let
alone obtain considerable power.
To summarize, the basic point
of this two-part article is that the
government has no right to
control an individual's life at its
own will, and that with regard to
police protection as well as all
other goods and services,
individuals should be free to make
their own choices and run their
own lives.

well-run, respectable defense
agency until it acquired a large
market share at which time it
would completely switch roles
and become an aggressive
criminal. It should be noted first
that any such agency with a large
market share would be very
financially successful and thus
would have attained the goal
(wealth) of most criminal activity.
But even if this situation held,
ABC could not command the
power a government does, since
(1) its customers are free to
switch to other agencies, once
ABC's criminal intentions are
suspected; (2) ABC could not, as a
government can, grant its
employees immunity from
retaliation when the employees
themselves initiate violence; (3)
ABC could not rob money as
easily as the government taxes;
and (4) ABC could not acquire
soldiers as easily as a government
drafts them. It seems much more
likely indeed that a government
can come to power and wage war
and shed blood than that a
criminal private defense agency
will survive on the free market, let
alone obtain considerable power.
To summarize, the basic point
of this two-part article is that the
government has no right to
control an individual's life at its
own will, and that with regard to
police protection as well as all
other goods and services,
individuals should be free to make
their own choices and run their
own lives.

Second of two parts
One conclusion of yesterday's
article was that, under the present
system, policemen have no
built-in incentives to provide good
service since their income does
not come directly from their
customers and since the
government police system as a
unit is a coercive monopoly which
means that competitors are illegal
and consequently no business
threat.
These are reasons, not only for
poor police service, but also for
poor government service
generally, e.g., the Post Office,
and poor service in areas which
are nominally privately owned,
but to a large extent
government-controlled, e.g.,
certain railroads.
Today's article will discuss
what I believe is the best police
system possible: the replacement
of a government police system
with a system in which protection
services are bought and sold from
private police agencies.
Other vital services, such as
food and medical care, already are
provided without the government,

and I would argue, although it is
beyond the scope of this article,
that such imperfections as exist in
these markets are govern mentally
imposed. Note that just as the
market's food and medical
services obviate the need for a
given citizen to study agriculture
or medicine in order to eat or to
safeguard his health, so too uner a
private police system, each citizen
need not study criminology or
arm himself, but could delegate
his reuired protection to a private
defense agency.
Below we'll consider one
possible defense agency system,
although it must be stated that it
is impossible for us to envision the
technological advances and
efficient service that would arise
when each defense agency tries its
best to protect you better than its
competitors do. The ideas herein
are discussed in much more detail
in The Market for Liberty by
Morris and Linda Tanehill and
Society Without Coercion by
Jarret Wollstein.
Two possible methods of
financing private defense agencies
are (1) service contracts, which

would be essentially insurance
contracts between an individual
and a protection agency, and (2)
specific fees paid for specific
services. These agencies might also
gain revenue through special
contracts with other firms.
For example, if roads were
privately owned, say if the
Junipero Serra Freeway and the
Bayshore Freeway were owned by
two separate firms and each
competed to provide you with the
most pleasant journey to San
Francisco, then, among other
things, these firms would hire
policemen to guard against
reckless driving.
So far as operations are
concerned, if crimes were
reported or discovered after the
fact, then, assuming that the
victim had an insurance contract
or was willing to pay a specific
investigatory fee, the police
agency would try to rectify the
injustice. The situation is a bit
more complicated with crimes
discovered by police during their
occurrence.
If a policeman discovers that
you are being mugged, he clearly
has no time to check with his
agency to see if you are insured.
Nevertheless, it is in his and his
company's interest that he help
you. First, you might be a
customer of his agency. Second,
even if you are not, there is a
good chance that after being
rescued, you would either become
insured by his agency or at least
pay for this particular services,
although you would not be
obliged to unless you hollered
"Help, police!" in which case you
would be making a verbal contract
similar to that of a man in a
restaurant who, upon ordering a
meal, has made a verbal contract
to pay the check.
Policemen could be rewarded
on the number of new customers
they obtained for their company
and hence would have an
incentive to perform such rescues.
Finally, these rescues create good
will for the agency and,
consequently, a greater likelihood
of business.
Since a private defense
company's only function is to
protect its customers from
coercion, it must perform this
function with excellence or else
go out of business. Government
officials, as we've seen before,
have no such incentives. For
example, under the present
system, if, say, a racist policeman
should happen to brutalize an
innocent black, aroused citizens
can do little more than write
letters to the local newspaper.
Moreover, no matter how much
one disapproves of the
government's police service, one's
money is still confiscated, i.e.,
"taxed," to support the same
poor police service.
In the private market system,
black citizenscould withdraw their
sanction from a racist police
force and patronize a non-racist
one. On the same point, if an
individual did not want to be
protected from, say, the
imaginary- horrors of smoking
grass, he would not pay for this
"protection." Under the present
system, he gets this "protection"
whether he wants it or not.
A common objection to the
system proposed here is that a â€¢
state of gang warfare would arise
between the various defense
agencies. Let us briefly consider,
in the context of a completely
laissez-faire society, what some
consequences of criminal action
by the ABC defense agency would
be.
First, businesses would hesitate
to associate with ABC, for fear of
ABC's aggression in case of
disagreement, and for fear of
being an accidental casualty of the
retaliation of one of ABC's
victims. Businesses who did

associate with ABC, ipso facto,
would be identifying themselves
with these criminals and, like ABC
itself, would tend to scare off
both customers and other
businesses.
Insurance companies, which
would play a very important role
in a completely free society, have
an added obvious interest in
minimizing destruction. Many
insurance companies would
consider ABC and their associates
to be too much of a risk to insure;
those which insured ABC and
associates would have to charge
higher premiums to cover ABC's
violence and destruction, and
could be run out of business by
other insurance companies with
lower premiums.
In the long run, assuming they
were still in business, ABC and
associates would be left without
the important services of
insurance companies.
Furthermore, the employees of
ABC are liable for the violence
they create; unlike coercive
government agents, there is no
system to grant them immunity
from their victims' retaliatory
force. Therefore, the only
employees of ABC would be
idiots who did not realize this fact
or thugs who enjoy violence.
Since no honest men would
voluntarily deal with ABC, the
only way ABC could gain money
would be through open
aggression. Moreover, in order to
become a great threat to society,
ABC would have to be large and
well-organized. We noted
yesterday that organized crime in
America derives its power
primarily from black markets. But
in a completely laissez-faire
society there are no trade
restrictions and consequently no
black markets.
Some still argue that ABC
would first act as an excellent,
well-run, respectable defense
agency until it acquired a large
market share at which time it
would completely switch roles
and become an aggressive
criminal. It should be noted first
that any such agency with a large
market share would be very
financially successful and thus
would have attained the goal
(wealth) of most criminal activity.
But even if this situation held,
ABC could not command the
power a government does, since

businesses.
Insurance companies, which
would play a very important role
in a completely free society, have
an added obvious interest in
minimizing destruction. Many
insurance companies would
consider ABC and their associates
to be too much of a risk to insure;
those which insured ABC and
associates would have to charge
higher premiums to cover ABC's
violence and destruction, and
could be run out of business by
other insurance companies with
lower premiums.
In the long run, assuming they
were still in business, ABC and
associates would be left without
the important services of
insurance companies.
Furthermore, the employees of
ABC are liable for the violence
they create; unlike coercive
government agents, there is no
system to grant them immunity
from their victims' retaliatory
force. Therefore, the only
employees of ABC would be
idiots who did not realize this fact
or thugs who enjoy violence.
Since no honest men would
voluntarily deal with ABC, the
only way ABC could gain money
would be through open
aggression. Moreover, in order to
become a great threat to society,
ABC would have to be large and
well-organized. We noted
yesterday that organized crime in
America derives its power
primarily from black markets. But
in a completely laissez-faire
society there are no trade
restrictions and consequently no
black markets.
Some still argue that ABC
would first act as an excellent,
well-run, respectable defense
agency until it acquired a large
market share at which time it
would completely switch roles
and become an aggressive
criminal. It should be noted first
that any such agency with a large
market share would be very
financially successful and thus
would have attained the goal
(wealth) of most criminal activity.
But even if this situation held,
ABC could not command the
power a government does, since
(1) its customers are free to
switch to other agencies, once
ABC's criminal intentions are
suspected; (2) ABC could not, as a
government can, grant its
employees immunity from
retaliation when the employees
themselves initiate violence; (3)
ABC could not rob money as
easily as the government taxes;
and (4) ABC could not acquire
soldiers as easily as a government
drafts them. It seems much more
likely indeed that a government
can come to power and wage war
and shed blood than that a
criminal private defense agency
will survive on the free market, let
alone obtain considerable power.
To summarize, the basic point
of this two-part article is that the
government has no right to
control an individual's life at its
own will, and that with regard to
police protection as well as all
other goods and services,
individuals should be free to make
their own choices and run their
own lives.

Second of two parts
One conclusion of yesterday's
article was that, under the present
system, policemen have no
built-in incentives to provide good
service since their income does
not come directly from their
customers and since the
government police system as a
unit is a coercive monopoly which
means that competitors are illegal
and consequently no business
threat.
These are reasons, not only for
poor police service, but also for
poor government service
generally, e.g., the Post Office,
and poor service in areas which
are nominally privately owned,
but to a large extent
government-controlled, e.g.,
certain railroads.
Today's article will discuss
what I believe is the best police
system possible: the replacement
of a government police system
with a system in which protection
services are bought and sold from
private police agencies.
Other vital services, such as
food and medical care, already are
provided without the government,

and I would argue, although it is
beyond the scope of this article,
that such imperfections as exist in
these markets are govern mentally
imposed. Note that just as the
market's food and medical
services obviate the need for a
given citizen to study agriculture
or medicine in order to eat or to
safeguard his health, so too uner a
private police system, each citizen
need not study criminology or
arm himself, but could delegate
his reuired protection to a private
defense agency.
Below we'll consider one
possible defense agency system,
although it must be stated that it
is impossible for us to envision the
technological advances and
efficient service that would arise
when each defense agency tries its
best to protect you better than its
competitors do. The ideas herein
are discussed in much more detail
in The Market for Liberty by
Morris and Linda Tanehill and
Society Without Coercion by
Jarret Wollstein.
Two possible methods of
financing private defense agencies
are (1) service contracts, which

would be essentially insurance
contracts between an individual
and a protection agency, and (2)
specific fees paid for specific
services. These agencies might also
gain revenue through special
contracts with other firms.
For example, if roads were
privately owned, say if the
Junipero Serra Freeway and the
Bayshore Freeway were owned by
two separate firms and each
competed to provide you with the
most pleasant journey to San
Francisco, then, among other
things, these firms would hire
policemen to guard against
reckless driving.
So far as operations are
concerned, if crimes were
reported or discovered after the
fact, then, assuming that the
victim had an insurance contract
or was willing to pay a specific
investigatory fee, the police
agency would try to rectify the
injustice. The situation is a bit
more complicated with crimes
discovered by police during their
occurrence.
If a policeman discovers that
you are being mugged, he clearly
has no time to check with his
agency to see if you are insured.
Nevertheless, it is in his and his
company's interest that he help
you. First, you might be a
customer of his agency. Second,
even if you are not, there is a
good chance that after being
rescued, you would either become
insured by his agency or at least
pay for this particular services,
although you would not be
obliged to unless you hollered
"Help, police!" in which case you
would be making a verbal contract
similar to that of a man in a
restaurant who, upon ordering a
meal, has made a verbal contract
to pay the check.
Policemen could be rewarded
on the number of new customers
they obtained for their company
and hence would have an
incentive to perform such rescues.
Finally, these rescues create good
will for the agency and,
consequently, a greater likelihood
of business.
Since a private defense
company's only function is to
protect its customers from
coercion, it must perform this
function with excellence or else
go out of business. Government
officials, as we've seen before,
have no such incentives. For
example, under the present
system, if, say, a racist policeman
should happen to brutalize an
innocent black, aroused citizens
can do little more than write
letters to the local newspaper.
Moreover, no matter how much
one disapproves of the
government's police service, one's
money is still confiscated, i.e.,
"taxed," to support the same
poor police service.
In the private market system,
black citizenscould withdraw their
sanction from a racist police
force and patronize a non-racist
one. On the same point, if an
individual did not want to be
protected from, say, the
imaginary- horrors of smoking
grass, he would not pay for this
"protection." Under the present
system, he gets this "protection"
whether he wants it or not.
A common objection to the
system proposed here is that a â€¢
state of gang warfare would arise
between the various defense
agencies. Let us briefly consider,
in the context of a completely
laissez-faire society, what some
consequences of criminal action
by the ABC defense agency would
be.
First, businesses would hesitate
to associate with ABC, for fear of
ABC's aggression in case of
disagreement, and for fear of
being an accidental casualty of the
retaliation of one of ABC's
victims. Businesses who did

associate with ABC, ipso facto,
would be identifying themselves
with these criminals and, like ABC
itself, would tend to scare off
both customers and other
businesses.
Insurance companies, which
would play a very important role
in a completely free society, have
an added obvious interest in
minimizing destruction. Many
insurance companies would

to be too much of a risk to insure;
those which insured ABC and

should happen to brutalize an
innocent black, aroused citizens
can do little more than write
letters to the local newspaper.
Moreover, no matter how much
one disapproves of the
government's police service, one's
money is still confiscated, i.e.,
"taxed," to support the same
poor police service.
In the private market system,
black citizenscould withdraw their
sanction from a racist police
force and patronize a non-racist
one. On the same point, if an
individual did not want to be
protected from, say, the
imaginary- horrors of smoking
grass, he would not pay for this
"protection." Under the present
system, he gets this "protection"
whether he wants it or not.
A common objection to the
system proposed here is that a â€¢
state of gang warfare would arise
between the various defense
agencies. Let us briefly consider,
in the context of a completely
laissez-faire society, what some
consequences of criminal action
by the ABC defense agency would
be.
First, businesses would hesitate
to associate with ABC, for fear of
ABC's aggression in case of
disagreement, and for fear of
being an accidental casualty of the
retaliation of one of ABC's
victims. Businesses who did

associate with ABC, ipso facto,
would be identifying themselves
with these criminals and, like ABC
itself, would tend to scare off
both customers and other
businesses.
Insurance companies, which
would play a very important role
in a completely free society, have
an added obvious interest in
minimizing destruction. Many
insurance companies would
consider ABC and their associates
to be too much of a risk to insure;
those which insured ABC and
associates would have to charge
higher premiums to cover ABC's
violence and destruction, and
could be run out of business by
other insurance companies with
lower premiums.
In the long run, assuming they
were still in business, ABC and
associates would be left without
the important services of
insurance companies.
Furthermore, the employees of
ABC are liable for the violence
they create; unlike coercive
government agents, there is no
system to grant them immunity
from their victims' retaliatory
force. Therefore, the only
employees of ABC would be
idiots who did not realize this fact
or thugs who enjoy violence.
Since no honest men would
voluntarily deal with ABC, the
only way ABC could gain money
would be through open
aggression. Moreover, in order to
become a great threat to society,
ABC would have to be large and
well-organized. We noted
yesterday that organized crime in
America derives its power
primarily from black markets. But
in a completely laissez-faire
society there are no trade
restrictions and consequently no
black markets.
Some still argue that ABC
would first act as an excellent,
well-run, respectable defense
agency until it acquired a large
market share at which time it
would completely switch roles
and become an aggressive
criminal. It should be noted first
that any such agency with a large
market share would be very
financially successful and thus
would have attained the goal
(wealth) of most criminal activity.
But even if this situation held,
ABC could not command the
power a government does, since
(1) its customers are free to
switch to other agencies, once
ABC's criminal intentions are
suspected; (2) ABC could not, as a
government can, grant its
employees immunity from
retaliation when the employees
themselves initiate violence; (3)
ABC could not rob money as
easily as the government taxes;
and (4) ABC could not acquire
soldiers as easily as a government
drafts them. It seems much more
likely indeed that a government
can come to power and wage war
and shed blood than that a
criminal private defense agency
will survive on the free market, let
alone obtain considerable power.
To summarize, the basic point
of this two-part article is that the
government has no right to
control an individual's life at its
own will, and that with regard to
police protection as well as all
other goods and services,
individuals should be free to make
their own choices and run their
own lives.

Second of two parts
One conclusion of yesterday's
article was that, under the present
system, policemen have no
built-in incentives to provide good
service since their income does
not come directly from their
customers and since the
government police system as a
unit is a coercive monopoly which
means that competitors are illegal
and consequently no business
threat.
These are reasons, not only for
poor police service, but also for
poor government service
generally, e.g., the Post Office,
and poor service in areas which
are nominally privately owned,
but to a large extent
government-controlled, e.g.,
certain railroads.
Today's article will discuss
what I believe is the best police
system possible: the replacement
of a government police system
with a system in which protection
services are bought and sold from
private police agencies.
Other vital services, such as
food and medical care, already are
provided without the government,

and I would argue, although it is
beyond the scope of this article,
that such imperfections as exist in
these markets are govern mentally
imposed. Note that just as the
market's food and medical
services obviate the need for a
given citizen to study agriculture
or medicine in order to eat or to
safeguard his health, so too uner a
private police system, each citizen
need not study criminology or
arm himself, but could delegate
his reuired protection to a private
defense agency.
Below we'll consider one
possible defense agency system,
although it must be stated that it
is impossible for us to envision the
technological advances and
efficient service that would arise
when each defense agency tries its
best to protect you better than its
competitors do. The ideas herein
are discussed in much more detail
in The Market for Liberty by
Morris and Linda Tanehill and
Society Without Coercion by
Jarret Wollstein.
Two possible methods of
financing private defense agencies
are (1) service contracts, which

would be essentially insurance
contracts between an individual
and a protection agency, and (2)
specific fees paid for specific
services. These agencies might also
gain revenue through special
contracts with other firms.
For example, if roads were
privately owned, say if the
Junipero Serra Freeway and the
Bayshore Freeway were owned by
two separate firms and each
competed to provide you with the
most pleasant journey to San
Francisco, then, among other
things, these firms would hire
policemen to guard against
reckless driving.
So far as operations are
concerned, if crimes were
reported or discovered after the
fact, then, assuming that the
victim had an insurance contract
or was willing to pay a specific
investigatory fee, the police
agency would try to rectify the
injustice. The situation is a bit
more complicated with crimes
discovered by police during their
occurrence.
If a policeman discovers that
you are being mugged, he clearly
has no time to check with his
agency to see if you are insured.
Nevertheless, it is in his and his
company's interest that he help
you. First, you might be a
customer of his agency. Second,
even if you are not, there is a
good chance that after being
rescued, you would either become
insured by his agency or at least
pay for this particular services,
although you would not be
obliged to unless you hollered
"Help, police!" in which case you
would be making a verbal contract
similar to that of a man in a
restaurant who, upon ordering a
meal, has made a verbal contract
to pay the check.
Policemen could be rewarded
on the number of new customers
they obtained for their company
and hence would have an
incentive to perform such rescues.
Finally, these rescues create good
will for the agency and,
consequently, a greater likelihood
of business.
Since a private defense
company's only function is to
protect its customers from
coercion, it must perform this
function with excellence or else
go out of business. Government
officials, as we've seen before,
have no such incentives. For
example, under the present
system, if, say, a racist policeman
should happen to brutalize an
innocent black, aroused citizens
can do little more than write
letters to the local newspaper.
Moreover, no matter how much
one disapproves of the
government's police service, one's
money is still confiscated, i.e.,
