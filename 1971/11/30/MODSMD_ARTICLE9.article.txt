# Mike Nock Quartet
## Awesome New Group 
### MARC BARMAN 
Hearing a new group getting
itself together is like watching a
baby being born. Pain, joy, tears
and smiles, all mixed together
with love.
The new, emerging Mike
Quartet is that kind of an
experience. As you would look at
the new-born baby and wonder
what its future will hold, so do
you listen to this group and
wonder if the future will bring it
the recognition it deserves.
Because this group is good,
really good, and it's only just
begun to grow. New concepts in
music are being borni and tried;
some to be discarded, some to be
kept to give birth to others.
New Generation
Mike is one of the foremost of
the new generation of musicians.
He's played with people like Larry
Coryell and Steve Markus, John
Handy, etc., and most recently a
very fine group called The Fourth
Way. Among other things, Mike
plays beautiful electric piano. The
other things are an ARP
Synthesizer and an Echo plex.
Now this ARP Synthesizer
(Nock is playing it in the picture
above) is an incredible beast. It
produces any sound you can
name, and a lot of sounds you
can't. It's got wires, switches, and
blinking lights hanging all over it,

and Mike plays it like the sth,
6th, and 7th members of his
quartet. The range of emotions he
can sound from it leave you
breathless.
The inspiring thing is, he
doesn't cop-out and use it as a
gimmick, like Switched-on Bach,
Dr. Frankenstein's Electronic
Christmas Carols, and others of
the ilk. It's all musical,
spontaneous, mind-boggling, and
brilliant.
Joy to Behold
So why bother to have other
musicians, right? Well, no mere
machine could ever match
drummer Eddie Marshall. A
Rahsaan Roland Kirk alumnus,
Eddie was also in The Fourth Way
before this group. The man
positively dances on his drums
and is a joy to behold. An endless
flow of original ideas and a fine
poly rhythmic time sense
characterize this dynamo. Eddie
Marshall is a dirty, funky
drummer.
Dennis Parker and his big
electric bass come by way of the
Don Ellis Band and Tom Jones.
(Tom Jones? Well, don't knock it.
Tom Jones NEEDS a good bass
player.) He's got one of those
giant, resonating sounds and
chooses notes that are truly
juicy. And he's a gas to watch.
The quart of the quartet is Bill
Connor's electric guitar. Bill is a

dynamite guitarist who plays with
an advanced harmonic framework
and a lot of fire. He cooks like
crazy.
Awesome Assemblage
Last Friday night at In Your Ear
this awesome assemblage cut loose
with tunes ranging from hard rock
to electronic ephemeral. Included
were Herbie Hancock's
"Blow-Up," and an untitled piece
by San Francisco composer Johy
Wilier, along with a spectrum of
exciting Nock and Marshall
originals..
They should be putting an
album out shortly. Right now
they're around the Bay Area
letting things grow together. Look
for them to be back at In You Ear
and listen for them at other clubs
and concerts around the Bay.
Nurse this baby with your
mind.

electric bass come by way of the
Don Ellis Band and Tom Jones.
(Tom Jones? Well, don't knock it.
Tom Jones NEEDS a good bass
player.) He's got one of those
giant, resonating sounds and
chooses notes that are truly
juicy. And he's a gas to watch.
The quart of the quartet is Bill
Connor's electric guitar. Bill is a

dynamite guitarist who plays with
an advanced harmonic framework
and a lot of fire. He cooks like
crazy.
Awesome Assemblage
Last Friday night at In Your Ear
this awesome assemblage cut loose
with tunes ranging from hard rock
to electronic ephemeral. Included
were Herbie Hancock's
"Blow-Up," and an untitled piece
by San Francisco composer Johy
Wilier, along with a spectrum of
exciting Nock and Marshall
originals..
They should be putting an
album out shortly. Right now
they're around the Bay Area
letting things grow together. Look
for them to be back at In You Ear
and listen for them at other clubs
and concerts around the Bay.
Nurse this baby with your
mind.

Hearing a new group getting
itself together is like watching a
baby being born. Pain, joy, tears
and smiles, all mixed together
with love.
The new, emerging Mike
Quartet is that kind of an
experience. As you would look at
the new-born baby and wonder
what its future will hold, so do
you listen to this group and
wonder if the future will bring it
the recognition it deserves.
Because this group is good,
really good, and it's only just
begun to grow. New concepts in
music are being borni and tried;
some to be discarded, some to be
kept to give birth to others.
New Generation
Mike is one of the foremost of
the new generation of musicians.
He's played with people like Larry
Coryell and Steve Markus, John
Handy, etc., and most recently a
very fine group called The Fourth
Way. Among other things, Mike
plays beautiful electric piano. The
other things are an ARP
Synthesizer and an Echo plex.
Now this ARP Synthesizer
(Nock is playing it in the picture
above) is an incredible beast. It
produces any sound you can
name, and a lot of sounds you
can't. It's got wires, switches, and
blinking lights hanging all over it,

and Mike plays it like the sth,
6th, and 7th members of his
quartet. The range of emotions he
can sound from it leave you
breathless.
The inspiring thing is, he
doesn't cop-out and use it as a
gimmick, like Switched-on Bach,
Dr. Frankenstein's Electronic
Christmas Carols, and others of
the ilk. It's all musical,
spontaneous, mind-boggling, and
brilliant.
Joy to Behold
So why bother to have other
musicians, right? Well, no mere
machine could ever match
drummer Eddie Marshall. A
Rahsaan Roland Kirk alumnus,
Eddie was also in The Fourth Way
before this group. The man
positively dances on his drums
and is a joy to behold. An endless
flow of original ideas and a fine
poly rhythmic time sense
characterize this dynamo. Eddie
Marshall is a dirty, funky
drummer.
Dennis Parker and his big
electric bass come by way of the
Don Ellis Band and Tom Jones.
