# Primate Specialist Discusses Work
## 
### TERRIE McDONALD 
When asked why deadly insects and the hazards
abounding on the shores of Lake Tanganyika had not
driven her out of Africa, chimpanzee specialist Jane
van Lawick-C-oodall countered by asking why smog
hasn't driven everyone out of Los Angeles.
She dismissed bouts with malaria and encounters
with wild animals completely, as if the young
Englishwoman found them much less bothersome
than many Californians find smog.
Goodall, a visiting professor of Human Biology, has
spent nearly 11 years studying primates at the Gombe
Stream Chimpanzee Reserve in Tanzania. In an
interview Monday she discounted the inconveniences
of life in the wilds to stress that her research is the
continuing fulfillment of a childhood dream. Her
fondness for animals has engendered a dedication to a
study of primates in their natural habitat that is
unique in its thoroughness and scope.
Her observations of chimp behavior and the
insights they have contributed to understanding
man's closest primate relative have excited wide
scientific acclaim and provided the impetus for new
avenues of research, some of them directly affecting
Stanford.
Goodall has completed her first term of teaching
and research duties here and will return to Gombe
after Christmas to work on scientific analysis of her
material. She and her husband, photographer Hugo
van Lawick, will return here next spring to resume

her teaching and collaboration on plans for the
University's new primate center. Mr. van Lawick, who
also lectured in human biology this term, will
combine film editing with teaching in Stanford's
department of Communications next fall.
Primate Facility
The construction of a primate behavioral study
facility on Stanford land is the result of Jane
Goodall's cooperation with David Hamburg,
Chairman of the Psychiatry Department at the
Medical Center.
The primate center, which is scheduled to be
completed during the next academic year, is unique
in that it attempts to provide students and scientists
with the opportunity of closely studying chimps
raised in an environment simulating their natural
forest habitat. The compound's design is such that
the animals will be able to develop normally in peer
groups, yet be constantly available for observation.
"Experimentation in the wild is not possible," said
Goodall, "and working in a laboratory makes it
possible." The university researchers will observe
chimp interaction and use social manipulation, but
will disturb the primates' instinctive behavior as little
as possible. Goodall said that unlike other labs, the
Stanford center will provide "devices so the chimps
will have to hunt for their food.
Peek-A-800
"There will be trees for them to climb on, and space
where they can avoid companions or hide, but we will

be able to see them if we want."
Goodall explained, "Of course we can't give the
chimps their natural environment, but we can make
use of 11 years of understanding to give them an
environment in which they can live a normal life."
Even with her high praise and enthusiasm for the
Stanford project, she reacted with dismay to the
suggestion that Gombe chimps be brought to the
facility. "That would be like putting them in prison,"
she said.
However, she said that this was relative to the
environment they had grown up in, and not a
reflection on the Stanford center.
Sterile Cages
The inhumane treatment of animals in captivity,
and the stark zoo and lab environments she has
observed are particular concerns. "Most of the work
in labs is done on chimps in barren, sterile cages.
Chimps in cages display abnormal behavior, as you
would observe abnormal behavior if you caged a
human, particularly an adolescent," she said.
The research planned for Stanford's primate center
is so closely aligned with Goodall's work in Africa
that her co-workers have dubbed the facility "Gombe
West." It is being constructed with funds from the
Grant Foundation, the same organization supporting
the research in Tanzania.
"Looking at chimps gives you a new way of
looking at man," she said. "It directs research and its

ME TARZAN — Dr. Jane Goodall, noted primate specialist, has been instrumental
in the establishment of a center to study primates on campus. Goodall will return
to Africa shortly to continue her research.
