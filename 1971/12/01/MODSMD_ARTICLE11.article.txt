# Dental Clinic For Migrants Seeks Student Participation
## 
### 
A program which provides dental care to children of migrant
workers is now seeking participation by Stanford students. Founded
by Dr. Marvin Stark two years ago, this program involves three
"Mobile Dental Clinic" buses which service the Salinas and San
Joaquin Valleys.
TTie actual dental services are performed by students from the
University of California School of Dentistry, but other students are
needed to act as program coordinators, entertaining the children and
comforting their mothers who may never have seen a dentist.
Mark Rosenfeld of the Personnel Department here was responsible
for opening the Mobile Dental Clinic program to Stanford students.
The program starts in mid-June and lasts six weeks. Later in the
year the Clinic will travel to Israel, Greece, and Africa. Positions are
available for 20 Stanford students for this summer and six students
for the overseas program.
Those participating in the migrant worker area will receive $50 a
week, in addition to room and board. (Lodgings are at UC Santa Cruz
for the Salinas Valley route, and the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory
dormitories in Livermore for the San Joaquin route.)
The workday starts at 7:30 in the morning and continues until
8:00 at night, 5 days a week.
The program will be coordinated through the Dean of Students
Office and the Office of Financial Aids. For information, see Robert
Freelan, Acting Dean of Students.
On Wednesday, December 1, at 7:00 p.m. both Dr. Stark and
Rosenfeld will appear at Tresidder Union, Room 271, to explain this
work/study program in more detail.
