# Chauvinist Hockey
## 
### ALISON EDWARDS 
What can you say about a team of "various intramural drop-outs
and women's team groupies" who challenged the women's field
hockey A-team to a match? That they were just a bunch of guys
chasing a ball?
And what can you say about a girls' hockey team with a cheer like
Raw! Hockey. Only a bunch of women's libbers, disguised in heavy
artillery pinafores?
'Choose your weapon, chauvinist', Steve Lawton's letter to the girls
exorcized, proposing a game to decide "the natural superiority of
men." A spirited match, involving high ideals, high principles, but no
high-handedness. (Sticks had to be below the waist.)
The men, wearing blue jerseys, especially imported from Mexico
for the occasion, chased the girls from one end of the field to the
other with their clubs. (Responsible journalism forces me to admit
there was a small composition ball there somewhere.)
The first blow for the women was struck by Susan Talbot, who
managed to flash a ball by the aforementioned Mr. Lawton. Field
hockey may be a dead-end career for him, but he could very well be
the flash of genius the ballet world has been waiting for. Picture
Nureyev in a green baseball hat and sneakers.
Seconds after Lawton's neophyte lunge, Spike Herrick evened the
score. The women's coach was getting confused. "Let's go
Stanford ... er.. . girls!"
The men were starting to play dirty; they kept trying to lift up the
opponents skirts with their hockey sticks. One girl was sent to the
trainer with a ripped seam. She was given ten stitches.
Both eleven member teams were getting tired as the second
20-minute half began. This observer, watching closely, could not
detect any signs that they were popping pills, although they did
resume play with more life.
Raj Raghavan, an Indian ringer, made the second male goal, to the
dismay of one female player, who aeriated his tennis shorts with the
bottom of her shoe.
In the last desperate minutes, the girls could not score, and the
game was finally called because of darkness. "They had all the
breaks", their cage-guard commented ruefully, shaking her
goalie-locks.

player last year under the boards for possession of the ball. Rusco and
