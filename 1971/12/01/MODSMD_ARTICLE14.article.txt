# Icemen Defeat Berkeley Juniors
## 
### CHRIS COUNIHAN 
The Stanford Hockey team
ended a dismal three-game losing
streak with a spirited and
satisfying 5-3 victory over the
Berkeley Juniors on Monday
night.
The team had been performing
poorly in their three losses,
dropping two games to
league-leading San Francisco and
one to Belmont. In the second
loss to San Francisco the Indians
were in the game but couldn't
finish off their scoring plays.
Behind 4-3 in the closing minutes
of the game, Stanford pulled their
goalie for an extra skater. The
strategy backfired when San
Francisco scored on the empty
net clinching a 5-3 win.
The following Tuesday the

Cards took on Belmont before
one of the biggest crowds of the
season. The game was a
disappointment to the many
Stanford fans as the Indian squad
was throughly beaten 7-1, in one
of their poorest performances this
year.
Last Monday, Stanford faced
the Berkeley Juniors. The Juniors
took the lead in the first minutes
of the game on two fluke goals.
Though the Cards had been
known to give up in the past, this
time they fought back scoring
three goals over the next two
periods. The Indian's first goal
came as newcomer Cunji Nakatsu
fired a shot from the slot which
caromed off Redball Burke's pads
into the net for the score. Ralph
Brown's bouncing shot from the

point knotted the score at 2-2.
The Cards took the lead on
Nakatsu's second scoring play of
the night. His shot from about
twenty feet out caught the near
side of the net. However, Berkeley
came back to tie the game up as
they scored with Stanford two
men short.
The Cards were exerting
pressure on the Berkeley defense
in the second period, but the
Juniors held on until a defensive

lapse provided the Cards' Willie
Mcllvaine with a partial
breakaway. With a Berkeley
defender hanging all over him,
Mcllvaine was somehow able to
get off a shot which caught the
Berkeley goalie off guard and
Stanford took the lead. The Cards
did not let up as Russ MacAusland
tapped in a rebound off Pat
Baldwin's slapshot. The Cards
held on despite a penalty to win,
5-3.
