# Face 7th Ranked Houston
## Indians Begin Season 
### CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
The Stanford 1971-72
basketball teams will make their
debut tonight in Roscoe Maples
Pavilion as the frosh will take on
the Cal Medical Center at 6:00
p.m., and the varsity meets
seventh ranked Houston at 8:00
p.m.
Houston finished with a 22-7
record last year and won the
consolation game of the NCAA
Mid-West Regional Tournament
by downing Austin Carr and
Notre Dame by the score of
119-106.
Davis and his teammates
expect to go all the way this year,
and many basketball writers
believe that they have a chance to
win the national championship.
6'10" super soph Dwight Jones
plays center for Houston and has
been named to several potential
All-American lists for his fine play
on the United States' Pan
American team last summer.
Three lettermen round out the
Cougars' starting squad. 6'7"
forward Steve Newsome hit for 29
points against Notre Dame last
year, and 6'4" Jerry Bonney and
6'o" Larry Brown playmake for
the powerful front line of the
Cougars.
Facing this awesome package
of talent will be a Howie Dallmar
lineup that boasts three
newcomers. David Frost, a 6'5"
transfer who led Long Beach City

College to the California Junior
College Championship last year,
will start at forward. He will be
flanked by Mike Mann who
averaged 16 points and 11
rebounds a game for the Stanford
freshmen last year.
Another transfer will start in
the front line as 6'10" center Jack
Loomis has been selected by
Dallmar to go against Jones
tonight. Loomis transferred from
Harvard a year ago and sat out last
season.
Two time letterman Claude
Terry will lead the Indians against
Houston tonight as he attempts to
improve on his 21 point scoring
average last season. Terry has
scored 1035 points in his two year
Stanford career and should move
into first place in the Indians' all
time scoring standings this season.
Starting at the other guard
position will be junior Pat Rusco
who nosed out five other players
for the remaining opening night
starting position. Dallmar expects
John Stratton, Darrell Fregia,
Gary Cain, Bob Nicholson, and
Bruce Menser to see a lot of
action this year, however.
7'o" center Rich Kelley will
make his first appearance in a
Stanford uniform in the
preliminary to the varsity game as
the freshmen play the U.C.
Medical Center.
Both the freshmen and the
varsity will also play on Friday

night when they travel to San
Francisco to play the University
of San Francisco frosh and varsity
in games beginning at 6:00 p.m.
and 8:00 p.m.
