Lin Piao Fallen
TOKYO — China's leading political, military and
theoretical organs broke a long silence today with a
joint editorial which appeared to confirm that Lin
Piao, Mao Tse-tung's heir-designate, has fallen from
political grace.
A joint editorial on party leadership by the Peking
People's Daily, the Liberation Army Daily, and Red
Hag failed to mention Lin, deputy chairman of the
party and defense minister.
References to Mao himself were subdued,
suggesting that either at his own request or the ruling
Central Committee of the party, the 77-year old
leader has been downgraded from demigod status to
that of first among equals.
Lin's name has not appeared in the Chinese press
since Sept. 8 when he, Mao and Premier Chou En-Lai
sent a joint message congratulating North Korea on
its national day.
S.F. Chief Asks Gun Curbs
SAN FRANCISCO — Police Chief Donald M. Scott
proposed yesterday drastic curbs on the use of
firearms by policemen and immediate suspension of
all officers involved in killings.
Scott, who took over as chief in September, said
policemen would have to "exhaust all other
reasonable means of apprehension and control"
before using their guns under the proposed new
policy.
He said officers would be prohibited from firing
their guns as warnings, in all misdemeanor cases, at
juveniles or moving cars. They would still be
permitted to shoot under specific extenuating
circumstances including "necessary defense."
Scott also proposed that policemen involved in
fatal shootings be suspended automatically with pay
and placed in a special duty status.
The officer would not be returned to regular duty
"until a final determination has been made regarding
this homicide," he said, adding that the proposal
"contains neither stigma nor punishment."
China Plans Revealed
WASHINGTON — President Nixon plans to spend a
full week in Communist China visiting three cities
during his historic journey in February. The White

House announced that the chief executive will hold
summit talks in Peking, Shanghai and Hangchou.
After the announcement the President's national
security affairs adviser, Henry Kissinger, said the talks
will not result in bringing peace to Vietnam or
settling the future of Taiwan.
Russian Landing
PASADENA Calif. — The Russians have informed
scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory here of the
landing of a Soviet capsule on Mars, JPL spokesmen
said yesterday.
They said word of the landing came over a special
Russian-American teletype "hotline" set up for
exchanges of scientific information, but that they
couldn't quote the Russian message directly.
"All we can say is the message contained
essentially the same information released today in the
report by Tass on Mars 2 and 3," said a spokesman at
JPL, which is controller for America's Mariner 9 in its
orbit around Mars.
Tass, the Soviet news agency, said earlier yesterday
that Russia's Mars-orbiting spacecraft, Mars 2, fired a
capsule containing a hammer and sickle pennant to
the surface of Mars and then went into orbit around
the planet.
Left unanswered was whether the capsule
contained any sort of instrument package to report
conditions on Mars, and JPL spokesmen said they
couldn't elaborate on the Russian message.
'Hartke Erroneous'
WASHINGTON — Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird
has accused Sen. Vance Hartke of using personal
correspondence to spread "erroneous information"
about the war in Vietnam.
Laird's charge came in a letter to the Indiana
Democrat dated Monday and made public yesterday.
It was the latest in a debate-by-mail that developed in
late September when Laid wrote to Hartke to take
issue with the war critic's charge that President Nixon
has lied blatantly and long about Vietnam.
The defense secretary said he felt compelled to
make the exchanges public "because you are
spreading erroneous information by distributing my
personal letter to you and your misleading reply . . . "
Laird also wrote that Hartke was resorting to
attacks on the President's character rather than his

policies.
A spokesman for Hartke said there would not be
an immediate reply.
In his original letter, Laird told Hartke, "it is very
clear from the record that this administration has
never raised false hopes about Vietnam nor made
promises it couldn't deliver."
Not so, responded Hartke in a letter dated Oct. 2:
"Mel, I am sorry to be so blunt about this, but I want
you to know that there is ample evidence concerning
the deception practiced by the President in
Vietnam."
Hartke maintained that Nixon's words have
changed since 1954 when he advocated American
involvement in Indochina to aid the French, not his
actions.
The President's main purpose, the senator
maintained, is to impose a colonial government on
the people of Vietnam.
"You seem preoccupied," Laird wrote in the letter
released Tuesday, "with holding the President to
absolute consistency in every word he has uttered
over a period that spans more than 17 years."
Kent Stale Verdicts
RAVENNA Ohio — One of 25 persons indicted in
last year's Kent State disorders was convicted of a
misdemeanor yesterday and the case against a second
was dismissed.
A jury found Jerry Rupe guilty of interfering with
firemen but failed to reach a verdict on three felony
counts—arson, first-degree riot and assaulting a
fireman. It was dismissed as deadlocked after eight
hours of deliberation.
Henderson Defense Rests
FT. MEADE # Md. — The defense of Col. Oran K.
Henderson, accused of covering up the My Lai
massacre, rested yesterday in the last of the
courts-martial arising from the 1968 assault on the
South Vietnamese hamlet.
With direct testimony concluded, Maj. Carroll J.
Tichenor, the prosecutor in the trial which began
more than three months ago, said he expects the case
to go to the jury of two generals and five colonels
sometime next week.

attacks on the President's character rather than his

policies.
A spokesman for Hartke said there would not be
an immediate reply.
In his original letter, Laird told Hartke, "it is very

never raised false hopes about Vietnam nor made
promises it couldn't deliver."
Not so, responded Hartke in a letter dated Oct. 2:
"Mel, I am sorry to be so blunt about this, but I want
you to know that there is ample evidence concerning
the deception practiced by the President in
Vietnam."
Hartke maintained that Nixon's words have
changed since 1954 when he advocated American
involvement in Indochina to aid the French, not his
actions.
The President's main purpose, the senator
maintained, is to impose a colonial government on
the people of Vietnam.
"You seem preoccupied," Laird wrote in the letter
released Tuesday, "with holding the President to
absolute consistency in every word he has uttered
over a period that spans more than 17 years."
Kent Stale Verdicts
RAVENNA Ohio — One of 25 persons indicted in
last year's Kent State disorders was convicted of a
misdemeanor yesterday and the case against a second
was dismissed.
A jury found Jerry Rupe guilty of interfering with
firemen but failed to reach a verdict on three felony
counts—arson, first-degree riot and assaulting a
fireman. It was dismissed as deadlocked after eight
hours of deliberation.
Henderson Defense Rests
FT. MEADE # Md. — The defense of Col. Oran K.
Henderson, accused of covering up the My Lai
massacre, rested yesterday in the last of the
courts-martial arising from the 1968 assault on the
South Vietnamese hamlet.
With direct testimony concluded, Maj. Carroll J.
Tichenor, the prosecutor in the trial which began
more than three months ago, said he expects the case
to go to the jury of two generals and five colonels
sometime next week.
Lin Piao Fallen
TOKYO — China's leading political, military and
theoretical organs broke a long silence today with a
joint editorial which appeared to confirm that Lin
Piao, Mao Tse-tung's heir-designate, has fallen from
political grace.
A joint editorial on party leadership by the Peking
People's Daily, the Liberation Army Daily, and Red
Hag failed to mention Lin, deputy chairman of the
party and defense minister.
References to Mao himself were subdued,
suggesting that either at his own request or the ruling
Central Committee of the party, the 77-year old
leader has been downgraded from demigod status to
that of first among equals.
Lin's name has not appeared in the Chinese press
since Sept. 8 when he, Mao and Premier Chou En-Lai
sent a joint message congratulating North Korea on
its national day.
S.F. Chief Asks Gun Curbs
SAN FRANCISCO — Police Chief Donald M. Scott
proposed yesterday drastic curbs on the use of
firearms by policemen and immediate suspension of
all officers involved in killings.
Scott, who took over as chief in September, said
policemen would have to "exhaust all other
reasonable means of apprehension and control"
before using their guns under the proposed new
policy.
He said officers would be prohibited from firing
their guns as warnings, in all misdemeanor cases, at
juveniles or moving cars. They would still be
permitted to shoot under specific extenuating
circumstances including "necessary defense."
Scott also proposed that policemen involved in
fatal shootings be suspended automatically with pay
and placed in a special duty status.
The officer would not be returned to regular duty
"until a final determination has been made regarding
this homicide," he said, adding that the proposal
"contains neither stigma nor punishment."
China Plans Revealed
WASHINGTON — President Nixon plans to spend a
full week in Communist China visiting three cities
during his historic journey in February. The White

House announced that the chief executive will hold
summit talks in Peking, Shanghai and Hangchou.
After the announcement the President's national
security affairs adviser, Henry Kissinger, said the talks
will not result in bringing peace to Vietnam or
settling the future of Taiwan.
Russian Landing
PASADENA Calif. — The Russians have informed
scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory here of the
landing of a Soviet capsule on Mars, JPL spokesmen
said yesterday.
They said word of the landing came over a special
Russian-American teletype "hotline" set up for
exchanges of scientific information, but that they
couldn't quote the Russian message directly.
"All we can say is the message contained
essentially the same information released today in the
report by Tass on Mars 2 and 3," said a spokesman at
JPL, which is controller for America's Mariner 9 in its
orbit around Mars.
Tass, the Soviet news agency, said earlier yesterday
that Russia's Mars-orbiting spacecraft, Mars 2, fired a
capsule containing a hammer and sickle pennant to
the surface of Mars and then went into orbit around
the planet.
Left unanswered was whether the capsule
contained any sort of instrument package to report
conditions on Mars, and JPL spokesmen said they
couldn't elaborate on the Russian message.
'Hartke Erroneous'
WASHINGTON — Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird

Laird's charge came in a letter to the Indiana

It was the latest in a debate-by-mail that developed in
late September when Laid wrote to Hartke to take
issue with the war critic's charge that President Nixon
has lied blatantly and long about Vietnam.
The defense secretary said he felt compelled to
make the exchanges public "because you are
spreading erroneous information by distributing my
personal letter to you and your misleading reply . . . "

House announced that the chief executive will hold
summit talks in Peking, Shanghai and Hangchou.
After the announcement the President's national
security affairs adviser, Henry Kissinger, said the talks
will not result in bringing peace to Vietnam or
settling the future of Taiwan.
Russian Landing
PASADENA Calif. — The Russians have informed
scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory here of the
landing of a Soviet capsule on Mars, JPL spokesmen
said yesterday.
They said word of the landing came over a special
Russian-American teletype "hotline" set up for
exchanges of scientific information, but that they
couldn't quote the Russian message directly.
"All we can say is the message contained
essentially the same information released today in the
report by Tass on Mars 2 and 3," said a spokesman at
JPL, which is controller for America's Mariner 9 in its
orbit around Mars.
Tass, the Soviet news agency, said earlier yesterday
that Russia's Mars-orbiting spacecraft, Mars 2, fired a
capsule containing a hammer and sickle pennant to
the surface of Mars and then went into orbit around
the planet.
Left unanswered was whether the capsule
contained any sort of instrument package to report
conditions on Mars, and JPL spokesmen said they
couldn't elaborate on the Russian message.
'Hartke Erroneous'
WASHINGTON — Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird
has accused Sen. Vance Hartke of using personal
correspondence to spread "erroneous information"
about the war in Vietnam.
Laird's charge came in a letter to the Indiana
Democrat dated Monday and made public yesterday.
It was the latest in a debate-by-mail that developed in
late September when Laid wrote to Hartke to take
issue with the war critic's charge that President Nixon
has lied blatantly and long about Vietnam.
The defense secretary said he felt compelled to
make the exchanges public "because you are
spreading erroneous information by distributing my
personal letter to you and your misleading reply . . . "
Laird also wrote that Hartke was resorting to
attacks on the President's character rather than his

policies.
A spokesman for Hartke said there would not be
an immediate reply.
In his original letter, Laird told Hartke, "it is very
clear from the record that this administration has
never raised false hopes about Vietnam nor made
promises it couldn't deliver."
Not so, responded Hartke in a letter dated Oct. 2:
"Mel, I am sorry to be so blunt about this, but I want
you to know that there is ample evidence concerning
the deception practiced by the President in
Vietnam."
Hartke maintained that Nixon's words have
changed since 1954 when he advocated American
involvement in Indochina to aid the French, not his
actions.
The President's main purpose, the senator
maintained, is to impose a colonial government on
the people of Vietnam.
"You seem preoccupied," Laird wrote in the letter
released Tuesday, "with holding the President to
absolute consistency in every word he has uttered
over a period that spans more than 17 years."
Kent Stale Verdicts
RAVENNA Ohio — One of 25 persons indicted in
last year's Kent State disorders was convicted of a
misdemeanor yesterday and the case against a second
was dismissed.
A jury found Jerry Rupe guilty of interfering with
firemen but failed to reach a verdict on three felony
counts—arson, first-degree riot and assaulting a
fireman. It was dismissed as deadlocked after eight
hours of deliberation.
Henderson Defense Rests
FT. MEADE # Md. — The defense of Col. Oran K.
Henderson, accused of covering up the My Lai
massacre, rested yesterday in the last of the
courts-martial arising from the 1968 assault on the
South Vietnamese hamlet.
With direct testimony concluded, Maj. Carroll J.
Tichenor, the prosecutor in the trial which began
more than three months ago, said he expects the case
to go to the jury of two generals and five colonels
sometime next week.
Lin Piao Fallen
TOKYO — China's leading political, military and
theoretical organs broke a long silence today with a
joint editorial which appeared to confirm that Lin
Piao, Mao Tse-tung's heir-designate, has fallen from
political grace.
A joint editorial on party leadership by the Peking
People's Daily, the Liberation Army Daily, and Red
Hag failed to mention Lin, deputy chairman of the
party and defense minister.
References to Mao himself were subdued,
suggesting that either at his own request or the ruling
Central Committee of the party, the 77-year old
leader has been downgraded from demigod status to
that of first among equals.
Lin's name has not appeared in the Chinese press
since Sept. 8 when he, Mao and Premier Chou En-Lai
sent a joint message congratulating North Korea on
its national day.
S.F. Chief Asks Gun Curbs
SAN FRANCISCO — Police Chief Donald M. Scott
proposed yesterday drastic curbs on the use of
firearms by policemen and immediate suspension of
all officers involved in killings.
Scott, who took over as chief in September, said
policemen would have to "exhaust all other
reasonable means of apprehension and control"
before using their guns under the proposed new
policy.
He said officers would be prohibited from firing
their guns as warnings, in all misdemeanor cases, at
juveniles or moving cars. They would still be
permitted to shoot under specific extenuating
circumstances including "necessary defense."
Scott also proposed that policemen involved in
fatal shootings be suspended automatically with pay
and placed in a special duty status.
The officer would not be returned to regular duty
"until a final determination has been made regarding
this homicide," he said, adding that the proposal
"contains neither stigma nor punishment."
