# Dolly Grievance Panel Submits Recommendations
## 
### DAN BRENNER 
The three members of the grievance
committee reviewing the case of
suspended Hospital employee John
Dolly recommended the University give
serious consideration to arranging with
Dolly for suitable remuneration.
This suggestion accompanied the
earlier announced unanimous
recommendation that Dolly be
immediately reinstated. Both
recommendations were presented
formally to Vice-President Clayton
Rich who will review them.
Douglas DuPenn, of SLAC,
chairman of the committee, noted in a
Daily interview last night that, "We
recommended back pay" to the degree
outlined in the report. He urged that
there be "a little bit of
humanitarianism" in the University's
decision.
The report cited "the unique aspects
of the case, the financial position of
Dolly, the economic hardships he and
his family have suffered, the
unfortunately long period of time
elapsed, the small amount of money
involved, and the good will achievable."
Rich, who under grievance
procedures has five working days to
respond to the recommendations,
noted last night that he "hasn't had

time to study the report. I certainly
will have a decision within the five
days."
The report, which was presented to
Rich on Monday, said that, "The delay
from the effective dissolution of the
original reviewing committee August 9
to the appointment of a successor
committee October 6 was excessive and
primarily due to inaction on the part of
the administration."
The report added that Dolly's
participation in the administration area
of the hospital during the April 9 sit-in
was "minimal."
"Dolly has since stated publicly that
he was and is in sympathy with the
demonstrators and that had his wife
not been pregnant he may well have
remained in the sit-in area voluntarily,
after notice of the impending policy
action. However, in fact, he did not,"
the committee noted.
According to grievance procedure,
Rich may either provide a response to
the committee's report or accept their
recommendations.
Dolly, a genetics department
employee, was dismissed June 21 by
Robert Nelson, director of personnel
and employee relations, for alleged
participation in the Medical Center
incident.
