# Faculty Club Off The Wagon, Liquor License Won At Last
## 
### JERRY COLEMAN 
After over two years of conflicting
rulings, the Appeals Board for the State
Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) has
finally granted the Stanford Faculty
Club a liquor license. Monday's
decision by the Board overturned a
previous ABC ruling denying a license.
Before October, 1969, faculty
members were able to keep private
supplies of liquor in individual rented
lockers in the Club. At that time, the
ABC ordered the lockers to be emptied,
claiming that the arrangement was in
violation of the California Business and
Professions Code.

The ABC also stated that keeping or
serving alcohol without a license is a
"public nuisance."
In reply, the Faculty Club formally
applied for a liquor license, an action
arousing much public clamor in the
spring of 1970.
Women Upset
Especially critical was the Woman's
Club of Palo Alto. One spokesman
opposing the license asked, "How soon
will the students be demanding a bar in
Tresidder?"
According to a Palo Alto Times
article written at the time, a "parade of
anti-liquor warriors appearing at a

hearing of the ABC depicted visions of
drunken professors stumbling into their
classrooms after lunching at the
Faculty Club."
The ABC denied a license in
September, 1970, on the grounds that
the Faculty Club had not been in its
present quarters for the required 10
years.
Club Qualifies
That ruling was appealed to the ABC
Board, which stated this week that the
Faculty Club is an actual "Club"and
thus qualifies for the license.
Commenting on both the decision
and the fears expressed earlier of
intoxicated professors instructing their
afternoon classes, James Siena, Legal
Advisor to President Lyman, stated,
"some of the teaching might get
better."
End to Ban
In December, 1970, a Superior
Court Judge brought an end to the
liquor ban existing on formerly
Stanford-held Palo Alto land.
A state law that became effective on
November 23 of that year permitted
the issuance of on-sale licenses "right
up to the gates of college campuses,"
according to a San Francisco Chronicle
report.
These decisions severely reduced the
number of effective arguments available
to Faculty Club license protestors. With
Monday's Appeals Board ruling,
anti-liquor advocates seem to have lost
their battle.
Only one possible obstacle remains
in the way of full implementation of
the recent ruling. Before the ruling
becomes final, December 28, the ABC
can make its own appeal in the courts.
The principal legal counsel for the
ABC, Charles Cameron, said that he is
"studying carefully" the ruling with the
state attorney general's office. He said a
decision on whether to appeal or not
should be made in the next two weeks.

decision by the Board overturned a
previous ABC ruling denying a license.
Before October, 1969, faculty
members were able to keep private
supplies of liquor in individual rented
lockers in the Club. At that time, the
ABC ordered the lockers to be emptied,
claiming that the arrangement was in
violation of the California Business and
Professions Code.

The ABC also stated that keeping or
serving alcohol without a license is a
"public nuisance."
In reply, the Faculty Club formally
applied for a liquor license, an action
arousing much public clamor in the
spring of 1970.
Women Upset
Especially critical was the Woman's
Club of Palo Alto. One spokesman
opposing the license asked, "How soon
will the students be demanding a bar in
Tresidder?"
According to a Palo Alto Times
article written at the time, a "parade of
anti-liquor warriors appearing at a

hearing of the ABC depicted visions of
drunken professors stumbling into their
classrooms after lunching at the
Faculty Club."
The ABC denied a license in
September, 1970, on the grounds that
the Faculty Club had not been in its
present quarters for the required 10
years.
Club Qualifies
That ruling was appealed to the ABC
Board, which stated this week that the
Faculty Club is an actual "Club"and
thus qualifies for the license.
Commenting on both the decision
and the fears expressed earlier of
intoxicated professors instructing their
afternoon classes, James Siena, Legal
Advisor to President Lyman, stated,
"some of the teaching might get
better."
End to Ban
In December, 1970, a Superior
Court Judge brought an end to the
liquor ban existing on formerly
Stanford-held Palo Alto land.
A state law that became effective on
November 23 of that year permitted
the issuance of on-sale licenses "right
up to the gates of college campuses,"
according to a San Francisco Chronicle
report.
These decisions severely reduced the
number of effective arguments available
to Faculty Club license protestors. With
Monday's Appeals Board ruling,
anti-liquor advocates seem to have lost
their battle.
Only one possible obstacle remains
in the way of full implementation of
the recent ruling. Before the ruling
becomes final, December 28, the ABC
can make its own appeal in the courts.
The principal legal counsel for the
ABC, Charles Cameron, said that he is
"studying carefully" the ruling with the
state attorney general's office. He said a
decision on whether to appeal or not
should be made in the next two weeks.
