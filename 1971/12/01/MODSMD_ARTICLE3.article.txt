# 'Robin Hood' Opens Tonight
## Company Stages Experiments 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
The Company was formed in 1966
with the idea that drama should be
free, open to everybody, and not
confined to the theaters.
Since that time the independent
drama group has performed over 20
plays across campus, ranging from
Macbet'i to The Skin of Our Teeth.
Last spring they managed to stage four
separate productions attended by over
1400 people.
But in spite of the group's success,
its original philosophy has remained the
same.
"We're still oriented toward people
who might not act or direct otherwise,"
says Ralph Earle, the Company's
treasurer and producer. "The guys that
would be extras in (Drama) department
plays get to be the leads," he adds.
'Robin Hood'
In this quarter's group, which is
performing "Robin Hood" beginning
tonight, the leading man is a human
biology major. The cast also includes a
graduate student in electrical
engineering.
And the idea of getting people

involved in drama who would not be
otherwise extends beyond the cast.
Although the group could get
regular theaters on campus, it has
chosen instead to perform "where
people live and eat," says Karle.
Theaters Created
The group each quarter creates a
theater in such unlikely places as the
Toyon Lounge or Lagunia Dining Hall.
The plays the Company performs
are chosen in an open meeting at the
beginning of each term. Normally, the
Company does major productions in
the fall and spring, with shorter, more
experimental works in the winter.
The group's founder, English
Professor Larry Eriedlander, says he
started the group "because I felt that
drama on campus had become
overspecialized and that there was
really no theater for people not
interested in drama as a career."
Little Bureaucracy
In 1966 Friedlander presented
freshmen with his idea of a drama
group in which "everyone would act
and the group would run itself with as
little bureaucracy as possible."

About 60 freshmen presented
several Medieval plays at Mem Chu
under Friedlander's direction at that
time.
Since then Friedlander has
relinquished a major role in the group,
retaining the title of faculty advisor.
More Complexity
Since 1966, Company productions
have been opened up to all classes and
the productions have become more
complex, such as "Marat Sade
produced in the fall of 1968 and
"Caucasian Chalk Circle" by Brecht
performed in the winter of 1970.
But as the productions have become
more complex, so have the problems.
Even though William Shakespeare
said that "all the world's a stage," some
parts of the world are obviously more
suited for plays than dormitories,
where the Company chooses to
perform.
Rafters
One of the perennial problems is
lights, which have to be hung from any
available rafter. The stage has to be
built from scratch.
And the group doesn't have a lot of
money to "play around with."
It's budget of $400 dollars per
quarter is about enough these days for
two scripts.
But many feel that the miniscule
budget appears to have affected very
little the performace or spirit of the
group.
Exuberance
Friedlander notes that the Company
productions have less emphasis on a
technically polished product than on
"exuberance and spontaneity."
Friedlander adds that Company
productions tend to be more
"experimental."
This quarter's play, Robin Hood,

was adapted from the book this
summer by the play's director, Bill
Mahone, a junior.
Several students also composed the
songs in the play.
The play opens Wednesday evening
at 8 p.m. in the Lagunita Dining Room
and runs through Saturday. Friday's
performance will be at 10:30 p.m.
Donations
As with all Company plays,
admission is free, but donations, which
make up two thirds of the group's
budget are requested.
Last year the Company performed
seven different plays: The Three
Cuckolds, Dracula, Skin of Our Teeth,
Macßeth, Exit the King, The Little
Price, The Toad of Toad Hall, and
Mother Courage.
Michael Barry, Drama dept. chair
man who directed The Toad of Toad
Hall last spring, emphasizes the
"tremendous enthusiasm" which makes
up for any lack of subtler polish in the
group's productions.
Audiences Enthusiastic
Friedlander adds that the audiences
at Company productions are also
enthusiastic since "the kids come
because their friends are in it, it's free,
or because it's in their dorm."

Hall last spring, emphasizes the
"tremendous enthusiasm" which makes
up for any lack of subtler polish in the
group's productions.
Audiences Enthusiastic
Friedlander adds that the audiences
at Company productions are also
enthusiastic since "the kids come
because their friends are in it, it's free,
or because it's in their dorm."
The Company was formed in 1966
with the idea that drama should be
free, open to everybody, and not
confined to the theaters.
Since that time the independent
drama group has performed over 20
plays across campus, ranging from
Macbet'i to The Skin of Our Teeth.
Last spring they managed to stage four
separate productions attended by over
1400 people.
But in spite of the group's success,
its original philosophy has remained the
same.
"We're still oriented toward people
who might not act or direct otherwise,"
says Ralph Earle, the Company's
treasurer and producer. "The guys that
would be extras in (Drama) department
plays get to be the leads," he adds.
'Robin Hood'
In this quarter's group, which is
performing "Robin Hood" beginning
tonight, the leading man is a human
biology major. The cast also includes a
graduate student in electrical
engineering.
And the idea of getting people

involved in drama who would not be
otherwise extends beyond the cast.
Although the group could get
regular theaters on campus, it has
chosen instead to perform "where
people live and eat," says Karle.
Theaters Created
The group each quarter creates a
theater in such unlikely places as the
Toyon Lounge or Lagunia Dining Hall.
The plays the Company performs
are chosen in an open meeting at the
beginning of each term. Normally, the
Company does major productions in
the fall and spring, with shorter, more
experimental works in the winter.
The group's founder, English
Professor Larry Eriedlander, says he
started the group "because I felt that
drama on campus had become
overspecialized and that there was
really no theater for people not
interested in drama as a career."
Little Bureaucracy
In 1966 Friedlander presented
freshmen with his idea of a drama
group in which "everyone would act
and the group would run itself with as
little bureaucracy as possible."

About 60 freshmen presented
several Medieval plays at Mem Chu
under Friedlander's direction at that
time.
Since then Friedlander has
relinquished a major role in the group,
retaining the title of faculty advisor.
More Complexity
Since 1966, Company productions
have been opened up to all classes and
the productions have become more
complex, such as "Marat Sade
produced in the fall of 1968 and
"Caucasian Chalk Circle" by Brecht
performed in the winter of 1970.
But as the productions have become
more complex, so have the problems.
Even though William Shakespeare
said that "all the world's a stage," some
parts of the world are obviously more
suited for plays than dormitories,
where the Company chooses to
perform.
Rafters
One of the perennial problems is
lights, which have to be hung from any
available rafter. The stage has to be
built from scratch.
And the group doesn't have a lot of
money to "play around with."
It's budget of $400 dollars per
quarter is about enough these days for
two scripts.
But many feel that the miniscule
budget appears to have affected very
little the performace or spirit of the
group.
Exuberance
Friedlander notes that the Company
productions have less emphasis on a
technically polished product than on
"exuberance and spontaneity."
Friedlander adds that Company
productions tend to be more
"experimental."
This quarter's play, Robin Hood,

was adapted from the book this
summer by the play's director, Bill
Mahone, a junior.
Several students also composed the
songs in the play.
The play opens Wednesday evening
at 8 p.m. in the Lagunita Dining Room
and runs through Saturday. Friday's
performance will be at 10:30 p.m.
Donations
As with all Company plays,
admission is free, but donations, which
make up two thirds of the group's
budget are requested.
Last year the Company performed
seven different plays: The Three
Cuckolds, Dracula, Skin of Our Teeth,
Macßeth, Exit the King, The Little
Price, The Toad of Toad Hall, and
Mother Courage.

make up two thirds of the group's
budget are requested.
Last year the Company performed
seven different plays: The Three
Cuckolds, Dracula, Skin of Our Teeth,
Macßeth, Exit the King, The Little
Price, The Toad of Toad Hall, and
Mother Courage.
Michael Barry, Drama dept. chair
man who directed The Toad of Toad
Hall last spring, emphasizes the
"tremendous enthusiasm" which makes
up for any lack of subtler polish in the
group's productions.
Audiences Enthusiastic
Friedlander adds that the audiences
at Company productions are also
enthusiastic since "the kids come
because their friends are in it, it's free,
or because it's in their dorm."
