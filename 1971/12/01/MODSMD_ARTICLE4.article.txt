# Students Fight 'Medical Poverty'
## Clinic Aids Community 
### CRAIG MALLOY 
"You don't have to go to Vietnam, but to Merced
County .... to see that we have areas of real medical
poverty. The main thrust of medicine has been along basic
research lines to discover and develop new and better
techniques. There has been a certain amount of neglect for
people in the process," according to former Stanford
medical student Joe Neal.
Neal says this is one reason for the initiation of an
innovative health care program by Stanford medical
students and faculty in Livingston, an agricultural
community of 11,000 in the heart of Merced County.
Stanford became associated with the Livingston
community in the summer of 1969 when Stanford medical
students headed by Wells Shoemaker organized a clinic for
migrant farm workers. Through the summer the service was
open three evenings a week and treated 1000 patients. The
clinic used the facilities of Livingston's only doctor, Dr. J.
J. Wolohan, who was leaving to enter psychiatric training in
the fall of 1970.
As a result of the success of the program, Shoemaker
and Wolohan suggested that Stanford buy Wolohan's
offices and establish a health service. Dr. Count Gibson,
chairman of the Department of Community Health and
Preventive Medicine at Stanford, proposed that Livingston
establish a community owned health center with Stanford
advice.
Community Approves Center
Gibson and other Stanford doctors, notably Dr. William
Fowkes, continued their help and encouragement, and in
the fall of 1969 the Livingston citizenry heard a proposal
to develop a community controlled clinic in association
with Stanford. The people of Livingston approved the
proposal.
The newly-established Health Service proceeded to buy
Wolohan's offices and equipment. These facilities, used for
the summer clinic, provided the nucleus of the new service.
The community secured funds from government and
private sources and from benefits and business
contributions within Livingston. In July, 1970, the
Livingston Community Health Service opened its doors.
During the first summer there were some inconveniences
for both patient and doctor. The health center initially
encountered difficulty attaining its goal of 24-hour local
service because the center was staffed by commuting
Stanford medical students and doctors. In an emergency,
doctor and patient met halfway between Stanford and
Livingston.
These difficulties were eased when Dr. Everett Johnson,
an internist, received a Stanford Medical School Clinical
appointment and became director of the health center. To
augment the staff and services, the community board
authorized Johnson and Gibson to make the initial
selection of a full time pediatrician, who Gibson believes
will be named by January.

The second problem was not easily solved; when
Wolohan left Livingston, the people lost more than his
medical services. They lost a very personal friend. As a
result, there was a certain reluctance to accept the clinic as
Wolohan's replacement. But doctors and medical students
are overcoming this guardedness through caring for an
entire family with a "personal touch."
The Community Health Service and its relation to
Stanford is unique in many ways. Gibson comments, "It is
the kind of partnership (with a community) that university
medical centers have not thought of achieving in the past."
The Health Service may be of greater significance for the
Stanford School of Medicine than for the people of
Livingston.
Gibson explains that traditionally the emphasis in
medical education has been on "incubating" students in the
hospital, and on basic research. As a result, he says, "health
care has gone to hell," and the problems that have been
ignored for so long are "coming home to roost."
Gibson supports his statements by pointing to the wide
discrepancy between health care available to upper income
classes and to minority groups, and notes that national
health indicators, such as infant death rate, have slipped in
comparison to European nations. Health costs are high, he
says, and there is little effective return per health care
dollar.
Gibson sees community medicine, like that practiced in
Livingston, as the backbone of a solution to many of the
problems involved with providing health care to rural
communities. The advantages offered by community care
services over the established system in the United States are
numerous, he believes.
Because the community health center is locally owned
and controlled, there is a relatively high degree of contact
between the average citizen and the health organization.
Since a community center is responsible for all aspects of
its members health, it is an ideal way to practice preventive
medicine. The health center helps to integrate the
individual's interaction with his environment in terms of
road safety, school health, and industry.
Mutual Benefits
Stanford's relationship to the Livingston health center is
a mutually beneficial exchange, not simply dispensing
diagnosis and prescriptions. Stanford offers medical skills
and professionals, and Livingston offers a place for the
medical school to learn and apply community medicine.
The entire university benefits from the health center
because community health care involves fields other than
medicine, such as law and sociology - .
Medical school veterans of the Livingston experience
hold the opportunity in high esteem. Medical student
William Mitchell says, "1 can't express the warm feelings I
have for the place. It was by far the best experience of my
medical education."

Livingston Community Health Service opened its doors.
During the first summer there were some inconveniences
for both patient and doctor. The health center initially
encountered difficulty attaining its goal of 24-hour local
service because the center was staffed by commuting
Stanford medical students and doctors. In an emergency,
doctor and patient met halfway between Stanford and
Livingston.
These difficulties were eased when Dr. Everett Johnson,
an internist, received a Stanford Medical School Clinical
appointment and became director of the health center. To
augment the staff and services, the community board
authorized Johnson and Gibson to make the initial
selection of a full time pediatrician, who Gibson believes
will be named by January.

The second problem was not easily solved; when
Wolohan left Livingston, the people lost more than his
medical services. They lost a very personal friend. As a
result, there was a certain reluctance to accept the clinic as
Wolohan's replacement. But doctors and medical students
are overcoming this guardedness through caring for an
entire family with a "personal touch."
The Community Health Service and its relation to
Stanford is unique in many ways. Gibson comments, "It is
the kind of partnership (with a community) that university
medical centers have not thought of achieving in the past."
The Health Service may be of greater significance for the
Stanford School of Medicine than for the people of
Livingston.
Gibson explains that traditionally the emphasis in
medical education has been on "incubating" students in the
hospital, and on basic research. As a result, he says, "health
care has gone to hell," and the problems that have been
ignored for so long are "coming home to roost."
Gibson supports his statements by pointing to the wide
discrepancy between health care available to upper income
classes and to minority groups, and notes that national
health indicators, such as infant death rate, have slipped in
comparison to European nations. Health costs are high, he
says, and there is little effective return per health care
dollar.
Gibson sees community medicine, like that practiced in
Livingston, as the backbone of a solution to many of the
problems involved with providing health care to rural
communities. The advantages offered by community care
services over the established system in the United States are
numerous, he believes.
Because the community health center is locally owned
and controlled, there is a relatively high degree of contact
between the average citizen and the health organization.
Since a community center is responsible for all aspects of
its members health, it is an ideal way to practice preventive
medicine. The health center helps to integrate the
individual's interaction with his environment in terms of
road safety, school health, and industry.
Mutual Benefits
Stanford's relationship to the Livingston health center is
a mutually beneficial exchange, not simply dispensing
diagnosis and prescriptions. Stanford offers medical skills
and professionals, and Livingston offers a place for the
medical school to learn and apply community medicine.
The entire university benefits from the health center
because community health care involves fields other than
medicine, such as law and sociology - .
Medical school veterans of the Livingston experience
hold the opportunity in high esteem. Medical student
William Mitchell says, "1 can't express the warm feelings I
have for the place. It was by far the best experience of my
medical education."

COUNTRY CLINIC—Dr. Joe Neal examines a patient at the Livingston clinic, established by the medical school to improve
medical facilities in poor areas.
"You don't have to go to Vietnam, but to Merced
County .... to see that we have areas of real medical
poverty. The main thrust of medicine has been along basic
research lines to discover and develop new and better
techniques. There has been a certain amount of neglect for
people in the process," according to former Stanford
medical student Joe Neal.
Neal says this is one reason for the initiation of an
innovative health care program by Stanford medical
students and faculty in Livingston, an agricultural
community of 11,000 in the heart of Merced County.
Stanford became associated with the Livingston
community in the summer of 1969 when Stanford medical
students headed by Wells Shoemaker organized a clinic for
migrant farm workers. Through the summer the service was
open three evenings a week and treated 1000 patients. The
clinic used the facilities of Livingston's only doctor, Dr. J.
J. Wolohan, who was leaving to enter psychiatric training in
the fall of 1970.
As a result of the success of the program, Shoemaker
and Wolohan suggested that Stanford buy Wolohan's
offices and establish a health service. Dr. Count Gibson,
chairman of the Department of Community Health and
Preventive Medicine at Stanford, proposed that Livingston
establish a community owned health center with Stanford
advice.
Community Approves Center
Gibson and other Stanford doctors, notably Dr. William
Fowkes, continued their help and encouragement, and in
the fall of 1969 the Livingston citizenry heard a proposal
to develop a community controlled clinic in association
with Stanford. The people of Livingston approved the
proposal.
The newly-established Health Service proceeded to buy
Wolohan's offices and equipment. These facilities, used for
the summer clinic, provided the nucleus of the new service.
The community secured funds from government and
private sources and from benefits and business
contributions within Livingston. In July, 1970, the
Livingston Community Health Service opened its doors.

dollar.
Gibson sees community medicine, like that practiced in
Livingston, as the backbone of a solution to many of the
problems involved with providing health care to rural
communities. The advantages offered by community care
services over the established system in the United States are
numerous, he believes.
Because the community health center is locally owned
and controlled, there is a relatively high degree of contact
between the average citizen and the health organization.
Since a community center is responsible for all aspects of
its members health, it is an ideal way to practice preventive
medicine. The health center helps to integrate the
individual's interaction with his environment in terms of
road safety, school health, and industry.
Mutual Benefits
Stanford's relationship to the Livingston health center is
a mutually beneficial exchange, not simply dispensing
diagnosis and prescriptions. Stanford offers medical skills
and professionals, and Livingston offers a place for the
medical school to learn and apply community medicine.
The entire university benefits from the health center
because community health care involves fields other than
medicine, such as law and sociology - .
Medical school veterans of the Livingston experience
hold the opportunity in high esteem. Medical student
William Mitchell says, "1 can't express the warm feelings I
have for the place. It was by far the best experience of my
medical education."

COUNTRY CLINIC—Dr. Joe Neal examines a patient at the Livingston clinic, established by the medical school to improve
medical facilities in poor areas.
"You don't have to go to Vietnam, but to Merced
County .... to see that we have areas of real medical
poverty. The main thrust of medicine has been along basic
research lines to discover and develop new and better
techniques. There has been a certain amount of neglect for
people in the process," according to former Stanford
medical student Joe Neal.
Neal says this is one reason for the initiation of an
innovative health care program by Stanford medical
students and faculty in Livingston, an agricultural
community of 11,000 in the heart of Merced County.
Stanford became associated with the Livingston
community in the summer of 1969 when Stanford medical
students headed by Wells Shoemaker organized a clinic for
migrant farm workers. Through the summer the service was
open three evenings a week and treated 1000 patients. The
clinic used the facilities of Livingston's only doctor, Dr. J.
J. Wolohan, who was leaving to enter psychiatric training in
the fall of 1970.
As a result of the success of the program, Shoemaker
and Wolohan suggested that Stanford buy Wolohan's
offices and establish a health service. Dr. Count Gibson,
chairman of the Department of Community Health and
Preventive Medicine at Stanford, proposed that Livingston
establish a community owned health center with Stanford
advice.
Community Approves Center
Gibson and other Stanford doctors, notably Dr. William
Fowkes, continued their help and encouragement, and in
the fall of 1969 the Livingston citizenry heard a proposal
to develop a community controlled clinic in association
with Stanford. The people of Livingston approved the
proposal.
The newly-established Health Service proceeded to buy
Wolohan's offices and equipment. These facilities, used for
the summer clinic, provided the nucleus of the new service.
The community secured funds from government and
private sources and from benefits and business
contributions within Livingston. In July, 1970, the
Livingston Community Health Service opened its doors.
During the first summer there were some inconveniences
for both patient and doctor. The health center initially
encountered difficulty attaining its goal of 24-hour local
service because the center was staffed by commuting
Stanford medical students and doctors. In an emergency,
doctor and patient met halfway between Stanford and
Livingston.
These difficulties were eased when Dr. Everett Johnson,
an internist, received a Stanford Medical School Clinical
appointment and became director of the health center. To
augment the staff and services, the community board
authorized Johnson and Gibson to make the initial
selection of a full time pediatrician, who Gibson believes
will be named by January.

The second problem was not easily solved; when
Wolohan left Livingston, the people lost more than his
medical services. They lost a very personal friend. As a
result, there was a certain reluctance to accept the clinic as
Wolohan's replacement. But doctors and medical students
are overcoming this guardedness through caring for an
entire family with a "personal touch."
The Community Health Service and its relation to
Stanford is unique in many ways. Gibson comments, "It is
the kind of partnership (with a community) that university
medical centers have not thought of achieving in the past."
The Health Service may be of greater significance for the
Stanford School of Medicine than for the people of
Livingston.
Gibson explains that traditionally the emphasis in
medical education has been on "incubating" students in the
hospital, and on basic research. As a result, he says, "health
care has gone to hell," and the problems that have been
ignored for so long are "coming home to roost."
Gibson supports his statements by pointing to the wide
discrepancy between health care available to upper income
classes and to minority groups, and notes that national
health indicators, such as infant death rate, have slipped in
comparison to European nations. Health costs are high, he
says, and there is little effective return per health care
dollar.
