# Radiation Treatment
## 
### 
I am writing in response to the
article appearing in the Daily
which questioned the
establishment of a cancer center
at Stanford and specifically
questioned the provision of linear
accelerators. I do not wish to
comment on national priorities as
such; however, if cancer treatment
has some priority level, then my
perspective as a physicist, who has
worked almost two decades in
cancer therapy, tells me that
radiation treatments have
importance.
My observations suggest that
patient ages are widely distributed
although cancer has a connotation
of being a senile disease.
Furthermore, electron linear
accelerators, despite their high
initial cost, provide the precision
necessary to boost the clinician's
cure rate as well as the output
necessary to treat a growing
number who may benefit from
radiotherapy.
Moreover, such costs are not
out of line with those for
alternate equipments available for
radiotherapy: for example, high
quality cobalt treatment units. It
may be worth noting that a
proposal to extend our pilot
program supplying radiotherapy
physics services to outlying
communities under the Regional
Medical Program was endorsed at
all levels but failed due to a

I
cutback in federal funding for
such programs.
1 have recently examined some
of the economic aspects of
providing radiation therapy with
linear accelerators. Typically, the
linear accelerator per se accounts
for about a third of the
radiotherapy facility cost of an
installation which includes the
shielded treatment room and
directly supporting ancillary
facilities. One conclusion of the
study is that the high radiation
output of linear accelerators
facilitate the treatment of large
numbers of patients. Hence,
prorata facility costs decrease
although larger economies are
likely to ensue from the more
efficient utilization of personnel.
I share with many a concern
for our medical priorities as well
as alarm over the delivery system,
quality and cost of our health
care. My conclusion is that the use
of electron linear accelerators for
radiation is entirely consistent
with these concerns. However the
delivery of health care is
structured in the years which
follow, the use of linear
accelerators for cancer radiation
therapy would appear to be
recommended in the forseeable
future.
