Riietoric of Impartiality
Editor, THE DAILY:
The university has once again
disguised bureaucratic callousness
in the rhetoric of impartiality.
Thus, the Faculty Senate Steering
Committee's refusal not to
schedule registration or the first

two days of classes on the Jewish
High Holidays is anything but "a
concern for the basic principle of
University impartiality toward
sectarian groups," as Chairman
Bershader would have it. Quite
the contrary, the campus'
substantial Jewish community,
which includes a significant
number of faculty, finds itself the
only sectarian group with a major
holiday at the beginning of a
quarter, and thus alone is
penalized by this "impartiality."
No matter that the university
has a schedule of Jewish holidays
for the next 10 years, and thus
could easily rearrange its schedule.
No matter that Stanford is one of
the only major universities which
declines to rearrange its so-called
"fixed" calendar so as not to
coincide with the most important
and intense days of the so-called

"movable" Jewish calendar (a
calendar which, one might remind
Mr. Rosenzweig and others, was
"fixed" many millenia before
Stanford even came into
existence). No matter thit
facilities for Jewish services as
well as courses in Jewish culture,
are pitifully inadequate as it is.
The Faculty Steering Committee
shrugs its shoulders, mumbles its
platitudes about "impartiality,"
and calmly readministers the first
slap in the face.

Personal Attacks
Editor, THE DAILY:
I just read A 1 Kirkland's letter
in Monday's Daily. I think people
should know that Kirkland is
Assistant Dean of Engineering and
has hopes for promotion to Dean.
I hope in the future that all
candidates for Dean will wage
principled campaigns on this issue,
and refrain from personal attacks.
