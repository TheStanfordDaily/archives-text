# Popular Resistance In Ulster & Bengal
## News in Review 
### Bill Evers 
Ulster
The November 1971 issue of
the Chicago Journalism Review
contains an important article by
Sean Shesgreen, assistant
professor of English at North
Illinois University, on American
press coverage of the guerrilla war
in northern Ireland.
Dr. Shesgreen contends that
the U.S. news media are following
"the official British line," and he
cites several telling examples from
the American press.
He points out, for example,
that during "the same month that
the New York Times was
describing the Catholics as
'gunmen' and 'terrorists,' it was
dignifying . . . South Americans
engaged in similar struggles as
'rebels' and 'guerrillas'."
Dr. Shesgreen tells how
Protestant government officials
use the large and pervasive welfare
state apparatus (which is the
largest single employer in Ulster)
to benefit and employ fellow
Protestants. He describes how
"Catholics are forced to subsidize
fully by their taxes Protestant
education and to finance from
their pockets one-third of the cost
of their own education."
The article provides a good
capsule description of the IRA
Provisionals: "To defend

themselves from what were
literally massacres often led by
the partisan Ulster police force,
the Republican (Catholic)
population created the Provisional
or 'green' Irish Republican Army
(IRA), an organization committed
to defending by force Catholic
lives and property and committed
ultimately to reuniting Ireland.
"Th is nationalistic,

anti-communist but otherwise
unideological IRA stands in
contrast to the Regular or 'red'
IRA, a Marxist, less activist
organization from which the
Provisionals split in 1970."
A solution, based on libertarian
principles, to the problem of
northern Ireland, was advanced by
Murray Rothbard in the
Libertarian Forum of September
1, 1969:
"The Northern Irish rulers —
the Protestants — insist on their
present borders and institutions;

the Southern Irish or Catholics
demand a unitary state in Ireland.
Of the two, the Southern Irish
have the better case, for all of the
Protestants were 'planted'
centuries ago into Ireland by
English imperialism, at the
expense of murdering the Catholic
Irish and robbing their lands.
"But unless documentation
exists to enable restoration of the

land and property to the heirs of
the victims — and it is highly
dubious that such exists — the
proper libertarian solution has
been advanced by neither side
and, as far as we can tell by no
one in the public press.
"For the present partition line
does not, as most people believe,
divide the Catholic South from
the Protestant North.
"The partition, as imposed by
Britain after World War I and
accepted by the craven Irish rebel
leadership, arbitrarily handed a

great deal of Catholic territory to
the North.
"Specifically, over half of the
territory of Northern Ireland has a
majority of Catholics, and should
revert immediately to the South:
this includes Western Derry
(including Derry City), all of
Tyrone and Fermanagh, southern
Armagh, and southern Down.
"Essentially, this would leave
as Northern Ireland only the city
of Belfast and the rural areas
directly to the north."
In a recent issue of The New
Statesman, a British magazine,
Paul Johnson writes: "In Ireland
over the centuries, we have tried
every possible formula: direct
rule, indirect rule, genocide,
apartheid, puppet government,
real parliaments, martial law, civil
law, colonization, land reform,
partition. Nothing has worked.
The only solution we (British)
have not tried is absolute and
unconditional withdrawal."
Foreign Aid for Pakistan?
The November 21 issue of the
New York Times contains a story
which provides an interesting case
study of the evils inherent in the
U.S. foreign aid program.
The story begins: "Officials at
the Agency for International
Development are weighing a
multi-million-dollar program to

try to persuade East Pakistani
refugees in India to go back
voluntarily to East Pakistan in
return for housing and other
material benefits."
It turns out that U.S. AID
officials are contemplating turning
over somewhere between $70
million and $100 million to the
West Pakistani government of
Yahya Khan in order to induce
the Bengalis who have fled from
Yahya Khan's rule of military
terror to seek safety in India, to
now return to live under the
control of Yahya Khan and the
West Pakistani government.
In response to the proposed
plan, Sen. Edward Kennedy
(D—Mass.) said that he was
"distressed" to learn that the
Nixon administration was "still
trying to find ways of appeasing
the Pakistani military regime
through new schemes of foreign
aid under the guise of
humanitarian relief."
Representative Cornelius
Gallagher (D—N.Y.) asked in a
statement: "What did the more
than 10 million Bengalis flee
from? Based on the evidence of
the past month will Yahya ever
accept the refugees of the Hindu
faith who make up the
overwhelming majority of the
refugees? Could any amount of
money eliminate the memories
that caused some of them to walk
as far as 350 miles?"

great deal of Catholic territory to
the North.
"Specifically, over half of the
territory of Northern Ireland has a
majority of Catholics, and should
revert immediately to the South:
this includes Western Derry
(including Derry City), all of
Tyrone and Fermanagh, southern
Armagh, and southern Down.
"Essentially, this would leave
as Northern Ireland only the city

In a recent issue of The New

Paul Johnson writes: "In Ireland

Foreign Aid for Pakistan?
The November 21 issue of the
New York Times contains a story
which provides an interesting case
study of the evils inherent in the
U.S. foreign aid program.
The story begins: "Officials at
the Agency for International
Development are weighing a
multi-million-dollar program to

try to persuade East Pakistani
refugees in India to go back
voluntarily to East Pakistan in
return for housing and other
material benefits."
It turns out that U.S. AID
officials are contemplating turning
over somewhere between $70
million and $100 million to the
West Pakistani government of
Yahya Khan in order to induce
the Bengalis who have fled from
Yahya Khan's rule of military
terror to seek safety in India, to
now return to live under the
control of Yahya Khan and the
West Pakistani government.
In response to the proposed
plan, Sen. Edward Kennedy
(D—Mass.) said that he was
"distressed" to learn that the
Nixon administration was "still
trying to find ways of appeasing
the Pakistani military regime
through new schemes of foreign
aid under the guise of
humanitarian relief."
Representative Cornelius
Gallagher (D—N.Y.) asked in a
statement: "What did the more
than 10 million Bengalis flee
from? Based on the evidence of
the past month will Yahya ever
accept the refugees of the Hindu
faith who make up the
overwhelming majority of the
refugees? Could any amount of
money eliminate the memories
that caused some of them to walk
as far as 350 miles?"
Ulster
The November 1971 issue of
the Chicago Journalism Review
contains an important article by
Sean Shesgreen, assistant
professor of English at North
Illinois University, on American
press coverage of the guerrilla war
in northern Ireland.
Dr. Shesgreen contends that
the U.S. news media are following
"the official British line," and he
cites several telling examples from
the American press.
He points out, for example,
that during "the same month that
the New York Times was
describing the Catholics as
'gunmen' and 'terrorists,' it was
dignifying . . . South Americans
engaged in similar struggles as
'rebels' and 'guerrillas'."
Dr. Shesgreen tells how
Protestant government officials
use the large and pervasive welfare
state apparatus (which is the
largest single employer in Ulster)
to benefit and employ fellow
Protestants. He describes how
"Catholics are forced to subsidize
fully by their taxes Protestant
education and to finance from
their pockets one-third of the cost
of their own education."

Murray Rothbard in the
Libertarian Forum of September
1, 1969:
"The Northern Irish rulers —
the Protestants — insist on their
present borders and institutions;

the Southern Irish or Catholics
demand a unitary state in Ireland.
Of the two, the Southern Irish
have the better case, for all of the
Protestants were 'planted'
centuries ago into Ireland by
English imperialism, at the
expense of murdering the Catholic
Irish and robbing their lands.
"But unless documentation
exists to enable restoration of the

land and property to the heirs of
the victims — and it is highly
dubious that such exists — the
proper libertarian solution has
been advanced by neither side
and, as far as we can tell by no
one in the public press.
"For the present partition line
does not, as most people believe,
divide the Catholic South from
the Protestant North.
"The partition, as imposed by
Britain after World War I and
accepted by the craven Irish rebel
leadership, arbitrarily handed a

great deal of Catholic territory to
the North.
"Specifically, over half of the
territory of Northern Ireland has a
majority of Catholics, and should
revert immediately to the South:
this includes Western Derry
(including Derry City), all of
Tyrone and Fermanagh, southern
Armagh, and southern Down.
"Essentially, this would leave
as Northern Ireland only the city
of Belfast and the rural areas
directly to the north."
In a recent issue of The New
Statesman, a British magazine,
Paul Johnson writes: "In Ireland
over the centuries, we have tried
every possible formula: direct
rule, indirect rule, genocide,
apartheid, puppet government,
real parliaments, martial law, civil
law, colonization, land reform,
partition. Nothing has worked.
The only solution we (British)
have not tried is absolute and
unconditional withdrawal."
Foreign Aid for Pakistan?
The November 21 issue of the
New York Times contains a story
which provides an interesting case
study of the evils inherent in the
U.S. foreign aid program.
The story begins: "Officials at
the Agency for International
Development are weighing a
multi-million-dollar program to

try to persuade East Pakistani
refugees in India to go back
voluntarily to East Pakistan in
return for housing and other
material benefits."
It turns out that U.S. AID
officials are contemplating turning
over somewhere between $70
million and $100 million to the
West Pakistani government of
Yahya Khan in order to induce
the Bengalis who have fled from
Yahya Khan's rule of military
terror to seek safety in India, to
now return to live under the
control of Yahya Khan and the
West Pakistani government.
In response to the proposed
plan, Sen. Edward Kennedy
(D—Mass.) said that he was
"distressed" to learn that the
Nixon administration was "still
trying to find ways of appeasing
the Pakistani military regime
through new schemes of foreign
aid under the guise of
humanitarian relief."
Representative Cornelius
Gallagher (D—N.Y.) asked in a
statement: "What did the more
than 10 million Bengalis flee
from? Based on the evidence of
the past month will Yahya ever
accept the refugees of the Hindu
faith who make up the
overwhelming majority of the
refugees? Could any amount of
money eliminate the memories
that caused some of them to walk
as far as 350 miles?"
Ulster
The November 1971 issue of
the Chicago Journalism Review
contains an important article by
Sean Shesgreen, assistant
professor of English at North
Illinois University, on American
press coverage of the guerrilla war
in northern Ireland.
Dr. Shesgreen contends that
the U.S. news media are following
"the official British line," and he
cites several telling examples from
the American press.
He points out, for example,
that during "the same month that
the New York Times was
describing the Catholics as
'gunmen' and 'terrorists,' it was
dignifying . . . South Americans
engaged in similar struggles as
'rebels' and 'guerrillas'."
Dr. Shesgreen tells how
Protestant government officials
use the large and pervasive welfare
state apparatus (which is the
largest single employer in Ulster)
to benefit and employ fellow
Protestants. He describes how
"Catholics are forced to subsidize
fully by their taxes Protestant
education and to finance from
their pockets one-third of the cost
of their own education."
The article provides a good
capsule description of the IRA
Provisionals: "To defend

themselves from what were
literally massacres often led by
the partisan Ulster police force,
the Republican (Catholic)
population created the Provisional
or 'green' Irish Republican Army
(IRA), an organization committed
to defending by force Catholic
lives and property and committed
ultimately to reuniting Ireland.
"Th is nationalistic,

anti-communist but otherwise
unideological IRA stands in
contrast to the Regular or 'red'
IRA, a Marxist, less activist
organization from which the
Provisionals split in 1970."
