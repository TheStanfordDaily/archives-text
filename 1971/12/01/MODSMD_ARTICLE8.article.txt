# Dial Peace —Withhold War Tax
## 
### 
In the name of the American
people, our government has killed
over one million Asians and
devastated the entire life system
of the countries of Indochina —
and the war goes on. The bombing
of North and South Vietnam is
increasing faster under Nixon than

it did under Johnson. We are
developing sophisticated
electronic warfare techniques
which will allow us to kill and
destroy in Indochina using only
machines, technicians, and
government funds.
More than ever, then, it is not
only our men, but our tax money
that makes the killing in Asia
possible. One of our primary
concerns is the 10% Federal
phone tax, legislated in 1966
specifically to pay for the war. So
long as each of us pays this tax we
are contributing to the misery our
government is inflicting on the
Asian peoples. We thus urge all
members of the Stanford
community to resist the tax and
join the over 50,000 Americans
who are taking this step toward
peace.
To refuse to pay the tax, one
should deduct the 10%"US Tax,"
pay the remainder of the bill as
usual, and include a note to the
phone company explaining that
you cannot in good conscience
pay a tax levied to support the
war. It is important to continue

refusing month after month; only
through continuous resistance can
tax refusal have its maximum
impact.
There have been no instances
of indictment, imprisonment, or
discontinuation of phone services
for conscientious phone tax
refusal. Although the Internal
Revenue Service can attach your
salary or bank account, and
remove the tax money owed plus
6% interest, this happens
infrequently; it costs the IRS
more to track down resisters'
money than they recover in
unpaid taxes. Furthermore,
certain methods of payment, such
as paying with cash or a money
order, circumvent the danger to a
great extent. Because of the huge
and increasing number of phone
tax resisters, IRS has shifted to a
once per year collection system.
Don't be put off by threatening
letters: they are usually bluffing.
We feel that the negative act of
resisting the war tax must be
complemented by the positive
support of life-giving,
peace-directed programs. The

money we save by not paying the
tax, originally directed for the
waging of war, must be redirected
to the waging of peace.
To help redirect war taxes we
have set up a Peace Fund to
support organizations working
toward a peaceful world through
non-violent means. We will make
regular public accountings of how
the money is being distributed; no
tax money will go toward
expenses.
We hope all phone-owning
members of the Stanford
community will feel free to
contribute their telephone taxes
to the Peace Fund each month.
Our address is Peace Fund,
Columbae House, 517 Cowell
Lane, Stanford. If you cannot
spare the money but are resisting
the tax, please drop us a note each
month telling us the amount of
tax being withheld so we can
judge how many people in our
area are resisting and how much
money the Stanford community is
withholding from the war. We
welcome extra contributions to
the Fund, but please note the
exact amount of the tax in any
case.

that makes the killing in Asia
possible. One of our primary
concerns is the 10% Federal
phone tax, legislated in 1966
specifically to pay for the war. So
long as each of us pays this tax we
are contributing to the misery our
government is inflicting on the
Asian peoples. We thus urge all
members of the Stanford
community to resist the tax and
join the over 50,000 Americans
who are taking this step toward
peace.
To refuse to pay the tax, one
should deduct the 10%"US Tax,"
pay the remainder of the bill as
usual, and include a note to the
phone company explaining that
you cannot in good conscience
pay a tax levied to support the
war. It is important to continue

refusing month after month; only
through continuous resistance can
tax refusal have its maximum
impact.
There have been no instances
of indictment, imprisonment, or
discontinuation of phone services
for conscientious phone tax
refusal. Although the Internal
Revenue Service can attach your
salary or bank account, and
remove the tax money owed plus
6% interest, this happens
infrequently; it costs the IRS
more to track down resisters'
money than they recover in
unpaid taxes. Furthermore,
certain methods of payment, such
as paying with cash or a money
order, circumvent the danger to a
great extent. Because of the huge
and increasing number of phone
tax resisters, IRS has shifted to a
once per year collection system.
Don't be put off by threatening
letters: they are usually bluffing.
We feel that the negative act of
resisting the war tax must be
complemented by the positive
support of life-giving,
peace-directed programs. The

money we save by not paying the
tax, originally directed for the
waging of war, must be redirected
to the waging of peace.
To help redirect war taxes we
have set up a Peace Fund to
support organizations working
toward a peaceful world through
non-violent means. We will make
regular public accountings of how
the money is being distributed; no
tax money will go toward
expenses.
We hope all phone-owning
members of the Stanford
community will feel free to
contribute their telephone taxes
to the Peace Fund each month.
Our address is Peace Fund,
Columbae House, 517 Cowell
Lane, Stanford. If you cannot
spare the money but are resisting
the tax, please drop us a note each
month telling us the amount of
tax being withheld so we can
judge how many people in our
area are resisting and how much
money the Stanford community is
withholding from the war. We
welcome extra contributions to
the Fund, but please note the
exact amount of the tax in any
case.
If you have any questions, or
are interested in working with us,
please call or visit any of us at
Columbae House, 328-9555.

In the name of the American
people, our government has killed
over one million Asians and
devastated the entire life system
of the countries of Indochina —
and the war goes on. The bombing
of North and South Vietnam is
increasing faster under Nixon than

it did under Johnson. We are
developing sophisticated
electronic warfare techniques
which will allow us to kill and
destroy in Indochina using only
machines, technicians, and
government funds.
More than ever, then, it is not
only our men, but our tax money
that makes the killing in Asia
possible. One of our primary
