# SLAC Adds New Electron Device
## 
### GENE ROSENBERG 
At nearly two miles in length,
the Stanford linear accelerator is
the largest scientific instrument
ever built by man and his only
source of high-energy electrons
Recent developments at the
accelerator center (SLAC) include
the installation of an
electron-positron storage ring,
which will go into operation this
month, and plans for an electron
recirculator.
Today the accelerator basically
consists of a 10,000 foot copper
pipe along which 240 giant
klystron tubes are connected at
regular intervals. The copper pipe
itself is buried underneath 35 feet
of earth shielding, while the more
familiar housing that parallels it
above ground contains the
klystron tubes, utilities, and
control lines.
Construction of the linear

accelerator was completed in
mid-1966 at a cost of $114
million.
Electron Gun
Essentially, the machine
operates on the traveling-wave
principle in which the field moves
down the copper tube with the
particles in the form of an
electromagnetic wave.
Once introduced into the
apparatus by an electron "gun,"
the bunches of electrons are
accelerated by klystron-generated
radio waves fed into the pipe at
ten-foot intervals. The duration of
this power burst is only a few
millionths of a second, yet the
replacement rate of the klystron
tubes is approximately three per
day.
As the electrons ride the crest
of this traveling field and
approach the speed of light, they
gain in mass in accordance with

the theory of relativity. The beam
then leaves the accelerator proper
and passes into a type of
switchyard where large deflection
magnets can direct the beam to
any of several target buildings.
Independent Beam
This independent beam
targeting thus allows more than
one experiment to be conducted
at a time.
Other design advantages of the
Stanford device include the
relatively small energy loss by
virtue of its linear nature. Circular
accelerators are at an inherent
disadvantage since, when
high-speed electrons travel along a
curved path, they emit energy
which is lost in the form of
X-rays.
Moreover, the location of the
klystrons in the above-ground
housing permits the accelerator to
be serviced while it is in
operation.
Funding Cuts
Recent funding cut-backs of $2
million to the present level of
approximately $29 million per
year have forced a reduction in
the duty cycle, but during the
months that the accelerator is in
operation, it operates 24 hours a
day.
Besides the accelerator itself,
and the associated target and
office buildings, SLAC also
maintains complete
computational facilities and
photography labs. Frequently, the
labs are called upon to produce
thousands of photographs for
experiments that may last from
one day to nine months.
It often takes more time to set
up an experiment than to perform
it, since concrete shielding blocks
must frequently be stacked inside
the target building to thicknesses
exceeding 35 feet.
Electron Recirculator
According to Dr. Douglas
Dupen of SLAC, important new
developments in hardware may be
forthcoming. Just submitted to
the federal Atomic Energy
Commission for approval is a plan
to add a new electron recirculator
to the present two-mile long tube.
By permitting the electron
beam to run through the
accelerator twice, the beam
energy could be doubled to 50
billion electron volts (Bev).
Moreover, the recirculation
system would permit the

production of a steady stream of
electrons through selective
"peeling off" of the electron
pulses.
Another viable alternative for
increasing the beam energy would
be to increase the number of
klystrons from the present 240 to
480 or so in the first step.
However, no plans for this have
yet been proposed.
Storage Ring
Dr. Dupen is also hopeful for
new breakthroughs using a
specially-designed storage ring
(SPEAR), presently being
constructed on the SLAC site,
which will circulate electrons in
one direction and positrons
(positive electrons) in the other.
This arrangement increases the
effective energy of their collision
and eliminates the interference of

target nuclei which occurs when
electron or positron beams strike
material targets.
However, Dr. Dupen
emphasizes that "a
superconducting (resistanceless
flow of electrons through the tube
at very low temperatures)
accelerator is still a long way in
the future since the technology
for it is not yet far enough
advanced."
New Particles
The high energies (23 Bev)
developed by the present-day
accelerator are required to force
two particles to come very close
to each other. Such high-energy
particles have a greater ability to
probe the structure of matter and
to produce new elementary
particles besides the naturally
occurring proton, neutron, and
electron.
Observation in these cases is
usually rather complicated since
such new particles often have
evanescent existences of only a
few millionths of a second.
Past breakthroughs achieved
with the Stanford linear
accelerator include the discovery

of a previously unobserved
elementary particle, the
anti-omega-minus-bayon, which is
extremely difficult to produce
since it requires a beam of very
high intensity.
Spark Chamber
Pioneering work has also been
done at the center in the use of
the spark chamber, which is a
device that amplifies particle
tracks spanning the distance
between two widely separated
high-voltage plates with opposite
charges.
New types of rapid recycling
bubble chambers have also been
spin-offs of the requirements of
high-energy physics technology.
The accelerator is operated by
the university under the aegis of
the Atomic Energy Commission
which funds the center's research
program. A rotating committee of
high-energy physicists from
institutions all over the country
must approve prospective
experiments before they can be
performed using the accelerator's
high-energy electron beam.
Weird Experiments
A current sampling of some of
the experiments presently being
undertaken at SLAC includes
"Short-lived Sources of
Neutrino-like Particles," a "Study
of Electro-produced Hadrons
(photons)," or a "Bubble
Chamber Experiment with
Polarized, Laser-induced Photon
Beam."
However, possibly the most
important result of
experimentation in the field of
high-energy physics has been the
new questions that have been
raised in the wake of past
break-throughs.
The observation of the late Dr.
Leonard I. Schiff, head of the
university's faculty of physics at
the project's inception, still
remains valid today: "The physics
department believes that there is
no more challenging frontier of
the human mind at this time than
high-energy physics.
"Investigations in this field are
leading to the exploration of the
finest details of matter and
energy, not only of known types,
but including also the creation
and study of (completely) new
tvpes of matter and energy."
