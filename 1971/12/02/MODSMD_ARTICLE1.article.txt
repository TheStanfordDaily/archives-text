# Stolen Documents Chart Baran Affair In 1960's
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
Confidential administration
documents, apparently stolen from
sealed files in the University Archives,
have revealed the stormy Stanford
history of the late Paul Baran, a
world-renowned Marxist economist.
The letters and memos are filled
with alumni complaints and threats in
reaction to the socialist views of Baran,
who taught at Stanford from 1948
until his death in 1964.
Xerox copies of the documents,
mailed anonymously to local
newspapers, also document
administrators' careful attempts to
calm wealthy alumni. The officials
referred to Baran as a "thorn in the
side" of Stanford but said he could not
be fired because he was a tenured
professor and had broken no rules.
Baran's son Nick, a sophomore in
German, said he received the
documents several weeks ago in an
unmarked envelope.
The younger Baran said the
documents showed administrators
"acted in an unprincipled way." He
said they wrote "wishy-washy" letters
which did not clearly defend academic
freedom.
He compared pressures on Baran to
current dismissal charges against Maoist
Professor H. Bruce Franklin and said,
"Stanford's attack on undesirable
radicals is by no means a new one."
Letters From Officials
Administration documents in the
file include letters from
former-President Wallace Sterling,
presidential assistant Frederic Glover,
and former-Provost Frederick Terman.
Glover and other officials who could be
contacted verified letters attributed to
them in the file, although they
denounced the theft as immoral and an
abuse of private correspondence.
Chief Librarian Ralph Hansen said a
check yesterday revealed that a file on
Baran was missing from a locked room
in the Archives. He said the file was
probably taken at least several months
ago.
Glover said that the letters he wrote
were written when "things were

different." He added that the file
included letters written "to personal
friends without expecting to have to
justify the personal views."
According to the documents, Glover
predicted problems with Baran as early
as 1954. He sent Sterling a copy of a
petition which Baran signed in support
of a radical school then facing
McCarthy-era investigations. Glover's
note to "Wally" warned that "Baran,
being in the Econ Dept., may give us
real trouble one day."
The real trouble began in 1960,
when Baran visited Cuba and spoke
glowingly of Fidel Castro's new regime.
There were additional flare-ups of
alumni anger when Baran denounced
the US' Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961
and the US blockade of Cuba during
the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962.
'Pressure Hurts Health'
The attacks did not end until Baran
died after suffering his second heart
attack in 1964. His son charged that
"the University's pressure was one of
the main reasons for his poor health."
Reaction to Baran's support of
Castro in 1961 included a letter to the
editor of the Daily which former
Trustee David Packard wrote but never
sent to the newspaper. Packard, who is
now Deputy Secretary of Defense, said
that Baran and visiting colleague Paul
Sweezy were "avowed Marxists" who
had violated the principle that "a
professor should be a teacher, not an
advocate."
Packard wrote that Trustees should
reduce the salaries of Baran and Sweezy
"proportionate to the amount which
can be clearly identified as having come
from sources other than Capitalism
which they wish to destroy."
He added that "we would be
delighted" to see the two professors go

back to Cuba. He joked that they later
could be bought back in exchange for a
"couple of Sunday Gardener's
rototillers."
Glover sent Sterling a copy of
Packard's abortive letter to the editor,
with a note saying, "I'm sure glad he
didn't send it." He said the letter
contained several paragraphs which
"would have blown the place wide
open."
(Packard was at the White House
yesterday and could not be reached for
comment.)
More Alumni Complaints
Other influential alumni also
complained. Sterling heard from a
recently-retired Texaco Oil executive,
who emphasized a $10,000 gift to
Stanford from Texaco the year before.
He commented that Baran's
"unqualified approval" of Castro
seemed to endorse the Cuban seizure of
Texaco's refineries there.
A response by University Relations
official Donald Carlson told the
executive that Baran was "a
distinguished scholar" but that "neither
the University nor President Sterling
endorse Professor Baran's views, of
course."
Carlson's letter said that
"Communists are not permitted to hold
positions on the Stanford faculty."
He said that Baran was a socialist
but not a Communist.
Carlson commented yesterday that
such comments must be "put in the
context of the '60s. This was the Birch
time.
"We wrote letters about Paul Baran
for a long time—protecting him, of
course, more than anything."
'Personal Weariness'
In June, 1963, Sterling wrote that


CUBA, 1960—The late Paul Baran (second from left), a Marxist economist here through the early '60's, met Premier Fidel
Castro in Cuba along with Paul Sweezy (left) with whom he wrote the book Monopoly Capital, and Leo Huberman (right)
editor of Monthly Review.
Baran continued to "do a good job of
classroom teaching," the "critical" area
in tenure questions. But expressing his
personal weariness with Baran, Sterling
said he wished that Baran and a
supporter "would stick to their
academic knitting, and stay out of
peripheral—and newsworthy—activities,
legal as these may be."
(Sterling, who is currently
recuperating from an illness, could not
be reached for comment.)
Administrators repeatedly assured
alumni that Baran only taught
advanced-level courses. In Sterling's
words, "Baran is not reaching many
students."
A Glover letter in March, 1963,
emphasized, "Baran has tenure. To fire
him, we would have to have a reason
which would stand up in court. And we
don't have any such reason."
In the letter, Glover defended
Baran's classroom performance as
"provocative and interesting." He
added that other professors did not
agree with his views "and the students
who do could meet in a phone booth."
Glover added parenthetically, "And
they would probably get the wrong
number!"
Lunch Meeting
When the criticism was booming,
Sterling invited eight influential
executives to a luncheon about the
Baran affair at San Francisco's
exclusive Pacific-Union Club.
Warm thank-you notes from guests
indicated Sterling's success in placating
the worried alumni.
Many of the complaints concerning
Baran came from conservative alumni
in the Los Angeles area. In March,
1963, a Los Angeles judge wrote

Sterling that the issue was worrying
potential contributors to the massive
"PACE" fund-raising drive.
Baran had charged that his salary
was "frozen" by the University to
pressure him into resigning. The
alumnus-judge, apparently agreeing
with that analysis, suggested that
Sterling send him Baran's salary and
other information that would show
Stanford "is doing all that it can to
discourage him from remaining with
the University."
However, Sterling refused to give
such confidential information to
fund-raisers.
The LA judge also warned Sterling
that a friend had threatened to cut off
his gifts because of Baran. He added
that the angry man's will "provides that
something in the neighborhood of a
million dollars will go to Stanford upon
his death."
The alumni complaints continued
even after Baran's death. A Bakersfield
businessman wrote to denounce a
memorial tribute on campus. Glover,
who yesterday said he helped plan the
service, responded that "it is difficult as
a practical matter to tell a dead man's
friends that they cannot mourn him as
they see fit."
Although the administration letters
first became public this week, Baran
knew of and criticized them when the
conflict first began.
In a 1961 letter to Sweezy, he said
that a friend had called the "standard"
administration letter "despicable."
Baran wrote, "It did not point out that
the University was committed to the
principle of academic freedom or
anything of the sort, but stressed its
having the very difficult problem of my
having tenure."
