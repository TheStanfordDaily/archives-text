# Americans Ignore Turkish Oppression
## 
### 
It is rather strange that the
events in Turkey do not cause as
much public concern in the U.S.
as do the events in the other
undeveloped countries of the
world. The people on this
historical bridge tying Europe and
Asia have been in an anachronistic
development over the centuries
and since the 1930's have, with
the influence of the United States'
capitalism, become the toilers of
the new-colonialism.
During the last two years 23
students have been killed in the
streets and almost none of the
murderers have been found. The
growing working-class movement
and its mounting dissatisfaction
with its conditions have thrown
the Turkish bourgeoisie into crisis.
1970-71 has been a complete
chaos. The government has
resigned in the face of a military
memorandum, martial law,
renewed regularly every two
months, was imposed over 11 of
the most important provinces,
military courts have been formed,
and the sole socialist party, Labor
Party of Turkey, has been closed.
The new regime announced
that the 1961 Constitution was a
luxury for Turkey, and promptly
changed 40 articles relating to
civil liberties. Freedoms of press
and speech have been suppressed.

The chairman of the Turkish
Radio and Television Service has
been dismissed and replaced by a
reactionary army General.
The universities have been
cleaned of dissenting voices.
Thousands of Turkish workers,
intellectuals, students, teachers
have been jailed, many tortured
with truly medieval ferocity
because of their leftist leanings.
During the last month 18 of those
have been sentenced by the
military courts to be hung. Today
while 18 young people are
awaiting affirmation of their
death sentences thousands* of
workers and intellectuals are in
prisons with an unknown future.
This is the situation of a
country which for the last 50
years has been trying to develop
in the capitalist way, and which is
the loyal guard of NATO and
CENTO and a military outpost of
the U.S. against the Soviet Union
(that U.S. which protects Turkey
from the "communist peril.")
This is the situation of a
country which is now practically a
U.S. base with its modern
weapons, soldiers, U-2's and
Coca-Cola's, protecting the
interests of the U.S. in the Middle
East. . . .

It is rather strange that the
events in Turkey do not cause as
much public concern in the U.S.
as do the events in the other
undeveloped countries of the
world. The people on this
historical bridge tying Europe and
Asia have been in an anachronistic
development over the centuries
and since the 1930's have, with
the influence of the United States'
capitalism, become the toilers of
the new-colonialism.
During the last two years 23
students have been killed in the
streets and almost none of the
murderers have been found. The
growing working-class movement
and its mounting dissatisfaction
with its conditions have thrown
the Turkish bourgeoisie into crisis.
1970-71 has been a complete
chaos. The government has
resigned in the face of a military
memorandum, martial law,
renewed regularly every two
months, was imposed over 11 of
the most important provinces,
military courts have been formed,
and the sole socialist party, Labor
Party of Turkey, has been closed.
The new regime announced
that the 1961 Constitution was a
luxury for Turkey, and promptly
changed 40 articles relating to
civil liberties. Freedoms of press
and speech have been suppressed.

The chairman of the Turkish
Radio and Television Service has
been dismissed and replaced by a
reactionary army General.
The universities have been
cleaned of dissenting voices.
Thousands of Turkish workers,
intellectuals, students, teachers
have been jailed, many tortured
with truly medieval ferocity
because of their leftist leanings.
During the last month 18 of those
have been sentenced by the
military courts to be hung. Today
while 18 young people are
awaiting affirmation of their
death sentences thousands* of
workers and intellectuals are in
prisons with an unknown future.
This is the situation of a
country which for the last 50
years has been trying to develop
in the capitalist way, and which is
the loyal guard of NATO and
CENTO and a military outpost of
the U.S. against the Soviet Union
(that U.S. which protects Turkey
from the "communist peril.")
This is the situation of a
country which is now practically a
U.S. base with its modern
weapons, soldiers, U-2's and
Coca-Cola's, protecting the
interests of the U.S. in the Middle
East. . . .
