## Politicization Of The I-Center 
### 
On November 23, 1971 the
Beehtel International Center
convened a Town Hall Meeting to
discuss the possibilities of a
Council that would work with the
Center in all of its programs and
services. Unfortunately the vast
majority of people who usually
use the services of the Center were
not present at this meeting due to
inadequate publicity before the
meeting.
At this meeting a group of
people who identified themselves
as the Third World Liberation
Front, a political party in the Bay
Area, claimed that they
represented the people of the
Third World and, because of this
fact, demanded participation in
the reorganization of the
International Center.
During the meeting the Third
World Liberation Front made a
proposal with a series of
amendments to have control of
the activities held in the Center.
Further towards the end of the
meeting the audience was pushed
to vote on a series of confusing
proposals that were passed
through the majority held by the
Third World Liberation Front.
The result of this meeting was the
establishment of a working
committee with the following
membership:
2 members from the Staff of
the International Center
2 members from the
International Association
1 member from the
International Dames
1 member from the
Community Committee for
International students
1 representative from the Dean
of Graduate Students
2 students at large, elected
from those present at the Town
Hall Meeting
2 members from the Third
World Liberation Front.
This working committee will

make proposals for the
establishment of a Board of
Directors for the International
Center, its membership and their
appointment to the board and will
define its functions and
responsibilities.
We, the undersigned,
concemed foreign students, want
to question publicly the legality
of the results of this meeting on
the following grounds:
(a) The participation of a
political party in the organization
of any University service should
be against the by-laws of Stanford
University.
(b) Several votings took place
in this Town Hall Meeting and this
fact was not publicly announced
in advance. Students were
unaware that any type of election
would have been held at this
meeting, and hence many of them
did not attend.
Furthermore considering the
apolitical nature of the Beehtel
International Center we feel that
the presence of any political party
in the administration of the
Center would alienate people who
participate in its activities. Given

the ideology of the Third World
Liberation Front, as expressed by
its members who attended the
meeting, the presence of this
group would inhibit the full
utilization of the facilities of the
Center by other groups who do
not share the same ideology as
they.
We would like to make it
perfectly clear that we are not
opposed to the idea of a council
as such but that our opposition
likes in the fact that no political
organization, regardless of its
ideology, should have a voice in
the administration of anv

Stanford University facility.
We urge the members of the
Stanford community to help
preserve the integrity of the
International Center by taking
active steps to express their
opposition to the participation of
this political party in the
decision-making processes of the
International Center.
