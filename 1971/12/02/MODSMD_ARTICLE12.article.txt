# Studying Asian Studies
## 
### 
Since fall 1969, a
subcommittee of the Columbia
University CCAS has been
researching the institutional
structure of the Asian studies
field, with special reference to the
development of Chinese studies in
the U.S. since 1959. Our first
findings, under the title Report on
an Investigation of the American
Asian Studies Establishment, were
presented at the 1970 CCAS
National Convention. Research
continued the following year and
led to an invitation to participate
in the 1971 AAS Presidential
Panel Impact of American
Organizations on Asian Studies.
Beginning with the exposure
of Project Camelot in 1965, there
has been a series of revelations,
largely through Congressional
hearings, concerning the
involvement of academic
personnel and institutions in
government foreign areas research
projects. These involvements have
been highly political, in some
cases supportive of military
operations, and thus incompatible
with the traditional scholarly
vocation.
Within the academic
community during this time,
much critical study has been
devoted to assessing the
implications of government
academic relations and to
re-defining the role of the scholar.
The dominant organization in
the field of Chinese studies is a
national committee called the
Joint Committee on
Contemporary China IJCCC]. It
was created at the Gould House
Conference of 1959 and is
sponsored by the Social Science
Research Council and the
American Council of Learned
Societies [SSRC/ACLS] with
Ford Foundation funds.
The JCCC exerts enormous
influence through its power to
convene prestigious conferences
which establish directions and
indicate opportunities for research
in the field. The JCCC has
convened inaugural research
conferences on the economy of
China, Chinese sociology and
anthropology, Chinese Law, and
the government and politics of
China. Each conference resulted
in the formation of a JCCC
satellite committee to
institutionalize research.
The members of the JCCC and
the satellite committees are
professors appointed through the

SSRC; they hold concurrently
executive positions in the centers
and institutes of Chinese studies
funded by Ford at Harvard,
Columbia, Berkeley, Seattle, and
Michigan.
Thus the JCCC concentrates
within itself both local and
national leadership over an
establishment that has received
nearly $30 million in primary
funds from Ford since 1959. Yet
the appointments and operations
of the JCCC are subject to no
critical review by the profession.
Indeed, the JCCC has rejected the
most modest and reasonable
requests that it be more open
about its deliberations.
Our concern has been directed,
however, not only to the exclusive
and elitist character of this SSRC
Committee but also to the
prominence within the SSRC and
the Ford Foundation of academic
administrators oriented more to
questions of policy and even
intelligence than to academic
scholarship. This observation
made an inquiry seem all the more
imperative.
The AAS membership
recognized the general concern of
these matters when, at the 1971
Business Meeting, it passed a
motion instructing the Board of
Directors to consider constituting
a joint CCAS-AAS Committee
mandated to investigate the JCCC,
the SSRC, and the Ford
Foundation with reference to the
problem of government-academic
liaison.
The immediate problems
concerning the organization of the
field: (1) freedom from improper

influence of governmental or
private administration agencies,
and (2) freedom to conduct the
research necessary for an
independent, critical study of the
evolution of Asian studies in the
U.S., including freedom of access
to all pertinent documentation.
Unfortunately, the prospects
for a careful inquiry into these
questions by the AAS-CCAS panel
have been dimming, as the issues
raised by CCAS are obscured by
an increasingly vitriolic attack by
some of the big guns in the field.
Most prominent among these is
John King Fairbank, Professor of
History at Harvard. He has
accused the Columbia Report of
elaborating a "conspiracy
theory," that it presupposes an
"evil" Government, that it is an
exercise in Left "McCarthyism,"
that CCAS is as closed an elitist as
the JCCC, and that both, being
"private," are immune from
accountability; that "values" may
be profitably debated but not
organization, and finally that the
costs and effort the inquiry would
require make it impractical.
Only time — and a great deal of
struggle — will tell how successful
CCAS can be in calling the Asian
studies field to account. But it is
important that students and
teachers everywhere — including
Stanford, where there is a large
Asian studies program — realize
that government funds, and funds
directed to governmental purposes,
can pollute "pure research" in the
humanities quite as effectively as
they can in the sciences.

Foundation with reference to the
problem of government-academic
liaison.
The immediate problems
concerning the organization of the
field: (1) freedom from improper

influence of governmental or
private administration agencies,
and (2) freedom to conduct the
research necessary for an
independent, critical study of the
evolution of Asian studies in the
U.S., including freedom of access
to all pertinent documentation.
Unfortunately, the prospects
for a careful inquiry into these
questions by the AAS-CCAS panel
have been dimming, as the issues
raised by CCAS are obscured by
an increasingly vitriolic attack by
some of the big guns in the field.
Most prominent among these is
John King Fairbank, Professor of
History at Harvard. He has
accused the Columbia Report of
elaborating a "conspiracy
theory," that it presupposes an
"evil" Government, that it is an
exercise in Left "McCarthyism,"
that CCAS is as closed an elitist as
the JCCC, and that both, being
"private," are immune from
accountability; that "values" may
be profitably debated but not
organization, and finally that the
costs and effort the inquiry would
require make it impractical.
Only time — and a great deal of
struggle — will tell how successful
CCAS can be in calling the Asian
studies field to account. But it is
important that students and
teachers everywhere — including
Stanford, where there is a large
Asian studies program — realize
that government funds, and funds
directed to governmental purposes,
can pollute "pure research" in the
humanities quite as effectively as
they can in the sciences.
(Moss Roberts for Concerned
Asian Scholars.)
Since fall 1969, a
subcommittee of the Columbia
University CCAS has been
researching the institutional
structure of the Asian studies
field, with special reference to the
development of Chinese studies in
the U.S. since 1959. Our first
findings, under the title Report on
an Investigation of the American
Asian Studies Establishment, were
presented at the 1970 CCAS
National Convention. Research
continued the following year and
led to an invitation to participate
in the 1971 AAS Presidential
Panel Impact of American
Organizations on Asian Studies.
Beginning with the exposure
of Project Camelot in 1965, there
has been a series of revelations,
largely through Congressional
hearings, concerning the
involvement of academic
personnel and institutions in
government foreign areas research
projects. These involvements have
been highly political, in some
cases supportive of military
operations, and thus incompatible
with the traditional scholarly
vocation.
Within the academic
community during this time,
much critical study has been
devoted to assessing the
implications of government
academic relations and to
re-defining the role of the scholar.
The dominant organization in
the field of Chinese studies is a
national committee called the
Joint Committee on
Contemporary China IJCCC]. It
was created at the Gould House
Conference of 1959 and is
sponsored by the Social Science
Research Council and the
American Council of Learned
Societies [SSRC/ACLS] with
Ford Foundation funds.
The JCCC exerts enormous
influence through its power to
convene prestigious conferences
which establish directions and
indicate opportunities for research
in the field. The JCCC has
convened inaugural research
conferences on the economy of
China, Chinese sociology and
anthropology, Chinese Law, and
the government and politics of
China. Each conference resulted
in the formation of a JCCC
satellite committee to
institutionalize research.
The members of the JCCC and
the satellite committees are
professors appointed through the

SSRC; they hold concurrently
executive positions in the centers
and institutes of Chinese studies
funded by Ford at Harvard,
Columbia, Berkeley, Seattle, and
Michigan.
Thus the JCCC concentrates
within itself both local and
national leadership over an
establishment that has received
nearly $30 million in primary
funds from Ford since 1959. Yet
the appointments and operations
of the JCCC are subject to no
critical review by the profession.
Indeed, the JCCC has rejected the
most modest and reasonable
requests that it be more open
about its deliberations.
Our concern has been directed,
however, not only to the exclusive
and elitist character of this SSRC
Committee but also to the
prominence within the SSRC and
the Ford Foundation of academic
administrators oriented more to
questions of policy and even
intelligence than to academic
scholarship. This observation
made an inquiry seem all the more
imperative.
The AAS membership
recognized the general concern of
these matters when, at the 1971
Business Meeting, it passed a
motion instructing the Board of
Directors to consider constituting
a joint CCAS-AAS Committee
mandated to investigate the JCCC,
the SSRC, and the Ford
Foundation with reference to the
problem of government-academic
liaison.

influence through its power to
convene prestigious conferences
which establish directions and
indicate opportunities for research
in the field. The JCCC has
convened inaugural research
conferences on the economy of
China, Chinese sociology and
anthropology, Chinese Law, and
the government and politics of
China. Each conference resulted
in the formation of a JCCC
satellite committee to
institutionalize research.
The members of the JCCC and
the satellite committees are
professors appointed through the

SSRC; they hold concurrently
executive positions in the centers
and institutes of Chinese studies
funded by Ford at Harvard,
Columbia, Berkeley, Seattle, and
Michigan.
Thus the JCCC concentrates
within itself both local and
national leadership over an
establishment that has received
nearly $30 million in primary
funds from Ford since 1959. Yet
the appointments and operations
of the JCCC are subject to no
critical review by the profession.
Indeed, the JCCC has rejected the
most modest and reasonable
requests that it be more open
about its deliberations.
Our concern has been directed,
however, not only to the exclusive
and elitist character of this SSRC
Committee but also to the
prominence within the SSRC and
the Ford Foundation of academic
administrators oriented more to
questions of policy and even
intelligence than to academic
scholarship. This observation
made an inquiry seem all the more
imperative.
The AAS membership
recognized the general concern of
these matters when, at the 1971
Business Meeting, it passed a
motion instructing the Board of
Directors to consider constituting
a joint CCAS-AAS Committee
mandated to investigate the JCCC,
the SSRC, and the Ford
Foundation with reference to the
problem of government-academic
liaison.
The immediate problems
concerning the organization of the
field: (1) freedom from improper

influence of governmental or
private administration agencies,
and (2) freedom to conduct the
research necessary for an
independent, critical study of the
evolution of Asian studies in the
U.S., including freedom of access
to all pertinent documentation.
Unfortunately, the prospects
for a careful inquiry into these
questions by the AAS-CCAS panel
have been dimming, as the issues
raised by CCAS are obscured by
an increasingly vitriolic attack by
some of the big guns in the field.
Most prominent among these is
John King Fairbank, Professor of
History at Harvard. He has
accused the Columbia Report of
elaborating a "conspiracy
theory," that it presupposes an
"evil" Government, that it is an
exercise in Left "McCarthyism,"
that CCAS is as closed an elitist as
the JCCC, and that both, being
"private," are immune from
accountability; that "values" may
be profitably debated but not
organization, and finally that the
costs and effort the inquiry would
require make it impractical.
Only time — and a great deal of
struggle — will tell how successful
CCAS can be in calling the Asian
studies field to account. But it is
important that students and
teachers everywhere — including
Stanford, where there is a large
Asian studies program — realize
that government funds, and funds
directed to governmental purposes,
can pollute "pure research" in the
humanities quite as effectively as
they can in the sciences.
