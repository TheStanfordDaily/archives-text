# sit-in commendable action
## Dolly Case Final Arguments 
### 
The following are excerpts from
the summary of John Dolly's
defense presented to his grievance
committee before their decision.
The defense was based primarily
on the political aspects of the
sit-in, i.e., we argued that the
sit-in was justified and it was
acceptable, and commendable for
workers to participate in the
sit-in.
I. We intended to show the
following:
1) That the demands made at
the med center sit-in were
reasonable, and were the result of
longstanding grievances arising
from the deeply entrenched
racism and absence of workers
rights.
2) That no alternate channels
of redress were available.
3) That the sit-in was a valid
labor negotiation which the
hospital implicity recognized as
such (until it unilaterally broke
off negotiations).
Witnesses corroborated that:
1) The med center in spite of
its lipservice to equalitarianism in
many wajs remains a racist
institution.
2) Stanford workers have
virtually no rights, and no
protection, other than unity and
direct action, against unfair firings
or bad working conditions or low

pay
-3) Formal channels, internal
or external, such as grievance
procedures, affirmative action
programs, courts, civil rights
organizations, NLRB boards,
administration minority
"representatives" look good on
paper, but realistically haven't
worked or aren't available.
We maintain that the causes of
the sit-in, and the means available
to those who acted to help
Bridges are of primary
importance.
We must view (what the
administration calls)
"unacceptable behavior" in terms
of the consequences of taking no
action or once more trying to use
"channels" we know to be
ineffective.
We intended to show, in the
next sessions that
1) The sit-in was essentially
non-disruptive
2) That negotiations were:
a) temporarily stalled Friday
noon when (Hospital Director)
Gonda went back on his word
about accepting the BAC (Black
Advisory Council) decision (that
Sam should be rehired.)
b) That his lack of authority

Friday noon represented a
"takeover" of authority by the
hard line Lyman regime, and a
"military" response at,that point
was inevitable.
c) That those negotiating
modified their demands from
rehiring Sam, to giving him a
grievance with a chairman,
acceptable to both sides. This
change in position was reflected
by Miller's own statement
breaking negotiations off.
d) That negotiators were
repeatedly told that police would
not be called if the sit-in remained
orderly, and while ostensibly
negotiating in good faith the
administration had made
substantial plans to call in the
police.
e) That negotiations were
unilaterally called off by the
University administration in spite
of substantial spirit of
compromise on the part of those
negotiating.
We maintain that:
The administration while
paying lipservice to nonexistent or
ineffective "channels" has proven
unresponsive to the needs of
workers and students.
The Lyman administration's
unresponsiveness makes

confrontation necessary for
change, and inevitable as long as
people have grievances and
consciences.
The Lyman administration's
response to peaceful
confrontation over redress of
grievances has systematically been
the military one.
We maintain that the only way
workers at Stanford can fight
racism, fascism and win
elementary rights for all workers
is if they act with unity and are
willing to struggle for these ends.
The evidence is persuasive that
the situation (at the sit-in) did not
leave John much choice. The
irrationality of the
administration's decision, the
known brutality of the riot police
made self-defense John's primary
concern. Without Jean, in view of
his support of and unity with the
sit-in, he probably would have
stayed, but that is in the realm of
the hypothetical. At that time,
Friday evening his primary
concern was to get Jean out. And
there was no way out.
