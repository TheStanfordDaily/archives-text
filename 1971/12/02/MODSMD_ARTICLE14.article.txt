# 'Marxist Christian'
## Hardegree Drives Bus, Leads Seminar 
### CHARLES FIELD, Jr 
Rev. Joseph Hardegree, a
self-acknowledged
"Marxist-Christian" minister who
lost his Stanford job last spring, is
now combining scattered hours as
a schoolbus driver with a tentative
"People's Ministry" at Stanford
and in Palo Alto.
However, making seven runs a
day driving a schoolbus
"fragments my time and cuts out
any noontime political activity I
might do at Stanford," says
Hardegree. He adds that "the job
is hard on people's nerves, not
well-paying, and involves a lot of
responsibility."
"It's like truckdriving, with
sixty kids breathing down your
neck," Hardegree explains. "I
don't really dig other peoples'
kids; I'm an adult chauvinist. But
you have to put up with things
you don't like in any job," he
concludes.
When his United Campus
Christian Ministries (UCCM) pay
stopped last June, Hardegree
found work as a bottling plant
employee for Hueblein, Inc. in
Menlo Park, on thirty-day
temporary status. Sweeping up
broken cases of liquor from the
assembly line and loading boxes
into trucks "quickly disabused me
of any romantic notions about
proletarian labor. Everyone works
their ass to the bone trying to get
hired on permanently. Among
young workers I saw a real
ripeness for some kind of radical

change.
"Actually the most difficult
adjustment was that I had to cut
off my hair and beard," adds
Hardegree, whose appearance
remains shorn.

Hardegree was dismissed last
May by the Stanford board of
UCCM which in Northern
California sponsors some twenty
campus ministers. The Stanford
board claimed lack of funds

sufficient to sponsor both
Hardegree and R. Richard Roe,
who remains as Stanford's only
UCCM minister. Hardegree
charged that he was being fired
for his Marxist political outlook

and support of radical
worker-student movements.
His present "People's Ministry"
is funded "for October, probably
for November, no telling what
after that" at half his former
salary by sponsors independent of
UCCM. Denied the use of UCCM's
Clubhouse offices, Hardegree is
working for the moment "out of a
briefcase and a post office box"
to meet with students, he says.
Hardegree also heads a
Marxist-Christian dialogue seminar
and attends the Sunday Morning
Worship Service in Memorial
Church's Round Room as part of
his ministry to students. He
performed both services last year.
Of the Worship Service, he says,
"I tend to read as much from Mao
as I do from the Bible, but it's still
a Christian service."
As in the past, Hardegree says
he is "much more interested in
introducing Christians to Marxism
than vice-versa."
A Venceremos member last
year, Hardegree left the
organization over the summer and
is presently not affiliated with any
group. "I feel uncomfortable not
being in a revolutionary
organization," he says.
Although he feels that
Venceremos is still "an effective
revolutionary group," Hardegree
adds, "I think they wanted to
define too narrowly what
'revolutionary' meant, while the
Black Panther Party was
broadening into issues other than
'Off the pig."
"They made the Panther issue
a line of demarcation: either you
were against the Panthers or out
of Venceremos. I got out of
Venceremos," he explains.

change.
"Actually the most difficult
adjustment was that I had to cut
off my hair and beard," adds
Hardegree, whose appearance
remains shorn.

Hardegree was dismissed last
May by the Stanford board of
UCCM which in Northern
California sponsors some twenty
campus ministers. The Stanford
board claimed lack of funds

sufficient to sponsor both
Hardegree and R. Richard Roe,
who remains as Stanford's only
UCCM minister. Hardegree
charged that he was being fired
for his Marxist political outlook

and support of radical
worker-student movements.
His present "People's Ministry"
is funded "for October, probably
for November, no telling what
after that" at half his former
salary by sponsors independent of
UCCM. Denied the use of UCCM's
Clubhouse offices, Hardegree is
working for the moment "out of a
briefcase and a post office box"
to meet with students, he says.
Hardegree also heads a
Marxist-Christian dialogue seminar
and attends the Sunday Morning
Worship Service in Memorial
Church's Round Room as part of
his ministry to students. He
performed both services last year.
Of the Worship Service, he says,
"I tend to read as much from Mao
as I do from the Bible, but it's still
a Christian service."
As in the past, Hardegree says
he is "much more interested in
introducing Christians to Marxism
than vice-versa."
A Venceremos member last
year, Hardegree left the
organization over the summer and
is presently not affiliated with any
group. "I feel uncomfortable not
being in a revolutionary
organization," he says.
Although he feels that
Venceremos is still "an effective
revolutionary group," Hardegree
adds, "I think they wanted to
define too narrowly what
'revolutionary' meant, while the
Black Panther Party was
broadening into issues other than
'Off the pig."
"They made the Panther issue
a line of demarcation: either you
were against the Panthers or out
of Venceremos. I got out of
Venceremos," he explains.

BUSING THE MASSES—Rev. Joe Hardegree, self-proclaimed "adult-chauvinist" and Marxist-Christian,
checks up on the kiddies in his new job as a school bus driver. He has tried to combine proletarian labor
with his "People's Ministry," since being dismissed by the United Campus Christian Ministries here last
June.
Rev. Joseph Hardegree, a
self-acknowledged
"Marxist-Christian" minister who
lost his Stanford job last spring, is
now combining scattered hours as
a schoolbus driver with a tentative
"People's Ministry" at Stanford
and in Palo Alto.
However, making seven runs a
day driving a schoolbus
"fragments my time and cuts out
any noontime political activity I
might do at Stanford," says
Hardegree. He adds that "the job
is hard on people's nerves, not
well-paying, and involves a lot of
responsibility."
"It's like truckdriving, with
sixty kids breathing down your
neck," Hardegree explains. "I
don't really dig other peoples'
kids; I'm an adult chauvinist. But
you have to put up with things
you don't like in any job," he
concludes.
When his United Campus
Christian Ministries (UCCM) pay
stopped last June, Hardegree
found work as a bottling plant
employee for Hueblein, Inc. in
Menlo Park, on thirty-day
temporary status. Sweeping up
broken cases of liquor from the
assembly line and loading boxes
into trucks "quickly disabused me
of any romantic notions about
proletarian labor. Everyone works
their ass to the bone trying to get
hired on permanently. Among
young workers I saw a real
ripeness for some kind of radical

change.
