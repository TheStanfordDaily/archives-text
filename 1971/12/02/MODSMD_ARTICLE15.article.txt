Alberta E. Siegel, professor of
psychology in psychiatry, has
resigned as associate dean of
undergraduate studies at Stanford,
effective Dec. 15.
Dr. Siegel, who assumed her
post in February 1971, cited her
desire to return to teaching and
research as her reason for
submitting her resignation.
Professor Siegel's duties as
dean included providing
administrative liaison with the
undergraduate special, SWOPSI,
SCIRE programs and the program
of individually designed,
interdepartmental majors.
In accepting her resignation,
James L. Gibbs Jr., dean of
undergraduate studies, said:
"Alberta Siegel has contributed
enormously to undergraduate
education at Stanford through her
conscientious and diplomatic
guidance of innovative programs. I
deeply regret her decision, but
understand fully her desire to

devote more time to teaching and
research."
In an interview, Professor
Siegel noted her appointment was
half-time teaching and half-time
administrative and"I really
couldn't keep up the scholarly
half.
"I had to make a choice. I
really enjoy my work as a child
psychologist and thought I'd
better stick with it."
She described her
administrative colleagues as
"extremely dedicated, hard
working people, for whom I have
a great deal of admiration and
respect."
She plans to continue teaching
and get caught up on several
writing commitments during
Winter Quarter. She has been
invited to address the American
Educational Research Association
in April and will teach a "values,
technology, and society" course
on the professions Spring Quarter.
