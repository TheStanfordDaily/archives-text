# Cummings Answers Student Queries
## 
### 
Alan A. Cummings has been
appointed by Vice President for
Business and Finance Robert R.
Augsburger to answer student
questions on the day-to-day
administration of the University.
Cummings, whose official title
will be Special Assistant for
Student Relations, will continue
in his present position as Manager
of Residences and Fraternities.
Cummings describes the

purpose of his experimental
position as "to inform but not to
mediate." He said that he will be
available to answer questions on
such diverse areas of concern as
land resources, investments, the
planning, construction and
utilization of university facilities,
housing, research administration,
police services and personnel and
employee relations.
Cummings said that "if 1 don't
know the answer to a student's
question, I'll either find it and
report back to the questioner or
direct him to the appropriate
individual for that answer." He
said that his position most closely
resembles an "Academic
Information Center for business
and finance affairs."
Augsburger also gave
Cummings the assignment of
coordinating student proposals
affecting business and finance
from such groups as SWOPSI or
SCIRE workshops.
