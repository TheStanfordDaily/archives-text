# New Party Meets

"Unless the Democrats nominate someone like Ted Kennedy or
George McGovern, we in the People's Party expect to garner at least
five percent of the vote in the 1972 Presidential election," according
to Assistant Professor of Education Martin Carnoy.
Carnoy told the Daily, on his return this week from the newly
formed party's convention in Dallas, that California's Peace and
Freedom Party has aligned itself with 27 other minor parties under
the People's Party banner.
He decried the fact that only 12% of the 18-21 year olds in
California had as yet registered to vote. He said that "we think the
reason that this has happened is that the two major parties haven't
had much to offer" in the past few years.
Motivate Voters
He said that he hoped that the presence of the People's Party on
the political scene would motivate far more young people to register.
He said that the party will wait to focus on the universities because
"students aren't yet ready to get involved in electoral politics and
they won't be until six or eight weeks before the California primary"
next June.
The People's Party platform calls for a "return of economic and
political power to the people" through redistribution of the wealth
and community control of community affairs. Carnoy said that the
party is this week asking U.S. Senator Fred R. Harris
(Dem.-Oklahoma) to be their candidate for President. Harris was
briefly a candidate for the Democratic Presidential nomination, but
was forced out of the race when he couldn't raise enough money.
Carnoy said that the initial Bay Area activity in behalf of the new
party will be held on December 10, when Dr. Benjamin Spock will
deliver a "Report from Dallas" at the Lettermen's Club in San Jose.
Spock is the party's interim candidate for President, but he has
pledged to step aside should another candidate be chosen.
Speakers
Spock will be followed by a series of People's Party speakers
including Princeton University Law Professor Richard Falk; author
Gore Vidal; former Milwaukee, Wisconsin Mayor Frank Zeidler; Karl
Hess, a former speechwriter for Barry Goldwater; and Joseph Rhodes,
the Harvard student who served on the Scranton Commission on
Campus Unrest.
