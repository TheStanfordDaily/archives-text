# PA Group Plans Recall
## 
### 
Support for the planned
280-room Holiday Inn on
Stanford land has brought a recall
movement upon four Falo Alto
City Council members.
Gregory Kerber leads the
movement to recall Councilmen
-John Beahrs, John Berwald,
William Clark, and Stanley Norton
for their part in a 5-3 vote to
grant rezoning for the hotel at El
Camino Real and University
Avenue. A referendum to reverse
the hotel vote accompanies the
recall.
Gerber, an unsuccessful liberal
candidate for City Council last
spring, was joined by the 300
member Palo Alto Tenants' Union
(PATU) last Wednesday in his
referendum effort. They vote
tonight whether to support the
recall.
A representative of the PATU
said they oppose any development
of the nature of the hotel plan
when low income housing is
needed and the area is already

overdeveloped.
Stanford University leases the
site, now occupied by dilapidated
warehouses, to Palo Alto on a
$24,000 a year basis, with 40
years remaining in the lease.
According to the PATU
spokesman, Stanford University
has a voice in how the land is
used.
He added, "Hotel development
does not make sense when the
motel vacancy rate is so low in the
area."
Opposition to the recall
movement has been voiced by the
leadership of two Palo Alto
"residentialist" organizations.
The Association for a Balanced
Community (ABC) stated that
recall was too extreme a measure.
"Elected councilmen may have
honest but differing points of
view on issues and should not be
subjected to the threat of recall
because of their views."
The Chairman of the Palo Alto
Civic League came out against the
referendum effort as well.
