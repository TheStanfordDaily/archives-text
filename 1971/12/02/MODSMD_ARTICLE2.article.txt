# Interim Judicial System
## Students, Hearing Officers Chosen 
### DAVID THIEMANN 
Five students have tentatively agreed
to serve on a student-faculty "campus
judicial panel," part of the interim
judicial system devised by the
University administration to
temporarily replace the now-defunct
Stanford Judicial Council, according to
Assistant to the Provost John Schwartz.
The administration has also
compiled a list of six outside hearing
officers chosen by a law school faculty
committee of Byron Sher, Paul Brest,
and Gerald Gunther. A hearing officer
will "decide the relevant facts and
make a preliminary recommendation
concerning the applicability of
University regulations to those facts"
to the judicial panel in each case.
Random Selection
At the administration's request,
Statistics Professor Rupert Miller used
an IBM random number generator to
select 50 of 12,515 students registered
this quarter for service on the panel.
Of these 50, the Dean of Students'
Office was unable to contact 13, 4
refused to serve for "ideological" or
"partially ideological" reasons, 28
refused to serve because judicial duties
would occupy an excessive amount of
their time, and five agreed to serve.
Three of the five will be regular
members of the panel, while the other
two will serve as alternates on a
case-by-case basis. Their names will be
released by the administration today.
Faculty Chosen
The three faculty members of the
panel have already been appointed by
the Committee on Committees of the
Faculty Senate. They are Richard
Brody (Political Science), David
Nivison (Philosophy), and Robert
White (Materials Science and
Electrical Engineering).
The six hearing officers named to
date are: Law Professor Lillian Altree,
of the University of Santa Clara; Law
Professor Eric Wright, also of Santa
Clara; Law Professor L. Minkus, of the
Golden Gate Law School; Law
Professor Henry Ramsey, from Boalt
Hall, UC Berkeley; Steven Tennis, a San
Francisco attorney in private practice;
and Robert Mnookin, also in private
practice in San Francisco. More hearing
officers may be appointed.
No Assignments Yet
The administration has not yet

forwarded cases to the non-voting
chairman of the panel, Law Professor
John Kaplan, and no cases have been
assigned to hearing officers.
According to Schwartz, the
procedural safeguards in the new
system will closely resemble those used
in the SJC. Guilt must be proven
beyond a reasonable doubt, and
protection against self-incrimination
and the right to counsel will be
retained.
Documentary evidence, in the form
of affadavits, will still be admissable,
though in most circumstances it would
have less persuasive value than direct
testimony. Hearsay evidence will be

admissable, and a person who faces trial
in the state court system will not be
immune from trial in the campus
judicial system.
The student-faculty panel will
render written opinions on the cases it
decides. These opinions, like the
recommendation and statement of facts
from the hearing officer, will be made
public unless a private session is agreed
to.
Schwartz, who will serve as
prosecutor for the administration in
judicial proceedings, said he will decide
upon the final version of procedures for
use in the judicial system this
afternoon.

Statistics Professor Rupert Miller used
an IBM random number generator to
select 50 of 12,515 students registered
this quarter for service on the panel.
Of these 50, the Dean of Students'
Office was unable to contact 13, 4
refused to serve for "ideological" or
"partially ideological" reasons, 28
refused to serve because judicial duties
would occupy an excessive amount of
their time, and five agreed to serve.
Three of the five will be regular
members of the panel, while the other
two will serve as alternates on a
case-by-case basis. Their names will be
released by the administration today.
Faculty Chosen
The three faculty members of the
panel have already been appointed by
the Committee on Committees of the
Faculty Senate. They are Richard
Brody (Political Science), David
Nivison (Philosophy), and Robert
White (Materials Science and
Electrical Engineering).
The six hearing officers named to
date are: Law Professor Lillian Altree,
of the University of Santa Clara; Law
Professor Eric Wright, also of Santa
Clara; Law Professor L. Minkus, of the
Golden Gate Law School; Law
Professor Henry Ramsey, from Boalt
Hall, UC Berkeley; Steven Tennis, a San
Francisco attorney in private practice;
and Robert Mnookin, also in private
practice in San Francisco. More hearing
officers may be appointed.
No Assignments Yet
The administration has not yet

forwarded cases to the non-voting
chairman of the panel, Law Professor
John Kaplan, and no cases have been
assigned to hearing officers.
According to Schwartz, the
procedural safeguards in the new
system will closely resemble those used
in the SJC. Guilt must be proven
beyond a reasonable doubt, and
protection against self-incrimination
and the right to counsel will be
retained.
Documentary evidence, in the form
of affadavits, will still be admissable,
though in most circumstances it would
have less persuasive value than direct
testimony. Hearsay evidence will be

admissable, and a person who faces trial
in the state court system will not be
immune from trial in the campus
judicial system.
The student-faculty panel will
render written opinions on the cases it
decides. These opinions, like the
recommendation and statement of facts
from the hearing officer, will be made
public unless a private session is agreed
to.
Schwartz, who will serve as
prosecutor for the administration in
judicial proceedings, said he will decide
upon the final version of procedures for
use in the judicial system this
afternoon.
Five students have tentatively agreed
to serve on a student-faculty "campus
judicial panel," part of the interim
judicial system devised by the
University administration to
temporarily replace the now-defunct
Stanford Judicial Council, according to
Assistant to the Provost John Schwartz.
The administration has also
compiled a list of six outside hearing
officers chosen by a law school faculty
committee of Byron Sher, Paul Brest,
and Gerald Gunther. A hearing officer
will "decide the relevant facts and
make a preliminary recommendation
concerning the applicability of
University regulations to those facts"
to the judicial panel in each case.
