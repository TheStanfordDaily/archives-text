# Public Events Subcommittee To Study Frost Ampitheater Rock Concerts
## 
### DAN BRENNER DON TOLLEFSON 
An ad hoc subcommittee to study the question of rock concerts in
Frost Ampitheater has been appointed this week by Professor John
Merryman, chairman of the University Committee on Public Events
(COPE). A moratorium on rock concerts in Frost was imposed last
July by Tom Bacchetti, Director of Public Events, following a July 18
concert during which a number of serious problems occurred.
At that concert, which featured Cold Blood and the Elvin Bishop
Group, there was a considerable amount of fighting involving
members of a motorcycle club and other audience members. A
number of persons were treated at Stanford Hospital for lacerations
and other injuries suffered at the concert.
Other reported problems included the burglary of a concession
truck, the robbery of some youngsters outside the ampitheater and
the collapse of a tree limb, which narrowly missed a number of
people.
In his charge to the subcommittee, Merryman said, "While the
action of the 18th may have precipitated the moratorium, the
problems of personal injuries, environmental damage to the
Ampitheater, violence, robbery and drug problems were not confined
to that concert along. Problems of this kind have occurred to a lesser
degree at Frost Ampitheater's rock concerts over the past three or
four years, although never of the magnitude of the July 18 concert.
Downward Trend
"Given the problems of the July 18 concert and the feeling thai
they were the manifestation of a continuing downward trend in the
conduct of rock music concerts, it was felt that the entire problem
required careful examination to determine what guidelines should be
established for the conduct of this particular type of activity should it
be determined that they can continue within reasonable risk
limitations."
Subcommittee chairman, Professor John Bunker of the School of
Medicine says "We would like to find, during the course of the study,
methods by which these activities can be managed within the
framework of minimal acceptable risks to the audience in attendance
and to the University." He adds, "We are going into this study with
the premise that rock concerts in Frost Ampitheater are an important
and legitimate avenue of expression for the Stanford student body."
Specific questions which the subcommittee will examine include
security and crowd control measures, medical aid provision, possible
limits on amplified sound, sponsor organization liability for damages,
off-campus ticket sales and drug traffic. The last question which
Merryman asks the subcommittee to investigate is "If unsatisfactory
conclusions are reached in response to the above questions, shall the
subcommittee recommend a permanent ban on 'rock' concerts in
Frost Ampitheater?"
'Blanket Invitation'
A "blanket invitation" has been offered to all parties wishing to
contribute to the study to offer written testimony responding to the
questions posed in the charge. The deadline for written statements is
January 21 and they should be mailed to the Frost Rock Concert
Committee, Office of Public Events, Room 3, Encina Commons,
Stanford 94305.
During the same period, the subcommittee will actively solicit
opinions from past sponsors of rock concerts in Frost and other
"expert witnesses" both from within and without the University.
Following the January deadline, the statements will be collated and
a staff summary will be released to the public. The subcommittee will
then study the written results and determine if they want to hold
open hearings for oral testimony. Finally, the subcommittee will
prepare its recommendations for presentation to COPE, by March 10.

COPE will then make its recommendations to the president of the
University by mid-April. Bacchetti said that in the past he can not
remember a concert having been held before late April, so that
concerts still could conceivably be held in the late spring, if the ban is
lifted.
Outside Visitors
Speaking on KZSU Tuesday night, Bacchetti said, "Unlike other
cultural events that take place at Frost, it appears that rock concerts
cause the problem." Noting the source of the rock concert problems,
he remarked that the most difficulties don't come from Stanford
students, but from outside visitors who come on campus especially for
the shows. Emphasizing that he would not want to prohibit any group
of people from coming, he notes that there will have to be some way
to insure public safety at these events.
Earlier Bacchetti had said, "Stanford has been one of the very few
places with some degree of regularity over the past few years. And if
there is a way that these concerts can safely continue, I hope we at
Stanford will be able to find it in the course of this study."
In addition to Bunker, the committee includes, law Professor
Thomas Gray, Lu Ann Carter, a staff employee working for the Black
Students Volunteer Center on campus; and student members David
Elder, chairman of the ASSU Special Events Board, Rischa Williams,
another Board member, and Thomas Crystal, a COPE member
associated with rock concerts at Frost. One faculty member must still
be appointed.

At that concert, which featured Cold Blood and the Elvin Bishop
Group, there was a considerable amount of fighting involving
members of a motorcycle club and other audience members. A
number of persons were treated at Stanford Hospital for lacerations
and other injuries suffered at the concert.
Other reported problems included the burglary of a concession
truck, the robbery of some youngsters outside the ampitheater and
the collapse of a tree limb, which narrowly missed a number of
people.
In his charge to the subcommittee, Merryman said, "While the
action of the 18th may have precipitated the moratorium, the
problems of personal injuries, environmental damage to the
Ampitheater, violence, robbery and drug problems were not confined
to that concert along. Problems of this kind have occurred to a lesser
degree at Frost Ampitheater's rock concerts over the past three or
four years, although never of the magnitude of the July 18 concert.
Downward Trend
"Given the problems of the July 18 concert and the feeling thai
they were the manifestation of a continuing downward trend in the
conduct of rock music concerts, it was felt that the entire problem
required careful examination to determine what guidelines should be
established for the conduct of this particular type of activity should it
be determined that they can continue within reasonable risk
limitations."
Subcommittee chairman, Professor John Bunker of the School of
Medicine says "We would like to find, during the course of the study,
methods by which these activities can be managed within the
framework of minimal acceptable risks to the audience in attendance
and to the University." He adds, "We are going into this study with
the premise that rock concerts in Frost Ampitheater are an important
and legitimate avenue of expression for the Stanford student body."
Specific questions which the subcommittee will examine include
security and crowd control measures, medical aid provision, possible
limits on amplified sound, sponsor organization liability for damages,
off-campus ticket sales and drug traffic. The last question which
Merryman asks the subcommittee to investigate is "If unsatisfactory
conclusions are reached in response to the above questions, shall the
subcommittee recommend a permanent ban on 'rock' concerts in
Frost Ampitheater?"
'Blanket Invitation'
A "blanket invitation" has been offered to all parties wishing to
contribute to the study to offer written testimony responding to the
questions posed in the charge. The deadline for written statements is
January 21 and they should be mailed to the Frost Rock Concert
Committee, Office of Public Events, Room 3, Encina Commons,
Stanford 94305.
During the same period, the subcommittee will actively solicit
opinions from past sponsors of rock concerts in Frost and other
"expert witnesses" both from within and without the University.
Following the January deadline, the statements will be collated and
a staff summary will be released to the public. The subcommittee will
then study the written results and determine if they want to hold
open hearings for oral testimony. Finally, the subcommittee will
prepare its recommendations for presentation to COPE, by March 10.

COPE will then make its recommendations to the president of the
University by mid-April. Bacchetti said that in the past he can not
remember a concert having been held before late April, so that
concerts still could conceivably be held in the late spring, if the ban is
lifted.
Outside Visitors
Speaking on KZSU Tuesday night, Bacchetti said, "Unlike other
cultural events that take place at Frost, it appears that rock concerts
cause the problem." Noting the source of the rock concert problems,
he remarked that the most difficulties don't come from Stanford
students, but from outside visitors who come on campus especially for
the shows. Emphasizing that he would not want to prohibit any group
of people from coming, he notes that there will have to be some way
to insure public safety at these events.
Earlier Bacchetti had said, "Stanford has been one of the very few
places with some degree of regularity over the past few years. And if
there is a way that these concerts can safely continue, I hope we at
Stanford will be able to find it in the course of this study."
In addition to Bunker, the committee includes, law Professor
Thomas Gray, Lu Ann Carter, a staff employee working for the Black
Students Volunteer Center on campus; and student members David
Elder, chairman of the ASSU Special Events Board, Rischa Williams,
another Board member, and Thomas Crystal, a COPE member
associated with rock concerts at Frost. One faculty member must still
be appointed.

the collapse of a tree limb, which narrowly missed a number of
people.
In his charge to the subcommittee, Merryman said, "While the
action of the 18th may have precipitated the moratorium, the
problems of personal injuries, environmental damage to the
Ampitheater, violence, robbery and drug problems were not confined
to that concert along. Problems of this kind have occurred to a lesser
degree at Frost Ampitheater's rock concerts over the past three or
four years, although never of the magnitude of the July 18 concert.
Downward Trend
"Given the problems of the July 18 concert and the feeling thai
they were the manifestation of a continuing downward trend in the
conduct of rock music concerts, it was felt that the entire problem
required careful examination to determine what guidelines should be
established for the conduct of this particular type of activity should it
be determined that they can continue within reasonable risk
limitations."
Subcommittee chairman, Professor John Bunker of the School of
Medicine says "We would like to find, during the course of the study,
methods by which these activities can be managed within the
framework of minimal acceptable risks to the audience in attendance
and to the University." He adds, "We are going into this study with
the premise that rock concerts in Frost Ampitheater are an important
and legitimate avenue of expression for the Stanford student body."
Specific questions which the subcommittee will examine include
security and crowd control measures, medical aid provision, possible
limits on amplified sound, sponsor organization liability for damages,
off-campus ticket sales and drug traffic. The last question which
Merryman asks the subcommittee to investigate is "If unsatisfactory
conclusions are reached in response to the above questions, shall the
subcommittee recommend a permanent ban on 'rock' concerts in
Frost Ampitheater?"
'Blanket Invitation'
A "blanket invitation" has been offered to all parties wishing to
contribute to the study to offer written testimony responding to the
questions posed in the charge. The deadline for written statements is
January 21 and they should be mailed to the Frost Rock Concert
Committee, Office of Public Events, Room 3, Encina Commons,
Stanford 94305.
During the same period, the subcommittee will actively solicit
opinions from past sponsors of rock concerts in Frost and other
"expert witnesses" both from within and without the University.
Following the January deadline, the statements will be collated and
a staff summary will be released to the public. The subcommittee will
then study the written results and determine if they want to hold
open hearings for oral testimony. Finally, the subcommittee will
prepare its recommendations for presentation to COPE, by March 10.

COPE will then make its recommendations to the president of the
University by mid-April. Bacchetti said that in the past he can not
remember a concert having been held before late April, so that
concerts still could conceivably be held in the late spring, if the ban is
lifted.
Outside Visitors
Speaking on KZSU Tuesday night, Bacchetti said, "Unlike other
cultural events that take place at Frost, it appears that rock concerts
cause the problem." Noting the source of the rock concert problems,
he remarked that the most difficulties don't come from Stanford
students, but from outside visitors who come on campus especially for
the shows. Emphasizing that he would not want to prohibit any group
of people from coming, he notes that there will have to be some way
to insure public safety at these events.
Earlier Bacchetti had said, "Stanford has been one of the very few
places with some degree of regularity over the past few years. And if
there is a way that these concerts can safely continue, I hope we at
Stanford will be able to find it in the course of this study."
In addition to Bunker, the committee includes, law Professor
Thomas Gray, Lu Ann Carter, a staff employee working for the Black
Students Volunteer Center on campus; and student members David
Elder, chairman of the ASSU Special Events Board, Rischa Williams,
another Board member, and Thomas Crystal, a COPE member
associated with rock concerts at Frost. One faculty member must still
be appointed.

ROCK CONCERT VIOLENCE—This man was one of several bloodied victims of some scattered fighting
which occurred at a rock concert in Frost Ampitheater last July 18. Following the concert, Director of
Public Events, Tom Bacchetti imposed a moratorium on rock events in Frost. An ad hoc subcommittee of
the committee on public events will study the question of such events and make a recommendation to
President Lyman by mid-April.

An ad hoc subcommittee to study the question of rock concerts in
Frost Ampitheater has been appointed this week by Professor John
Merryman, chairman of the University Committee on Public Events
(COPE). A moratorium on rock concerts in Frost was imposed last
July by Tom Bacchetti, Director of Public Events, following a July 18
concert during which a number of serious problems occurred.
At that concert, which featured Cold Blood and the Elvin Bishop
Group, there was a considerable amount of fighting involving
members of a motorcycle club and other audience members. A
number of persons were treated at Stanford Hospital for lacerations
and other injuries suffered at the concert.
Other reported problems included the burglary of a concession
truck, the robbery of some youngsters outside the ampitheater and
the collapse of a tree limb, which narrowly missed a number of
people.
In his charge to the subcommittee, Merryman said, "While the
action of the 18th may have precipitated the moratorium, the
