# 'The Kitchen' Lacks A Main Course
## 
### DOUG ARTHUR 
"The Kitchen" is no delicacy.
It's more like warmed-up dramatic
leftovers, presented by gifted
servants, on fine china: a case ot
an excellent production of a
third-rate play.
Arnold Wesker's drama
examines the behind-the-scenes
workings of a restaurant
kitchen—sort of a cross between a
culinary slice of life and a TV
soap-opera. We experience a day
in the lives of the kitchen's
inhabitants. The interactions
among the cooks, waitresses, and
their supervisors, provide many
possibilities: love affairs, conflicts,
jealousy, pranks, friendship, and
dreams.
The entire kitchen is more than
the sum of its parts. The
functioning of the kitchen,
including its appliances and
accessories, depends upon all of
its personnel working together.
Thus a single character appears
important only in relation to the

others. The most exciting scenes
stressed the total gestalt of the
kitchen.
On the other hand, when the
drama focuses on one or two
individual characters, it tends to
stagnate. None of the characters,
with the possible exception of
Peter, merits more than passing
attention. Specific
characterizations become facets of
the larger organization rather than
focal points of the play.
Physical Reality
Wesker succeeds in creating the
physical reality of the kitchen: it
is a living, organic whole. It exists
on the basis of the labor of all the
workers; it doesn't matter which
person fulfills which function, so
long as all tasks are completed. At
least one character comes to
realize that the kitchen will
survive long after they have all
gone. It doesn't need them.
The playwright encounters
difficulty in balancing his
autonomous conception of the

kitchen with the details of
characterization. If the kitchen is
perfectly independent of its
people, why go through the
motions of characterization? If,
however, it depends upon its
individuals for dramatic interest,
one would expect more fully
developed characters. Of the cast
of thirty, only a few constitute
characters; the rest emerge as
sketches towards a character.
This production utilizes a
thrust stage on the main stage of
Memorial Auditorium. The acting
area was surrounded by sets of
bleachers on three sides of the
stage. That means that if you sat
in the bleachers downstage, you
could see about 3/4 of the action.
If, unaccustomed to the play or
the caprices of the ushers, you sat
in the bleachers on either side of
the stage, you could see only 1 /2
of what was happening (in the
first two rows at least).
Director John
Olon-Scrymgeour faced some

complicated directorial problems.
Not the least of which was
keeping the actors occupied with
bits of miming business in a
realistic kitchen set. English,
Italian, German and Jewish
accents appeared unobtrusive in
the dialog and added to the
composition. The director found
ingenious means to vitalize
Wesker's play.
The action in this production
occurs in several areas of the stage
at once. Two big doors upstage
and a walkway and stairs
downstage lead to the ovens and
stoves which form the central part
of the set; small tables, or working
areas, surround the ovens. As
characters enter/leave the set,
specific areas of the stage
gain/lose significance. Rather than
a main line of action, there are
several.
The pacing of the show varied
greatly, and this held the
audience's interest. At the height
of the noon rush hour, the
waitresses literally run around the
kitchen, ducking and swinging
their huge trays to avoid colliding
with each other. As the recorded
noise of the gas ovens becomes
louder, the action of all the
characters becomes more frantic
until the blackout for
intermission.
Varied Pacing
When the Chef, played to the
hilt by Arturo Lionetti, comes to
scold a cook for not working
faster, he touches off an uproar of

grumbling around the kitchen.
The afternoon interlude (between
parts 1 and 2 ) began very slowly,
with the Greek music and dancing
taking a long time to catch on
among the cooks. The great
variation in pacing gave a more
human rhythm to the kitchen.
Some touches complemented
both director and actors.
Queenelle Minet as Violet
contrasts the other brassy
waitresses (all are identically
dressed in black uniforms with
caps) when a cook ignores her
order. By her outraged expression,
we sense the humiliation and
anger which she feels.
Roger Kozol's Peter was the
strength of this production. True,
he played the only full character
in the show, but he handled
everything, including a difficult
German accent, with expertise.
Moody, spiteful, rambunctious,
tender, violent, Mr. Kozol
portrayed a complex man who
finally rebels, in a furious,
destructive outburst, against the
tyranny of the kitchen.
"The Kitchen" contains a
conglomeration of meager lives.
These are the nobodies: they have
no past, a mundane present, and
no future. Even their dreams
sound dull. Wesker's play
illuminates this potpourri of
humanity for one day. At
intermission, I heard a critically
acute summation: as drama, "The
Kitchen" has everything but the
main course.

of thirty, only a few constitute
characters; the rest emerge as
sketches towards a character.
This production utilizes a
thrust stage on the main stage of
Memorial Auditorium. The acting
area was surrounded by sets of
bleachers on three sides of the
stage. That means that if you sat
in the bleachers downstage, you
could see about 3/4 of the action.
If, unaccustomed to the play or
the caprices of the ushers, you sat
in the bleachers on either side of
the stage, you could see only 1 /2
of what was happening (in the
first two rows at least).
Director John
Olon-Scrymgeour faced some

complicated directorial problems.
Not the least of which was
keeping the actors occupied with
bits of miming business in a
realistic kitchen set. English,
Italian, German and Jewish
accents appeared unobtrusive in
the dialog and added to the
composition. The director found
ingenious means to vitalize
Wesker's play.
The action in this production
occurs in several areas of the stage
at once. Two big doors upstage
and a walkway and stairs
downstage lead to the ovens and
stoves which form the central part
of the set; small tables, or working
areas, surround the ovens. As
characters enter/leave the set,
specific areas of the stage
gain/lose significance. Rather than
a main line of action, there are
several.
The pacing of the show varied
greatly, and this held the
audience's interest. At the height
of the noon rush hour, the
waitresses literally run around the
kitchen, ducking and swinging
their huge trays to avoid colliding
with each other. As the recorded
noise of the gas ovens becomes
louder, the action of all the
characters becomes more frantic
until the blackout for
intermission.
Varied Pacing
When the Chef, played to the
hilt by Arturo Lionetti, comes to
scold a cook for not working
faster, he touches off an uproar of

grumbling around the kitchen.
The afternoon interlude (between
parts 1 and 2 ) began very slowly,
with the Greek music and dancing
taking a long time to catch on
among the cooks. The great
variation in pacing gave a more
human rhythm to the kitchen.
Some touches complemented
both director and actors.
Queenelle Minet as Violet
contrasts the other brassy
waitresses (all are identically
dressed in black uniforms with
caps) when a cook ignores her
order. By her outraged expression,
we sense the humiliation and
anger which she feels.
Roger Kozol's Peter was the
strength of this production. True,
he played the only full character
in the show, but he handled
everything, including a difficult
German accent, with expertise.
Moody, spiteful, rambunctious,
tender, violent, Mr. Kozol
portrayed a complex man who
finally rebels, in a furious,
destructive outburst, against the
tyranny of the kitchen.
"The Kitchen" contains a
conglomeration of meager lives.
These are the nobodies: they have
no past, a mundane present, and
no future. Even their dreams
sound dull. Wesker's play
illuminates this potpourri of
humanity for one day. At
intermission, I heard a critically
acute summation: as drama, "The
Kitchen" has everything but the
main course.

CUTTING UP—Arturo Lionetti, chef at the Stanford Faculty Club, is
"The Chef" in the Arnold Wesker play "The Kitchen" which is being
performed in the Memorial Auditorium Arena Stage through
December 11. Tickets for this second fall production of the Stanford
Drama Department are priced at $2.50 general and $1 for students on
weeknights and at $3 general and $2 for students on Friday and
Saturday nights.
"The Kitchen" is no delicacy.
It's more like warmed-up dramatic
leftovers, presented by gifted
servants, on fine china: a case ot
an excellent production of a
third-rate play.
Arnold Wesker's drama
examines the behind-the-scenes
workings of a restaurant
kitchen—sort of a cross between a
culinary slice of life and a TV
soap-opera. We experience a day
in the lives of the kitchen's
inhabitants. The interactions
among the cooks, waitresses, and
their supervisors, provide many
possibilities: love affairs, conflicts,
jealousy, pranks, friendship, and
dreams.
The entire kitchen is more than
the sum of its parts. The
functioning of the kitchen,
including its appliances and
accessories, depends upon all of
its personnel working together.
Thus a single character appears
important only in relation to the

others. The most exciting scenes
stressed the total gestalt of the
kitchen.
On the other hand, when the
drama focuses on one or two
individual characters, it tends to
stagnate. None of the characters,
with the possible exception of
Peter, merits more than passing
attention. Specific
characterizations become facets of
the larger organization rather than
focal points of the play.
Physical Reality
Wesker succeeds in creating the
physical reality of the kitchen: it
is a living, organic whole. It exists
on the basis of the labor of all the
workers; it doesn't matter which
person fulfills which function, so
long as all tasks are completed. At
least one character comes to
realize that the kitchen will
survive long after they have all
gone. It doesn't need them.
The playwright encounters
difficulty in balancing his
autonomous conception of the

kitchen with the details of
characterization. If the kitchen is
perfectly independent of its
people, why go through the
motions of characterization? If,
however, it depends upon its
individuals for dramatic interest,
one would expect more fully
developed characters. Of the cast
of thirty, only a few constitute
characters; the rest emerge as
sketches towards a character.

The afternoon interlude (between
parts 1 and 2 ) began very slowly,
with the Greek music and dancing
taking a long time to catch on
among the cooks. The great
variation in pacing gave a more
human rhythm to the kitchen.
Some touches complemented
both director and actors.
Queenelle Minet as Violet
contrasts the other brassy
waitresses (all are identically
dressed in black uniforms with
caps) when a cook ignores her
order. By her outraged expression,
we sense the humiliation and
anger which she feels.
Roger Kozol's Peter was the
strength of this production. True,
he played the only full character
in the show, but he handled
everything, including a difficult
German accent, with expertise.
Moody, spiteful, rambunctious,
tender, violent, Mr. Kozol
portrayed a complex man who
finally rebels, in a furious,
destructive outburst, against the
tyranny of the kitchen.
"The Kitchen" contains a
conglomeration of meager lives.
These are the nobodies: they have
no past, a mundane present, and
no future. Even their dreams
sound dull. Wesker's play
illuminates this potpourri of
humanity for one day. At
intermission, I heard a critically
acute summation: as drama, "The
Kitchen" has everything but the
main course.

CUTTING UP—Arturo Lionetti, chef at the Stanford Faculty Club, is
"The Chef" in the Arnold Wesker play "The Kitchen" which is being
performed in the Memorial Auditorium Arena Stage through
December 11. Tickets for this second fall production of the Stanford
Drama Department are priced at $2.50 general and $1 for students on
weeknights and at $3 general and $2 for students on Friday and
Saturday nights.
"The Kitchen" is no delicacy.
It's more like warmed-up dramatic
leftovers, presented by gifted
servants, on fine china: a case ot
an excellent production of a
third-rate play.
Arnold Wesker's drama
examines the behind-the-scenes
workings of a restaurant
kitchen—sort of a cross between a
culinary slice of life and a TV
soap-opera. We experience a day
in the lives of the kitchen's
inhabitants. The interactions
among the cooks, waitresses, and
their supervisors, provide many
possibilities: love affairs, conflicts,
jealousy, pranks, friendship, and
dreams.
The entire kitchen is more than
the sum of its parts. The
functioning of the kitchen,
including its appliances and
accessories, depends upon all of
its personnel working together.
Thus a single character appears
important only in relation to the

others. The most exciting scenes
stressed the total gestalt of the
kitchen.
On the other hand, when the
drama focuses on one or two
individual characters, it tends to
stagnate. None of the characters,
with the possible exception of
Peter, merits more than passing
attention. Specific
characterizations become facets of
the larger organization rather than
focal points of the play.
Physical Reality
Wesker succeeds in creating the
physical reality of the kitchen: it
is a living, organic whole. It exists
on the basis of the labor of all the
workers; it doesn't matter which
person fulfills which function, so
long as all tasks are completed. At
least one character comes to
realize that the kitchen will
survive long after they have all
gone. It doesn't need them.
The playwright encounters
difficulty in balancing his
autonomous conception of the

kitchen with the details of
characterization. If the kitchen is
perfectly independent of its
people, why go through the
motions of characterization? If,
however, it depends upon its
individuals for dramatic interest,
one would expect more fully
developed characters. Of the cast
of thirty, only a few constitute
characters; the rest emerge as
sketches towards a character.
This production utilizes a
thrust stage on the main stage of
Memorial Auditorium. The acting
area was surrounded by sets of
bleachers on three sides of the
stage. That means that if you sat
in the bleachers downstage, you
could see about 3/4 of the action.
If, unaccustomed to the play or
the caprices of the ushers, you sat
in the bleachers on either side of
the stage, you could see only 1 /2
of what was happening (in the
first two rows at least).
Director John
Olon-Scrymgeour faced some

complicated directorial problems.
Not the least of which was
keeping the actors occupied with
bits of miming business in a
realistic kitchen set. English,
Italian, German and Jewish
accents appeared unobtrusive in
the dialog and added to the
composition. The director found
ingenious means to vitalize
Wesker's play.
The action in this production
occurs in several areas of the stage
at once. Two big doors upstage
and a walkway and stairs
downstage lead to the ovens and
stoves which form the central part
of the set; small tables, or working
areas, surround the ovens. As
characters enter/leave the set,
specific areas of the stage
gain/lose significance. Rather than
a main line of action, there are
several.
The pacing of the show varied
greatly, and this held the
audience's interest. At the height
of the noon rush hour, the
waitresses literally run around the
kitchen, ducking and swinging
their huge trays to avoid colliding
with each other. As the recorded
noise of the gas ovens becomes
louder, the action of all the
characters becomes more frantic
until the blackout for
intermission.
Varied Pacing
When the Chef, played to the
hilt by Arturo Lionetti, comes to
scold a cook for not working
faster, he touches off an uproar of

grumbling around the kitchen.
The afternoon interlude (between
parts 1 and 2 ) began very slowly,
with the Greek music and dancing
