Indian Victories
NEW DELHI, India — India's
troops have carved out a three- to
five-mile stretch of East Pakistan in five
days of occupation and have cut the
only rail line into the northwest sector
of the troubled province, an Indian
spokesman said yesterday. Pakistan
warned that the two nations were
drifting toward a major conflict.
The spokesman told reporters in
New Delhi the main Indian objective is
to make it possible for 10 million East
Pakistani refugees in India "to go back
to their homes in honor and dignity.
"The immediate objective is to

Analysis
Members of a SWOPSI course
studying Department of Defense
(Dod) sponsored research at Stanford
will present the second volume of their
report at a press conference today at
1:30 p.m. in Tresidder 270.
The report is an analysis of
information contained in Volume 1 of
the report, issued this summer, and
deals with the relationship of Stanford
departments to governmental funding
agencies.
The Faculty Senate, at its regular
meeting this afternoon will discuss
adoption of possible statements calling

statements of principle before it.

continued. "But if you ask what is our
over-all objective, it is to see that these
refugees go back."
The spokesman's statement followed
by a day Prime Mirister Indira Gandhi's
demand that West Pakistan pull its
troops out of East Pakistan, where it is
trying to crush a rebellion, and let the
people there have their independence.
Nixon Veto?
WASHINGTON - Rep. Wilbur D. Mills
said yesterday Congress will not remove
the disputed campaign-contribution
provision from the pending tax-cut bill
even though President Nixon has
promised it will mean a veto of the bill.
Mills, chairman of the House Ways
and Means Committee, said the dollar
checkoff amendment to the tax bill will
emerge intact from Congress, where a
conference was nearing final action on
the bill, and be sent to the White House
for Nixon's consideration.
No Age Limit
SACRAMENTO — Birth control advice
and contraceptives could be provided
to teen-age girls by physicians without
parental consent under a bill sent to
Gov. Reagan yesterday by the
Assembly.
Opponents condemned the measure
by Sen. Anthony Beilensori, D.-Beverly
Hills, as "an attack on the family unit."
Supporters argued it is not realistic to
"turn our backs and ignore what is
actually going on."
The vote was 43-19.
The bill provides no minimum age
limit on girls who may receive birth
control care and advice from
physicians.

"If they're old enough to ask for it,
they're old enough to receive it," said
Assemblyman Gordon Duffy,
R.-Hanford, Assembly sponsor of the
bill.
Drinking Bill Killed
SACRAMENTO - The Senate
yesterday defeated 9-14 a proposed
constitutional amendment to lower the
drinking age to 18.
Sen. Clark Bradley, R-San Jose, was
the only senator to speak against the

measure, saying it would cause the
number of drunk driving arrests and
deaths in California "to skyrocket."
Democrat David Roberti of Los
Angeles, Senate sponsor of the
measure, said it would mean only that
the legislature was allowing a vote by
the people. He said the legislature has
already voted to give 18-year-olds all
other privileges of adulthood.
"I don't think we in the legislature
ought to play ostrich and pretend that
18-year-olds don't drink," he said.
