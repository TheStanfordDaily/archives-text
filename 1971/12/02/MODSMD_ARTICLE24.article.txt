# Houston Downs Cagers
## 
### 
Houston's combination of a tough zone defense and tremendous frontline
rebounding and scoring strength proved too much for Stanford as the Cougars
downed the Tribe, 87-67, despite excellent individual performances by David
Frost, Mike Mann and Claude Terry.
Frost, sophomore transfer from Long Beach CC, exhibited superb ballhandling
abilities and defensive Artistry in his Stanford debutâ€”picking up 19 points and
eight rebounds.
Terry led all scorers with 22 tallies, while Mann played an outstanding game
collecting nine rebounds and pestering Houston's highly-touted front line. Ailing
Bob Buell also performed well, although playing with one leg completely taped
and a face mask protecting a broken nose.
Fifth-ranked Houston had come to Palo Alto expecting to blow the Tribe off
the court with speed, strength, depth, and reputation. But Howie Dallmar's squad
forced the Cougars to reconsider early in the game as the lead changed hands
seven times in the first 16 minutes.
Then with 3:48 left in the first half, Houston exploded for four buckets on
breakaway steals. The Indians regrouped, however, behind the defensive play of
Pat Rusco and Mann to hold the Cougs to a 39-30 intermission edge.
After closing the gap to 39-36 before losing momentum, Stanford drew within
seven points several times midway through the second half to keep the pressure
on. But the Indians' ten final period turnovers stopped any serious threat to the
agile Texans.
Freshmen Win
Stanford's freshman team opened its 1971 campaign with an impressive win
over the UC Med Center, 90-33. Rich Kelley, 7-foot center from Woodside High
School, led the frosh with 20 points, 16 rebounds, and numerous blocked shots.
Melvin Arterberry pitched in 15, while Scott Trobbe collected 14 points and nine
rebounds.
