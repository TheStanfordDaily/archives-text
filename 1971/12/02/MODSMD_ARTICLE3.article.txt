# Defense Questions Employee In Bazile-Laury Assault Trial
## 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
Defense attorneys for Leo Bazile
and Chris Laury spent all yesterday
cross-examining the Stanford Hospital
employee the two black leaders are
charged with beating last May 2.
Mary Jane Schmidt spent four hours
on the stand being questioned in great
detail about the r'leged attack on her
and how she came to recognize Bazile
and Laury as her assailants.
Pharsiel Shelton, Laury's attorney
asked her extensively about the

preliminary hearing in June. At that
time Schmidt had picked a youth out
of the gallery as her assailant who later
turned out to be Keith King, and not
Laury.
But she said yesterday that as soon
as Laury (who was sitting next to King
at the time) put dark glasses on, she
"immediately" recognized Laury as her
assailant.
Scar Unseen
Schmidt also testified that she had
not seen a scar on the upper lip of the

smaller of her two assailants (who
would have been Laury). Laury then
stood three feet from Schmidt in the
courtroom and she admitted she could
see a scar above his lip.
At one point during Shelton's
cross-examination, Schmidt gave
testimony about when she saw Bazile
and Laury after the alleged attack
which contradicted her earlier
testimony. Schmidt said that the
transcript was "mixed up."
She also said that she "had no
doubts" about the fact that Laury was
one of her assailants. She said she was
equally as sure that Laury was her
assailant as she was when she identified
King as her assailant.
Sketches Revealed
Associate Law School Dean Thelton
Henderson, representing Bazile, asked
Schmidt about two sketches she
allegedly drew of her assailants last
May, though Schmidt had not told
anyone about their existence until last
Tuesday.
She explained that she had merely
done the sketches for herself.
In the sketches she had noted that
the lips of the larger of her two
assailants (which would have been
Bazile) did not protrude "as with most
black people," she said.
She said Bazile's lips do not
protrude but added that Henderson's
and Shelton's don't either.
Schmidt also testified that she didn't
remember a scar on the larger of her
assailants. Bazile then stood up to
display a scar on the left side of his
forehead.
Crimes Alleged
The prosecution alleges that on May
2, Bazile and Laury broke into
Schmidt's East Palo Alto home and
struck, kicked and burned her, for not
observing a work stoppage at the
Hospital over the firing of a black
janitor.
Schmidt said yesterday that her two
attackers had called her a "white pig"
and that "I did not respect this work
stoppage."
Bazile is the former chairman of the
BSU and Laury was deeply involved in
last year's Hospital controversy.
The trial resumes today at 9:30 a.m.
in San Mateo Superior Court in
Redwood City. Defense attorneys will
continue their cross-examination of
Schmidt.
