# 10 Sentenced For Hospital Sit-in
## 
### 
Ten radicals received fines and suspended jail sentences
for misdemeanor convictions arising out of the April 9
sit-in at the Stanford Hospital.
All 10 pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor charges. They
were sentenced by Judge Sidney Feinberg of the Palo
Alto-Mountain View Municipal Court.
Among those sentenced were Assistant German
Professor Juan Flores and John Dolly, the former Medical
Center technician whose grievance hearing recently ended
with the panel recommending that he be reinstated and
given back pay.
Flores received the most severe penalties of the ten. He
was given a 120 day suspended jail sentence, three years'
probation and a $315 fine. The remaining probationary
periods ranged from one to two years while the suspended
sentences last from 15 to 30 days. Fines between $95 and
$250 were given.
The hospital sit-in arose from the firing of black janitor
Sam Bridges. Damage caused by the violence that followed
a 30 hour sit-in totaled $100,000.
Sentenced with Flores and Dolly were University

students Mary Dougherty, Katherine Kurtz, and Philip
Lind, former Stanford employees Devera Satisky and Mrs.
Barbara Mooney as well as Â»Tobias De Latorre, Edward
Mangones, and Jacqueline Montoya. Satisky and Mooney
were fired for their involvement in the disturbance.
In addition to the 10 sentenced since last Friday, five
other people, including Bridges were given suspended jail
sentences, probation and fines last Wednesday. Five others
involved in the Hospital disturbance face sentencing
tomorrow on their felony convictions.
The sentencing of John Keilch, a former library
employee fired for his role in the riot, was continued until
December 6. The case of Jean Hobson, unsuccessful
candidate last year for Palo Alto City Council woman, was
continued until December 10.
Judge Feinberg said that the conditions of the latest
probation sentences are that each person "shall not engage
in any unlawful assembly, unlawful demonstration or sit-in
nor shall he instigate, aid or abet any such assembly."
The 10 were also prohibited from engaging "in any
illegal acts of force or violence directed against the person
or property of others."
