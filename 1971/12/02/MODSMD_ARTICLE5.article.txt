# Engineering Class Designs Weird Golf Ball Structures
## 
### JODY SINDELAR 
Rube Goldberg is alive, well, and
living in ME 101, or at least it looked
that way. Yesterday afternoon the top
floor of the engineering building was
t full of large and humorous structures
that, using a golf ball for power, threw
confetti in the air, set off firecrackers,
opened Playboy foldouts, dropped raw
eggs on the floor, drew pictures and
took photographs.
These structures were the solutions
to a mechanical engineering design
problem annually put to his class by
Prof. R. H. McKim.
The visual thinking class built the
contraptions that put the ball through
its paces in exactly 60 seconds. The
stipulation was that the ball was to go
through a minimum of five phases and
come out in a minute.
Its paces were to be entirely
mechanical and humorous. The paces
were liberally interpretted; devices
made use of water balloons, beer cans,
ramps, a home made clock,
trampolines.
Gold Ball Eater
There was a robot-looking
contraption that ate golf balls. The ball
went down the throat to the stomach,
through the intestine and out—into a
toilet.
One of the contraptions answering
the problem used the power of the ball
to draw a smile on a smiling face, and
then, at the end of the path,flicked a

switch that took a photograph of the
face it had drawn.
The "leaning tower of chaos" was
over six feet tall, with the ball sliding
down a winding ramp, breaking
balloons and dropping raw eggs along
the way.
'Day In The Life'
In "A day in the life of a golf ball,"
the hero started off as all good golf
balls do, with a morning bath. This
prepared the ball for the heavy traffic it
encountered on the way to work. Work
for the golf ball was up an elevator to
the top floor of a high riss office
building. The ball went through the
everyday back and forth of a business
day. This mundane life was too much
for the ball. Before its 60 seconds were
up it was flipped out of its world by a
hand attached to a mouse trap.
The trainers of the golf balls were
arbitrarily put into groups of about
five. They could create anything they
wanted as long as they used only
mechanical devices and the ball
completed its course in a minute. One
of the creators said that a limiting
factor was that they had no finances
but their own.
Steve Tredo, one of the builders of a
structure of that used elevators,
skipped the ball across water, and
bounced it on trampolines, said that
"the project deals with organized
creativity. There is no practical
application of the project."

that way. Yesterday afternoon the top
floor of the engineering building was
t full of large and humorous structures
that, using a golf ball for power, threw
confetti in the air, set off firecrackers,
opened Playboy foldouts, dropped raw
eggs on the floor, drew pictures and
took photographs.
These structures were the solutions
to a mechanical engineering design
problem annually put to his class by
Prof. R. H. McKim.
The visual thinking class built the
contraptions that put the ball through
its paces in exactly 60 seconds. The
stipulation was that the ball was to go
through a minimum of five phases and
come out in a minute.
Its paces were to be entirely
mechanical and humorous. The paces
were liberally interpretted; devices
made use of water balloons, beer cans,
ramps, a home made clock,
trampolines.
Gold Ball Eater
There was a robot-looking
contraption that ate golf balls. The ball
went down the throat to the stomach,
through the intestine and out—into a
toilet.
One of the contraptions answering
the problem used the power of the ball
to draw a smile on a smiling face, and
then, at the end of the path,flicked a

switch that took a photograph of the
face it had drawn.
The "leaning tower of chaos" was
over six feet tall, with the ball sliding
down a winding ramp, breaking
balloons and dropping raw eggs along
the way.
'Day In The Life'
In "A day in the life of a golf ball,"
the hero started off as all good golf
balls do, with a morning bath. This
prepared the ball for the heavy traffic it
encountered on the way to work. Work
for the golf ball was up an elevator to
the top floor of a high riss office
building. The ball went through the
everyday back and forth of a business
day. This mundane life was too much
for the ball. Before its 60 seconds were
up it was flipped out of its world by a
hand attached to a mouse trap.
The trainers of the golf balls were
arbitrarily put into groups of about
five. They could create anything they
wanted as long as they used only
mechanical devices and the ball
completed its course in a minute. One
of the creators said that a limiting
factor was that they had no finances
but their own.
Steve Tredo, one of the builders of a
structure of that used elevators,
skipped the ball across water, and
bounced it on trampolines, said that
"the project deals with organized
creativity. There is no practical
application of the project."
