## The 						Case Of Prof. Paul A. Baran 
### 
Editor's note: The following
introduction was written to
provide background information
for a two-part opinion column
starting today based on what
appears to be a recently revealed
University file on Paul Baran (see
story page 1).
In its attempted purge of Bruce
Franklin, Stanford is once again
revealing a policy it pursued eight
years ago, when the Sterling
administration tried to eliminate
Paul Baran.
Baran, a Marxist economist,
taught at Stanford from 1949
until his death in 1964. When he
publicly supported the Cuban
revolution, Stanford froze his
salary and increased his work
load, moaning that he had done
nothing to enable them to fire
him outright. Neither the
Economics Department nor the
community at large defended
Baran, and he felt alienated and
alone. "If it weren't for my
family, I would quit' literally
tomorrow," he wrote a friend,
"rather than have to tolerate
those bastards spitting in my face
all the time."
Born in the Ukraine in 1910,
Baran was educated in Germany
before WW 11. A member of the
anti-fascist left, he helped smuggle
Jews out of Germany until 1939.
Baran came to the United States
just before WW 11, and during the
War he worked for the Office of
Strategic Services as a specialist in
Polish, German, and Soviet affairs.
Immediately after the war, Baran
held posts in the U.S. Strategic
Bombing Survey and at the
Federal Reserve Bank in New
York.
At Stanford Baran earned the
reputation of being an exciting
and stimulating teacher. Upwards
of 150 people enrolled in some of
his courses. With the publication
of The Political Economy of
Growth (1957) Marxists all over
the world came to recognize
Baran's work as fundamental to
understanding underdevelopment
and American imperialism.
Business Week called him "the
only Marxist professor on the
faculty of a major U.S.
university." His posthumously
published book, Monopoly
Capitalism (written with Paul
Sweezy) has been translated into
nine languages.

Strongly critical of American
imperialism and of capitalist
society generally, Baran was
particularly disdainful of the
social scientists whom he
considered its agents. "Social
scientists were assuring us that
everything was fine," Baran
wrote. But the opposite was true
— "Idle men and idle machines
coexist with depravation at home
and starvation abroad. Poverty
grows in step with affluence."
University professors
"intellect workers" not
intellectuals — were "failing ever
more glaringly to explain social
reality." They were "the typical
faithful servants, agents, and
spokesmen of capitalist society."
Allying themselves with the ruling
class against workers, they "side
with the social order which has
given rise to their status and
which has created their
privileges."
In 1960, Fidel Castro invited
Baran and Sweezy to Cuba. When
Baran returned to Stanford, he
immediately publicized his
admiration for the Cuban
revolution. The rural population
had been "driven to revolt," he
said, by the "increasingly
insufferable state of poverty and
backwardness to which it was
condemned by the old order."
He was greatly impressed by
the changes taking place in
revolutionary Cuba. "We walked
through abysmal quarters, in
Santiago de Cuba where hovels,
the horror and sordidness and
misery of which are beyond my
powers of description, are being
torn down and replaced by
colorful little houses." Cuba's
poor, he said, were celebrating
"the dramatic resurrection of
their nation."
Baran was outraged with the
Bay of Pigs invasion and the
Cuban Missile Crisis. "There is the
frightful danger that American
capitalism, cornered, threatened,
and frightened, may be incapable
of leaving the rest of the world
alone without so slamming the
door that the entire building
collapses."
In fact, Baran predicted a
frantic U.S.-led struggle against
socialism in the Third World well
before the escalation in Vietnam.
"The real battlefields between
capitalism and socialism have for

years now been in Asia, Africa,
and Latin America." There
American imperialists would be
involved "on an increasing scale"
in the future.
To the men of wealth and
power who consider Stanford
their own turf, remarks like these
were subversive and treasonous.
The pace of letters pressuring
Stanford to get rid of Baran
increased rapidly. Administration
action against Baran followed
directly.
In a letter to Sweezy, Baran
described the situation: "Had
dinner with . He was shown
the whole mountain of
correspondence that the
administration received about you
and me and Cuba. Apparently an
impressive heap. He also saw the
more or less standard letter which
was sent the writers by the
President's office. Even he
remarked that the letter was
despicable.
"It did not point out that the
University was committed to the
principle of academic freedom or
anything of the sort, but stressed
its having the very difficult
problem of my having tenure. The

business of freezing my salary, far
from being treated as a secret, is
being widely advertised to show
that nothing would be done to
' encourage me to stay here."
Baran added that the pressure
and tension "bums me all up,
plays havoc with the nervous
system." In early 1964 he died of
a heart attack.
The response to Baran's work
has been quite a bit different in
the Third World and among the
New Left than from the men who
run Stanford. After his death, Che
Guevara wrote of "the admiration
I felt for Companero Baran, as
well as for his work on
underdevelopment which was so
constructive in our nascent and
still weak state of knowledge of
economics."
"Baran recaptured and
preserved the idea of the scholar,"
wrote Herbert Marcuse. "For him
there was no scholarship, no
intelligence that was not radically
critical of a social order that was
organized to counteract the
emergence of a humane society."
Bruce Franklin emerged as the
leading radical intellectual at
Stanford soon after Baran's death.

There was no reason to doubt that
he would suffer a fate much like
Baran's. Franklin has certainly
brought all sorts of threats from
alumni, and the Lyman
administration has worked hard to
manufacture a case which would
enable it to fire him legally, in
keeping with alumni demands and
its own liberal ideology.
Stanford is the slave of the
trustees and its rich alumni. It is
managed by the "intellect
workers" who desire only to
protect Stanford from
revolutionary intellectuals who
challenge the social order. The
defense of stagnant conservatism,
of meaningless inquiry into
unimportant truths, and the
attack on those who seek to
discover the truths that reveal the
corruption and injustice of this
society are the main
characteristics of the Stanford
system.
There are no clearer examples
of the victims of this system than
Bruce Franklin and Paul Baran.

son, and a sophomore in German.)
