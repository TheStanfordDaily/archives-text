# Academic Freedom Stanford's Myth?
## 
### 
Following are excerpts from an editorial "Freedom of Dissent
In American Society,"which appeared in the Daily April 13, 1962.
When an alumnus wants to know why Stanford doesn't fire
Baran, the University, in effect, says, "We can't." (Baran is
undoubtedly correct when he says that the University's constant
references to tenure imply he would be fired if he didn't have it.)
When Baran issues a challenging statement, the University (with a
worried eye cast toward the inevitable alumni reaction) hurriedly
arranges a speaker to oppose him. When Baran writes a letter to
The Daily, the administration encourages his colleagues, silent on
other occasions, to write letters in opposition. Baran is a member
of no University committee, though he is eminently qualified for
several. His social relations with his contemporaries are minimal
and often antagonistic. Although he is a brilliant, engaging, and
friendly personality, student-faculty gatherings with him are not
encouraged by University organizations.
This list could be extended, but the tragedy is not the personal
one of Paul Baran. He realizes, perhaps better than anyone, the
price that is paid for real, furious dissent in American society. That
his choice has been what it is, is his own greatest tribute. The
tragedy is our own. Few people can be expected willfully to
alienate themselves from society and the personally satisfying
material things of life. As long as this kind of requirement is
placed upon those who dissent we can expect our critics to be few
in number and ineffective. The bad results of this are obvious. A
society should cherish its critics. As long as it is afraid and ashamed
of them it is not mature. The same must be said of a university
which is afraid and ashamed.
