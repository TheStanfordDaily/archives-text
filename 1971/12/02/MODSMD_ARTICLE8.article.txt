## Letters Expose Anti-Communist Policy 
### 
First of two parts
In the early 1960's Stanford
found Marxist economist Paul A.
Baran a considerable
"embarrassment" to the
University. Wealthy and
influential alumni demanded the
outspoken professor be fired, and
threatened to cut off financial
support.
Stanford had a policy that
"Communists are not permitted
to hold positions on the Stanford
faculty," but because Baran said
he was a socialist, not a
communist, and because he had
tenure, the Trustees felt "we must
suffer him" until he proved an
incompetent teacher "or does
something which would warrant
termination of his employment on
other grounds."
Little or no effort was made to
defend Baran's right to remain on
the faculty in terms of academic
freedom, and Deputy Secretary
of Defense David Packard, then a
Stanford Trustee, in an

unpublished letter proposed that
Baran's salary "be reduced
proportionate to the amount
which can be clearly identified as
having come from sources other
than Capitalism."
These are some of the
revelations contained in recently
available Xerox copies of
documents which come
apparently from confidential files
in the President's Office. The
documents contain file copies of
correspondence and memos
written over the signatures of
Presidential Assistant Fred O.
Glover, Provost Emeritus
Frederick Terman, Trustees David
Packard and Morris Doyle, and of
then President J.E. Wallace
Sterling.
Many of the letters come from
well-placed alumni complaining
about Baran's public statements in
favor of the Cuban revolution or
denouncing U.S. foreign policy.
The copies apparently do not
represent a complete file.
While most of Stanford's
"embarrassment" with Baran
seems to have come after his
public support of the Cuban
revolution, he was apparently a
thorn in the Administration's
flesh as early as 1954. Among the
copied documents is an
anti-communist publication
critical of a petition signed by
Baran and nearly 200 other
educators supporting the left-wing
Jefferson School of Social
Sciences in New York (then under
McCarthy Era attack by the
Subversive Activities Control
Board).
"The only thing new in this is
that it illustrates how long
persisting is the backwash when
someone signs one of these fool
petitions," is Fred Glover's
penned comment. "Baran . . . may
give us real trouble one day."
That day came in late 1960,
apparently, when Baran and

fellow economist Paul Sweezy
visited Cuba at the invitation of
Fidel Castro himself. On his
return, Baran praised the Cuban
revolution in a public lecture in
Cubberley Auditorium. The Palo
Alto Times quoted him as saying
that Castro was "one of the
greatest men of this century."
Nationally syndicated Hearst
columnist Bob Considine picked
up the story, connecting Baran
with Stanford and calling him the
"newest cohort" in a "small but
articulate band" of American
professors supporting Castro.
Apparently these statements
raised sufficient concern among
influential alumni that Sterling
decided to hold a private
luncheon to discuss the situation.
Among the copied documents is a
guest list for the luncheon, held at
the elite Pacific-Union Club in San
Francisco March 6, 1961. Among
the guests invited were top
executives from Transamerica
Corp., Standard Oil of California
and California Casualty Indemnity
Exchange.
At the luncheon, Sterling was
apparently able to lay the alums'
fears to rest. "I am . . . most
appreciative of hearing first-hand
the situation at the Economics
Department," wrote one guest.
Another wrote that "as I reflected
on . .. what you are trying to do
to control this . .. matter, I came
to the conclusion that you are
doing a great deal and that your
approaches were practical."
When Baran spoke out against
the ClA's Bay of Pig's invasion of
Cuba in mid-April, 1961,
industrialist David Packard
decided to enter the fray.
Stanford was then in an uproar
over the Trustee's decision to
make the Hoover Institution a
semi-autonomous body under new
director W. Glenn Campbell.
Criticism was especially strong of

ex-President Herbert Hoover's
clearly political and overtly
anti-communist revision of the
Institution's governing purpose:
to "demonstrate the evils of the
doctrines of Karl Marx."
Among the copied documents
is an unpublished letter written by
Packard to the Daily.
"I am writing on the
assumption that a Trustee enjoys
the same right of free speech as a
member of the faculty or a
student, although the criticism of
Mr. Hoover for expressing his
opinion as to the purpose of the
Hoover Institution would seem to
question that assumption,"
Packard wrote.
While Baran and Sweezy's
Marxist thinking was "their right
and privilege," Packard said, "it is
certainly a violation of the
intellectual honesty expected of a
Professor ..." Packard said that
he intended to suggest to the
Trustees that Baran and Sweezy's
salaries "be reduced proportionate
to the amount which can be
clearly identified as having come
from sources other than
Capitalism."
"We would be delighted to
have these men transfer their
activities to Cuba," Packard
wrote. "They could go with the
assurance that if they ... get into
trouble we could get them back in
exchange for a couple of tractors.
In their case a couple of Sunday
Gardener's rototillers would be
about right."
Packard—or somebody in the
President's Office—apparently had
second thoughts about the letter,
and it was never sent. "I'm sure
glad he didn't send it," Glover
penned Sterling. "There are
several other paragraphs which
would have blown the place wide
open, but the Hoover statement
would have done all right oit its
own."
The sort of capitalism that
paying Baran and Sweezy's
salaries is disclosed among the
copied documents in a letter from
a Pasadena man who had retired
some months earlier as an officer
of Texaco. He enclosed a clipping
from an apparently right-wing
magazine, Facts in Education,
titled "Has Stanford No Shame?"
and critical of Baran's support of
Cuba.
The previous year, he reminded

nick bar an and david ransom

Sterling, Texaco had made
Stanford a $10,000 gift. Since
then, he said, the Cuban
government had seized Texaco
properties worth $50 million.
The President's Office tried to
calm the critic's anger and offer,
perhaps, some consolation.
University relations officer Don
Carlson wrote that "barbed"
questions had driven Baran into
calling Castro one of the century's
greatest men. "I doubt if he
enjoyed the harrassment he has
received because of it," Carlson
wrote. "Shortly after that speech
he had a serious heart attack."
Carlson tried to make
University policy quite clear. "I
know that we would agree that
Communism is the very antithesis
of freedom, academic or
otherwise," he wrote. "This is
why Communists are not
permitted to hold positions on the
Stanford faculty." Baran was not
a communist but a socialist,
Carlson said.
"The overwhelming majority
of professors at this university are
actively engaged in the
explanation and repudiation of
Communism and Marxist
ideologies," wrote University
Relations officer Robert E. Miller,
Jr., to another alum.
Baran's standing with the
President's Office did not better
when he spoke on Cuba in Los
Angeles the night before the 1961
USC game. Apparently, several
highly-placed alums attended his
talk and were not amused.
Among the copied documents
is a letter from Stanford's
Southern California public
relations man to University
Relations director Lyle Nelson
saying that one couple who
attended "feel that Stanford has
no business having a man like
Baran on its faculty." Their
parents had given a dorm to
Occidental College, he says, and
"it was hoped they were getting a
possible interest in Stanford."
At the time, Daily editor Ron
Rapoport was shown at least a
portion of the University file on
Baran, and in a series of articles
about right-wing pressure on
Stanford, he quoted at length
from the University replies. In one
reply, he said, Sterling quoted
what Rapoport called the
"University's policy on
Communists on the faculty":
While membership in any lawful
organization was "not, itself,
grounds for disciplinary action,"
nonetheless a member of the
Communist Party was "subject to
a discipline that is inconsistent
with professional integrity and
competence, and with academic
freedom and
responsibility . . . and is,
therefore, unfit to serve on the
Stanford Faculty."
Baran told Rapoport that
Sterling had called him to his
office after the Cubberley speech.
"His main point was to ask me if I
was a member of the Communist
Party. I repeated to him that I
wasn't. I had told him so before."
Baran had been proposed for a
raise by his department, Rapoport
says, but the administration had
refused it. "Baran says he has
reason to believe that it was
because of his statements on
Cuba."

German. David Ransom is a
freelance journalist and a member
of Venceremos.)

decided to enter the fray.
Stanford was then in an uproar
over the Trustee's decision to
make the Hoover Institution a
semi-autonomous body under new
director W. Glenn Campbell.
Criticism was especially strong of

ex-President Herbert Hoover's
clearly political and overtly
anti-communist revision of the
Institution's governing purpose:
to "demonstrate the evils of the
doctrines of Karl Marx."
Among the copied documents
is an unpublished letter written by
Packard to the Daily.
"I am writing on the
assumption that a Trustee enjoys
the same right of free speech as a
member of the faculty or a
student, although the criticism of
Mr. Hoover for expressing his
opinion as to the purpose of the
Hoover Institution would seem to
question that assumption,"
Packard wrote.
While Baran and Sweezy's
Marxist thinking was "their right
and privilege," Packard said, "it is
certainly a violation of the
intellectual honesty expected of a
Professor ..." Packard said that
he intended to suggest to the
Trustees that Baran and Sweezy's
salaries "be reduced proportionate
to the amount which can be
clearly identified as having come
from sources other than
Capitalism."
"We would be delighted to
have these men transfer their
activities to Cuba," Packard
wrote. "They could go with the
assurance that if they ... get into
trouble we could get them back in
exchange for a couple of tractors.
In their case a couple of Sunday
Gardener's rototillers would be
about right."
Packard—or somebody in the
President's Office—apparently had
second thoughts about the letter,
and it was never sent. "I'm sure
glad he didn't send it," Glover
penned Sterling. "There are
several other paragraphs which
would have blown the place wide
open, but the Hoover statement
would have done all right oit its
own."
The sort of capitalism that
paying Baran and Sweezy's
salaries is disclosed among the
copied documents in a letter from
a Pasadena man who had retired
some months earlier as an officer
of Texaco. He enclosed a clipping
from an apparently right-wing
magazine, Facts in Education,
titled "Has Stanford No Shame?"
and critical of Baran's support of
Cuba.
The previous year, he reminded

nick bar an and david ransom

Sterling, Texaco had made
Stanford a $10,000 gift. Since
then, he said, the Cuban
government had seized Texaco
properties worth $50 million.
The President's Office tried to
calm the critic's anger and offer,
perhaps, some consolation.
University relations officer Don
Carlson wrote that "barbed"
questions had driven Baran into
calling Castro one of the century's
greatest men. "I doubt if he
enjoyed the harrassment he has
received because of it," Carlson
wrote. "Shortly after that speech
he had a serious heart attack."
Carlson tried to make
University policy quite clear. "I
know that we would agree that
Communism is the very antithesis
of freedom, academic or
otherwise," he wrote. "This is
why Communists are not
permitted to hold positions on the
Stanford faculty." Baran was not
a communist but a socialist,
Carlson said.
"The overwhelming majority
of professors at this university are
actively engaged in the
explanation and repudiation of
Communism and Marxist
ideologies," wrote University
Relations officer Robert E. Miller,
Jr., to another alum.
Baran's standing with the
President's Office did not better
when he spoke on Cuba in Los
Angeles the night before the 1961
USC game. Apparently, several
highly-placed alums attended his
talk and were not amused.
Among the copied documents
is a letter from Stanford's
Southern California public
relations man to University
Relations director Lyle Nelson
saying that one couple who
attended "feel that Stanford has
no business having a man like
Baran on its faculty." Their
parents had given a dorm to
Occidental College, he says, and
"it was hoped they were getting a
possible interest in Stanford."
At the time, Daily editor Ron
Rapoport was shown at least a
portion of the University file on
Baran, and in a series of articles
about right-wing pressure on
Stanford, he quoted at length
from the University replies. In one
reply, he said, Sterling quoted
what Rapoport called the
"University's policy on
Communists on the faculty":
While membership in any lawful
organization was "not, itself,
grounds for disciplinary action,"
nonetheless a member of the
Communist Party was "subject to
a discipline that is inconsistent
with professional integrity and
competence, and with academic
freedom and
responsibility . . . and is,
therefore, unfit to serve on the
Stanford Faculty."
Baran told Rapoport that
Sterling had called him to his
office after the Cubberley speech.
"His main point was to ask me if I
was a member of the Communist
Party. I repeated to him that I
wasn't. I had told him so before."
Baran had been proposed for a
raise by his department, Rapoport
says, but the administration had
refused it. "Baran says he has
reason to believe that it was
because of his statements on
Cuba."
(Nick Baran is a sophomore in
German. David Ransom is a
freelance journalist and a member
of Venceremos.)
First of two parts
In the early 1960's Stanford
found Marxist economist Paul A.
Baran a considerable
"embarrassment" to the
University. Wealthy and
influential alumni demanded the
outspoken professor be fired, and
threatened to cut off financial
support.
Stanford had a policy that
"Communists are not permitted
to hold positions on the Stanford
faculty," but because Baran said
he was a socialist, not a
communist, and because he had
tenure, the Trustees felt "we must
suffer him" until he proved an
incompetent teacher "or does
something which would warrant
termination of his employment on
other grounds."
Little or no effort was made to
defend Baran's right to remain on
the faculty in terms of academic
freedom, and Deputy Secretary
of Defense David Packard, then a
Stanford Trustee, in an

unpublished letter proposed that
Baran's salary "be reduced
proportionate to the amount
which can be clearly identified as
having come from sources other
than Capitalism."
These are some of the
revelations contained in recently
available Xerox copies of
documents which come
apparently from confidential files
in the President's Office. The
documents contain file copies of
correspondence and memos
written over the signatures of
Presidential Assistant Fred O.
Glover, Provost Emeritus
Frederick Terman, Trustees David
Packard and Morris Doyle, and of
then President J.E. Wallace
Sterling.
Many of the letters come from
well-placed alumni complaining
about Baran's public statements in
favor of the Cuban revolution or
denouncing U.S. foreign policy.
The copies apparently do not
represent a complete file.
While most of Stanford's
"embarrassment" with Baran
seems to have come after his
public support of the Cuban
revolution, he was apparently a
thorn in the Administration's
flesh as early as 1954. Among the
copied documents is an
anti-communist publication
critical of a petition signed by
Baran and nearly 200 other
educators supporting the left-wing
Jefferson School of Social
Sciences in New York (then under
McCarthy Era attack by the
Subversive Activities Control
Board).
"The only thing new in this is
that it illustrates how long
persisting is the backwash when
someone signs one of these fool
petitions," is Fred Glover's
penned comment. "Baran . . . may
give us real trouble one day."
That day came in late 1960,
apparently, when Baran and

fellow economist Paul Sweezy
visited Cuba at the invitation of
Fidel Castro himself. On his
return, Baran praised the Cuban
revolution in a public lecture in
Cubberley Auditorium. The Palo
Alto Times quoted him as saying
that Castro was "one of the
greatest men of this century."
Nationally syndicated Hearst
columnist Bob Considine picked
up the story, connecting Baran
with Stanford and calling him the
"newest cohort" in a "small but
articulate band" of American
professors supporting Castro.
Apparently these statements
raised sufficient concern among
influential alumni that Sterling
decided to hold a private
luncheon to discuss the situation.
Among the copied documents is a
guest list for the luncheon, held at
the elite Pacific-Union Club in San
Francisco March 6, 1961. Among
the guests invited were top
executives from Transamerica
Corp., Standard Oil of California
and California Casualty Indemnity
Exchange.
At the luncheon, Sterling was
apparently able to lay the alums'
fears to rest. "I am . . . most
appreciative of hearing first-hand
the situation at the Economics
Department," wrote one guest.
Another wrote that "as I reflected
on . .. what you are trying to do
to control this . .. matter, I came
to the conclusion that you are
doing a great deal and that your
approaches were practical."
When Baran spoke out against
the ClA's Bay of Pig's invasion of
Cuba in mid-April, 1961,
industrialist David Packard
decided to enter the fray.
Stanford was then in an uproar
over the Trustee's decision to
make the Hoover Institution a

Occidental College, he says, and
"it was hoped they were getting a
possible interest in Stanford."
At the time, Daily editor Ron
Rapoport was shown at least a
portion of the University file on
Baran, and in a series of articles
about right-wing pressure on
Stanford, he quoted at length
from the University replies. In one
reply, he said, Sterling quoted
what Rapoport called the
"University's policy on
Communists on the faculty":
While membership in any lawful
organization was "not, itself,
grounds for disciplinary action,"
nonetheless a member of the
Communist Party was "subject to
a discipline that is inconsistent
with professional integrity and
competence, and with academic
freedom and
responsibility . . . and is,
therefore, unfit to serve on the
Stanford Faculty."
Baran told Rapoport that
Sterling had called him to his
office after the Cubberley speech.
"His main point was to ask me if I
was a member of the Communist
Party. I repeated to him that I
wasn't. I had told him so before."
Baran had been proposed for a
raise by his department, Rapoport
says, but the administration had
refused it. "Baran says he has
reason to believe that it was
because of his statements on
Cuba."

German. David Ransom is a

of Venceremos.)
First of two parts
In the early 1960's Stanford
found Marxist economist Paul A.
Baran a considerable
"embarrassment" to the
University. Wealthy and
influential alumni demanded the
outspoken professor be fired, and
threatened to cut off financial
support.
Stanford had a policy that
"Communists are not permitted
to hold positions on the Stanford
faculty," but because Baran said
he was a socialist, not a
communist, and because he had
tenure, the Trustees felt "we must
suffer him" until he proved an
incompetent teacher "or does
something which would warrant
termination of his employment on
other grounds."
Little or no effort was made to
defend Baran's right to remain on
the faculty in terms of academic
freedom, and Deputy Secretary
of Defense David Packard, then a
Stanford Trustee, in an

unpublished letter proposed that
Baran's salary "be reduced
proportionate to the amount
which can be clearly identified as
having come from sources other
than Capitalism."
These are some of the
revelations contained in recently
available Xerox copies of
documents which come
apparently from confidential files
in the President's Office. The
documents contain file copies of
correspondence and memos
written over the signatures of
Presidential Assistant Fred O.
Glover, Provost Emeritus
Frederick Terman, Trustees David
Packard and Morris Doyle, and of
then President J.E. Wallace
Sterling.
Many of the letters come from
well-placed alumni complaining
about Baran's public statements in
favor of the Cuban revolution or
denouncing U.S. foreign policy.
The copies apparently do not
represent a complete file.
While most of Stanford's
"embarrassment" with Baran
seems to have come after his
public support of the Cuban
revolution, he was apparently a
thorn in the Administration's
flesh as early as 1954. Among the
copied documents is an
anti-communist publication
critical of a petition signed by
Baran and nearly 200 other
educators supporting the left-wing
Jefferson School of Social
Sciences in New York (then under
McCarthy Era attack by the
Subversive Activities Control
Board).
"The only thing new in this is
that it illustrates how long
persisting is the backwash when
someone signs one of these fool
petitions," is Fred Glover's
penned comment. "Baran . . . may
give us real trouble one day."
That day came in late 1960,
apparently, when Baran and

fellow economist Paul Sweezy
visited Cuba at the invitation of
Fidel Castro himself. On his
return, Baran praised the Cuban
revolution in a public lecture in
Cubberley Auditorium. The Palo
Alto Times quoted him as saying
that Castro was "one of the
greatest men of this century."
Nationally syndicated Hearst
columnist Bob Considine picked
up the story, connecting Baran
with Stanford and calling him the
"newest cohort" in a "small but
articulate band" of American
professors supporting Castro.
Apparently these statements
raised sufficient concern among
influential alumni that Sterling
decided to hold a private
luncheon to discuss the situation.
Among the copied documents is a
guest list for the luncheon, held at
the elite Pacific-Union Club in San
Francisco March 6, 1961. Among
the guests invited were top
executives from Transamerica
Corp., Standard Oil of California
and California Casualty Indemnity
Exchange.
At the luncheon, Sterling was
apparently able to lay the alums'
fears to rest. "I am . . . most
appreciative of hearing first-hand
the situation at the Economics
Department," wrote one guest.
Another wrote that "as I reflected
on . .. what you are trying to do
to control this . .. matter, I came
to the conclusion that you are
doing a great deal and that your
approaches were practical."
When Baran spoke out against
the ClA's Bay of Pig's invasion of
Cuba in mid-April, 1961,
industrialist David Packard
decided to enter the fray.
Stanford was then in an uproar
over the Trustee's decision to
make the Hoover Institution a
semi-autonomous body under new
director W. Glenn Campbell.
Criticism was especially strong of

ex-President Herbert Hoover's
clearly political and overtly
anti-communist revision of the
Institution's governing purpose:
to "demonstrate the evils of the
doctrines of Karl Marx."
Among the copied documents
is an unpublished letter written by
Packard to the Daily.
"I am writing on the
assumption that a Trustee enjoys
the same right of free speech as a
member of the faculty or a
student, although the criticism of
Mr. Hoover for expressing his
opinion as to the purpose of the
Hoover Institution would seem to
question that assumption,"
Packard wrote.
While Baran and Sweezy's
Marxist thinking was "their right
and privilege," Packard said, "it is
certainly a violation of the
intellectual honesty expected of a
Professor ..." Packard said that
he intended to suggest to the
Trustees that Baran and Sweezy's
salaries "be reduced proportionate
to the amount which can be
clearly identified as having come
from sources other than
Capitalism."
"We would be delighted to
have these men transfer their
activities to Cuba," Packard
wrote. "They could go with the
assurance that if they ... get into
trouble we could get them back in
exchange for a couple of tractors.
In their case a couple of Sunday
Gardener's rototillers would be
about right."
Packard—or somebody in the
President's Office—apparently had
second thoughts about the letter,
and it was never sent. "I'm sure
glad he didn't send it," Glover
penned Sterling. "There are
several other paragraphs which
would have blown the place wide
open, but the Hoover statement
would have done all right oit its
own."
The sort of capitalism that
paying Baran and Sweezy's
salaries is disclosed among the
copied documents in a letter from
a Pasadena man who had retired
some months earlier as an officer
of Texaco. He enclosed a clipping
from an apparently right-wing
magazine, Facts in Education,
titled "Has Stanford No Shame?"
and critical of Baran's support of
Cuba.
The previous year, he reminded

nick bar an and david ransom

Sterling, Texaco had made
Stanford a $10,000 gift. Since
then, he said, the Cuban
government had seized Texaco
properties worth $50 million.
The President's Office tried to
calm the critic's anger and offer,
perhaps, some consolation.
University relations officer Don
Carlson wrote that "barbed"
questions had driven Baran into
calling Castro one of the century's
greatest men. "I doubt if he
enjoyed the harrassment he has
received because of it," Carlson
wrote. "Shortly after that speech
he had a serious heart attack."
Carlson tried to make
University policy quite clear. "I
know that we would agree that
Communism is the very antithesis
of freedom, academic or
otherwise," he wrote. "This is
why Communists are not
permitted to hold positions on the
Stanford faculty." Baran was not
a communist but a socialist,
Carlson said.
"The overwhelming majority
of professors at this university are
actively engaged in the
explanation and repudiation of
Communism and Marxist
ideologies," wrote University
Relations officer Robert E. Miller,
Jr., to another alum.
Baran's standing with the
President's Office did not better
when he spoke on Cuba in Los
Angeles the night before the 1961
USC game. Apparently, several
highly-placed alums attended his
talk and were not amused.
Among the copied documents
is a letter from Stanford's
Southern California public
relations man to University
Relations director Lyle Nelson
saying that one couple who
attended "feel that Stanford has
no business having a man like
Baran on its faculty." Their
parents had given a dorm to
Occidental College, he says, and
"it was hoped they were getting a
possible interest in Stanford."
At the time, Daily editor Ron

return, Baran praised the Cuban
revolution in a public lecture in
Cubberley Auditorium. The Palo
Alto Times quoted him as saying
that Castro was "one of the
greatest men of this century."
Nationally syndicated Hearst
columnist Bob Considine picked
up the story, connecting Baran
with Stanford and calling him the
"newest cohort" in a "small but
articulate band" of American
professors supporting Castro.
Apparently these statements
raised sufficient concern among
influential alumni that Sterling
decided to hold a private
luncheon to discuss the situation.
Among the copied documents is a
guest list for the luncheon, held at
the elite Pacific-Union Club in San
Francisco March 6, 1961. Among
the guests invited were top
executives from Transamerica
Corp., Standard Oil of California
and California Casualty Indemnity
Exchange.
At the luncheon, Sterling was
apparently able to lay the alums'
fears to rest. "I am . . . most
appreciative of hearing first-hand
the situation at the Economics
Department," wrote one guest.
Another wrote that "as I reflected
on . .. what you are trying to do
to control this . .. matter, I came
to the conclusion that you are
doing a great deal and that your
approaches were practical."
When Baran spoke out against
the ClA's Bay of Pig's invasion of
Cuba in mid-April, 1961,
industrialist David Packard
decided to enter the fray.
Stanford was then in an uproar
over the Trustee's decision to
make the Hoover Institution a
semi-autonomous body under new
director W. Glenn Campbell.
Criticism was especially strong of

ex-President Herbert Hoover's
clearly political and overtly
anti-communist revision of the
Institution's governing purpose:
to "demonstrate the evils of the
doctrines of Karl Marx."
Among the copied documents
is an unpublished letter written by
Packard to the Daily.
"I am writing on the
assumption that a Trustee enjoys
the same right of free speech as a
member of the faculty or a
student, although the criticism of
Mr. Hoover for expressing his
opinion as to the purpose of the
Hoover Institution would seem to
question that assumption,"
Packard wrote.
While Baran and Sweezy's
Marxist thinking was "their right
and privilege," Packard said, "it is
certainly a violation of the
intellectual honesty expected of a
Professor ..." Packard said that
he intended to suggest to the
Trustees that Baran and Sweezy's
salaries "be reduced proportionate
to the amount which can be
clearly identified as having come
from sources other than
Capitalism."
"We would be delighted to
have these men transfer their
activities to Cuba," Packard
wrote. "They could go with the
assurance that if they ... get into
trouble we could get them back in
exchange for a couple of tractors.
In their case a couple of Sunday
Gardener's rototillers would be
about right."
Packard—or somebody in the
President's Office—apparently had
second thoughts about the letter,
and it was never sent. "I'm sure
glad he didn't send it," Glover
penned Sterling. "There are
several other paragraphs which
would have blown the place wide
open, but the Hoover statement
would have done all right oit its
own."
The sort of capitalism that
paying Baran and Sweezy's
salaries is disclosed among the
copied documents in a letter from
a Pasadena man who had retired
some months earlier as an officer
of Texaco. He enclosed a clipping
from an apparently right-wing
magazine, Facts in Education,
titled "Has Stanford No Shame?"
and critical of Baran's support of
Cuba.
The previous year, he reminded

nick bar an and david ransom

Sterling, Texaco had made
Stanford a $10,000 gift. Since
then, he said, the Cuban
government had seized Texaco
properties worth $50 million.
The President's Office tried to
calm the critic's anger and offer,
perhaps, some consolation.
University relations officer Don
Carlson wrote that "barbed"
questions had driven Baran into
calling Castro one of the century's
greatest men. "I doubt if he
enjoyed the harrassment he has
received because of it," Carlson
wrote. "Shortly after that speech
he had a serious heart attack."
Carlson tried to make
University policy quite clear. "I
know that we would agree that
Communism is the very antithesis
of freedom, academic or
otherwise," he wrote. "This is
why Communists are not
permitted to hold positions on the
Stanford faculty." Baran was not
a communist but a socialist,
Carlson said.
"The overwhelming majority
of professors at this university are
actively engaged in the
explanation and repudiation of
Communism and Marxist
ideologies," wrote University
Relations officer Robert E. Miller,
Jr., to another alum.
Baran's standing with the
President's Office did not better
when he spoke on Cuba in Los
Angeles the night before the 1961
USC game. Apparently, several
highly-placed alums attended his
talk and were not amused.
Among the copied documents
is a letter from Stanford's
Southern California public
relations man to University
Relations director Lyle Nelson
saying that one couple who
attended "feel that Stanford has
no business having a man like
Baran on its faculty." Their
parents had given a dorm to
Occidental College, he says, and
"it was hoped they were getting a
possible interest in Stanford."
At the time, Daily editor Ron
Rapoport was shown at least a
portion of the University file on
Baran, and in a series of articles
about right-wing pressure on
Stanford, he quoted at length
from the University replies. In one
reply, he said, Sterling quoted
what Rapoport called the
"University's policy on
Communists on the faculty":
While membership in any lawful
organization was "not, itself,
grounds for disciplinary action,"
nonetheless a member of the
Communist Party was "subject to
a discipline that is inconsistent
with professional integrity and
competence, and with academic
freedom and
responsibility . . . and is,
therefore, unfit to serve on the
Stanford Faculty."
Baran told Rapoport that
Sterling had called him to his
office after the Cubberley speech.
"His main point was to ask me if I
was a member of the Communist
Party. I repeated to him that I
wasn't. I had told him so before."
Baran had been proposed for a
raise by his department, Rapoport
says, but the administration had
refused it. "Baran says he has
reason to believe that it was
because of his statements on
Cuba."
(Nick Baran is a sophomore in
German. David Ransom is a
freelance journalist and a member
of Venceremos.)
First of two parts
In the early 1960's Stanford
found Marxist economist Paul A.
Baran a considerable
"embarrassment" to the
University. Wealthy and
influential alumni demanded the
outspoken professor be fired, and
threatened to cut off financial
support.
Stanford had a policy that
"Communists are not permitted
to hold positions on the Stanford
faculty," but because Baran said
he was a socialist, not a
communist, and because he had
tenure, the Trustees felt "we must
suffer him" until he proved an
incompetent teacher "or does
something which would warrant
termination of his employment on
other grounds."
Little or no effort was made to
defend Baran's right to remain on
the faculty in terms of academic
freedom, and Deputy Secretary
of Defense David Packard, then a
Stanford Trustee, in an

unpublished letter proposed that
Baran's salary "be reduced
proportionate to the amount
which can be clearly identified as
having come from sources other
than Capitalism."
These are some of the
revelations contained in recently
available Xerox copies of
documents which come
apparently from confidential files
in the President's Office. The
documents contain file copies of
correspondence and memos
written over the signatures of
Presidential Assistant Fred O.
Glover, Provost Emeritus
Frederick Terman, Trustees David
Packard and Morris Doyle, and of
then President J.E. Wallace
Sterling.
Many of the letters come from
well-placed alumni complaining
about Baran's public statements in
favor of the Cuban revolution or
denouncing U.S. foreign policy.
The copies apparently do not
represent a complete file.
While most of Stanford's
"embarrassment" with Baran
seems to have come after his
public support of the Cuban
revolution, he was apparently a
thorn in the Administration's
flesh as early as 1954. Among the
copied documents is an
anti-communist publication
critical of a petition signed by
Baran and nearly 200 other
educators supporting the left-wing
Jefferson School of Social
Sciences in New York (then under
McCarthy Era attack by the
Subversive Activities Control
Board).
"The only thing new in this is
that it illustrates how long
persisting is the backwash when
someone signs one of these fool
petitions," is Fred Glover's
penned comment. "Baran . . . may
give us real trouble one day."
That day came in late 1960,
apparently, when Baran and

fellow economist Paul Sweezy
visited Cuba at the invitation of
Fidel Castro himself. On his
return, Baran praised the Cuban
revolution in a public lecture in
Cubberley Auditorium. The Palo
Alto Times quoted him as saying
that Castro was "one of the
greatest men of this century."

perhaps, some consolation.
University relations officer Don
Carlson wrote that "barbed"
questions had driven Baran into
calling Castro one of the century's
greatest men. "I doubt if he
enjoyed the harrassment he has
received because of it," Carlson
wrote. "Shortly after that speech
he had a serious heart attack."
Carlson tried to make
University policy quite clear. "I
know that we would agree that
Communism is the very antithesis
of freedom, academic or
otherwise," he wrote. "This is
why Communists are not
permitted to hold positions on the
Stanford faculty." Baran was not
a communist but a socialist,
Carlson said.
"The overwhelming majority
of professors at this university are
actively engaged in the
explanation and repudiation of
Communism and Marxist
ideologies," wrote University
Relations officer Robert E. Miller,
Jr., to another alum.
Baran's standing with the
President's Office did not better
when he spoke on Cuba in Los
Angeles the night before the 1961
USC game. Apparently, several
highly-placed alums attended his
talk and were not amused.
Among the copied documents
is a letter from Stanford's
Southern California public
relations man to University
Relations director Lyle Nelson
saying that one couple who
attended "feel that Stanford has
no business having a man like
Baran on its faculty." Their
parents had given a dorm to
Occidental College, he says, and
"it was hoped they were getting a
possible interest in Stanford."
At the time, Daily editor Ron
Rapoport was shown at least a
portion of the University file on
Baran, and in a series of articles
about right-wing pressure on
Stanford, he quoted at length
from the University replies. In one
reply, he said, Sterling quoted
what Rapoport called the
"University's policy on
Communists on the faculty":
While membership in any lawful
organization was "not, itself,
grounds for disciplinary action,"
nonetheless a member of the
Communist Party was "subject to
a discipline that is inconsistent
with professional integrity and
competence, and with academic
freedom and
responsibility . . . and is,
therefore, unfit to serve on the
Stanford Faculty."
Baran told Rapoport that
Sterling had called him to his
office after the Cubberley speech.
"His main point was to ask me if I
was a member of the Communist
Party. I repeated to him that I
wasn't. I had told him so before."
Baran had been proposed for a
raise by his department, Rapoport
says, but the administration had
refused it. "Baran says he has
reason to believe that it was
because of his statements on
Cuba."
