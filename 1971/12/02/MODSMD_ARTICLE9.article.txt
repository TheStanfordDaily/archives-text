## Advertising Standards 
### 
You can tell the ideals of a nation by its
advertisements.
Norman Douglas
South Wind, chapter 7
Everyday, on television screens, billboards, and
the pages of newspapers and magazines, the truth of
Douglas' statement of 1917 is sadly reaffirmed.
There are companies and businesses out to make a
profit any way they can that all too often disregard
any type of ethical standards, and capitalize through
exploitation, deceit, and use of unfair stereotypes.
We feel we have been, at times, the victim of this
type of approach. Readers of the Daily can no
doubt single out ads during the quarter which have
approached the selling of a product in a manner
offensive to them.
Like most college newspapers, the Daily has
never established an adequate policy to deal with all
the problems advertising presents. We are
attempting to change that lack of precedent.
Just as the Daily attempts to maintain a high
level of truth, fairness, and reliability in its news
copy through a process of editing and selectivity of
stories, so do we wish to apply the same standards
to the ads that run along side the news. But any
attempt to ban ads that might be deemed racist,
sexist, or in extremely poor taste to a large segment
of the Stanford community runs into troubles of its
own.
Any restrictive policy involves making subjective
judgments. Suddenly the staff of the newspaper
becomes a ccnsor, a protector of the sensitivities of
our readership.
A completely "open" policy could easily place
the Daily in serious legal and financial jeopardy
through the publication of fraudulent or libellous

ads, and through the possible displeasure of regular
advertisers who might drop their aecounts for fear
ot association with a disreputable company or
organization.
We feel that the inconsistency of maintaining a
high standard tor news copy while allowing
anything that is paid for to run in the paper is
untenable and unwise.
As a result, we have decided to implement a
policy whereby all advertisements will be reviewed
before publication by a five member board
including the editor-in-chief and business manager
of the Daily. Following a "hands-off" policy as
much as possible, the board will recommend to the
advertiser that the approach of any ad found
objectionable be changed. If the recommendation is
rejected, the board will make the final decision on
whether or not to publish the ad.
The Advertising Code of American Business,
adopted in 1964, and endorsed by over 300,000
individuals and corporations, has been promptly
forgotten by too many of them. One of the nine
points which made up the self-censorship agreement
states, "Advertising shall be free of statements,
illustrations or implications which are offensive to
good taste or public decency."
The terms are vague, but the meaning is clear.
The public should be the first concern of the
mass media, and we realize that our readership is
affected by the advertisements in the Daily as well
as the news. Those supporting the paper are not
paying their money to be insulted or exploited by
advertisers. We trust the Daily's advertising review
group, using their power sparingly but responsibly,
will adequately reflect the concern voiced by many
of those upset with the means of persuasion used in
some of the paper's advertisements.
