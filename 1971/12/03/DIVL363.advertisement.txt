The pen with
a point of
ilk difference
PARKER
This is the pen Vj,
you can't hold vx
wrong. The
contoured grip
shows your
fingers where to
hold. It's the only
pen in America
whose point turns to
the exact angle right
for you. However you
hold the pen in your
hand, the point always
lies flat, always writes \l^\
smooth. Sterling silver
case. A very special gift. $25.
