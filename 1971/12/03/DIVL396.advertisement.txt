'EURIPIDES. WITH TEARS IN ONE'S EYES..."
' By Eugene lonesco
"I have just seen The Trojan Women,' the new Michael Cacoyan
nis film. The tragic grandeur of Euripides is rendered to the t».*!!
both pictorially and vocally.
How many directors have gone ahead and demolished the
greatest monuments in literature, in drama'ic art, in order to
'modernize' them according to their own poor taste. Cacoyannis
does not cheat. By being true to Euripides what he shows us,
what he makes us understand is the most actual of humanity's
tragedies. . . the most contemporary, the most true of our past
and most permanently real.
The film is harsh, simple, true. Cacoyannis leaves the word to
Euripides, the text grips us with the same force as the sublime
beauty of the images, stark, violent against the nudity of the
landscape, it all leaps into our eyes and the greatness of the
work invades us, the evidence of our tragic existence is revealed
to us, clearly, from the beginning right through to the end.
That our existence should be tragic, that the war that man
wages against man should be part of our destiny and at the
same time that this eternal tragedy should be so great, is the
paradoxical comfort that we draw from watching this film. I
came out a happy man. Reprinted from Le Figaro, Paris
