And how to save money with...
SPECIAL SKI TOURS.
TWA has someof the lowestpricedskitours to Vail, Aspen, and Steamboat.
Or if you want to ski the Alps, take a TWA tour. It saves you over 50% of
the cost of travelling alone.
The kit also tells you how to get a...
GETAWAYCARD.
You'll receive an application blank. There's no minimum income require
ment. And no yearly maintenance fee.
Use your Getaway Card to charge airfare, Stutelpasses, tours, almost
everything. And then take up to two years to pay.
Now what's even easier than getting away for the holidays, is getting a
Getaway Kit.
Just use the coupon.
