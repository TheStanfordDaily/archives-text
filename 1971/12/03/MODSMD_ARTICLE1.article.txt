# 'Perverts Academic Freedom'
## SWOPSI Study Hits DoD Funding 
### PHIL REVZIN 
"By seeking [Department of
Defense] funding, the University has
perverted academic freedom over the
last twenty-five years," according to a
report released today by members of a
Stanford Workshop on Political and
Social Issues (SWOPSI) class studying
research at Stanford.
The 117 page report, Volume II of
"DoD Sponsored Research at
Stanford," goes on to say that
"Stanford's fiscal policies, combined
with the DoD's well-managed program
of supporting research and
development with high military
potential, have skewed the academic
development of significant portions of
the University, particularly
Engineering, Applied Physics, and
Computer Science."
The study deals extensively with the
connections between Stanford and
governmental funding agencies, dating
from 1946, when DoD contracts were

first awarded to Stanford researchers.
The report comments that the
University has grown dependent on
outside funding, and would face grave
financial problems if such funding were
to be removed.
Volume I, issued during the summer,
contained descriptions of DoD funded
projects by the principal investigators
and the Defense Department.
University Responsibility
Stanton Glantz, head of the group
which prepared the report, said at a
press conference yesterday that "It is
the responsibility of Stanford
University to undo the policies it has
developed, and to reestablish academic
freedom here." Glantz said he hoped
that a task force could be established to
study the problems, and that one of the
main functions of the SWOPSI study
was to make the University community
aware that problems exist.
Also at the press conference,
Engineering Dean Joseph Petitt said

that "while the area is worthwhile to
look into, you can focus on anything
and present it so that it takes on
qualities it really doesn't have."
The report states that "apologists for
Defense funding have maintained that
there is sufficient overlap between the
objectives of the Defense Department
and the University to justify this
funding; that since most of the
proposals are initiated by faculty
members, the faculty keeps control of
the research and development being
done at Stanford.
Well-Organized
"The Defense Department's
university programs, however, are well
organized and well administered to
support the Armed Service's
missions . . . Although proposals for
research contracts may reflect the wide
range of interests of scientific and
engineering scholars, the Defense
Department... can decide what is
studied and what is not.. .
"DoD need not coerce individual
faculty to work in areas of military
technology: indeed, almost all the
proposals DoD receives are unsolicited.
Since the DoD receives four to ten
times as many proposals as it can fund,
it merely selects those projects which
fit its needs."
Researchers have said that the
so-called Mansfield Amendment to the
Military Procurement Bill of 1970,
which said that projects funded by the
military must have military
significance, in part caused the
discrepencies between the investigator's
and the military's descriptions of the
nature of the research.
No Effect
The report says, "While the
Mansfield Amendment forced the DoD
to more carefully delineate the military
relevance of defense research projects,
it did not significantly affect the nature
of the work being done at Stanford

under DoD sponsorship.
"Most of the current contracts date
from long before the Mansfield
amendment, and have met, and do
meet, its test of having a direct and
apparent relationship to a specific
military function or operation."
The report adds that many science
faculty members are expected to obtain
support money for their research
through outside funding agencies. The
University receives this money through
cost recovery charges for use of
University facilities, and salary offsets.
Salary offsets provide the portion of a
professor's salary equivalent to the time
he is spending on his sponsored
research project, and are essential to
the operation of the University,
according to the report.
Financial Necessity
If all sponsored research were
immediately terminated, "the
University would lose roughly $50
million worth of sponsored projects.
Most non-tenured personnel involved
(including many graduate students)
would be laid off.. . 2000 employees
would be fired as a direct result of the
termination. Furthermore, $11 million
in indirect cost recovery would vanish,
and all tenured faculty taking offsets
would return to full pay status,
increasing the financial burden by
another $3 million ... If spending were
not cut drastically, the $5 million
savings account would evaporate in
four months, and consumption of the
endowment would begin."
If only DoD sponsored projects were
immediately terminated, 600 jobs
would be lost, and the reserve account
would last 12 months, according to the
report.
The report cites financial pressures
on faculty and graduate students as
forcing them to "study problems
selected by the funding agencies,
contrary to the responsibility of the
free academician solely to pursue the
leadings of his curiosity."
Important Constraint
Based on a questionaire distributed
during the preparation of Volume I, the
report notes that "the most important
constraint on the freedom to choose
research problems indicated by the
researchers was lack of funds from
agencies other than the DoD ... We
conclude that to the extent
significantly different research would
be done by 35 percent of those
responding, dominance of DoD funding
inhibits the free exercise of research
choice ... Few respondents listed
community pressures as a significant
restraint on their freedom to choose
problems."

DOD FUNDING CRITIC—Stan Glantz, a co-author of the two volume SWOPSI
report on DoD Sponsored Research here, presented the report's analysis of
funding at a press conference yesterday. The report claims that most of the
current DoD contracts meet the test of a direct and apparent relationship to a
specific military function or operation.
The report says that researchers who
state that "my research is not dictated
by any military problem, nor modified
in any way by the government, ignore
the fact that DoD funds their research
because it contributes .xplicity to
solving a military problem . . . The DoD
funds research not merely to build a
generally strong technology base for
the nation, but to develop technical
capabilities needed for its current and
projected operational requirements.
Each Stanford research contract is
linked to, and ultimately justified by,
such requirements."
The report explains that before the
DoD will fund any projects, a Defense
Department research monitor must
"declare that a proposal promises to
fulfill some technical requirement listed
in the classified Technical Objectives
Document when he recommends it for
support."
R&D Cases
The report examines several research
and development contracts, cases where
the final results desired are the same for
the researcher and the military, and
cases where there are specific military
uses not considered by the researcher.
The report says, "There are no
apparent military applications for most
of the physics research being done with
the accelerator's electron beam."
However, a Navy official says, "These
projects are all relevant to Navy
missions and requirements ... They are
good examples of how scientific work
which sometimes doesn't have — for
everyone — an obvious connection to
military missions can frequently be
seen to have such a connection."
The report mentions that in Volume
I, descriptions of a contract of
Electrical Engineering Professor William
Spicer's were in conflict as to the
applications of the work. The Army
Research Office said that the contract
would provide useful information in
regard to nightviewing devices.
Professor Spicer denied at the time that
his work had any connection with night
viewing or any military applications.
Volume II states that Dr. Robert Mace,
Director of the Army Research and
Development Physics Division
"certified that... the Defense
Documentation Center (DDC)

statement accurately indicated the
relevance of Dr. Spicer's work to Army
requirements."
Connection
Another Army official said that
while he could see how Spicer did not
consider the statement to accurately
represent his conception of the
research, he was incorrect in saying that
there was no connection to be made.
The report says,"The Army
Research Office, at least, seems
confident that Dr. Spicer's research
helps meet technical objectives
generated by the Army's night vision
requirements."
In a Daily interview yesterday,

Spicer denied that his contract has any
applications for night viewing devices.
He added that the c< ntract was
completely originated at Stanford, and
that he felt that Dr. Mace had
"misjudged" his work when writing the
DDC statement.
The SWOPSI report also contains a
table which lists Army, Navy and Air
Force research objectives, and the
Stanford contracts applicable to each
area of interest. The unclassified
Research Objective Booklets, from
which the SWOPSI descriptions were
obtained, will be placed on reserve at
Meyer Library. Copies of the report are
available for $3 at the SWOPSI office.
