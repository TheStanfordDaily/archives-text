# New Procedures For Appeal
## 
### 
On November 3d, 19th,
Selective Service National
Headquartes announced a number
of new regulations. The law
requires that regulation changes
be published in the Federal
Register for 30 days before taking
effect; therefore, these changes
will become official policy on
December 3, 1971. The changes
which immediately affect most
men are those which implement
new procedures for appealing a
classification.
Beginning Dec. 3rd, a man will
have only 15 days from the date
stamped on his classification card
to request all the rights of
personal appearance and appeal
that he may wish to use in
appealing his new classification.
Thus, within 15 days from the
date of mailing of the new notice
of classification, a man must write
to his board and request a change
in classification.
In the same letter he should
request an appearance before
them and an appeal with an
appearance before the appeal
board if necessary. The timely
request of these appeal rights
protects a man from further
induction processing if the local
board will not grant the requested
classification.
A man need not appear before
either the local or appeal board to
reserve his rights of appeal, but he
must request an appeal before
both boards within the 15 days
following the mailing of his notice
of classification.
This need to request all appeal
rights in the beginning reflects a
significant change in selection
Service policy, in that the
regultions no longer define a
personal appearance as a
classification re-opening.
Consequently, if a man is denied
his requested classification at the

personal appearance, he receives
no new classification card, and
therefore, no new appeal period.
There are several other new
procedural changes attendant to a
new notice of classification. On a
CO or a hardship claim a man may
appear before his board either
before or after their ruling on his
claim (most men are likely to
make an appearance after an
adverse decision so as to confront

more squarely the reasons for
their denial).
The personal appearance
before the local board must be
scheduled for at least 15 minutes,
during which time a man may
present up to three witnesses. No
witnesses are allowed at the
appearance before the state appeal
board. The local and appeal
boards are requried to give at least
15 days notice of a scheduled
appearance before them.
If a man is unable to appear
before his local board as
scheduled, "for good cause he
establishes to the satisfaction of
the local board", he shall be given
another chance to appear before
them. He must submit in writing
his reasons for failing to appear
within 5 days after the missed
appearance or he will be deemed
to hve waived his right to a
subsequent appearance.
If the board refuses to reopen a
man's classification, that is, it
refuses to change his I-A (or 1-0 or

I-A-0) after his personal
appearance, it must record
the reasons for its refusal in a
man's file and notify him by letter
of its decision, giving him the
reasons for refusal.
If the state appeal board
decides adversely, it must also
record the reasons for its decision
in a man's file, but only upon the
registrant's written request to the
local board, must it furnish a brief

BMUFf

statement of those reasons.
Only men who have been
c'assified I-A, 1-0, or I-A-0 by
their local boards may appeal to
the state appeal board, although
because of the 15 day time limit
at the beginning of the
classification process, it is
important to request the right to
state appeal at that time.
Only those members of the
appeal board before whom he has
appeared may vote on a man's
classification. If the state board
decides a man's classification with
a split vote, he has a right to
appeal and appear before the
Presidential Appeal Board, again
with a 15 day notice of
appearance. He is advised of their
decision •by a new notice of
classification, and within 30 days
from its date of mailing he may
submit a written request to his
local board for a brief statement
of reasons for denial by the
Presidential Board.

personal appearance as a
classification re-opening.
Consequently, if a man is denied
his requested classification at the

personal appearance, he receives
no new classification card, and
therefore, no new appeal period.
There are several other new
procedural changes attendant to a
new notice of classification. On a
CO or a hardship claim a man may
appear before his board either
before or after their ruling on his
claim (most men are likely to
make an appearance after an
adverse decision so as to confront

more squarely the reasons for
their denial).
The personal appearance
before the local board must be
scheduled for at least 15 minutes,
during which time a man may
present up to three witnesses. No
witnesses are allowed at the
appearance before the state appeal
board. The local and appeal
boards are requried to give at least
15 days notice of a scheduled
appearance before them.
If a man is unable to appear
before his local board as
scheduled, "for good cause he
establishes to the satisfaction of
the local board", he shall be given
another chance to appear before
them. He must submit in writing
his reasons for failing to appear
within 5 days after the missed
appearance or he will be deemed
to hve waived his right to a
subsequent appearance.
If the board refuses to reopen a
man's classification, that is, it
refuses to change his I-A (or 1-0 or

I-A-0) after his personal
appearance, it must record
the reasons for its refusal in a
man's file and notify him by letter
of its decision, giving him the
reasons for refusal.
If the state appeal board
decides adversely, it must also
record the reasons for its decision
in a man's file, but only upon the
registrant's written request to the
local board, must it furnish a brief

BMUFf

statement of those reasons.
Only men who have been
c'assified I-A, 1-0, or I-A-0 by
their local boards may appeal to
the state appeal board, although
because of the 15 day time limit
at the beginning of the
classification process, it is
important to request the right to
state appeal at that time.
Only those members of the
appeal board before whom he has
appeared may vote on a man's
classification. If the state board
decides a man's classification with
a split vote, he has a right to
appeal and appear before the
Presidential Appeal Board, again
with a 15 day notice of
appearance. He is advised of their
decision •by a new notice of
classification, and within 30 days
from its date of mailing he may
submit a written request to his
local board for a brief statement
of reasons for denial by the
Presidential Board.

On November 3d, 19th,
Selective Service National
Headquartes announced a number
of new regulations. The law
requires that regulation changes
be published in the Federal
Register for 30 days before taking
effect; therefore, these changes
will become official policy on
December 3, 1971. The changes
which immediately affect most
men are those which implement
new procedures for appealing a
classification.
Beginning Dec. 3rd, a man will
have only 15 days from the date
stamped on his classification card
to request all the rights of
personal appearance and appeal
that he may wish to use in
appealing his new classification.
Thus, within 15 days from the
date of mailing of the new notice
of classification, a man must write
to his board and request a change
in classification.
In the same letter he should
request an appearance before
them and an appeal with an
appearance before the appeal
board if necessary. The timely
request of these appeal rights
protects a man from further
induction processing if the local
board will not grant the requested
classification.
A man need not appear before
either the local or appeal board to
reserve his rights of appeal, but he
must request an appeal before
both boards within the 15 days
following the mailing of his notice
of classification.
This need to request all appeal
rights in the beginning reflects a
significant change in selection
Service policy, in that the
