## On Angela Davis' Trial 
### 
Angela Davis has been in jail
now for over one year. She has
been convicted of absolutely
nothing. She has been denied bail
though there is nothing in
California law which prevents her
release on bail — unless, of course,
one is to presume her guilt prior
to trial.
Even the Chief Probation
Officer of the Marin County
Probation Department
recommended her release on bail
and informed the Court of his
conviction that Angela Davis
would not flee its jurisdiction.
The trial of Angela Davis is
imminent. The defense moved for
a change-of-venue to San
Francisco. This motion was
denied. Instead the trial has been
moved to Santa Clara County,
which, according to the defense's
survey of public opinion, rated
among the least responsive to a
positive view of the issues
involved in the Davis trial.
Further, less than 1.5% of the

County is Black, which virtually
guarantees an all-white jury.
Through the denial of bail, the
change of venue to Santa Clara
County, the general propaganda
by the higest instrumentalities of
government, the contours of the
prosecution's strategy for
conviction have come clearly into
focus to maintain a level of racist
hysteria, to sustain, by any means
necessary, a presumption of guilt,
in order that the trial proceed as a
mere formality to confirm a priori
culpability.
For if there is a real trial, if due
process is accorded Angela Davis,
if she were released on bail, if the
trial were held in San Francisco,
in short, if the presumption of
innocence were restored, the
clarity of her appeal and the truth
she would expose would make
conviction extremely difficult.
In spite of this Angela Davis
has continued to expose the plight
of all political prisoners through
her articles and appeals and
presentations in court as
co-counsel. It was precisely her
commitment to the Soledad
Brothers' defense and her
involvement in the movement
which was beginning to expose an
archaic, racist prison system that
specifically occasioned the
frame-up charges against her.
Angela Davis. Twenty-seven.
Black. Communist. Teacher.
Philosopher-activist. Political
Prisoner. She is the living
embodiment of Karl Marx's
fundamental thesis: "Philosophers
have only interpreted the world in
various ways; the point, however,
is to change it."
In such a way is her life bound
up with the lives of all oppressed
and exploited people. Of her trial
she writes: "I am charged with
three capital offenses — murder,
kidnapping and conspiracy. My
life is at stake in this case — not
simply the life of a lone
individual, but a life which
belongs to Black people who are
tired of poverty and racism and
the unjust imprisonment of tens
of thousands of our brothers and
sisters. It is this life organically
bound up with the lives of all the
millions who struggle for freedom
and justice . . . which stands to be
extinguished by the State of
California".
Only the most massive,
militant, uncompromising and
united movement embracing every
progressive political tendency, led
by the Black people in the first
place, can hope to win the
freedom of Angela Davis.
There will be an informational
and organizational meeting on
Angela Davis" defense Monday, in
the Women's clubhouse at 11 a.m.
