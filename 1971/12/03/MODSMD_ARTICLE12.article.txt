# for fair hearings
## Staff Participation Necessary 
### 
Workers find themselves in a
strange and surprising spot. The
Administration has replied,
half-hearted as it is, to growing
Worker indignation at the
arbitrary Grievance Procedure
instituted by the administration
over protests of various segments
of the worker community.
The reply came by way of
Douglas H. Barton who replaced
Robert Nelson as Staff Counsel.
This is not Mr. Barton's first
contact with Stanford. Not only
did he attend Stanford Law
School, but most interestingly,
presided over the last half of the
Stanford N.L.R.B. hearings in San
Francisco.
One of the more notable
examples of the way Mr. Barton
handled the hearings came when
the CSEA-proposed bargaining
unit came under fire for excluding
most women and third world
workers on the basis of job
classification. After a bit of
hedging, Mr. Barton said the issues
of race and sex were "irrelevant"
to the proceedings. He gave no
explanation.
As if by magic, we now find
Mr. Barton employed at Stanford,
where he continues to say
"irrelevant" to workers. He has
already quashed the Grievance
request (remember, no grievance
without administration consent),
of 3 women, one black, in the Bio
Physics Dept. of the Med School.
All these women were passed over
for promotion in favor of a white
male from outside the University.
It is interesting to note that the
new Grievance Procedure is not
new in the sense that Mr. Barton
and men like him retain the right
to ignore grievances altogether.
According to Mr. Barton, the
merits of the new procedure
should be judged on the actual
record in practice and not on the
assumptions of some employees.
Since its inauguration, at least
two people have filed a total of
three grievances with the office of

Personnel and Employee relations.
Not one of those Grievances ever
was reviewed by Personnel, not to
mention received by Lyman's
Blue Ribbon Panel.
The Personnel Office ignored
the explicit terms of the
Grievance Procedure in each case
and refused to process written
Grievances that scrupulously
adhered to every requirement of
the new Procedure. Clearly the
new Procedure has been designed
as window dressing with the
purpose of hiding the
administration's real attitude
toward workers behind a facade
of seemingly enlightened
munificence.
Mr. Barton tried, rather
ineptly, to make the qualifications
of the arbitors an issue, when the
real issue is that arbitor
qualifications not withstanding,
the total lack of worker
participation and control rules out
the possibility of a just hearing.
Of course, hearings will only
occur where and when the
administration agrees there has
been a legitimate Grievance. These
"game plans" are popular among
administrations in general, but
this one is completely transparent.
They have given workers a bright
new deck called arbitors and new
rules called Grievance Procedure.
But the administration wrote
the rules all alone and they can
still change or ignore the rules
when it suits them. So perhaps
Mr. Barton is correct that the
metaphor of a stacked-deck is
incorrect.
Mr. Barton says "if this be
"high-handed and arbitrary"
administrative action, make the
most of it". This has the ring of
"Let them eat Cake," but not the
conviction. Like a strict parent he
says the administration didn't
have to give workers a Grievance
Procedure if it didn't want to.

didn't pay any.
Perhaps they have
usual-justification for seeking
delays in the law that requires
them to do so.

Procedure free of administration
control. .
Workers do
not wish the administration to
have final say on whether a
grievance even exists.
Workers want to know what
the N.L.R.B. is planning to hand
down a verdict, and whether Mr.
Barton was or is in the position to
affect or know the reason behind
the N.L.R.B's constant delay.

the new Procedure. Clearly the
new Procedure has been designed
as window dressing with the
purpose of hiding the
administration's real attitude
toward workers behind a facade
of seemingly enlightened
munificence.
Mr. Barton tried, rather
ineptly, to make the qualifications
of the arbitors an issue, when the
real issue is that arbitor
qualifications not withstanding,
the total lack of worker
participation and control rules out
the possibility of a just hearing.
Of course, hearings will only
occur where and when the
administration agrees there has
been a legitimate Grievance. These
"game plans" are popular among
administrations in general, but
this one is completely transparent.
They have given workers a bright
new deck called arbitors and new
rules called Grievance Procedure.
But the administration wrote
the rules all alone and they can
still change or ignore the rules
when it suits them. So perhaps
Mr. Barton is correct that the
metaphor of a stacked-deck is
incorrect.
Mr. Barton says "if this be
"high-handed and arbitrary"
administrative action, make the
most of it". This has the ring of
"Let them eat Cake," but not the
conviction. Like a strict parent he
says the administration didn't
have to give workers a Grievance
Procedure if it didn't want to.

Perhaps they have
usual-justification for seeking

them to do so.

Workers do

the N.L.R.B. is planning to hand

affect or know the reason behind
the N.L.R.B's constant delay.

Workers find themselves in a
strange and surprising spot. The
Administration has replied,
half-hearted as it is, to growing
Worker indignation at the
arbitrary Grievance Procedure
instituted by the administration
over protests of various segments
of the worker community.
The reply came by way of
Douglas H. Barton who replaced
Robert Nelson as Staff Counsel.
This is not Mr. Barton's first
contact with Stanford. Not only
did he attend Stanford Law
School, but most interestingly,
presided over the last half of the
Stanford N.L.R.B. hearings in San
Francisco.
One of the more notable
examples of the way Mr. Barton
handled the hearings came when
the CSEA-proposed bargaining
unit came under fire for excluding
most women and third world
workers on the basis of job
classification. After a bit of
hedging, Mr. Barton said the issues
of race and sex were "irrelevant"
to the proceedings. He gave no
explanation.
As if by magic, we now find
Mr. Barton employed at Stanford,
where he continues to say
"irrelevant" to workers. He has
already quashed the Grievance
request (remember, no grievance
without administration consent),
of 3 women, one black, in the Bio
Physics Dept. of the Med School.
All these women were passed over
for promotion in favor of a white
male from outside the University.
It is interesting to note that the
new Grievance Procedure is not
new in the sense that Mr. Barton
and men like him retain the right
to ignore grievances altogether.
According to Mr. Barton, the
merits of the new procedure
should be judged on the actual
record in practice and not on the
assumptions of some employees.
Since its inauguration, at least
two people have filed a total of
three grievances with the office of

Personnel and Employee relations.
Not one of those Grievances ever
was reviewed by Personnel, not to
mention received by Lyman's
Blue Ribbon Panel.
The Personnel Office ignored
the explicit terms of the
Grievance Procedure in each case
and refused to process written
Grievances that scrupulously
adhered to every requirement of
the new Procedure. Clearly the
new Procedure has been designed
as window dressing with the
purpose of hiding the
administration's real attitude
toward workers behind a facade
of seemingly enlightened
munificence.
