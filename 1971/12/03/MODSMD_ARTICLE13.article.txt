## From 'Lin Piao: A Chinese Puzzle' 
### 
The Chinese puzzle with which we are now
faced is of labyrinthine proportions. The
question, put simply, is whether or not the
political drive against "ultra-Leftists" in the
Chinese leadership, waged throughout this
year, has reached its climax with an attack
upon Lin Piao, Mao Tse-tung's chosen
successor and "close comrade-in-arms."
Let us start with the evidence against such a
conclusion. First, the inspired story from
official sources in Washington, to the effect
that the Chinese people are now being told of
a plot by Lin Piao to assassinate the chairman,
followed by Lin's flight and death, has
uncertain antecedents.
The story originally appeared a fortnight
ago in the reputable Hongkong "Far Eastern
Economic Review," where it was perhaps more
accurately described as one of the more
"colourful tales" of gossip with which visitors
to China are being regaled. Gossip of this kind
is not unknown in China, though it is rare for
the foreign visitor to learn of it. At all events,

the source of the story hardly seems to be
authoritative.
Secondly, in human terms the idea that the
frail, tubercular, but loyal Lin would plot
Mao's assassination is unbelievable. In political
terms, it is completely foreign to the general
"style" of Chinese politics since 1949.
Yet, the counter-arguments can no longer be
dismissed out of hand. First, there is no reason
to suppose that Lin Piao himself should be
immune to criticism, or not held accountable
for errors committed during the Cultural
Revolution. It should also be borne in mind
that the Army was the only institution in
China which was not "purified" by the process
of Cultural Revolution, remaining largely
exempt while it held the ring between rival
factions.
Second, the absence from sight of the Army
Chief-of-Staff and other senior officers is
accompanied by what amounts to a new "line"
stressing the need for the People's Liberation

Army in particular to subordinate itself to
party control.
â€¢ Third, in the last few days, the Chinese press
and radio have begun to talk of the existence
of a "conspiracy" among those in a position of
authority.
The balance of argument may still be tipped
strongly against what might "be called the
"warlord" view from Washington of Chinese
politics. Perhaps the "China watcher" should
become an "America watcher" as well, and
inquire what sort of purpose these official but
unattribu table briefings may serve. Even
monitored radio broadcasts have been known
to emanate from "black propaganda" sources.
Yet this kind of mystification is itself only
made possible by the much greater mystery
surrounding Lin Piao, which the Chinese have
done nothing to dispel.
