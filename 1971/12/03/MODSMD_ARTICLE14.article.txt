# 'look beyond specific actions'
## Letter To Advisory Board Condemns Franklin 
### 
Dr. Donald Kennedy,
Chairman, Advisory Board
We understand that the Advisory Board
has received many letters from groups and
individuals arguing for the acquittal of
Professor Franklin, but very few on the
other side. Despite reluctance to burden
you with still more reading, we would like
to help balance the ledger by putting our
opinions on record.
First, let it be said strongly and
explicitly that we are not arguing against
freedom of speech or freedom of political
opinion. We think that neither freedom to
speak nor freedom to hold deviant political
views is involved in the case, and that
emphasis on either serves only to obfuscate
the important issues.
Professor Franklin should have
complete liberty to think as he wishes and
to express his views forcefully, no matter
how abhorrent the views may be to the
majority of the Stanford community. To
grant him less freedom than this would
infringe on the freedom of all of us. However
much his behavior and his ideas may
offend alumni and the general public, the
university must be strong enough to resist
criticism on these grounds.
The important issues, in our opinion,
are whether or not Professor Franklin by
his actions has curtailed the freedom of
other members of the community and
whether or not he has done actual harm to
the university. We feel that he is guilty on

both counts.
By disrupting the Lodge lecture and
other gatherings, by encouraging the
occupation of the computer center and
other buildings, by terrorizing the campus
so that faculty and students were obliged
to mount guard over buildings for weeks at
a time, Professor Franklin and his followers
have seriously interfered with the freedom
of many people to inform themselves and
to carry on their work.
There is little point in quibbling over
precisely what Professor Franklin did or
did not do on a specific occasion; surely he
has made it abundantly clear in the past
few weeks that he does, in fact, advocate
coercive acts that violate the freedoms of
those with whom he disagrees. Those of
us who have lived thru the past three years
known all too well that he has been present
at almost every disturbance, that he has
many times subtly incited crowds to
violence, and that he has carefully coached
groups of high school students and street
people from surrounding communities in
techniques of wanton destruction.
In a hearing held when the campus is
quiet, when his sycophants testify in
regimented sequence how innocent his
specific words and actions have been, it all
seems pretty trivial. But most of us have
seen him in action, most of us remember
vividly the occupations of buildings and
the nights of terrorism, most of us still
bitterly resent the time wasted and the

freedoms restricted by the actions of
Professor Franklin and his cohorts.
Damage to the university is not alone
the physical damage to windows and
building interiors, but much more
importantly the damage to human relations
within and outside the university. Stanford
in the past has enjoyed an admirable
community of spirit, a sense of tolerance
and loyalty and fairness, coupled with
great diversity of ideas and life styles, that
made it a pleasant and stimulating place
All this is gone, replaced by an
increasing polarity of mutual hate. Instead
of a healthy interplay of conflicting ideas,
we now have humorless and bitter
confrontations of entrenched positions.
These changes have many causes, but in
our opinion they stem in large part from
Professor Franklin's systematic efforts to
embarrass a vulnerable institution by his
irresponsible actions. Surely it is no accident
that most universities in this country have
begun to recover, last year and this year,
from the confrontation madness of a few
years ago, and that Stanford alone
continues to have serious trouble.
Because we feel that Professor Franklin
has been instrumental in curtailing the
freedom of large sections of the Stanford
community and because his actions have
resulted in major physical and
psychological harm to the university, we
hope that the Advisory Board will look
beyond the details of specific actions and

We close by expressing our sense of
indebtedness to the Advisory Board for
representing all of us in this most difficult
case. Whatever the final verdict may be, we
are most grateful for your willingness to
spend on our behalf prodigious lengths of
time and enormous amounts of spiritiual
energy in an effort to reach a just solution.
