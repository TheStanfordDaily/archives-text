# Handbook Coming
## 
### 
The Student Services Task
Force (SSTF), an informal
alliance of students and staff
members in the Dean of Students'
Office plans to release a consumer
handbook for students early in
Winter Quarter.
The book will contain general
legal advice on a number of topics
including contracts, warranties,
and auto purchase and
maintenance. According to law
student Marshall Tanick, author
of the work, the handbook is
intended to be a reference guide
for students and not a
how-to-do-it book.
Tanick added that the
handbook will "evoke an
awareness of problems that may
arise" and will attack those
problems from two angles by
offering legal viewpoint as well as
giving "bits of wisdom".
The consumer booklet should
be ready for distribution by
Winter Quarter. It will probably
be distributed to RA's and places
where there are concentrations of
students.
The consumer handbook may
be the beginning of a consumer
program to be based in the Dean
of Students' Office, according to
SSTF member Dolores Enriquez,
an assistant to the dean. Enriquez
would eventually like to see a
full-fledged consumer information
office functioning on campus.
According to assistant to the
dean, John Grube, also a SSTF
staffer, the ultimate goal is "to set
up a place with a central location

where students, faculty and staff
can go to get information" about
consumer problems.
Both Enriquez and Grube
stress that student participation in
this project is essential; so far, all
SSTF projects have been
understaffed.
The task force is also working
on a public opinion poll. It is now
setting up the machinery to poll
students on whether the
University should provide free
legal advice.
The poll will concern issues in
which student opinions can
provide a direct impact on the
decision-making process.
The SSTF, since its inception
last year, has sponsored a number
of programs which have already
moved past the planning stage.
Perhaps the most prominent of
these is the Stanford Quarterly
Review, which is devoted to
publishing "outstanding
undergraduate research papers."
Last year's projects included a
faculty meal associate program
"whereby faculty members were
invited to dinner in University
residences to promote
student-faculty contact" and a
police relations program which
brought Santa Clara County
sheriff's deputies on campus to
dine with students.
Both Enriquez and Grube
stress that students must initiate
their own projects, keeping in
mind that they should "try to
steer away from really long-term
things."

dean, John Grube, also a SSTF
staffer, the ultimate goal is "to set
up a place with a central location

where students, faculty and staff
can go to get information" about
consumer problems.
Both Enriquez and Grube
stress that student participation in
this project is essential; so far, all
SSTF projects have been
understaffed.
The task force is also working
on a public opinion poll. It is now
setting up the machinery to poll
students on whether the
University should provide free
legal advice.
The poll will concern issues in
which student opinions can
provide a direct impact on the
decision-making process.
The SSTF, since its inception
last year, has sponsored a number
of programs which have already
moved past the planning stage.
Perhaps the most prominent of
these is the Stanford Quarterly
Review, which is devoted to
publishing "outstanding
undergraduate research papers."
Last year's projects included a
faculty meal associate program
"whereby faculty members were
invited to dinner in University
residences to promote
student-faculty contact" and a
police relations program which
brought Santa Clara County
sheriff's deputies on campus to
dine with students.
Both Enriquez and Grube
stress that students must initiate
their own projects, keeping in
mind that they should "try to
steer away from really long-term
things."
The Student Services Task
Force (SSTF), an informal
alliance of students and staff
members in the Dean of Students'
Office plans to release a consumer
handbook for students early in
Winter Quarter.
The book will contain general
legal advice on a number of topics
including contracts, warranties,
and auto purchase and
maintenance. According to law
student Marshall Tanick, author
of the work, the handbook is
intended to be a reference guide
for students and not a
how-to-do-it book.
Tanick added that the
handbook will "evoke an
awareness of problems that may
arise" and will attack those
problems from two angles by
offering legal viewpoint as well as
giving "bits of wisdom".
The consumer booklet should
be ready for distribution by
Winter Quarter. It will probably
be distributed to RA's and places
where there are concentrations of
students.
The consumer handbook may
be the beginning of a consumer
program to be based in the Dean
of Students' Office, according to
SSTF member Dolores Enriquez,
an assistant to the dean. Enriquez
would eventually like to see a
full-fledged consumer information
office functioning on campus.
According to assistant to the
dean, John Grube, also a SSTF
staffer, the ultimate goal is "to set
up a place with a central location

can go to get information" about
