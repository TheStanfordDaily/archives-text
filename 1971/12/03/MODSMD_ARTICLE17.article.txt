# Med Volunteers Assist In Clinic
## 
### 
The Gardner Family Health
Center, established last summer
when volunteers from the
Stanford Medical School and the
San Jose community combined
efforts, is displaying the success of
neighborhood-oriented health
clinics.
Stanford has played a
substantial role in the success of
the GFHC, of the five model cities
neighborhoods in San Jose located

in a predominantly Chicano area.
Chris Murias, second-year
Stanford medical student, heads a
group of Stanford volunteers who
assisted the community in
transforming the Sacred Heart
Elementary School into
examining rooms, offices and
laboratories.
All volunteers perform vital
services for the health center.
Working in conjunction with the

15 volunteer doctors, Stanford
medical students make a
preliminary diagnosis, Stanford
pre-meds assist as lab technicians,
and community volunteers work
as medical receptionists, and
translators along with staffing a
child-care center.
The main thrust of the GFHC
fund-raising is a dinner-dance
being held this Friday in
Hardemann Hall (located at
Willow and Locust) in San Jose at
7 p.m. State Senators George
Moscone and Alfred Alquist, State
Assemblyman John Vasconcelos,
Congressman Donald Edwards and
San Jose Mayor Norman Mineta
will be attending.
