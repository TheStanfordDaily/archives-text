# Spending Formula To Be Set
## Institutional Aid Program Passed 
### BOB MICHELET News Analysis 
The U.S. House and Senate recently passed
legislation for aid to higher education that
included a provision colleges have long wanted,
but the two bills are so different that they
have provoked a new round of discussion.
The provision is one for "institutional aid"
— money given to colleges in lump sums, to be
spent at their discretion.
The difference between the House and
Senate bills is not whether institutional aid
should be given, but rather what formula
should be used to determine the amount each
school gets.
The Senate bill sets up a formula based on
the number of students receiving Federal
financial aid. Under the plan, needy students
would be given "basic educational opportunity
grants" of $1,400 a year, minus family
contribution. The university would receive aid
through "cost-of-education allowances," based
on the number of enrolled students who
receive basic opportunity grants.
The grant is a new idea in federal funding,
since it is a guarantee of financial assistance for
poor students accepted to colleges.
When the House passed its bill last month,
it provided for institutional aid according to
the following formula: 2/3 on the basis of
total enrollment, and 1/3 on the basis of
federal aid paid to students attending the
school.
Proponents of the Senate plan argue it
would give more aid to low-income students
and encourage colleges to enroll more of them.
At first, most large schools favored the
House plan, since more money would come
from a formula based mainly on enrollment.
But many — Stanford among them — have
lately supported the Senate plan.
Stanford, however, was an early supporter
of a plan in which the aid is carried by the
student, and this is what the Senate formula
does.
President Richard Lyman in a recent San
Francisco speech, outlined the University's

believe that any program of federal aid should
encourage a diversity of students and an
equality of educational opportunity.
"If we decide," Lyman said, "that 'higher
education' shall no longer be a house of many
mansions, but a single, moderate-income
dwelling of homogeneous design nationwide,
we shall find ourselves becoming a nation no
more equal than before. . . ."
Awarding institutional aid on the bais of
enrollment, he said, "would provide no
incentive except to enroll as many students for
as long as possible."
It is impossible now to even estimate how
much Stanford might receive under either
plan, because funding always depends on how
much is finally appropriated — and that comes
much later through a separate bill.
Both bills provide for extensions of most
existing aid programs to higher education.
These include grants and loans for
construction, graduate study, community
colleges, vocational training, community
service, and other programs.
A final compromise bill must be worked
out in a joint House-Senate subcommittee, but
it appears the Senate will delay appointment
of its conference until January.
There are several differences between the
two measures — including House provisions
against busing school children — but the main
stumbling block in the committee will
probably be the wide difference in the
institutional aid formulas.
And the discussion over the two plans
inevitably raises larger questions about the
purposes and pitfalls of government funding.
For several years, colleges have been facing
a bleak financial picture. Rising costs and
declining outside help have put the squeeze on
university budgets.
Tuition has skyrocketed in recent years, but
it is only a small portion of a university's
income. The federal government poured $57
million into Stanford in 1970-71, but most of
this was for research support and graduate
study.

What the university needs most is money
that is not earmarked for a specific project or
department — money that can be put into the
general fund and spent where required most.
This is the need institutional aid would fill, if
only partially.
The federal government bears only a
quarter of the cost of financial aid to
undergraduate minority students, while the
university pays the rest.
Many, however, see dangers in this type of
carte blanche funding. It is argued that such a
policy might open the door to further
government interference in university affairs;
or that, wihtout a specific goal, federal money
might be spent on undeserving programs.
But the overwhelming votes for the plan in
the Senate and House (51-0 and 322-38,
respectively) demonstrate the general
acceptance of some type of accross-the-board
funding of financially-pinched colleges.
Rep. James Schener (D—N.Y.) argued that
institutional aid is needed so colleges "can
survive to the day we can help them more
adequately."
Yet within the recognition of a need for
immediate action, there must be consideration
of how federal money, even in the form of
institutional aid, is best distributed.
It is argued that the Senate plan, by making
guarantees of aid to needy students, would
make higher education available to a wider
range of people.
Federal aid, Lyman says, "should maximize
the chances of a genuine
pluralism . . . diversity in the world of higher
education should be recognized, cherished and
encouraged. . .
This means federal funds should encourage
new, innovative programs rather than a
sheltered status quo.
A program basing institutional aid on the
number of students receiving financial help
would probably be a step in this direction, and
could lead to programs in other areas to help
make higher education possible for more
people.
