# COSS Plans Open Hearings
## 
### 
The Committee on Student
Services (COSS) plans to hold
open hearings on the issues of
how the Placement Center should
be controlled and used, beginning
the first week of Winter Quarter.
Whether the facilities of the
Placement Center should be open
or closed to certain recruiters is
the first question COSS will
consider during the hearings,
according to its student chairman,
Tim Clark.
COSS will also study the
make-up and powers of a possible
policy review committee. In
addition, they will consider what
groups besides the recruiting

companies themselves should be
allowed to distribute information
through the center.
President Lyman has also
charged COSS to advise him on
three similar questions relating to
the issues of the referenda passed
on the Placement Center last
spring.
The hearings will be held
Tuesday, Wednesday, and
Thursday, January 4, 5, and 6,
and each week following as long
as the outside testimony
continues.
COSS asks for, but does not
require, a one page written
summary of remarks for all those
wishing to testify.
