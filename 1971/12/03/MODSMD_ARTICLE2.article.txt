# Angela Davis Brought To Palo Alto
## 
### LANG ATWOOD 
Attorneys for black revolutionary
Angela Davis filed an appeal yesterday
to move her trial from Santa Clara
County to San Francisco County,
following her transfer from the Marin
County Jail to the North County jail in
Palo Alto.
The appeal said a defense survey
found that prejudice against Davis "is
just as widespread in Santa Clara as it
was in Marin." It said San Francisco
had less prejudice against her than any
of the six Bay Area counties included
in the survey.
Davis, wearing handcuffs, was taken
from the Marin County Jail in San
Rafael at 5:30 a.m. yesterd?v and
driven in an unmarked car to Santa
Clara's North County courthouse-jail
facility on Grant Avenue in Palo Alto,
one-half mile south of the campus.
According to Santa Clara County
Sheriff James Geary, Davis is being held
in a six by eight foot cell and has an
adjoining cell of the same size for a
workroom. The workroom will house
her books, legal papers, an electric
typewriter and a radio.
In Marin she had a seven by seven
foot cell and had a ten by ten foot
workroom nearby.
Geary stated that the North county
jail was selected because its size, the
ability to control security and the
necessity for only minor modifications
to meet detention needs made it the
most suitable.
Holding Facility
He said the jail is a holding facility
for unsentenced prisoners and has a
capacity of 20 men and 13 women.

Davis will be allowed to mix with other
women prisoners if she wishes, subject
to normal jail and penal code
procedures.
A quickly organized demonstration
began in front of the North County
facility at noon yesterday. About 75
persons, some carrying signs with
pictures of Davis, demanded that she be
freed.
Some members of the crowd wore
Venceremos buttons, while others had
buttons which said "Free Angela." H.
Bruce Franklin, suspended English
professor, and Aaron Manganiello,
chairman of the Central Committee of
Venceremos, were among the
demonstrators. Other members of the
crowd reportedly included Davis
supporters who had come down from
Marin County.
There were no incidents during the
one-and-a-half-hour contest.
No Judge Assigned
Although most observers now
expect that the Davis trial will be held
in Palo Alto, Judge John T. Racanelli,
the county's presiding Superior Court
judge, said decisions on a trial site and a
trial judge would be made "within the
next few days," indicating that the trial
could still be held in San Jose.
Dr. Tolbert Small, Davis' doctor,
said yesterday that she is healthy
enough to stand trial, but that she has
influenza, menstrual problems, a sty
over her left eye and dental problems.
He hopes that her transfer from San
Rafael to Palo Alto will allow her to
obtain better medical care. He
reportedly has been dissatisfied with
the cooperation of the Marin County

authorities.
Geary said yesterday that a fresh-air
exercise area will be provided in
accordance with court orders.
Bomb Threat
Five buildings housing courts
throughout Santa Clara County were
evacuated about 1:30 p.m. yesterday
when an anonymous telephone caller
told the sheriff's office in San Jose that
a bomb would explode in a Municipal
Court.
However, no bomb was found, and
Davis and other prisoners in the
sub-ground jail were not moved.
Security measures inside and outside

the jail were tight yesterday after Davis'
arrival. Sheriff's deputies patrolled on
foot outside the building and two
unmarked sheriff's cars cruised the area
around the courthouse.
Palo Alto police, who are
responsible for security in the area
surrounding the courthouse block, said
yesterday they have plans drawn up to
handle any large demonstrations or
disturbances.
Davis, a former UCLA instructor, is
charged with murder, kidnap and
conspiracy in the August 7, 1970,
shootout at the Marin Civic Center in
which a judge and three others were
killed.

found that prejudice against Davis "is
just as widespread in Santa Clara as it
was in Marin." It said San Francisco
had less prejudice against her than any
of the six Bay Area counties included
in the survey.
Davis, wearing handcuffs, was taken
from the Marin County Jail in San
Rafael at 5:30 a.m. yesterd?v and
driven in an unmarked car to Santa
Clara's North County courthouse-jail
facility on Grant Avenue in Palo Alto,
one-half mile south of the campus.
According to Santa Clara County
Sheriff James Geary, Davis is being held
in a six by eight foot cell and has an
adjoining cell of the same size for a
workroom. The workroom will house
her books, legal papers, an electric
typewriter and a radio.
In Marin she had a seven by seven
foot cell and had a ten by ten foot
workroom nearby.
Geary stated that the North county
jail was selected because its size, the
ability to control security and the
necessity for only minor modifications
to meet detention needs made it the
most suitable.
Holding Facility
He said the jail is a holding facility
for unsentenced prisoners and has a
capacity of 20 men and 13 women.

Davis will be allowed to mix with other
women prisoners if she wishes, subject
to normal jail and penal code
procedures.
A quickly organized demonstration
began in front of the North County
facility at noon yesterday. About 75
persons, some carrying signs with
pictures of Davis, demanded that she be
freed.
Some members of the crowd wore
Venceremos buttons, while others had
buttons which said "Free Angela." H.
Bruce Franklin, suspended English
professor, and Aaron Manganiello,
chairman of the Central Committee of
Venceremos, were among the
demonstrators. Other members of the
crowd reportedly included Davis
supporters who had come down from
Marin County.
There were no incidents during the
one-and-a-half-hour contest.
No Judge Assigned
Although most observers now
expect that the Davis trial will be held
in Palo Alto, Judge John T. Racanelli,
the county's presiding Superior Court
judge, said decisions on a trial site and a
trial judge would be made "within the
next few days," indicating that the trial
could still be held in San Jose.
Dr. Tolbert Small, Davis' doctor,
said yesterday that she is healthy
enough to stand trial, but that she has
influenza, menstrual problems, a sty
over her left eye and dental problems.
He hopes that her transfer from San
Rafael to Palo Alto will allow her to
obtain better medical care. He
reportedly has been dissatisfied with
the cooperation of the Marin County

authorities.
Geary said yesterday that a fresh-air
exercise area will be provided in
accordance with court orders.
Bomb Threat
Five buildings housing courts
throughout Santa Clara County were
evacuated about 1:30 p.m. yesterday
when an anonymous telephone caller
told the sheriff's office in San Jose that
a bomb would explode in a Municipal
Court.
However, no bomb was found, and
Davis and other prisoners in the
sub-ground jail were not moved.
Security measures inside and outside

the jail were tight yesterday after Davis'
arrival. Sheriff's deputies patrolled on
foot outside the building and two
unmarked sheriff's cars cruised the area
around the courthouse.
Palo Alto police, who are
responsible for security in the area
surrounding the courthouse block, said
yesterday they have plans drawn up to
handle any large demonstrations or
disturbances.
Davis, a former UCLA instructor, is
charged with murder, kidnap and
conspiracy in the August 7, 1970,
shootout at the Marin Civic Center in
which a judge and three others were
killed.
