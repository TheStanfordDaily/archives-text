The man reads aloud very well. Standing before 225
students in his Modern American Literature class, he reads
the words John Dos Passos first fashioned to evoke the
mood of that evening decades ago when Sacco and Vanzetti
were put to death.

friends tonight
It is hardly a literary tirade. The passage, occuringmore
than thirteen hundred pages deep into the steel-hard USA
trilogy, is charged with a smoldering bitterness. His voice
building, building, building to a suppressed climax, 33
year-old assistant English professor Bill Chace brings it off
well. Not loudly but convincingly. You might think there
was even some steel in him.
there is nothing left to do we are beaten we the beaten
crowd together in these old dingy schoolrooms on Salen
Street shuffle up and down the gritty creaking stairs sit
hunched with bowed heads on benches and hear the old
words of the haters of oppression made new in sweat and
agony tonight. . .
Seven years ago Chace really was clubbed off the streets.
The streets of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, to be exact. It was
during the 1963-64 school year, when Chace had taken
advantage of a Woodrow Wilson program that sent grad
students to teach at Deep South schools. Chace was at
Stillman College, which had an entirely black enrollment
then.
There was a march to protest the county courthouse's
segregated washrooms. And the darndest thing happened:
when it came time to start marching, every one of Chace's
white colleagues on the faculty had a previous engagement
which simply could not be broken.
Seven hundred and fifty blacks plus one white cat on
loan from Berkeley. Rather an easy target? Bet yo' ass!
After he spent a day and night in jail the friendly folks
from Woodrow Wilson posted bail. "They thought it was
cool," Chace recalls.
The Woodrow Wilson people were, you understand,
good liberals.
our work is over the scribbled phrases the nights typing
releases the smell of the printshop the sharp reek of
newprinted leaflets the rush for Western Union stringing
words into wires the search for stinging words to make you
feel who are your oppressors America . . J
In his three years at Stanford, William M. Chace, himself
some variety of good liberal, has taught Relevant Courses.
Each spring he teaches "American Literature,
1917-Present." Filled with misgivings (after all, one of his
paternal ancestors named Emerson once had title to a piece
of property named Dred Scott), he taught Black Literature
until a black teacher could be procured for such a course.
This quarter, though he has been appointed a University
Fellow and is not obligated to teach, he co-teaches what

has been entitled The Minority Voice in Contemporary
Literature. The minorities include not just blacks and
Chicanos, but also women (a symbolic minority) and
homosexuals.
At first Chace was concerned that the course might be a
mick, but his faculty partner for the course, Larry
Friedlander, had no worries of that sort. Friedlander's
classroom attire is usually a mite funkier than Chace's.
Taller and thin and a year older than Chace, Larry sports
leather vests and your standard Navy bells graced with a
sash or sometimes red suspenders, and occasionally dons a
wide-brimmed tan hat. Chace will wear a sportcoat as often
as not.
Each is careful to allow the other one speaking time.
Chace casts his remarks in tight, disciplined, lucid phrases
that might look like something from an essay if transcribed.
Friendlander tends toward rambling, untidy,
conversational, unrhetorical rhetoric. Friendlander will tell
you Chace is really "very whimsical and light about a lot of
things" yet saddled with "a very sober demeanor."
That demeanor can heighten the effectiveness of the
numerous oral readings Chace delivers in all his classes.
Reading aloud, without histrionics, from William Faulkner
or Dos Passos or blues guitarist Sam "Lightning" Hopkins
or Allen Ginsberg or Lenny Bruce or Albert Goldman on
Lenny Bruce, Chace the teacher is Chace the actor who is
Chace the teacher. "Every teacher, it seems to me, is
basically something of a narcissist," observes Ramparts
editor Peter Collier, who studied English with his friend
Chace at Berkeley. "The good ones I've known were able to
dramatize themselves," he says.

"My original and my deepest
love was for books. . ."

Chace's soberest mood seems his most intense one. His
strongest emotion is conveyed in a plain-faced hardness,
like the mo rally-outraged government prosecutors we see
taking on the racketeers in movies made before working for
the government became disreputable. Sometimes in class he
reads a passage that has exactly that same hardness that he
shows. It is then he is at the peak of his form.
America our nation has been beaten by strangers who
have turned our language inside out who have taken the
clean words our fathers spoke and made them slimy and
foul
their hired men sit on the judge's bench they sit back
with their feet on the tables under the dome of the State
House they are ignorant of our beliefs they have the dollars
the guns the armed forces the powerplants
they have built the electricchair and hired the
executioner to throw the switch
all right we are two nations. ..
At these times it is possible to imagine Chace, who
seems so genuinely tough, doing many ir

radical political movements, yes, surely getting whupped up
on in Alabama, or perhaps even writing solid fiction of his
own. Then why is he, of all things, an English professor?
You know. Virgil, Dryden, Gay, and Matters Trivial;
Henry Reynolds Mythomystes and the Continuity of
Ancient Modes of Allegoresis in Seventeenth-Century
England; PMJLAendeavorstorepresentthemostdistinguished -

and all that.
Ask Chace why he is doing what he is doing and he
answers without hesitating, "My original and my deepest
love was for books." As Friedlander puts it, "in a rather
old-fashioned way, he cares about thinking and ideas, and
doing them well."
Chace's father was also a professor, at Virginia's black
Hampton Institute. In his undergraduate days at Haverford
College, Chace thought he would be a great poet or
novelist, but he will not admit any "sense of frustration"
that it never happened. Whatever else he docs, then,
whatever else he believes, however else he seems, this
central fact remains: he may not belong to the Modern
Language Association (neither does Friedlander), but Chace
is an English professor because he wants to be one. Beyond
all else, he loves boogin' those tomes.
And yet he has gotten himself so heavily involved in the
faculty's Academic Senate that he has been hard-pressed to
find enough time for his books. Elected to the Senate in
autumn of 1970, he was appointed to the Committee on
Committees. He won several special assignments, including
chairmanship of a task force on "the professoriate" —
matters of faculty appointment, tenure, retirement, and the
like. Changes in the professoriate are of great concern to
the junior, untenured faculty. This year, Chace was elected
to the influential Steering Committee, which sets the
Senate agenda.
His task force urged creation of a standing committee to
direct reform of the professoriate. The recommendation
came to a vote at the November 11th Senate meeting.
Chace wore a serious expression and seemed extremely
intent for most of the session. He said nothing until the
regularly scheduled President's report, as if saving and
preserving his influence for use at the wisest times.

In his undergraduate
days ... Chace thought he
would be a great poet or
novelist...

President Lyman discussed the picketing of the
Placement Center, where companies heavily involved in the
War effort were recruiting. The University, Lyman argued,
must beware of forcing individuals to submit to its moral
policing. Then in a quiet, careful voice Chace admitted he
largely agreed, but you know the University does bar
racially discriminatory companies from the Placement
Center so mightn't we work something out here? Lyman
answered that there are federal civil rights laws guiding us
there, but no comparable laws — no, not even the
Nuremberg laws can be invoked — for the case at hand.
Chace nodded.
At last, the vote on the task force's recommendation.
An ad hoc committee was substituted for the proposed
standing one, but the substance of the recommendation
passed unanimously.
Whereupon Chace stretched back in his swivel chair,
wheeled around to Associate Prof, of Psychiatry He rant
Katchadourian, grinned and said, "The good guys always
win," and stoked up a victory stogie. It was oddly
reminiscent of fraternity meetings from years goneby,
which bear odd resemblance themselves to meetings of any
Senate anywhere.
H. Donald Winbigler, Secretary to both the University
and the Senate, makes Chace sound like Ted Kennedy
before Chappaquiddick. He is, Winbigler submits,
"probably the most generally and widely respected member
of the junior faculty." He is "very humane about trying to
find consensus," and "when he thinks the President has
made a mistake he's more likely to reveal this with a
question than with an assertion."
Winbigler is quick to cite his "ability to get to the heart
of issues and judge them on merit rather than their
association with any political perspective." Insiders say he
came to the Senate with a reputation, which he no longer
has, for being something of a radical.
English department chairman Bliss Carnochan describes
Chace as "a very, very solid person" who offers
"reassurance in the presence of circumstances that are
surrounded with such webs of feeling."
Larry Friedlander says he "has an extreme sense of
justice" and is "incredibly fair." Departmental colleague
and fellow Senator Ronald Rebholz, who draws criticism
for a nearly doctrinaire opposition to the President that
usually takes the form of assertions instead of questions,
praises Chace as being "so emminently sensible." Respect
for Chace is so widespread that you would think he has not
an enemy in the world. Except for one.
Does the name Bruce Franklin ring a bell?
. . . the old American speech of the haters of oppression
is new tonight in the mouth of an old woman from
Pittsburg of a husky bcilcrmaker from Frisco who hopped
freights clear from the Coast to come here in the mouth of
a Back Ray socialworker in the mouth of an Italian printer

of a hobo from Arkansas the language of the beaten nation
is not forgotten in our ears tonight. . .
"You talked to Franklin about me? What'd the bastard
say?" A startled Chace, his voice suddenly taut, stiffened
and leaned slightly forward in his office chair.
the men in the deathhouse made the old words new
before they died. . .
That's right. Associate Prof. H. Bruce Franklin, whom
the administration is trying to fire on grounds that he
incited violence during last February's antiwar protests at
Stanford. Chace and Franidin are labeled the only Marxist
literary critics in the English department.
Franklin insists that his personal comments about Chace
are strictkly off the record, but it is obvious there is
absolutely no love lost between them. His view of Chace,
he explains, is contained in the March, 1970 issue of
College English.
In an article entitled 'The Teaching of Literature in the
Highest Academies of the Empire," Franklin describes his
undergrad years at Amherst ("I despised them from the top
of their crew cuts to the soles of their white bucks, mostly

"probably the most generally
and widely respected
member of the junior
faculty"

hating the smug tweediness in between. My wildest
rebellion against the world of Amherst consisted of
slouching around in a dirty torn old leather jacket, not
shaving, and not cleaning my room. and criticizes
English professors who teach anti-proletarian values to an
elite group in an ivory tower.
Chace maintains the profession is becoming more
diversified than Franklin claims it to be.
The Minority Voices course, asserts Chace, "Could be
taught at many other places besides the University. I
wouldn't be afraid of taking it to worker groups. It's not
esoteric, not hermetically sealed in some sacred book."
Franklin is convinced a Marxist critic must also be a
revolutionary, hence Chace is no Marxist critic. Chace says
he believes in the basic principles Marx and Engels brought
forth, but is not a Leninist. He describes his Marxist
thought as "more clinical than action-oriented."
By his own admission Chace has "an ability — or a
weakness — to live within the system." Associate Prof, of
English Rob Polhemus suggests Chace will not "cut his ties
with the establishment" because he is wary of being "a
loser."
Chace thinks the Administration has good reason to seek
Franklin's dismissal, and charges Franklin with "shoddy
and manipulative use of the truth." He believes Franklin
has "no intellectual integrity," no respect for the academic
institutions Chace values as the best and strongest
American institutions.
"The reason the New Lcfl has chosen to attack
American academic life isn't because the universities are
connected with the war," Chace contends, "but because
they're so easy and understanding and soft and they're
nearby." He is troubled by the New Left's "childish vision
of social class," in which all workers are good and all bosses
bad. Leftists Chace admires include Noam Chomsky,
Christopher Lasch, and Stanford's Maoist economist John
Gurley.
So what, then, to make of this Chace?
He has no illusions about his roles within the University
("How often do you teach someone something? One
person one year?"). When he jokes so often and so easily
about what he does ("I've just cracked Canto XXXIII! It's

"How often do you teach
someone something? One
person one year?"

a terribly important new, boring research breakthrough."),
no one is more aware than him of the essential, ridiculous
truth in what he is saying; for he realizes truth is the
essence of humor.
He is surely some sort of good liberal, and does not
pretend that role is an extremely effective one. Outside the
University, Chace confesses, "I feel powerless." As for the
antiwar movement, he knows that the War has ground on
so long that "we've all fallen into routines. It's like a stage
show. I've gotten into the routine of a teacher."
But what kind of a good liberal? There is still this
hardness about him, this far from ignorant toughness, and
God knows good liberals aren't renowed for that. It is
evident in his office and in his classes. Particularly when he
reads aloud.
now their work is over the immigrants haters of
