The Best of Rashaan Roland Kirk — Rashaan Roland Kirk —Atlantic
5D1592.
*******
Rashaan is beyond belief. From the liner notes:
Rashaan Roland Kirk plays tenor sax, stritch, manzello, B-flat and
E-flat clarinets, flute, black puzzle flute, nose flute, black mystery
pipes, harmonium, piccolo, English horn, flexaphone, whistle, bass
drum, thundersheet, sock cymbal, bells, music box, palms, tympani,
gong, and applies the use of bird sounds and is also heard vocally on
Search For The Reason Why. (Note: A stritch is a straight alto sax,
and a manzello is similar to a soprano sax.)
He plays the above instruments individually and simultaneously
and it is impossible to determine which and how many of the
instruments are played at any given moment on any selection.
That's right. He plays three horns at once, maybe, like tenor,
manzello and stritch on "Volunteered Slavery," with
acknowledgements to Lennon, McCartney, and Jude. Or plays flute
while he sings, like on "A Laugh for Rory," written for his young son,
and maybe my favorite piece on the album.
Then there's this medley. First he plays "Sentimental Journey" on
one horn, then "Going Home" from Dvorak's "New World
Symphony" on another. Then he plays the two of them together,
both horns simultaneously, and before he's through, he's gone
through his tune "In Monument" and a whirlwind treatment of
"Lover" by Richard Rodgers.
A dynamite album, all the way. It will knock you out.
NOTE: There is no more mind-blowing experience than seeing,
hearing and feeling Rashaan in person, wailing away on three horns at
once.

PLASTIC DREAMS — The Modern Jazz Quartet — Atlantic 5D1589.
First of all, this definitely wins the album cover of the year award.
Even if it wasn't full of great music, the cover alone is worth the price
of the record. But, rest assured, the music is a delight.
This is some of the best sounds I have heard from the Modern Jazz
Quartet. They are, of course, perfection personified. So quiet and
subtle. Very intellectual, but don't let anyone tell you that the
emotion isn't there, too.
"Walkin' Stomp" surprised me quite a bit. Is there such a thing as
subtly funky?
"Plastic Dreams" is a strange tune. Latin-tinged, but John Lewis
plays harpsichord instead of piano, and drummer Connie Kay has a
high-pitched bell instead of a cymbal.
"Trav'lin' " has bassist Percy Heath making occasional use of an
Echo-plex, again in that inmitable subtle manner.
They've added some horns for "Variations on a Christmas Theme"
and 'Piazza Navona," playing John Lewis' Impeccable arrangements.
All in all, this is a fine, enjoyable record. — M.B.
