# Looking Back At The S.F. Opera Season
## 
### GARY SCHMIDGALL 
Opera-goers should remember
the 1971 season as a very good
year, and — what with the
11-week expedition into twelve
works closing last Sunday —
perhaps this is the moment for a
summary reminiscence as well as a
look ahead to Spring Opera and
next Fall's possibilities.
Great voices can carry a
company far toward success, even
when other aspects seem in
arrears, and magnificent singers
certainly proliferated this year.
Indeed, they helped the S.F.
Opera to reach the highest general
standards I have experienced in
the Opera House: three utter
triumphs, six comfortable
victories, two narrow defeats and
one stand-off.
Three productions provided
completely satisfying
musical-dramatic experiences. The
new production of "Manon" was
extravagantly charming, as were
its ill-fated lovers Beverly Sills and
Nicolai Gedda. Indeed, it banished
once and for all the nagging
suspicion that Massenet's finest
work is irremediably tawdry.
Strauss's "Der Rosenkavalier"
— one of the most problematical
of all concededly great operas —
was given a remarkably intelligent,

sophisticated (as opposed to
syrupy and sentimental)
performance by a brilliant cast.
The highlight was surely Christa
Ludwig's famous Octavian (a role
she is soon to relinquish forever).
Virtuosic Achievement
Finally, to my mind the most
virtuosic and complete
achievement of the season, Anja
Silja in the title role of Berg's
"Lulu," made that opera the
darkhorse hit of the year; that is,
if unwincing dissection of
desperate characters is to your
liking.
Other of the Company's
offerings were generally happy
events though marred in one way
or another. Saddest of these was
the new "Meistersinger," which
had an earthshakingly fine cast
and which found both chorus and
orchestra in best voice. The rub,
alas, turned out to be scanty,
ill-conceived sets and some
bumble-brained stage direction.
Tchaikovsky's rather limpid
"Eugene Onegin" was given a very
congenial English S.F. premiere,
but it seems that, even taken at its
best, "Onegin" may really be
irremediably tawdry.
Solid Revival
Martina Arroyo managed to
spark a solid revival of Verdi's

"Un ballo in maschera," and after
a while tenor Luciano Pavarotti
took part of the load off her
shoulders. A new director, Piero
Faggioni, helped to enliven the
rather stodgy 1965 production.
Faggioni also provided tight
direction for the new setting of
Puccini's splendid one-act "II
tabarro," though little of it
rubbed off on the star of that
show, Leontyne Price.
Incomparable coloratura
vocaiism was almost enough to
send an American premiere of
Donizetti's "Maria Stuarda" to
the top of the list; Joan
Sutherland and Huguette
Tourangeau left audiences
shouting with delight. The sets
and stage direction for "Maria,"
however, were just too bad for
words. The Company's special
way with Carl Orff's "Carmina
Burana" is thrilling, and so it was
this year inspite of a raggedy
augmented chorus and
less-than-incisive conducting.
The two disappointments were
"Madama Butterfly" and "II
trovatore." The former, though
visually fine and nicely
choreographed, lacked the right
voices in the principal roles. "II
trovatore" is a production that
takes place mostly in "night with
hue so black" and it has other
infelicities that magnify the
silliness of the plot. And then the
cast had its problems (the
combination of Price and Placido
Domingo is reported to have been
a smashing success). James
McCracken, as Manrico, gave the
most distastefully mannered
performance of the year — a sad
event to report for I count his
Otello as one of the masterpieces
in my experience.
Stand-Off
The visit of the English Opera
Group was a reall stand-off. I
admire Britten's "A Midsummer
Night's Dream" immensely; it is
one of the three best attempts
(out of over 200!) to translate
Shakespeare into opera, and the
only one that uses the original
words verbatim.
But Britten calls it a "chamber
opera," and it just could not fill
the Opera House. The opera's
delicacy, not to mention the
singers' diction, were swallowed
up. Still, if one was close enough
to hear without cupping hands to

ears, the production itself was
wonderful in almost every respect.
Individual flashes of brilliance
demand mention: Two comic
tours de force come quickly to
mind, Manfred Jungwirth as
Baron Ochs and SirGeraint Evans
as Beckmesser. Mezzo Huguette
Tourangeau, as Elizabeth in
"Maria Stuarda," brought the
most exciting new voice of the
season. Theo Adam rendered a
humane and spiritually expansive
Sachs in "Meistersinger," and
Gabriel Bacquier made a stunning
debut in the cryingly small role of
Michele in "II tabarro."
Two tenors, Ragnar Ulfung and
John Walker, gave consistently
superior accounts in various
character parts throughout the
season. The finest conducting was
turned in by Otmar Suitner in the
Wagner, Silvio Varviso in
"Rosenkavalier," and Christoph
von Dohnanyi in "Lulu." Paul
Hager's omnipresent stage
direction saw the best "Lulu" and
worst "Meistersinger" of times.
The productions of "Manon" and
"Onegin" were also quite
successful.
Radio Broadcasts
The season's great innovation,
the stereo radio broadcasts,
deserve comment, if only to say
that the sound achieved by KKHI
left nothing to be desired, and the
presentation and intermission
features were tastefully, if
occasionally a bit innocuously
presented. The calm,
unpretentious air about the whole
series was in refreshing contrast to
the rather more frantic
hullabullco of the Metropolitan
Opera broadcasts.
For the near future we will
have to become inured to less
extravagant vocal fare. Still, some
interesting items are appearing on
the horizon. Spring Opera Theater
(which, moved up into February,
should consider changing its
name!) will present tnree operas
in its experimental format. First,
the non plus u!tra of comic opera
"The Barber of Seville" by
Rossini (in English); then just
about the first opera,
Monteverdi's "Orfeo" (in English
and Italian); and finally the
Brecht-Weill collaboration "The
Rise and Fall of the City of
Mahagonny" (1930). Also to look
forward to in early March is the

Stanford Music Department's Bay
Area premiere of Dvorak's
intriguing opera on the Ondine
legend, "Rusalka."
Finally, what about next year?
The Company's director, Kurt
Adler, has made only one firm
disclosure, namely, that there will
be three complete "Ring Cycles."
All the rest is speculation, but
some of the rumors (repeat,
rumors) are so pleasant to
contemplate that I will pass them
along: Birgit Nilsson in the "Ring
Cycles," Joan Sutherland in a new
"Norma," Beverly Sills in "Lucia

di Lammermoor," a return to
Mozart with "Le nozze di
Figaro," a "Tosca" with Leonie
Rysanek, and perhaps a new opera
of some kind.
Lastly, I should like to add a
list of singers whose presence is to
be devoutly wished for in the next
or succeeding seasons: Dietrich
Fischer-Dieskau, Placido
Domingo, Gabriel Bacquier,
Sherrill Milnes, Shirley Verrett,
and (dare I say it.. . yes, the
greatest soprano vocalist of the
day) Montserrat Caballe.
