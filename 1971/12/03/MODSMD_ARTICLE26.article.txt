## Ozawa's Opening Night 
### STEVEN UNGAR 
Maestro Seiji Ozawa is now in his second season
with the San Francisco Symphony, and
Wednesday's opening program before an audience
consisting almost entirely of college students,
seemed designed to convince skeptics that he and
the orchestra were able to play just about anything.
There has been some criticism that Ozawa is
moving a bit too slowly to update the Symphony
program with modern works, particularly of
American origin. Ozawa counters that this is a
growing period for the orchestra, that the modern
repertoire must wait until the musicians are ready
for it.
So, while this year's program features some truly
fine guest artists, the music itself will offer few
surprises.
After the opening work, nothing could be too
surprising. In one of the more bizarre moments of
Musical Americana, Maestro Ozawa strode
forcefully to the podium, bowed, motioned to his
musical legions, which rose as a man (except the
cellos) and launched into a rather bland rendition of
Our National Anthem.
I have never been to a concert of a majoi
symphony orchestra which began with The Star
Spangled Banner. I don't know if this was a
one-time season opener, or an innovation that will
be a feature of all future concerts. But the
Symphony played it, so I guess I have to review it.
Musical Joke
The major impressions left with the audience
were, first, that The Star Spangled Banner is a truly
inferior piece of music, second, hat the Stanford
Band has a much better version which it should
offer to the Symphony in case this is to become
standard procedure, as at hockey games, and third,
while it was natural enough for the audience to
stand when it was played, why did the orchestra feel
compelled to do so also?
The remainder of Maestro Ozawa's program was
a musicological pot-luck that combined two unknown
selections from the Classic and Romantic periods
with a (perhaps the) masterpiece N f
twentieth-century music, Stravinsky's Le Sacre c.
Prin temps.
The program opened (if you ignore the patriotic
prologue) with a seldom performed early work by
Hector Berlioz, the Overture to Les Franc-Juges
Judges of the Secret Court). This is one of Berlioz's
early works, the only portion of the opera Les
Franc-Juges that Beriioz allowed to survive (he
burned the rest).
It is pleasant enough, sounding more like a
pastiche of Rossini and Verdi than Berlioz. As an
early work, it must have been most impressive. But
it is not hard to see why it is seldom played.
Compared to later efforts, many have which have
properly earned a place in the standard repertoire,
Les Franc-Juges is a bit anemic.
The second work on the program was an equally
obscure piece by Franz Joseph Haydn, his
Symphony No. 90 in C Major. Haydn wrote 108
symphonies, and it really would be asking a bit
much to expect all of them to be memorable. The
Symphony No. 90 is one of those that remind us
that Papa Haydn was human after all.
Relaxing Music
It's not bad—it's just not one of the more
exciting works of the past four centuries. Haydn, of
course, was not writing to excite 1,200 bourgeois
college students. His music was designed to
entertain a small audience of European nobility. It

was meant to relax. Which may account for the
sleeping figures around me.
I thought it was kind of nice.
After the intermission, which in many respects
resembled a Stanford reunion, came le piece de
resistance. Nobody really cared about the Berlioz
and the Haydn. This was a young audience that
wanted to hear what Ozawa and the Symphony
could do with a fire-eater like The Rite of Spring
It really was an open question. The Symphony
had easily negotiated the first two works, playing
the Beriioz with the proper Romantic lushness, the
Haydn with the correct Classic control. Ozawa, who
seems to have learned mime from former tutor
Bernstein, played right along with them, making
graceful swan dives into the violins in the first piece,
standing erect and dignified like a Vienese soldier in
the Haydn.
Test Piece
The Stravinsky showed the orchestra's weaknesses
a bit more. This is, of course, one of the most
exciting, difficult and notorious compositions of the
last hundred years, one of the few to have inspired a
bona fide riot at its premier in 1913. Its complex
rhythms and sudden changes in dynamics can play
havoc with a second-rate orchestra or conductor.
Apparently, the San Francisco Symphony is no
longer second-rate. With the exception of some
questionable horn passages and the over-exuberance
of the percussionist responsible for the cymbals,
the orchestra sounded fine. The Sacrificial Dance in
the finale almost did them in, but they pulled out
of it nicely.
It's easy to say that the performance was
spirited. It's hard to imagine a performance of Le
Sacre that is not spirited. I didn't find it as exciting
as I would have liked, but it was a first rate effort
nonetheless. Ozawa was almost as animated as the
music, swaying, jumping, crouching, pointing.
"He's darling," cood a sweet young thing sitting
near me. Indeed, he is.

American origin. Ozawa counters that this is a
growing period for the orchestra, that the modern
repertoire must wait until the musicians are ready
for it.
So, while this year's program features some truly
fine guest artists, the music itself will offer few
surprises.
After the opening work, nothing could be too
surprising. In one of the more bizarre moments of
Musical Americana, Maestro Ozawa strode
forcefully to the podium, bowed, motioned to his
musical legions, which rose as a man (except the
cellos) and launched into a rather bland rendition of
Our National Anthem.
I have never been to a concert of a majoi
symphony orchestra which began with The Star
Spangled Banner. I don't know if this was a
one-time season opener, or an innovation that will
be a feature of all future concerts. But the
Symphony played it, so I guess I have to review it.
Musical Joke
The major impressions left with the audience
were, first, that The Star Spangled Banner is a truly
inferior piece of music, second, hat the Stanford
Band has a much better version which it should
offer to the Symphony in case this is to become
standard procedure, as at hockey games, and third,
while it was natural enough for the audience to
stand when it was played, why did the orchestra feel
compelled to do so also?
The remainder of Maestro Ozawa's program was
a musicological pot-luck that combined two unknown
selections from the Classic and Romantic periods
with a (perhaps the) masterpiece N f
twentieth-century music, Stravinsky's Le Sacre c.
Prin temps.
The program opened (if you ignore the patriotic
prologue) with a seldom performed early work by
Hector Berlioz, the Overture to Les Franc-Juges
Judges of the Secret Court). This is one of Berlioz's
early works, the only portion of the opera Les
Franc-Juges that Beriioz allowed to survive (he
burned the rest).
It is pleasant enough, sounding more like a
pastiche of Rossini and Verdi than Berlioz. As an
early work, it must have been most impressive. But
it is not hard to see why it is seldom played.
Compared to later efforts, many have which have
properly earned a place in the standard repertoire,
Les Franc-Juges is a bit anemic.
The second work on the program was an equally
obscure piece by Franz Joseph Haydn, his
Symphony No. 90 in C Major. Haydn wrote 108
symphonies, and it really would be asking a bit
much to expect all of them to be memorable. The
Symphony No. 90 is one of those that remind us
that Papa Haydn was human after all.
Relaxing Music
It's not bad—it's just not one of the more
exciting works of the past four centuries. Haydn, of
course, was not writing to excite 1,200 bourgeois
college students. His music was designed to
entertain a small audience of European nobility. It

was meant to relax. Which may account for the
sleeping figures around me.
I thought it was kind of nice.
After the intermission, which in many respects
resembled a Stanford reunion, came le piece de
resistance. Nobody really cared about the Berlioz
and the Haydn. This was a young audience that
wanted to hear what Ozawa and the Symphony
could do with a fire-eater like The Rite of Spring
It really was an open question. The Symphony
had easily negotiated the first two works, playing
the Beriioz with the proper Romantic lushness, the
Haydn with the correct Classic control. Ozawa, who
seems to have learned mime from former tutor
Bernstein, played right along with them, making
graceful swan dives into the violins in the first piece,
standing erect and dignified like a Vienese soldier in
the Haydn.
Test Piece
The Stravinsky showed the orchestra's weaknesses
a bit more. This is, of course, one of the most
exciting, difficult and notorious compositions of the
last hundred years, one of the few to have inspired a
bona fide riot at its premier in 1913. Its complex
rhythms and sudden changes in dynamics can play
havoc with a second-rate orchestra or conductor.
Apparently, the San Francisco Symphony is no
longer second-rate. With the exception of some
questionable horn passages and the over-exuberance
of the percussionist responsible for the cymbals,
the orchestra sounded fine. The Sacrificial Dance in
the finale almost did them in, but they pulled out
of it nicely.
It's easy to say that the performance was
spirited. It's hard to imagine a performance of Le
Sacre that is not spirited. I didn't find it as exciting
as I would have liked, but it was a first rate effort
nonetheless. Ozawa was almost as animated as the
music, swaying, jumping, crouching, pointing.
"He's darling," cood a sweet young thing sitting
near me. Indeed, he is.

forcefully to the podium, bowed, motioned to his
musical legions, which rose as a man (except the
cellos) and launched into a rather bland rendition of
Our National Anthem.
I have never been to a concert of a majoi
symphony orchestra which began with The Star
Spangled Banner. I don't know if this was a
one-time season opener, or an innovation that will
be a feature of all future concerts. But the
Symphony played it, so I guess I have to review it.
Musical Joke
The major impressions left with the audience
were, first, that The Star Spangled Banner is a truly
inferior piece of music, second, hat the Stanford
Band has a much better version which it should
offer to the Symphony in case this is to become
standard procedure, as at hockey games, and third,
while it was natural enough for the audience to
stand when it was played, why did the orchestra feel
compelled to do so also?
The remainder of Maestro Ozawa's program was
a musicological pot-luck that combined two unknown
selections from the Classic and Romantic periods
with a (perhaps the) masterpiece N f
twentieth-century music, Stravinsky's Le Sacre c.
Prin temps.
The program opened (if you ignore the patriotic
prologue) with a seldom performed early work by
Hector Berlioz, the Overture to Les Franc-Juges
Judges of the Secret Court). This is one of Berlioz's
early works, the only portion of the opera Les
Franc-Juges that Beriioz allowed to survive (he
burned the rest).
It is pleasant enough, sounding more like a
pastiche of Rossini and Verdi than Berlioz. As an
early work, it must have been most impressive. But
it is not hard to see why it is seldom played.
Compared to later efforts, many have which have
properly earned a place in the standard repertoire,
Les Franc-Juges is a bit anemic.
The second work on the program was an equally
obscure piece by Franz Joseph Haydn, his
Symphony No. 90 in C Major. Haydn wrote 108
symphonies, and it really would be asking a bit
much to expect all of them to be memorable. The
Symphony No. 90 is one of those that remind us
that Papa Haydn was human after all.
Relaxing Music
It's not bad—it's just not one of the more
exciting works of the past four centuries. Haydn, of
course, was not writing to excite 1,200 bourgeois
college students. His music was designed to
entertain a small audience of European nobility. It

was meant to relax. Which may account for the
sleeping figures around me.
I thought it was kind of nice.
After the intermission, which in many respects
resembled a Stanford reunion, came le piece de
resistance. Nobody really cared about the Berlioz
and the Haydn. This was a young audience that
wanted to hear what Ozawa and the Symphony
could do with a fire-eater like The Rite of Spring
It really was an open question. The Symphony
had easily negotiated the first two works, playing
the Beriioz with the proper Romantic lushness, the
Haydn with the correct Classic control. Ozawa, who
seems to have learned mime from former tutor
Bernstein, played right along with them, making
graceful swan dives into the violins in the first piece,
standing erect and dignified like a Vienese soldier in
the Haydn.
Test Piece
The Stravinsky showed the orchestra's weaknesses
a bit more. This is, of course, one of the most
exciting, difficult and notorious compositions of the
last hundred years, one of the few to have inspired a
bona fide riot at its premier in 1913. Its complex
rhythms and sudden changes in dynamics can play
havoc with a second-rate orchestra or conductor.
Apparently, the San Francisco Symphony is no
longer second-rate. With the exception of some
questionable horn passages and the over-exuberance
of the percussionist responsible for the cymbals,
the orchestra sounded fine. The Sacrificial Dance in
the finale almost did them in, but they pulled out
of it nicely.
It's easy to say that the performance was
spirited. It's hard to imagine a performance of Le
Sacre that is not spirited. I didn't find it as exciting
as I would have liked, but it was a first rate effort
nonetheless. Ozawa was almost as animated as the
music, swaying, jumping, crouching, pointing.
"He's darling," cood a sweet young thing sitting
near me. Indeed, he is.

Seiji Ozawa conducted the opening concert Wednesday night.

Maestro Seiji Ozawa is now in his second season
with the San Francisco Symphony, and
Wednesday's opening program before an audience
consisting almost entirely of college students,
seemed designed to convince skeptics that he and
the orchestra were able to play just about anything.
There has been some criticism that Ozawa is
moving a bit too slowly to update the Symphony
program with modern works, particularly of
American origin. Ozawa counters that this is a
growing period for the orchestra, that the modern
repertoire must wait until the musicians are ready
for it.
So, while this year's program features some truly
fine guest artists, the music itself will offer few
surprises.
After the opening work, nothing could be too
surprising. In one of the more bizarre moments of
Musical Americana, Maestro Ozawa strode
forcefully to the podium, bowed, motioned to his
