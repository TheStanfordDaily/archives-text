# The 						Gospel According To The Michigan Wolverines
## 
### Special to the Daily from THE MICHIGAN DAILY By ELLIOT LEGOW 
When the 1971 football season
kicked off last September
Michigan knew it had a good
team, a team picked in pre season
polls as one of the nation's ten
best, and chosen to win the Big
Ten title.
But no one knew how good
the Wolverines really would be.
Everyone was worried about
replacing key defensive players
like Henry Hill, Marty Huff, and
Jim Betts and strengthening the
offensive line.
The defense, instead of
slipping from last season's
prominence reached a new peak
and has led the nation in
defending against the rush and
preventing scoring. After some
early season problems the line
blocking has also again become
top-notch.
But the biggest roadblock seen
in the way of an undefeated
season was the lack of suitable
replacement for Don Moorhead
at quarterback. Without a skillful
passer and ball-handler, it was
assumed the Wolverines could not
hope to match last year's 9-1
performance.
When the season opened at
Northwestern in the Wolverines'
earliest Big Ten opener on record,
Bo Schembechler chose
sophomore Kevin Casey to lead
the Michigan attack. Casey had
some trouble generating a
Michigan offensive attack early
but the defense contained the
Wildcats and gave the offense the

breaks needed to salvage a 21-6
victory.
Bo Rather scored two of the
Wolverines' touchdowns — one
on a surprise end-around play
which Schembechler hasn't used
since and again by recovering a
blocked field goal in the
Northwestern end zone.
After that treacherous start in
Evanston the Wolverines came
back home for three of the
easiest games since the days of
Fielding Yost's point-a-minute
teams.
Consecutive shutouts of
Virginia, UCLA, and Navy by
56-0, 38-0, and 46-0 counts gave
the Michigan third and fourth
stringers plenty of work and
helped Michigan in the polls but
didn't really provide the
Wolverines with any good tests.
Against Virginia, Michigan
utilized 18 different backs
including all five quarterbacks,
amassed total yardage of 562
yards including 491 on the
ground and recorded 33 first
downs. The passing attack
remained rather dormant but
obviously wasn't of much
concern in an eight touchdown
victory.
Ed Shuttlesworth made his
initial home performance an
impressive one by bulling for 107
yards in 16 carries to lead the
Michigan offense. Bill Taylor and
Harry Banks each scored twice
and Dana Coin continued his long
extra point string with eight good
boots.

The UCLA game was more of
the same — a strong defense
overwhelmed the Bruins, forced
them into costly mistakes, and
gave the Michigan offense the ball
in good scoring position. The
Wolverines registered 17 quick
first quarter points and the
outcome was never in doubt as
most of the Bruins' 216 yards in
total yardage came in the closing
minutes of the game.
And then another non-game
against Navy. This time the
Wolverines' defense held the
Middies to only 71 yards in total
offense including 34 in rushing
gains for a two week total of 73.
While Michigan's rushers con
tinued to move at will the pass
ing inefficiency was beginning
to cause worries. Schembechler
experimented with Casey, Tom
Slade, and Larry Cipa against
the Midshipmen and Slade was
the most impresive, hiting on
four of seven passes and mov
ing the t°am well.
So, with the Big Ten season
opening up again at Michigan
State in a battle where both
coachs always like to spring a
few surprises, Schembechler de
cided to switch to Slade after
finally revealing that Casey
had been injured all season.
However, Duffy Daugherty
had a few surprises of his own
for Michigan as his team opened
the nationally-televised grudge
match operating out of a wish
bone formation.
Slade didn't fare much bet
ter than Casey with his passing,
hitting only three of nine, but
he executed the option success
fully and moved the Wolverines
in for two key fourth quarter
scores in icing the hard-fought
24-13 triumph.
The wishbone didn't really
perturb the defensemen who
expected "that the Spartans
would try something new." The
188 total yards gained by MSU
included only 59 and the ground
as the Michigan defenders suc
cesfully contained the Spartan
flea, Eric Allen.
After that Michigan came
home again for another patsy,
Illinois, and despite some first

period mistakes, overwhelmed
the Illini 35-6.
Slade's first pass of the game,
on the ooening play of the game
was intercented by the Illini
and Michigan was trailing 6-0
three plays later.
But the Illini lead was short
lived as Michigan onened up a
21-6 halftime advantage and
coasted in with the win. Again
the defense excelled, limiting
Illinois to 83 total yards and
Glenn Doughty made his first
significant offensive contribution,
scoring three touchdowns, his
first of the season and rushing
for 48 yards.
The next weekend in
Minnesota Michigan met a new
threat — the forward pass. The
Gophers 1 Craig Curry pierced the
Wolverine defense for 193 passing
yards but managed only one
score on a 73 yard bomb to
flanker George Honza. That
second quarter score tied the
game at 7-7 but Michigan rallied
for a 35-7 win. Taylor ground out
168 yards in 33 gallops against
the grounded Gophers and
surpassed Ron Johnson's
Michigan career rushing mark.
But. thp passing attack a<?ain
fell flat. Slade and Larry Cioa
combined for only two comnle
tions in tpn attempts but what
can be bettpr than a 35-7 con
ference win anyway?
Maybp a 61-7 nastiner of In
diana or a 63-7 devastation of
the lowa Hawkpyps. Neither of
those games nroduced much ex
citement and even the scores.
Michigan's highest in 23 years
seempd Insignificant after earli
er 56-0 wins.
The yards came easy against
both of the T's as Michigan net
ted 489 of them against Indiana
and 559 aeainst lowa. Each
game included onlv thrpe com
pletpd passes but why whpn
you havp bacVs like Taylor who
ripnpd off 17*? vards in. 11 rar
rips against Indiana. Ed Shut
tlesworth who averaged spven
ppr romp while netting 112
acainst lowa, and resprve Alan
Walker who totaled 185 in the
two eames.
After that nair of boring

romns, Michigan fans were ra
ther unnrenared for the Gruel
ing nail-bitpr against Purdue
the next week. No. 500 vards of
offensive totals or 50 vard de
fensive nerformances highlight
ed that en me and most of the
second string never even got
into the game.
But Slade finally nroved he
could pass and Schembechler
found a way for Michigan to
move without an effective Tay
lor leading the way.
Purdue even managed to score
two touchdowns and 17 noints
aeainst the Wolverines and the
eamo wasn't decided until Dana
Coin kicked a 25 vard field eoal
with 45 seconds left to save the
Wolverine's unbeaten season
with a 20-17 win.
That set the stage for the
Wolverines' annual blood match
with Woody's boys from Colum
bus. Although the Buckeyes had
registered two consecutive loss
es and numerous major injuries
no one was surprised by the
tough battle they gave Michigan.

Defenses and fumbles nrevail
ed as Michigan led at halftime
3-0 behind another crucial Coin
field goal. A Michigan shutout
still seemed quite nossible until
Tom Camnana broke loose on
punt return and scnotpd 85 yards
for a Buckeye touchdown mid
wav through the third quarter.
The defenses then went back to
work, stifling any offensive ex
plosions and Michigan still trail
ed, 7-3, when the Wolverines
took over on their own 28 with
only 7:03 remaining. But then
Larry Cioa. in at quarterback
for the injured Slade and his
backfield of Taylor, Shuttles
worth. and Doughty shifted the
offense into high gear.
Marchine down the field in five
minutes. Michigan left it to Tay
lor to race the last 21 yards be
hind a spectacular block by Fritz
Seyferth and be greeted in the
endzone by cheering Wolverine
players and fans.
And there was lots more fun
to come in those two minutes

remaining, like Tom Darden's
interception of a Don Lamka pass
and the ensuing demonstration of
Ohio State sportsmanship by
Hayes before a record crowd of
104,016 as he stormed the field,
argued with the referees, and
then began to tear handy parts of
Michigan Stadium into little
pieces.
So, the Wolverines had man
aged to compile the first un
beaten regular season mark in
23 years of Michigan football.
They produced All-Americans in
guard Reggie McKenzie, line
backer Mike Taylor, and tail
back Bill Taylor. They had out
scored the opposition by a lop
sided 409-70 count. But they still
weren't finished.
To achieve fulfillment of all
their pre-season goals the Wol
verines now only have to sweep
past Stanford in the Rose Bowl
and atone for their 10-3 loss to
USC two years ago. And why
should anyone expect them not
to?
