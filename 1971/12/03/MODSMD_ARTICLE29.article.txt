# Whad'ya Hear, Whad'ya Say
## Here We Go Again 
### Charlie Hoffman 
Once again the Stanford Indians are going to meet a high powered
and highly confident Big Ten Champion in the Rose Bowl on New
Year's Day, and the thought of Stanford upsetting the Wolverines has
not even occurred to most observers in Ann Arbor or anywhere in the
country for that matter.
Everyone is talking about the Nebraska-Alabama game and the
confrontation in the Sugar Bowl between Oklahoma and Auburn. Any
mention of the Rose Bowl was typified by Al De Rogatis' comment
during an NBC telecast last weekend that "Michigan, a fine team to
watch, will be playing in t.ie Rose Bowl." There was no mention of
the Wolverines' opponent.
The Wolverines are uniformly confident and heavily favored, but
John Ralston's Indians would not have it any other way. Over the past
two years, the Cards have won every game in which they were
underdogs, yet lost most of the contests in which they were heavily
favored.
Jeff Siemon explained this by saying that "It is hard to get super
excited about a game unless you are the underdog." Siemon then
pointed out the classic examples of this phenomenon last season, the
USC game and the Rose Bowl.
On paper, Michigan should run Stanford out of the Rose Bowl. The
Wolverines are 10-0 this year and have won 25 out of their last 26
regular season games. They have scored 409 points this season to 70
for their opponents.
Statistics are important, but they will mean nothing to the fired-up
Indians on January Ist. The Indians pulled off a startling upset last
year in the Pasadena classic and they fj!!y intend to do it again. When
asked about how he felt about this year's Rose Bowl, offensive tackle
Bill Meyers smiled wryly, "It's going to be a lot of fun?"
I believe him.

The extreme confidence in Ann Arbor is not limited to followers
of the varsity football team. The Michigan Daily ran the following
note concerning the Ink Rose Bowl to be played on December 31st at
Pasadena's Brookside Park just south of the Rose Bowl at 11:30 a.m.
"Those effete snobs will have to recognize the ability of our team
after we crush the California upstarts." The Michigan Daily's foolish
stand forces us into the position of having to inflict two upsets on the
aggravating Ann Arborions.

Year's Day, and the thought of Stanford upsetting the Wolverines has
not even occurred to most observers in Ann Arbor or anywhere in the
country for that matter.
Everyone is talking about the Nebraska-Alabama game and the
confrontation in the Sugar Bowl between Oklahoma and Auburn. Any
mention of the Rose Bowl was typified by Al De Rogatis' comment
during an NBC telecast last weekend that "Michigan, a fine team to
watch, will be playing in t.ie Rose Bowl." There was no mention of
the Wolverines' opponent.
The Wolverines are uniformly confident and heavily favored, but
John Ralston's Indians would not have it any other way. Over the past
two years, the Cards have won every game in which they were
underdogs, yet lost most of the contests in which they were heavily
favored.
Jeff Siemon explained this by saying that "It is hard to get super
excited about a game unless you are the underdog." Siemon then
pointed out the classic examples of this phenomenon last season, the
USC game and the Rose Bowl.
On paper, Michigan should run Stanford out of the Rose Bowl. The
Wolverines are 10-0 this year and have won 25 out of their last 26
regular season games. They have scored 409 points this season to 70
for their opponents.
Statistics are important, but they will mean nothing to the fired-up
Indians on January Ist. The Indians pulled off a startling upset last
year in the Pasadena classic and they fj!!y intend to do it again. When
asked about how he felt about this year's Rose Bowl, offensive tackle
Bill Meyers smiled wryly, "It's going to be a lot of fun?"
I believe him.

The extreme confidence in Ann Arbor is not limited to followers
of the varsity football team. The Michigan Daily ran the following
note concerning the Ink Rose Bowl to be played on December 31st at
Pasadena's Brookside Park just south of the Rose Bowl at 11:30 a.m.
"Those effete snobs will have to recognize the ability of our team
after we crush the California upstarts." The Michigan Daily's foolish
stand forces us into the position of having to inflict two upsets on the
aggravating Ann Arborions.
