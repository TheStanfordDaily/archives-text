# Bazile-Laury Trial
## Judge Denies Mistrial Motion 
### MELANIE PAUL ROBERT BACON 
A defense motion for a mistrial was
denied yesterday in the sixth day of the
assault trial of Leo Bazile and
Christopher Laury in Redwood City,
after defense attorneys completed
cross-examination of Mary Jane
Schmidt, victim of the aJleged assault.
The beating allegedly took place at
Schmidt's East Palo Alto apartment last
May 2. Schmidt is a staff member at
Stanford Medical Center and the two
defendants were active in labor disputes
at the hospital last April.
Thelton Henderson, Assistant Dean
of the Stanford Law School and
counsel for Bazile, introduced the
mistrial motion claiming the
prosecution was presenting prejudicial
testimony when Lt. James Hart of the
Santa Clara County's Sheriff's
Department testified he arrested Bazile
at the April 9 hospital sit-in.
Henderson claimed that an
agreement had been reached among all
parties that Bazile's previous arrest was
not to be introduced into evidence. He
said he felt that introducing testimony
about the arrest would be highly
prejudicial to his client, "particularly as

the jury is by no means a jury of his
peers." Both defendants and their
counsel are black; the eight-woman,
four-man jury is all white.
Judge Frank Rose denied the
motion, saying he felt the jury would
be able to disregard evidence as
instructed.
During the cross-examination of
Schmidt, Henderson questioned her
about her identification of Bazile in a
police line-up last May.
Henderson also established that the
car which Schmidt claimed was the
"getaway car" for her attackers could
have belonged to another tenant of the
apartment building.
Questioning Hart, Henderson asked
whether he considered the group in the
Medical Center corridor, which
included Bazile, to be distinct from
those sitting-in. Hart replied that as far
as he was concerned, they also were
demonstrators. Henderson noted that
there were news reporters, including
former Daily editor Felicity Barringer
and a KZSU staffer, in the group with
Bazile and asked if the officer
considered them demonstrators. "The
ones who were not with the officii
press, yes," Hart replied.

In further testimony, police officers
explained the details of arresting Laury
and Bazile and searching their homes.
More police are to take the witness
stand when the trial resumes in the San
Mateo County Superior Court at 9:30
a.m. today.

PERSONAL FOUL—Stanford has never been as efficient in distributing football tickets as it is in winning games. Several
thousand students were kept waiting yesterday for up to eight hours in the Maples Detention Facility, for the privilege of
shelling out ten bucks in exchange for a vulgar, blue and yellow entrance pass to this year's Smog Bowl Classic. A good time
was had by all.

PERSONAL FOUL—Stanford has never been as efficient in distributing football tickets as it is in winning games. Several
thousand students were kept waiting yesterday for up to eight hours in the Maples Detention Facility, for the privilege of
shelling out ten bucks in exchange for a vulgar, blue and yellow entrance pass to this year's Smog Bowl Classic. A good time
was had by all.
A defense motion for a mistrial was
denied yesterday in the sixth day of the
assault trial of Leo Bazile and
Christopher Laury in Redwood City,
after defense attorneys completed
cross-examination of Mary Jane
Schmidt, victim of the aJleged assault.
The beating allegedly took place at
Schmidt's East Palo Alto apartment last
May 2. Schmidt is a staff member at
Stanford Medical Center and the two
defendants were active in labor disputes
at the hospital last April.
Thelton Henderson, Assistant Dean
of the Stanford Law School and
counsel for Bazile, introduced the
mistrial motion claiming the
prosecution was presenting prejudicial
testimony when Lt. James Hart of the
Santa Clara County's Sheriff's
Department testified he arrested Bazile
at the April 9 hospital sit-in.
Henderson claimed that an
agreement had been reached among all
parties that Bazile's previous arrest was
not to be introduced into evidence. He
said he felt that introducing testimony
about the arrest would be highly
prejudicial to his client, "particularly as

the jury is by no means a jury of his
peers." Both defendants and their
counsel are black; the eight-woman,
four-man jury is all white.
Judge Frank Rose denied the
motion, saying he felt the jury would
be able to disregard evidence as
instructed.
During the cross-examination of
Schmidt, Henderson questioned her
about her identification of Bazile in a
police line-up last May.
Henderson also established that the
car which Schmidt claimed was the
"getaway car" for her attackers could
have belonged to another tenant of the
apartment building.
Questioning Hart, Henderson asked
whether he considered the group in the
Medical Center corridor, which
included Bazile, to be distinct from
those sitting-in. Hart replied that as far
as he was concerned, they also were
demonstrators. Henderson noted that
there were news reporters, including
former Daily editor Felicity Barringer
and a KZSU staffer, in the group with
Bazile and asked if the officer
considered them demonstrators. "The
ones who were not with the officii
press, yes," Hart replied.

In further testimony, police officers
explained the details of arresting Laury
and Bazile and searching their homes.
More police are to take the witness
stand when the trial resumes in the San
Mateo County Superior Court at 9:30
a.m. today.
