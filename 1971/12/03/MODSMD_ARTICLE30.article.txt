# 90-33 Romp
## Frosh Cagers Impressive 
### MARC SULLIVAN 
The highly touted Stanford Frosh basketball
team lived up to its advance notices Wednesday
night, crushing the University of California Medical
Center 90-33. Led by seven foot center Rich Kelly,
the freshman assumed command early and retained
it. After jumping out to a 6-0 lead, the Medical
Center came back to tie it at 10-10, but from then
on it was no contest. During one stretch in the first
half, the Indians ran off twenty-four points without
reply from their opponents.
With the visitors unable to offer any serious
challenge, the Frosh did not display all their wares,
but still gave ample indication of why they are
probably the most highly regarded group of
freshman ever recruited for Stanford basketball. The
key is center Kelly, the tallest player ever to come
to Stanford.
In Wednesday's game he led all scorers with 20
and all rebounders with 16 despite playing only
about 28 minutes. He also, by unofficial count,
blocked 10 shots. He showed unusual agility for a
man of his size, once stealing the ball and dribbling
the length of the court for a lay-in. When Kelly
couldn't get inside he demonstrated a good, soft
touch on short and medium range jumpers. Right
now he needs only more experience and weight.
While Kelly is the focal point, he is not the only
star of the frosh team. Also regarded is 6'
guard Mark Gilberg, who scored eight points while
showing good quickness and an eye for the open
man. Also at guard were Mike Simons who scored
nine and Benjamin Bluitt, who netted 11.
At forward, Scott Trobbe and Melvin Arterberry
scored 14 and 15 points respectively. Both are a
little on the short side as forwards go, Trobbe being
6'6" and Arterberry 6'4" but their quickness and
ball-hawking instincts more than compensated. In
addition to his scoring, Trobbe picked off nine

rebounds, while Arterberry added seven. Arterberry
seems to be the man to lead most Tribe fast breaks,
as he did repeatedly Wednesday night. Early in the
second half he scored three straight baskets on fast
breaks.
With the game wrapped up early, Coach Clayton
"Bub" Bowling was able to make extensive use of
his reserves as 13 players saw action and the Tribe
scoring was divided between nine different players.
Of the reserves forwards Kevin Enright and David
Rompel saw the most action, getting five points and
four rebounds each.
The team statistics were also impressive. The
frosh shot 47% from the field and 62% from the
foul line. Equally important they avoided many of
the mistakes to be expected of a young team with
only limited experience of playing together. Though
they committed 20 turnovers most occurred when
the reserves were in. As a team the Indians
committed only eight fouls with no player having
more than one.
Last year's frosh were one of the best of recent
Stanford history, finishing 15-3. Indications are that
this year's edition may well surpass that record. Phil
Vukicevich, an assistant coach for Cal, down to
scout Stanford and Houston said about the frosh, "I
was impressed by their size and physical strength.
Offensively they were awfully strong. It's hard to
say defensively since they weren't tested."
Doubtless, somewhere along the line the
freshmen will be tested but failure seems unlikely.
They are blessed with good height, a dominant pivot
man, good speed and fine inside shooting. The only
possible question mark is consistent outside
shooting, but Gilberg and Simons will probably be
able to handle that. Stanford's basketball fortunes
seem to have a bright future to look forward to.

MISSED IT BY THAT MUCHâ€”Mike Mann leaps high while
attempting to block Dwight "Double D" Davis' shot. Although Mann
did not succeed on this play, he had a fine evening in his first varsity
game, scoring eight points and hauling down nine rebounds. Mr. Davis
also had a great night as he began his 1971-72 campaign for
All-American status, hitting for 21 points and 10 rebounds.
