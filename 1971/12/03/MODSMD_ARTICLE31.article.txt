Chilean Riots
SANTIAGO, Chile—Anti-Marxist
youths defied a declared state of
emergency yesterday and poured into
Santiago's downtown streets in a new
outburst against the leftist government
of President Salvador Allende.
The demonstrators were met
by hardhatted, stone-throwing
Marxists.
The demonstration tied up traffic
in the city's center, and riot police
fought the protesters with tear gas,
water cannon and clubs. The

disturbances followed an
anUgovernment march the night
before by thousands of women
banging pots and pans, protesting food
shortages.
Defending his government in a
speech last night, Allende vowed that
"only riddling me with bullets will
stop me from completing my program
for the people."
The Marxist president spoke at a
farewell rally of about 60,000 persons
for Prime Minister Fidel Castro of
Cuba, who is ending a three-week state
visit to Chile.

India Attacks
NEW DELHl—Prime Minister Indira
Gandhi ordered Indian troops
yesterday to make a new attack into
East Pakistan. Pakistani military
sources said the Indians attacked on
seven fronts supported by air power,
armor and artillery in their biggest
offensive yet. The sources, putting the
number of Indian divisions involved at
three to seven, said the fronts
stretched all around East Pakistan's
2,400-mile frontier with India. They
said the prime targets appeared to be
two northern airstrips, which were not
named.
Plan Postponed
WASHINGTON—President Nixon won
a major concession from House-Senate
conferees yesterday as they postponed
instigation of a Democratic-sponsored
presidential campaign financing plan
from 1972 until 1976.
The White House hinted strongly
that Nixon might now sign the tax
reduction bill, which authorizes
income taxpayers to set aside $1 of
their taxes for presidential campaigns.
Presidential press secretary Ronald
Ziegler said, however: "The President
will use whatever legislative procedure
he feels is effective to make sure the
checkoff system is not implemented."
