# senior Book Planned

### PATTY FELS 
Although there is no longer a Quad
yearbook, there are still remnants of a
Quad staff and an $8,000 Quad debt.
In an attempt to keep the
publication going and pay back Taylor
Publishing Company, the staff is
investigating the possibility of creating
a "senior book."
Letters were mailed this week to all
seniors asking them to have their
pictures taken for the proposed book.
The letter assures seniors that "the class
of 1972 will not be forgotten," and
advertises the book as "the first of its
kind to be produced at Stanford." It
emphasizes that "to make this book a
success every senior will want tq be
included" and gives an individual
appointment time.
Response to the letter has been low.
(Jut of 384 seniors scheduled for the
first two days of pictures on
Wednesday and Thursday, only 29 had
kept their appointments by yesterday
afternoon.
Ed Riddell, editor of the book, said
that the original letter promised that
there would be a senior book only if
enough people had their portraits
taken. However, his letter was edited
by Keith Cole Photographers because
"it sounded negative" and the new
letter gave the impression that the book
was definitely going to be published.
Without some sort of financial
guarantee, perhaps from the Senior
Class, the book can't be produced.

"From now on, each senior will be told
that there isn't necessarily going to be a
senior book," Riddell said.
Tom Huseby, ASSU Student
Financial Manager, said that Riddell
had first assured him that the letter
made it clear that the book was only a
possibility. "He should have gone to
the Publications Board before he sent
the letter out," said Huseby. "What he
did was actually a very good move, had
he made it clear that there wasn't
necessarily going to be a senior book.
Unfortuntely, he didn't and, in that
way, it was a very bad move. There has
been a great misunderstanding."
