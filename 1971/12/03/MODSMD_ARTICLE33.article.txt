# Faculty, Student Senates Meet
## 
### 
The Faculty Senate dealt with
several controversial points yesterday,
but an anticipated debate over research
guidlines failed to develop. The
Senate, instead, authorized the
preparation of a point-by-point listing
of the substantive issues in preparation
for full debate in the next session.
The proposed guidelines would
allow the individual .researcher to
"accept external sponsorship for
research programs based on the
scholarly merits . . . and its relation to
the educational functions of the
University, and not on speculations
concerning the future use of its
results."

The Student Senate last night
decided not to reopen Senate elections
to include the voters on European
campuses.
After extended debate about the
rights of student voters vs. the Senate's
image of stability, the election was
upheld 10-9. It also endorsed an
investigation into the possibility of
establishing a Consumer Information
Center for students.
Considerations of proposed revisions
in the Council of Fifteen judicial
regulations were halted by lack of a
quorum. Many Senators objected to the
revisions because they allow "too much
discretion" to the Council in when to
prosecute.
