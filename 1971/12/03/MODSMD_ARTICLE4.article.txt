# Stanford Plans Huge Fund Drive; Seeks $260 Million In 5 Years

### ROBERT BACON 
Planning is underway at Stanford for
a five-year university-wide fund-raising
campaign with a goal of at least $260
million.
The fund drive, two years in the
planning stages, will be formally set in
motion "within this academic year,"
according to Vice President for
Development Kenneth M. Cuthbertson.
It is to be the largest fund drive by a
private educational institution in
history, seeking to raise Stanford's gift
income from $30 million per yea- to
more than $50 million. University
financial officials have concluded that

"Stanford's financial health is
dependent upon a striking increase of
private gift support" since substantial
increases cannot be expected in tuition,
federal grants, and land development
income.
Expendable gifts fund about 18 per
cent of the university's annual
operating budget, with an equal
amount provided by income from the
university endowment. Much of the
current gift income is earmarked for
endowment or construction and only
about half can bo spent on university
operations.
Current interest in the fund drive
was set off last week when Newsweek
reported that the plans were underway.
Monday the San Francisco Examiner
reported that the fund drive planning
was the result of a "secret trustee
decision." Cuthbertson emphatically
denies the secrecy of the planning.
Decision Published
The decision of the Board of
Trustees to set the goal of "at least
$260 million," made last June, was
published in Campus Report, and the
Daily discussed the proposal as early as
January 26, 1970.
Planning was first set in motion in
that month when the Board of Trustees

appointed an ad hoc committee to
discuss means of increasing Stanford's
gift income. Preliminary details of the
plan were contained in a speech by
Trustee Richard Guggenhime to
fund-raising volunteers on October 6,
1970.
From 1961-64 Stanford conducted a
$114 million university-wide
fund-raising effort known as PACE
