# Stanford Plans Huge Fund Drive; Seeks $260 Million In 5 Years
## 
### ROBERT BACON 
Planning is underway at Stanford for
a five-year university-wide fund-raising
campaign with a goal of at least $260
million.
The fund drive, two years in the
planning stages, will be formally set in
motion "within this academic year,"
according to Vice President for
Development Kenneth M. Cuthbertson.
It is to be the largest fund drive by a
private educational institution in
history, seeking to raise Stanford's gift
income from $30 million per yea- to
more than $50 million. University
financial officials have concluded that

"Stanford's financial health is
dependent upon a striking increase of
private gift support" since substantial
increases cannot be expected in tuition,
federal grants, and land development
income.
Expendable gifts fund about 18 per
cent of the university's annual
operating budget, with an equal
amount provided by income from the
university endowment. Much of the
current gift income is earmarked for
endowment or construction and only
about half can bo spent on university
operations.
Current interest in the fund drive
was set off last week when Newsweek
reported that the plans were underway.
Monday the San Francisco Examiner
reported that the fund drive planning
was the result of a "secret trustee
decision." Cuthbertson emphatically
denies the secrecy of the planning.
Decision Published
The decision of the Board of
Trustees to set the goal of "at least
$260 million," made last June, was
published in Campus Report, and the
Daily discussed the proposal as early as
January 26, 1970.
Planning was first set in motion in
that month when the Board of Trustees

appointed an ad hoc committee to
discuss means of increasing Stanford's
gift income. Preliminary details of the
plan were contained in a speech by
Trustee Richard Guggenhime to
fund-raising volunteers on October 6,
1970.
From 1961-64 Stanford conducted a
$114 million university-wide
fund-raising effort known as PACE
(Plan for A Challenging Era). That
effort was substantially aided by $25
million in matching funds awarded by
the Ford Foundation. Cuthbertson sees
no reason to expect a similar
contribution to aid the pew fund drive.
Asked about the effects of economic
conditions on giving, Cuthbertson said
that "We have reason to be relatively
optimistic for the next several years
that there may be sufficient economic
improvement to make it a good time
for fund raising. .. . The trouble is in
making short-range predictions. We
recommended to the Trustees that they
authorize planning so that we would be
prepared to move when the time is
right."
He anticipates that most very large
and one-time gifts, particularly those
from individuals, attracted by the new
campaign will be dedicated either to
endowment or to building
construction.
Building Needs
He stated that the two most urgent
building needs, for which funds will be
sought in the campaign, are a major
addition to the Main Library building
which will cost nearly $25 million and
an $11 million Law School building to
be located next to the Educational
Research Center currently under
construction.
Cuthbertson emphasized that the
new campaign will not stress one-time
gifts to the exclusion of annual giving
by alumni and friends. He also pointed

out that the campaign can be expected
to attract new donors who will make
repeated gifts.
The rationale for a major campaign,
he noted, is that "there is plenty of
evidence that gift receipts are very
closely proportionate to gift
procurement efforts"; hence a
"high-intensity effort" such as that
being planned is the way to obtain a
substantial, continued increase in
giving.
Most actual fund-raising, he noted,
will be done by volunteers, alumni and
friends not employed by the university.
The General Secretary's Office provides
them with information and staff
support.
Discruptions
Asked about the impact of campus
disruptions on fund-raising,
Cuthbertson said that "it's our
experience that when we can discuss it
with a person who's upset, we can
usually retain his support." The chief
difficulty, he noted, is that would-be
donors may write Stanford out of their
wills, a fact which the university does
not discover until after the person's
death.
He conceded that disruptive
activities "make fund-raising a good
deal more difficult," but pointed out
that "we try to get people to focus on
what Stanford is doing... We must
show people that Stanford is a great
university despite what's happening.
And if we can get their attention, we
can usually convince them."

campaign with a goal of at least $260
million.
The fund drive, two years in the
planning stages, will be formally set in
motion "within this academic year,"
according to Vice President for
Development Kenneth M. Cuthbertson.
It is to be the largest fund drive by a
private educational institution in
history, seeking to raise Stanford's gift
income from $30 million per yea- to
more than $50 million. University
financial officials have concluded that

"Stanford's financial health is
dependent upon a striking increase of
private gift support" since substantial
increases cannot be expected in tuition,
federal grants, and land development
income.
Expendable gifts fund about 18 per
cent of the university's annual
operating budget, with an equal
amount provided by income from the
university endowment. Much of the
current gift income is earmarked for
endowment or construction and only
about half can bo spent on university
operations.
Current interest in the fund drive
was set off last week when Newsweek
reported that the plans were underway.
Monday the San Francisco Examiner
reported that the fund drive planning
was the result of a "secret trustee
decision." Cuthbertson emphatically
denies the secrecy of the planning.
Decision Published
The decision of the Board of
Trustees to set the goal of "at least
$260 million," made last June, was
published in Campus Report, and the
Daily discussed the proposal as early as
January 26, 1970.
Planning was first set in motion in
that month when the Board of Trustees

appointed an ad hoc committee to
discuss means of increasing Stanford's
gift income. Preliminary details of the
plan were contained in a speech by
Trustee Richard Guggenhime to
fund-raising volunteers on October 6,
1970.
From 1961-64 Stanford conducted a
$114 million university-wide
fund-raising effort known as PACE
(Plan for A Challenging Era). That
effort was substantially aided by $25
million in matching funds awarded by
the Ford Foundation. Cuthbertson sees
no reason to expect a similar
contribution to aid the pew fund drive.
Asked about the effects of economic
conditions on giving, Cuthbertson said
that "We have reason to be relatively
optimistic for the next several years
that there may be sufficient economic
improvement to make it a good time
for fund raising. .. . The trouble is in
making short-range predictions. We
recommended to the Trustees that they
authorize planning so that we would be
prepared to move when the time is
right."
He anticipates that most very large
and one-time gifts, particularly those
from individuals, attracted by the new
campaign will be dedicated either to
endowment or to building
construction.
Building Needs
He stated that the two most urgent
building needs, for which funds will be
sought in the campaign, are a major
addition to the Main Library building
which will cost nearly $25 million and
an $11 million Law School building to
be located next to the Educational
Research Center currently under
construction.
Cuthbertson emphasized that the
new campaign will not stress one-time
gifts to the exclusion of annual giving
by alumni and friends. He also pointed

out that the campaign can be expected
to attract new donors who will make
repeated gifts.
The rationale for a major campaign,
he noted, is that "there is plenty of
evidence that gift receipts are very
closely proportionate to gift
procurement efforts"; hence a
"high-intensity effort" such as that
being planned is the way to obtain a
substantial, continued increase in
giving.
Most actual fund-raising, he noted,
will be done by volunteers, alumni and
friends not employed by the university.
The General Secretary's Office provides
them with information and staff
support.
Discruptions
Asked about the impact of campus
disruptions on fund-raising,
Cuthbertson said that "it's our
experience that when we can discuss it
with a person who's upset, we can
usually retain his support." The chief
difficulty, he noted, is that would-be
donors may write Stanford out of their
wills, a fact which the university does
not discover until after the person's
death.
He conceded that disruptive
activities "make fund-raising a good
deal more difficult," but pointed out
that "we try to get people to focus on
what Stanford is doing... We must
show people that Stanford is a great
university despite what's happening.
And if we can get their attention, we
can usually convince them."
