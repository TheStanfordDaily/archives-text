# Earth Scientists, Franklin Write To Advisory Board
## 
### 
Twenty-four professors in the
School of Earth Sciences have
submitted a letter to the Faculty
Advisory Board, arguing that Professor
H.Bruce Franklin "has been
instrumental in curtailing the freedom
of large sections of the Stanford
community."
The letter (reprinted on page 5)
argues that Franklin's actions as a
revolutionary "have resulted in major
physical and psychological harm to the
University."

The professors urged the Board, now
considering dismissal charges against
Franklin, to "look beyond the dotails
of specific actions" to the "broader
context."
Those signing the letter, including
Geophysics Chairman George A.
Thompson and Geology Chairman John
W. Harbaugh, said, "There is little point
in quibbling over precisely what Prof.
Franklin did or did not do on a specific
occasion; surely he has made it
abundantly clear in the past few weeks
that he does, in fact, advocate coercive
acts.. .
They said that Franklin's
"sycophants" made him appear
innocent in testimony during his
hearing while Franklin and supporters
actually were responsible for "the
occupations of buildings and the nights
of terrorism."
According to the letter's signers
Franklin's "systematic efforts to
embarass a vulnerable institution" are
related to their belief that "Stanford
alone continues to have serious
trouble" among American universities.

In another letter to the Advisory
Board, Franklin again lodged his
oft-repeated demand that the Board ask
President Richard Lyman to lift his
current suspension.
Franklin said the emergency
suspension, in effect until a decision is
reached in his case, is only justified
"during brief extraordinary
circumstances." Franklin has been
suspended since charges were brought
against him in March.
Franklin also argued that the
suspension is improper because he does
not threaten "immediate harm to
himself or others" by being allowed on
campus; because Lyman should have
consulted with the Advisory Board
before the suspension; and because he
needs access to campus to prepare a
course he will teach next quarter if he
is reinstated.
