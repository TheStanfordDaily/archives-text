## OPINIONS more letters from secret file University Embarrassed Having Baran On Faculty 
### 
Second of Two Parts
By far the greatest
"embarrassment" suffered by the
President's Office because of
Marxist economics professor Paul
Baran seems to have come after
the Cuban Missile Crisis.
On October 24, 1962, during
the crisis, Baran spoke on KPKA
radio with graduate student Saul
Landau and Professor Richard
Brody of political science.
"Stanford Professor Condemns
U. 5.," headlined the Palo Alto

limes. Its coverage unleashed
what Morris M. Doyle, then
chairman of the trustees, refers to
in one of the copied documents
made available recently as a
"continuing barrage of criticism
concerning Baran."
In a letter marked "Basic
Reply" Lyle Nelson, director of
University Relations, makes
reference to academic freedom:
"Just as a free society has the
obligation of respecting (a) man's
right to speak, however unpopular

his views may be, so a university
must be hospitable to differing
points of view."
But other replies emphasize the
University's inability to fire
Baran. In reply to criticism from a
group of retired officers on the
Peninsula, Doyle drafted what was
apparently a form letter. "Dr.
Baran is a continuing
embarrassment and source of
irritation to the administration at
Stanford and to the Board of
Trustees," he wrote. "Although I
do not personally see how an

avowed Marxist can be an
objective teacher of economic
history, I am told that Baran is a
fairly good teacher."
Consequently, because Baran
had tenure, "we must suffer him"
until he proved incompetent "or
does something which would
warrant termination ... on other
grounds."
Provost Frederick E. Terman
used the same line of reasoning in
another reply. "Personally, I am
largely in agreement with your
views," he wrote an angry

attorney. Nonetheless, "Your
understanding of legal procedure
and your thoughtful regard for
the University enable you to
appreciate our dilemma.
"The evidence to prove that
Professor Baran is engaged in
unscholarly activities in the
classroom is not sufficient for the
administration or faculty to take
punitive action. This is the critical
point."
When UCLA held a series of
four critiques of American foreign
policy in early 1963, Baran was
asked to speak. "U.S. Foreign
Policy Held 'International
Threat,' "headlined the Los
Angeles Times.
And angry complaint came
from Southern California alum
who quoted a speech given by J.
Edgar Hoover to an American
Legion convention to the effect
that Stanford was providing the
"Communists' success in
stimulating the interest and
participation of some of
America's young people."
"I think Betty is a
'somebody,' " presidential
assistant Fred Glover wrote
Nelson. "Will you please check
and see how we should handle."
The reply was penned at the
bottom of a list of her
contributions to Stanford. Her
brother was an ambassador in
Latin America. "Fine, substantial
family."
When another Southern
California alum wrote in February
1963 concerning "a deluge of
sincere criticism in Pasadena and
L.A., Fred Glover replied that:
"Baran has tenure. To fire him,
we would have to have a reason
which would stand up in court.
And we don't have any such
reason. ... I think we have just
got to take the position that
Baran is small potatoes in a great
university."
The President's Office
apparently wasn't the only one
writing letters to distraught alums.
Among the copied documents is a
letter from a petroleum engineer
calming an unhappy friend. Under
his contract there was "no legal
reason or right to terminate this
professor. If Professor Baran
violates his contract, you may be
sure he will be run off in record
time."
"Fine letter," Glover wrote
Sterling in a memo. "One of the
best letters on a sensitive situation
that I've seen," Sterling wrote
him.
The embarrassment Baran was
causing Stanford had apparently
become somewhat financial.
"Why should I work for the
success of the PACE program,"

queried one alum, "if there are
men on the faculty that are
working to destroy the religious,
economic, and political beliefs I
hold so dear?"
A Superior Court judge wrote
Sterling that PACE workers in
Southern California were
"running into questions" about
Baran and "what was Stanford
doing in regard to him and his
like." Some thought it would be
helpful, he said, "If they could
tell their prospects ... that
Stanford is doing all that it can do
to discourage him from remaining
with the University."
The judge had earlier written
Sterling concerning a friend's
unwillingness to "chat" about
"the unfortunate 'Baran affair'."
He quoted the man's reply to his
query: "I fear that any further
donations could well be used to
promote subversive teaching while
such men are on the faculty."
"I hope this does not mean
that he has or is likely to change
his Will." The judge wrote,
"which as you know provides that
something in the neighborhood of
a million dollars will go to
Stanford upon his death."
The President's Office
apparently called up information
concerning Baran's academic
position — his salary, courses, the
number of students who attended.
Lists among the copied
documents show Baran's Ec 120
("Comparative Economic
Systems") to have been
increasingly popular, attracting
eighty-one students by autumn of
1962. Baran's salary was another
matter. Receiving slightly under
the department average in 1956/7,
by 1963/4 he was being paid only
$14,300 — the least of any
professor in economics. (High
salary was $22,500.)
Sterling wrote the judge that
he didn't think it wise to provide
PACE workers with confidential
personnel information. "Should

nick baran and david rr

there be a feedback to t.ie
faculty," he said, "I feel sure that
'ould be criticized."
Nonetheless, he said that the
records showed that "Baran is not
reaching many students."
When the Chronicle reported
on May 26, 1963, that Baran had
been a party to forming the "San
Francisco Opposition," a group it
described as "a new movement on
the left," Sterling reacted with
pique. "I wish that Professor
Baran and Mr. Landua ... would
stick to their academic knitting,"
he wrote an alum.
Baran died of a second heart
attack on March 27, 1963. Even
after his death, alumni
complained bitterly of his
association with Stanford. A
memorial held by faculty friends a
few days after his death was
reported in the San Fancisco
News Call Bulletin. "Since he has
passed away the school has been
relieved of an apparently difficult
situation," an alum wrote from
Bakersfield. "He should have been
buried peacefully without the
accompanying fan fare."
"You may be right," Glover
wrote back, "But it is difficult as
a practical matter to tell a dead
man's friends that they cannot
mourn him as they see fit."
(Nick Baran is a sophomore in
German. David Ransom is a
freelance journalist and a member
of Venceremos.)
