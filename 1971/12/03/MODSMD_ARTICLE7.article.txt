Moral Judgements
Professor Alan T. Waterman, Jr.
Department of Electrical
Engineering c/o Editor, THE
DAILY:
In a KZSU radio interview last
Monday evening, November 29,
you were asked at what point you
use moral judgements to draw a
line in choosing research work.
You replied that you draw
lines depending on ".. . the
extent to which it is truly
university research, where
appliations are not spelled out
ahead of time.... If the work
departs from that and becomes
directed toward a purpose, toward
some end goal, so that it's really
development work or highly
applied research as distinct from
more general basic research, then
one can make a moral judgement
in terms of the morality of the
applications. ..
In researching the second
volume of the SWOPSI report on
DoD sponsored research, we
found that fifteen contracts from
the DoD at Stanford are classified
as development (some
exploratory, some advanced, and
some engineering development),
and are sponsored by that systems
command or military laboratory
responsible for development work
on those various systems or
end-items. I invite your
assessment of the morality of
these contracted efforts:

Techniques for Aerospace
Users," Air Force Rome Air

D. Debra, "Advanced Research in
Guidance, Control, and
Instrumentation," Air Force

date next quarter.

The "Big Lie"
Editor, THE DAILY:
As I have long suspected, the
"research" conducted by
members of the Pacific Studies
Center and the Young Crows is
generated from the minds and
fantasies of those doing or
directing the "research." They
will take one statement of fact
and then fantasize conclusions
from it to meet their preconceived
opinions. Their minds are made
up prior to any investigation of
the entire case.
Evidence of this is shown by
Lenny Siegel's statement that I
am Assistant Dean of Engineering
and have hopes for promotion to
Dean. Mr. Siegel is exhibiting the
same disregard for truth and is
using Goebbels' "Big Lie"
technique evident in the PSC and

Young Crow statements which
protest everything from DoD
research to Bechtel Center
Easter-Egg Hunts.
Yes, I am Assistant Dean of
Engineering, but I have no hopes
for promotion to Dean, although
Lenny stated that I did. The
Search Committee will
recommend a person who is the
most qualified for Dean of
Engineering and that person will
most assuredly not be this
member of the Association of
Middle-aged Lean Seagulls.

P.S. Since Lenny apparently
doesn't want the job in Cairo, I
would then recommend him as
the University dog-catcher. This is
a job that needs to be filled also.
Blackening Baran's Name
Editor, THE DAILY:
I think it is a shame to blacken
the name of the late Professor
Paul Baran by implying that he
would have sanctioned rowdy
tactics to prevent a lecturer from
delivering a talk or an audience
from hearing it or encouraged a
little group of disrupters to shout
"oink, oink" at a chairman
introducing a lecturer.
I knew Paul Baran and knew
him well for we two were in
1949-50, so far as I know, the
only subscribers to receive Pravda
from Moscow by air mail and
sometimes the postman gave my
copy to him and at other times his
copy to me whereupon we would
do our own delivering.
We both were thorough
students of Marx's work. He was
an ardent believer in Marxian
theory and Marxist economics and
he taught its principles seriously
in his classroom and on the
lecture platform.
He attended a lecture of mine
critical of Marxism and did his
best to refute what I had said, but

he would no more have thought
of disrupting a meeting or
heckling a speaker than he would
have thought of tossing a
firebomb into one of our libraries
or smashing one of our windows.
For obvious reasons, I consider
it unjust to his memory to
compare him to Bruce Franklin.

More On Baran
Editor, THE DAILY:
I agree with the Daily in
thinking that the former
Administration did not support
Professor Baran as actively as it
should have done. My views on
this subject were published at
some length in Stanford Today
for March-April, 1963, where I
argued that academic freedom
should rest, not on reluctant and
resistant tolerance for
disagreement, but on the belief
that disagreement is valuable and
should be welcomed.
The fact remains, however,
that despite heavy external
pressure and despite its own
antipathy for Professor Baran's
Marxist views, the former
Administration did not move for
his dismissal.
If the Baran case is parallel to
the Franklin case, the result is to
demolish the main argument
advanced in support of Professor
Franklin — namely the claim that
he is being prosecuted simply for
his opinions. The Baran case
shows that the University does
not seek the dismissal of faculty
merely because his opinions are
disapproved.

Blackening Baran's Name
Editor, THE DAILY:
I think it is a shame to blacken
the name of the late Professor
Paul Baran by implying that he
would have sanctioned rowdy
tactics to prevent a lecturer from
delivering a talk or an audience
from hearing it or encouraged a
little group of disrupters to shout
"oink, oink" at a chairman
introducing a lecturer.
I knew Paul Baran and knew
him well for we two were in
1949-50, so far as I know, the
only subscribers to receive Pravda
from Moscow by air mail and
sometimes the postman gave my
copy to him and at other times his
copy to me whereupon we would
do our own delivering.
We both were thorough
students of Marx's work. He was
an ardent believer in Marxian
theory and Marxist economics and
he taught its principles seriously
in his classroom and on the
lecture platform.
He attended a lecture of mine
critical of Marxism and did his
best to refute what I had said, but

he would no more have thought
of disrupting a meeting or
heckling a speaker than he would
have thought of tossing a
firebomb into one of our libraries
or smashing one of our windows.
For obvious reasons, I consider
it unjust to his memory to
compare him to Bruce Franklin.

More On Baran
Editor, THE DAILY:
I agree with the Daily in
thinking that the former
Administration did not support
Professor Baran as actively as it
should have done. My views on
this subject were published at
some length in Stanford Today
for March-April, 1963, where I
argued that academic freedom
should rest, not on reluctant and
resistant tolerance for
disagreement, but on the belief
that disagreement is valuable and
should be welcomed.
The fact remains, however,
that despite heavy external
pressure and despite its own
antipathy for Professor Baran's
Marxist views, the former
Administration did not move for
his dismissal.
If the Baran case is parallel to
the Franklin case, the result is to
demolish the main argument
advanced in support of Professor
Franklin — namely the claim that
he is being prosecuted simply for
his opinions. The Baran case
shows that the University does
not seek the dismissal of faculty
merely because his opinions are
disapproved.

Moral Judgements
Professor Alan T. Waterman, Jr.
Department of Electrical
Engineering c/o Editor, THE
DAILY:
In a KZSU radio interview last
Monday evening, November 29,
you were asked at what point you
use moral judgements to draw a
line in choosing research work.
You replied that you draw
lines depending on ".. . the
extent to which it is truly
university research, where
appliations are not spelled out
ahead of time.... If the work
departs from that and becomes
directed toward a purpose, toward
some end goal, so that it's really
development work or highly
applied research as distinct from
more general basic research, then
one can make a moral judgement
in terms of the morality of the
applications. ..
In researching the second
volume of the SWOPSI report on
DoD sponsored research, we
found that fifteen contracts from
the DoD at Stanford are classified
as development (some
exploratory, some advanced, and
some engineering development),
and are sponsored by that systems
command or military laboratory
responsible for development work
on those various systems or
end-items. I invite your
assessment of the morality of
these contracted efforts:

The "Big Lie"
Editor, THE DAILY:
As I have long suspected, the
"research" conducted by
members of the Pacific Studies
Center and the Young Crows is
generated from the minds and
fantasies of those doing or
directing the "research." They
will take one statement of fact
and then fantasize conclusions
from it to meet their preconceived
opinions. Their minds are made
up prior to any investigation of
the entire case.
Evidence of this is shown by
Lenny Siegel's statement that I
am Assistant Dean of Engineering
and have hopes for promotion to
Dean. Mr. Siegel is exhibiting the
same disregard for truth and is
using Goebbels' "Big Lie"
technique evident in the PSC and

Young Crow statements which
protest everything from DoD
research to Bechtel Center
Easter-Egg Hunts.
Yes, I am Assistant Dean of
Engineering, but I have no hopes
for promotion to Dean, although
Lenny stated that I did. The
Search Committee will
recommend a person who is the
most qualified for Dean of
Engineering and that person will
most assuredly not be this
member of the Association of
Middle-aged Lean Seagulls.

The "Big Lie"
Editor, THE DAILY:
As I have long suspected, the
"research" conducted by
members of the Pacific Studies
Center and the Young Crows is
generated from the minds and
fantasies of those doing or
directing the "research." They
will take one statement of fact
and then fantasize conclusions
from it to meet their preconceived
opinions. Their minds are made
up prior to any investigation of
the entire case.
Evidence of this is shown by
Lenny Siegel's statement that I
am Assistant Dean of Engineering
and have hopes for promotion to
Dean. Mr. Siegel is exhibiting the
same disregard for truth and is
using Goebbels' "Big Lie"
technique evident in the PSC and

Young Crow statements which
protest everything from DoD
research to Bechtel Center
Easter-Egg Hunts.
Yes, I am Assistant Dean of
Engineering, but I have no hopes
for promotion to Dean, although
Lenny stated that I did. The
Search Committee will
recommend a person who is the
most qualified for Dean of
Engineering and that person will
most assuredly not be this
member of the Association of
Middle-aged Lean Seagulls.

P.S. Since Lenny apparently
doesn't want the job in Cairo, I
would then recommend him as
the University dog-catcher. This is
a job that needs to be filled also.
Blackening Baran's Name
Editor, THE DAILY:
I think it is a shame to blacken
the name of the late Professor
Paul Baran by implying that he
would have sanctioned rowdy
tactics to prevent a lecturer from
delivering a talk or an audience
from hearing it or encouraged a
little group of disrupters to shout
"oink, oink" at a chairman
introducing a lecturer.
I knew Paul Baran and knew
him well for we two were in
1949-50, so far as I know, the
only subscribers to receive Pravda
from Moscow by air mail and
sometimes the postman gave my
copy to him and at other times his
copy to me whereupon we would
do our own delivering.
We both were thorough
students of Marx's work. He was
an ardent believer in Marxian
theory and Marxist economics and
he taught its principles seriously
in his classroom and on the
lecture platform.
He attended a lecture of mine
critical of Marxism and did his
best to refute what I had said, but

he would no more have thought
of disrupting a meeting or
heckling a speaker than he would
have thought of tossing a
firebomb into one of our libraries
or smashing one of our windows.
For obvious reasons, I consider
it unjust to his memory to
compare him to Bruce Franklin.

More On Baran
Editor, THE DAILY:
I agree with the Daily in
thinking that the former
Administration did not support
Professor Baran as actively as it
should have done. My views on
this subject were published at
some length in Stanford Today
for March-April, 1963, where I
argued that academic freedom
should rest, not on reluctant and
resistant tolerance for
disagreement, but on the belief
that disagreement is valuable and
should be welcomed.
The fact remains, however,
that despite heavy external
pressure and despite its own
antipathy for Professor Baran's
Marxist views, the former
Administration did not move for
his dismissal.
If the Baran case is parallel to
the Franklin case, the result is to
demolish the main argument
advanced in support of Professor
Franklin — namely the claim that
he is being prosecuted simply for
his opinions. The Baran case
shows that the University does
not seek the dismissal of faculty
merely because his opinions are
disapproved.

Moral Judgements
Professor Alan T. Waterman, Jr.
Department of Electrical

DAILY:
In a KZSU radio interview last
Monday evening, November 29,
you were asked at what point you
use moral judgements to draw a
line in choosing research work.
You replied that you draw
lines depending on ".. . the
extent to which it is truly
university research, where
appliations are not spelled out
ahead of time.... If the work
departs from that and becomes
directed toward a purpose, toward
some end goal, so that it's really
development work or highly
applied research as distinct from
more general basic research, then
one can make a moral judgement
in terms of the morality of the
applications. ..
In researching the second
volume of the SWOPSI report on
DoD sponsored research, we
found that fifteen contracts from
the DoD at Stanford are classified
as development (some
exploratory, some advanced, and
some engineering development),
and are sponsored by that systems
command or military laboratory
responsible for development work
on those various systems or
end-items. I invite your
assessment of the morality of
these contracted efforts:

argued that academic freedom
should rest, not on reluctant and
resistant tolerance for
disagreement, but on the belief
that disagreement is valuable and
should be welcomed.
The fact remains, however,
that despite heavy external
pressure and despite its own
antipathy for Professor Baran's
Marxist views, the former
Administration did not move for
his dismissal.
If the Baran case is parallel to
the Franklin case, the result is to
demolish the main argument
advanced in support of Professor
Franklin — namely the claim that
he is being prosecuted simply for
his opinions. The Baran case
shows that the University does
not seek the dismissal of faculty
merely because his opinions are
disapproved.
