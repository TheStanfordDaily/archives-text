## A 						Question Of Priorities 
### 
I was profoundly disturbed by John Coffey's
"State of Higher Educations Chaos" — a
conservative view, that appeared in the Daily Nov.
29.
As someone who graduated from Berkeley with a
B.A. in psychology, and went on to become for
brief periods a stunt man in Hollywood, free lance
writer, life-insurance salesman, trapeze artist and
finally coach at Stanford, my perspective of what
the term "education" means may be different from
many in the Stanford Community — in particular
from John Coffey.
John Coffey and I have one thing in common.
We are disappointed in the educational system; He
because it's too amorphous and I because it's too
restrictive.
It may be that Stanford and schools like her are
all excellent academic institutions, but labelling
them educational institutions is less valid.
Life for homo sapiens has been defined as
"perception, appreciation, and pursuit." If we can
accept this rough philosophical definition, can we
not also accept that education should be no less
than that process whereby we learn to live the good
life?
Unless an educational system teaches us to
perceive more fully and realistically, appreciate
intensely, and pursue life effectively, it's value must
be questioned (especially at about $3600 a year).
Perhaps John Coffey would have us return to the
"good old days," when getting an education meant
sitting down and letting professors fill our heads
with the contents of their heads, perhaps even
teaching us a little about memorization, abstract
thinking, and empirical, critical analysis.
But where do we leam to educate our senses?
What avenues are open to us to leam to introspect
constructively, to educate and harness our
emotional forces? We certainly don't learn these
things in our regular curricula — in fact, such
"courses" aren't likely to be approved by the Dean
of Undergraduate Studies office because they may
not meet certain "academic" standards such as
enough reading and writing and officially scheduled
class hours.
More basic questions arise — Does intelligence
mean emotional stability? Do degrees mean we can
now go out and cope effectively with life (or merely
with our chosen job?).
Intelligence, the ability to verbalize in an
organized manner, and to think abstractly (a
questionable achievement), aren't royal roads to a
happy or even satisfying life. Can we learn peace of
mind, serenity, or any other arts of living in the
classroom?
Many of us eventually come to grips with the

search for meaning in life. Often we come to the
realization that life itself is composed of many
games, and the meaning in each isn't an absolute,
but depends upon how much meaning we invest in
the games.
The student game potentially has much value.
Our university years give us a time of stimulating
hibernation, a preparation if you will, for broader,
more general games of life with less definite rules
and boundaries.
But to play this game to the fullest, we need the
environment — we need educational situations that
prepare us to make a life, not simply earn a living.
I must ask — instead of immediately jumping
into academic pursuits, would it not be beneficial if
freshman were given their first quarter to take
special series of courses exposing them to situations
which encouraged introspection, re-evaluation of
attitudes, (separating attitudes of parents from
attitudes of self), opportunities for every freshman
to routinely see a counselor (perhaps in a group
situation) and get himself or herself "together"?
I'm tired of hearing about "higher" education
and "lower" education. I'd like to ask you to tell
me how the study of history is somehow more
valuable than learning pottery. What does
metaphysics have over gymnastics? (I can give some
pretty good arguments to the contrary).
I feel in an academic institution, we lose
perspective of what is going to be meaningful to us
when we graduate. Our whole sphere of awareness
is populated by many professors and students (and
parents) who see academics-to good job-to success
as the "good things" in life. But how many of our
parents, professors, and brilliant fellow students are
relaxed, happy people? How many of us are high
achievers because we like it, and how many because
our happiness depends upon it?
I ask, is it not possible to learn as much watching
a brook in a meditative manner as we would learn
reading a book that analyses the structure of brooks?
Certainly, we can do both . .. but which can help
us more to perceive, appreciate, and pursue a happy
life? Henry David Thoreau might give one answer —
some of our professors might answer differently.
I don't mean to stereotype professors, for it
would be as inaccurate as stereotyping athletes or
any other pseudo-group. But I am questioning our
priorities.
Surely we can gain much from our academic
experience, but if we don't look further, and create
an environment where external education gives way
to internal education, we're becoming brilliant
academicians but life-cripples.
