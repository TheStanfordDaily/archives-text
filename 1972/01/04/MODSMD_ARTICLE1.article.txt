# Stanford Stops Wolverines, 13-12
## Clutch Defense, Passing Highlight Indians' Win Over Grounded Michigan 
### CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
It was the perfect justification for
thir ring man's football. The talented
and free thinking Stanford Indians
encountered the plodding football
machine of the University of Michigan
in the game no one thought they would
win, and outhit and outthought the
thundering Wolverines in one of the
most incredible fourth quarters of Rose
Bowl football ever played to earn a
13-12 victory.
The nation's attention was primarily
fixed on the New Year's Day action in
Miami and New Orleans, and the
thought of a fifteenth ranked team
with three losses playing in the oldest
and most prestigious bowl game was
repugnant to some. It was to have been
the rare Rose Bowl game that would
not have any effect on the top national
rankings. Interest in the game seemed
so low that scalpers outside the Rose
Bowl were having trouble getting three
dollars for a ticket.
After the contest, however, many
people wished that they had been there
to see the game that made the Nebraska
slaughter seem like a ridiculous
anticlimax.
Local Interest
There was significant local interest
in the 58th Rose Bowl game, however,
with most of it centered on the
juxtaposition of the life styles of the
two combatants. Michigan's Bo
Schembechler is a strict taskmaster in
the mold of Woody Hayes and holds
the same conservative philosophy about
football as his old teacher. The
Wolverine training camp was very
controlled and the players were kept
from all distractions, including contact
with their families in the last week.

It was not surprising then that the
Michigan team that faced the Indians
last Saturday reflected its upbringing
and played slow, bruising, and highly
predictable football.
In direct contrast, the Stanford
campu had no curfew until the last two
nights, and the players were free to do
whatever they pleased. Mike Simone
described the Indian approach to
football last week, saying that the
" . . . coaches figure we're mature
enough to decide what will hurt our
performances and that we won't do it.
This is an intelligent team. The guys
know what they have to do to get
ready."
While Michigan spent New Year's
Eve in a monastary, the Indians were
watching Sam Peckinpaugh's powerful
new movie, "Straw Dogs," and
wandering around their Long Beach
motel. On Saturday afternoon, the
gambling, intelligent, and confident
play typified the Cards' philosophy of
football.
Stanford set the tone for the
afternoon when Miles Moore took the
kickoff and faked a reverse to John
Winesberry. Bunce concentrated in the
first half on confusing the Michigan
defense by running out of many
different patterns and using Winesberry
The Michigan offense offered no
surprises and the fired up Thunder
Chickens did not allow a first down
until the third series when receiver Bo
Rather made 14 yards on an end
around. The Wolverines had not dented
the Card defense until they used an
innovative play, but they did not learn
from this and resumed their dull
grinding attack that netted them only
one Dana Coin field goal and 133 yards

in the first half on 43 plays.
Stanford had made only 120 yards
on 27 plays but went into the
locker-room too excited to work
seriously on a second half game plan.
They had shown Michigan that they
could contain them and the players felt
that the offense only had to get
untracked to give them a second
consecutive Rose Bowl victory.
The Card attack did indeed catch on
fire in the second half as Bunce
completed 17 of 27 passes for 196
yards and they stormed from behind in
that crazy fourth quarter to eke out a
one point victory with only 12 seconds
left on Rod Garcia's 31 yard field goal,
on inside reverses. The powerful
Wolverine defense broke down the
offensive blocking and knocked down
several Bunce aerials, frustrating the
Indians attack.

HOT ROD—Stanford's soccer-style placekicker Rod Garcia provided the winning margin with his 31 yard field goal in the
final 12 seconds of the Indians 13-12 Rose Bowl victory over Michigan. Garcia also split the uprights from 42 yards out
in the third quarter to tie the game at 3-3. The Chilean kicking specialist had missed attempts from 52 and 55 yards in
the first quarter.
