# Stanford Stops Wolverines, 13-12
## Clutch Defense, Passing Highlight Indians' Win Over Grounded Michigan 
### CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
It was the perfect justification for
thir ring man's football. The talented
and free thinking Stanford Indians
encountered the plodding football
machine of the University of Michigan
in the game no one thought they would
win, and outhit and outthought the
thundering Wolverines in one of the
most incredible fourth quarters of Rose
Bowl football ever played to earn a
13-12 victory.
The nation's attention was primarily
fixed on the New Year's Day action in
Miami and New Orleans, and the
thought of a fifteenth ranked team
with three losses playing in the oldest
and most prestigious bowl game was
repugnant to some. It was to have been
the rare Rose Bowl game that would
not have any effect on the top national
rankings. Interest in the game seemed
so low that scalpers outside the Rose
Bowl were having trouble getting three
dollars for a ticket.
After the contest, however, many
people wished that they had been there
to see the game that made the Nebraska
slaughter seem like a ridiculous
anticlimax.
Local Interest
There was significant local interest
in the 58th Rose Bowl game, however,
with most of it centered on the
juxtaposition of the life styles of the
two combatants. Michigan's Bo
Schembechler is a strict taskmaster in
the mold of Woody Hayes and holds
the same conservative philosophy about
football as his old teacher. The
Wolverine training camp was very
controlled and the players were kept
from all distractions, including contact
with their families in the last week.

It was not surprising then that the
Michigan team that faced the Indians
last Saturday reflected its upbringing
and played slow, bruising, and highly
predictable football.
In direct contrast, the Stanford
campu had no curfew until the last two
nights, and the players were free to do
whatever they pleased. Mike Simone
described the Indian approach to
football last week, saying that the
" . . . coaches figure we're mature
enough to decide what will hurt our
performances and that we won't do it.
This is an intelligent team. The guys
know what they have to do to get
ready."
While Michigan spent New Year's
Eve in a monastary, the Indians were
watching Sam Peckinpaugh's powerful
new movie, "Straw Dogs," and
wandering around their Long Beach
motel. On Saturday afternoon, the
gambling, intelligent, and confident
play typified the Cards' philosophy of
football.
Stanford set the tone for the
afternoon when Miles Moore took the
kickoff and faked a reverse to John
Winesberry. Bunce concentrated in the
first half on confusing the Michigan
defense by running out of many
different patterns and using Winesberry
The Michigan offense offered no
surprises and the fired up Thunder
Chickens did not allow a first down
until the third series when receiver Bo
Rather made 14 yards on an end
around. The Wolverines had not dented
the Card defense until they used an
innovative play, but they did not learn
from this and resumed their dull
grinding attack that netted them only
one Dana Coin field goal and 133 yards

in the first half on 43 plays.
Stanford had made only 120 yards
on 27 plays but went into the
locker-room too excited to work
seriously on a second half game plan.
They had shown Michigan that they
could contain them and the players felt
that the offense only had to get
untracked to give them a second
consecutive Rose Bowl victory.
The Card attack did indeed catch on
fire in the second half as Bunce
completed 17 of 27 passes for 196
yards and they stormed from behind in
that crazy fourth quarter to eke out a
one point victory with only 12 seconds
left on Rod Garcia's 31 yard field goal,
on inside reverses. The powerful
Wolverine defense broke down the
offensive blocking and knocked down
several Bunce aerials, frustrating the
Indians attack.

HOT ROD—Stanford's soccer-style placekicker Rod Garcia provided the winning margin with his 31 yard field goal in the
final 12 seconds of the Indians 13-12 Rose Bowl victory over Michigan. Garcia also split the uprights from 42 yards out
in the third quarter to tie the game at 3-3. The Chilean kicking specialist had missed attempts from 52 and 55 yards in
the first quarter.
Bunce set up that winning field
goal in that now famous last
minute drive as he completed five
of six passes. He called all the
plays of that drive at the line of
scrimmage in the form of
audibles, and he called most of
the plays throughout the
afternoon while working within
the general confines of offensive
coordinator Mike White's brilliant
game plan. Tom Slade, the
sophomore quarterback for the
Wolverines, had every play sent in
to him from Schembechler by
shuttling receivers. Only a very
few times did Slade change the
coach's play with audibles. Slade
said after the game that "I never
call the plays, and 1 didn't plan
to."
Unpredictable Football
While the Indians were playing
a loose and unpredictable brand
of football, Michigan was mired in
the confines of a strict game plan
that called for shoving the ball
down the Cards' throat with
power runs and sweeps. The
Wolverines respected Stanford's
linemen and linebackers and sent
most of their blockers at these
targets on the sweeps, leaving the
Indians secondary to cope with
the running of Billy Taylor. The
Cards came through magnificently
as Randy Poltl with 14 tackles,
Benny Barnes and Tim Robnett
with eight apiece, and Charlie
McCloud with five, came up to
brush aside the interference and
dump Taylor. The fine play of the
Stanford secondary was
responsible for holding the Big
Ten's most valuable player to 82
yards on 32 carries. Schembechler
admitted that the Indians did a
". . . good job defensively. They
got off our blocks well. We just
didn't block well. I can't believe
that we didn't."
A mistake by the Stanford
defense in many crucial points of
the game would have given the
Wolverines what might have been
an insurmountable advantage.
Throughout the game, Indian
defenders made numerous
individual tackles on Taylor,
Slade, and Doughty. It had been
said that no one man could bring
down these Michigan runners, but
the Thunder Chickens dispelled
this myth.
Sluggish Back field
They were aided in their
defensive efforts by the fact that
the Wolverine backfield was
extremely slow in setting up their
running plays, allowing the
Indians to set up the proper
pursuit. Greg Sampson was able to
come all the way over from his
end to catch the fleet Doughty
from behind and make that
spectacular tackle in the first
quarter.
The Cards held Michigan on
four running plays from the five
yard line in the third quarter and
this impressive display of
defensive muscle disheartened the
Wolverines. Schembechler moaned
after the game that, "When we got
down to the goal line and couldn't
score, that was unheard of for
us."
Having proven that they could
outmuscle the strong Big Ten
champions who won many of
their conference games this season
on sheer strength, the Indians
relied on their guile and
confidence to ruin the Wolverines.
Midway through the fourth
quarter, trailing 10-3 on their own
33 yard line, Ralston called a
risky fake punt that would have
spelled doom for his men if it
failed. Jackie Brown sped 31
yards on the hand-off from Jim
Kehl and five passing plays later,
Brown shot through the startled
Michigan line for 24 yards and the
tying touchdown. Once again
Schembechler had cause for
moaning after the game. "They
caught us playing pass."
No First Downs
The Indian defense also did not
allow the Wolverines a first down
in the fourth quarter when the
offense had to have the ball as
Michigan was stymied on its last
four series. After James
Ferguson's controversial safety,
the defense held Michigan to five
yards on three plays and Pete
Lazetich later explained that
Stanford might not have won if it
had not been for that safety. "We
were getting tired, but we figured
that they could not win it that
way. The officials could not cheat
us out of the game, not the Rose
Bowl."
Both the offense and defense
got inspired after the safety
whereas fatigue and a lack of
inspiration might have allowed the
game to end in a 10-10 tie. The

defense was able to come through
at the end of the game, however,
because they had been rested
earlier. Eleven different linemen
played for the Cards and although
Michigan moved the ball against
them, the rest that they provided
the Thunder Chickens proved to
be instrumental in Stanford's
victory.
Michigan did march the ball up
and down the field for 290 yards,
but they only netted 10 points for
these efforts and stubbornly
refused to change strategy even
though they were not succeeding.
Even a Michigan writer
commented before the game that,
"Even if they can't run the ball
against Stanford, it will be well
into the third quarter before Bo
admits it and tries something
else."
Desperation Passes
Aside from a few desperation
passes (one of which wound up in
the first row of the Stanford
bleachers), the Wolverines did not
change their game plan either
offensively or defensively the
whole game even though it was
obvious at halftime that they
should have. During halftime,
several sportscasters commented
that Michigan must alter its
defense to avoid giving Bunce and
his receivers the middle of the
field in which to throw.
Ralston explained that, "The
Michigan linebackers were flaring
out too much, trying to cover too
much ground. This took away the
outside pass. We wanted to keep
them tight, so we ran more fakes
into the line the second half."
Stubbornly refusing to move
inside, the defenders from Ann
Arbor gave Bunce the middle and
he took this route exclusively in
engineering Stanford's last
desperation drive. Winesberry
explained that he was ". . . open
on curls inside since their monster
men were moving outside to take
that away."
Bunce completed passes up the
middle to Winesberry for 12 and
16 yards, Sanderson for 14, Scott
for 13, and Moore for 11 on tint
last drive. His quick thinking and
the confident and precise way in
which the Indians handled the
pressure situation accounted for
the drive's success. Bunce claimed
that "As soon as I got into the
huddle I could see it in
everybody's eyes, they all wanted
to take part in that last drive.
They all wanted to carry the ball,
catch it, or knock somebody
down. I knew then that we were
going to win it."
Fine Execution
The amazing speed with which
the Indians executed that drive
shook the Wolverines. Tom
Darden, Ail-American safety for
Michigan, said that they went out
of a zone defense on that last
drive. "We went into a
man-to-man and they forced us to
hurry. We had to call our defenses
from the field, and that did not
make things easy, either." It is
significant that when the Michigan
players had only themselves to
rely on, they did not have the
experience or the ability to cope
with the situation. In this crucial
last minute action, Michigan's
overly controlled style of play
worked against them. The Indians
had done what they had to do
according to Mike Simone,
". . . force them out of their game
plan."
Frustration!
The Michigan players felt the
frustration at having to cope with
an unknown quantity. Defensive
end Mike Keller explained this
after the game. "This is the first
time we lost to a passing team.
Ohio State ran on us last year, we
knew what was coming at us then.
But this was more frustrating. The
ball was in the air all the time.
You're hitting their guys just as
hard as you've hit anybody all
year, but it doesn't make any
difference because the ball's in the
air."
Keller unwittingly summed up
Michigan's failure in the 1972
Rose Bowl. Michigan had not
been severely tested this season,
especially by passers, and as a
result did not know its
limitations. The Indians knew
exactly what they could and
could not do and they took
advantage of the Wolverines'
overconfidence. Michigan
displayed great power, but could
not match or cope with the,
instinctively intelligent play of a
perfectly coached and versatile
squad of champions.

shuttling receivers. Only a very
few times did Slade change the
coach's play with audibles. Slade
said after the game that "I never
call the plays, and 1 didn't plan
to."
Unpredictable Football
While the Indians were playing
a loose and unpredictable brand
of football, Michigan was mired in
the confines of a strict game plan
that called for shoving the ball
down the Cards' throat with
power runs and sweeps. The
Wolverines respected Stanford's
linemen and linebackers and sent
most of their blockers at these
targets on the sweeps, leaving the
Indians secondary to cope with
the running of Billy Taylor. The
Cards came through magnificently
as Randy Poltl with 14 tackles,
Benny Barnes and Tim Robnett
with eight apiece, and Charlie
McCloud with five, came up to
brush aside the interference and
dump Taylor. The fine play of the
Stanford secondary was
responsible for holding the Big
Ten's most valuable player to 82
yards on 32 carries. Schembechler
admitted that the Indians did a
". . . good job defensively. They
got off our blocks well. We just
didn't block well. I can't believe
that we didn't."
A mistake by the Stanford
defense in many crucial points of
the game would have given the
Wolverines what might have been
an insurmountable advantage.
Throughout the game, Indian
defenders made numerous
individual tackles on Taylor,
Slade, and Doughty. It had been
said that no one man could bring
down these Michigan runners, but
the Thunder Chickens dispelled
this myth.
Sluggish Back field
They were aided in their
defensive efforts by the fact that
the Wolverine backfield was
extremely slow in setting up their
running plays, allowing the
Indians to set up the proper
pursuit. Greg Sampson was able to
come all the way over from his
end to catch the fleet Doughty
from behind and make that
spectacular tackle in the first
quarter.
The Cards held Michigan on
four running plays from the five
yard line in the third quarter and
this impressive display of
defensive muscle disheartened the
Wolverines. Schembechler moaned
after the game that, "When we got
down to the goal line and couldn't
score, that was unheard of for
us."
Having proven that they could
outmuscle the strong Big Ten
champions who won many of
their conference games this season
on sheer strength, the Indians
relied on their guile and
confidence to ruin the Wolverines.
Midway through the fourth
quarter, trailing 10-3 on their own
33 yard line, Ralston called a
risky fake punt that would have
spelled doom for his men if it
failed. Jackie Brown sped 31
yards on the hand-off from Jim
Kehl and five passing plays later,
Brown shot through the startled
Michigan line for 24 yards and the
tying touchdown. Once again
Schembechler had cause for
moaning after the game. "They
caught us playing pass."
No First Downs
The Indian defense also did not
allow the Wolverines a first down
in the fourth quarter when the
offense had to have the ball as
Michigan was stymied on its last
four series. After James
Ferguson's controversial safety,
the defense held Michigan to five
yards on three plays and Pete
Lazetich later explained that
Stanford might not have won if it
had not been for that safety. "We
were getting tired, but we figured
that they could not win it that
way. The officials could not cheat
us out of the game, not the Rose
Bowl."
Both the offense and defense
got inspired after the safety
whereas fatigue and a lack of
inspiration might have allowed the
game to end in a 10-10 tie. The

defense was able to come through
at the end of the game, however,
because they had been rested
earlier. Eleven different linemen
played for the Cards and although
Michigan moved the ball against
them, the rest that they provided
the Thunder Chickens proved to
be instrumental in Stanford's
victory.
Michigan did march the ball up
and down the field for 290 yards,
but they only netted 10 points for
these efforts and stubbornly
refused to change strategy even
though they were not succeeding.
Even a Michigan writer
commented before the game that,
"Even if they can't run the ball
against Stanford, it will be well
into the third quarter before Bo
admits it and tries something
else."
Desperation Passes
Aside from a few desperation
passes (one of which wound up in
the first row of the Stanford
bleachers), the Wolverines did not
change their game plan either
offensively or defensively the
whole game even though it was
obvious at halftime that they
should have. During halftime,
several sportscasters commented
that Michigan must alter its
defense to avoid giving Bunce and
his receivers the middle of the
field in which to throw.
Ralston explained that, "The
Michigan linebackers were flaring
out too much, trying to cover too
much ground. This took away the
outside pass. We wanted to keep
them tight, so we ran more fakes
into the line the second half."
Stubbornly refusing to move
inside, the defenders from Ann
Arbor gave Bunce the middle and
he took this route exclusively in
engineering Stanford's last
desperation drive. Winesberry
explained that he was ". . . open
on curls inside since their monster
men were moving outside to take
that away."
Bunce completed passes up the
middle to Winesberry for 12 and
16 yards, Sanderson for 14, Scott
for 13, and Moore for 11 on tint
last drive. His quick thinking and
the confident and precise way in
which the Indians handled the
pressure situation accounted for
the drive's success. Bunce claimed
that "As soon as I got into the
huddle I could see it in
everybody's eyes, they all wanted
to take part in that last drive.
They all wanted to carry the ball,
catch it, or knock somebody
down. I knew then that we were
going to win it."
Fine Execution
The amazing speed with which
the Indians executed that drive
shook the Wolverines. Tom
Darden, Ail-American safety for
Michigan, said that they went out
of a zone defense on that last
drive. "We went into a
man-to-man and they forced us to
hurry. We had to call our defenses
from the field, and that did not
make things easy, either." It is
significant that when the Michigan
players had only themselves to
rely on, they did not have the
experience or the ability to cope
with the situation. In this crucial
last minute action, Michigan's
overly controlled style of play
worked against them. The Indians
had done what they had to do
according to Mike Simone,
". . . force them out of their game
plan."
Frustration!
The Michigan players felt the
frustration at having to cope with
an unknown quantity. Defensive
end Mike Keller explained this
after the game. "This is the first
time we lost to a passing team.
Ohio State ran on us last year, we
knew what was coming at us then.
But this was more frustrating. The
ball was in the air all the time.
You're hitting their guys just as
hard as you've hit anybody all
year, but it doesn't make any
difference because the ball's in the
air."
Keller unwittingly summed up
Michigan's failure in the 1972
Rose Bowl. Michigan had not
been severely tested this season,
especially by passers, and as a
result did not know its
limitations. The Indians knew
exactly what they could and
could not do and they took
advantage of the Wolverines'
overconfidence. Michigan
displayed great power, but could
not match or cope with the,
instinctively intelligent play of a
perfectly coached and versatile
squad of champions.

STANFORD BUNCES SLADE—The combination of Don Bunce's

It was the perfect justification for
thir ring man's football. The talented
and free thinking Stanford Indians
encountered the plodding football
machine of the University of Michigan
in the game no one thought they would
win, and outhit and outthought the
thundering Wolverines in one of the
most incredible fourth quarters of Rose
Bowl football ever played to earn a
13-12 victory.
The nation's attention was primarily
fixed on the New Year's Day action in
Miami and New Orleans, and the
thought of a fifteenth ranked team
with three losses playing in the oldest
and most prestigious bowl game was
repugnant to some. It was to have been
the rare Rose Bowl game that would
not have any effect on the top national
rankings. Interest in the game seemed
so low that scalpers outside the Rose
Bowl were having trouble getting three
dollars for a ticket.
After the contest, however, many
people wished that they had been there
to see the game that made the Nebraska
slaughter seem like a ridiculous
anticlimax.
Local Interest
There was significant local interest
in the 58th Rose Bowl game, however,
with most of it centered on the
juxtaposition of the life styles of the
two combatants. Michigan's Bo
Schembechler is a strict taskmaster in
the mold of Woody Hayes and holds
the same conservative philosophy about
football as his old teacher. The
Wolverine training camp was very
controlled and the players were kept
from all distractions, including contact
with their families in the last week.

It was not surprising then that the
Michigan team that faced the Indians
last Saturday reflected its upbringing
and played slow, bruising, and highly
predictable football.
In direct contrast, the Stanford
campu had no curfew until the last two
nights, and the players were free to do
whatever they pleased. Mike Simone
described the Indian approach to
football last week, saying that the
" . . . coaches figure we're mature
enough to decide what will hurt our
performances and that we won't do it.
This is an intelligent team. The guys
know what they have to do to get
ready."
While Michigan spent New Year's
Eve in a monastary, the Indians were
watching Sam Peckinpaugh's powerful
new movie, "Straw Dogs," and
wandering around their Long Beach
motel. On Saturday afternoon, the
gambling, intelligent, and confident
play typified the Cards' philosophy of
football.
Stanford set the tone for the
afternoon when Miles Moore took the
kickoff and faked a reverse to John
Winesberry. Bunce concentrated in the
first half on confusing the Michigan
defense by running out of many
different patterns and using Winesberry
The Michigan offense offered no
surprises and the fired up Thunder
Chickens did not allow a first down
until the third series when receiver Bo
Rather made 14 yards on an end
around. The Wolverines had not dented
the Card defense until they used an
innovative play, but they did not learn
from this and resumed their dull
grinding attack that netted them only
one Dana Coin field goal and 133 yards

in the first half on 43 plays.
Stanford had made only 120 yards
on 27 plays but went into the
locker-room too excited to work
seriously on a second half game plan.
They had shown Michigan that they
could contain them and the players felt
that the offense only had to get
untracked to give them a second
consecutive Rose Bowl victory.
The Card attack did indeed catch on
fire in the second half as Bunce
completed 17 of 27 passes for 196
yards and they stormed from behind in
that crazy fourth quarter to eke out a
one point victory with only 12 seconds
left on Rod Garcia's 31 yard field goal,
on inside reverses. The powerful
Wolverine defense broke down the
offensive blocking and knocked down
several Bunce aerials, frustrating the
Indians attack.

HOT ROD—Stanford's soccer-style placekicker Rod Garcia provided the winning margin with his 31 yard field goal in the
final 12 seconds of the Indians 13-12 Rose Bowl victory over Michigan. Garcia also split the uprights from 42 yards out
in the third quarter to tie the game at 3-3. The Chilean kicking specialist had missed attempts from 52 and 55 yards in
the first quarter.
Bunce set up that winning field
goal in that now famous last
minute drive as he completed five
of six passes. He called all the
plays of that drive at the line of
scrimmage in the form of
audibles, and he called most of
the plays throughout the
afternoon while working within
the general confines of offensive
coordinator Mike White's brilliant
game plan. Tom Slade, the
sophomore quarterback for the
Wolverines, had every play sent in
to him from Schembechler by
shuttling receivers. Only a very
few times did Slade change the
coach's play with audibles. Slade
said after the game that "I never
call the plays, and 1 didn't plan

defense to avoid giving Bunce and
his receivers the middle of the
field in which to throw.
Ralston explained that, "The
Michigan linebackers were flaring
out too much, trying to cover too
much ground. This took away the
outside pass. We wanted to keep
them tight, so we ran more fakes
into the line the second half."
Stubbornly refusing to move
inside, the defenders from Ann
Arbor gave Bunce the middle and
he took this route exclusively in
engineering Stanford's last
desperation drive. Winesberry
explained that he was ". . . open
on curls inside since their monster
men were moving outside to take
that away."
Bunce completed passes up the
middle to Winesberry for 12 and
16 yards, Sanderson for 14, Scott
for 13, and Moore for 11 on tint
last drive. His quick thinking and
the confident and precise way in
which the Indians handled the
pressure situation accounted for
the drive's success. Bunce claimed
that "As soon as I got into the
huddle I could see it in
everybody's eyes, they all wanted
to take part in that last drive.
They all wanted to carry the ball,
catch it, or knock somebody
down. I knew then that we were
going to win it."
Fine Execution
The amazing speed with which
the Indians executed that drive
shook the Wolverines. Tom
Darden, Ail-American safety for
Michigan, said that they went out
of a zone defense on that last
drive. "We went into a
man-to-man and they forced us to
hurry. We had to call our defenses
from the field, and that did not
make things easy, either." It is
significant that when the Michigan
players had only themselves to
rely on, they did not have the
experience or the ability to cope
with the situation. In this crucial
last minute action, Michigan's
overly controlled style of play
worked against them. The Indians
had done what they had to do
according to Mike Simone,
". . . force them out of their game
plan."
Frustration!
The Michigan players felt the
frustration at having to cope with
an unknown quantity. Defensive
end Mike Keller explained this
after the game. "This is the first
time we lost to a passing team.
Ohio State ran on us last year, we
knew what was coming at us then.
But this was more frustrating. The
ball was in the air all the time.
You're hitting their guys just as
hard as you've hit anybody all
year, but it doesn't make any
difference because the ball's in the
air."
Keller unwittingly summed up
Michigan's failure in the 1972
Rose Bowl. Michigan had not
been severely tested this season,
especially by passers, and as a
result did not know its
limitations. The Indians knew
exactly what they could and
could not do and they took
advantage of the Wolverines'
overconfidence. Michigan
displayed great power, but could
not match or cope with the,
instinctively intelligent play of a
perfectly coached and versatile
squad of champions.

It was the perfect justification for
thir ring man's football. The talented
and free thinking Stanford Indians
encountered the plodding football
machine of the University of Michigan
in the game no one thought they would
win, and outhit and outthought the
thundering Wolverines in one of the
most incredible fourth quarters of Rose
Bowl football ever played to earn a
13-12 victory.
The nation's attention was primarily
fixed on the New Year's Day action in
Miami and New Orleans, and the
thought of a fifteenth ranked team
with three losses playing in the oldest
and most prestigious bowl game was
repugnant to some. It was to have been
the rare Rose Bowl game that would
not have any effect on the top national
rankings. Interest in the game seemed
so low that scalpers outside the Rose
Bowl were having trouble getting three
dollars for a ticket.
After the contest, however, many
people wished that they had been there
to see the game that made the Nebraska
slaughter seem like a ridiculous
anticlimax.
Local Interest
There was significant local interest
in the 58th Rose Bowl game, however,
with most of it centered on the
juxtaposition of the life styles of the
two combatants. Michigan's Bo
Schembechler is a strict taskmaster in
the mold of Woody Hayes and holds
the same conservative philosophy about
football as his old teacher. The
Wolverine training camp was very
controlled and the players were kept
from all distractions, including contact
with their families in the last week.

It was not surprising then that the
Michigan team that faced the Indians
last Saturday reflected its upbringing
and played slow, bruising, and highly
predictable football.
In direct contrast, the Stanford
campu had no curfew until the last two
nights, and the players were free to do
whatever they pleased. Mike Simone
described the Indian approach to
football last week, saying that the
" . . . coaches figure we're mature
enough to decide what will hurt our
performances and that we won't do it.
This is an intelligent team. The guys
know what they have to do to get
ready."
While Michigan spent New Year's
Eve in a monastary, the Indians were
watching Sam Peckinpaugh's powerful
new movie, "Straw Dogs," and
wandering around their Long Beach
motel. On Saturday afternoon, the
gambling, intelligent, and confident
play typified the Cards' philosophy of
football.
Stanford set the tone for the
afternoon when Miles Moore took the
kickoff and faked a reverse to John
Winesberry. Bunce concentrated in the
first half on confusing the Michigan
defense by running out of many
different patterns and using Winesberry
The Michigan offense offered no
surprises and the fired up Thunder
Chickens did not allow a first down
until the third series when receiver Bo
Rather made 14 yards on an end
around. The Wolverines had not dented
the Card defense until they used an
innovative play, but they did not learn
from this and resumed their dull
grinding attack that netted them only
one Dana Coin field goal and 133 yards

in the first half on 43 plays.
Stanford had made only 120 yards
on 27 plays but went into the
locker-room too excited to work
seriously on a second half game plan.
They had shown Michigan that they
could contain them and the players felt
that the offense only had to get
untracked to give them a second
consecutive Rose Bowl victory.
The Card attack did indeed catch on
fire in the second half as Bunce
completed 17 of 27 passes for 196
yards and they stormed from behind in
that crazy fourth quarter to eke out a
one point victory with only 12 seconds
left on Rod Garcia's 31 yard field goal,
on inside reverses. The powerful
Wolverine defense broke down the
offensive blocking and knocked down
several Bunce aerials, frustrating the
Indians attack.

HOT ROD—Stanford's soccer-style placekicker Rod Garcia provided the winning margin with his 31 yard field goal in the
final 12 seconds of the Indians 13-12 Rose Bowl victory over Michigan. Garcia also split the uprights from 42 yards out
in the third quarter to tie the game at 3-3. The Chilean kicking specialist had missed attempts from 52 and 55 yards in
the first quarter.
Bunce set up that winning field
goal in that now famous last
minute drive as he completed five
of six passes. He called all the
plays of that drive at the line of
scrimmage in the form of
audibles, and he called most of
the plays throughout the
afternoon while working within
the general confines of offensive
coordinator Mike White's brilliant
game plan. Tom Slade, the
sophomore quarterback for the
Wolverines, had every play sent in
to him from Schembechler by
shuttling receivers. Only a very
few times did Slade change the
coach's play with audibles. Slade
said after the game that "I never
call the plays, and 1 didn't plan
to."
Unpredictable Football
While the Indians were playing
a loose and unpredictable brand
of football, Michigan was mired in
the confines of a strict game plan
that called for shoving the ball
down the Cards' throat with
power runs and sweeps. The
Wolverines respected Stanford's
linemen and linebackers and sent
most of their blockers at these
targets on the sweeps, leaving the
Indians secondary to cope with
the running of Billy Taylor. The
Cards came through magnificently
as Randy Poltl with 14 tackles,
Benny Barnes and Tim Robnett
with eight apiece, and Charlie
McCloud with five, came up to
brush aside the interference and
dump Taylor. The fine play of the
Stanford secondary was
responsible for holding the Big
Ten's most valuable player to 82
yards on 32 carries. Schembechler
admitted that the Indians did a
". . . good job defensively. They
got off our blocks well. We just
didn't block well. I can't believe
that we didn't."
A mistake by the Stanford
defense in many crucial points of
the game would have given the
Wolverines what might have been
an insurmountable advantage.
Throughout the game, Indian
defenders made numerous
individual tackles on Taylor,
Slade, and Doughty. It had been
said that no one man could bring
down these Michigan runners, but
the Thunder Chickens dispelled
this myth.
Sluggish Back field
They were aided in their
defensive efforts by the fact that
the Wolverine backfield was
extremely slow in setting up their
running plays, allowing the
Indians to set up the proper
pursuit. Greg Sampson was able to
come all the way over from his
end to catch the fleet Doughty
from behind and make that
spectacular tackle in the first
quarter.
The Cards held Michigan on
four running plays from the five
yard line in the third quarter and
this impressive display of
defensive muscle disheartened the
Wolverines. Schembechler moaned
after the game that, "When we got
down to the goal line and couldn't
score, that was unheard of for
us."
Having proven that they could
outmuscle the strong Big Ten
champions who won many of
their conference games this season
on sheer strength, the Indians
relied on their guile and
confidence to ruin the Wolverines.
Midway through the fourth
quarter, trailing 10-3 on their own
33 yard line, Ralston called a
risky fake punt that would have
spelled doom for his men if it
failed. Jackie Brown sped 31
yards on the hand-off from Jim
Kehl and five passing plays later,
Brown shot through the startled
Michigan line for 24 yards and the
tying touchdown. Once again
Schembechler had cause for
moaning after the game. "They
caught us playing pass."
No First Downs
The Indian defense also did not
allow the Wolverines a first down
in the fourth quarter when the
offense had to have the ball as
Michigan was stymied on its last
four series. After James
Ferguson's controversial safety,
the defense held Michigan to five
yards on three plays and Pete
Lazetich later explained that
Stanford might not have won if it
had not been for that safety. "We
were getting tired, but we figured
that they could not win it that
way. The officials could not cheat
us out of the game, not the Rose
Bowl."
Both the offense and defense
got inspired after the safety
whereas fatigue and a lack of
inspiration might have allowed the
game to end in a 10-10 tie. The

defense was able to come through
at the end of the game, however,
because they had been rested
earlier. Eleven different linemen
played for the Cards and although
Michigan moved the ball against
them, the rest that they provided
the Thunder Chickens proved to
be instrumental in Stanford's
victory.
Michigan did march the ball up
and down the field for 290 yards,
but they only netted 10 points for
these efforts and stubbornly
refused to change strategy even
though they were not succeeding.
Even a Michigan writer
commented before the game that,
"Even if they can't run the ball
against Stanford, it will be well
into the third quarter before Bo
admits it and tries something
else."
Desperation Passes
Aside from a few desperation
passes (one of which wound up in
the first row of the Stanford
bleachers), the Wolverines did not
change their game plan either
offensively or defensively the
whole game even though it was
obvious at halftime that they
should have. During halftime,
several sportscasters commented
that Michigan must alter its
defense to avoid giving Bunce and
his receivers the middle of the
field in which to throw.
Ralston explained that, "The
Michigan linebackers were flaring
out too much, trying to cover too
much ground. This took away the
outside pass. We wanted to keep
them tight, so we ran more fakes
into the line the second half."
Stubbornly refusing to move

he took this route exclusively in
engineering Stanford's last
desperation drive. Winesberry
explained that he was ". . . open
on curls inside since their monster
men were moving outside to take
that away."
Bunce completed passes up the
middle to Winesberry for 12 and
16 yards, Sanderson for 14, Scott
for 13, and Moore for 11 on tint
last drive. His quick thinking and
the confident and precise way in
which the Indians handled the
pressure situation accounted for
the drive's success. Bunce claimed
that "As soon as I got into the
huddle I could see it in
everybody's eyes, they all wanted
to take part in that last drive.
They all wanted to carry the ball,
catch it, or knock somebody

slaughter seem like a ridiculous
anticlimax.
Local Interest
There was significant local interest
in the 58th Rose Bowl game, however,
with most of it centered on the
juxtaposition of the life styles of the
two combatants. Michigan's Bo
Schembechler is a strict taskmaster in
the mold of Woody Hayes and holds
the same conservative philosophy about
football as his old teacher. The
Wolverine training camp was very
controlled and the players were kept
from all distractions, including contact
with their families in the last week.

It was not surprising then that the
Michigan team that faced the Indians
last Saturday reflected its upbringing
and played slow, bruising, and highly
predictable football.
In direct contrast, the Stanford
campu had no curfew until the last two
nights, and the players were free to do
whatever they pleased. Mike Simone
described the Indian approach to
football last week, saying that the
" . . . coaches figure we're mature
enough to decide what will hurt our
performances and that we won't do it.
This is an intelligent team. The guys
know what they have to do to get
ready."
While Michigan spent New Year's
Eve in a monastary, the Indians were
watching Sam Peckinpaugh's powerful
new movie, "Straw Dogs," and
wandering around their Long Beach
motel. On Saturday afternoon, the
gambling, intelligent, and confident
play typified the Cards' philosophy of
football.
Stanford set the tone for the
afternoon when Miles Moore took the
kickoff and faked a reverse to John
Winesberry. Bunce concentrated in the
first half on confusing the Michigan
defense by running out of many
different patterns and using Winesberry
The Michigan offense offered no
surprises and the fired up Thunder
Chickens did not allow a first down
until the third series when receiver Bo
Rather made 14 yards on an end
around. The Wolverines had not dented
the Card defense until they used an
innovative play, but they did not learn
from this and resumed their dull
grinding attack that netted them only
one Dana Coin field goal and 133 yards

in the first half on 43 plays.
Stanford had made only 120 yards
on 27 plays but went into the
locker-room too excited to work
seriously on a second half game plan.
They had shown Michigan that they
could contain them and the players felt
that the offense only had to get
untracked to give them a second
consecutive Rose Bowl victory.
The Card attack did indeed catch on
fire in the second half as Bunce
completed 17 of 27 passes for 196
yards and they stormed from behind in
that crazy fourth quarter to eke out a
one point victory with only 12 seconds
left on Rod Garcia's 31 yard field goal,
on inside reverses. The powerful
Wolverine defense broke down the
offensive blocking and knocked down
several Bunce aerials, frustrating the
Indians attack.

HOT ROD—Stanford's soccer-style placekicker Rod Garcia provided the winning margin with his 31 yard field goal in the
final 12 seconds of the Indians 13-12 Rose Bowl victory over Michigan. Garcia also split the uprights from 42 yards out
in the third quarter to tie the game at 3-3. The Chilean kicking specialist had missed attempts from 52 and 55 yards in
the first quarter.
Bunce set up that winning field
goal in that now famous last
minute drive as he completed five
of six passes. He called all the
plays of that drive at the line of
scrimmage in the form of
audibles, and he called most of
the plays throughout the
afternoon while working within
the general confines of offensive
coordinator Mike White's brilliant
game plan. Tom Slade, the
sophomore quarterback for the
Wolverines, had every play sent in
to him from Schembechler by
shuttling receivers. Only a very
few times did Slade change the
coach's play with audibles. Slade
said after the game that "I never
call the plays, and 1 didn't plan
to."
Unpredictable Football
While the Indians were playing
a loose and unpredictable brand
of football, Michigan was mired in
the confines of a strict game plan
that called for shoving the ball
down the Cards' throat with
power runs and sweeps. The
Wolverines respected Stanford's
linemen and linebackers and sent
most of their blockers at these
targets on the sweeps, leaving the
Indians secondary to cope with
the running of Billy Taylor. The
Cards came through magnificently
as Randy Poltl with 14 tackles,
Benny Barnes and Tim Robnett
with eight apiece, and Charlie
McCloud with five, came up to
brush aside the interference and
dump Taylor. The fine play of the
Stanford secondary was
responsible for holding the Big
Ten's most valuable player to 82
yards on 32 carries. Schembechler
admitted that the Indians did a
". . . good job defensively. They
got off our blocks well. We just
didn't block well. I can't believe
that we didn't."
A mistake by the Stanford
defense in many crucial points of
the game would have given the
Wolverines what might have been
an insurmountable advantage.
Throughout the game, Indian
defenders made numerous
individual tackles on Taylor,
Slade, and Doughty. It had been
said that no one man could bring
down these Michigan runners, but
the Thunder Chickens dispelled
this myth.
Sluggish Back field
They were aided in their
defensive efforts by the fact that
the Wolverine backfield was
extremely slow in setting up their
running plays, allowing the
Indians to set up the proper
pursuit. Greg Sampson was able to
come all the way over from his
end to catch the fleet Doughty
from behind and make that
spectacular tackle in the first
quarter.
The Cards held Michigan on
four running plays from the five
yard line in the third quarter and
this impressive display of
defensive muscle disheartened the
Wolverines. Schembechler moaned
after the game that, "When we got
down to the goal line and couldn't
score, that was unheard of for
us."
Having proven that they could
outmuscle the strong Big Ten
champions who won many of
their conference games this season
on sheer strength, the Indians
relied on their guile and
confidence to ruin the Wolverines.
Midway through the fourth
quarter, trailing 10-3 on their own
33 yard line, Ralston called a
risky fake punt that would have
spelled doom for his men if it
failed. Jackie Brown sped 31
yards on the hand-off from Jim
Kehl and five passing plays later,
Brown shot through the startled
Michigan line for 24 yards and the
tying touchdown. Once again
Schembechler had cause for
moaning after the game. "They
caught us playing pass."
No First Downs
The Indian defense also did not
allow the Wolverines a first down
in the fourth quarter when the
offense had to have the ball as
Michigan was stymied on its last
four series. After James
Ferguson's controversial safety,
the defense held Michigan to five
yards on three plays and Pete
Lazetich later explained that
Stanford might not have won if it
had not been for that safety. "We
were getting tired, but we figured
that they could not win it that
way. The officials could not cheat
us out of the game, not the Rose
Bowl."
Both the offense and defense
got inspired after the safety
whereas fatigue and a lack of
inspiration might have allowed the
game to end in a 10-10 tie. The

defense was able to come through
at the end of the game, however,
because they had been rested
earlier. Eleven different linemen
played for the Cards and although
Michigan moved the ball against
them, the rest that they provided
the Thunder Chickens proved to
be instrumental in Stanford's
victory.
Michigan did march the ball up
and down the field for 290 yards,
but they only netted 10 points for
these efforts and stubbornly
refused to change strategy even
though they were not succeeding.
Even a Michigan writer
commented before the game that,
"Even if they can't run the ball
against Stanford, it will be well
into the third quarter before Bo
admits it and tries something
else."
Desperation Passes
Aside from a few desperation
passes (one of which wound up in
the first row of the Stanford
bleachers), the Wolverines did not
change their game plan either
offensively or defensively the
whole game even though it was
obvious at halftime that they
should have. During halftime,
several sportscasters commented
that Michigan must alter its
defense to avoid giving Bunce and
his receivers the middle of the
field in which to throw.
Ralston explained that, "The
Michigan linebackers were flaring
out too much, trying to cover too
much ground. This took away the
outside pass. We wanted to keep
them tight, so we ran more fakes
into the line the second half."
Stubbornly refusing to move
inside, the defenders from Ann
Arbor gave Bunce the middle and
he took this route exclusively in
engineering Stanford's last
desperation drive. Winesberry
explained that he was ". . . open
on curls inside since their monster
men were moving outside to take
that away."
Bunce completed passes up the
middle to Winesberry for 12 and
16 yards, Sanderson for 14, Scott
for 13, and Moore for 11 on tint
last drive. His quick thinking and
the confident and precise way in
which the Indians handled the
pressure situation accounted for
the drive's success. Bunce claimed
that "As soon as I got into the
huddle I could see it in
everybody's eyes, they all wanted
to take part in that last drive.
They all wanted to carry the ball,
catch it, or knock somebody
down. I knew then that we were
going to win it."
Fine Execution
The amazing speed with which
the Indians executed that drive
shook the Wolverines. Tom
Darden, Ail-American safety for
Michigan, said that they went out
of a zone defense on that last
drive. "We went into a
man-to-man and they forced us to
hurry. We had to call our defenses
from the field, and that did not
make things easy, either." It is
significant that when the Michigan
players had only themselves to
rely on, they did not have the
experience or the ability to cope
with the situation. In this crucial
last minute action, Michigan's
overly controlled style of play
worked against them. The Indians
had done what they had to do
according to Mike Simone,
". . . force them out of their game
plan."
Frustration!
The Michigan players felt the
frustration at having to cope with
an unknown quantity. Defensive
end Mike Keller explained this
after the game. "This is the first
time we lost to a passing team.
Ohio State ran on us last year, we
knew what was coming at us then.
But this was more frustrating. The
ball was in the air all the time.
You're hitting their guys just as
hard as you've hit anybody all
year, but it doesn't make any
difference because the ball's in the
air."
Keller unwittingly summed up
Michigan's failure in the 1972
Rose Bowl. Michigan had not
been severely tested this season,
especially by passers, and as a
result did not know its
limitations. The Indians knew
exactly what they could and
could not do and they took
advantage of the Wolverines'
overconfidence. Michigan
displayed great power, but could
not match or cope with the,
instinctively intelligent play of a
perfectly coached and versatile
squad of champions.

It was the perfect justification for
thir ring man's football. The talented
and free thinking Stanford Indians
encountered the plodding football
machine of the University of Michigan
in the game no one thought they would
win, and outhit and outthought the
thundering Wolverines in one of the
most incredible fourth quarters of Rose
Bowl football ever played to earn a
13-12 victory.
The nation's attention was primarily
fixed on the New Year's Day action in
Miami and New Orleans, and the
thought of a fifteenth ranked team
with three losses playing in the oldest
and most prestigious bowl game was
repugnant to some. It was to have been
the rare Rose Bowl game that would
not have any effect on the top national
rankings. Interest in the game seemed
so low that scalpers outside the Rose
Bowl were having trouble getting three
dollars for a ticket.
After the contest, however, many

admitted that the Indians did a
". . . good job defensively. They
got off our blocks well. We just
didn't block well. I can't believe
that we didn't."
A mistake by the Stanford
defense in many crucial points of
the game would have given the
Wolverines what might have been
an insurmountable advantage.
Throughout the game, Indian
defenders made numerous
individual tackles on Taylor,
Slade, and Doughty. It had been
said that no one man could bring
down these Michigan runners, but
the Thunder Chickens dispelled
this myth.
Sluggish Back field
They were aided in their
defensive efforts by the fact that
the Wolverine backfield was
extremely slow in setting up their
running plays, allowing the
Indians to set up the proper
pursuit. Greg Sampson was able to
come all the way over from his
end to catch the fleet Doughty
from behind and make that
spectacular tackle in the first
quarter.
The Cards held Michigan on
four running plays from the five
yard line in the third quarter and
this impressive display of
defensive muscle disheartened the
Wolverines. Schembechler moaned
after the game that, "When we got
down to the goal line and couldn't
score, that was unheard of for
us."
Having proven that they could
outmuscle the strong Big Ten
champions who won many of
their conference games this season
on sheer strength, the Indians
relied on their guile and
confidence to ruin the Wolverines.
Midway through the fourth
quarter, trailing 10-3 on their own
33 yard line, Ralston called a
risky fake punt that would have
spelled doom for his men if it
failed. Jackie Brown sped 31
yards on the hand-off from Jim
Kehl and five passing plays later,
Brown shot through the startled
Michigan line for 24 yards and the
tying touchdown. Once again
Schembechler had cause for
moaning after the game. "They
caught us playing pass."
No First Downs
The Indian defense also did not
allow the Wolverines a first down
in the fourth quarter when the
offense had to have the ball as
Michigan was stymied on its last
four series. After James
Ferguson's controversial safety,
the defense held Michigan to five
yards on three plays and Pete
Lazetich later explained that
Stanford might not have won if it
had not been for that safety. "We
were getting tired, but we figured
that they could not win it that
way. The officials could not cheat
us out of the game, not the Rose
Bowl."
Both the offense and defense
got inspired after the safety
whereas fatigue and a lack of
inspiration might have allowed the
game to end in a 10-10 tie. The

defense was able to come through
at the end of the game, however,
because they had been rested
earlier. Eleven different linemen
played for the Cards and although
Michigan moved the ball against
them, the rest that they provided
the Thunder Chickens proved to
be instrumental in Stanford's
victory.
Michigan did march the ball up
and down the field for 290 yards,
but they only netted 10 points for
these efforts and stubbornly
refused to change strategy even
though they were not succeeding.
Even a Michigan writer
commented before the game that,
"Even if they can't run the ball
against Stanford, it will be well
into the third quarter before Bo
admits it and tries something
else."
Desperation Passes
Aside from a few desperation
passes (one of which wound up in
the first row of the Stanford
bleachers), the Wolverines did not
change their game plan either
offensively or defensively the
whole game even though it was
obvious at halftime that they
should have. During halftime,
several sportscasters commented
that Michigan must alter its
defense to avoid giving Bunce and
his receivers the middle of the
field in which to throw.
Ralston explained that, "The
Michigan linebackers were flaring
out too much, trying to cover too
much ground. This took away the
outside pass. We wanted to keep
them tight, so we ran more fakes
into the line the second half."
Stubbornly refusing to move
inside, the defenders from Ann
Arbor gave Bunce the middle and
he took this route exclusively in
engineering Stanford's last
desperation drive. Winesberry
explained that he was ". . . open
on curls inside since their monster
men were moving outside to take
that away."
Bunce completed passes up the
middle to Winesberry for 12 and
16 yards, Sanderson for 14, Scott
for 13, and Moore for 11 on tint
last drive. His quick thinking and
the confident and precise way in
which the Indians handled the
pressure situation accounted for
the drive's success. Bunce claimed
that "As soon as I got into the
huddle I could see it in
everybody's eyes, they all wanted
to take part in that last drive.
They all wanted to carry the ball,
catch it, or knock somebody
down. I knew then that we were
going to win it."
Fine Execution
The amazing speed with which
the Indians executed that drive
shook the Wolverines. Tom
Darden, Ail-American safety for
Michigan, said that they went out
of a zone defense on that last
drive. "We went into a
man-to-man and they forced us to
hurry. We had to call our defenses
from the field, and that did not
make things easy, either." It is
significant that when the Michigan
players had only themselves to
rely on, they did not have the
experience or the ability to cope
with the situation. In this crucial
last minute action, Michigan's
overly controlled style of play
worked against them. The Indians
had done what they had to do
according to Mike Simone,
". . . force them out of their game
plan."
Frustration!
The Michigan players felt the
frustration at having to cope with
an unknown quantity. Defensive
end Mike Keller explained this
after the game. "This is the first
time we lost to a passing team.
Ohio State ran on us last year, we
knew what was coming at us then.
But this was more frustrating. The
ball was in the air all the time.
You're hitting their guys just as
hard as you've hit anybody all
year, but it doesn't make any
difference because the ball's in the
air."
Keller unwittingly summed up
Michigan's failure in the 1972
Rose Bowl. Michigan had not
been severely tested this season,
especially by passers, and as a
result did not know its
limitations. The Indians knew
exactly what they could and
could not do and they took
advantage of the Wolverines'
overconfidence. Michigan
displayed great power, but could
not match or cope with the,
instinctively intelligent play of a
perfectly coached and versatile
squad of champions.

STANFORD BUNCES SLADE—The combination of Don Bunce's

It was the perfect justification for
thir ring man's football. The talented
and free thinking Stanford Indians
encountered the plodding football
machine of the University of Michigan
in the game no one thought they would
win, and outhit and outthought the
thundering Wolverines in one of the
most incredible fourth quarters of Rose
Bowl football ever played to earn a
13-12 victory.
The nation's attention was primarily
fixed on the New Year's Day action in
Miami and New Orleans, and the
thought of a fifteenth ranked team
with three losses playing in the oldest
and most prestigious bowl game was
repugnant to some. It was to have been
the rare Rose Bowl game that would
not have any effect on the top national
rankings. Interest in the game seemed
so low that scalpers outside the Rose
Bowl were having trouble getting three
dollars for a ticket.
After the contest, however, many
people wished that they had been there
to see the game that made the Nebraska
slaughter seem like a ridiculous
anticlimax.
Local Interest
There was significant local interest
in the 58th Rose Bowl game, however,
with most of it centered on the
juxtaposition of the life styles of the
two combatants. Michigan's Bo
Schembechler is a strict taskmaster in
the mold of Woody Hayes and holds
the same conservative philosophy about
football as his old teacher. The
Wolverine training camp was very
controlled and the players were kept
from all distractions, including contact
with their families in the last week.

It was not surprising then that the
Michigan team that faced the Indians
last Saturday reflected its upbringing
and played slow, bruising, and highly
predictable football.
In direct contrast, the Stanford
campu had no curfew until the last two
nights, and the players were free to do
whatever they pleased. Mike Simone
described the Indian approach to
football last week, saying that the
" . . . coaches figure we're mature
enough to decide what will hurt our
performances and that we won't do it.
This is an intelligent team. The guys
know what they have to do to get
ready."
While Michigan spent New Year's
Eve in a monastary, the Indians were
watching Sam Peckinpaugh's powerful
new movie, "Straw Dogs," and
wandering around their Long Beach
motel. On Saturday afternoon, the
gambling, intelligent, and confident
play typified the Cards' philosophy of
football.
Stanford set the tone for the
afternoon when Miles Moore took the
kickoff and faked a reverse to John
Winesberry. Bunce concentrated in the
first half on confusing the Michigan
defense by running out of many
different patterns and using Winesberry
The Michigan offense offered no
surprises and the fired up Thunder
Chickens did not allow a first down
until the third series when receiver Bo
Rather made 14 yards on an end
around. The Wolverines had not dented
the Card defense until they used an
innovative play, but they did not learn
from this and resumed their dull
grinding attack that netted them only
one Dana Coin field goal and 133 yards

in the first half on 43 plays.
Stanford had made only 120 yards
on 27 plays but went into the
locker-room too excited to work
seriously on a second half game plan.
They had shown Michigan that they
could contain them and the players felt
that the offense only had to get
untracked to give them a second
consecutive Rose Bowl victory.
The Card attack did indeed catch on
fire in the second half as Bunce
completed 17 of 27 passes for 196
yards and they stormed from behind in
that crazy fourth quarter to eke out a
one point victory with only 12 seconds
left on Rod Garcia's 31 yard field goal,
on inside reverses. The powerful
Wolverine defense broke down the
offensive blocking and knocked down
several Bunce aerials, frustrating the
Indians attack.

HOT ROD—Stanford's soccer-style placekicker Rod Garcia provided the winning margin with his 31 yard field goal in the
final 12 seconds of the Indians 13-12 Rose Bowl victory over Michigan. Garcia also split the uprights from 42 yards out
in the third quarter to tie the game at 3-3. The Chilean kicking specialist had missed attempts from 52 and 55 yards in
the first quarter.
Bunce set up that winning field
goal in that now famous last
minute drive as he completed five
of six passes. He called all the
plays of that drive at the line of
scrimmage in the form of
audibles, and he called most of
the plays throughout the
afternoon while working within
the general confines of offensive
coordinator Mike White's brilliant
game plan. Tom Slade, the
sophomore quarterback for the
Wolverines, had every play sent in
to him from Schembechler by
shuttling receivers. Only a very
few times did Slade change the
coach's play with audibles. Slade
said after the game that "I never
call the plays, and 1 didn't plan
to."
Unpredictable Football
While the Indians were playing
a loose and unpredictable brand
of football, Michigan was mired in
the confines of a strict game plan
that called for shoving the ball
down the Cards' throat with
power runs and sweeps. The
Wolverines respected Stanford's
linemen and linebackers and sent
most of their blockers at these
targets on the sweeps, leaving the
Indians secondary to cope with
the running of Billy Taylor. The
Cards came through magnificently
as Randy Poltl with 14 tackles,
Benny Barnes and Tim Robnett
with eight apiece, and Charlie
McCloud with five, came up to
brush aside the interference and
dump Taylor. The fine play of the
Stanford secondary was
responsible for holding the Big
Ten's most valuable player to 82
yards on 32 carries. Schembechler
admitted that the Indians did a
". . . good job defensively. They
got off our blocks well. We just
didn't block well. I can't believe
that we didn't."
A mistake by the Stanford
defense in many crucial points of
the game would have given the
Wolverines what might have been
an insurmountable advantage.

yards on the hand-off from Jim

tying touchdown. Once again
Schembechler had cause for

that "As soon as I got into the
huddle I could see it in
everybody's eyes, they all wanted
to take part in that last drive.
They all wanted to carry the ball,
catch it, or knock somebody
down. I knew then that we were
going to win it."
Fine Execution
The amazing speed with which
the Indians executed that drive
shook the Wolverines. Tom
Darden, Ail-American safety for
Michigan, said that they went out
of a zone defense on that last
drive. "We went into a
man-to-man and they forced us to
hurry. We had to call our defenses
from the field, and that did not
make things easy, either." It is
significant that when the Michigan
players had only themselves to
rely on, they did not have the
experience or the ability to cope
with the situation. In this crucial
last minute action, Michigan's
overly controlled style of play
worked against them. The Indians
had done what they had to do
according to Mike Simone,
". . . force them out of their game
plan."
Frustration!
The Michigan players felt the
frustration at having to cope with
an unknown quantity. Defensive
end Mike Keller explained this
after the game. "This is the first
time we lost to a passing team.
Ohio State ran on us last year, we
knew what was coming at us then.
But this was more frustrating. The
ball was in the air all the time.
You're hitting their guys just as
hard as you've hit anybody all
year, but it doesn't make any
difference because the ball's in the
air."
Keller unwittingly summed up
Michigan's failure in the 1972
Rose Bowl. Michigan had not
been severely tested this season,
especially by passers, and as a
result did not know its
limitations. The Indians knew
exactly what they could and
could not do and they took
advantage of the Wolverines'
overconfidence. Michigan
displayed great power, but could
not match or cope with the,
instinctively intelligent play of a
perfectly coached and versatile
squad of champions.

STANFORD BUNCES SLADE—The combination of Don Bunce's
clutch fourth quarter passing and the Indians' tremendous
containment of Michigan's vaunted rushing attack proved the
difference in Stanford's 13-12 win in the 1972 Rose Bowl. Bunce

It was the perfect justification for
thir ring man's football. The talented
and free thinking Stanford Indians
encountered the plodding football
machine of the University of Michigan
in the game no one thought they would
win, and outhit and outthought the
thundering Wolverines in one of the
most incredible fourth quarters of Rose
Bowl football ever played to earn a
13-12 victory.
The nation's attention was primarily
fixed on the New Year's Day action in
Miami and New Orleans, and the
thought of a fifteenth ranked team
with three losses playing in the oldest
and most prestigious bowl game was
repugnant to some. It was to have been
the rare Rose Bowl game that would
not have any effect on the top national
rankings. Interest in the game seemed
so low that scalpers outside the Rose
Bowl were having trouble getting three
dollars for a ticket.
After the contest, however, many
people wished that they had been there
to see the game that made the Nebraska
slaughter seem like a ridiculous
anticlimax.
Local Interest
There was significant local interest
in the 58th Rose Bowl game, however,
with most of it centered on the
juxtaposition of the life styles of the
two combatants. Michigan's Bo
Schembechler is a strict taskmaster in
the mold of Woody Hayes and holds
the same conservative philosophy about
football as his old teacher. The
Wolverine training camp was very
controlled and the players were kept
from all distractions, including contact
with their families in the last week.

It was not surprising then that the
Michigan team that faced the Indians
last Saturday reflected its upbringing
and played slow, bruising, and highly
predictable football.
In direct contrast, the Stanford
campu had no curfew until the last two
nights, and the players were free to do
whatever they pleased. Mike Simone
described the Indian approach to
football last week, saying that the
" . . . coaches figure we're mature
enough to decide what will hurt our
performances and that we won't do it.
This is an intelligent team. The guys
know what they have to do to get
ready."
While Michigan spent New Year's
Eve in a monastary, the Indians were
watching Sam Peckinpaugh's powerful
new movie, "Straw Dogs," and
wandering around their Long Beach
motel. On Saturday afternoon, the
gambling, intelligent, and confident
play typified the Cards' philosophy of
football.
Stanford set the tone for the
afternoon when Miles Moore took the
kickoff and faked a reverse to John
Winesberry. Bunce concentrated in the
first half on confusing the Michigan
defense by running out of many
different patterns and using Winesberry
The Michigan offense offered no
surprises and the fired up Thunder
Chickens did not allow a first down
until the third series when receiver Bo
Rather made 14 yards on an end
around. The Wolverines had not dented
the Card defense until they used an
innovative play, but they did not learn
from this and resumed their dull
grinding attack that netted them only
one Dana Coin field goal and 133 yards

in the first half on 43 plays.
Stanford had made only 120 yards
on 27 plays but went into the
locker-room too excited to work
seriously on a second half game plan.
They had shown Michigan that they
could contain them and the players felt
that the offense only had to get
untracked to give them a second
consecutive Rose Bowl victory.
The Card attack did indeed catch on
fire in the second half as Bunce
completed 17 of 27 passes for 196
yards and they stormed from behind in
that crazy fourth quarter to eke out a
one point victory with only 12 seconds
left on Rod Garcia's 31 yard field goal,
on inside reverses. The powerful
Wolverine defense broke down the
offensive blocking and knocked down
several Bunce aerials, frustrating the
Indians attack.

HOT ROD—Stanford's soccer-style placekicker Rod Garcia provided the winning margin with his 31 yard field goal in the
final 12 seconds of the Indians 13-12 Rose Bowl victory over Michigan. Garcia also split the uprights from 42 yards out
in the third quarter to tie the game at 3-3. The Chilean kicking specialist had missed attempts from 52 and 55 yards in
the first quarter.
Bunce set up that winning field
goal in that now famous last
minute drive as he completed five
of six passes. He called all the
plays of that drive at the line of
scrimmage in the form of
audibles, and he called most of
the plays throughout the
afternoon while working within
the general confines of offensive
coordinator Mike White's brilliant
game plan. Tom Slade, the
sophomore quarterback for the
Wolverines, had every play sent in
to him from Schembechler by
shuttling receivers. Only a very
few times did Slade change the
coach's play with audibles. Slade
said after the game that "I never
call the plays, and 1 didn't plan
to."
Unpredictable Football
While the Indians were playing
a loose and unpredictable brand
of football, Michigan was mired in
the confines of a strict game plan
that called for shoving the ball
down the Cards' throat with
power runs and sweeps. The
Wolverines respected Stanford's
linemen and linebackers and sent
most of their blockers at these
targets on the sweeps, leaving the
Indians secondary to cope with
the running of Billy Taylor. The
Cards came through magnificently
as Randy Poltl with 14 tackles,
Benny Barnes and Tim Robnett
with eight apiece, and Charlie
McCloud with five, came up to
brush aside the interference and
dump Taylor. The fine play of the
Stanford secondary was
responsible for holding the Big
Ten's most valuable player to 82
yards on 32 carries. Schembechler
admitted that the Indians did a
". . . good job defensively. They
got off our blocks well. We just
didn't block well. I can't believe
that we didn't."
A mistake by the Stanford
defense in many crucial points of
the game would have given the
Wolverines what might have been
an insurmountable advantage.
Throughout the game, Indian
defenders made numerous
individual tackles on Taylor,
Slade, and Doughty. It had been
said that no one man could bring
down these Michigan runners, but
the Thunder Chickens dispelled
this myth.
Sluggish Back field
They were aided in their
defensive efforts by the fact that
the Wolverine backfield was
extremely slow in setting up their
running plays, allowing the
Indians to set up the proper
pursuit. Greg Sampson was able to
come all the way over from his
end to catch the fleet Doughty
from behind and make that
spectacular tackle in the first
quarter.
The Cards held Michigan on
four running plays from the five
yard line in the third quarter and
this impressive display of
defensive muscle disheartened the
Wolverines. Schembechler moaned
after the game that, "When we got
down to the goal line and couldn't
score, that was unheard of for
us."
Having proven that they could
outmuscle the strong Big Ten
champions who won many of
their conference games this season
on sheer strength, the Indians
relied on their guile and
confidence to ruin the Wolverines.
Midway through the fourth
quarter, trailing 10-3 on their own
33 yard line, Ralston called a
risky fake punt that would have
spelled doom for his men if it
failed. Jackie Brown sped 31
yards on the hand-off from Jim
Kehl and five passing plays later,
Brown shot through the startled
Michigan line for 24 yards and the
tying touchdown. Once again
Schembechler had cause for
moaning after the game. "They
caught us playing pass."
No First Downs
The Indian defense also did not
allow the Wolverines a first down
in the fourth quarter when the
offense had to have the ball as
Michigan was stymied on its last
four series. After James
Ferguson's controversial safety,
the defense held Michigan to five
yards on three plays and Pete
Lazetich later explained that
Stanford might not have won if it
had not been for that safety. "We
were getting tired, but we figured
that they could not win it that
way. The officials could not cheat
us out of the game, not the Rose
Bowl."
Both the offense and defense
got inspired after the safety
whereas fatigue and a lack of
inspiration might have allowed the
game to end in a 10-10 tie. The

defense was able to come through
at the end of the game, however,
because they had been rested
earlier. Eleven different linemen
played for the Cards and although
Michigan moved the ball against
them, the rest that they provided
the Thunder Chickens proved to
be instrumental in Stanford's
victory.
Michigan did march the ball up
and down the field for 290 yards,
but they only netted 10 points for
these efforts and stubbornly
refused to change strategy even
though they were not succeeding.
Even a Michigan writer
commented before the game that,
"Even if they can't run the ball
against Stanford, it will be well
into the third quarter before Bo
admits it and tries something
else."
Desperation Passes
Aside from a few desperation
passes (one of which wound up in
the first row of the Stanford
bleachers), the Wolverines did not
change their game plan either
offensively or defensively the
whole game even though it was
obvious at halftime that they
should have. During halftime,
several sportscasters commented
that Michigan must alter its
defense to avoid giving Bunce and
his receivers the middle of the
field in which to throw.
Ralston explained that, "The
Michigan linebackers were flaring
out too much, trying to cover too
much ground. This took away the
outside pass. We wanted to keep
them tight, so we ran more fakes
into the line the second half."
Stubbornly refusing to move
inside, the defenders from Ann
Arbor gave Bunce the middle and
he took this route exclusively in
engineering Stanford's last
desperation drive. Winesberry
explained that he was ". . . open
on curls inside since their monster
men were moving outside to take
that away."
Bunce completed passes up the
middle to Winesberry for 12 and
16 yards, Sanderson for 14, Scott
for 13, and Moore for 11 on tint
last drive. His quick thinking and
the confident and precise way in
which the Indians handled the
pressure situation accounted for
the drive's success. Bunce claimed
that "As soon as I got into the
huddle I could see it in
everybody's eyes, they all wanted
to take part in that last drive.
They all wanted to carry the ball,
catch it, or knock somebody
down. I knew then that we were
going to win it."
Fine Execution
The amazing speed with which
the Indians executed that drive
shook the Wolverines. Tom
Darden, Ail-American safety for
Michigan, said that they went out
of a zone defense on that last
drive. "We went into a
man-to-man and they forced us to
hurry. We had to call our defenses
from the field, and that did not
make things easy, either." It is
significant that when the Michigan
players had only themselves to
rely on, they did not have the
experience or the ability to cope
with the situation. In this crucial
last minute action, Michigan's
overly controlled style of play
worked against them. The Indians
had done what they had to do
according to Mike Simone,
". . . force them out of their game
plan."
Frustration!
The Michigan players felt the
frustration at having to cope with
an unknown quantity. Defensive
end Mike Keller explained this
after the game. "This is the first
time we lost to a passing team.
Ohio State ran on us last year, we
knew what was coming at us then.
But this was more frustrating. The
ball was in the air all the time.
You're hitting their guys just as
hard as you've hit anybody all
year, but it doesn't make any
difference because the ball's in the
air."
Keller unwittingly summed up
Michigan's failure in the 1972
Rose Bowl. Michigan had not
been severely tested this season,
especially by passers, and as a
result did not know its
limitations. The Indians knew
exactly what they could and
could not do and they took
advantage of the Wolverines'
overconfidence. Michigan
displayed great power, but could
not match or cope with the,
instinctively intelligent play of a
perfectly coached and versatile
squad of champions.
