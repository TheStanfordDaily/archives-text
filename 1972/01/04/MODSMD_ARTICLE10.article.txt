### Bill Evers 
Let Reason Rule
Rationalists like myself
received some bad news from the
January 3 Time magazine.
According to Yale physicist D.
Allan Bromley, many students are
choosing to reject the rationalist
approach. Bromley said:
"Anti-science, or anti-intellectual
activity is much more widespread
than even a few years ago. There
are ten time as many American
college students enrolled in
astrology courses as in
astrophysics courses."

"Socialism From the Right"
Voices are being raised in
criticism of the tyrannical nature
of wage-price controls.
In Congress, Senator William
Proxmire (D—Wise.), in the course
of the debate over the bill which
extended the President's power to
impose wage-price controls, told
his fellow Senators that they
should remember that Federal
Reserve Board Chairman Arthur
Burns had testified in the spring
of 1971 that the wage-price
control legislation proposed at
that time contained "dictatorial"
powers and should not be
extended for more than a few
months, Proxmire questioned the
wisdom of granting the President
sweeping powers to control the
U.S. economy for another 17
months.
Proxmire introduced
an amendment to remove by June
30, 1972, all wage-price controls
from firms with annual sales or
revenues of less than $50 million
or fewer than one thousand
employees. The amendment was
supported by Proxmire and 10
others: Alan Cranston (D -Calif.),
Thomas Eagleton (D—Mo.), Mike
Gravel (D—Alaska), Harold
Hughes (D—lowa), Thomas
Mclntyre (D—N.H.), Lee Metcalf
(D—Mont.), Gavlord Nelson
(D—Wise.), Adlai Stevenson
(D —111.), and Stuart Symington
(D-Mo.).
Also in Congress, Senator Fred
Harris (D—Okla.) aptly termed the
Economic Stablization Act
"socialism from the right." Harris
pointed out that Eastern
European countries have in recent

tyranny" and pointed out that
"only government can cause
inflation, anc it is time
government sta'ed accepting the
blame instead of pretending it is
the fault of the people." An
economic analysis of the controls
by Murray N. Rothbard appears in
the January 1972 Intellectual
Digest.
The Constitutional issues raised
by the controls have been
discussed by several lawyers.
In a letter published in the
September 6 New York Times,
Professor Arthur S. Miller of
Georgetown University termed
the now-superseded 1970
Economic Stabilization Act "a
blank check to regulate the
economy." Miller recalled Justice
Cardozo's characterization of the
National Industrial Recovery Act
in 1935 as "delegation run riot,"
and contended that the same
phenomenon has reoccurred.
Miller pointed out that, among
other things, the freeze
proclaimed by Nixon in August
impaired the obligation of
contracts (namely, "wage
contracts concluded before
August 15, but with salary
increases to begin after that date")
and thus took private property
without just compensation
activity forbidden by the Fifth
Amendment.
In a letter published in the
December 27 New York Times,
Lawrence M. Baskir, chief counsel
and staff director of the Senate
Subcommittee on Constitutional
Rights, discusses the amendment
proposed by Senator Cranston
"which would have given the
communications industry an
exemption from wage and price
controls."
Baskir writes: "That such a
vast and discretionary economic
power should be vested in an ad
hoc bureaucracy answerable only
to the President is a revolutionary
development in American history.
Probably in no other country,
whether socialist or Communist, is
such complete economic power
over each and every business
entity lodged in so few hands with
so little outside control or
review."
Therefore, Baskir conduces:

"Socialism From the Right"
Voices are being raised in
criticism of the tyrannical nature
of wage-price controls.
In Congress, Senator William
Proxmire (D—Wise.), in the course
of the debate over the bill which
extended the President's power to
impose wage-price controls, told
his fellow Senators that they
should remember that Federal
Reserve Board Chairman Arthur
Burns had testified in the spring
of 1971 that the wage-price
control legislation proposed at
that time contained "dictatorial"
powers and should not be
extended for more than a few
months, Proxmire questioned the
wisdom of granting the President
sweeping powers to control the
U.S. economy for another 17
months.
Proxmire introduced
an amendment to remove by June
30, 1972, all wage-price controls
from firms with annual sales or
revenues of less than $50 million
or fewer than one thousand
employees. The amendment was
supported by Proxmire and 10
others: Alan Cranston (D -Calif.),
Thomas Eagleton (D—Mo.), Mike
Gravel (D—Alaska), Harold
Hughes (D—lowa), Thomas
Mclntyre (D—N.H.), Lee Metcalf
(D—Mont.), Gavlord Nelson
(D—Wise.), Adlai Stevenson
(D —111.), and Stuart Symington
(D-Mo.).
Also in Congress, Senator Fred
Harris (D—Okla.) aptly termed the
Economic Stablization Act
"socialism from the right." Harris
pointed out that Eastern
European countries have in recent

tyranny" and pointed out that
"only government can cause
inflation, anc it is time
government sta'ed accepting the
blame instead of pretending it is
the fault of the people." An
economic analysis of the controls
by Murray N. Rothbard appears in
the January 1972 Intellectual
Digest.
The Constitutional issues raised
by the controls have been
discussed by several lawyers.
In a letter published in the
September 6 New York Times,
Professor Arthur S. Miller of
Georgetown University termed
the now-superseded 1970
Economic Stabilization Act "a
blank check to regulate the
economy." Miller recalled Justice
Cardozo's characterization of the
National Industrial Recovery Act
in 1935 as "delegation run riot,"
and contended that the same
phenomenon has reoccurred.
Miller pointed out that, among
other things, the freeze
proclaimed by Nixon in August
impaired the obligation of
contracts (namely, "wage
contracts concluded before
August 15, but with salary
increases to begin after that date")
and thus took private property
without just compensation
activity forbidden by the Fifth
Amendment.
In a letter published in the
December 27 New York Times,
Lawrence M. Baskir, chief counsel
and staff director of the Senate
Subcommittee on Constitutional
Rights, discusses the amendment
proposed by Senator Cranston
"which would have given the
communications industry an
exemption from wage and price
controls."
Baskir writes: "That such a
vast and discretionary economic
power should be vested in an ad
hoc bureaucracy answerable only
to the President is a revolutionary
development in American history.
Probably in no other country,
whether socialist or Communist, is
such complete economic power
over each and every business
entity lodged in so few hands with
so little outside control or
review."
Therefore, Baskir conduces:
"As Senator Ervin remarked
during the Senate debate on the
Let Reason Rule
Rationalists like myself
received some bad news from the
January 3 Time magazine.
According to Yale physicist D.
Allan Bromley, many students are
choosing to reject the rationalist
approach. Bromley said:
"Anti-science, or anti-intellectual
activity is much more widespread
than even a few years ago. There
are ten time as many American
college students enrolled in
astrology courses as in
astrophysics courses."
