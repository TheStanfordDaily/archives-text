Editor, THE DAILY:
I question the justification
behind printing two prominent
articles by Nick Baran in your
December 2 issue. Is he in a
position to be very objective
about Stanford's treatment of his
father? Would the Stanford public
be as willing to accept my account
(supported by documents of
course) of my own father's
treatment at the hands of this
community?
Sincerely,
Jenny Lyman
Yale University
(Editor's Note: The Daily looks
forward to being able to print any
such personal account.)
