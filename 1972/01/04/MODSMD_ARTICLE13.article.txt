## 
### 
EFFECTIVE NOVEMBER 29, 1971

(Published with financial support
from University Relations Office)

In order to provide for safety and good order at
Stanford University, and in accordance with Article IV
of the Legislative and Judicial Charter, the following
procedure for adjudicating alleged student violations of
University regulations is adopted as of November 29,
1971 and will remain in effect until altered by the
President of the University or until such time as a new
judicial system is approved by the students, the faculty,
and the administration.
1. Purpose and Scope of These Procedures-The
procedure described herein will be used to adjudicate:
(a) any case in which the University
administration files a complaint charging that a
student has violated a University regulation
governing student conduct;
(b) any case in which a student files a complaint
charging that a member of the faculty or
administration has taken disciplinary action
against him without his consent and without
adjudication under the judicial system in effect
at the time of the alleged disciplinary action;
or
(c) any case duly pending before the Stanford
Judicial Council as of August 30, 1971.
For these purposes: a student is any person eligible to
matriculate without applying for readmission;
disciplinary action is the imposition of a sanction for
violating a University regulation governing student
conduct; and regulations governing student conduct
consist of the Honor Code, the Fundamental Standard,
the Policy on Campus Disruption, the University Liquor
Policy, the University Policy on Drug Abuse, the
Prohibition of the Possession of Dangerous Weapons,
and such further regulations governing student conduct
as may be duly promulgated by the Student Conduct
Legislative Council or the President of the University.
Subordinate Judicial Councils established under the
Legislative and Judicial Charter and Overseas Campus
Judicial Councils will continue in operation. However,
any matters which, under the regulations governing the
operation of such councils, would have been submitted
for adjudication by the Stanford Judicial Council, will
be submitted instead for adjudication under the
procedures described herein.
2. Appointment of Hearing Officers and a Campus
Judicial Panel-The President of the University will
appoint:
(a) a number of Hearing Officers consisting of
attorneys who are not members of the faculty,
staff, or student body of Stanford;
(b) a committee, the Campus Judicial Panel,
consisting of three (3) students, three (3)
faculty, and a Chairman. The three (3)
students and a number of student alternates
will be appointed randomly from the
registered student body at large. Additional
student alternates may be similarly appointed
from time to time as may appear necessary to
insure the necessary quorum throughout the
autumn, winter, spring, and summer quarters.
The three (3) faculty will be appointed from a
group nominated for that purpose by the
Committee on Committees of the Academic
Senate. The Chairman will be selected by the
President. The term of appointment for each
member of the Campus Judicial Panel shall
expire on the first day of the fall quarter
following the quarter in which the member
was appointed.
3. Complaint and Notice of Charges-The complaint
shall be filed with the Chairman of the Campus Judicial
Panel before the end of the academic quarter following
the academic quarter when the alleged offense or
disciplinary action was, or should reasonably have been,
discovered. Upon receipt of the complaint the Chairman
shall promptly send notice by mail to the person
charged. The complaint and the notice shall contain a
specification of the act upon which the charge is based
and the regulation allegedly violated, or a specification
of the disciplinary action taken and the judicial
procedures which were not followed.
4. Stipulation of Factt-The Chairman of the Campus
Judicial Panel may, in his discretion, meet with the
person charged and the complainant for the purpose of
ascertaining the extent of their agreement as to the facts
relevant to the charge. In the event that the complainant
and the person charged agree to a stipulation of all
relevant facts, the Chairman may omit a hearing before
the Hearing Officer and submit the stipulation to the
Campus Judicial Panel to be acted upon under these
procedures as would a report from a Hearing Officer.
5. Calendar of Proceedings by Hearing Officers-The
complainant and the person charged must be prepared to
proceed with a hearing within a reasonable time after the
complaint is filed. The Chairman of the Campus Judicial
Panel will set a time and place at which a hearing shall be
held by a Hearing Officer for the purpose of determining
the facts relevant to the charge and for the purpose of
making a preliminary recommendation as to whether or
not those facts constitute a violation of a University
regulation as charged, or constitute disciplinary action
without consent and without adjudication under the
applicable judicial system. The Hearing Officer will be
selected by the Chairman from the panel appointed by
the President. Notice of the time, place, and Hearing
Officer selected will be mailed by the Chairman to the
person charged at least seven (7) days prior to the date
of the first scheduled hearing on the charges.
A challenge to the timeliness of the complaint or request
for a change in the time, place, or Hearing Officer

selected for any hearing or tor ihe consolidation or
severance of any cases must be presented to the
Chairman, together with any supporting written
material, at least forty-eight (48) hours prior to the
scheduled hearing. The Chairman will sustain such a
challenge or request if he is persuaded that there are
substantially compelling reasons therefor. However, a
request for a postponement made at any time prior to a
hearing shall be sustained by the Chairman if he is
persuaded that the person charged is unable to attend
the scheduled hearing for good cause. Grounds for such
good cause shall consist only of those set forth in
Section 16 of these procedures. The Chairman may, in
his discretion, consult with the Hearing Officer prior to
ruling on such a challenge or request, but his ruling may
not be reconsidered by the Hearing Officer or the
Campus Judicial Panel-except during a hearing to show
cause as provided in Section 16 of these procedures.
6. Public or Private Nature of Proceedings Before
Hearing Officers-Proceedings conducted by the Hearing
Officer shall be open to the public unless the person
charged and the Chairman of the Campus Judicial Panel
agree that they shall be private and confidential, or
unless the Hearing Officer, in his discretion, deems it
necessary to exclude the public or otherwise restrict
attendance in order to maintain adequate decorum. All
proceedings, whether public or private, will be recorded
on tape, and the recordings will be retained by the
Chairman of the Judicial Panel or his designee for a
minimum of six months.
7. Conduct of Proceedings Before Hearing
Officers—Dux'm% the hearing before a Hearing Officer:
(a) The hearing shall be conducted in a fair and
expeditious manner.
(b) The person charged and/or the complainant
may be presented by counsel, and each may
present relevant evidence and question
witnesses presented by the other.
(c) Facts alleged by the complainant must be
established by the complainant beyond a
reasonable doubt.
(d) The person charged may refuse to give
testimony himself. If the person charged elects
to give testimony, he shall be subject to
examination on his credibility and on all
matters relevant to the charges against him.
(e) The Hearing Officer shall make all rulings on
all matters relating to the conduct of the
hearing before him, including the admission of
evidence-but excluding any matter which,
under these procedures, must be presented to
and decided by the Chairman of the Campus
Judicial Panel. While technical rules of
evidence shall not apply, the Hearing Officer
will exclude irrelevant or unduly repetitious
evidence.
(112) The Hearing Officer may question witnesses
for the purpose of clarifying matters adduced
during the hearing and may request such
additional information as, in his judgment, will
aid him in making his findings and
recommendation. In the absence of counsel for
the complainant or the person charged, the
Hearing Officer shall ask such questions as may
be necessary to satisfy the Hearing Officer that
each witness has been appropriately
questioned on matters concerning credibility
and all substantially relevant issues of fact.
(g) The Hearing Officer may not postpone the
commencement of a hearing—except that the
initial hearing on the charge shall be postponed
if a student charged does not appear. See
Section 16 for the applicable procedures in the
event of such a postponement.
(h) The Hearing Officer may, upon a request after
a hearing has commenced, grant a continuance
only for strongly persuasive reasons and only
when it is not otherwise inconsistent with
these procedures. The absence or departure
from the hearing of counsel for the
complainant or for the person charged shall
not be grounds for such a continuance, and the
departure of the complainant or the person
charged shall be grounds for such a
continuance only if the Hearing Officer is
persuaded that the complainant or person
charged is, for good cause, unable to remain at
the hearing. Grounds for good cause shall
consist only of those set forth in Section 16 of
these procedures.
8. Report of the Hearing Officer-The Hearing Officer,
within ten (10) days after the conclusion of the
proceedings before him, shall submit a report of his
findings, recommendations and reasons therefor to the
person charged, the complainant, the President of the
University, and the Chairman of the Campus Judicial
Panel. The findings of fact contained in this report are
not appealable, except in the sense that they are
recommendations to the President.
9. Calendar of Proceedings by the Campus Judicial
Panel-After receipt of the Hearing Officer's report, the
Chairman of the Campus Judicial Panel shall set a time
and place at which a hearing shall be held before that
panel for the purpose of determining whether or not the
facts as found by the Hearing Officer constitute a
violation of a University regulation as charged, or
constitute disciplinary action without consent and
without adjudication under the applicable judicial
system, and for the purpose of determining the
appropriate sanction or remedial action, if any. Notice

of the hearing shall be mailed to the person charged at
least five (5) days in advance of such a hearing, and the
person charged shall present to the Chairman any
requests for changes in the time or place of the hearing
or for disqualification of any member of the Campus
Judicial Panel at least forty-eight (48) hours prior to the
time at which the hearing is scheduled. The Chairman
shall grant such a request if he is persuaded that there
are substantially compelling reasons therefor.
10. Quorum of the Campus Judicial Panel- Unless
expressly waived by a student charged, the Campus
Judicial Panel will not conduct a hearing when less than
one-half of its members in attendance (excluding the
Chairman) are students, and in no case will the Campus
Judicial Panel conduct a hearing with less than four (4)
of its members plus the Chairman in attendance. The
Chairman may, if necessary to satisfy either ol the
preceding two requirements, appoint one or more of the
student alternates to attend a hearing. A majority vote
of the members attending a hearing and voting shall be
necessary for any determination by the Campus Judicial
Panel. The Chairman may participate in the discussions
and deliberations of the Campus Judicial Panel, but he
shall vote only in the event of a tie.
11. Public or Private Nature of Hearings Before the
Campus Judicial Panel-Hearings conducted by the
Campus Judicial Panel shall be open to the public unless
the person charged and the Chairman agree that they
shall be private and confidential; or unless the Chairman,
in his discretion, deems it necessary to exclude the
public or otherwise restrict attendance in order to
maintain adequate decorum. All hearings, whether
public or private, will be recorded on tape, and the
recordings will be retained by the Chairman of the
Judicial Panel or his designee for a minimum of six
months.
12. Conduct of Hearings Before the Campus Judicial
Panel-During hearings before the Campus Judicial
Panel:
(a) The hearing shall be conducted in a fair and
expeditious manner.
(b) The complainant and/or the person charged
may be represented by counsel.
(c) Only written and oral argument relevant to the
questions before the Campus Judicial Panel
may be presented to the panel, and this
argument may be presented only by the
complainant and the person charged.
(d) As part of his argument, the person charged
may make a motivational statement and plea
in mitigation of sentence—subject to
questioning by members of the panel.
(e) The Chairman of the Campus Judicial Panel
may set time limits on oral argument, may
establish deadlines for receipt of written
material, and will make all rulings relating to
the conduct of the hearing before the Campus
Judicial Panel. The Chairman will also rule on
motions made during the hearing—subject to
being over-ruled by a majority of the members
of the panel sitting on that case.
13. Necessity for Further Determination of Fact-lri the
event that the Campus Judicial Panel decides that the
resolution of additional disputed facts is necessary
before it can make a determination as to whether or not
the facts as found by the Hearing Officer constitute a
violation of a University regulation as charged, or
constitute disciplinary action without consent and
without adjudication under the applicable judicial
system, the Chairman shall remand the case to a Hearing
Officer for purposes of making the necessary additional
findings. The additional findings will be submitted to the
Campus Judicial Panel which may, in its discretion, hold
another hearing to permit further oral argument before
it in accordance with these procedures.
14. Determinations of the Campus Judicial Panel- Upon
a determination as to whether or not the facts as found
by the Hearing Officer constitute a violation of a
University regulation as charged, or constitute
disciplinary action without consent and without
adjudication under the applicable judicial system, the
Campus Judicial Panel will recommend the appropriate
sanction or remedial action, if any.
The Campus Judicial Panel shall promptly issue a written
opinion containing its determinations and the reasons
therefor, and shall mail a copy thereof to the person
charged, the complainant, and the President. These
determinations shall not be appealable, except in the
sense that they are recommendations to the President.
15. Action by the President-A claim that the
procedures herein were not properly followed by a
Hearing Officer or the Campus Judicial Panel, and the
basis of such a claim, must be submitted in writing to
the President within four (4) days of the issuance of the
Campus Judicial Panel's report. The President will report
his action on any such claim and on the
recommendations of the Campus Judicial Panel to the
Chairman, the person charged, and the complainant.
16. Appearance Before the Hearing Officer-When the
complaint falls within Section 1. (a) of these procedures,
the student charged must appear in person at the
commencement of hf? initial hearing before the Hearing
Officer—whether or not his counsel appears. For this
purpose physical presence constitutes an appearance.
In the event that the student charged does not appear at
the commencement of his initial hearing, the Hearing
Officer will postpone the hearing and report that fact to
the Chairman of the Campus Judicial Panel. The
Chairman shall then mail notice to the student charged
of the time and place of a further hearing before a

Hearing Officer to determine whether or not the student
was, for good cause, unable to appear. If the student
charged does not appear at this further hearing, or upon
appearing does not persuade the Hearing Officer that he
was, for good cause, unable to attend the hearing, the
student will be suspended until such time as hearings on
the charges are held by a Hearing Officer and final
recommendations are submitted to the President by the
Campus Judicial Panel. The Hearing Officer's
determination on this matter shall not be appealable,
except in the sense that his determination shall be a
recommendation to the President.
If the complaint falls within the provisions of Section 1.
(b) of these procedures and the person charged does not
appear before the Hearing Officer, the hearing shall
proceed in his absence-unless the person charged
informs the Chairman of the Judicial Panel, in advance
of the hearing, that he will not be able to attend and the
Chairman is persuaded that there is good cause therefor.
For purposes of these procedures good cause shall
consist only of illness or unavoidable and extraordinary
circumstances, and the fact that a civil or criminal action
against the student charged is pending shall not be
considered as such extraordinary circumstances unless
the actual hearing or trial date of the civil or criminal
action conflicts with the date set for the hearing before
the Hearing Officer or before the Campus Judicial Panel.
17. Appearance Before the Campus Judicial Panel-H a
person charged does not appear at the hearing before the
Campus Judicial Panel, or if he departs from the hearing,
the hearing will be conducted in his absence. If, within
three (3) days after such a hearing, the person charged
requests the Chairman to reopen the hearing, and the
Chairman is persuaded that the person was, for good
cause, unable to appear or remain and unable to so
notify the Chairman in advance of the hearing, the
Chairman shall reopen the hearing to receive such oral
argument, motivational statements, pleas in mitigation
and responses thereto, as are permissible under these
procedures. Grounds for good cause shall consist only of
those set forth in Section 16, and the Chairman's
determination on this matter shall not be reviewable by
the Campus Judicial Panel.
18. Preservation of Testimony-If a student charged is
suspended for failing to appear at his hearing, the
Chairman of the Campus Judicial Panel shall, upon
request of the complainant and after mailing notice to
the student charged, arrange for a proceeding conducted
by a Hearing Officer for the purpose of preserving
testimony relevant to the charges. If, at any subsequent
hearing on the charges, a witness is not available despite
a reasonable effort by the complainant to make him
available, the preserved testimony of that witness will be
given the same weight as would such testimony adduced
from the witness in person at the hearing.
19. Vacancy on the Campus Judicial Panel- The
Chairman of the Campus Judicial Panel shall declare a
vacancy to exist when:
(a) the Chairman or a faculty member submits his
resignation from the Campus Judicial Panel,
ceases to be a member of the Stanford faculty,
takes a leave of absence or sabbatical leave
from the University, leaves for an overseas
campus, or ceases to perform his duties as a
member of the Campus Judicial Panel;
(b) a student member submits his resignation
from the Campus Judicial Panel, graduates
from the University, is suspended or placed on
disciplinary probation, leaves for an overseas
campus, ceases to perform his duties as a
member of the Campus Judicial Panel, or fails
to register within the first week of any quarter
during his term of office—except that if a
student member fails to register for the
summer quarter, his position shall not be
declared vacant for that reason if he has agreed
to remain available to carry out his duties as a
member of the Campus Judicial Panel during
that summer quarter.
20. Alternate Judicial Procedure-A. student charged
will have his case heard entirely by the Dean of Students
if the student so requests and the Dean of Students
agrees. In that event, the determinations of the Dean of
Students shall not be appealable, except in the sense that
they are recommendations to the President.
21. Sanctions-Sanctions shall be recommended
according to the circumstances of each individual case
and must conform to restrictions on sanctions
promulgated in accordance with the Legislative and
Judicial Charter. In recommending an appropriate
sanction, the Campus Judicial Panel shall take into
account the nature and seriousness of the offense, the
knowledge and intent of the student, prior violations of
University regulations and prior violations of the
criminal law committed on the campus, and the
likelihood, or lack thereof, of similar misconduct by the
student in the future. If in a State or Federal Court, civil
or criminal penalties have already been assessed against a
student in a case arising out of an incident which is the
subject of the case before the Campus Judicial Panel, the
panel shall recommend such additional sanctions, if any,
which it believes necessary to protect the persons,
property, and functions of the University. The pendency
of such a case in a State or Federal Court shall not,
however, be cause for delaying final recommendations
from the Campus Judicial Panel to the President.
22. Confidentiality-In no case shall a record of
disciplinary action be placed on a student's transcript. If
the Chairman of the Campus Judicial Panel and the
person charged agree that the proceedings to adjudicate
the charges shall be conducted in private, or if the case is
heard by the Dean of Students, any matters of fact
which would tend to identify the person or persons
involved in the case shall be kept confidential.
