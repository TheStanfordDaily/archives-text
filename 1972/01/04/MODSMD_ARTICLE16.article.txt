Former Deputy Defense
Secretary and Mrs. David Packard
have given Stanford $2.6 million,
one of the largest donations from
a single source in Stanford
history.
The gift, announced last week
by President Richard Lyman, is
from increased assets of a $301
million _rust fund established by
the Packards when he was named
Deputy Secretary of Defense in
January 1969.
At that time, to avoid any
confict-of-interest problems, they
put their Hewlett-Packard stock
into a trust fund, and agreed to
distribute any increase in value of
the trust assets to charitable
institutions.
Packard resigned from the
Defense Department on December
13, and the trust terminated on
that date.
According to the Palo Alto
Times, Packard and his wife have
made no "absolute" designations
on how the $2.6 million must be
used by Stanford, but plan to

make "suggestions about how we
would prefer to have the funds
used" during discussions with the
University trustees.
The Packards, who reside in
Los Altos Hills, have provided
fellowships in classics, business,
and earth sciences; endowed a
professorship in the humanities;
financed freshmen seminars; and
supported the Hoover Institution,
the school of engineering, the
department of athletics and the
department of computer science
in previous gifts.
"Through the Packard's
generosity over the years and
Dave's many, many acts of service
to higher education, they have
honored as well as aided their
alma mater, and have shown a
keen appreciation for the
University's varied needs.
"It will be good to have Dave
and Lu once again living in this
community, which they have
benefited so much," said Lyman.
The former deputy secretary
was a member of the Stanford

Board of Trustees from 1954
through 1968, including a
two-year term as president.
Packard, who received his A.B.
in 1934 and earned an electrical
engineer degree in 1939, heads the
Palo Alto-based Hewlett-Packard
electronic corporation. Ms.
Packard received her A.B. in
1935.
Recent large gifts to the
University have included $1

million to the law school in 1969
from Fredrick Richman, a Laguna
Beach attorney and land
developer. At the time it was one
of the largest indivudual gifts
from a living alumnus.
In announcing the gift,
President Lyman noted: I'm
Â°nourmously pleased and grateful
to Dave and Lu Packard for this
latest of their many gifts to
Stanford.
