## 
### 
Willie Newberry - , co-chariman
of the Black Students Union, and
three others have received eight
month jail sentences and must pay
damages for their part in the April
9 sit-in at the Hospital.
Superior Court Judge James B.
Scott sentenced the four —
Nicholas Harper, Erwin
Lavenberg, John Kay and
Newberry — to five years
probation, and eight months in
the Santa Clara County jail. In
addition Scott ordered that the
four:
--sign a "confession of
judgement" (agreement to pay)

and pay restitutions for damage at
the sit-in when an exact amount
has been determined. The
preliminary estimates of damage
ran as high as $100,000.
The sentences were by far the
heaviest meted out by the courts
in connection with the hospital
sit-ins. Harper, 25, of Sunnyvale
and Kay, 23, of Palo Alto pleaded
no contest on Oct. 12 to assault
on a police officer, a felony.
The same day, Newberry, 26,
and Lavenberg, 22, of Redwood

battery on a police officer, also a
felony.
