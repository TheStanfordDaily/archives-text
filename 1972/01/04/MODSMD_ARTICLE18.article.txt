# Bazile-Laury Acquitted
## 
### 
An all-white jury acquitted
former BSU chairman Leo Bazile
and black activist Chris Laury of
charges of assaulting Mary Jane
Schmidt last Spring in a decision
announced December 12.
Schmidt, a medical records
clerk at the Stanford Medical
Center, contended that the two
attacked her last May 2 as she
returned to her apartment after
refusing to honor picket lines
during last spring's Med Center
sit-in.
The case went to the jury after

several motions to dismiss the
charges against the two were
denied. The defense cited
inconsistencies that had developed
in the prosecution's case as
grounds for dismissal.
They first referred to the
pre-trial hearing last spring during
which Schmidt had identified
another man, Keith King, as
Laury.
Bazile, who graduated last
June, is a first-year Law student at
Boalt Law School in Berkeley.
