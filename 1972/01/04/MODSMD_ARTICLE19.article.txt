# Faculty, Staff May Get Frozen Pay, Benefits
## 
### 
Faculty and staff may very
well receive previously scheduled
but frozen pay and benefit
increases retroactive to Sept. 1,
1971, according to President
Lyman.
Lyman announced last week
that under the provisions of the
Economic Stabilization Act
Amendments of 1971 signed into
law by President Nixon Dec. 22,
he believes it is reasonable to
expect that the retroactive pay
increases will be allowed.
The staff is currently
undertaking the paper work that
is required to comply with federal
procedural instructions which must
be satisfied prior to actual
disbursement of funds, as well as
beginning the task of preparing
and processing the payroll
documents themselves in
anticipation of eventual approval.
The University hopes that the
government will give its approval
in time for employees to receive
such retroactive payments
sometime in February 1972.
The recently enacted
legislation generally permits the
payment of compensation
(including fringe benefit) increases
not "unreasonably inconsistent"
with established government

standards which (1) were agreed
to in employment contracts
executed prior to Aug. 15, 1971,
(2) were scheduled to take effect
prior to Nov. 14, 1971, and (3)
were not paid because of orders
issued under the Economic
Stabilization Act.
