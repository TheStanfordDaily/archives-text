# SLAC Opens After Bombing
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
No news was good news at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center yesterday, as the facility reopened
smoothly after two bombs caused $45,000 damage early
last month.
SLAC Director Wolfgang Panofsky called the opening
"completely routine," and said that from all indications all
damages from the December 7 blasts have been repaired.
The two man-made bombs exploded minutes apart, the
first at 3:28 a.m. Many residents near the facility located
on Sand Hill Road behind the campus, were awakened.
Original estimates of damages stood at about $100,000,
but, according to Dr. Panofsky, the actual figure was closer
to $45,000, which will come out of the SLAC general
budget."And of that figure, over half of it was in labor,
people working on repairs instead of doing something else.
The actual out-of-pocket costs for materials was
considerably less." The loss was not covered by insurance.
The bombs did not damage the two-mile long main
tunnel that runs under Interstate 280 in the foothills

behind the campus. The damage was centered in Sector 0,
disabling the master oscillator and the beam knock-out
system.
Dr. Panofsky said that from all indications, everything is
currently functioning smoothly. Tests were conducted over
the quarter break prior to yesterday's "routine" turn-on,
which provided the gut test of the equipment.
"We have six experiments scheduled to begin, and
everything is going well," Dr. Panofsky said yesterday.
Built at a cost of $114 million, SLAC, the world's
longest and most powerful linear accelerator, is financed by
the United States Atomic Energy Commission.
Because of the A.E.C. connection and the destruction of
government property involved, the FBI is handling the
investigation.
Robert E. Gebhardt, the agent in charge of the FBI
office in San Francisco, refused comment beyond stating
that "the investigation is still continuing."
Dr. Panofsky said, "I have no idea on either the motive
or method" behind planting the explosives, each of which
was equivalent to about one stick of dynamite.
However, he came up with a number of theoretical
motives.
He pointed out that the blast occurred on the 30th
anniversary of Pearl Harbor, and theorized that perhaps
there was a connection in someone's mind, despite the fact
that SLAC does no Department of Defense-connected
work.
He also suggested that the bombing may have been done
to protest rising unemployment in technical fields, but
added that "It well might be that there was no political
motive at all, that this was just an isolated piece of
insanity."
At about 11 a.m., some seven and a half hours after the
bombing, a telephoned bomb threat forced the evacuation
of some 300 SLAC employees for about two hours, but no
bomb was found.
Later that afternoon, a caller to San Francisco television
station KQED claimed credit for the bombing, but
authorities and Dr. Panofsky dismissed his claim as coming
from heavy local publicity of the incident.
Beyond that, said Dr. Panofsky, no individuals or
political organizations have claimed credit for the bombing.
