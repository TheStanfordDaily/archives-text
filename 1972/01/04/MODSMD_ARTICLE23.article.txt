# Tribe Rolls Over Dartmouth In Foul Filled Game, 102-85
## 
### 
Stanford sports remained undefeated in 1972 as the Indian cagers
raced past Darmouth 102-85 Monday night. Led by Claude Terry's
season high 32 points, the Indians led almost all the way, leaving the
issue rarely in doubt.
The Tribe took advantage of a height advantage of an inch and a
half per man, combined with hot shooting from the field and the line
to lead by as much as fifteen points in the first half. As a team,
Stanford shot 57% from the field in that half and 88%' from the foul
line.
Darmouth was hampered when their 6'10" center Jim Masker
picked up three early fouls, ending the half with four. His resultant
caution left him with zero rebounds in the half.
The Eastern Indians mounted a strong comeback at the start of the
second half, moving away for good.
Dartmouth's back was completely broken when an argument over a
foul called on their star guard James Brown lead to three quick
technicals, six points for Stanford and the ejection of Brown. This
came on top of one technical on Dartmouth's Gary Dicovitskv in the
first half.
In addition to Terry 's 32, guard Bob Nicholson hit his season high
with 18 and David Frost maintained his average with 13. Dartmouth
was lead by guard Bill Ravnor with 23.
