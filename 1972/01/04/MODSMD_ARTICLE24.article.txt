## The 						Stanford Way 
### Don Tollefson 
Two consecutive New Year's Days in Pasadena.
Two consecutive undefeated and reportedly
invincible Big Ten teams. And two consecutive
victories by brilliant and excitingly unpredictable
Stanford teams. Too much!
Once again a Big Ten coach brought his squad
out to the West Coast, kept them confined with
strict training rules, closed the doors on all his
practices, played dull, plodding football and lost.
And just as Michigan coach Bo Schembechler's old
boss Woody Hayes had done a year ago, he lost to a
Stanford team whose attitude both on and off the
field radically differed from their opponent's.
Schembechler let his players stay out until the
wee hour of 11 p.m. But he said that an hour before
midnight, "they better be in their rooms."
Schembechler also said that he didn't really mind
the "distractions" of trips to Disneyland and a
television show during the first week of practice,
but he said that during the second week when
family and friends show up, there are "ten times as
many distractions. I'd like to take the whole team
to Santa Barbara."
Unspecified Time
Meanwhile down in Long Beach the Stanford
players weren't under any curfew. And they had
access to official Tournament of Roses cars with the
only stipulation being that the car keys had to be
returned to the motel's front desk when the players
came in each "evening" — time unspecified.
The contrasting styles of the two teams were also
apparent on the practice field. Stanford held their
first week of practices daily in front of a crowd of a
hundred or so observers at Long Beach State
College. Players mingled freely with friends and
relatives before and after practice. And Coach John
Ralston was always willing to stop and talk with
well-wishers and sign autographs, even when it
meant that he had to stay around long after most
players had showered and returned to their motel.
Secret Practices
Over in East Los Angeles, Michigan was holding
all their practices behind closed doors. Early during
the first week of practice, the Michigan Sports
Information Director said that Schembechler
"doesn't want anybody at his practices."
Stanford held secret practices during the second
week of workouts so i,ney could work on their game
plan and the innovations involved in it. But the
necessity for having all practices closed by a
Michigan team whose game plot was about as
surprising as the decision in one of Perry Mason's
cases, is hard to figure out.
When all the practices and nights on the town or
in the hotel rooms were over, the styles of the two
teams on a Rose Bowl field in front of 103, 154
fans and millions more television viewers were as
clearly and totally contrasting as the style of the
schools' bands.
Toy Soldier Band
Michigan's band is one of those typical
w ho- turned-the-key-in-the-back-of-the-toy-soliders
bands and a majority of the songs they performed
were hardly distinguishable from each other. Their
heart banner attached to balloons which failed to
get off the ground at the close of their halftime
show was an appropriate closing note for a
performance which was as musically memorable as
most of the music in a doctor's waiting room.
As usual, the Stanford band put music ahead of
militarism and their pre-game and halftime shows
and post-game victory celebrations were both
exciting and innovative. Stanford assistant coach
Mike White said, "The band has the same attitude as
our players. They may screw around, but when the
chips are down, they do the job.
And Stanford's football team did play as
unpredictably as their band had in a classic clash
with the predictability of Michigan's footballers.
Permissive Approach
Looking back at the game on Monday morning,
White continued his analysis of what the victory
meant in terms of Stanford's fairly unique approach
to football.
"This Rose Bowl win means a victory for our
different approach to football. We're a little more
permissive. We treat our players like men and
intelligent individuals to whom we give
responsibility. I think our kids have responded well

to this approach among themselves.
"This approach has given the team confidence in
themselves. This is what we have built—a lot of
poise. The kids believe in themselves because we
give them the opportunity. Our kids don't have any
real dependence on us coaches. We try to give them
an independent feeling. When the chips are down,
they're going to respond. The secrr■ of our success
has always been winning the big game."
Kehl Punt
And Stanford won this big game with some of
the same kind of unique thinking and strategy
which has characterized their play over the last few
years. They won with plays like the now famous
"Kehl Punt" in which the Indians worked to
perfection a play the coach at North Dakota State
had given to Ralston after it had been used against
him by Montana.
Remarkably it worked even though Michigan
smelled out a fake, but fortunately could keep up
with it only through the next-to-last step before
Kehl put the ball through Jackie Brown's legs.
And they won it with the kind of thinking and
ingenuity which shocked Michigan by running the
ball in for their only touchdown after passing their
way all over the field. Possibly most importantly,
they won it with a defensive strategy which has
been often criticized by football "experts."
Safety Call
They may have been able to drive down the field
for Rod Garcia's dramatic winning field goal
because of a unique defensive line strategy. White
outlined what may have been the key to the final
198 seconds following the safety call by Big-10
referee William Quimby. The call has since been
criticized by innumerable reporters who were
covering the game, but right or wrong, it gave
Michigan an apparently insurmountable 12-10 lead.
When Michigan got the ball on their own 45
following Garcia's free kick, all they had to do was
get one or two first downs to ice a 12-10 victory.
This was a Michigan team which had run 258 more
plays than their opponents during their 11-0 season
and which had averaged 341.8 yards rushing per
game. And yet in those final three minutes they
coulnd't control the ball or much less even get one
first down. Why?
Before each game, according to White, defensive
line coach Max McCartney tells his starting defensive
linemen what percentage of the game he wants them
to play. And he outlines the "clutch" situations he
definitely wants them to all be in for. Within those
boundaries, they are free to take themselves in and
out of the game.
Liberal Substitution
So all during the Rose Bowl you may have seen
any number of substitute defensive linemen in the
game at certain times — people like John Ferguson
and Pete Hanson and Barry Reynolds and Joe
Martin and Lew Williams. So when the "clutch"
situations occurred such as Stanford's dramatic goal
line stand in the third quarter, starters Pete
Lazetich, Larry Butler, Greg Sampson and Pierre
Perreault, after a little bit of rest, were able to stop
the Wolverines.
Most importantly, when the Wolverines took
over after the safety, the starting Indian defensive
linemen were rested enough to stop them pretty
much cold. And conversely, when Stanford was
executing its winning drive, the Michigan defensive
linemen, who had not had the rest and advantage of
such liberal substitution, were ineffectual at getting
anywhere near Don Bunce.
As White says,"The secret of defensive line play
is being fresh in the fourth quarter. Being ready to
perform in what Coach McCartney terms the
"clutch" situations. Our best players were ready in
the clutch. It's a unique system and philosophy."
And as with most of Stanford's approach, the
unique and innovative idea worked and led to
another big win.
It was appropriate that as many of the players
filed out of their lockerroom, the Stanford band
was still playing for excited thousands of fans still
out on the field. The headline on sportswriter Jim
Murray's column in the Sunday Los Angeles Times
read: "A Mod Scene: Tribe Kicks Establishment in
the Shins." All I can say to both the band and
footballers is Keep On Truckin'.
