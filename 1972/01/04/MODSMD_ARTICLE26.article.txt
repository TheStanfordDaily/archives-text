Pat Paulsen Bid
LOS ANGELES — Comedian Pat Paulsen, who made a
tongue-in-cheek run for president in 1968, said yesterday
he is trying to enter New Hampshire's Republican
presidential primary in a serious try for the nation's highest
office.
"I want to shake them up and I think I can, if I can
convince Republicans that I'm serious," said Paulsen.
"I want to turn this country around, inwardly, which is
what we need right now. I think I'm an honest candidate,
because I don't have any pressure, I don't owe any favors,"
he said.
Unpaid Loans
WASHINGTON — Congressional auditors say the federal
government was stuck with $13.3 million in unpaid loans
to college students as of last Sept. 30, a nearly three-fold
increase in eight months.
The Government Accounting Office said in a report
released yesterday that unpaid loans to students totalled
about $5 million as of Jan. 31, 1971.

Pay Board Exception
WASHINGTON — A business member of the Pay Board
said yesterday it will cut down somewhat a 12 percent pay
raise for aerospace workers, then begin living by its 5.5
percent rule.
Even an 8 percent raise would exceed the board's rules,
which say raises in new contracts generally may not exceed
5.5 percent a year, and even in special cases can't go over 7
percent.
