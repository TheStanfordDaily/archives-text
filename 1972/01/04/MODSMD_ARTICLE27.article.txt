# $200 Taken In Soto Holdup
## 
### 
About $200 was taken at gunpoint
from the dorm room of two students
last night, by two unidentified
assailants.
According to Dave Meyer, one of
the two victims, he heard the suspects
knocking on a door across the hall from
Meyer's Soto House room.
The two assailants then entered
Room 104, pulling a blue steel revolver
on Meyer and his roommate, Mike
Manda, and demanded that they empty
their pockets.
The two then took the money and a
heavy bicycle chain that was hanging
on the door, warned Manda and Meyer
not to follow them, and departed.
The crime was reported to the Santa
Clara Countv Sheriff's Office at about

9:15 p.m.
According to Lt. Donald Tamm of
the Sheriff's Office, police are looking
for two black males in their late teens
to early twenties. The taller of the two,
according to Manda, wore a green
stocking cap and brandished the gun.
Police at the scene stopped two
students for questioning at about
10:05, but later released them.
By-standers commented that they had
seen the two at the
Stanford-Dartmouth basketball game at
the time the incident was supposed to
have taken place.
Neither Meyer nor Manda could say
how, or if, the two assailants had any
prior knowledge that that much money
would be on hand.
