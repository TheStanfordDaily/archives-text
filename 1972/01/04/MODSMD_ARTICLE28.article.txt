# Franklin Case
## Final Briefs Debate Standards 
### LARRY LIEBERT News Analysis 
What legal standards apply to a campus courtroom?
Appropriate guidelines were argued in lengthy final briefs,
submitted Dec. 17 in the dismissal hearing of
professor-revolutionary Bruce Franklin.
The problems of sorting out legal precedents for a
clearly unprecedented case were tackled in a 153-page brief
from Franklin and an 83-page document from the
administration.
Each side argued its own theories concering the validity
of campus rules, what Supreme Court standards to use, and
how to apply the standards to the 4,200-page transcript of
the Franklin hearing.
Three of the four charges against Franklin involve
allegedly inciteful speech, and the two briefs differed
significantly on the line between "free speech" and
incitement.
Franklin argued that a professor could only be punished
for "intent"—if he deliberately set out to produce illegal
acts. But the administration insisted that Franklin could
also be ousted for "reckless" speech—if he consciously
disregarded substantial and unjustified risks.
The administration lawyers wrote that outside courts
were divided concerning use of the "recklessness" standard,
and they conceded it may not be constitutional for
criminal cases. But they argued that the Advisory Board
"cannot help but find that reckless incitement, cannot be
tolerated in the university community."
They quoted a brief to the Advisory Board from Law
Professors Gerald Gunther and Herbert Packer, who said,
"In developing the 'law' that may be applied on a private
university campus, it is entirely reasonable to require a
faculty member to adhere to standards which would not be
required of a man in the street."
The administration advocated punishing "reckless"
incitement by professors because of their "position of
trust" as leaders of students and because the university is
"a relatively fragile institution; recklessness could easily
destroy it."
Franklin, on the other hand, protested that use of the
"recklessness" standard would "mean that less than the full
protection of the Constitution should apply on campus."
He said that the Supreme Court had clearly demanded the
"intent" standard for incitement and cited use of that
guideline in the Civil Liberties Union's brief to the
Advisory Board.
Franklin and his assistants said the "recklessness"
standard would allow the administration to punish "any
words that can be seized upon." And they said, "When one
urges some form of political action he is not responsible for
every subsequent unlawful act, despite the colorfulness of
the oratory."
Franklin also charged the administration shifted to
"recklessness" after his defense successfully refuted the
stricter "intention" standard. But in spite of the debate
over standards, the administration continued to insist that
Franklin was guilty of both "intentional" and "reckless"
incitement. And Franklin still argued that he was guilty of
neither.
The briefs also covered Franklin's allegation that he was
charged under "vague and overbroad" campus rules. The
administration insisted it was "abundantly clear" that

Franklin had violated the tenure policy, the Campus Policy
on Disruption, "and the academic common law against
force, violence, and coercion."
Lawyer Ray Fisher and his team called Franklin's
contention of vague rules "patently silly." They said the
rules were commonly understood and that "standards of
specificity" used in criminal courts were not legally
required "in a relatively small and cohesive community
such as a university faculty."
However, Franklin insisted that the administration's
claim of "a consensus in this community with regard to
forms of political expression is a myth." He charged that
the administration's version of academic "traditions"
ignored his radical analysis of the "modem multiversity" as
well as Stanford's history' of punishing dissenters "for
nothing more than speech."
The tenure rules and disruption policy both fail to
stipulate "rules of conduct, let alone penalties for specific
violations," Franklin charged.
Such "vague" rules do not give "fair notice" to those
who "choose to tailor their conduct to the existing
standards," the suspended professor argued.
Each brief also presented its authors' interpretation of
testimony in the six-week dismissal hearing, and each party
denounced its opponent for distorting the evidence.
Franklin charged he "is being tried because he is a
Communist revolutionary, not because of the isolated acts
with which he is charged."
His brief argued that "the First Amendment protects the
transmission of ideas, unpopular ideas, revolutionary ideas
and even unlawful ideas."
The administration said, "It may seem a paradox that it
is necessary to defend freedom on this campus by
punishing an individual who claims that freedom for itself.
There is no paradox. The University provides no freedom
to obstruct, no freedom to incite, no defense for the
callous disregard of the safety of others."
Administrators charged that Franklin combined
intolerable conduct with "utter cynicism towards the fate
of students caught up in these unlawful activities."
Franklin would clearly "repeat such actions if allowed
to return," they argued, charging that he "has forfeited his
right to remain a faculty member."
Franklin's brief contended that the administration had
invented "a Bruce Franklin who is a strange composite of
cold-blooded, calculating Machiavel, lunatic, and fool."
Franklin answered that he would have lost his supporters if
he were such a cynical manipulator.
The "defense" brief closed with the assertion that
Franklin was "quite a different person" than the
administration had contended. "Many may disagree with
him and disapprove of his actions. Many may dislike him.
But it is hard to see how any could fail to acknowledge his
courage, honesty, and integrity," the Franklin brief said.
