# Franklin Decision Ready-Almost
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
The Advisory Board has finally
reached a decision in the case of H.
Bruce Franklin—but the
recommendation will not be announced
until tomorrow or Thursday.
Board secretary Sally Monfort said
yesterday that it will take that long for
her to type the "fairly bulky
document" and for the Board to
complete some "very last-minute
revisions."
Board chairman Donald Kennedy
confirmed that the Board's decision has
been reached but said that "parts of It
are still being reworked so that they say
exactly what we mean."
The board was unable to complete
its deliberations before Christmas, the
latest failure to meet a series of
informal target dates for completion of
the case. The seven faculty judges did
manage to finish before Board member
David Hamburg left this weekend for
an African sabbatical.
The Board's findings, expected to
fill over 100 pages, will be submitted to
President Richard W. Lyman as
recommendations. Minority opinions
may be included. If Lyman rejects the
Board's decision, he will have to submit
his objections to the Board before using
his veto power.
According to the tenure policy, only
Franklin can announce the Board's
recommendation to the public prior to
jLyman's review process. It appears
likely that Franklin will release the
recommendation as soon as it is
announced, Wednesday or Thursday,

although he has declined to promise
immediate disclosure.
Franklin was first charged with
inciting and participating in campus
disruptions almost 11 months ago. His
hearing began one quarter ago, Sept.
28, and ended Nov. 5.
The Board's deliberations were
long-delayed by the wait for a complete
transcript of the hearings. The
35-volume transcript—totalling 4,200
pages—was finally completed Dec. 9.
Lengthy final briefs, the last
documents submitted to the Board,
received Dec. 17. Kennedy said
the Board spent much of its time since
then studying the "very meaty final

briefs."
He said the "parties put a hell of a
lot of work into those things" and the
Board "had to think about" major
differences in the legal standards urged
by the administration and Franklin.
(See article on final briefs, page 10.)
Mori fort said the Board met every
day after receiving the final briefs,
except for Christmas Day and New
Year's.
With Franklin's future still
undecided as the new quarter begins,
his supporters are attempting to arrange
a substitute version of his scheduled
winter quarter course. Venceremos
members handed out leaflets at

registration, urging students to sign up
for English 190, a four-unit "ad hoc
seminar."
The supporters explained the
seminar would fulfill requirements of
Franklin's "Literature and Revolution"
course. They said guest lecturers would
teach the course "until Franklin can
teach it himself."
English Department Chairman W.
Bliss Carnochan said that applications
for English 190 are available in the
English Department office. He
explained that department committees
would meet this week to consider the
applications for an "ad hoc" seminar
based on Franklin's course.

an African sabbatical.
The Board's findings, expected to
fill over 100 pages, will be submitted to
President Richard W. Lyman as
recommendations. Minority opinions
may be included. If Lyman rejects the
Board's decision, he will have to submit
his objections to the Board before using
his veto power.
According to the tenure policy, only
Franklin can announce the Board's
recommendation to the public prior to
jLyman's review process. It appears
likely that Franklin will release the
recommendation as soon as it is
announced, Wednesday or Thursday,

although he has declined to promise
immediate disclosure.
Franklin was first charged with
inciting and participating in campus
disruptions almost 11 months ago. His
hearing began one quarter ago, Sept.
28, and ended Nov. 5.
The Board's deliberations were
long-delayed by the wait for a complete
transcript of the hearings. The
35-volume transcript—totalling 4,200
pages—was finally completed Dec. 9.
Lengthy final briefs, the last
documents submitted to the Board,
received Dec. 17. Kennedy said
the Board spent much of its time since
then studying the "very meaty final

briefs."
He said the "parties put a hell of a
lot of work into those things" and the
Board "had to think about" major
differences in the legal standards urged
by the administration and Franklin.
(See article on final briefs, page 10.)
Mori fort said the Board met every
day after receiving the final briefs,
except for Christmas Day and New
Year's.
With Franklin's future still
undecided as the new quarter begins,
his supporters are attempting to arrange
a substitute version of his scheduled
winter quarter course. Venceremos
members handed out leaflets at

registration, urging students to sign up
for English 190, a four-unit "ad hoc
seminar."
The supporters explained the
seminar would fulfill requirements of
Franklin's "Literature and Revolution"
course. They said guest lecturers would
teach the course "until Franklin can
teach it himself."
English Department Chairman W.
Bliss Carnochan said that applications
for English 190 are available in the
English Department office. He
explained that department committees
would meet this week to consider the
applications for an "ad hoc" seminar
based on Franklin's course.
The Advisory Board has finally
reached a decision in the case of H.
Bruce Franklin—but the
recommendation will not be announced
until tomorrow or Thursday.
Board secretary Sally Monfort said
yesterday that it will take that long for
her to type the "fairly bulky
document" and for the Board to
complete some "very last-minute
revisions."
Board chairman Donald Kennedy
confirmed that the Board's decision has
been reached but said that "parts of It
are still being reworked so that they say
exactly what we mean."
The board was unable to complete
its deliberations before Christmas, the
latest failure to meet a series of
informal target dates for completion of
the case. The seven faculty judges did
manage to finish before Board member
David Hamburg left this weekend for
an African sabbatical.
