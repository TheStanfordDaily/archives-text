# New Judicial Rules Set
## 
### DAVID THIEMANN 
Two students have been notified by
Law Professor John Kaplan, Chairman
of the interim Campus Judicial Panel
(JP), of charges proferred against them
by the University administration.
Several others, including five persons
accused of participating in a Fall
quarter disruption at the Placement
Center, will be charged within the next
week, according to John Schwartz,
Assistant to the Provost.
The new judicial system has a
backlog of about 14 cases involving
approximately 20 defendants which are
"filed or about to be filed," Schwartz
said. The first judicial hearings will
convene in about two weeks.
The interim mechanism, which
replaces the now-defunct Stanford
Judicial Council, will be governed by
procedures promulgated by the
administration during mid-December.
The procedures are printed in their
entirety in a paid advertisement on
page four of today's Daily.
Schwartz, who represents the
University as prosecutor in judicial
hearings, "coordinated the drafting" of
the new rules, after consulting other
administrators and law school faculty
members and reading copies of rules
governing judicial organizations at
other universities.
The rules, which took effect
November 29, 1971, create a
seven-member student-faculty Campus
Judicial Panel to evaluate findings of
fact and recommendations submitted
by an outside hearing officer.
Hearing officers will be selected
from a panel of six Bay Area attorneys
chosen by a law school faculty
committee and appointed by President
Richard Lyman.
The CJP is composed of a Chairman
chosen by the President from the law
school faculty, who votes only in case
of a tie, three faculty members chosen
by the Committee on Committees of
the Faculty Senate, and three students
chosen at random. All seven for
one-year terms.
The student members are Charles
Stiver and Victor Vilaplana, both law
students, and Terrance Pape, a
sophomore. Two student alternates,
Thomas Bedford and Whitney Evans,
both freshmen, were also selected
randomly.
In most aspects, the procedures of
the new judiciary resemble those of the
SJC. The new system will adjudicate
cases in which a student charges that he
has been disciplined without his

consent and in violation of University
judicial procedures, cases pending
before the SJC on August 30, 1971,
and cases introduced by the
administration after that date.
The procedures do not contain any
provisions which allow the panel to
suspend without hearing anyone who
disrupts their hearings, or to suspend
witnesses who refuse to testify after
being offered immunity by the
University from campus judiciary
prosecution.
However, the University will, at its
discretion, continue to grant limited
immunity to defense witnesses who

refuse to testify on cross-examination
while pleading the Fifth Amendment,
according to Schwartz.
Kaplan said he will consider
organizing a panel of interested law
students to provide counsel for anyone
tried in the interim judicial system.
Schwartz said he may use law students
as prosecutors in some minor cases
(especially honor code violations).
According to the procedures the
administration must forward a
complaint to the CJP Chairman,
specifying "the act upon which charge
is based and the regulation allegedly
violated" by the end of the quarter
after the quarter in which the alleged
violation occurred. The Chairman must
then promptly mail a notice of the
charges to a defendant.
Proceedings before both the hearing

officer and the judicial panel are
presumed public unless the defendant
and Chairman agree to hold them in
private, or unless "the hearing officer,
in his discretion, deems it necessary to
exclude the public or otherwise restrict
attendance to maintain adequate

decorum." All hearings will be
tape-recorded.
A defendant may refuse to testify,
but if he does give testimony, he may
be examined by the prosecution on "all
matters relevant to the charges against
him," and on his credibility.
After receiving the hearing.officer's
report, the CJP will conduct a hearing
to determine whether the facts, as
found by the officer, constitute a
violation of the applicable University
regulation. Both parties may attend this
hearing and be represented by counsel.
Before recommending a punishment,
the CJP will consider "the nature and
seriousness of the offense, the
knowledge and intent of the student,
prior violations of University
regulations and prior violations of the
criminal law committed on campus,
and the likelihood, or lack thereof, of
similar misconduct by the student in
the future."
If a student has been punished by a
State or Federal Court for the offense
he is being tried in the campus judicial
system for, the CJP will recommend
only sanctions which are necessary to
"protect the persons, property, and
functions of the University."
