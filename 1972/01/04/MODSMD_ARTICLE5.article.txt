# Faculty Senate Adopts New Research Policy
## 
### PHIL REVZIN 
The Faculty Senate adopted, December 16, a statement of principles
concerning research, which states that "the individual scholar should be free to
select the subject matter of his research, to seek support from any source for his
work, and to form his own findings and conclusions."
The statement adds that the "findings and conclusions should be available for
scrutiny and criticism as required by the University's Policy Guidelines on Secrecy
in Research.
The Senate adopted the statement after extensive debate at several meetings.
The Senate had deliberated on two versions of the statement before adopting the
December Bth revision.
Professor Gerald Leiberman, Chairman of the Operations Research
Department, one of the developers of the statement, told the Daily that he was
"very pleased with the statement," and felt that "it adequately reflects the state
of research as it goes on in the University."
Pathology Professor Irving Weissman, who had introduced an alternate
statement to the one adopted, told the Daily that he felt the statement as adopted
allowed for no real challenges by the community to research that was being
conducted. Weissman added that he felt that any statement of policy on research
should be a detailed document addressing all related issues, and providing
explanations as to how the conclusions were arrived at.
Weissman added that he felt that Harvard's statement on principles on research,
a 16-page booklet, which Weissman placed before the Senate for background, was
more successful in providing such explanations.
The statement as adopted states that "research techniques should not violate
established professional ethics pertaining to the health, safety, privacy, and other
personal rights of human beings or to the infliction of injury or pain on animals.
"The University should foster an environment conducive to research. Where,
because of limited resources, the University cannot support all research demands,
it should allocate space, facilities, funds, and other resources for research
programs based on the scholarly and educational merits of the proposed research,
and not on speculations concerning the political or moral impropriety of the uses
which might be made of its results."
Both Lieberman and Weissman said that the statement reflected research as it is
presently being conducted, and would have little immediate effect on Stanford
researchers.
The statement concludes that the principles "in no way diminish, and indeed
they reinforce, the individual researcher's personal responsibility to assure that the
sources of funding for his research, and its perceived applications, are consistent
with his own judgment and conscience."
