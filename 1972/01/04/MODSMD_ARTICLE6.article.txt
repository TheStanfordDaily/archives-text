A controversial Constitutional
amendment, supported by
libertarians and isolationists two
decades ago, has recently received
renewed attention.
It is the so-called Bricker
Amendment, which provided that
"a provision of a treaty which
conflicts with (the U.S.)
Constitution shall not be of any
force or effect," that "a treaty
shall become effective as internal
law in the United States only
through legislation which would
be valid in the absence of treaty,"
and that "Congress shall have
power to regulate all executive
and other agreements with any
foreign power or international
organization." It also would have
placed all such executive
agreements in the same category
as treaties to the extent that the
executive agreements were
likewise not to violate the
Constitution.
The problem which the Bricker
Amendment was formulated to
solve exists in part because,

according to the Constitution,
treaties are fundamental law.
In the Decembe. 17 issue of
National Review, Stanford Law
School Professor John Kaplan
argues that "it has taken some 25
years for the government to prove
how right" Senator John W.
Bricker (R—Ohio) was in
proposing his amendment
designed "to prevent our foreign
agreements from overriding
American domestic law."
Kaplan tells in his "vindication
of John Bricker" how the Vienna
Protocol on Psychotropic Drugs (a
treaty already signed by the U.S.
Department of State and now
before the Senate for ratification)
turns over to the United Nations
control in the U.S. over drug.'
specifically named in the treaty
and others which the UN might
choose later to include according
to a vague standard of their ability
to produce "a state of dependence
and either central nervous system
stimulation or depression or
disturbances in thinking
perception or mood."
Kaplan sums this up by saying
a drug "could be placed under UN
control, if the UN authorities feel
it should be placed under control.
The concept of due process seems
to have no place in such a
decision."
The Vienna Protocol,
according to Kaplan would
hamper medical practice and
research, freeze the present
American drug law situation, and
has potential for placing coffee,
tobacco, alcohol, over-the-counter
medicines, and certain commonly
prescribed drugs (such as
amphetamines) under UN control.
In a recent debate with Sen.
John C. Stennis (D— Miss.), Sen.
J. W. Fulbright (D— Ark.) recalled

that he had opposed the Bricker
Amendment in 1954. (It failed at
that time by a one-vote margin to
achieve the necessary two-thirds
majority in the Senate.) Fulbright
then remarked that "it may
become appropriate for the
Senate to reconsider such a
mandatory means of enforcing its
authority."
Perhaps, the "new
isolationism.' that Nixon and
Agnew have been decrying has
some substance.

years moved in the direction of
ecnomic decentralization, while
President Nixon has decided to
try more central planning by the
state.
In the Washington Post of
October 10, 1971, the National
Taxpayers Union had a full page
advertisement relating the
historical experience with wage
and price controls in the Roman
Empire, during the Middle Ages,
and in Mussolini's Italy. The ad
called the controls "a new

exemption, the Wage and Price
Board decisions are like kisses.
They go by grace rather than by
right. An Administration which
seeks injuctions against the press,
which issues subpoenas
indiscriminately against reporters,
and which sends F. 8.1, agents
after annoying TV correspondents
ought not to be permitted the
power to grant or withhold price
and wage increases to the press
like kisses. I thnk the press, and
the rest of us, will regret Congress'
failure to enact the exemption."

The December 30 New York
Review of Books contains a
devastating critique of B. F.
Skinner's Beyond Freedom and
Dignity by Noam Chomsky. On
December 22, Christopher
Lehmann-Haupt, the regular daily
book-reviewer of the New York
Times called it a critique "that
crumbles the Harvard behaviorist's
best seller to its very foundations.
"Since this reviewer
(Lehmann-Haupt) claimed of
Skinner's book (on September 22)
that 'if you read only one book
this year, this is probably the one
you ought to choose,' it is only
fair that I append that judgment
now with the recommendation
that if you read only one critique
of Skinner's book this year, as
you most certainly should, then
Chomsky's is the one you ought
to choose."

Libertarian Left
Proof that the old,
anti-authoritarian New Left of the
mid-sixties is still alive can be
found in the birth and growing
strength of a new national
organization, the New American
Movement, which is similar in
some ways to the old S.D.S. The
NAM Statement (printed in the
January-February 1971 issue of
Socialist Revolution magazine)
contains some sharp criticism of
the present condition of the
radical movement, and, although I
disagree with most of its
programmatic proposals, the
contents of the document
unmistakeably display libertarian
tendencies. On December 15, the
Guardian (an independent
Marxist-Leninist newspaper)
suggested that NAM was
dangerously anarchistic.

Libertarian Left
Proof that the old,

mid-sixties is still alive can be
found in the birth and growing
strength of a new national
organization, the New American
Movement, which is similar in
some ways to the old S.D.S. The
NAM Statement (printed in the
January-February 1971 issue of
Socialist Revolution magazine)
contains some sharp criticism of
the present condition of the
radical movement, and, although I

programmatic proposals, the

unmistakeably display libertarian
tendencies. On December 15, the

dangerously anarchistic.


"Its quite simple...if devaluation works, a Republican
gets credit... if it fails, a Democrat is responsible!"
A controversial Constitutional
amendment, supported by
libertarians and isolationists two
decades ago, has recently received
renewed attention.
It is the so-called Bricker
Amendment, which provided that
"a provision of a treaty which
conflicts with (the U.S.)
Constitution shall not be of any
force or effect," that "a treaty
shall become effective as internal
law in the United States only
through legislation which would
be valid in the absence of treaty,"
and that "Congress shall have
power to regulate all executive
and other agreements with any
foreign power or international
organization." It also would have
placed all such executive
agreements in the same category
as treaties to the extent that the
executive agreements were
likewise not to violate the
Constitution.
The problem which the Bricker
Amendment was formulated to
solve exists in part because,

according to the Constitution,
treaties are fundamental law.
In the Decembe. 17 issue of
National Review, Stanford Law
School Professor John Kaplan
argues that "it has taken some 25
years for the government to prove
how right" Senator John W.
Bricker (R—Ohio) was in
proposing his amendment
designed "to prevent our foreign
agreements from overriding
American domestic law."
Kaplan tells in his "vindication
of John Bricker" how the Vienna
Protocol on Psychotropic Drugs (a
treaty already signed by the U.S.
Department of State and now
before the Senate for ratification)
turns over to the United Nations
control in the U.S. over drug.'
specifically named in the treaty
and others which the UN might
choose later to include according
to a vague standard of their ability
to produce "a state of dependence
and either central nervous system
stimulation or depression or
disturbances in thinking
perception or mood."
Kaplan sums this up by saying
a drug "could be placed under UN
control, if the UN authorities feel
it should be placed under control.
The concept of due process seems
to have no place in such a
decision."
The Vienna Protocol,
according to Kaplan would
hamper medical practice and
research, freeze the present
American drug law situation, and
has potential for placing coffee,
tobacco, alcohol, over-the-counter
medicines, and certain commonly
prescribed drugs (such as
amphetamines) under UN control.
In a recent debate with Sen.
John C. Stennis (D— Miss.), Sen.
J. W. Fulbright (D— Ark.) recalled

that he had opposed the Bricker
Amendment in 1954. (It failed at
that time by a one-vote margin to
achieve the necessary two-thirds
majority in the Senate.) Fulbright
then remarked that "it may
become appropriate for the
Senate to reconsider such a
mandatory means of enforcing its
authority."
Perhaps, the "new
isolationism.' that Nixon and
Agnew have been decrying has
some substance.

President Nixon has decided to

In the Washington Post of
October 10, 1971, the National
Taxpayers Union had a full page
advertisement relating the
historical experience with wage

Empire, during the Middle Ages,

called the controls "a new

They go by grace rather than by
right. An Administration which

which issues subpoenas
indiscriminately against reporters,
and which sends F. 8.1, agents
after annoying TV correspondents
ought not to be permitted the
power to grant or withhold price

The December 30 New York
Review of Books contains a
devastating critique of B. F.
Skinner's Beyond Freedom and
Dignity by Noam Chomsky. On
December 22, Christopher
Lehmann-Haupt, the regular daily
book-reviewer of the New York
Times called it a critique "that
crumbles the Harvard behaviorist's
best seller to its very foundations.
"Since this reviewer
(Lehmann-Haupt) claimed of
Skinner's book (on September 22)
that 'if you read only one book
this year, this is probably the one
you ought to choose,' it is only
fair that I append that judgment
now with the recommendation
that if you read only one critique
of Skinner's book this year, as
you most certainly should, then
Chomsky's is the one you ought
to choose."

Libertarian Left
Proof that the old,
anti-authoritarian New Left of the
mid-sixties is still alive can be
found in the birth and growing
strength of a new national
organization, the New American
Movement, which is similar in
some ways to the old S.D.S. The
NAM Statement (printed in the
January-February 1971 issue of
Socialist Revolution magazine)
contains some sharp criticism of
the present condition of the
radical movement, and, although I
disagree with most of its
programmatic proposals, the
contents of the document
unmistakeably display libertarian
tendencies. On December 15, the
Guardian (an independent
Marxist-Leninist newspaper)
suggested that NAM was
dangerously anarchistic.


"Its quite simple...if devaluation works, a Republican
gets credit... if it fails, a Democrat is responsible!"
A controversial Constitutional
amendment, supported by
libertarians and isolationists two
decades ago, has recently received
renewed attention.
It is the so-called Bricker
Amendment, which provided that
"a provision of a treaty which
conflicts with (the U.S.)
Constitution shall not be of any
force or effect," that "a treaty
shall become effective as internal
law in the United States only
through legislation which would
be valid in the absence of treaty,"
and that "Congress shall have
power to regulate all executive
and other agreements with any
foreign power or international
organization." It also would have
placed all such executive
agreements in the same category
as treaties to the extent that the
executive agreements were
likewise not to violate the
Constitution.
The problem which the Bricker
Amendment was formulated to
solve exists in part because,

according to the Constitution,
treaties are fundamental law.
In the Decembe. 17 issue of
National Review, Stanford Law
School Professor John Kaplan
argues that "it has taken some 25
years for the government to prove
how right" Senator John W.
Bricker (R—Ohio) was in
proposing his amendment
designed "to prevent our foreign
agreements from overriding
American domestic law."
Kaplan tells in his "vindication
of John Bricker" how the Vienna
Protocol on Psychotropic Drugs (a
treaty already signed by the U.S.
Department of State and now
before the Senate for ratification)
turns over to the United Nations
control in the U.S. over drug.'
specifically named in the treaty
and others which the UN might
choose later to include according
to a vague standard of their ability
to produce "a state of dependence
and either central nervous system
stimulation or depression or
disturbances in thinking
perception or mood."
Kaplan sums this up by saying
a drug "could be placed under UN
control, if the UN authorities feel
it should be placed under control.
The concept of due process seems
to have no place in such a
decision."
The Vienna Protocol,
according to Kaplan would
hamper medical practice and
research, freeze the present
American drug law situation, and
has potential for placing coffee,
tobacco, alcohol, over-the-counter
medicines, and certain commonly
prescribed drugs (such as
amphetamines) under UN control.
In a recent debate with Sen.
John C. Stennis (D— Miss.), Sen.
J. W. Fulbright (D— Ark.) recalled

that he had opposed the Bricker
Amendment in 1954. (It failed at
that time by a one-vote margin to
achieve the necessary two-thirds
majority in the Senate.) Fulbright
then remarked that "it may
become appropriate for the
Senate to reconsider such a
mandatory means of enforcing its
authority."
