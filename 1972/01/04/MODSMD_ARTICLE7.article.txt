# libertarian motives?
## TV Controls Explained

I write concerning the commentary by Mr. Dan
Brenner (Daily, November 24) which viewed with
alarm a proposal by Mr. Clay T. Whitehead, Director
of the Office of Telecommunications Policy, to
abandom case-by-case Federal oversight of mass
media content.
Mr. Brenner obviously likes detailed Federal
Government intervention in the content of
television and radio broadcasts. Presumably, he
would like the same for newspapers, which are even
scarcer than TV stations, and for the wire services.
But in opposing any lessening of the role of
government in mass media content, Mr. Brenner
need not resort to the attribution of base motives of
those with contrary views.
Is it not possible that Mr. Whitehead had
libertarian motives in mind in making his proposals?
Is it not a legitimate argument that the balance of
power between the freedom of speech and press and
the role of government has swung too far toward
government? Is it really true that there are no
dangers in detailed FCC intervention in questions of
content and access for the media? Is it necessary to
regard Mr. Whitehead's ideas as mere pats on the
broadcaster's balance sheet?
After all, Mr. Brenner does seem to agree with
the remainder of the proposals put forth by Mr.
Whitehead ( a statutory right of paid access and

deregulation of commercial radio). These proposals
are not inconsistent with changes in the fairness
doctrine.
Whatever value Mr. Brenner's opinions may have,
his facts do not bear up well. Mr. Brenner states that
the fairness doctrine is a "statutory provision" and
that it was "established by the Congress in 1934."
This is not true. Mr. Brenner has confused the
fairness doctrine, which is wholly an FCC invention
with the "equal time" provision (section 315) of the
Communications Act of 1934. The latter applies
only to candidates for political office. Mr.
Whitehead suggested no repeal of this provision.
What he did suggest was a return to the kind of
fairness doctrine we had in the 1950'5: an overall
obligation over the term of the license, an'i not one
which is interpreted on a case-by-case, issue-by-issue
basis.
In sum, there are perfectly respectable
philosophical objections to having the government
decide who shall speak and who shall not speak on
television. If these objections are not obvious to Mr.
Brenner, perhaps it is because he has ambitions to
become a government censor. If his arguments
prevail, there will be plenty of openings.
