# Calling Nixon's Bluff In Indochina
## 
### 
Once again the Nixon
administration has attempted to
fool its world allies and
particularly the American public
by using tactical cover-ups for
major strategic responses to a
growing military defeat in
Indochina. Phnom Penh is
surrounded by liberation forces.
In recent weeks, the Pathet
Lao have recaptured the Plaine
des Jarres, virtually secured
control of the Bolovens Plateau
and are posing a threat to the CIA
supported base at Long Cheng. In
South Vietnam, the National
Liberation Front has reduced
direct military attacks in exchange
for a noticable strengthening of its
political infrastructure.
High officials in Washington
have erroneously been assuming
since Kennedy took office in
1961 that North Vietnam is
somehow masterminding
resistance struggles in Cambodia,
Laos, and south Vietnam. These
officials presume that, with
sufficient initimidation, Hanoi can
and will call off liberation forces
elsewhere in Indochina. This
assumption clearly lies behind
recent drives by U.S. airpowerinto
the North. The bombing of
civilians and populated areas
underscores this intimidation
effort.
Yet Nixon surely must realize
that it won't work. Bombing has
never in the past significantly
halted liberation forces. This was
tacitly acknowledged by the
Johnson administration when
within a month of the initiation
of intensive bombing (begun in
March 1965) the administration
found it necessary fo be preparing
for massive increases in ground
troops. Two years later, the then
secretary of defense, Robert

McNamara admitted to the Senate
Armed Services Committee that
the air power operation had
failed.
Important indications suggest
that the recent five days of
intensive raids over the North
have again been militarily futile.
Air Force officials actually in
charge of the air strikes were
quoted by UPI on December 30 as
saying, "as far as we can tell, the
bombing was a real failure."
Because they had to fly high and
the bombing targets were clouded
over, it was "improbable they hit
much of anything."
But even though the raids were
likely of little avail militarily,
Nixon likely felt the air strikes
were importatnt to avoid the
appearance of American weakness
in Indochina, to prevent the image
of America as a "pitiful, helpless
giant." So in the wake of losing
six U.S. planes before the latest
raids started, Nixon deemed it
important to do something
dramatic that would give the
appearance of U.S. strength in
Indochina.
Nixon has claimed that he is
protecting American lives, since
taking out MlG's and anti-aircraft
sites will lessen the ability of the
North to defend the Trail,
increasing the safety of American
men in the South. Hopefully, this
logic will fool no one.
The increased use of MlG's,
and anti-air-craft sites in
particular, are defensive weapons
used against U.S. aircraft over
North Vietnam's own territory. In
addition, this is the first time that
the command in South Vietnam
has officially stated that supply
build-ups and air fields in the
North have been bombed.
In earlier raids the command

has admitted only to the bombing
of those sites which specifically
threaten American aircraft. Thus
the recent bombings, being far
more than defensive attacks, seem
to be an attempt by Nixon to get
people used to the idea that he
can bomb North Vietnam when
and wherever he chooses.
The bombings underscore the
bankruptcy of U.S. involvement
in the Paris Peace talks.
Increasingly the Paris talks have
been used by American
negotiators to create the
impression of the viability of U.S.
military presence in Indochina.
Chief negotiator, William
Porter, increasingly talks in terms
of U.S. military victory,
abandoning the more civil and
political terms of earlier American
propaganda, under Harriman and
Bruce. Porter has taken the line of
attempting to intimidate the
Provisional Revolutionary
Government and North Vietnam
into compromising Vietnamese
independence or else facing a
military defeat at the hands of the
American and Saigon troops.
The U.S. position of
supremacy in the world is
crumbling. The Nixon
administration is engaged in trying
to obscure that fact. This is
especially important to U.S. allies
outside Vietnam, given the
growing Allied concern for U.S.
military retrenchment around the
world.
It is also important when
Nixon's upcoming trip to China is
taken into account. Nixon must
be able to feel that he can go to
China, appearing as if he is still

the greater power in Indochina.
Nixon often talks in terms of
poker. The recent bombing of
North Vietnam is part of his bluff.
It is a desperate military attempt
to conceal lack of political
legitimacy for the U.S. position in
Indochina. It is an attempt by the
Nixon administration to fool the
U.S., Saigon and world opinion
into thinking that the U.S. in cold
military terms, is still "winning"
in Indochina.
