# Controversial Institution
## Hoover Evokes Passionate Reactions 
### GARY ATKINS First in a series 
Its windows have been smashed, its director has
been burned in effigy, its research has been
attacked, its confernces have been disrupted—such
has been the fate of Stanford's Hoover Institution
on War, Revolution and Peace over the past few
years.
What provokes people so much about Hoover?
For one thing, the Institution has never been able
to escape from a statement its founder made over a
decade ago—that one of its purposes is to combat
"the evils of the doctrines of Karl Marx." And even
though the statement was rejected as official policy,
some critics still say it symbolizes the "Hoover
Code" of one-sided research.
Additionally, the Institution has been criticized
as too autonomous and too separate from review by
Stanford's faculty. Hoover's director, critics have
said, wields too much power—and what is more,
they have said, he has used that power to turn
Hoover into a right-wing think tank.
The charges have been examined before—in both
1967 and 1969, the Daily ran series on Hoover's
development into a controversial research center.
In the last two years though, criticism of
Hoover has reached a new peak—students have
disrupted its last two conferences, trashed one of its
buildings and confronted its director on the steps of
Hoover Tower.
The inevitable question then is whether the
criticism is still building, whether it had or has any
basis, and whether steps have been taken to counter
it.
Different In The Past
The Institution, of course, has not always been as
controversial as it has been for the last few years.
When it was first founded in 1919, there was
very little criticism. Stanford's most famous

alumnus, Herbert Hoover, wanted to build a
collection of written material from World War I that
would preserve v\*iat he called the "fugitive
documents" of history—propaganda leaflets,
newspapers, government documents, and
periodicals. He turned to Stanford for help and gave
the University $50,000 to help start the collection.
He and his aides personally helped collect many
of the Institute's first documents by saving
every thing that was slipped under their hotel room
doors during the Paris Peace Conference.
Meanwhile, other "historical sleuths" connected
with the institute spread throughout Europe,
collecting books, pamphlets, newspapers,
documents—anything that might be helpful in
preserving the history of the war.
Similar procedures, though somewhat more
formalized, have been followed ever since, with
documents being acquired through purchase,
exchange and, in some cases, clandestine windfalls.
In 1946, for example, while Hoover was attending a
reception given by the Communist regime in Poland,
an ex-premier presented him with six bound
volumes "as a momento of your visit to Poland."
When Hoover looked at the volumes, he found rare
files of the Polish underground—files that the Polish
government itself had been seeking.
Other Hoover agents have discovered documents
every where from Berlin trashcans to Chinese food
markets.
Changing Relationship
During its early years, the library operated as
little more than another University
department—indeed, that was the way Stanford's
Board of Trustees defined its relationship to the
University in 1958.
Few books were published: the research staff was
small. One of its early directors has been quoted as
saying that the institute was thought of more as "a

kind of personal collection" rather than as "a
publishing enterprise."
By the late 19505, the Institution was having
financial problems. The total budget in 1959-60 was
under $400,000. Donations were dropping steadily
and more was being spent in maintaining Herbert
Hoover's own archives (over $47,000) than was
being spent for all research and publication
combined.
Vast Overhaul
By the end of 1959 however, the Hoover
Institution had begun to change. For at least the
next 12 years, the institute would explode with
activity. It has expanded its research and
publication budget more than 16-fold, and its total
budget for 1971 is $2,153,000—m0re than five
times greater than in 1959.
Additionally, the institute has become much
more visible as its emphasis shifted from being just a
"personal collection" to being a major research and
publishing operation.
Reversing the downward trend in donations, the
institute became a fundraiser's dream—it not only
met but broke its goals in fund-raising drives. It
built a new $2 million building without needing to
ask for Federal loans. It sponsored conferences
drawing big names in national and international
affairs.
As visibility and research increased though, so
did criticism. Hoover, its critics charged, was being
iued to support biased, unscholarly attacks on
everything to the left of what was said to be the
director's own conservative views.
What caused the change in the first place? One
name seems to answer the question—that of the
director, W. Glenn Campbell.
(Next: Campbell— the architect of a new
Institution.)

TOWER OF POWER—Hoover Tower looms impassively over longtime
controversies concerning Hoover Institution's relationship to the University and
the objectivity of Hoover's research.
