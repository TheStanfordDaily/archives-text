# New Galaxy Game
## 
### JERRY COLEMAN 
A mystery of minor magnitude
has caused thousands of Stanford
students to stare in starry-eyed
wonder at an ad in their
newspaper: "The Galaxy
Game—Try it and enter a new
universe of fun."
What is this galaxy game and
what unearthly power does it hold
over the students seen entering
the Tresidder Chess Room daily?
A front for an organization
plotting the takeover of the world
and the subjugation of the entire
human race? A new, kitchen-size
planetarium? no!
The galaxy game is a
sophisticated, computer-operated
machine. Two players sit in front
of a luminous screen depicting the
cosmos and operate their own
spacecraft by the use of control
sticks.
Warp Factor Nine
The object of the game is to
blow up the opposing rocket
before it blows up yours. Such
devices as bells and mechanical
bumpers commonly found in
simple pinball machines do not
exist here.
Rather, the game takes into
consideration such factors as
positive/negative gravitational
force, hyperspace speeds, and fuel
consumption.

According to Bill Pitts,
developer of the galaxy game and
a former Stanford graduate, "You
walk away from a pinball machine
frustrated having spent 50c.
People playing the galaxy game
(at 10c a shot or 3 plays for a
quarter) are satisfied."
He's right: all Wednesday's
afternoon players said they found
the game stimulating and
enjoyable. But another promise of
the game, voiced by Terry Meyer,
long-time friend of Pitts, that it
"helps relieve aggressive
tendencies" may not be so
accurate.
Effect on Tresidder
One graduate student left the
console after 10 minutes,
commenting, "It's fun but I'm
still repressed."
What effect has this new
addition had to the Student
Union? Tresidder Program
Advisor Jean Martin has the
answer: "Before, record lovers
came into the browsing room;
now science students are flocking
here.
"I hear them laughing in the
other room," says Martin, "and
it's nice. This is what a student
union should be."
Martin is quick to add, "These
rooms are not a morgue, but they
have seemed that way until now.

This game brought with it a new
life and vocabulary."
Founder Pitts is reluctant to
provide much information about
the game's actual operation or
construction cost."The only
jump I have over possible
competitiors is time," he says.
Future Plans
He would like to build 100
galaxy game consoles and then
stop. At that time he would
choose the locations for the games.
But why start here at Stanford,
and in Tresidder Union?
"Something this sophisticated
wouldn't go over in a bowling
alley without having some
previous exposure in the area."
Presumably, such exposure
could best be found among
intelligent, creative members of
the Stanford community.
Meyer speaks of future
applications for the galaxy game:
"Imagine a wall-size panel for a
screen: giant intra-mural
competitions."
If one gets tired of the space
orientation of the game, the
program can be changed to
football, hockey, baseball,
lacrosse. . . .
Why, the possibilities are as
endless as space!

rooms are not a morgue, but they
have seemed that way until now.

This game brought with it a new
life and vocabulary."
Founder Pitts is reluctant to
provide much information about
the game's actual operation or
construction cost."The only
jump I have over possible
competitiors is time," he says.
Future Plans
He would like to build 100
galaxy game consoles and then
stop. At that time he would
choose the locations for the games.
But why start here at Stanford,
and in Tresidder Union?
"Something this sophisticated
wouldn't go over in a bowling
alley without having some
previous exposure in the area."
Presumably, such exposure
could best be found among
intelligent, creative members of
the Stanford community.
Meyer speaks of future
applications for the galaxy game:
"Imagine a wall-size panel for a
screen: giant intra-mural
competitions."
If one gets tired of the space
orientation of the game, the
program can be changed to
football, hockey, baseball,
lacrosse. . . .
Why, the possibilities are as
endless as space!
A mystery of minor magnitude
has caused thousands of Stanford
students to stare in starry-eyed
wonder at an ad in their
newspaper: "The Galaxy
Game—Try it and enter a new
universe of fun."
What is this galaxy game and
what unearthly power does it hold
over the students seen entering
the Tresidder Chess Room daily?
A front for an organization
plotting the takeover of the world
and the subjugation of the entire
human race? A new, kitchen-size
planetarium? no!
The galaxy game is a
sophisticated, computer-operated
machine. Two players sit in front
of a luminous screen depicting the
cosmos and operate their own
spacecraft by the use of control
sticks.
Warp Factor Nine
The object of the game is to
blow up the opposing rocket
before it blows up yours. Such
devices as bells and mechanical
bumpers commonly found in
simple pinball machines do not
exist here.
Rather, the game takes into
consideration such factors as
positive/negative gravitational
force, hyperspace speeds, and fuel
consumption.

According to Bill Pitts,
developer of the galaxy game and
a former Stanford graduate, "You
walk away from a pinball machine
frustrated having spent 50c.
People playing the galaxy game
(at 10c a shot or 3 plays for a
quarter) are satisfied."
He's right: all Wednesday's
afternoon players said they found
the game stimulating and
enjoyable. But another promise of
the game, voiced by Terry Meyer,
long-time friend of Pitts, that it
"helps relieve aggressive
tendencies" may not be so
accurate.
Effect on Tresidder
One graduate student left the
console after 10 minutes,
commenting, "It's fun but I'm
still repressed."
What effect has this new
addition had to the Student
Union? Tresidder Program
Advisor Jean Martin has the
answer: "Before, record lovers
came into the browsing room;
now science students are flocking
here.
"I hear them laughing in the
other room," says Martin, "and
it's nice. This is what a student
union should be."
Martin is quick to add, "These
rooms are not a morgue, but they
have seemed that way until now.
