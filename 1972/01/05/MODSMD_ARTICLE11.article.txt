# Rhodes Grants Given
## 
### 
For the first time since 1962,
three Stanford undergraduates
have received Rhodes
scholarships, officials of the
Rhodes Scholarship Trust
announced last month.
The winners are Robert Haar,
an electrical engineering major
from St. Louis; Nicholas Spaeth, a
junior English major from
Bismarck, N.D.; and Timothy
Toohey, a senior history major
from Bozeman, Montana.
Peter Stansky, associate
professor of history and faculty
adviser for the Rhodes, Marshall
and Churchill scholarships, said
that all three have virtually
straight "A" averages during their
undergraduate years at Stanford.
Haar plans to read in
economics under engineering
tutors. He is a member of Tau
Beta Pi, national engineering
honor society. He hopes to go to
law school and spcialize in
communications law. (Tom
Cotton, honored with a Rhodes in
1964, was the last Stanford
engineering student to be

selected.)
Another future lawyer is
Nicholas Spaeth. An English
major, he plans to study English
literature at Oxford and then to
specialize in criminal law.
Spaeth spent Fall Quarter as an
assistant to Larry Horton in the
Dean of Students Office, where he
worked in the administration of
undergraduate housing and
student liaison. He is a student of
karate and a rugby player.
Oddly enough, Spaeth was the
resident assistant at Durand House
where Haar also resided. Neither
knew the other was applying for
the Rhodes scholarship. Both are
transfer from other colleges.
Toohey, a member of a
Montana ranching family, is in the
history honors program
specializing in German studies. He
has been active in environmental
and conservationist programs, and
he enjoys hiking and bicycling.
The appointment of the three
brings to 37 the number of
Rhodes scholars from Stanford
since World War Two.
