"Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits
V01'2," Hob Dylan — Columbia
KG3U2O
Note the title. It's "Bob
Dylan's Greatest Hits," not "The
Best of Bob Dylan." The shade of
difference is perhaps significant.
Among songs included on these
two discs are older, pre-"Nashville
ikyHne" album cuts like "My
3ack* Pages," "A Hard Rain's
ionna Fall," and "Don't Think
Pwice, It's All Right."
Also included are later album
cuts from "Self Portrait" like the
live versions of "She Belongs to
Me" and"The Mighty Quinn,"
'"Lay Lady Lay" from "Skyline"
ynd "If Not for You" from "New
Morning," and two singles never
before on an album, "Stuck Inside
of Mobile with the Memphis Blues

Again" and the Leon Russell
collaboration on "Watching the
River Flow."
But the real treat on this
record is the inclusion of four
never-before-released songs that
for the most part have been made
well-known bv others, like "I
Shall Be Released" and "You
Ain't Goin' Nowhere."
As I said, these arc for the
most part Dylan's greatest hits
although many of them were not
made hits by him. At a quick
glance, one can see songs made
famous by Peter, Paul and Mary,
Sonny and Cher, The Byrds, Rick
Nelson, Jimi Hendrix, Manfred
Mann, Leon Russell, George
Harrison, Olivia Newton-John,
Joan Baez, and The Band.
Brilliant Songwriting
Just this roster alone is enough

to attest to the man's sheer
brilliance as a songwriter. But too
often overlooked is his
performing ability. Just listen to
the grittiness of "It's All Over
Now, Baby Blue," or the stark
desolation of "A Hard Rain's
Gonna Fall."
And then, amazingly, he can
slip into that marvelous rock 'n'
roll-boggie voice on "Watching the
River Flow" or "Memphis Blues
Again," or the country-western
idiom on "Lay Lady Lay."
As far as the live performances
included from the Ise of Wight go,
Dylan is not represented at his
best. But that is only by
comparison to his fantastic "Mr.
Tambourine Man" on the Bangla
Desh concert lp.
Beyond that, "Greatest Hits
Vol. 2" is pure, essential Dylan. It
is not necessarily the best of
Dylan, as the absence of "Day of
the Locusts" suggests, but we can
rest assured that Dylan's greatest
hits are very great indeed.

"A Nod Is as Good as a
Wink... to a Blind Horse," —
Faces — Warner Brothers, BS
2574
Once upon a time, when we
were all young and naive so long
ago, there existed a group called
the Small Faces, which recorded
for a man named Andrew Loog
Oldham, who liked to be billed as
the "Brian Epstein of the Rolling
Stones." The group's leading light
was Steve Marriot, who authored
the group's biggest hit in 1967, an
incredibly cutsie-pie psuedo-drug
number called "Itchycoo Park."
Cut now to 1971-72. Gone is
Oldham, gone is Marriot, gone is
the name "Small Faces." Add a
couple of graduates from the Jeff
Beck school, mix well, and shake.
Out come the newly-refurbished
Faces, with vocalist extraordinaire
Rod Stewart fronting.
"A Nod" is the Faces' third
release since their transfiguration,
following "First Step" and "Long
Player." This record, however,
marks their first wide-spread
acceptance by listeners, basically
because of the success of lead
singer Stewart's solo "Every
Picture Tells a Story." What a
shame that this album doesn't
have more to offer.
Two Axes
As a group, Faces seems to
revolve around two axes. On the
one hand is Stewart and lead
guitarist Ron Wood; on the other,
bassist Ron Lane and keyboard
man lan McLagan. It's a shame
they're pulling in different

directions.
The three best cuts are all
Stewart-Wood oriented. "Stay
With Me," "Too Bad," and a
brilliant version of the
Chuck-Be rry-Lonnie-Mack-Johnny
Rivers hit "Memphis" all shine. Of
the three worst cuts, two are
written and sung by Lane, and are
particularly atrocious: "You're So
Rude" and "Last Orders Please."
The other really poor one is
Wood-Stewart's "That's All You
Need," which is a boring
anti-climax after "Too Bad."
Other material on the album is
in varying shades of mediocrity,
including one halfway palatable
Lane song, "Debris." Just about
everything is played with a sort of
breathless enthusiasm that is most
reminiscent of, but not as good as,
early Stones.
For some REAL Rod Stewart
music, pick up on "Every Picture
Tells a Story," or any of Stewart's
solos. As for "A Nod Is as Good
as a Wink," borrow a copy, tape
the three cuts, and then use the
disc for a frisbee.

Singles
Less powerful than they used
to be, but still a potent force in
determining an artist's popularity,
45 rpm records have just
concluded what must be termed a
dismal year in quality but a boom
in quantity.
The two largest San Francisco
top 40 stations spent the New
Year's weekend in counting down
with mock solemnity their ideas
of the top 100 songs of the year
just past, graphically illustrating
that singles still aim at the age
12-15 group. Where else but on
two top 40 stations, in this case
KFRC and KYA, can one have the
odd sensation of switching the
dial from "Chick-a-Boom" by
Daddy Dewdrop to "Yo-Yo" by
the Osmond Brothers?

Consensus on the number one
song varied from station to station
to trade publication. Among the
contenders for the dubious title
were Carole King's
halfway-palatable "It's Too Late,"
the Motown-produced "Smiling
Faces Sometimes" by the
Undisputed Truth, and, according
to at least one trade magazine,
George Harrison's "My Sweet
Lord," which bears an
uncomfortable resemblance to a
number one record of about 10
year's ago, "He's So Fine."
Little Quality
Quality songs in 1971 were few
and far between. Rod Stewart's
"Maggie May" was one. So was
Gordon Lightfoot's "If You
Could Read My Mind," Bob
Dylan's "George Jackson," The
Rolling Stones' "Brown Sugar,"
and a few others.
The Temptations had two good
ones in "Just My Imagination"
and "Superstar," but beyond
those and Marvin Gaye's "What's
Going On," "Mercy Mercy Me,"
and "Inner City Blues," it was a
year of big sell, little quality for
Motown.
What hurt most about 1971,
though, was probably the failure
of some of the biggest names to
come out with material
commensurate with their skills.
The Beatles individually proved
that the sum was greater than the
parts. Lennon showed his most
insipid side with two miserable
singles, "Power to the People"
and "Happy Christmas," to go
with the passable "Imagine."
Meanwhile, McCartney was
churnining out the nearest thing
to Muzak that rock can provide,
with "Another Day"and "Uncle
Albert/Admiral Halsey."
What happened to the giants
who auspiciously made their
comebacks in 1969 and 1370?
Fats Domino, Little Richard, and
even Elvis were noticebly quiet.

But hope springs eternal. As
this is being written, the number
one song in sales and top 40
airplay across the country is Don
McClean's brilliant "American

Pie," followed in many parts of
the country by Hod Stewart's "(1
Know) I'm Losing You."
Here's hoping the rest of 1972
will be as good.
