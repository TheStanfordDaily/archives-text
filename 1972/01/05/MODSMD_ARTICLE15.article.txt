# The 						Master Of Pantomime
## 
### DOUG ARTHUR 
For many, pantomime is synonymous with the name Marcel
Marceau. After viewing this famous mime's sensational repertory in
December at the San Francisco Opera House, I am inclined to agree..
Surely no other practicing mime can match Marceau's unique style
and artistic creativity.
American audiences, familiar with his style pantomime from his
many television appearances, may not be aware of his full-length
mimodramas such as "The Overcoat," by Gogol, which is a full scale
production. Last year, he created a ballet of "Candide" for the
Hamburg State Opera.
Which all goes to demonstrate the artist's experimental capability.
In this language of gesture, Marceau has a style which is somewhere
between dance and the theatre: it is theatre in the sense of the
interpretation of emotions and ideas. Illusion forms the basis of mime
as well as theatre.
The evening began with the familiar style pantomimes. Marceau in
each case suggests the world of the action by his gestures. What
appeared delightful was not the stylistic expertise, although this was
often stunning, but the little technical surprises in the performance.
Element of Sham
In "The Trial" for example, Marceau played four characters: two
judges, the prosecutor, and the defense attorney. There is an element
of sham in many of his characters, like one of the judges who appears
to follow both sides of the testimony, but who is really confused by
the lawyers. The scene pits the grandiloquent lawyer against the
agressive prosecutor, who wants the death penalty. The testimony
concludes. A pause. One judge turns around and by his arms and legs
moving, we see that he is the scale of justice.
"The Public Garden" gave Marceau a chance to display a great
variety of characters. He suggested everything from a statue to an old
woman with her knitting to a young boy with a ball. This scene truly
had everything in the garden, including one child who goes up with a
hydrogen balloon.

Much more experimental was the enactment of "The Dream." Here
the form appeared dissociative: fluid gestures flowed into each other.
Eerie music connoted the atmosphere of a dream, where form, and
existence itself, remains in a volatile state.
Mime-Within-Mime
You've heard of a play-within-the-play, but how about a
mime-within-the-mime? "The Mask Maker" is a perfect metaphor for
the art of pantomime, where facial expression denotes so much.
Marceau plays a mask maker who tries on his various masks. At one
point he changes from a somber-faced mask to a broad-smile mask,
faster and faster, until the smile won't come off. He struggles to be
free of the mask, and breaks into tears. It finally comes loose to reveal
a thankful expression.
Marceau originated the character of Bip in 1947. Bip is Marceau's
trademark, much as the Little Tramp was Chaplin's. Bip emerges in
many situations, and in many life-styles, but he is always universally
human with his misadventures and small victories. He can be
recognized by his white face, striped pullover, tight trousers, and his
beaten-up hat with a red flower.
Bip as the lion tamer found our character valiantly trying to
execute the circus stunts: he holds the hoop high in the air for the
lion to jump through, then lower, and lower stillâ€”at last the lion runs
under the hoop. Eager to prove his lion-taming ability, Bip begs,
threatens and cajoles the lions to do their tricks.
Clown On Ice
If the lion-tamer scene stressed Bip's physical prowess, "Bip as a
Skater" does just the reverse. Unable to even stand on his ice-skates,
the character pathetically watches the other skaters, and makes
periodic, futile attempts to skate. He is a clown on ice, but a sod one
at that.
"Bip at a Society Party" points up the affected elegance of the
character in trying to impress the other guests. It begins with Bip
dressing in his tuxedo, white gloves and hat. The problems start when
his gloves won't come off at the party. He proceeds through the
reception line meeting the guests, and through his facile expressions
and gestures we get some idea of each guest: for example, a tall man
with a short wife, another man who shakes his hand vigorously, and so
on.
Then the conversations commence. Bip listens to two guests on
either side of him: the one on the right is saying something very
serious; the guest on the right relates something very funny. In
looking from one to the other, Bip's expression resembles the masks
of comedy and tragedy. Bip eats dinner, overly conscious of his
manners; he then progresses to the bar, and finally must be helped to
the door to leave.
Marceau performed other sketches with Bip, including one of the
character in the future. If Marceau's fame and artistic experiments
with his form are any indication, Bip is sure to be around for a long
time.
