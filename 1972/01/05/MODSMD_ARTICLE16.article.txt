DURING AND AFTER—Randy Poltl, Stanford's outstanding sophomore strong safety, comes up from
the secondary to make an unassisted tackle on Billy Taylor, Michigan's leading rusher and most valuable
player of the 19 71 season. Poltl collected fourteen tackles Saturday and played by far his best game of the
season. Below, Daily photographers span the globe to bring you the drama of sport in the form of Don
Bunce and Jeff Siemon arriving in Honolulu for the Hula Bowl after playing big roles in Stanford's
dramatic Rose Bowl win the day before.
