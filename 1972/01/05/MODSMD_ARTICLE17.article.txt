## Cagers First In Classic 
### BILL CLASTER 
Coming off two terrible
performances against Santa Clara
and San Jose State, Stanford's
basketball team went on the road
and started to play somewhat
closer to its capabilities.
Against a Princeton team
which had just come off a victory
over fourth ranked North
Carolina, the Indians out-scored
the Tigers 23-5 in the last five
minutes, and barely lost 88-85.
The Tribe hit 60% of its shots
from the field in the second half,
and really seemed to play together
for the first time this season.
Claude Terry had 22 points and
David Frost added 18 to lead the
Indian scoring.
The Indians then faced the
unenviable task of playing a
Temple team which is virtually
unbeatable on its home court,
Philadelphia's famed Palestra.
Amazingly, the host Owls were
down by seven early in the second
half, and only a late cold spell by
the Tribe prevented Stanford
from notching its second win of
the season. Terry again led the
scoring with 21, and was backed
up by a fast-improving Steve
Shupe. Shupe added 16 points to

his usual hard rebounding and
tough defense.
The â€¢ much-improved Indian
cagers finally got rewarded for
their efforts in the Detroit Classic.
Neither first round opponent
Bowling Green or final opponent
Valparaiso proved to be much of a
challenge. The Indians were
clearly in control throughout both
games, and were able to earn their
first tournament title in a long
time with an 80-66 win over
Valparaiso.

Calude Terry led the scoring in
both games with 19 and 16 points
respectively. Frost, Shupe, Darrel
Fregia and Mike Mann all scored
well in the tournament as the
Indians upped their record to 3
and 5.
Stanford will host Washington
and Washington State this
weekend. The Tribe seems to have
jelled as of late, and it is likely
that they will not start the league
season with their almost
customary 0-2 mark.
