## Fatal Overconfidence 
### Charlie Hoffman 
Michigan's players and their
followers in Ann Arbor never even
considered the possibility that
they might lose to the thrice
beaten Stanford Indians on New
Year's Day.
This blind confidence
contnbuted greatly to the
Wolverines'downfall last Saturday
in that they mistakenly
underestimated their West Coast
opponents in several key areas.
Bo Schembechler's game plan
called for little more than simple
running plays that he assumed the
Thunder Chickens would not be
able to stop. The Wolverines ran
right at Pierre Perreault early in
the game, but the fine junior
proved not to be the weak link in
the line that Michigan was looking
for as he completed every
assignment in the first stages of
the contest.
Stanford's secondary had not
had much experience at handling
running attacks with the power of
the Big Ten champions, but led by
Randy Poltl's fourteen tackles,
the Indian defensive backfield
consistently turned back
Michigan's sweeps.
The Wolverines had counted on
the fact that their All-American

guard Reggie McKenzie would be
able to move Larry Butler out of
the way of their runners, but the
Indian lineman responded with
nine tackles, and the Michigan
attack moved away from his area.
The week before the Rose
Bowl, McKenzie commented that
the Wild Bunch from USC's 1969
Rose Bowl Champions was a
better line than the Thunder
Chickens, a sentiment that
understandably angered Mr.
Butler. After pushing his
All-American opponent around
the Rose Bowl, Butler felt that
McKenzie . .was pretty good,
mainly because he was so big. But
1 think that as far as
Ail-Americans go, he is overrated.
I am at least his equal."
By underestimating the
defensive prowess of Perreault and
Butler, and doubting the entire
Stanford secondary's ability to
contain the run, the Wolverines
severely damaged their chances
for victory. When Michigan did
not find the holes they assumed
would be there, they were trapped
because their game plan did not
offer any viable alternative. There
was no recourse and the

Wolverines were forced to try and
batter through the Indian defense.
Michigan's unswerving
confidence was reflected in the
signs that they proudly displayed
outside of their locker room
under the southern stands of the
Rose Bowl. "We've (lot The
Power To Win", "No One Can
Stop The Michigan Team", and
exclamations such as "This Is Our
Year" were typical offerings.
The Wolverines really did not
know what it was like to lose, and
when the end came, many players
were filled with disbelief before
the disappointment began to set
in. In defeat, the Michigan players
paid the expected and deserved
compliments to the Indians, but
they clung to the belief that
Stanford could not stymie them
again.
Considering the Stanford
victory a fluke, Frank Gusich,;
Michigan's Wolf backer, moaned,
"I'll tell you this, now I know
how tN Dallas Cowboys feel."
Michigan has a fine football team,
but until the Wolverines learn to
pro perl v assess the opposition's
strength and acquire the coaching
that will give them more!

flexibility as football players, they
can expect no other feeling than
that ot the Cowboys of previous
years.
