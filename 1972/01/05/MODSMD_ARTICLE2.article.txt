# Sullivan Influenced By China, Britain
## 
### PATTY FELS 
Professor Michael Sullivan is either a British
scholar with a deep love for Chinese art, or a
Chinese scholar with an English accent, and
sometimes it's hard to decide which.
The walls of his home are covered with Chinese
paintings, both ancient and modern, and the
bookcases are filled with Far Eastern masterpieces,
many in the original Chinese.
But, looking closer, one realized that the house is
the same sort of Chinese-British mixture. Among
the paintings is an Oriental block print of the tower
of London. And a volume of Keats seeems as much
at home as Ts'ao Hsueh-ch'in's The Dream of the
Red Chamber.
His colleagues call Sullivan "an excellent scholar
of international reputation" and "a brilliant
professor", but one of the first things they mention
is that he's British.
His students say that he's "interesting and
helpful" after they've dubbed him "the typical
English scholar, very charming and witty." As one
student reflected, "He makes you think that he
would take you out for a cup of tea and discuss a
little Chinese art."
Wins Fellowship
This year Sullivan was appointed to the Slade
professorship in fine art at Oxford. He will become
fellow and will give eight lectures on his specialty,
Chinese landscape painting. He and his wife plan to
spend winter quarter, 1974, in England.
Sullivan is the first person whose specialty is not
European art to receive the award since it began in
the 1870's.
"I had always hoped that someday I might get a
Slade professorship but never really counted on it."
he said. The first recipent was John Ruskin, a noted
Victorian art critic.
Most of Sullivan's students confess to not having
much interest in Chinese art before they took his
class. One freshman said, "I more or less stumbled

in because Renaissance Art was cancclled. I thought
Chinese art was what came out of the shops in
Chinatown. After only 50 minutes I knew that I
wanted to take the class."
Turned On
A sophmore who planned to take courses in
Western art got so "turned-on" by Sullivan that she
has taken four of his classes. She commented, "He
makes the class really stimulating by giving it a
personal touch. He acts excited about what he's
teaching. You know it's more than just a slide-- it's
his entire life. His work is very close to him."
The introductory course, according to one
student, is "like a history of China from an artist's
point of view." Each category of art, such as lacquer
work or bronze, is covered separately. The reading is
extensive. He avoids boredom by emphasizing
something different each year.
As he talks, he stares abstractedly at the back of
the room and has a habit of gesturing with his
glasses which he frequently takes on and off. His
lectures cover individual paintings but include
Chinese history and description. He characterizes
northern China as masculine, and southern China as
feminine. The Chinese countryside he describes as
"very delightful indeed with low rounded hills,
covered with mist."
When the art department was reorganized in
1963, the University made a search for distinguished
art scholars. After looking at Sullivan's bookstand
talking to experts in his field, Stanford invited him
to give a lecture and persuaded him to stay.
Dr. Lorenz Eitner, chairman of the Art
Department, noted. "At that time we had no
building and no books. When Michael came here
there was nothing for him to look at."
Oriental art historians are surprisingly rare.
Eitner said, "Excellent art historians number in the
hundreds globally. The recruitment of Michael
Sullivan was a matter of surveying the world market
on Orientalists and nicking the most renowned one

that we could find. In England there are only three
or four persons of Michael's caliber and most of
them are working in musems."
Sullivan's elementary education sounds like
something out of an English novel. He left home at
seven and attended a typical boarding school vhere
he played cricket and rugby and was "very
homesick during second term." He studied Latin for
eight years but whimsically recalls, "I could
translate Byron into Latin when I was 12 but had
forgotten it all by the time I was 16."
Harvard
After high school he studied architecture at
Cambridge. He worked with the International Red
Cross in China during and after World War II and it
was there that he first became interested in Chinese
art. Later he was on the staff of a musem in China.
He taught at the University of Singapore and
established a museum there. Sullivan recieved his
doctorate at Harvard and then at the University of
London in the School of Oriental Studies.
He left Britain in 1966 because he "was tired of
teaching only language students." England has been
slow in adding art history to its traditional college
curriculm. Sullivan feels that "the American
attitude toward art history is better." Far Eastern
art is ignored in Britain and neither of the major art
institutes in London even touch on it.
Describing his house one student said, "it's
amazing, It's like a museum." He has a special
interest in modern Chinese art and one of his
favorite works is a collection of unfinished sketches.
Another painting in his collection is on the back of
a pane of glass. The artist must not only paint the
entire thing backwards, but also has to draw the
features first, and then paint the skin over them. It
has an odd effect-almost like looking in a mirror.
At the moment Sullivan is writing a 33.000 word
essau on Chinese art for the 1973 Erxcyclopcdia
Brilannica.He is also working on volume two of his

already published book. The Birth of Landscape
Painting which begins with the very earliest
examples of Chinese landscaping, including paintings
on recovered jars. His new book, Meeting of Eastern
and Western Art, is at the publisher's.
Sullivan calls his wife his "research assistant"
since she both types his manuscript and investigates
new material. The two of them also enjoy
archaeology and display their discoveries proudly on
a 16th century Italian spice cabinet.
Becoming an Oxford fellow, living in England,
giving exactly eight lectures at the tradition-steeped
college all of it sounds very British, But this year
Sullivan and his wife will travel to the Far East.
And, naturally, the place they most want to visit is
mainland China.
