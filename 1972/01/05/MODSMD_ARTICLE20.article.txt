Xmas Bombs Discovered
TEL AVIV — Police have discovered bombs in a
dozen Christmas packages mailed from Europe and
addressed to prominent Israelis, and Israeli officials
said yesterday that they may mark the start of a
new Arab campaign of sabotage.
Two of the bombs have exploded, injuring two
policemen. The gaily wrapped packages were
discovered in postal searches.
A police bomb disposal expert was seriously hurt
as he dismantled a package addressed to a senior
police officer. Another terror-bomb parcel exploded
Sunday in Tel Aviv police headquarters, wounding
an inspector.
Others were mailed to a Defense Ministry
factory; government offices; former air force chief
and political leader Ezer Weizman; the Atomic
Energy Commission chairman; and the director of
Jerusalem's Ministry of Police.
The packages were mailed around Christmas Eve
from Austria and Yugoslavia, police said.
The Christmas bombs were disguised to look like
boxes of chocolates, books, desk diaries and
calendars, police said.
Muskie Joins Crowd
KENNEBUNK BEACH, Maine - Sen. Edmund S.
Muskie performed the rite of presidential candidacy
last night, declaring in a nationally televised speech
that he seeks the White House to lead Americans in
"A New Beginning."
He said President Nixon's administration has
failed the nation in the past and "cannot take us to
the future."
The front-running contender for the Democratic
presidential nomination paid $30,000 to formally
announce the obvious on prime-time television.
"I have come home to Maine to announce my
decision to seek the office of president of the
United States,'* Muskie said in a statement taped
Monday at his summer home.
Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota, the
Democratic nominee in 1908, when Muskie ran for
vice president, plans to announce his new bid for
the nomination in Philadelphia next Monday.
Sen. George McGovern of South Dakota was in
New Hampshire yesterday, filing petitions to put his
name on the ballot in the March 7 leadoff
presidential primary.
Sen. Henry M. Jackson of Washington was in
Florida, where the second presidential primary will
be held March 14, seeking voters at shopping
centers, courthouses and factories in the rural,
conservative northern section.
Former Sen. Eugene J. McCarthy of Minnesota
entered the Illinois presidential primary Monday

with a challenge to the state's requirement that
candidates sign a loyalty oath disavowing
communism or any other movement advocating
forcible overthrow of the government.
McCarthy said he considers the oath defective,
inapplicable to a presidential primary and
unconstitutional.
Also on the list of entries for the 1972
Democratic nomination are Mayor John V. Lindsay
of New York, Mayor Sam Yorty of Los Angeles,
Sen. Vance Hartke of Indiana, and Rep. Shirley
Chisholm of New York.
President Nixon's name has been filed for the
ballot in the New Hamphsire primary, and Reps.
Paul N. McCloskey of California and John M.
Ashbrook of Ohio are challenging him.
Peace Corps Cutback
WASHINGTON - The money-short Peace Corps
began shaping plans yesterday to reduce its
8,000-member volunteer force by half and to cancel
programs in as many as 15 countries.
Joseph H. Blatchford, director of the ACTION
agency which oversees the Peace Corps, ordered a
halt in signing up volunteers, at least until July 1,
although applications will continue to be accepted.
Blatchford instructed Kevin O'Donnell, associate
director of ACTION for international affairs, to
prepare plans for termination of about 4,000
volunteers now on duty in 55 foreign countries.
Blatchford wants the plans implemented by
mid-February so the volunteers can be returned to
the United States by the end of March.
There now are about 7,100 volunteers on active
assignments overseas and some 800 to 900 in
training, most of them in host countries.
The present corps force is slightly more than half
of what it was during the peak years of the middle
19605.
Blatchford took Tuesday's action, it is
understood, because Congress not only refused to
appropriate the $82 million requested by the Nixon
administration but cut funds to a level that one
agency source described as "just one step above
putting us out of business altogether."
Churches Reap From War
NEW YORK — American churches, among the chief
critics of the war in Vietnam, are reaping big profits
from it, a study reports.
It said they have not matched their expression of
moral concerns with their investment policies, but
instead have put themselves "in a position of
complicity."
The study found that 10 major protestant

denominations, making up about a fourth of U.S.
church membership, have investments of $203
million in prime military contractors.
This is only a "small portion" of the total, the
report said yesterday but illustrates "the direct
involvement of the churches in the continuing war"
and their financial benefits from it, despite their
criticisms of it.
Earnings for the church investments listed
totalled $6.2 million in 1970, a relatively bad year
for profits, the report said.
The study was made by the Corporate
Information Center, a newly set up research agency
of the National Council of Churches, to gather data
to help churches in their growing effort to apply
moral criteria in choosing investments.
Pat Gets Show
MONROVIA, Liberia — Pat Nixon, sporting native
dress with bouffant head scarf, tapped her foot to
tribal drums Tuesday as she watched dancing girls
with painted bodies and bare breasts.
It was a sharp switch from the American-style
festivities that have marked much of the inaugural
celebration for President William Tolbert, which
included Billy Graham and the Grambling College
Band from Louisiana.
About 150 men, women and children from all
the nation's tribes provided the show at the
executive mansion on the final day of the U.S. first
lady's three-day visit to the West African republic.
The American band members, sweltering in
heavy uniforms in scorching sun, paraded before the
reviewing stand with the U.S. flag, and high-stepped
a blaring sendoff as Tolbert and Mrs. Nixon were
leaving.
