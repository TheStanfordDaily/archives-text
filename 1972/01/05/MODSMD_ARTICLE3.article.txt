# Ellsberg To Speak Friday
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Dr. Daniel Ellsberg, currently under
indictment by a Los Angeles Federal
Grand Jury on charges stemming from
the release of the Pentagon papers, will
speak Friday evening at 8:30 p.m. in
Memorial Church.
Appearing with Ellsberg will be
co-defendant Anthony J. Russo and
Russo's fiancee, Stanford activist
Katherine Barkley.
Ellsberg's appearance will kick off
"Meet the Defense Department
Week," a series of activities sponsored
by the Faculty Political Action Group
and several other groups.
Ellsberg, Russo, and Barkley will
speak on "The Pentagon, The War, and
The University." A $1 donation will
be requested at the door, with
proceeds to go to the Ellsberg Defense
Fund.
Ellsberg and Russo, both former
employees of the Rand Corporation,
have been named in a 15-count
indictment, charged with stealing the
47-volume secret history of the
Vietnam War and distributing the
material to the press.
Ellsberg yesterday entered a plea of
not guilty to the charge that he stole,
kept, and distributed the Pentagon
papers despite the fact that he has
already publicly admitted his role in

the controversy. His attorneys said
that they would challenge the legality
of the indictment with which he is
charged.
Russo refused to enter a plea
yesterday on similar grounds, but a
Los Angeles Federal District Judge
entered a plea of not guilty for him.
Former United States Senator
Charles E. Goodell (R.-N.Y.), seeking
to be named co-counsel for Ellsberg,
stated that the government must prove
that leakage of the Pentagon papers
was "injurious to the United States."
"These tw> men stand in defense of
themselves, and stand for much larger
issues," declared Goodell.
On Saturday, Stanley Scheimbaum,
former chief of the Michigan State
University Project in Vietnam from
1957 to 1959, will appear as part of
the week's activities downstairs in
Tresidder Union in an informal session
at 12 p.m. before delivering a lecture
upstairs at 1 p.m. on the early stages

of the war.
Also on Saturday, at 2 p.m., the
Association of Young Crows have
announced they will either stage a
parade through the Stanford Industrial
Park or present a slide show on the
park, depending on the weather.
On Monday, Department of
Defense recruiters are due at the
Graduate School of Business. The
Young Crows last night sent off a
telegram to Washington inviting the
DoD recruiters to appear at a 12:45
p.m. rally outside the Business School.
According to Lee Herzenberg, the
Faculty Political Action Group, which
is organizing the Ellsberg appearance
and other activities during the week, is
a "loose coalition" of faculty
concerned with anti-war movement.
In addition to the faculty group,
the Stanford Community Women for
Peace are planning to picket the
Business School during the Defense
recruiters' stay.
