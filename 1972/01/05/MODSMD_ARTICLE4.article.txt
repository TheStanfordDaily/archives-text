# Enrollment In Science Shows Vast Increase
## 
### JAMES E. LOBSENZ 
Course enrollment trends over the
last three academic years indicate that
the humanities are losing students to
the sciences and the social sciences.
Dean of Humanities and Sciences
Albert H. Hastorf attributes this trend
to be a result of "a new attitude in
regard to science." Previously,
students were inclined to scorn science
as the force that has created many of
the problems of modern society. Now
the feeling prevails that science is
important, and an understanding of
science is necessary to begin solving
some of today's problems.
Hastorf calls this attitude "pretty
darn healthy," and points out that this
trend of increasing interest in the
sciences is by no means a local
phenomenon. A nationwide increase in
pre-med and pre-law students is a main
source of increasing enrollment, in
science and social science courses.
Over the la. c t three years largo
inrronsps in enrollment in I lie

following departments have occurred:
biology (+l6 percent), chemistry (+6l
percent) and psychology (+5O
percent). lesser increases have
appeared in political science and math
courses and significant decreases have
occurred in economics (-30.5 percent),
English (-16 percent), and history (-36
percent).
Tendencies Reflected
Most of these general tendencies are
reflected in the enrollment in
introductory courses in these
departments. Chemistry 1, for
example, has almost doubled its
enrollment in the last three years.
Introductory Philosophy has suffered
a severe drop and Broadcast
Communications has gained
tremendously. However, several other
course enrollments contradict
department trends.
Shifts in undergraduate majors
support the increasing science
enrollment trend, with some variation.
