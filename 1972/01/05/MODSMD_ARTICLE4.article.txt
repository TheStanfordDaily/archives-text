# Enrollment In Science Shows Vast Increase
## 
### JAMES E. LOBSENZ 
Course enrollment trends over the
last three academic years indicate that
the humanities are losing students to
the sciences and the social sciences.
Dean of Humanities and Sciences
Albert H. Hastorf attributes this trend
to be a result of "a new attitude in
regard to science." Previously,
students were inclined to scorn science
as the force that has created many of
the problems of modern society. Now
the feeling prevails that science is
important, and an understanding of
science is necessary to begin solving
some of today's problems.
Hastorf calls this attitude "pretty
darn healthy," and points out that this
trend of increasing interest in the
sciences is by no means a local
phenomenon. A nationwide increase in
pre-med and pre-law students is a main
source of increasing enrollment, in
science and social science courses.
Over the la. c t three years largo
inrronsps in enrollment in I lie

following departments have occurred:
biology (+l6 percent), chemistry (+6l
percent) and psychology (+5O
percent). lesser increases have
appeared in political science and math
courses and significant decreases have
occurred in economics (-30.5 percent),
English (-16 percent), and history (-36
percent).
Tendencies Reflected
Most of these general tendencies are
reflected in the enrollment in
introductory courses in these
departments. Chemistry 1, for
example, has almost doubled its
enrollment in the last three years.
Introductory Philosophy has suffered
a severe drop and Broadcast
Communications has gained
tremendously. However, several other
course enrollments contradict
department trends.
Shifts in undergraduate majors
support the increasing science
enrollment trend, with some variation.
While the six most popular majors are
psychology, history, English, biology,
human biology and political science,
both English and history have been hit
with a 13 percent reduction in the
number of majors since the fall of
1969.
Human biology, in its third active
year, has skyrocketed into a leading
position with a 158 percent increase in
the last year. In spite of this fierce
"competition" the biology department
has enjoyed a 24 percent increase in
majors too.
Other Changes
Other significant changes in major
distribution over the last three years
include chemistry, up 24 percent;
communications, up 26 percent;
music, up 104 percent; and art, up 86
percent. At the same time the
following majors have decreased
enrollments: physics, 23 percent;
math, 21 percent; sociology, 15
percent; and philosophy, 36 percent.
The enrollment in language courses
and the number of language majors has
remained remarkably constant, despite
the abolishment of the language
requirement. Chinese and Japanese
have shown a slight increase however.
An examiniation of the percent

change over the past three years in the
total number of fall course
enrollments in the sciences, social
sciences and humanities demonstrates
the basic trend at Stanford.
Balances
Increases of 20.9 percent in
enrollment in science courses almost
balance the decrease of 20.5 percent in
humanities courses. Social sciences
courses have shown an increase of 13.7
percent in student enrollment.
The breakdown of majors by sex
reveals that most departments are
moving slowly towards ? major
distribution between the sexes that
parallels the actual male-female ratio
of undergraduates of slightly less than
2 to 1. The predominately male majors
include chemistry, physics, statistics,
economics, political science and
philosophy.
The latter, with an 88 percent male
enrollment, leads the university in the
fewest females enrolled. Majors with
more females include music, art,
Spanish and Portuguese, German,
French and Italian, classics and
anthropology. French and Italian and
Spanish and Portuguese tie for first in
this category, with a 3 to 1 ratio in
favor of females.
