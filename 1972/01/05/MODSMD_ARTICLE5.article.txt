# liberal, radical constraints
## DOD Work Defended 
### 
IBE martin e. hellman

I am quite troubled about the
atmosphere concerning freedom
of thought and inquiry at
Stanford. What troubles me most
is that, the pressure against these
freedoms appears to be coming
from those who, outwardly, are
most concerned about supposed
shackled on their freedom
(imposed by the government,
University, etc.).
I have come to the conclusion
that the constraints put on our
thoughts and actions by the
"establishment" are miniscule
compared to the constraints
imposed by the liberal and radical
(for lack of a better word)
establishments on the campuses.
Consider the recent "Red Hot
Professor" awards. As mentioned
in the, Daily (November 18, 1971)
almost all the professors so
awarded defended their work on
the basis of its applicability to
peaceful uses and its small or
non-existent applicability to
military uses. While on the faculty
at M.LT. during the last two years
1 was* shocked by a similar need
for a' pledge of allegiance to the
peace*movement before speaking.
When discussing whether
M.I.T. should be closed October
15th '.(1969), many felt it was
wrong for the school to close (and
thereby make a moral decision for
all its constituents), yet they felt
constrained to start with a
comment like "I'm against the
war, as all of you know, but. . . .".
Twenty years ago I understand
people started their talks with
"I'm not a Communist, but. . . "
whenever they disagreed with the
McCarthy hearings, or similar.
I think we all would be
disgusted by a society which
required such a pledge, with the
penalty being ostracism or
physical harm. Yet our society on
campus seems to foster such a
culture. When unpopular views
cannot be heard because the
speaker is booed down; when
people who meet during a
"strike" are threatened with
physical harm; and when most of
us, if not directly involved, at
least condone such action, then I
question our genuineness of

concern for freedom of thought.
What do you do
Many of you will be shocked
by these accusations. Your
response will be "talk with me—l'll
listen." And, on an individual
basis, I feel this is true. Rather,
think of yourself in a group
listening to someone defend
military support of research, or,
God forbid, defending this
country's position in world
affairs. Someone starts booing.
Then someone else. What do you
do?
Finally, let me discuss military
research on campus. Believe it or
not, it is true that most of the
work has little or no immediate
application to the military. (Even
1 feel it necessary to start with a
mild disclaimer). Rather, it is
always possible to twist any work
and make it sould like the
ultimate weapon.
Consider, for example, a huge
defense project designed to whisk
troops about the country in time
of war or rebellion. (!!) This
technological advance is costing
billions on billions of dollars and
is being carried forth with little or
no regard for the ecological
consequences (although recently,
concerned environmental groups
have been able to block portions
of the work through legal action).
The government is pressing the
project to rapid completion.
Worthwhile Goals
Clearly we should all stop the
Defense Interstate Highway
system--yes, even that was
legislated in the name of
defense—l agree it is sad that such
clearly civilian-oriented ventures
must be done in the name of
defense. But if it is only through
the Defense Department (or in its
name) that we can achieve
worthwhile goals, should we not
achieve them at all? (I realize many
question the value of the
interstate highway system. If so,
try questioning it on your next
long trip. This is not to say that it
doesn't have faults.)
Thus, much of the criticism
against military support of
research is really not well
founded. But what if I was a
researcher become interested in a
project in which the military does
see applications? Must I, to
appease the anti-military attitudes
of the campus establishment,
forego this research? What if the
NSF funds it (or I do it on my
own time)? Would I be a war
criminal because it contributes to
the military strength of the
country? Perhaps I would be but
then aren't any of us who produce
any goods, used at all by the
military, also war criminals?
Clearly there is a question of
degree.
I know that there are points
that can be questioned in my
analysis. Indeed, I am not at all
sure that I agree with all I have
just written. But that is an
important admission, one that

more of us should make. Only
through meaningful
communications between minds
of differing views, but open to
reason, can we hope to achieve a
better world. What say, let's try?

P.S. To save you the time of
investigating my support: I am
currently partially supported
under the Tri-Services Electronics
program, and am doing basic
research on the connection
between information theory and
computation.
