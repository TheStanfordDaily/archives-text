Venceremos Democracy
Editor, THE DAILY:
While better than past Daily attempts to
characterize Venceremos. Kevin Smith's
article presented a superficial—and
misleading—view of the organization. I
would like to point out what I consider its
two major defects.
1.) By devoting the largest part of his
article to the two splits that have occurred
in our ranks in the last four years, while
not saying anything at all
about Venceremos' contribution to
leadership in the Stanford movement, he
showed that he was ignorant of how
Venceremos has grown larger and stronger
through the very struggles which led to
those splits. Our strength on campus has
increased dramatically since the departure
of the people now in the "Intercommunal
Survival Committee"; and the
anti-imperialist movement is off to a
running start this year with a well
organized coalition of the left including
just about everbody except the "ISC."
2.) The most misleading part of Kevin
Smith's article was the title: "Venceremos
Stresses Centralism." Here also Mr. Smith
presented only one half of the dialectic. We
know from our practice in Venceremos
that the organization has a far greater
chance of making correct decisions than
any of its individual members . . . but only
when everyone's experience is taken into
consideration and when the organization
functions as a whole.
Consequently, the Central Committee
(made up of the most experienced and
politically advanced members of
Venceremos) never makes a political or
tactical decision without making an
investigation throughout the organization
to sum up relevant practice first.
The only way to tell if their decision is
correct is to put it into practice. The

quickest and most efficient way is for a lot
of people working in different areas and
under different conditions to implement it
at the same time and then to sum up the
results; and that's the way Venceremos
does it. If the practice of the organization
suggests that a decision is wrong, the
Central Committee reconsiders it in the
light of this practice.
Basic decisions concerning the political
line of the organization are never just
handed down from the top, not even after
investigating the relevant practise of the
organization. Instead, all collectives discuss
it until they reach unity. The results are
conveyed to the Central Committee, which
struggles with the various positions which
have come up until they reach unity. The
Central Committee decision is then taken
back to the collectives, and only then do
"the Committee's followers [sic. ]
implement its decision immediately and
manditorily."
To focus almost exclusively on the last
step of this process makes Venceremos
look like some Hoover Institute nightmare
of a mindless bunch of True Believers
mechanically spouting the party line.

Apart from the President, the
Department of Defense bears chief
responsibility for the tragedy of Vietnam:
for destroying more than a million lives,
for laying waste more than five million
acres of land, for ruining the very fabric of
national life for 17 million people. Not
content with this carnage, the Department
of Defense is currently savaging Laos,
North Vietnam, and Cambodia with

massive and relentless bombing strikes.
Because of its operations, the number of
homeless, crippled, tormented and dead
continues to mount in Indochina.
The Department of Defense is in effect
the "contract killer" for the
Administration. Using the most ingenious
weapons modern technology can devise
(for example, the new anti-personnel bomb
which shoots out 192,000 bullets at a time,
used in the Christmas week bombing of
North Vietnam; or the tiny "dragon's
tooth," which weighs about 20 grams,
comes wrapped in a cloth bag that looks
like a first-aid kit—and explodes as soon as
it's touched), it has swept infants and old
people, men and women, into the flames of
war. Its flagrant and continuing violations
of the Nuremberg Principles of 1946 and
the Geneva Convention of 1949 rank the
Department as the most ruthless criminal
organization in the world today.
Representatives of the Department of
Defense will be at the Stanford Business
School on Monday, January 10, to recruit
new professional employees from among
next year's graduates. Stanford
Community Women for Peace will conduct
a peaceful picket outside the Business
School to protest the activities of the
Department of Defense and the fact that it
is welcome to use the facilities of the
Stanford campus.
We hope others will join us.

It is impressive the way a small minority
of non-students is ushering in a new era of

"in loco parentis". 1 thought the student
body voted that out by referendum several
years ago. Josephson, Shock, Siegel, and
other non-students should heed the desire
of students to sever their parents'
dominion.
The Placement Service is just what it
says—a service. Like the Counseling
Service, Food Service, and others, only
those students who desire need use
them—and this may not necessarily be a
majority of the student body. Denying a
student free access to employment
opportunities is an abridgement of his right
to choose what work he wants to do ana
for whom he wants to work.

Assistant Dean Kirkland of the
Engineering School recently accused me of
the big lie technique, for my suggestion
that Kirkland was a candidate for Dean. I
would like to apologize to Mr. Kirkland. I
was wrong.
I have since talked to many students
and faculty within the Engineering School,
and I have learned that there is little
likelihood that Mr. Kirkland will even be
elected to Associate Dean.
I have also learned that the Engineering

Smith's article was the title: "Venceremos
Stresses Centralism." Here also Mr. Smith
presented only one half of the dialectic. We
know from our practice in Venceremos
that the organization has a far greater
chance of making correct decisions than
any of its individual members . . . but only
when everyone's experience is taken into
consideration and when the organization
functions as a whole.
Consequently, the Central Committee
(made up of the most experienced and
politically advanced members of
Venceremos) never makes a political or
tactical decision without making an
investigation throughout the organization
to sum up relevant practice first.
The only way to tell if their decision is
correct is to put it into practice. The

quickest and most efficient way is for a lot
of people working in different areas and
under different conditions to implement it
at the same time and then to sum up the
results; and that's the way Venceremos
does it. If the practice of the organization
suggests that a decision is wrong, the
Central Committee reconsiders it in the
light of this practice.
Basic decisions concerning the political
line of the organization are never just
handed down from the top, not even after
investigating the relevant practise of the
organization. Instead, all collectives discuss
it until they reach unity. The results are
conveyed to the Central Committee, which
struggles with the various positions which
have come up until they reach unity. The
Central Committee decision is then taken
back to the collectives, and only then do
"the Committee's followers [sic. ]
implement its decision immediately and
manditorily."
To focus almost exclusively on the last
step of this process makes Venceremos
look like some Hoover Institute nightmare
of a mindless bunch of True Believers
mechanically spouting the party line.

North Vietnam, and Cambodia with

massive and relentless bombing strikes.
Because of its operations, the number of

While better than past Daily attempts to

in our ranks in the last four years, while
not saying anything at all
about Venceremos' contribution to
leadership in the Stanford movement, he
showed that he was ignorant of how
Venceremos has grown larger and stronger
through the very struggles which led to
those splits. Our strength on campus has
increased dramatically since the departure
of the people now in the "Intercommunal

just about everbody except the "ISC."

does it. If the practice of the organization
suggests that a decision is wrong, the
Central Committee reconsiders it in the
light of this practice.
Basic decisions concerning the political
line of the organization are never just
handed down from the top, not even after
investigating the relevant practise of the
organization. Instead, all collectives discuss
it until they reach unity. The results are
conveyed to the Central Committee, which
struggles with the various positions which
have come up until they reach unity. The
Central Committee decision is then taken
back to the collectives, and only then do
"the Committee's followers [sic. ]
implement its decision immediately and
manditorily."
To focus almost exclusively on the last
step of this process makes Venceremos
look like some Hoover Institute nightmare
of a mindless bunch of True Believers
mechanically spouting the party line.

Apart from the President, the
Department of Defense bears chief
responsibility for the tragedy of Vietnam:
for destroying more than a million lives,
for laying waste more than five million
acres of land, for ruining the very fabric of
national life for 17 million people. Not
content with this carnage, the Department
of Defense is currently savaging Laos,
North Vietnam, and Cambodia with

massive and relentless bombing strikes.
Because of its operations, the number of
homeless, crippled, tormented and dead
continues to mount in Indochina.
The Department of Defense is in effect
the "contract killer" for the
Administration. Using the most ingenious
weapons modern technology can devise
(for example, the new anti-personnel bomb
which shoots out 192,000 bullets at a time,
used in the Christmas week bombing of
North Vietnam; or the tiny "dragon's
tooth," which weighs about 20 grams,
comes wrapped in a cloth bag that looks
like a first-aid kit—and explodes as soon as
it's touched), it has swept infants and old
people, men and women, into the flames of
war. Its flagrant and continuing violations
of the Nuremberg Principles of 1946 and
the Geneva Convention of 1949 rank the
Department as the most ruthless criminal
organization in the world today.
Representatives of the Department of
Defense will be at the Stanford Business
School on Monday, January 10, to recruit
new professional employees from among
next year's graduates. Stanford
Community Women for Peace will conduct
a peaceful picket outside the Business
School to protest the activities of the
Department of Defense and the fact that it
is welcome to use the facilities of the
Stanford campus.
We hope others will join us.

It is impressive the way a small minority
of non-students is ushering in a new era of

"in loco parentis". 1 thought the student
body voted that out by referendum several
years ago. Josephson, Shock, Siegel, and
other non-students should heed the desire
of students to sever their parents'
dominion.
The Placement Service is just what it
says—a service. Like the Counseling
Service, Food Service, and others, only
those students who desire need use
them—and this may not necessarily be a
majority of the student body. Denying a
student free access to employment
opportunities is an abridgement of his right
to choose what work he wants to do ana
for whom he wants to work.
Josephson, Shock and Siegel—why don't
you go away and leave our students to

Apology
Editor, THE DAILY:
Assistant Dean Kirkland of the
Engineering School recently accused me of
the big lie technique, for my suggestion
that Kirkland was a candidate for Dean. I
would like to apologize to Mr. Kirkland. I
was wrong.
I have since talked to many students
and faculty within the Engineering School,
and I have learned that there is little
likelihood that Mr. Kirkland will even be
elected to Associate Dean.
I have also learned that the Engineering
School establishment (or at least the
Departments of Aero & Astro and
Electrical Engineering) is trying to agree
upon a unity candidate to defeat all
outsiders.
Vote for me.

Venceremos Democracy
Editor, THE DAILY:
While better than past Daily attempts to
characterize Venceremos. Kevin Smith's
article presented a superficial—and
misleading—view of the organization. I
would like to point out what I consider its
two major defects.
1.) By devoting the largest part of his
article to the two splits that have occurred
in our ranks in the last four years, while
not saying anything at all
about Venceremos' contribution to
leadership in the Stanford movement, he
showed that he was ignorant of how
Venceremos has grown larger and stronger
through the very struggles which led to
those splits. Our strength on campus has
increased dramatically since the departure
of the people now in the "Intercommunal
Survival Committee"; and the
anti-imperialist movement is off to a
running start this year with a well
organized coalition of the left including
just about everbody except the "ISC."
2.) The most misleading part of Kevin
Smith's article was the title: "Venceremos
Stresses Centralism." Here also Mr. Smith
presented only one half of the dialectic. We
know from our practice in Venceremos
that the organization has a far greater
chance of making correct decisions than
any of its individual members . . . but only
when everyone's experience is taken into
consideration and when the organization
functions as a whole.
Consequently, the Central Committee
(made up of the most experienced and
politically advanced members of
Venceremos) never makes a political or
tactical decision without making an
investigation throughout the organization
to sum up relevant practice first.
The only way to tell if their decision is
correct is to put it into practice. The

quickest and most efficient way is for a lot
of people working in different areas and
under different conditions to implement it
at the same time and then to sum up the
results; and that's the way Venceremos
does it. If the practice of the organization
suggests that a decision is wrong, the
Central Committee reconsiders it in the
light of this practice.
Basic decisions concerning the political
