Why pay more to patronize the
Bookstore? You can get it for
yourself wholesale.
Stanford students with access
to an A.S.S.U. account can obtain
school supplies at a fraction of
retail price, avoiding the mark-up
imposed by the Stanford
Bookstore, as well as the long
lines there during Reg week.
At the Bookstore one pays .21
for a Bic pen, .49 for a Flair
marker, and 1.10 for 100 sheets
of Corrasable typing paper. These
same supplies, and many more,
can be requisitioned from the
University Store warehouse for
much less: .09 for a Bic pen, .30
for a Flair marker, and 3.48 for a
ream (500 sheets) of Corrasable
typing paper.
Each University Residence has
an account with the A.S.S.U.
financial office. House funds are
collected in this account, and
withdrawn as needed. This
centralization insures that each
student will pay his house dues.
Should a student refuse to pay,
the A.S.S.U. can apply the

leverage of Stanford bureacracy,
and threaten to attach his housing
deposit, or to refuse to register
him the next quarter.
But the A.S.S.U. account can
also be used to requisition
supplies from the University
Storeâ€”a large warehouse located
off Serra street behind the
Stanford Fire Station. Normal'v,
this warehouse stocks the
academic departments and
university offices. A mechanism
also exists for student groups to
obtain typical office supplies at
wholesale prices.
First, students should read the
University Store catalogue of
Office Supplies, and then decide
on an order in bulk. Using the
catalogue for instructions and
correct stock numbers, students
can fill out an A.S.S.U. purchase
order and the SU-41 requisition
form. The house treasurer will
need to sign and fill in their
account number.
After paying the A.S.S.U.
office and obtaining the signature
of the A.S.S.U. financial manager

Tom Huseby, they can take the
requisition to the warehouse and
pick up their order or the
warehouse will deliver to the
residence the same as it does to
the offices. Purchase orders,
SU-41 forms, and an Office
Supplies Catalogue with pages of
listings are available in the
A.S.S.U. office. Tom Husebv's
hours there are 3-6 weekdays.
By getting together to do this
service for themselves, students
form an economic union against
high prices. The Stanford
Bookstore enjoys a very
advantageous position, being the
official on-campus supply of
books for most classes. And since
it is convenient for students to
buy their supplies with their
books, the Bookstore makes a
profit on paper and pens, etc.
Students need not remain
hapless victims of this sort of
financial exploitation. A
legitimate mechanism exists for us
to be stocked with supplies like
the other university departments.
If professors and secretaries
receive their supplies at one-half
price, why should we not also?
Many of us don't have as much
money as they receive in salaries.
In claiming this measure of
economic autonomy that is
rightfully ours, we save each other
money at the same time that we
alleviate congestion in the
Bookstore. The only people not
to benefit are those with vested
interests in the Bookstore's
profits.
