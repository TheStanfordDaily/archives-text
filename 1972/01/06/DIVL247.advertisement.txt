OPEN RECRUITING: A FACULTY VIEW
We believe that a policy of restricting recruitment is not only offensive but also impractical and
unworkable in a university.
Simply stated, we must not as a community abrogate by referendum or edict the rights of other
individuals or groups at Stanford. Unless we protect the minority who hold unpopular, or as some think,
immoral views, yes, even those who would interview with General Motors or Honeywell, then no
minority and no individual is safe here. The rights of minorities cannot be dealt with as if they were only
political issues, left to the exigencies of power. Witness to that is three hundred years of injustice to
Blacks in America.
For us, the force of principle is sufficient to decide the issue. But let us look at the practical
consequences of adopting such a policy.
Last spring's student referendum proposed 'To prohibit the use of Stanford lands by corporations
that are directly producing material and research for the military." This is nothing short of moral
inspection. Once such an idea is allowed to take hold, where would it go? Times change and power
shifts, and new scapegoats are needed. What of Black Panthers? Venceremos? The Free Abortion
Committee? The Police Department? It is not far-fetched to suggest that these groups might fail to pass a
moral inspection, depending of course on who is doing the inspecting.
WHO WILL DECIDE AND BY WHAT STANDARD?
Even supporters of the referendum now recognize that its principle of exclusion from the campus is
ridiculous, for it would exclude food processors, auto makers and practically every university in the
country. Nor is there a principle at hand to take its place. A suggested rule of thumb has been the
exclusion of weapon makers. All weapons? Axes? Knives used by commandos? Sfnd-bags which might
be used in place of lethal weapons? Makers of parts? Makers of covers? Does the rule refer only to large
weapons? What size? How lethal? What is the threshold separating "good and bad"? There are as many
thresholds as there are people on this campus.
How will the guardians of our purity be selected? Considering the enormity of the job of investigating
over 500 organizations each year, will the guardians be full-time? Should we consider a permanent
committee? Who would take on such a job? Would we want him? Should the issue of cleanliness be
decided by simple majority?
In any case, our community is wonderfully pluralistic. We are private people with our own codes of
right and wrong. Most of us knowthat moral responsibility cannot be delegated or legislated.
WHAT ABOUT THE PRACTICAL CONSEQUENCES?
The Peace Corps is a frequent recruiter on campus. Can anyone doubt that it is part of an
organization involved with the military? What principle of exclusion is not on its face ridiculous? Would
we allow recruiters from a division of Dow Chemical that was not involved with the military? Perhaps
more Stanford students are interested in the Peace Corps than in Dow. Is that the principle?
The Placement Center is a convenient focus for the great diversity of recruiting activities on the
campus. A restrictive policy would seep into all these other activities.
E.G., a law firm sends a member to interview law students. The firm has a client who may be involved
in supplying rockets for the military. How can the investigating committee determine these connections?
If it turns out that there are these connections, then OUT?
E.G., A corporation sends an interviewer to the Business School. The corporation has put in a bid to
supply jeeps to the army. Do we wait to see if the bid is accepted, and then if so, OUT?
E.G., A former Stanford student now employed at Honeywell visits his old advisor (OUT?) in his
office and expresses an interest in recruiting students. Can the professor discuss the matter? OUT?
E.G., A Berkeley English professor is here to read his poems and at lunch asks a Stanford colleague
his opinion on a prospective instructor. The Berkeley English Department, like ours, is supported in part
by overhead paid to the university by the Department of Defense. Can our professor respond to the
inquiry? Can the man make the speech? OUT?
Reductio ad absurdum? Yes. The point is precisely that a fair and even-handed application of such a
policy would be impossible, and the attempt to apply it would do untold damage to the life of this
university.
Everyone at Stanford has ample opportunity to express his views about these corporations. Educating
the public is important, and full disclosure of corporate activities and non-disruptive picketing can
contribute to that education. Censorship, however, is contra-educational in this as in all areas. Individual
students, and faculty, must be free to decide for themselves.
We wonder how many of the persons who have interfered with the Placement Center recently are
I students who need jobs and use the Center. Jobs are scarce today, at all degree levels. Not to have
recruitment, or to make life so miserable for the recruiters that none will come, would mean a great
hardship for those very students most in need of help. Are their rights, their needs, of no concern?
Such a policy represents a particularly sinister form of in loco parentis. It is called Big Brother. It
must be rejected.
