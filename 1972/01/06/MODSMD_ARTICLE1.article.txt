# Board Calls For Franklin's Dismissal
## Campus Reaction Varies, Group Marches To Lyman 
### CHRIS PECK GLENN GARVIN 
Stanford students and faculty
reacted with surprise, disbelief, and in
some cases anger yesterday upon
learning the Advisory Board
recommendation that Associate
English Professor H. Bruce Franklin be
dismissed from the Stanford faculty.
About 60 students marched to
President Lyman's house last night and
chanted slogans in support of the
apparently soon-to-be-fired professor.
There were no arrests or incidents.
The march followed a two and a
half hour meeting in Serra House
attended by over 300 people called to
discuss the Advisory Board's 5 to 2
decision.
A rally and march in support of
Franklin has been called today for
White Plaza at noon.
Attend Meeting
Along with scheduling the rally and
march for today, last night's meeting
also voted to attend an Academic
Council meeting scheduled for Friday
afternoon in Dinkelspiel Auditorium
at which time Lyman is expected to
present his report on the Franklin case
to the Council.
It was also encouraged that
students get their classes to discuss the
Franklin issue today.
The meeting also discussed tactics
ranging from sitting in at Lyman's
office to rehiring Franklin with
student funds to disrupting classes of
Advisory Board members who voted
for Franklin's firing.
At Lyman's house the group was
met by several Stanford policemen
including police chief Marvin
Herrington. Several Santa Clara
Sheriff's cars were also in Lyman's
driveway.
The group stayed for about ten
minutes shouting "Marx, Lenin,
Castro, Mao, Hire Bruce! Do it now!"
Gerry Foote also addressed the crowd
and said the rally proved "we don't
need Bruce Franklin to have a
movement here" and that "there's
nothing Lyman can do to stop the
movement at Stanford."
The demonstrators broke up
around 10:15 p.m. and dispersed to
the dorms.
While some professors admitted
they would be glad to see Franklin
leave the faculty, not one said he
expected the Advisory Board to
recommend untempered dismissal.
Many faculty members voiced
concern over possible repercussions in
the academic community concerning
academic freedom and dissent. Nobel
prize-winning chemist Linus Pauling
described the decision as "a great blow
not just to academic freedom but to
freedom of speech."
Art History professor Dwight Miller
conceded that he felt "a little less
secure" of his academic tenure as a

result of the Franklin decision and
added "I think most other professors
will feel the same."
Charles Drekmier, Political Science
professor added, "If tenured
professors can be dismissed for so little
reason then we're all in jeopardy."
Careful Study
English Department Chairman
Carnochan touched on the academic
freedom issue, saying, "I think every
faculty member will be studying the
Advisory Board document very
carefully. If they are persuaded by the
majority report that Franklin deserves
to be fired, there won't be any reason
to think that the decision will inhibit
academic freedom. If upon reading the
majority report the faculty is not
convinced that such strong measures
are in order, this decision probably
will erode academic freedom at
Stanford."

REPRESSED REVOLUTIONARY—H. Bruce Franklin answers questions at a
press conference following the Advisory Board's recommendation that he be
dismissed from the University.
The liberal Faculty Political Action Group issued a
statement attacking the Advisory Board decision saying that
"as faculty of Stanford University, we wish to express our
shock and outrage that following eight weeks of hearings in
which no substantial evidence was offered by the
administration to support the charges against Bruce Franklin,
a majority of the Advisory Board has chosen to recommend
his dismissal. This is a political firing and will result in
increased intimidation and repression on university campuses
everywhere."
Other faculty members dismissed the idea that academic
freedom at Stanford had been threatened by the Franklin
decision. Konrad Krauskopf, Assistant Dean of Earth
Sciences argued that the decision was nothing more than "a
clearcut case of the University's existence being threatened
by professor Franklin's presence" and the need to protect
the university structure.
'Out To Destroy'
Another professor in Art History said he was "very happy

about the decision because Franklin was out to destroy the
University" and should therefore be banned from teaching.
Law Professor Herbert Packer and Assistant Overseas
Campus Director Paul Hanley agreed with Krauskopf's
interpretation of the Franklin decision because as Hanley
noted, "the faculty will continue to speak out on political
and social issues within the limitations of dignity."
Communications professor William Rivers didn't see the
decision as a threat to academic freedom either. "It will still
be possible to take political stands at Stanford after Bruce
Franklin is gone," he predicted.
Some faculty members were surprised by the Advisory
Board's decisive 5-2 vote to fire Franklin. "I predicted the
result would be six to one against firing Franklin," chemistry
professor Pauling noted.
'Political Vote'
Art History professor Miller added, "1 was surprised by
the 5-2 vote. I've heard some people say that the
pro-Franklin vote by Professor Kennedy was a political vote
because of the lopsided nature of the decision."

"You're kidding me. Son-of-a-bitch. Well. Hmm. Ahh,"
was the mumbled reaction of Free Campus Movement leader
Chris Hocker to the Franklin decision, and that was typical
of most student response to the news. Utter
astonishment—or utter apathy—was almost always the
prevailing emotion among the students polled.
"It totally blew me out," Pete Knutson of the Young
Crows said. "It was a total surprise. This is obviously an
assault on the whole anti-war community. Reading over the
charges, it was obvious to everyone—at least, everyone I
know—that they didn't have a shred of evidence to convict
him."
Moves Fast
Knutson moved fast once he recovered from the initial
shock; in a matter of hours leaflets from the Young Crows
appeared all over campus advertising last night's meeting in
Serra House.
"Are you serious?" questioned a disbelieving Doug
McHenry when the Daily told him of the decision. "I'll have
to talk to my council." Five hours later the Council of
Presidents issued a statement attacking the decision as
"insidiously twisted" and adding that "the lid may now be
off on repression of political dissent on campus." The
statement was also signed by James Jefferson, Chairman of
the ASSU Senate.
Lenny Siegel, Director of the Pacific Studies Center and
professed candidate for Dean of Engineering, was hardly
coherent for about two minutes after he was told of the
decision. He finally managed to say that the verdict was
"obviously an unjust response to pressure. I'd have to see the
reasons they list before I can fully comment."
"I will continue my campaign for Dean. I will not be
intimidated," he added.
Hocker Happy
Hocker was one of the few activist students who was
happy about the decision. "I am glad he got fired, but I think
that it's too bad the University had to go to the expense and
trouble they did," he said.
But he continued: "I thought on the evidence they
presented they would never come to that decision." When
the Daily asked him if he thought the University had proved
its case against Franklin, Hocker said: "I'll probably get in

trouble for saying this, but I don't think so. Some of them
[the charges] were [proven] and some of them weren't. I
thought the one on the Computation Center was pretty solid,
but I don't think they did much of a job on the others.
"If the University had any real nerve, they would have
tried him on the basis of his teaching, which is the only true
basis for evaluating a professor," Hocker said. He added that
he didn't think Franklin could have survived such a test.
Around the dinner tables and lounges of dorms, it was a
different story. Monty Bossard, a freshman at Roble, put it
nicely: "The main political force on this campus is apathy."
Franklin Who?
There were occasional low key conversations, but the
news that John Ralston had accepted a coaching post with a
pro football team got about the same amount of
attention—maybe more. Many students hadn't heard of the
firing, despite leaflets in meal lines; others knew and didn't
care. Some were completely in the dark: "You mean
Benjamin Franklin?" responded one confused girl.
"This year's freshmen are the most apathetic group ever,"
lamented one senior. "With Angela Davis right in town they
haven't done anything." But he wasn't planning anything
himself: "There's nothing else to do."
"It's about six or seven people on this campus, but they
can make a lot of noise and a lot of trouble," pointed out
one sophomore. "The students don't care about this at all,
but there will be some trashing anyway."
"I never did like Franklin," a senior said. "He always kept
out of trouble. He'd say, 'let's go trash' and he'd be out there
leading us and then he'd sort of disappear and give us all this
shit about being a revolutionary leader with the FBI after
him."
Some of the discussion on the decision wasless prolix. "It
sucks," a man at dinner in Donner said. "I agree," said a
woman sitting beside him.
Perhaps faculty and students would agree with English
Department head Carnochan who sighed yesterday and
predicted, "there's one thing I know for sure; we have only
begun to hear and see the reaction to this decision."
(Daily staff members who helped compile reactions for
this story include Bob Vining, Patty Fels, Bob Bacon, Mary
Koto and Jon Dedmon.)


DECISIONS, DECISIONS—The long hours of hearing
testimony in the Franklin case appear to be taking their toll
on these four Advisory Board members, (from left to right)
Psychiatry Professor David Hamburg, Chemical Engineering
Chairman David Mason, Sociology Professor Sandy

Dornbusch, and SLAC Director Wolfgang Panofsky.
However, the four have to worry no more now that a 5 to 2
decision of the board recommending that Franklin be fired
has ended the case, at least as far as the Advisory Board is
concerned.

Careful Study
English Department Chairman
Carnochan touched on the academic
freedom issue, saying, "I think every
faculty member will be studying the
Advisory Board document very
carefully. If they are persuaded by the
majority report that Franklin deserves
to be fired, there won't be any reason
to think that the decision will inhibit
academic freedom. If upon reading the
majority report the faculty is not
convinced that such strong measures
are in order, this decision probably
will erode academic freedom at
Stanford."

REPRESSED REVOLUTIONARY—H. Bruce Franklin answers questions at a
press conference following the Advisory Board's recommendation that he be
dismissed from the University.
The liberal Faculty Political Action Group issued a
statement attacking the Advisory Board decision saying that
"as faculty of Stanford University, we wish to express our
shock and outrage that following eight weeks of hearings in
which no substantial evidence was offered by the
administration to support the charges against Bruce Franklin,
a majority of the Advisory Board has chosen to recommend
his dismissal. This is a political firing and will result in
increased intimidation and repression on university campuses
everywhere."
Other faculty members dismissed the idea that academic
freedom at Stanford had been threatened by the Franklin
decision. Konrad Krauskopf, Assistant Dean of Earth
Sciences argued that the decision was nothing more than "a
clearcut case of the University's existence being threatened
by professor Franklin's presence" and the need to protect
the university structure.
'Out To Destroy'
Another professor in Art History said he was "very happy

about the decision because Franklin was out to destroy the
University" and should therefore be banned from teaching.
Law Professor Herbert Packer and Assistant Overseas
Campus Director Paul Hanley agreed with Krauskopf's
interpretation of the Franklin decision because as Hanley
noted, "the faculty will continue to speak out on political
and social issues within the limitations of dignity."
Communications professor William Rivers didn't see the
decision as a threat to academic freedom either. "It will still
be possible to take political stands at Stanford after Bruce
Franklin is gone," he predicted.
Some faculty members were surprised by the Advisory
Board's decisive 5-2 vote to fire Franklin. "I predicted the
result would be six to one against firing Franklin," chemistry
professor Pauling noted.
'Political Vote'
Art History professor Miller added, "1 was surprised by
the 5-2 vote. I've heard some people say that the
pro-Franklin vote by Professor Kennedy was a political vote
because of the lopsided nature of the decision."

"You're kidding me. Son-of-a-bitch. Well. Hmm. Ahh,"
was the mumbled reaction of Free Campus Movement leader
Chris Hocker to the Franklin decision, and that was typical
of most student response to the news. Utter
astonishment—or utter apathy—was almost always the
prevailing emotion among the students polled.
"It totally blew me out," Pete Knutson of the Young
Crows said. "It was a total surprise. This is obviously an
assault on the whole anti-war community. Reading over the
charges, it was obvious to everyone—at least, everyone I
know—that they didn't have a shred of evidence to convict
him."
Moves Fast
Knutson moved fast once he recovered from the initial
shock; in a matter of hours leaflets from the Young Crows
appeared all over campus advertising last night's meeting in
Serra House.
"Are you serious?" questioned a disbelieving Doug
McHenry when the Daily told him of the decision. "I'll have
to talk to my council." Five hours later the Council of
Presidents issued a statement attacking the decision as
"insidiously twisted" and adding that "the lid may now be
off on repression of political dissent on campus." The
statement was also signed by James Jefferson, Chairman of
the ASSU Senate.
Lenny Siegel, Director of the Pacific Studies Center and
professed candidate for Dean of Engineering, was hardly
coherent for about two minutes after he was told of the
decision. He finally managed to say that the verdict was
"obviously an unjust response to pressure. I'd have to see the
reasons they list before I can fully comment."
"I will continue my campaign for Dean. I will not be
intimidated," he added.
Hocker Happy
Hocker was one of the few activist students who was
happy about the decision. "I am glad he got fired, but I think
that it's too bad the University had to go to the expense and
trouble they did," he said.
But he continued: "I thought on the evidence they
presented they would never come to that decision." When
the Daily asked him if he thought the University had proved
its case against Franklin, Hocker said: "I'll probably get in

trouble for saying this, but I don't think so. Some of them
[the charges] were [proven] and some of them weren't. I
thought the one on the Computation Center was pretty solid,
but I don't think they did much of a job on the others.
"If the University had any real nerve, they would have
tried him on the basis of his teaching, which is the only true
basis for evaluating a professor," Hocker said. He added that
he didn't think Franklin could have survived such a test.
Around the dinner tables and lounges of dorms, it was a
different story. Monty Bossard, a freshman at Roble, put it
nicely: "The main political force on this campus is apathy."
Franklin Who?
There were occasional low key conversations, but the
news that John Ralston had accepted a coaching post with a
pro football team got about the same amount of
attention—maybe more. Many students hadn't heard of the
firing, despite leaflets in meal lines; others knew and didn't
care. Some were completely in the dark: "You mean
Benjamin Franklin?" responded one confused girl.
"This year's freshmen are the most apathetic group ever,"
lamented one senior. "With Angela Davis right in town they
haven't done anything." But he wasn't planning anything
himself: "There's nothing else to do."
"It's about six or seven people on this campus, but they
can make a lot of noise and a lot of trouble," pointed out
one sophomore. "The students don't care about this at all,
but there will be some trashing anyway."
"I never did like Franklin," a senior said. "He always kept
out of trouble. He'd say, 'let's go trash' and he'd be out there
leading us and then he'd sort of disappear and give us all this
shit about being a revolutionary leader with the FBI after
him."
Some of the discussion on the decision wasless prolix. "It
sucks," a man at dinner in Donner said. "I agree," said a
woman sitting beside him.
Perhaps faculty and students would agree with English
Department head Carnochan who sighed yesterday and
predicted, "there's one thing I know for sure; we have only
begun to hear and see the reaction to this decision."
(Daily staff members who helped compile reactions for
this story include Bob Vining, Patty Fels, Bob Bacon, Mary
Koto and Jon Dedmon.)


DECISIONS, DECISIONS—The long hours of hearing
testimony in the Franklin case appear to be taking their toll
on these four Advisory Board members, (from left to right)
Psychiatry Professor David Hamburg, Chemical Engineering
Chairman David Mason, Sociology Professor Sandy

Dornbusch, and SLAC Director Wolfgang Panofsky.
However, the four have to worry no more now that a 5 to 2
decision of the board recommending that Franklin be fired
has ended the case, at least as far as the Advisory Board is
concerned.
Stanford students and faculty
reacted with surprise, disbelief, and in
some cases anger yesterday upon
learning the Advisory Board
recommendation that Associate
English Professor H. Bruce Franklin be
dismissed from the Stanford faculty.
About 60 students marched to
President Lyman's house last night and
chanted slogans in support of the
apparently soon-to-be-fired professor.
There were no arrests or incidents.
The march followed a two and a
half hour meeting in Serra House
attended by over 300 people called to
discuss the Advisory Board's 5 to 2
decision.
A rally and march in support of
Franklin has been called today for
White Plaza at noon.
Attend Meeting
Along with scheduling the rally and
march for today, last night's meeting
also voted to attend an Academic
Council meeting scheduled for Friday
afternoon in Dinkelspiel Auditorium
at which time Lyman is expected to
present his report on the Franklin case
to the Council.
It was also encouraged that
students get their classes to discuss the
Franklin issue today.
The meeting also discussed tactics
ranging from sitting in at Lyman's
office to rehiring Franklin with
student funds to disrupting classes of
Advisory Board members who voted
for Franklin's firing.
At Lyman's house the group was
met by several Stanford policemen
including police chief Marvin
Herrington. Several Santa Clara
Sheriff's cars were also in Lyman's
driveway.
The group stayed for about ten
minutes shouting "Marx, Lenin,
Castro, Mao, Hire Bruce! Do it now!"
Gerry Foote also addressed the crowd
and said the rally proved "we don't
need Bruce Franklin to have a
movement here" and that "there's
nothing Lyman can do to stop the
movement at Stanford."
The demonstrators broke up
around 10:15 p.m. and dispersed to
the dorms.
While some professors admitted
they would be glad to see Franklin
leave the faculty, not one said he
expected the Advisory Board to
recommend untempered dismissal.
Many faculty members voiced
concern over possible repercussions in
the academic community concerning
academic freedom and dissent. Nobel
prize-winning chemist Linus Pauling
described the decision as "a great blow
not just to academic freedom but to
freedom of speech."
Art History professor Dwight Miller
conceded that he felt "a little less
secure" of his academic tenure as a

result of the Franklin decision and
added "I think most other professors
will feel the same."
Charles Drekmier, Political Science
professor added, "If tenured
professors can be dismissed for so little
reason then we're all in jeopardy."

the 5-2 vote. I've heard some people say that the
pro-Franklin vote by Professor Kennedy was a political vote
because of the lopsided nature of the decision."

"You're kidding me. Son-of-a-bitch. Well. Hmm. Ahh,"
was the mumbled reaction of Free Campus Movement leader
Chris Hocker to the Franklin decision, and that was typical
of most student response to the news. Utter
astonishment—or utter apathy—was almost always the
prevailing emotion among the students polled.
"It totally blew me out," Pete Knutson of the Young
Crows said. "It was a total surprise. This is obviously an
assault on the whole anti-war community. Reading over the
charges, it was obvious to everyone—at least, everyone I
know—that they didn't have a shred of evidence to convict
him."
Moves Fast
Knutson moved fast once he recovered from the initial
shock; in a matter of hours leaflets from the Young Crows
appeared all over campus advertising last night's meeting in
Serra House.
"Are you serious?" questioned a disbelieving Doug
McHenry when the Daily told him of the decision. "I'll have
to talk to my council." Five hours later the Council of
Presidents issued a statement attacking the decision as
"insidiously twisted" and adding that "the lid may now be
off on repression of political dissent on campus." The
statement was also signed by James Jefferson, Chairman of
the ASSU Senate.
Lenny Siegel, Director of the Pacific Studies Center and
professed candidate for Dean of Engineering, was hardly
coherent for about two minutes after he was told of the
decision. He finally managed to say that the verdict was
"obviously an unjust response to pressure. I'd have to see the
reasons they list before I can fully comment."
"I will continue my campaign for Dean. I will not be
intimidated," he added.
Hocker Happy
Hocker was one of the few activist students who was
happy about the decision. "I am glad he got fired, but I think
that it's too bad the University had to go to the expense and
trouble they did," he said.
But he continued: "I thought on the evidence they
presented they would never come to that decision." When
the Daily asked him if he thought the University had proved
its case against Franklin, Hocker said: "I'll probably get in

trouble for saying this, but I don't think so. Some of them
[the charges] were [proven] and some of them weren't. I
thought the one on the Computation Center was pretty solid,
but I don't think they did much of a job on the others.
"If the University had any real nerve, they would have
tried him on the basis of his teaching, which is the only true
basis for evaluating a professor," Hocker said. He added that
he didn't think Franklin could have survived such a test.
Around the dinner tables and lounges of dorms, it was a
different story. Monty Bossard, a freshman at Roble, put it
nicely: "The main political force on this campus is apathy."
Franklin Who?
There were occasional low key conversations, but the
news that John Ralston had accepted a coaching post with a
pro football team got about the same amount of
attention—maybe more. Many students hadn't heard of the
firing, despite leaflets in meal lines; others knew and didn't
care. Some were completely in the dark: "You mean
Benjamin Franklin?" responded one confused girl.
"This year's freshmen are the most apathetic group ever,"
lamented one senior. "With Angela Davis right in town they
haven't done anything." But he wasn't planning anything
himself: "There's nothing else to do."
"It's about six or seven people on this campus, but they
can make a lot of noise and a lot of trouble," pointed out
one sophomore. "The students don't care about this at all,
but there will be some trashing anyway."
"I never did like Franklin," a senior said. "He always kept
out of trouble. He'd say, 'let's go trash' and he'd be out there
leading us and then he'd sort of disappear and give us all this
shit about being a revolutionary leader with the FBI after
him."
Some of the discussion on the decision wasless prolix. "It
sucks," a man at dinner in Donner said. "I agree," said a
woman sitting beside him.
Perhaps faculty and students would agree with English
Department head Carnochan who sighed yesterday and
predicted, "there's one thing I know for sure; we have only
begun to hear and see the reaction to this decision."

DECISIONS, DECISIONS—The long hours of hearing
testimony in the Franklin case appear to be taking their toll
on these four Advisory Board members, (from left to right)
Psychiatry Professor David Hamburg, Chemical Engineering
Chairman David Mason, Sociology Professor Sandy

Dornbusch, and SLAC Director Wolfgang Panofsky.
However, the four have to worry no more now that a 5 to 2
decision of the board recommending that Franklin be fired
has ended the case, at least as far as the Advisory Board is
concerned.
Stanford students and faculty
reacted with surprise, disbelief, and in
some cases anger yesterday upon
learning the Advisory Board
recommendation that Associate
English Professor H. Bruce Franklin be
dismissed from the Stanford faculty.
About 60 students marched to
President Lyman's house last night and
chanted slogans in support of the
apparently soon-to-be-fired professor.
There were no arrests or incidents.
The march followed a two and a
half hour meeting in Serra House
attended by over 300 people called to
discuss the Advisory Board's 5 to 2
decision.
A rally and march in support of
Franklin has been called today for
White Plaza at noon.
Attend Meeting
Along with scheduling the rally and
march for today, last night's meeting
also voted to attend an Academic
Council meeting scheduled for Friday
afternoon in Dinkelspiel Auditorium
at which time Lyman is expected to
present his report on the Franklin case
to the Council.
It was also encouraged that
students get their classes to discuss the
Franklin issue today.
The meeting also discussed tactics
ranging from sitting in at Lyman's
office to rehiring Franklin with
student funds to disrupting classes of
Advisory Board members who voted
for Franklin's firing.
At Lyman's house the group was
met by several Stanford policemen
including police chief Marvin
Herrington. Several Santa Clara
Sheriff's cars were also in Lyman's
driveway.
The group stayed for about ten
minutes shouting "Marx, Lenin,
Castro, Mao, Hire Bruce! Do it now!"
Gerry Foote also addressed the crowd
and said the rally proved "we don't
need Bruce Franklin to have a
movement here" and that "there's
nothing Lyman can do to stop the
movement at Stanford."
The demonstrators broke up
around 10:15 p.m. and dispersed to
the dorms.
While some professors admitted
they would be glad to see Franklin
leave the faculty, not one said he
expected the Advisory Board to
recommend untempered dismissal.
Many faculty members voiced
concern over possible repercussions in
the academic community concerning
academic freedom and dissent. Nobel
prize-winning chemist Linus Pauling
described the decision as "a great blow
not just to academic freedom but to
freedom of speech."
Art History professor Dwight Miller
conceded that he felt "a little less
secure" of his academic tenure as a

result of the Franklin decision and
added "I think most other professors
will feel the same."
Charles Drekmier, Political Science
professor added, "If tenured
professors can be dismissed for so little
reason then we're all in jeopardy."
Careful Study
English Department Chairman
Carnochan touched on the academic
freedom issue, saying, "I think every
faculty member will be studying the
Advisory Board document very
carefully. If they are persuaded by the
majority report that Franklin deserves
to be fired, there won't be any reason
to think that the decision will inhibit
academic freedom. If upon reading the
majority report the faculty is not
convinced that such strong measures
are in order, this decision probably
will erode academic freedom at
Stanford."

REPRESSED REVOLUTIONARY—H. Bruce Franklin answers questions at a
press conference following the Advisory Board's recommendation that he be
dismissed from the University.
The liberal Faculty Political Action Group issued a
statement attacking the Advisory Board decision saying that
"as faculty of Stanford University, we wish to express our
shock and outrage that following eight weeks of hearings in
which no substantial evidence was offered by the
administration to support the charges against Bruce Franklin,
a majority of the Advisory Board has chosen to recommend
his dismissal. This is a political firing and will result in
increased intimidation and repression on university campuses
everywhere."
Other faculty members dismissed the idea that academic
freedom at Stanford had been threatened by the Franklin
decision. Konrad Krauskopf, Assistant Dean of Earth
Sciences argued that the decision was nothing more than "a
clearcut case of the University's existence being threatened
by professor Franklin's presence" and the need to protect
the university structure.
'Out To Destroy'
Another professor in Art History said he was "very happy

about the decision because Franklin was out to destroy the
University" and should therefore be banned from teaching.
Law Professor Herbert Packer and Assistant Overseas
Campus Director Paul Hanley agreed with Krauskopf's
interpretation of the Franklin decision because as Hanley
noted, "the faculty will continue to speak out on political
and social issues within the limitations of dignity."
Communications professor William Rivers didn't see the
decision as a threat to academic freedom either. "It will still
be possible to take political stands at Stanford after Bruce
Franklin is gone," he predicted.
Some faculty members were surprised by the Advisory
Board's decisive 5-2 vote to fire Franklin. "I predicted the
result would be six to one against firing Franklin," chemistry
professor Pauling noted.

Art History professor Miller added, "1 was surprised by
the 5-2 vote. I've heard some people say that the

but I don't think they did much of a job on the others.
"If the University had any real nerve, they would have
tried him on the basis of his teaching, which is the only true
basis for evaluating a professor," Hocker said. He added that
he didn't think Franklin could have survived such a test.
Around the dinner tables and lounges of dorms, it was a
different story. Monty Bossard, a freshman at Roble, put it
nicely: "The main political force on this campus is apathy."
Franklin Who?
There were occasional low key conversations, but the
news that John Ralston had accepted a coaching post with a
pro football team got about the same amount of
attention—maybe more. Many students hadn't heard of the
firing, despite leaflets in meal lines; others knew and didn't
care. Some were completely in the dark: "You mean
Benjamin Franklin?" responded one confused girl.
"This year's freshmen are the most apathetic group ever,"
lamented one senior. "With Angela Davis right in town they
haven't done anything." But he wasn't planning anything
himself: "There's nothing else to do."
"It's about six or seven people on this campus, but they
can make a lot of noise and a lot of trouble," pointed out
one sophomore. "The students don't care about this at all,
but there will be some trashing anyway."
"I never did like Franklin," a senior said. "He always kept
out of trouble. He'd say, 'let's go trash' and he'd be out there
leading us and then he'd sort of disappear and give us all this
shit about being a revolutionary leader with the FBI after
him."
Some of the discussion on the decision wasless prolix. "It
sucks," a man at dinner in Donner said. "I agree," said a
woman sitting beside him.
Perhaps faculty and students would agree with English
Department head Carnochan who sighed yesterday and
predicted, "there's one thing I know for sure; we have only
begun to hear and see the reaction to this decision."

DECISIONS, DECISIONS—The long hours of hearing
testimony in the Franklin case appear to be taking their toll
on these four Advisory Board members, (from left to right)
Psychiatry Professor David Hamburg, Chemical Engineering
Chairman David Mason, Sociology Professor Sandy

Dornbusch, and SLAC Director Wolfgang Panofsky.
However, the four have to worry no more now that a 5 to 2
decision of the board recommending that Franklin be fired
has ended the case, at least as far as the Advisory Board is
concerned.
Stanford students and faculty
reacted with surprise, disbelief, and in
some cases anger yesterday upon
learning the Advisory Board
recommendation that Associate
English Professor H. Bruce Franklin be
dismissed from the Stanford faculty.
About 60 students marched to
President Lyman's house last night and
chanted slogans in support of the
apparently soon-to-be-fired professor.
There were no arrests or incidents.
The march followed a two and a
half hour meeting in Serra House
attended by over 300 people called to
discuss the Advisory Board's 5 to 2
decision.
A rally and march in support of
Franklin has been called today for
White Plaza at noon.
Attend Meeting
Along with scheduling the rally and
march for today, last night's meeting
also voted to attend an Academic
Council meeting scheduled for Friday
afternoon in Dinkelspiel Auditorium
at which time Lyman is expected to
present his report on the Franklin case
to the Council.
It was also encouraged that
students get their classes to discuss the
Franklin issue today.
The meeting also discussed tactics
ranging from sitting in at Lyman's
office to rehiring Franklin with
student funds to disrupting classes of
Advisory Board members who voted
for Franklin's firing.
At Lyman's house the group was
met by several Stanford policemen
including police chief Marvin
Herrington. Several Santa Clara
Sheriff's cars were also in Lyman's
driveway.
The group stayed for about ten
minutes shouting "Marx, Lenin,
Castro, Mao, Hire Bruce! Do it now!"
Gerry Foote also addressed the crowd
and said the rally proved "we don't
need Bruce Franklin to have a
movement here" and that "there's
nothing Lyman can do to stop the
movement at Stanford."
The demonstrators broke up
around 10:15 p.m. and dispersed to
the dorms.
While some professors admitted
they would be glad to see Franklin
leave the faculty, not one said he
expected the Advisory Board to
recommend untempered dismissal.
Many faculty members voiced
concern over possible repercussions in
the academic community concerning
academic freedom and dissent. Nobel
prize-winning chemist Linus Pauling
described the decision as "a great blow
not just to academic freedom but to
freedom of speech."
Art History professor Dwight Miller
conceded that he felt "a little less
secure" of his academic tenure as a

result of the Franklin decision and
added "I think most other professors
will feel the same."
Charles Drekmier, Political Science
professor added, "If tenured
professors can be dismissed for so little
reason then we're all in jeopardy."
Careful Study
English Department Chairman
Carnochan touched on the academic
freedom issue, saying, "I think every
faculty member will be studying the
Advisory Board document very
carefully. If they are persuaded by the
majority report that Franklin deserves
to be fired, there won't be any reason
to think that the decision will inhibit
academic freedom. If upon reading the
majority report the faculty is not
convinced that such strong measures
are in order, this decision probably
will erode academic freedom at
Stanford."

REPRESSED REVOLUTIONARY—H. Bruce Franklin answers questions at a
press conference following the Advisory Board's recommendation that he be
dismissed from the University.
The liberal Faculty Political Action Group issued a
statement attacking the Advisory Board decision saying that
"as faculty of Stanford University, we wish to express our
shock and outrage that following eight weeks of hearings in
which no substantial evidence was offered by the
administration to support the charges against Bruce Franklin,
a majority of the Advisory Board has chosen to recommend
his dismissal. This is a political firing and will result in
increased intimidation and repression on university campuses
everywhere."
Other faculty members dismissed the idea that academic
freedom at Stanford had been threatened by the Franklin
decision. Konrad Krauskopf, Assistant Dean of Earth
Sciences argued that the decision was nothing more than "a
clearcut case of the University's existence being threatened
by professor Franklin's presence" and the need to protect
the university structure.
'Out To Destroy'
Another professor in Art History said he was "very happy

about the decision because Franklin was out to destroy the
University" and should therefore be banned from teaching.
Law Professor Herbert Packer and Assistant Overseas
Campus Director Paul Hanley agreed with Krauskopf's
interpretation of the Franklin decision because as Hanley
noted, "the faculty will continue to speak out on political
and social issues within the limitations of dignity."
Communications professor William Rivers didn't see the
decision as a threat to academic freedom either. "It will still
be possible to take political stands at Stanford after Bruce
Franklin is gone," he predicted.
Some faculty members were surprised by the Advisory
Board's decisive 5-2 vote to fire Franklin. "I predicted the
result would be six to one against firing Franklin," chemistry
professor Pauling noted.
'Political Vote'
Art History professor Miller added, "1 was surprised by
the 5-2 vote. I've heard some people say that the
pro-Franklin vote by Professor Kennedy was a political vote
because of the lopsided nature of the decision."

"You're kidding me. Son-of-a-bitch. Well. Hmm. Ahh,"
was the mumbled reaction of Free Campus Movement leader
Chris Hocker to the Franklin decision, and that was typical
of most student response to the news. Utter
astonishment—or utter apathy—was almost always the
prevailing emotion among the students polled.
"It totally blew me out," Pete Knutson of the Young
Crows said. "It was a total surprise. This is obviously an
assault on the whole anti-war community. Reading over the
charges, it was obvious to everyone—at least, everyone I
know—that they didn't have a shred of evidence to convict
him."
Moves Fast
Knutson moved fast once he recovered from the initial
shock; in a matter of hours leaflets from the Young Crows
appeared all over campus advertising last night's meeting in
Serra House.
"Are you serious?" questioned a disbelieving Doug
McHenry when the Daily told him of the decision. "I'll have
to talk to my council." Five hours later the Council of
Presidents issued a statement attacking the decision as
"insidiously twisted" and adding that "the lid may now be
off on repression of political dissent on campus." The
statement was also signed by James Jefferson, Chairman of
the ASSU Senate.
Lenny Siegel, Director of the Pacific Studies Center and
professed candidate for Dean of Engineering, was hardly
coherent for about two minutes after he was told of the
decision. He finally managed to say that the verdict was
"obviously an unjust response to pressure. I'd have to see the
reasons they list before I can fully comment."
"I will continue my campaign for Dean. I will not be
intimidated," he added.
Hocker Happy
Hocker was one of the few activist students who was
happy about the decision. "I am glad he got fired, but I think
that it's too bad the University had to go to the expense and
trouble they did," he said.
But he continued: "I thought on the evidence they
presented they would never come to that decision." When
the Daily asked him if he thought the University had proved
its case against Franklin, Hocker said: "I'll probably get in

trouble for saying this, but I don't think so. Some of them
[the charges] were [proven] and some of them weren't. I
thought the one on the Computation Center was pretty solid,
but I don't think they did much of a job on the others.
"If the University had any real nerve, they would have
