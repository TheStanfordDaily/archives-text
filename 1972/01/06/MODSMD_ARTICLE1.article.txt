# Board Calls For Franklin's Dismissal
## Campus Reaction Varies, Group Marches To Lyman 
### CHRIS PECK GLENN GARVIN 
Stanford students and faculty
reacted with surprise, disbelief, and in
some cases anger yesterday upon
learning the Advisory Board
recommendation that Associate
English Professor H. Bruce Franklin be
dismissed from the Stanford faculty.
About 60 students marched to
President Lyman's house last night and
chanted slogans in support of the
apparently soon-to-be-fired professor.
There were no arrests or incidents.
The march followed a two and a
half hour meeting in Serra House
attended by over 300 people called to
discuss the Advisory Board's 5 to 2
decision.
A rally and march in support of
Franklin has been called today for
White Plaza at noon.
Attend Meeting
Along with scheduling the rally and
march for today, last night's meeting
also voted to attend an Academic
Council meeting scheduled for Friday
afternoon in Dinkelspiel Auditorium
at which time Lyman is expected to
present his report on the Franklin case
to the Council.
It was also encouraged that
students get their classes to discuss the
Franklin issue today.
The meeting also discussed tactics
ranging from sitting in at Lyman's
office to rehiring Franklin with
student funds to disrupting classes of
Advisory Board members who voted
for Franklin's firing.
At Lyman's house the group was
met by several Stanford policemen
including police chief Marvin
Herrington. Several Santa Clara
Sheriff's cars were also in Lyman's
driveway.
The group stayed for about ten
minutes shouting "Marx, Lenin,
Castro, Mao, Hire Bruce! Do it now!"
Gerry Foote also addressed the crowd
and said the rally proved "we don't
need Bruce Franklin to have a
movement here" and that "there's
nothing Lyman can do to stop the
movement at Stanford."
The demonstrators broke up
around 10:15 p.m. and dispersed to
the dorms.
While some professors admitted
they would be glad to see Franklin
leave the faculty, not one said he
expected the Advisory Board to
recommend untempered dismissal.
Many faculty members voiced
concern over possible repercussions in
the academic community concerning
academic freedom and dissent. Nobel
prize-winning chemist Linus Pauling
described the decision as "a great blow
not just to academic freedom but to
freedom of speech."
Art History professor Dwight Miller
conceded that he felt "a little less
secure" of his academic tenure as a

result of the Franklin decision and
added "I think most other professors
will feel the same."
Charles Drekmier, Political Science
professor added, "If tenured
professors can be dismissed for so little
reason then we're all in jeopardy."
Careful Study
English Department Chairman
Carnochan touched on the academic
freedom issue, saying, "I think every
faculty member will be studying the
Advisory Board document very
carefully. If they are persuaded by the
majority report that Franklin deserves
to be fired, there won't be any reason
to think that the decision will inhibit
academic freedom. If upon reading the
majority report the faculty is not
convinced that such strong measures
are in order, this decision probably
will erode academic freedom at
Stanford."
