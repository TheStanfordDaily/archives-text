## Open Recruiting On Campus: A Dissenting View 
### 
(Editor's note: Following is the
first of a two part article written
in response to an ad which
appears on page four in today's
Daily. This article was written and
independently to the Daily after the
author was asked to sign a copy of
the ad.)
The issue of war recruitment at
the Placement Center has been
with us since 1967 when a group
of students and faculty protested
the activities on campus of a CIA
recruiter. Since that time the
matter has never successfully been
laid to rest.
In recent weeks President
Lyman has devoted two KZSU
appearances and a speech before
the Academic Senate to a strong
defense of open recruiting, and
now a group of faculty supports
his position in a Daily
advertisement.
Whether war recruiting should
be permitted or prohibited raises
important issues of the freedom
of the individual to do as he
pleases, as against the right of
constituted authority to prohibit
actions that are harmful to others.
It is in this context that I would
like to examine the arguments of
those who defend open recruiting
on campus.
The first argument advanced is
that a ban on war recruitment «t
the Placement Center would, in
some sense, contravene the right
of members of the community to
hold unpopular views.
The faculty advertisement, in
terms calculated to brighten the
day of even the most jaded liberal,
asserts the necessity of protecting
"the minority who hold

unpopular or, by our lights,
immoral views. . And President
Lyman carries the argument
further when he links those
opposed to war recruiting with a
"heresy-hunt" which has as its
objective the regulation of
"personal, moral beliefs."
No Free Speech Question
But in fact the opponents of

war recruiting have no power
normally and, indeed, no desire to
limit the beliefs of any individual.
Nor is the question of free speech
involved. The ASSU Council of
Presidents has invited
representatives of the war
manufacturers and the military
services to speak on campus. Their
right to present their views on this
campus must, and will, be
protected. But the rhetoric about
a heresy-hunt and the right of the
individual to his own opinion
should fool no one. These rights
are not at issue.
What is at stake is the so-called
right of individuals and firms to
engage in acts that are genuinely
harmful to others. Recruitment is
not speech. Rather, it is the first,
and perhaps the most vital, step in
the process of production.
Without successful recruitment
the weapon cannot be designed

and produced, the gun cannot be
loaded and the bomb cannot be
dropped. In a truly literal sense,
the end result of a recruiting
interview at Stanford may be the
successful destruction of a
Cambodian village.
Non-interference
This brings us to the second
argument of those who favor open

"the opponents of war recruiting have no power and,
indeed, no desire to limit the beliefs of any individual. Nor is
the question of free speech involved. What is at stake is the
so-called right of individuals and firms to engage in acts that
are genuinely harmful to others. Recruitment... is the first,
and perhaps the most vital, step in the process of
production."

recruiting. We are told that the
community must not interfere
with the free exercise of
individual choice. In sober terms
the faculty advertisement warns
us that "the rights of minorities
cannot be dealt with as if they
were only political issues, left to
the exigencies of power." To
prohibit war recruitment "is
nothing short of moral
inspection."
But President Lyman easily
outdoes the scare language of the
faculty advertisement. In his view
we must never permit committees
to impose "prepackaged moral
judgments for individuals." To do
so, he says, would be to permit
the community to be run by
"committees of moral censors."
"I get a bit uneasy," he says,
"whenever Big Brother, in
whatever disguise, starts to claim
the right to make moral
judgements for me — and for
other people."
But sober reflection reveals
that every community imposes
regulations on its members to
prevent individuals from doing
harm to others. And Stanford is
surely no exception. Stanford
students "are expected to
show . .. such respect for order,
morality, personal honor, and the
rights of others as is demanded of
good citizens" on threat of
removal from the University (the
Fundamental Standard).
Moreover, Stanford students may
not cheat, plagiarize, disrupt
university functions, or consume
alcoholic beverages outside
campus residences. Big Brother?

Since when have we begun to
allow Stanford students to make
their own moral choices?
Just the Beginning
But this is just the beginning.
Last year, at President Lyman's
specific request, the Student
Conduct legislative Council
enacted a rule to permit living
groups, by majority vote, to
impose social regulations on their
own members. Is this not "moral
inspection?"
And what are we to make of
the Presidential ban on athletic
contests with teams representing
Brigham Young University? By
Presidential edict our basketball
team may no longer play BYU —
not because its players are guilty
of any objectionable act — but
because BYU is run by the
Mormon Church which refuses to
admit blacks to its ministry. When
BYU was banned from the
campus there was no talk from
Provost Lyman about the exercise
of individual moral choice. The
President made the decision, and
the individual Stanford student
was consequently denied the right
to decide whether or not he

would boycott BYU games, or
whether or not he would picket as
a means of indicating his
disapproval of the Mormon
Church's racial policies.
And now comes the crowning
irony. Despite claims to the
contrary, we do not have "open
recruiting" at the Placement
Center! Two years ago, again by

Presidential edict, the investment
banking firm of Goldman Sachs
was banned from further
recruiting on the Stanford campus
because one of its recruiters had
the honesty (or stupidity) to tell a
minority student that he might
not be promoted as rapidly as
whites. No talk here about letting
students make their own moral
choices. "Moral inspection?" You

bet. And appropriately so, in my
judgment.
And so the whole illogical
house of cards falls down. Despite
the rhetoric about freedom of
individual choice, Stanford (like
all other organizations) is
heavily involved in regulating the
behavior of its members. To put
the matter bluntly, it is

"In short, to trash on campus is unacceptable, but in
Vietnam it is permissible. This is a moral double standard
which I regret, which was rejected last spring by a majority
of those students who voted in the referendum on war
recruitment, and which we must hope the Administration
will also reject."

apparently the Administration's
position that properly constituted
authorities in the Stanford
community may prohibit
activities which are harmful for
the immediate community while,
at the same time, we must not
interfere with war recruiting
activities which result in death to
the people of Southeast Asia.
In short, to trash on campus is

unacceptable, but in Vietnam it is
permissible. This is a moral double
standard which I reject, which was
rejected last spring by a majority
of those students who voted in
the referendum on war
recruitment, and which we must
now hope the Administration will
also reject.
