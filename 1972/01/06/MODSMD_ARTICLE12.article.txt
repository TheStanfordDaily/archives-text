A. THE PROCEEDINGS
President Lyman on March 22, 1971, preferred char
ges against Associate Professor H. Bruce Franklin under
Stanford's Statement of Policy on Appointment and
Tenure, indicating his intention to dismiss Professor
Franklin on the basis of these charges. Pursuant to
Paragraph 1 5 of the Statement, Professor Franklin re
quested hearings on the charges before this Advisory
Board, composed of seven faculty members elected by
the entire Stanford faculty. The hearings covered the
period September 28 to November 5, 1971. Final briefs
were filed by both parties on December 17, 1971; the
Board has also received numerous written statements
from other interested groups and individuals.
The following pages summarize briefly the charges
against Professor Franklin, the standards used by the
Board, findings of fact on the charges, considerations
concerning possible sanctions, and the decision of the
Board as to the appropriate penalty. In accordance with
the Statement, this report has been transmitted to the
President of the University.
B. CHARGES
In summary, the four charges against Professor Frank
lin are:
1) On January 11, 1971, Professor Franklin inten
tionally participated in, and significantly contributed to,
the disruption of a scheduled speech by Ambassador
Henry Cabot Lodge. Such conduct prevented Ambassa
dor Lodge from speaking, forced cancellation ot the
meeting, and denied to others their rights to hear and to
be heard.
2) On February 10, 1971, a war-protest rally was held
in White Plaza. At that rally Professor Franklin urged the
audience away from tactics aimed at influencing govern
ment policy off-campus. Instead he urged and incited
students and others to disrupt University functions by
shutting down the Computation Center. Subsequently a
shutdown was effected by an unlawful occupation of the
Center.
3) Following the unlawful occupation of the Compu
tation Center, Professor Franklin significantly interfered
with orderly dispersal in response to police orders by
intentionally urging and inciting students and others to
disobey the orders to disperse.
4) Following these events, during an evening rally in
the Old Union Courtyard Professor Franklin intention
ally urged and incited students and others to engage in
disruptive conduct which threatened injury to indivi
duals and property. Acts of violence followed.
To establish culpability on the conduct charged, the
Board required as standard of proof that strongly per
suasive evidence be furnished.
C. FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES AND STANDARDS
The Board held the following principles to be applic
able in resolving the issues before it:
1) Rigorous standards of due process should be met
by the hearing and associated procedures, but these need
not be modeled specifically after the criminal (or any
other external) standard. The University context,
whether state or private, is a special one.
2) Similarly, standards for the judgment of what
speech or conduct may properly be regulated may or
may not correspond to those in effect in particular
external legal systems.
3)Regulations should not be vague, since a vague
regulation may leave a person in doubt about what
conduct is permitted; nor overbroad, since an overbroad
regulation prohibits conduct which the Constitution
guarantees as well as conduct which the institution may
legitimately regulate. In the University setting, the ident
ification of proscribed conduct is partly a matter of
tradition and partly codification. The Board believes
that the concepts of "appropriate function" and "duty"
in the Statement of Policy on Appointment and Tenure
do reflect commonly understood and accepted standards
of conduct, including restraints as well as positive obliga
tions. We also affirm that the Policy on Campus Disrup
tions provides an explicit though not exhaustive list of
conduct which is proscribed under the Statement. We
thus do not accept the contention that the rules and
understandings governing faculty conduct are vague or
overbroad.
4) Advocacy is punishable, if it is directed to inciting
or producing imminent lawless action, and is likely to
produce such action; lawless action here refers to con
duct proscribed by state or local laws, by the Policy on
Campus Disruptions or other campus regulations, or by
commonly-held understandings in the University com
munity. Advocacy is also punishable if the advocate
knowingly increases the likelihood of injury to persons.
I). FINDINGS OF FACT
1. Lodge Incident.
The Board accepts as accurate the University admini
stration's contention that the speech to be delivered by
Ambassador Lodge was disrupted to such a degree that it
was reasonable to cancel the meeting before the speech
could be given. This contention does not directly con
nect Professor Franklin with the events that are the
subject of the charge; accordingly, his personal culpabil
ity is not demonstrated by the Board's agreement with
this description. The Board finds strong evidence, how
ever, that a large number of those in the audience denied
others the right of speech, hearing and assembly on this
occasion, and considers such actions destructive to the
fundamental values of the University.
The Board does not, however, feel that it has been
presented with strongly persuasive evidence that Pro
fessor Franklin's conduct included "chanting and clap
ping" as specified in the charges. He did engage in "loud
shouting" on at least two occasions when the rest of the
audience was quiet, and possibly at other times as well,
but there is not strongly persuasive evidence that Pro
fessor Franklin participated in the kind of disruptive
conduct charged, in particular while Ambassador Lodge
was at I he podium. Accordingly the Board unanimously
holds that the specific charges against Professor Franklin
in connection with this incident are not sustained.
2. White Plaza Rally
At the White Plaza rally at noon on February 10,
PmfpQcor FntnUin or»vr thf* concludlne soeech. It was

followed by an illegal occupation of the Computation
Center by several hundred persons, many of whom had
attended the rally. The occupation posed a grave danger
to the facility and the research projects that depend
upon it; there were no explicit group understandings
before the occupation to avoid damage to the machine
or to stored data.
The Board considered the background that provides
context for this rally and the events that followed it.
These included the invasion of Laos, resulting in protests
of various kinds on the campus, and a rally the evening
before in Dinkelspiel Auditorium. At that rally, which
was attended by Professor Franklin and many of the
Computation Center occupiers, the vulnerability of com
puters was discussed and the Center was selected as a
tentative target for the next day.
In light of this background, Professor Franklin had
reason to expect that his speech was given to an audi
ence already prepared for illegal actions. At the conclu
sion of his speech, he said: "See, now what we're asking
for is for people to make that little tiny gesture to show
that we're willing to inconvenience ourselves a little bit
and to begin to shut down the most obviouss machinery
of war, such as, and 1 think it is a good target, that
Computation Center."
The Board does not accept Professor Franklin's argu
ment that he was in fact discussing a "strike" or a
"voluntary boycott"; that was not the main tone of the
discussion at the previous rally, nor is it consistent with
the preparations for action. The Board is thus strongly
persuaded that, given the context of the speech, Pro
fessor Franklin did intentionally incite and urge persons
at the White Plaza rally to occupy the Computation
Center illegally. We therefore unanimously sustain the
University administration's charge regarding this in
cident.
3. Computation Center Incident
After the Computation Center had been illegally
occupied for about three hours, during which time some
damage had occurred and the occupiers had refused
University requests to leave, police declared the occupa
tion unlawful and ordered the demonstrators to disperse.
After police had cleared the building, many persons were
moving away from the building, as ordered, but some,
including Professor Franklin and other members of the
"movement," stayed immediately in front of the police
line near the building, protesting the order to disperse.
When a police official denied Professor Franklin's pro
test, Professor Franklin strode into the crowd, denying
the legality of the police order to disperse and shouting
at Professor Moses to stay as a "faculty observer." Pro
fessor Franklin testified that he believed a police charge
and arrests were almost certain under the circumstances.
After urging Professor Moses to stay. Professor Frank
lin then returned to confront the police officer in
charge; he testified that he addressed only the police
officer and he denied urging or inciting anyone else to
remain. But at least three witnesses testified specifically
that as he turned away from Moses, and with numerous
demonstrators between him and the police 40-60 feet
away, Professor Franklin was urging the crowd to defy
the police order. Professor Franklin produced no wit
nesses who directly contradicted this evidence; most of
his witnesses were close to the police line and could not
observe his actions during this period. Indeed, five of his

own witnesses contradicted his version of the spatial
relationships. As Professor Franklin returned to the
police line, others returned with him, and the general
dispersal of the crowd was reversed. Following a further
brief, angry confrontation between Professor Franklin
and the police, an attempt was made to arrest Professor
Franklin, and the police line cliarged, dispersing the
crowd, with arrests and minor injuries to some persons.
We conclude that the police order to disperse at the
Computation Center was clearly reasonable. We find the
evidence strongly persuasive that Professor Franklin did
intentionally urge and incite others to disobey the order
to disperse, thereby increasing the danger of arrest or
injury to those present, a risk of which many were
unaware. The Board therefore sustains this charge.
Professors Brown and Kennedy, while agreeing that
Professor Franklin's behavior may have induced mem
bers of the crowd to stay, do not find the evidence
strongly persuasive that he intentionally urged and in
cited them to do so, and therefore do not sustain the
charge.
4. Old Union Courtyard Rally
On February 10, 1971, about 350 people attended an
evening rally in the Old Union Courtyard. Speakers
debated demands and tactics. The situation was tense:
there was resentment toward the war, the police, and the
University; the occupation of the Computation Center
and the police charge had occurred that afternoon; the
preceding four days had been marked by arson, false fire
alarms, fire bombing, breaking of windows, bomb
threats, fighting between demonstrators and other stu
dents, disruption of the Trustees' meeting, and occupa
tion of the Old Union.
Professor Franklin made two speeches at the rally.
His first speech, emotional and intense, linked the strug
gle at Stanford with the struggle in Southeast Asia. He
drew parallels between the occupation army on campus
and imperialist forces in Asia. His briefer second speech,
in wliich he urged action that night to bring more police
on campus and thereby relieve police pressure on the
ghettos and barrios, was the last speech at the rally.
There is substantial agreement between Professor Frank
lin and witnesses for the University administration as to
the content of the second speech. Professor Franklin
said that militant action in large groups would be suici
dal, given the number of police on campus. He urged
responding with "the methods of people's war." Profes
sor Franklin said that he "ended by telling people that
people's war meant that they should go back to the
dormitories, organize people into small groups, and talk
with them, or play football, or whatever, as late into the
night as possible." Violent acts followed.
Professor Franklin must have known that the circum
stances under which he spoke involved a high risk of
subsequent violence. He urged responses to the police
and the University at many levels of action. His speeches
sought to generate further hostility toward these targets
and, with deliberate ambiguity, he urged immediate re
taliation against them by both legal and illegal means.
The specific tactics to be used were left to the judgment
and imagination of each individual and small group. His
message included a general call to employ immediately a
range of action including violent and illegal behavior.
The Board is strongly persuaded that Professor Frank
lin intentionally urged and incited his audience to engage

in conduct which would disrupt activities of the Univer
sity community and threaten injury to individuals and
property; it therefore sustains the charge.
Professors Brown and Kennedy, while agreeing thi«t
the situation was one of risk, place a different interpreta
tion on the context of Professor Franklin's speeches.
They do not find the evidence regarding the content of
his second speech sufficient to sustain the charge.
E. SANCTIONS
The Board has considered various elements that might
enter the consideration of penalty, given a finding of
fact that would justify a range of substantial sanctions.
Professor Franklin engages in a pattern of conduct
that constitutes a continual challenge to the institution:
he states that he wishes to encourage violent and coer
cive actions, but at the same time not to risk the loss of
his position in the University. This pattern of conduct,
however, is guided by a set of perceptions which differ
markedly from those of most faculty members: Pro
fessor Franklin views the University as a central agent in
domestic repression and in an imperialist foreign policy.
These facts make it necessary for the Board (1) to
consider carefully what implications Professor Franklin's
pattern of conduct may have for the efficacy of various
possible penalties, and (2) to enter as sympathetically as
possible into the perception of reality he espouses, so as
to make a fair evaluation of such mitigating factors as
necessity and sincerity of conviction.
In applying such considerations, it is important to
balance Professor Franklin's rights as an individual
against those of others in the University upon whom his
conduct may infringe, and against the functional integ
rity of the institution. Where there is doubt, such exter
nal considerations should be applied asymmetrically in
Professor Franklin's favor.
The Board considers probation and very long suspen
sions to be unworkable. The range of penalties from one
quarter without pay to dismissal encompasses substantial
penalties, but in the Board's view that range is justified
by the gravity of the charges.
F. DECISION
The Board, having sustained the University admin
istration's charges involving the White Plaza rally, the
Computation Center incident, and the Old Union rally,
believes that immediate dismissal of Professor Franklin
from the University is warranted. The Board recom
mends that he be paid a sum equivalent to his salary
until August 31, 1972.
Professors Brown and Kennedy dissent from this
recommendation, having sustained only the University
administration's charge involving the White Plaza rally.
They recommend that Professor Franklin be suspended
for one quarter without pay; Professor Kennedy recom
mends an additional quarter of suspension with pay to
extend through June 1972.
Professor Brown has appended an argument against
dismissal even if all charges are sustained.

ally urged and incited students and others to engage in
disruptive conduct which threatened injury to indivi
duals and property. Acts of violence followed.
To establish culpability on the conduct charged, the
Board required as standard of proof that strongly per
suasive evidence be furnished.
C. FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES AND STANDARDS
The Board held the following principles to be applic
able in resolving the issues before it:
1) Rigorous standards of due process should be met
by the hearing and associated procedures, but these need
not be modeled specifically after the criminal (or any
other external) standard. The University context,
whether state or private, is a special one.
2) Similarly, standards for the judgment of what
speech or conduct may properly be regulated may or
may not correspond to those in effect in particular
external legal systems.
3)Regulations should not be vague, since a vague
regulation may leave a person in doubt about what
conduct is permitted; nor overbroad, since an overbroad
regulation prohibits conduct which the Constitution
guarantees as well as conduct which the institution may
legitimately regulate. In the University setting, the ident
ification of proscribed conduct is partly a matter of
tradition and partly codification. The Board believes
that the concepts of "appropriate function" and "duty"
in the Statement of Policy on Appointment and Tenure
do reflect commonly understood and accepted standards
of conduct, including restraints as well as positive obliga
tions. We also affirm that the Policy on Campus Disrup
tions provides an explicit though not exhaustive list of
conduct which is proscribed under the Statement. We
thus do not accept the contention that the rules and
understandings governing faculty conduct are vague or
overbroad.
4) Advocacy is punishable, if it is directed to inciting
or producing imminent lawless action, and is likely to
produce such action; lawless action here refers to con
duct proscribed by state or local laws, by the Policy on
Campus Disruptions or other campus regulations, or by
commonly-held understandings in the University com
munity. Advocacy is also punishable if the advocate
knowingly increases the likelihood of injury to persons.
I). FINDINGS OF FACT
1. Lodge Incident.
The Board accepts as accurate the University admini
stration's contention that the speech to be delivered by
Ambassador Lodge was disrupted to such a degree that it
was reasonable to cancel the meeting before the speech
could be given. This contention does not directly con
nect Professor Franklin with the events that are the
subject of the charge; accordingly, his personal culpabil
ity is not demonstrated by the Board's agreement with
this description. The Board finds strong evidence, how
ever, that a large number of those in the audience denied
others the right of speech, hearing and assembly on this
occasion, and considers such actions destructive to the
fundamental values of the University.
The Board does not, however, feel that it has been
presented with strongly persuasive evidence that Pro
fessor Franklin's conduct included "chanting and clap
ping" as specified in the charges. He did engage in "loud
shouting" on at least two occasions when the rest of the
audience was quiet, and possibly at other times as well,
but there is not strongly persuasive evidence that Pro
fessor Franklin participated in the kind of disruptive
conduct charged, in particular while Ambassador Lodge
was at I he podium. Accordingly the Board unanimously
holds that the specific charges against Professor Franklin
in connection with this incident are not sustained.
2. White Plaza Rally
At the White Plaza rally at noon on February 10,
PmfpQcor FntnUin or»vr thf* concludlne soeech. It was

followed by an illegal occupation of the Computation
Center by several hundred persons, many of whom had
attended the rally. The occupation posed a grave danger
to the facility and the research projects that depend
upon it; there were no explicit group understandings
before the occupation to avoid damage to the machine
or to stored data.
The Board considered the background that provides
context for this rally and the events that followed it.
These included the invasion of Laos, resulting in protests
of various kinds on the campus, and a rally the evening
before in Dinkelspiel Auditorium. At that rally, which
was attended by Professor Franklin and many of the
Computation Center occupiers, the vulnerability of com
puters was discussed and the Center was selected as a
tentative target for the next day.
In light of this background, Professor Franklin had
reason to expect that his speech was given to an audi
ence already prepared for illegal actions. At the conclu
sion of his speech, he said: "See, now what we're asking
for is for people to make that little tiny gesture to show
that we're willing to inconvenience ourselves a little bit
and to begin to shut down the most obviouss machinery
of war, such as, and 1 think it is a good target, that
Computation Center."
The Board does not accept Professor Franklin's argu
ment that he was in fact discussing a "strike" or a
"voluntary boycott"; that was not the main tone of the
discussion at the previous rally, nor is it consistent with
the preparations for action. The Board is thus strongly
persuaded that, given the context of the speech, Pro
fessor Franklin did intentionally incite and urge persons
at the White Plaza rally to occupy the Computation
Center illegally. We therefore unanimously sustain the
University administration's charge regarding this in
cident.
3. Computation Center Incident
After the Computation Center had been illegally
occupied for about three hours, during which time some
damage had occurred and the occupiers had refused
University requests to leave, police declared the occupa
tion unlawful and ordered the demonstrators to disperse.
After police had cleared the building, many persons were
moving away from the building, as ordered, but some,
including Professor Franklin and other members of the
"movement," stayed immediately in front of the police
line near the building, protesting the order to disperse.
When a police official denied Professor Franklin's pro
test, Professor Franklin strode into the crowd, denying
the legality of the police order to disperse and shouting
at Professor Moses to stay as a "faculty observer." Pro
fessor Franklin testified that he believed a police charge
and arrests were almost certain under the circumstances.
After urging Professor Moses to stay. Professor Frank
lin then returned to confront the police officer in
charge; he testified that he addressed only the police
officer and he denied urging or inciting anyone else to
remain. But at least three witnesses testified specifically
that as he turned away from Moses, and with numerous
demonstrators between him and the police 40-60 feet
away, Professor Franklin was urging the crowd to defy
the police order. Professor Franklin produced no wit
nesses who directly contradicted this evidence; most of
his witnesses were close to the police line and could not
observe his actions during this period. Indeed, five of his

own witnesses contradicted his version of the spatial
relationships. As Professor Franklin returned to the
police line, others returned with him, and the general
dispersal of the crowd was reversed. Following a further
brief, angry confrontation between Professor Franklin
and the police, an attempt was made to arrest Professor
Franklin, and the police line cliarged, dispersing the
crowd, with arrests and minor injuries to some persons.
We conclude that the police order to disperse at the
Computation Center was clearly reasonable. We find the
evidence strongly persuasive that Professor Franklin did
intentionally urge and incite others to disobey the order
to disperse, thereby increasing the danger of arrest or
injury to those present, a risk of which many were
unaware. The Board therefore sustains this charge.
Professors Brown and Kennedy, while agreeing that
Professor Franklin's behavior may have induced mem
bers of the crowd to stay, do not find the evidence
strongly persuasive that he intentionally urged and in
cited them to do so, and therefore do not sustain the
charge.
4. Old Union Courtyard Rally
On February 10, 1971, about 350 people attended an
evening rally in the Old Union Courtyard. Speakers
debated demands and tactics. The situation was tense:
there was resentment toward the war, the police, and the
University; the occupation of the Computation Center
and the police charge had occurred that afternoon; the
preceding four days had been marked by arson, false fire
alarms, fire bombing, breaking of windows, bomb
threats, fighting between demonstrators and other stu
dents, disruption of the Trustees' meeting, and occupa
tion of the Old Union.
Professor Franklin made two speeches at the rally.
His first speech, emotional and intense, linked the strug
gle at Stanford with the struggle in Southeast Asia. He
drew parallels between the occupation army on campus
and imperialist forces in Asia. His briefer second speech,
in wliich he urged action that night to bring more police
on campus and thereby relieve police pressure on the
ghettos and barrios, was the last speech at the rally.
There is substantial agreement between Professor Frank
lin and witnesses for the University administration as to
the content of the second speech. Professor Franklin
said that militant action in large groups would be suici
dal, given the number of police on campus. He urged
responding with "the methods of people's war." Profes
sor Franklin said that he "ended by telling people that
people's war meant that they should go back to the
dormitories, organize people into small groups, and talk
with them, or play football, or whatever, as late into the
night as possible." Violent acts followed.
Professor Franklin must have known that the circum
stances under which he spoke involved a high risk of
subsequent violence. He urged responses to the police
and the University at many levels of action. His speeches
sought to generate further hostility toward these targets
and, with deliberate ambiguity, he urged immediate re
taliation against them by both legal and illegal means.
The specific tactics to be used were left to the judgment
and imagination of each individual and small group. His
message included a general call to employ immediately a
range of action including violent and illegal behavior.
The Board is strongly persuaded that Professor Frank
lin intentionally urged and incited his audience to engage

in conduct which would disrupt activities of the Univer
sity community and threaten injury to individuals and
property; it therefore sustains the charge.
Professors Brown and Kennedy, while agreeing thi«t
the situation was one of risk, place a different interpreta
tion on the context of Professor Franklin's speeches.
They do not find the evidence regarding the content of
his second speech sufficient to sustain the charge.
E. SANCTIONS
The Board has considered various elements that might
enter the consideration of penalty, given a finding of
fact that would justify a range of substantial sanctions.
Professor Franklin engages in a pattern of conduct
that constitutes a continual challenge to the institution:
he states that he wishes to encourage violent and coer
cive actions, but at the same time not to risk the loss of
his position in the University. This pattern of conduct,
however, is guided by a set of perceptions which differ
markedly from those of most faculty members: Pro
fessor Franklin views the University as a central agent in
domestic repression and in an imperialist foreign policy.
These facts make it necessary for the Board (1) to
consider carefully what implications Professor Franklin's
pattern of conduct may have for the efficacy of various
possible penalties, and (2) to enter as sympathetically as
possible into the perception of reality he espouses, so as
to make a fair evaluation of such mitigating factors as
necessity and sincerity of conviction.
In applying such considerations, it is important to
balance Professor Franklin's rights as an individual
against those of others in the University upon whom his
conduct may infringe, and against the functional integ
rity of the institution. Where there is doubt, such exter
nal considerations should be applied asymmetrically in
Professor Franklin's favor.
The Board considers probation and very long suspen
sions to be unworkable. The range of penalties from one
quarter without pay to dismissal encompasses substantial
penalties, but in the Board's view that range is justified
by the gravity of the charges.
F. DECISION
The Board, having sustained the University admin
istration's charges involving the White Plaza rally, the
Computation Center incident, and the Old Union rally,
believes that immediate dismissal of Professor Franklin
from the University is warranted. The Board recom
mends that he be paid a sum equivalent to his salary
until August 31, 1972.
Professors Brown and Kennedy dissent from this
recommendation, having sustained only the University
administration's charge involving the White Plaza rally.
They recommend that Professor Franklin be suspended
for one quarter without pay; Professor Kennedy recom
mends an additional quarter of suspension with pay to
extend through June 1972.
Professor Brown has appended an argument against
dismissal even if all charges are sustained.

A. THE PROCEEDINGS
President Lyman on March 22, 1971, preferred char
ges against Associate Professor H. Bruce Franklin under
Stanford's Statement of Policy on Appointment and
Tenure, indicating his intention to dismiss Professor
Franklin on the basis of these charges. Pursuant to
Paragraph 1 5 of the Statement, Professor Franklin re
quested hearings on the charges before this Advisory
Board, composed of seven faculty members elected by
the entire Stanford faculty. The hearings covered the
period September 28 to November 5, 1971. Final briefs
were filed by both parties on December 17, 1971; the
Board has also received numerous written statements
from other interested groups and individuals.
The following pages summarize briefly the charges
against Professor Franklin, the standards used by the
Board, findings of fact on the charges, considerations
concerning possible sanctions, and the decision of the
Board as to the appropriate penalty. In accordance with
the Statement, this report has been transmitted to the
President of the University.
B. CHARGES
In summary, the four charges against Professor Frank
lin are:
1) On January 11, 1971, Professor Franklin inten
tionally participated in, and significantly contributed to,
the disruption of a scheduled speech by Ambassador
Henry Cabot Lodge. Such conduct prevented Ambassa
dor Lodge from speaking, forced cancellation ot the
meeting, and denied to others their rights to hear and to
be heard.
2) On February 10, 1971, a war-protest rally was held
in White Plaza. At that rally Professor Franklin urged the
audience away from tactics aimed at influencing govern
ment policy off-campus. Instead he urged and incited
students and others to disrupt University functions by
shutting down the Computation Center. Subsequently a
shutdown was effected by an unlawful occupation of the
Center.
3) Following the unlawful occupation of the Compu
tation Center, Professor Franklin significantly interfered
with orderly dispersal in response to police orders by
intentionally urging and inciting students and others to
disobey the orders to disperse.
4) Following these events, during an evening rally in
the Old Union Courtyard Professor Franklin intention
ally urged and incited students and others to engage in
disruptive conduct which threatened injury to indivi
duals and property. Acts of violence followed.
To establish culpability on the conduct charged, the
Board required as standard of proof that strongly per

others the right of speech, hearing and assembly on this
occasion, and considers such actions destructive to the
fundamental values of the University.
The Board does not, however, feel that it has been
presented with strongly persuasive evidence that Pro
fessor Franklin's conduct included "chanting and clap
ping" as specified in the charges. He did engage in "loud
shouting" on at least two occasions when the rest of the
audience was quiet, and possibly at other times as well,
but there is not strongly persuasive evidence that Pro
fessor Franklin participated in the kind of disruptive
conduct charged, in particular while Ambassador Lodge
was at I he podium. Accordingly the Board unanimously
holds that the specific charges against Professor Franklin
in connection with this incident are not sustained.
2. White Plaza Rally
At the White Plaza rally at noon on February 10,
PmfpQcor FntnUin or»vr thf* concludlne soeech. It was

followed by an illegal occupation of the Computation
Center by several hundred persons, many of whom had
attended the rally. The occupation posed a grave danger
to the facility and the research projects that depend
upon it; there were no explicit group understandings
before the occupation to avoid damage to the machine
or to stored data.
The Board considered the background that provides
context for this rally and the events that followed it.
These included the invasion of Laos, resulting in protests
of various kinds on the campus, and a rally the evening
before in Dinkelspiel Auditorium. At that rally, which
was attended by Professor Franklin and many of the
Computation Center occupiers, the vulnerability of com
puters was discussed and the Center was selected as a
tentative target for the next day.
In light of this background, Professor Franklin had
reason to expect that his speech was given to an audi
ence already prepared for illegal actions. At the conclu
sion of his speech, he said: "See, now what we're asking
for is for people to make that little tiny gesture to show
that we're willing to inconvenience ourselves a little bit
and to begin to shut down the most obviouss machinery
of war, such as, and 1 think it is a good target, that
Computation Center."
The Board does not accept Professor Franklin's argu
ment that he was in fact discussing a "strike" or a
"voluntary boycott"; that was not the main tone of the
discussion at the previous rally, nor is it consistent with
the preparations for action. The Board is thus strongly
persuaded that, given the context of the speech, Pro
fessor Franklin did intentionally incite and urge persons
at the White Plaza rally to occupy the Computation
Center illegally. We therefore unanimously sustain the
University administration's charge regarding this in
cident.
3. Computation Center Incident
After the Computation Center had been illegally
occupied for about three hours, during which time some
damage had occurred and the occupiers had refused
University requests to leave, police declared the occupa
tion unlawful and ordered the demonstrators to disperse.
After police had cleared the building, many persons were
moving away from the building, as ordered, but some,
including Professor Franklin and other members of the
"movement," stayed immediately in front of the police
line near the building, protesting the order to disperse.
When a police official denied Professor Franklin's pro
test, Professor Franklin strode into the crowd, denying
the legality of the police order to disperse and shouting
at Professor Moses to stay as a "faculty observer." Pro
fessor Franklin testified that he believed a police charge
and arrests were almost certain under the circumstances.
After urging Professor Moses to stay. Professor Frank
lin then returned to confront the police officer in
charge; he testified that he addressed only the police
officer and he denied urging or inciting anyone else to
remain. But at least three witnesses testified specifically
that as he turned away from Moses, and with numerous
demonstrators between him and the police 40-60 feet
away, Professor Franklin was urging the crowd to defy
the police order. Professor Franklin produced no wit
nesses who directly contradicted this evidence; most of
his witnesses were close to the police line and could not
observe his actions during this period. Indeed, five of his

own witnesses contradicted his version of the spatial
relationships. As Professor Franklin returned to the
police line, others returned with him, and the general
dispersal of the crowd was reversed. Following a further
brief, angry confrontation between Professor Franklin
and the police, an attempt was made to arrest Professor
Franklin, and the police line cliarged, dispersing the
crowd, with arrests and minor injuries to some persons.
We conclude that the police order to disperse at the
Computation Center was clearly reasonable. We find the
evidence strongly persuasive that Professor Franklin did
intentionally urge and incite others to disobey the order
to disperse, thereby increasing the danger of arrest or
injury to those present, a risk of which many were
unaware. The Board therefore sustains this charge.
Professors Brown and Kennedy, while agreeing that
Professor Franklin's behavior may have induced mem
bers of the crowd to stay, do not find the evidence
strongly persuasive that he intentionally urged and in
cited them to do so, and therefore do not sustain the
charge.
4. Old Union Courtyard Rally
On February 10, 1971, about 350 people attended an
evening rally in the Old Union Courtyard. Speakers
debated demands and tactics. The situation was tense:
there was resentment toward the war, the police, and the
University; the occupation of the Computation Center
and the police charge had occurred that afternoon; the
preceding four days had been marked by arson, false fire
alarms, fire bombing, breaking of windows, bomb
threats, fighting between demonstrators and other stu
dents, disruption of the Trustees' meeting, and occupa
tion of the Old Union.
Professor Franklin made two speeches at the rally.
His first speech, emotional and intense, linked the strug
gle at Stanford with the struggle in Southeast Asia. He
drew parallels between the occupation army on campus
and imperialist forces in Asia. His briefer second speech,
in wliich he urged action that night to bring more police
on campus and thereby relieve police pressure on the
ghettos and barrios, was the last speech at the rally.
There is substantial agreement between Professor Frank
lin and witnesses for the University administration as to
the content of the second speech. Professor Franklin
said that militant action in large groups would be suici
dal, given the number of police on campus. He urged
responding with "the methods of people's war." Profes
sor Franklin said that he "ended by telling people that
people's war meant that they should go back to the
dormitories, organize people into small groups, and talk
with them, or play football, or whatever, as late into the
night as possible." Violent acts followed.
Professor Franklin must have known that the circum
stances under which he spoke involved a high risk of
subsequent violence. He urged responses to the police
and the University at many levels of action. His speeches
sought to generate further hostility toward these targets
and, with deliberate ambiguity, he urged immediate re
taliation against them by both legal and illegal means.
The specific tactics to be used were left to the judgment
and imagination of each individual and small group. His
message included a general call to employ immediately a
range of action including violent and illegal behavior.
The Board is strongly persuaded that Professor Frank
lin intentionally urged and incited his audience to engage

in conduct which would disrupt activities of the Univer
sity community and threaten injury to individuals and
property; it therefore sustains the charge.
Professors Brown and Kennedy, while agreeing thi«t
the situation was one of risk, place a different interpreta
tion on the context of Professor Franklin's speeches.
They do not find the evidence regarding the content of
his second speech sufficient to sustain the charge.
E. SANCTIONS
The Board has considered various elements that might
enter the consideration of penalty, given a finding of
fact that would justify a range of substantial sanctions.
Professor Franklin engages in a pattern of conduct
that constitutes a continual challenge to the institution:
he states that he wishes to encourage violent and coer
cive actions, but at the same time not to risk the loss of
his position in the University. This pattern of conduct,
however, is guided by a set of perceptions which differ
markedly from those of most faculty members: Pro
fessor Franklin views the University as a central agent in
domestic repression and in an imperialist foreign policy.
These facts make it necessary for the Board (1) to
consider carefully what implications Professor Franklin's
pattern of conduct may have for the efficacy of various
possible penalties, and (2) to enter as sympathetically as
possible into the perception of reality he espouses, so as
to make a fair evaluation of such mitigating factors as
necessity and sincerity of conviction.
In applying such considerations, it is important to
balance Professor Franklin's rights as an individual
against those of others in the University upon whom his
conduct may infringe, and against the functional integ
rity of the institution. Where there is doubt, such exter
nal considerations should be applied asymmetrically in
Professor Franklin's favor.
The Board considers probation and very long suspen
sions to be unworkable. The range of penalties from one
quarter without pay to dismissal encompasses substantial
penalties, but in the Board's view that range is justified
by the gravity of the charges.
F. DECISION
The Board, having sustained the University admin
istration's charges involving the White Plaza rally, the
Computation Center incident, and the Old Union rally,
believes that immediate dismissal of Professor Franklin
from the University is warranted. The Board recom
mends that he be paid a sum equivalent to his salary
until August 31, 1972.
Professors Brown and Kennedy dissent from this
recommendation, having sustained only the University
administration's charge involving the White Plaza rally.
They recommend that Professor Franklin be suspended
for one quarter without pay; Professor Kennedy recom
mends an additional quarter of suspension with pay to
extend through June 1972.
Professor Brown has appended an argument against
dismissal even if all charges are sustained.

A. THE PROCEEDINGS
President Lyman on March 22, 1971, preferred char
ges against Associate Professor H. Bruce Franklin under
Stanford's Statement of Policy on Appointment and
Tenure, indicating his intention to dismiss Professor
Franklin on the basis of these charges. Pursuant to
Paragraph 1 5 of the Statement, Professor Franklin re
quested hearings on the charges before this Advisory
Board, composed of seven faculty members elected by
the entire Stanford faculty. The hearings covered the
period September 28 to November 5, 1971. Final briefs
were filed by both parties on December 17, 1971; the
Board has also received numerous written statements
from other interested groups and individuals.
The following pages summarize briefly the charges
against Professor Franklin, the standards used by the
Board, findings of fact on the charges, considerations
concerning possible sanctions, and the decision of the
Board as to the appropriate penalty. In accordance with
the Statement, this report has been transmitted to the
President of the University.
B. CHARGES
In summary, the four charges against Professor Frank
lin are:
1) On January 11, 1971, Professor Franklin inten
tionally participated in, and significantly contributed to,
the disruption of a scheduled speech by Ambassador
Henry Cabot Lodge. Such conduct prevented Ambassa
dor Lodge from speaking, forced cancellation ot the
meeting, and denied to others their rights to hear and to
be heard.
2) On February 10, 1971, a war-protest rally was held
in White Plaza. At that rally Professor Franklin urged the
audience away from tactics aimed at influencing govern
ment policy off-campus. Instead he urged and incited
students and others to disrupt University functions by
shutting down the Computation Center. Subsequently a
shutdown was effected by an unlawful occupation of the
Center.
3) Following the unlawful occupation of the Compu
tation Center, Professor Franklin significantly interfered
with orderly dispersal in response to police orders by
intentionally urging and inciting students and others to
disobey the orders to disperse.
4) Following these events, during an evening rally in
the Old Union Courtyard Professor Franklin intention
ally urged and incited students and others to engage in
disruptive conduct which threatened injury to indivi
duals and property. Acts of violence followed.
To establish culpability on the conduct charged, the
Board required as standard of proof that strongly per
suasive evidence be furnished.
C. FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES AND STANDARDS
The Board held the following principles to be applic
able in resolving the issues before it:
1) Rigorous standards of due process should be met
by the hearing and associated procedures, but these need
not be modeled specifically after the criminal (or any
other external) standard. The University context,
whether state or private, is a special one.
2) Similarly, standards for the judgment of what
speech or conduct may properly be regulated may or
may not correspond to those in effect in particular
external legal systems.
3)Regulations should not be vague, since a vague
regulation may leave a person in doubt about what
conduct is permitted; nor overbroad, since an overbroad
regulation prohibits conduct which the Constitution
guarantees as well as conduct which the institution may
legitimately regulate. In the University setting, the ident
ification of proscribed conduct is partly a matter of
tradition and partly codification. The Board believes
that the concepts of "appropriate function" and "duty"
in the Statement of Policy on Appointment and Tenure
do reflect commonly understood and accepted standards
of conduct, including restraints as well as positive obliga
tions. We also affirm that the Policy on Campus Disrup
tions provides an explicit though not exhaustive list of
conduct which is proscribed under the Statement. We
thus do not accept the contention that the rules and
understandings governing faculty conduct are vague or
overbroad.
4) Advocacy is punishable, if it is directed to inciting
or producing imminent lawless action, and is likely to
produce such action; lawless action here refers to con
duct proscribed by state or local laws, by the Policy on
Campus Disruptions or other campus regulations, or by
commonly-held understandings in the University com
munity. Advocacy is also punishable if the advocate
knowingly increases the likelihood of injury to persons.
I). FINDINGS OF FACT
1. Lodge Incident.
The Board accepts as accurate the University admini
stration's contention that the speech to be delivered by
Ambassador Lodge was disrupted to such a degree that it
was reasonable to cancel the meeting before the speech
could be given. This contention does not directly con
nect Professor Franklin with the events that are the
subject of the charge; accordingly, his personal culpabil
ity is not demonstrated by the Board's agreement with
this description. The Board finds strong evidence, how
ever, that a large number of those in the audience denied
others the right of speech, hearing and assembly on this
occasion, and considers such actions destructive to the
fundamental values of the University.
The Board does not, however, feel that it has been
presented with strongly persuasive evidence that Pro
fessor Franklin's conduct included "chanting and clap
ping" as specified in the charges. He did engage in "loud
shouting" on at least two occasions when the rest of the
audience was quiet, and possibly at other times as well,

University administration's charge regarding this in
cident.
3. Computation Center Incident
After the Computation Center had been illegally
occupied for about three hours, during which time some
damage had occurred and the occupiers had refused
University requests to leave, police declared the occupa
tion unlawful and ordered the demonstrators to disperse.
After police had cleared the building, many persons were
moving away from the building, as ordered, but some,
including Professor Franklin and other members of the
"movement," stayed immediately in front of the police
line near the building, protesting the order to disperse.
When a police official denied Professor Franklin's pro
test, Professor Franklin strode into the crowd, denying
the legality of the police order to disperse and shouting
at Professor Moses to stay as a "faculty observer." Pro
fessor Franklin testified that he believed a police charge
and arrests were almost certain under the circumstances.
After urging Professor Moses to stay. Professor Frank
lin then returned to confront the police officer in
charge; he testified that he addressed only the police
officer and he denied urging or inciting anyone else to
remain. But at least three witnesses testified specifically
that as he turned away from Moses, and with numerous
demonstrators between him and the police 40-60 feet
away, Professor Franklin was urging the crowd to defy
the police order. Professor Franklin produced no wit
nesses who directly contradicted this evidence; most of
his witnesses were close to the police line and could not
observe his actions during this period. Indeed, five of his

own witnesses contradicted his version of the spatial
relationships. As Professor Franklin returned to the
police line, others returned with him, and the general
dispersal of the crowd was reversed. Following a further
brief, angry confrontation between Professor Franklin
and the police, an attempt was made to arrest Professor
Franklin, and the police line cliarged, dispersing the
crowd, with arrests and minor injuries to some persons.
We conclude that the police order to disperse at the
Computation Center was clearly reasonable. We find the
evidence strongly persuasive that Professor Franklin did
intentionally urge and incite others to disobey the order
to disperse, thereby increasing the danger of arrest or
injury to those present, a risk of which many were
unaware. The Board therefore sustains this charge.
Professors Brown and Kennedy, while agreeing that
Professor Franklin's behavior may have induced mem
bers of the crowd to stay, do not find the evidence
strongly persuasive that he intentionally urged and in
cited them to do so, and therefore do not sustain the
charge.
4. Old Union Courtyard Rally
On February 10, 1971, about 350 people attended an
evening rally in the Old Union Courtyard. Speakers
debated demands and tactics. The situation was tense:
there was resentment toward the war, the police, and the
University; the occupation of the Computation Center
and the police charge had occurred that afternoon; the
preceding four days had been marked by arson, false fire
alarms, fire bombing, breaking of windows, bomb
threats, fighting between demonstrators and other stu
dents, disruption of the Trustees' meeting, and occupa
tion of the Old Union.
Professor Franklin made two speeches at the rally.
His first speech, emotional and intense, linked the strug
gle at Stanford with the struggle in Southeast Asia. He
drew parallels between the occupation army on campus
and imperialist forces in Asia. His briefer second speech,
in wliich he urged action that night to bring more police
on campus and thereby relieve police pressure on the
ghettos and barrios, was the last speech at the rally.
There is substantial agreement between Professor Frank
lin and witnesses for the University administration as to
the content of the second speech. Professor Franklin
said that militant action in large groups would be suici
dal, given the number of police on campus. He urged
responding with "the methods of people's war." Profes
sor Franklin said that he "ended by telling people that
people's war meant that they should go back to the
dormitories, organize people into small groups, and talk
with them, or play football, or whatever, as late into the
night as possible." Violent acts followed.
Professor Franklin must have known that the circum
stances under which he spoke involved a high risk of
subsequent violence. He urged responses to the police
and the University at many levels of action. His speeches
sought to generate further hostility toward these targets
and, with deliberate ambiguity, he urged immediate re
taliation against them by both legal and illegal means.
The specific tactics to be used were left to the judgment
and imagination of each individual and small group. His
message included a general call to employ immediately a
range of action including violent and illegal behavior.
The Board is strongly persuaded that Professor Frank
lin intentionally urged and incited his audience to engage

in conduct which would disrupt activities of the Univer
sity community and threaten injury to individuals and
property; it therefore sustains the charge.
Professors Brown and Kennedy, while agreeing thi«t
the situation was one of risk, place a different interpreta
tion on the context of Professor Franklin's speeches.
They do not find the evidence regarding the content of
his second speech sufficient to sustain the charge.
E. SANCTIONS
The Board has considered various elements that might
enter the consideration of penalty, given a finding of
fact that would justify a range of substantial sanctions.
Professor Franklin engages in a pattern of conduct
that constitutes a continual challenge to the institution:
he states that he wishes to encourage violent and coer
cive actions, but at the same time not to risk the loss of
his position in the University. This pattern of conduct,
however, is guided by a set of perceptions which differ
markedly from those of most faculty members: Pro
fessor Franklin views the University as a central agent in
domestic repression and in an imperialist foreign policy.
These facts make it necessary for the Board (1) to
consider carefully what implications Professor Franklin's
pattern of conduct may have for the efficacy of various
possible penalties, and (2) to enter as sympathetically as
possible into the perception of reality he espouses, so as
to make a fair evaluation of such mitigating factors as
necessity and sincerity of conviction.
In applying such considerations, it is important to
balance Professor Franklin's rights as an individual
against those of others in the University upon whom his
conduct may infringe, and against the functional integ
rity of the institution. Where there is doubt, such exter
nal considerations should be applied asymmetrically in
Professor Franklin's favor.
The Board considers probation and very long suspen
sions to be unworkable. The range of penalties from one
quarter without pay to dismissal encompasses substantial
penalties, but in the Board's view that range is justified
by the gravity of the charges.
F. DECISION
The Board, having sustained the University admin
istration's charges involving the White Plaza rally, the
Computation Center incident, and the Old Union rally,
believes that immediate dismissal of Professor Franklin
from the University is warranted. The Board recom
mends that he be paid a sum equivalent to his salary
until August 31, 1972.
Professors Brown and Kennedy dissent from this
recommendation, having sustained only the University
administration's charge involving the White Plaza rally.
They recommend that Professor Franklin be suspended
for one quarter without pay; Professor Kennedy recom
mends an additional quarter of suspension with pay to
extend through June 1972.
Professor Brown has appended an argument against
dismissal even if all charges are sustained.

A. THE PROCEEDINGS
President Lyman on March 22, 1971, preferred char
ges against Associate Professor H. Bruce Franklin under
Stanford's Statement of Policy on Appointment and
Tenure, indicating his intention to dismiss Professor
Franklin on the basis of these charges. Pursuant to
Paragraph 1 5 of the Statement, Professor Franklin re
quested hearings on the charges before this Advisory
Board, composed of seven faculty members elected by
the entire Stanford faculty. The hearings covered the
period September 28 to November 5, 1971. Final briefs
were filed by both parties on December 17, 1971; the
Board has also received numerous written statements
from other interested groups and individuals.
The following pages summarize briefly the charges
against Professor Franklin, the standards used by the
Board, findings of fact on the charges, considerations
concerning possible sanctions, and the decision of the
Board as to the appropriate penalty. In accordance with
the Statement, this report has been transmitted to the
President of the University.
B. CHARGES
In summary, the four charges against Professor Frank
lin are:
1) On January 11, 1971, Professor Franklin inten
tionally participated in, and significantly contributed to,
the disruption of a scheduled speech by Ambassador
Henry Cabot Lodge. Such conduct prevented Ambassa
dor Lodge from speaking, forced cancellation ot the
meeting, and denied to others their rights to hear and to
be heard.
2) On February 10, 1971, a war-protest rally was held
in White Plaza. At that rally Professor Franklin urged the
audience away from tactics aimed at influencing govern
ment policy off-campus. Instead he urged and incited
students and others to disrupt University functions by
shutting down the Computation Center. Subsequently a
shutdown was effected by an unlawful occupation of the
Center.
3) Following the unlawful occupation of the Compu
tation Center, Professor Franklin significantly interfered
with orderly dispersal in response to police orders by
intentionally urging and inciting students and others to
disobey the orders to disperse.
4) Following these events, during an evening rally in
the Old Union Courtyard Professor Franklin intention
ally urged and incited students and others to engage in
disruptive conduct which threatened injury to indivi
duals and property. Acts of violence followed.
To establish culpability on the conduct charged, the
Board required as standard of proof that strongly per
suasive evidence be furnished.
C. FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES AND STANDARDS
The Board held the following principles to be applic
able in resolving the issues before it:
1) Rigorous standards of due process should be met
by the hearing and associated procedures, but these need
not be modeled specifically after the criminal (or any
other external) standard. The University context,
whether state or private, is a special one.
2) Similarly, standards for the judgment of what
speech or conduct may properly be regulated may or
may not correspond to those in effect in particular
external legal systems.
3)Regulations should not be vague, since a vague
regulation may leave a person in doubt about what
conduct is permitted; nor overbroad, since an overbroad
regulation prohibits conduct which the Constitution
guarantees as well as conduct which the institution may
legitimately regulate. In the University setting, the ident
ification of proscribed conduct is partly a matter of
tradition and partly codification. The Board believes
that the concepts of "appropriate function" and "duty"
in the Statement of Policy on Appointment and Tenure
do reflect commonly understood and accepted standards
of conduct, including restraints as well as positive obliga
tions. We also affirm that the Policy on Campus Disrup
tions provides an explicit though not exhaustive list of
conduct which is proscribed under the Statement. We
thus do not accept the contention that the rules and
understandings governing faculty conduct are vague or
overbroad.
4) Advocacy is punishable, if it is directed to inciting
or producing imminent lawless action, and is likely to
produce such action; lawless action here refers to con
duct proscribed by state or local laws, by the Policy on
Campus Disruptions or other campus regulations, or by
commonly-held understandings in the University com
munity. Advocacy is also punishable if the advocate
knowingly increases the likelihood of injury to persons.
I). FINDINGS OF FACT
1. Lodge Incident.
The Board accepts as accurate the University admini
stration's contention that the speech to be delivered by
Ambassador Lodge was disrupted to such a degree that it
was reasonable to cancel the meeting before the speech
could be given. This contention does not directly con
nect Professor Franklin with the events that are the
subject of the charge; accordingly, his personal culpabil
ity is not demonstrated by the Board's agreement with
this description. The Board finds strong evidence, how
ever, that a large number of those in the audience denied
others the right of speech, hearing and assembly on this
occasion, and considers such actions destructive to the
fundamental values of the University.
The Board does not, however, feel that it has been
presented with strongly persuasive evidence that Pro
fessor Franklin's conduct included "chanting and clap
ping" as specified in the charges. He did engage in "loud
shouting" on at least two occasions when the rest of the
audience was quiet, and possibly at other times as well,
but there is not strongly persuasive evidence that Pro
fessor Franklin participated in the kind of disruptive
conduct charged, in particular while Ambassador Lodge
was at I he podium. Accordingly the Board unanimously
holds that the specific charges against Professor Franklin
in connection with this incident are not sustained.
2. White Plaza Rally
At the White Plaza rally at noon on February 10,
PmfpQcor FntnUin or»vr thf* concludlne soeech. It was

followed by an illegal occupation of the Computation
Center by several hundred persons, many of whom had
attended the rally. The occupation posed a grave danger
to the facility and the research projects that depend
upon it; there were no explicit group understandings
before the occupation to avoid damage to the machine
or to stored data.
The Board considered the background that provides
context for this rally and the events that followed it.
These included the invasion of Laos, resulting in protests
of various kinds on the campus, and a rally the evening
before in Dinkelspiel Auditorium. At that rally, which
was attended by Professor Franklin and many of the
Computation Center occupiers, the vulnerability of com
puters was discussed and the Center was selected as a
tentative target for the next day.
In light of this background, Professor Franklin had
reason to expect that his speech was given to an audi
ence already prepared for illegal actions. At the conclu
sion of his speech, he said: "See, now what we're asking
for is for people to make that little tiny gesture to show
that we're willing to inconvenience ourselves a little bit
and to begin to shut down the most obviouss machinery
of war, such as, and 1 think it is a good target, that
Computation Center."
The Board does not accept Professor Franklin's argu
ment that he was in fact discussing a "strike" or a
"voluntary boycott"; that was not the main tone of the
discussion at the previous rally, nor is it consistent with
the preparations for action. The Board is thus strongly
persuaded that, given the context of the speech, Pro
fessor Franklin did intentionally incite and urge persons
at the White Plaza rally to occupy the Computation
Center illegally. We therefore unanimously sustain the
University administration's charge regarding this in
cident.
3. Computation Center Incident
After the Computation Center had been illegally
occupied for about three hours, during which time some
damage had occurred and the occupiers had refused
University requests to leave, police declared the occupa

debated demands and tactics. The situation was tense:
there was resentment toward the war, the police, and the
University; the occupation of the Computation Center
and the police charge had occurred that afternoon; the
preceding four days had been marked by arson, false fire
alarms, fire bombing, breaking of windows, bomb
threats, fighting between demonstrators and other stu
dents, disruption of the Trustees' meeting, and occupa
tion of the Old Union.
Professor Franklin made two speeches at the rally.
His first speech, emotional and intense, linked the strug
gle at Stanford with the struggle in Southeast Asia. He
drew parallels between the occupation army on campus
and imperialist forces in Asia. His briefer second speech,
in wliich he urged action that night to bring more police
on campus and thereby relieve police pressure on the
ghettos and barrios, was the last speech at the rally.
There is substantial agreement between Professor Frank
lin and witnesses for the University administration as to
the content of the second speech. Professor Franklin
said that militant action in large groups would be suici
dal, given the number of police on campus. He urged
responding with "the methods of people's war." Profes
sor Franklin said that he "ended by telling people that
people's war meant that they should go back to the
dormitories, organize people into small groups, and talk
with them, or play football, or whatever, as late into the
night as possible." Violent acts followed.
Professor Franklin must have known that the circum
stances under which he spoke involved a high risk of
subsequent violence. He urged responses to the police
and the University at many levels of action. His speeches
sought to generate further hostility toward these targets
and, with deliberate ambiguity, he urged immediate re
taliation against them by both legal and illegal means.
The specific tactics to be used were left to the judgment
and imagination of each individual and small group. His
message included a general call to employ immediately a
range of action including violent and illegal behavior.
The Board is strongly persuaded that Professor Frank
lin intentionally urged and incited his audience to engage

in conduct which would disrupt activities of the Univer
sity community and threaten injury to individuals and
property; it therefore sustains the charge.
Professors Brown and Kennedy, while agreeing thi«t
the situation was one of risk, place a different interpreta
tion on the context of Professor Franklin's speeches.
They do not find the evidence regarding the content of
his second speech sufficient to sustain the charge.
E. SANCTIONS
The Board has considered various elements that might
enter the consideration of penalty, given a finding of
fact that would justify a range of substantial sanctions.
Professor Franklin engages in a pattern of conduct
that constitutes a continual challenge to the institution:
he states that he wishes to encourage violent and coer
cive actions, but at the same time not to risk the loss of
his position in the University. This pattern of conduct,
however, is guided by a set of perceptions which differ
markedly from those of most faculty members: Pro
fessor Franklin views the University as a central agent in
domestic repression and in an imperialist foreign policy.
These facts make it necessary for the Board (1) to
consider carefully what implications Professor Franklin's
pattern of conduct may have for the efficacy of various
possible penalties, and (2) to enter as sympathetically as
possible into the perception of reality he espouses, so as
to make a fair evaluation of such mitigating factors as
necessity and sincerity of conviction.
In applying such considerations, it is important to
balance Professor Franklin's rights as an individual
against those of others in the University upon whom his
conduct may infringe, and against the functional integ
rity of the institution. Where there is doubt, such exter
nal considerations should be applied asymmetrically in
Professor Franklin's favor.
The Board considers probation and very long suspen
sions to be unworkable. The range of penalties from one
quarter without pay to dismissal encompasses substantial
penalties, but in the Board's view that range is justified
by the gravity of the charges.
F. DECISION
The Board, having sustained the University admin
istration's charges involving the White Plaza rally, the
Computation Center incident, and the Old Union rally,
believes that immediate dismissal of Professor Franklin
from the University is warranted. The Board recom
mends that he be paid a sum equivalent to his salary
until August 31, 1972.
Professors Brown and Kennedy dissent from this
recommendation, having sustained only the University
administration's charge involving the White Plaza rally.
They recommend that Professor Franklin be suspended
for one quarter without pay; Professor Kennedy recom
mends an additional quarter of suspension with pay to
extend through June 1972.
Professor Brown has appended an argument against
dismissal even if all charges are sustained.

A. THE PROCEEDINGS
President Lyman on March 22, 1971, preferred char
ges against Associate Professor H. Bruce Franklin under
Stanford's Statement of Policy on Appointment and
Tenure, indicating his intention to dismiss Professor
Franklin on the basis of these charges. Pursuant to
Paragraph 1 5 of the Statement, Professor Franklin re
quested hearings on the charges before this Advisory
Board, composed of seven faculty members elected by
the entire Stanford faculty. The hearings covered the
period September 28 to November 5, 1971. Final briefs
were filed by both parties on December 17, 1971; the
Board has also received numerous written statements
from other interested groups and individuals.
The following pages summarize briefly the charges
against Professor Franklin, the standards used by the
Board, findings of fact on the charges, considerations
concerning possible sanctions, and the decision of the
Board as to the appropriate penalty. In accordance with
the Statement, this report has been transmitted to the
President of the University.
B. CHARGES
In summary, the four charges against Professor Frank
lin are:
1) On January 11, 1971, Professor Franklin inten
tionally participated in, and significantly contributed to,
the disruption of a scheduled speech by Ambassador
Henry Cabot Lodge. Such conduct prevented Ambassa
dor Lodge from speaking, forced cancellation ot the
meeting, and denied to others their rights to hear and to
be heard.
2) On February 10, 1971, a war-protest rally was held
in White Plaza. At that rally Professor Franklin urged the
audience away from tactics aimed at influencing govern
ment policy off-campus. Instead he urged and incited
students and others to disrupt University functions by
shutting down the Computation Center. Subsequently a
shutdown was effected by an unlawful occupation of the
Center.
3) Following the unlawful occupation of the Compu
tation Center, Professor Franklin significantly interfered
with orderly dispersal in response to police orders by
intentionally urging and inciting students and others to
disobey the orders to disperse.
4) Following these events, during an evening rally in
the Old Union Courtyard Professor Franklin intention
ally urged and incited students and others to engage in
disruptive conduct which threatened injury to indivi
duals and property. Acts of violence followed.
To establish culpability on the conduct charged, the
Board required as standard of proof that strongly per
suasive evidence be furnished.
C. FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES AND STANDARDS
The Board held the following principles to be applic
able in resolving the issues before it:
1) Rigorous standards of due process should be met
by the hearing and associated procedures, but these need
not be modeled specifically after the criminal (or any
other external) standard. The University context,
whether state or private, is a special one.
2) Similarly, standards for the judgment of what
speech or conduct may properly be regulated may or
may not correspond to those in effect in particular
external legal systems.
3)Regulations should not be vague, since a vague
regulation may leave a person in doubt about what
conduct is permitted; nor overbroad, since an overbroad
regulation prohibits conduct which the Constitution
guarantees as well as conduct which the institution may
legitimately regulate. In the University setting, the ident
ification of proscribed conduct is partly a matter of
tradition and partly codification. The Board believes
that the concepts of "appropriate function" and "duty"
in the Statement of Policy on Appointment and Tenure
do reflect commonly understood and accepted standards
of conduct, including restraints as well as positive obliga
tions. We also affirm that the Policy on Campus Disrup
tions provides an explicit though not exhaustive list of
conduct which is proscribed under the Statement. We
thus do not accept the contention that the rules and
understandings governing faculty conduct are vague or
overbroad.
4) Advocacy is punishable, if it is directed to inciting
or producing imminent lawless action, and is likely to
produce such action; lawless action here refers to con
duct proscribed by state or local laws, by the Policy on
Campus Disruptions or other campus regulations, or by
commonly-held understandings in the University com
munity. Advocacy is also punishable if the advocate
knowingly increases the likelihood of injury to persons.
I). FINDINGS OF FACT
1. Lodge Incident.
The Board accepts as accurate the University admini
stration's contention that the speech to be delivered by
Ambassador Lodge was disrupted to such a degree that it
was reasonable to cancel the meeting before the speech
could be given. This contention does not directly con
nect Professor Franklin with the events that are the
subject of the charge; accordingly, his personal culpabil
ity is not demonstrated by the Board's agreement with
this description. The Board finds strong evidence, how
ever, that a large number of those in the audience denied
others the right of speech, hearing and assembly on this
occasion, and considers such actions destructive to the
fundamental values of the University.
The Board does not, however, feel that it has been
presented with strongly persuasive evidence that Pro
fessor Franklin's conduct included "chanting and clap
ping" as specified in the charges. He did engage in "loud
shouting" on at least two occasions when the rest of the
audience was quiet, and possibly at other times as well,
but there is not strongly persuasive evidence that Pro
fessor Franklin participated in the kind of disruptive
conduct charged, in particular while Ambassador Lodge
was at I he podium. Accordingly the Board unanimously
holds that the specific charges against Professor Franklin
in connection with this incident are not sustained.
2. White Plaza Rally
At the White Plaza rally at noon on February 10,
PmfpQcor FntnUin or»vr thf* concludlne soeech. It was

followed by an illegal occupation of the Computation
Center by several hundred persons, many of whom had
attended the rally. The occupation posed a grave danger
to the facility and the research projects that depend
upon it; there were no explicit group understandings
before the occupation to avoid damage to the machine
or to stored data.
The Board considered the background that provides
context for this rally and the events that followed it.
These included the invasion of Laos, resulting in protests
of various kinds on the campus, and a rally the evening
before in Dinkelspiel Auditorium. At that rally, which
was attended by Professor Franklin and many of the
Computation Center occupiers, the vulnerability of com
puters was discussed and the Center was selected as a
tentative target for the next day.
In light of this background, Professor Franklin had
reason to expect that his speech was given to an audi
ence already prepared for illegal actions. At the conclu
sion of his speech, he said: "See, now what we're asking
for is for people to make that little tiny gesture to show
that we're willing to inconvenience ourselves a little bit
and to begin to shut down the most obviouss machinery
of war, such as, and 1 think it is a good target, that
Computation Center."
The Board does not accept Professor Franklin's argu
ment that he was in fact discussing a "strike" or a
"voluntary boycott"; that was not the main tone of the
discussion at the previous rally, nor is it consistent with
the preparations for action. The Board is thus strongly
persuaded that, given the context of the speech, Pro
fessor Franklin did intentionally incite and urge persons
at the White Plaza rally to occupy the Computation
Center illegally. We therefore unanimously sustain the
University administration's charge regarding this in
cident.
3. Computation Center Incident
After the Computation Center had been illegally
occupied for about three hours, during which time some
damage had occurred and the occupiers had refused
University requests to leave, police declared the occupa
tion unlawful and ordered the demonstrators to disperse.
After police had cleared the building, many persons were
moving away from the building, as ordered, but some,
including Professor Franklin and other members of the
"movement," stayed immediately in front of the police
line near the building, protesting the order to disperse.
When a police official denied Professor Franklin's pro
test, Professor Franklin strode into the crowd, denying
the legality of the police order to disperse and shouting
at Professor Moses to stay as a "faculty observer." Pro
fessor Franklin testified that he believed a police charge
and arrests were almost certain under the circumstances.
After urging Professor Moses to stay. Professor Frank
lin then returned to confront the police officer in
charge; he testified that he addressed only the police
officer and he denied urging or inciting anyone else to
remain. But at least three witnesses testified specifically
that as he turned away from Moses, and with numerous
demonstrators between him and the police 40-60 feet
away, Professor Franklin was urging the crowd to defy
the police order. Professor Franklin produced no wit
nesses who directly contradicted this evidence; most of
his witnesses were close to the police line and could not
observe his actions during this period. Indeed, five of his

own witnesses contradicted his version of the spatial
relationships. As Professor Franklin returned to the
police line, others returned with him, and the general
dispersal of the crowd was reversed. Following a further
brief, angry confrontation between Professor Franklin
and the police, an attempt was made to arrest Professor
Franklin, and the police line cliarged, dispersing the
crowd, with arrests and minor injuries to some persons.
We conclude that the police order to disperse at the
Computation Center was clearly reasonable. We find the
evidence strongly persuasive that Professor Franklin did
intentionally urge and incite others to disobey the order
to disperse, thereby increasing the danger of arrest or
injury to those present, a risk of which many were
unaware. The Board therefore sustains this charge.
Professors Brown and Kennedy, while agreeing that
Professor Franklin's behavior may have induced mem
bers of the crowd to stay, do not find the evidence
strongly persuasive that he intentionally urged and in
cited them to do so, and therefore do not sustain the
charge.

evening rally in the Old Union Courtyard. Speakers

Professor Franklin engages in a pattern of conduct
that constitutes a continual challenge to the institution:
he states that he wishes to encourage violent and coer
cive actions, but at the same time not to risk the loss of
his position in the University. This pattern of conduct,
however, is guided by a set of perceptions which differ
markedly from those of most faculty members: Pro
fessor Franklin views the University as a central agent in
domestic repression and in an imperialist foreign policy.
These facts make it necessary for the Board (1) to
consider carefully what implications Professor Franklin's
pattern of conduct may have for the efficacy of various
possible penalties, and (2) to enter as sympathetically as
possible into the perception of reality he espouses, so as
to make a fair evaluation of such mitigating factors as
necessity and sincerity of conviction.
In applying such considerations, it is important to
balance Professor Franklin's rights as an individual
against those of others in the University upon whom his
conduct may infringe, and against the functional integ
rity of the institution. Where there is doubt, such exter
nal considerations should be applied asymmetrically in
Professor Franklin's favor.
The Board considers probation and very long suspen
sions to be unworkable. The range of penalties from one
quarter without pay to dismissal encompasses substantial
penalties, but in the Board's view that range is justified
by the gravity of the charges.
F. DECISION
The Board, having sustained the University admin
istration's charges involving the White Plaza rally, the
Computation Center incident, and the Old Union rally,
believes that immediate dismissal of Professor Franklin
from the University is warranted. The Board recom
mends that he be paid a sum equivalent to his salary
until August 31, 1972.
Professors Brown and Kennedy dissent from this
recommendation, having sustained only the University
administration's charge involving the White Plaza rally.
They recommend that Professor Franklin be suspended
for one quarter without pay; Professor Kennedy recom
mends an additional quarter of suspension with pay to
extend through June 1972.
Professor Brown has appended an argument against
dismissal even if all charges are sustained.

A. THE PROCEEDINGS
President Lyman on March 22, 1971, preferred char
ges against Associate Professor H. Bruce Franklin under
Stanford's Statement of Policy on Appointment and
Tenure, indicating his intention to dismiss Professor
Franklin on the basis of these charges. Pursuant to
Paragraph 1 5 of the Statement, Professor Franklin re
quested hearings on the charges before this Advisory
Board, composed of seven faculty members elected by
the entire Stanford faculty. The hearings covered the
period September 28 to November 5, 1971. Final briefs
were filed by both parties on December 17, 1971; the
Board has also received numerous written statements
from other interested groups and individuals.
The following pages summarize briefly the charges
against Professor Franklin, the standards used by the
Board, findings of fact on the charges, considerations
concerning possible sanctions, and the decision of the
Board as to the appropriate penalty. In accordance with
the Statement, this report has been transmitted to the
President of the University.
B. CHARGES
In summary, the four charges against Professor Frank
lin are:
1) On January 11, 1971, Professor Franklin inten
tionally participated in, and significantly contributed to,
the disruption of a scheduled speech by Ambassador
Henry Cabot Lodge. Such conduct prevented Ambassa
dor Lodge from speaking, forced cancellation ot the
meeting, and denied to others their rights to hear and to
be heard.
2) On February 10, 1971, a war-protest rally was held
in White Plaza. At that rally Professor Franklin urged the
audience away from tactics aimed at influencing govern
ment policy off-campus. Instead he urged and incited
students and others to disrupt University functions by
shutting down the Computation Center. Subsequently a
shutdown was effected by an unlawful occupation of the
Center.
3) Following the unlawful occupation of the Compu
tation Center, Professor Franklin significantly interfered
with orderly dispersal in response to police orders by
intentionally urging and inciting students and others to
disobey the orders to disperse.
4) Following these events, during an evening rally in
the Old Union Courtyard Professor Franklin intention
ally urged and incited students and others to engage in
disruptive conduct which threatened injury to indivi
duals and property. Acts of violence followed.
To establish culpability on the conduct charged, the
Board required as standard of proof that strongly per
suasive evidence be furnished.
C. FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES AND STANDARDS
The Board held the following principles to be applic
able in resolving the issues before it:
1) Rigorous standards of due process should be met
by the hearing and associated procedures, but these need
not be modeled specifically after the criminal (or any
other external) standard. The University context,
whether state or private, is a special one.
2) Similarly, standards for the judgment of what
speech or conduct may properly be regulated may or
may not correspond to those in effect in particular
external legal systems.
3)Regulations should not be vague, since a vague
regulation may leave a person in doubt about what
conduct is permitted; nor overbroad, since an overbroad
regulation prohibits conduct which the Constitution
guarantees as well as conduct which the institution may
legitimately regulate. In the University setting, the ident
ification of proscribed conduct is partly a matter of
tradition and partly codification. The Board believes
that the concepts of "appropriate function" and "duty"
in the Statement of Policy on Appointment and Tenure
do reflect commonly understood and accepted standards
of conduct, including restraints as well as positive obliga
tions. We also affirm that the Policy on Campus Disrup
tions provides an explicit though not exhaustive list of
conduct which is proscribed under the Statement. We
thus do not accept the contention that the rules and
understandings governing faculty conduct are vague or
overbroad.
4) Advocacy is punishable, if it is directed to inciting
or producing imminent lawless action, and is likely to
produce such action; lawless action here refers to con
duct proscribed by state or local laws, by the Policy on
Campus Disruptions or other campus regulations, or by
commonly-held understandings in the University com
munity. Advocacy is also punishable if the advocate
knowingly increases the likelihood of injury to persons.
I). FINDINGS OF FACT
1. Lodge Incident.
The Board accepts as accurate the University admini
stration's contention that the speech to be delivered by
Ambassador Lodge was disrupted to such a degree that it
was reasonable to cancel the meeting before the speech
could be given. This contention does not directly con
nect Professor Franklin with the events that are the
subject of the charge; accordingly, his personal culpabil
ity is not demonstrated by the Board's agreement with
this description. The Board finds strong evidence, how
ever, that a large number of those in the audience denied
others the right of speech, hearing and assembly on this
occasion, and considers such actions destructive to the
fundamental values of the University.
The Board does not, however, feel that it has been
presented with strongly persuasive evidence that Pro
fessor Franklin's conduct included "chanting and clap
ping" as specified in the charges. He did engage in "loud
shouting" on at least two occasions when the rest of the
audience was quiet, and possibly at other times as well,
but there is not strongly persuasive evidence that Pro
fessor Franklin participated in the kind of disruptive
conduct charged, in particular while Ambassador Lodge
was at I he podium. Accordingly the Board unanimously
holds that the specific charges against Professor Franklin
in connection with this incident are not sustained.
2. White Plaza Rally
At the White Plaza rally at noon on February 10,
PmfpQcor FntnUin or»vr thf* concludlne soeech. It was

followed by an illegal occupation of the Computation
Center by several hundred persons, many of whom had
attended the rally. The occupation posed a grave danger
to the facility and the research projects that depend
upon it; there were no explicit group understandings
before the occupation to avoid damage to the machine
or to stored data.
The Board considered the background that provides
context for this rally and the events that followed it.
These included the invasion of Laos, resulting in protests
of various kinds on the campus, and a rally the evening
before in Dinkelspiel Auditorium. At that rally, which
was attended by Professor Franklin and many of the
Computation Center occupiers, the vulnerability of com
puters was discussed and the Center was selected as a
tentative target for the next day.
In light of this background, Professor Franklin had
reason to expect that his speech was given to an audi
ence already prepared for illegal actions. At the conclu
sion of his speech, he said: "See, now what we're asking
for is for people to make that little tiny gesture to show
that we're willing to inconvenience ourselves a little bit
and to begin to shut down the most obviouss machinery
of war, such as, and 1 think it is a good target, that
Computation Center."
The Board does not accept Professor Franklin's argu
ment that he was in fact discussing a "strike" or a
"voluntary boycott"; that was not the main tone of the
discussion at the previous rally, nor is it consistent with
the preparations for action. The Board is thus strongly
persuaded that, given the context of the speech, Pro
fessor Franklin did intentionally incite and urge persons
at the White Plaza rally to occupy the Computation
Center illegally. We therefore unanimously sustain the
University administration's charge regarding this in
cident.
3. Computation Center Incident
After the Computation Center had been illegally
occupied for about three hours, during which time some
damage had occurred and the occupiers had refused
University requests to leave, police declared the occupa
tion unlawful and ordered the demonstrators to disperse.
After police had cleared the building, many persons were
moving away from the building, as ordered, but some,
including Professor Franklin and other members of the
"movement," stayed immediately in front of the police
line near the building, protesting the order to disperse.
When a police official denied Professor Franklin's pro
test, Professor Franklin strode into the crowd, denying
the legality of the police order to disperse and shouting
at Professor Moses to stay as a "faculty observer." Pro
fessor Franklin testified that he believed a police charge
and arrests were almost certain under the circumstances.
After urging Professor Moses to stay. Professor Frank
lin then returned to confront the police officer in
charge; he testified that he addressed only the police
officer and he denied urging or inciting anyone else to
remain. But at least three witnesses testified specifically
that as he turned away from Moses, and with numerous
demonstrators between him and the police 40-60 feet
away, Professor Franklin was urging the crowd to defy
the police order. Professor Franklin produced no wit
nesses who directly contradicted this evidence; most of
his witnesses were close to the police line and could not
observe his actions during this period. Indeed, five of his

own witnesses contradicted his version of the spatial
relationships. As Professor Franklin returned to the
police line, others returned with him, and the general
dispersal of the crowd was reversed. Following a further
brief, angry confrontation between Professor Franklin
and the police, an attempt was made to arrest Professor
Franklin, and the police line cliarged, dispersing the
crowd, with arrests and minor injuries to some persons.
We conclude that the police order to disperse at the
Computation Center was clearly reasonable. We find the
evidence strongly persuasive that Professor Franklin did
intentionally urge and incite others to disobey the order
to disperse, thereby increasing the danger of arrest or
injury to those present, a risk of which many were
unaware. The Board therefore sustains this charge.
Professors Brown and Kennedy, while agreeing that
Professor Franklin's behavior may have induced mem
bers of the crowd to stay, do not find the evidence
strongly persuasive that he intentionally urged and in
cited them to do so, and therefore do not sustain the
charge.
4. Old Union Courtyard Rally
On February 10, 1971, about 350 people attended an
evening rally in the Old Union Courtyard. Speakers
debated demands and tactics. The situation was tense:
there was resentment toward the war, the police, and the
University; the occupation of the Computation Center
and the police charge had occurred that afternoon; the
preceding four days had been marked by arson, false fire
alarms, fire bombing, breaking of windows, bomb
threats, fighting between demonstrators and other stu
dents, disruption of the Trustees' meeting, and occupa
tion of the Old Union.
Professor Franklin made two speeches at the rally.
His first speech, emotional and intense, linked the strug
gle at Stanford with the struggle in Southeast Asia. He
drew parallels between the occupation army on campus
and imperialist forces in Asia. His briefer second speech,
in wliich he urged action that night to bring more police
on campus and thereby relieve police pressure on the
ghettos and barrios, was the last speech at the rally.
There is substantial agreement between Professor Frank
lin and witnesses for the University administration as to
the content of the second speech. Professor Franklin
said that militant action in large groups would be suici
dal, given the number of police on campus. He urged
responding with "the methods of people's war." Profes
sor Franklin said that he "ended by telling people that
people's war meant that they should go back to the
dormitories, organize people into small groups, and talk
with them, or play football, or whatever, as late into the
night as possible." Violent acts followed.
Professor Franklin must have known that the circum
stances under which he spoke involved a high risk of
subsequent violence. He urged responses to the police
and the University at many levels of action. His speeches
sought to generate further hostility toward these targets
and, with deliberate ambiguity, he urged immediate re
taliation against them by both legal and illegal means.
The specific tactics to be used were left to the judgment
and imagination of each individual and small group. His
message included a general call to employ immediately a
range of action including violent and illegal behavior.
The Board is strongly persuaded that Professor Frank
lin intentionally urged and incited his audience to engage

in conduct which would disrupt activities of the Univer
sity community and threaten injury to individuals and
property; it therefore sustains the charge.
Professors Brown and Kennedy, while agreeing thi«t
the situation was one of risk, place a different interpreta
tion on the context of Professor Franklin's speeches.
They do not find the evidence regarding the content of
his second speech sufficient to sustain the charge.
E. SANCTIONS
The Board has considered various elements that might
enter the consideration of penalty, given a finding of
fact that would justify a range of substantial sanctions.
Professor Franklin engages in a pattern of conduct
that constitutes a continual challenge to the institution:
he states that he wishes to encourage violent and coer
cive actions, but at the same time not to risk the loss of
his position in the University. This pattern of conduct,
however, is guided by a set of perceptions which differ
markedly from those of most faculty members: Pro
fessor Franklin views the University as a central agent in
domestic repression and in an imperialist foreign policy.
