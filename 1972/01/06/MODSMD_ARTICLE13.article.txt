# Fundamental Issues And Standards
## 
### 
Much attention has been paid by the parties to
'Constitutional' questions that may apply to the matter
before us. We here respond to that concern by treating
some of the major issues of this kind that have been
raised in argument and briefs by the parties.
"State Action"
Constitutional standards of due process and free
speech restrain the state. At one point in this proceeding
the University administration expressed the view that
disciplinary proceedings at a private institution are not
necessarily subject to Constitutional protections, while
Professor Franklin has responded that Stanford is in
substantial part publicly financed and publicly regulated
and that the Constitution is consequently as fully appli
cable to Stanford as to an agency of the state. The
merits of these two competing views aside, the Board
does not believe that the disagreement between them
focusses upon the important issues.
Tenure proceedings at all universities, private and
public, involve an attempt to abrogate permanence of
employment for cause.
Tenure, accurately and unequivocally defined, lays no
claim wiiatever to a guarantee of lifetime employ
ment. Rather, tenure provides only that no person
continuously retained as a full-time faculty member
beyond a specified lengthy period of probationary
service may thereafter be dismissed without adequate
cause. Moreover, the particular standards of'adequate
cause' to which the tenured faculty is accountable are
themselves wholly within the prerogative of each
university to determine through its own published
rules, save only that those rules not be applied in a
manner which violates the academic freedom or the
ordinary personal civil liberties of the individual. An
institution may provide for dismissal for 'adequate
cause' arising from failure to meet a specified norm of
performance or productivity, as well as from specified
acts of affirmative misconduct.. . .
. . .This accompanying complement of academic due
process merely establishes that a fairly rigorous pro
cedure will be observed whenever formal complaint is
made that dismissal is justified on some stated ground
of professional irresponsibility, to insure the fair
determination of three facts:
1. that the stated cause is the authentic cause for
dismissal, rather than a pretense or makeweight for
considerations invading the academic freedom or
ordinary personal civil liberties of the individual;
2. that the stated cause exists in fact;
3. that the degree of demonstrated professional
irresponsibility warrants outright termination of
the individual's appointment rather than some
lesser sanction, even after taking into account the
balance of his entire service and the personal
consequences of dismissal.
(Van Alstyne, N. Bulletin oj the American Asso
ciation of University Professors. Autumn. 1971)

Given the essentially identical character of the in
quiry in tenure cases, neither the standards of due
process nor the content of regulations covering speech
need differ between private and public institutions of
higher learning. It is open to a private university to
impose Constitutional limitations on itself as a deliberate
choice of policy; in advance of the hearing the Board
committed itself to at least this much in undertaking to
provide for Professor Franklin "no less protection oi his
Constitutional rights at Stanford than that to which he
would be entitled as a member of the faculty of a state
university." In the opinion of the Board the more
significant questions are: What are the Constitutional
boundaries? What should be the university's policies
beyind the minimum standards set by the Constitution?
We emphasize at the outset that we do not regard the
conduct described in the charges filed by the University
administration to be constitutionally protected against
University discipline. On the contrary, we consider such
conduct to be clearly within the reach of institutional
authority. The university charges that the two speeches
involve advocacy that is directed to inciting or producing
imminent lawless action, and likely to produce such
action. The charge on the Computation Center incident
deals with conduct which might unjustifiably increase
the risk of injury to others.
But this is not all that needs to be said about the
matter. Professor Franklin has also characterized as
"vague" and "overbroad" the charges made against him,
and also the standards set out in the Statement of Policy
on Appointment and Tenure ("substantial and manifest
incompetence, substantial and manifest neglect of duty,
or personal conduct substantially impairing the individ
ual's performance of his appropriate function within the
university community"). Prior to the hearing, the Board
rejected Professor Franklin's challenge on the vagueness
and overbreadth of the charges; at the same time, it
reserved its decision regarding the similar claims directed
to the underlying tenure regulations. The Board now
rejects these claims as well, for reasons we discuss below.
Vagueness and Overbreadth: The State Context
The term "overbreadth," as the parties agree, means
that a regulation encompasses both conduct which the
institution can legitimately prohibit, and conduct which
is Constitutionally protected against such prohibition,
'.e., speech of the sort shielded from governmental
estraints by the First Amendment. "Vagueness" is a
lifferent but related defect which leaves the meaning of
he regulation uncertain, in such a way that a member of
„n institution cannot reasonably judge what conduct is
prohibited and what conduct is permitted.
The simplest level at which an argument of over
breadth may be met is to ask whether the conduct for
which an individual is allegedly culpable under some
regulation is Constitutionally protected. If that were
found to be the case, then obviously the Constitution
would not allow the individual to be penalized under the
regulation because, no matter how precisely and clearly
its terms describe the conduct, the prohibition was
illegitimate under Constitutional provisions. Professor
rnnl'Hn mnlfltoinr -it flir* I pta'irrroc aOQinct

him deal with actions that are Constitutionally pro
tected. He goes further, however, to argue that even if
the Constitution would allow his prosecution for that
conduct in which he engaged, and even if that conduct
were clearly covered by the University's tenure regula
tion, that regulation is inapplicable to him simply be
cause of its overbreadth. This conclusion is argued from
the principle that society places a high value on the free
exercise of speech, and that it can tolerate no "chilling
effect" on this freedom. If a regulation covers both
permitted and prohibited conduct, then it may deter
others from exercising First Amendment rights which
fall under the improperly constructed portion of the
regulation's roof. Even a person guilty of legitimately
proscribable conduct may be rewarded for pointing out
the Constitutional infirmity of the regulation under
which he was prosecuted by relieving him of the con
sequences of his guilt. For the vice of overbreadth, the
institution is forced to invalidate the regulation over its
entire range of application, and to substitute for it a
more narrowly drawn regulation which will withstand
Constitutional scrutiny.
The vagueness doctrine, by contrast, is in substantial
part a canon of ordinary fairness. If a jurisdiction has
not identified a particular kind of conduct as subject to
punishment, it should not then be able to punish
perpetrators of such conduct. Vague regulations may
share some of the disadvantages of overbroad regula
tions, because their indefiniteness may overlap Constitu
tionally-guaranteed zones of activity and deter people
from doing what they have the right to do. Where
indefinite regulations are applied to speech, the vague
ness then invades an activity of such high social utility
that it claims special protection in the Constitution.
Again, it may be justifiable to reward persons who, while
knowingly engaging in activity that the institution may
legitimately proscribe, can show that the regulation is
vague at the border between punishable and protected
conduct. Like the transgressor who points out over
breadth, the identifier of vagueness—even though he
might be guilty under a properly drawn regulation
might receive a benefit for helping to thaw improperly
frozen expression.
Vague regulations introduce other difficulties as well
in a state context. The responsibility for drafting of
governing regulations rests with legislators who are ac
countable through political processes; when they enact a
vague statute, they shift responsibility for the law
making function onto the courts, who must take up the
legislator's abandoned obligations and give the statute
meaning in the course of applying it. Such a transfer of
responsibility might unduly disturb the balance of
powers among the branches of government. Further
more, the law enforcement authorities as well as the
courts have received the responsibility transferred by the
vague regulation, and may thereby he afforded unduly
wide discretion in the selection of whom to prosecute.
Obviously, such freedom might be exercised arbitrarily,
or for the purpose of retaliating against Constitutionally
protected activities. Finally, the adjudicating process
