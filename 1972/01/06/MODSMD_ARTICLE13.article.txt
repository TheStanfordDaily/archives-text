# Fundamental Issues And Standards
## 
### 
Much attention has been paid by the parties to
'Constitutional' questions that may apply to the matter
before us. We here respond to that concern by treating
some of the major issues of this kind that have been
raised in argument and briefs by the parties.
"State Action"
Constitutional standards of due process and free
speech restrain the state. At one point in this proceeding
the University administration expressed the view that
disciplinary proceedings at a private institution are not
necessarily subject to Constitutional protections, while
Professor Franklin has responded that Stanford is in
substantial part publicly financed and publicly regulated
and that the Constitution is consequently as fully appli
cable to Stanford as to an agency of the state. The
merits of these two competing views aside, the Board
does not believe that the disagreement between them
focusses upon the important issues.
Tenure proceedings at all universities, private and
public, involve an attempt to abrogate permanence of
employment for cause.
Tenure, accurately and unequivocally defined, lays no
claim wiiatever to a guarantee of lifetime employ
ment. Rather, tenure provides only that no person
continuously retained as a full-time faculty member
beyond a specified lengthy period of probationary
service may thereafter be dismissed without adequate
cause. Moreover, the particular standards of'adequate
cause' to which the tenured faculty is accountable are
themselves wholly within the prerogative of each
university to determine through its own published
rules, save only that those rules not be applied in a
manner which violates the academic freedom or the
ordinary personal civil liberties of the individual. An
institution may provide for dismissal for 'adequate
cause' arising from failure to meet a specified norm of
performance or productivity, as well as from specified
acts of affirmative misconduct.. . .
. . .This accompanying complement of academic due
process merely establishes that a fairly rigorous pro
cedure will be observed whenever formal complaint is
made that dismissal is justified on some stated ground
of professional irresponsibility, to insure the fair
determination of three facts:
1. that the stated cause is the authentic cause for
dismissal, rather than a pretense or makeweight for
considerations invading the academic freedom or
ordinary personal civil liberties of the individual;
2. that the stated cause exists in fact;
3. that the degree of demonstrated professional
irresponsibility warrants outright termination of
the individual's appointment rather than some
lesser sanction, even after taking into account the
balance of his entire service and the personal
consequences of dismissal.
(Van Alstyne, N. Bulletin oj the American Asso
ciation of University Professors. Autumn. 1971)

Given the essentially identical character of the in
quiry in tenure cases, neither the standards of due
process nor the content of regulations covering speech
need differ between private and public institutions of
higher learning. It is open to a private university to
impose Constitutional limitations on itself as a deliberate
choice of policy; in advance of the hearing the Board
committed itself to at least this much in undertaking to
provide for Professor Franklin "no less protection oi his
Constitutional rights at Stanford than that to which he
would be entitled as a member of the faculty of a state
university." In the opinion of the Board the more
significant questions are: What are the Constitutional
boundaries? What should be the university's policies
beyind the minimum standards set by the Constitution?
We emphasize at the outset that we do not regard the
conduct described in the charges filed by the University
administration to be constitutionally protected against
University discipline. On the contrary, we consider such
conduct to be clearly within the reach of institutional
authority. The university charges that the two speeches
involve advocacy that is directed to inciting or producing
imminent lawless action, and likely to produce such
action. The charge on the Computation Center incident
deals with conduct which might unjustifiably increase
the risk of injury to others.
But this is not all that needs to be said about the
matter. Professor Franklin has also characterized as
"vague" and "overbroad" the charges made against him,
and also the standards set out in the Statement of Policy
on Appointment and Tenure ("substantial and manifest
incompetence, substantial and manifest neglect of duty,
or personal conduct substantially impairing the individ
ual's performance of his appropriate function within the
university community"). Prior to the hearing, the Board
rejected Professor Franklin's challenge on the vagueness
and overbreadth of the charges; at the same time, it
reserved its decision regarding the similar claims directed
to the underlying tenure regulations. The Board now
rejects these claims as well, for reasons we discuss below.
Vagueness and Overbreadth: The State Context
The term "overbreadth," as the parties agree, means
that a regulation encompasses both conduct which the
institution can legitimately prohibit, and conduct which
is Constitutionally protected against such prohibition,
'.e., speech of the sort shielded from governmental
estraints by the First Amendment. "Vagueness" is a
lifferent but related defect which leaves the meaning of
he regulation uncertain, in such a way that a member of
„n institution cannot reasonably judge what conduct is
prohibited and what conduct is permitted.
The simplest level at which an argument of over
breadth may be met is to ask whether the conduct for
which an individual is allegedly culpable under some
regulation is Constitutionally protected. If that were
found to be the case, then obviously the Constitution
would not allow the individual to be penalized under the
regulation because, no matter how precisely and clearly
its terms describe the conduct, the prohibition was
illegitimate under Constitutional provisions. Professor
rnnl'Hn mnlfltoinr -it flir* I pta'irrroc aOQinct

him deal with actions that are Constitutionally pro
tected. He goes further, however, to argue that even if
the Constitution would allow his prosecution for that
conduct in which he engaged, and even if that conduct
were clearly covered by the University's tenure regula
tion, that regulation is inapplicable to him simply be
cause of its overbreadth. This conclusion is argued from
the principle that society places a high value on the free
exercise of speech, and that it can tolerate no "chilling
effect" on this freedom. If a regulation covers both
permitted and prohibited conduct, then it may deter
others from exercising First Amendment rights which
fall under the improperly constructed portion of the
regulation's roof. Even a person guilty of legitimately
proscribable conduct may be rewarded for pointing out
the Constitutional infirmity of the regulation under
which he was prosecuted by relieving him of the con
sequences of his guilt. For the vice of overbreadth, the
institution is forced to invalidate the regulation over its
entire range of application, and to substitute for it a
more narrowly drawn regulation which will withstand
Constitutional scrutiny.
The vagueness doctrine, by contrast, is in substantial
part a canon of ordinary fairness. If a jurisdiction has
not identified a particular kind of conduct as subject to
punishment, it should not then be able to punish
perpetrators of such conduct. Vague regulations may
share some of the disadvantages of overbroad regula
tions, because their indefiniteness may overlap Constitu
tionally-guaranteed zones of activity and deter people
from doing what they have the right to do. Where
indefinite regulations are applied to speech, the vague
ness then invades an activity of such high social utility
that it claims special protection in the Constitution.
Again, it may be justifiable to reward persons who, while
knowingly engaging in activity that the institution may
legitimately proscribe, can show that the regulation is
vague at the border between punishable and protected
conduct. Like the transgressor who points out over
breadth, the identifier of vagueness—even though he
might be guilty under a properly drawn regulation
might receive a benefit for helping to thaw improperly
frozen expression.
Vague regulations introduce other difficulties as well
in a state context. The responsibility for drafting of
governing regulations rests with legislators who are ac
countable through political processes; when they enact a
vague statute, they shift responsibility for the law
making function onto the courts, who must take up the
legislator's abandoned obligations and give the statute
meaning in the course of applying it. Such a transfer of
responsibility might unduly disturb the balance of
powers among the branches of government. Further
more, the law enforcement authorities as well as the
courts have received the responsibility transferred by the
vague regulation, and may thereby he afforded unduly
wide discretion in the selection of whom to prosecute.
Obviously, such freedom might be exercised arbitrarily,
or for the purpose of retaliating against Constitutionally
protected activities. Finally, the adjudicating process
itsrlf (!•!• <T>ri v»v wwiie regulations: both the parties
and the decision maker are at a loss as to how to prepare
the case, what evidence to introduce, what arguments to
make, and what standards to use in deciding it.
Vagueness and Overbreadth: The University Context
These reflections on the briefs and arguments of the
parties regarding the doctrines of vagueness and over
breadth spell out certain problems, but hardly take us
directly to a resolution of the present issues. The legal
material pressed on us by the parties deals with problems
of vagueness and overbreadth in contexts which often
depart substantially from that applying in this case. It is
on this ground that we set aside the cases on student
discipline that both parties have reviewed for us in some
detail. Our examination of these cases persuades us that
the law in this field is incompletely settled; a rapid rate
of contemporary change has generated substantial dis
agreement and a conspicuously confused rationale.
There may be a trend toward enhanced protection, and
an employment of concepts of vagueness and over
breadth similar to those urged upon us by Professor
Franklin. But we recognize important differences in the
relationship between the institution and students, on the
one hand, the faculty, on the other. Students are much
more numerous; their time in the institution is shorter;
their fiscal relationaship with it is entirely different; and
a different tradition of academic freedom obtains. These
difficulties emphasize our conclusion that the problems
of vagueness and overbreadth, as well as other aspects of
the case, must be analyzed with due regard for the
framework—and the atmosphere-of the relation be
tween a faculty member and the University.
We may dispense quickly with two of the difficulties
engendered by vagueness. In some other procedural
system, vague regulations may produce problems in the
preparation, hearing and decision of the case, since none
of the participants can find his way in the fog created by
the lack of underlying standards. However, we consider
the charges in this case reasonably narrow and specific.
In our opinion, they are fully adequate to state an
intelligible conception of the case on the part of the
University administration, give Professor Franklin notice
of the conduct with which he is charged and enable him
to prepare and present his defense, and equip the Board
to shape the hearing and focus on commonly understood
issues. Beyond this, the Board afforded each party the
opportunity to obtain pre-hearing disclosure from the
other party of information and contentions relevant to
the case.
We also do not believe that the role of vague statutes
in unbalancing the separation of governmental processes
is one that need concern us in this situation. The faculty
of the university is a small community, characterized by
face-to-face contact and personal interaction. Legislation
proscribing conduct in a disciplinary context is rare;
when it occurs, it merely codifies previously shared
understandings. While there is clearly some allocation of
function as between faculty and administration, with
ultimate authority retained in the Board of Trustees as a
matter of legal right, interchanges and combinations of
roles are heavily involved in the actual governance of the
university. Faculty members relate to the institution
more through practice and informally negotiated con
sensus than through hierarchically codified rule. Rules of
conduct thus trace their source to slowly evolving
tradition rather than to abrupt acts of legislative inter
vention by persons in positions of formal authority.
Lack of centralization—often aided by small size and
extensive interaction—obviate for the university faculty
the need for the kind of detailed directions that guide
the armies of bureaucrats upon which larger organiza
tions often rely for administering centrally-determined
policies.
There remain the problems of fair warning, of over
breadth, and of undue discretion in enforcement.
Against the background of the relationship between
citizen and state, it is easy to make these issues appear
genuine and substantial. Plainly, it would be intolerable
for the state to provide that a citizen could be im
prisoned for "substantial and manifest incompetence,
substantial and manifest neglect of duty, or personal
conduct substantially impairing the individual's perfor
mance of his appropriate functions within the communi
ty." The situation is different, we believe, when the
public to which similar regulations are addressed is the
faculty of the university. In the more restricted setting,
the regulation invokes a web of largely unwritten rules as
tough and living as the British Constitution. Powerful
traditions, modified by contemporary practice, furnish a
reliable guide to faculty conduct, and entrust review
procedures to faculty peers-in this case, to a faculty
hearing board elected by the faculty. Nothing in those
traditions collides with Constitutionally guarded free
doms. On the contrary, it is the University's responsi
bility to enhance the exercise of rights of speech which
the First Amendment merely protects against govern
mental interference.
We would emphasize the meager record of the aca
demic community's experience with faculty discipline.
This may well be because faculty members chose their
profession in part because they embrace traditional
faculty norms, therefore performing willingly what writ
ten rules coerce in other systems. Indeed, the kind of
written rules contained in court decisions and codes are
not merely responses to the need for prior warning.
They are also the result of society's experience in
enforcing pre-existing norms against a partly recalcitrant
population—as suggested by the maxim that "ignorance
of the law is no excuse." The general practice of
conforming to norms may instruct individual faculty
members about those norms just as clearly as would
occasional cases of discipline for breach of standards.
This wide observance of the norms of faculty conduct
cannot disguise the fact of strong disagreement with
them among some faculty; dissent from a rule, or even
from the entire system of rules, obviously exists, and
must exist to furnish the motive power for necessary
change. But disagreement with a rule is not the same as
ignorance of its terms.
It is perhaps true that a fully-developed code would
be a more readily interprctable guide. But we believe
that the institution and its members would pay a heavy
price for such codification in terms of lost faculty
autonomy and initiative, and in over-bureaucratization.
This detriment should be carefully weighed before the
university accepts regulations spelled out in greater
detail. What we have called the web of unwritten rules of
faculty conduct is not clear or easy to apply in all cases;
on the contrary, there are borderline cases, and intracta
ble problems of application. But codified systems of
rules, too, are inevitably characterized by gaps and
conflicts—and suffer from certain pathologies precisely
because they are written. For example, rules designed to
protect speech by limiting other speech are double
edged; in either direction, they cut into regions that lie
under the protection o<*the First Amendment.

On balance, we favor the present reliance on largely
unwritten standards. But whatever the future holds in
this regard, we find the present understandings adequate
ly clear to guide faculty members in choosing among
various courses of action in particular situations.
Statement of Policy on Appointment and Tenure
The duties of a faculty member include, obviously,
specific teaching and scholarly obligations that are un
derstood primarily in terms of arrangements reached
voluntarily between the individual and his department or
some other institutional unit. Such obligations are gen
erally not spelled out in writing, perhaps because pro
fessors object to formal job descriptions. Nonetheless,
failure to meet commitments of this kind would clearly
constitute "substantial and manifest neglect of duty."
Similarly, "performance of his appropriate function in
the University" means the meeting of the full range of
agreed-upon institutional obligations. Professor Franklin,
in his final argument, characterizes the Statement of
Policy on Appointment and Tenure as being worded so
as to protect the performance of these positive obliga
tions—to enable the institution to weed out the demon
strably incompetent. But the unwritten understandings
discussed above give to the terms "duty" and "appro
priate function" a character of limitation as well as of
obligation. The fulfillment of a faculty member's duty
to his students and colleagues is understood to involve
an obligation to refrain from corrupting the intellectual
transactions that are the essence of the university, and
the other activities that support these. This does not, of
course, mean that he must exhibit political conformity
with the objectives of the institution; the university
must accommodate the questioning of contemporary
goals and structures, and must even tolerate the view
that the university, or the professoriate, should not
survive. There is positive benefit in having on the faculty
active representatives of political views that, while they
may be considered extreme or dissenting here, are held
by large numbers of people in the world and comprise a
dominant form of political organization in many places.
It seems likely that students can get a better education
about the nature of these ideas from proponents than
they can obtain through an exposure only to disengaged
analysts. Proponents are often also proselytizers: that
freedom should be granted also so long as its exercise
does not infringe upon the free choice of others. The
code of the institution does, however, demand that the
speech and conduct of a professor stay behind the line
of inciting or physically causing the impairment of the
institution's functions, especially its function as a forum
in which various other points of view can also be heard.
Policy on Campus Disruptions
The Policy on Campus Disruptions (hereafter called
the Policy) first appeared in 1965. It was a first attempt
to provide more detailed codification of conduct that
might be proscribed on the campus. The Policy was
clearly never intended to list all behavior that a faculty
member might engage in that was against university
policy; indeed, its original authors (the no-longer-extant
Committee on University Policy) did not even aim it
explicitly at faculty, so that it later had to be ratified by
the Academic Senate in 1968. That bit of legislative
history is interesting: although there was some debate
about a linked proposal concerning the judicial mechan
ism for dealing with faculty violators, no member of the
Senate offered dissent to a single substantive element of
the Policy. This episode shows, perhaps more clearly
than anything else, that the Policy was widely and
immediately accepted because it articulated some as
sumptions about appropriate conduct that most faculty
members heid in common.
Another way of illustrating this proposition is to
suppose that there were no Policy. Would the University
then be powerless to take action against a faculty
member for any of the acts described therein? In other
words, do we really insist on requiring that every
proscribed action be named in a document before we
place it on the other side of the line? The Board believes
that the answer to each of these questions is "no." We
have concluded above that there are common under
standings of appropriate faculty conduct, and that con
duct therefore exists which, even though it may not be
listed in an official policy, is nevertheless sanctionable.
With this background, we can consider the specific
conduct of the Policy. It lists several general positive
obligations:
a. to maintain "an atmosphere conducive to schol
arly pursuits"
b. "to preserve the dignity and seriousness of
University ceremonies and public exercises"
c. "to respect the rights of individuals"
The Policy also includes several specific areas of pro
scribed conduct:
a. "to prevent or disrupt the effective carrying out
of a University function or approved activity such
as lectures, meetings, [and] public events. ..
b. "to obstruct the legitimate movement of any
person about the campus or in any University
building or facility."
The Board believes that these provisions provide a clear
statement amplifying and defining some of the concepts
expressed more generally in the Statement of Policy on
Appointment and Tenure. Its applicability to faculty
members is beyond doubt.
Protected pi Punishable Speech: The Relation of the
Policy " to Incitement
We now turn to the fact that the Policy does not
specifically prohibit incitement. The failure to deal with
such speech is not, in the Board's view, the result of a
conscious decision to protect all speech. Rather, it is one
aspect of the history of the Policy, which was formu
lated quickly to meet a momentary need for the articula
tion of certain basic, commonly-held views. The Board
does not accept the argument that the Policy's omission
of a discussion of incitement automatically removes it
from prohibition.
In the Board's view, incitement to illegal conduct—as
we shall define it below-is an abuse of power. Such
abuse is a serious matter in a university, especially when
faculty members are addressing students. We see no
excuse for placing certain conduct beyond the law of the
campus, as the Policy does, and then implying blanket
permission for faculty members to incite others to
engage in that same conduct.
Protected vs. Punishable Speech: Standards
We do, however, see every reason for taking care that
the standard for incitement is carefully drawn, with due
cognizance of those First Amendment protections that
apply to the relation between state and citizen. A wide
range of standards has been offered to us. At one
extreme, we were urged by counsel for Professor Frank

lin that no speech should be punished by the university,
regardless of its incitement to illegal acts. At the other,
we might have ruled sanctionable the advocacy of
vaguely-defined violent action proposed for some time in
the indefinite future. In ruling on the White Plaza and
Old Union speeches, we shall meet a standard suggested
by the Supreme Court decision discussed at length by
the parties in this case. The court in Brandenburg vs.
Ohio (395 US 444) held that to be punishable, advocacy
must "be directed to inciting or producing imminent
lawless action, and. . .likely to produce such action." A
vague exhortation is not punishable under such a stand
ard; on the other extreme it is clearly unreasonable to
demand, as did counsel for Professor Franklin, that there
be an exact correspondence between specific acts advo
cated and those that follow. Subsequent illegal acts arc
not in fact required for incitement to be punishable
under this standard. Such acts might, for example, have
been prevented by external circumstances, or illegal acts
might occur but differ from those advocated. Subse
quent acts are useful in determining the level and
character of risk that obtained at the time of the alleged
incitement. In judging the applicability of the standard
cited, the Board has been guided by the following
considerations:
a. What is the entire context surrounding the alleged
incitement, including the immediate risk of lawless
action?
b. What is specifically being communicated to the
audience?
c. What did the speaker intend? We judge intent on
the basis of the speaker's own knowledge of the
context for his speech, his awareness of the level of
the risk, and the words he actually used.
In the application of this standard, punishable advocacy
need not identify particular acts, but it must include
advocacy of lawless conduct. Inclusion of advocacy of
legal acts with advocacy of lawless conduct does not
immunize that advocacy from punishment. In the appli
cation of this standard to the campus, it is clear that
"lawless action" refers to acts against the law of the
campus, that is, to conduct proscribed by the Policy or
University regulations, or clearly prohibited under the
kind of common understanding of conduct discussed
above.
With respect to the Computation Center incident, the
Board has applied a different standard.Professor Frank
lin is charged with intentionally inciting students and
others to disregard and disobey a police order to dis
perse. If, knowing the risk, he increased the risk of
personal injury to other persons, some of whom were
unaware of the risk, then his conduct is punishable.
Incitement need not be directed to increasing the likeli
hood of illegal conduct; it may also be punishable if it
places persons at heightened physical risk, as with the
cry of "fire" in a crowded theatre. Such speech is clearly
not Constitutionally protected.
It may be argued that the university should allow
more scope than the Constitution, or the current de
mands of society, would require; indeed, it has been put
to us that the university should not undertake to restrain
speech at all. We believe the university's prohibition of
incitement, given the criteria of intent, risk and immi
nence discussed above, is fully justified when speech
threatens two central university interests: (1) protection
of members of the university community and university
facilities against risks of serious injury or damage; (2)
protection against coercive intrusion on the intellectual
transactions which the university seeks to foster.

We observe also that in taking this position we have
rejected a formulation urged upon us by a group of
intervening faculty. In their view, dismissal from a
tenured position is warranted only for "failure to per
form the duties for which one was hired-teaching,
and/or research. .or for previous conviction of "some
criminal act." We believe it is inappropriate to tie tenure
proceedings to the criminal process. The standard sug
gested by the interveners would, to be sure, relieve the
Board of the difficult obligation to construct a narrative
of disputed events as a basis for judgment. However
desirable that might be, we find it almost the only virtue
in their position. A criminal proceeding may require
several years to resolve, and it may terminate favorably
to the accused for reasons which have nothing to do
with a faculty member's fitness to retain his position. It
is not obvious why the university should be dependent
on external prosecution policy, which may respond to a
number of factors but which is unlikely to reflect any
sensitive judgment of university interests as a central
concern. It does seem clear that sound decisions, on the
issue ol penalty perhaps even more than on the issue of
culpability, under university standards, will require the
kind ol intimate familiarity with the facts of a case that
can be best provided by professional peers. On this basis,
the mere tact ol conviction of criminal offenses could be
a wholly insufficient guide to wise disposition within the
university.
Relation oj Speech to the Institution
Lastly, we turn to the circumstances under which
speech occurs, and to the relationship between those
circumstances and the 'duty' and 'appropriate function'
ol the speaker. Speech and conduct by faculty members
have in other cases been treated according to different
standards depending upon whether they were judged to
be connected with the faculty member's duties or
unrelated to them.
Professor Franklin has applied the term "extracurri
cular" to his speech at the two rallies. The Board cannot
agree with this use of the term, if by it Professor
Franklin intends to place the speeches in question
outside the framework of his duties and appropriate
function in the university. There is a degree of differ
ence, to be sure, bewteen speech in the classroom and
speech outside it; it may reasonably be held, for exam
ple, that explicit advocacy of a political position un
related to the subject matter of a course is improper
when delivered in front of a class, but is not when
delivered at a rally outside the classroom door. But that
view does not automatically remove all activities that
take place outside the classroom door from the reach of
institutional regulation. In a residential university, facul
ty members relate professionally to students in many
ways: in offices, at the dinner table, in informal advising
situations, and so on. These relationships certainly do
not resemble contacts between that faculty member and
citizens on a downtown street. We believe that the ,
speech of a faculty member to a campus audience on
campus issues is subject to regulations, though the
standard applied to it will be different from that applied
to a classroom situation. Indeed, the location of the
recommended target may equally serve to define speech
in relation to the institution: a faculty member inciting
an off-campus crowd to occupy a university building
illegally is, in our view, liable to institutional regulation.
We will now consider the specific charges in the light
of these standards.
Much attention has been paid by the parties to
'Constitutional' questions that may apply to the matter
before us. We here respond to that concern by treating
some of the major issues of this kind that have been
raised in argument and briefs by the parties.
"State Action"
Constitutional standards of due process and free
speech restrain the state. At one point in this proceeding
the University administration expressed the view that
disciplinary proceedings at a private institution are not
necessarily subject to Constitutional protections, while
Professor Franklin has responded that Stanford is in
substantial part publicly financed and publicly regulated
and that the Constitution is consequently as fully appli
cable to Stanford as to an agency of the state. The
merits of these two competing views aside, the Board
does not believe that the disagreement between them
focusses upon the important issues.
Tenure proceedings at all universities, private and
public, involve an attempt to abrogate permanence of
employment for cause.
Tenure, accurately and unequivocally defined, lays no
claim wiiatever to a guarantee of lifetime employ
ment. Rather, tenure provides only that no person
continuously retained as a full-time faculty member
beyond a specified lengthy period of probationary
service may thereafter be dismissed without adequate
cause. Moreover, the particular standards of'adequate
cause' to which the tenured faculty is accountable are
themselves wholly within the prerogative of each
university to determine through its own published
rules, save only that those rules not be applied in a
manner which violates the academic freedom or the
ordinary personal civil liberties of the individual. An
institution may provide for dismissal for 'adequate
cause' arising from failure to meet a specified norm of
performance or productivity, as well as from specified
acts of affirmative misconduct.. . .
. . .This accompanying complement of academic due
process merely establishes that a fairly rigorous pro
cedure will be observed whenever formal complaint is
made that dismissal is justified on some stated ground
of professional irresponsibility, to insure the fair
determination of three facts:
1. that the stated cause is the authentic cause for
dismissal, rather than a pretense or makeweight for
considerations invading the academic freedom or
ordinary personal civil liberties of the individual;
2. that the stated cause exists in fact;
3. that the degree of demonstrated professional
irresponsibility warrants outright termination of
the individual's appointment rather than some
lesser sanction, even after taking into account the
balance of his entire service and the personal
consequences of dismissal.
(Van Alstyne, N. Bulletin oj the American Asso
ciation of University Professors. Autumn. 1971)

Given the essentially identical character of the in
quiry in tenure cases, neither the standards of due
process nor the content of regulations covering speech
need differ between private and public institutions of
higher learning. It is open to a private university to
impose Constitutional limitations on itself as a deliberate
choice of policy; in advance of the hearing the Board
committed itself to at least this much in undertaking to
provide for Professor Franklin "no less protection oi his
Constitutional rights at Stanford than that to which he
would be entitled as a member of the faculty of a state
university." In the opinion of the Board the more
significant questions are: What are the Constitutional
boundaries? What should be the university's policies
beyind the minimum standards set by the Constitution?
We emphasize at the outset that we do not regard the
conduct described in the charges filed by the University
administration to be constitutionally protected against
University discipline. On the contrary, we consider such
conduct to be clearly within the reach of institutional
authority. The university charges that the two speeches
involve advocacy that is directed to inciting or producing
imminent lawless action, and likely to produce such
action. The charge on the Computation Center incident
deals with conduct which might unjustifiably increase
the risk of injury to others.
But this is not all that needs to be said about the
matter. Professor Franklin has also characterized as
"vague" and "overbroad" the charges made against him,
and also the standards set out in the Statement of Policy
on Appointment and Tenure ("substantial and manifest
incompetence, substantial and manifest neglect of duty,
or personal conduct substantially impairing the individ
ual's performance of his appropriate function within the
university community"). Prior to the hearing, the Board
rejected Professor Franklin's challenge on the vagueness
and overbreadth of the charges; at the same time, it
reserved its decision regarding the similar claims directed
to the underlying tenure regulations. The Board now
rejects these claims as well, for reasons we discuss below.
Vagueness and Overbreadth: The State Context
The term "overbreadth," as the parties agree, means
that a regulation encompasses both conduct which the
institution can legitimately prohibit, and conduct which
is Constitutionally protected against such prohibition,
'.e., speech of the sort shielded from governmental
estraints by the First Amendment. "Vagueness" is a
lifferent but related defect which leaves the meaning of
he regulation uncertain, in such a way that a member of
„n institution cannot reasonably judge what conduct is
prohibited and what conduct is permitted.
The simplest level at which an argument of over
breadth may be met is to ask whether the conduct for
which an individual is allegedly culpable under some
regulation is Constitutionally protected. If that were
found to be the case, then obviously the Constitution
would not allow the individual to be penalized under the
regulation because, no matter how precisely and clearly
its terms describe the conduct, the prohibition was
illegitimate under Constitutional provisions. Professor
rnnl'Hn mnlfltoinr -it flir* I pta'irrroc aOQinct

him deal with actions that are Constitutionally pro
tected. He goes further, however, to argue that even if
the Constitution would allow his prosecution for that
conduct in which he engaged, and even if that conduct
were clearly covered by the University's tenure regula
tion, that regulation is inapplicable to him simply be
cause of its overbreadth. This conclusion is argued from
the principle that society places a high value on the free
exercise of speech, and that it can tolerate no "chilling
effect" on this freedom. If a regulation covers both
permitted and prohibited conduct, then it may deter
others from exercising First Amendment rights which
fall under the improperly constructed portion of the
regulation's roof. Even a person guilty of legitimately
proscribable conduct may be rewarded for pointing out
the Constitutional infirmity of the regulation under
which he was prosecuted by relieving him of the con
sequences of his guilt. For the vice of overbreadth, the
institution is forced to invalidate the regulation over its
entire range of application, and to substitute for it a
more narrowly drawn regulation which will withstand
Constitutional scrutiny.
The vagueness doctrine, by contrast, is in substantial
part a canon of ordinary fairness. If a jurisdiction has
not identified a particular kind of conduct as subject to
punishment, it should not then be able to punish
perpetrators of such conduct. Vague regulations may
share some of the disadvantages of overbroad regula
tions, because their indefiniteness may overlap Constitu
tionally-guaranteed zones of activity and deter people
from doing what they have the right to do. Where
indefinite regulations are applied to speech, the vague
ness then invades an activity of such high social utility
that it claims special protection in the Constitution.
Again, it may be justifiable to reward persons who, while
knowingly engaging in activity that the institution may
legitimately proscribe, can show that the regulation is
vague at the border between punishable and protected
conduct. Like the transgressor who points out over
breadth, the identifier of vagueness—even though he
might be guilty under a properly drawn regulation
might receive a benefit for helping to thaw improperly
frozen expression.
Vague regulations introduce other difficulties as well
in a state context. The responsibility for drafting of
governing regulations rests with legislators who are ac
countable through political processes; when they enact a
vague statute, they shift responsibility for the law
making function onto the courts, who must take up the
legislator's abandoned obligations and give the statute
meaning in the course of applying it. Such a transfer of
responsibility might unduly disturb the balance of
powers among the branches of government. Further
more, the law enforcement authorities as well as the
courts have received the responsibility transferred by the
vague regulation, and may thereby he afforded unduly
wide discretion in the selection of whom to prosecute.
Obviously, such freedom might be exercised arbitrarily,
or for the purpose of retaliating against Constitutionally
protected activities. Finally, the adjudicating process
itsrlf (!•!• <T>ri v»v wwiie regulations: both the parties
and the decision maker are at a loss as to how to prepare
the case, what evidence to introduce, what arguments to
make, and what standards to use in deciding it.
Vagueness and Overbreadth: The University Context
These reflections on the briefs and arguments of the
parties regarding the doctrines of vagueness and over
breadth spell out certain problems, but hardly take us
directly to a resolution of the present issues. The legal
material pressed on us by the parties deals with problems
of vagueness and overbreadth in contexts which often
depart substantially from that applying in this case. It is
on this ground that we set aside the cases on student
discipline that both parties have reviewed for us in some
detail. Our examination of these cases persuades us that
the law in this field is incompletely settled; a rapid rate
of contemporary change has generated substantial dis
agreement and a conspicuously confused rationale.
There may be a trend toward enhanced protection, and
an employment of concepts of vagueness and over
breadth similar to those urged upon us by Professor
Franklin. But we recognize important differences in the
relationship between the institution and students, on the
one hand, the faculty, on the other. Students are much
more numerous; their time in the institution is shorter;
their fiscal relationaship with it is entirely different; and
a different tradition of academic freedom obtains. These
difficulties emphasize our conclusion that the problems
of vagueness and overbreadth, as well as other aspects of
the case, must be analyzed with due regard for the
framework—and the atmosphere-of the relation be
tween a faculty member and the University.
We may dispense quickly with two of the difficulties
engendered by vagueness. In some other procedural
system, vague regulations may produce problems in the
preparation, hearing and decision of the case, since none
of the participants can find his way in the fog created by
the lack of underlying standards. However, we consider
the charges in this case reasonably narrow and specific.
In our opinion, they are fully adequate to state an
intelligible conception of the case on the part of the
University administration, give Professor Franklin notice
of the conduct with which he is charged and enable him
to prepare and present his defense, and equip the Board
to shape the hearing and focus on commonly understood
issues. Beyond this, the Board afforded each party the
opportunity to obtain pre-hearing disclosure from the
other party of information and contentions relevant to
the case.
We also do not believe that the role of vague statutes
in unbalancing the separation of governmental processes
is one that need concern us in this situation. The faculty
of the university is a small community, characterized by
face-to-face contact and personal interaction. Legislation
proscribing conduct in a disciplinary context is rare;
when it occurs, it merely codifies previously shared
understandings. While there is clearly some allocation of
function as between faculty and administration, with
ultimate authority retained in the Board of Trustees as a
matter of legal right, interchanges and combinations of
roles are heavily involved in the actual governance of the
university. Faculty members relate to the institution
more through practice and informally negotiated con
sensus than through hierarchically codified rule. Rules of
conduct thus trace their source to slowly evolving
tradition rather than to abrupt acts of legislative inter
vention by persons in positions of formal authority.
Lack of centralization—often aided by small size and
extensive interaction—obviate for the university faculty
the need for the kind of detailed directions that guide
the armies of bureaucrats upon which larger organiza
tions often rely for administering centrally-determined
policies.
There remain the problems of fair warning, of over
breadth, and of undue discretion in enforcement.
Against the background of the relationship between
citizen and state, it is easy to make these issues appear
genuine and substantial. Plainly, it would be intolerable
for the state to provide that a citizen could be im
prisoned for "substantial and manifest incompetence,
substantial and manifest neglect of duty, or personal
conduct substantially impairing the individual's perfor
mance of his appropriate functions within the communi
ty." The situation is different, we believe, when the
public to which similar regulations are addressed is the
faculty of the university. In the more restricted setting,
the regulation invokes a web of largely unwritten rules as
tough and living as the British Constitution. Powerful
traditions, modified by contemporary practice, furnish a
reliable guide to faculty conduct, and entrust review
procedures to faculty peers-in this case, to a faculty
hearing board elected by the faculty. Nothing in those
traditions collides with Constitutionally guarded free
doms. On the contrary, it is the University's responsi
bility to enhance the exercise of rights of speech which
the First Amendment merely protects against govern
mental interference.
We would emphasize the meager record of the aca
demic community's experience with faculty discipline.
This may well be because faculty members chose their
profession in part because they embrace traditional
faculty norms, therefore performing willingly what writ
ten rules coerce in other systems. Indeed, the kind of
written rules contained in court decisions and codes are
not merely responses to the need for prior warning.
They are also the result of society's experience in
enforcing pre-existing norms against a partly recalcitrant
population—as suggested by the maxim that "ignorance
of the law is no excuse." The general practice of
conforming to norms may instruct individual faculty
members about those norms just as clearly as would
occasional cases of discipline for breach of standards.
This wide observance of the norms of faculty conduct
cannot disguise the fact of strong disagreement with
them among some faculty; dissent from a rule, or even
from the entire system of rules, obviously exists, and
must exist to furnish the motive power for necessary
change. But disagreement with a rule is not the same as
ignorance of its terms.
It is perhaps true that a fully-developed code would
be a more readily interprctable guide. But we believe
that the institution and its members would pay a heavy
price for such codification in terms of lost faculty
autonomy and initiative, and in over-bureaucratization.
This detriment should be carefully weighed before the
university accepts regulations spelled out in greater
detail. What we have called the web of unwritten rules of
faculty conduct is not clear or easy to apply in all cases;
on the contrary, there are borderline cases, and intracta
ble problems of application. But codified systems of
rules, too, are inevitably characterized by gaps and
conflicts—and suffer from certain pathologies precisely
because they are written. For example, rules designed to
protect speech by limiting other speech are double
edged; in either direction, they cut into regions that lie
under the protection o<*the First Amendment.

On balance, we favor the present reliance on largely
unwritten standards. But whatever the future holds in
this regard, we find the present understandings adequate
ly clear to guide faculty members in choosing among
various courses of action in particular situations.
Statement of Policy on Appointment and Tenure
The duties of a faculty member include, obviously,
specific teaching and scholarly obligations that are un
derstood primarily in terms of arrangements reached
voluntarily between the individual and his department or
some other institutional unit. Such obligations are gen
erally not spelled out in writing, perhaps because pro
fessors object to formal job descriptions. Nonetheless,
failure to meet commitments of this kind would clearly
constitute "substantial and manifest neglect of duty."
Similarly, "performance of his appropriate function in
the University" means the meeting of the full range of
agreed-upon institutional obligations. Professor Franklin,
in his final argument, characterizes the Statement of
Policy on Appointment and Tenure as being worded so
as to protect the performance of these positive obliga
tions—to enable the institution to weed out the demon
strably incompetent. But the unwritten understandings
discussed above give to the terms "duty" and "appro
priate function" a character of limitation as well as of
obligation. The fulfillment of a faculty member's duty
to his students and colleagues is understood to involve
an obligation to refrain from corrupting the intellectual
transactions that are the essence of the university, and
the other activities that support these. This does not, of
course, mean that he must exhibit political conformity
with the objectives of the institution; the university
must accommodate the questioning of contemporary
goals and structures, and must even tolerate the view
that the university, or the professoriate, should not
survive. There is positive benefit in having on the faculty
active representatives of political views that, while they
may be considered extreme or dissenting here, are held
by large numbers of people in the world and comprise a
dominant form of political organization in many places.
It seems likely that students can get a better education
about the nature of these ideas from proponents than
they can obtain through an exposure only to disengaged
analysts. Proponents are often also proselytizers: that
freedom should be granted also so long as its exercise
does not infringe upon the free choice of others. The
code of the institution does, however, demand that the
speech and conduct of a professor stay behind the line
of inciting or physically causing the impairment of the
institution's functions, especially its function as a forum
in which various other points of view can also be heard.
Policy on Campus Disruptions
The Policy on Campus Disruptions (hereafter called
the Policy) first appeared in 1965. It was a first attempt
to provide more detailed codification of conduct that
might be proscribed on the campus. The Policy was
clearly never intended to list all behavior that a faculty
member might engage in that was against university
policy; indeed, its original authors (the no-longer-extant
Committee on University Policy) did not even aim it
explicitly at faculty, so that it later had to be ratified by
the Academic Senate in 1968. That bit of legislative
history is interesting: although there was some debate
about a linked proposal concerning the judicial mechan
ism for dealing with faculty violators, no member of the
Senate offered dissent to a single substantive element of
the Policy. This episode shows, perhaps more clearly
than anything else, that the Policy was widely and
immediately accepted because it articulated some as
sumptions about appropriate conduct that most faculty
members heid in common.
Another way of illustrating this proposition is to
suppose that there were no Policy. Would the University
then be powerless to take action against a faculty
member for any of the acts described therein? In other
words, do we really insist on requiring that every
proscribed action be named in a document before we
place it on the other side of the line? The Board believes
that the answer to each of these questions is "no." We
have concluded above that there are common under
standings of appropriate faculty conduct, and that con
duct therefore exists which, even though it may not be
listed in an official policy, is nevertheless sanctionable.
With this background, we can consider the specific
conduct of the Policy. It lists several general positive
obligations:
a. to maintain "an atmosphere conducive to schol
arly pursuits"
b. "to preserve the dignity and seriousness of
University ceremonies and public exercises"
c. "to respect the rights of individuals"
The Policy also includes several specific areas of pro
scribed conduct:
a. "to prevent or disrupt the effective carrying out
of a University function or approved activity such
as lectures, meetings, [and] public events. ..
b. "to obstruct the legitimate movement of any
person about the campus or in any University
building or facility."
The Board believes that these provisions provide a clear
statement amplifying and defining some of the concepts
expressed more generally in the Statement of Policy on
Appointment and Tenure. Its applicability to faculty
members is beyond doubt.
Protected pi Punishable Speech: The Relation of the
Policy " to Incitement
We now turn to the fact that the Policy does not
specifically prohibit incitement. The failure to deal with
such speech is not, in the Board's view, the result of a
conscious decision to protect all speech. Rather, it is one
aspect of the history of the Policy, which was formu
lated quickly to meet a momentary need for the articula
tion of certain basic, commonly-held views. The Board
does not accept the argument that the Policy's omission
of a discussion of incitement automatically removes it
from prohibition.
In the Board's view, incitement to illegal conduct—as
we shall define it below-is an abuse of power. Such
abuse is a serious matter in a university, especially when
faculty members are addressing students. We see no
excuse for placing certain conduct beyond the law of the
campus, as the Policy does, and then implying blanket
permission for faculty members to incite others to
engage in that same conduct.
Protected vs. Punishable Speech: Standards
We do, however, see every reason for taking care that
the standard for incitement is carefully drawn, with due
cognizance of those First Amendment protections that
apply to the relation between state and citizen. A wide
range of standards has been offered to us. At one
extreme, we were urged by counsel for Professor Frank

lin that no speech should be punished by the university,
regardless of its incitement to illegal acts. At the other,
we might have ruled sanctionable the advocacy of
vaguely-defined violent action proposed for some time in
the indefinite future. In ruling on the White Plaza and
Old Union speeches, we shall meet a standard suggested
by the Supreme Court decision discussed at length by
the parties in this case. The court in Brandenburg vs.
Ohio (395 US 444) held that to be punishable, advocacy
must "be directed to inciting or producing imminent
lawless action, and. . .likely to produce such action." A
vague exhortation is not punishable under such a stand
ard; on the other extreme it is clearly unreasonable to
demand, as did counsel for Professor Franklin, that there
be an exact correspondence between specific acts advo
cated and those that follow. Subsequent illegal acts arc
not in fact required for incitement to be punishable
under this standard. Such acts might, for example, have
been prevented by external circumstances, or illegal acts
might occur but differ from those advocated. Subse
quent acts are useful in determining the level and
character of risk that obtained at the time of the alleged
incitement. In judging the applicability of the standard
cited, the Board has been guided by the following
considerations:
a. What is the entire context surrounding the alleged
incitement, including the immediate risk of lawless
action?
b. What is specifically being communicated to the
audience?
c. What did the speaker intend? We judge intent on
the basis of the speaker's own knowledge of the
context for his speech, his awareness of the level of
the risk, and the words he actually used.
In the application of this standard, punishable advocacy
need not identify particular acts, but it must include
advocacy of lawless conduct. Inclusion of advocacy of
legal acts with advocacy of lawless conduct does not
immunize that advocacy from punishment. In the appli
cation of this standard to the campus, it is clear that
"lawless action" refers to acts against the law of the
campus, that is, to conduct proscribed by the Policy or
University regulations, or clearly prohibited under the
kind of common understanding of conduct discussed
above.
With respect to the Computation Center incident, the
Board has applied a different standard.Professor Frank
lin is charged with intentionally inciting students and
others to disregard and disobey a police order to dis
perse. If, knowing the risk, he increased the risk of
personal injury to other persons, some of whom were
unaware of the risk, then his conduct is punishable.
Incitement need not be directed to increasing the likeli
hood of illegal conduct; it may also be punishable if it
places persons at heightened physical risk, as with the
cry of "fire" in a crowded theatre. Such speech is clearly
not Constitutionally protected.
It may be argued that the university should allow
more scope than the Constitution, or the current de
mands of society, would require; indeed, it has been put
to us that the university should not undertake to restrain
speech at all. We believe the university's prohibition of
incitement, given the criteria of intent, risk and immi
nence discussed above, is fully justified when speech
threatens two central university interests: (1) protection
of members of the university community and university
facilities against risks of serious injury or damage; (2)
protection against coercive intrusion on the intellectual
transactions which the university seeks to foster.

We observe also that in taking this position we have
rejected a formulation urged upon us by a group of
intervening faculty. In their view, dismissal from a
tenured position is warranted only for "failure to per
form the duties for which one was hired-teaching,
and/or research. .or for previous conviction of "some
criminal act." We believe it is inappropriate to tie tenure
proceedings to the criminal process. The standard sug
gested by the interveners would, to be sure, relieve the
Board of the difficult obligation to construct a narrative
of disputed events as a basis for judgment. However
desirable that might be, we find it almost the only virtue
in their position. A criminal proceeding may require
several years to resolve, and it may terminate favorably
to the accused for reasons which have nothing to do
with a faculty member's fitness to retain his position. It
is not obvious why the university should be dependent
on external prosecution policy, which may respond to a
number of factors but which is unlikely to reflect any
sensitive judgment of university interests as a central
concern. It does seem clear that sound decisions, on the
issue ol penalty perhaps even more than on the issue of
culpability, under university standards, will require the
kind ol intimate familiarity with the facts of a case that
can be best provided by professional peers. On this basis,
the mere tact ol conviction of criminal offenses could be
a wholly insufficient guide to wise disposition within the
university.
Relation oj Speech to the Institution
Lastly, we turn to the circumstances under which
speech occurs, and to the relationship between those
circumstances and the 'duty' and 'appropriate function'
ol the speaker. Speech and conduct by faculty members
have in other cases been treated according to different
standards depending upon whether they were judged to
be connected with the faculty member's duties or
unrelated to them.
Professor Franklin has applied the term "extracurri
cular" to his speech at the two rallies. The Board cannot
agree with this use of the term, if by it Professor
Franklin intends to place the speeches in question
outside the framework of his duties and appropriate
function in the university. There is a degree of differ
ence, to be sure, bewteen speech in the classroom and
speech outside it; it may reasonably be held, for exam
ple, that explicit advocacy of a political position un
related to the subject matter of a course is improper
when delivered in front of a class, but is not when
delivered at a rally outside the classroom door. But that
view does not automatically remove all activities that
take place outside the classroom door from the reach of
institutional regulation. In a residential university, facul
ty members relate professionally to students in many
ways: in offices, at the dinner table, in informal advising
situations, and so on. These relationships certainly do
not resemble contacts between that faculty member and
citizens on a downtown street. We believe that the ,
speech of a faculty member to a campus audience on
campus issues is subject to regulations, though the
standard applied to it will be different from that applied
to a classroom situation. Indeed, the location of the
recommended target may equally serve to define speech
in relation to the institution: a faculty member inciting
an off-campus crowd to occupy a university building
illegally is, in our view, liable to institutional regulation.
We will now consider the specific charges in the light
of these standards.
Much attention has been paid by the parties to
'Constitutional' questions that may apply to the matter
before us. We here respond to that concern by treating
some of the major issues of this kind that have been
raised in argument and briefs by the parties.
"State Action"
Constitutional standards of due process and free
speech restrain the state. At one point in this proceeding
the University administration expressed the view that
disciplinary proceedings at a private institution are not
necessarily subject to Constitutional protections, while
Professor Franklin has responded that Stanford is in
substantial part publicly financed and publicly regulated
and that the Constitution is consequently as fully appli
cable to Stanford as to an agency of the state. The
merits of these two competing views aside, the Board
does not believe that the disagreement between them
focusses upon the important issues.
Tenure proceedings at all universities, private and
public, involve an attempt to abrogate permanence of
employment for cause.
Tenure, accurately and unequivocally defined, lays no
claim wiiatever to a guarantee of lifetime employ
ment. Rather, tenure provides only that no person
continuously retained as a full-time faculty member
beyond a specified lengthy period of probationary
service may thereafter be dismissed without adequate
cause. Moreover, the particular standards of'adequate
cause' to which the tenured faculty is accountable are
themselves wholly within the prerogative of each
university to determine through its own published
rules, save only that those rules not be applied in a
manner which violates the academic freedom or the
ordinary personal civil liberties of the individual. An
institution may provide for dismissal for 'adequate
cause' arising from failure to meet a specified norm of
performance or productivity, as well as from specified
acts of affirmative misconduct.. . .
. . .This accompanying complement of academic due
process merely establishes that a fairly rigorous pro
cedure will be observed whenever formal complaint is
made that dismissal is justified on some stated ground
of professional irresponsibility, to insure the fair
determination of three facts:
1. that the stated cause is the authentic cause for
dismissal, rather than a pretense or makeweight for
considerations invading the academic freedom or
ordinary personal civil liberties of the individual;
2. that the stated cause exists in fact;
3. that the degree of demonstrated professional
irresponsibility warrants outright termination of
the individual's appointment rather than some
lesser sanction, even after taking into account the
balance of his entire service and the personal
consequences of dismissal.
(Van Alstyne, N. Bulletin oj the American Asso
ciation of University Professors. Autumn. 1971)

Given the essentially identical character of the in
quiry in tenure cases, neither the standards of due
process nor the content of regulations covering speech
need differ between private and public institutions of
higher learning. It is open to a private university to
impose Constitutional limitations on itself as a deliberate
choice of policy; in advance of the hearing the Board
committed itself to at least this much in undertaking to
provide for Professor Franklin "no less protection oi his
Constitutional rights at Stanford than that to which he
would be entitled as a member of the faculty of a state
university." In the opinion of the Board the more
significant questions are: What are the Constitutional
boundaries? What should be the university's policies
beyind the minimum standards set by the Constitution?
We emphasize at the outset that we do not regard the
conduct described in the charges filed by the University
administration to be constitutionally protected against
University discipline. On the contrary, we consider such
conduct to be clearly within the reach of institutional
authority. The university charges that the two speeches
involve advocacy that is directed to inciting or producing
imminent lawless action, and likely to produce such
action. The charge on the Computation Center incident
deals with conduct which might unjustifiably increase
the risk of injury to others.
But this is not all that needs to be said about the
matter. Professor Franklin has also characterized as
"vague" and "overbroad" the charges made against him,
and also the standards set out in the Statement of Policy
on Appointment and Tenure ("substantial and manifest
incompetence, substantial and manifest neglect of duty,
or personal conduct substantially impairing the individ
ual's performance of his appropriate function within the
university community"). Prior to the hearing, the Board
rejected Professor Franklin's challenge on the vagueness
and overbreadth of the charges; at the same time, it
reserved its decision regarding the similar claims directed
to the underlying tenure regulations. The Board now
rejects these claims as well, for reasons we discuss below.
Vagueness and Overbreadth: The State Context
The term "overbreadth," as the parties agree, means
that a regulation encompasses both conduct which the
institution can legitimately prohibit, and conduct which
is Constitutionally protected against such prohibition,
'.e., speech of the sort shielded from governmental
estraints by the First Amendment. "Vagueness" is a
lifferent but related defect which leaves the meaning of
he regulation uncertain, in such a way that a member of
„n institution cannot reasonably judge what conduct is
prohibited and what conduct is permitted.
The simplest level at which an argument of over
breadth may be met is to ask whether the conduct for
which an individual is allegedly culpable under some
regulation is Constitutionally protected. If that were
found to be the case, then obviously the Constitution
would not allow the individual to be penalized under the
regulation because, no matter how precisely and clearly
its terms describe the conduct, the prohibition was
illegitimate under Constitutional provisions. Professor
rnnl'Hn mnlfltoinr -it flir* I pta'irrroc aOQinct

him deal with actions that are Constitutionally pro
tected. He goes further, however, to argue that even if
the Constitution would allow his prosecution for that
conduct in which he engaged, and even if that conduct
were clearly covered by the University's tenure regula
tion, that regulation is inapplicable to him simply be
cause of its overbreadth. This conclusion is argued from
the principle that society places a high value on the free
exercise of speech, and that it can tolerate no "chilling
effect" on this freedom. If a regulation covers both
permitted and prohibited conduct, then it may deter
others from exercising First Amendment rights which
fall under the improperly constructed portion of the
regulation's roof. Even a person guilty of legitimately
proscribable conduct may be rewarded for pointing out
the Constitutional infirmity of the regulation under
which he was prosecuted by relieving him of the con
sequences of his guilt. For the vice of overbreadth, the
institution is forced to invalidate the regulation over its
entire range of application, and to substitute for it a
more narrowly drawn regulation which will withstand
Constitutional scrutiny.
The vagueness doctrine, by contrast, is in substantial
part a canon of ordinary fairness. If a jurisdiction has
not identified a particular kind of conduct as subject to
punishment, it should not then be able to punish
perpetrators of such conduct. Vague regulations may
share some of the disadvantages of overbroad regula
tions, because their indefiniteness may overlap Constitu
tionally-guaranteed zones of activity and deter people
from doing what they have the right to do. Where
indefinite regulations are applied to speech, the vague
ness then invades an activity of such high social utility
that it claims special protection in the Constitution.
Again, it may be justifiable to reward persons who, while
knowingly engaging in activity that the institution may
legitimately proscribe, can show that the regulation is
vague at the border between punishable and protected
conduct. Like the transgressor who points out over
breadth, the identifier of vagueness—even though he
might be guilty under a properly drawn regulation
might receive a benefit for helping to thaw improperly
frozen expression.
Vague regulations introduce other difficulties as well
in a state context. The responsibility for drafting of
governing regulations rests with legislators who are ac
countable through political processes; when they enact a
vague statute, they shift responsibility for the law
making function onto the courts, who must take up the
legislator's abandoned obligations and give the statute
meaning in the course of applying it. Such a transfer of
responsibility might unduly disturb the balance of
powers among the branches of government. Further
more, the law enforcement authorities as well as the
courts have received the responsibility transferred by the
vague regulation, and may thereby he afforded unduly
wide discretion in the selection of whom to prosecute.
Obviously, such freedom might be exercised arbitrarily,
or for the purpose of retaliating against Constitutionally
protected activities. Finally, the adjudicating process
itsrlf (!•!• <T>ri v»v wwiie regulations: both the parties
and the decision maker are at a loss as to how to prepare
the case, what evidence to introduce, what arguments to
make, and what standards to use in deciding it.
Vagueness and Overbreadth: The University Context
These reflections on the briefs and arguments of the
parties regarding the doctrines of vagueness and over
breadth spell out certain problems, but hardly take us
directly to a resolution of the present issues. The legal
material pressed on us by the parties deals with problems
of vagueness and overbreadth in contexts which often
depart substantially from that applying in this case. It is
on this ground that we set aside the cases on student
discipline that both parties have reviewed for us in some
detail. Our examination of these cases persuades us that
the law in this field is incompletely settled; a rapid rate
of contemporary change has generated substantial dis
agreement and a conspicuously confused rationale.
There may be a trend toward enhanced protection, and
an employment of concepts of vagueness and over
breadth similar to those urged upon us by Professor
Franklin. But we recognize important differences in the
relationship between the institution and students, on the
one hand, the faculty, on the other. Students are much
more numerous; their time in the institution is shorter;
their fiscal relationaship with it is entirely different; and
a different tradition of academic freedom obtains. These
difficulties emphasize our conclusion that the problems
of vagueness and overbreadth, as well as other aspects of
the case, must be analyzed with due regard for the
framework—and the atmosphere-of the relation be
tween a faculty member and the University.
We may dispense quickly with two of the difficulties
engendered by vagueness. In some other procedural
system, vague regulations may produce problems in the
preparation, hearing and decision of the case, since none
of the participants can find his way in the fog created by
the lack of underlying standards. However, we consider
the charges in this case reasonably narrow and specific.
In our opinion, they are fully adequate to state an
intelligible conception of the case on the part of the
University administration, give Professor Franklin notice
of the conduct with which he is charged and enable him
to prepare and present his defense, and equip the Board
to shape the hearing and focus on commonly understood
issues. Beyond this, the Board afforded each party the
opportunity to obtain pre-hearing disclosure from the
other party of information and contentions relevant to
the case.
We also do not believe that the role of vague statutes
in unbalancing the separation of governmental processes
is one that need concern us in this situation. The faculty
of the university is a small community, characterized by
face-to-face contact and personal interaction. Legislation
proscribing conduct in a disciplinary context is rare;
when it occurs, it merely codifies previously shared
understandings. While there is clearly some allocation of
function as between faculty and administration, with
ultimate authority retained in the Board of Trustees as a
matter of legal right, interchanges and combinations of
roles are heavily involved in the actual governance of the
university. Faculty members relate to the institution
more through practice and informally negotiated con
sensus than through hierarchically codified rule. Rules of
conduct thus trace their source to slowly evolving
tradition rather than to abrupt acts of legislative inter
vention by persons in positions of formal authority.
Lack of centralization—often aided by small size and
extensive interaction—obviate for the university faculty
the need for the kind of detailed directions that guide
the armies of bureaucrats upon which larger organiza
tions often rely for administering centrally-determined
policies.
There remain the problems of fair warning, of over
breadth, and of undue discretion in enforcement.
Against the background of the relationship between
citizen and state, it is easy to make these issues appear
genuine and substantial. Plainly, it would be intolerable
for the state to provide that a citizen could be im
prisoned for "substantial and manifest incompetence,
substantial and manifest neglect of duty, or personal
conduct substantially impairing the individual's perfor
mance of his appropriate functions within the communi
ty." The situation is different, we believe, when the
public to which similar regulations are addressed is the
faculty of the university. In the more restricted setting,
the regulation invokes a web of largely unwritten rules as
tough and living as the British Constitution. Powerful
traditions, modified by contemporary practice, furnish a
reliable guide to faculty conduct, and entrust review
procedures to faculty peers-in this case, to a faculty
hearing board elected by the faculty. Nothing in those
traditions collides with Constitutionally guarded free
doms. On the contrary, it is the University's responsi
bility to enhance the exercise of rights of speech which
the First Amendment merely protects against govern
mental interference.
We would emphasize the meager record of the aca
demic community's experience with faculty discipline.
This may well be because faculty members chose their
profession in part because they embrace traditional
faculty norms, therefore performing willingly what writ
ten rules coerce in other systems. Indeed, the kind of
written rules contained in court decisions and codes are
not merely responses to the need for prior warning.
They are also the result of society's experience in
enforcing pre-existing norms against a partly recalcitrant
population—as suggested by the maxim that "ignorance
of the law is no excuse." The general practice of
conforming to norms may instruct individual faculty
members about those norms just as clearly as would
occasional cases of discipline for breach of standards.
This wide observance of the norms of faculty conduct
cannot disguise the fact of strong disagreement with
them among some faculty; dissent from a rule, or even
from the entire system of rules, obviously exists, and
must exist to furnish the motive power for necessary
change. But disagreement with a rule is not the same as
ignorance of its terms.
It is perhaps true that a fully-developed code would
be a more readily interprctable guide. But we believe
that the institution and its members would pay a heavy
price for such codification in terms of lost faculty
autonomy and initiative, and in over-bureaucratization.
This detriment should be carefully weighed before the
university accepts regulations spelled out in greater
detail. What we have called the web of unwritten rules of
faculty conduct is not clear or easy to apply in all cases;
on the contrary, there are borderline cases, and intracta
ble problems of application. But codified systems of
rules, too, are inevitably characterized by gaps and
conflicts—and suffer from certain pathologies precisely
because they are written. For example, rules designed to
protect speech by limiting other speech are double
edged; in either direction, they cut into regions that lie
under the protection o<*the First Amendment.

On balance, we favor the present reliance on largely
unwritten standards. But whatever the future holds in
this regard, we find the present understandings adequate
ly clear to guide faculty members in choosing among
various courses of action in particular situations.
Statement of Policy on Appointment and Tenure
The duties of a faculty member include, obviously,
specific teaching and scholarly obligations that are un
derstood primarily in terms of arrangements reached
voluntarily between the individual and his department or
some other institutional unit. Such obligations are gen
erally not spelled out in writing, perhaps because pro
fessors object to formal job descriptions. Nonetheless,
failure to meet commitments of this kind would clearly
constitute "substantial and manifest neglect of duty."
Similarly, "performance of his appropriate function in
the University" means the meeting of the full range of
agreed-upon institutional obligations. Professor Franklin,
in his final argument, characterizes the Statement of
Policy on Appointment and Tenure as being worded so
as to protect the performance of these positive obliga
tions—to enable the institution to weed out the demon
strably incompetent. But the unwritten understandings
discussed above give to the terms "duty" and "appro
priate function" a character of limitation as well as of
obligation. The fulfillment of a faculty member's duty
to his students and colleagues is understood to involve
an obligation to refrain from corrupting the intellectual
transactions that are the essence of the university, and
the other activities that support these. This does not, of
course, mean that he must exhibit political conformity
with the objectives of the institution; the university
must accommodate the questioning of contemporary
goals and structures, and must even tolerate the view
that the university, or the professoriate, should not
survive. There is positive benefit in having on the faculty
active representatives of political views that, while they
may be considered extreme or dissenting here, are held
by large numbers of people in the world and comprise a
dominant form of political organization in many places.
It seems likely that students can get a better education
about the nature of these ideas from proponents than
they can obtain through an exposure only to disengaged
analysts. Proponents are often also proselytizers: that
freedom should be granted also so long as its exercise
does not infringe upon the free choice of others. The
code of the institution does, however, demand that the
speech and conduct of a professor stay behind the line
of inciting or physically causing the impairment of the
institution's functions, especially its function as a forum
in which various other points of view can also be heard.
Policy on Campus Disruptions
The Policy on Campus Disruptions (hereafter called
the Policy) first appeared in 1965. It was a first attempt
to provide more detailed codification of conduct that
might be proscribed on the campus. The Policy was
clearly never intended to list all behavior that a faculty
member might engage in that was against university
policy; indeed, its original authors (the no-longer-extant
Committee on University Policy) did not even aim it
explicitly at faculty, so that it later had to be ratified by
the Academic Senate in 1968. That bit of legislative
history is interesting: although there was some debate
about a linked proposal concerning the judicial mechan
ism for dealing with faculty violators, no member of the
Senate offered dissent to a single substantive element of
the Policy. This episode shows, perhaps more clearly
than anything else, that the Policy was widely and
immediately accepted because it articulated some as
sumptions about appropriate conduct that most faculty
members heid in common.
Another way of illustrating this proposition is to
suppose that there were no Policy. Would the University
then be powerless to take action against a faculty
member for any of the acts described therein? In other
words, do we really insist on requiring that every
proscribed action be named in a document before we
place it on the other side of the line? The Board believes
that the answer to each of these questions is "no." We
have concluded above that there are common under
standings of appropriate faculty conduct, and that con
duct therefore exists which, even though it may not be
listed in an official policy, is nevertheless sanctionable.
With this background, we can consider the specific
conduct of the Policy. It lists several general positive
obligations:
a. to maintain "an atmosphere conducive to schol
arly pursuits"
b. "to preserve the dignity and seriousness of
University ceremonies and public exercises"
c. "to respect the rights of individuals"
The Policy also includes several specific areas of pro
scribed conduct:
a. "to prevent or disrupt the effective carrying out
of a University function or approved activity such
as lectures, meetings, [and] public events. ..
b. "to obstruct the legitimate movement of any
person about the campus or in any University
building or facility."
The Board believes that these provisions provide a clear
statement amplifying and defining some of the concepts
expressed more generally in the Statement of Policy on
Appointment and Tenure. Its applicability to faculty
members is beyond doubt.
Protected pi Punishable Speech: The Relation of the
Policy " to Incitement
We now turn to the fact that the Policy does not
specifically prohibit incitement. The failure to deal with
such speech is not, in the Board's view, the result of a
conscious decision to protect all speech. Rather, it is one
aspect of the history of the Policy, which was formu
lated quickly to meet a momentary need for the articula
tion of certain basic, commonly-held views. The Board
does not accept the argument that the Policy's omission
of a discussion of incitement automatically removes it
from prohibition.
In the Board's view, incitement to illegal conduct—as
we shall define it below-is an abuse of power. Such
abuse is a serious matter in a university, especially when
faculty members are addressing students. We see no
excuse for placing certain conduct beyond the law of the
campus, as the Policy does, and then implying blanket
permission for faculty members to incite others to
engage in that same conduct.
Protected vs. Punishable Speech: Standards
We do, however, see every reason for taking care that
the standard for incitement is carefully drawn, with due
cognizance of those First Amendment protections that
apply to the relation between state and citizen. A wide
range of standards has been offered to us. At one
extreme, we were urged by counsel for Professor Frank

lin that no speech should be punished by the university,
regardless of its incitement to illegal acts. At the other,
we might have ruled sanctionable the advocacy of
vaguely-defined violent action proposed for some time in
the indefinite future. In ruling on the White Plaza and
Old Union speeches, we shall meet a standard suggested
by the Supreme Court decision discussed at length by
the parties in this case. The court in Brandenburg vs.
Ohio (395 US 444) held that to be punishable, advocacy
must "be directed to inciting or producing imminent
lawless action, and. . .likely to produce such action." A
vague exhortation is not punishable under such a stand
ard; on the other extreme it is clearly unreasonable to
demand, as did counsel for Professor Franklin, that there
be an exact correspondence between specific acts advo
cated and those that follow. Subsequent illegal acts arc
not in fact required for incitement to be punishable
under this standard. Such acts might, for example, have
been prevented by external circumstances, or illegal acts
might occur but differ from those advocated. Subse
quent acts are useful in determining the level and
character of risk that obtained at the time of the alleged
incitement. In judging the applicability of the standard
cited, the Board has been guided by the following
considerations:
a. What is the entire context surrounding the alleged
incitement, including the immediate risk of lawless
action?
b. What is specifically being communicated to the
audience?
c. What did the speaker intend? We judge intent on
the basis of the speaker's own knowledge of the
context for his speech, his awareness of the level of
the risk, and the words he actually used.
In the application of this standard, punishable advocacy
need not identify particular acts, but it must include
advocacy of lawless conduct. Inclusion of advocacy of
legal acts with advocacy of lawless conduct does not
immunize that advocacy from punishment. In the appli
cation of this standard to the campus, it is clear that
"lawless action" refers to acts against the law of the
campus, that is, to conduct proscribed by the Policy or
University regulations, or clearly prohibited under the
kind of common understanding of conduct discussed
above.
With respect to the Computation Center incident, the
Board has applied a different standard.Professor Frank
lin is charged with intentionally inciting students and
others to disregard and disobey a police order to dis
perse. If, knowing the risk, he increased the risk of
personal injury to other persons, some of whom were
unaware of the risk, then his conduct is punishable.
Incitement need not be directed to increasing the likeli
hood of illegal conduct; it may also be punishable if it
places persons at heightened physical risk, as with the
cry of "fire" in a crowded theatre. Such speech is clearly
not Constitutionally protected.
It may be argued that the university should allow
more scope than the Constitution, or the current de
mands of society, would require; indeed, it has been put
to us that the university should not undertake to restrain
speech at all. We believe the university's prohibition of
incitement, given the criteria of intent, risk and immi
nence discussed above, is fully justified when speech
threatens two central university interests: (1) protection
of members of the university community and university
facilities against risks of serious injury or damage; (2)
protection against coercive intrusion on the intellectual
transactions which the university seeks to foster.

We observe also that in taking this position we have
rejected a formulation urged upon us by a group of
intervening faculty. In their view, dismissal from a
tenured position is warranted only for "failure to per
form the duties for which one was hired-teaching,
and/or research. .or for previous conviction of "some
criminal act." We believe it is inappropriate to tie tenure
proceedings to the criminal process. The standard sug
gested by the interveners would, to be sure, relieve the
Board of the difficult obligation to construct a narrative
of disputed events as a basis for judgment. However
desirable that might be, we find it almost the only virtue
in their position. A criminal proceeding may require
several years to resolve, and it may terminate favorably
to the accused for reasons which have nothing to do
with a faculty member's fitness to retain his position. It
is not obvious why the university should be dependent
on external prosecution policy, which may respond to a
number of factors but which is unlikely to reflect any
sensitive judgment of university interests as a central
concern. It does seem clear that sound decisions, on the
issue ol penalty perhaps even more than on the issue of
culpability, under university standards, will require the
kind ol intimate familiarity with the facts of a case that
can be best provided by professional peers. On this basis,
the mere tact ol conviction of criminal offenses could be
a wholly insufficient guide to wise disposition within the
university.
Relation oj Speech to the Institution
Lastly, we turn to the circumstances under which
speech occurs, and to the relationship between those
circumstances and the 'duty' and 'appropriate function'
ol the speaker. Speech and conduct by faculty members
have in other cases been treated according to different
standards depending upon whether they were judged to
be connected with the faculty member's duties or
unrelated to them.
Professor Franklin has applied the term "extracurri
cular" to his speech at the two rallies. The Board cannot
agree with this use of the term, if by it Professor
Franklin intends to place the speeches in question
outside the framework of his duties and appropriate
function in the university. There is a degree of differ
ence, to be sure, bewteen speech in the classroom and
speech outside it; it may reasonably be held, for exam
ple, that explicit advocacy of a political position un
related to the subject matter of a course is improper
when delivered in front of a class, but is not when
delivered at a rally outside the classroom door. But that
view does not automatically remove all activities that
take place outside the classroom door from the reach of
institutional regulation. In a residential university, facul
ty members relate professionally to students in many
ways: in offices, at the dinner table, in informal advising
situations, and so on. These relationships certainly do
not resemble contacts between that faculty member and
citizens on a downtown street. We believe that the ,
speech of a faculty member to a campus audience on
campus issues is subject to regulations, though the
standard applied to it will be different from that applied
to a classroom situation. Indeed, the location of the
recommended target may equally serve to define speech
in relation to the institution: a faculty member inciting
an off-campus crowd to occupy a university building
illegally is, in our view, liable to institutional regulation.
We will now consider the specific charges in the light
of these standards.
Much attention has been paid by the parties to
'Constitutional' questions that may apply to the matter
before us. We here respond to that concern by treating
some of the major issues of this kind that have been
raised in argument and briefs by the parties.
"State Action"
Constitutional standards of due process and free
speech restrain the state. At one point in this proceeding
the University administration expressed the view that
disciplinary proceedings at a private institution are not
necessarily subject to Constitutional protections, while
Professor Franklin has responded that Stanford is in
substantial part publicly financed and publicly regulated
and that the Constitution is consequently as fully appli
cable to Stanford as to an agency of the state. The
merits of these two competing views aside, the Board
does not believe that the disagreement between them
focusses upon the important issues.
Tenure proceedings at all universities, private and
public, involve an attempt to abrogate permanence of
employment for cause.
Tenure, accurately and unequivocally defined, lays no
claim wiiatever to a guarantee of lifetime employ
ment. Rather, tenure provides only that no person
continuously retained as a full-time faculty member
beyond a specified lengthy period of probationary
service may thereafter be dismissed without adequate
cause. Moreover, the particular standards of'adequate
cause' to which the tenured faculty is accountable are
themselves wholly within the prerogative of each
university to determine through its own published
rules, save only that those rules not be applied in a
manner which violates the academic freedom or the
ordinary personal civil liberties of the individual. An
institution may provide for dismissal for 'adequate
cause' arising from failure to meet a specified norm of
performance or productivity, as well as from specified
acts of affirmative misconduct.. . .
. . .This accompanying complement of academic due
process merely establishes that a fairly rigorous pro
cedure will be observed whenever formal complaint is
made that dismissal is justified on some stated ground
of professional irresponsibility, to insure the fair
determination of three facts:
1. that the stated cause is the authentic cause for
dismissal, rather than a pretense or makeweight for
considerations invading the academic freedom or
ordinary personal civil liberties of the individual;
2. that the stated cause exists in fact;
3. that the degree of demonstrated professional
irresponsibility warrants outright termination of
the individual's appointment rather than some
lesser sanction, even after taking into account the
balance of his entire service and the personal
consequences of dismissal.
(Van Alstyne, N. Bulletin oj the American Asso
ciation of University Professors. Autumn. 1971)

Given the essentially identical character of the in
quiry in tenure cases, neither the standards of due
process nor the content of regulations covering speech
need differ between private and public institutions of
higher learning. It is open to a private university to
impose Constitutional limitations on itself as a deliberate
choice of policy; in advance of the hearing the Board
committed itself to at least this much in undertaking to
provide for Professor Franklin "no less protection oi his
Constitutional rights at Stanford than that to which he
would be entitled as a member of the faculty of a state
university." In the opinion of the Board the more
significant questions are: What are the Constitutional
boundaries? What should be the university's policies
beyind the minimum standards set by the Constitution?
We emphasize at the outset that we do not regard the
conduct described in the charges filed by the University
administration to be constitutionally protected against
University discipline. On the contrary, we consider such
conduct to be clearly within the reach of institutional
authority. The university charges that the two speeches
involve advocacy that is directed to inciting or producing
imminent lawless action, and likely to produce such
action. The charge on the Computation Center incident
deals with conduct which might unjustifiably increase
the risk of injury to others.
But this is not all that needs to be said about the
matter. Professor Franklin has also characterized as
"vague" and "overbroad" the charges made against him,
and also the standards set out in the Statement of Policy
on Appointment and Tenure ("substantial and manifest
incompetence, substantial and manifest neglect of duty,
or personal conduct substantially impairing the individ
ual's performance of his appropriate function within the
university community"). Prior to the hearing, the Board
rejected Professor Franklin's challenge on the vagueness
and overbreadth of the charges; at the same time, it
reserved its decision regarding the similar claims directed
to the underlying tenure regulations. The Board now
rejects these claims as well, for reasons we discuss below.
Vagueness and Overbreadth: The State Context
The term "overbreadth," as the parties agree, means
that a regulation encompasses both conduct which the
institution can legitimately prohibit, and conduct which
is Constitutionally protected against such prohibition,
'.e., speech of the sort shielded from governmental
estraints by the First Amendment. "Vagueness" is a
lifferent but related defect which leaves the meaning of
he regulation uncertain, in such a way that a member of
„n institution cannot reasonably judge what conduct is
prohibited and what conduct is permitted.
The simplest level at which an argument of over
breadth may be met is to ask whether the conduct for
which an individual is allegedly culpable under some
regulation is Constitutionally protected. If that were
found to be the case, then obviously the Constitution
would not allow the individual to be penalized under the
regulation because, no matter how precisely and clearly
its terms describe the conduct, the prohibition was
illegitimate under Constitutional provisions. Professor
rnnl'Hn mnlfltoinr -it flir* I pta'irrroc aOQinct

him deal with actions that are Constitutionally pro
tected. He goes further, however, to argue that even if
the Constitution would allow his prosecution for that
conduct in which he engaged, and even if that conduct
were clearly covered by the University's tenure regula
tion, that regulation is inapplicable to him simply be
cause of its overbreadth. This conclusion is argued from
the principle that society places a high value on the free
exercise of speech, and that it can tolerate no "chilling
effect" on this freedom. If a regulation covers both
permitted and prohibited conduct, then it may deter
others from exercising First Amendment rights which
fall under the improperly constructed portion of the
regulation's roof. Even a person guilty of legitimately
proscribable conduct may be rewarded for pointing out
the Constitutional infirmity of the regulation under
which he was prosecuted by relieving him of the con
sequences of his guilt. For the vice of overbreadth, the
institution is forced to invalidate the regulation over its
entire range of application, and to substitute for it a
more narrowly drawn regulation which will withstand
Constitutional scrutiny.
The vagueness doctrine, by contrast, is in substantial
part a canon of ordinary fairness. If a jurisdiction has
not identified a particular kind of conduct as subject to
punishment, it should not then be able to punish
perpetrators of such conduct. Vague regulations may
share some of the disadvantages of overbroad regula
tions, because their indefiniteness may overlap Constitu
tionally-guaranteed zones of activity and deter people
from doing what they have the right to do. Where
indefinite regulations are applied to speech, the vague
ness then invades an activity of such high social utility
that it claims special protection in the Constitution.
Again, it may be justifiable to reward persons who, while
knowingly engaging in activity that the institution may
legitimately proscribe, can show that the regulation is
vague at the border between punishable and protected
conduct. Like the transgressor who points out over
breadth, the identifier of vagueness—even though he
might be guilty under a properly drawn regulation
might receive a benefit for helping to thaw improperly
frozen expression.
Vague regulations introduce other difficulties as well
in a state context. The responsibility for drafting of
governing regulations rests with legislators who are ac
countable through political processes; when they enact a
vague statute, they shift responsibility for the law
making function onto the courts, who must take up the
legislator's abandoned obligations and give the statute
meaning in the course of applying it. Such a transfer of
responsibility might unduly disturb the balance of
powers among the branches of government. Further
more, the law enforcement authorities as well as the
courts have received the responsibility transferred by the
vague regulation, and may thereby he afforded unduly
wide discretion in the selection of whom to prosecute.
Obviously, such freedom might be exercised arbitrarily,
or for the purpose of retaliating against Constitutionally
protected activities. Finally, the adjudicating process
itsrlf (!•!• <T>ri v»v wwiie regulations: both the parties
and the decision maker are at a loss as to how to prepare
the case, what evidence to introduce, what arguments to
make, and what standards to use in deciding it.
Vagueness and Overbreadth: The University Context
These reflections on the briefs and arguments of the
parties regarding the doctrines of vagueness and over
breadth spell out certain problems, but hardly take us
directly to a resolution of the present issues. The legal
material pressed on us by the parties deals with problems
of vagueness and overbreadth in contexts which often
depart substantially from that applying in this case. It is
on this ground that we set aside the cases on student
discipline that both parties have reviewed for us in some
detail. Our examination of these cases persuades us that
the law in this field is incompletely settled; a rapid rate
of contemporary change has generated substantial dis
agreement and a conspicuously confused rationale.
There may be a trend toward enhanced protection, and
an employment of concepts of vagueness and over
breadth similar to those urged upon us by Professor
Franklin. But we recognize important differences in the
relationship between the institution and students, on the
one hand, the faculty, on the other. Students are much
more numerous; their time in the institution is shorter;
their fiscal relationaship with it is entirely different; and
a different tradition of academic freedom obtains. These
difficulties emphasize our conclusion that the problems
of vagueness and overbreadth, as well as other aspects of
the case, must be analyzed with due regard for the
framework—and the atmosphere-of the relation be
tween a faculty member and the University.
We may dispense quickly with two of the difficulties
engendered by vagueness. In some other procedural
system, vague regulations may produce problems in the
preparation, hearing and decision of the case, since none
of the participants can find his way in the fog created by
the lack of underlying standards. However, we consider
the charges in this case reasonably narrow and specific.
In our opinion, they are fully adequate to state an
intelligible conception of the case on the part of the
University administration, give Professor Franklin notice
of the conduct with which he is charged and enable him
to prepare and present his defense, and equip the Board
to shape the hearing and focus on commonly understood
issues. Beyond this, the Board afforded each party the
opportunity to obtain pre-hearing disclosure from the
other party of information and contentions relevant to
the case.
We also do not believe that the role of vague statutes
in unbalancing the separation of governmental processes
is one that need concern us in this situation. The faculty
of the university is a small community, characterized by
face-to-face contact and personal interaction. Legislation
proscribing conduct in a disciplinary context is rare;
when it occurs, it merely codifies previously shared
understandings. While there is clearly some allocation of
function as between faculty and administration, with
ultimate authority retained in the Board of Trustees as a
matter of legal right, interchanges and combinations of
roles are heavily involved in the actual governance of the
university. Faculty members relate to the institution
more through practice and informally negotiated con
sensus than through hierarchically codified rule. Rules of
conduct thus trace their source to slowly evolving
tradition rather than to abrupt acts of legislative inter
vention by persons in positions of formal authority.
Lack of centralization—often aided by small size and
extensive interaction—obviate for the university faculty
the need for the kind of detailed directions that guide
the armies of bureaucrats upon which larger organiza
tions often rely for administering centrally-determined
policies.
There remain the problems of fair warning, of over
breadth, and of undue discretion in enforcement.
Against the background of the relationship between
citizen and state, it is easy to make these issues appear
genuine and substantial. Plainly, it would be intolerable
for the state to provide that a citizen could be im
prisoned for "substantial and manifest incompetence,
substantial and manifest neglect of duty, or personal
conduct substantially impairing the individual's perfor
mance of his appropriate functions within the communi
ty." The situation is different, we believe, when the
public to which similar regulations are addressed is the
faculty of the university. In the more restricted setting,
the regulation invokes a web of largely unwritten rules as
tough and living as the British Constitution. Powerful
traditions, modified by contemporary practice, furnish a
reliable guide to faculty conduct, and entrust review
procedures to faculty peers-in this case, to a faculty
hearing board elected by the faculty. Nothing in those
traditions collides with Constitutionally guarded free
doms. On the contrary, it is the University's responsi
bility to enhance the exercise of rights of speech which
the First Amendment merely protects against govern
mental interference.
We would emphasize the meager record of the aca
demic community's experience with faculty discipline.
This may well be because faculty members chose their
profession in part because they embrace traditional
faculty norms, therefore performing willingly what writ
ten rules coerce in other systems. Indeed, the kind of
written rules contained in court decisions and codes are
not merely responses to the need for prior warning.
They are also the result of society's experience in
enforcing pre-existing norms against a partly recalcitrant
population—as suggested by the maxim that "ignorance
of the law is no excuse." The general practice of
conforming to norms may instruct individual faculty
members about those norms just as clearly as would
occasional cases of discipline for breach of standards.
This wide observance of the norms of faculty conduct
cannot disguise the fact of strong disagreement with
them among some faculty; dissent from a rule, or even
from the entire system of rules, obviously exists, and
must exist to furnish the motive power for necessary
change. But disagreement with a rule is not the same as
ignorance of its terms.
It is perhaps true that a fully-developed code would
be a more readily interprctable guide. But we believe
that the institution and its members would pay a heavy
price for such codification in terms of lost faculty
autonomy and initiative, and in over-bureaucratization.
This detriment should be carefully weighed before the
university accepts regulations spelled out in greater
detail. What we have called the web of unwritten rules of
faculty conduct is not clear or easy to apply in all cases;
on the contrary, there are borderline cases, and intracta
ble problems of application. But codified systems of
rules, too, are inevitably characterized by gaps and
conflicts—and suffer from certain pathologies precisely
because they are written. For example, rules designed to
protect speech by limiting other speech are double
edged; in either direction, they cut into regions that lie
under the protection o<*the First Amendment.

On balance, we favor the present reliance on largely
unwritten standards. But whatever the future holds in
this regard, we find the present understandings adequate
ly clear to guide faculty members in choosing among
various courses of action in particular situations.
Statement of Policy on Appointment and Tenure
The duties of a faculty member include, obviously,
specific teaching and scholarly obligations that are un
derstood primarily in terms of arrangements reached
voluntarily between the individual and his department or
some other institutional unit. Such obligations are gen
erally not spelled out in writing, perhaps because pro
fessors object to formal job descriptions. Nonetheless,
failure to meet commitments of this kind would clearly
constitute "substantial and manifest neglect of duty."
Similarly, "performance of his appropriate function in
the University" means the meeting of the full range of
agreed-upon institutional obligations. Professor Franklin,
in his final argument, characterizes the Statement of
Policy on Appointment and Tenure as being worded so
as to protect the performance of these positive obliga
tions—to enable the institution to weed out the demon
strably incompetent. But the unwritten understandings
discussed above give to the terms "duty" and "appro
priate function" a character of limitation as well as of
obligation. The fulfillment of a faculty member's duty
to his students and colleagues is understood to involve
an obligation to refrain from corrupting the intellectual
transactions that are the essence of the university, and
the other activities that support these. This does not, of
course, mean that he must exhibit political conformity
with the objectives of the institution; the university
must accommodate the questioning of contemporary
goals and structures, and must even tolerate the view
that the university, or the professoriate, should not
survive. There is positive benefit in having on the faculty
active representatives of political views that, while they
may be considered extreme or dissenting here, are held
by large numbers of people in the world and comprise a
dominant form of political organization in many places.
It seems likely that students can get a better education
about the nature of these ideas from proponents than
they can obtain through an exposure only to disengaged
analysts. Proponents are often also proselytizers: that
freedom should be granted also so long as its exercise
does not infringe upon the free choice of others. The
code of the institution does, however, demand that the
speech and conduct of a professor stay behind the line
of inciting or physically causing the impairment of the
institution's functions, especially its function as a forum
in which various other points of view can also be heard.
Policy on Campus Disruptions
The Policy on Campus Disruptions (hereafter called
the Policy) first appeared in 1965. It was a first attempt
to provide more detailed codification of conduct that
might be proscribed on the campus. The Policy was
clearly never intended to list all behavior that a faculty
member might engage in that was against university
policy; indeed, its original authors (the no-longer-extant
Committee on University Policy) did not even aim it
explicitly at faculty, so that it later had to be ratified by
the Academic Senate in 1968. That bit of legislative
history is interesting: although there was some debate
about a linked proposal concerning the judicial mechan
ism for dealing with faculty violators, no member of the
Senate offered dissent to a single substantive element of
the Policy. This episode shows, perhaps more clearly
than anything else, that the Policy was widely and
immediately accepted because it articulated some as
sumptions about appropriate conduct that most faculty
members heid in common.
Another way of illustrating this proposition is to
suppose that there were no Policy. Would the University
then be powerless to take action against a faculty
member for any of the acts described therein? In other
words, do we really insist on requiring that every
proscribed action be named in a document before we
place it on the other side of the line? The Board believes
that the answer to each of these questions is "no." We
have concluded above that there are common under
standings of appropriate faculty conduct, and that con
duct therefore exists which, even though it may not be
listed in an official policy, is nevertheless sanctionable.
With this background, we can consider the specific
conduct of the Policy. It lists several general positive
obligations:
a. to maintain "an atmosphere conducive to schol
arly pursuits"
b. "to preserve the dignity and seriousness of
University ceremonies and public exercises"
c. "to respect the rights of individuals"
The Policy also includes several specific areas of pro
scribed conduct:
a. "to prevent or disrupt the effective carrying out
of a University function or approved activity such
as lectures, meetings, [and] public events. ..
b. "to obstruct the legitimate movement of any
person about the campus or in any University
building or facility."
The Board believes that these provisions provide a clear
statement amplifying and defining some of the concepts
expressed more generally in the Statement of Policy on
Appointment and Tenure. Its applicability to faculty
members is beyond doubt.
Protected pi Punishable Speech: The Relation of the
Policy " to Incitement
We now turn to the fact that the Policy does not
specifically prohibit incitement. The failure to deal with
such speech is not, in the Board's view, the result of a
conscious decision to protect all speech. Rather, it is one
aspect of the history of the Policy, which was formu
lated quickly to meet a momentary need for the articula
tion of certain basic, commonly-held views. The Board
does not accept the argument that the Policy's omission
of a discussion of incitement automatically removes it
from prohibition.
In the Board's view, incitement to illegal conduct—as
we shall define it below-is an abuse of power. Such
abuse is a serious matter in a university, especially when
faculty members are addressing students. We see no
excuse for placing certain conduct beyond the law of the
campus, as the Policy does, and then implying blanket
permission for faculty members to incite others to
engage in that same conduct.
Protected vs. Punishable Speech: Standards
We do, however, see every reason for taking care that
the standard for incitement is carefully drawn, with due
cognizance of those First Amendment protections that
apply to the relation between state and citizen. A wide
range of standards has been offered to us. At one
extreme, we were urged by counsel for Professor Frank

lin that no speech should be punished by the university,
regardless of its incitement to illegal acts. At the other,
we might have ruled sanctionable the advocacy of
vaguely-defined violent action proposed for some time in
the indefinite future. In ruling on the White Plaza and
Old Union speeches, we shall meet a standard suggested
by the Supreme Court decision discussed at length by
the parties in this case. The court in Brandenburg vs.
Ohio (395 US 444) held that to be punishable, advocacy
must "be directed to inciting or producing imminent
lawless action, and. . .likely to produce such action." A
vague exhortation is not punishable under such a stand
ard; on the other extreme it is clearly unreasonable to
demand, as did counsel for Professor Franklin, that there
be an exact correspondence between specific acts advo
cated and those that follow. Subsequent illegal acts arc
not in fact required for incitement to be punishable
under this standard. Such acts might, for example, have
been prevented by external circumstances, or illegal acts
might occur but differ from those advocated. Subse
quent acts are useful in determining the level and
character of risk that obtained at the time of the alleged
incitement. In judging the applicability of the standard
cited, the Board has been guided by the following
considerations:
a. What is the entire context surrounding the alleged
incitement, including the immediate risk of lawless
action?
b. What is specifically being communicated to the
audience?
c. What did the speaker intend? We judge intent on
the basis of the speaker's own knowledge of the
context for his speech, his awareness of the level of
the risk, and the words he actually used.
In the application of this standard, punishable advocacy
need not identify particular acts, but it must include
advocacy of lawless conduct. Inclusion of advocacy of
legal acts with advocacy of lawless conduct does not
immunize that advocacy from punishment. In the appli
cation of this standard to the campus, it is clear that
"lawless action" refers to acts against the law of the
campus, that is, to conduct proscribed by the Policy or
University regulations, or clearly prohibited under the
kind of common understanding of conduct discussed
above.
With respect to the Computation Center incident, the
Board has applied a different standard.Professor Frank
lin is charged with intentionally inciting students and
others to disregard and disobey a police order to dis
perse. If, knowing the risk, he increased the risk of
personal injury to other persons, some of whom were
unaware of the risk, then his conduct is punishable.
Incitement need not be directed to increasing the likeli
hood of illegal conduct; it may also be punishable if it
places persons at heightened physical risk, as with the
cry of "fire" in a crowded theatre. Such speech is clearly
not Constitutionally protected.
It may be argued that the university should allow
more scope than the Constitution, or the current de
mands of society, would require; indeed, it has been put
to us that the university should not undertake to restrain
speech at all. We believe the university's prohibition of
incitement, given the criteria of intent, risk and immi
nence discussed above, is fully justified when speech
threatens two central university interests: (1) protection
of members of the university community and university
facilities against risks of serious injury or damage; (2)
protection against coercive intrusion on the intellectual
transactions which the university seeks to foster.

We observe also that in taking this position we have
rejected a formulation urged upon us by a group of
intervening faculty. In their view, dismissal from a
tenured position is warranted only for "failure to per
form the duties for which one was hired-teaching,
and/or research. .or for previous conviction of "some
criminal act." We believe it is inappropriate to tie tenure
proceedings to the criminal process. The standard sug
gested by the interveners would, to be sure, relieve the
Board of the difficult obligation to construct a narrative
of disputed events as a basis for judgment. However
desirable that might be, we find it almost the only virtue
in their position. A criminal proceeding may require
several years to resolve, and it may terminate favorably
to the accused for reasons which have nothing to do
with a faculty member's fitness to retain his position. It
is not obvious why the university should be dependent
on external prosecution policy, which may respond to a
number of factors but which is unlikely to reflect any
sensitive judgment of university interests as a central
concern. It does seem clear that sound decisions, on the
issue ol penalty perhaps even more than on the issue of
culpability, under university standards, will require the
kind ol intimate familiarity with the facts of a case that
can be best provided by professional peers. On this basis,
the mere tact ol conviction of criminal offenses could be
a wholly insufficient guide to wise disposition within the
university.
Relation oj Speech to the Institution
Lastly, we turn to the circumstances under which
speech occurs, and to the relationship between those
circumstances and the 'duty' and 'appropriate function'
ol the speaker. Speech and conduct by faculty members
have in other cases been treated according to different
standards depending upon whether they were judged to
be connected with the faculty member's duties or
unrelated to them.
Professor Franklin has applied the term "extracurri
cular" to his speech at the two rallies. The Board cannot
agree with this use of the term, if by it Professor
Franklin intends to place the speeches in question
outside the framework of his duties and appropriate
function in the university. There is a degree of differ
ence, to be sure, bewteen speech in the classroom and
speech outside it; it may reasonably be held, for exam
ple, that explicit advocacy of a political position un
related to the subject matter of a course is improper
when delivered in front of a class, but is not when
delivered at a rally outside the classroom door. But that
view does not automatically remove all activities that
take place outside the classroom door from the reach of
institutional regulation. In a residential university, facul
ty members relate professionally to students in many
ways: in offices, at the dinner table, in informal advising
situations, and so on. These relationships certainly do
not resemble contacts between that faculty member and
citizens on a downtown street. We believe that the ,
speech of a faculty member to a campus audience on
campus issues is subject to regulations, though the
standard applied to it will be different from that applied
to a classroom situation. Indeed, the location of the
recommended target may equally serve to define speech
in relation to the institution: a faculty member inciting
an off-campus crowd to occupy a university building
illegally is, in our view, liable to institutional regulation.
We will now consider the specific charges in the light
of these standards.
Much attention has been paid by the parties to
'Constitutional' questions that may apply to the matter
before us. We here respond to that concern by treating
some of the major issues of this kind that have been
raised in argument and briefs by the parties.
"State Action"
Constitutional standards of due process and free
speech restrain the state. At one point in this proceeding
the University administration expressed the view that
disciplinary proceedings at a private institution are not
necessarily subject to Constitutional protections, while
Professor Franklin has responded that Stanford is in
substantial part publicly financed and publicly regulated
and that the Constitution is consequently as fully appli
cable to Stanford as to an agency of the state. The
merits of these two competing views aside, the Board
does not believe that the disagreement between them
focusses upon the important issues.
Tenure proceedings at all universities, private and
public, involve an attempt to abrogate permanence of
employment for cause.
Tenure, accurately and unequivocally defined, lays no
claim wiiatever to a guarantee of lifetime employ
ment. Rather, tenure provides only that no person
continuously retained as a full-time faculty member
beyond a specified lengthy period of probationary
service may thereafter be dismissed without adequate
cause. Moreover, the particular standards of'adequate
cause' to which the tenured faculty is accountable are
themselves wholly within the prerogative of each
university to determine through its own published
rules, save only that those rules not be applied in a
manner which violates the academic freedom or the
ordinary personal civil liberties of the individual. An
institution may provide for dismissal for 'adequate
cause' arising from failure to meet a specified norm of
performance or productivity, as well as from specified
acts of affirmative misconduct.. . .
. . .This accompanying complement of academic due
process merely establishes that a fairly rigorous pro
cedure will be observed whenever formal complaint is
made that dismissal is justified on some stated ground
of professional irresponsibility, to insure the fair
determination of three facts:
1. that the stated cause is the authentic cause for
dismissal, rather than a pretense or makeweight for
considerations invading the academic freedom or
ordinary personal civil liberties of the individual;
2. that the stated cause exists in fact;
3. that the degree of demonstrated professional
irresponsibility warrants outright termination of
the individual's appointment rather than some
lesser sanction, even after taking into account the
balance of his entire service and the personal
consequences of dismissal.
(Van Alstyne, N. Bulletin oj the American Asso
ciation of University Professors. Autumn. 1971)

Given the essentially identical character of the in
quiry in tenure cases, neither the standards of due
process nor the content of regulations covering speech
need differ between private and public institutions of
higher learning. It is open to a private university to
impose Constitutional limitations on itself as a deliberate
choice of policy; in advance of the hearing the Board
committed itself to at least this much in undertaking to
provide for Professor Franklin "no less protection oi his
Constitutional rights at Stanford than that to which he
would be entitled as a member of the faculty of a state
university." In the opinion of the Board the more
significant questions are: What are the Constitutional
boundaries? What should be the university's policies
beyind the minimum standards set by the Constitution?
We emphasize at the outset that we do not regard the
conduct described in the charges filed by the University
administration to be constitutionally protected against
University discipline. On the contrary, we consider such
conduct to be clearly within the reach of institutional
authority. The university charges that the two speeches
involve advocacy that is directed to inciting or producing
imminent lawless action, and likely to produce such
action. The charge on the Computation Center incident
deals with conduct which might unjustifiably increase
the risk of injury to others.
But this is not all that needs to be said about the
matter. Professor Franklin has also characterized as
"vague" and "overbroad" the charges made against him,
and also the standards set out in the Statement of Policy
on Appointment and Tenure ("substantial and manifest
incompetence, substantial and manifest neglect of duty,
or personal conduct substantially impairing the individ
ual's performance of his appropriate function within the
university community"). Prior to the hearing, the Board
rejected Professor Franklin's challenge on the vagueness
and overbreadth of the charges; at the same time, it
reserved its decision regarding the similar claims directed
to the underlying tenure regulations. The Board now
rejects these claims as well, for reasons we discuss below.
Vagueness and Overbreadth: The State Context
The term "overbreadth," as the parties agree, means
that a regulation encompasses both conduct which the
institution can legitimately prohibit, and conduct which
is Constitutionally protected against such prohibition,
'.e., speech of the sort shielded from governmental
estraints by the First Amendment. "Vagueness" is a
lifferent but related defect which leaves the meaning of
he regulation uncertain, in such a way that a member of
„n institution cannot reasonably judge what conduct is
prohibited and what conduct is permitted.
The simplest level at which an argument of over
breadth may be met is to ask whether the conduct for
which an individual is allegedly culpable under some
regulation is Constitutionally protected. If that were
found to be the case, then obviously the Constitution
would not allow the individual to be penalized under the
regulation because, no matter how precisely and clearly
its terms describe the conduct, the prohibition was
illegitimate under Constitutional provisions. Professor
rnnl'Hn mnlfltoinr -it flir* I pta'irrroc aOQinct

him deal with actions that are Constitutionally pro
tected. He goes further, however, to argue that even if
the Constitution would allow his prosecution for that
conduct in which he engaged, and even if that conduct
were clearly covered by the University's tenure regula
tion, that regulation is inapplicable to him simply be
cause of its overbreadth. This conclusion is argued from
the principle that society places a high value on the free
exercise of speech, and that it can tolerate no "chilling
effect" on this freedom. If a regulation covers both
permitted and prohibited conduct, then it may deter
others from exercising First Amendment rights which
fall under the improperly constructed portion of the
regulation's roof. Even a person guilty of legitimately
proscribable conduct may be rewarded for pointing out
the Constitutional infirmity of the regulation under
which he was prosecuted by relieving him of the con
sequences of his guilt. For the vice of overbreadth, the
institution is forced to invalidate the regulation over its
entire range of application, and to substitute for it a
more narrowly drawn regulation which will withstand
Constitutional scrutiny.
The vagueness doctrine, by contrast, is in substantial
part a canon of ordinary fairness. If a jurisdiction has
not identified a particular kind of conduct as subject to
punishment, it should not then be able to punish
perpetrators of such conduct. Vague regulations may
share some of the disadvantages of overbroad regula
tions, because their indefiniteness may overlap Constitu
tionally-guaranteed zones of activity and deter people
from doing what they have the right to do. Where
indefinite regulations are applied to speech, the vague
ness then invades an activity of such high social utility
that it claims special protection in the Constitution.
Again, it may be justifiable to reward persons who, while
knowingly engaging in activity that the institution may
legitimately proscribe, can show that the regulation is
vague at the border between punishable and protected
conduct. Like the transgressor who points out over
breadth, the identifier of vagueness—even though he
might be guilty under a properly drawn regulation
might receive a benefit for helping to thaw improperly
frozen expression.
Vague regulations introduce other difficulties as well
in a state context. The responsibility for drafting of
governing regulations rests with legislators who are ac
countable through political processes; when they enact a
vague statute, they shift responsibility for the law
making function onto the courts, who must take up the
legislator's abandoned obligations and give the statute
meaning in the course of applying it. Such a transfer of
responsibility might unduly disturb the balance of
powers among the branches of government. Further
more, the law enforcement authorities as well as the
courts have received the responsibility transferred by the
vague regulation, and may thereby he afforded unduly
wide discretion in the selection of whom to prosecute.
Obviously, such freedom might be exercised arbitrarily,
or for the purpose of retaliating against Constitutionally
protected activities. Finally, the adjudicating process
itsrlf (!•!• <T>ri v»v wwiie regulations: both the parties
and the decision maker are at a loss as to how to prepare
the case, what evidence to introduce, what arguments to
make, and what standards to use in deciding it.
Vagueness and Overbreadth: The University Context
These reflections on the briefs and arguments of the
parties regarding the doctrines of vagueness and over
breadth spell out certain problems, but hardly take us
directly to a resolution of the present issues. The legal
material pressed on us by the parties deals with problems
of vagueness and overbreadth in contexts which often
depart substantially from that applying in this case. It is
on this ground that we set aside the cases on student
discipline that both parties have reviewed for us in some
detail. Our examination of these cases persuades us that
the law in this field is incompletely settled; a rapid rate
of contemporary change has generated substantial dis
agreement and a conspicuously confused rationale.
There may be a trend toward enhanced protection, and
an employment of concepts of vagueness and over
breadth similar to those urged upon us by Professor
Franklin. But we recognize important differences in the
relationship between the institution and students, on the
one hand, the faculty, on the other. Students are much
more numerous; their time in the institution is shorter;
their fiscal relationaship with it is entirely different; and
a different tradition of academic freedom obtains. These
difficulties emphasize our conclusion that the problems
of vagueness and overbreadth, as well as other aspects of
the case, must be analyzed with due regard for the
framework—and the atmosphere-of the relation be
tween a faculty member and the University.
We may dispense quickly with two of the difficulties
engendered by vagueness. In some other procedural
system, vague regulations may produce problems in the
preparation, hearing and decision of the case, since none
of the participants can find his way in the fog created by
the lack of underlying standards. However, we consider
the charges in this case reasonably narrow and specific.
In our opinion, they are fully adequate to state an
intelligible conception of the case on the part of the
University administration, give Professor Franklin notice
of the conduct with which he is charged and enable him
to prepare and present his defense, and equip the Board
to shape the hearing and focus on commonly understood
issues. Beyond this, the Board afforded each party the
opportunity to obtain pre-hearing disclosure from the
other party of information and contentions relevant to
the case.
We also do not believe that the role of vague statutes
in unbalancing the separation of governmental processes
is one that need concern us in this situation. The faculty
of the university is a small community, characterized by
face-to-face contact and personal interaction. Legislation
proscribing conduct in a disciplinary context is rare;
when it occurs, it merely codifies previously shared
understandings. While there is clearly some allocation of
function as between faculty and administration, with
ultimate authority retained in the Board of Trustees as a
matter of legal right, interchanges and combinations of
roles are heavily involved in the actual governance of the
university. Faculty members relate to the institution
more through practice and informally negotiated con
sensus than through hierarchically codified rule. Rules of
conduct thus trace their source to slowly evolving
tradition rather than to abrupt acts of legislative inter
vention by persons in positions of formal authority.
Lack of centralization—often aided by small size and
extensive interaction—obviate for the university faculty
the need for the kind of detailed directions that guide
the armies of bureaucrats upon which larger organiza
tions often rely for administering centrally-determined
policies.
There remain the problems of fair warning, of over
breadth, and of undue discretion in enforcement.
Against the background of the relationship between
citizen and state, it is easy to make these issues appear
genuine and substantial. Plainly, it would be intolerable
for the state to provide that a citizen could be im
prisoned for "substantial and manifest incompetence,
substantial and manifest neglect of duty, or personal
conduct substantially impairing the individual's perfor
mance of his appropriate functions within the communi
ty." The situation is different, we believe, when the
public to which similar regulations are addressed is the
faculty of the university. In the more restricted setting,
the regulation invokes a web of largely unwritten rules as
tough and living as the British Constitution. Powerful
traditions, modified by contemporary practice, furnish a
reliable guide to faculty conduct, and entrust review
procedures to faculty peers-in this case, to a faculty
hearing board elected by the faculty. Nothing in those
traditions collides with Constitutionally guarded free
doms. On the contrary, it is the University's responsi
bility to enhance the exercise of rights of speech which
the First Amendment merely protects against govern
mental interference.
We would emphasize the meager record of the aca
demic community's experience with faculty discipline.
This may well be because faculty members chose their
profession in part because they embrace traditional
faculty norms, therefore performing willingly what writ
ten rules coerce in other systems. Indeed, the kind of
written rules contained in court decisions and codes are
not merely responses to the need for prior warning.
They are also the result of society's experience in
enforcing pre-existing norms against a partly recalcitrant
population—as suggested by the maxim that "ignorance
of the law is no excuse." The general practice of
conforming to norms may instruct individual faculty
members about those norms just as clearly as would
occasional cases of discipline for breach of standards.
This wide observance of the norms of faculty conduct
cannot disguise the fact of strong disagreement with
them among some faculty; dissent from a rule, or even
from the entire system of rules, obviously exists, and
must exist to furnish the motive power for necessary
change. But disagreement with a rule is not the same as
ignorance of its terms.
It is perhaps true that a fully-developed code would
be a more readily interprctable guide. But we believe
that the institution and its members would pay a heavy
price for such codification in terms of lost faculty
autonomy and initiative, and in over-bureaucratization.
This detriment should be carefully weighed before the
university accepts regulations spelled out in greater
detail. What we have called the web of unwritten rules of
faculty conduct is not clear or easy to apply in all cases;
on the contrary, there are borderline cases, and intracta
ble problems of application. But codified systems of
rules, too, are inevitably characterized by gaps and
conflicts—and suffer from certain pathologies precisely
because they are written. For example, rules designed to
protect speech by limiting other speech are double
edged; in either direction, they cut into regions that lie
under the protection o<*the First Amendment.

On balance, we favor the present reliance on largely
unwritten standards. But whatever the future holds in
this regard, we find the present understandings adequate
ly clear to guide faculty members in choosing among
various courses of action in particular situations.
Statement of Policy on Appointment and Tenure
The duties of a faculty member include, obviously,
specific teaching and scholarly obligations that are un
derstood primarily in terms of arrangements reached
voluntarily between the individual and his department or
some other institutional unit. Such obligations are gen
erally not spelled out in writing, perhaps because pro
fessors object to formal job descriptions. Nonetheless,
failure to meet commitments of this kind would clearly
constitute "substantial and manifest neglect of duty."
Similarly, "performance of his appropriate function in
the University" means the meeting of the full range of
agreed-upon institutional obligations. Professor Franklin,
in his final argument, characterizes the Statement of
Policy on Appointment and Tenure as being worded so
as to protect the performance of these positive obliga
tions—to enable the institution to weed out the demon
strably incompetent. But the unwritten understandings
discussed above give to the terms "duty" and "appro
priate function" a character of limitation as well as of
obligation. The fulfillment of a faculty member's duty
to his students and colleagues is understood to involve
an obligation to refrain from corrupting the intellectual
transactions that are the essence of the university, and
the other activities that support these. This does not, of
course, mean that he must exhibit political conformity
with the objectives of the institution; the university
must accommodate the questioning of contemporary
goals and structures, and must even tolerate the view
that the university, or the professoriate, should not
survive. There is positive benefit in having on the faculty
active representatives of political views that, while they
may be considered extreme or dissenting here, are held
by large numbers of people in the world and comprise a
dominant form of political organization in many places.
It seems likely that students can get a better education
about the nature of these ideas from proponents than
they can obtain through an exposure only to disengaged
analysts. Proponents are often also proselytizers: that
freedom should be granted also so long as its exercise
does not infringe upon the free choice of others. The
code of the institution does, however, demand that the
speech and conduct of a professor stay behind the line
of inciting or physically causing the impairment of the
institution's functions, especially its function as a forum
in which various other points of view can also be heard.
Policy on Campus Disruptions
The Policy on Campus Disruptions (hereafter called
the Policy) first appeared in 1965. It was a first attempt
to provide more detailed codification of conduct that
might be proscribed on the campus. The Policy was
clearly never intended to list all behavior that a faculty
member might engage in that was against university
policy; indeed, its original authors (the no-longer-extant
Committee on University Policy) did not even aim it
explicitly at faculty, so that it later had to be ratified by
the Academic Senate in 1968. That bit of legislative
history is interesting: although there was some debate
about a linked proposal concerning the judicial mechan
ism for dealing with faculty violators, no member of the
Senate offered dissent to a single substantive element of
the Policy. This episode shows, perhaps more clearly
than anything else, that the Policy was widely and
immediately accepted because it articulated some as
sumptions about appropriate conduct that most faculty
members heid in common.
Another way of illustrating this proposition is to
suppose that there were no Policy. Would the University
then be powerless to take action against a faculty
member for any of the acts described therein? In other
words, do we really insist on requiring that every
proscribed action be named in a document before we
place it on the other side of the line? The Board believes
that the answer to each of these questions is "no." We
have concluded above that there are common under
standings of appropriate faculty conduct, and that con
duct therefore exists which, even though it may not be
listed in an official policy, is nevertheless sanctionable.
With this background, we can consider the specific
conduct of the Policy. It lists several general positive
obligations:
a. to maintain "an atmosphere conducive to schol
arly pursuits"
b. "to preserve the dignity and seriousness of
University ceremonies and public exercises"
c. "to respect the rights of individuals"
The Policy also includes several specific areas of pro
scribed conduct:
a. "to prevent or disrupt the effective carrying out
of a University function or approved activity such
as lectures, meetings, [and] public events. ..
b. "to obstruct the legitimate movement of any
person about the campus or in any University
building or facility."
The Board believes that these provisions provide a clear
statement amplifying and defining some of the concepts
expressed more generally in the Statement of Policy on
Appointment and Tenure. Its applicability to faculty
members is beyond doubt.
Protected pi Punishable Speech: The Relation of the
Policy " to Incitement
We now turn to the fact that the Policy does not
specifically prohibit incitement. The failure to deal with
such speech is not, in the Board's view, the result of a
conscious decision to protect all speech. Rather, it is one
aspect of the history of the Policy, which was formu
lated quickly to meet a momentary need for the articula
tion of certain basic, commonly-held views. The Board
does not accept the argument that the Policy's omission
of a discussion of incitement automatically removes it
from prohibition.
In the Board's view, incitement to illegal conduct—as
we shall define it below-is an abuse of power. Such
abuse is a serious matter in a university, especially when
faculty members are addressing students. We see no
excuse for placing certain conduct beyond the law of the
campus, as the Policy does, and then implying blanket
permission for faculty members to incite others to
engage in that same conduct.
Protected vs. Punishable Speech: Standards
We do, however, see every reason for taking care that
the standard for incitement is carefully drawn, with due
cognizance of those First Amendment protections that
apply to the relation between state and citizen. A wide
range of standards has been offered to us. At one
extreme, we were urged by counsel for Professor Frank

lin that no speech should be punished by the university,
regardless of its incitement to illegal acts. At the other,
we might have ruled sanctionable the advocacy of
vaguely-defined violent action proposed for some time in
the indefinite future. In ruling on the White Plaza and
Old Union speeches, we shall meet a standard suggested
by the Supreme Court decision discussed at length by
the parties in this case. The court in Brandenburg vs.
Ohio (395 US 444) held that to be punishable, advocacy
must "be directed to inciting or producing imminent
lawless action, and. . .likely to produce such action." A
vague exhortation is not punishable under such a stand
ard; on the other extreme it is clearly unreasonable to
demand, as did counsel for Professor Franklin, that there
be an exact correspondence between specific acts advo
cated and those that follow. Subsequent illegal acts arc
not in fact required for incitement to be punishable
under this standard. Such acts might, for example, have
been prevented by external circumstances, or illegal acts
might occur but differ from those advocated. Subse
quent acts are useful in determining the level and
character of risk that obtained at the time of the alleged
incitement. In judging the applicability of the standard
cited, the Board has been guided by the following
considerations:
a. What is the entire context surrounding the alleged
incitement, including the immediate risk of lawless
action?
b. What is specifically being communicated to the
audience?
c. What did the speaker intend? We judge intent on
the basis of the speaker's own knowledge of the
context for his speech, his awareness of the level of
the risk, and the words he actually used.
In the application of this standard, punishable advocacy
need not identify particular acts, but it must include
advocacy of lawless conduct. Inclusion of advocacy of
legal acts with advocacy of lawless conduct does not
immunize that advocacy from punishment. In the appli
cation of this standard to the campus, it is clear that
"lawless action" refers to acts against the law of the
campus, that is, to conduct proscribed by the Policy or
University regulations, or clearly prohibited under the
kind of common understanding of conduct discussed
above.
With respect to the Computation Center incident, the
Board has applied a different standard.Professor Frank
lin is charged with intentionally inciting students and
others to disregard and disobey a police order to dis
perse. If, knowing the risk, he increased the risk of
personal injury to other persons, some of whom were
unaware of the risk, then his conduct is punishable.
Incitement need not be directed to increasing the likeli
hood of illegal conduct; it may also be punishable if it
places persons at heightened physical risk, as with the
cry of "fire" in a crowded theatre. Such speech is clearly
not Constitutionally protected.
It may be argued that the university should allow
more scope than the Constitution, or the current de
mands of society, would require; indeed, it has been put
to us that the university should not undertake to restrain
speech at all. We believe the university's prohibition of
incitement, given the criteria of intent, risk and immi
nence discussed above, is fully justified when speech
threatens two central university interests: (1) protection
of members of the university community and university
facilities against risks of serious injury or damage; (2)
protection against coercive intrusion on the intellectual
transactions which the university seeks to foster.

We observe also that in taking this position we have
rejected a formulation urged upon us by a group of
intervening faculty. In their view, dismissal from a
tenured position is warranted only for "failure to per
form the duties for which one was hired-teaching,
and/or research. .or for previous conviction of "some
criminal act." We believe it is inappropriate to tie tenure
proceedings to the criminal process. The standard sug
gested by the interveners would, to be sure, relieve the
Board of the difficult obligation to construct a narrative
of disputed events as a basis for judgment. However
desirable that might be, we find it almost the only virtue
in their position. A criminal proceeding may require
several years to resolve, and it may terminate favorably
to the accused for reasons which have nothing to do
with a faculty member's fitness to retain his position. It
is not obvious why the university should be dependent
on external prosecution policy, which may respond to a
number of factors but which is unlikely to reflect any
sensitive judgment of university interests as a central
concern. It does seem clear that sound decisions, on the
issue ol penalty perhaps even more than on the issue of
culpability, under university standards, will require the
kind ol intimate familiarity with the facts of a case that
can be best provided by professional peers. On this basis,
the mere tact ol conviction of criminal offenses could be
a wholly insufficient guide to wise disposition within the
university.
Relation oj Speech to the Institution
Lastly, we turn to the circumstances under which
speech occurs, and to the relationship between those
circumstances and the 'duty' and 'appropriate function'
ol the speaker. Speech and conduct by faculty members
have in other cases been treated according to different
standards depending upon whether they were judged to
be connected with the faculty member's duties or
unrelated to them.
Professor Franklin has applied the term "extracurri
cular" to his speech at the two rallies. The Board cannot
agree with this use of the term, if by it Professor
Franklin intends to place the speeches in question
outside the framework of his duties and appropriate
function in the university. There is a degree of differ
ence, to be sure, bewteen speech in the classroom and
speech outside it; it may reasonably be held, for exam
ple, that explicit advocacy of a political position un
related to the subject matter of a course is improper
when delivered in front of a class, but is not when
delivered at a rally outside the classroom door. But that
view does not automatically remove all activities that
take place outside the classroom door from the reach of
institutional regulation. In a residential university, facul
ty members relate professionally to students in many
ways: in offices, at the dinner table, in informal advising
situations, and so on. These relationships certainly do
not resemble contacts between that faculty member and
citizens on a downtown street. We believe that the ,
speech of a faculty member to a campus audience on
campus issues is subject to regulations, though the
standard applied to it will be different from that applied
to a classroom situation. Indeed, the location of the
recommended target may equally serve to define speech
in relation to the institution: a faculty member inciting
an off-campus crowd to occupy a university building
illegally is, in our view, liable to institutional regulation.
We will now consider the specific charges in the light
of these standards.
Much attention has been paid by the parties to
'Constitutional' questions that may apply to the matter
before us. We here respond to that concern by treating
some of the major issues of this kind that have been
raised in argument and briefs by the parties.
"State Action"
Constitutional standards of due process and free
speech restrain the state. At one point in this proceeding
the University administration expressed the view that
disciplinary proceedings at a private institution are not
necessarily subject to Constitutional protections, while
Professor Franklin has responded that Stanford is in
substantial part publicly financed and publicly regulated
and that the Constitution is consequently as fully appli
cable to Stanford as to an agency of the state. The
merits of these two competing views aside, the Board
does not believe that the disagreement between them
focusses upon the important issues.
Tenure proceedings at all universities, private and
public, involve an attempt to abrogate permanence of
employment for cause.
Tenure, accurately and unequivocally defined, lays no
claim wiiatever to a guarantee of lifetime employ
ment. Rather, tenure provides only that no person
continuously retained as a full-time faculty member
beyond a specified lengthy period of probationary
service may thereafter be dismissed without adequate
cause. Moreover, the particular standards of'adequate
cause' to which the tenured faculty is accountable are
themselves wholly within the prerogative of each
university to determine through its own published
rules, save only that those rules not be applied in a
manner which violates the academic freedom or the
ordinary personal civil liberties of the individual. An
institution may provide for dismissal for 'adequate
cause' arising from failure to meet a specified norm of
performance or productivity, as well as from specified
acts of affirmative misconduct.. . .
. . .This accompanying complement of academic due
process merely establishes that a fairly rigorous pro
cedure will be observed whenever formal complaint is
made that dismissal is justified on some stated ground
of professional irresponsibility, to insure the fair
determination of three facts:
1. that the stated cause is the authentic cause for
dismissal, rather than a pretense or makeweight for
considerations invading the academic freedom or
ordinary personal civil liberties of the individual;
2. that the stated cause exists in fact;
3. that the degree of demonstrated professional
irresponsibility warrants outright termination of
the individual's appointment rather than some
lesser sanction, even after taking into account the
balance of his entire service and the personal
consequences of dismissal.
(Van Alstyne, N. Bulletin oj the American Asso
ciation of University Professors. Autumn. 1971)

Given the essentially identical character of the in
quiry in tenure cases, neither the standards of due
process nor the content of regulations covering speech
need differ between private and public institutions of
higher learning. It is open to a private university to
impose Constitutional limitations on itself as a deliberate
choice of policy; in advance of the hearing the Board
committed itself to at least this much in undertaking to
provide for Professor Franklin "no less protection oi his
Constitutional rights at Stanford than that to which he
would be entitled as a member of the faculty of a state
university." In the opinion of the Board the more
significant questions are: What are the Constitutional
boundaries? What should be the university's policies
beyind the minimum standards set by the Constitution?
We emphasize at the outset that we do not regard the
conduct described in the charges filed by the University
administration to be constitutionally protected against
University discipline. On the contrary, we consider such
conduct to be clearly within the reach of institutional
authority. The university charges that the two speeches
involve advocacy that is directed to inciting or producing
imminent lawless action, and likely to produce such
action. The charge on the Computation Center incident
deals with conduct which might unjustifiably increase
the risk of injury to others.
But this is not all that needs to be said about the
matter. Professor Franklin has also characterized as
"vague" and "overbroad" the charges made against him,
and also the standards set out in the Statement of Policy
on Appointment and Tenure ("substantial and manifest
incompetence, substantial and manifest neglect of duty,
or personal conduct substantially impairing the individ
ual's performance of his appropriate function within the
university community"). Prior to the hearing, the Board
rejected Professor Franklin's challenge on the vagueness
and overbreadth of the charges; at the same time, it
reserved its decision regarding the similar claims directed
to the underlying tenure regulations. The Board now
rejects these claims as well, for reasons we discuss below.
Vagueness and Overbreadth: The State Context
The term "overbreadth," as the parties agree, means
that a regulation encompasses both conduct which the
institution can legitimately prohibit, and conduct which
is Constitutionally protected against such prohibition,
'.e., speech of the sort shielded from governmental
estraints by the First Amendment. "Vagueness" is a
lifferent but related defect which leaves the meaning of
he regulation uncertain, in such a way that a member of
„n institution cannot reasonably judge what conduct is
prohibited and what conduct is permitted.
The simplest level at which an argument of over
breadth may be met is to ask whether the conduct for
which an individual is allegedly culpable under some
regulation is Constitutionally protected. If that were
found to be the case, then obviously the Constitution
would not allow the individual to be penalized under the
regulation because, no matter how precisely and clearly
its terms describe the conduct, the prohibition was
illegitimate under Constitutional provisions. Professor
rnnl'Hn mnlfltoinr -it flir* I pta'irrroc aOQinct

him deal with actions that are Constitutionally pro
tected. He goes further, however, to argue that even if
the Constitution would allow his prosecution for that
conduct in which he engaged, and even if that conduct
were clearly covered by the University's tenure regula
tion, that regulation is inapplicable to him simply be
cause of its overbreadth. This conclusion is argued from
the principle that society places a high value on the free
exercise of speech, and that it can tolerate no "chilling
effect" on this freedom. If a regulation covers both
permitted and prohibited conduct, then it may deter
others from exercising First Amendment rights which
fall under the improperly constructed portion of the
regulation's roof. Even a person guilty of legitimately
proscribable conduct may be rewarded for pointing out
the Constitutional infirmity of the regulation under
which he was prosecuted by relieving him of the con
sequences of his guilt. For the vice of overbreadth, the
institution is forced to invalidate the regulation over its
entire range of application, and to substitute for it a
more narrowly drawn regulation which will withstand
Constitutional scrutiny.
The vagueness doctrine, by contrast, is in substantial
part a canon of ordinary fairness. If a jurisdiction has
not identified a particular kind of conduct as subject to
punishment, it should not then be able to punish
perpetrators of such conduct. Vague regulations may
share some of the disadvantages of overbroad regula
tions, because their indefiniteness may overlap Constitu
tionally-guaranteed zones of activity and deter people
from doing what they have the right to do. Where
indefinite regulations are applied to speech, the vague
ness then invades an activity of such high social utility
that it claims special protection in the Constitution.
Again, it may be justifiable to reward persons who, while
knowingly engaging in activity that the institution may
legitimately proscribe, can show that the regulation is
vague at the border between punishable and protected
conduct. Like the transgressor who points out over
breadth, the identifier of vagueness—even though he
might be guilty under a properly drawn regulation
might receive a benefit for helping to thaw improperly
frozen expression.
Vague regulations introduce other difficulties as well
in a state context. The responsibility for drafting of
governing regulations rests with legislators who are ac
countable through political processes; when they enact a
vague statute, they shift responsibility for the law
making function onto the courts, who must take up the
legislator's abandoned obligations and give the statute
meaning in the course of applying it. Such a transfer of
responsibility might unduly disturb the balance of
powers among the branches of government. Further
more, the law enforcement authorities as well as the
courts have received the responsibility transferred by the
vague regulation, and may thereby he afforded unduly
wide discretion in the selection of whom to prosecute.
Obviously, such freedom might be exercised arbitrarily,
or for the purpose of retaliating against Constitutionally
protected activities. Finally, the adjudicating process
itsrlf (!•!• <T>ri v»v wwiie regulations: both the parties
and the decision maker are at a loss as to how to prepare
the case, what evidence to introduce, what arguments to
make, and what standards to use in deciding it.
Vagueness and Overbreadth: The University Context
These reflections on the briefs and arguments of the
parties regarding the doctrines of vagueness and over
breadth spell out certain problems, but hardly take us
directly to a resolution of the present issues. The legal
material pressed on us by the parties deals with problems
of vagueness and overbreadth in contexts which often
depart substantially from that applying in this case. It is
on this ground that we set aside the cases on student
discipline that both parties have reviewed for us in some
detail. Our examination of these cases persuades us that
the law in this field is incompletely settled; a rapid rate
of contemporary change has generated substantial dis
agreement and a conspicuously confused rationale.
There may be a trend toward enhanced protection, and
an employment of concepts of vagueness and over
breadth similar to those urged upon us by Professor
Franklin. But we recognize important differences in the
relationship between the institution and students, on the
one hand, the faculty, on the other. Students are much
more numerous; their time in the institution is shorter;
their fiscal relationaship with it is entirely different; and
a different tradition of academic freedom obtains. These
difficulties emphasize our conclusion that the problems
of vagueness and overbreadth, as well as other aspects of
the case, must be analyzed with due regard for the
framework—and the atmosphere-of the relation be
tween a faculty member and the University.
We may dispense quickly with two of the difficulties
engendered by vagueness. In some other procedural
system, vague regulations may produce problems in the
preparation, hearing and decision of the case, since none
of the participants can find his way in the fog created by
the lack of underlying standards. However, we consider
the charges in this case reasonably narrow and specific.
In our opinion, they are fully adequate to state an
intelligible conception of the case on the part of the
University administration, give Professor Franklin notice
of the conduct with which he is charged and enable him
to prepare and present his defense, and equip the Board
to shape the hearing and focus on commonly understood
issues. Beyond this, the Board afforded each party the
opportunity to obtain pre-hearing disclosure from the
other party of information and contentions relevant to
the case.
We also do not believe that the role of vague statutes
in unbalancing the separation of governmental processes
is one that need concern us in this situation. The faculty
of the university is a small community, characterized by
face-to-face contact and personal interaction. Legislation
proscribing conduct in a disciplinary context is rare;
when it occurs, it merely codifies previously shared
understandings. While there is clearly some allocation of
function as between faculty and administration, with
ultimate authority retained in the Board of Trustees as a
matter of legal right, interchanges and combinations of
roles are heavily involved in the actual governance of the
university. Faculty members relate to the institution
more through practice and informally negotiated con
sensus than through hierarchically codified rule. Rules of
conduct thus trace their source to slowly evolving
tradition rather than to abrupt acts of legislative inter
vention by persons in positions of formal authority.
Lack of centralization—often aided by small size and
extensive interaction—obviate for the university faculty
the need for the kind of detailed directions that guide
the armies of bureaucrats upon which larger organiza
tions often rely for administering centrally-determined
policies.
There remain the problems of fair warning, of over
breadth, and of undue discretion in enforcement.
Against the background of the relationship between
citizen and state, it is easy to make these issues appear
genuine and substantial. Plainly, it would be intolerable
for the state to provide that a citizen could be im
prisoned for "substantial and manifest incompetence,
substantial and manifest neglect of duty, or personal
conduct substantially impairing the individual's perfor
mance of his appropriate functions within the communi
ty." The situation is different, we believe, when the
public to which similar regulations are addressed is the
faculty of the university. In the more restricted setting,
the regulation invokes a web of largely unwritten rules as
tough and living as the British Constitution. Powerful
traditions, modified by contemporary practice, furnish a
reliable guide to faculty conduct, and entrust review
procedures to faculty peers-in this case, to a faculty
hearing board elected by the faculty. Nothing in those
traditions collides with Constitutionally guarded free
doms. On the contrary, it is the University's responsi
bility to enhance the exercise of rights of speech which
the First Amendment merely protects against govern
mental interference.
We would emphasize the meager record of the aca
demic community's experience with faculty discipline.
This may well be because faculty members chose their
profession in part because they embrace traditional
faculty norms, therefore performing willingly what writ
ten rules coerce in other systems. Indeed, the kind of
written rules contained in court decisions and codes are
not merely responses to the need for prior warning.
They are also the result of society's experience in
enforcing pre-existing norms against a partly recalcitrant
population—as suggested by the maxim that "ignorance
of the law is no excuse." The general practice of
conforming to norms may instruct individual faculty
members about those norms just as clearly as would
occasional cases of discipline for breach of standards.
This wide observance of the norms of faculty conduct
cannot disguise the fact of strong disagreement with
them among some faculty; dissent from a rule, or even
from the entire system of rules, obviously exists, and
must exist to furnish the motive power for necessary
change. But disagreement with a rule is not the same as
ignorance of its terms.
It is perhaps true that a fully-developed code would
be a more readily interprctable guide. But we believe
that the institution and its members would pay a heavy
price for such codification in terms of lost faculty
autonomy and initiative, and in over-bureaucratization.
This detriment should be carefully weighed before the
university accepts regulations spelled out in greater
detail. What we have called the web of unwritten rules of
faculty conduct is not clear or easy to apply in all cases;
on the contrary, there are borderline cases, and intracta
ble problems of application. But codified systems of
rules, too, are inevitably characterized by gaps and
conflicts—and suffer from certain pathologies precisely
because they are written. For example, rules designed to
protect speech by limiting other speech are double
edged; in either direction, they cut into regions that lie
under the protection o<*the First Amendment.

On balance, we favor the present reliance on largely
unwritten standards. But whatever the future holds in
this regard, we find the present understandings adequate
ly clear to guide faculty members in choosing among
various courses of action in particular situations.
Statement of Policy on Appointment and Tenure
The duties of a faculty member include, obviously,
specific teaching and scholarly obligations that are un
derstood primarily in terms of arrangements reached
voluntarily between the individual and his department or
some other institutional unit. Such obligations are gen
erally not spelled out in writing, perhaps because pro
fessors object to formal job descriptions. Nonetheless,
failure to meet commitments of this kind would clearly
constitute "substantial and manifest neglect of duty."
Similarly, "performance of his appropriate function in
the University" means the meeting of the full range of
agreed-upon institutional obligations. Professor Franklin,
in his final argument, characterizes the Statement of
Policy on Appointment and Tenure as being worded so
as to protect the performance of these positive obliga
tions—to enable the institution to weed out the demon
strably incompetent. But the unwritten understandings
discussed above give to the terms "duty" and "appro
priate function" a character of limitation as well as of
obligation. The fulfillment of a faculty member's duty
to his students and colleagues is understood to involve
an obligation to refrain from corrupting the intellectual
transactions that are the essence of the university, and
the other activities that support these. This does not, of
course, mean that he must exhibit political conformity
with the objectives of the institution; the university
must accommodate the questioning of contemporary
goals and structures, and must even tolerate the view
that the university, or the professoriate, should not
survive. There is positive benefit in having on the faculty
active representatives of political views that, while they
may be considered extreme or dissenting here, are held
by large numbers of people in the world and comprise a
dominant form of political organization in many places.
It seems likely that students can get a better education
about the nature of these ideas from proponents than
they can obtain through an exposure only to disengaged
analysts. Proponents are often also proselytizers: that
freedom should be granted also so long as its exercise
does not infringe upon the free choice of others. The
code of the institution does, however, demand that the
speech and conduct of a professor stay behind the line
of inciting or physically causing the impairment of the
institution's functions, especially its function as a forum
in which various other points of view can also be heard.
Policy on Campus Disruptions
The Policy on Campus Disruptions (hereafter called
the Policy) first appeared in 1965. It was a first attempt
to provide more detailed codification of conduct that
might be proscribed on the campus. The Policy was
clearly never intended to list all behavior that a faculty
member might engage in that was against university
policy; indeed, its original authors (the no-longer-extant
Committee on University Policy) did not even aim it
explicitly at faculty, so that it later had to be ratified by
the Academic Senate in 1968. That bit of legislative
history is interesting: although there was some debate
about a linked proposal concerning the judicial mechan
ism for dealing with faculty violators, no member of the
Senate offered dissent to a single substantive element of
the Policy. This episode shows, perhaps more clearly
than anything else, that the Policy was widely and
immediately accepted because it articulated some as
sumptions about appropriate conduct that most faculty
members heid in common.
Another way of illustrating this proposition is to
suppose that there were no Policy. Would the University
then be powerless to take action against a faculty
member for any of the acts described therein? In other
words, do we really insist on requiring that every
proscribed action be named in a document before we
place it on the other side of the line? The Board believes
that the answer to each of these questions is "no." We
have concluded above that there are common under
standings of appropriate faculty conduct, and that con
duct therefore exists which, even though it may not be
listed in an official policy, is nevertheless sanctionable.
With this background, we can consider the specific
conduct of the Policy. It lists several general positive
obligations:
a. to maintain "an atmosphere conducive to schol
arly pursuits"
b. "to preserve the dignity and seriousness of
University ceremonies and public exercises"
c. "to respect the rights of individuals"
The Policy also includes several specific areas of pro
scribed conduct:
a. "to prevent or disrupt the effective carrying out
of a University function or approved activity such
as lectures, meetings, [and] public events. ..
b. "to obstruct the legitimate movement of any
person about the campus or in any University
building or facility."
The Board believes that these provisions provide a clear
statement amplifying and defining some of the concepts
expressed more generally in the Statement of Policy on
Appointment and Tenure. Its applicability to faculty
members is beyond doubt.
Protected pi Punishable Speech: The Relation of the
Policy " to Incitement
We now turn to the fact that the Policy does not
specifically prohibit incitement. The failure to deal with
such speech is not, in the Board's view, the result of a
conscious decision to protect all speech. Rather, it is one
aspect of the history of the Policy, which was formu
lated quickly to meet a momentary need for the articula
tion of certain basic, commonly-held views. The Board
does not accept the argument that the Policy's omission
of a discussion of incitement automatically removes it
from prohibition.
In the Board's view, incitement to illegal conduct—as
we shall define it below-is an abuse of power. Such
abuse is a serious matter in a university, especially when
faculty members are addressing students. We see no
excuse for placing certain conduct beyond the law of the
campus, as the Policy does, and then implying blanket
permission for faculty members to incite others to
engage in that same conduct.
Protected vs. Punishable Speech: Standards
We do, however, see every reason for taking care that
the standard for incitement is carefully drawn, with due
cognizance of those First Amendment protections that
apply to the relation between state and citizen. A wide
range of standards has been offered to us. At one
extreme, we were urged by counsel for Professor Frank

lin that no speech should be punished by the university,
regardless of its incitement to illegal acts. At the other,
we might have ruled sanctionable the advocacy of
vaguely-defined violent action proposed for some time in
the indefinite future. In ruling on the White Plaza and
Old Union speeches, we shall meet a standard suggested
by the Supreme Court decision discussed at length by
the parties in this case. The court in Brandenburg vs.
Ohio (395 US 444) held that to be punishable, advocacy
must "be directed to inciting or producing imminent
lawless action, and. . .likely to produce such action." A
vague exhortation is not punishable under such a stand
ard; on the other extreme it is clearly unreasonable to
demand, as did counsel for Professor Franklin, that there
be an exact correspondence between specific acts advo
cated and those that follow. Subsequent illegal acts arc
not in fact required for incitement to be punishable
under this standard. Such acts might, for example, have
been prevented by external circumstances, or illegal acts
might occur but differ from those advocated. Subse
quent acts are useful in determining the level and
character of risk that obtained at the time of the alleged
incitement. In judging the applicability of the standard
cited, the Board has been guided by the following
considerations:
a. What is the entire context surrounding the alleged
incitement, including the immediate risk of lawless
action?
b. What is specifically being communicated to the
audience?
c. What did the speaker intend? We judge intent on
the basis of the speaker's own knowledge of the
context for his speech, his awareness of the level of
the risk, and the words he actually used.
In the application of this standard, punishable advocacy
need not identify particular acts, but it must include
advocacy of lawless conduct. Inclusion of advocacy of
legal acts with advocacy of lawless conduct does not
immunize that advocacy from punishment. In the appli
cation of this standard to the campus, it is clear that
"lawless action" refers to acts against the law of the
campus, that is, to conduct proscribed by the Policy or
University regulations, or clearly prohibited under the
kind of common understanding of conduct discussed
above.
With respect to the Computation Center incident, the
Board has applied a different standard.Professor Frank
lin is charged with intentionally inciting students and
others to disregard and disobey a police order to dis
perse. If, knowing the risk, he increased the risk of
personal injury to other persons, some of whom were
unaware of the risk, then his conduct is punishable.
Incitement need not be directed to increasing the likeli
hood of illegal conduct; it may also be punishable if it
places persons at heightened physical risk, as with the
cry of "fire" in a crowded theatre. Such speech is clearly
not Constitutionally protected.
It may be argued that the university should allow
more scope than the Constitution, or the current de
mands of society, would require; indeed, it has been put
to us that the university should not undertake to restrain
speech at all. We believe the university's prohibition of
incitement, given the criteria of intent, risk and immi
nence discussed above, is fully justified when speech
threatens two central university interests: (1) protection
of members of the university community and university
facilities against risks of serious injury or damage; (2)
protection against coercive intrusion on the intellectual
transactions which the university seeks to foster.

We observe also that in taking this position we have
rejected a formulation urged upon us by a group of
intervening faculty. In their view, dismissal from a
tenured position is warranted only for "failure to per
form the duties for which one was hired-teaching,
and/or research. .or for previous conviction of "some
criminal act." We believe it is inappropriate to tie tenure
proceedings to the criminal process. The standard sug
gested by the interveners would, to be sure, relieve the
Board of the difficult obligation to construct a narrative
of disputed events as a basis for judgment. However
desirable that might be, we find it almost the only virtue
in their position. A criminal proceeding may require
several years to resolve, and it may terminate favorably
to the accused for reasons which have nothing to do
with a faculty member's fitness to retain his position. It
is not obvious why the university should be dependent
on external prosecution policy, which may respond to a
number of factors but which is unlikely to reflect any
sensitive judgment of university interests as a central
concern. It does seem clear that sound decisions, on the
issue ol penalty perhaps even more than on the issue of
culpability, under university standards, will require the
kind ol intimate familiarity with the facts of a case that
can be best provided by professional peers. On this basis,
the mere tact ol conviction of criminal offenses could be
a wholly insufficient guide to wise disposition within the
university.
Relation oj Speech to the Institution
Lastly, we turn to the circumstances under which
speech occurs, and to the relationship between those
circumstances and the 'duty' and 'appropriate function'
ol the speaker. Speech and conduct by faculty members
have in other cases been treated according to different
standards depending upon whether they were judged to
be connected with the faculty member's duties or
unrelated to them.
Professor Franklin has applied the term "extracurri
cular" to his speech at the two rallies. The Board cannot
agree with this use of the term, if by it Professor
Franklin intends to place the speeches in question
outside the framework of his duties and appropriate
function in the university. There is a degree of differ
ence, to be sure, bewteen speech in the classroom and
speech outside it; it may reasonably be held, for exam
ple, that explicit advocacy of a political position un
related to the subject matter of a course is improper
when delivered in front of a class, but is not when
delivered at a rally outside the classroom door. But that
view does not automatically remove all activities that
take place outside the classroom door from the reach of
institutional regulation. In a residential university, facul
ty members relate professionally to students in many
ways: in offices, at the dinner table, in informal advising
situations, and so on. These relationships certainly do
not resemble contacts between that faculty member and
citizens on a downtown street. We believe that the ,
speech of a faculty member to a campus audience on
campus issues is subject to regulations, though the
standard applied to it will be different from that applied
to a classroom situation. Indeed, the location of the
recommended target may equally serve to define speech
in relation to the institution: a faculty member inciting
an off-campus crowd to occupy a university building
illegally is, in our view, liable to institutional regulation.
We will now consider the specific charges in the light
of these standards.
Much attention has been paid by the parties to
'Constitutional' questions that may apply to the matter
before us. We here respond to that concern by treating
some of the major issues of this kind that have been
raised in argument and briefs by the parties.
"State Action"
Constitutional standards of due process and free
speech restrain the state. At one point in this proceeding
the University administration expressed the view that
disciplinary proceedings at a private institution are not
necessarily subject to Constitutional protections, while
Professor Franklin has responded that Stanford is in
substantial part publicly financed and publicly regulated
and that the Constitution is consequently as fully appli
cable to Stanford as to an agency of the state. The
merits of these two competing views aside, the Board
does not believe that the disagreement between them
focusses upon the important issues.
Tenure proceedings at all universities, private and
public, involve an attempt to abrogate permanence of
employment for cause.
Tenure, accurately and unequivocally defined, lays no
claim wiiatever to a guarantee of lifetime employ
ment. Rather, tenure provides only that no person
continuously retained as a full-time faculty member
beyond a specified lengthy period of probationary
service may thereafter be dismissed without adequate
cause. Moreover, the particular standards of'adequate
cause' to which the tenured faculty is accountable are
themselves wholly within the prerogative of each
university to determine through its own published
rules, save only that those rules not be applied in a
manner which violates the academic freedom or the
ordinary personal civil liberties of the individual. An
institution may provide for dismissal for 'adequate
cause' arising from failure to meet a specified norm of
performance or productivity, as well as from specified
acts of affirmative misconduct.. . .
. . .This accompanying complement of academic due
process merely establishes that a fairly rigorous pro
cedure will be observed whenever formal complaint is
made that dismissal is justified on some stated ground
of professional irresponsibility, to insure the fair
determination of three facts:
1. that the stated cause is the authentic cause for
dismissal, rather than a pretense or makeweight for
considerations invading the academic freedom or
ordinary personal civil liberties of the individual;
2. that the stated cause exists in fact;
3. that the degree of demonstrated professional
irresponsibility warrants outright termination of
the individual's appointment rather than some
lesser sanction, even after taking into account the
balance of his entire service and the personal
consequences of dismissal.
(Van Alstyne, N. Bulletin oj the American Asso
ciation of University Professors. Autumn. 1971)

Given the essentially identical character of the in
quiry in tenure cases, neither the standards of due
process nor the content of regulations covering speech
need differ between private and public institutions of
higher learning. It is open to a private university to
impose Constitutional limitations on itself as a deliberate
choice of policy; in advance of the hearing the Board
committed itself to at least this much in undertaking to
provide for Professor Franklin "no less protection oi his
Constitutional rights at Stanford than that to which he
would be entitled as a member of the faculty of a state
university." In the opinion of the Board the more
significant questions are: What are the Constitutional
boundaries? What should be the university's policies
beyind the minimum standards set by the Constitution?
We emphasize at the outset that we do not regard the
conduct described in the charges filed by the University
administration to be constitutionally protected against
University discipline. On the contrary, we consider such
conduct to be clearly within the reach of institutional
authority. The university charges that the two speeches
involve advocacy that is directed to inciting or producing
imminent lawless action, and likely to produce such
action. The charge on the Computation Center incident
deals with conduct which might unjustifiably increase
the risk of injury to others.
But this is not all that needs to be said about the
matter. Professor Franklin has also characterized as
"vague" and "overbroad" the charges made against him,
and also the standards set out in the Statement of Policy
on Appointment and Tenure ("substantial and manifest
incompetence, substantial and manifest neglect of duty,
or personal conduct substantially impairing the individ
ual's performance of his appropriate function within the
university community"). Prior to the hearing, the Board
rejected Professor Franklin's challenge on the vagueness
and overbreadth of the charges; at the same time, it
reserved its decision regarding the similar claims directed
to the underlying tenure regulations. The Board now
rejects these claims as well, for reasons we discuss below.
Vagueness and Overbreadth: The State Context
The term "overbreadth," as the parties agree, means
that a regulation encompasses both conduct which the
institution can legitimately prohibit, and conduct which
is Constitutionally protected against such prohibition,
'.e., speech of the sort shielded from governmental
estraints by the First Amendment. "Vagueness" is a
lifferent but related defect which leaves the meaning of
he regulation uncertain, in such a way that a member of
„n institution cannot reasonably judge what conduct is
prohibited and what conduct is permitted.
The simplest level at which an argument of over
breadth may be met is to ask whether the conduct for
which an individual is allegedly culpable under some
regulation is Constitutionally protected. If that were
found to be the case, then obviously the Constitution
would not allow the individual to be penalized under the
regulation because, no matter how precisely and clearly
its terms describe the conduct, the prohibition was
illegitimate under Constitutional provisions. Professor
rnnl'Hn mnlfltoinr -it flir* I pta'irrroc aOQinct

him deal with actions that are Constitutionally pro
tected. He goes further, however, to argue that even if
the Constitution would allow his prosecution for that
conduct in which he engaged, and even if that conduct
were clearly covered by the University's tenure regula
tion, that regulation is inapplicable to him simply be
cause of its overbreadth. This conclusion is argued from
the principle that society places a high value on the free
exercise of speech, and that it can tolerate no "chilling
effect" on this freedom. If a regulation covers both
permitted and prohibited conduct, then it may deter
others from exercising First Amendment rights which
fall under the improperly constructed portion of the
regulation's roof. Even a person guilty of legitimately
proscribable conduct may be rewarded for pointing out
the Constitutional infirmity of the regulation under
which he was prosecuted by relieving him of the con
sequences of his guilt. For the vice of overbreadth, the
institution is forced to invalidate the regulation over its
entire range of application, and to substitute for it a
more narrowly drawn regulation which will withstand
Constitutional scrutiny.
The vagueness doctrine, by contrast, is in substantial
part a canon of ordinary fairness. If a jurisdiction has
not identified a particular kind of conduct as subject to
punishment, it should not then be able to punish
perpetrators of such conduct. Vague regulations may
share some of the disadvantages of overbroad regula
tions, because their indefiniteness may overlap Constitu
tionally-guaranteed zones of activity and deter people
from doing what they have the right to do. Where
indefinite regulations are applied to speech, the vague
ness then invades an activity of such high social utility
that it claims special protection in the Constitution.
Again, it may be justifiable to reward persons who, while
knowingly engaging in activity that the institution may
legitimately proscribe, can show that the regulation is
vague at the border between punishable and protected
conduct. Like the transgressor who points out over
breadth, the identifier of vagueness—even though he
might be guilty under a properly drawn regulation
might receive a benefit for helping to thaw improperly
frozen expression.
Vague regulations introduce other difficulties as well
in a state context. The responsibility for drafting of
governing regulations rests with legislators who are ac
countable through political processes; when they enact a
vague statute, they shift responsibility for the law
making function onto the courts, who must take up the
legislator's abandoned obligations and give the statute
meaning in the course of applying it. Such a transfer of
responsibility might unduly disturb the balance of
powers among the branches of government. Further
more, the law enforcement authorities as well as the
courts have received the responsibility transferred by the
vague regulation, and may thereby he afforded unduly
wide discretion in the selection of whom to prosecute.
Obviously, such freedom might be exercised arbitrarily,
or for the purpose of retaliating against Constitutionally
protected activities. Finally, the adjudicating process
itsrlf (!•!• <T>ri v»v wwiie regulations: both the parties
and the decision maker are at a loss as to how to prepare
the case, what evidence to introduce, what arguments to
make, and what standards to use in deciding it.
Vagueness and Overbreadth: The University Context
These reflections on the briefs and arguments of the
parties regarding the doctrines of vagueness and over
breadth spell out certain problems, but hardly take us
directly to a resolution of the present issues. The legal
material pressed on us by the parties deals with problems
of vagueness and overbreadth in contexts which often
depart substantially from that applying in this case. It is
on this ground that we set aside the cases on student
discipline that both parties have reviewed for us in some
detail. Our examination of these cases persuades us that
the law in this field is incompletely settled; a rapid rate
of contemporary change has generated substantial dis
agreement and a conspicuously confused rationale.
There may be a trend toward enhanced protection, and
an employment of concepts of vagueness and over
breadth similar to those urged upon us by Professor
Franklin. But we recognize important differences in the
relationship between the institution and students, on the
one hand, the faculty, on the other. Students are much
more numerous; their time in the institution is shorter;
their fiscal relationaship with it is entirely different; and
a different tradition of academic freedom obtains. These
difficulties emphasize our conclusion that the problems
of vagueness and overbreadth, as well as other aspects of
the case, must be analyzed with due regard for the
framework—and the atmosphere-of the relation be
tween a faculty member and the University.
We may dispense quickly with two of the difficulties
engendered by vagueness. In some other procedural
system, vague regulations may produce problems in the
preparation, hearing and decision of the case, since none
of the participants can find his way in the fog created by
the lack of underlying standards. However, we consider
the charges in this case reasonably narrow and specific.
In our opinion, they are fully adequate to state an
intelligible conception of the case on the part of the
University administration, give Professor Franklin notice
of the conduct with which he is charged and enable him
to prepare and present his defense, and equip the Board
to shape the hearing and focus on commonly understood
issues. Beyond this, the Board afforded each party the
opportunity to obtain pre-hearing disclosure from the
other party of information and contentions relevant to
the case.
We also do not believe that the role of vague statutes
in unbalancing the separation of governmental processes
is one that need concern us in this situation. The faculty
of the university is a small community, characterized by
face-to-face contact and personal interaction. Legislation
proscribing conduct in a disciplinary context is rare;
when it occurs, it merely codifies previously shared
understandings. While there is clearly some allocation of
function as between faculty and administration, with
ultimate authority retained in the Board of Trustees as a
matter of legal right, interchanges and combinations of
roles are heavily involved in the actual governance of the
university. Faculty members relate to the institution
more through practice and informally negotiated con
sensus than through hierarchically codified rule. Rules of
conduct thus trace their source to slowly evolving
tradition rather than to abrupt acts of legislative inter
vention by persons in positions of formal authority.
Lack of centralization—often aided by small size and
extensive interaction—obviate for the university faculty
the need for the kind of detailed directions that guide
the armies of bureaucrats upon which larger organiza
tions often rely for administering centrally-determined
policies.
There remain the problems of fair warning, of over
breadth, and of undue discretion in enforcement.
Against the background of the relationship between
citizen and state, it is easy to make these issues appear
genuine and substantial. Plainly, it would be intolerable
for the state to provide that a citizen could be im
prisoned for "substantial and manifest incompetence,
substantial and manifest neglect of duty, or personal
conduct substantially impairing the individual's perfor
mance of his appropriate functions within the communi
ty." The situation is different, we believe, when the
public to which similar regulations are addressed is the
faculty of the university. In the more restricted setting,
the regulation invokes a web of largely unwritten rules as
tough and living as the British Constitution. Powerful
traditions, modified by contemporary practice, furnish a
reliable guide to faculty conduct, and entrust review
procedures to faculty peers-in this case, to a faculty
hearing board elected by the faculty. Nothing in those
traditions collides with Constitutionally guarded free
doms. On the contrary, it is the University's responsi
bility to enhance the exercise of rights of speech which
the First Amendment merely protects against govern
mental interference.
We would emphasize the meager record of the aca
demic community's experience with faculty discipline.
This may well be because faculty members chose their
profession in part because they embrace traditional
faculty norms, therefore performing willingly what writ
ten rules coerce in other systems. Indeed, the kind of
written rules contained in court decisions and codes are
not merely responses to the need for prior warning.
They are also the result of society's experience in
enforcing pre-existing norms against a partly recalcitrant
population—as suggested by the maxim that "ignorance
of the law is no excuse." The general practice of
conforming to norms may instruct individual faculty
members about those norms just as clearly as would
occasional cases of discipline for breach of standards.
This wide observance of the norms of faculty conduct
cannot disguise the fact of strong disagreement with
them among some faculty; dissent from a rule, or even
from the entire system of rules, obviously exists, and
must exist to furnish the motive power for necessary
change. But disagreement with a rule is not the same as
ignorance of its terms.
It is perhaps true that a fully-developed code would
be a more readily interprctable guide. But we believe
that the institution and its members would pay a heavy
price for such codification in terms of lost faculty
autonomy and initiative, and in over-bureaucratization.
This detriment should be carefully weighed before the
university accepts regulations spelled out in greater
detail. What we have called the web of unwritten rules of
faculty conduct is not clear or easy to apply in all cases;
on the contrary, there are borderline cases, and intracta
ble problems of application. But codified systems of
rules, too, are inevitably characterized by gaps and
conflicts—and suffer from certain pathologies precisely
because they are written. For example, rules designed to
protect speech by limiting other speech are double
edged; in either direction, they cut into regions that lie
under the protection o<*the First Amendment.

On balance, we favor the present reliance on largely
unwritten standards. But whatever the future holds in
this regard, we find the present understandings adequate
ly clear to guide faculty members in choosing among
various courses of action in particular situations.
Statement of Policy on Appointment and Tenure
The duties of a faculty member include, obviously,
specific teaching and scholarly obligations that are un
derstood primarily in terms of arrangements reached
voluntarily between the individual and his department or
some other institutional unit. Such obligations are gen
erally not spelled out in writing, perhaps because pro
fessors object to formal job descriptions. Nonetheless,
failure to meet commitments of this kind would clearly
constitute "substantial and manifest neglect of duty."
Similarly, "performance of his appropriate function in
the University" means the meeting of the full range of
agreed-upon institutional obligations. Professor Franklin,
in his final argument, characterizes the Statement of
Policy on Appointment and Tenure as being worded so
as to protect the performance of these positive obliga
tions—to enable the institution to weed out the demon
strably incompetent. But the unwritten understandings
discussed above give to the terms "duty" and "appro
priate function" a character of limitation as well as of
obligation. The fulfillment of a faculty member's duty
to his students and colleagues is understood to involve
an obligation to refrain from corrupting the intellectual
transactions that are the essence of the university, and
the other activities that support these. This does not, of
course, mean that he must exhibit political conformity
with the objectives of the institution; the university
must accommodate the questioning of contemporary
goals and structures, and must even tolerate the view
that the university, or the professoriate, should not
survive. There is positive benefit in having on the faculty
active representatives of political views that, while they
may be considered extreme or dissenting here, are held
by large numbers of people in the world and comprise a
dominant form of political organization in many places.
It seems likely that students can get a better education
about the nature of these ideas from proponents than
they can obtain through an exposure only to disengaged
analysts. Proponents are often also proselytizers: that
freedom should be granted also so long as its exercise
does not infringe upon the free choice of others. The
code of the institution does, however, demand that the
speech and conduct of a professor stay behind the line
of inciting or physically causing the impairment of the
institution's functions, especially its function as a forum
in which various other points of view can also be heard.
Policy on Campus Disruptions
The Policy on Campus Disruptions (hereafter called
the Policy) first appeared in 1965. It was a first attempt
to provide more detailed codification of conduct that
might be proscribed on the campus. The Policy was
clearly never intended to list all behavior that a faculty
member might engage in that was against university
policy; indeed, its original authors (the no-longer-extant
Committee on University Policy) did not even aim it
explicitly at faculty, so that it later had to be ratified by
the Academic Senate in 1968. That bit of legislative
history is interesting: although there was some debate
about a linked proposal concerning the judicial mechan
ism for dealing with faculty violators, no member of the
Senate offered dissent to a single substantive element of
the Policy. This episode shows, perhaps more clearly
than anything else, that the Policy was widely and
immediately accepted because it articulated some as
sumptions about appropriate conduct that most faculty
members heid in common.
Another way of illustrating this proposition is to
suppose that there were no Policy. Would the University
then be powerless to take action against a faculty
member for any of the acts described therein? In other
words, do we really insist on requiring that every
proscribed action be named in a document before we
place it on the other side of the line? The Board believes
that the answer to each of these questions is "no." We
have concluded above that there are common under
standings of appropriate faculty conduct, and that con
duct therefore exists which, even though it may not be
listed in an official policy, is nevertheless sanctionable.
With this background, we can consider the specific
conduct of the Policy. It lists several general positive
obligations:
a. to maintain "an atmosphere conducive to schol
arly pursuits"
b. "to preserve the dignity and seriousness of
University ceremonies and public exercises"
c. "to respect the rights of individuals"
The Policy also includes several specific areas of pro
scribed conduct:
a. "to prevent or disrupt the effective carrying out
of a University function or approved activity such
as lectures, meetings, [and] public events. ..
b. "to obstruct the legitimate movement of any
person about the campus or in any University
building or facility."
The Board believes that these provisions provide a clear
statement amplifying and defining some of the concepts
expressed more generally in the Statement of Policy on
Appointment and Tenure. Its applicability to faculty
members is beyond doubt.
Protected pi Punishable Speech: The Relation of the
Policy " to Incitement
We now turn to the fact that the Policy does not
specifically prohibit incitement. The failure to deal with
such speech is not, in the Board's view, the result of a
conscious decision to protect all speech. Rather, it is one
aspect of the history of the Policy, which was formu
lated quickly to meet a momentary need for the articula
tion of certain basic, commonly-held views. The Board
does not accept the argument that the Policy's omission
of a discussion of incitement automatically removes it
from prohibition.
In the Board's view, incitement to illegal conduct—as
we shall define it below-is an abuse of power. Such
abuse is a serious matter in a university, especially when
faculty members are addressing students. We see no
excuse for placing certain conduct beyond the law of the
campus, as the Policy does, and then implying blanket
permission for faculty members to incite others to
engage in that same conduct.
Protected vs. Punishable Speech: Standards
We do, however, see every reason for taking care that
the standard for incitement is carefully drawn, with due
cognizance of those First Amendment protections that
apply to the relation between state and citizen. A wide
range of standards has been offered to us. At one
extreme, we were urged by counsel for Professor Frank

lin that no speech should be punished by the university,
regardless of its incitement to illegal acts. At the other,
we might have ruled sanctionable the advocacy of
vaguely-defined violent action proposed for some time in
the indefinite future. In ruling on the White Plaza and
Old Union speeches, we shall meet a standard suggested
by the Supreme Court decision discussed at length by
the parties in this case. The court in Brandenburg vs.
Ohio (395 US 444) held that to be punishable, advocacy
must "be directed to inciting or producing imminent
lawless action, and. . .likely to produce such action." A
vague exhortation is not punishable under such a stand
ard; on the other extreme it is clearly unreasonable to
demand, as did counsel for Professor Franklin, that there
be an exact correspondence between specific acts advo
cated and those that follow. Subsequent illegal acts arc
not in fact required for incitement to be punishable
under this standard. Such acts might, for example, have
been prevented by external circumstances, or illegal acts
might occur but differ from those advocated. Subse
quent acts are useful in determining the level and
character of risk that obtained at the time of the alleged
incitement. In judging the applicability of the standard
cited, the Board has been guided by the following
considerations:
a. What is the entire context surrounding the alleged
incitement, including the immediate risk of lawless
action?
b. What is specifically being communicated to the
audience?
c. What did the speaker intend? We judge intent on
the basis of the speaker's own knowledge of the
context for his speech, his awareness of the level of
the risk, and the words he actually used.
In the application of this standard, punishable advocacy
need not identify particular acts, but it must include
advocacy of lawless conduct. Inclusion of advocacy of
legal acts with advocacy of lawless conduct does not
immunize that advocacy from punishment. In the appli
cation of this standard to the campus, it is clear that
"lawless action" refers to acts against the law of the
campus, that is, to conduct proscribed by the Policy or
University regulations, or clearly prohibited under the
kind of common understanding of conduct discussed
above.
With respect to the Computation Center incident, the
Board has applied a different standard.Professor Frank
lin is charged with intentionally inciting students and
others to disregard and disobey a police order to dis
perse. If, knowing the risk, he increased the risk of
personal injury to other persons, some of whom were
unaware of the risk, then his conduct is punishable.
Incitement need not be directed to increasing the likeli
hood of illegal conduct; it may also be punishable if it
places persons at heightened physical risk, as with the
cry of "fire" in a crowded theatre. Such speech is clearly
not Constitutionally protected.
It may be argued that the university should allow
more scope than the Constitution, or the current de
mands of society, would require; indeed, it has been put
to us that the university should not undertake to restrain
speech at all. We believe the university's prohibition of
incitement, given the criteria of intent, risk and immi
nence discussed above, is fully justified when speech
threatens two central university interests: (1) protection
of members of the university community and university
facilities against risks of serious injury or damage; (2)
protection against coercive intrusion on the intellectual
transactions which the university seeks to foster.

We observe also that in taking this position we have
rejected a formulation urged upon us by a group of
intervening faculty. In their view, dismissal from a
tenured position is warranted only for "failure to per
form the duties for which one was hired-teaching,
and/or research. .or for previous conviction of "some
criminal act." We believe it is inappropriate to tie tenure
proceedings to the criminal process. The standard sug
gested by the interveners would, to be sure, relieve the
Board of the difficult obligation to construct a narrative
of disputed events as a basis for judgment. However
desirable that might be, we find it almost the only virtue
in their position. A criminal proceeding may require
several years to resolve, and it may terminate favorably
to the accused for reasons which have nothing to do
with a faculty member's fitness to retain his position. It
is not obvious why the university should be dependent
on external prosecution policy, which may respond to a
number of factors but which is unlikely to reflect any
sensitive judgment of university interests as a central
concern. It does seem clear that sound decisions, on the
issue ol penalty perhaps even more than on the issue of
culpability, under university standards, will require the
kind ol intimate familiarity with the facts of a case that
can be best provided by professional peers. On this basis,
the mere tact ol conviction of criminal offenses could be
a wholly insufficient guide to wise disposition within the
university.
Relation oj Speech to the Institution
Lastly, we turn to the circumstances under which
speech occurs, and to the relationship between those
circumstances and the 'duty' and 'appropriate function'
ol the speaker. Speech and conduct by faculty members
have in other cases been treated according to different
standards depending upon whether they were judged to
be connected with the faculty member's duties or
unrelated to them.
Professor Franklin has applied the term "extracurri
cular" to his speech at the two rallies. The Board cannot
agree with this use of the term, if by it Professor
Franklin intends to place the speeches in question
outside the framework of his duties and appropriate
function in the university. There is a degree of differ
ence, to be sure, bewteen speech in the classroom and
speech outside it; it may reasonably be held, for exam
ple, that explicit advocacy of a political position un
related to the subject matter of a course is improper
when delivered in front of a class, but is not when
delivered at a rally outside the classroom door. But that
view does not automatically remove all activities that
take place outside the classroom door from the reach of
institutional regulation. In a residential university, facul
ty members relate professionally to students in many
ways: in offices, at the dinner table, in informal advising
situations, and so on. These relationships certainly do
not resemble contacts between that faculty member and
citizens on a downtown street. We believe that the ,
speech of a faculty member to a campus audience on
campus issues is subject to regulations, though the
standard applied to it will be different from that applied
to a classroom situation. Indeed, the location of the
recommended target may equally serve to define speech
in relation to the institution: a faculty member inciting
an off-campus crowd to occupy a university building
illegally is, in our view, liable to institutional regulation.
We will now consider the specific charges in the light
of these standards.
Much attention has been paid by the parties to
'Constitutional' questions that may apply to the matter
before us. We here respond to that concern by treating
some of the major issues of this kind that have been
raised in argument and briefs by the parties.
"State Action"
Constitutional standards of due process and free
speech restrain the state. At one point in this proceeding
the University administration expressed the view that
disciplinary proceedings at a private institution are not
necessarily subject to Constitutional protections, while
Professor Franklin has responded that Stanford is in
substantial part publicly financed and publicly regulated
and that the Constitution is consequently as fully appli
cable to Stanford as to an agency of the state. The
merits of these two competing views aside, the Board
does not believe that the disagreement between them
focusses upon the important issues.
Tenure proceedings at all universities, private and
public, involve an attempt to abrogate permanence of
employment for cause.
Tenure, accurately and unequivocally defined, lays no
claim wiiatever to a guarantee of lifetime employ
ment. Rather, tenure provides only that no person
continuously retained as a full-time faculty member
beyond a specified lengthy period of probationary
service may thereafter be dismissed without adequate
cause. Moreover, the particular standards of'adequate
cause' to which the tenured faculty is accountable are
themselves wholly within the prerogative of each
university to determine through its own published
rules, save only that those rules not be applied in a
manner which violates the academic freedom or the
ordinary personal civil liberties of the individual. An
institution may provide for dismissal for 'adequate
cause' arising from failure to meet a specified norm of
performance or productivity, as well as from specified
acts of affirmative misconduct.. . .
. . .This accompanying complement of academic due
process merely establishes that a fairly rigorous pro
cedure will be observed whenever formal complaint is
made that dismissal is justified on some stated ground
of professional irresponsibility, to insure the fair
determination of three facts:
1. that the stated cause is the authentic cause for
dismissal, rather than a pretense or makeweight for
considerations invading the academic freedom or
ordinary personal civil liberties of the individual;
2. that the stated cause exists in fact;
3. that the degree of demonstrated professional
irresponsibility warrants outright termination of
the individual's appointment rather than some
lesser sanction, even after taking into account the
balance of his entire service and the personal
consequences of dismissal.
(Van Alstyne, N. Bulletin oj the American Asso
ciation of University Professors. Autumn. 1971)

Given the essentially identical character of the in
quiry in tenure cases, neither the standards of due
process nor the content of regulations covering speech
need differ between private and public institutions of
higher learning. It is open to a private university to
impose Constitutional limitations on itself as a deliberate
choice of policy; in advance of the hearing the Board
committed itself to at least this much in undertaking to
provide for Professor Franklin "no less protection oi his
Constitutional rights at Stanford than that to which he
would be entitled as a member of the faculty of a state
university." In the opinion of the Board the more
significant questions are: What are the Constitutional
boundaries? What should be the university's policies
beyind the minimum standards set by the Constitution?
We emphasize at the outset that we do not regard the
conduct described in the charges filed by the University
administration to be constitutionally protected against
University discipline. On the contrary, we consider such
conduct to be clearly within the reach of institutional
authority. The university charges that the two speeches
involve advocacy that is directed to inciting or producing
imminent lawless action, and likely to produce such
action. The charge on the Computation Center incident
deals with conduct which might unjustifiably increase
the risk of injury to others.
But this is not all that needs to be said about the
matter. Professor Franklin has also characterized as
"vague" and "overbroad" the charges made against him,
and also the standards set out in the Statement of Policy
on Appointment and Tenure ("substantial and manifest
incompetence, substantial and manifest neglect of duty,
or personal conduct substantially impairing the individ
ual's performance of his appropriate function within the
university community"). Prior to the hearing, the Board
rejected Professor Franklin's challenge on the vagueness
and overbreadth of the charges; at the same time, it
reserved its decision regarding the similar claims directed
to the underlying tenure regulations. The Board now
rejects these claims as well, for reasons we discuss below.
Vagueness and Overbreadth: The State Context
The term "overbreadth," as the parties agree, means
that a regulation encompasses both conduct which the
institution can legitimately prohibit, and conduct which
is Constitutionally protected against such prohibition,
'.e., speech of the sort shielded from governmental
estraints by the First Amendment. "Vagueness" is a
lifferent but related defect which leaves the meaning of
he regulation uncertain, in such a way that a member of
„n institution cannot reasonably judge what conduct is
prohibited and what conduct is permitted.
The simplest level at which an argument of over
breadth may be met is to ask whether the conduct for
which an individual is allegedly culpable under some
regulation is Constitutionally protected. If that were
found to be the case, then obviously the Constitution
would not allow the individual to be penalized under the
regulation because, no matter how precisely and clearly
its terms describe the conduct, the prohibition was
illegitimate under Constitutional provisions. Professor
rnnl'Hn mnlfltoinr -it flir* I pta'irrroc aOQinct

him deal with actions that are Constitutionally pro
tected. He goes further, however, to argue that even if
the Constitution would allow his prosecution for that
conduct in which he engaged, and even if that conduct
were clearly covered by the University's tenure regula
tion, that regulation is inapplicable to him simply be
cause of its overbreadth. This conclusion is argued from
the principle that society places a high value on the free
exercise of speech, and that it can tolerate no "chilling
effect" on this freedom. If a regulation covers both
permitted and prohibited conduct, then it may deter
others from exercising First Amendment rights which
fall under the improperly constructed portion of the
regulation's roof. Even a person guilty of legitimately
proscribable conduct may be rewarded for pointing out
the Constitutional infirmity of the regulation under
which he was prosecuted by relieving him of the con
sequences of his guilt. For the vice of overbreadth, the
institution is forced to invalidate the regulation over its
entire range of application, and to substitute for it a
more narrowly drawn regulation which will withstand
Constitutional scrutiny.
The vagueness doctrine, by contrast, is in substantial
part a canon of ordinary fairness. If a jurisdiction has
not identified a particular kind of conduct as subject to
punishment, it should not then be able to punish
perpetrators of such conduct. Vague regulations may
share some of the disadvantages of overbroad regula
tions, because their indefiniteness may overlap Constitu
tionally-guaranteed zones of activity and deter people
from doing what they have the right to do. Where
indefinite regulations are applied to speech, the vague
ness then invades an activity of such high social utility
that it claims special protection in the Constitution.
Again, it may be justifiable to reward persons who, while
knowingly engaging in activity that the institution may
legitimately proscribe, can show that the regulation is
vague at the border between punishable and protected
conduct. Like the transgressor who points out over
breadth, the identifier of vagueness—even though he
might be guilty under a properly drawn regulation
might receive a benefit for helping to thaw improperly
frozen expression.
Vague regulations introduce other difficulties as well
in a state context. The responsibility for drafting of
governing regulations rests with legislators who are ac
countable through political processes; when they enact a
vague statute, they shift responsibility for the law
making function onto the courts, who must take up the
legislator's abandoned obligations and give the statute
meaning in the course of applying it. Such a transfer of
responsibility might unduly disturb the balance of
powers among the branches of government. Further
more, the law enforcement authorities as well as the
courts have received the responsibility transferred by the
vague regulation, and may thereby he afforded unduly
wide discretion in the selection of whom to prosecute.
Obviously, such freedom might be exercised arbitrarily,
or for the purpose of retaliating against Constitutionally
protected activities. Finally, the adjudicating process
itsrlf (!•!• <T>ri v»v wwiie regulations: both the parties
and the decision maker are at a loss as to how to prepare
the case, what evidence to introduce, what arguments to
make, and what standards to use in deciding it.
Vagueness and Overbreadth: The University Context
These reflections on the briefs and arguments of the
parties regarding the doctrines of vagueness and over
breadth spell out certain problems, but hardly take us
directly to a resolution of the present issues. The legal
material pressed on us by the parties deals with problems
of vagueness and overbreadth in contexts which often
depart substantially from that applying in this case. It is
on this ground that we set aside the cases on student
discipline that both parties have reviewed for us in some
detail. Our examination of these cases persuades us that
the law in this field is incompletely settled; a rapid rate
of contemporary change has generated substantial dis
agreement and a conspicuously confused rationale.
There may be a trend toward enhanced protection, and
an employment of concepts of vagueness and over
breadth similar to those urged upon us by Professor
Franklin. But we recognize important differences in the
relationship between the institution and students, on the
one hand, the faculty, on the other. Students are much
more numerous; their time in the institution is shorter;
their fiscal relationaship with it is entirely different; and
a different tradition of academic freedom obtains. These
difficulties emphasize our conclusion that the problems
of vagueness and overbreadth, as well as other aspects of
the case, must be analyzed with due regard for the
framework—and the atmosphere-of the relation be
tween a faculty member and the University.
We may dispense quickly with two of the difficulties
engendered by vagueness. In some other procedural
system, vague regulations may produce problems in the
preparation, hearing and decision of the case, since none
of the participants can find his way in the fog created by
the lack of underlying standards. However, we consider
the charges in this case reasonably narrow and specific.
In our opinion, they are fully adequate to state an
intelligible conception of the case on the part of the
University administration, give Professor Franklin notice
of the conduct with which he is charged and enable him
to prepare and present his defense, and equip the Board
to shape the hearing and focus on commonly understood
issues. Beyond this, the Board afforded each party the
opportunity to obtain pre-hearing disclosure from the
other party of information and contentions relevant to
the case.
We also do not believe that the role of vague statutes
in unbalancing the separation of governmental processes
is one that need concern us in this situation. The faculty
of the university is a small community, characterized by
face-to-face contact and personal interaction. Legislation
proscribing conduct in a disciplinary context is rare;
when it occurs, it merely codifies previously shared
understandings. While there is clearly some allocation of
function as between faculty and administration, with
ultimate authority retained in the Board of Trustees as a
matter of legal right, interchanges and combinations of
roles are heavily involved in the actual governance of the
university. Faculty members relate to the institution
more through practice and informally negotiated con
sensus than through hierarchically codified rule. Rules of
conduct thus trace their source to slowly evolving
tradition rather than to abrupt acts of legislative inter
vention by persons in positions of formal authority.
Lack of centralization—often aided by small size and
extensive interaction—obviate for the university faculty
the need for the kind of detailed directions that guide
the armies of bureaucrats upon which larger organiza
tions often rely for administering centrally-determined
policies.
There remain the problems of fair warning, of over
breadth, and of undue discretion in enforcement.
Against the background of the relationship between
citizen and state, it is easy to make these issues appear
genuine and substantial. Plainly, it would be intolerable
for the state to provide that a citizen could be im
prisoned for "substantial and manifest incompetence,
substantial and manifest neglect of duty, or personal
conduct substantially impairing the individual's perfor
mance of his appropriate functions within the communi
ty." The situation is different, we believe, when the
public to which similar regulations are addressed is the
faculty of the university. In the more restricted setting,
the regulation invokes a web of largely unwritten rules as
tough and living as the British Constitution. Powerful
traditions, modified by contemporary practice, furnish a
reliable guide to faculty conduct, and entrust review
procedures to faculty peers-in this case, to a faculty
hearing board elected by the faculty. Nothing in those
traditions collides with Constitutionally guarded free
doms. On the contrary, it is the University's responsi
bility to enhance the exercise of rights of speech which
the First Amendment merely protects against govern
mental interference.
We would emphasize the meager record of the aca
demic community's experience with faculty discipline.
This may well be because faculty members chose their
profession in part because they embrace traditional
faculty norms, therefore performing willingly what writ
ten rules coerce in other systems. Indeed, the kind of
written rules contained in court decisions and codes are
not merely responses to the need for prior warning.
They are also the result of society's experience in
enforcing pre-existing norms against a partly recalcitrant
population—as suggested by the maxim that "ignorance
of the law is no excuse." The general practice of
conforming to norms may instruct individual faculty
members about those norms just as clearly as would
occasional cases of discipline for breach of standards.
This wide observance of the norms of faculty conduct
cannot disguise the fact of strong disagreement with
them among some faculty; dissent from a rule, or even
from the entire system of rules, obviously exists, and
must exist to furnish the motive power for necessary
change. But disagreement with a rule is not the same as
ignorance of its terms.
It is perhaps true that a fully-developed code would
be a more readily interprctable guide. But we believe
that the institution and its members would pay a heavy
price for such codification in terms of lost faculty
autonomy and initiative, and in over-bureaucratization.
This detriment should be carefully weighed before the
university accepts regulations spelled out in greater
detail. What we have called the web of unwritten rules of
faculty conduct is not clear or easy to apply in all cases;
on the contrary, there are borderline cases, and intracta
ble problems of application. But codified systems of
rules, too, are inevitably characterized by gaps and
conflicts—and suffer from certain pathologies precisely
because they are written. For example, rules designed to
protect speech by limiting other speech are double
edged; in either direction, they cut into regions that lie
under the protection o<*the First Amendment.

On balance, we favor the present reliance on largely
unwritten standards. But whatever the future holds in
this regard, we find the present understandings adequate
ly clear to guide faculty members in choosing among
various courses of action in particular situations.
Statement of Policy on Appointment and Tenure
The duties of a faculty member include, obviously,
specific teaching and scholarly obligations that are un
derstood primarily in terms of arrangements reached
voluntarily between the individual and his department or
some other institutional unit. Such obligations are gen
erally not spelled out in writing, perhaps because pro
fessors object to formal job descriptions. Nonetheless,
failure to meet commitments of this kind would clearly
constitute "substantial and manifest neglect of duty."
Similarly, "performance of his appropriate function in
the University" means the meeting of the full range of
agreed-upon institutional obligations. Professor Franklin,
in his final argument, characterizes the Statement of
Policy on Appointment and Tenure as being worded so
as to protect the performance of these positive obliga
tions—to enable the institution to weed out the demon
strably incompetent. But the unwritten understandings
discussed above give to the terms "duty" and "appro
priate function" a character of limitation as well as of
obligation. The fulfillment of a faculty member's duty
to his students and colleagues is understood to involve
an obligation to refrain from corrupting the intellectual
transactions that are the essence of the university, and
the other activities that support these. This does not, of
course, mean that he must exhibit political conformity
with the objectives of the institution; the university
must accommodate the questioning of contemporary
goals and structures, and must even tolerate the view
that the university, or the professoriate, should not
survive. There is positive benefit in having on the faculty
active representatives of political views that, while they
may be considered extreme or dissenting here, are held
by large numbers of people in the world and comprise a
dominant form of political organization in many places.
It seems likely that students can get a better education
about the nature of these ideas from proponents than
they can obtain through an exposure only to disengaged
analysts. Proponents are often also proselytizers: that
freedom should be granted also so long as its exercise
does not infringe upon the free choice of others. The
code of the institution does, however, demand that the
speech and conduct of a professor stay behind the line
of inciting or physically causing the impairment of the
institution's functions, especially its function as a forum
in which various other points of view can also be heard.
Policy on Campus Disruptions
The Policy on Campus Disruptions (hereafter called
the Policy) first appeared in 1965. It was a first attempt
to provide more detailed codification of conduct that
might be proscribed on the campus. The Policy was
clearly never intended to list all behavior that a faculty
member might engage in that was against university
policy; indeed, its original authors (the no-longer-extant
Committee on University Policy) did not even aim it
explicitly at faculty, so that it later had to be ratified by
the Academic Senate in 1968. That bit of legislative
history is interesting: although there was some debate
about a linked proposal concerning the judicial mechan
ism for dealing with faculty violators, no member of the
Senate offered dissent to a single substantive element of
the Policy. This episode shows, perhaps more clearly
than anything else, that the Policy was widely and
immediately accepted because it articulated some as
sumptions about appropriate conduct that most faculty
members heid in common.
Another way of illustrating this proposition is to
suppose that there were no Policy. Would the University
then be powerless to take action against a faculty
member for any of the acts described therein? In other
words, do we really insist on requiring that every
proscribed action be named in a document before we
place it on the other side of the line? The Board believes
that the answer to each of these questions is "no." We
have concluded above that there are common under
standings of appropriate faculty conduct, and that con
duct therefore exists which, even though it may not be
listed in an official policy, is nevertheless sanctionable.
With this background, we can consider the specific
conduct of the Policy. It lists several general positive
obligations:
a. to maintain "an atmosphere conducive to schol
arly pursuits"
b. "to preserve the dignity and seriousness of
University ceremonies and public exercises"
c. "to respect the rights of individuals"
The Policy also includes several specific areas of pro
scribed conduct:
a. "to prevent or disrupt the effective carrying out
of a University function or approved activity such
as lectures, meetings, [and] public events. ..
b. "to obstruct the legitimate movement of any
person about the campus or in any University
building or facility."
The Board believes that these provisions provide a clear
statement amplifying and defining some of the concepts
expressed more generally in the Statement of Policy on
Appointment and Tenure. Its applicability to faculty
members is beyond doubt.
Protected pi Punishable Speech: The Relation of the
Policy " to Incitement
We now turn to the fact that the Policy does not
specifically prohibit incitement. The failure to deal with
such speech is not, in the Board's view, the result of a
conscious decision to protect all speech. Rather, it is one
aspect of the history of the Policy, which was formu
lated quickly to meet a momentary need for the articula
tion of certain basic, commonly-held views. The Board
does not accept the argument that the Policy's omission
of a discussion of incitement automatically removes it
from prohibition.
In the Board's view, incitement to illegal conduct—as
we shall define it below-is an abuse of power. Such
abuse is a serious matter in a university, especially when
faculty members are addressing students. We see no
excuse for placing certain conduct beyond the law of the
campus, as the Policy does, and then implying blanket
permission for faculty members to incite others to
engage in that same conduct.
Protected vs. Punishable Speech: Standards
We do, however, see every reason for taking care that
the standard for incitement is carefully drawn, with due
cognizance of those First Amendment protections that
apply to the relation between state and citizen. A wide
range of standards has been offered to us. At one
extreme, we were urged by counsel for Professor Frank

lin that no speech should be punished by the university,
regardless of its incitement to illegal acts. At the other,
we might have ruled sanctionable the advocacy of
vaguely-defined violent action proposed for some time in
the indefinite future. In ruling on the White Plaza and
Old Union speeches, we shall meet a standard suggested
by the Supreme Court decision discussed at length by
the parties in this case. The court in Brandenburg vs.
Ohio (395 US 444) held that to be punishable, advocacy
must "be directed to inciting or producing imminent
lawless action, and. . .likely to produce such action." A
vague exhortation is not punishable under such a stand
ard; on the other extreme it is clearly unreasonable to
demand, as did counsel for Professor Franklin, that there
be an exact correspondence between specific acts advo
cated and those that follow. Subsequent illegal acts arc
not in fact required for incitement to be punishable
under this standard. Such acts might, for example, have
been prevented by external circumstances, or illegal acts
might occur but differ from those advocated. Subse
quent acts are useful in determining the level and
character of risk that obtained at the time of the alleged
incitement. In judging the applicability of the standard
cited, the Board has been guided by the following
considerations:
a. What is the entire context surrounding the alleged
incitement, including the immediate risk of lawless
action?
b. What is specifically being communicated to the
audience?
c. What did the speaker intend? We judge intent on
the basis of the speaker's own knowledge of the
context for his speech, his awareness of the level of
the risk, and the words he actually used.
In the application of this standard, punishable advocacy
need not identify particular acts, but it must include
advocacy of lawless conduct. Inclusion of advocacy of
legal acts with advocacy of lawless conduct does not
immunize that advocacy from punishment. In the appli
cation of this standard to the campus, it is clear that
"lawless action" refers to acts against the law of the
campus, that is, to conduct proscribed by the Policy or
University regulations, or clearly prohibited under the
kind of common understanding of conduct discussed
above.
With respect to the Computation Center incident, the
Board has applied a different standard.Professor Frank
lin is charged with intentionally inciting students and
others to disregard and disobey a police order to dis
perse. If, knowing the risk, he increased the risk of
personal injury to other persons, some of whom were
unaware of the risk, then his conduct is punishable.
Incitement need not be directed to increasing the likeli
hood of illegal conduct; it may also be punishable if it
places persons at heightened physical risk, as with the
cry of "fire" in a crowded theatre. Such speech is clearly
not Constitutionally protected.
It may be argued that the university should allow
more scope than the Constitution, or the current de
mands of society, would require; indeed, it has been put
to us that the university should not undertake to restrain
speech at all. We believe the university's prohibition of
incitement, given the criteria of intent, risk and immi
nence discussed above, is fully justified when speech
threatens two central university interests: (1) protection
of members of the university community and university
facilities against risks of serious injury or damage; (2)
protection against coercive intrusion on the intellectual
transactions which the university seeks to foster.

We observe also that in taking this position we have
rejected a formulation urged upon us by a group of
intervening faculty. In their view, dismissal from a
tenured position is warranted only for "failure to per
form the duties for which one was hired-teaching,
and/or research. .or for previous conviction of "some
criminal act." We believe it is inappropriate to tie tenure
proceedings to the criminal process. The standard sug
gested by the interveners would, to be sure, relieve the
Board of the difficult obligation to construct a narrative
of disputed events as a basis for judgment. However
desirable that might be, we find it almost the only virtue
in their position. A criminal proceeding may require
several years to resolve, and it may terminate favorably
to the accused for reasons which have nothing to do
with a faculty member's fitness to retain his position. It
is not obvious why the university should be dependent
on external prosecution policy, which may respond to a
number of factors but which is unlikely to reflect any
sensitive judgment of university interests as a central
concern. It does seem clear that sound decisions, on the
issue ol penalty perhaps even more than on the issue of
culpability, under university standards, will require the
kind ol intimate familiarity with the facts of a case that
can be best provided by professional peers. On this basis,
the mere tact ol conviction of criminal offenses could be
a wholly insufficient guide to wise disposition within the
university.
Relation oj Speech to the Institution
Lastly, we turn to the circumstances under which
speech occurs, and to the relationship between those
circumstances and the 'duty' and 'appropriate function'
ol the speaker. Speech and conduct by faculty members
have in other cases been treated according to different
standards depending upon whether they were judged to
be connected with the faculty member's duties or
unrelated to them.
Professor Franklin has applied the term "extracurri
cular" to his speech at the two rallies. The Board cannot
agree with this use of the term, if by it Professor
Franklin intends to place the speeches in question
outside the framework of his duties and appropriate
function in the university. There is a degree of differ
ence, to be sure, bewteen speech in the classroom and
speech outside it; it may reasonably be held, for exam
ple, that explicit advocacy of a political position un
related to the subject matter of a course is improper
when delivered in front of a class, but is not when
delivered at a rally outside the classroom door. But that
view does not automatically remove all activities that
take place outside the classroom door from the reach of
institutional regulation. In a residential university, facul
ty members relate professionally to students in many
ways: in offices, at the dinner table, in informal advising
situations, and so on. These relationships certainly do
not resemble contacts between that faculty member and
citizens on a downtown street. We believe that the ,
speech of a faculty member to a campus audience on
campus issues is subject to regulations, though the
standard applied to it will be different from that applied
to a classroom situation. Indeed, the location of the
recommended target may equally serve to define speech
in relation to the institution: a faculty member inciting
an off-campus crowd to occupy a university building
illegally is, in our view, liable to institutional regulation.
We will now consider the specific charges in the light
of these standards.
Much attention has been paid by the parties to
'Constitutional' questions that may apply to the matter
before us. We here respond to that concern by treating
some of the major issues of this kind that have been
raised in argument and briefs by the parties.
"State Action"
Constitutional standards of due process and free
speech restrain the state. At one point in this proceeding
the University administration expressed the view that
disciplinary proceedings at a private institution are not
necessarily subject to Constitutional protections, while
Professor Franklin has responded that Stanford is in
substantial part publicly financed and publicly regulated
and that the Constitution is consequently as fully appli
cable to Stanford as to an agency of the state. The
merits of these two competing views aside, the Board
does not believe that the disagreement between them
focusses upon the important issues.
Tenure proceedings at all universities, private and
public, involve an attempt to abrogate permanence of
employment for cause.
Tenure, accurately and unequivocally defined, lays no
claim wiiatever to a guarantee of lifetime employ
ment. Rather, tenure provides only that no person
continuously retained as a full-time faculty member
beyond a specified lengthy period of probationary
service may thereafter be dismissed without adequate
cause. Moreover, the particular standards of'adequate
cause' to which the tenured faculty is accountable are
themselves wholly within the prerogative of each
university to determine through its own published
rules, save only that those rules not be applied in a
manner which violates the academic freedom or the
ordinary personal civil liberties of the individual. An
institution may provide for dismissal for 'adequate
cause' arising from failure to meet a specified norm of
performance or productivity, as well as from specified
acts of affirmative misconduct.. . .
. . .This accompanying complement of academic due
process merely establishes that a fairly rigorous pro
cedure will be observed whenever formal complaint is
made that dismissal is justified on some stated ground
of professional irresponsibility, to insure the fair
determination of three facts:
1. that the stated cause is the authentic cause for
dismissal, rather than a pretense or makeweight for
considerations invading the academic freedom or
ordinary personal civil liberties of the individual;
2. that the stated cause exists in fact;
3. that the degree of demonstrated professional
irresponsibility warrants outright termination of
the individual's appointment rather than some
lesser sanction, even after taking into account the
balance of his entire service and the personal
consequences of dismissal.
(Van Alstyne, N. Bulletin oj the American Asso
ciation of University Professors. Autumn. 1971)

Given the essentially identical character of the in
quiry in tenure cases, neither the standards of due
process nor the content of regulations covering speech
need differ between private and public institutions of
higher learning. It is open to a private university to
impose Constitutional limitations on itself as a deliberate
choice of policy; in advance of the hearing the Board
committed itself to at least this much in undertaking to
provide for Professor Franklin "no less protection oi his
Constitutional rights at Stanford than that to which he
would be entitled as a member of the faculty of a state
university." In the opinion of the Board the more
significant questions are: What are the Constitutional
boundaries? What should be the university's policies
beyind the minimum standards set by the Constitution?
We emphasize at the outset that we do not regard the
conduct described in the charges filed by the University
administration to be constitutionally protected against
University discipline. On the contrary, we consider such
conduct to be clearly within the reach of institutional
authority. The university charges that the two speeches
involve advocacy that is directed to inciting or producing
imminent lawless action, and likely to produce such
action. The charge on the Computation Center incident
deals with conduct which might unjustifiably increase
the risk of injury to others.
But this is not all that needs to be said about the
matter. Professor Franklin has also characterized as
"vague" and "overbroad" the charges made against him,
and also the standards set out in the Statement of Policy
on Appointment and Tenure ("substantial and manifest
incompetence, substantial and manifest neglect of duty,
or personal conduct substantially impairing the individ
ual's performance of his appropriate function within the
university community"). Prior to the hearing, the Board
rejected Professor Franklin's challenge on the vagueness
and overbreadth of the charges; at the same time, it
reserved its decision regarding the similar claims directed
to the underlying tenure regulations. The Board now
rejects these claims as well, for reasons we discuss below.
Vagueness and Overbreadth: The State Context
The term "overbreadth," as the parties agree, means
that a regulation encompasses both conduct which the
institution can legitimately prohibit, and conduct which
is Constitutionally protected against such prohibition,
'.e., speech of the sort shielded from governmental
estraints by the First Amendment. "Vagueness" is a
lifferent but related defect which leaves the meaning of
he regulation uncertain, in such a way that a member of
„n institution cannot reasonably judge what conduct is
prohibited and what conduct is permitted.
The simplest level at which an argument of over
breadth may be met is to ask whether the conduct for
which an individual is allegedly culpable under some
regulation is Constitutionally protected. If that were
found to be the case, then obviously the Constitution
would not allow the individual to be penalized under the
regulation because, no matter how precisely and clearly
its terms describe the conduct, the prohibition was
illegitimate under Constitutional provisions. Professor
rnnl'Hn mnlfltoinr -it flir* I pta'irrroc aOQinct

him deal with actions that are Constitutionally pro
tected. He goes further, however, to argue that even if
the Constitution would allow his prosecution for that
conduct in which he engaged, and even if that conduct
were clearly covered by the University's tenure regula
tion, that regulation is inapplicable to him simply be
cause of its overbreadth. This conclusion is argued from
the principle that society places a high value on the free
exercise of speech, and that it can tolerate no "chilling
effect" on this freedom. If a regulation covers both
permitted and prohibited conduct, then it may deter
others from exercising First Amendment rights which
fall under the improperly constructed portion of the
regulation's roof. Even a person guilty of legitimately
proscribable conduct may be rewarded for pointing out
the Constitutional infirmity of the regulation under
which he was prosecuted by relieving him of the con
sequences of his guilt. For the vice of overbreadth, the
institution is forced to invalidate the regulation over its
entire range of application, and to substitute for it a
more narrowly drawn regulation which will withstand
Constitutional scrutiny.
The vagueness doctrine, by contrast, is in substantial
part a canon of ordinary fairness. If a jurisdiction has
not identified a particular kind of conduct as subject to
punishment, it should not then be able to punish
perpetrators of such conduct. Vague regulations may
share some of the disadvantages of overbroad regula
tions, because their indefiniteness may overlap Constitu
tionally-guaranteed zones of activity and deter people
from doing what they have the right to do. Where
indefinite regulations are applied to speech, the vague
ness then invades an activity of such high social utility
that it claims special protection in the Constitution.
Again, it may be justifiable to reward persons who, while
knowingly engaging in activity that the institution may
legitimately proscribe, can show that the regulation is
vague at the border between punishable and protected
conduct. Like the transgressor who points out over
breadth, the identifier of vagueness—even though he
might be guilty under a properly drawn regulation
might receive a benefit for helping to thaw improperly
frozen expression.
Vague regulations introduce other difficulties as well
in a state context. The responsibility for drafting of
governing regulations rests with legislators who are ac
countable through political processes; when they enact a
vague statute, they shift responsibility for the law
making function onto the courts, who must take up the
legislator's abandoned obligations and give the statute
meaning in the course of applying it. Such a transfer of
responsibility might unduly disturb the balance of
powers among the branches of government. Further
more, the law enforcement authorities as well as the
courts have received the responsibility transferred by the
vague regulation, and may thereby he afforded unduly
wide discretion in the selection of whom to prosecute.
Obviously, such freedom might be exercised arbitrarily,
or for the purpose of retaliating against Constitutionally
protected activities. Finally, the adjudicating process
itsrlf (!•!• <T>ri v»v wwiie regulations: both the parties
and the decision maker are at a loss as to how to prepare
the case, what evidence to introduce, what arguments to
make, and what standards to use in deciding it.
Vagueness and Overbreadth: The University Context
These reflections on the briefs and arguments of the
parties regarding the doctrines of vagueness and over
breadth spell out certain problems, but hardly take us
directly to a resolution of the present issues. The legal
material pressed on us by the parties deals with problems
of vagueness and overbreadth in contexts which often
depart substantially from that applying in this case. It is
on this ground that we set aside the cases on student
discipline that both parties have reviewed for us in some
detail. Our examination of these cases persuades us that
the law in this field is incompletely settled; a rapid rate
of contemporary change has generated substantial dis
agreement and a conspicuously confused rationale.
There may be a trend toward enhanced protection, and
an employment of concepts of vagueness and over
breadth similar to those urged upon us by Professor
Franklin. But we recognize important differences in the
relationship between the institution and students, on the
one hand, the faculty, on the other. Students are much
more numerous; their time in the institution is shorter;
their fiscal relationaship with it is entirely different; and
a different tradition of academic freedom obtains. These
difficulties emphasize our conclusion that the problems
of vagueness and overbreadth, as well as other aspects of
the case, must be analyzed with due regard for the
framework—and the atmosphere-of the relation be
tween a faculty member and the University.
We may dispense quickly with two of the difficulties
engendered by vagueness. In some other procedural
system, vague regulations may produce problems in the
preparation, hearing and decision of the case, since none
of the participants can find his way in the fog created by
the lack of underlying standards. However, we consider
the charges in this case reasonably narrow and specific.
In our opinion, they are fully adequate to state an
intelligible conception of the case on the part of the
University administration, give Professor Franklin notice
of the conduct with which he is charged and enable him
to prepare and present his defense, and equip the Board
to shape the hearing and focus on commonly understood
issues. Beyond this, the Board afforded each party the
opportunity to obtain pre-hearing disclosure from the
other party of information and contentions relevant to
the case.
We also do not believe that the role of vague statutes
in unbalancing the separation of governmental processes
is one that need concern us in this situation. The faculty
of the university is a small community, characterized by
face-to-face contact and personal interaction. Legislation
proscribing conduct in a disciplinary context is rare;
when it occurs, it merely codifies previously shared
understandings. While there is clearly some allocation of
function as between faculty and administration, with
ultimate authority retained in the Board of Trustees as a
matter of legal right, interchanges and combinations of
roles are heavily involved in the actual governance of the
university. Faculty members relate to the institution
more through practice and informally negotiated con
sensus than through hierarchically codified rule. Rules of
conduct thus trace their source to slowly evolving
tradition rather than to abrupt acts of legislative inter
vention by persons in positions of formal authority.
Lack of centralization—often aided by small size and
extensive interaction—obviate for the university faculty
the need for the kind of detailed directions that guide
the armies of bureaucrats upon which larger organiza
tions often rely for administering centrally-determined
policies.
There remain the problems of fair warning, of over
breadth, and of undue discretion in enforcement.
Against the background of the relationship between
citizen and state, it is easy to make these issues appear
genuine and substantial. Plainly, it would be intolerable
for the state to provide that a citizen could be im
prisoned for "substantial and manifest incompetence,
substantial and manifest neglect of duty, or personal
conduct substantially impairing the individual's perfor
mance of his appropriate functions within the communi
ty." The situation is different, we believe, when the
public to which similar regulations are addressed is the
faculty of the university. In the more restricted setting,
the regulation invokes a web of largely unwritten rules as
tough and living as the British Constitution. Powerful
traditions, modified by contemporary practice, furnish a
reliable guide to faculty conduct, and entrust review
procedures to faculty peers-in this case, to a faculty
hearing board elected by the faculty. Nothing in those
traditions collides with Constitutionally guarded free
doms. On the contrary, it is the University's responsi
bility to enhance the exercise of rights of speech which
the First Amendment merely protects against govern
mental interference.
We would emphasize the meager record of the aca
demic community's experience with faculty discipline.
This may well be because faculty members chose their
profession in part because they embrace traditional
faculty norms, therefore performing willingly what writ
ten rules coerce in other systems. Indeed, the kind of
written rules contained in court decisions and codes are
not merely responses to the need for prior warning.
They are also the result of society's experience in
enforcing pre-existing norms against a partly recalcitrant
population—as suggested by the maxim that "ignorance
of the law is no excuse." The general practice of
conforming to norms may instruct individual faculty
members about those norms just as clearly as would
occasional cases of discipline for breach of standards.
This wide observance of the norms of faculty conduct
cannot disguise the fact of strong disagreement with
them among some faculty; dissent from a rule, or even
from the entire system of rules, obviously exists, and
must exist to furnish the motive power for necessary
change. But disagreement with a rule is not the same as
ignorance of its terms.
It is perhaps true that a fully-developed code would
be a more readily interprctable guide. But we believe
that the institution and its members would pay a heavy
price for such codification in terms of lost faculty
autonomy and initiative, and in over-bureaucratization.
This detriment should be carefully weighed before the
university accepts regulations spelled out in greater
detail. What we have called the web of unwritten rules of
faculty conduct is not clear or easy to apply in all cases;
on the contrary, there are borderline cases, and intracta
ble problems of application. But codified systems of
rules, too, are inevitably characterized by gaps and
conflicts—and suffer from certain pathologies precisely
because they are written. For example, rules designed to
protect speech by limiting other speech are double
edged; in either direction, they cut into regions that lie
under the protection o<*the First Amendment.

On balance, we favor the present reliance on largely
unwritten standards. But whatever the future holds in
this regard, we find the present understandings adequate
ly clear to guide faculty members in choosing among
various courses of action in particular situations.
Statement of Policy on Appointment and Tenure
The duties of a faculty member include, obviously,
specific teaching and scholarly obligations that are un
derstood primarily in terms of arrangements reached
voluntarily between the individual and his department or
some other institutional unit. Such obligations are gen
erally not spelled out in writing, perhaps because pro
fessors object to formal job descriptions. Nonetheless,
failure to meet commitments of this kind would clearly
constitute "substantial and manifest neglect of duty."
Similarly, "performance of his appropriate function in
the University" means the meeting of the full range of
agreed-upon institutional obligations. Professor Franklin,
in his final argument, characterizes the Statement of
Policy on Appointment and Tenure as being worded so
as to protect the performance of these positive obliga
tions—to enable the institution to weed out the demon
strably incompetent. But the unwritten understandings
discussed above give to the terms "duty" and "appro
priate function" a character of limitation as well as of
obligation. The fulfillment of a faculty member's duty
to his students and colleagues is understood to involve
an obligation to refrain from corrupting the intellectual
transactions that are the essence of the university, and
the other activities that support these. This does not, of
course, mean that he must exhibit political conformity
with the objectives of the institution; the university
must accommodate the questioning of contemporary
goals and structures, and must even tolerate the view
that the university, or the professoriate, should not
survive. There is positive benefit in having on the faculty
active representatives of political views that, while they
may be considered extreme or dissenting here, are held
by large numbers of people in the world and comprise a
dominant form of political organization in many places.
It seems likely that students can get a better education
about the nature of these ideas from proponents than
they can obtain through an exposure only to disengaged
analysts. Proponents are often also proselytizers: that
freedom should be granted also so long as its exercise
does not infringe upon the free choice of others. The
code of the institution does, however, demand that the
speech and conduct of a professor stay behind the line
of inciting or physically causing the impairment of the
institution's functions, especially its function as a forum
in which various other points of view can also be heard.
Policy on Campus Disruptions
The Policy on Campus Disruptions (hereafter called
the Policy) first appeared in 1965. It was a first attempt
to provide more detailed codification of conduct that
might be proscribed on the campus. The Policy was
clearly never intended to list all behavior that a faculty
member might engage in that was against university
policy; indeed, its original authors (the no-longer-extant
Committee on University Policy) did not even aim it
explicitly at faculty, so that it later had to be ratified by
the Academic Senate in 1968. That bit of legislative
history is interesting: although there was some debate
about a linked proposal concerning the judicial mechan
ism for dealing with faculty violators, no member of the
Senate offered dissent to a single substantive element of
the Policy. This episode shows, perhaps more clearly
than anything else, that the Policy was widely and
immediately accepted because it articulated some as
sumptions about appropriate conduct that most faculty
members heid in common.
Another way of illustrating this proposition is to
suppose that there were no Policy. Would the University
then be powerless to take action against a faculty
member for any of the acts described therein? In other
words, do we really insist on requiring that every
proscribed action be named in a document before we
place it on the other side of the line? The Board believes
that the answer to each of these questions is "no." We
have concluded above that there are common under
standings of appropriate faculty conduct, and that con
duct therefore exists which, even though it may not be
listed in an official policy, is nevertheless sanctionable.
With this background, we can consider the specific
conduct of the Policy. It lists several general positive
obligations:
a. to maintain "an atmosphere conducive to schol
arly pursuits"
b. "to preserve the dignity and seriousness of
University ceremonies and public exercises"
c. "to respect the rights of individuals"
The Policy also includes several specific areas of pro
scribed conduct:
a. "to prevent or disrupt the effective carrying out
of a University function or approved activity such
as lectures, meetings, [and] public events. ..
b. "to obstruct the legitimate movement of any
person about the campus or in any University
building or facility."
The Board believes that these provisions provide a clear
statement amplifying and defining some of the concepts
expressed more generally in the Statement of Policy on
Appointment and Tenure. Its applicability to faculty
members is beyond doubt.
Protected pi Punishable Speech: The Relation of the
Policy " to Incitement
We now turn to the fact that the Policy does not
specifically prohibit incitement. The failure to deal with
such speech is not, in the Board's view, the result of a
conscious decision to protect all speech. Rather, it is one
aspect of the history of the Policy, which was formu
lated quickly to meet a momentary need for the articula
tion of certain basic, commonly-held views. The Board
does not accept the argument that the Policy's omission
of a discussion of incitement automatically removes it
from prohibition.
In the Board's view, incitement to illegal conduct—as
we shall define it below-is an abuse of power. Such
abuse is a serious matter in a university, especially when
faculty members are addressing students. We see no
excuse for placing certain conduct beyond the law of the
campus, as the Policy does, and then implying blanket
permission for faculty members to incite others to
engage in that same conduct.
Protected vs. Punishable Speech: Standards
We do, however, see every reason for taking care that
the standard for incitement is carefully drawn, with due
cognizance of those First Amendment protections that
apply to the relation between state and citizen. A wide
range of standards has been offered to us. At one
extreme, we were urged by counsel for Professor Frank

lin that no speech should be punished by the university,
regardless of its incitement to illegal acts. At the other,
we might have ruled sanctionable the advocacy of
vaguely-defined violent action proposed for some time in
the indefinite future. In ruling on the White Plaza and
Old Union speeches, we shall meet a standard suggested
by the Supreme Court decision discussed at length by
the parties in this case. The court in Brandenburg vs.
Ohio (395 US 444) held that to be punishable, advocacy
must "be directed to inciting or producing imminent
lawless action, and. . .likely to produce such action." A
vague exhortation is not punishable under such a stand
ard; on the other extreme it is clearly unreasonable to
demand, as did counsel for Professor Franklin, that there
be an exact correspondence between specific acts advo
cated and those that follow. Subsequent illegal acts arc
not in fact required for incitement to be punishable
under this standard. Such acts might, for example, have
been prevented by external circumstances, or illegal acts
might occur but differ from those advocated. Subse
quent acts are useful in determining the level and
character of risk that obtained at the time of the alleged
incitement. In judging the applicability of the standard
cited, the Board has been guided by the following
considerations:
a. What is the entire context surrounding the alleged
incitement, including the immediate risk of lawless
action?
b. What is specifically being communicated to the
audience?
c. What did the speaker intend? We judge intent on
the basis of the speaker's own knowledge of the
context for his speech, his awareness of the level of
the risk, and the words he actually used.
In the application of this standard, punishable advocacy
need not identify particular acts, but it must include
advocacy of lawless conduct. Inclusion of advocacy of
legal acts with advocacy of lawless conduct does not
immunize that advocacy from punishment. In the appli
cation of this standard to the campus, it is clear that
"lawless action" refers to acts against the law of the
campus, that is, to conduct proscribed by the Policy or
University regulations, or clearly prohibited under the
kind of common understanding of conduct discussed
above.
With respect to the Computation Center incident, the
Board has applied a different standard.Professor Frank
lin is charged with intentionally inciting students and
others to disregard and disobey a police order to dis
perse. If, knowing the risk, he increased the risk of
personal injury to other persons, some of whom were
unaware of the risk, then his conduct is punishable.
Incitement need not be directed to increasing the likeli
hood of illegal conduct; it may also be punishable if it
places persons at heightened physical risk, as with the
cry of "fire" in a crowded theatre. Such speech is clearly
not Constitutionally protected.
It may be argued that the university should allow
more scope than the Constitution, or the current de
mands of society, would require; indeed, it has been put
to us that the university should not undertake to restrain
speech at all. We believe the university's prohibition of
incitement, given the criteria of intent, risk and immi
nence discussed above, is fully justified when speech
threatens two central university interests: (1) protection
of members of the university community and university
facilities against risks of serious injury or damage; (2)
protection against coercive intrusion on the intellectual
transactions which the university seeks to foster.

We observe also that in taking this position we have
rejected a formulation urged upon us by a group of
intervening faculty. In their view, dismissal from a
tenured position is warranted only for "failure to per
form the duties for which one was hired-teaching,
and/or research. .or for previous conviction of "some
criminal act." We believe it is inappropriate to tie tenure
proceedings to the criminal process. The standard sug
gested by the interveners would, to be sure, relieve the
Board of the difficult obligation to construct a narrative
of disputed events as a basis for judgment. However
desirable that might be, we find it almost the only virtue
in their position. A criminal proceeding may require
several years to resolve, and it may terminate favorably
to the accused for reasons which have nothing to do
with a faculty member's fitness to retain his position. It
is not obvious why the university should be dependent
on external prosecution policy, which may respond to a
number of factors but which is unlikely to reflect any
sensitive judgment of university interests as a central
concern. It does seem clear that sound decisions, on the
issue ol penalty perhaps even more than on the issue of
culpability, under university standards, will require the
kind ol intimate familiarity with the facts of a case that
can be best provided by professional peers. On this basis,
the mere tact ol conviction of criminal offenses could be
a wholly insufficient guide to wise disposition within the
university.
Relation oj Speech to the Institution
Lastly, we turn to the circumstances under which
speech occurs, and to the relationship between those
circumstances and the 'duty' and 'appropriate function'
ol the speaker. Speech and conduct by faculty members
have in other cases been treated according to different
standards depending upon whether they were judged to
be connected with the faculty member's duties or
unrelated to them.
Professor Franklin has applied the term "extracurri
cular" to his speech at the two rallies. The Board cannot
agree with this use of the term, if by it Professor
Franklin intends to place the speeches in question
outside the framework of his duties and appropriate
function in the university. There is a degree of differ
ence, to be sure, bewteen speech in the classroom and
speech outside it; it may reasonably be held, for exam
ple, that explicit advocacy of a political position un
related to the subject matter of a course is improper
when delivered in front of a class, but is not when
delivered at a rally outside the classroom door. But that
view does not automatically remove all activities that
take place outside the classroom door from the reach of
institutional regulation. In a residential university, facul
ty members relate professionally to students in many
ways: in offices, at the dinner table, in informal advising
situations, and so on. These relationships certainly do
not resemble contacts between that faculty member and
citizens on a downtown street. We believe that the ,
speech of a faculty member to a campus audience on
campus issues is subject to regulations, though the
standard applied to it will be different from that applied
to a classroom situation. Indeed, the location of the
recommended target may equally serve to define speech
in relation to the institution: a faculty member inciting
an off-campus crowd to occupy a university building
illegally is, in our view, liable to institutional regulation.
We will now consider the specific charges in the light
of these standards.
Much attention has been paid by the parties to
'Constitutional' questions that may apply to the matter
before us. We here respond to that concern by treating
some of the major issues of this kind that have been
raised in argument and briefs by the parties.
"State Action"
Constitutional standards of due process and free
speech restrain the state. At one point in this proceeding
the University administration expressed the view that
disciplinary proceedings at a private institution are not
necessarily subject to Constitutional protections, while
Professor Franklin has responded that Stanford is in
substantial part publicly financed and publicly regulated
and that the Constitution is consequently as fully appli
cable to Stanford as to an agency of the state. The
merits of these two competing views aside, the Board
does not believe that the disagreement between them
focusses upon the important issues.
Tenure proceedings at all universities, private and
public, involve an attempt to abrogate permanence of
employment for cause.
Tenure, accurately and unequivocally defined, lays no
claim wiiatever to a guarantee of lifetime employ
ment. Rather, tenure provides only that no person
continuously retained as a full-time faculty member
beyond a specified lengthy period of probationary
service may thereafter be dismissed without adequate
cause. Moreover, the particular standards of'adequate
cause' to which the tenured faculty is accountable are
themselves wholly within the prerogative of each
university to determine through its own published
rules, save only that those rules not be applied in a
manner which violates the academic freedom or the
ordinary personal civil liberties of the individual. An
institution may provide for dismissal for 'adequate
cause' arising from failure to meet a specified norm of
performance or productivity, as well as from specified
acts of affirmative misconduct.. . .
. . .This accompanying complement of academic due
process merely establishes that a fairly rigorous pro
cedure will be observed whenever formal complaint is
made that dismissal is justified on some stated ground
of professional irresponsibility, to insure the fair
determination of three facts:
1. that the stated cause is the authentic cause for
dismissal, rather than a pretense or makeweight for
considerations invading the academic freedom or
ordinary personal civil liberties of the individual;
2. that the stated cause exists in fact;
3. that the degree of demonstrated professional
irresponsibility warrants outright termination of
the individual's appointment rather than some
lesser sanction, even after taking into account the
balance of his entire service and the personal
consequences of dismissal.
(Van Alstyne, N. Bulletin oj the American Asso
ciation of University Professors. Autumn. 1971)

Given the essentially identical character of the in
quiry in tenure cases, neither the standards of due
process nor the content of regulations covering speech
need differ between private and public institutions of
higher learning. It is open to a private university to
impose Constitutional limitations on itself as a deliberate
choice of policy; in advance of the hearing the Board
committed itself to at least this much in undertaking to
provide for Professor Franklin "no less protection oi his
Constitutional rights at Stanford than that to which he
would be entitled as a member of the faculty of a state
university." In the opinion of the Board the more
significant questions are: What are the Constitutional
boundaries? What should be the university's policies
beyind the minimum standards set by the Constitution?
We emphasize at the outset that we do not regard the
conduct described in the charges filed by the University
administration to be constitutionally protected against
University discipline. On the contrary, we consider such
conduct to be clearly within the reach of institutional
authority. The university charges that the two speeches
involve advocacy that is directed to inciting or producing
imminent lawless action, and likely to produce such
action. The charge on the Computation Center incident
deals with conduct which might unjustifiably increase
the risk of injury to others.
But this is not all that needs to be said about the
matter. Professor Franklin has also characterized as
"vague" and "overbroad" the charges made against him,
and also the standards set out in the Statement of Policy
on Appointment and Tenure ("substantial and manifest
incompetence, substantial and manifest neglect of duty,
or personal conduct substantially impairing the individ
ual's performance of his appropriate function within the
university community"). Prior to the hearing, the Board
rejected Professor Franklin's challenge on the vagueness
and overbreadth of the charges; at the same time, it
reserved its decision regarding the similar claims directed
to the underlying tenure regulations. The Board now
rejects these claims as well, for reasons we discuss below.
Vagueness and Overbreadth: The State Context
The term "overbreadth," as the parties agree, means
that a regulation encompasses both conduct which the
institution can legitimately prohibit, and conduct which
is Constitutionally protected against such prohibition,
'.e., speech of the sort shielded from governmental
estraints by the First Amendment. "Vagueness" is a
lifferent but related defect which leaves the meaning of
he regulation uncertain, in such a way that a member of
„n institution cannot reasonably judge what conduct is
prohibited and what conduct is permitted.
The simplest level at which an argument of over
breadth may be met is to ask whether the conduct for
which an individual is allegedly culpable under some
regulation is Constitutionally protected. If that were
found to be the case, then obviously the Constitution
would not allow the individual to be penalized under the
regulation because, no matter how precisely and clearly
its terms describe the conduct, the prohibition was
illegitimate under Constitutional provisions. Professor
rnnl'Hn mnlfltoinr -it flir* I pta'irrroc aOQinct

him deal with actions that are Constitutionally pro
tected. He goes further, however, to argue that even if
the Constitution would allow his prosecution for that
conduct in which he engaged, and even if that conduct
were clearly covered by the University's tenure regula
tion, that regulation is inapplicable to him simply be
cause of its overbreadth. This conclusion is argued from
the principle that society places a high value on the free
exercise of speech, and that it can tolerate no "chilling
effect" on this freedom. If a regulation covers both
permitted and prohibited conduct, then it may deter
others from exercising First Amendment rights which
fall under the improperly constructed portion of the
regulation's roof. Even a person guilty of legitimately
proscribable conduct may be rewarded for pointing out
the Constitutional infirmity of the regulation under
which he was prosecuted by relieving him of the con
sequences of his guilt. For the vice of overbreadth, the
institution is forced to invalidate the regulation over its
entire range of application, and to substitute for it a
more narrowly drawn regulation which will withstand
Constitutional scrutiny.
The vagueness doctrine, by contrast, is in substantial
part a canon of ordinary fairness. If a jurisdiction has
not identified a particular kind of conduct as subject to
punishment, it should not then be able to punish
perpetrators of such conduct. Vague regulations may
share some of the disadvantages of overbroad regula
tions, because their indefiniteness may overlap Constitu
tionally-guaranteed zones of activity and deter people
from doing what they have the right to do. Where
indefinite regulations are applied to speech, the vague
ness then invades an activity of such high social utility
that it claims special protection in the Constitution.
Again, it may be justifiable to reward persons who, while
knowingly engaging in activity that the institution may
legitimately proscribe, can show that the regulation is
vague at the border between punishable and protected
conduct. Like the transgressor who points out over
breadth, the identifier of vagueness—even though he
might be guilty under a properly drawn regulation
might receive a benefit for helping to thaw improperly
frozen expression.
Vague regulations introduce other difficulties as well
in a state context. The responsibility for drafting of
governing regulations rests with legislators who are ac
countable through political processes; when they enact a
vague statute, they shift responsibility for the law
making function onto the courts, who must take up the
legislator's abandoned obligations and give the statute
meaning in the course of applying it. Such a transfer of
responsibility might unduly disturb the balance of
powers among the branches of government. Further
more, the law enforcement authorities as well as the
courts have received the responsibility transferred by the
vague regulation, and may thereby he afforded unduly
wide discretion in the selection of whom to prosecute.
Obviously, such freedom might be exercised arbitrarily,
or for the purpose of retaliating against Constitutionally
protected activities. Finally, the adjudicating process
itsrlf (!•!• <T>ri v»v wwiie regulations: both the parties
and the decision maker are at a loss as to how to prepare
the case, what evidence to introduce, what arguments to
make, and what standards to use in deciding it.
Vagueness and Overbreadth: The University Context
These reflections on the briefs and arguments of the
parties regarding the doctrines of vagueness and over
breadth spell out certain problems, but hardly take us
directly to a resolution of the present issues. The legal
material pressed on us by the parties deals with problems
of vagueness and overbreadth in contexts which often
depart substantially from that applying in this case. It is
on this ground that we set aside the cases on student
discipline that both parties have reviewed for us in some
detail. Our examination of these cases persuades us that
the law in this field is incompletely settled; a rapid rate
of contemporary change has generated substantial dis
agreement and a conspicuously confused rationale.
There may be a trend toward enhanced protection, and
an employment of concepts of vagueness and over
breadth similar to those urged upon us by Professor
Franklin. But we recognize important differences in the
relationship between the institution and students, on the
one hand, the faculty, on the other. Students are much
more numerous; their time in the institution is shorter;
their fiscal relationaship with it is entirely different; and
a different tradition of academic freedom obtains. These
difficulties emphasize our conclusion that the problems
of vagueness and overbreadth, as well as other aspects of
the case, must be analyzed with due regard for the
framework—and the atmosphere-of the relation be
tween a faculty member and the University.
We may dispense quickly with two of the difficulties
engendered by vagueness. In some other procedural
system, vague regulations may produce problems in the
preparation, hearing and decision of the case, since none
of the participants can find his way in the fog created by
the lack of underlying standards. However, we consider
the charges in this case reasonably narrow and specific.
In our opinion, they are fully adequate to state an
intelligible conception of the case on the part of the
University administration, give Professor Franklin notice
of the conduct with which he is charged and enable him
to prepare and present his defense, and equip the Board
to shape the hearing and focus on commonly understood
issues. Beyond this, the Board afforded each party the
opportunity to obtain pre-hearing disclosure from the
other party of information and contentions relevant to
the case.
We also do not believe that the role of vague statutes
in unbalancing the separation of governmental processes
is one that need concern us in this situation. The faculty
of the university is a small community, characterized by
face-to-face contact and personal interaction. Legislation
proscribing conduct in a disciplinary context is rare;
when it occurs, it merely codifies previously shared
understandings. While there is clearly some allocation of
function as between faculty and administration, with
ultimate authority retained in the Board of Trustees as a
matter of legal right, interchanges and combinations of
roles are heavily involved in the actual governance of the
university. Faculty members relate to the institution
more through practice and informally negotiated con
sensus than through hierarchically codified rule. Rules of
conduct thus trace their source to slowly evolving
tradition rather than to abrupt acts of legislative inter
vention by persons in positions of formal authority.
Lack of centralization—often aided by small size and
extensive interaction—obviate for the university faculty
the need for the kind of detailed directions that guide
the armies of bureaucrats upon which larger organiza
tions often rely for administering centrally-determined
policies.
There remain the problems of fair warning, of over
breadth, and of undue discretion in enforcement.
Against the background of the relationship between
citizen and state, it is easy to make these issues appear
genuine and substantial. Plainly, it would be intolerable
for the state to provide that a citizen could be im
prisoned for "substantial and manifest incompetence,
substantial and manifest neglect of duty, or personal
conduct substantially impairing the individual's perfor
mance of his appropriate functions within the communi
ty." The situation is different, we believe, when the
public to which similar regulations are addressed is the
faculty of the university. In the more restricted setting,
the regulation invokes a web of largely unwritten rules as
tough and living as the British Constitution. Powerful
traditions, modified by contemporary practice, furnish a
reliable guide to faculty conduct, and entrust review
procedures to faculty peers-in this case, to a faculty
hearing board elected by the faculty. Nothing in those
traditions collides with Constitutionally guarded free
doms. On the contrary, it is the University's responsi
bility to enhance the exercise of rights of speech which
the First Amendment merely protects against govern
mental interference.
We would emphasize the meager record of the aca
demic community's experience with faculty discipline.
This may well be because faculty members chose their
profession in part because they embrace traditional
faculty norms, therefore performing willingly what writ
ten rules coerce in other systems. Indeed, the kind of
written rules contained in court decisions and codes are
not merely responses to the need for prior warning.
They are also the result of society's experience in
enforcing pre-existing norms against a partly recalcitrant
population—as suggested by the maxim that "ignorance
of the law is no excuse." The general practice of
conforming to norms may instruct individual faculty
members about those norms just as clearly as would
occasional cases of discipline for breach of standards.
This wide observance of the norms of faculty conduct
cannot disguise the fact of strong disagreement with
them among some faculty; dissent from a rule, or even
from the entire system of rules, obviously exists, and
must exist to furnish the motive power for necessary
change. But disagreement with a rule is not the same as
ignorance of its terms.
It is perhaps true that a fully-developed code would
be a more readily interprctable guide. But we believe
that the institution and its members would pay a heavy
price for such codification in terms of lost faculty
autonomy and initiative, and in over-bureaucratization.
This detriment should be carefully weighed before the
university accepts regulations spelled out in greater
detail. What we have called the web of unwritten rules of
faculty conduct is not clear or easy to apply in all cases;
on the contrary, there are borderline cases, and intracta
ble problems of application. But codified systems of
rules, too, are inevitably characterized by gaps and
conflicts—and suffer from certain pathologies precisely
because they are written. For example, rules designed to
protect speech by limiting other speech are double
edged; in either direction, they cut into regions that lie
under the protection o<*the First Amendment.

On balance, we favor the present reliance on largely
unwritten standards. But whatever the future holds in
this regard, we find the present understandings adequate
ly clear to guide faculty members in choosing among
various courses of action in particular situations.
Statement of Policy on Appointment and Tenure
The duties of a faculty member include, obviously,
specific teaching and scholarly obligations that are un
derstood primarily in terms of arrangements reached
voluntarily between the individual and his department or
some other institutional unit. Such obligations are gen
erally not spelled out in writing, perhaps because pro
fessors object to formal job descriptions. Nonetheless,
failure to meet commitments of this kind would clearly
constitute "substantial and manifest neglect of duty."
Similarly, "performance of his appropriate function in
the University" means the meeting of the full range of
agreed-upon institutional obligations. Professor Franklin,
in his final argument, characterizes the Statement of
Policy on Appointment and Tenure as being worded so
as to protect the performance of these positive obliga
tions—to enable the institution to weed out the demon
strably incompetent. But the unwritten understandings
discussed above give to the terms "duty" and "appro
priate function" a character of limitation as well as of
obligation. The fulfillment of a faculty member's duty
to his students and colleagues is understood to involve
an obligation to refrain from corrupting the intellectual
transactions that are the essence of the university, and
the other activities that support these. This does not, of
course, mean that he must exhibit political conformity
with the objectives of the institution; the university
must accommodate the questioning of contemporary
goals and structures, and must even tolerate the view
that the university, or the professoriate, should not
survive. There is positive benefit in having on the faculty
active representatives of political views that, while they
may be considered extreme or dissenting here, are held
by large numbers of people in the world and comprise a
dominant form of political organization in many places.
It seems likely that students can get a better education
about the nature of these ideas from proponents than
they can obtain through an exposure only to disengaged
analysts. Proponents are often also proselytizers: that
freedom should be granted also so long as its exercise
does not infringe upon the free choice of others. The
code of the institution does, however, demand that the
speech and conduct of a professor stay behind the line
of inciting or physically causing the impairment of the
institution's functions, especially its function as a forum
in which various other points of view can also be heard.
Policy on Campus Disruptions
The Policy on Campus Disruptions (hereafter called
the Policy) first appeared in 1965. It was a first attempt
to provide more detailed codification of conduct that
might be proscribed on the campus. The Policy was
clearly never intended to list all behavior that a faculty
member might engage in that was against university
policy; indeed, its original authors (the no-longer-extant
Committee on University Policy) did not even aim it
explicitly at faculty, so that it later had to be ratified by
the Academic Senate in 1968. That bit of legislative
history is interesting: although there was some debate
about a linked proposal concerning the judicial mechan
ism for dealing with faculty violators, no member of the
Senate offered dissent to a single substantive element of
the Policy. This episode shows, perhaps more clearly
than anything else, that the Policy was widely and
immediately accepted because it articulated some as
sumptions about appropriate conduct that most faculty
members heid in common.
Another way of illustrating this proposition is to
suppose that there were no Policy. Would the University
then be powerless to take action against a faculty
member for any of the acts described therein? In other
words, do we really insist on requiring that every
proscribed action be named in a document before we
place it on the other side of the line? The Board believes
that the answer to each of these questions is "no." We
have concluded above that there are common under
standings of appropriate faculty conduct, and that con
duct therefore exists which, even though it may not be
listed in an official policy, is nevertheless sanctionable.
With this background, we can consider the specific
conduct of the Policy. It lists several general positive
obligations:
a. to maintain "an atmosphere conducive to schol
arly pursuits"
b. "to preserve the dignity and seriousness of
University ceremonies and public exercises"
c. "to respect the rights of individuals"
The Policy also includes several specific areas of pro
scribed conduct:
a. "to prevent or disrupt the effective carrying out
of a University function or approved activity such
as lectures, meetings, [and] public events. ..
b. "to obstruct the legitimate movement of any
person about the campus or in any University
building or facility."
The Board believes that these provisions provide a clear
statement amplifying and defining some of the concepts
expressed more generally in the Statement of Policy on
Appointment and Tenure. Its applicability to faculty
members is beyond doubt.
Protected pi Punishable Speech: The Relation of the
Policy " to Incitement
We now turn to the fact that the Policy does not
specifically prohibit incitement. The failure to deal with
such speech is not, in the Board's view, the result of a
conscious decision to protect all speech. Rather, it is one
aspect of the history of the Policy, which was formu
lated quickly to meet a momentary need for the articula
tion of certain basic, commonly-held views. The Board
does not accept the argument that the Policy's omission
of a discussion of incitement automatically removes it
from prohibition.
In the Board's view, incitement to illegal conduct—as
we shall define it below-is an abuse of power. Such
abuse is a serious matter in a university, especially when
faculty members are addressing students. We see no
excuse for placing certain conduct beyond the law of the
campus, as the Policy does, and then implying blanket
permission for faculty members to incite others to
engage in that same conduct.
Protected vs. Punishable Speech: Standards
We do, however, see every reason for taking care that
the standard for incitement is carefully drawn, with due
cognizance of those First Amendment protections that
apply to the relation between state and citizen. A wide
range of standards has been offered to us. At one
extreme, we were urged by counsel for Professor Frank

lin that no speech should be punished by the university,
regardless of its incitement to illegal acts. At the other,
we might have ruled sanctionable the advocacy of
vaguely-defined violent action proposed for some time in
the indefinite future. In ruling on the White Plaza and
Old Union speeches, we shall meet a standard suggested
by the Supreme Court decision discussed at length by
the parties in this case. The court in Brandenburg vs.
Ohio (395 US 444) held that to be punishable, advocacy
must "be directed to inciting or producing imminent
lawless action, and. . .likely to produce such action." A
vague exhortation is not punishable under such a stand
ard; on the other extreme it is clearly unreasonable to
demand, as did counsel for Professor Franklin, that there
be an exact correspondence between specific acts advo
cated and those that follow. Subsequent illegal acts arc
not in fact required for incitement to be punishable
under this standard. Such acts might, for example, have
been prevented by external circumstances, or illegal acts
might occur but differ from those advocated. Subse
quent acts are useful in determining the level and
character of risk that obtained at the time of the alleged
incitement. In judging the applicability of the standard
cited, the Board has been guided by the following
considerations:
a. What is the entire context surrounding the alleged
incitement, including the immediate risk of lawless
action?
b. What is specifically being communicated to the
audience?
c. What did the speaker intend? We judge intent on
the basis of the speaker's own knowledge of the
context for his speech, his awareness of the level of
the risk, and the words he actually used.
In the application of this standard, punishable advocacy
need not identify particular acts, but it must include
advocacy of lawless conduct. Inclusion of advocacy of
legal acts with advocacy of lawless conduct does not
immunize that advocacy from punishment. In the appli
cation of this standard to the campus, it is clear that
"lawless action" refers to acts against the law of the
campus, that is, to conduct proscribed by the Policy or
University regulations, or clearly prohibited under the
kind of common understanding of conduct discussed
above.
With respect to the Computation Center incident, the
Board has applied a different standard.Professor Frank
lin is charged with intentionally inciting students and
others to disregard and disobey a police order to dis
perse. If, knowing the risk, he increased the risk of
personal injury to other persons, some of whom were
unaware of the risk, then his conduct is punishable.
Incitement need not be directed to increasing the likeli
hood of illegal conduct; it may also be punishable if it
places persons at heightened physical risk, as with the
cry of "fire" in a crowded theatre. Such speech is clearly
not Constitutionally protected.
It may be argued that the university should allow
more scope than the Constitution, or the current de
mands of society, would require; indeed, it has been put
to us that the university should not undertake to restrain
speech at all. We believe the university's prohibition of
incitement, given the criteria of intent, risk and immi
nence discussed above, is fully justified when speech
threatens two central university interests: (1) protection
of members of the university community and university
facilities against risks of serious injury or damage; (2)
protection against coercive intrusion on the intellectual
transactions which the university seeks to foster.

We observe also that in taking this position we have
rejected a formulation urged upon us by a group of
intervening faculty. In their view, dismissal from a
tenured position is warranted only for "failure to per
form the duties for which one was hired-teaching,
and/or research. .or for previous conviction of "some
criminal act." We believe it is inappropriate to tie tenure
proceedings to the criminal process. The standard sug
gested by the interveners would, to be sure, relieve the
Board of the difficult obligation to construct a narrative
of disputed events as a basis for judgment. However
desirable that might be, we find it almost the only virtue
in their position. A criminal proceeding may require
several years to resolve, and it may terminate favorably
to the accused for reasons which have nothing to do
with a faculty member's fitness to retain his position. It
is not obvious why the university should be dependent
on external prosecution policy, which may respond to a
number of factors but which is unlikely to reflect any
sensitive judgment of university interests as a central
concern. It does seem clear that sound decisions, on the
issue ol penalty perhaps even more than on the issue of
culpability, under university standards, will require the
kind ol intimate familiarity with the facts of a case that
can be best provided by professional peers. On this basis,
the mere tact ol conviction of criminal offenses could be
a wholly insufficient guide to wise disposition within the
university.
Relation oj Speech to the Institution
Lastly, we turn to the circumstances under which
speech occurs, and to the relationship between those
circumstances and the 'duty' and 'appropriate function'
ol the speaker. Speech and conduct by faculty members
have in other cases been treated according to different
standards depending upon whether they were judged to
be connected with the faculty member's duties or
unrelated to them.
Professor Franklin has applied the term "extracurri
cular" to his speech at the two rallies. The Board cannot
agree with this use of the term, if by it Professor
Franklin intends to place the speeches in question
outside the framework of his duties and appropriate
function in the university. There is a degree of differ
ence, to be sure, bewteen speech in the classroom and
speech outside it; it may reasonably be held, for exam
ple, that explicit advocacy of a political position un
related to the subject matter of a course is improper
when delivered in front of a class, but is not when
delivered at a rally outside the classroom door. But that
view does not automatically remove all activities that
take place outside the classroom door from the reach of
institutional regulation. In a residential university, facul
ty members relate professionally to students in many
ways: in offices, at the dinner table, in informal advising
situations, and so on. These relationships certainly do
not resemble contacts between that faculty member and
citizens on a downtown street. We believe that the ,
speech of a faculty member to a campus audience on
campus issues is subject to regulations, though the
standard applied to it will be different from that applied
to a classroom situation. Indeed, the location of the
recommended target may equally serve to define speech
in relation to the institution: a faculty member inciting
an off-campus crowd to occupy a university building
illegally is, in our view, liable to institutional regulation.
We will now consider the specific charges in the light
of these standards.
Much attention has been paid by the parties to
'Constitutional' questions that may apply to the matter
before us. We here respond to that concern by treating
some of the major issues of this kind that have been
raised in argument and briefs by the parties.
"State Action"
Constitutional standards of due process and free
speech restrain the state. At one point in this proceeding
the University administration expressed the view that
disciplinary proceedings at a private institution are not
necessarily subject to Constitutional protections, while
Professor Franklin has responded that Stanford is in
substantial part publicly financed and publicly regulated
and that the Constitution is consequently as fully appli
cable to Stanford as to an agency of the state. The
merits of these two competing views aside, the Board
does not believe that the disagreement between them
focusses upon the important issues.
Tenure proceedings at all universities, private and
public, involve an attempt to abrogate permanence of
employment for cause.
Tenure, accurately and unequivocally defined, lays no
claim wiiatever to a guarantee of lifetime employ
ment. Rather, tenure provides only that no person
continuously retained as a full-time faculty member
beyond a specified lengthy period of probationary
service may thereafter be dismissed without adequate
cause. Moreover, the particular standards of'adequate
cause' to which the tenured faculty is accountable are
themselves wholly within the prerogative of each
university to determine through its own published
rules, save only that those rules not be applied in a
manner which violates the academic freedom or the
ordinary personal civil liberties of the individual. An
institution may provide for dismissal for 'adequate
cause' arising from failure to meet a specified norm of
performance or productivity, as well as from specified
acts of affirmative misconduct.. . .
. . .This accompanying complement of academic due
process merely establishes that a fairly rigorous pro
cedure will be observed whenever formal complaint is
made that dismissal is justified on some stated ground
of professional irresponsibility, to insure the fair
determination of three facts:
1. that the stated cause is the authentic cause for
dismissal, rather than a pretense or makeweight for
considerations invading the academic freedom or
ordinary personal civil liberties of the individual;
2. that the stated cause exists in fact;
3. that the degree of demonstrated professional
irresponsibility warrants outright termination of
the individual's appointment rather than some
lesser sanction, even after taking into account the
balance of his entire service and the personal
consequences of dismissal.
(Van Alstyne, N. Bulletin oj the American Asso
ciation of University Professors. Autumn. 1971)

Given the essentially identical character of the in
quiry in tenure cases, neither the standards of due
process nor the content of regulations covering speech
need differ between private and public institutions of
higher learning. It is open to a private university to
impose Constitutional limitations on itself as a deliberate
choice of policy; in advance of the hearing the Board
committed itself to at least this much in undertaking to
provide for Professor Franklin "no less protection oi his
Constitutional rights at Stanford than that to which he
would be entitled as a member of the faculty of a state
university." In the opinion of the Board the more
significant questions are: What are the Constitutional
boundaries? What should be the university's policies
beyind the minimum standards set by the Constitution?
We emphasize at the outset that we do not regard the
conduct described in the charges filed by the University
administration to be constitutionally protected against
University discipline. On the contrary, we consider such
conduct to be clearly within the reach of institutional
authority. The university charges that the two speeches
involve advocacy that is directed to inciting or producing
imminent lawless action, and likely to produce such
action. The charge on the Computation Center incident
deals with conduct which might unjustifiably increase
the risk of injury to others.
But this is not all that needs to be said about the
matter. Professor Franklin has also characterized as
"vague" and "overbroad" the charges made against him,
and also the standards set out in the Statement of Policy
on Appointment and Tenure ("substantial and manifest
incompetence, substantial and manifest neglect of duty,
or personal conduct substantially impairing the individ
ual's performance of his appropriate function within the
university community"). Prior to the hearing, the Board
rejected Professor Franklin's challenge on the vagueness
and overbreadth of the charges; at the same time, it
reserved its decision regarding the similar claims directed
to the underlying tenure regulations. The Board now
rejects these claims as well, for reasons we discuss below.
Vagueness and Overbreadth: The State Context
The term "overbreadth," as the parties agree, means
that a regulation encompasses both conduct which the
institution can legitimately prohibit, and conduct which
is Constitutionally protected against such prohibition,
'.e., speech of the sort shielded from governmental
estraints by the First Amendment. "Vagueness" is a
lifferent but related defect which leaves the meaning of
he regulation uncertain, in such a way that a member of
„n institution cannot reasonably judge what conduct is
prohibited and what conduct is permitted.
The simplest level at which an argument of over
breadth may be met is to ask whether the conduct for
which an individual is allegedly culpable under some
regulation is Constitutionally protected. If that were
found to be the case, then obviously the Constitution
would not allow the individual to be penalized under the
regulation because, no matter how precisely and clearly
its terms describe the conduct, the prohibition was
illegitimate under Constitutional provisions. Professor
rnnl'Hn mnlfltoinr -it flir* I pta'irrroc aOQinct

him deal with actions that are Constitutionally pro
tected. He goes further, however, to argue that even if
the Constitution would allow his prosecution for that
conduct in which he engaged, and even if that conduct
were clearly covered by the University's tenure regula
tion, that regulation is inapplicable to him simply be
cause of its overbreadth. This conclusion is argued from
the principle that society places a high value on the free
exercise of speech, and that it can tolerate no "chilling
effect" on this freedom. If a regulation covers both
permitted and prohibited conduct, then it may deter
others from exercising First Amendment rights which
fall under the improperly constructed portion of the
regulation's roof. Even a person guilty of legitimately
proscribable conduct may be rewarded for pointing out
the Constitutional infirmity of the regulation under
which he was prosecuted by relieving him of the con
sequences of his guilt. For the vice of overbreadth, the
institution is forced to invalidate the regulation over its
entire range of application, and to substitute for it a
more narrowly drawn regulation which will withstand
Constitutional scrutiny.
The vagueness doctrine, by contrast, is in substantial
part a canon of ordinary fairness. If a jurisdiction has
not identified a particular kind of conduct as subject to
punishment, it should not then be able to punish
perpetrators of such conduct. Vague regulations may
share some of the disadvantages of overbroad regula
tions, because their indefiniteness may overlap Constitu
tionally-guaranteed zones of activity and deter people
from doing what they have the right to do. Where
indefinite regulations are applied to speech, the vague
ness then invades an activity of such high social utility
that it claims special protection in the Constitution.
Again, it may be justifiable to reward persons who, while
knowingly engaging in activity that the institution may
legitimately proscribe, can show that the regulation is
vague at the border between punishable and protected
conduct. Like the transgressor who points out over
breadth, the identifier of vagueness—even though he
might be guilty under a properly drawn regulation
might receive a benefit for helping to thaw improperly
frozen expression.
Vague regulations introduce other difficulties as well
in a state context. The responsibility for drafting of
governing regulations rests with legislators who are ac
countable through political processes; when they enact a
vague statute, they shift responsibility for the law
making function onto the courts, who must take up the
legislator's abandoned obligations and give the statute
meaning in the course of applying it. Such a transfer of
responsibility might unduly disturb the balance of
powers among the branches of government. Further
more, the law enforcement authorities as well as the
courts have received the responsibility transferred by the
vague regulation, and may thereby he afforded unduly
wide discretion in the selection of whom to prosecute.
Obviously, such freedom might be exercised arbitrarily,
or for the purpose of retaliating against Constitutionally
protected activities. Finally, the adjudicating process
itsrlf (!•!• <T>ri v»v wwiie regulations: both the parties
and the decision maker are at a loss as to how to prepare
the case, what evidence to introduce, what arguments to
make, and what standards to use in deciding it.
Vagueness and Overbreadth: The University Context
These reflections on the briefs and arguments of the
parties regarding the doctrines of vagueness and over
breadth spell out certain problems, but hardly take us
directly to a resolution of the present issues. The legal
material pressed on us by the parties deals with problems
of vagueness and overbreadth in contexts which often
depart substantially from that applying in this case. It is
on this ground that we set aside the cases on student
discipline that both parties have reviewed for us in some
detail. Our examination of these cases persuades us that
the law in this field is incompletely settled; a rapid rate
of contemporary change has generated substantial dis
agreement and a conspicuously confused rationale.
There may be a trend toward enhanced protection, and
an employment of concepts of vagueness and over
breadth similar to those urged upon us by Professor
Franklin. But we recognize important differences in the
relationship between the institution and students, on the
one hand, the faculty, on the other. Students are much
more numerous; their time in the institution is shorter;
their fiscal relationaship with it is entirely different; and
a different tradition of academic freedom obtains. These
difficulties emphasize our conclusion that the problems
of vagueness and overbreadth, as well as other aspects of
the case, must be analyzed with due regard for the
framework—and the atmosphere-of the relation be
tween a faculty member and the University.
We may dispense quickly with two of the difficulties
engendered by vagueness. In some other procedural
system, vague regulations may produce problems in the
preparation, hearing and decision of the case, since none
of the participants can find his way in the fog created by
the lack of underlying standards. However, we consider
the charges in this case reasonably narrow and specific.
In our opinion, they are fully adequate to state an
intelligible conception of the case on the part of the
University administration, give Professor Franklin notice
of the conduct with which he is charged and enable him
to prepare and present his defense, and equip the Board
to shape the hearing and focus on commonly understood
issues. Beyond this, the Board afforded each party the
opportunity to obtain pre-hearing disclosure from the
other party of information and contentions relevant to
the case.
We also do not believe that the role of vague statutes
in unbalancing the separation of governmental processes
is one that need concern us in this situation. The faculty
of the university is a small community, characterized by
face-to-face contact and personal interaction. Legislation
proscribing conduct in a disciplinary context is rare;
when it occurs, it merely codifies previously shared
understandings. While there is clearly some allocation of
function as between faculty and administration, with
ultimate authority retained in the Board of Trustees as a
matter of legal right, interchanges and combinations of
roles are heavily involved in the actual governance of the
university. Faculty members relate to the institution
more through practice and informally negotiated con
sensus than through hierarchically codified rule. Rules of
conduct thus trace their source to slowly evolving
tradition rather than to abrupt acts of legislative inter
vention by persons in positions of formal authority.
Lack of centralization—often aided by small size and
extensive interaction—obviate for the university faculty
the need for the kind of detailed directions that guide
the armies of bureaucrats upon which larger organiza
tions often rely for administering centrally-determined
policies.
There remain the problems of fair warning, of over
breadth, and of undue discretion in enforcement.
Against the background of the relationship between
citizen and state, it is easy to make these issues appear
genuine and substantial. Plainly, it would be intolerable
for the state to provide that a citizen could be im
prisoned for "substantial and manifest incompetence,
substantial and manifest neglect of duty, or personal
conduct substantially impairing the individual's perfor
mance of his appropriate functions within the communi
ty." The situation is different, we believe, when the
public to which similar regulations are addressed is the
faculty of the university. In the more restricted setting,
the regulation invokes a web of largely unwritten rules as
tough and living as the British Constitution. Powerful
traditions, modified by contemporary practice, furnish a
reliable guide to faculty conduct, and entrust review
procedures to faculty peers-in this case, to a faculty
hearing board elected by the faculty. Nothing in those
traditions collides with Constitutionally guarded free
doms. On the contrary, it is the University's responsi
bility to enhance the exercise of rights of speech which
the First Amendment merely protects against govern
mental interference.
We would emphasize the meager record of the aca
demic community's experience with faculty discipline.
This may well be because faculty members chose their
profession in part because they embrace traditional
faculty norms, therefore performing willingly what writ
ten rules coerce in other systems. Indeed, the kind of
written rules contained in court decisions and codes are
not merely responses to the need for prior warning.
They are also the result of society's experience in
enforcing pre-existing norms against a partly recalcitrant
population—as suggested by the maxim that "ignorance
of the law is no excuse." The general practice of
conforming to norms may instruct individual faculty
members about those norms just as clearly as would
occasional cases of discipline for breach of standards.
This wide observance of the norms of faculty conduct
cannot disguise the fact of strong disagreement with
them among some faculty; dissent from a rule, or even
from the entire system of rules, obviously exists, and
must exist to furnish the motive power for necessary
change. But disagreement with a rule is not the same as
ignorance of its terms.
It is perhaps true that a fully-developed code would
be a more readily interprctable guide. But we believe
that the institution and its members would pay a heavy
price for such codification in terms of lost faculty
autonomy and initiative, and in over-bureaucratization.
This detriment should be carefully weighed before the
university accepts regulations spelled out in greater
detail. What we have called the web of unwritten rules of
faculty conduct is not clear or easy to apply in all cases;
on the contrary, there are borderline cases, and intracta
ble problems of application. But codified systems of
rules, too, are inevitably characterized by gaps and
conflicts—and suffer from certain pathologies precisely
because they are written. For example, rules designed to
protect speech by limiting other speech are double
edged; in either direction, they cut into regions that lie
under the protection o<*the First Amendment.

On balance, we favor the present reliance on largely
unwritten standards. But whatever the future holds in
this regard, we find the present understandings adequate
ly clear to guide faculty members in choosing among
various courses of action in particular situations.
Statement of Policy on Appointment and Tenure
The duties of a faculty member include, obviously,
specific teaching and scholarly obligations that are un
derstood primarily in terms of arrangements reached
voluntarily between the individual and his department or
some other institutional unit. Such obligations are gen
erally not spelled out in writing, perhaps because pro
fessors object to formal job descriptions. Nonetheless,
failure to meet commitments of this kind would clearly
constitute "substantial and manifest neglect of duty."
Similarly, "performance of his appropriate function in
the University" means the meeting of the full range of
agreed-upon institutional obligations. Professor Franklin,
in his final argument, characterizes the Statement of
Policy on Appointment and Tenure as being worded so
as to protect the performance of these positive obliga
tions—to enable the institution to weed out the demon
strably incompetent. But the unwritten understandings
discussed above give to the terms "duty" and "appro
priate function" a character of limitation as well as of
obligation. The fulfillment of a faculty member's duty
to his students and colleagues is understood to involve
an obligation to refrain from corrupting the intellectual
transactions that are the essence of the university, and
the other activities that support these. This does not, of
course, mean that he must exhibit political conformity
with the objectives of the institution; the university
must accommodate the questioning of contemporary
goals and structures, and must even tolerate the view
that the university, or the professoriate, should not
survive. There is positive benefit in having on the faculty
active representatives of political views that, while they
may be considered extreme or dissenting here, are held
by large numbers of people in the world and comprise a
dominant form of political organization in many places.
It seems likely that students can get a better education
about the nature of these ideas from proponents than
they can obtain through an exposure only to disengaged
analysts. Proponents are often also proselytizers: that
freedom should be granted also so long as its exercise
does not infringe upon the free choice of others. The
code of the institution does, however, demand that the
speech and conduct of a professor stay behind the line
of inciting or physically causing the impairment of the
institution's functions, especially its function as a forum
in which various other points of view can also be heard.
Policy on Campus Disruptions
The Policy on Campus Disruptions (hereafter called
the Policy) first appeared in 1965. It was a first attempt
to provide more detailed codification of conduct that
might be proscribed on the campus. The Policy was
clearly never intended to list all behavior that a faculty
member might engage in that was against university
policy; indeed, its original authors (the no-longer-extant
Committee on University Policy) did not even aim it
explicitly at faculty, so that it later had to be ratified by
the Academic Senate in 1968. That bit of legislative
history is interesting: although there was some debate
about a linked proposal concerning the judicial mechan
ism for dealing with faculty violators, no member of the
Senate offered dissent to a single substantive element of
the Policy. This episode shows, perhaps more clearly
than anything else, that the Policy was widely and
immediately accepted because it articulated some as
sumptions about appropriate conduct that most faculty
members heid in common.
Another way of illustrating this proposition is to
suppose that there were no Policy. Would the University
then be powerless to take action against a faculty
member for any of the acts described therein? In other
words, do we really insist on requiring that every
proscribed action be named in a document before we
place it on the other side of the line? The Board believes
that the answer to each of these questions is "no." We
have concluded above that there are common under
standings of appropriate faculty conduct, and that con
duct therefore exists which, even though it may not be
listed in an official policy, is nevertheless sanctionable.
With this background, we can consider the specific
conduct of the Policy. It lists several general positive
obligations:
a. to maintain "an atmosphere conducive to schol
arly pursuits"
b. "to preserve the dignity and seriousness of
University ceremonies and public exercises"
c. "to respect the rights of individuals"
The Policy also includes several specific areas of pro
scribed conduct:
a. "to prevent or disrupt the effective carrying out
of a University function or approved activity such
as lectures, meetings, [and] public events. ..
b. "to obstruct the legitimate movement of any
person about the campus or in any University
building or facility."
The Board believes that these provisions provide a clear
statement amplifying and defining some of the concepts
expressed more generally in the Statement of Policy on
Appointment and Tenure. Its applicability to faculty
members is beyond doubt.
Protected pi Punishable Speech: The Relation of the
Policy " to Incitement
We now turn to the fact that the Policy does not
specifically prohibit incitement. The failure to deal with
such speech is not, in the Board's view, the result of a
conscious decision to protect all speech. Rather, it is one
aspect of the history of the Policy, which was formu
lated quickly to meet a momentary need for the articula
tion of certain basic, commonly-held views. The Board
does not accept the argument that the Policy's omission
of a discussion of incitement automatically removes it
from prohibition.
In the Board's view, incitement to illegal conduct—as
we shall define it below-is an abuse of power. Such
abuse is a serious matter in a university, especially when
faculty members are addressing students. We see no
excuse for placing certain conduct beyond the law of the
campus, as the Policy does, and then implying blanket
permission for faculty members to incite others to
engage in that same conduct.
Protected vs. Punishable Speech: Standards
We do, however, see every reason for taking care that
the standard for incitement is carefully drawn, with due
cognizance of those First Amendment protections that
apply to the relation between state and citizen. A wide
range of standards has been offered to us. At one
extreme, we were urged by counsel for Professor Frank

lin that no speech should be punished by the university,
regardless of its incitement to illegal acts. At the other,
we might have ruled sanctionable the advocacy of
vaguely-defined violent action proposed for some time in
the indefinite future. In ruling on the White Plaza and
Old Union speeches, we shall meet a standard suggested
by the Supreme Court decision discussed at length by
the parties in this case. The court in Brandenburg vs.
Ohio (395 US 444) held that to be punishable, advocacy
must "be directed to inciting or producing imminent
lawless action, and. . .likely to produce such action." A
vague exhortation is not punishable under such a stand
ard; on the other extreme it is clearly unreasonable to
demand, as did counsel for Professor Franklin, that there
be an exact correspondence between specific acts advo
cated and those that follow. Subsequent illegal acts arc
not in fact required for incitement to be punishable
under this standard. Such acts might, for example, have
been prevented by external circumstances, or illegal acts
might occur but differ from those advocated. Subse
quent acts are useful in determining the level and
character of risk that obtained at the time of the alleged
incitement. In judging the applicability of the standard
cited, the Board has been guided by the following
considerations:
a. What is the entire context surrounding the alleged
incitement, including the immediate risk of lawless
action?
b. What is specifically being communicated to the
audience?
c. What did the speaker intend? We judge intent on
the basis of the speaker's own knowledge of the
context for his speech, his awareness of the level of
the risk, and the words he actually used.
In the application of this standard, punishable advocacy
need not identify particular acts, but it must include
advocacy of lawless conduct. Inclusion of advocacy of
legal acts with advocacy of lawless conduct does not
immunize that advocacy from punishment. In the appli
cation of this standard to the campus, it is clear that
"lawless action" refers to acts against the law of the
campus, that is, to conduct proscribed by the Policy or
University regulations, or clearly prohibited under the
kind of common understanding of conduct discussed
above.
With respect to the Computation Center incident, the
Board has applied a different standard.Professor Frank
lin is charged with intentionally inciting students and
others to disregard and disobey a police order to dis
perse. If, knowing the risk, he increased the risk of
personal injury to other persons, some of whom were
unaware of the risk, then his conduct is punishable.
Incitement need not be directed to increasing the likeli
hood of illegal conduct; it may also be punishable if it
places persons at heightened physical risk, as with the
cry of "fire" in a crowded theatre. Such speech is clearly
not Constitutionally protected.
It may be argued that the university should allow
more scope than the Constitution, or the current de
mands of society, would require; indeed, it has been put
to us that the university should not undertake to restrain
speech at all. We believe the university's prohibition of
incitement, given the criteria of intent, risk and immi
nence discussed above, is fully justified when speech
threatens two central university interests: (1) protection
of members of the university community and university
facilities against risks of serious injury or damage; (2)
protection against coercive intrusion on the intellectual
transactions which the university seeks to foster.

We observe also that in taking this position we have
rejected a formulation urged upon us by a group of
intervening faculty. In their view, dismissal from a
tenured position is warranted only for "failure to per
form the duties for which one was hired-teaching,
and/or research. .or for previous conviction of "some
criminal act." We believe it is inappropriate to tie tenure
proceedings to the criminal process. The standard sug
gested by the interveners would, to be sure, relieve the
Board of the difficult obligation to construct a narrative
of disputed events as a basis for judgment. However
desirable that might be, we find it almost the only virtue
in their position. A criminal proceeding may require
several years to resolve, and it may terminate favorably
to the accused for reasons which have nothing to do
with a faculty member's fitness to retain his position. It
is not obvious why the university should be dependent
on external prosecution policy, which may respond to a
number of factors but which is unlikely to reflect any
sensitive judgment of university interests as a central
concern. It does seem clear that sound decisions, on the
issue ol penalty perhaps even more than on the issue of
culpability, under university standards, will require the
kind ol intimate familiarity with the facts of a case that
can be best provided by professional peers. On this basis,
the mere tact ol conviction of criminal offenses could be
a wholly insufficient guide to wise disposition within the
university.
Relation oj Speech to the Institution
Lastly, we turn to the circumstances under which
speech occurs, and to the relationship between those
circumstances and the 'duty' and 'appropriate function'
ol the speaker. Speech and conduct by faculty members
have in other cases been treated according to different
standards depending upon whether they were judged to
be connected with the faculty member's duties or
unrelated to them.
Professor Franklin has applied the term "extracurri
cular" to his speech at the two rallies. The Board cannot
agree with this use of the term, if by it Professor
Franklin intends to place the speeches in question
outside the framework of his duties and appropriate
function in the university. There is a degree of differ
ence, to be sure, bewteen speech in the classroom and
speech outside it; it may reasonably be held, for exam
ple, that explicit advocacy of a political position un
related to the subject matter of a course is improper
when delivered in front of a class, but is not when
delivered at a rally outside the classroom door. But that
view does not automatically remove all activities that
take place outside the classroom door from the reach of
institutional regulation. In a residential university, facul
ty members relate professionally to students in many
ways: in offices, at the dinner table, in informal advising
situations, and so on. These relationships certainly do
not resemble contacts between that faculty member and
citizens on a downtown street. We believe that the ,
speech of a faculty member to a campus audience on
campus issues is subject to regulations, though the
standard applied to it will be different from that applied
to a classroom situation. Indeed, the location of the
recommended target may equally serve to define speech
in relation to the institution: a faculty member inciting
an off-campus crowd to occupy a university building
illegally is, in our view, liable to institutional regulation.
We will now consider the specific charges in the light
of these standards.
Much attention has been paid by the parties to
'Constitutional' questions that may apply to the matter
before us. We here respond to that concern by treating
some of the major issues of this kind that have been
raised in argument and briefs by the parties.
"State Action"
Constitutional standards of due process and free
speech restrain the state. At one point in this proceeding
the University administration expressed the view that
disciplinary proceedings at a private institution are not
necessarily subject to Constitutional protections, while
Professor Franklin has responded that Stanford is in
substantial part publicly financed and publicly regulated
and that the Constitution is consequently as fully appli
cable to Stanford as to an agency of the state. The
merits of these two competing views aside, the Board
does not believe that the disagreement between them
focusses upon the important issues.
Tenure proceedings at all universities, private and
public, involve an attempt to abrogate permanence of
employment for cause.
Tenure, accurately and unequivocally defined, lays no
claim wiiatever to a guarantee of lifetime employ
ment. Rather, tenure provides only that no person
continuously retained as a full-time faculty member
beyond a specified lengthy period of probationary
service may thereafter be dismissed without adequate
cause. Moreover, the particular standards of'adequate
cause' to which the tenured faculty is accountable are
themselves wholly within the prerogative of each
university to determine through its own published
rules, save only that those rules not be applied in a
manner which violates the academic freedom or the
ordinary personal civil liberties of the individual. An
institution may provide for dismissal for 'adequate
cause' arising from failure to meet a specified norm of
performance or productivity, as well as from specified
acts of affirmative misconduct.. . .
. . .This accompanying complement of academic due
process merely establishes that a fairly rigorous pro
cedure will be observed whenever formal complaint is
made that dismissal is justified on some stated ground
of professional irresponsibility, to insure the fair
determination of three facts:
1. that the stated cause is the authentic cause for
dismissal, rather than a pretense or makeweight for
considerations invading the academic freedom or
ordinary personal civil liberties of the individual;
2. that the stated cause exists in fact;
3. that the degree of demonstrated professional
irresponsibility warrants outright termination of
the individual's appointment rather than some
lesser sanction, even after taking into account the
balance of his entire service and the personal
consequences of dismissal.
(Van Alstyne, N. Bulletin oj the American Asso
ciation of University Professors. Autumn. 1971)

Given the essentially identical character of the in
quiry in tenure cases, neither the standards of due
process nor the content of regulations covering speech
need differ between private and public institutions of
higher learning. It is open to a private university to
impose Constitutional limitations on itself as a deliberate
choice of policy; in advance of the hearing the Board
committed itself to at least this much in undertaking to
provide for Professor Franklin "no less protection oi his
Constitutional rights at Stanford than that to which he
would be entitled as a member of the faculty of a state
university." In the opinion of the Board the more
significant questions are: What are the Constitutional
boundaries? What should be the university's policies
beyind the minimum standards set by the Constitution?
We emphasize at the outset that we do not regard the
conduct described in the charges filed by the University
administration to be constitutionally protected against
University discipline. On the contrary, we consider such
conduct to be clearly within the reach of institutional
authority. The university charges that the two speeches
involve advocacy that is directed to inciting or producing
imminent lawless action, and likely to produce such
action. The charge on the Computation Center incident
deals with conduct which might unjustifiably increase
the risk of injury to others.
But this is not all that needs to be said about the
matter. Professor Franklin has also characterized as
"vague" and "overbroad" the charges made against him,
and also the standards set out in the Statement of Policy
on Appointment and Tenure ("substantial and manifest
incompetence, substantial and manifest neglect of duty,
or personal conduct substantially impairing the individ
ual's performance of his appropriate function within the
university community"). Prior to the hearing, the Board
rejected Professor Franklin's challenge on the vagueness
and overbreadth of the charges; at the same time, it
reserved its decision regarding the similar claims directed
to the underlying tenure regulations. The Board now
rejects these claims as well, for reasons we discuss below.
Vagueness and Overbreadth: The State Context
The term "overbreadth," as the parties agree, means
that a regulation encompasses both conduct which the
institution can legitimately prohibit, and conduct which
is Constitutionally protected against such prohibition,
'.e., speech of the sort shielded from governmental
estraints by the First Amendment. "Vagueness" is a
lifferent but related defect which leaves the meaning of
he regulation uncertain, in such a way that a member of
„n institution cannot reasonably judge what conduct is
prohibited and what conduct is permitted.
The simplest level at which an argument of over
breadth may be met is to ask whether the conduct for
which an individual is allegedly culpable under some
regulation is Constitutionally protected. If that were
found to be the case, then obviously the Constitution
would not allow the individual to be penalized under the
regulation because, no matter how precisely and clearly
its terms describe the conduct, the prohibition was
illegitimate under Constitutional provisions. Professor
rnnl'Hn mnlfltoinr -it flir* I pta'irrroc aOQinct

him deal with actions that are Constitutionally pro
tected. He goes further, however, to argue that even if
the Constitution would allow his prosecution for that
conduct in which he engaged, and even if that conduct
were clearly covered by the University's tenure regula
tion, that regulation is inapplicable to him simply be
cause of its overbreadth. This conclusion is argued from
the principle that society places a high value on the free
exercise of speech, and that it can tolerate no "chilling
effect" on this freedom. If a regulation covers both
permitted and prohibited conduct, then it may deter
others from exercising First Amendment rights which
fall under the improperly constructed portion of the
regulation's roof. Even a person guilty of legitimately
proscribable conduct may be rewarded for pointing out
the Constitutional infirmity of the regulation under
which he was prosecuted by relieving him of the con
sequences of his guilt. For the vice of overbreadth, the
institution is forced to invalidate the regulation over its
entire range of application, and to substitute for it a
more narrowly drawn regulation which will withstand
Constitutional scrutiny.
The vagueness doctrine, by contrast, is in substantial
part a canon of ordinary fairness. If a jurisdiction has
not identified a particular kind of conduct as subject to
punishment, it should not then be able to punish
perpetrators of such conduct. Vague regulations may
share some of the disadvantages of overbroad regula
tions, because their indefiniteness may overlap Constitu
tionally-guaranteed zones of activity and deter people
from doing what they have the right to do. Where
indefinite regulations are applied to speech, the vague
ness then invades an activity of such high social utility
that it claims special protection in the Constitution.
Again, it may be justifiable to reward persons who, while
knowingly engaging in activity that the institution may
legitimately proscribe, can show that the regulation is
vague at the border between punishable and protected
conduct. Like the transgressor who points out over
breadth, the identifier of vagueness—even though he
might be guilty under a properly drawn regulation
might receive a benefit for helping to thaw improperly
frozen expression.
Vague regulations introduce other difficulties as well
in a state context. The responsibility for drafting of
governing regulations rests with legislators who are ac
countable through political processes; when they enact a
vague statute, they shift responsibility for the law
making function onto the courts, who must take up the
legislator's abandoned obligations and give the statute
meaning in the course of applying it. Such a transfer of
responsibility might unduly disturb the balance of
powers among the branches of government. Further
more, the law enforcement authorities as well as the
courts have received the responsibility transferred by the
vague regulation, and may thereby he afforded unduly
wide discretion in the selection of whom to prosecute.
Obviously, such freedom might be exercised arbitrarily,
or for the purpose of retaliating against Constitutionally
protected activities. Finally, the adjudicating process
itsrlf (!•!• <T>ri v»v wwiie regulations: both the parties
and the decision maker are at a loss as to how to prepare
the case, what evidence to introduce, what arguments to
make, and what standards to use in deciding it.
Vagueness and Overbreadth: The University Context
These reflections on the briefs and arguments of the
parties regarding the doctrines of vagueness and over
breadth spell out certain problems, but hardly take us
directly to a resolution of the present issues. The legal
material pressed on us by the parties deals with problems
of vagueness and overbreadth in contexts which often
depart substantially from that applying in this case. It is
on this ground that we set aside the cases on student
discipline that both parties have reviewed for us in some
detail. Our examination of these cases persuades us that
the law in this field is incompletely settled; a rapid rate
of contemporary change has generated substantial dis
agreement and a conspicuously confused rationale.
There may be a trend toward enhanced protection, and
an employment of concepts of vagueness and over
breadth similar to those urged upon us by Professor
Franklin. But we recognize important differences in the
relationship between the institution and students, on the
one hand, the faculty, on the other. Students are much
more numerous; their time in the institution is shorter;
their fiscal relationaship with it is entirely different; and
a different tradition of academic freedom obtains. These
difficulties emphasize our conclusion that the problems
of vagueness and overbreadth, as well as other aspects of
the case, must be analyzed with due regard for the
framework—and the atmosphere-of the relation be
tween a faculty member and the University.
We may dispense quickly with two of the difficulties
engendered by vagueness. In some other procedural
system, vague regulations may produce problems in the
preparation, hearing and decision of the case, since none
of the participants can find his way in the fog created by
the lack of underlying standards. However, we consider
the charges in this case reasonably narrow and specific.
In our opinion, they are fully adequate to state an
intelligible conception of the case on the part of the
University administration, give Professor Franklin notice
of the conduct with which he is charged and enable him
to prepare and present his defense, and equip the Board
to shape the hearing and focus on commonly understood
issues. Beyond this, the Board afforded each party the
opportunity to obtain pre-hearing disclosure from the
other party of information and contentions relevant to
the case.
We also do not believe that the role of vague statutes
in unbalancing the separation of governmental processes
is one that need concern us in this situation. The faculty
of the university is a small community, characterized by
face-to-face contact and personal interaction. Legislation
proscribing conduct in a disciplinary context is rare;
when it occurs, it merely codifies previously shared
understandings. While there is clearly some allocation of
function as between faculty and administration, with
ultimate authority retained in the Board of Trustees as a
matter of legal right, interchanges and combinations of
roles are heavily involved in the actual governance of the
university. Faculty members relate to the institution
more through practice and informally negotiated con
sensus than through hierarchically codified rule. Rules of
conduct thus trace their source to slowly evolving
tradition rather than to abrupt acts of legislative inter
vention by persons in positions of formal authority.
Lack of centralization—often aided by small size and
extensive interaction—obviate for the university faculty
the need for the kind of detailed directions that guide
the armies of bureaucrats upon which larger organiza
tions often rely for administering centrally-determined
policies.
There remain the problems of fair warning, of over
breadth, and of undue discretion in enforcement.
Against the background of the relationship between
citizen and state, it is easy to make these issues appear
genuine and substantial. Plainly, it would be intolerable
for the state to provide that a citizen could be im
prisoned for "substantial and manifest incompetence,
substantial and manifest neglect of duty, or personal
conduct substantially impairing the individual's perfor
mance of his appropriate functions within the communi
ty." The situation is different, we believe, when the
public to which similar regulations are addressed is the
faculty of the university. In the more restricted setting,
the regulation invokes a web of largely unwritten rules as
tough and living as the British Constitution. Powerful
traditions, modified by contemporary practice, furnish a
reliable guide to faculty conduct, and entrust review
procedures to faculty peers-in this case, to a faculty
hearing board elected by the faculty. Nothing in those
traditions collides with Constitutionally guarded free
doms. On the contrary, it is the University's responsi
bility to enhance the exercise of rights of speech which
the First Amendment merely protects against govern
mental interference.
We would emphasize the meager record of the aca
demic community's experience with faculty discipline.
This may well be because faculty members chose their
profession in part because they embrace traditional
faculty norms, therefore performing willingly what writ
ten rules coerce in other systems. Indeed, the kind of
written rules contained in court decisions and codes are
not merely responses to the need for prior warning.
They are also the result of society's experience in
enforcing pre-existing norms against a partly recalcitrant
population—as suggested by the maxim that "ignorance
of the law is no excuse." The general practice of
conforming to norms may instruct individual faculty
members about those norms just as clearly as would
occasional cases of discipline for breach of standards.
This wide observance of the norms of faculty conduct
cannot disguise the fact of strong disagreement with
them among some faculty; dissent from a rule, or even
from the entire system of rules, obviously exists, and
must exist to furnish the motive power for necessary
change. But disagreement with a rule is not the same as
ignorance of its terms.
It is perhaps true that a fully-developed code would
be a more readily interprctable guide. But we believe
that the institution and its members would pay a heavy
price for such codification in terms of lost faculty
autonomy and initiative, and in over-bureaucratization.
This detriment should be carefully weighed before the
university accepts regulations spelled out in greater
detail. What we have called the web of unwritten rules of
faculty conduct is not clear or easy to apply in all cases;
on the contrary, there are borderline cases, and intracta
ble problems of application. But codified systems of
rules, too, are inevitably characterized by gaps and
conflicts—and suffer from certain pathologies precisely
because they are written. For example, rules designed to
protect speech by limiting other speech are double
edged; in either direction, they cut into regions that lie
under the protection o<*the First Amendment.

On balance, we favor the present reliance on largely
unwritten standards. But whatever the future holds in
this regard, we find the present understandings adequate
ly clear to guide faculty members in choosing among
various courses of action in particular situations.
Statement of Policy on Appointment and Tenure
The duties of a faculty member include, obviously,
specific teaching and scholarly obligations that are un
derstood primarily in terms of arrangements reached
voluntarily between the individual and his department or
some other institutional unit. Such obligations are gen
erally not spelled out in writing, perhaps because pro
fessors object to formal job descriptions. Nonetheless,
failure to meet commitments of this kind would clearly
constitute "substantial and manifest neglect of duty."
Similarly, "performance of his appropriate function in
the University" means the meeting of the full range of
agreed-upon institutional obligations. Professor Franklin,
in his final argument, characterizes the Statement of
Policy on Appointment and Tenure as being worded so
as to protect the performance of these positive obliga
tions—to enable the institution to weed out the demon
strably incompetent. But the unwritten understandings
discussed above give to the terms "duty" and "appro
priate function" a character of limitation as well as of
obligation. The fulfillment of a faculty member's duty
to his students and colleagues is understood to involve
an obligation to refrain from corrupting the intellectual
transactions that are the essence of the university, and
the other activities that support these. This does not, of
course, mean that he must exhibit political conformity
with the objectives of the institution; the university
must accommodate the questioning of contemporary
goals and structures, and must even tolerate the view
that the university, or the professoriate, should not
survive. There is positive benefit in having on the faculty
active representatives of political views that, while they
may be considered extreme or dissenting here, are held
by large numbers of people in the world and comprise a
dominant form of political organization in many places.
It seems likely that students can get a better education
about the nature of these ideas from proponents than
they can obtain through an exposure only to disengaged
analysts. Proponents are often also proselytizers: that
freedom should be granted also so long as its exercise
does not infringe upon the free choice of others. The
code of the institution does, however, demand that the
speech and conduct of a professor stay behind the line
of inciting or physically causing the impairment of the
institution's functions, especially its function as a forum
in which various other points of view can also be heard.
Policy on Campus Disruptions
The Policy on Campus Disruptions (hereafter called
the Policy) first appeared in 1965. It was a first attempt
to provide more detailed codification of conduct that
might be proscribed on the campus. The Policy was
clearly never intended to list all behavior that a faculty
member might engage in that was against university
policy; indeed, its original authors (the no-longer-extant
Committee on University Policy) did not even aim it
explicitly at faculty, so that it later had to be ratified by
the Academic Senate in 1968. That bit of legislative
history is interesting: although there was some debate
about a linked proposal concerning the judicial mechan
ism for dealing with faculty violators, no member of the
Senate offered dissent to a single substantive element of
the Policy. This episode shows, perhaps more clearly
than anything else, that the Policy was widely and
immediately accepted because it articulated some as
sumptions about appropriate conduct that most faculty
members heid in common.
Another way of illustrating this proposition is to
suppose that there were no Policy. Would the University
then be powerless to take action against a faculty
member for any of the acts described therein? In other
words, do we really insist on requiring that every
proscribed action be named in a document before we
place it on the other side of the line? The Board believes
that the answer to each of these questions is "no." We
have concluded above that there are common under
standings of appropriate faculty conduct, and that con
duct therefore exists which, even though it may not be
listed in an official policy, is nevertheless sanctionable.
With this background, we can consider the specific
conduct of the Policy. It lists several general positive
obligations:
a. to maintain "an atmosphere conducive to schol
arly pursuits"
b. "to preserve the dignity and seriousness of
University ceremonies and public exercises"
c. "to respect the rights of individuals"
The Policy also includes several specific areas of pro
scribed conduct:
a. "to prevent or disrupt the effective carrying out
of a University function or approved activity such
as lectures, meetings, [and] public events. ..
b. "to obstruct the legitimate movement of any
person about the campus or in any University
building or facility."
The Board believes that these provisions provide a clear
statement amplifying and defining some of the concepts
expressed more generally in the Statement of Policy on
Appointment and Tenure. Its applicability to faculty
members is beyond doubt.
Protected pi Punishable Speech: The Relation of the
Policy " to Incitement
We now turn to the fact that the Policy does not
specifically prohibit incitement. The failure to deal with
such speech is not, in the Board's view, the result of a
conscious decision to protect all speech. Rather, it is one
aspect of the history of the Policy, which was formu
lated quickly to meet a momentary need for the articula
tion of certain basic, commonly-held views. The Board
does not accept the argument that the Policy's omission
of a discussion of incitement automatically removes it
from prohibition.
In the Board's view, incitement to illegal conduct—as
we shall define it below-is an abuse of power. Such
abuse is a serious matter in a university, especially when
faculty members are addressing students. We see no
excuse for placing certain conduct beyond the law of the
campus, as the Policy does, and then implying blanket
permission for faculty members to incite others to
engage in that same conduct.
Protected vs. Punishable Speech: Standards
We do, however, see every reason for taking care that
the standard for incitement is carefully drawn, with due
cognizance of those First Amendment protections that
apply to the relation between state and citizen. A wide
range of standards has been offered to us. At one
extreme, we were urged by counsel for Professor Frank

lin that no speech should be punished by the university,
regardless of its incitement to illegal acts. At the other,
we might have ruled sanctionable the advocacy of
vaguely-defined violent action proposed for some time in
the indefinite future. In ruling on the White Plaza and
Old Union speeches, we shall meet a standard suggested
by the Supreme Court decision discussed at length by
the parties in this case. The court in Brandenburg vs.
Ohio (395 US 444) held that to be punishable, advocacy
must "be directed to inciting or producing imminent
lawless action, and. . .likely to produce such action." A
vague exhortation is not punishable under such a stand
ard; on the other extreme it is clearly unreasonable to
demand, as did counsel for Professor Franklin, that there
be an exact correspondence between specific acts advo
cated and those that follow. Subsequent illegal acts arc
not in fact required for incitement to be punishable
under this standard. Such acts might, for example, have
been prevented by external circumstances, or illegal acts
might occur but differ from those advocated. Subse
quent acts are useful in determining the level and
character of risk that obtained at the time of the alleged
incitement. In judging the applicability of the standard
cited, the Board has been guided by the following
considerations:
a. What is the entire context surrounding the alleged
incitement, including the immediate risk of lawless
action?
b. What is specifically being communicated to the
audience?
c. What did the speaker intend? We judge intent on
the basis of the speaker's own knowledge of the
context for his speech, his awareness of the level of
the risk, and the words he actually used.
In the application of this standard, punishable advocacy
need not identify particular acts, but it must include
advocacy of lawless conduct. Inclusion of advocacy of
legal acts with advocacy of lawless conduct does not
immunize that advocacy from punishment. In the appli
cation of this standard to the campus, it is clear that
"lawless action" refers to acts against the law of the
campus, that is, to conduct proscribed by the Policy or
University regulations, or clearly prohibited under the
kind of common understanding of conduct discussed
above.
With respect to the Computation Center incident, the
Board has applied a different standard.Professor Frank
lin is charged with intentionally inciting students and
others to disregard and disobey a police order to dis
perse. If, knowing the risk, he increased the risk of
personal injury to other persons, some of whom were
unaware of the risk, then his conduct is punishable.
Incitement need not be directed to increasing the likeli
hood of illegal conduct; it may also be punishable if it
places persons at heightened physical risk, as with the
cry of "fire" in a crowded theatre. Such speech is clearly
not Constitutionally protected.
It may be argued that the university should allow
more scope than the Constitution, or the current de
mands of society, would require; indeed, it has been put
to us that the university should not undertake to restrain
speech at all. We believe the university's prohibition of
incitement, given the criteria of intent, risk and immi
nence discussed above, is fully justified when speech
threatens two central university interests: (1) protection
of members of the university community and university
facilities against risks of serious injury or damage; (2)
protection against coercive intrusion on the intellectual
transactions which the university seeks to foster.

We observe also that in taking this position we have
rejected a formulation urged upon us by a group of
intervening faculty. In their view, dismissal from a
tenured position is warranted only for "failure to per
form the duties for which one was hired-teaching,
and/or research. .or for previous conviction of "some
criminal act." We believe it is inappropriate to tie tenure
proceedings to the criminal process. The standard sug
gested by the interveners would, to be sure, relieve the
Board of the difficult obligation to construct a narrative
of disputed events as a basis for judgment. However
desirable that might be, we find it almost the only virtue
in their position. A criminal proceeding may require
several years to resolve, and it may terminate favorably
to the accused for reasons which have nothing to do
with a faculty member's fitness to retain his position. It
is not obvious why the university should be dependent
on external prosecution policy, which may respond to a
number of factors but which is unlikely to reflect any
sensitive judgment of university interests as a central
concern. It does seem clear that sound decisions, on the
issue ol penalty perhaps even more than on the issue of
culpability, under university standards, will require the
kind ol intimate familiarity with the facts of a case that
can be best provided by professional peers. On this basis,
the mere tact ol conviction of criminal offenses could be
a wholly insufficient guide to wise disposition within the
university.
Relation oj Speech to the Institution
Lastly, we turn to the circumstances under which
speech occurs, and to the relationship between those
circumstances and the 'duty' and 'appropriate function'
ol the speaker. Speech and conduct by faculty members
have in other cases been treated according to different
standards depending upon whether they were judged to
be connected with the faculty member's duties or
unrelated to them.
Professor Franklin has applied the term "extracurri
cular" to his speech at the two rallies. The Board cannot
agree with this use of the term, if by it Professor
Franklin intends to place the speeches in question
outside the framework of his duties and appropriate
function in the university. There is a degree of differ
ence, to be sure, bewteen speech in the classroom and
speech outside it; it may reasonably be held, for exam
ple, that explicit advocacy of a political position un
related to the subject matter of a course is improper
when delivered in front of a class, but is not when
delivered at a rally outside the classroom door. But that
view does not automatically remove all activities that
take place outside the classroom door from the reach of
institutional regulation. In a residential university, facul
ty members relate professionally to students in many
ways: in offices, at the dinner table, in informal advising
situations, and so on. These relationships certainly do
not resemble contacts between that faculty member and
citizens on a downtown street. We believe that the ,
speech of a faculty member to a campus audience on
campus issues is subject to regulations, though the
standard applied to it will be different from that applied
to a classroom situation. Indeed, the location of the
recommended target may equally serve to define speech
in relation to the institution: a faculty member inciting
an off-campus crowd to occupy a university building
illegally is, in our view, liable to institutional regulation.
We will now consider the specific charges in the light
of these standards.
Much attention has been paid by the parties to
'Constitutional' questions that may apply to the matter
before us. We here respond to that concern by treating
some of the major issues of this kind that have been
raised in argument and briefs by the parties.
"State Action"
Constitutional standards of due process and free
speech restrain the state. At one point in this proceeding
the University administration expressed the view that
disciplinary proceedings at a private institution are not
necessarily subject to Constitutional protections, while
Professor Franklin has responded that Stanford is in
substantial part publicly financed and publicly regulated
and that the Constitution is consequently as fully appli
cable to Stanford as to an agency of the state. The
merits of these two competing views aside, the Board
does not believe that the disagreement between them
focusses upon the important issues.
Tenure proceedings at all universities, private and
public, involve an attempt to abrogate permanence of
employment for cause.
Tenure, accurately and unequivocally defined, lays no
claim wiiatever to a guarantee of lifetime employ
ment. Rather, tenure provides only that no person
continuously retained as a full-time faculty member
beyond a specified lengthy period of probationary
service may thereafter be dismissed without adequate
cause. Moreover, the particular standards of'adequate
cause' to which the tenured faculty is accountable are
themselves wholly within the prerogative of each
university to determine through its own published
rules, save only that those rules not be applied in a
manner which violates the academic freedom or the
ordinary personal civil liberties of the individual. An
institution may provide for dismissal for 'adequate
cause' arising from failure to meet a specified norm of
performance or productivity, as well as from specified
acts of affirmative misconduct.. . .
. . .This accompanying complement of academic due
process merely establishes that a fairly rigorous pro
cedure will be observed whenever formal complaint is
made that dismissal is justified on some stated ground
of professional irresponsibility, to insure the fair
determination of three facts:
1. that the stated cause is the authentic cause for
dismissal, rather than a pretense or makeweight for
considerations invading the academic freedom or
ordinary personal civil liberties of the individual;
2. that the stated cause exists in fact;
3. that the degree of demonstrated professional
irresponsibility warrants outright termination of
the individual's appointment rather than some
lesser sanction, even after taking into account the
balance of his entire service and the personal
consequences of dismissal.
(Van Alstyne, N. Bulletin oj the American Asso
ciation of University Professors. Autumn. 1971)

Given the essentially identical character of the in
quiry in tenure cases, neither the standards of due
process nor the content of regulations covering speech
need differ between private and public institutions of
higher learning. It is open to a private university to
impose Constitutional limitations on itself as a deliberate
choice of policy; in advance of the hearing the Board
committed itself to at least this much in undertaking to
provide for Professor Franklin "no less protection oi his
Constitutional rights at Stanford than that to which he
would be entitled as a member of the faculty of a state
university." In the opinion of the Board the more
significant questions are: What are the Constitutional
boundaries? What should be the university's policies
beyind the minimum standards set by the Constitution?
We emphasize at the outset that we do not regard the
conduct described in the charges filed by the University
administration to be constitutionally protected against
University discipline. On the contrary, we consider such
conduct to be clearly within the reach of institutional
authority. The university charges that the two speeches
involve advocacy that is directed to inciting or producing
imminent lawless action, and likely to produce such
action. The charge on the Computation Center incident
deals with conduct which might unjustifiably increase
the risk of injury to others.
But this is not all that needs to be said about the
matter. Professor Franklin has also characterized as
"vague" and "overbroad" the charges made against him,
and also the standards set out in the Statement of Policy
on Appointment and Tenure ("substantial and manifest
incompetence, substantial and manifest neglect of duty,
or personal conduct substantially impairing the individ
ual's performance of his appropriate function within the
university community"). Prior to the hearing, the Board
rejected Professor Franklin's challenge on the vagueness
and overbreadth of the charges; at the same time, it
reserved its decision regarding the similar claims directed
to the underlying tenure regulations. The Board now
rejects these claims as well, for reasons we discuss below.
Vagueness and Overbreadth: The State Context
The term "overbreadth," as the parties agree, means
that a regulation encompasses both conduct which the
institution can legitimately prohibit, and conduct which
is Constitutionally protected against such prohibition,
'.e., speech of the sort shielded from governmental
estraints by the First Amendment. "Vagueness" is a
lifferent but related defect which leaves the meaning of
he regulation uncertain, in such a way that a member of
„n institution cannot reasonably judge what conduct is
prohibited and what conduct is permitted.
The simplest level at which an argument of over
breadth may be met is to ask whether the conduct for
which an individual is allegedly culpable under some
regulation is Constitutionally protected. If that were
found to be the case, then obviously the Constitution
would not allow the individual to be penalized under the
regulation because, no matter how precisely and clearly
its terms describe the conduct, the prohibition was
illegitimate under Constitutional provisions. Professor
rnnl'Hn mnlfltoinr -it flir* I pta'irrroc aOQinct

him deal with actions that are Constitutionally pro
tected. He goes further, however, to argue that even if
the Constitution would allow his prosecution for that
conduct in which he engaged, and even if that conduct
were clearly covered by the University's tenure regula
tion, that regulation is inapplicable to him simply be
cause of its overbreadth. This conclusion is argued from
the principle that society places a high value on the free
exercise of speech, and that it can tolerate no "chilling
effect" on this freedom. If a regulation covers both
permitted and prohibited conduct, then it may deter
others from exercising First Amendment rights which
fall under the improperly constructed portion of the
regulation's roof. Even a person guilty of legitimately
proscribable conduct may be rewarded for pointing out
the Constitutional infirmity of the regulation under
which he was prosecuted by relieving him of the con
sequences of his guilt. For the vice of overbreadth, the
institution is forced to invalidate the regulation over its
entire range of application, and to substitute for it a
more narrowly drawn regulation which will withstand
Constitutional scrutiny.
The vagueness doctrine, by contrast, is in substantial
part a canon of ordinary fairness. If a jurisdiction has
not identified a particular kind of conduct as subject to
punishment, it should not then be able to punish
perpetrators of such conduct. Vague regulations may
share some of the disadvantages of overbroad regula
tions, because their indefiniteness may overlap Constitu
tionally-guaranteed zones of activity and deter people
from doing what they have the right to do. Where
indefinite regulations are applied to speech, the vague
ness then invades an activity of such high social utility
that it claims special protection in the Constitution.
Again, it may be justifiable to reward persons who, while
knowingly engaging in activity that the institution may
legitimately proscribe, can show that the regulation is
vague at the border between punishable and protected
conduct. Like the transgressor who points out over
breadth, the identifier of vagueness—even though he
might be guilty under a properly drawn regulation
might receive a benefit for helping to thaw improperly
frozen expression.
Vague regulations introduce other difficulties as well
in a state context. The responsibility for drafting of
governing regulations rests with legislators who are ac
countable through political processes; when they enact a
vague statute, they shift responsibility for the law
making function onto the courts, who must take up the
legislator's abandoned obligations and give the statute
meaning in the course of applying it. Such a transfer of
responsibility might unduly disturb the balance of
powers among the branches of government. Further
more, the law enforcement authorities as well as the
courts have received the responsibility transferred by the
vague regulation, and may thereby he afforded unduly
wide discretion in the selection of whom to prosecute.
Obviously, such freedom might be exercised arbitrarily,
or for the purpose of retaliating against Constitutionally
protected activities. Finally, the adjudicating process
itsrlf (!•!• <T>ri v»v wwiie regulations: both the parties
and the decision maker are at a loss as to how to prepare
the case, what evidence to introduce, what arguments to
make, and what standards to use in deciding it.
Vagueness and Overbreadth: The University Context
These reflections on the briefs and arguments of the
parties regarding the doctrines of vagueness and over
breadth spell out certain problems, but hardly take us
directly to a resolution of the present issues. The legal
material pressed on us by the parties deals with problems
of vagueness and overbreadth in contexts which often
depart substantially from that applying in this case. It is
on this ground that we set aside the cases on student
discipline that both parties have reviewed for us in some
detail. Our examination of these cases persuades us that
the law in this field is incompletely settled; a rapid rate
of contemporary change has generated substantial dis
agreement and a conspicuously confused rationale.
There may be a trend toward enhanced protection, and
an employment of concepts of vagueness and over
breadth similar to those urged upon us by Professor
Franklin. But we recognize important differences in the
relationship between the institution and students, on the
one hand, the faculty, on the other. Students are much
more numerous; their time in the institution is shorter;
their fiscal relationaship with it is entirely different; and
a different tradition of academic freedom obtains. These
difficulties emphasize our conclusion that the problems
of vagueness and overbreadth, as well as other aspects of
the case, must be analyzed with due regard for the
framework—and the atmosphere-of the relation be
tween a faculty member and the University.
We may dispense quickly with two of the difficulties
engendered by vagueness. In some other procedural
system, vague regulations may produce problems in the
preparation, hearing and decision of the case, since none
of the participants can find his way in the fog created by
the lack of underlying standards. However, we consider
the charges in this case reasonably narrow and specific.
In our opinion, they are fully adequate to state an
intelligible conception of the case on the part of the
University administration, give Professor Franklin notice
of the conduct with which he is charged and enable him
to prepare and present his defense, and equip the Board
to shape the hearing and focus on commonly understood
issues. Beyond this, the Board afforded each party the
opportunity to obtain pre-hearing disclosure from the
other party of information and contentions relevant to
the case.
We also do not believe that the role of vague statutes
in unbalancing the separation of governmental processes
is one that need concern us in this situation. The faculty
of the university is a small community, characterized by
face-to-face contact and personal interaction. Legislation
proscribing conduct in a disciplinary context is rare;
when it occurs, it merely codifies previously shared
understandings. While there is clearly some allocation of
function as between faculty and administration, with
ultimate authority retained in the Board of Trustees as a
matter of legal right, interchanges and combinations of
roles are heavily involved in the actual governance of the
university. Faculty members relate to the institution
more through practice and informally negotiated con
sensus than through hierarchically codified rule. Rules of
conduct thus trace their source to slowly evolving
tradition rather than to abrupt acts of legislative inter
vention by persons in positions of formal authority.
Lack of centralization—often aided by small size and
extensive interaction—obviate for the university faculty
the need for the kind of detailed directions that guide
the armies of bureaucrats upon which larger organiza
tions often rely for administering centrally-determined
policies.
There remain the problems of fair warning, of over
breadth, and of undue discretion in enforcement.
Against the background of the relationship between
citizen and state, it is easy to make these issues appear
genuine and substantial. Plainly, it would be intolerable
for the state to provide that a citizen could be im
prisoned for "substantial and manifest incompetence,
substantial and manifest neglect of duty, or personal
conduct substantially impairing the individual's perfor
mance of his appropriate functions within the communi
ty." The situation is different, we believe, when the
public to which similar regulations are addressed is the
faculty of the university. In the more restricted setting,
the regulation invokes a web of largely unwritten rules as
tough and living as the British Constitution. Powerful
traditions, modified by contemporary practice, furnish a
reliable guide to faculty conduct, and entrust review
procedures to faculty peers-in this case, to a faculty
hearing board elected by the faculty. Nothing in those
traditions collides with Constitutionally guarded free
doms. On the contrary, it is the University's responsi
bility to enhance the exercise of rights of speech which
the First Amendment merely protects against govern
mental interference.
We would emphasize the meager record of the aca
demic community's experience with faculty discipline.
This may well be because faculty members chose their
profession in part because they embrace traditional
faculty norms, therefore performing willingly what writ
ten rules coerce in other systems. Indeed, the kind of
written rules contained in court decisions and codes are
not merely responses to the need for prior warning.
They are also the result of society's experience in
enforcing pre-existing norms against a partly recalcitrant
population—as suggested by the maxim that "ignorance
of the law is no excuse." The general practice of
conforming to norms may instruct individual faculty
members about those norms just as clearly as would
occasional cases of discipline for breach of standards.
This wide observance of the norms of faculty conduct
cannot disguise the fact of strong disagreement with
them among some faculty; dissent from a rule, or even
from the entire system of rules, obviously exists, and
must exist to furnish the motive power for necessary
change. But disagreement with a rule is not the same as
ignorance of its terms.
It is perhaps true that a fully-developed code would
be a more readily interprctable guide. But we believe
that the institution and its members would pay a heavy
price for such codification in terms of lost faculty
autonomy and initiative, and in over-bureaucratization.
This detriment should be carefully weighed before the
university accepts regulations spelled out in greater
detail. What we have called the web of unwritten rules of
faculty conduct is not clear or easy to apply in all cases;
on the contrary, there are borderline cases, and intracta
ble problems of application. But codified systems of
rules, too, are inevitably characterized by gaps and
conflicts—and suffer from certain pathologies precisely
because they are written. For example, rules designed to
protect speech by limiting other speech are double
edged; in either direction, they cut into regions that lie
under the protection o<*the First Amendment.

On balance, we favor the present reliance on largely
unwritten standards. But whatever the future holds in
this regard, we find the present understandings adequate
ly clear to guide faculty members in choosing among
various courses of action in particular situations.
Statement of Policy on Appointment and Tenure
The duties of a faculty member include, obviously,
specific teaching and scholarly obligations that are un
derstood primarily in terms of arrangements reached
voluntarily between the individual and his department or
some other institutional unit. Such obligations are gen
erally not spelled out in writing, perhaps because pro
fessors object to formal job descriptions. Nonetheless,
failure to meet commitments of this kind would clearly
constitute "substantial and manifest neglect of duty."
Similarly, "performance of his appropriate function in
the University" means the meeting of the full range of
agreed-upon institutional obligations. Professor Franklin,
in his final argument, characterizes the Statement of
Policy on Appointment and Tenure as being worded so
as to protect the performance of these positive obliga
tions—to enable the institution to weed out the demon
strably incompetent. But the unwritten understandings
discussed above give to the terms "duty" and "appro
priate function" a character of limitation as well as of
obligation. The fulfillment of a faculty member's duty
to his students and colleagues is understood to involve
an obligation to refrain from corrupting the intellectual
transactions that are the essence of the university, and
the other activities that support these. This does not, of
course, mean that he must exhibit political conformity
with the objectives of the institution; the university
must accommodate the questioning of contemporary
goals and structures, and must even tolerate the view
that the university, or the professoriate, should not
survive. There is positive benefit in having on the faculty
active representatives of political views that, while they
may be considered extreme or dissenting here, are held
by large numbers of people in the world and comprise a
dominant form of political organization in many places.
It seems likely that students can get a better education
about the nature of these ideas from proponents than
they can obtain through an exposure only to disengaged
analysts. Proponents are often also proselytizers: that
freedom should be granted also so long as its exercise
does not infringe upon the free choice of others. The
code of the institution does, however, demand that the
speech and conduct of a professor stay behind the line
of inciting or physically causing the impairment of the
institution's functions, especially its function as a forum
in which various other points of view can also be heard.
Policy on Campus Disruptions
The Policy on Campus Disruptions (hereafter called
the Policy) first appeared in 1965. It was a first attempt
to provide more detailed codification of conduct that
might be proscribed on the campus. The Policy was
clearly never intended to list all behavior that a faculty
member might engage in that was against university
policy; indeed, its original authors (the no-longer-extant
Committee on University Policy) did not even aim it
explicitly at faculty, so that it later had to be ratified by
the Academic Senate in 1968. That bit of legislative
history is interesting: although there was some debate
about a linked proposal concerning the judicial mechan
ism for dealing with faculty violators, no member of the
Senate offered dissent to a single substantive element of
the Policy. This episode shows, perhaps more clearly
than anything else, that the Policy was widely and
immediately accepted because it articulated some as
sumptions about appropriate conduct that most faculty
members heid in common.
Another way of illustrating this proposition is to
suppose that there were no Policy. Would the University
then be powerless to take action against a faculty
member for any of the acts described therein? In other
words, do we really insist on requiring that every
proscribed action be named in a document before we
place it on the other side of the line? The Board believes
that the answer to each of these questions is "no." We
have concluded above that there are common under
standings of appropriate faculty conduct, and that con
duct therefore exists which, even though it may not be
listed in an official policy, is nevertheless sanctionable.
With this background, we can consider the specific
conduct of the Policy. It lists several general positive
obligations:
a. to maintain "an atmosphere conducive to schol
arly pursuits"
b. "to preserve the dignity and seriousness of
University ceremonies and public exercises"
c. "to respect the rights of individuals"
The Policy also includes several specific areas of pro
scribed conduct:
a. "to prevent or disrupt the effective carrying out
of a University function or approved activity such
as lectures, meetings, [and] public events. ..
b. "to obstruct the legitimate movement of any
person about the campus or in any University
building or facility."
The Board believes that these provisions provide a clear
statement amplifying and defining some of the concepts
expressed more generally in the Statement of Policy on
Appointment and Tenure. Its applicability to faculty
members is beyond doubt.
Protected pi Punishable Speech: The Relation of the
Policy " to Incitement
We now turn to the fact that the Policy does not
specifically prohibit incitement. The failure to deal with
such speech is not, in the Board's view, the result of a
conscious decision to protect all speech. Rather, it is one
aspect of the history of the Policy, which was formu
lated quickly to meet a momentary need for the articula
tion of certain basic, commonly-held views. The Board
does not accept the argument that the Policy's omission
of a discussion of incitement automatically removes it
from prohibition.
In the Board's view, incitement to illegal conduct—as
we shall define it below-is an abuse of power. Such
abuse is a serious matter in a university, especially when
faculty members are addressing students. We see no
excuse for placing certain conduct beyond the law of the
campus, as the Policy does, and then implying blanket
permission for faculty members to incite others to
engage in that same conduct.
Protected vs. Punishable Speech: Standards
We do, however, see every reason for taking care that
the standard for incitement is carefully drawn, with due
cognizance of those First Amendment protections that
apply to the relation between state and citizen. A wide
range of standards has been offered to us. At one
extreme, we were urged by counsel for Professor Frank

lin that no speech should be punished by the university,
regardless of its incitement to illegal acts. At the other,
we might have ruled sanctionable the advocacy of
vaguely-defined violent action proposed for some time in
the indefinite future. In ruling on the White Plaza and
Old Union speeches, we shall meet a standard suggested
by the Supreme Court decision discussed at length by
the parties in this case. The court in Brandenburg vs.
Ohio (395 US 444) held that to be punishable, advocacy
must "be directed to inciting or producing imminent
lawless action, and. . .likely to produce such action." A
vague exhortation is not punishable under such a stand
ard; on the other extreme it is clearly unreasonable to
demand, as did counsel for Professor Franklin, that there
be an exact correspondence between specific acts advo
cated and those that follow. Subsequent illegal acts arc
not in fact required for incitement to be punishable
under this standard. Such acts might, for example, have
been prevented by external circumstances, or illegal acts
might occur but differ from those advocated. Subse
quent acts are useful in determining the level and
character of risk that obtained at the time of the alleged
incitement. In judging the applicability of the standard
cited, the Board has been guided by the following
considerations:
a. What is the entire context surrounding the alleged
incitement, including the immediate risk of lawless
action?
b. What is specifically being communicated to the
audience?
c. What did the speaker intend? We judge intent on
the basis of the speaker's own knowledge of the
context for his speech, his awareness of the level of
the risk, and the words he actually used.
In the application of this standard, punishable advocacy
need not identify particular acts, but it must include
advocacy of lawless conduct. Inclusion of advocacy of
legal acts with advocacy of lawless conduct does not
immunize that advocacy from punishment. In the appli
cation of this standard to the campus, it is clear that
"lawless action" refers to acts against the law of the
campus, that is, to conduct proscribed by the Policy or
University regulations, or clearly prohibited under the
kind of common understanding of conduct discussed
above.
With respect to the Computation Center incident, the
Board has applied a different standard.Professor Frank
lin is charged with intentionally inciting students and
others to disregard and disobey a police order to dis
perse. If, knowing the risk, he increased the risk of
personal injury to other persons, some of whom were
unaware of the risk, then his conduct is punishable.
Incitement need not be directed to increasing the likeli
hood of illegal conduct; it may also be punishable if it
places persons at heightened physical risk, as with the
cry of "fire" in a crowded theatre. Such speech is clearly
not Constitutionally protected.
It may be argued that the university should allow
more scope than the Constitution, or the current de
mands of society, would require; indeed, it has been put
to us that the university should not undertake to restrain
speech at all. We believe the university's prohibition of
incitement, given the criteria of intent, risk and immi
nence discussed above, is fully justified when speech
threatens two central university interests: (1) protection
of members of the university community and university
facilities against risks of serious injury or damage; (2)
protection against coercive intrusion on the intellectual
transactions which the university seeks to foster.

We observe also that in taking this position we have
rejected a formulation urged upon us by a group of
intervening faculty. In their view, dismissal from a
tenured position is warranted only for "failure to per
form the duties for which one was hired-teaching,
and/or research. .or for previous conviction of "some
criminal act." We believe it is inappropriate to tie tenure
proceedings to the criminal process. The standard sug
gested by the interveners would, to be sure, relieve the
Board of the difficult obligation to construct a narrative
of disputed events as a basis for judgment. However
desirable that might be, we find it almost the only virtue
in their position. A criminal proceeding may require
several years to resolve, and it may terminate favorably
to the accused for reasons which have nothing to do
with a faculty member's fitness to retain his position. It
is not obvious why the university should be dependent
on external prosecution policy, which may respond to a
number of factors but which is unlikely to reflect any
sensitive judgment of university interests as a central
concern. It does seem clear that sound decisions, on the
issue ol penalty perhaps even more than on the issue of
culpability, under university standards, will require the
kind ol intimate familiarity with the facts of a case that
can be best provided by professional peers. On this basis,
the mere tact ol conviction of criminal offenses could be
a wholly insufficient guide to wise disposition within the
university.
Relation oj Speech to the Institution
Lastly, we turn to the circumstances under which
speech occurs, and to the relationship between those
circumstances and the 'duty' and 'appropriate function'
ol the speaker. Speech and conduct by faculty members
have in other cases been treated according to different
standards depending upon whether they were judged to
be connected with the faculty member's duties or
unrelated to them.
Professor Franklin has applied the term "extracurri
cular" to his speech at the two rallies. The Board cannot
agree with this use of the term, if by it Professor
Franklin intends to place the speeches in question
outside the framework of his duties and appropriate
function in the university. There is a degree of differ
ence, to be sure, bewteen speech in the classroom and
speech outside it; it may reasonably be held, for exam
ple, that explicit advocacy of a political position un
related to the subject matter of a course is improper
when delivered in front of a class, but is not when
delivered at a rally outside the classroom door. But that
view does not automatically remove all activities that
take place outside the classroom door from the reach of
institutional regulation. In a residential university, facul
ty members relate professionally to students in many
ways: in offices, at the dinner table, in informal advising
situations, and so on. These relationships certainly do
not resemble contacts between that faculty member and
citizens on a downtown street. We believe that the ,
speech of a faculty member to a campus audience on
campus issues is subject to regulations, though the
standard applied to it will be different from that applied
to a classroom situation. Indeed, the location of the
recommended target may equally serve to define speech
in relation to the institution: a faculty member inciting
an off-campus crowd to occupy a university building
illegally is, in our view, liable to institutional regulation.
We will now consider the specific charges in the light
of these standards.
