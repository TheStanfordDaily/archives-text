# Discussion of Sanctions
## 
### 
A. INTRODUCTION
The University administration proposed in its state
ment of charges that Professor Franklin he dismissed,
and has argued in its response to Professor Franklin's
Motion to Dismiss Charges that dismissal would be the
appropriate penalty even if the Board sustained only one
of the last three charges (No.B—White Plaza Rally,
No.9—Computation Center Incident, No.lo—Old Union
Rally).
In the section on "Fundamental Issues and Stand
ards" of this report the Board has agreed that the pur
pose of academic due process is to establish:
1. That the stated cause is the authentic cause for dis
missal, rather than a pretense or makeweight for
considerations invading the academic freedom or or
dinary personal civil liberties of the individual;
2. that the stated cause exists in fact;
3. that the degree of demonstrated professional irres
ponsibility warrants outright termination of the indi
vidual's appointment rather than some lesser sanc
tion, even after taking into account the balance of his
entire service and the personal consequences of dis
missal.
(N. Van Alstyne, Bulletin of the American Associa
tion of University frofessors,Autumn, 1971)
In the preceding sections the Board has dealt with the
first two of these points; we now proceed to the con
tents of the third.
Professor Franklin's performance as a scholar and
teacher has not been questioned in these proceedings;
the Board ruled on this matter on October 28, 1971, in
its response to Professor Franklin's motion:
The Board requires no testimony supporting Profes
sor Franklin's exceptional competence as a scholar
and teacher His competence is not in question in this
hearing; the protections of tenure extend to all ten
ured faculty members without regard to judgments of
their relative merits.
The remaining question is thus one of appropriate
penalty, taking into account the Board's findings of fact,
the entire record, and the consequences of the sanctions
that might be imposed.
Beyond the Board's findings of fact, several elements
of the record in its entirety deserve consideration. First,
Professor Franklin is led into a pattern of conduct that
directly involves attacks upon the values of the univer
sity as now constituted, and also includes encourage
ment of violent or coercive tactics against the members
of the university community and the society of which it
is a part. Second, Professor Franklin has repeatedly
reminded the Board that he bases his actions upon a
different set of perceptions about the university and
society from those of the majority of Stanford faculty
members, including members of the Board. Such percep
tions of reality, and the convictions that emerge from
them, might provide an explanation for his conduct
which would assist the Board in its judgment. Third, the
rights of the university's entire membership not to be
disrupted by the unbridled exercise of self-proclaimed
moral conviction must be balanced against Professor
Franklin's right of political expression and action.
It is the need to balance these frequently conflicting

interests which underlies the determination of appropri
ate sanction.
B. PROFESSOR FRANKLIN S PATTERN OF
CONDUCT
From the viewpoint of most Stanford faculty mem
bers, who themselves are of course subject to limitations
of perception. Professor Franklin pursues a course of
action that seeks systematically to disrupt the normal
functioning of the university. Professor Franklin, on the
other hand, asserts that he is not trying to destroy the
institution, but to convert it to "serve the needs of the
people." Professor Franklin asserts that the university's
actual function is to serve as a training and research
center for the maintenance of an imperialistic hegemony
over the "Pacific Basin Empire;" yet to most of his
colleagues, that is a bizarre mischaracterization. Thus the
basis of a pattern of conduct is itself subject to con
flicting interpretations, depending upon the perception
of reality from which it is being described.
A major element in Professor Franklin's treatment of
issues in the university is an attempt to disembody the
institution from the human beings who make it up.
Characteristically, an instance of policy or action in one
area is identified and found to be unacceptable in some
respects; guilt is then globalized to the entire institution,
and it and its chief administrators are labeled as respon
sible in absolute terms. The dehumanizing process ex
tends to the treatment of the individuals so labeled: they
are characterized as "pigs," "fascists," "lackeys," and
the like.
The essential feature of the confrontation with the
institution involves a call to coercive or violent action,
based upon indignation generated by the particular issue
raised. In such calls, however, Professor Franklin has
been careful to limit his own role to that of advocate
rather than participant. He has said that he does not
wish to compromise his own position as a tenured mem
ber of the Stanford faculty, feeling that he is more
valuable to the "movement" because of that status than,
for example, is a student. For this reason he has stated
that he avoids participating directly in disruptions, illegal
occupations of buildings, and the like. For the same
reason one may presume that he also attempts to avoid
direct incitement; he does, however, acknowledge and
praise violent conduct when it is carried out by others—
as when lie says in his affidavit:
. . .1 have the right to voice public approval of the
fragging of officers in Vietnam and the breaking of
windows at Stanford University. In fact, I am
ashamed to admit that I have not engaged in any of
these activities, nor incited, counselled, advised or
urged others to do so. So I find myself in the
awkward position of defending myself against allega
tions of things which I have not done but perhaps I
should have done.
In this way, encouragement is given to persons who
share Professor Franklin's views about the nature of the
university to engage in illegal acts in which he is not
willing to engage. This influence extends not only to
members of the "movement," but also to non-members
who are in general sympathy with a number of the
