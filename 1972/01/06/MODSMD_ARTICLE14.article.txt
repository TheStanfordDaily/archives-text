# Discussion of Sanctions
## 
### 
A. INTRODUCTION
The University administration proposed in its state
ment of charges that Professor Franklin he dismissed,
and has argued in its response to Professor Franklin's
Motion to Dismiss Charges that dismissal would be the
appropriate penalty even if the Board sustained only one
of the last three charges (No.B—White Plaza Rally,
No.9—Computation Center Incident, No.lo—Old Union
Rally).
In the section on "Fundamental Issues and Stand
ards" of this report the Board has agreed that the pur
pose of academic due process is to establish:
1. That the stated cause is the authentic cause for dis
missal, rather than a pretense or makeweight for
considerations invading the academic freedom or or
dinary personal civil liberties of the individual;
2. that the stated cause exists in fact;
3. that the degree of demonstrated professional irres
ponsibility warrants outright termination of the indi
vidual's appointment rather than some lesser sanc
tion, even after taking into account the balance of his
entire service and the personal consequences of dis
missal.
(N. Van Alstyne, Bulletin of the American Associa
tion of University frofessors,Autumn, 1971)
In the preceding sections the Board has dealt with the
first two of these points; we now proceed to the con
tents of the third.
Professor Franklin's performance as a scholar and
teacher has not been questioned in these proceedings;
the Board ruled on this matter on October 28, 1971, in
its response to Professor Franklin's motion:
The Board requires no testimony supporting Profes
sor Franklin's exceptional competence as a scholar
and teacher His competence is not in question in this
hearing; the protections of tenure extend to all ten
ured faculty members without regard to judgments of
their relative merits.
The remaining question is thus one of appropriate
penalty, taking into account the Board's findings of fact,
the entire record, and the consequences of the sanctions
that might be imposed.
Beyond the Board's findings of fact, several elements
of the record in its entirety deserve consideration. First,
Professor Franklin is led into a pattern of conduct that
directly involves attacks upon the values of the univer
sity as now constituted, and also includes encourage
ment of violent or coercive tactics against the members
of the university community and the society of which it
is a part. Second, Professor Franklin has repeatedly
reminded the Board that he bases his actions upon a
different set of perceptions about the university and
society from those of the majority of Stanford faculty
members, including members of the Board. Such percep
tions of reality, and the convictions that emerge from
them, might provide an explanation for his conduct
which would assist the Board in its judgment. Third, the
rights of the university's entire membership not to be
disrupted by the unbridled exercise of self-proclaimed
moral conviction must be balanced against Professor
Franklin's right of political expression and action.
It is the need to balance these frequently conflicting

interests which underlies the determination of appropri
ate sanction.
B. PROFESSOR FRANKLIN S PATTERN OF
CONDUCT
From the viewpoint of most Stanford faculty mem
bers, who themselves are of course subject to limitations
of perception. Professor Franklin pursues a course of
action that seeks systematically to disrupt the normal
functioning of the university. Professor Franklin, on the
other hand, asserts that he is not trying to destroy the
institution, but to convert it to "serve the needs of the
people." Professor Franklin asserts that the university's
actual function is to serve as a training and research
center for the maintenance of an imperialistic hegemony
over the "Pacific Basin Empire;" yet to most of his
colleagues, that is a bizarre mischaracterization. Thus the
basis of a pattern of conduct is itself subject to con
flicting interpretations, depending upon the perception
of reality from which it is being described.
A major element in Professor Franklin's treatment of
issues in the university is an attempt to disembody the
institution from the human beings who make it up.
Characteristically, an instance of policy or action in one
area is identified and found to be unacceptable in some
respects; guilt is then globalized to the entire institution,
and it and its chief administrators are labeled as respon
sible in absolute terms. The dehumanizing process ex
tends to the treatment of the individuals so labeled: they
are characterized as "pigs," "fascists," "lackeys," and
the like.
The essential feature of the confrontation with the
institution involves a call to coercive or violent action,
based upon indignation generated by the particular issue
raised. In such calls, however, Professor Franklin has
been careful to limit his own role to that of advocate
rather than participant. He has said that he does not
wish to compromise his own position as a tenured mem
ber of the Stanford faculty, feeling that he is more
valuable to the "movement" because of that status than,
for example, is a student. For this reason he has stated
that he avoids participating directly in disruptions, illegal
occupations of buildings, and the like. For the same
reason one may presume that he also attempts to avoid
direct incitement; he does, however, acknowledge and
praise violent conduct when it is carried out by others—
as when lie says in his affidavit:
. . .1 have the right to voice public approval of the
fragging of officers in Vietnam and the breaking of
windows at Stanford University. In fact, I am
ashamed to admit that I have not engaged in any of
these activities, nor incited, counselled, advised or
urged others to do so. So I find myself in the
awkward position of defending myself against allega
tions of things which I have not done but perhaps I
should have done.
In this way, encouragement is given to persons who
share Professor Franklin's views about the nature of the
university to engage in illegal acts in which he is not
willing to engage. This influence extends not only to
members of the "movement," but also to non-members
who are in general sympathy with a number of the
causes for which Professor Franklin is an advocate. The
alleviation of poverty, an end to the war in Southeast
Asia, and more rapid progress toward social justice are
all goals with which the majority of Stanford students
and faculty members are in sympathy. In supporting
these causes from his particular political stance, Profes
sor Franklin forcefully remonstrates that the university
is a primary agent of injustice in order to focus protest
action on the university itself. To dramatize the institu
tion's complicity, a variety of immediate issues may
serve; these may present themselves as targets of oppor
tunity based on the vulnerability of the institution, on
the time scale of university decision-making, on adminis
trative errors, or on genuine failure on the part of the
university to do what it said it would or what it should
have done.
The events leading up to February 10th provide an
illustration of the use of a target of opportunity. The
running on the computer of an SRI program entitled
"Gamut-H", allegedly having direct application to am
phibious assault operations in the Vietnam war, was
coupled to the general mood of anger on the campus
about the Laotian invasion. Indeed it emerged in testi
mony that the local issue-Gamut-H—had been stored
for the tactically useful moment; it had been known to
members of the "movement," though apparently not to
Professor Franklin, for at least a week before the
Laotian invassion. The existence of that program was
proclaimed to be a major basis for selection of the
Computation Center as a target for occupation
although the urgency of the demands for remedial action
contrasted oddly with the fact that the "movement" had
been willing to introduce substantial delays while
seeking the tactically opportune moment for releasing its
information. The circumstances also reveal a typical fail
ure to use alternative, non-coercive channels for securing
the same objective. If a professor feels that such
channels are ineffective, he can be instrumental in
creating new means of legitimate problem-solving
withing the university. The violent episodes in which
Professor Franklin played a role represent by no means a
"last resort" effort after non-coercive possibilities have
been exhausted.
Even such a brief description as the above indicates
that the pattern of conduct of Professor Franklin and
other members of the "movement" contains paradoxical
elements that are subject to varying interpretations.
What may appear to his following to be a sincere con
cern with issues of domestic and international injustice
and a zeal to make the university more useful to society
will appear to others to be an instance of cynical mani
pulation to achieve ends—tactics that contrast vividly
with the ideals on behalf of which they are invoked.
Such a stance, in which a member of the faculty
wishes to encourage violence against the university but
also wishes to fall short of actual incitement to or
participation in such violence, leads inevitably to covert
or ambiguous recommendations. On the one hand, Pro
fessor Franklin attempts to stay on the permissible side
of conduct, in order to preserve his position; on the
other hand, he hopes that illegal acts will come about
and wants to do what he can within the law to encour
age them. Such tactics become particularly effective in
ecalating an already inflamed series of events.
The demonstrated existence of this pattern of con
duct could be used in either of two ways in constructing
an argument concerning penalty. His stated intention of
"going right up to the line" might be taken as evidence
of his awareness of that line, and his consequent deter
mination not to violate it. However, continuous probing
of the university's will to enforce its rules might lead to
a high likelihood of future transgressions, quite apart
form the Board's findings of fact on the current charges.
C. DIFFERING PERCEPTIONS OF REALITY
Balanced against this pattern of conduct, and in part
responsible for it, is a perception of reality which Profes
sor Franklin and his followers profess to share which
differs drastically from the consensus in the university.
In his opening argument Professor Franklin proclaimed
deep convictions about the evils of American foreign and
domestic policy and about the inevitable influences of
our socio-economic system in shaping that policy. Essen
tial to this perception is a mistrust of the allegedly
intricate interrelationship between the economic power
of American's "ruling class" and the maintenance of
policies that are imperialistic abroad and oppressive at
home. Of crucial importance in the present case is his
expressed view that the university, run by and for this
ruling class, possesses a substantial institutional guilt for
the ongoing prosecution of those policies. Consequently
he sees no way to disengage American foreign imperia
lism and domestic oppression from the impetus and
support given to those policies by the university.
The outcome of this perception of reality is a convic
tion that the situation must be radically changed-by
persuasion if that is possible and by violence if persua
sion is unavailing. The university becomes the most
immediate and obvious target for such action. Since
Professor Franklin maintains that the class interests of
those with power in the university make it inlikely that
they will engage in more than token gestures of reform,
he sees coercive tactics, which can include violence, as
most likely to produce the changes he desires.
In response to those who claim to abhor violence on
campus, Professor Franklin replies that the university, as
an integral part of the capitalistic system, is itself sys
tematically engaged in the support of violence-a vio
lence that is sometimes very open and apparent, as in
Vietnam or in police oppression in the ghettos, but is
often hidden yet none the less devastating in the econo
mic oppression that is exercised domestically against
minority groups and internationally against Third World
nations. Because of the university's complicity in this
range of violent activities. Professor Franklin maintains
that it is not only appropriate but necessary (taking
tactical considerations into account) to engage in such
acts of violence against the university as can lead it in
the direction of far-reaching reorganization, "to serve
the needs of the people" and not of the privileged few.
This results in the pattern of conduct described in the
preceding section.
Despite the strident, opportunistic, and aggressive be
havior which is in part caused by these perceptions, the
Board affirms that the university must not only tolerate,
but must actively foster, the widest range of opinions
possible. We realize that any perception of reality can be
challenged, stretched and revised by the competing views
with which it comes into vigorous contact and debate on
the university campus. We are committed to the princi
ple that in the competing marketplace of ideas truth can
make it without cheating that is, that in the competi
tion of conflicting perceptions of reality truth can sur
vive without resort to the stilling of dissent. We must
engage, and have tried to engage, in "the willing suspen
sion of disbelief," so as to enter as sympathetically as

possible into the perception of reality espoused by Pro
fessor Franklin. Such matters as conviction, motivation
and rationale are important determinants in the assess
ment of penalty, even though they may not enter direc
tly into findings of fact.
D. THE CONFLICTING RIGHTS
There are special reasons for the exercise of caution
in the application of sanctions in this case. First, loss of
tenure is at risk. We need hardly review here the signifi
cance of tenure; it is not merely a protection of the
individual against unwarranted attacks from the institu
tion from outside political forces. Tenure thus protects
freedom for the full range of scholarly inquiry, and both
the institution and the individual have a large stake in its
continued good health. At the same time, it exacts from
the tenured faculty member obligations of performance
and conduct.
Second, the impoverished state of "case law" for
academic proceedings of this sort gives great weight to
the outcome of the present case. There is much to be
said for caution in ground-breaking. Yet caution
demands regard both for the rights of the individual and
of the institution.
The rights of the individual must be balanced and
judged in relation to the rights of others having different
perceptions, and to the rights of the entire university
community to function and to survive as a center of
unregimented thought. However, the expression of
dee ply-held convictions of one who affirms a minority
perception of reality should not be denied merely be
cause the majority feels more comfortable when not
confronted by challenge.
In dealing with the rights of the institution, it must
be recognized that the university is not the all-powerful
monolith its attackers at times pretend it is. It is an
institution thriving on decentralized initiative, with a
central administration that has limited power but in
creasing responsibilities. There is a real danger that
ignoring the rights of the institution in order to safe
guard the rights of the individual faculty member may
have a result opposite from that intended: it may lead to
more attacks on the rights of other faculty members and
more, rather than less, concentration of administrative
authority. In a very real sense the university is the
totality of its constituents-damage suffered by the uni
versity works directly to the detriment of its individual
members.
There is thus a needed balance among three interests:
those of the faculty member accused, those of the other
members of the academic community, and those of the
university as an institution. But there is a fundamental
consequence of this balance of rights. While it is the
consensus within the university that it should have room
for the widest possible range of perceptions and expres
sion, the university says in fact to its members: "You
may preach and also practice.. .but only up to a certain
point."
The latter edict is not aimed exclusively at those on
the far political left, who often complain that they are
the only ones being discriminated against when told that
a theoretical espousal of their position is permitted so
long as it does not spill over into action. It is also applied
at many other points along the socio-politico-economic
spectrum within the academic community. For instance,
the university protects the right of a professor to
espouse views that suggest a demeaning relationship
between racial background and intelligence, but it would
not perrrut him to organize a forcible attempt to prevent
the Admissions Office from accepting black applicants.
It would allow a fascist professor to advocate abolition
of democratic processes, but would not let him interfere
with the conduct of university exercises dedicated
toward the exposition of democratic institutions.
Common to these examples is the institutional decision
that while those further toward the center of the politi
cal spectrum may practice what they preach, those at its
extremes may preach but are limited in their practice.
From Professor Franklin's viewpoint, this is an unfair
asymmetry. The majority of the community would
point out that in any even-handed balancing of rights,
the encouragement of violence constitutes an infringe
ment; to Professor Franklin the balancing of rights
appears insufficiently global. Because he makes the need
for incitement a political credo, a prosecution for the
advocacy of imminent lawless action becomes to him a
political persecution.
These descriptions do not solve the problem; they
only help to identity it. We cannot simultaneously re
dedicate the university to a specific political goal—by
using force or violence if necessary—and at the same
time preserve it as an institution in which independent
initiative from many quarters can have the widest possi
ble play. A choice must be made and we choose the
latter. Yet having made this choice, the university can
contemplate punishment of action—and most especially,
of speech—only when the rights claimed by the dissi
dents seriously infringe those of other groups or individ
uals within the university. Punishment should follow
only when strongly persuasive evidence has been devel
oped that such infringement has actually occured.
E. GUIDELINES FOR SEVERITY OF SANCTION
1. Modifying Circumstances. On the basis of the
above considerations we are prepared to consider as
mitigating issues of motivation, overriding necessity, and
a variety of factors that may be understandable within
Professor Franklin's framework of convictions but not
within our own or those of most of our colleagues. At
the same time we are prepared to consider as justifica
tion for a relatively more severe penality a pattern of
conduct which systematically threatens the university as
an institution in which decentralized individual initiative
can have the widest possible range.
However, within this balanced input we believe that,
in case of doubt, those criteria that are external to the
factual fabric of the charges should be applied asym
metrically in favor of the defendent, since (1) such
matters were not taken into account in findings of fact,
(2) the perceptions of reality held by the Board are
generally more shared with those of the Administration
than with those of Professor Franklin.
2. The Purpose of Sanction. The purpose of sanction
can be to retaliate, to rehabilitate, or to deter further
violations. We hope that in a university setting only the
last two deserve consideration; and we must ask what
importance to attach to each.
We are highly dubious whether rehabilitation is a
useful concept in this case. Professor Franklin's an
nounced convictions about the guilt of the university
appear deeply-held, and his opposition to the institution
in its present form seems implacable. We believe him
when he expresses his regret that his role in converting
the university to "serve the people" is restricted by
practical reasons to advocacy rather than action. "Re
habilitation" might appear to Professor Franklin as a
highly unfair mandate to change his convictions. Barring

a dramatic change in perception he is unlikely to change
his conduct; thus "rehabilitation" is likely to fail, what
ever the sanction.
It can be argued in contrast that the deterring func
tion of penalty has real force. By setting a price on
proscribed conduct, the university can make its members
consider carefully the line that separates forbidden from
permitted speech and action, and avoid crossing that
line. In establishing a penalty, the institution in effect
announces the degree to which it is attached to its own
values. Such an announcement insists that persons con
sidering borderline conduct must locate the border; for
wnen there is no deterrent to illegal acts, it hardly pays
to have a law.
3. The Range of Possible Sanctions. Dismissal severs
the connection between the defendant and the institu
tion; a lesser sanction assumes that a satisfactory rela
tionship between Professor Franklin and the other mem
bers of the university can be re-established. In consider
ing the appropriateness of a lesser penalty, we must thus
consider (! ) whether it will actually deter, and whether
deterrence is a reasonable expectation at all; (2) whether
it appropriately announces the institution's attachment
to the value measured.
There is no absolute way of defining the deterrent
value of penalty. Some professions (and some people)
are especially sensitive to economic sanctions, others to
censure. If that proposition is granted, a certain finding
of fact can still justify a range of penalties that differ in
kind as well as in severity. Between mere censure and
dismissal there is an intermediate range of possible sanc
tions that is populated primarily by such mechanisms as
suspension (with or without pay) and probation.
We do not hold probation to be workable. Where
such a right as tenure is involved, probation merely
challenges it authenticity; and probation is too often an

excuse for the removal of due process. Suspension is
another matter, and encompasses three kinds of sanc
tion. There is, first, the loss of privilege-to teach and to
use the full range of the academy's resources. Professor
Franklin has already suffered -irreversibly-the penalty
of suspension with pay since February 12, 1971; this is a
long time, although he has contributed substantially to
its length. Second, suspension may also involve loss of
salary. Finally, the imposition of any penalty, suspen
sion included, produces a subtle but real change in
professional status. Sanction imposed by a council of his
peers would surely detract from the offender's standing
in the academic community at large.
For all these reasons suspension without pay ranging
from one quarter upward is a substantial penalty—in
terms of financial cost, in terms of lost academic partici
pation, and in terms of lowered professional status and
consequent loss of mobility. Suspension of too great a
lenght is not practicable, because at some point the
defendent—whom we must assume to be economically
vulnerable-becomes likely to be forced into irreversible
occupational alternatives.
Dismissal is a penalty of undoubted severity because
of its absolute effect upon the immediate institutional
relationship combined with its impact upon employment
opportunities elsewhere within and even outside the
profession. The severity of dismissal as a penalty can be
softened somewhat by a financial settlement which
would permit time for the exploration of alternatives.
The more severe penalties are not in our view in
appropriately matched to the gravity of the charges.
Incitement to violent, coercive, lawless action—however
it may be modified in final judgment by any of the
factors discusses above—is a heavy attack upon the insti
tution of which Professor Franklin is a member.
A. INTRODUCTION
The University administration proposed in its state
ment of charges that Professor Franklin he dismissed,
and has argued in its response to Professor Franklin's
Motion to Dismiss Charges that dismissal would be the
appropriate penalty even if the Board sustained only one
of the last three charges (No.B—White Plaza Rally,
No.9—Computation Center Incident, No.lo—Old Union
Rally).
In the section on "Fundamental Issues and Stand
ards" of this report the Board has agreed that the pur
pose of academic due process is to establish:
1. That the stated cause is the authentic cause for dis
missal, rather than a pretense or makeweight for
considerations invading the academic freedom or or
dinary personal civil liberties of the individual;
2. that the stated cause exists in fact;
3. that the degree of demonstrated professional irres
ponsibility warrants outright termination of the indi
vidual's appointment rather than some lesser sanc
tion, even after taking into account the balance of his
entire service and the personal consequences of dis
missal.
(N. Van Alstyne, Bulletin of the American Associa
tion of University frofessors,Autumn, 1971)
In the preceding sections the Board has dealt with the
first two of these points; we now proceed to the con
tents of the third.
Professor Franklin's performance as a scholar and
teacher has not been questioned in these proceedings;
the Board ruled on this matter on October 28, 1971, in
its response to Professor Franklin's motion:
The Board requires no testimony supporting Profes
sor Franklin's exceptional competence as a scholar
and teacher His competence is not in question in this
hearing; the protections of tenure extend to all ten
ured faculty members without regard to judgments of
their relative merits.
The remaining question is thus one of appropriate
penalty, taking into account the Board's findings of fact,
the entire record, and the consequences of the sanctions
that might be imposed.
Beyond the Board's findings of fact, several elements
of the record in its entirety deserve consideration. First,
Professor Franklin is led into a pattern of conduct that
directly involves attacks upon the values of the univer
sity as now constituted, and also includes encourage
ment of violent or coercive tactics against the members
of the university community and the society of which it
is a part. Second, Professor Franklin has repeatedly
reminded the Board that he bases his actions upon a
different set of perceptions about the university and
society from those of the majority of Stanford faculty
members, including members of the Board. Such percep
tions of reality, and the convictions that emerge from
them, might provide an explanation for his conduct
which would assist the Board in its judgment. Third, the
rights of the university's entire membership not to be
disrupted by the unbridled exercise of self-proclaimed
moral conviction must be balanced against Professor
Franklin's right of political expression and action.
It is the need to balance these frequently conflicting

interests which underlies the determination of appropri
ate sanction.
B. PROFESSOR FRANKLIN S PATTERN OF
CONDUCT
From the viewpoint of most Stanford faculty mem
bers, who themselves are of course subject to limitations
of perception. Professor Franklin pursues a course of
action that seeks systematically to disrupt the normal
functioning of the university. Professor Franklin, on the
other hand, asserts that he is not trying to destroy the
institution, but to convert it to "serve the needs of the
people." Professor Franklin asserts that the university's
actual function is to serve as a training and research
center for the maintenance of an imperialistic hegemony
over the "Pacific Basin Empire;" yet to most of his
colleagues, that is a bizarre mischaracterization. Thus the
basis of a pattern of conduct is itself subject to con
flicting interpretations, depending upon the perception
of reality from which it is being described.
A major element in Professor Franklin's treatment of
issues in the university is an attempt to disembody the
institution from the human beings who make it up.
Characteristically, an instance of policy or action in one
area is identified and found to be unacceptable in some
respects; guilt is then globalized to the entire institution,
and it and its chief administrators are labeled as respon
sible in absolute terms. The dehumanizing process ex
tends to the treatment of the individuals so labeled: they
are characterized as "pigs," "fascists," "lackeys," and
the like.
The essential feature of the confrontation with the
institution involves a call to coercive or violent action,
based upon indignation generated by the particular issue
raised. In such calls, however, Professor Franklin has
been careful to limit his own role to that of advocate
rather than participant. He has said that he does not
wish to compromise his own position as a tenured mem
ber of the Stanford faculty, feeling that he is more
valuable to the "movement" because of that status than,
for example, is a student. For this reason he has stated
that he avoids participating directly in disruptions, illegal
occupations of buildings, and the like. For the same
reason one may presume that he also attempts to avoid
direct incitement; he does, however, acknowledge and
praise violent conduct when it is carried out by others—
as when lie says in his affidavit:
. . .1 have the right to voice public approval of the
fragging of officers in Vietnam and the breaking of
windows at Stanford University. In fact, I am
ashamed to admit that I have not engaged in any of
these activities, nor incited, counselled, advised or
urged others to do so. So I find myself in the
awkward position of defending myself against allega
tions of things which I have not done but perhaps I
should have done.
In this way, encouragement is given to persons who
share Professor Franklin's views about the nature of the
university to engage in illegal acts in which he is not
willing to engage. This influence extends not only to
members of the "movement," but also to non-members
who are in general sympathy with a number of the
causes for which Professor Franklin is an advocate. The
alleviation of poverty, an end to the war in Southeast
Asia, and more rapid progress toward social justice are
all goals with which the majority of Stanford students
and faculty members are in sympathy. In supporting
these causes from his particular political stance, Profes
sor Franklin forcefully remonstrates that the university
is a primary agent of injustice in order to focus protest
action on the university itself. To dramatize the institu
tion's complicity, a variety of immediate issues may
serve; these may present themselves as targets of oppor
tunity based on the vulnerability of the institution, on
the time scale of university decision-making, on adminis
trative errors, or on genuine failure on the part of the
university to do what it said it would or what it should
have done.
The events leading up to February 10th provide an
illustration of the use of a target of opportunity. The
running on the computer of an SRI program entitled
"Gamut-H", allegedly having direct application to am
phibious assault operations in the Vietnam war, was
coupled to the general mood of anger on the campus
about the Laotian invasion. Indeed it emerged in testi
mony that the local issue-Gamut-H—had been stored
for the tactically useful moment; it had been known to
members of the "movement," though apparently not to
Professor Franklin, for at least a week before the
Laotian invassion. The existence of that program was
proclaimed to be a major basis for selection of the
Computation Center as a target for occupation
although the urgency of the demands for remedial action
contrasted oddly with the fact that the "movement" had
been willing to introduce substantial delays while
seeking the tactically opportune moment for releasing its
information. The circumstances also reveal a typical fail
ure to use alternative, non-coercive channels for securing
the same objective. If a professor feels that such
channels are ineffective, he can be instrumental in
creating new means of legitimate problem-solving
withing the university. The violent episodes in which
Professor Franklin played a role represent by no means a
"last resort" effort after non-coercive possibilities have
been exhausted.
Even such a brief description as the above indicates
that the pattern of conduct of Professor Franklin and
other members of the "movement" contains paradoxical
elements that are subject to varying interpretations.
What may appear to his following to be a sincere con
cern with issues of domestic and international injustice
and a zeal to make the university more useful to society
will appear to others to be an instance of cynical mani
pulation to achieve ends—tactics that contrast vividly
with the ideals on behalf of which they are invoked.
Such a stance, in which a member of the faculty
wishes to encourage violence against the university but
also wishes to fall short of actual incitement to or
participation in such violence, leads inevitably to covert
or ambiguous recommendations. On the one hand, Pro
fessor Franklin attempts to stay on the permissible side
of conduct, in order to preserve his position; on the
other hand, he hopes that illegal acts will come about
and wants to do what he can within the law to encour
age them. Such tactics become particularly effective in
ecalating an already inflamed series of events.
The demonstrated existence of this pattern of con
duct could be used in either of two ways in constructing
an argument concerning penalty. His stated intention of
"going right up to the line" might be taken as evidence
of his awareness of that line, and his consequent deter
mination not to violate it. However, continuous probing
of the university's will to enforce its rules might lead to
a high likelihood of future transgressions, quite apart
form the Board's findings of fact on the current charges.
C. DIFFERING PERCEPTIONS OF REALITY
Balanced against this pattern of conduct, and in part
responsible for it, is a perception of reality which Profes
sor Franklin and his followers profess to share which
differs drastically from the consensus in the university.
In his opening argument Professor Franklin proclaimed
deep convictions about the evils of American foreign and
domestic policy and about the inevitable influences of
our socio-economic system in shaping that policy. Essen
tial to this perception is a mistrust of the allegedly
intricate interrelationship between the economic power
of American's "ruling class" and the maintenance of
policies that are imperialistic abroad and oppressive at
home. Of crucial importance in the present case is his
expressed view that the university, run by and for this
ruling class, possesses a substantial institutional guilt for
the ongoing prosecution of those policies. Consequently
he sees no way to disengage American foreign imperia
lism and domestic oppression from the impetus and
support given to those policies by the university.
The outcome of this perception of reality is a convic
tion that the situation must be radically changed-by
persuasion if that is possible and by violence if persua
sion is unavailing. The university becomes the most
immediate and obvious target for such action. Since
Professor Franklin maintains that the class interests of
those with power in the university make it inlikely that
they will engage in more than token gestures of reform,
he sees coercive tactics, which can include violence, as
most likely to produce the changes he desires.
In response to those who claim to abhor violence on
campus, Professor Franklin replies that the university, as
an integral part of the capitalistic system, is itself sys
tematically engaged in the support of violence-a vio
lence that is sometimes very open and apparent, as in
Vietnam or in police oppression in the ghettos, but is
often hidden yet none the less devastating in the econo
mic oppression that is exercised domestically against
minority groups and internationally against Third World
nations. Because of the university's complicity in this
range of violent activities. Professor Franklin maintains
that it is not only appropriate but necessary (taking
tactical considerations into account) to engage in such
acts of violence against the university as can lead it in
the direction of far-reaching reorganization, "to serve
the needs of the people" and not of the privileged few.
This results in the pattern of conduct described in the
preceding section.
Despite the strident, opportunistic, and aggressive be
havior which is in part caused by these perceptions, the
Board affirms that the university must not only tolerate,
but must actively foster, the widest range of opinions
possible. We realize that any perception of reality can be
challenged, stretched and revised by the competing views
with which it comes into vigorous contact and debate on
the university campus. We are committed to the princi
ple that in the competing marketplace of ideas truth can
make it without cheating that is, that in the competi
tion of conflicting perceptions of reality truth can sur
vive without resort to the stilling of dissent. We must
engage, and have tried to engage, in "the willing suspen
sion of disbelief," so as to enter as sympathetically as

possible into the perception of reality espoused by Pro
fessor Franklin. Such matters as conviction, motivation
and rationale are important determinants in the assess
ment of penalty, even though they may not enter direc
tly into findings of fact.
D. THE CONFLICTING RIGHTS
There are special reasons for the exercise of caution
in the application of sanctions in this case. First, loss of
tenure is at risk. We need hardly review here the signifi
cance of tenure; it is not merely a protection of the
individual against unwarranted attacks from the institu
tion from outside political forces. Tenure thus protects
freedom for the full range of scholarly inquiry, and both
the institution and the individual have a large stake in its
continued good health. At the same time, it exacts from
the tenured faculty member obligations of performance
and conduct.
Second, the impoverished state of "case law" for
academic proceedings of this sort gives great weight to
the outcome of the present case. There is much to be
said for caution in ground-breaking. Yet caution
demands regard both for the rights of the individual and
of the institution.
The rights of the individual must be balanced and
judged in relation to the rights of others having different
perceptions, and to the rights of the entire university
community to function and to survive as a center of
unregimented thought. However, the expression of
dee ply-held convictions of one who affirms a minority
perception of reality should not be denied merely be
cause the majority feels more comfortable when not
confronted by challenge.
In dealing with the rights of the institution, it must
be recognized that the university is not the all-powerful
monolith its attackers at times pretend it is. It is an
institution thriving on decentralized initiative, with a
central administration that has limited power but in
creasing responsibilities. There is a real danger that
ignoring the rights of the institution in order to safe
guard the rights of the individual faculty member may
have a result opposite from that intended: it may lead to
more attacks on the rights of other faculty members and
more, rather than less, concentration of administrative
authority. In a very real sense the university is the
totality of its constituents-damage suffered by the uni
versity works directly to the detriment of its individual
members.
There is thus a needed balance among three interests:
those of the faculty member accused, those of the other
members of the academic community, and those of the
university as an institution. But there is a fundamental
consequence of this balance of rights. While it is the
consensus within the university that it should have room
for the widest possible range of perceptions and expres
sion, the university says in fact to its members: "You
may preach and also practice.. .but only up to a certain
point."
The latter edict is not aimed exclusively at those on
the far political left, who often complain that they are
the only ones being discriminated against when told that
a theoretical espousal of their position is permitted so
long as it does not spill over into action. It is also applied
at many other points along the socio-politico-economic
spectrum within the academic community. For instance,
the university protects the right of a professor to
espouse views that suggest a demeaning relationship
between racial background and intelligence, but it would
not perrrut him to organize a forcible attempt to prevent
the Admissions Office from accepting black applicants.
It would allow a fascist professor to advocate abolition
of democratic processes, but would not let him interfere
with the conduct of university exercises dedicated
toward the exposition of democratic institutions.
Common to these examples is the institutional decision
that while those further toward the center of the politi
cal spectrum may practice what they preach, those at its
extremes may preach but are limited in their practice.
From Professor Franklin's viewpoint, this is an unfair
asymmetry. The majority of the community would
point out that in any even-handed balancing of rights,
the encouragement of violence constitutes an infringe
ment; to Professor Franklin the balancing of rights
appears insufficiently global. Because he makes the need
for incitement a political credo, a prosecution for the
advocacy of imminent lawless action becomes to him a
political persecution.
These descriptions do not solve the problem; they
only help to identity it. We cannot simultaneously re
dedicate the university to a specific political goal—by
using force or violence if necessary—and at the same
time preserve it as an institution in which independent
initiative from many quarters can have the widest possi
ble play. A choice must be made and we choose the
latter. Yet having made this choice, the university can
contemplate punishment of action—and most especially,
of speech—only when the rights claimed by the dissi
dents seriously infringe those of other groups or individ
uals within the university. Punishment should follow
only when strongly persuasive evidence has been devel
oped that such infringement has actually occured.
E. GUIDELINES FOR SEVERITY OF SANCTION
1. Modifying Circumstances. On the basis of the
above considerations we are prepared to consider as
mitigating issues of motivation, overriding necessity, and
a variety of factors that may be understandable within
Professor Franklin's framework of convictions but not
within our own or those of most of our colleagues. At
the same time we are prepared to consider as justifica
tion for a relatively more severe penality a pattern of
conduct which systematically threatens the university as
an institution in which decentralized individual initiative
can have the widest possible range.
However, within this balanced input we believe that,
in case of doubt, those criteria that are external to the
factual fabric of the charges should be applied asym
metrically in favor of the defendent, since (1) such
matters were not taken into account in findings of fact,
(2) the perceptions of reality held by the Board are
generally more shared with those of the Administration
than with those of Professor Franklin.
2. The Purpose of Sanction. The purpose of sanction
can be to retaliate, to rehabilitate, or to deter further
violations. We hope that in a university setting only the
last two deserve consideration; and we must ask what
importance to attach to each.
We are highly dubious whether rehabilitation is a
useful concept in this case. Professor Franklin's an
nounced convictions about the guilt of the university
appear deeply-held, and his opposition to the institution
in its present form seems implacable. We believe him
when he expresses his regret that his role in converting
the university to "serve the people" is restricted by
practical reasons to advocacy rather than action. "Re
habilitation" might appear to Professor Franklin as a
highly unfair mandate to change his convictions. Barring

a dramatic change in perception he is unlikely to change
his conduct; thus "rehabilitation" is likely to fail, what
ever the sanction.
It can be argued in contrast that the deterring func
tion of penalty has real force. By setting a price on
proscribed conduct, the university can make its members
consider carefully the line that separates forbidden from
permitted speech and action, and avoid crossing that
line. In establishing a penalty, the institution in effect
announces the degree to which it is attached to its own
values. Such an announcement insists that persons con
sidering borderline conduct must locate the border; for
wnen there is no deterrent to illegal acts, it hardly pays
to have a law.
3. The Range of Possible Sanctions. Dismissal severs
the connection between the defendant and the institu
tion; a lesser sanction assumes that a satisfactory rela
tionship between Professor Franklin and the other mem
bers of the university can be re-established. In consider
ing the appropriateness of a lesser penalty, we must thus
consider (! ) whether it will actually deter, and whether
deterrence is a reasonable expectation at all; (2) whether
it appropriately announces the institution's attachment
to the value measured.
There is no absolute way of defining the deterrent
value of penalty. Some professions (and some people)
are especially sensitive to economic sanctions, others to
censure. If that proposition is granted, a certain finding
of fact can still justify a range of penalties that differ in
kind as well as in severity. Between mere censure and
dismissal there is an intermediate range of possible sanc
tions that is populated primarily by such mechanisms as
suspension (with or without pay) and probation.
We do not hold probation to be workable. Where
such a right as tenure is involved, probation merely
challenges it authenticity; and probation is too often an

excuse for the removal of due process. Suspension is
another matter, and encompasses three kinds of sanc
tion. There is, first, the loss of privilege-to teach and to
use the full range of the academy's resources. Professor
Franklin has already suffered -irreversibly-the penalty
of suspension with pay since February 12, 1971; this is a
long time, although he has contributed substantially to
its length. Second, suspension may also involve loss of
salary. Finally, the imposition of any penalty, suspen
sion included, produces a subtle but real change in
professional status. Sanction imposed by a council of his
peers would surely detract from the offender's standing
in the academic community at large.
For all these reasons suspension without pay ranging
from one quarter upward is a substantial penalty—in
terms of financial cost, in terms of lost academic partici
pation, and in terms of lowered professional status and
consequent loss of mobility. Suspension of too great a
lenght is not practicable, because at some point the
defendent—whom we must assume to be economically
vulnerable-becomes likely to be forced into irreversible
occupational alternatives.
Dismissal is a penalty of undoubted severity because
of its absolute effect upon the immediate institutional
relationship combined with its impact upon employment
opportunities elsewhere within and even outside the
profession. The severity of dismissal as a penalty can be
softened somewhat by a financial settlement which
would permit time for the exploration of alternatives.
The more severe penalties are not in our view in
appropriately matched to the gravity of the charges.
Incitement to violent, coercive, lawless action—however
it may be modified in final judgment by any of the
factors discusses above—is a heavy attack upon the insti
tution of which Professor Franklin is a member.
A. INTRODUCTION
The University administration proposed in its state
ment of charges that Professor Franklin he dismissed,
and has argued in its response to Professor Franklin's
Motion to Dismiss Charges that dismissal would be the
appropriate penalty even if the Board sustained only one
of the last three charges (No.B—White Plaza Rally,
No.9—Computation Center Incident, No.lo—Old Union
Rally).
In the section on "Fundamental Issues and Stand
ards" of this report the Board has agreed that the pur
pose of academic due process is to establish:
1. That the stated cause is the authentic cause for dis
missal, rather than a pretense or makeweight for
considerations invading the academic freedom or or
dinary personal civil liberties of the individual;
2. that the stated cause exists in fact;
3. that the degree of demonstrated professional irres
ponsibility warrants outright termination of the indi
vidual's appointment rather than some lesser sanc
tion, even after taking into account the balance of his
entire service and the personal consequences of dis
missal.
(N. Van Alstyne, Bulletin of the American Associa
tion of University frofessors,Autumn, 1971)
In the preceding sections the Board has dealt with the
first two of these points; we now proceed to the con
tents of the third.
Professor Franklin's performance as a scholar and
teacher has not been questioned in these proceedings;
the Board ruled on this matter on October 28, 1971, in
its response to Professor Franklin's motion:
The Board requires no testimony supporting Profes
sor Franklin's exceptional competence as a scholar
and teacher His competence is not in question in this
hearing; the protections of tenure extend to all ten
ured faculty members without regard to judgments of
their relative merits.
The remaining question is thus one of appropriate
penalty, taking into account the Board's findings of fact,
the entire record, and the consequences of the sanctions
that might be imposed.
Beyond the Board's findings of fact, several elements
of the record in its entirety deserve consideration. First,
Professor Franklin is led into a pattern of conduct that
directly involves attacks upon the values of the univer
sity as now constituted, and also includes encourage
ment of violent or coercive tactics against the members
of the university community and the society of which it
is a part. Second, Professor Franklin has repeatedly
reminded the Board that he bases his actions upon a
different set of perceptions about the university and
society from those of the majority of Stanford faculty
members, including members of the Board. Such percep
tions of reality, and the convictions that emerge from
them, might provide an explanation for his conduct
which would assist the Board in its judgment. Third, the
rights of the university's entire membership not to be
disrupted by the unbridled exercise of self-proclaimed
moral conviction must be balanced against Professor
Franklin's right of political expression and action.
It is the need to balance these frequently conflicting

interests which underlies the determination of appropri
ate sanction.
B. PROFESSOR FRANKLIN S PATTERN OF
CONDUCT
From the viewpoint of most Stanford faculty mem
bers, who themselves are of course subject to limitations
of perception. Professor Franklin pursues a course of
action that seeks systematically to disrupt the normal
functioning of the university. Professor Franklin, on the
other hand, asserts that he is not trying to destroy the
institution, but to convert it to "serve the needs of the
people." Professor Franklin asserts that the university's
actual function is to serve as a training and research
center for the maintenance of an imperialistic hegemony
over the "Pacific Basin Empire;" yet to most of his
colleagues, that is a bizarre mischaracterization. Thus the
basis of a pattern of conduct is itself subject to con
flicting interpretations, depending upon the perception
of reality from which it is being described.
A major element in Professor Franklin's treatment of
issues in the university is an attempt to disembody the
institution from the human beings who make it up.
Characteristically, an instance of policy or action in one
area is identified and found to be unacceptable in some
respects; guilt is then globalized to the entire institution,
and it and its chief administrators are labeled as respon
sible in absolute terms. The dehumanizing process ex
tends to the treatment of the individuals so labeled: they
are characterized as "pigs," "fascists," "lackeys," and
the like.
The essential feature of the confrontation with the
institution involves a call to coercive or violent action,
based upon indignation generated by the particular issue
raised. In such calls, however, Professor Franklin has
been careful to limit his own role to that of advocate
rather than participant. He has said that he does not
wish to compromise his own position as a tenured mem
ber of the Stanford faculty, feeling that he is more
valuable to the "movement" because of that status than,
for example, is a student. For this reason he has stated
that he avoids participating directly in disruptions, illegal
occupations of buildings, and the like. For the same
reason one may presume that he also attempts to avoid
direct incitement; he does, however, acknowledge and
praise violent conduct when it is carried out by others—
as when lie says in his affidavit:
. . .1 have the right to voice public approval of the
fragging of officers in Vietnam and the breaking of
windows at Stanford University. In fact, I am
ashamed to admit that I have not engaged in any of
these activities, nor incited, counselled, advised or
urged others to do so. So I find myself in the
awkward position of defending myself against allega
tions of things which I have not done but perhaps I
should have done.
In this way, encouragement is given to persons who
share Professor Franklin's views about the nature of the
university to engage in illegal acts in which he is not
willing to engage. This influence extends not only to
members of the "movement," but also to non-members
who are in general sympathy with a number of the
causes for which Professor Franklin is an advocate. The
alleviation of poverty, an end to the war in Southeast
Asia, and more rapid progress toward social justice are
all goals with which the majority of Stanford students
and faculty members are in sympathy. In supporting
these causes from his particular political stance, Profes
sor Franklin forcefully remonstrates that the university
is a primary agent of injustice in order to focus protest
action on the university itself. To dramatize the institu
tion's complicity, a variety of immediate issues may
serve; these may present themselves as targets of oppor
tunity based on the vulnerability of the institution, on
the time scale of university decision-making, on adminis
trative errors, or on genuine failure on the part of the
university to do what it said it would or what it should
have done.
The events leading up to February 10th provide an
illustration of the use of a target of opportunity. The
running on the computer of an SRI program entitled
"Gamut-H", allegedly having direct application to am
phibious assault operations in the Vietnam war, was
coupled to the general mood of anger on the campus
about the Laotian invasion. Indeed it emerged in testi
mony that the local issue-Gamut-H—had been stored
for the tactically useful moment; it had been known to
members of the "movement," though apparently not to
Professor Franklin, for at least a week before the
Laotian invassion. The existence of that program was
proclaimed to be a major basis for selection of the
Computation Center as a target for occupation
although the urgency of the demands for remedial action
contrasted oddly with the fact that the "movement" had
been willing to introduce substantial delays while
seeking the tactically opportune moment for releasing its
information. The circumstances also reveal a typical fail
ure to use alternative, non-coercive channels for securing
the same objective. If a professor feels that such
channels are ineffective, he can be instrumental in
creating new means of legitimate problem-solving
withing the university. The violent episodes in which
Professor Franklin played a role represent by no means a
"last resort" effort after non-coercive possibilities have
been exhausted.
Even such a brief description as the above indicates
that the pattern of conduct of Professor Franklin and
other members of the "movement" contains paradoxical
elements that are subject to varying interpretations.
What may appear to his following to be a sincere con
cern with issues of domestic and international injustice
and a zeal to make the university more useful to society
will appear to others to be an instance of cynical mani
pulation to achieve ends—tactics that contrast vividly
with the ideals on behalf of which they are invoked.
Such a stance, in which a member of the faculty
wishes to encourage violence against the university but
also wishes to fall short of actual incitement to or
participation in such violence, leads inevitably to covert
or ambiguous recommendations. On the one hand, Pro
fessor Franklin attempts to stay on the permissible side
of conduct, in order to preserve his position; on the
other hand, he hopes that illegal acts will come about
and wants to do what he can within the law to encour
age them. Such tactics become particularly effective in
ecalating an already inflamed series of events.
The demonstrated existence of this pattern of con
duct could be used in either of two ways in constructing
an argument concerning penalty. His stated intention of
"going right up to the line" might be taken as evidence
of his awareness of that line, and his consequent deter
mination not to violate it. However, continuous probing
of the university's will to enforce its rules might lead to
a high likelihood of future transgressions, quite apart
form the Board's findings of fact on the current charges.
C. DIFFERING PERCEPTIONS OF REALITY
Balanced against this pattern of conduct, and in part
responsible for it, is a perception of reality which Profes
sor Franklin and his followers profess to share which
differs drastically from the consensus in the university.
In his opening argument Professor Franklin proclaimed
deep convictions about the evils of American foreign and
domestic policy and about the inevitable influences of
our socio-economic system in shaping that policy. Essen
tial to this perception is a mistrust of the allegedly
intricate interrelationship between the economic power
of American's "ruling class" and the maintenance of
policies that are imperialistic abroad and oppressive at
home. Of crucial importance in the present case is his
expressed view that the university, run by and for this
ruling class, possesses a substantial institutional guilt for
the ongoing prosecution of those policies. Consequently
he sees no way to disengage American foreign imperia
lism and domestic oppression from the impetus and
support given to those policies by the university.
The outcome of this perception of reality is a convic
tion that the situation must be radically changed-by
persuasion if that is possible and by violence if persua
sion is unavailing. The university becomes the most
immediate and obvious target for such action. Since
Professor Franklin maintains that the class interests of
those with power in the university make it inlikely that
they will engage in more than token gestures of reform,
he sees coercive tactics, which can include violence, as
most likely to produce the changes he desires.
In response to those who claim to abhor violence on
campus, Professor Franklin replies that the university, as
an integral part of the capitalistic system, is itself sys
tematically engaged in the support of violence-a vio
lence that is sometimes very open and apparent, as in
Vietnam or in police oppression in the ghettos, but is
often hidden yet none the less devastating in the econo
mic oppression that is exercised domestically against
minority groups and internationally against Third World
nations. Because of the university's complicity in this
range of violent activities. Professor Franklin maintains
that it is not only appropriate but necessary (taking
tactical considerations into account) to engage in such
acts of violence against the university as can lead it in
the direction of far-reaching reorganization, "to serve
the needs of the people" and not of the privileged few.
This results in the pattern of conduct described in the
preceding section.
Despite the strident, opportunistic, and aggressive be
havior which is in part caused by these perceptions, the
Board affirms that the university must not only tolerate,
but must actively foster, the widest range of opinions
possible. We realize that any perception of reality can be
challenged, stretched and revised by the competing views
with which it comes into vigorous contact and debate on
the university campus. We are committed to the princi
ple that in the competing marketplace of ideas truth can
make it without cheating that is, that in the competi
tion of conflicting perceptions of reality truth can sur
vive without resort to the stilling of dissent. We must
engage, and have tried to engage, in "the willing suspen
sion of disbelief," so as to enter as sympathetically as

possible into the perception of reality espoused by Pro
fessor Franklin. Such matters as conviction, motivation
and rationale are important determinants in the assess
ment of penalty, even though they may not enter direc
tly into findings of fact.
D. THE CONFLICTING RIGHTS
There are special reasons for the exercise of caution
in the application of sanctions in this case. First, loss of
tenure is at risk. We need hardly review here the signifi
cance of tenure; it is not merely a protection of the
individual against unwarranted attacks from the institu
tion from outside political forces. Tenure thus protects
freedom for the full range of scholarly inquiry, and both
the institution and the individual have a large stake in its
continued good health. At the same time, it exacts from
the tenured faculty member obligations of performance
and conduct.
Second, the impoverished state of "case law" for
academic proceedings of this sort gives great weight to
the outcome of the present case. There is much to be
said for caution in ground-breaking. Yet caution
demands regard both for the rights of the individual and
of the institution.
The rights of the individual must be balanced and
judged in relation to the rights of others having different
perceptions, and to the rights of the entire university
community to function and to survive as a center of
unregimented thought. However, the expression of
dee ply-held convictions of one who affirms a minority
perception of reality should not be denied merely be
cause the majority feels more comfortable when not
confronted by challenge.
In dealing with the rights of the institution, it must
be recognized that the university is not the all-powerful
monolith its attackers at times pretend it is. It is an
institution thriving on decentralized initiative, with a
central administration that has limited power but in
creasing responsibilities. There is a real danger that
ignoring the rights of the institution in order to safe
guard the rights of the individual faculty member may
have a result opposite from that intended: it may lead to
more attacks on the rights of other faculty members and
more, rather than less, concentration of administrative
authority. In a very real sense the university is the
totality of its constituents-damage suffered by the uni
versity works directly to the detriment of its individual
members.
There is thus a needed balance among three interests:
those of the faculty member accused, those of the other
members of the academic community, and those of the
university as an institution. But there is a fundamental
consequence of this balance of rights. While it is the
consensus within the university that it should have room
for the widest possible range of perceptions and expres
sion, the university says in fact to its members: "You
may preach and also practice.. .but only up to a certain
point."
The latter edict is not aimed exclusively at those on
the far political left, who often complain that they are
the only ones being discriminated against when told that
a theoretical espousal of their position is permitted so
long as it does not spill over into action. It is also applied
at many other points along the socio-politico-economic
spectrum within the academic community. For instance,
the university protects the right of a professor to
espouse views that suggest a demeaning relationship
between racial background and intelligence, but it would
not perrrut him to organize a forcible attempt to prevent
the Admissions Office from accepting black applicants.
It would allow a fascist professor to advocate abolition
of democratic processes, but would not let him interfere
with the conduct of university exercises dedicated
toward the exposition of democratic institutions.
Common to these examples is the institutional decision
that while those further toward the center of the politi
cal spectrum may practice what they preach, those at its
extremes may preach but are limited in their practice.
From Professor Franklin's viewpoint, this is an unfair
asymmetry. The majority of the community would
point out that in any even-handed balancing of rights,
the encouragement of violence constitutes an infringe
ment; to Professor Franklin the balancing of rights
appears insufficiently global. Because he makes the need
for incitement a political credo, a prosecution for the
advocacy of imminent lawless action becomes to him a
political persecution.
These descriptions do not solve the problem; they
only help to identity it. We cannot simultaneously re
dedicate the university to a specific political goal—by
using force or violence if necessary—and at the same
time preserve it as an institution in which independent
initiative from many quarters can have the widest possi
ble play. A choice must be made and we choose the
latter. Yet having made this choice, the university can
contemplate punishment of action—and most especially,
of speech—only when the rights claimed by the dissi
dents seriously infringe those of other groups or individ
uals within the university. Punishment should follow
only when strongly persuasive evidence has been devel
oped that such infringement has actually occured.
E. GUIDELINES FOR SEVERITY OF SANCTION
1. Modifying Circumstances. On the basis of the
above considerations we are prepared to consider as
mitigating issues of motivation, overriding necessity, and
a variety of factors that may be understandable within
Professor Franklin's framework of convictions but not
within our own or those of most of our colleagues. At
the same time we are prepared to consider as justifica
tion for a relatively more severe penality a pattern of
conduct which systematically threatens the university as
an institution in which decentralized individual initiative
can have the widest possible range.
However, within this balanced input we believe that,
in case of doubt, those criteria that are external to the
factual fabric of the charges should be applied asym
metrically in favor of the defendent, since (1) such
matters were not taken into account in findings of fact,
(2) the perceptions of reality held by the Board are
generally more shared with those of the Administration
than with those of Professor Franklin.
2. The Purpose of Sanction. The purpose of sanction
can be to retaliate, to rehabilitate, or to deter further
violations. We hope that in a university setting only the
last two deserve consideration; and we must ask what
importance to attach to each.
We are highly dubious whether rehabilitation is a
useful concept in this case. Professor Franklin's an
nounced convictions about the guilt of the university
appear deeply-held, and his opposition to the institution
in its present form seems implacable. We believe him
when he expresses his regret that his role in converting
the university to "serve the people" is restricted by
practical reasons to advocacy rather than action. "Re
habilitation" might appear to Professor Franklin as a
highly unfair mandate to change his convictions. Barring

a dramatic change in perception he is unlikely to change
his conduct; thus "rehabilitation" is likely to fail, what
ever the sanction.
It can be argued in contrast that the deterring func
tion of penalty has real force. By setting a price on
proscribed conduct, the university can make its members
consider carefully the line that separates forbidden from
permitted speech and action, and avoid crossing that
line. In establishing a penalty, the institution in effect
announces the degree to which it is attached to its own
values. Such an announcement insists that persons con
sidering borderline conduct must locate the border; for
wnen there is no deterrent to illegal acts, it hardly pays
to have a law.
3. The Range of Possible Sanctions. Dismissal severs
the connection between the defendant and the institu
tion; a lesser sanction assumes that a satisfactory rela
tionship between Professor Franklin and the other mem
bers of the university can be re-established. In consider
ing the appropriateness of a lesser penalty, we must thus
consider (! ) whether it will actually deter, and whether
deterrence is a reasonable expectation at all; (2) whether
it appropriately announces the institution's attachment
to the value measured.
There is no absolute way of defining the deterrent
value of penalty. Some professions (and some people)
are especially sensitive to economic sanctions, others to
censure. If that proposition is granted, a certain finding
of fact can still justify a range of penalties that differ in
kind as well as in severity. Between mere censure and
dismissal there is an intermediate range of possible sanc
tions that is populated primarily by such mechanisms as
suspension (with or without pay) and probation.
We do not hold probation to be workable. Where
such a right as tenure is involved, probation merely
challenges it authenticity; and probation is too often an

excuse for the removal of due process. Suspension is
another matter, and encompasses three kinds of sanc
tion. There is, first, the loss of privilege-to teach and to
use the full range of the academy's resources. Professor
Franklin has already suffered -irreversibly-the penalty
of suspension with pay since February 12, 1971; this is a
long time, although he has contributed substantially to
its length. Second, suspension may also involve loss of
salary. Finally, the imposition of any penalty, suspen
sion included, produces a subtle but real change in
professional status. Sanction imposed by a council of his
peers would surely detract from the offender's standing
in the academic community at large.
For all these reasons suspension without pay ranging
from one quarter upward is a substantial penalty—in
terms of financial cost, in terms of lost academic partici
pation, and in terms of lowered professional status and
consequent loss of mobility. Suspension of too great a
lenght is not practicable, because at some point the
defendent—whom we must assume to be economically
vulnerable-becomes likely to be forced into irreversible
occupational alternatives.
Dismissal is a penalty of undoubted severity because
of its absolute effect upon the immediate institutional
relationship combined with its impact upon employment
opportunities elsewhere within and even outside the
profession. The severity of dismissal as a penalty can be
softened somewhat by a financial settlement which
would permit time for the exploration of alternatives.
The more severe penalties are not in our view in
appropriately matched to the gravity of the charges.
Incitement to violent, coercive, lawless action—however
it may be modified in final judgment by any of the
factors discusses above—is a heavy attack upon the insti
tution of which Professor Franklin is a member.
A. INTRODUCTION
The University administration proposed in its state
ment of charges that Professor Franklin he dismissed,
and has argued in its response to Professor Franklin's
Motion to Dismiss Charges that dismissal would be the
appropriate penalty even if the Board sustained only one
of the last three charges (No.B—White Plaza Rally,
No.9—Computation Center Incident, No.lo—Old Union
Rally).
In the section on "Fundamental Issues and Stand
ards" of this report the Board has agreed that the pur
pose of academic due process is to establish:
1. That the stated cause is the authentic cause for dis
missal, rather than a pretense or makeweight for
considerations invading the academic freedom or or
dinary personal civil liberties of the individual;
2. that the stated cause exists in fact;
3. that the degree of demonstrated professional irres
ponsibility warrants outright termination of the indi
vidual's appointment rather than some lesser sanc
tion, even after taking into account the balance of his
entire service and the personal consequences of dis
missal.
(N. Van Alstyne, Bulletin of the American Associa
tion of University frofessors,Autumn, 1971)
In the preceding sections the Board has dealt with the
first two of these points; we now proceed to the con
tents of the third.
Professor Franklin's performance as a scholar and
teacher has not been questioned in these proceedings;
the Board ruled on this matter on October 28, 1971, in
its response to Professor Franklin's motion:
The Board requires no testimony supporting Profes
sor Franklin's exceptional competence as a scholar
and teacher His competence is not in question in this
hearing; the protections of tenure extend to all ten
ured faculty members without regard to judgments of
their relative merits.
The remaining question is thus one of appropriate
penalty, taking into account the Board's findings of fact,
the entire record, and the consequences of the sanctions
that might be imposed.
Beyond the Board's findings of fact, several elements
of the record in its entirety deserve consideration. First,
Professor Franklin is led into a pattern of conduct that
directly involves attacks upon the values of the univer
sity as now constituted, and also includes encourage
ment of violent or coercive tactics against the members
of the university community and the society of which it
is a part. Second, Professor Franklin has repeatedly
reminded the Board that he bases his actions upon a
different set of perceptions about the university and
society from those of the majority of Stanford faculty
members, including members of the Board. Such percep
tions of reality, and the convictions that emerge from
them, might provide an explanation for his conduct
which would assist the Board in its judgment. Third, the
rights of the university's entire membership not to be
disrupted by the unbridled exercise of self-proclaimed
moral conviction must be balanced against Professor
Franklin's right of political expression and action.
It is the need to balance these frequently conflicting

interests which underlies the determination of appropri
ate sanction.
B. PROFESSOR FRANKLIN S PATTERN OF
CONDUCT
From the viewpoint of most Stanford faculty mem
bers, who themselves are of course subject to limitations
of perception. Professor Franklin pursues a course of
action that seeks systematically to disrupt the normal
functioning of the university. Professor Franklin, on the
other hand, asserts that he is not trying to destroy the
institution, but to convert it to "serve the needs of the
people." Professor Franklin asserts that the university's
actual function is to serve as a training and research
center for the maintenance of an imperialistic hegemony
over the "Pacific Basin Empire;" yet to most of his
colleagues, that is a bizarre mischaracterization. Thus the
basis of a pattern of conduct is itself subject to con
flicting interpretations, depending upon the perception
of reality from which it is being described.
A major element in Professor Franklin's treatment of
issues in the university is an attempt to disembody the
institution from the human beings who make it up.
Characteristically, an instance of policy or action in one
area is identified and found to be unacceptable in some
respects; guilt is then globalized to the entire institution,
and it and its chief administrators are labeled as respon
sible in absolute terms. The dehumanizing process ex
tends to the treatment of the individuals so labeled: they
are characterized as "pigs," "fascists," "lackeys," and
the like.
The essential feature of the confrontation with the
institution involves a call to coercive or violent action,
based upon indignation generated by the particular issue
raised. In such calls, however, Professor Franklin has
been careful to limit his own role to that of advocate
rather than participant. He has said that he does not
wish to compromise his own position as a tenured mem
ber of the Stanford faculty, feeling that he is more
valuable to the "movement" because of that status than,
for example, is a student. For this reason he has stated
that he avoids participating directly in disruptions, illegal
occupations of buildings, and the like. For the same
reason one may presume that he also attempts to avoid
direct incitement; he does, however, acknowledge and
praise violent conduct when it is carried out by others—
as when lie says in his affidavit:
. . .1 have the right to voice public approval of the
fragging of officers in Vietnam and the breaking of
windows at Stanford University. In fact, I am
ashamed to admit that I have not engaged in any of
these activities, nor incited, counselled, advised or
urged others to do so. So I find myself in the
awkward position of defending myself against allega
tions of things which I have not done but perhaps I
should have done.
In this way, encouragement is given to persons who
share Professor Franklin's views about the nature of the
university to engage in illegal acts in which he is not
willing to engage. This influence extends not only to
members of the "movement," but also to non-members
who are in general sympathy with a number of the
causes for which Professor Franklin is an advocate. The
alleviation of poverty, an end to the war in Southeast
Asia, and more rapid progress toward social justice are
all goals with which the majority of Stanford students
and faculty members are in sympathy. In supporting
these causes from his particular political stance, Profes
sor Franklin forcefully remonstrates that the university
is a primary agent of injustice in order to focus protest
action on the university itself. To dramatize the institu
tion's complicity, a variety of immediate issues may
serve; these may present themselves as targets of oppor
tunity based on the vulnerability of the institution, on
the time scale of university decision-making, on adminis
trative errors, or on genuine failure on the part of the
university to do what it said it would or what it should
have done.
The events leading up to February 10th provide an
illustration of the use of a target of opportunity. The
running on the computer of an SRI program entitled
"Gamut-H", allegedly having direct application to am
phibious assault operations in the Vietnam war, was
coupled to the general mood of anger on the campus
about the Laotian invasion. Indeed it emerged in testi
mony that the local issue-Gamut-H—had been stored
for the tactically useful moment; it had been known to
members of the "movement," though apparently not to
Professor Franklin, for at least a week before the
Laotian invassion. The existence of that program was
proclaimed to be a major basis for selection of the
Computation Center as a target for occupation
although the urgency of the demands for remedial action
contrasted oddly with the fact that the "movement" had
been willing to introduce substantial delays while
seeking the tactically opportune moment for releasing its
information. The circumstances also reveal a typical fail
ure to use alternative, non-coercive channels for securing
the same objective. If a professor feels that such
channels are ineffective, he can be instrumental in
creating new means of legitimate problem-solving
withing the university. The violent episodes in which
Professor Franklin played a role represent by no means a
"last resort" effort after non-coercive possibilities have
been exhausted.
Even such a brief description as the above indicates
that the pattern of conduct of Professor Franklin and
other members of the "movement" contains paradoxical
elements that are subject to varying interpretations.
What may appear to his following to be a sincere con
cern with issues of domestic and international injustice
and a zeal to make the university more useful to society
will appear to others to be an instance of cynical mani
pulation to achieve ends—tactics that contrast vividly
with the ideals on behalf of which they are invoked.
Such a stance, in which a member of the faculty
wishes to encourage violence against the university but
also wishes to fall short of actual incitement to or
participation in such violence, leads inevitably to covert
or ambiguous recommendations. On the one hand, Pro
fessor Franklin attempts to stay on the permissible side
of conduct, in order to preserve his position; on the
other hand, he hopes that illegal acts will come about
and wants to do what he can within the law to encour
age them. Such tactics become particularly effective in
ecalating an already inflamed series of events.
The demonstrated existence of this pattern of con
duct could be used in either of two ways in constructing
an argument concerning penalty. His stated intention of
"going right up to the line" might be taken as evidence
of his awareness of that line, and his consequent deter
mination not to violate it. However, continuous probing
of the university's will to enforce its rules might lead to
a high likelihood of future transgressions, quite apart
form the Board's findings of fact on the current charges.
C. DIFFERING PERCEPTIONS OF REALITY
Balanced against this pattern of conduct, and in part
responsible for it, is a perception of reality which Profes
sor Franklin and his followers profess to share which
differs drastically from the consensus in the university.
In his opening argument Professor Franklin proclaimed
deep convictions about the evils of American foreign and
domestic policy and about the inevitable influences of
our socio-economic system in shaping that policy. Essen
tial to this perception is a mistrust of the allegedly
intricate interrelationship between the economic power
of American's "ruling class" and the maintenance of
policies that are imperialistic abroad and oppressive at
home. Of crucial importance in the present case is his
expressed view that the university, run by and for this
ruling class, possesses a substantial institutional guilt for
the ongoing prosecution of those policies. Consequently
he sees no way to disengage American foreign imperia
lism and domestic oppression from the impetus and
support given to those policies by the university.
The outcome of this perception of reality is a convic
tion that the situation must be radically changed-by
persuasion if that is possible and by violence if persua
sion is unavailing. The university becomes the most
immediate and obvious target for such action. Since
Professor Franklin maintains that the class interests of
those with power in the university make it inlikely that
they will engage in more than token gestures of reform,
he sees coercive tactics, which can include violence, as
most likely to produce the changes he desires.
In response to those who claim to abhor violence on
campus, Professor Franklin replies that the university, as
an integral part of the capitalistic system, is itself sys
tematically engaged in the support of violence-a vio
lence that is sometimes very open and apparent, as in
Vietnam or in police oppression in the ghettos, but is
often hidden yet none the less devastating in the econo
mic oppression that is exercised domestically against
minority groups and internationally against Third World
nations. Because of the university's complicity in this
range of violent activities. Professor Franklin maintains
that it is not only appropriate but necessary (taking
tactical considerations into account) to engage in such
acts of violence against the university as can lead it in
the direction of far-reaching reorganization, "to serve
the needs of the people" and not of the privileged few.
This results in the pattern of conduct described in the
preceding section.
Despite the strident, opportunistic, and aggressive be
havior which is in part caused by these perceptions, the
Board affirms that the university must not only tolerate,
but must actively foster, the widest range of opinions
possible. We realize that any perception of reality can be
challenged, stretched and revised by the competing views
with which it comes into vigorous contact and debate on
the university campus. We are committed to the princi
ple that in the competing marketplace of ideas truth can
make it without cheating that is, that in the competi
tion of conflicting perceptions of reality truth can sur
vive without resort to the stilling of dissent. We must
engage, and have tried to engage, in "the willing suspen
sion of disbelief," so as to enter as sympathetically as

possible into the perception of reality espoused by Pro
fessor Franklin. Such matters as conviction, motivation
and rationale are important determinants in the assess
ment of penalty, even though they may not enter direc
tly into findings of fact.
D. THE CONFLICTING RIGHTS
There are special reasons for the exercise of caution
in the application of sanctions in this case. First, loss of
tenure is at risk. We need hardly review here the signifi
cance of tenure; it is not merely a protection of the
individual against unwarranted attacks from the institu
tion from outside political forces. Tenure thus protects
freedom for the full range of scholarly inquiry, and both
the institution and the individual have a large stake in its
continued good health. At the same time, it exacts from
the tenured faculty member obligations of performance
and conduct.
Second, the impoverished state of "case law" for
academic proceedings of this sort gives great weight to
the outcome of the present case. There is much to be
said for caution in ground-breaking. Yet caution
demands regard both for the rights of the individual and
of the institution.
The rights of the individual must be balanced and
judged in relation to the rights of others having different
perceptions, and to the rights of the entire university
community to function and to survive as a center of
unregimented thought. However, the expression of
dee ply-held convictions of one who affirms a minority
perception of reality should not be denied merely be
cause the majority feels more comfortable when not
confronted by challenge.
In dealing with the rights of the institution, it must
be recognized that the university is not the all-powerful
monolith its attackers at times pretend it is. It is an
institution thriving on decentralized initiative, with a
central administration that has limited power but in
creasing responsibilities. There is a real danger that
ignoring the rights of the institution in order to safe
guard the rights of the individual faculty member may
have a result opposite from that intended: it may lead to
more attacks on the rights of other faculty members and
more, rather than less, concentration of administrative
authority. In a very real sense the university is the
totality of its constituents-damage suffered by the uni
versity works directly to the detriment of its individual
members.
There is thus a needed balance among three interests:
those of the faculty member accused, those of the other
members of the academic community, and those of the
university as an institution. But there is a fundamental
consequence of this balance of rights. While it is the
consensus within the university that it should have room
for the widest possible range of perceptions and expres
sion, the university says in fact to its members: "You
may preach and also practice.. .but only up to a certain
point."
The latter edict is not aimed exclusively at those on
the far political left, who often complain that they are
the only ones being discriminated against when told that
a theoretical espousal of their position is permitted so
long as it does not spill over into action. It is also applied
at many other points along the socio-politico-economic
spectrum within the academic community. For instance,
the university protects the right of a professor to
espouse views that suggest a demeaning relationship
between racial background and intelligence, but it would
not perrrut him to organize a forcible attempt to prevent
the Admissions Office from accepting black applicants.
It would allow a fascist professor to advocate abolition
of democratic processes, but would not let him interfere
with the conduct of university exercises dedicated
toward the exposition of democratic institutions.
Common to these examples is the institutional decision
that while those further toward the center of the politi
cal spectrum may practice what they preach, those at its
extremes may preach but are limited in their practice.
From Professor Franklin's viewpoint, this is an unfair
asymmetry. The majority of the community would
point out that in any even-handed balancing of rights,
the encouragement of violence constitutes an infringe
ment; to Professor Franklin the balancing of rights
appears insufficiently global. Because he makes the need
for incitement a political credo, a prosecution for the
advocacy of imminent lawless action becomes to him a
political persecution.
These descriptions do not solve the problem; they
only help to identity it. We cannot simultaneously re
dedicate the university to a specific political goal—by
using force or violence if necessary—and at the same
time preserve it as an institution in which independent
initiative from many quarters can have the widest possi
ble play. A choice must be made and we choose the
latter. Yet having made this choice, the university can
contemplate punishment of action—and most especially,
of speech—only when the rights claimed by the dissi
dents seriously infringe those of other groups or individ
uals within the university. Punishment should follow
only when strongly persuasive evidence has been devel
oped that such infringement has actually occured.
E. GUIDELINES FOR SEVERITY OF SANCTION
1. Modifying Circumstances. On the basis of the
above considerations we are prepared to consider as
mitigating issues of motivation, overriding necessity, and
a variety of factors that may be understandable within
Professor Franklin's framework of convictions but not
within our own or those of most of our colleagues. At
the same time we are prepared to consider as justifica
tion for a relatively more severe penality a pattern of
conduct which systematically threatens the university as
an institution in which decentralized individual initiative
can have the widest possible range.
However, within this balanced input we believe that,
in case of doubt, those criteria that are external to the
factual fabric of the charges should be applied asym
metrically in favor of the defendent, since (1) such
matters were not taken into account in findings of fact,
(2) the perceptions of reality held by the Board are
generally more shared with those of the Administration
than with those of Professor Franklin.
2. The Purpose of Sanction. The purpose of sanction
can be to retaliate, to rehabilitate, or to deter further
violations. We hope that in a university setting only the
last two deserve consideration; and we must ask what
importance to attach to each.
We are highly dubious whether rehabilitation is a
useful concept in this case. Professor Franklin's an
nounced convictions about the guilt of the university
appear deeply-held, and his opposition to the institution
in its present form seems implacable. We believe him
when he expresses his regret that his role in converting
the university to "serve the people" is restricted by
practical reasons to advocacy rather than action. "Re
habilitation" might appear to Professor Franklin as a
highly unfair mandate to change his convictions. Barring

a dramatic change in perception he is unlikely to change
his conduct; thus "rehabilitation" is likely to fail, what
ever the sanction.
It can be argued in contrast that the deterring func
tion of penalty has real force. By setting a price on
proscribed conduct, the university can make its members
consider carefully the line that separates forbidden from
permitted speech and action, and avoid crossing that
line. In establishing a penalty, the institution in effect
announces the degree to which it is attached to its own
values. Such an announcement insists that persons con
sidering borderline conduct must locate the border; for
wnen there is no deterrent to illegal acts, it hardly pays
to have a law.
3. The Range of Possible Sanctions. Dismissal severs
the connection between the defendant and the institu
tion; a lesser sanction assumes that a satisfactory rela
tionship between Professor Franklin and the other mem
bers of the university can be re-established. In consider
ing the appropriateness of a lesser penalty, we must thus
consider (! ) whether it will actually deter, and whether
deterrence is a reasonable expectation at all; (2) whether
it appropriately announces the institution's attachment
to the value measured.
There is no absolute way of defining the deterrent
value of penalty. Some professions (and some people)
are especially sensitive to economic sanctions, others to
censure. If that proposition is granted, a certain finding
of fact can still justify a range of penalties that differ in
kind as well as in severity. Between mere censure and
dismissal there is an intermediate range of possible sanc
tions that is populated primarily by such mechanisms as
suspension (with or without pay) and probation.
We do not hold probation to be workable. Where
such a right as tenure is involved, probation merely
challenges it authenticity; and probation is too often an

excuse for the removal of due process. Suspension is
another matter, and encompasses three kinds of sanc
tion. There is, first, the loss of privilege-to teach and to
use the full range of the academy's resources. Professor
Franklin has already suffered -irreversibly-the penalty
of suspension with pay since February 12, 1971; this is a
long time, although he has contributed substantially to
its length. Second, suspension may also involve loss of
salary. Finally, the imposition of any penalty, suspen
sion included, produces a subtle but real change in
professional status. Sanction imposed by a council of his
peers would surely detract from the offender's standing
in the academic community at large.
For all these reasons suspension without pay ranging
from one quarter upward is a substantial penalty—in
terms of financial cost, in terms of lost academic partici
pation, and in terms of lowered professional status and
consequent loss of mobility. Suspension of too great a
lenght is not practicable, because at some point the
defendent—whom we must assume to be economically
vulnerable-becomes likely to be forced into irreversible
occupational alternatives.
Dismissal is a penalty of undoubted severity because
of its absolute effect upon the immediate institutional
relationship combined with its impact upon employment
opportunities elsewhere within and even outside the
profession. The severity of dismissal as a penalty can be
softened somewhat by a financial settlement which
would permit time for the exploration of alternatives.
The more severe penalties are not in our view in
appropriately matched to the gravity of the charges.
Incitement to violent, coercive, lawless action—however
it may be modified in final judgment by any of the
factors discusses above—is a heavy attack upon the insti
tution of which Professor Franklin is a member.
A. INTRODUCTION
The University administration proposed in its state
ment of charges that Professor Franklin he dismissed,
and has argued in its response to Professor Franklin's
Motion to Dismiss Charges that dismissal would be the
appropriate penalty even if the Board sustained only one
of the last three charges (No.B—White Plaza Rally,
No.9—Computation Center Incident, No.lo—Old Union
Rally).
In the section on "Fundamental Issues and Stand
ards" of this report the Board has agreed that the pur
pose of academic due process is to establish:
1. That the stated cause is the authentic cause for dis
missal, rather than a pretense or makeweight for
considerations invading the academic freedom or or
dinary personal civil liberties of the individual;
2. that the stated cause exists in fact;
3. that the degree of demonstrated professional irres
ponsibility warrants outright termination of the indi
vidual's appointment rather than some lesser sanc
tion, even after taking into account the balance of his
entire service and the personal consequences of dis
missal.
(N. Van Alstyne, Bulletin of the American Associa
tion of University frofessors,Autumn, 1971)
In the preceding sections the Board has dealt with the
first two of these points; we now proceed to the con
tents of the third.
Professor Franklin's performance as a scholar and
teacher has not been questioned in these proceedings;
the Board ruled on this matter on October 28, 1971, in
its response to Professor Franklin's motion:
The Board requires no testimony supporting Profes
sor Franklin's exceptional competence as a scholar
and teacher His competence is not in question in this
hearing; the protections of tenure extend to all ten
ured faculty members without regard to judgments of
their relative merits.
The remaining question is thus one of appropriate
penalty, taking into account the Board's findings of fact,
the entire record, and the consequences of the sanctions
that might be imposed.
Beyond the Board's findings of fact, several elements
of the record in its entirety deserve consideration. First,
Professor Franklin is led into a pattern of conduct that
directly involves attacks upon the values of the univer
sity as now constituted, and also includes encourage
ment of violent or coercive tactics against the members
of the university community and the society of which it
is a part. Second, Professor Franklin has repeatedly
reminded the Board that he bases his actions upon a
different set of perceptions about the university and
society from those of the majority of Stanford faculty
members, including members of the Board. Such percep
tions of reality, and the convictions that emerge from
them, might provide an explanation for his conduct
which would assist the Board in its judgment. Third, the
rights of the university's entire membership not to be
disrupted by the unbridled exercise of self-proclaimed
moral conviction must be balanced against Professor
Franklin's right of political expression and action.
It is the need to balance these frequently conflicting

interests which underlies the determination of appropri
ate sanction.
B. PROFESSOR FRANKLIN S PATTERN OF
CONDUCT
From the viewpoint of most Stanford faculty mem
bers, who themselves are of course subject to limitations
of perception. Professor Franklin pursues a course of
action that seeks systematically to disrupt the normal
functioning of the university. Professor Franklin, on the
other hand, asserts that he is not trying to destroy the
institution, but to convert it to "serve the needs of the
people." Professor Franklin asserts that the university's
actual function is to serve as a training and research
center for the maintenance of an imperialistic hegemony
over the "Pacific Basin Empire;" yet to most of his
colleagues, that is a bizarre mischaracterization. Thus the
basis of a pattern of conduct is itself subject to con
flicting interpretations, depending upon the perception
of reality from which it is being described.
A major element in Professor Franklin's treatment of
issues in the university is an attempt to disembody the
institution from the human beings who make it up.
Characteristically, an instance of policy or action in one
area is identified and found to be unacceptable in some
respects; guilt is then globalized to the entire institution,
and it and its chief administrators are labeled as respon
sible in absolute terms. The dehumanizing process ex
tends to the treatment of the individuals so labeled: they
are characterized as "pigs," "fascists," "lackeys," and
the like.
The essential feature of the confrontation with the
institution involves a call to coercive or violent action,
based upon indignation generated by the particular issue
raised. In such calls, however, Professor Franklin has
been careful to limit his own role to that of advocate
rather than participant. He has said that he does not
wish to compromise his own position as a tenured mem
ber of the Stanford faculty, feeling that he is more
valuable to the "movement" because of that status than,
for example, is a student. For this reason he has stated
that he avoids participating directly in disruptions, illegal
occupations of buildings, and the like. For the same
reason one may presume that he also attempts to avoid
direct incitement; he does, however, acknowledge and
praise violent conduct when it is carried out by others—
as when lie says in his affidavit:
. . .1 have the right to voice public approval of the
fragging of officers in Vietnam and the breaking of
windows at Stanford University. In fact, I am
ashamed to admit that I have not engaged in any of
these activities, nor incited, counselled, advised or
urged others to do so. So I find myself in the
awkward position of defending myself against allega
tions of things which I have not done but perhaps I
should have done.
In this way, encouragement is given to persons who
share Professor Franklin's views about the nature of the
university to engage in illegal acts in which he is not
willing to engage. This influence extends not only to
members of the "movement," but also to non-members
who are in general sympathy with a number of the
causes for which Professor Franklin is an advocate. The
alleviation of poverty, an end to the war in Southeast
Asia, and more rapid progress toward social justice are
all goals with which the majority of Stanford students
and faculty members are in sympathy. In supporting
these causes from his particular political stance, Profes
sor Franklin forcefully remonstrates that the university
is a primary agent of injustice in order to focus protest
action on the university itself. To dramatize the institu
tion's complicity, a variety of immediate issues may
serve; these may present themselves as targets of oppor
tunity based on the vulnerability of the institution, on
the time scale of university decision-making, on adminis
trative errors, or on genuine failure on the part of the
university to do what it said it would or what it should
have done.
The events leading up to February 10th provide an
illustration of the use of a target of opportunity. The
running on the computer of an SRI program entitled
"Gamut-H", allegedly having direct application to am
phibious assault operations in the Vietnam war, was
coupled to the general mood of anger on the campus
about the Laotian invasion. Indeed it emerged in testi
mony that the local issue-Gamut-H—had been stored
for the tactically useful moment; it had been known to
members of the "movement," though apparently not to
Professor Franklin, for at least a week before the
Laotian invassion. The existence of that program was
proclaimed to be a major basis for selection of the
Computation Center as a target for occupation
although the urgency of the demands for remedial action
contrasted oddly with the fact that the "movement" had
been willing to introduce substantial delays while
seeking the tactically opportune moment for releasing its
information. The circumstances also reveal a typical fail
ure to use alternative, non-coercive channels for securing
the same objective. If a professor feels that such
channels are ineffective, he can be instrumental in
creating new means of legitimate problem-solving
withing the university. The violent episodes in which
Professor Franklin played a role represent by no means a
"last resort" effort after non-coercive possibilities have
been exhausted.
Even such a brief description as the above indicates
that the pattern of conduct of Professor Franklin and
other members of the "movement" contains paradoxical
elements that are subject to varying interpretations.
What may appear to his following to be a sincere con
cern with issues of domestic and international injustice
and a zeal to make the university more useful to society
will appear to others to be an instance of cynical mani
pulation to achieve ends—tactics that contrast vividly
with the ideals on behalf of which they are invoked.
Such a stance, in which a member of the faculty
wishes to encourage violence against the university but
also wishes to fall short of actual incitement to or
participation in such violence, leads inevitably to covert
or ambiguous recommendations. On the one hand, Pro
fessor Franklin attempts to stay on the permissible side
of conduct, in order to preserve his position; on the
other hand, he hopes that illegal acts will come about
and wants to do what he can within the law to encour
age them. Such tactics become particularly effective in
ecalating an already inflamed series of events.
The demonstrated existence of this pattern of con
duct could be used in either of two ways in constructing
an argument concerning penalty. His stated intention of
"going right up to the line" might be taken as evidence
of his awareness of that line, and his consequent deter
mination not to violate it. However, continuous probing
of the university's will to enforce its rules might lead to
a high likelihood of future transgressions, quite apart
form the Board's findings of fact on the current charges.
C. DIFFERING PERCEPTIONS OF REALITY
Balanced against this pattern of conduct, and in part
responsible for it, is a perception of reality which Profes
sor Franklin and his followers profess to share which
differs drastically from the consensus in the university.
In his opening argument Professor Franklin proclaimed
deep convictions about the evils of American foreign and
domestic policy and about the inevitable influences of
our socio-economic system in shaping that policy. Essen
tial to this perception is a mistrust of the allegedly
intricate interrelationship between the economic power
of American's "ruling class" and the maintenance of
policies that are imperialistic abroad and oppressive at
home. Of crucial importance in the present case is his
expressed view that the university, run by and for this
ruling class, possesses a substantial institutional guilt for
the ongoing prosecution of those policies. Consequently
he sees no way to disengage American foreign imperia
lism and domestic oppression from the impetus and
support given to those policies by the university.
The outcome of this perception of reality is a convic
tion that the situation must be radically changed-by
persuasion if that is possible and by violence if persua
sion is unavailing. The university becomes the most
immediate and obvious target for such action. Since
Professor Franklin maintains that the class interests of
those with power in the university make it inlikely that
they will engage in more than token gestures of reform,
he sees coercive tactics, which can include violence, as
most likely to produce the changes he desires.
In response to those who claim to abhor violence on
campus, Professor Franklin replies that the university, as
an integral part of the capitalistic system, is itself sys
tematically engaged in the support of violence-a vio
lence that is sometimes very open and apparent, as in
Vietnam or in police oppression in the ghettos, but is
often hidden yet none the less devastating in the econo
mic oppression that is exercised domestically against
minority groups and internationally against Third World
nations. Because of the university's complicity in this
range of violent activities. Professor Franklin maintains
that it is not only appropriate but necessary (taking
tactical considerations into account) to engage in such
acts of violence against the university as can lead it in
the direction of far-reaching reorganization, "to serve
the needs of the people" and not of the privileged few.
This results in the pattern of conduct described in the
preceding section.
Despite the strident, opportunistic, and aggressive be
havior which is in part caused by these perceptions, the
Board affirms that the university must not only tolerate,
but must actively foster, the widest range of opinions
possible. We realize that any perception of reality can be
challenged, stretched and revised by the competing views
with which it comes into vigorous contact and debate on
the university campus. We are committed to the princi
ple that in the competing marketplace of ideas truth can
make it without cheating that is, that in the competi
tion of conflicting perceptions of reality truth can sur
vive without resort to the stilling of dissent. We must
engage, and have tried to engage, in "the willing suspen
sion of disbelief," so as to enter as sympathetically as

possible into the perception of reality espoused by Pro
fessor Franklin. Such matters as conviction, motivation
and rationale are important determinants in the assess
ment of penalty, even though they may not enter direc
tly into findings of fact.
D. THE CONFLICTING RIGHTS
There are special reasons for the exercise of caution
in the application of sanctions in this case. First, loss of
tenure is at risk. We need hardly review here the signifi
cance of tenure; it is not merely a protection of the
individual against unwarranted attacks from the institu
tion from outside political forces. Tenure thus protects
freedom for the full range of scholarly inquiry, and both
the institution and the individual have a large stake in its
continued good health. At the same time, it exacts from
the tenured faculty member obligations of performance
and conduct.
Second, the impoverished state of "case law" for
academic proceedings of this sort gives great weight to
the outcome of the present case. There is much to be
said for caution in ground-breaking. Yet caution
demands regard both for the rights of the individual and
of the institution.
The rights of the individual must be balanced and
judged in relation to the rights of others having different
perceptions, and to the rights of the entire university
community to function and to survive as a center of
unregimented thought. However, the expression of
dee ply-held convictions of one who affirms a minority
perception of reality should not be denied merely be
cause the majority feels more comfortable when not
confronted by challenge.
In dealing with the rights of the institution, it must
be recognized that the university is not the all-powerful
monolith its attackers at times pretend it is. It is an
institution thriving on decentralized initiative, with a
central administration that has limited power but in
creasing responsibilities. There is a real danger that
ignoring the rights of the institution in order to safe
guard the rights of the individual faculty member may
have a result opposite from that intended: it may lead to
more attacks on the rights of other faculty members and
more, rather than less, concentration of administrative
authority. In a very real sense the university is the
totality of its constituents-damage suffered by the uni
versity works directly to the detriment of its individual
members.
There is thus a needed balance among three interests:
those of the faculty member accused, those of the other
members of the academic community, and those of the
university as an institution. But there is a fundamental
consequence of this balance of rights. While it is the
consensus within the university that it should have room
for the widest possible range of perceptions and expres
sion, the university says in fact to its members: "You
may preach and also practice.. .but only up to a certain
point."
The latter edict is not aimed exclusively at those on
the far political left, who often complain that they are
the only ones being discriminated against when told that
a theoretical espousal of their position is permitted so
long as it does not spill over into action. It is also applied
at many other points along the socio-politico-economic
spectrum within the academic community. For instance,
the university protects the right of a professor to
espouse views that suggest a demeaning relationship
between racial background and intelligence, but it would
not perrrut him to organize a forcible attempt to prevent
the Admissions Office from accepting black applicants.
It would allow a fascist professor to advocate abolition
of democratic processes, but would not let him interfere
with the conduct of university exercises dedicated
toward the exposition of democratic institutions.
Common to these examples is the institutional decision
that while those further toward the center of the politi
cal spectrum may practice what they preach, those at its
extremes may preach but are limited in their practice.
From Professor Franklin's viewpoint, this is an unfair
asymmetry. The majority of the community would
point out that in any even-handed balancing of rights,
the encouragement of violence constitutes an infringe
ment; to Professor Franklin the balancing of rights
appears insufficiently global. Because he makes the need
for incitement a political credo, a prosecution for the
advocacy of imminent lawless action becomes to him a
political persecution.
These descriptions do not solve the problem; they
only help to identity it. We cannot simultaneously re
dedicate the university to a specific political goal—by
using force or violence if necessary—and at the same
time preserve it as an institution in which independent
initiative from many quarters can have the widest possi
ble play. A choice must be made and we choose the
latter. Yet having made this choice, the university can
contemplate punishment of action—and most especially,
of speech—only when the rights claimed by the dissi
dents seriously infringe those of other groups or individ
uals within the university. Punishment should follow
only when strongly persuasive evidence has been devel
oped that such infringement has actually occured.
E. GUIDELINES FOR SEVERITY OF SANCTION
1. Modifying Circumstances. On the basis of the
above considerations we are prepared to consider as
mitigating issues of motivation, overriding necessity, and
a variety of factors that may be understandable within
Professor Franklin's framework of convictions but not
within our own or those of most of our colleagues. At
the same time we are prepared to consider as justifica
tion for a relatively more severe penality a pattern of
conduct which systematically threatens the university as
an institution in which decentralized individual initiative
can have the widest possible range.
However, within this balanced input we believe that,
in case of doubt, those criteria that are external to the
factual fabric of the charges should be applied asym
metrically in favor of the defendent, since (1) such
matters were not taken into account in findings of fact,
(2) the perceptions of reality held by the Board are
generally more shared with those of the Administration
than with those of Professor Franklin.
2. The Purpose of Sanction. The purpose of sanction
can be to retaliate, to rehabilitate, or to deter further
violations. We hope that in a university setting only the
last two deserve consideration; and we must ask what
importance to attach to each.
We are highly dubious whether rehabilitation is a
useful concept in this case. Professor Franklin's an
nounced convictions about the guilt of the university
appear deeply-held, and his opposition to the institution
in its present form seems implacable. We believe him
when he expresses his regret that his role in converting
the university to "serve the people" is restricted by
practical reasons to advocacy rather than action. "Re
habilitation" might appear to Professor Franklin as a
highly unfair mandate to change his convictions. Barring

a dramatic change in perception he is unlikely to change
his conduct; thus "rehabilitation" is likely to fail, what
ever the sanction.
It can be argued in contrast that the deterring func
tion of penalty has real force. By setting a price on
proscribed conduct, the university can make its members
consider carefully the line that separates forbidden from
permitted speech and action, and avoid crossing that
line. In establishing a penalty, the institution in effect
announces the degree to which it is attached to its own
values. Such an announcement insists that persons con
sidering borderline conduct must locate the border; for
wnen there is no deterrent to illegal acts, it hardly pays
to have a law.
3. The Range of Possible Sanctions. Dismissal severs
the connection between the defendant and the institu
tion; a lesser sanction assumes that a satisfactory rela
tionship between Professor Franklin and the other mem
bers of the university can be re-established. In consider
ing the appropriateness of a lesser penalty, we must thus
consider (! ) whether it will actually deter, and whether
deterrence is a reasonable expectation at all; (2) whether
it appropriately announces the institution's attachment
to the value measured.
There is no absolute way of defining the deterrent
value of penalty. Some professions (and some people)
are especially sensitive to economic sanctions, others to
censure. If that proposition is granted, a certain finding
of fact can still justify a range of penalties that differ in
kind as well as in severity. Between mere censure and
dismissal there is an intermediate range of possible sanc
tions that is populated primarily by such mechanisms as
suspension (with or without pay) and probation.
We do not hold probation to be workable. Where
such a right as tenure is involved, probation merely
challenges it authenticity; and probation is too often an

excuse for the removal of due process. Suspension is
another matter, and encompasses three kinds of sanc
tion. There is, first, the loss of privilege-to teach and to
use the full range of the academy's resources. Professor
Franklin has already suffered -irreversibly-the penalty
of suspension with pay since February 12, 1971; this is a
long time, although he has contributed substantially to
its length. Second, suspension may also involve loss of
salary. Finally, the imposition of any penalty, suspen
sion included, produces a subtle but real change in
professional status. Sanction imposed by a council of his
peers would surely detract from the offender's standing
in the academic community at large.
For all these reasons suspension without pay ranging
from one quarter upward is a substantial penalty—in
terms of financial cost, in terms of lost academic partici
pation, and in terms of lowered professional status and
consequent loss of mobility. Suspension of too great a
lenght is not practicable, because at some point the
defendent—whom we must assume to be economically
vulnerable-becomes likely to be forced into irreversible
occupational alternatives.
Dismissal is a penalty of undoubted severity because
of its absolute effect upon the immediate institutional
relationship combined with its impact upon employment
opportunities elsewhere within and even outside the
profession. The severity of dismissal as a penalty can be
softened somewhat by a financial settlement which
would permit time for the exploration of alternatives.
The more severe penalties are not in our view in
appropriately matched to the gravity of the charges.
Incitement to violent, coercive, lawless action—however
it may be modified in final judgment by any of the
factors discusses above—is a heavy attack upon the insti
tution of which Professor Franklin is a member.
A. INTRODUCTION
The University administration proposed in its state
ment of charges that Professor Franklin he dismissed,
and has argued in its response to Professor Franklin's
Motion to Dismiss Charges that dismissal would be the
appropriate penalty even if the Board sustained only one
of the last three charges (No.B—White Plaza Rally,
No.9—Computation Center Incident, No.lo—Old Union
Rally).
In the section on "Fundamental Issues and Stand
ards" of this report the Board has agreed that the pur
pose of academic due process is to establish:
1. That the stated cause is the authentic cause for dis
missal, rather than a pretense or makeweight for
considerations invading the academic freedom or or
dinary personal civil liberties of the individual;
2. that the stated cause exists in fact;
3. that the degree of demonstrated professional irres
ponsibility warrants outright termination of the indi
vidual's appointment rather than some lesser sanc
tion, even after taking into account the balance of his
entire service and the personal consequences of dis
missal.
(N. Van Alstyne, Bulletin of the American Associa
tion of University frofessors,Autumn, 1971)
In the preceding sections the Board has dealt with the
first two of these points; we now proceed to the con
tents of the third.
Professor Franklin's performance as a scholar and
teacher has not been questioned in these proceedings;
the Board ruled on this matter on October 28, 1971, in
its response to Professor Franklin's motion:
The Board requires no testimony supporting Profes
sor Franklin's exceptional competence as a scholar
and teacher His competence is not in question in this
hearing; the protections of tenure extend to all ten
ured faculty members without regard to judgments of
their relative merits.
The remaining question is thus one of appropriate
penalty, taking into account the Board's findings of fact,
the entire record, and the consequences of the sanctions
that might be imposed.
Beyond the Board's findings of fact, several elements
of the record in its entirety deserve consideration. First,
Professor Franklin is led into a pattern of conduct that
directly involves attacks upon the values of the univer
sity as now constituted, and also includes encourage
ment of violent or coercive tactics against the members
of the university community and the society of which it
is a part. Second, Professor Franklin has repeatedly
reminded the Board that he bases his actions upon a
different set of perceptions about the university and
society from those of the majority of Stanford faculty
members, including members of the Board. Such percep
tions of reality, and the convictions that emerge from
them, might provide an explanation for his conduct
which would assist the Board in its judgment. Third, the
rights of the university's entire membership not to be
disrupted by the unbridled exercise of self-proclaimed
moral conviction must be balanced against Professor
Franklin's right of political expression and action.
It is the need to balance these frequently conflicting

interests which underlies the determination of appropri
ate sanction.
B. PROFESSOR FRANKLIN S PATTERN OF
CONDUCT
From the viewpoint of most Stanford faculty mem
bers, who themselves are of course subject to limitations
of perception. Professor Franklin pursues a course of
action that seeks systematically to disrupt the normal
functioning of the university. Professor Franklin, on the
other hand, asserts that he is not trying to destroy the
institution, but to convert it to "serve the needs of the
people." Professor Franklin asserts that the university's
actual function is to serve as a training and research
center for the maintenance of an imperialistic hegemony
over the "Pacific Basin Empire;" yet to most of his
colleagues, that is a bizarre mischaracterization. Thus the
basis of a pattern of conduct is itself subject to con
flicting interpretations, depending upon the perception
of reality from which it is being described.
A major element in Professor Franklin's treatment of
issues in the university is an attempt to disembody the
institution from the human beings who make it up.
Characteristically, an instance of policy or action in one
area is identified and found to be unacceptable in some
respects; guilt is then globalized to the entire institution,
and it and its chief administrators are labeled as respon
sible in absolute terms. The dehumanizing process ex
tends to the treatment of the individuals so labeled: they
are characterized as "pigs," "fascists," "lackeys," and
the like.
The essential feature of the confrontation with the
institution involves a call to coercive or violent action,
based upon indignation generated by the particular issue
raised. In such calls, however, Professor Franklin has
been careful to limit his own role to that of advocate
rather than participant. He has said that he does not
wish to compromise his own position as a tenured mem
ber of the Stanford faculty, feeling that he is more
valuable to the "movement" because of that status than,
for example, is a student. For this reason he has stated
that he avoids participating directly in disruptions, illegal
occupations of buildings, and the like. For the same
reason one may presume that he also attempts to avoid
direct incitement; he does, however, acknowledge and
praise violent conduct when it is carried out by others—
as when lie says in his affidavit:
. . .1 have the right to voice public approval of the
fragging of officers in Vietnam and the breaking of
windows at Stanford University. In fact, I am
ashamed to admit that I have not engaged in any of
these activities, nor incited, counselled, advised or
urged others to do so. So I find myself in the
awkward position of defending myself against allega
tions of things which I have not done but perhaps I
should have done.
In this way, encouragement is given to persons who
share Professor Franklin's views about the nature of the
university to engage in illegal acts in which he is not
willing to engage. This influence extends not only to
members of the "movement," but also to non-members
who are in general sympathy with a number of the
causes for which Professor Franklin is an advocate. The
alleviation of poverty, an end to the war in Southeast
Asia, and more rapid progress toward social justice are
all goals with which the majority of Stanford students
and faculty members are in sympathy. In supporting
these causes from his particular political stance, Profes
sor Franklin forcefully remonstrates that the university
is a primary agent of injustice in order to focus protest
action on the university itself. To dramatize the institu
tion's complicity, a variety of immediate issues may
serve; these may present themselves as targets of oppor
tunity based on the vulnerability of the institution, on
the time scale of university decision-making, on adminis
trative errors, or on genuine failure on the part of the
university to do what it said it would or what it should
have done.
The events leading up to February 10th provide an
illustration of the use of a target of opportunity. The
running on the computer of an SRI program entitled
"Gamut-H", allegedly having direct application to am
phibious assault operations in the Vietnam war, was
coupled to the general mood of anger on the campus
about the Laotian invasion. Indeed it emerged in testi
mony that the local issue-Gamut-H—had been stored
for the tactically useful moment; it had been known to
members of the "movement," though apparently not to
Professor Franklin, for at least a week before the
Laotian invassion. The existence of that program was
proclaimed to be a major basis for selection of the
Computation Center as a target for occupation
although the urgency of the demands for remedial action
contrasted oddly with the fact that the "movement" had
been willing to introduce substantial delays while
seeking the tactically opportune moment for releasing its
information. The circumstances also reveal a typical fail
ure to use alternative, non-coercive channels for securing
the same objective. If a professor feels that such
channels are ineffective, he can be instrumental in
creating new means of legitimate problem-solving
withing the university. The violent episodes in which
Professor Franklin played a role represent by no means a
"last resort" effort after non-coercive possibilities have
been exhausted.
Even such a brief description as the above indicates
that the pattern of conduct of Professor Franklin and
other members of the "movement" contains paradoxical
elements that are subject to varying interpretations.
What may appear to his following to be a sincere con
cern with issues of domestic and international injustice
and a zeal to make the university more useful to society
will appear to others to be an instance of cynical mani
pulation to achieve ends—tactics that contrast vividly
with the ideals on behalf of which they are invoked.
Such a stance, in which a member of the faculty
wishes to encourage violence against the university but
also wishes to fall short of actual incitement to or
participation in such violence, leads inevitably to covert
or ambiguous recommendations. On the one hand, Pro
fessor Franklin attempts to stay on the permissible side
of conduct, in order to preserve his position; on the
other hand, he hopes that illegal acts will come about
and wants to do what he can within the law to encour
age them. Such tactics become particularly effective in
ecalating an already inflamed series of events.
The demonstrated existence of this pattern of con
duct could be used in either of two ways in constructing
an argument concerning penalty. His stated intention of
"going right up to the line" might be taken as evidence
of his awareness of that line, and his consequent deter
mination not to violate it. However, continuous probing
of the university's will to enforce its rules might lead to
a high likelihood of future transgressions, quite apart
form the Board's findings of fact on the current charges.
C. DIFFERING PERCEPTIONS OF REALITY
Balanced against this pattern of conduct, and in part
responsible for it, is a perception of reality which Profes
sor Franklin and his followers profess to share which
differs drastically from the consensus in the university.
In his opening argument Professor Franklin proclaimed
deep convictions about the evils of American foreign and
domestic policy and about the inevitable influences of
our socio-economic system in shaping that policy. Essen
tial to this perception is a mistrust of the allegedly
intricate interrelationship between the economic power
of American's "ruling class" and the maintenance of
policies that are imperialistic abroad and oppressive at
home. Of crucial importance in the present case is his
expressed view that the university, run by and for this
ruling class, possesses a substantial institutional guilt for
the ongoing prosecution of those policies. Consequently
he sees no way to disengage American foreign imperia
lism and domestic oppression from the impetus and
support given to those policies by the university.
The outcome of this perception of reality is a convic
tion that the situation must be radically changed-by
persuasion if that is possible and by violence if persua
sion is unavailing. The university becomes the most
immediate and obvious target for such action. Since
Professor Franklin maintains that the class interests of
those with power in the university make it inlikely that
they will engage in more than token gestures of reform,
he sees coercive tactics, which can include violence, as
most likely to produce the changes he desires.
In response to those who claim to abhor violence on
campus, Professor Franklin replies that the university, as
an integral part of the capitalistic system, is itself sys
tematically engaged in the support of violence-a vio
lence that is sometimes very open and apparent, as in
Vietnam or in police oppression in the ghettos, but is
often hidden yet none the less devastating in the econo
mic oppression that is exercised domestically against
minority groups and internationally against Third World
nations. Because of the university's complicity in this
range of violent activities. Professor Franklin maintains
that it is not only appropriate but necessary (taking
tactical considerations into account) to engage in such
acts of violence against the university as can lead it in
the direction of far-reaching reorganization, "to serve
the needs of the people" and not of the privileged few.
This results in the pattern of conduct described in the
preceding section.
Despite the strident, opportunistic, and aggressive be
havior which is in part caused by these perceptions, the
Board affirms that the university must not only tolerate,
but must actively foster, the widest range of opinions
possible. We realize that any perception of reality can be
challenged, stretched and revised by the competing views
with which it comes into vigorous contact and debate on
the university campus. We are committed to the princi
ple that in the competing marketplace of ideas truth can
make it without cheating that is, that in the competi
tion of conflicting perceptions of reality truth can sur
vive without resort to the stilling of dissent. We must
engage, and have tried to engage, in "the willing suspen
sion of disbelief," so as to enter as sympathetically as

possible into the perception of reality espoused by Pro
fessor Franklin. Such matters as conviction, motivation
and rationale are important determinants in the assess
ment of penalty, even though they may not enter direc
tly into findings of fact.
D. THE CONFLICTING RIGHTS
There are special reasons for the exercise of caution
in the application of sanctions in this case. First, loss of
tenure is at risk. We need hardly review here the signifi
cance of tenure; it is not merely a protection of the
individual against unwarranted attacks from the institu
tion from outside political forces. Tenure thus protects
freedom for the full range of scholarly inquiry, and both
the institution and the individual have a large stake in its
continued good health. At the same time, it exacts from
the tenured faculty member obligations of performance
and conduct.
Second, the impoverished state of "case law" for
academic proceedings of this sort gives great weight to
the outcome of the present case. There is much to be
said for caution in ground-breaking. Yet caution
demands regard both for the rights of the individual and
of the institution.
The rights of the individual must be balanced and
judged in relation to the rights of others having different
perceptions, and to the rights of the entire university
community to function and to survive as a center of
unregimented thought. However, the expression of
dee ply-held convictions of one who affirms a minority
perception of reality should not be denied merely be
cause the majority feels more comfortable when not
confronted by challenge.
In dealing with the rights of the institution, it must
be recognized that the university is not the all-powerful
monolith its attackers at times pretend it is. It is an
institution thriving on decentralized initiative, with a
central administration that has limited power but in
creasing responsibilities. There is a real danger that
ignoring the rights of the institution in order to safe
guard the rights of the individual faculty member may
have a result opposite from that intended: it may lead to
more attacks on the rights of other faculty members and
more, rather than less, concentration of administrative
authority. In a very real sense the university is the
totality of its constituents-damage suffered by the uni
versity works directly to the detriment of its individual
members.
There is thus a needed balance among three interests:
those of the faculty member accused, those of the other
members of the academic community, and those of the
university as an institution. But there is a fundamental
consequence of this balance of rights. While it is the
consensus within the university that it should have room
for the widest possible range of perceptions and expres
sion, the university says in fact to its members: "You
may preach and also practice.. .but only up to a certain
point."
The latter edict is not aimed exclusively at those on
the far political left, who often complain that they are
the only ones being discriminated against when told that
a theoretical espousal of their position is permitted so
long as it does not spill over into action. It is also applied
at many other points along the socio-politico-economic
spectrum within the academic community. For instance,
the university protects the right of a professor to
espouse views that suggest a demeaning relationship
between racial background and intelligence, but it would
not perrrut him to organize a forcible attempt to prevent
the Admissions Office from accepting black applicants.
It would allow a fascist professor to advocate abolition
of democratic processes, but would not let him interfere
with the conduct of university exercises dedicated
toward the exposition of democratic institutions.
Common to these examples is the institutional decision
that while those further toward the center of the politi
cal spectrum may practice what they preach, those at its
extremes may preach but are limited in their practice.
From Professor Franklin's viewpoint, this is an unfair
asymmetry. The majority of the community would
point out that in any even-handed balancing of rights,
the encouragement of violence constitutes an infringe
ment; to Professor Franklin the balancing of rights
appears insufficiently global. Because he makes the need
for incitement a political credo, a prosecution for the
advocacy of imminent lawless action becomes to him a
political persecution.
These descriptions do not solve the problem; they
only help to identity it. We cannot simultaneously re
dedicate the university to a specific political goal—by
using force or violence if necessary—and at the same
time preserve it as an institution in which independent
initiative from many quarters can have the widest possi
ble play. A choice must be made and we choose the
latter. Yet having made this choice, the university can
contemplate punishment of action—and most especially,
of speech—only when the rights claimed by the dissi
dents seriously infringe those of other groups or individ
uals within the university. Punishment should follow
only when strongly persuasive evidence has been devel
oped that such infringement has actually occured.
E. GUIDELINES FOR SEVERITY OF SANCTION
1. Modifying Circumstances. On the basis of the
above considerations we are prepared to consider as
mitigating issues of motivation, overriding necessity, and
a variety of factors that may be understandable within
Professor Franklin's framework of convictions but not
within our own or those of most of our colleagues. At
the same time we are prepared to consider as justifica
tion for a relatively more severe penality a pattern of
conduct which systematically threatens the university as
an institution in which decentralized individual initiative
can have the widest possible range.
However, within this balanced input we believe that,
in case of doubt, those criteria that are external to the
factual fabric of the charges should be applied asym
metrically in favor of the defendent, since (1) such
matters were not taken into account in findings of fact,
(2) the perceptions of reality held by the Board are
generally more shared with those of the Administration
than with those of Professor Franklin.
2. The Purpose of Sanction. The purpose of sanction
can be to retaliate, to rehabilitate, or to deter further
violations. We hope that in a university setting only the
last two deserve consideration; and we must ask what
importance to attach to each.
We are highly dubious whether rehabilitation is a
useful concept in this case. Professor Franklin's an
nounced convictions about the guilt of the university
appear deeply-held, and his opposition to the institution
in its present form seems implacable. We believe him
when he expresses his regret that his role in converting
the university to "serve the people" is restricted by
practical reasons to advocacy rather than action. "Re
habilitation" might appear to Professor Franklin as a
highly unfair mandate to change his convictions. Barring

a dramatic change in perception he is unlikely to change
his conduct; thus "rehabilitation" is likely to fail, what
ever the sanction.
It can be argued in contrast that the deterring func
tion of penalty has real force. By setting a price on
proscribed conduct, the university can make its members
consider carefully the line that separates forbidden from
permitted speech and action, and avoid crossing that
line. In establishing a penalty, the institution in effect
announces the degree to which it is attached to its own
values. Such an announcement insists that persons con
sidering borderline conduct must locate the border; for
wnen there is no deterrent to illegal acts, it hardly pays
to have a law.
3. The Range of Possible Sanctions. Dismissal severs
the connection between the defendant and the institu
tion; a lesser sanction assumes that a satisfactory rela
tionship between Professor Franklin and the other mem
bers of the university can be re-established. In consider
ing the appropriateness of a lesser penalty, we must thus
consider (! ) whether it will actually deter, and whether
deterrence is a reasonable expectation at all; (2) whether
it appropriately announces the institution's attachment
to the value measured.
There is no absolute way of defining the deterrent
value of penalty. Some professions (and some people)
are especially sensitive to economic sanctions, others to
censure. If that proposition is granted, a certain finding
of fact can still justify a range of penalties that differ in
kind as well as in severity. Between mere censure and
dismissal there is an intermediate range of possible sanc
tions that is populated primarily by such mechanisms as
suspension (with or without pay) and probation.
We do not hold probation to be workable. Where
such a right as tenure is involved, probation merely
challenges it authenticity; and probation is too often an

excuse for the removal of due process. Suspension is
another matter, and encompasses three kinds of sanc
tion. There is, first, the loss of privilege-to teach and to
use the full range of the academy's resources. Professor
Franklin has already suffered -irreversibly-the penalty
of suspension with pay since February 12, 1971; this is a
long time, although he has contributed substantially to
its length. Second, suspension may also involve loss of
salary. Finally, the imposition of any penalty, suspen
sion included, produces a subtle but real change in
professional status. Sanction imposed by a council of his
peers would surely detract from the offender's standing
in the academic community at large.
For all these reasons suspension without pay ranging
from one quarter upward is a substantial penalty—in
terms of financial cost, in terms of lost academic partici
pation, and in terms of lowered professional status and
consequent loss of mobility. Suspension of too great a
lenght is not practicable, because at some point the
defendent—whom we must assume to be economically
vulnerable-becomes likely to be forced into irreversible
occupational alternatives.
Dismissal is a penalty of undoubted severity because
of its absolute effect upon the immediate institutional
relationship combined with its impact upon employment
opportunities elsewhere within and even outside the
profession. The severity of dismissal as a penalty can be
softened somewhat by a financial settlement which
would permit time for the exploration of alternatives.
The more severe penalties are not in our view in
appropriately matched to the gravity of the charges.
Incitement to violent, coercive, lawless action—however
it may be modified in final judgment by any of the
factors discusses above—is a heavy attack upon the insti
tution of which Professor Franklin is a member.
A. INTRODUCTION
The University administration proposed in its state
ment of charges that Professor Franklin he dismissed,
and has argued in its response to Professor Franklin's
Motion to Dismiss Charges that dismissal would be the
appropriate penalty even if the Board sustained only one
of the last three charges (No.B—White Plaza Rally,
No.9—Computation Center Incident, No.lo—Old Union
Rally).
In the section on "Fundamental Issues and Stand
ards" of this report the Board has agreed that the pur
pose of academic due process is to establish:
1. That the stated cause is the authentic cause for dis
missal, rather than a pretense or makeweight for
considerations invading the academic freedom or or
dinary personal civil liberties of the individual;
2. that the stated cause exists in fact;
3. that the degree of demonstrated professional irres
ponsibility warrants outright termination of the indi
vidual's appointment rather than some lesser sanc
tion, even after taking into account the balance of his
entire service and the personal consequences of dis
missal.
(N. Van Alstyne, Bulletin of the American Associa
tion of University frofessors,Autumn, 1971)
In the preceding sections the Board has dealt with the
first two of these points; we now proceed to the con
tents of the third.
Professor Franklin's performance as a scholar and
teacher has not been questioned in these proceedings;
the Board ruled on this matter on October 28, 1971, in
its response to Professor Franklin's motion:
The Board requires no testimony supporting Profes
sor Franklin's exceptional competence as a scholar
and teacher His competence is not in question in this
hearing; the protections of tenure extend to all ten
ured faculty members without regard to judgments of
their relative merits.
The remaining question is thus one of appropriate
penalty, taking into account the Board's findings of fact,
the entire record, and the consequences of the sanctions
that might be imposed.
Beyond the Board's findings of fact, several elements
of the record in its entirety deserve consideration. First,
Professor Franklin is led into a pattern of conduct that
directly involves attacks upon the values of the univer
sity as now constituted, and also includes encourage
ment of violent or coercive tactics against the members
of the university community and the society of which it
is a part. Second, Professor Franklin has repeatedly
reminded the Board that he bases his actions upon a
different set of perceptions about the university and
society from those of the majority of Stanford faculty
members, including members of the Board. Such percep
tions of reality, and the convictions that emerge from
them, might provide an explanation for his conduct
which would assist the Board in its judgment. Third, the
rights of the university's entire membership not to be
disrupted by the unbridled exercise of self-proclaimed
moral conviction must be balanced against Professor
Franklin's right of political expression and action.
It is the need to balance these frequently conflicting

interests which underlies the determination of appropri
ate sanction.
B. PROFESSOR FRANKLIN S PATTERN OF
CONDUCT
From the viewpoint of most Stanford faculty mem
bers, who themselves are of course subject to limitations
of perception. Professor Franklin pursues a course of
action that seeks systematically to disrupt the normal
functioning of the university. Professor Franklin, on the
other hand, asserts that he is not trying to destroy the
institution, but to convert it to "serve the needs of the
people." Professor Franklin asserts that the university's
actual function is to serve as a training and research
center for the maintenance of an imperialistic hegemony
over the "Pacific Basin Empire;" yet to most of his
colleagues, that is a bizarre mischaracterization. Thus the
basis of a pattern of conduct is itself subject to con
flicting interpretations, depending upon the perception
of reality from which it is being described.
A major element in Professor Franklin's treatment of
issues in the university is an attempt to disembody the
institution from the human beings who make it up.
Characteristically, an instance of policy or action in one
area is identified and found to be unacceptable in some
respects; guilt is then globalized to the entire institution,
and it and its chief administrators are labeled as respon
sible in absolute terms. The dehumanizing process ex
tends to the treatment of the individuals so labeled: they
are characterized as "pigs," "fascists," "lackeys," and
the like.
The essential feature of the confrontation with the
institution involves a call to coercive or violent action,
based upon indignation generated by the particular issue
raised. In such calls, however, Professor Franklin has
been careful to limit his own role to that of advocate
rather than participant. He has said that he does not
wish to compromise his own position as a tenured mem
ber of the Stanford faculty, feeling that he is more
valuable to the "movement" because of that status than,
for example, is a student. For this reason he has stated
that he avoids participating directly in disruptions, illegal
occupations of buildings, and the like. For the same
reason one may presume that he also attempts to avoid
direct incitement; he does, however, acknowledge and
praise violent conduct when it is carried out by others—
as when lie says in his affidavit:
. . .1 have the right to voice public approval of the
fragging of officers in Vietnam and the breaking of
windows at Stanford University. In fact, I am
ashamed to admit that I have not engaged in any of
these activities, nor incited, counselled, advised or
urged others to do so. So I find myself in the
awkward position of defending myself against allega
tions of things which I have not done but perhaps I
should have done.
In this way, encouragement is given to persons who
share Professor Franklin's views about the nature of the
university to engage in illegal acts in which he is not
willing to engage. This influence extends not only to
members of the "movement," but also to non-members
who are in general sympathy with a number of the
causes for which Professor Franklin is an advocate. The
alleviation of poverty, an end to the war in Southeast
Asia, and more rapid progress toward social justice are
all goals with which the majority of Stanford students
and faculty members are in sympathy. In supporting
these causes from his particular political stance, Profes
sor Franklin forcefully remonstrates that the university
is a primary agent of injustice in order to focus protest
action on the university itself. To dramatize the institu
tion's complicity, a variety of immediate issues may
serve; these may present themselves as targets of oppor
tunity based on the vulnerability of the institution, on
the time scale of university decision-making, on adminis
trative errors, or on genuine failure on the part of the
university to do what it said it would or what it should
have done.
The events leading up to February 10th provide an
illustration of the use of a target of opportunity. The
running on the computer of an SRI program entitled
"Gamut-H", allegedly having direct application to am
phibious assault operations in the Vietnam war, was
coupled to the general mood of anger on the campus
about the Laotian invasion. Indeed it emerged in testi
mony that the local issue-Gamut-H—had been stored
for the tactically useful moment; it had been known to
members of the "movement," though apparently not to
Professor Franklin, for at least a week before the
Laotian invassion. The existence of that program was
proclaimed to be a major basis for selection of the
Computation Center as a target for occupation
although the urgency of the demands for remedial action
contrasted oddly with the fact that the "movement" had
been willing to introduce substantial delays while
seeking the tactically opportune moment for releasing its
information. The circumstances also reveal a typical fail
ure to use alternative, non-coercive channels for securing
the same objective. If a professor feels that such
channels are ineffective, he can be instrumental in
creating new means of legitimate problem-solving
withing the university. The violent episodes in which
Professor Franklin played a role represent by no means a
"last resort" effort after non-coercive possibilities have
been exhausted.
Even such a brief description as the above indicates
that the pattern of conduct of Professor Franklin and
other members of the "movement" contains paradoxical
elements that are subject to varying interpretations.
What may appear to his following to be a sincere con
cern with issues of domestic and international injustice
and a zeal to make the university more useful to society
will appear to others to be an instance of cynical mani
pulation to achieve ends—tactics that contrast vividly
with the ideals on behalf of which they are invoked.
Such a stance, in which a member of the faculty
wishes to encourage violence against the university but
also wishes to fall short of actual incitement to or
participation in such violence, leads inevitably to covert
or ambiguous recommendations. On the one hand, Pro
fessor Franklin attempts to stay on the permissible side
of conduct, in order to preserve his position; on the
other hand, he hopes that illegal acts will come about
and wants to do what he can within the law to encour
age them. Such tactics become particularly effective in
ecalating an already inflamed series of events.
The demonstrated existence of this pattern of con
duct could be used in either of two ways in constructing
an argument concerning penalty. His stated intention of
"going right up to the line" might be taken as evidence
of his awareness of that line, and his consequent deter
mination not to violate it. However, continuous probing
of the university's will to enforce its rules might lead to
a high likelihood of future transgressions, quite apart
form the Board's findings of fact on the current charges.
C. DIFFERING PERCEPTIONS OF REALITY
Balanced against this pattern of conduct, and in part
responsible for it, is a perception of reality which Profes
sor Franklin and his followers profess to share which
differs drastically from the consensus in the university.
In his opening argument Professor Franklin proclaimed
deep convictions about the evils of American foreign and
domestic policy and about the inevitable influences of
our socio-economic system in shaping that policy. Essen
tial to this perception is a mistrust of the allegedly
intricate interrelationship between the economic power
of American's "ruling class" and the maintenance of
policies that are imperialistic abroad and oppressive at
home. Of crucial importance in the present case is his
expressed view that the university, run by and for this
ruling class, possesses a substantial institutional guilt for
the ongoing prosecution of those policies. Consequently
he sees no way to disengage American foreign imperia
lism and domestic oppression from the impetus and
support given to those policies by the university.
The outcome of this perception of reality is a convic
tion that the situation must be radically changed-by
persuasion if that is possible and by violence if persua
sion is unavailing. The university becomes the most
immediate and obvious target for such action. Since
Professor Franklin maintains that the class interests of
those with power in the university make it inlikely that
they will engage in more than token gestures of reform,
he sees coercive tactics, which can include violence, as
most likely to produce the changes he desires.
In response to those who claim to abhor violence on
campus, Professor Franklin replies that the university, as
an integral part of the capitalistic system, is itself sys
tematically engaged in the support of violence-a vio
lence that is sometimes very open and apparent, as in
Vietnam or in police oppression in the ghettos, but is
often hidden yet none the less devastating in the econo
mic oppression that is exercised domestically against
minority groups and internationally against Third World
nations. Because of the university's complicity in this
range of violent activities. Professor Franklin maintains
that it is not only appropriate but necessary (taking
tactical considerations into account) to engage in such
acts of violence against the university as can lead it in
the direction of far-reaching reorganization, "to serve
the needs of the people" and not of the privileged few.
This results in the pattern of conduct described in the
preceding section.
Despite the strident, opportunistic, and aggressive be
havior which is in part caused by these perceptions, the
Board affirms that the university must not only tolerate,
but must actively foster, the widest range of opinions
possible. We realize that any perception of reality can be
challenged, stretched and revised by the competing views
with which it comes into vigorous contact and debate on
the university campus. We are committed to the princi
ple that in the competing marketplace of ideas truth can
make it without cheating that is, that in the competi
tion of conflicting perceptions of reality truth can sur
vive without resort to the stilling of dissent. We must
engage, and have tried to engage, in "the willing suspen
sion of disbelief," so as to enter as sympathetically as

possible into the perception of reality espoused by Pro
fessor Franklin. Such matters as conviction, motivation
and rationale are important determinants in the assess
ment of penalty, even though they may not enter direc
tly into findings of fact.
D. THE CONFLICTING RIGHTS
There are special reasons for the exercise of caution
in the application of sanctions in this case. First, loss of
tenure is at risk. We need hardly review here the signifi
cance of tenure; it is not merely a protection of the
individual against unwarranted attacks from the institu
tion from outside political forces. Tenure thus protects
freedom for the full range of scholarly inquiry, and both
the institution and the individual have a large stake in its
continued good health. At the same time, it exacts from
the tenured faculty member obligations of performance
and conduct.
Second, the impoverished state of "case law" for
academic proceedings of this sort gives great weight to
the outcome of the present case. There is much to be
said for caution in ground-breaking. Yet caution
demands regard both for the rights of the individual and
of the institution.
The rights of the individual must be balanced and
judged in relation to the rights of others having different
perceptions, and to the rights of the entire university
community to function and to survive as a center of
unregimented thought. However, the expression of
dee ply-held convictions of one who affirms a minority
perception of reality should not be denied merely be
cause the majority feels more comfortable when not
confronted by challenge.
In dealing with the rights of the institution, it must
be recognized that the university is not the all-powerful
monolith its attackers at times pretend it is. It is an
institution thriving on decentralized initiative, with a
central administration that has limited power but in
creasing responsibilities. There is a real danger that
ignoring the rights of the institution in order to safe
guard the rights of the individual faculty member may
have a result opposite from that intended: it may lead to
more attacks on the rights of other faculty members and
more, rather than less, concentration of administrative
authority. In a very real sense the university is the
totality of its constituents-damage suffered by the uni
versity works directly to the detriment of its individual
members.
There is thus a needed balance among three interests:
those of the faculty member accused, those of the other
members of the academic community, and those of the
university as an institution. But there is a fundamental
consequence of this balance of rights. While it is the
consensus within the university that it should have room
for the widest possible range of perceptions and expres
sion, the university says in fact to its members: "You
may preach and also practice.. .but only up to a certain
point."
The latter edict is not aimed exclusively at those on
the far political left, who often complain that they are
the only ones being discriminated against when told that
a theoretical espousal of their position is permitted so
long as it does not spill over into action. It is also applied
at many other points along the socio-politico-economic
spectrum within the academic community. For instance,
the university protects the right of a professor to
espouse views that suggest a demeaning relationship
between racial background and intelligence, but it would
not perrrut him to organize a forcible attempt to prevent
the Admissions Office from accepting black applicants.
It would allow a fascist professor to advocate abolition
of democratic processes, but would not let him interfere
with the conduct of university exercises dedicated
toward the exposition of democratic institutions.
Common to these examples is the institutional decision
that while those further toward the center of the politi
cal spectrum may practice what they preach, those at its
extremes may preach but are limited in their practice.
From Professor Franklin's viewpoint, this is an unfair
asymmetry. The majority of the community would
point out that in any even-handed balancing of rights,
the encouragement of violence constitutes an infringe
ment; to Professor Franklin the balancing of rights
appears insufficiently global. Because he makes the need
for incitement a political credo, a prosecution for the
advocacy of imminent lawless action becomes to him a
political persecution.
These descriptions do not solve the problem; they
only help to identity it. We cannot simultaneously re
dedicate the university to a specific political goal—by
using force or violence if necessary—and at the same
time preserve it as an institution in which independent
initiative from many quarters can have the widest possi
ble play. A choice must be made and we choose the
latter. Yet having made this choice, the university can
contemplate punishment of action—and most especially,
of speech—only when the rights claimed by the dissi
dents seriously infringe those of other groups or individ
uals within the university. Punishment should follow
only when strongly persuasive evidence has been devel
oped that such infringement has actually occured.
E. GUIDELINES FOR SEVERITY OF SANCTION
1. Modifying Circumstances. On the basis of the
above considerations we are prepared to consider as
mitigating issues of motivation, overriding necessity, and
a variety of factors that may be understandable within
Professor Franklin's framework of convictions but not
within our own or those of most of our colleagues. At
the same time we are prepared to consider as justifica
tion for a relatively more severe penality a pattern of
conduct which systematically threatens the university as
an institution in which decentralized individual initiative
can have the widest possible range.
However, within this balanced input we believe that,
in case of doubt, those criteria that are external to the
factual fabric of the charges should be applied asym
metrically in favor of the defendent, since (1) such
matters were not taken into account in findings of fact,
(2) the perceptions of reality held by the Board are
generally more shared with those of the Administration
than with those of Professor Franklin.
2. The Purpose of Sanction. The purpose of sanction
can be to retaliate, to rehabilitate, or to deter further
violations. We hope that in a university setting only the
last two deserve consideration; and we must ask what
importance to attach to each.
We are highly dubious whether rehabilitation is a
useful concept in this case. Professor Franklin's an
nounced convictions about the guilt of the university
appear deeply-held, and his opposition to the institution
in its present form seems implacable. We believe him
when he expresses his regret that his role in converting
the university to "serve the people" is restricted by
practical reasons to advocacy rather than action. "Re
habilitation" might appear to Professor Franklin as a
highly unfair mandate to change his convictions. Barring

a dramatic change in perception he is unlikely to change
his conduct; thus "rehabilitation" is likely to fail, what
ever the sanction.
It can be argued in contrast that the deterring func
tion of penalty has real force. By setting a price on
proscribed conduct, the university can make its members
consider carefully the line that separates forbidden from
permitted speech and action, and avoid crossing that
line. In establishing a penalty, the institution in effect
announces the degree to which it is attached to its own
values. Such an announcement insists that persons con
sidering borderline conduct must locate the border; for
wnen there is no deterrent to illegal acts, it hardly pays
to have a law.
3. The Range of Possible Sanctions. Dismissal severs
the connection between the defendant and the institu
tion; a lesser sanction assumes that a satisfactory rela
tionship between Professor Franklin and the other mem
bers of the university can be re-established. In consider
ing the appropriateness of a lesser penalty, we must thus
consider (! ) whether it will actually deter, and whether
deterrence is a reasonable expectation at all; (2) whether
it appropriately announces the institution's attachment
to the value measured.
There is no absolute way of defining the deterrent
value of penalty. Some professions (and some people)
are especially sensitive to economic sanctions, others to
censure. If that proposition is granted, a certain finding
of fact can still justify a range of penalties that differ in
kind as well as in severity. Between mere censure and
dismissal there is an intermediate range of possible sanc
tions that is populated primarily by such mechanisms as
suspension (with or without pay) and probation.
We do not hold probation to be workable. Where
such a right as tenure is involved, probation merely
challenges it authenticity; and probation is too often an

excuse for the removal of due process. Suspension is
another matter, and encompasses three kinds of sanc
tion. There is, first, the loss of privilege-to teach and to
use the full range of the academy's resources. Professor
Franklin has already suffered -irreversibly-the penalty
of suspension with pay since February 12, 1971; this is a
long time, although he has contributed substantially to
its length. Second, suspension may also involve loss of
salary. Finally, the imposition of any penalty, suspen
sion included, produces a subtle but real change in
professional status. Sanction imposed by a council of his
peers would surely detract from the offender's standing
in the academic community at large.
For all these reasons suspension without pay ranging
from one quarter upward is a substantial penalty—in
terms of financial cost, in terms of lost academic partici
pation, and in terms of lowered professional status and
consequent loss of mobility. Suspension of too great a
lenght is not practicable, because at some point the
defendent—whom we must assume to be economically
vulnerable-becomes likely to be forced into irreversible
occupational alternatives.
Dismissal is a penalty of undoubted severity because
of its absolute effect upon the immediate institutional
relationship combined with its impact upon employment
opportunities elsewhere within and even outside the
profession. The severity of dismissal as a penalty can be
softened somewhat by a financial settlement which
would permit time for the exploration of alternatives.
The more severe penalties are not in our view in
appropriately matched to the gravity of the charges.
Incitement to violent, coercive, lawless action—however
it may be modified in final judgment by any of the
factors discusses above—is a heavy attack upon the insti
tution of which Professor Franklin is a member.
A. INTRODUCTION
The University administration proposed in its state
ment of charges that Professor Franklin he dismissed,
and has argued in its response to Professor Franklin's
Motion to Dismiss Charges that dismissal would be the
appropriate penalty even if the Board sustained only one
of the last three charges (No.B—White Plaza Rally,
No.9—Computation Center Incident, No.lo—Old Union
Rally).
In the section on "Fundamental Issues and Stand
ards" of this report the Board has agreed that the pur
pose of academic due process is to establish:
1. That the stated cause is the authentic cause for dis
missal, rather than a pretense or makeweight for
considerations invading the academic freedom or or
dinary personal civil liberties of the individual;
2. that the stated cause exists in fact;
3. that the degree of demonstrated professional irres
ponsibility warrants outright termination of the indi
vidual's appointment rather than some lesser sanc
tion, even after taking into account the balance of his
entire service and the personal consequences of dis
missal.
(N. Van Alstyne, Bulletin of the American Associa
tion of University frofessors,Autumn, 1971)
In the preceding sections the Board has dealt with the
first two of these points; we now proceed to the con
tents of the third.
Professor Franklin's performance as a scholar and
teacher has not been questioned in these proceedings;
the Board ruled on this matter on October 28, 1971, in
its response to Professor Franklin's motion:
The Board requires no testimony supporting Profes
sor Franklin's exceptional competence as a scholar
and teacher His competence is not in question in this
hearing; the protections of tenure extend to all ten
ured faculty members without regard to judgments of
their relative merits.
The remaining question is thus one of appropriate
penalty, taking into account the Board's findings of fact,
the entire record, and the consequences of the sanctions
that might be imposed.
Beyond the Board's findings of fact, several elements
of the record in its entirety deserve consideration. First,
Professor Franklin is led into a pattern of conduct that
directly involves attacks upon the values of the univer
sity as now constituted, and also includes encourage
ment of violent or coercive tactics against the members
of the university community and the society of which it
is a part. Second, Professor Franklin has repeatedly
reminded the Board that he bases his actions upon a
different set of perceptions about the university and
society from those of the majority of Stanford faculty
members, including members of the Board. Such percep
tions of reality, and the convictions that emerge from
them, might provide an explanation for his conduct
which would assist the Board in its judgment. Third, the
rights of the university's entire membership not to be
disrupted by the unbridled exercise of self-proclaimed
moral conviction must be balanced against Professor
Franklin's right of political expression and action.
It is the need to balance these frequently conflicting

interests which underlies the determination of appropri
ate sanction.
B. PROFESSOR FRANKLIN S PATTERN OF
CONDUCT
From the viewpoint of most Stanford faculty mem
bers, who themselves are of course subject to limitations
of perception. Professor Franklin pursues a course of
action that seeks systematically to disrupt the normal
functioning of the university. Professor Franklin, on the
other hand, asserts that he is not trying to destroy the
institution, but to convert it to "serve the needs of the
people." Professor Franklin asserts that the university's
actual function is to serve as a training and research
center for the maintenance of an imperialistic hegemony
over the "Pacific Basin Empire;" yet to most of his
colleagues, that is a bizarre mischaracterization. Thus the
basis of a pattern of conduct is itself subject to con
flicting interpretations, depending upon the perception
of reality from which it is being described.
A major element in Professor Franklin's treatment of
issues in the university is an attempt to disembody the
institution from the human beings who make it up.
Characteristically, an instance of policy or action in one
area is identified and found to be unacceptable in some
respects; guilt is then globalized to the entire institution,
and it and its chief administrators are labeled as respon
sible in absolute terms. The dehumanizing process ex
tends to the treatment of the individuals so labeled: they
are characterized as "pigs," "fascists," "lackeys," and
the like.
The essential feature of the confrontation with the
institution involves a call to coercive or violent action,
based upon indignation generated by the particular issue
raised. In such calls, however, Professor Franklin has
been careful to limit his own role to that of advocate
rather than participant. He has said that he does not
wish to compromise his own position as a tenured mem
ber of the Stanford faculty, feeling that he is more
valuable to the "movement" because of that status than,
for example, is a student. For this reason he has stated
that he avoids participating directly in disruptions, illegal
occupations of buildings, and the like. For the same
reason one may presume that he also attempts to avoid
direct incitement; he does, however, acknowledge and
praise violent conduct when it is carried out by others—
as when lie says in his affidavit:
. . .1 have the right to voice public approval of the
fragging of officers in Vietnam and the breaking of
windows at Stanford University. In fact, I am
ashamed to admit that I have not engaged in any of
these activities, nor incited, counselled, advised or
urged others to do so. So I find myself in the
awkward position of defending myself against allega
tions of things which I have not done but perhaps I
should have done.
In this way, encouragement is given to persons who
share Professor Franklin's views about the nature of the
university to engage in illegal acts in which he is not
willing to engage. This influence extends not only to
members of the "movement," but also to non-members
who are in general sympathy with a number of the
causes for which Professor Franklin is an advocate. The
alleviation of poverty, an end to the war in Southeast
Asia, and more rapid progress toward social justice are
all goals with which the majority of Stanford students
and faculty members are in sympathy. In supporting
these causes from his particular political stance, Profes
sor Franklin forcefully remonstrates that the university
is a primary agent of injustice in order to focus protest
action on the university itself. To dramatize the institu
tion's complicity, a variety of immediate issues may
serve; these may present themselves as targets of oppor
tunity based on the vulnerability of the institution, on
the time scale of university decision-making, on adminis
trative errors, or on genuine failure on the part of the
university to do what it said it would or what it should
have done.
The events leading up to February 10th provide an
illustration of the use of a target of opportunity. The
running on the computer of an SRI program entitled
"Gamut-H", allegedly having direct application to am
phibious assault operations in the Vietnam war, was
coupled to the general mood of anger on the campus
about the Laotian invasion. Indeed it emerged in testi
mony that the local issue-Gamut-H—had been stored
for the tactically useful moment; it had been known to
members of the "movement," though apparently not to
Professor Franklin, for at least a week before the
Laotian invassion. The existence of that program was
proclaimed to be a major basis for selection of the
Computation Center as a target for occupation
although the urgency of the demands for remedial action
contrasted oddly with the fact that the "movement" had
been willing to introduce substantial delays while
seeking the tactically opportune moment for releasing its
information. The circumstances also reveal a typical fail
ure to use alternative, non-coercive channels for securing
the same objective. If a professor feels that such
channels are ineffective, he can be instrumental in
creating new means of legitimate problem-solving
withing the university. The violent episodes in which
Professor Franklin played a role represent by no means a
"last resort" effort after non-coercive possibilities have
been exhausted.
Even such a brief description as the above indicates
that the pattern of conduct of Professor Franklin and
other members of the "movement" contains paradoxical
elements that are subject to varying interpretations.
What may appear to his following to be a sincere con
cern with issues of domestic and international injustice
and a zeal to make the university more useful to society
will appear to others to be an instance of cynical mani
pulation to achieve ends—tactics that contrast vividly
with the ideals on behalf of which they are invoked.
Such a stance, in which a member of the faculty
wishes to encourage violence against the university but
also wishes to fall short of actual incitement to or
participation in such violence, leads inevitably to covert
or ambiguous recommendations. On the one hand, Pro
fessor Franklin attempts to stay on the permissible side
of conduct, in order to preserve his position; on the
other hand, he hopes that illegal acts will come about
and wants to do what he can within the law to encour
age them. Such tactics become particularly effective in
ecalating an already inflamed series of events.
The demonstrated existence of this pattern of con
duct could be used in either of two ways in constructing
an argument concerning penalty. His stated intention of
"going right up to the line" might be taken as evidence
of his awareness of that line, and his consequent deter
mination not to violate it. However, continuous probing
of the university's will to enforce its rules might lead to
a high likelihood of future transgressions, quite apart
form the Board's findings of fact on the current charges.
C. DIFFERING PERCEPTIONS OF REALITY
Balanced against this pattern of conduct, and in part
responsible for it, is a perception of reality which Profes
sor Franklin and his followers profess to share which
differs drastically from the consensus in the university.
In his opening argument Professor Franklin proclaimed
deep convictions about the evils of American foreign and
domestic policy and about the inevitable influences of
our socio-economic system in shaping that policy. Essen
tial to this perception is a mistrust of the allegedly
intricate interrelationship between the economic power
of American's "ruling class" and the maintenance of
policies that are imperialistic abroad and oppressive at
home. Of crucial importance in the present case is his
expressed view that the university, run by and for this
ruling class, possesses a substantial institutional guilt for
the ongoing prosecution of those policies. Consequently
he sees no way to disengage American foreign imperia
lism and domestic oppression from the impetus and
support given to those policies by the university.
The outcome of this perception of reality is a convic
tion that the situation must be radically changed-by
persuasion if that is possible and by violence if persua
sion is unavailing. The university becomes the most
immediate and obvious target for such action. Since
Professor Franklin maintains that the class interests of
those with power in the university make it inlikely that
they will engage in more than token gestures of reform,
he sees coercive tactics, which can include violence, as
most likely to produce the changes he desires.
In response to those who claim to abhor violence on
campus, Professor Franklin replies that the university, as
an integral part of the capitalistic system, is itself sys
tematically engaged in the support of violence-a vio
lence that is sometimes very open and apparent, as in
Vietnam or in police oppression in the ghettos, but is
often hidden yet none the less devastating in the econo
mic oppression that is exercised domestically against
minority groups and internationally against Third World
nations. Because of the university's complicity in this
range of violent activities. Professor Franklin maintains
that it is not only appropriate but necessary (taking
tactical considerations into account) to engage in such
acts of violence against the university as can lead it in
the direction of far-reaching reorganization, "to serve
the needs of the people" and not of the privileged few.
This results in the pattern of conduct described in the
preceding section.
Despite the strident, opportunistic, and aggressive be
havior which is in part caused by these perceptions, the
Board affirms that the university must not only tolerate,
but must actively foster, the widest range of opinions
possible. We realize that any perception of reality can be
challenged, stretched and revised by the competing views
with which it comes into vigorous contact and debate on
the university campus. We are committed to the princi
ple that in the competing marketplace of ideas truth can
make it without cheating that is, that in the competi
tion of conflicting perceptions of reality truth can sur
vive without resort to the stilling of dissent. We must
engage, and have tried to engage, in "the willing suspen
sion of disbelief," so as to enter as sympathetically as

possible into the perception of reality espoused by Pro
fessor Franklin. Such matters as conviction, motivation
and rationale are important determinants in the assess
ment of penalty, even though they may not enter direc
tly into findings of fact.
D. THE CONFLICTING RIGHTS
There are special reasons for the exercise of caution
in the application of sanctions in this case. First, loss of
tenure is at risk. We need hardly review here the signifi
cance of tenure; it is not merely a protection of the
individual against unwarranted attacks from the institu
tion from outside political forces. Tenure thus protects
freedom for the full range of scholarly inquiry, and both
the institution and the individual have a large stake in its
continued good health. At the same time, it exacts from
the tenured faculty member obligations of performance
and conduct.
Second, the impoverished state of "case law" for
academic proceedings of this sort gives great weight to
the outcome of the present case. There is much to be
said for caution in ground-breaking. Yet caution
demands regard both for the rights of the individual and
of the institution.
The rights of the individual must be balanced and
judged in relation to the rights of others having different
perceptions, and to the rights of the entire university
community to function and to survive as a center of
unregimented thought. However, the expression of
dee ply-held convictions of one who affirms a minority
perception of reality should not be denied merely be
cause the majority feels more comfortable when not
confronted by challenge.
In dealing with the rights of the institution, it must
be recognized that the university is not the all-powerful
monolith its attackers at times pretend it is. It is an
institution thriving on decentralized initiative, with a
central administration that has limited power but in
creasing responsibilities. There is a real danger that
ignoring the rights of the institution in order to safe
guard the rights of the individual faculty member may
have a result opposite from that intended: it may lead to
more attacks on the rights of other faculty members and
more, rather than less, concentration of administrative
authority. In a very real sense the university is the
totality of its constituents-damage suffered by the uni
versity works directly to the detriment of its individual
members.
There is thus a needed balance among three interests:
those of the faculty member accused, those of the other
members of the academic community, and those of the
university as an institution. But there is a fundamental
consequence of this balance of rights. While it is the
consensus within the university that it should have room
for the widest possible range of perceptions and expres
sion, the university says in fact to its members: "You
may preach and also practice.. .but only up to a certain
point."
The latter edict is not aimed exclusively at those on
the far political left, who often complain that they are
the only ones being discriminated against when told that
a theoretical espousal of their position is permitted so
long as it does not spill over into action. It is also applied
at many other points along the socio-politico-economic
spectrum within the academic community. For instance,
the university protects the right of a professor to
espouse views that suggest a demeaning relationship
between racial background and intelligence, but it would
not perrrut him to organize a forcible attempt to prevent
the Admissions Office from accepting black applicants.
It would allow a fascist professor to advocate abolition
of democratic processes, but would not let him interfere
with the conduct of university exercises dedicated
toward the exposition of democratic institutions.
Common to these examples is the institutional decision
that while those further toward the center of the politi
cal spectrum may practice what they preach, those at its
extremes may preach but are limited in their practice.
From Professor Franklin's viewpoint, this is an unfair
asymmetry. The majority of the community would
point out that in any even-handed balancing of rights,
the encouragement of violence constitutes an infringe
ment; to Professor Franklin the balancing of rights
appears insufficiently global. Because he makes the need
for incitement a political credo, a prosecution for the
advocacy of imminent lawless action becomes to him a
political persecution.
These descriptions do not solve the problem; they
only help to identity it. We cannot simultaneously re
dedicate the university to a specific political goal—by
using force or violence if necessary—and at the same
time preserve it as an institution in which independent
initiative from many quarters can have the widest possi
ble play. A choice must be made and we choose the
latter. Yet having made this choice, the university can
contemplate punishment of action—and most especially,
of speech—only when the rights claimed by the dissi
dents seriously infringe those of other groups or individ
uals within the university. Punishment should follow
only when strongly persuasive evidence has been devel
oped that such infringement has actually occured.
E. GUIDELINES FOR SEVERITY OF SANCTION
1. Modifying Circumstances. On the basis of the
above considerations we are prepared to consider as
mitigating issues of motivation, overriding necessity, and
a variety of factors that may be understandable within
Professor Franklin's framework of convictions but not
within our own or those of most of our colleagues. At
the same time we are prepared to consider as justifica
tion for a relatively more severe penality a pattern of
conduct which systematically threatens the university as
an institution in which decentralized individual initiative
can have the widest possible range.
However, within this balanced input we believe that,
in case of doubt, those criteria that are external to the
factual fabric of the charges should be applied asym
metrically in favor of the defendent, since (1) such
matters were not taken into account in findings of fact,
(2) the perceptions of reality held by the Board are
generally more shared with those of the Administration
than with those of Professor Franklin.
2. The Purpose of Sanction. The purpose of sanction
can be to retaliate, to rehabilitate, or to deter further
violations. We hope that in a university setting only the
last two deserve consideration; and we must ask what
importance to attach to each.
We are highly dubious whether rehabilitation is a
useful concept in this case. Professor Franklin's an
nounced convictions about the guilt of the university
appear deeply-held, and his opposition to the institution
in its present form seems implacable. We believe him
when he expresses his regret that his role in converting
the university to "serve the people" is restricted by
practical reasons to advocacy rather than action. "Re
habilitation" might appear to Professor Franklin as a
highly unfair mandate to change his convictions. Barring

a dramatic change in perception he is unlikely to change
his conduct; thus "rehabilitation" is likely to fail, what
ever the sanction.
It can be argued in contrast that the deterring func
tion of penalty has real force. By setting a price on
proscribed conduct, the university can make its members
consider carefully the line that separates forbidden from
permitted speech and action, and avoid crossing that
line. In establishing a penalty, the institution in effect
announces the degree to which it is attached to its own
values. Such an announcement insists that persons con
sidering borderline conduct must locate the border; for
wnen there is no deterrent to illegal acts, it hardly pays
to have a law.
3. The Range of Possible Sanctions. Dismissal severs
the connection between the defendant and the institu
tion; a lesser sanction assumes that a satisfactory rela
tionship between Professor Franklin and the other mem
bers of the university can be re-established. In consider
ing the appropriateness of a lesser penalty, we must thus
consider (! ) whether it will actually deter, and whether
deterrence is a reasonable expectation at all; (2) whether
it appropriately announces the institution's attachment
to the value measured.
There is no absolute way of defining the deterrent
value of penalty. Some professions (and some people)
are especially sensitive to economic sanctions, others to
censure. If that proposition is granted, a certain finding
of fact can still justify a range of penalties that differ in
kind as well as in severity. Between mere censure and
dismissal there is an intermediate range of possible sanc
tions that is populated primarily by such mechanisms as
suspension (with or without pay) and probation.
We do not hold probation to be workable. Where
such a right as tenure is involved, probation merely
challenges it authenticity; and probation is too often an

excuse for the removal of due process. Suspension is
another matter, and encompasses three kinds of sanc
tion. There is, first, the loss of privilege-to teach and to
use the full range of the academy's resources. Professor
Franklin has already suffered -irreversibly-the penalty
of suspension with pay since February 12, 1971; this is a
long time, although he has contributed substantially to
its length. Second, suspension may also involve loss of
salary. Finally, the imposition of any penalty, suspen
sion included, produces a subtle but real change in
professional status. Sanction imposed by a council of his
peers would surely detract from the offender's standing
in the academic community at large.
For all these reasons suspension without pay ranging
from one quarter upward is a substantial penalty—in
terms of financial cost, in terms of lost academic partici
pation, and in terms of lowered professional status and
consequent loss of mobility. Suspension of too great a
lenght is not practicable, because at some point the
defendent—whom we must assume to be economically
vulnerable-becomes likely to be forced into irreversible
occupational alternatives.
Dismissal is a penalty of undoubted severity because
of its absolute effect upon the immediate institutional
relationship combined with its impact upon employment
opportunities elsewhere within and even outside the
profession. The severity of dismissal as a penalty can be
softened somewhat by a financial settlement which
would permit time for the exploration of alternatives.
The more severe penalties are not in our view in
appropriately matched to the gravity of the charges.
Incitement to violent, coercive, lawless action—however
it may be modified in final judgment by any of the
factors discusses above—is a heavy attack upon the insti
tution of which Professor Franklin is a member.
A. INTRODUCTION
The University administration proposed in its state
ment of charges that Professor Franklin he dismissed,
and has argued in its response to Professor Franklin's
Motion to Dismiss Charges that dismissal would be the
appropriate penalty even if the Board sustained only one
of the last three charges (No.B—White Plaza Rally,
No.9—Computation Center Incident, No.lo—Old Union
Rally).
In the section on "Fundamental Issues and Stand
ards" of this report the Board has agreed that the pur
pose of academic due process is to establish:
1. That the stated cause is the authentic cause for dis
missal, rather than a pretense or makeweight for
considerations invading the academic freedom or or
dinary personal civil liberties of the individual;
2. that the stated cause exists in fact;
3. that the degree of demonstrated professional irres
ponsibility warrants outright termination of the indi
vidual's appointment rather than some lesser sanc
tion, even after taking into account the balance of his
entire service and the personal consequences of dis
missal.
(N. Van Alstyne, Bulletin of the American Associa
tion of University frofessors,Autumn, 1971)
In the preceding sections the Board has dealt with the
first two of these points; we now proceed to the con
tents of the third.
Professor Franklin's performance as a scholar and
teacher has not been questioned in these proceedings;
the Board ruled on this matter on October 28, 1971, in
its response to Professor Franklin's motion:
The Board requires no testimony supporting Profes
sor Franklin's exceptional competence as a scholar
and teacher His competence is not in question in this
hearing; the protections of tenure extend to all ten
ured faculty members without regard to judgments of
their relative merits.
The remaining question is thus one of appropriate
penalty, taking into account the Board's findings of fact,
the entire record, and the consequences of the sanctions
that might be imposed.
Beyond the Board's findings of fact, several elements
of the record in its entirety deserve consideration. First,
Professor Franklin is led into a pattern of conduct that
directly involves attacks upon the values of the univer
sity as now constituted, and also includes encourage
ment of violent or coercive tactics against the members
of the university community and the society of which it
is a part. Second, Professor Franklin has repeatedly
reminded the Board that he bases his actions upon a
different set of perceptions about the university and
society from those of the majority of Stanford faculty
members, including members of the Board. Such percep
tions of reality, and the convictions that emerge from
them, might provide an explanation for his conduct
which would assist the Board in its judgment. Third, the
rights of the university's entire membership not to be
disrupted by the unbridled exercise of self-proclaimed
moral conviction must be balanced against Professor
Franklin's right of political expression and action.
It is the need to balance these frequently conflicting

interests which underlies the determination of appropri
ate sanction.
B. PROFESSOR FRANKLIN S PATTERN OF
CONDUCT
From the viewpoint of most Stanford faculty mem
bers, who themselves are of course subject to limitations
of perception. Professor Franklin pursues a course of
action that seeks systematically to disrupt the normal
functioning of the university. Professor Franklin, on the
other hand, asserts that he is not trying to destroy the
institution, but to convert it to "serve the needs of the
people." Professor Franklin asserts that the university's
actual function is to serve as a training and research
center for the maintenance of an imperialistic hegemony
over the "Pacific Basin Empire;" yet to most of his
colleagues, that is a bizarre mischaracterization. Thus the
basis of a pattern of conduct is itself subject to con
flicting interpretations, depending upon the perception
of reality from which it is being described.
A major element in Professor Franklin's treatment of
issues in the university is an attempt to disembody the
institution from the human beings who make it up.
Characteristically, an instance of policy or action in one
area is identified and found to be unacceptable in some
respects; guilt is then globalized to the entire institution,
and it and its chief administrators are labeled as respon
sible in absolute terms. The dehumanizing process ex
tends to the treatment of the individuals so labeled: they
are characterized as "pigs," "fascists," "lackeys," and
the like.
The essential feature of the confrontation with the
institution involves a call to coercive or violent action,
based upon indignation generated by the particular issue
raised. In such calls, however, Professor Franklin has
been careful to limit his own role to that of advocate
rather than participant. He has said that he does not
wish to compromise his own position as a tenured mem
ber of the Stanford faculty, feeling that he is more
valuable to the "movement" because of that status than,
for example, is a student. For this reason he has stated
that he avoids participating directly in disruptions, illegal
occupations of buildings, and the like. For the same
reason one may presume that he also attempts to avoid
direct incitement; he does, however, acknowledge and
praise violent conduct when it is carried out by others—
as when lie says in his affidavit:
. . .1 have the right to voice public approval of the
fragging of officers in Vietnam and the breaking of
windows at Stanford University. In fact, I am
ashamed to admit that I have not engaged in any of
these activities, nor incited, counselled, advised or
urged others to do so. So I find myself in the
awkward position of defending myself against allega
tions of things which I have not done but perhaps I
should have done.
In this way, encouragement is given to persons who
share Professor Franklin's views about the nature of the
university to engage in illegal acts in which he is not
willing to engage. This influence extends not only to
members of the "movement," but also to non-members
who are in general sympathy with a number of the
causes for which Professor Franklin is an advocate. The
alleviation of poverty, an end to the war in Southeast
Asia, and more rapid progress toward social justice are
all goals with which the majority of Stanford students
and faculty members are in sympathy. In supporting
these causes from his particular political stance, Profes
sor Franklin forcefully remonstrates that the university
is a primary agent of injustice in order to focus protest
action on the university itself. To dramatize the institu
tion's complicity, a variety of immediate issues may
serve; these may present themselves as targets of oppor
tunity based on the vulnerability of the institution, on
the time scale of university decision-making, on adminis
trative errors, or on genuine failure on the part of the
university to do what it said it would or what it should
have done.
The events leading up to February 10th provide an
illustration of the use of a target of opportunity. The
running on the computer of an SRI program entitled
"Gamut-H", allegedly having direct application to am
phibious assault operations in the Vietnam war, was
coupled to the general mood of anger on the campus
about the Laotian invasion. Indeed it emerged in testi
mony that the local issue-Gamut-H—had been stored
for the tactically useful moment; it had been known to
members of the "movement," though apparently not to
Professor Franklin, for at least a week before the
Laotian invassion. The existence of that program was
proclaimed to be a major basis for selection of the
Computation Center as a target for occupation
although the urgency of the demands for remedial action
contrasted oddly with the fact that the "movement" had
been willing to introduce substantial delays while
seeking the tactically opportune moment for releasing its
information. The circumstances also reveal a typical fail
ure to use alternative, non-coercive channels for securing
the same objective. If a professor feels that such
channels are ineffective, he can be instrumental in
creating new means of legitimate problem-solving
withing the university. The violent episodes in which
Professor Franklin played a role represent by no means a
"last resort" effort after non-coercive possibilities have
been exhausted.
Even such a brief description as the above indicates
that the pattern of conduct of Professor Franklin and
other members of the "movement" contains paradoxical
elements that are subject to varying interpretations.
What may appear to his following to be a sincere con
cern with issues of domestic and international injustice
and a zeal to make the university more useful to society
will appear to others to be an instance of cynical mani
pulation to achieve ends—tactics that contrast vividly
with the ideals on behalf of which they are invoked.
Such a stance, in which a member of the faculty
wishes to encourage violence against the university but
also wishes to fall short of actual incitement to or
participation in such violence, leads inevitably to covert
or ambiguous recommendations. On the one hand, Pro
fessor Franklin attempts to stay on the permissible side
of conduct, in order to preserve his position; on the
other hand, he hopes that illegal acts will come about
and wants to do what he can within the law to encour
age them. Such tactics become particularly effective in
ecalating an already inflamed series of events.
The demonstrated existence of this pattern of con
duct could be used in either of two ways in constructing
an argument concerning penalty. His stated intention of
"going right up to the line" might be taken as evidence
of his awareness of that line, and his consequent deter
mination not to violate it. However, continuous probing
of the university's will to enforce its rules might lead to
a high likelihood of future transgressions, quite apart
form the Board's findings of fact on the current charges.
C. DIFFERING PERCEPTIONS OF REALITY
Balanced against this pattern of conduct, and in part
responsible for it, is a perception of reality which Profes
sor Franklin and his followers profess to share which
differs drastically from the consensus in the university.
In his opening argument Professor Franklin proclaimed
deep convictions about the evils of American foreign and
domestic policy and about the inevitable influences of
our socio-economic system in shaping that policy. Essen
tial to this perception is a mistrust of the allegedly
intricate interrelationship between the economic power
of American's "ruling class" and the maintenance of
policies that are imperialistic abroad and oppressive at
home. Of crucial importance in the present case is his
expressed view that the university, run by and for this
ruling class, possesses a substantial institutional guilt for
the ongoing prosecution of those policies. Consequently
he sees no way to disengage American foreign imperia
lism and domestic oppression from the impetus and
support given to those policies by the university.
The outcome of this perception of reality is a convic
tion that the situation must be radically changed-by
persuasion if that is possible and by violence if persua
sion is unavailing. The university becomes the most
immediate and obvious target for such action. Since
Professor Franklin maintains that the class interests of
those with power in the university make it inlikely that
they will engage in more than token gestures of reform,
he sees coercive tactics, which can include violence, as
most likely to produce the changes he desires.
In response to those who claim to abhor violence on
campus, Professor Franklin replies that the university, as
an integral part of the capitalistic system, is itself sys
tematically engaged in the support of violence-a vio
lence that is sometimes very open and apparent, as in
Vietnam or in police oppression in the ghettos, but is
often hidden yet none the less devastating in the econo
mic oppression that is exercised domestically against
minority groups and internationally against Third World
nations. Because of the university's complicity in this
range of violent activities. Professor Franklin maintains
that it is not only appropriate but necessary (taking
tactical considerations into account) to engage in such
acts of violence against the university as can lead it in
the direction of far-reaching reorganization, "to serve
the needs of the people" and not of the privileged few.
This results in the pattern of conduct described in the
preceding section.
Despite the strident, opportunistic, and aggressive be
havior which is in part caused by these perceptions, the
Board affirms that the university must not only tolerate,
but must actively foster, the widest range of opinions
possible. We realize that any perception of reality can be
challenged, stretched and revised by the competing views
with which it comes into vigorous contact and debate on
the university campus. We are committed to the princi
ple that in the competing marketplace of ideas truth can
make it without cheating that is, that in the competi
tion of conflicting perceptions of reality truth can sur
vive without resort to the stilling of dissent. We must
engage, and have tried to engage, in "the willing suspen
sion of disbelief," so as to enter as sympathetically as

possible into the perception of reality espoused by Pro
fessor Franklin. Such matters as conviction, motivation
and rationale are important determinants in the assess
ment of penalty, even though they may not enter direc
tly into findings of fact.
D. THE CONFLICTING RIGHTS
There are special reasons for the exercise of caution
in the application of sanctions in this case. First, loss of
tenure is at risk. We need hardly review here the signifi
cance of tenure; it is not merely a protection of the
individual against unwarranted attacks from the institu
tion from outside political forces. Tenure thus protects
freedom for the full range of scholarly inquiry, and both
the institution and the individual have a large stake in its
continued good health. At the same time, it exacts from
the tenured faculty member obligations of performance
and conduct.
Second, the impoverished state of "case law" for
academic proceedings of this sort gives great weight to
the outcome of the present case. There is much to be
said for caution in ground-breaking. Yet caution
demands regard both for the rights of the individual and
of the institution.
The rights of the individual must be balanced and
judged in relation to the rights of others having different
perceptions, and to the rights of the entire university
community to function and to survive as a center of
unregimented thought. However, the expression of
dee ply-held convictions of one who affirms a minority
perception of reality should not be denied merely be
cause the majority feels more comfortable when not
confronted by challenge.
In dealing with the rights of the institution, it must
be recognized that the university is not the all-powerful
monolith its attackers at times pretend it is. It is an
institution thriving on decentralized initiative, with a
central administration that has limited power but in
creasing responsibilities. There is a real danger that
ignoring the rights of the institution in order to safe
guard the rights of the individual faculty member may
have a result opposite from that intended: it may lead to
more attacks on the rights of other faculty members and
more, rather than less, concentration of administrative
authority. In a very real sense the university is the
totality of its constituents-damage suffered by the uni
versity works directly to the detriment of its individual
members.
There is thus a needed balance among three interests:
those of the faculty member accused, those of the other
members of the academic community, and those of the
university as an institution. But there is a fundamental
consequence of this balance of rights. While it is the
consensus within the university that it should have room
for the widest possible range of perceptions and expres
sion, the university says in fact to its members: "You
may preach and also practice.. .but only up to a certain
point."
The latter edict is not aimed exclusively at those on
the far political left, who often complain that they are
the only ones being discriminated against when told that
a theoretical espousal of their position is permitted so
long as it does not spill over into action. It is also applied
at many other points along the socio-politico-economic
spectrum within the academic community. For instance,
the university protects the right of a professor to
espouse views that suggest a demeaning relationship
between racial background and intelligence, but it would
not perrrut him to organize a forcible attempt to prevent
the Admissions Office from accepting black applicants.
It would allow a fascist professor to advocate abolition
of democratic processes, but would not let him interfere
with the conduct of university exercises dedicated
toward the exposition of democratic institutions.
Common to these examples is the institutional decision
that while those further toward the center of the politi
cal spectrum may practice what they preach, those at its
extremes may preach but are limited in their practice.
From Professor Franklin's viewpoint, this is an unfair
asymmetry. The majority of the community would
point out that in any even-handed balancing of rights,
the encouragement of violence constitutes an infringe
ment; to Professor Franklin the balancing of rights
appears insufficiently global. Because he makes the need
for incitement a political credo, a prosecution for the
advocacy of imminent lawless action becomes to him a
political persecution.
These descriptions do not solve the problem; they
only help to identity it. We cannot simultaneously re
dedicate the university to a specific political goal—by
using force or violence if necessary—and at the same
time preserve it as an institution in which independent
initiative from many quarters can have the widest possi
ble play. A choice must be made and we choose the
latter. Yet having made this choice, the university can
contemplate punishment of action—and most especially,
of speech—only when the rights claimed by the dissi
dents seriously infringe those of other groups or individ
uals within the university. Punishment should follow
only when strongly persuasive evidence has been devel
oped that such infringement has actually occured.
E. GUIDELINES FOR SEVERITY OF SANCTION
1. Modifying Circumstances. On the basis of the
above considerations we are prepared to consider as
mitigating issues of motivation, overriding necessity, and
a variety of factors that may be understandable within
Professor Franklin's framework of convictions but not
within our own or those of most of our colleagues. At
the same time we are prepared to consider as justifica
tion for a relatively more severe penality a pattern of
conduct which systematically threatens the university as
an institution in which decentralized individual initiative
can have the widest possible range.
However, within this balanced input we believe that,
in case of doubt, those criteria that are external to the
factual fabric of the charges should be applied asym
metrically in favor of the defendent, since (1) such
matters were not taken into account in findings of fact,
(2) the perceptions of reality held by the Board are
generally more shared with those of the Administration
than with those of Professor Franklin.
2. The Purpose of Sanction. The purpose of sanction
can be to retaliate, to rehabilitate, or to deter further
violations. We hope that in a university setting only the
last two deserve consideration; and we must ask what
importance to attach to each.
We are highly dubious whether rehabilitation is a
useful concept in this case. Professor Franklin's an
nounced convictions about the guilt of the university
appear deeply-held, and his opposition to the institution
in its present form seems implacable. We believe him
when he expresses his regret that his role in converting
the university to "serve the people" is restricted by
practical reasons to advocacy rather than action. "Re
habilitation" might appear to Professor Franklin as a
highly unfair mandate to change his convictions. Barring

a dramatic change in perception he is unlikely to change
his conduct; thus "rehabilitation" is likely to fail, what
ever the sanction.
It can be argued in contrast that the deterring func
tion of penalty has real force. By setting a price on
proscribed conduct, the university can make its members
consider carefully the line that separates forbidden from
permitted speech and action, and avoid crossing that
line. In establishing a penalty, the institution in effect
announces the degree to which it is attached to its own
values. Such an announcement insists that persons con
sidering borderline conduct must locate the border; for
wnen there is no deterrent to illegal acts, it hardly pays
to have a law.
3. The Range of Possible Sanctions. Dismissal severs
the connection between the defendant and the institu
tion; a lesser sanction assumes that a satisfactory rela
tionship between Professor Franklin and the other mem
bers of the university can be re-established. In consider
ing the appropriateness of a lesser penalty, we must thus
consider (! ) whether it will actually deter, and whether
deterrence is a reasonable expectation at all; (2) whether
it appropriately announces the institution's attachment
to the value measured.
There is no absolute way of defining the deterrent
value of penalty. Some professions (and some people)
are especially sensitive to economic sanctions, others to
censure. If that proposition is granted, a certain finding
of fact can still justify a range of penalties that differ in
kind as well as in severity. Between mere censure and
dismissal there is an intermediate range of possible sanc
tions that is populated primarily by such mechanisms as
suspension (with or without pay) and probation.
We do not hold probation to be workable. Where
such a right as tenure is involved, probation merely
challenges it authenticity; and probation is too often an

excuse for the removal of due process. Suspension is
another matter, and encompasses three kinds of sanc
tion. There is, first, the loss of privilege-to teach and to
use the full range of the academy's resources. Professor
Franklin has already suffered -irreversibly-the penalty
of suspension with pay since February 12, 1971; this is a
long time, although he has contributed substantially to
its length. Second, suspension may also involve loss of
salary. Finally, the imposition of any penalty, suspen
sion included, produces a subtle but real change in
professional status. Sanction imposed by a council of his
peers would surely detract from the offender's standing
in the academic community at large.
For all these reasons suspension without pay ranging
from one quarter upward is a substantial penalty—in
terms of financial cost, in terms of lost academic partici
pation, and in terms of lowered professional status and
consequent loss of mobility. Suspension of too great a
lenght is not practicable, because at some point the
defendent—whom we must assume to be economically
vulnerable-becomes likely to be forced into irreversible
occupational alternatives.
Dismissal is a penalty of undoubted severity because
of its absolute effect upon the immediate institutional
relationship combined with its impact upon employment
opportunities elsewhere within and even outside the
profession. The severity of dismissal as a penalty can be
softened somewhat by a financial settlement which
would permit time for the exploration of alternatives.
The more severe penalties are not in our view in
appropriately matched to the gravity of the charges.
Incitement to violent, coercive, lawless action—however
it may be modified in final judgment by any of the
factors discusses above—is a heavy attack upon the insti
tution of which Professor Franklin is a member.
A. INTRODUCTION
The University administration proposed in its state
ment of charges that Professor Franklin he dismissed,
and has argued in its response to Professor Franklin's
Motion to Dismiss Charges that dismissal would be the
appropriate penalty even if the Board sustained only one
of the last three charges (No.B—White Plaza Rally,
No.9—Computation Center Incident, No.lo—Old Union
Rally).
In the section on "Fundamental Issues and Stand
ards" of this report the Board has agreed that the pur
pose of academic due process is to establish:
1. That the stated cause is the authentic cause for dis
missal, rather than a pretense or makeweight for
considerations invading the academic freedom or or
dinary personal civil liberties of the individual;
2. that the stated cause exists in fact;
3. that the degree of demonstrated professional irres
ponsibility warrants outright termination of the indi
vidual's appointment rather than some lesser sanc
tion, even after taking into account the balance of his
entire service and the personal consequences of dis
missal.
(N. Van Alstyne, Bulletin of the American Associa
tion of University frofessors,Autumn, 1971)
In the preceding sections the Board has dealt with the
first two of these points; we now proceed to the con
tents of the third.
Professor Franklin's performance as a scholar and
teacher has not been questioned in these proceedings;
the Board ruled on this matter on October 28, 1971, in
its response to Professor Franklin's motion:
The Board requires no testimony supporting Profes
sor Franklin's exceptional competence as a scholar
and teacher His competence is not in question in this
hearing; the protections of tenure extend to all ten
ured faculty members without regard to judgments of
their relative merits.
The remaining question is thus one of appropriate
penalty, taking into account the Board's findings of fact,
the entire record, and the consequences of the sanctions
that might be imposed.
Beyond the Board's findings of fact, several elements
of the record in its entirety deserve consideration. First,
Professor Franklin is led into a pattern of conduct that
directly involves attacks upon the values of the univer
sity as now constituted, and also includes encourage
ment of violent or coercive tactics against the members
of the university community and the society of which it
is a part. Second, Professor Franklin has repeatedly
reminded the Board that he bases his actions upon a
different set of perceptions about the university and
society from those of the majority of Stanford faculty
members, including members of the Board. Such percep
tions of reality, and the convictions that emerge from
them, might provide an explanation for his conduct
which would assist the Board in its judgment. Third, the
rights of the university's entire membership not to be
disrupted by the unbridled exercise of self-proclaimed
moral conviction must be balanced against Professor
Franklin's right of political expression and action.
It is the need to balance these frequently conflicting

interests which underlies the determination of appropri
ate sanction.
B. PROFESSOR FRANKLIN S PATTERN OF
CONDUCT
From the viewpoint of most Stanford faculty mem
bers, who themselves are of course subject to limitations
of perception. Professor Franklin pursues a course of
action that seeks systematically to disrupt the normal
functioning of the university. Professor Franklin, on the
other hand, asserts that he is not trying to destroy the
institution, but to convert it to "serve the needs of the
people." Professor Franklin asserts that the university's
actual function is to serve as a training and research
center for the maintenance of an imperialistic hegemony
over the "Pacific Basin Empire;" yet to most of his
colleagues, that is a bizarre mischaracterization. Thus the
basis of a pattern of conduct is itself subject to con
flicting interpretations, depending upon the perception
of reality from which it is being described.
A major element in Professor Franklin's treatment of
issues in the university is an attempt to disembody the
institution from the human beings who make it up.
Characteristically, an instance of policy or action in one
area is identified and found to be unacceptable in some
respects; guilt is then globalized to the entire institution,
and it and its chief administrators are labeled as respon
sible in absolute terms. The dehumanizing process ex
tends to the treatment of the individuals so labeled: they
are characterized as "pigs," "fascists," "lackeys," and
the like.
The essential feature of the confrontation with the
institution involves a call to coercive or violent action,
based upon indignation generated by the particular issue
raised. In such calls, however, Professor Franklin has
been careful to limit his own role to that of advocate
rather than participant. He has said that he does not
wish to compromise his own position as a tenured mem
ber of the Stanford faculty, feeling that he is more
valuable to the "movement" because of that status than,
for example, is a student. For this reason he has stated
that he avoids participating directly in disruptions, illegal
occupations of buildings, and the like. For the same
reason one may presume that he also attempts to avoid
direct incitement; he does, however, acknowledge and
praise violent conduct when it is carried out by others—
as when lie says in his affidavit:
. . .1 have the right to voice public approval of the
fragging of officers in Vietnam and the breaking of
windows at Stanford University. In fact, I am
ashamed to admit that I have not engaged in any of
these activities, nor incited, counselled, advised or
urged others to do so. So I find myself in the
awkward position of defending myself against allega
tions of things which I have not done but perhaps I
should have done.
In this way, encouragement is given to persons who
share Professor Franklin's views about the nature of the
university to engage in illegal acts in which he is not
willing to engage. This influence extends not only to
members of the "movement," but also to non-members
who are in general sympathy with a number of the
causes for which Professor Franklin is an advocate. The
alleviation of poverty, an end to the war in Southeast
Asia, and more rapid progress toward social justice are
all goals with which the majority of Stanford students
and faculty members are in sympathy. In supporting
these causes from his particular political stance, Profes
sor Franklin forcefully remonstrates that the university
is a primary agent of injustice in order to focus protest
action on the university itself. To dramatize the institu
tion's complicity, a variety of immediate issues may
serve; these may present themselves as targets of oppor
tunity based on the vulnerability of the institution, on
the time scale of university decision-making, on adminis
trative errors, or on genuine failure on the part of the
university to do what it said it would or what it should
have done.
The events leading up to February 10th provide an
illustration of the use of a target of opportunity. The
running on the computer of an SRI program entitled
"Gamut-H", allegedly having direct application to am
phibious assault operations in the Vietnam war, was
coupled to the general mood of anger on the campus
about the Laotian invasion. Indeed it emerged in testi
mony that the local issue-Gamut-H—had been stored
for the tactically useful moment; it had been known to
members of the "movement," though apparently not to
Professor Franklin, for at least a week before the
Laotian invassion. The existence of that program was
proclaimed to be a major basis for selection of the
Computation Center as a target for occupation
although the urgency of the demands for remedial action
contrasted oddly with the fact that the "movement" had
been willing to introduce substantial delays while
seeking the tactically opportune moment for releasing its
information. The circumstances also reveal a typical fail
ure to use alternative, non-coercive channels for securing
the same objective. If a professor feels that such
channels are ineffective, he can be instrumental in
creating new means of legitimate problem-solving
withing the university. The violent episodes in which
Professor Franklin played a role represent by no means a
"last resort" effort after non-coercive possibilities have
been exhausted.
Even such a brief description as the above indicates
that the pattern of conduct of Professor Franklin and
other members of the "movement" contains paradoxical
elements that are subject to varying interpretations.
What may appear to his following to be a sincere con
cern with issues of domestic and international injustice
and a zeal to make the university more useful to society
will appear to others to be an instance of cynical mani
pulation to achieve ends—tactics that contrast vividly
with the ideals on behalf of which they are invoked.
Such a stance, in which a member of the faculty
wishes to encourage violence against the university but
also wishes to fall short of actual incitement to or
participation in such violence, leads inevitably to covert
or ambiguous recommendations. On the one hand, Pro
fessor Franklin attempts to stay on the permissible side
of conduct, in order to preserve his position; on the
other hand, he hopes that illegal acts will come about
and wants to do what he can within the law to encour
age them. Such tactics become particularly effective in
ecalating an already inflamed series of events.
The demonstrated existence of this pattern of con
duct could be used in either of two ways in constructing
an argument concerning penalty. His stated intention of
"going right up to the line" might be taken as evidence
of his awareness of that line, and his consequent deter
mination not to violate it. However, continuous probing
of the university's will to enforce its rules might lead to
a high likelihood of future transgressions, quite apart
form the Board's findings of fact on the current charges.
C. DIFFERING PERCEPTIONS OF REALITY
Balanced against this pattern of conduct, and in part
responsible for it, is a perception of reality which Profes
sor Franklin and his followers profess to share which
differs drastically from the consensus in the university.
In his opening argument Professor Franklin proclaimed
deep convictions about the evils of American foreign and
domestic policy and about the inevitable influences of
our socio-economic system in shaping that policy. Essen
tial to this perception is a mistrust of the allegedly
intricate interrelationship between the economic power
of American's "ruling class" and the maintenance of
policies that are imperialistic abroad and oppressive at
home. Of crucial importance in the present case is his
expressed view that the university, run by and for this
ruling class, possesses a substantial institutional guilt for
the ongoing prosecution of those policies. Consequently
he sees no way to disengage American foreign imperia
lism and domestic oppression from the impetus and
support given to those policies by the university.
The outcome of this perception of reality is a convic
tion that the situation must be radically changed-by
persuasion if that is possible and by violence if persua
sion is unavailing. The university becomes the most
immediate and obvious target for such action. Since
Professor Franklin maintains that the class interests of
those with power in the university make it inlikely that
they will engage in more than token gestures of reform,
he sees coercive tactics, which can include violence, as
most likely to produce the changes he desires.
In response to those who claim to abhor violence on
campus, Professor Franklin replies that the university, as
an integral part of the capitalistic system, is itself sys
tematically engaged in the support of violence-a vio
lence that is sometimes very open and apparent, as in
Vietnam or in police oppression in the ghettos, but is
often hidden yet none the less devastating in the econo
mic oppression that is exercised domestically against
minority groups and internationally against Third World
nations. Because of the university's complicity in this
range of violent activities. Professor Franklin maintains
that it is not only appropriate but necessary (taking
tactical considerations into account) to engage in such
acts of violence against the university as can lead it in
the direction of far-reaching reorganization, "to serve
the needs of the people" and not of the privileged few.
This results in the pattern of conduct described in the
preceding section.
Despite the strident, opportunistic, and aggressive be
havior which is in part caused by these perceptions, the
Board affirms that the university must not only tolerate,
but must actively foster, the widest range of opinions
possible. We realize that any perception of reality can be
challenged, stretched and revised by the competing views
with which it comes into vigorous contact and debate on
the university campus. We are committed to the princi
ple that in the competing marketplace of ideas truth can
make it without cheating that is, that in the competi
tion of conflicting perceptions of reality truth can sur
vive without resort to the stilling of dissent. We must
engage, and have tried to engage, in "the willing suspen
sion of disbelief," so as to enter as sympathetically as

possible into the perception of reality espoused by Pro
fessor Franklin. Such matters as conviction, motivation
and rationale are important determinants in the assess
ment of penalty, even though they may not enter direc
tly into findings of fact.
D. THE CONFLICTING RIGHTS
There are special reasons for the exercise of caution
in the application of sanctions in this case. First, loss of
tenure is at risk. We need hardly review here the signifi
cance of tenure; it is not merely a protection of the
individual against unwarranted attacks from the institu
tion from outside political forces. Tenure thus protects
freedom for the full range of scholarly inquiry, and both
the institution and the individual have a large stake in its
continued good health. At the same time, it exacts from
the tenured faculty member obligations of performance
and conduct.
Second, the impoverished state of "case law" for
academic proceedings of this sort gives great weight to
the outcome of the present case. There is much to be
said for caution in ground-breaking. Yet caution
demands regard both for the rights of the individual and
of the institution.
The rights of the individual must be balanced and
judged in relation to the rights of others having different
perceptions, and to the rights of the entire university
community to function and to survive as a center of
unregimented thought. However, the expression of
dee ply-held convictions of one who affirms a minority
perception of reality should not be denied merely be
cause the majority feels more comfortable when not
confronted by challenge.
In dealing with the rights of the institution, it must
be recognized that the university is not the all-powerful
monolith its attackers at times pretend it is. It is an
institution thriving on decentralized initiative, with a
central administration that has limited power but in
creasing responsibilities. There is a real danger that
ignoring the rights of the institution in order to safe
guard the rights of the individual faculty member may
have a result opposite from that intended: it may lead to
more attacks on the rights of other faculty members and
more, rather than less, concentration of administrative
authority. In a very real sense the university is the
totality of its constituents-damage suffered by the uni
versity works directly to the detriment of its individual
members.
There is thus a needed balance among three interests:
those of the faculty member accused, those of the other
members of the academic community, and those of the
university as an institution. But there is a fundamental
consequence of this balance of rights. While it is the
consensus within the university that it should have room
for the widest possible range of perceptions and expres
sion, the university says in fact to its members: "You
may preach and also practice.. .but only up to a certain
point."
The latter edict is not aimed exclusively at those on
the far political left, who often complain that they are
the only ones being discriminated against when told that
a theoretical espousal of their position is permitted so
long as it does not spill over into action. It is also applied
at many other points along the socio-politico-economic
spectrum within the academic community. For instance,
the university protects the right of a professor to
espouse views that suggest a demeaning relationship
between racial background and intelligence, but it would
not perrrut him to organize a forcible attempt to prevent
the Admissions Office from accepting black applicants.
It would allow a fascist professor to advocate abolition
of democratic processes, but would not let him interfere
with the conduct of university exercises dedicated
toward the exposition of democratic institutions.
Common to these examples is the institutional decision
that while those further toward the center of the politi
cal spectrum may practice what they preach, those at its
extremes may preach but are limited in their practice.
From Professor Franklin's viewpoint, this is an unfair
asymmetry. The majority of the community would
point out that in any even-handed balancing of rights,
the encouragement of violence constitutes an infringe
ment; to Professor Franklin the balancing of rights
appears insufficiently global. Because he makes the need
for incitement a political credo, a prosecution for the
advocacy of imminent lawless action becomes to him a
political persecution.
These descriptions do not solve the problem; they
only help to identity it. We cannot simultaneously re
dedicate the university to a specific political goal—by
using force or violence if necessary—and at the same
time preserve it as an institution in which independent
initiative from many quarters can have the widest possi
ble play. A choice must be made and we choose the
latter. Yet having made this choice, the university can
contemplate punishment of action—and most especially,
of speech—only when the rights claimed by the dissi
dents seriously infringe those of other groups or individ
uals within the university. Punishment should follow
only when strongly persuasive evidence has been devel
oped that such infringement has actually occured.
E. GUIDELINES FOR SEVERITY OF SANCTION
1. Modifying Circumstances. On the basis of the
above considerations we are prepared to consider as
mitigating issues of motivation, overriding necessity, and
a variety of factors that may be understandable within
Professor Franklin's framework of convictions but not
within our own or those of most of our colleagues. At
the same time we are prepared to consider as justifica
tion for a relatively more severe penality a pattern of
conduct which systematically threatens the university as
an institution in which decentralized individual initiative
can have the widest possible range.
However, within this balanced input we believe that,
in case of doubt, those criteria that are external to the
factual fabric of the charges should be applied asym
metrically in favor of the defendent, since (1) such
matters were not taken into account in findings of fact,
(2) the perceptions of reality held by the Board are
generally more shared with those of the Administration
than with those of Professor Franklin.
2. The Purpose of Sanction. The purpose of sanction
can be to retaliate, to rehabilitate, or to deter further
violations. We hope that in a university setting only the
last two deserve consideration; and we must ask what
importance to attach to each.
We are highly dubious whether rehabilitation is a
useful concept in this case. Professor Franklin's an
nounced convictions about the guilt of the university
appear deeply-held, and his opposition to the institution
in its present form seems implacable. We believe him
when he expresses his regret that his role in converting
the university to "serve the people" is restricted by
practical reasons to advocacy rather than action. "Re
habilitation" might appear to Professor Franklin as a
highly unfair mandate to change his convictions. Barring

a dramatic change in perception he is unlikely to change
his conduct; thus "rehabilitation" is likely to fail, what
ever the sanction.
It can be argued in contrast that the deterring func
tion of penalty has real force. By setting a price on
proscribed conduct, the university can make its members
consider carefully the line that separates forbidden from
permitted speech and action, and avoid crossing that
line. In establishing a penalty, the institution in effect
announces the degree to which it is attached to its own
values. Such an announcement insists that persons con
sidering borderline conduct must locate the border; for
wnen there is no deterrent to illegal acts, it hardly pays
to have a law.
3. The Range of Possible Sanctions. Dismissal severs
the connection between the defendant and the institu
tion; a lesser sanction assumes that a satisfactory rela
tionship between Professor Franklin and the other mem
bers of the university can be re-established. In consider
ing the appropriateness of a lesser penalty, we must thus
consider (! ) whether it will actually deter, and whether
deterrence is a reasonable expectation at all; (2) whether
it appropriately announces the institution's attachment
to the value measured.
There is no absolute way of defining the deterrent
value of penalty. Some professions (and some people)
are especially sensitive to economic sanctions, others to
censure. If that proposition is granted, a certain finding
of fact can still justify a range of penalties that differ in
kind as well as in severity. Between mere censure and
dismissal there is an intermediate range of possible sanc
tions that is populated primarily by such mechanisms as
suspension (with or without pay) and probation.
We do not hold probation to be workable. Where
such a right as tenure is involved, probation merely
challenges it authenticity; and probation is too often an

excuse for the removal of due process. Suspension is
another matter, and encompasses three kinds of sanc
tion. There is, first, the loss of privilege-to teach and to
use the full range of the academy's resources. Professor
Franklin has already suffered -irreversibly-the penalty
of suspension with pay since February 12, 1971; this is a
long time, although he has contributed substantially to
its length. Second, suspension may also involve loss of
salary. Finally, the imposition of any penalty, suspen
sion included, produces a subtle but real change in
professional status. Sanction imposed by a council of his
peers would surely detract from the offender's standing
in the academic community at large.
For all these reasons suspension without pay ranging
from one quarter upward is a substantial penalty—in
terms of financial cost, in terms of lost academic partici
pation, and in terms of lowered professional status and
consequent loss of mobility. Suspension of too great a
lenght is not practicable, because at some point the
defendent—whom we must assume to be economically
vulnerable-becomes likely to be forced into irreversible
occupational alternatives.
Dismissal is a penalty of undoubted severity because
of its absolute effect upon the immediate institutional
relationship combined with its impact upon employment
opportunities elsewhere within and even outside the
profession. The severity of dismissal as a penalty can be
softened somewhat by a financial settlement which
would permit time for the exploration of alternatives.
The more severe penalties are not in our view in
appropriately matched to the gravity of the charges.
Incitement to violent, coercive, lawless action—however
it may be modified in final judgment by any of the
factors discusses above—is a heavy attack upon the insti
tution of which Professor Franklin is a member.
A. INTRODUCTION
The University administration proposed in its state
ment of charges that Professor Franklin he dismissed,
and has argued in its response to Professor Franklin's
Motion to Dismiss Charges that dismissal would be the
appropriate penalty even if the Board sustained only one
of the last three charges (No.B—White Plaza Rally,
No.9—Computation Center Incident, No.lo—Old Union
Rally).
In the section on "Fundamental Issues and Stand
ards" of this report the Board has agreed that the pur
pose of academic due process is to establish:
1. That the stated cause is the authentic cause for dis
missal, rather than a pretense or makeweight for
considerations invading the academic freedom or or
dinary personal civil liberties of the individual;
2. that the stated cause exists in fact;
3. that the degree of demonstrated professional irres
ponsibility warrants outright termination of the indi
vidual's appointment rather than some lesser sanc
tion, even after taking into account the balance of his
entire service and the personal consequences of dis
missal.
(N. Van Alstyne, Bulletin of the American Associa
tion of University frofessors,Autumn, 1971)
In the preceding sections the Board has dealt with the
first two of these points; we now proceed to the con
tents of the third.
Professor Franklin's performance as a scholar and
teacher has not been questioned in these proceedings;
the Board ruled on this matter on October 28, 1971, in
its response to Professor Franklin's motion:
The Board requires no testimony supporting Profes
sor Franklin's exceptional competence as a scholar
and teacher His competence is not in question in this
hearing; the protections of tenure extend to all ten
ured faculty members without regard to judgments of
their relative merits.
The remaining question is thus one of appropriate
penalty, taking into account the Board's findings of fact,
the entire record, and the consequences of the sanctions
that might be imposed.
Beyond the Board's findings of fact, several elements
of the record in its entirety deserve consideration. First,
Professor Franklin is led into a pattern of conduct that
directly involves attacks upon the values of the univer
sity as now constituted, and also includes encourage
ment of violent or coercive tactics against the members
of the university community and the society of which it
is a part. Second, Professor Franklin has repeatedly
reminded the Board that he bases his actions upon a
different set of perceptions about the university and
society from those of the majority of Stanford faculty
members, including members of the Board. Such percep
tions of reality, and the convictions that emerge from
them, might provide an explanation for his conduct
which would assist the Board in its judgment. Third, the
rights of the university's entire membership not to be
disrupted by the unbridled exercise of self-proclaimed
moral conviction must be balanced against Professor
Franklin's right of political expression and action.
It is the need to balance these frequently conflicting

interests which underlies the determination of appropri
ate sanction.
B. PROFESSOR FRANKLIN S PATTERN OF
CONDUCT
From the viewpoint of most Stanford faculty mem
bers, who themselves are of course subject to limitations
of perception. Professor Franklin pursues a course of
action that seeks systematically to disrupt the normal
functioning of the university. Professor Franklin, on the
other hand, asserts that he is not trying to destroy the
institution, but to convert it to "serve the needs of the
people." Professor Franklin asserts that the university's
actual function is to serve as a training and research
center for the maintenance of an imperialistic hegemony
over the "Pacific Basin Empire;" yet to most of his
colleagues, that is a bizarre mischaracterization. Thus the
basis of a pattern of conduct is itself subject to con
flicting interpretations, depending upon the perception
of reality from which it is being described.
A major element in Professor Franklin's treatment of
issues in the university is an attempt to disembody the
institution from the human beings who make it up.
Characteristically, an instance of policy or action in one
area is identified and found to be unacceptable in some
respects; guilt is then globalized to the entire institution,
and it and its chief administrators are labeled as respon
sible in absolute terms. The dehumanizing process ex
tends to the treatment of the individuals so labeled: they
are characterized as "pigs," "fascists," "lackeys," and
the like.
The essential feature of the confrontation with the
institution involves a call to coercive or violent action,
based upon indignation generated by the particular issue
raised. In such calls, however, Professor Franklin has
been careful to limit his own role to that of advocate
rather than participant. He has said that he does not
wish to compromise his own position as a tenured mem
ber of the Stanford faculty, feeling that he is more
valuable to the "movement" because of that status than,
for example, is a student. For this reason he has stated
that he avoids participating directly in disruptions, illegal
occupations of buildings, and the like. For the same
reason one may presume that he also attempts to avoid
direct incitement; he does, however, acknowledge and
praise violent conduct when it is carried out by others—
as when lie says in his affidavit:
. . .1 have the right to voice public approval of the
fragging of officers in Vietnam and the breaking of
windows at Stanford University. In fact, I am
ashamed to admit that I have not engaged in any of
these activities, nor incited, counselled, advised or
urged others to do so. So I find myself in the
awkward position of defending myself against allega
tions of things which I have not done but perhaps I
should have done.
In this way, encouragement is given to persons who
share Professor Franklin's views about the nature of the
university to engage in illegal acts in which he is not
willing to engage. This influence extends not only to
members of the "movement," but also to non-members
who are in general sympathy with a number of the
causes for which Professor Franklin is an advocate. The
alleviation of poverty, an end to the war in Southeast
Asia, and more rapid progress toward social justice are
all goals with which the majority of Stanford students
and faculty members are in sympathy. In supporting
these causes from his particular political stance, Profes
sor Franklin forcefully remonstrates that the university
is a primary agent of injustice in order to focus protest
action on the university itself. To dramatize the institu
tion's complicity, a variety of immediate issues may
serve; these may present themselves as targets of oppor
tunity based on the vulnerability of the institution, on
the time scale of university decision-making, on adminis
trative errors, or on genuine failure on the part of the
university to do what it said it would or what it should
have done.
The events leading up to February 10th provide an
illustration of the use of a target of opportunity. The
running on the computer of an SRI program entitled
"Gamut-H", allegedly having direct application to am
phibious assault operations in the Vietnam war, was
coupled to the general mood of anger on the campus
about the Laotian invasion. Indeed it emerged in testi
mony that the local issue-Gamut-H—had been stored
for the tactically useful moment; it had been known to
members of the "movement," though apparently not to
Professor Franklin, for at least a week before the
Laotian invassion. The existence of that program was
proclaimed to be a major basis for selection of the
Computation Center as a target for occupation
although the urgency of the demands for remedial action
contrasted oddly with the fact that the "movement" had
been willing to introduce substantial delays while
seeking the tactically opportune moment for releasing its
information. The circumstances also reveal a typical fail
ure to use alternative, non-coercive channels for securing
the same objective. If a professor feels that such
channels are ineffective, he can be instrumental in
creating new means of legitimate problem-solving
withing the university. The violent episodes in which
Professor Franklin played a role represent by no means a
"last resort" effort after non-coercive possibilities have
been exhausted.
Even such a brief description as the above indicates
that the pattern of conduct of Professor Franklin and
other members of the "movement" contains paradoxical
elements that are subject to varying interpretations.
What may appear to his following to be a sincere con
cern with issues of domestic and international injustice
and a zeal to make the university more useful to society
will appear to others to be an instance of cynical mani
pulation to achieve ends—tactics that contrast vividly
with the ideals on behalf of which they are invoked.
Such a stance, in which a member of the faculty
wishes to encourage violence against the university but
also wishes to fall short of actual incitement to or
participation in such violence, leads inevitably to covert
or ambiguous recommendations. On the one hand, Pro
fessor Franklin attempts to stay on the permissible side
of conduct, in order to preserve his position; on the
other hand, he hopes that illegal acts will come about
and wants to do what he can within the law to encour
age them. Such tactics become particularly effective in
ecalating an already inflamed series of events.
The demonstrated existence of this pattern of con
duct could be used in either of two ways in constructing
an argument concerning penalty. His stated intention of
"going right up to the line" might be taken as evidence
of his awareness of that line, and his consequent deter
mination not to violate it. However, continuous probing
of the university's will to enforce its rules might lead to
a high likelihood of future transgressions, quite apart
form the Board's findings of fact on the current charges.
C. DIFFERING PERCEPTIONS OF REALITY
Balanced against this pattern of conduct, and in part
responsible for it, is a perception of reality which Profes
sor Franklin and his followers profess to share which
differs drastically from the consensus in the university.
In his opening argument Professor Franklin proclaimed
deep convictions about the evils of American foreign and
domestic policy and about the inevitable influences of
our socio-economic system in shaping that policy. Essen
tial to this perception is a mistrust of the allegedly
intricate interrelationship between the economic power
of American's "ruling class" and the maintenance of
policies that are imperialistic abroad and oppressive at
home. Of crucial importance in the present case is his
expressed view that the university, run by and for this
ruling class, possesses a substantial institutional guilt for
the ongoing prosecution of those policies. Consequently
he sees no way to disengage American foreign imperia
lism and domestic oppression from the impetus and
support given to those policies by the university.
The outcome of this perception of reality is a convic
tion that the situation must be radically changed-by
persuasion if that is possible and by violence if persua
sion is unavailing. The university becomes the most
immediate and obvious target for such action. Since
Professor Franklin maintains that the class interests of
those with power in the university make it inlikely that
they will engage in more than token gestures of reform,
he sees coercive tactics, which can include violence, as
most likely to produce the changes he desires.
In response to those who claim to abhor violence on
campus, Professor Franklin replies that the university, as
an integral part of the capitalistic system, is itself sys
tematically engaged in the support of violence-a vio
lence that is sometimes very open and apparent, as in
Vietnam or in police oppression in the ghettos, but is
often hidden yet none the less devastating in the econo
mic oppression that is exercised domestically against
minority groups and internationally against Third World
nations. Because of the university's complicity in this
range of violent activities. Professor Franklin maintains
that it is not only appropriate but necessary (taking
tactical considerations into account) to engage in such
acts of violence against the university as can lead it in
the direction of far-reaching reorganization, "to serve
the needs of the people" and not of the privileged few.
This results in the pattern of conduct described in the
preceding section.
Despite the strident, opportunistic, and aggressive be
havior which is in part caused by these perceptions, the
Board affirms that the university must not only tolerate,
but must actively foster, the widest range of opinions
possible. We realize that any perception of reality can be
challenged, stretched and revised by the competing views
with which it comes into vigorous contact and debate on
the university campus. We are committed to the princi
ple that in the competing marketplace of ideas truth can
make it without cheating that is, that in the competi
tion of conflicting perceptions of reality truth can sur
vive without resort to the stilling of dissent. We must
engage, and have tried to engage, in "the willing suspen
sion of disbelief," so as to enter as sympathetically as

possible into the perception of reality espoused by Pro
fessor Franklin. Such matters as conviction, motivation
and rationale are important determinants in the assess
ment of penalty, even though they may not enter direc
tly into findings of fact.
D. THE CONFLICTING RIGHTS
There are special reasons for the exercise of caution
in the application of sanctions in this case. First, loss of
tenure is at risk. We need hardly review here the signifi
cance of tenure; it is not merely a protection of the
individual against unwarranted attacks from the institu
tion from outside political forces. Tenure thus protects
freedom for the full range of scholarly inquiry, and both
the institution and the individual have a large stake in its
continued good health. At the same time, it exacts from
the tenured faculty member obligations of performance
and conduct.
Second, the impoverished state of "case law" for
academic proceedings of this sort gives great weight to
the outcome of the present case. There is much to be
said for caution in ground-breaking. Yet caution
demands regard both for the rights of the individual and
of the institution.
The rights of the individual must be balanced and
judged in relation to the rights of others having different
perceptions, and to the rights of the entire university
community to function and to survive as a center of
unregimented thought. However, the expression of
dee ply-held convictions of one who affirms a minority
perception of reality should not be denied merely be
cause the majority feels more comfortable when not
confronted by challenge.
In dealing with the rights of the institution, it must
be recognized that the university is not the all-powerful
monolith its attackers at times pretend it is. It is an
institution thriving on decentralized initiative, with a
central administration that has limited power but in
creasing responsibilities. There is a real danger that
ignoring the rights of the institution in order to safe
guard the rights of the individual faculty member may
have a result opposite from that intended: it may lead to
more attacks on the rights of other faculty members and
more, rather than less, concentration of administrative
authority. In a very real sense the university is the
totality of its constituents-damage suffered by the uni
versity works directly to the detriment of its individual
members.
There is thus a needed balance among three interests:
those of the faculty member accused, those of the other
members of the academic community, and those of the
university as an institution. But there is a fundamental
consequence of this balance of rights. While it is the
consensus within the university that it should have room
for the widest possible range of perceptions and expres
sion, the university says in fact to its members: "You
may preach and also practice.. .but only up to a certain
point."
The latter edict is not aimed exclusively at those on
the far political left, who often complain that they are
the only ones being discriminated against when told that
a theoretical espousal of their position is permitted so
long as it does not spill over into action. It is also applied
at many other points along the socio-politico-economic
spectrum within the academic community. For instance,
the university protects the right of a professor to
espouse views that suggest a demeaning relationship
between racial background and intelligence, but it would
not perrrut him to organize a forcible attempt to prevent
the Admissions Office from accepting black applicants.
It would allow a fascist professor to advocate abolition
of democratic processes, but would not let him interfere
with the conduct of university exercises dedicated
toward the exposition of democratic institutions.
Common to these examples is the institutional decision
that while those further toward the center of the politi
cal spectrum may practice what they preach, those at its
extremes may preach but are limited in their practice.
From Professor Franklin's viewpoint, this is an unfair
asymmetry. The majority of the community would
point out that in any even-handed balancing of rights,
the encouragement of violence constitutes an infringe
ment; to Professor Franklin the balancing of rights
appears insufficiently global. Because he makes the need
for incitement a political credo, a prosecution for the
advocacy of imminent lawless action becomes to him a
political persecution.
These descriptions do not solve the problem; they
only help to identity it. We cannot simultaneously re
dedicate the university to a specific political goal—by
using force or violence if necessary—and at the same
time preserve it as an institution in which independent
initiative from many quarters can have the widest possi
ble play. A choice must be made and we choose the
latter. Yet having made this choice, the university can
contemplate punishment of action—and most especially,
of speech—only when the rights claimed by the dissi
dents seriously infringe those of other groups or individ
uals within the university. Punishment should follow
only when strongly persuasive evidence has been devel
oped that such infringement has actually occured.
E. GUIDELINES FOR SEVERITY OF SANCTION
1. Modifying Circumstances. On the basis of the
above considerations we are prepared to consider as
mitigating issues of motivation, overriding necessity, and
a variety of factors that may be understandable within
Professor Franklin's framework of convictions but not
within our own or those of most of our colleagues. At
the same time we are prepared to consider as justifica
tion for a relatively more severe penality a pattern of
conduct which systematically threatens the university as
an institution in which decentralized individual initiative
can have the widest possible range.
However, within this balanced input we believe that,
in case of doubt, those criteria that are external to the
factual fabric of the charges should be applied asym
metrically in favor of the defendent, since (1) such
matters were not taken into account in findings of fact,
(2) the perceptions of reality held by the Board are
generally more shared with those of the Administration
than with those of Professor Franklin.
2. The Purpose of Sanction. The purpose of sanction
can be to retaliate, to rehabilitate, or to deter further
violations. We hope that in a university setting only the
last two deserve consideration; and we must ask what
importance to attach to each.
We are highly dubious whether rehabilitation is a
useful concept in this case. Professor Franklin's an
nounced convictions about the guilt of the university
appear deeply-held, and his opposition to the institution
in its present form seems implacable. We believe him
when he expresses his regret that his role in converting
the university to "serve the people" is restricted by
practical reasons to advocacy rather than action. "Re
habilitation" might appear to Professor Franklin as a
highly unfair mandate to change his convictions. Barring

a dramatic change in perception he is unlikely to change
his conduct; thus "rehabilitation" is likely to fail, what
ever the sanction.
It can be argued in contrast that the deterring func
tion of penalty has real force. By setting a price on
proscribed conduct, the university can make its members
consider carefully the line that separates forbidden from
permitted speech and action, and avoid crossing that
line. In establishing a penalty, the institution in effect
announces the degree to which it is attached to its own
values. Such an announcement insists that persons con
sidering borderline conduct must locate the border; for
wnen there is no deterrent to illegal acts, it hardly pays
to have a law.
3. The Range of Possible Sanctions. Dismissal severs
the connection between the defendant and the institu
tion; a lesser sanction assumes that a satisfactory rela
tionship between Professor Franklin and the other mem
bers of the university can be re-established. In consider
ing the appropriateness of a lesser penalty, we must thus
consider (! ) whether it will actually deter, and whether
deterrence is a reasonable expectation at all; (2) whether
it appropriately announces the institution's attachment
to the value measured.
There is no absolute way of defining the deterrent
value of penalty. Some professions (and some people)
are especially sensitive to economic sanctions, others to
censure. If that proposition is granted, a certain finding
of fact can still justify a range of penalties that differ in
kind as well as in severity. Between mere censure and
dismissal there is an intermediate range of possible sanc
tions that is populated primarily by such mechanisms as
suspension (with or without pay) and probation.
We do not hold probation to be workable. Where
such a right as tenure is involved, probation merely
challenges it authenticity; and probation is too often an

excuse for the removal of due process. Suspension is
another matter, and encompasses three kinds of sanc
tion. There is, first, the loss of privilege-to teach and to
use the full range of the academy's resources. Professor
Franklin has already suffered -irreversibly-the penalty
of suspension with pay since February 12, 1971; this is a
long time, although he has contributed substantially to
its length. Second, suspension may also involve loss of
salary. Finally, the imposition of any penalty, suspen
sion included, produces a subtle but real change in
professional status. Sanction imposed by a council of his
peers would surely detract from the offender's standing
in the academic community at large.
For all these reasons suspension without pay ranging
from one quarter upward is a substantial penalty—in
terms of financial cost, in terms of lost academic partici
pation, and in terms of lowered professional status and
consequent loss of mobility. Suspension of too great a
lenght is not practicable, because at some point the
defendent—whom we must assume to be economically
vulnerable-becomes likely to be forced into irreversible
occupational alternatives.
Dismissal is a penalty of undoubted severity because
of its absolute effect upon the immediate institutional
relationship combined with its impact upon employment
opportunities elsewhere within and even outside the
profession. The severity of dismissal as a penalty can be
softened somewhat by a financial settlement which
would permit time for the exploration of alternatives.
The more severe penalties are not in our view in
appropriately matched to the gravity of the charges.
Incitement to violent, coercive, lawless action—however
it may be modified in final judgment by any of the
factors discusses above—is a heavy attack upon the insti
tution of which Professor Franklin is a member.
A. INTRODUCTION
The University administration proposed in its state
ment of charges that Professor Franklin he dismissed,
and has argued in its response to Professor Franklin's
Motion to Dismiss Charges that dismissal would be the
appropriate penalty even if the Board sustained only one
of the last three charges (No.B—White Plaza Rally,
No.9—Computation Center Incident, No.lo—Old Union
Rally).
In the section on "Fundamental Issues and Stand
ards" of this report the Board has agreed that the pur
pose of academic due process is to establish:
1. That the stated cause is the authentic cause for dis
missal, rather than a pretense or makeweight for
considerations invading the academic freedom or or
dinary personal civil liberties of the individual;
2. that the stated cause exists in fact;
3. that the degree of demonstrated professional irres
ponsibility warrants outright termination of the indi
vidual's appointment rather than some lesser sanc
tion, even after taking into account the balance of his
entire service and the personal consequences of dis
missal.
(N. Van Alstyne, Bulletin of the American Associa
tion of University frofessors,Autumn, 1971)
In the preceding sections the Board has dealt with the
first two of these points; we now proceed to the con
tents of the third.
Professor Franklin's performance as a scholar and
teacher has not been questioned in these proceedings;
the Board ruled on this matter on October 28, 1971, in
its response to Professor Franklin's motion:
The Board requires no testimony supporting Profes
sor Franklin's exceptional competence as a scholar
and teacher His competence is not in question in this
hearing; the protections of tenure extend to all ten
ured faculty members without regard to judgments of
their relative merits.
The remaining question is thus one of appropriate
penalty, taking into account the Board's findings of fact,
the entire record, and the consequences of the sanctions
that might be imposed.
Beyond the Board's findings of fact, several elements
of the record in its entirety deserve consideration. First,
Professor Franklin is led into a pattern of conduct that
directly involves attacks upon the values of the univer
sity as now constituted, and also includes encourage
ment of violent or coercive tactics against the members
of the university community and the society of which it
is a part. Second, Professor Franklin has repeatedly
reminded the Board that he bases his actions upon a
different set of perceptions about the university and
society from those of the majority of Stanford faculty
members, including members of the Board. Such percep
tions of reality, and the convictions that emerge from
them, might provide an explanation for his conduct
which would assist the Board in its judgment. Third, the
rights of the university's entire membership not to be
disrupted by the unbridled exercise of self-proclaimed
moral conviction must be balanced against Professor
Franklin's right of political expression and action.
It is the need to balance these frequently conflicting

interests which underlies the determination of appropri
ate sanction.
B. PROFESSOR FRANKLIN S PATTERN OF
CONDUCT
From the viewpoint of most Stanford faculty mem
bers, who themselves are of course subject to limitations
of perception. Professor Franklin pursues a course of
action that seeks systematically to disrupt the normal
functioning of the university. Professor Franklin, on the
other hand, asserts that he is not trying to destroy the
institution, but to convert it to "serve the needs of the
people." Professor Franklin asserts that the university's
actual function is to serve as a training and research
center for the maintenance of an imperialistic hegemony
over the "Pacific Basin Empire;" yet to most of his
colleagues, that is a bizarre mischaracterization. Thus the
basis of a pattern of conduct is itself subject to con
flicting interpretations, depending upon the perception
of reality from which it is being described.
A major element in Professor Franklin's treatment of
issues in the university is an attempt to disembody the
institution from the human beings who make it up.
Characteristically, an instance of policy or action in one
area is identified and found to be unacceptable in some
respects; guilt is then globalized to the entire institution,
and it and its chief administrators are labeled as respon
sible in absolute terms. The dehumanizing process ex
tends to the treatment of the individuals so labeled: they
are characterized as "pigs," "fascists," "lackeys," and
the like.
The essential feature of the confrontation with the
institution involves a call to coercive or violent action,
based upon indignation generated by the particular issue
raised. In such calls, however, Professor Franklin has
been careful to limit his own role to that of advocate
rather than participant. He has said that he does not
wish to compromise his own position as a tenured mem
ber of the Stanford faculty, feeling that he is more
valuable to the "movement" because of that status than,
for example, is a student. For this reason he has stated
that he avoids participating directly in disruptions, illegal
occupations of buildings, and the like. For the same
reason one may presume that he also attempts to avoid
direct incitement; he does, however, acknowledge and
praise violent conduct when it is carried out by others—
as when lie says in his affidavit:
. . .1 have the right to voice public approval of the
fragging of officers in Vietnam and the breaking of
windows at Stanford University. In fact, I am
ashamed to admit that I have not engaged in any of
these activities, nor incited, counselled, advised or
urged others to do so. So I find myself in the
awkward position of defending myself against allega
tions of things which I have not done but perhaps I
should have done.
In this way, encouragement is given to persons who
share Professor Franklin's views about the nature of the
university to engage in illegal acts in which he is not
willing to engage. This influence extends not only to
members of the "movement," but also to non-members
who are in general sympathy with a number of the
causes for which Professor Franklin is an advocate. The
alleviation of poverty, an end to the war in Southeast
Asia, and more rapid progress toward social justice are
all goals with which the majority of Stanford students
and faculty members are in sympathy. In supporting
these causes from his particular political stance, Profes
sor Franklin forcefully remonstrates that the university
is a primary agent of injustice in order to focus protest
action on the university itself. To dramatize the institu
tion's complicity, a variety of immediate issues may
serve; these may present themselves as targets of oppor
tunity based on the vulnerability of the institution, on
the time scale of university decision-making, on adminis
trative errors, or on genuine failure on the part of the
university to do what it said it would or what it should
have done.
The events leading up to February 10th provide an
illustration of the use of a target of opportunity. The
running on the computer of an SRI program entitled
"Gamut-H", allegedly having direct application to am
phibious assault operations in the Vietnam war, was
coupled to the general mood of anger on the campus
about the Laotian invasion. Indeed it emerged in testi
mony that the local issue-Gamut-H—had been stored
for the tactically useful moment; it had been known to
members of the "movement," though apparently not to
Professor Franklin, for at least a week before the
Laotian invassion. The existence of that program was
proclaimed to be a major basis for selection of the
Computation Center as a target for occupation
although the urgency of the demands for remedial action
contrasted oddly with the fact that the "movement" had
been willing to introduce substantial delays while
seeking the tactically opportune moment for releasing its
information. The circumstances also reveal a typical fail
ure to use alternative, non-coercive channels for securing
the same objective. If a professor feels that such
channels are ineffective, he can be instrumental in
creating new means of legitimate problem-solving
withing the university. The violent episodes in which
Professor Franklin played a role represent by no means a
"last resort" effort after non-coercive possibilities have
been exhausted.
Even such a brief description as the above indicates
that the pattern of conduct of Professor Franklin and
other members of the "movement" contains paradoxical
elements that are subject to varying interpretations.
What may appear to his following to be a sincere con
cern with issues of domestic and international injustice
and a zeal to make the university more useful to society
will appear to others to be an instance of cynical mani
pulation to achieve ends—tactics that contrast vividly
with the ideals on behalf of which they are invoked.
Such a stance, in which a member of the faculty
wishes to encourage violence against the university but
also wishes to fall short of actual incitement to or
participation in such violence, leads inevitably to covert
or ambiguous recommendations. On the one hand, Pro
fessor Franklin attempts to stay on the permissible side
of conduct, in order to preserve his position; on the
other hand, he hopes that illegal acts will come about
and wants to do what he can within the law to encour
age them. Such tactics become particularly effective in
ecalating an already inflamed series of events.
The demonstrated existence of this pattern of con
duct could be used in either of two ways in constructing
an argument concerning penalty. His stated intention of
"going right up to the line" might be taken as evidence
of his awareness of that line, and his consequent deter
mination not to violate it. However, continuous probing
of the university's will to enforce its rules might lead to
a high likelihood of future transgressions, quite apart
form the Board's findings of fact on the current charges.
C. DIFFERING PERCEPTIONS OF REALITY
Balanced against this pattern of conduct, and in part
responsible for it, is a perception of reality which Profes
sor Franklin and his followers profess to share which
differs drastically from the consensus in the university.
In his opening argument Professor Franklin proclaimed
deep convictions about the evils of American foreign and
domestic policy and about the inevitable influences of
our socio-economic system in shaping that policy. Essen
tial to this perception is a mistrust of the allegedly
intricate interrelationship between the economic power
of American's "ruling class" and the maintenance of
policies that are imperialistic abroad and oppressive at
home. Of crucial importance in the present case is his
expressed view that the university, run by and for this
ruling class, possesses a substantial institutional guilt for
the ongoing prosecution of those policies. Consequently
he sees no way to disengage American foreign imperia
lism and domestic oppression from the impetus and
support given to those policies by the university.
The outcome of this perception of reality is a convic
tion that the situation must be radically changed-by
persuasion if that is possible and by violence if persua
sion is unavailing. The university becomes the most
immediate and obvious target for such action. Since
Professor Franklin maintains that the class interests of
those with power in the university make it inlikely that
they will engage in more than token gestures of reform,
he sees coercive tactics, which can include violence, as
most likely to produce the changes he desires.
In response to those who claim to abhor violence on
campus, Professor Franklin replies that the university, as
an integral part of the capitalistic system, is itself sys
tematically engaged in the support of violence-a vio
lence that is sometimes very open and apparent, as in
Vietnam or in police oppression in the ghettos, but is
often hidden yet none the less devastating in the econo
mic oppression that is exercised domestically against
minority groups and internationally against Third World
nations. Because of the university's complicity in this
range of violent activities. Professor Franklin maintains
that it is not only appropriate but necessary (taking
tactical considerations into account) to engage in such
acts of violence against the university as can lead it in
the direction of far-reaching reorganization, "to serve
the needs of the people" and not of the privileged few.
This results in the pattern of conduct described in the
preceding section.
Despite the strident, opportunistic, and aggressive be
havior which is in part caused by these perceptions, the
Board affirms that the university must not only tolerate,
but must actively foster, the widest range of opinions
possible. We realize that any perception of reality can be
challenged, stretched and revised by the competing views
with which it comes into vigorous contact and debate on
the university campus. We are committed to the princi
ple that in the competing marketplace of ideas truth can
make it without cheating that is, that in the competi
tion of conflicting perceptions of reality truth can sur
vive without resort to the stilling of dissent. We must
engage, and have tried to engage, in "the willing suspen
sion of disbelief," so as to enter as sympathetically as

possible into the perception of reality espoused by Pro
fessor Franklin. Such matters as conviction, motivation
and rationale are important determinants in the assess
ment of penalty, even though they may not enter direc
tly into findings of fact.
D. THE CONFLICTING RIGHTS
There are special reasons for the exercise of caution
in the application of sanctions in this case. First, loss of
tenure is at risk. We need hardly review here the signifi
cance of tenure; it is not merely a protection of the
individual against unwarranted attacks from the institu
tion from outside political forces. Tenure thus protects
freedom for the full range of scholarly inquiry, and both
the institution and the individual have a large stake in its
continued good health. At the same time, it exacts from
the tenured faculty member obligations of performance
and conduct.
Second, the impoverished state of "case law" for
academic proceedings of this sort gives great weight to
the outcome of the present case. There is much to be
said for caution in ground-breaking. Yet caution
demands regard both for the rights of the individual and
of the institution.
The rights of the individual must be balanced and
judged in relation to the rights of others having different
perceptions, and to the rights of the entire university
community to function and to survive as a center of
unregimented thought. However, the expression of
dee ply-held convictions of one who affirms a minority
perception of reality should not be denied merely be
cause the majority feels more comfortable when not
confronted by challenge.
In dealing with the rights of the institution, it must
be recognized that the university is not the all-powerful
monolith its attackers at times pretend it is. It is an
institution thriving on decentralized initiative, with a
central administration that has limited power but in
creasing responsibilities. There is a real danger that
ignoring the rights of the institution in order to safe
guard the rights of the individual faculty member may
have a result opposite from that intended: it may lead to
more attacks on the rights of other faculty members and
more, rather than less, concentration of administrative
authority. In a very real sense the university is the
totality of its constituents-damage suffered by the uni
versity works directly to the detriment of its individual
members.
There is thus a needed balance among three interests:
those of the faculty member accused, those of the other
members of the academic community, and those of the
university as an institution. But there is a fundamental
consequence of this balance of rights. While it is the
consensus within the university that it should have room
for the widest possible range of perceptions and expres
sion, the university says in fact to its members: "You
may preach and also practice.. .but only up to a certain
point."
The latter edict is not aimed exclusively at those on
the far political left, who often complain that they are
the only ones being discriminated against when told that
a theoretical espousal of their position is permitted so
long as it does not spill over into action. It is also applied
at many other points along the socio-politico-economic
spectrum within the academic community. For instance,
the university protects the right of a professor to
espouse views that suggest a demeaning relationship
between racial background and intelligence, but it would
not perrrut him to organize a forcible attempt to prevent
the Admissions Office from accepting black applicants.
It would allow a fascist professor to advocate abolition
of democratic processes, but would not let him interfere
with the conduct of university exercises dedicated
toward the exposition of democratic institutions.
Common to these examples is the institutional decision
that while those further toward the center of the politi
cal spectrum may practice what they preach, those at its
extremes may preach but are limited in their practice.
From Professor Franklin's viewpoint, this is an unfair
asymmetry. The majority of the community would
point out that in any even-handed balancing of rights,
the encouragement of violence constitutes an infringe
ment; to Professor Franklin the balancing of rights
appears insufficiently global. Because he makes the need
for incitement a political credo, a prosecution for the
advocacy of imminent lawless action becomes to him a
political persecution.
These descriptions do not solve the problem; they
only help to identity it. We cannot simultaneously re
dedicate the university to a specific political goal—by
using force or violence if necessary—and at the same
time preserve it as an institution in which independent
initiative from many quarters can have the widest possi
ble play. A choice must be made and we choose the
latter. Yet having made this choice, the university can
contemplate punishment of action—and most especially,
of speech—only when the rights claimed by the dissi
dents seriously infringe those of other groups or individ
uals within the university. Punishment should follow
only when strongly persuasive evidence has been devel
oped that such infringement has actually occured.
E. GUIDELINES FOR SEVERITY OF SANCTION
1. Modifying Circumstances. On the basis of the
above considerations we are prepared to consider as
mitigating issues of motivation, overriding necessity, and
a variety of factors that may be understandable within
Professor Franklin's framework of convictions but not
within our own or those of most of our colleagues. At
the same time we are prepared to consider as justifica
tion for a relatively more severe penality a pattern of
conduct which systematically threatens the university as
an institution in which decentralized individual initiative
can have the widest possible range.
However, within this balanced input we believe that,
in case of doubt, those criteria that are external to the
factual fabric of the charges should be applied asym
metrically in favor of the defendent, since (1) such
matters were not taken into account in findings of fact,
(2) the perceptions of reality held by the Board are
generally more shared with those of the Administration
than with those of Professor Franklin.
2. The Purpose of Sanction. The purpose of sanction
can be to retaliate, to rehabilitate, or to deter further
violations. We hope that in a university setting only the
last two deserve consideration; and we must ask what
importance to attach to each.
We are highly dubious whether rehabilitation is a
useful concept in this case. Professor Franklin's an
nounced convictions about the guilt of the university
appear deeply-held, and his opposition to the institution
in its present form seems implacable. We believe him
when he expresses his regret that his role in converting
the university to "serve the people" is restricted by
practical reasons to advocacy rather than action. "Re
habilitation" might appear to Professor Franklin as a
highly unfair mandate to change his convictions. Barring

a dramatic change in perception he is unlikely to change
his conduct; thus "rehabilitation" is likely to fail, what
ever the sanction.
It can be argued in contrast that the deterring func
tion of penalty has real force. By setting a price on
proscribed conduct, the university can make its members
consider carefully the line that separates forbidden from
permitted speech and action, and avoid crossing that
line. In establishing a penalty, the institution in effect
announces the degree to which it is attached to its own
values. Such an announcement insists that persons con
sidering borderline conduct must locate the border; for
wnen there is no deterrent to illegal acts, it hardly pays
to have a law.
3. The Range of Possible Sanctions. Dismissal severs
the connection between the defendant and the institu
tion; a lesser sanction assumes that a satisfactory rela
tionship between Professor Franklin and the other mem
bers of the university can be re-established. In consider
ing the appropriateness of a lesser penalty, we must thus
consider (! ) whether it will actually deter, and whether
deterrence is a reasonable expectation at all; (2) whether
it appropriately announces the institution's attachment
to the value measured.
There is no absolute way of defining the deterrent
value of penalty. Some professions (and some people)
are especially sensitive to economic sanctions, others to
censure. If that proposition is granted, a certain finding
of fact can still justify a range of penalties that differ in
kind as well as in severity. Between mere censure and
dismissal there is an intermediate range of possible sanc
tions that is populated primarily by such mechanisms as
suspension (with or without pay) and probation.
We do not hold probation to be workable. Where
such a right as tenure is involved, probation merely
challenges it authenticity; and probation is too often an

excuse for the removal of due process. Suspension is
another matter, and encompasses three kinds of sanc
tion. There is, first, the loss of privilege-to teach and to
use the full range of the academy's resources. Professor
Franklin has already suffered -irreversibly-the penalty
of suspension with pay since February 12, 1971; this is a
long time, although he has contributed substantially to
its length. Second, suspension may also involve loss of
salary. Finally, the imposition of any penalty, suspen
sion included, produces a subtle but real change in
professional status. Sanction imposed by a council of his
peers would surely detract from the offender's standing
in the academic community at large.
For all these reasons suspension without pay ranging
from one quarter upward is a substantial penalty—in
terms of financial cost, in terms of lost academic partici
pation, and in terms of lowered professional status and
consequent loss of mobility. Suspension of too great a
lenght is not practicable, because at some point the
defendent—whom we must assume to be economically
vulnerable-becomes likely to be forced into irreversible
occupational alternatives.
Dismissal is a penalty of undoubted severity because
of its absolute effect upon the immediate institutional
relationship combined with its impact upon employment
opportunities elsewhere within and even outside the
profession. The severity of dismissal as a penalty can be
softened somewhat by a financial settlement which
would permit time for the exploration of alternatives.
The more severe penalties are not in our view in
appropriately matched to the gravity of the charges.
Incitement to violent, coercive, lawless action—however
it may be modified in final judgment by any of the
factors discusses above—is a heavy attack upon the insti
tution of which Professor Franklin is a member.
A. INTRODUCTION
The University administration proposed in its state
ment of charges that Professor Franklin he dismissed,
and has argued in its response to Professor Franklin's
Motion to Dismiss Charges that dismissal would be the
appropriate penalty even if the Board sustained only one
of the last three charges (No.B—White Plaza Rally,
No.9—Computation Center Incident, No.lo—Old Union
Rally).
In the section on "Fundamental Issues and Stand
ards" of this report the Board has agreed that the pur
pose of academic due process is to establish:
1. That the stated cause is the authentic cause for dis
missal, rather than a pretense or makeweight for
considerations invading the academic freedom or or
dinary personal civil liberties of the individual;
2. that the stated cause exists in fact;
3. that the degree of demonstrated professional irres
ponsibility warrants outright termination of the indi
vidual's appointment rather than some lesser sanc
tion, even after taking into account the balance of his
entire service and the personal consequences of dis
missal.
(N. Van Alstyne, Bulletin of the American Associa
tion of University frofessors,Autumn, 1971)
In the preceding sections the Board has dealt with the
first two of these points; we now proceed to the con
tents of the third.
Professor Franklin's performance as a scholar and
teacher has not been questioned in these proceedings;
the Board ruled on this matter on October 28, 1971, in
its response to Professor Franklin's motion:
The Board requires no testimony supporting Profes
sor Franklin's exceptional competence as a scholar
and teacher His competence is not in question in this
hearing; the protections of tenure extend to all ten
ured faculty members without regard to judgments of
their relative merits.
The remaining question is thus one of appropriate
penalty, taking into account the Board's findings of fact,
the entire record, and the consequences of the sanctions
that might be imposed.
Beyond the Board's findings of fact, several elements
of the record in its entirety deserve consideration. First,
Professor Franklin is led into a pattern of conduct that
directly involves attacks upon the values of the univer
sity as now constituted, and also includes encourage
ment of violent or coercive tactics against the members
of the university community and the society of which it
is a part. Second, Professor Franklin has repeatedly
reminded the Board that he bases his actions upon a
different set of perceptions about the university and
society from those of the majority of Stanford faculty
members, including members of the Board. Such percep
tions of reality, and the convictions that emerge from
them, might provide an explanation for his conduct
which would assist the Board in its judgment. Third, the
rights of the university's entire membership not to be
disrupted by the unbridled exercise of self-proclaimed
moral conviction must be balanced against Professor
Franklin's right of political expression and action.
It is the need to balance these frequently conflicting

interests which underlies the determination of appropri
ate sanction.
B. PROFESSOR FRANKLIN S PATTERN OF
CONDUCT
From the viewpoint of most Stanford faculty mem
bers, who themselves are of course subject to limitations
of perception. Professor Franklin pursues a course of
action that seeks systematically to disrupt the normal
functioning of the university. Professor Franklin, on the
other hand, asserts that he is not trying to destroy the
institution, but to convert it to "serve the needs of the
people." Professor Franklin asserts that the university's
actual function is to serve as a training and research
center for the maintenance of an imperialistic hegemony
over the "Pacific Basin Empire;" yet to most of his
colleagues, that is a bizarre mischaracterization. Thus the
basis of a pattern of conduct is itself subject to con
flicting interpretations, depending upon the perception
of reality from which it is being described.
A major element in Professor Franklin's treatment of
issues in the university is an attempt to disembody the
institution from the human beings who make it up.
Characteristically, an instance of policy or action in one
area is identified and found to be unacceptable in some
respects; guilt is then globalized to the entire institution,
and it and its chief administrators are labeled as respon
sible in absolute terms. The dehumanizing process ex
tends to the treatment of the individuals so labeled: they
are characterized as "pigs," "fascists," "lackeys," and
the like.
The essential feature of the confrontation with the
institution involves a call to coercive or violent action,
based upon indignation generated by the particular issue
raised. In such calls, however, Professor Franklin has
been careful to limit his own role to that of advocate
rather than participant. He has said that he does not
wish to compromise his own position as a tenured mem
ber of the Stanford faculty, feeling that he is more
valuable to the "movement" because of that status than,
for example, is a student. For this reason he has stated
that he avoids participating directly in disruptions, illegal
occupations of buildings, and the like. For the same
reason one may presume that he also attempts to avoid
direct incitement; he does, however, acknowledge and
praise violent conduct when it is carried out by others—
as when lie says in his affidavit:
. . .1 have the right to voice public approval of the
fragging of officers in Vietnam and the breaking of
windows at Stanford University. In fact, I am
ashamed to admit that I have not engaged in any of
these activities, nor incited, counselled, advised or
urged others to do so. So I find myself in the
awkward position of defending myself against allega
tions of things which I have not done but perhaps I
should have done.
In this way, encouragement is given to persons who
share Professor Franklin's views about the nature of the
university to engage in illegal acts in which he is not
willing to engage. This influence extends not only to
members of the "movement," but also to non-members
who are in general sympathy with a number of the
causes for which Professor Franklin is an advocate. The
alleviation of poverty, an end to the war in Southeast
Asia, and more rapid progress toward social justice are
all goals with which the majority of Stanford students
and faculty members are in sympathy. In supporting
these causes from his particular political stance, Profes
sor Franklin forcefully remonstrates that the university
is a primary agent of injustice in order to focus protest
action on the university itself. To dramatize the institu
tion's complicity, a variety of immediate issues may
serve; these may present themselves as targets of oppor
tunity based on the vulnerability of the institution, on
the time scale of university decision-making, on adminis
trative errors, or on genuine failure on the part of the
university to do what it said it would or what it should
have done.
The events leading up to February 10th provide an
illustration of the use of a target of opportunity. The
running on the computer of an SRI program entitled
"Gamut-H", allegedly having direct application to am
phibious assault operations in the Vietnam war, was
coupled to the general mood of anger on the campus
about the Laotian invasion. Indeed it emerged in testi
mony that the local issue-Gamut-H—had been stored
for the tactically useful moment; it had been known to
members of the "movement," though apparently not to
Professor Franklin, for at least a week before the
Laotian invassion. The existence of that program was
proclaimed to be a major basis for selection of the
Computation Center as a target for occupation
although the urgency of the demands for remedial action
contrasted oddly with the fact that the "movement" had
been willing to introduce substantial delays while
seeking the tactically opportune moment for releasing its
information. The circumstances also reveal a typical fail
ure to use alternative, non-coercive channels for securing
the same objective. If a professor feels that such
channels are ineffective, he can be instrumental in
creating new means of legitimate problem-solving
withing the university. The violent episodes in which
Professor Franklin played a role represent by no means a
"last resort" effort after non-coercive possibilities have
been exhausted.
Even such a brief description as the above indicates
that the pattern of conduct of Professor Franklin and
other members of the "movement" contains paradoxical
elements that are subject to varying interpretations.
What may appear to his following to be a sincere con
cern with issues of domestic and international injustice
and a zeal to make the university more useful to society
will appear to others to be an instance of cynical mani
pulation to achieve ends—tactics that contrast vividly
with the ideals on behalf of which they are invoked.
Such a stance, in which a member of the faculty
wishes to encourage violence against the university but
also wishes to fall short of actual incitement to or
participation in such violence, leads inevitably to covert
or ambiguous recommendations. On the one hand, Pro
fessor Franklin attempts to stay on the permissible side
of conduct, in order to preserve his position; on the
other hand, he hopes that illegal acts will come about
and wants to do what he can within the law to encour
age them. Such tactics become particularly effective in
ecalating an already inflamed series of events.
The demonstrated existence of this pattern of con
duct could be used in either of two ways in constructing
an argument concerning penalty. His stated intention of
"going right up to the line" might be taken as evidence
of his awareness of that line, and his consequent deter
mination not to violate it. However, continuous probing
of the university's will to enforce its rules might lead to
a high likelihood of future transgressions, quite apart
form the Board's findings of fact on the current charges.
C. DIFFERING PERCEPTIONS OF REALITY
Balanced against this pattern of conduct, and in part
responsible for it, is a perception of reality which Profes
sor Franklin and his followers profess to share which
differs drastically from the consensus in the university.
In his opening argument Professor Franklin proclaimed
deep convictions about the evils of American foreign and
domestic policy and about the inevitable influences of
our socio-economic system in shaping that policy. Essen
tial to this perception is a mistrust of the allegedly
intricate interrelationship between the economic power
of American's "ruling class" and the maintenance of
policies that are imperialistic abroad and oppressive at
home. Of crucial importance in the present case is his
expressed view that the university, run by and for this
ruling class, possesses a substantial institutional guilt for
the ongoing prosecution of those policies. Consequently
he sees no way to disengage American foreign imperia
lism and domestic oppression from the impetus and
support given to those policies by the university.
The outcome of this perception of reality is a convic
tion that the situation must be radically changed-by
persuasion if that is possible and by violence if persua
sion is unavailing. The university becomes the most
immediate and obvious target for such action. Since
Professor Franklin maintains that the class interests of
those with power in the university make it inlikely that
they will engage in more than token gestures of reform,
he sees coercive tactics, which can include violence, as
most likely to produce the changes he desires.
In response to those who claim to abhor violence on
campus, Professor Franklin replies that the university, as
an integral part of the capitalistic system, is itself sys
tematically engaged in the support of violence-a vio
lence that is sometimes very open and apparent, as in
Vietnam or in police oppression in the ghettos, but is
often hidden yet none the less devastating in the econo
mic oppression that is exercised domestically against
minority groups and internationally against Third World
nations. Because of the university's complicity in this
range of violent activities. Professor Franklin maintains
that it is not only appropriate but necessary (taking
tactical considerations into account) to engage in such
acts of violence against the university as can lead it in
the direction of far-reaching reorganization, "to serve
the needs of the people" and not of the privileged few.
This results in the pattern of conduct described in the
preceding section.
Despite the strident, opportunistic, and aggressive be
havior which is in part caused by these perceptions, the
Board affirms that the university must not only tolerate,
but must actively foster, the widest range of opinions
possible. We realize that any perception of reality can be
challenged, stretched and revised by the competing views
with which it comes into vigorous contact and debate on
the university campus. We are committed to the princi
ple that in the competing marketplace of ideas truth can
make it without cheating that is, that in the competi
tion of conflicting perceptions of reality truth can sur
vive without resort to the stilling of dissent. We must
engage, and have tried to engage, in "the willing suspen
sion of disbelief," so as to enter as sympathetically as

possible into the perception of reality espoused by Pro
fessor Franklin. Such matters as conviction, motivation
and rationale are important determinants in the assess
ment of penalty, even though they may not enter direc
tly into findings of fact.
D. THE CONFLICTING RIGHTS
There are special reasons for the exercise of caution
in the application of sanctions in this case. First, loss of
tenure is at risk. We need hardly review here the signifi
cance of tenure; it is not merely a protection of the
individual against unwarranted attacks from the institu
tion from outside political forces. Tenure thus protects
freedom for the full range of scholarly inquiry, and both
the institution and the individual have a large stake in its
continued good health. At the same time, it exacts from
the tenured faculty member obligations of performance
and conduct.
Second, the impoverished state of "case law" for
academic proceedings of this sort gives great weight to
the outcome of the present case. There is much to be
said for caution in ground-breaking. Yet caution
demands regard both for the rights of the individual and
of the institution.
The rights of the individual must be balanced and
judged in relation to the rights of others having different
perceptions, and to the rights of the entire university
community to function and to survive as a center of
unregimented thought. However, the expression of
dee ply-held convictions of one who affirms a minority
perception of reality should not be denied merely be
cause the majority feels more comfortable when not
confronted by challenge.
In dealing with the rights of the institution, it must
be recognized that the university is not the all-powerful
monolith its attackers at times pretend it is. It is an
institution thriving on decentralized initiative, with a
central administration that has limited power but in
creasing responsibilities. There is a real danger that
ignoring the rights of the institution in order to safe
guard the rights of the individual faculty member may
have a result opposite from that intended: it may lead to
more attacks on the rights of other faculty members and
more, rather than less, concentration of administrative
authority. In a very real sense the university is the
totality of its constituents-damage suffered by the uni
versity works directly to the detriment of its individual
members.
There is thus a needed balance among three interests:
those of the faculty member accused, those of the other
members of the academic community, and those of the
university as an institution. But there is a fundamental
consequence of this balance of rights. While it is the
consensus within the university that it should have room
for the widest possible range of perceptions and expres
sion, the university says in fact to its members: "You
may preach and also practice.. .but only up to a certain
point."
The latter edict is not aimed exclusively at those on
the far political left, who often complain that they are
the only ones being discriminated against when told that
a theoretical espousal of their position is permitted so
long as it does not spill over into action. It is also applied
at many other points along the socio-politico-economic
spectrum within the academic community. For instance,
the university protects the right of a professor to
espouse views that suggest a demeaning relationship
between racial background and intelligence, but it would
not perrrut him to organize a forcible attempt to prevent
the Admissions Office from accepting black applicants.
It would allow a fascist professor to advocate abolition
of democratic processes, but would not let him interfere
with the conduct of university exercises dedicated
toward the exposition of democratic institutions.
Common to these examples is the institutional decision
that while those further toward the center of the politi
cal spectrum may practice what they preach, those at its
extremes may preach but are limited in their practice.
From Professor Franklin's viewpoint, this is an unfair
asymmetry. The majority of the community would
point out that in any even-handed balancing of rights,
the encouragement of violence constitutes an infringe
ment; to Professor Franklin the balancing of rights
appears insufficiently global. Because he makes the need
for incitement a political credo, a prosecution for the
advocacy of imminent lawless action becomes to him a
political persecution.
These descriptions do not solve the problem; they
only help to identity it. We cannot simultaneously re
dedicate the university to a specific political goal—by
using force or violence if necessary—and at the same
time preserve it as an institution in which independent
initiative from many quarters can have the widest possi
ble play. A choice must be made and we choose the
latter. Yet having made this choice, the university can
contemplate punishment of action—and most especially,
of speech—only when the rights claimed by the dissi
dents seriously infringe those of other groups or individ
uals within the university. Punishment should follow
only when strongly persuasive evidence has been devel
oped that such infringement has actually occured.
E. GUIDELINES FOR SEVERITY OF SANCTION
1. Modifying Circumstances. On the basis of the
above considerations we are prepared to consider as
mitigating issues of motivation, overriding necessity, and
a variety of factors that may be understandable within
Professor Franklin's framework of convictions but not
within our own or those of most of our colleagues. At
the same time we are prepared to consider as justifica
tion for a relatively more severe penality a pattern of
conduct which systematically threatens the university as
an institution in which decentralized individual initiative
can have the widest possible range.
However, within this balanced input we believe that,
in case of doubt, those criteria that are external to the
factual fabric of the charges should be applied asym
metrically in favor of the defendent, since (1) such
matters were not taken into account in findings of fact,
(2) the perceptions of reality held by the Board are
generally more shared with those of the Administration
than with those of Professor Franklin.
2. The Purpose of Sanction. The purpose of sanction
can be to retaliate, to rehabilitate, or to deter further
violations. We hope that in a university setting only the
last two deserve consideration; and we must ask what
importance to attach to each.
We are highly dubious whether rehabilitation is a
useful concept in this case. Professor Franklin's an
nounced convictions about the guilt of the university
appear deeply-held, and his opposition to the institution
in its present form seems implacable. We believe him
when he expresses his regret that his role in converting
the university to "serve the people" is restricted by
practical reasons to advocacy rather than action. "Re
habilitation" might appear to Professor Franklin as a
highly unfair mandate to change his convictions. Barring

a dramatic change in perception he is unlikely to change
his conduct; thus "rehabilitation" is likely to fail, what
ever the sanction.
It can be argued in contrast that the deterring func
tion of penalty has real force. By setting a price on
proscribed conduct, the university can make its members
consider carefully the line that separates forbidden from
permitted speech and action, and avoid crossing that
line. In establishing a penalty, the institution in effect
announces the degree to which it is attached to its own
values. Such an announcement insists that persons con
sidering borderline conduct must locate the border; for
wnen there is no deterrent to illegal acts, it hardly pays
to have a law.
3. The Range of Possible Sanctions. Dismissal severs
the connection between the defendant and the institu
tion; a lesser sanction assumes that a satisfactory rela
tionship between Professor Franklin and the other mem
bers of the university can be re-established. In consider
ing the appropriateness of a lesser penalty, we must thus
consider (! ) whether it will actually deter, and whether
deterrence is a reasonable expectation at all; (2) whether
it appropriately announces the institution's attachment
to the value measured.
There is no absolute way of defining the deterrent
value of penalty. Some professions (and some people)
are especially sensitive to economic sanctions, others to
censure. If that proposition is granted, a certain finding
of fact can still justify a range of penalties that differ in
kind as well as in severity. Between mere censure and
dismissal there is an intermediate range of possible sanc
tions that is populated primarily by such mechanisms as
suspension (with or without pay) and probation.
We do not hold probation to be workable. Where
such a right as tenure is involved, probation merely
challenges it authenticity; and probation is too often an

excuse for the removal of due process. Suspension is
another matter, and encompasses three kinds of sanc
tion. There is, first, the loss of privilege-to teach and to
use the full range of the academy's resources. Professor
Franklin has already suffered -irreversibly-the penalty
of suspension with pay since February 12, 1971; this is a
long time, although he has contributed substantially to
its length. Second, suspension may also involve loss of
salary. Finally, the imposition of any penalty, suspen
sion included, produces a subtle but real change in
professional status. Sanction imposed by a council of his
peers would surely detract from the offender's standing
in the academic community at large.
For all these reasons suspension without pay ranging
from one quarter upward is a substantial penalty—in
terms of financial cost, in terms of lost academic partici
pation, and in terms of lowered professional status and
consequent loss of mobility. Suspension of too great a
lenght is not practicable, because at some point the
defendent—whom we must assume to be economically
vulnerable-becomes likely to be forced into irreversible
occupational alternatives.
Dismissal is a penalty of undoubted severity because
of its absolute effect upon the immediate institutional
relationship combined with its impact upon employment
opportunities elsewhere within and even outside the
profession. The severity of dismissal as a penalty can be
softened somewhat by a financial settlement which
would permit time for the exploration of alternatives.
The more severe penalties are not in our view in
appropriately matched to the gravity of the charges.
Incitement to violent, coercive, lawless action—however
it may be modified in final judgment by any of the
factors discusses above—is a heavy attack upon the insti
tution of which Professor Franklin is a member.
