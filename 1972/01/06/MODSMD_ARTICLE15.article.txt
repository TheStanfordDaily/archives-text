# Board Decision

1. Findings on University Charges
The following numbered paragraphs of the "State
ment of Charges" of the University administration re
quire a finding by the Board: 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10. Of these
No. 6 does not involve Professor Franklin's conduct, but
is sustained unanimously by the Board.
The findings of fact by the seven-member Board on
those paragraphs involving Professor Franklin's conduct
are as follows:
7 The Lodge Incident
The Board unanimously does not sustain this
charge.
8 White Plaza Rally
The Board unanimously sustains this charge.
9 Computation Center Incident
The Board sustains this charge. Two members of
the Board (Brown, Kennedy) do not.
10 Old Union Courtyard Rally
The Board sustains this charge. Two members of
the Board (Brown, Kennedy) do not.
The violations sustained constitute, in the Board's
judgment, "substantial and manifest neglect of duty or
personal conduct substantially impairing the individual's
performance of his appropriate function within the Uni
versity community," and are therefore sanctionable
under the Statement of Policy on Appointment and
Tenure.
2. Sanctions
The Board has sustained Professor Franklin's culpa
bility on three charges, unanimously on one charge and
with two of the seven members dissenting on two
charges. The University administration argues that dis
missal is the appropriate penalty for each of the three
offenses.
We agree that each of the offenses is a serious one;
since we find Professor Franklin culpable on three
charges, we need not decide whether any one alone
would justify dismissal. Taken together, however, the
three offenses comprise, in our judgment, major viola
tions of the professional responsibilities and duties of a
professor in this University under the Statement of
Policy on Appointment and Tenure, the Policy on Cam
pus Disruptions, and the common traditions of this and
other universities. Giving the fullest weight to Professor
Franklin's personal rights to advocate vigorously his
political views, we are unable to escape the conclusion
that by his conduct he repeatedly and seriously infringed
the rights of others in the University, and significantly
increased the risk of injury to them and to University
property. He did so by urging and inciting to the use of
illegal coercion and violence, methods intolerable in a
university devoted to the free exchange and exploration
of ideas.
In the preceding Discussion of Sanctions, all the
members of the Board enumerated the factors which
affect the choice of proper sanctions, once findings of
facts are established. Accordingly, we considered possi
ble mitigating circumstances as well as those circum
stances which make Professor Franklin's behavior more
unacceptable. We conclude that these roughly offset
each other. On balance, they do not argue against what
would otherwise be the appropriate penalty for such
grave offenses. Nor do we doubt Professor Franklin's
own testimony that he would continue the type of
behavior charged here; indeed, he considered both his
own and his political associates' behavior to have been
"too weak" during some of the incidents covered by the
charges.
The real issue in these hearings is Professor Franklin's
behavior on the offenses charged, not his political views.
Diversity of political views is a great asset to the Univer
sity. The charges here, however, are incitement to use of
unlawful coercion and violence and increasing the danger
of injury to others as means to achieving Professor
Franklin's goals; it is that behavior, not his political
views and their expression, which we judge unaccepta
ble. Indeed, we note with approval that others holding
and expounding extreme political views are today highly
respected members of the Stanford faculty. Our decision
silences neither political dissent nor criticism of the
University. The only speech or behavior repressed by
this Board's findings is that which clearly urges and
incites others to unlawful coercion or violence, or to acts
likely to increase the risk of injury to other persons. We
believe such behavior should be restrained;insistence on
such standards of faculty conduct will not chill open and
robust dissent on this or any other campus.
The Board is also critical of Professor Franklin's de
liberate choice, demonstrated by action as well as by his
testimony, to attempt to protect his own position as
professor in the University while at the same time in
citing others, including students, to expose themselves to
expulsion or criminal charges.
Despite the severity of these offenses, we have
weighed carefully possible sanctions short of dismissal.
But a lesser penalty would fail to recognize the funda

mental nature and severity of Professor Franklin's at
tacks on the University of which he is a member. Toler
ance of such attacks on the freedom of others, under the
guise of protecting Professor Franklin's freedom to act
as he wishes, would be subversion, not support, of true
academic freedom and individual rights. It is precisely
because unlawful coercion and violence infringe upon
the rights of others in the University that the charges
against Professor Franklin are such serious ones.
We believe, given all these considerations, that im
mediate dismissal of Professor Franklin from the Univer
sity is warranted. In view of the difficulty of developing
alternative sources of income at this time, we recom
mend that a sum equal to Professor Franklin's salary
until August 31, 1972, be paid to him.
MINORITY DECISION:
PROFESSORS BROWN AND KENNEDY
In determining the appropriate penalty given our own
findings of fact, we have considered carefully the Univer
sity administration's argument that dismissal is the
appropriate sanction if we sustain any of the last three
charges.
The findings on the White Plaza speech on February
10th dictate, in our view, a serious penalty. Although we
differ slightly about the relation between the earlier part
of Professor Franklin's speech and its conclusion, we
agree that his call to shut down the Computation Center,
given its context and its position at the end of the rally,
was clear and unambiguous. Its force is blunted only by
the claim that it was, in a sense, an afterthought to the
rest of the speech; but even as an afterthought it pro
vided immediate impetus for a move to occupy a Univer
sity facility. Our view of the offense is not substantially
mitigated by Professor Franklin's attempt to convert the
context of his instructions into one appropriate for a call
to a "voluntary boycott" or "strike"—terms whose am
biguity is amply demonstrated in the testimony. Indeed,
the unimpressive analysis of syntax that characterized
Professor Franklin's defense on this charge left us wish
ing instead for an honest appeal to the urgency of
outraged conscience.
Although we find this violation a serious one, we
cannot agree that dismissal is the appropriate penalty for
it. The following elements contribute to that view:
First, suspension is itself a severe penalty. It works
substantial professional and financial hardships—sub
stantial enough to provide a significant deterrent to
Professor Franklin and others. It is therefore an ade
quate advertisement of the University's devotion to the
principles under attack by Professor Franklin.
Second, Professor Franklin has stated his intention to
be a non-participant in any action he supposes to be
punishable. If he has correctly represented his feeling
that in his case the line between permitted and pro
scribed conduct was vague to him, then surely the
Board's emphasis on its position with respect to incite
ment will be informative. We can tentatively accept the
proposition that for someone with a perception of reali
ty different from our own, that line might have seemed
blurred; but then we must also assume that the present
clarification, coupled with Professor Franklin's an
nounced determination to avoid dismissal, will be help
ful in preventing further violations.
Third, while it is true that Professor Franklin's pres
ent ideological position will encourage further coercive
acts against the University and that some of these will be
unlawful, we cannot assume his position to be static. It
can therefore not be argued conclusively that dismissal is
appropriate merely because other penalties would be
without effect.
Fourth, we would argue a careful weighing of the
costs of dismissal to the University relative to the risks
of future violations. These issues have been outlined in
the preceding section. We here discuss those that seem to
us especially important, in light of the fact that our own
findings of fact could justify a range of penalties, per
haps including dismissal, (a) The University thrives on
diversity and challenge. When we lose a prominent
symbol of these qualities, we lose not only the substance
of the challenge, but also the external perception that
we can take it in stride. In some quarters, the latter
effect could be damaging—for example, less well-buffer
ed institutions may become more vulnerable to outside
pressures to get rid of controversial faculty members, (b)
Because we live in a society in which there are increasing
public pressures to curb dissident speech and action, the
University has a special responsibility to insulate its
procedures from such influences. That need is magnified
by the special significance of tenure, which historically
protects the institution's faculty from social trends
toward political conformity. We should therefore be
scrupulous in protecting violators of University rules
against excessive penalties imposed by collective judg
ment, especially when those violators espouse uncom
fortably heterodox views, (c) Foi all these reasons, the
