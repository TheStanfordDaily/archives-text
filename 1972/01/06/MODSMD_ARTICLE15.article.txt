# Board Decision

### 
1. Findings on University Charges
The following numbered paragraphs of the "State
ment of Charges" of the University administration re
quire a finding by the Board: 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10. Of these
No. 6 does not involve Professor Franklin's conduct, but
is sustained unanimously by the Board.
The findings of fact by the seven-member Board on
those paragraphs involving Professor Franklin's conduct
are as follows:
7 The Lodge Incident
The Board unanimously does not sustain this
charge.
8 White Plaza Rally
The Board unanimously sustains this charge.
9 Computation Center Incident
The Board sustains this charge. Two members of
the Board (Brown, Kennedy) do not.
10 Old Union Courtyard Rally
The Board sustains this charge. Two members of
the Board (Brown, Kennedy) do not.
The violations sustained constitute, in the Board's
judgment, "substantial and manifest neglect of duty or
personal conduct substantially impairing the individual's
performance of his appropriate function within the Uni
versity community," and are therefore sanctionable
under the Statement of Policy on Appointment and
Tenure.
2. Sanctions
The Board has sustained Professor Franklin's culpa
bility on three charges, unanimously on one charge and
with two of the seven members dissenting on two
charges. The University administration argues that dis
missal is the appropriate penalty for each of the three
offenses.
We agree that each of the offenses is a serious one;
since we find Professor Franklin culpable on three
charges, we need not decide whether any one alone
would justify dismissal. Taken together, however, the
three offenses comprise, in our judgment, major viola
tions of the professional responsibilities and duties of a
professor in this University under the Statement of
Policy on Appointment and Tenure, the Policy on Cam
pus Disruptions, and the common traditions of this and
other universities. Giving the fullest weight to Professor
Franklin's personal rights to advocate vigorously his
political views, we are unable to escape the conclusion
that by his conduct he repeatedly and seriously infringed
the rights of others in the University, and significantly
increased the risk of injury to them and to University
property. He did so by urging and inciting to the use of
illegal coercion and violence, methods intolerable in a
university devoted to the free exchange and exploration
of ideas.
In the preceding Discussion of Sanctions, all the
members of the Board enumerated the factors which
affect the choice of proper sanctions, once findings of
facts are established. Accordingly, we considered possi
ble mitigating circumstances as well as those circum
stances which make Professor Franklin's behavior more
unacceptable. We conclude that these roughly offset
each other. On balance, they do not argue against what
would otherwise be the appropriate penalty for such
grave offenses. Nor do we doubt Professor Franklin's
own testimony that he would continue the type of
behavior charged here; indeed, he considered both his
own and his political associates' behavior to have been
"too weak" during some of the incidents covered by the
charges.
The real issue in these hearings is Professor Franklin's
behavior on the offenses charged, not his political views.
Diversity of political views is a great asset to the Univer
sity. The charges here, however, are incitement to use of
unlawful coercion and violence and increasing the danger
of injury to others as means to achieving Professor
Franklin's goals; it is that behavior, not his political
views and their expression, which we judge unaccepta
ble. Indeed, we note with approval that others holding
and expounding extreme political views are today highly
respected members of the Stanford faculty. Our decision
silences neither political dissent nor criticism of the
University. The only speech or behavior repressed by
this Board's findings is that which clearly urges and
incites others to unlawful coercion or violence, or to acts
likely to increase the risk of injury to other persons. We
believe such behavior should be restrained;insistence on
such standards of faculty conduct will not chill open and
robust dissent on this or any other campus.
The Board is also critical of Professor Franklin's de
liberate choice, demonstrated by action as well as by his
testimony, to attempt to protect his own position as
professor in the University while at the same time in
citing others, including students, to expose themselves to
expulsion or criminal charges.
Despite the severity of these offenses, we have
weighed carefully possible sanctions short of dismissal.
But a lesser penalty would fail to recognize the funda

mental nature and severity of Professor Franklin's at
tacks on the University of which he is a member. Toler
ance of such attacks on the freedom of others, under the
guise of protecting Professor Franklin's freedom to act
as he wishes, would be subversion, not support, of true
academic freedom and individual rights. It is precisely
because unlawful coercion and violence infringe upon
the rights of others in the University that the charges
against Professor Franklin are such serious ones.
We believe, given all these considerations, that im
mediate dismissal of Professor Franklin from the Univer
sity is warranted. In view of the difficulty of developing
alternative sources of income at this time, we recom
mend that a sum equal to Professor Franklin's salary
until August 31, 1972, be paid to him.
MINORITY DECISION:
PROFESSORS BROWN AND KENNEDY
In determining the appropriate penalty given our own
findings of fact, we have considered carefully the Univer
sity administration's argument that dismissal is the
appropriate sanction if we sustain any of the last three
charges.
The findings on the White Plaza speech on February
10th dictate, in our view, a serious penalty. Although we
differ slightly about the relation between the earlier part
of Professor Franklin's speech and its conclusion, we
agree that his call to shut down the Computation Center,
given its context and its position at the end of the rally,
was clear and unambiguous. Its force is blunted only by
the claim that it was, in a sense, an afterthought to the
rest of the speech; but even as an afterthought it pro
vided immediate impetus for a move to occupy a Univer
sity facility. Our view of the offense is not substantially
mitigated by Professor Franklin's attempt to convert the
context of his instructions into one appropriate for a call
to a "voluntary boycott" or "strike"—terms whose am
biguity is amply demonstrated in the testimony. Indeed,
the unimpressive analysis of syntax that characterized
Professor Franklin's defense on this charge left us wish
ing instead for an honest appeal to the urgency of
outraged conscience.
Although we find this violation a serious one, we
cannot agree that dismissal is the appropriate penalty for
it. The following elements contribute to that view:
First, suspension is itself a severe penalty. It works
substantial professional and financial hardships—sub
stantial enough to provide a significant deterrent to
Professor Franklin and others. It is therefore an ade
quate advertisement of the University's devotion to the
principles under attack by Professor Franklin.
Second, Professor Franklin has stated his intention to
be a non-participant in any action he supposes to be
punishable. If he has correctly represented his feeling
that in his case the line between permitted and pro
scribed conduct was vague to him, then surely the
Board's emphasis on its position with respect to incite
ment will be informative. We can tentatively accept the
proposition that for someone with a perception of reali
ty different from our own, that line might have seemed
blurred; but then we must also assume that the present
clarification, coupled with Professor Franklin's an
nounced determination to avoid dismissal, will be help
ful in preventing further violations.
Third, while it is true that Professor Franklin's pres
ent ideological position will encourage further coercive
acts against the University and that some of these will be
unlawful, we cannot assume his position to be static. It
can therefore not be argued conclusively that dismissal is
appropriate merely because other penalties would be
without effect.
Fourth, we would argue a careful weighing of the
costs of dismissal to the University relative to the risks
of future violations. These issues have been outlined in
the preceding section. We here discuss those that seem to
us especially important, in light of the fact that our own
findings of fact could justify a range of penalties, per
haps including dismissal, (a) The University thrives on
diversity and challenge. When we lose a prominent
symbol of these qualities, we lose not only the substance
of the challenge, but also the external perception that
we can take it in stride. In some quarters, the latter
effect could be damaging—for example, less well-buffer
ed institutions may become more vulnerable to outside
pressures to get rid of controversial faculty members, (b)
Because we live in a society in which there are increasing
public pressures to curb dissident speech and action, the
University has a special responsibility to insulate its
procedures from such influences. That need is magnified
by the special significance of tenure, which historically
protects the institution's faculty from social trends
toward political conformity. We should therefore be
scrupulous in protecting violators of University rules
against excessive penalties imposed by collective judg
ment, especially when those violators espouse uncom
fortably heterodox views, (c) Foi all these reasons, the
if i
University is obliged to tolerate a great deal of what it
does not like. We sec substantial costs in Professor
Franklin's loss to the institution; they arc measured
externally in the form of corrosive effects on academic
freedom, and internally in terms of lost challenge and
the subtle inhibition of dissent.
In light of these considerations, Professor Kennedy
recommends that Professor Franklin's suspension be
continued through the remainder of the current aca
demic year and that his suspension be without pay for
one of the remaining quarters; Professor Brown recom
mends that in view of the time Professor Franklin has
already been suspended, his suspension be continued
through the Winter Quarter only, suspension for that
quarter to be without pay.
ADDENDUM TO MINORITY DECISION:
PROFESSOR BROWN
Since I found against Professor Franklin on only one
of the four charges, it may seem gratuitous to discuss
possible penalty had I found him culpable on any of the
other charges as well. However, in view of the time and
resources the University has asked us to devote to this
and the gravity of the issues posed, I consider it
both appropriate and necessary as a member of the
Board to address myself to the question.
I strongly urge the University administration and the
Board of Trustees to consider once again, before taking
final action, whether a dismissal penalty does not repre
sent a higher cost than the University ought to pay. My
dorvir*Mrc from ♦ Hr» rnninritv in nrMWion to a Hifforpnt
I

finding of fact, focusses on the difference between the
majority's belief that possible mitigating factors tend to
be cancelled out by Professor Franklin's ongoing pattern
of conduct, and my belief that there are certain miti
gating factors that should be given proportionately great
er weight. The four elements of the argument against
dismissal made in the minority decision can additionally
be offered as mitigating factors even in the face of a
more severe finding of fact, and I urge that they be
re-examined in that context before a final decision is
reached.
There are three points I wish to emphasize more
strongly than does the report as a whole, which I believe
militate against dismissal as an appropriate penalty:
I. While I acknowledge with the majority that the
University is more fragile than its attackers or defenders
often realize, I put greater stress on the need for the
University to be the scrupulous, even over-zealous,
champion of the rights of the individual. The University,
whatever its vulnerabilities, has many champions at work
defending its interests. The individual, on the other
hand, particularly if he espouses unpopular beliefs, is not
so amply blessed with supporters. He will inevitably have
tougher going and therefore needs a special degree of
championing. This is particularly important in the area
of speech; for speech that goes "up to the line" of what
is permissible is extraordinarily important speech both
to the university and to society, since it is through such
speech that new insights are often born. If there is the
slightest possibility that an individual, called to account
for speech that transposes ncrmisciblp hnunHTipc

more clearly respect such boundaries in the future, he
deserves to be given that chance. A severe penalty does
not deny him that opportunity, but dismissal does. In a
matter as crucial as this, I put great stress on the point
made in the Discussion of Sanctions that the balancing
of probabilities should be tipped in favor of the individ
ual; I believe it is the business of the University to be the
community where the balances are so tipped. If such a
stance makes the University fragile, it is equally true that
such a stance makes the University strong.
2. Although the Board's joint Discussion of Sanc
tions indicates that one's perception of reality could be a
mitigating factor, I place more weight on this than does
the majority. Even though Professor Franklin did not
choose to develop this point in a systematic way in his
defense, it is clear from the testimony that his indigna
tion at many injustices that he sees in the world inevita
bly leads him to vehement attack on those whom he
considers the purveyors of injustice. When we describe
his speech and manner as angry or strident, we must not
forget that from his perception of reality there is a great
deal to be angry and strident about. Indeed, we must
acknowledge that his perception of reality colors his
own definitions of what constitutes his "appropriate
functions within the University community," leading
him to seek for ways to acquaint his hearers with the
reality of police oppression in the ghettos, the commit
ting of war crimes in Southeast Asia, the immorality of
certain kinds of war-related research, and so on. While
we can properly demand, by a severe penalty, that his
sneecll and action not rirriirmrTibp thn riohtc r»f nftwc
I

we must recognize that the penalty of dismissal would
deny him a chance to apply his own perception of
reality within boundaries of permissible conduct that
may now be clearer to him.
3. There is a final point we may not ignore. This is a
recognition that many aspects of the University need to
be changed. Those of us within the University share
responsibility for many of the evils of our society, some
times by our neglect of means for bringing about change,
and sometimes by our tacit if not overt approval of the
involvement of the University and University personnel
in ongoing social structures of human oppression. Albeit
it in a harsh and strident manner, Professor Franklin has
helped to call attention to many of these realities. He
has not been alone, of course, in doing this, and others
may have joined the issues more effectively and creative
ly than he has done. But his has been an important
voice, however uncomfortable it makes the rest of us.
Dismissal would deprive us of that voice, whereas a
penalty short of dismissal would not do so unless Pro
fessor Franklin chose in the future to disregard its warn
ing.
I believe very strongly that, however, much I and
many of my colleagues may disagree with what Professor
Franklin says or how he says it, Stanford University will
be less a true university without him and more of a true
university with him. I fear that we may do untold harm
to ourselves and to the cause of higher education unless,
by imposing a penalty short of dismissal, we seek to
keep him as a very uncomfortable but very important
part of what this University, or any university, is meant
to bp

would otherwise be the appropriate penalty for such
grave offenses. Nor do we doubt Professor Franklin's
own testimony that he would continue the type of
behavior charged here; indeed, he considered both his
own and his political associates' behavior to have been
"too weak" during some of the incidents covered by the
charges.
The real issue in these hearings is Professor Franklin's
behavior on the offenses charged, not his political views.
Diversity of political views is a great asset to the Univer
sity. The charges here, however, are incitement to use of
unlawful coercion and violence and increasing the danger
of injury to others as means to achieving Professor
Franklin's goals; it is that behavior, not his political
views and their expression, which we judge unaccepta
ble. Indeed, we note with approval that others holding
and expounding extreme political views are today highly
respected members of the Stanford faculty. Our decision
silences neither political dissent nor criticism of the
University. The only speech or behavior repressed by
this Board's findings is that which clearly urges and
incites others to unlawful coercion or violence, or to acts
likely to increase the risk of injury to other persons. We
believe such behavior should be restrained;insistence on
such standards of faculty conduct will not chill open and
robust dissent on this or any other campus.
The Board is also critical of Professor Franklin's de
liberate choice, demonstrated by action as well as by his
testimony, to attempt to protect his own position as
professor in the University while at the same time in
citing others, including students, to expose themselves to
expulsion or criminal charges.
Despite the severity of these offenses, we have
weighed carefully possible sanctions short of dismissal.
But a lesser penalty would fail to recognize the funda

mental nature and severity of Professor Franklin's at
tacks on the University of which he is a member. Toler
ance of such attacks on the freedom of others, under the
guise of protecting Professor Franklin's freedom to act
as he wishes, would be subversion, not support, of true
academic freedom and individual rights. It is precisely
because unlawful coercion and violence infringe upon
the rights of others in the University that the charges
against Professor Franklin are such serious ones.
We believe, given all these considerations, that im
mediate dismissal of Professor Franklin from the Univer
sity is warranted. In view of the difficulty of developing
alternative sources of income at this time, we recom
mend that a sum equal to Professor Franklin's salary
until August 31, 1972, be paid to him.
MINORITY DECISION:
PROFESSORS BROWN AND KENNEDY
In determining the appropriate penalty given our own
findings of fact, we have considered carefully the Univer
sity administration's argument that dismissal is the
appropriate sanction if we sustain any of the last three
charges.
The findings on the White Plaza speech on February
10th dictate, in our view, a serious penalty. Although we
differ slightly about the relation between the earlier part
of Professor Franklin's speech and its conclusion, we
agree that his call to shut down the Computation Center,
given its context and its position at the end of the rally,
was clear and unambiguous. Its force is blunted only by
the claim that it was, in a sense, an afterthought to the
rest of the speech; but even as an afterthought it pro
vided immediate impetus for a move to occupy a Univer
sity facility. Our view of the offense is not substantially
mitigated by Professor Franklin's attempt to convert the
context of his instructions into one appropriate for a call
to a "voluntary boycott" or "strike"—terms whose am
biguity is amply demonstrated in the testimony. Indeed,
the unimpressive analysis of syntax that characterized
Professor Franklin's defense on this charge left us wish
ing instead for an honest appeal to the urgency of
outraged conscience.
Although we find this violation a serious one, we
cannot agree that dismissal is the appropriate penalty for
it. The following elements contribute to that view:
First, suspension is itself a severe penalty. It works
substantial professional and financial hardships—sub
stantial enough to provide a significant deterrent to
Professor Franklin and others. It is therefore an ade
quate advertisement of the University's devotion to the
principles under attack by Professor Franklin.
Second, Professor Franklin has stated his intention to
be a non-participant in any action he supposes to be
punishable. If he has correctly represented his feeling
that in his case the line between permitted and pro
scribed conduct was vague to him, then surely the
Board's emphasis on its position with respect to incite
ment will be informative. We can tentatively accept the
proposition that for someone with a perception of reali
ty different from our own, that line might have seemed
blurred; but then we must also assume that the present
clarification, coupled with Professor Franklin's an
nounced determination to avoid dismissal, will be help
ful in preventing further violations.
Third, while it is true that Professor Franklin's pres
ent ideological position will encourage further coercive
acts against the University and that some of these will be
unlawful, we cannot assume his position to be static. It
can therefore not be argued conclusively that dismissal is
appropriate merely because other penalties would be
without effect.
Fourth, we would argue a careful weighing of the
costs of dismissal to the University relative to the risks
of future violations. These issues have been outlined in
the preceding section. We here discuss those that seem to
us especially important, in light of the fact that our own
findings of fact could justify a range of penalties, per
haps including dismissal, (a) The University thrives on
diversity and challenge. When we lose a prominent
symbol of these qualities, we lose not only the substance
of the challenge, but also the external perception that
we can take it in stride. In some quarters, the latter
effect could be damaging—for example, less well-buffer
ed institutions may become more vulnerable to outside
pressures to get rid of controversial faculty members, (b)
Because we live in a society in which there are increasing
public pressures to curb dissident speech and action, the
University has a special responsibility to insulate its
procedures from such influences. That need is magnified
by the special significance of tenure, which historically
protects the institution's faculty from social trends
toward political conformity. We should therefore be
scrupulous in protecting violators of University rules
against excessive penalties imposed by collective judg
ment, especially when those violators espouse uncom
fortably heterodox views, (c) Foi all these reasons, the
if i
University is obliged to tolerate a great deal of what it
does not like. We sec substantial costs in Professor
Franklin's loss to the institution; they arc measured
externally in the form of corrosive effects on academic
freedom, and internally in terms of lost challenge and
the subtle inhibition of dissent.
In light of these considerations, Professor Kennedy
recommends that Professor Franklin's suspension be
continued through the remainder of the current aca
demic year and that his suspension be without pay for
one of the remaining quarters; Professor Brown recom
mends that in view of the time Professor Franklin has
already been suspended, his suspension be continued
through the Winter Quarter only, suspension for that
quarter to be without pay.
ADDENDUM TO MINORITY DECISION:
PROFESSOR BROWN
Since I found against Professor Franklin on only one
of the four charges, it may seem gratuitous to discuss
possible penalty had I found him culpable on any of the
other charges as well. However, in view of the time and
resources the University has asked us to devote to this
and the gravity of the issues posed, I consider it
both appropriate and necessary as a member of the
Board to address myself to the question.
I strongly urge the University administration and the
Board of Trustees to consider once again, before taking
final action, whether a dismissal penalty does not repre
sent a higher cost than the University ought to pay. My
dorvir*Mrc from ♦ Hr» rnninritv in nrMWion to a Hifforpnt
I

finding of fact, focusses on the difference between the
majority's belief that possible mitigating factors tend to
be cancelled out by Professor Franklin's ongoing pattern
of conduct, and my belief that there are certain miti
gating factors that should be given proportionately great
er weight. The four elements of the argument against
dismissal made in the minority decision can additionally
be offered as mitigating factors even in the face of a
more severe finding of fact, and I urge that they be
re-examined in that context before a final decision is
reached.
There are three points I wish to emphasize more
strongly than does the report as a whole, which I believe
militate against dismissal as an appropriate penalty:
I. While I acknowledge with the majority that the
University is more fragile than its attackers or defenders
often realize, I put greater stress on the need for the
University to be the scrupulous, even over-zealous,
champion of the rights of the individual. The University,
whatever its vulnerabilities, has many champions at work
defending its interests. The individual, on the other
hand, particularly if he espouses unpopular beliefs, is not
so amply blessed with supporters. He will inevitably have
tougher going and therefore needs a special degree of
championing. This is particularly important in the area
of speech; for speech that goes "up to the line" of what
is permissible is extraordinarily important speech both
to the university and to society, since it is through such
speech that new insights are often born. If there is the
slightest possibility that an individual, called to account
for speech that transposes ncrmisciblp hnunHTipc

more clearly respect such boundaries in the future, he
deserves to be given that chance. A severe penalty does
not deny him that opportunity, but dismissal does. In a
matter as crucial as this, I put great stress on the point
made in the Discussion of Sanctions that the balancing
of probabilities should be tipped in favor of the individ
ual; I believe it is the business of the University to be the
community where the balances are so tipped. If such a
stance makes the University fragile, it is equally true that
such a stance makes the University strong.
2. Although the Board's joint Discussion of Sanc
tions indicates that one's perception of reality could be a
mitigating factor, I place more weight on this than does
the majority. Even though Professor Franklin did not
choose to develop this point in a systematic way in his
defense, it is clear from the testimony that his indigna
tion at many injustices that he sees in the world inevita
bly leads him to vehement attack on those whom he
considers the purveyors of injustice. When we describe
his speech and manner as angry or strident, we must not
forget that from his perception of reality there is a great
deal to be angry and strident about. Indeed, we must
acknowledge that his perception of reality colors his
own definitions of what constitutes his "appropriate
functions within the University community," leading
him to seek for ways to acquaint his hearers with the
reality of police oppression in the ghettos, the commit
ting of war crimes in Southeast Asia, the immorality of
certain kinds of war-related research, and so on. While
we can properly demand, by a severe penalty, that his
sneecll and action not rirriirmrTibp thn riohtc r»f nftwc
I

we must recognize that the penalty of dismissal would
deny him a chance to apply his own perception of
reality within boundaries of permissible conduct that
may now be clearer to him.
3. There is a final point we may not ignore. This is a
recognition that many aspects of the University need to
be changed. Those of us within the University share
responsibility for many of the evils of our society, some
times by our neglect of means for bringing about change,
and sometimes by our tacit if not overt approval of the
involvement of the University and University personnel
in ongoing social structures of human oppression. Albeit
it in a harsh and strident manner, Professor Franklin has
helped to call attention to many of these realities. He
has not been alone, of course, in doing this, and others
may have joined the issues more effectively and creative
ly than he has done. But his has been an important
voice, however uncomfortable it makes the rest of us.
Dismissal would deprive us of that voice, whereas a
penalty short of dismissal would not do so unless Pro
fessor Franklin chose in the future to disregard its warn
ing.
I believe very strongly that, however, much I and
many of my colleagues may disagree with what Professor
Franklin says or how he says it, Stanford University will
be less a true university without him and more of a true
university with him. I fear that we may do untold harm
to ourselves and to the cause of higher education unless,
by imposing a penalty short of dismissal, we seek to
keep him as a very uncomfortable but very important
part of what this University, or any university, is meant
to bp
1. Findings on University Charges
The following numbered paragraphs of the "State
ment of Charges" of the University administration re
quire a finding by the Board: 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10. Of these
No. 6 does not involve Professor Franklin's conduct, but
is sustained unanimously by the Board.
The findings of fact by the seven-member Board on
those paragraphs involving Professor Franklin's conduct
are as follows:
7 The Lodge Incident
The Board unanimously does not sustain this
charge.
8 White Plaza Rally
The Board unanimously sustains this charge.
9 Computation Center Incident
The Board sustains this charge. Two members of
the Board (Brown, Kennedy) do not.
10 Old Union Courtyard Rally
The Board sustains this charge. Two members of
the Board (Brown, Kennedy) do not.
The violations sustained constitute, in the Board's
judgment, "substantial and manifest neglect of duty or
personal conduct substantially impairing the individual's
performance of his appropriate function within the Uni
versity community," and are therefore sanctionable
under the Statement of Policy on Appointment and
Tenure.
2. Sanctions
The Board has sustained Professor Franklin's culpa
bility on three charges, unanimously on one charge and
with two of the seven members dissenting on two
charges. The University administration argues that dis
missal is the appropriate penalty for each of the three
offenses.
We agree that each of the offenses is a serious one;
since we find Professor Franklin culpable on three
charges, we need not decide whether any one alone
would justify dismissal. Taken together, however, the
three offenses comprise, in our judgment, major viola
tions of the professional responsibilities and duties of a
professor in this University under the Statement of
Policy on Appointment and Tenure, the Policy on Cam
pus Disruptions, and the common traditions of this and
other universities. Giving the fullest weight to Professor
Franklin's personal rights to advocate vigorously his
political views, we are unable to escape the conclusion
that by his conduct he repeatedly and seriously infringed
the rights of others in the University, and significantly
increased the risk of injury to them and to University
property. He did so by urging and inciting to the use of
illegal coercion and violence, methods intolerable in a
university devoted to the free exchange and exploration
of ideas.
In the preceding Discussion of Sanctions, all the
members of the Board enumerated the factors which
affect the choice of proper sanctions, once findings of
facts are established. Accordingly, we considered possi
ble mitigating circumstances as well as those circum
stances which make Professor Franklin's behavior more
unacceptable. We conclude that these roughly offset
each other. On balance, they do not argue against what
would otherwise be the appropriate penalty for such
grave offenses. Nor do we doubt Professor Franklin's
own testimony that he would continue the type of
behavior charged here; indeed, he considered both his
own and his political associates' behavior to have been
"too weak" during some of the incidents covered by the

sity. The charges here, however, are incitement to use of

sity administration's argument that dismissal is the
appropriate sanction if we sustain any of the last three
charges.
The findings on the White Plaza speech on February
10th dictate, in our view, a serious penalty. Although we
differ slightly about the relation between the earlier part
of Professor Franklin's speech and its conclusion, we
agree that his call to shut down the Computation Center,
given its context and its position at the end of the rally,
was clear and unambiguous. Its force is blunted only by
the claim that it was, in a sense, an afterthought to the
rest of the speech; but even as an afterthought it pro
vided immediate impetus for a move to occupy a Univer
sity facility. Our view of the offense is not substantially
mitigated by Professor Franklin's attempt to convert the
context of his instructions into one appropriate for a call
to a "voluntary boycott" or "strike"—terms whose am
biguity is amply demonstrated in the testimony. Indeed,
the unimpressive analysis of syntax that characterized
Professor Franklin's defense on this charge left us wish
ing instead for an honest appeal to the urgency of
outraged conscience.
Although we find this violation a serious one, we
cannot agree that dismissal is the appropriate penalty for
it. The following elements contribute to that view:
First, suspension is itself a severe penalty. It works
substantial professional and financial hardships—sub
stantial enough to provide a significant deterrent to
Professor Franklin and others. It is therefore an ade
quate advertisement of the University's devotion to the
principles under attack by Professor Franklin.
Second, Professor Franklin has stated his intention to
be a non-participant in any action he supposes to be
punishable. If he has correctly represented his feeling
that in his case the line between permitted and pro
scribed conduct was vague to him, then surely the
Board's emphasis on its position with respect to incite
ment will be informative. We can tentatively accept the
proposition that for someone with a perception of reali
ty different from our own, that line might have seemed
blurred; but then we must also assume that the present
clarification, coupled with Professor Franklin's an
nounced determination to avoid dismissal, will be help
ful in preventing further violations.
Third, while it is true that Professor Franklin's pres
ent ideological position will encourage further coercive
acts against the University and that some of these will be
unlawful, we cannot assume his position to be static. It
can therefore not be argued conclusively that dismissal is
appropriate merely because other penalties would be
without effect.
Fourth, we would argue a careful weighing of the
costs of dismissal to the University relative to the risks
of future violations. These issues have been outlined in
the preceding section. We here discuss those that seem to
us especially important, in light of the fact that our own
findings of fact could justify a range of penalties, per
haps including dismissal, (a) The University thrives on
diversity and challenge. When we lose a prominent
symbol of these qualities, we lose not only the substance
of the challenge, but also the external perception that
we can take it in stride. In some quarters, the latter
effect could be damaging—for example, less well-buffer
ed institutions may become more vulnerable to outside
pressures to get rid of controversial faculty members, (b)
Because we live in a society in which there are increasing
public pressures to curb dissident speech and action, the
University has a special responsibility to insulate its
procedures from such influences. That need is magnified
by the special significance of tenure, which historically
protects the institution's faculty from social trends
toward political conformity. We should therefore be
scrupulous in protecting violators of University rules
against excessive penalties imposed by collective judg
ment, especially when those violators espouse uncom
fortably heterodox views, (c) Foi all these reasons, the
if i
University is obliged to tolerate a great deal of what it
does not like. We sec substantial costs in Professor
Franklin's loss to the institution; they arc measured
externally in the form of corrosive effects on academic
freedom, and internally in terms of lost challenge and
the subtle inhibition of dissent.
In light of these considerations, Professor Kennedy
recommends that Professor Franklin's suspension be
continued through the remainder of the current aca
demic year and that his suspension be without pay for
one of the remaining quarters; Professor Brown recom
mends that in view of the time Professor Franklin has
already been suspended, his suspension be continued
through the Winter Quarter only, suspension for that
quarter to be without pay.
ADDENDUM TO MINORITY DECISION:
PROFESSOR BROWN
Since I found against Professor Franklin on only one
of the four charges, it may seem gratuitous to discuss
possible penalty had I found him culpable on any of the
other charges as well. However, in view of the time and
resources the University has asked us to devote to this
and the gravity of the issues posed, I consider it
both appropriate and necessary as a member of the
Board to address myself to the question.
I strongly urge the University administration and the
Board of Trustees to consider once again, before taking
final action, whether a dismissal penalty does not repre
sent a higher cost than the University ought to pay. My
dorvir*Mrc from ♦ Hr» rnninritv in nrMWion to a Hifforpnt
I

finding of fact, focusses on the difference between the
majority's belief that possible mitigating factors tend to
be cancelled out by Professor Franklin's ongoing pattern
of conduct, and my belief that there are certain miti
gating factors that should be given proportionately great
er weight. The four elements of the argument against
dismissal made in the minority decision can additionally
be offered as mitigating factors even in the face of a
more severe finding of fact, and I urge that they be
re-examined in that context before a final decision is
reached.
There are three points I wish to emphasize more
strongly than does the report as a whole, which I believe
militate against dismissal as an appropriate penalty:
I. While I acknowledge with the majority that the
University is more fragile than its attackers or defenders
often realize, I put greater stress on the need for the
University to be the scrupulous, even over-zealous,
champion of the rights of the individual. The University,
whatever its vulnerabilities, has many champions at work
defending its interests. The individual, on the other
hand, particularly if he espouses unpopular beliefs, is not
so amply blessed with supporters. He will inevitably have
tougher going and therefore needs a special degree of
championing. This is particularly important in the area
of speech; for speech that goes "up to the line" of what
is permissible is extraordinarily important speech both
to the university and to society, since it is through such
speech that new insights are often born. If there is the
slightest possibility that an individual, called to account
for speech that transposes ncrmisciblp hnunHTipc

more clearly respect such boundaries in the future, he
deserves to be given that chance. A severe penalty does
not deny him that opportunity, but dismissal does. In a
matter as crucial as this, I put great stress on the point
made in the Discussion of Sanctions that the balancing
of probabilities should be tipped in favor of the individ
ual; I believe it is the business of the University to be the
community where the balances are so tipped. If such a
stance makes the University fragile, it is equally true that
such a stance makes the University strong.
2. Although the Board's joint Discussion of Sanc
tions indicates that one's perception of reality could be a
mitigating factor, I place more weight on this than does
the majority. Even though Professor Franklin did not
choose to develop this point in a systematic way in his
defense, it is clear from the testimony that his indigna
tion at many injustices that he sees in the world inevita
bly leads him to vehement attack on those whom he
considers the purveyors of injustice. When we describe
his speech and manner as angry or strident, we must not
forget that from his perception of reality there is a great
deal to be angry and strident about. Indeed, we must
acknowledge that his perception of reality colors his
own definitions of what constitutes his "appropriate
functions within the University community," leading
him to seek for ways to acquaint his hearers with the
reality of police oppression in the ghettos, the commit
ting of war crimes in Southeast Asia, the immorality of
certain kinds of war-related research, and so on. While
we can properly demand, by a severe penalty, that his
sneecll and action not rirriirmrTibp thn riohtc r»f nftwc
I

we must recognize that the penalty of dismissal would
deny him a chance to apply his own perception of
reality within boundaries of permissible conduct that
may now be clearer to him.
3. There is a final point we may not ignore. This is a
recognition that many aspects of the University need to
be changed. Those of us within the University share
responsibility for many of the evils of our society, some
times by our neglect of means for bringing about change,
and sometimes by our tacit if not overt approval of the
involvement of the University and University personnel
in ongoing social structures of human oppression. Albeit
it in a harsh and strident manner, Professor Franklin has
helped to call attention to many of these realities. He
has not been alone, of course, in doing this, and others
may have joined the issues more effectively and creative
ly than he has done. But his has been an important
voice, however uncomfortable it makes the rest of us.
Dismissal would deprive us of that voice, whereas a
penalty short of dismissal would not do so unless Pro
fessor Franklin chose in the future to disregard its warn
ing.
I believe very strongly that, however, much I and
many of my colleagues may disagree with what Professor
Franklin says or how he says it, Stanford University will
be less a true university without him and more of a true
university with him. I fear that we may do untold harm
to ourselves and to the cause of higher education unless,
by imposing a penalty short of dismissal, we seek to
keep him as a very uncomfortable but very important
part of what this University, or any university, is meant
to bp
1. Findings on University Charges
The following numbered paragraphs of the "State
ment of Charges" of the University administration re
quire a finding by the Board: 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10. Of these
No. 6 does not involve Professor Franklin's conduct, but
is sustained unanimously by the Board.
The findings of fact by the seven-member Board on
those paragraphs involving Professor Franklin's conduct
are as follows:
7 The Lodge Incident
The Board unanimously does not sustain this
charge.
8 White Plaza Rally
The Board unanimously sustains this charge.
9 Computation Center Incident
The Board sustains this charge. Two members of
the Board (Brown, Kennedy) do not.
10 Old Union Courtyard Rally
The Board sustains this charge. Two members of
the Board (Brown, Kennedy) do not.
The violations sustained constitute, in the Board's
judgment, "substantial and manifest neglect of duty or
personal conduct substantially impairing the individual's
performance of his appropriate function within the Uni
versity community," and are therefore sanctionable
under the Statement of Policy on Appointment and
Tenure.
2. Sanctions
The Board has sustained Professor Franklin's culpa
bility on three charges, unanimously on one charge and
with two of the seven members dissenting on two
charges. The University administration argues that dis
missal is the appropriate penalty for each of the three
offenses.
We agree that each of the offenses is a serious one;
since we find Professor Franklin culpable on three
charges, we need not decide whether any one alone
would justify dismissal. Taken together, however, the
three offenses comprise, in our judgment, major viola
tions of the professional responsibilities and duties of a
professor in this University under the Statement of
Policy on Appointment and Tenure, the Policy on Cam
pus Disruptions, and the common traditions of this and
other universities. Giving the fullest weight to Professor
Franklin's personal rights to advocate vigorously his
political views, we are unable to escape the conclusion
that by his conduct he repeatedly and seriously infringed
the rights of others in the University, and significantly
increased the risk of injury to them and to University
property. He did so by urging and inciting to the use of
illegal coercion and violence, methods intolerable in a
university devoted to the free exchange and exploration
of ideas.
In the preceding Discussion of Sanctions, all the
members of the Board enumerated the factors which
affect the choice of proper sanctions, once findings of
facts are established. Accordingly, we considered possi
ble mitigating circumstances as well as those circum
stances which make Professor Franklin's behavior more
unacceptable. We conclude that these roughly offset
each other. On balance, they do not argue against what
would otherwise be the appropriate penalty for such
grave offenses. Nor do we doubt Professor Franklin's
own testimony that he would continue the type of
behavior charged here; indeed, he considered both his
own and his political associates' behavior to have been
"too weak" during some of the incidents covered by the
charges.
The real issue in these hearings is Professor Franklin's
behavior on the offenses charged, not his political views.
Diversity of political views is a great asset to the Univer
sity. The charges here, however, are incitement to use of
unlawful coercion and violence and increasing the danger
of injury to others as means to achieving Professor
Franklin's goals; it is that behavior, not his political
views and their expression, which we judge unaccepta
ble. Indeed, we note with approval that others holding
and expounding extreme political views are today highly
respected members of the Stanford faculty. Our decision
silences neither political dissent nor criticism of the
University. The only speech or behavior repressed by
this Board's findings is that which clearly urges and
incites others to unlawful coercion or violence, or to acts
likely to increase the risk of injury to other persons. We
believe such behavior should be restrained;insistence on
such standards of faculty conduct will not chill open and
robust dissent on this or any other campus.
The Board is also critical of Professor Franklin's de
liberate choice, demonstrated by action as well as by his
testimony, to attempt to protect his own position as
professor in the University while at the same time in
citing others, including students, to expose themselves to
expulsion or criminal charges.
Despite the severity of these offenses, we have
weighed carefully possible sanctions short of dismissal.
But a lesser penalty would fail to recognize the funda

mental nature and severity of Professor Franklin's at
tacks on the University of which he is a member. Toler
ance of such attacks on the freedom of others, under the
guise of protecting Professor Franklin's freedom to act
as he wishes, would be subversion, not support, of true
academic freedom and individual rights. It is precisely
because unlawful coercion and violence infringe upon
the rights of others in the University that the charges
against Professor Franklin are such serious ones.
We believe, given all these considerations, that im
mediate dismissal of Professor Franklin from the Univer
sity is warranted. In view of the difficulty of developing
alternative sources of income at this time, we recom
mend that a sum equal to Professor Franklin's salary
until August 31, 1972, be paid to him.

the preceding section. We here discuss those that seem to
us especially important, in light of the fact that our own
findings of fact could justify a range of penalties, per
haps including dismissal, (a) The University thrives on
diversity and challenge. When we lose a prominent
symbol of these qualities, we lose not only the substance
of the challenge, but also the external perception that
we can take it in stride. In some quarters, the latter
effect could be damaging—for example, less well-buffer
ed institutions may become more vulnerable to outside
pressures to get rid of controversial faculty members, (b)
Because we live in a society in which there are increasing
public pressures to curb dissident speech and action, the
University has a special responsibility to insulate its
procedures from such influences. That need is magnified
by the special significance of tenure, which historically
protects the institution's faculty from social trends
toward political conformity. We should therefore be
scrupulous in protecting violators of University rules
against excessive penalties imposed by collective judg
ment, especially when those violators espouse uncom
fortably heterodox views, (c) Foi all these reasons, the
if i
University is obliged to tolerate a great deal of what it
does not like. We sec substantial costs in Professor
Franklin's loss to the institution; they arc measured
externally in the form of corrosive effects on academic
freedom, and internally in terms of lost challenge and
the subtle inhibition of dissent.
In light of these considerations, Professor Kennedy
recommends that Professor Franklin's suspension be
continued through the remainder of the current aca
demic year and that his suspension be without pay for
one of the remaining quarters; Professor Brown recom
mends that in view of the time Professor Franklin has
already been suspended, his suspension be continued
through the Winter Quarter only, suspension for that
quarter to be without pay.
ADDENDUM TO MINORITY DECISION:
PROFESSOR BROWN
Since I found against Professor Franklin on only one
of the four charges, it may seem gratuitous to discuss
possible penalty had I found him culpable on any of the
other charges as well. However, in view of the time and
resources the University has asked us to devote to this
and the gravity of the issues posed, I consider it
both appropriate and necessary as a member of the
Board to address myself to the question.
I strongly urge the University administration and the
Board of Trustees to consider once again, before taking
final action, whether a dismissal penalty does not repre
sent a higher cost than the University ought to pay. My
dorvir*Mrc from ♦ Hr» rnninritv in nrMWion to a Hifforpnt
I

finding of fact, focusses on the difference between the
majority's belief that possible mitigating factors tend to
be cancelled out by Professor Franklin's ongoing pattern
of conduct, and my belief that there are certain miti
gating factors that should be given proportionately great
er weight. The four elements of the argument against
dismissal made in the minority decision can additionally
be offered as mitigating factors even in the face of a
more severe finding of fact, and I urge that they be
re-examined in that context before a final decision is
reached.
There are three points I wish to emphasize more
strongly than does the report as a whole, which I believe
militate against dismissal as an appropriate penalty:
I. While I acknowledge with the majority that the
University is more fragile than its attackers or defenders
often realize, I put greater stress on the need for the
University to be the scrupulous, even over-zealous,
champion of the rights of the individual. The University,
whatever its vulnerabilities, has many champions at work
defending its interests. The individual, on the other
hand, particularly if he espouses unpopular beliefs, is not
so amply blessed with supporters. He will inevitably have
tougher going and therefore needs a special degree of
championing. This is particularly important in the area
of speech; for speech that goes "up to the line" of what
is permissible is extraordinarily important speech both
to the university and to society, since it is through such
speech that new insights are often born. If there is the
slightest possibility that an individual, called to account
for speech that transposes ncrmisciblp hnunHTipc

more clearly respect such boundaries in the future, he
deserves to be given that chance. A severe penalty does
not deny him that opportunity, but dismissal does. In a
matter as crucial as this, I put great stress on the point
made in the Discussion of Sanctions that the balancing
of probabilities should be tipped in favor of the individ
ual; I believe it is the business of the University to be the
community where the balances are so tipped. If such a
stance makes the University fragile, it is equally true that
such a stance makes the University strong.
2. Although the Board's joint Discussion of Sanc
tions indicates that one's perception of reality could be a
mitigating factor, I place more weight on this than does
the majority. Even though Professor Franklin did not
choose to develop this point in a systematic way in his
defense, it is clear from the testimony that his indigna
tion at many injustices that he sees in the world inevita
bly leads him to vehement attack on those whom he
considers the purveyors of injustice. When we describe
his speech and manner as angry or strident, we must not
forget that from his perception of reality there is a great
deal to be angry and strident about. Indeed, we must
acknowledge that his perception of reality colors his
own definitions of what constitutes his "appropriate
functions within the University community," leading
him to seek for ways to acquaint his hearers with the
reality of police oppression in the ghettos, the commit
ting of war crimes in Southeast Asia, the immorality of
certain kinds of war-related research, and so on. While
we can properly demand, by a severe penalty, that his
sneecll and action not rirriirmrTibp thn riohtc r»f nftwc
I

we must recognize that the penalty of dismissal would
deny him a chance to apply his own perception of
reality within boundaries of permissible conduct that
may now be clearer to him.
3. There is a final point we may not ignore. This is a
recognition that many aspects of the University need to
be changed. Those of us within the University share
responsibility for many of the evils of our society, some
times by our neglect of means for bringing about change,
and sometimes by our tacit if not overt approval of the
involvement of the University and University personnel
in ongoing social structures of human oppression. Albeit
it in a harsh and strident manner, Professor Franklin has
helped to call attention to many of these realities. He
has not been alone, of course, in doing this, and others
may have joined the issues more effectively and creative
ly than he has done. But his has been an important
voice, however uncomfortable it makes the rest of us.
Dismissal would deprive us of that voice, whereas a
penalty short of dismissal would not do so unless Pro
fessor Franklin chose in the future to disregard its warn
ing.
I believe very strongly that, however, much I and
many of my colleagues may disagree with what Professor
Franklin says or how he says it, Stanford University will
be less a true university without him and more of a true
university with him. I fear that we may do untold harm
to ourselves and to the cause of higher education unless,
by imposing a penalty short of dismissal, we seek to
keep him as a very uncomfortable but very important
part of what this University, or any university, is meant
to bp
1. Findings on University Charges
The following numbered paragraphs of the "State
ment of Charges" of the University administration re
quire a finding by the Board: 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10. Of these
No. 6 does not involve Professor Franklin's conduct, but
is sustained unanimously by the Board.
The findings of fact by the seven-member Board on
those paragraphs involving Professor Franklin's conduct
are as follows:
7 The Lodge Incident
The Board unanimously does not sustain this
charge.
8 White Plaza Rally
The Board unanimously sustains this charge.
9 Computation Center Incident
The Board sustains this charge. Two members of
the Board (Brown, Kennedy) do not.
10 Old Union Courtyard Rally
The Board sustains this charge. Two members of
the Board (Brown, Kennedy) do not.
The violations sustained constitute, in the Board's
judgment, "substantial and manifest neglect of duty or
personal conduct substantially impairing the individual's
performance of his appropriate function within the Uni
versity community," and are therefore sanctionable
under the Statement of Policy on Appointment and
Tenure.
2. Sanctions
The Board has sustained Professor Franklin's culpa
bility on three charges, unanimously on one charge and
with two of the seven members dissenting on two
charges. The University administration argues that dis
missal is the appropriate penalty for each of the three
offenses.
We agree that each of the offenses is a serious one;
since we find Professor Franklin culpable on three
charges, we need not decide whether any one alone
would justify dismissal. Taken together, however, the
three offenses comprise, in our judgment, major viola
tions of the professional responsibilities and duties of a
professor in this University under the Statement of
Policy on Appointment and Tenure, the Policy on Cam
pus Disruptions, and the common traditions of this and
other universities. Giving the fullest weight to Professor
Franklin's personal rights to advocate vigorously his
political views, we are unable to escape the conclusion
that by his conduct he repeatedly and seriously infringed
the rights of others in the University, and significantly
increased the risk of injury to them and to University
property. He did so by urging and inciting to the use of
illegal coercion and violence, methods intolerable in a
university devoted to the free exchange and exploration
of ideas.
In the preceding Discussion of Sanctions, all the
members of the Board enumerated the factors which
affect the choice of proper sanctions, once findings of
facts are established. Accordingly, we considered possi
ble mitigating circumstances as well as those circum
stances which make Professor Franklin's behavior more
unacceptable. We conclude that these roughly offset
each other. On balance, they do not argue against what
would otherwise be the appropriate penalty for such
grave offenses. Nor do we doubt Professor Franklin's
own testimony that he would continue the type of
behavior charged here; indeed, he considered both his
own and his political associates' behavior to have been
"too weak" during some of the incidents covered by the
charges.
The real issue in these hearings is Professor Franklin's
behavior on the offenses charged, not his political views.
Diversity of political views is a great asset to the Univer
sity. The charges here, however, are incitement to use of
unlawful coercion and violence and increasing the danger
of injury to others as means to achieving Professor
Franklin's goals; it is that behavior, not his political
views and their expression, which we judge unaccepta
ble. Indeed, we note with approval that others holding
and expounding extreme political views are today highly
respected members of the Stanford faculty. Our decision
silences neither political dissent nor criticism of the
University. The only speech or behavior repressed by
this Board's findings is that which clearly urges and
incites others to unlawful coercion or violence, or to acts
likely to increase the risk of injury to other persons. We
believe such behavior should be restrained;insistence on
such standards of faculty conduct will not chill open and
robust dissent on this or any other campus.
The Board is also critical of Professor Franklin's de
liberate choice, demonstrated by action as well as by his
testimony, to attempt to protect his own position as
professor in the University while at the same time in
citing others, including students, to expose themselves to
expulsion or criminal charges.
Despite the severity of these offenses, we have
weighed carefully possible sanctions short of dismissal.
But a lesser penalty would fail to recognize the funda

mental nature and severity of Professor Franklin's at
tacks on the University of which he is a member. Toler
ance of such attacks on the freedom of others, under the
guise of protecting Professor Franklin's freedom to act
as he wishes, would be subversion, not support, of true
academic freedom and individual rights. It is precisely
because unlawful coercion and violence infringe upon
the rights of others in the University that the charges
against Professor Franklin are such serious ones.
We believe, given all these considerations, that im
mediate dismissal of Professor Franklin from the Univer
sity is warranted. In view of the difficulty of developing
alternative sources of income at this time, we recom
mend that a sum equal to Professor Franklin's salary
until August 31, 1972, be paid to him.
MINORITY DECISION:
PROFESSORS BROWN AND KENNEDY
In determining the appropriate penalty given our own
findings of fact, we have considered carefully the Univer
sity administration's argument that dismissal is the
appropriate sanction if we sustain any of the last three
charges.
The findings on the White Plaza speech on February
10th dictate, in our view, a serious penalty. Although we
differ slightly about the relation between the earlier part
of Professor Franklin's speech and its conclusion, we
agree that his call to shut down the Computation Center,
given its context and its position at the end of the rally,
was clear and unambiguous. Its force is blunted only by
the claim that it was, in a sense, an afterthought to the
rest of the speech; but even as an afterthought it pro
vided immediate impetus for a move to occupy a Univer
sity facility. Our view of the offense is not substantially
mitigated by Professor Franklin's attempt to convert the
context of his instructions into one appropriate for a call
to a "voluntary boycott" or "strike"—terms whose am
biguity is amply demonstrated in the testimony. Indeed,
the unimpressive analysis of syntax that characterized
Professor Franklin's defense on this charge left us wish
ing instead for an honest appeal to the urgency of
outraged conscience.
Although we find this violation a serious one, we
cannot agree that dismissal is the appropriate penalty for
it. The following elements contribute to that view:
First, suspension is itself a severe penalty. It works
substantial professional and financial hardships—sub
stantial enough to provide a significant deterrent to
Professor Franklin and others. It is therefore an ade
quate advertisement of the University's devotion to the
principles under attack by Professor Franklin.
Second, Professor Franklin has stated his intention to
be a non-participant in any action he supposes to be
punishable. If he has correctly represented his feeling
that in his case the line between permitted and pro
scribed conduct was vague to him, then surely the
Board's emphasis on its position with respect to incite
ment will be informative. We can tentatively accept the
proposition that for someone with a perception of reali
ty different from our own, that line might have seemed
blurred; but then we must also assume that the present
clarification, coupled with Professor Franklin's an
nounced determination to avoid dismissal, will be help
ful in preventing further violations.
Third, while it is true that Professor Franklin's pres
ent ideological position will encourage further coercive
acts against the University and that some of these will be
unlawful, we cannot assume his position to be static. It
can therefore not be argued conclusively that dismissal is
appropriate merely because other penalties would be
without effect.
Fourth, we would argue a careful weighing of the
costs of dismissal to the University relative to the risks
of future violations. These issues have been outlined in
the preceding section. We here discuss those that seem to
us especially important, in light of the fact that our own
findings of fact could justify a range of penalties, per

majority's belief that possible mitigating factors tend to
be cancelled out by Professor Franklin's ongoing pattern
of conduct, and my belief that there are certain miti
gating factors that should be given proportionately great
er weight. The four elements of the argument against
dismissal made in the minority decision can additionally
be offered as mitigating factors even in the face of a
more severe finding of fact, and I urge that they be
re-examined in that context before a final decision is
reached.
There are three points I wish to emphasize more
strongly than does the report as a whole, which I believe
militate against dismissal as an appropriate penalty:
I. While I acknowledge with the majority that the
University is more fragile than its attackers or defenders
often realize, I put greater stress on the need for the
University to be the scrupulous, even over-zealous,
champion of the rights of the individual. The University,
whatever its vulnerabilities, has many champions at work
defending its interests. The individual, on the other
hand, particularly if he espouses unpopular beliefs, is not
so amply blessed with supporters. He will inevitably have
tougher going and therefore needs a special degree of
championing. This is particularly important in the area
of speech; for speech that goes "up to the line" of what
is permissible is extraordinarily important speech both
to the university and to society, since it is through such
speech that new insights are often born. If there is the
slightest possibility that an individual, called to account
for speech that transposes ncrmisciblp hnunHTipc

more clearly respect such boundaries in the future, he
deserves to be given that chance. A severe penalty does
not deny him that opportunity, but dismissal does. In a
matter as crucial as this, I put great stress on the point
made in the Discussion of Sanctions that the balancing
of probabilities should be tipped in favor of the individ
ual; I believe it is the business of the University to be the
community where the balances are so tipped. If such a
stance makes the University fragile, it is equally true that
such a stance makes the University strong.
2. Although the Board's joint Discussion of Sanc
tions indicates that one's perception of reality could be a
mitigating factor, I place more weight on this than does
the majority. Even though Professor Franklin did not
choose to develop this point in a systematic way in his
defense, it is clear from the testimony that his indigna
tion at many injustices that he sees in the world inevita
bly leads him to vehement attack on those whom he
considers the purveyors of injustice. When we describe
his speech and manner as angry or strident, we must not
forget that from his perception of reality there is a great
deal to be angry and strident about. Indeed, we must
acknowledge that his perception of reality colors his
own definitions of what constitutes his "appropriate
functions within the University community," leading
him to seek for ways to acquaint his hearers with the
reality of police oppression in the ghettos, the commit
ting of war crimes in Southeast Asia, the immorality of
certain kinds of war-related research, and so on. While
we can properly demand, by a severe penalty, that his
sneecll and action not rirriirmrTibp thn riohtc r»f nftwc
I

we must recognize that the penalty of dismissal would
deny him a chance to apply his own perception of
reality within boundaries of permissible conduct that
may now be clearer to him.
3. There is a final point we may not ignore. This is a
recognition that many aspects of the University need to
be changed. Those of us within the University share
responsibility for many of the evils of our society, some
times by our neglect of means for bringing about change,
and sometimes by our tacit if not overt approval of the
involvement of the University and University personnel
in ongoing social structures of human oppression. Albeit
it in a harsh and strident manner, Professor Franklin has
helped to call attention to many of these realities. He
has not been alone, of course, in doing this, and others
may have joined the issues more effectively and creative
ly than he has done. But his has been an important
voice, however uncomfortable it makes the rest of us.
Dismissal would deprive us of that voice, whereas a
penalty short of dismissal would not do so unless Pro
fessor Franklin chose in the future to disregard its warn
ing.
I believe very strongly that, however, much I and
many of my colleagues may disagree with what Professor
Franklin says or how he says it, Stanford University will
be less a true university without him and more of a true
university with him. I fear that we may do untold harm
to ourselves and to the cause of higher education unless,
by imposing a penalty short of dismissal, we seek to
keep him as a very uncomfortable but very important
part of what this University, or any university, is meant
to bp
1. Findings on University Charges
The following numbered paragraphs of the "State
ment of Charges" of the University administration re
quire a finding by the Board: 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10. Of these
No. 6 does not involve Professor Franklin's conduct, but
is sustained unanimously by the Board.
The findings of fact by the seven-member Board on
those paragraphs involving Professor Franklin's conduct
are as follows:
7 The Lodge Incident
The Board unanimously does not sustain this
charge.
8 White Plaza Rally
The Board unanimously sustains this charge.
9 Computation Center Incident
The Board sustains this charge. Two members of
the Board (Brown, Kennedy) do not.
10 Old Union Courtyard Rally
The Board sustains this charge. Two members of
the Board (Brown, Kennedy) do not.
The violations sustained constitute, in the Board's
judgment, "substantial and manifest neglect of duty or
personal conduct substantially impairing the individual's
performance of his appropriate function within the Uni
versity community," and are therefore sanctionable
under the Statement of Policy on Appointment and
Tenure.
2. Sanctions
The Board has sustained Professor Franklin's culpa
bility on three charges, unanimously on one charge and
with two of the seven members dissenting on two
charges. The University administration argues that dis
missal is the appropriate penalty for each of the three
offenses.
We agree that each of the offenses is a serious one;
since we find Professor Franklin culpable on three
charges, we need not decide whether any one alone
would justify dismissal. Taken together, however, the
three offenses comprise, in our judgment, major viola
tions of the professional responsibilities and duties of a
professor in this University under the Statement of
Policy on Appointment and Tenure, the Policy on Cam
pus Disruptions, and the common traditions of this and
other universities. Giving the fullest weight to Professor
Franklin's personal rights to advocate vigorously his
political views, we are unable to escape the conclusion
that by his conduct he repeatedly and seriously infringed
the rights of others in the University, and significantly
increased the risk of injury to them and to University
property. He did so by urging and inciting to the use of
illegal coercion and violence, methods intolerable in a
university devoted to the free exchange and exploration
of ideas.
In the preceding Discussion of Sanctions, all the
members of the Board enumerated the factors which
affect the choice of proper sanctions, once findings of
facts are established. Accordingly, we considered possi
ble mitigating circumstances as well as those circum
stances which make Professor Franklin's behavior more
unacceptable. We conclude that these roughly offset
each other. On balance, they do not argue against what
would otherwise be the appropriate penalty for such
grave offenses. Nor do we doubt Professor Franklin's
own testimony that he would continue the type of
behavior charged here; indeed, he considered both his
own and his political associates' behavior to have been
"too weak" during some of the incidents covered by the
charges.
The real issue in these hearings is Professor Franklin's
behavior on the offenses charged, not his political views.
Diversity of political views is a great asset to the Univer
sity. The charges here, however, are incitement to use of
unlawful coercion and violence and increasing the danger
of injury to others as means to achieving Professor
Franklin's goals; it is that behavior, not his political
views and their expression, which we judge unaccepta
ble. Indeed, we note with approval that others holding
and expounding extreme political views are today highly
respected members of the Stanford faculty. Our decision
silences neither political dissent nor criticism of the
University. The only speech or behavior repressed by
this Board's findings is that which clearly urges and
incites others to unlawful coercion or violence, or to acts
likely to increase the risk of injury to other persons. We
believe such behavior should be restrained;insistence on
such standards of faculty conduct will not chill open and
robust dissent on this or any other campus.
The Board is also critical of Professor Franklin's de
liberate choice, demonstrated by action as well as by his
testimony, to attempt to protect his own position as
professor in the University while at the same time in
citing others, including students, to expose themselves to
expulsion or criminal charges.
Despite the severity of these offenses, we have
weighed carefully possible sanctions short of dismissal.
But a lesser penalty would fail to recognize the funda

mental nature and severity of Professor Franklin's at
tacks on the University of which he is a member. Toler
ance of such attacks on the freedom of others, under the
guise of protecting Professor Franklin's freedom to act
as he wishes, would be subversion, not support, of true
academic freedom and individual rights. It is precisely
because unlawful coercion and violence infringe upon
the rights of others in the University that the charges
against Professor Franklin are such serious ones.
We believe, given all these considerations, that im
mediate dismissal of Professor Franklin from the Univer
sity is warranted. In view of the difficulty of developing
alternative sources of income at this time, we recom
mend that a sum equal to Professor Franklin's salary
until August 31, 1972, be paid to him.
MINORITY DECISION:
PROFESSORS BROWN AND KENNEDY
In determining the appropriate penalty given our own
findings of fact, we have considered carefully the Univer
sity administration's argument that dismissal is the
appropriate sanction if we sustain any of the last three
charges.
The findings on the White Plaza speech on February
10th dictate, in our view, a serious penalty. Although we
differ slightly about the relation between the earlier part
of Professor Franklin's speech and its conclusion, we
agree that his call to shut down the Computation Center,
given its context and its position at the end of the rally,
was clear and unambiguous. Its force is blunted only by
the claim that it was, in a sense, an afterthought to the
rest of the speech; but even as an afterthought it pro
vided immediate impetus for a move to occupy a Univer
sity facility. Our view of the offense is not substantially
mitigated by Professor Franklin's attempt to convert the
context of his instructions into one appropriate for a call
to a "voluntary boycott" or "strike"—terms whose am
biguity is amply demonstrated in the testimony. Indeed,
the unimpressive analysis of syntax that characterized
Professor Franklin's defense on this charge left us wish
ing instead for an honest appeal to the urgency of
outraged conscience.
Although we find this violation a serious one, we
cannot agree that dismissal is the appropriate penalty for
it. The following elements contribute to that view:
First, suspension is itself a severe penalty. It works
substantial professional and financial hardships—sub
stantial enough to provide a significant deterrent to
Professor Franklin and others. It is therefore an ade
quate advertisement of the University's devotion to the
principles under attack by Professor Franklin.
Second, Professor Franklin has stated his intention to
be a non-participant in any action he supposes to be
punishable. If he has correctly represented his feeling
that in his case the line between permitted and pro
scribed conduct was vague to him, then surely the
Board's emphasis on its position with respect to incite
ment will be informative. We can tentatively accept the
proposition that for someone with a perception of reali
ty different from our own, that line might have seemed
blurred; but then we must also assume that the present
clarification, coupled with Professor Franklin's an
nounced determination to avoid dismissal, will be help
ful in preventing further violations.
Third, while it is true that Professor Franklin's pres
ent ideological position will encourage further coercive
acts against the University and that some of these will be
unlawful, we cannot assume his position to be static. It
can therefore not be argued conclusively that dismissal is
appropriate merely because other penalties would be
without effect.
Fourth, we would argue a careful weighing of the
costs of dismissal to the University relative to the risks
of future violations. These issues have been outlined in
the preceding section. We here discuss those that seem to
us especially important, in light of the fact that our own
findings of fact could justify a range of penalties, per
haps including dismissal, (a) The University thrives on
diversity and challenge. When we lose a prominent
symbol of these qualities, we lose not only the substance
of the challenge, but also the external perception that
we can take it in stride. In some quarters, the latter
effect could be damaging—for example, less well-buffer
ed institutions may become more vulnerable to outside
pressures to get rid of controversial faculty members, (b)
Because we live in a society in which there are increasing
public pressures to curb dissident speech and action, the
University has a special responsibility to insulate its
procedures from such influences. That need is magnified
by the special significance of tenure, which historically
protects the institution's faculty from social trends
toward political conformity. We should therefore be
scrupulous in protecting violators of University rules
against excessive penalties imposed by collective judg
ment, especially when those violators espouse uncom
fortably heterodox views, (c) Foi all these reasons, the
if i
University is obliged to tolerate a great deal of what it
does not like. We sec substantial costs in Professor
Franklin's loss to the institution; they arc measured
externally in the form of corrosive effects on academic
freedom, and internally in terms of lost challenge and
the subtle inhibition of dissent.
In light of these considerations, Professor Kennedy
recommends that Professor Franklin's suspension be
continued through the remainder of the current aca
demic year and that his suspension be without pay for
one of the remaining quarters; Professor Brown recom
mends that in view of the time Professor Franklin has
already been suspended, his suspension be continued
through the Winter Quarter only, suspension for that
quarter to be without pay.
ADDENDUM TO MINORITY DECISION:
PROFESSOR BROWN
Since I found against Professor Franklin on only one
of the four charges, it may seem gratuitous to discuss
possible penalty had I found him culpable on any of the
other charges as well. However, in view of the time and
resources the University has asked us to devote to this
and the gravity of the issues posed, I consider it
both appropriate and necessary as a member of the
Board to address myself to the question.
I strongly urge the University administration and the
Board of Trustees to consider once again, before taking
final action, whether a dismissal penalty does not repre
sent a higher cost than the University ought to pay. My

deal to be angry and strident about. Indeed, we must
acknowledge that his perception of reality colors his
own definitions of what constitutes his "appropriate
functions within the University community," leading
him to seek for ways to acquaint his hearers with the
reality of police oppression in the ghettos, the commit
ting of war crimes in Southeast Asia, the immorality of
certain kinds of war-related research, and so on. While
we can properly demand, by a severe penalty, that his
sneecll and action not rirriirmrTibp thn riohtc r»f nftwc

we must recognize that the penalty of dismissal would
deny him a chance to apply his own perception of
reality within boundaries of permissible conduct that
may now be clearer to him.
3. There is a final point we may not ignore. This is a
recognition that many aspects of the University need to
be changed. Those of us within the University share
responsibility for many of the evils of our society, some
times by our neglect of means for bringing about change,
and sometimes by our tacit if not overt approval of the
involvement of the University and University personnel
in ongoing social structures of human oppression. Albeit
it in a harsh and strident manner, Professor Franklin has
helped to call attention to many of these realities. He
has not been alone, of course, in doing this, and others
may have joined the issues more effectively and creative
ly than he has done. But his has been an important
voice, however uncomfortable it makes the rest of us.
Dismissal would deprive us of that voice, whereas a
penalty short of dismissal would not do so unless Pro
fessor Franklin chose in the future to disregard its warn
ing.
I believe very strongly that, however, much I and
many of my colleagues may disagree with what Professor
Franklin says or how he says it, Stanford University will
be less a true university without him and more of a true
university with him. I fear that we may do untold harm
to ourselves and to the cause of higher education unless,
by imposing a penalty short of dismissal, we seek to
keep him as a very uncomfortable but very important
part of what this University, or any university, is meant
to bp
1. Findings on University Charges
The following numbered paragraphs of the "State
ment of Charges" of the University administration re
quire a finding by the Board: 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10. Of these
No. 6 does not involve Professor Franklin's conduct, but
is sustained unanimously by the Board.
The findings of fact by the seven-member Board on
those paragraphs involving Professor Franklin's conduct
are as follows:
7 The Lodge Incident
The Board unanimously does not sustain this
charge.
8 White Plaza Rally
The Board unanimously sustains this charge.
9 Computation Center Incident
The Board sustains this charge. Two members of
the Board (Brown, Kennedy) do not.
10 Old Union Courtyard Rally
The Board sustains this charge. Two members of
the Board (Brown, Kennedy) do not.
The violations sustained constitute, in the Board's
judgment, "substantial and manifest neglect of duty or
personal conduct substantially impairing the individual's
performance of his appropriate function within the Uni
versity community," and are therefore sanctionable
under the Statement of Policy on Appointment and
Tenure.
2. Sanctions
The Board has sustained Professor Franklin's culpa
bility on three charges, unanimously on one charge and
with two of the seven members dissenting on two
charges. The University administration argues that dis
missal is the appropriate penalty for each of the three
offenses.
We agree that each of the offenses is a serious one;
since we find Professor Franklin culpable on three
charges, we need not decide whether any one alone
would justify dismissal. Taken together, however, the
three offenses comprise, in our judgment, major viola
tions of the professional responsibilities and duties of a
professor in this University under the Statement of
Policy on Appointment and Tenure, the Policy on Cam
pus Disruptions, and the common traditions of this and
other universities. Giving the fullest weight to Professor
Franklin's personal rights to advocate vigorously his
political views, we are unable to escape the conclusion
that by his conduct he repeatedly and seriously infringed
the rights of others in the University, and significantly
increased the risk of injury to them and to University
property. He did so by urging and inciting to the use of
illegal coercion and violence, methods intolerable in a
university devoted to the free exchange and exploration
of ideas.
In the preceding Discussion of Sanctions, all the
members of the Board enumerated the factors which
affect the choice of proper sanctions, once findings of
facts are established. Accordingly, we considered possi
ble mitigating circumstances as well as those circum
stances which make Professor Franklin's behavior more
unacceptable. We conclude that these roughly offset
each other. On balance, they do not argue against what
would otherwise be the appropriate penalty for such
grave offenses. Nor do we doubt Professor Franklin's
own testimony that he would continue the type of
behavior charged here; indeed, he considered both his
own and his political associates' behavior to have been
"too weak" during some of the incidents covered by the
charges.
The real issue in these hearings is Professor Franklin's
behavior on the offenses charged, not his political views.
Diversity of political views is a great asset to the Univer
sity. The charges here, however, are incitement to use of
unlawful coercion and violence and increasing the danger
of injury to others as means to achieving Professor
Franklin's goals; it is that behavior, not his political
views and their expression, which we judge unaccepta
ble. Indeed, we note with approval that others holding
and expounding extreme political views are today highly
respected members of the Stanford faculty. Our decision
silences neither political dissent nor criticism of the
University. The only speech or behavior repressed by
this Board's findings is that which clearly urges and
incites others to unlawful coercion or violence, or to acts
likely to increase the risk of injury to other persons. We
believe such behavior should be restrained;insistence on
such standards of faculty conduct will not chill open and
robust dissent on this or any other campus.
The Board is also critical of Professor Franklin's de
liberate choice, demonstrated by action as well as by his
testimony, to attempt to protect his own position as
professor in the University while at the same time in
citing others, including students, to expose themselves to
expulsion or criminal charges.
Despite the severity of these offenses, we have
weighed carefully possible sanctions short of dismissal.
But a lesser penalty would fail to recognize the funda

mental nature and severity of Professor Franklin's at
tacks on the University of which he is a member. Toler
ance of such attacks on the freedom of others, under the
guise of protecting Professor Franklin's freedom to act
as he wishes, would be subversion, not support, of true
academic freedom and individual rights. It is precisely
because unlawful coercion and violence infringe upon
the rights of others in the University that the charges
against Professor Franklin are such serious ones.
We believe, given all these considerations, that im
mediate dismissal of Professor Franklin from the Univer
sity is warranted. In view of the difficulty of developing
alternative sources of income at this time, we recom
mend that a sum equal to Professor Franklin's salary
until August 31, 1972, be paid to him.
MINORITY DECISION:
PROFESSORS BROWN AND KENNEDY
In determining the appropriate penalty given our own
findings of fact, we have considered carefully the Univer
sity administration's argument that dismissal is the
appropriate sanction if we sustain any of the last three
charges.
The findings on the White Plaza speech on February
10th dictate, in our view, a serious penalty. Although we
differ slightly about the relation between the earlier part
of Professor Franklin's speech and its conclusion, we
agree that his call to shut down the Computation Center,
given its context and its position at the end of the rally,
was clear and unambiguous. Its force is blunted only by
the claim that it was, in a sense, an afterthought to the
rest of the speech; but even as an afterthought it pro
vided immediate impetus for a move to occupy a Univer
sity facility. Our view of the offense is not substantially
mitigated by Professor Franklin's attempt to convert the
context of his instructions into one appropriate for a call
to a "voluntary boycott" or "strike"—terms whose am
biguity is amply demonstrated in the testimony. Indeed,
the unimpressive analysis of syntax that characterized
Professor Franklin's defense on this charge left us wish
ing instead for an honest appeal to the urgency of
outraged conscience.
Although we find this violation a serious one, we
cannot agree that dismissal is the appropriate penalty for
it. The following elements contribute to that view:
First, suspension is itself a severe penalty. It works
substantial professional and financial hardships—sub
stantial enough to provide a significant deterrent to
Professor Franklin and others. It is therefore an ade
quate advertisement of the University's devotion to the
principles under attack by Professor Franklin.
Second, Professor Franklin has stated his intention to
be a non-participant in any action he supposes to be
punishable. If he has correctly represented his feeling
that in his case the line between permitted and pro
scribed conduct was vague to him, then surely the
Board's emphasis on its position with respect to incite
ment will be informative. We can tentatively accept the
proposition that for someone with a perception of reali
ty different from our own, that line might have seemed
blurred; but then we must also assume that the present
clarification, coupled with Professor Franklin's an
nounced determination to avoid dismissal, will be help
ful in preventing further violations.
Third, while it is true that Professor Franklin's pres
ent ideological position will encourage further coercive
acts against the University and that some of these will be
unlawful, we cannot assume his position to be static. It
can therefore not be argued conclusively that dismissal is
appropriate merely because other penalties would be
without effect.
Fourth, we would argue a careful weighing of the
costs of dismissal to the University relative to the risks
of future violations. These issues have been outlined in
the preceding section. We here discuss those that seem to
us especially important, in light of the fact that our own
findings of fact could justify a range of penalties, per
haps including dismissal, (a) The University thrives on
diversity and challenge. When we lose a prominent
symbol of these qualities, we lose not only the substance
of the challenge, but also the external perception that
we can take it in stride. In some quarters, the latter
effect could be damaging—for example, less well-buffer
ed institutions may become more vulnerable to outside
pressures to get rid of controversial faculty members, (b)
Because we live in a society in which there are increasing
public pressures to curb dissident speech and action, the
University has a special responsibility to insulate its
procedures from such influences. That need is magnified
by the special significance of tenure, which historically
protects the institution's faculty from social trends
toward political conformity. We should therefore be
scrupulous in protecting violators of University rules
against excessive penalties imposed by collective judg
ment, especially when those violators espouse uncom
fortably heterodox views, (c) Foi all these reasons, the
if i
University is obliged to tolerate a great deal of what it
does not like. We sec substantial costs in Professor
Franklin's loss to the institution; they arc measured
externally in the form of corrosive effects on academic
freedom, and internally in terms of lost challenge and
the subtle inhibition of dissent.
In light of these considerations, Professor Kennedy
recommends that Professor Franklin's suspension be
continued through the remainder of the current aca
demic year and that his suspension be without pay for
one of the remaining quarters; Professor Brown recom
mends that in view of the time Professor Franklin has
already been suspended, his suspension be continued
through the Winter Quarter only, suspension for that
quarter to be without pay.
ADDENDUM TO MINORITY DECISION:
PROFESSOR BROWN
Since I found against Professor Franklin on only one
of the four charges, it may seem gratuitous to discuss
possible penalty had I found him culpable on any of the
other charges as well. However, in view of the time and
resources the University has asked us to devote to this
and the gravity of the issues posed, I consider it
both appropriate and necessary as a member of the
Board to address myself to the question.
I strongly urge the University administration and the
Board of Trustees to consider once again, before taking
final action, whether a dismissal penalty does not repre
sent a higher cost than the University ought to pay. My
dorvir*Mrc from ♦ Hr» rnninritv in nrMWion to a Hifforpnt
I

finding of fact, focusses on the difference between the
majority's belief that possible mitigating factors tend to
be cancelled out by Professor Franklin's ongoing pattern
of conduct, and my belief that there are certain miti
gating factors that should be given proportionately great
er weight. The four elements of the argument against
dismissal made in the minority decision can additionally
be offered as mitigating factors even in the face of a
more severe finding of fact, and I urge that they be
re-examined in that context before a final decision is
reached.
There are three points I wish to emphasize more
strongly than does the report as a whole, which I believe
militate against dismissal as an appropriate penalty:
I. While I acknowledge with the majority that the
University is more fragile than its attackers or defenders
often realize, I put greater stress on the need for the
University to be the scrupulous, even over-zealous,
champion of the rights of the individual. The University,
whatever its vulnerabilities, has many champions at work
defending its interests. The individual, on the other
hand, particularly if he espouses unpopular beliefs, is not
so amply blessed with supporters. He will inevitably have
tougher going and therefore needs a special degree of
championing. This is particularly important in the area
of speech; for speech that goes "up to the line" of what
is permissible is extraordinarily important speech both
to the university and to society, since it is through such
speech that new insights are often born. If there is the
slightest possibility that an individual, called to account
for speech that transposes ncrmisciblp hnunHTipc

more clearly respect such boundaries in the future, he
deserves to be given that chance. A severe penalty does
not deny him that opportunity, but dismissal does. In a
matter as crucial as this, I put great stress on the point
made in the Discussion of Sanctions that the balancing
of probabilities should be tipped in favor of the individ
ual; I believe it is the business of the University to be the
community where the balances are so tipped. If such a
stance makes the University fragile, it is equally true that
such a stance makes the University strong.
2. Although the Board's joint Discussion of Sanc
tions indicates that one's perception of reality could be a
mitigating factor, I place more weight on this than does
the majority. Even though Professor Franklin did not
choose to develop this point in a systematic way in his
defense, it is clear from the testimony that his indigna
tion at many injustices that he sees in the world inevita
bly leads him to vehement attack on those whom he
considers the purveyors of injustice. When we describe
his speech and manner as angry or strident, we must not
forget that from his perception of reality there is a great
deal to be angry and strident about. Indeed, we must
acknowledge that his perception of reality colors his
own definitions of what constitutes his "appropriate
functions within the University community," leading
him to seek for ways to acquaint his hearers with the
reality of police oppression in the ghettos, the commit
ting of war crimes in Southeast Asia, the immorality of
certain kinds of war-related research, and so on. While
we can properly demand, by a severe penalty, that his
sneecll and action not rirriirmrTibp thn riohtc r»f nftwc
I

we must recognize that the penalty of dismissal would
deny him a chance to apply his own perception of
reality within boundaries of permissible conduct that
may now be clearer to him.
3. There is a final point we may not ignore. This is a
recognition that many aspects of the University need to
