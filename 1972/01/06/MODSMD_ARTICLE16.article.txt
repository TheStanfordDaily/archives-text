# REPRINTED FROM THE STANFORD DAILY OF DECEMBER 4,1970
## A 						Look At The Coach 
### FRED LEESON former sports editor FRED LEESON 
With football fans and
Stanford players looking
anxiously to Pasadena Jan. 1
fur their first Rose Bowl in
1,9 years following John
Ralston's first league title in
His eight years here, it seems
appropriate to take

John Ralston likes ice cream.
He gets his hair cut short every
week.
When the football team he
coaches voted to 9ee an 'R'-rated
movie â€”Ralston's first he left in
the middle and sat on the bus.
His use of swear words is
limited to an infrequent "damn,"
like when he was "damn proud
of his players for going to the
Rose Bowl.
"He's a pretty straight guy,
says a student manager who has
worked for him three years.
One might expect a
major-coliege coach to be a pretty
straight guy. And one might
expect him to talk about
dedication, pride, winning and
individual achievement, just as
Ralston does.
That superficial view isn't
inaccurate, it's just incomplete. It
doesn't reflect Ralston the
competitor, the exponent of
emotional control, the honest
and, perhaps, the perfectionist.
"When I was 11, I knew
exactly what I wanted to do,"
Ralston says, looking back 32
years to his elementary-school
days in Norway, Mich. "I wanted
to be a football coach. I've never
changed my mind."
"He has figured what he's good
at and exploited the hell out of
it,"says a three-year varsity
player. "He has things all worked
out. He's super-organized."
Ralston starts his workday at

7:45 a.m. and goes home at 10
p.m. 9ome nights, 9 p.m., the
others. He sleeps six and-a-half
hours and does much of his
"creative" football thinking at
home. "You get geared into it and
it's automatic," he says of his
routine.
His hours are typical of his
approach to sport. "He has a very
competitive nature," says a
second player. "When he played
at Cal (linebacker) I guess he
wasn't supposed to be much, but
he always played."
Ralston's goal as a coach is to
be the best. He studies the
14 -or-so active coaches whose
records are better than his,
looking for tips. "I'm always
anxious to pick up anything that

would help us here." He is an avid
attender of clinics, seeking
conditioning ideas and new plays.
In his first head-coaching job at
Utah State (1959-62), his record
included 31 wins in 45 games, two
championships in the old Skyline
Conference and trips to the
Gotham and Sun bowls. At
Stanford he is 56-33-3, and in his
eighth year has won his first Pac-8
title and Rose Bowl appearance.
Ralston tempers his strong
achievement drive with an acute
sense of emotional control,
humility and a determined desire
not to make enemies.
"Humility in victory, that's the
greatest way to go," he told his
players right after their
long-awaited win over USC this
season. And though the Trojans
are the subjects of one of
Ralston's deep but
heavily-camouflaged animosities,
he just smiles and said, "That was
fun."
When he wins, he praises his
players and assistants. When he
loses, he usually says he was
"out-coached. If we lose, I figure
it is my fualt," he says."It means
we had a breakdown somewhere.
There's nothing worse than
knowing you didn't do the best
you could."
It isn't clear why Ralston is
always careful to be persistently
proper. "He has a lot of pride in
the coaching profession," says one
of his players. "I think he doesn't
want to say anything that would
degrade it."

"Once I was guilty of
humiliating an opponent, and I'll
never do that again," Ralston
says, which could be part of it. It
also explains his determination to
correct a quote mistakenly
attributed to him after Stanford's
63-16 win over Washington State
this year.
In that game a drunk fan
clambered from the stands and
tackled a Stanford runner who
was clear for a touchdown. The
player told reporters, "That was
the hardest hit of the game," and
a publicist's error made the quote
Ralston's.
Ralston called WSU coach Jim
Sweeney and had the Stanford
publicity office notify newspapers
of the mistake.
"You never say anything
tongue-in-cheek when you win by
50 points," he told a friend
afterward. "Jim (Sweeney) is an
old friend of mine and a family
man. He's dying a thousand
deaths up there right now (one
win, ten losses), and I've been
there myself. How could I think I
have any compassion and say
something like that?"
He seems to be similarly
sensitive with his players. "The
last couple years he has been
concerned more with each player
as an individual and his own
psychology," says one. "He
knows we're not only football
players but people at this
university. Ralston's able to let us
be more of a person than a lot of
coaches."

In the last few years, Ralston
has started personal discussions
with each player during spring
practice and has relaxed his earlier
standards for attire and hair.
"It used to be that uniformity
in appearance was the thing," he
says. "But to some of these guys
now, being in almost any kind of
uniform puts them in a state of
conflict. I'm not in favor of that
at all."
His training regulations, when
he knows players will be partying
after a game, are, "Take care of
yourselves tonight."
"He knows people have a beer
or two, but he means don't go
overboard," says a player. "You
don't want to break rules to get
back at the coach. He sets a
perfect example."

Another says, "He's like my
parents. They have an idea what's
going on, but they don't know for
sure. And maybe they don't want
to know. He doesn't go around
probing."
Recruiting high school players,
obviously, is a major factor in
building a competitive,
major-college team. Ralston, who
calls recruiting the "American
way," doesn't accept the view
that it is a manipulation of
teenagers and the
professionalization of amateur
sport.
"No, heavens no. That's no
different than trying to find
excellence in any other area.
Stanford doesn't take just any
kind of student. When we look for
football players, we'd like to find
the best, too."
In his 12 years as a head coach,
he has built a reputation as an
effective recruiter. "Ralston looks
you in the eye and tells you what
he thinks, how it's gonna be, what
will be in store," says one player
he contacted in high school.
"He doesn't promise you
things," says another. "He tells
you the girl situation isn't the best
and that the attitude toward jocks
isn't the greatest."
"You want to present
everything you possibly can,"
Ralston says from his office where
he opens letters, answers the
telephone, makes calendrical
jottings and eats strawberry ice
cream almost simultaneously.
Sounds pretty straight.
