# Ralston's Indians Prospered
## 
### CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
When John Ralston came to
Stanford in 1963, he inherited a
football program that had not had
a winning season since 1957 and
had suffered through the 1960
season without winning a single
contest. He now leaves one of the
most successful football
organizations in the country; one
that has produced two straight
Rose Bowl champions.
Embarking on a coaching
career immediately after
graduating from Berkeley, Ralston
accepted the assistant coaching
position at Concord's Mount
Diablo High School in 1951. He
soon moved into the head
coaching job at San Lorenzo High
School and abandoned that in
1956 to work as an assistant to
the Cal football staff. In 1959,
Ralston was appointed head coach
of the Utah State Aggies where he
led his squads to an overall record
of 31-11-1.
Although inheriting a losing
tradition at Utah State, Ralston
drove his team to a tie for the
conference championship in his
second season. The Aggies'
rushing game was the best in the
nation that year. Ralston's men
repeated as co-champions in the
Skyline Conference in 1961 and
led the nation in scoring defense
and rushing defense. Utah State
also played in the Sun Bowl and
the Gotham Bowl during
Ralston's tenure.
Accepting the challenge of
reviving Stanford's flagging
football fortunes, Ralston came to
the Farm with high hopes. In his
first press conference, Ralston
commented that, "Stanford
strives for the best in all fields of
endeavor. As it is in academics, it
should also be in athletics."
Raltston's first game as the
Indian coach was successful as the
Cards dumped San Jose State
29-13. Establishing a trend that
would continue throughout his
illustrious Stanford career,
Ralston played 45 men in the San
Jose State game as he sought to
create more depth on his squad.
Ralston's desire to give his second
line players experience added
strength to his teams and was
instrumental in the Rose Bowl
victory' last weekend. Throughout
the year, Ralston shuttled second
string linemen in and out of
games, and when he had to

depend on ihem in the Rose Bowl
to hold off the Wolverines, players
like Barry Reynolds, John
Ferguson, Joe Martin, and Pete
Hanson came through
magnificently while the Thunder
Chickens were resting.
The 1963 Indians went on to
defeat Notre Dame on national
television, and picked up their
only other win of the season with
Ralston beginning his dominance
over his alma mater as the Cards
rolled to a 28-17 victory in a Big
Game delayed due to President
Kennedy's assassination. Since
that first win over Cal, Ralston
has compiled a 7-2 record against
his old school, and ran off a string
of four consecutive Big Game
wins to set a new Stanford
coaching record.
After that first 3-7 record,
Indian teams have never suffered
another losing season under Coach
Ralston. Stanford's football teams
improved slowly under Ralston,
establishing records of 5-5, 6-3-1,
5-5, and 5-5 from 1964 through
1967. After winning their first
three contests in 1968, the
Indians were edged by USC,
27-24, and started on a skid that
culminated in an embarrassing loss
to Oregon State, 29-7. At this
point, many people were
clamoring for Ralston's scalp.
In typical John Ralston form,
the beleagered coach completely
blamed himself for the Oregon
State loss, saying that, "For the
first time in seven games, we were
fiat. I don't know why, but it's
my fault. I feel badly for it."
Ralston commonly took the
blame for his squad's losses,
setting this precedent after his
first defeat at Stanford to Oregon
in 1962, 36-7. "A real bad
afternoon, for which I must hold
my self personally responsible,"
claimed Ralston after the
humiliating defeat.
The Tribe came to the defense
of their coach after the OSU loss
in 1968, both on the field and off.
Winning the last three games of
the year to finish a respectable
6-3-1, the players defended their
coach after a 20-0 victory over Cal
in the season's finale. Sophomore
tight end Bob Moore affirmed
that, "Everybody had it in his
mind to win this one for Coach
Ralston. We think Ralston's the
greatest person around. I know
that's one of the reasons we were

so ready. We want him back—we
want him back bad."
The Indians' late season surge
put them third in the Pac-8 and
was responsible for fulfilling their
wish to have Coach Ralston back.
Athletic Director Chuck Taylor
rehired Ralston and gave him a
vote of confidence. Ever since
those troubled days in the middle
of the 1968 season, Ralston's
fortunes at Stanford have been
little short of spectacular.
Under Ralston's leadership and
behind the arm of Jim Plunkett,
the Indians set out for the Pac-8
title in 1969 and missed by a two
point loss to USC, 26-24, a trip to
Pasadena. The Tribe finished the
year 7-2-1, their best record under
Coach Ralston. Confident that the
Cards would make it to Pasadena
in 1970, Plunkett turned down
the pros to stay and lead the team
on to a season of 8-3 and a
decisive victory' over Ohio State in
the Rose Bowl.
The loss of Plunkett was
supposed to crush any future

Stanford hopes, but one of
Ralston's experienced reserves,
Don Bunce, came on to repeat his
predecessor's accomplishments
and win a second consecutive
Rose Bowl. Ralston had schooled
a team that had returned to the
Rose Bowl when it had not been
given much chance by the critics
to finish any higher then third in
the Pac-8.
Aside from Ralston's excellent
55-36-3 record as a Stanford
coach, he h.as developed a number
of talented players who have
flourished in the professional
ranks. Jim Plunkett and Randy
Vataha of New England, Gene
Washington of the 49'ers, Blaine
Nye of the Cowboys, George
Buehler and Bob Moore of the
Raiders, and Don Parish of the
Cardinals are some of Ralston's
most successful Stanford players.
John Ralston has returned
Stanford to the ranks of national
prominance. It is a compliment to
the man that he will be very
difficult to replace.

PATIENCE PAYS OFF—John Ralston is shown above walking off the
Coliseum field in Los Angeles after USC's Ron Ayala kicked a field
goal with no time left on the clock to edge the Indians 26-24 and
dampen Ralston's Rose Bowl hopes for another year. Below, Ralston

1971 Rose Bowl in a fulfillment of one of his long held dreams.
