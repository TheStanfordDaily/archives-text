The excitement of the past four days over Stanford's incredible
Rose Bowl victory has suddenly been confused by the announcement
that John Ralston, Indian head coach for the past nine years, will
leave the Farm to accept a head coaching position with the Denver
Broncos.
Ralston has accomplished more with Stanford teams than any
other man in modern times. Working at a school with a relatively low
emphasis on athletics, Ralston was forced to compete with schools
offering twice as many scholarships. He also found himself coaching
intelligent athletes with many legitimate interests off the football
field.
Responding to this difficult situation, Ralston surrounded himself
with a fine coaching staff and recruited young men who could meet
the rigors of the classroom as well as the football program. Inspiring a
winning effort from free thinking, talented individuals, Ralston,
unlike most college coaches, treated his players like men instead of
bodies.
Ralston proved to the nation the benefits of his radical coaching
philosophy as his teams defeated the unthinking machines from the
Big Ten in two consecutive Rose Bowls.
Ralston is at the height of his college career and it is fitting that he
accept the greatest challenge and honor that can be offered to a
football coach, and join the ranks of the professionals. Stanford
football will be hurt by the loss of Ralston, but he is undeniably ready
for the next step in his career and we wish him all possible success in
his new venture.
1 his institution is deeply indebted to John Ralston, for lie has
developed a winning football program of national prominence at
Stanford University without compromising its standards.
