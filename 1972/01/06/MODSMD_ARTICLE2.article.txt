# Will Coach Denver Broncos
## Ralston Resigns, Takes Pro Post 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Four short days after leading
Stanford to a thrilling second
consecutive Rose Bowl championship,
Head Coach John Ralston yesterday
was named as the new head coach of
the National Football League's Denver
Broncos. Ralston was given a five year
contract which reportedly calls for an
annual salary in the $35,000-$50,000
range.
The 44-year-old Ralston has also

been offered the general manager's job
with Denver, and he says he will make
a decision regarding that position
during the next few weeks. "I want to
learn more about the duties of the
job." Regardless of whether he accepts
that job or not, Ralston indicated that
he will have a "free hand" in such
areas as staffing, player deals . ..
The 1970 Sporting News Collegiate
Coach-Of-The-Year replaces Lou
Saban, who resigned as the head
coach-general manager at Denver

following the 1971 season to accept a
similar position with the Buffalo Bills.
Saban resigned as head coach on
November 17 but stayed on as general
manager until December 22. Last
season 'under Saban, the Broncos
finished last in the Western Division of
the American Football Conference
with a 4-9-1 record.
Three Candidates
The outgoing Stanford coach said
yesterday that three of the assistant
coaches who worked under him, Jack
Christiansen, Bob Gambold and Mike
White, are prime candidates for the
top coaching spot he vacated.
"Anyone of those three could
ascend to the head coaching job. But
I'd be glad to take all three at Denver.
I will hold open a couple of spots at
Denver and wait until the head
coaching situation is cleared up. I am
very high on some of my Stanford
assistants and I would like to keep
them in my organization."
Speculation from a number of
sources is that White is the most likely
candidate of the three. The
36-year-old offensive coordinator was
the co-author with Ralston of
"Coaching Today's Athlete," a massive
football textbook published two
months ago.
Like Ralston, White is a California
alumnus who was an assistant coach at
California from 1959 until he joined
the Stanford staff in 1964. Over the
past few seasons, he has been
responsible for determining the
majority of Stanford's offensive game
plans.

Christiansen, 43, has been an
assistant at Stanford since 1968.
Before joining Ralston's staff, he was
head coach of the San Francisco 49ers
for five years. At Stanford, he has
coached the linebackers, offensive
backfield and most recently, the
defensive backfield.
Ironically Christiansen told the
Daily last night that he had been
contacted on December 21 in Long
Beach by Saban who asked him about
his future coaching plans. But
Christiansen said that after Saban
resigned his general manager's post the
following day, he didn't hear any
further from the Bronco management.

stay on at Stanford as an assistant if he
doesn't get the head coaching job,

NEW BRONCâ€”After two Rose Bowl wins, Stanford football coach John Ralston
has agreed to try to shape up the Denver Broncos a bit. A search is underway for
a new coach for the Indians.
Christiansen said his plans were "flexible." He
cited his long residence in this area and said
that not getting the head coaching job
wouldn't necessarily mean he would
automatically join Ralston in Denver.
Defensive coordinator Gambold, 42, is the
only remaining assistant coach from Ralston's
original staff in 1963. Prior to coming here,
Gambold had coached at Oregon State under
the current Los Angeles Ram's head coach,
Tommy Prothro.
Sabbatical Postponed
Stanford Athletic Director Chuck Taylor,
who was to have begun a nine month sabbatical
this week, was back working in his office
yesterday afternoon, mainly because acting
Athletic Director Bob Young was attending
meetings of the National Collegiate Athletic
Association in Florida.
Taylor himself will leave for the NCAA
convention on Friday, but said, "before
leaving, I'll try to get as many procedural
questions resolved as possible. The faster a
decision can be reached, the better it will be
for everybody. We will move quickly to name
John's successor, so that no gaps will be left in
the winning spirit and momentum that he has
created in our football program."
Following the NCAA meetings, Taylor said
that he will be leaving on a 10-day cruise and
Young will assume his responsibilities in the
negotiations. He expressed hope that a
decision will be reached before he returns
from his cruise and the general opinion among
athletic department personnel was that a
decision should come within a week to 10
days.
Lyman Comments
President Richard Lyman will be involved
in the decision on a new coach. Yesterday, he
stated, "John Ralston has done a magnificent
job here and we're going to miss him. He has
understood the importance of treating
student-athletes as mature and thoughtful
people.
"We intend to maintain that tradition at
Stanford and I know that thousands of
Stanford people would wish to join me in

wishing John and Patty every good fortune as
they take up an exciting new life in Denver."
Gambold was quick to echo the hope for a
rapid decision. "Unfortunately it's not totally
a one man decision. So it may be lengthy, as it
was when John was hired. It took them a
month and a half to decide on him in 1963.
We don't want to lose the recruiting
momentum provided by the Rose Bowl."
Christiansen said that he *also hopes for a
quick decision but citing the fact that he,
Gambold, and White would be attending the
NCAA convention this weekend and the
American Football Coaches Association
meetings next week, he said that quick action
might be difficult.

"Leaving Stanford was
a difficult decision. I
do it with a lot of
regret

All that is really clear now is that Ralston
won't be the head coach here next fall.
Speaking yesterday morning, he expressed
mixed reactions on the move to Denver.
"I think that coaching at Denver will be a
tremendous thing. I can't wait to get up there,
roll my sleeves up and get my feet wet in
professional football. I'm going to get a team
into the Super Bowl. I don't know when, but
I will and then maybe I'll be ready to quit."
As an afterthought he added, "It's amazing
how quickly Miami has been able to build a
winner."
No Finer Institution
Reflecting on his nine year stay here he
said, "Leaving Stanford was a difficult
decision. I do it with a lot of regret. I would
never have taken another college coaching
job. I have had the greatest employers in the
world. There is no finer institution anywhere
than Stanford University. And this is the
greatest place in the world to live."

Looking ahead to his new assignment he
said "Every time you make the move from
one coaching level to another, you have to
make a lot of adjustments."
Commenting on the recent moves of three
coaches from the college to the professional
ranks (Los Angeles' Tommy Prothro, Green
Bay's Dan Devine and Houston's Bill
Peterson) Ralston said that he didn't think
this trend would "change pro football." But
he did say, "The idea of the in-bred sort of
philosophy of pro football is changing."
Looking specifically at next year's Bronco
squad he said, "I would prefer to set a real
strong foundation through the draft." But he
did say that Denver has already traded away
their 2nd, 3rd, 7th and Bth round draft
choices for next season. According to Ralston,
in the first round, a coin toss will determine
whether the Broncos will get the fourth, fifth
or sixth pick in the upcoming draft.
Dozen Prospects
Answering a question about his Rose Bowl
champions who beat Michigan 13-12, he said,
"There are a dozen or so players off this team
who are pro prospects. I can very definitely
see Don Bunce as a pro style quarterback."
The new Bronco coach will spend
Thursday and Friday in Denver before going
to Mobile, Alabama on Saturday for the
Senior Bowl and to Tampa, Florida on
Sunday for the American Bowl. Next week he
will be at the American Football Coaches
Association convention in Miami. With his
contract here not expiring until January 31,
he will spend at least a few days here cleaning
up after that while concentration mainly the
rest of the month on the upcoming pro draft.
Ralston's wife Patty had a few final
comments to make about the move. "I'm
extremely happy for John. The timing is
excellent. It's hard to top those two wins at
the Rose Bowl. But coaching in the
professional ranks is something he has always
been aspiring for. I don't believe he was
particularly expecting the Denver job. But he
was expecting, or hoping for something."

"We intend to maintain that tradition at
Stanford and I know that thousands of
Stanford people would wish to join me in

wishing John and Patty every good fortune as
they take up an exciting new life in Denver."
Gambold was quick to echo the hope for a
rapid decision. "Unfortunately it's not totally
a one man decision. So it may be lengthy, as it
was when John was hired. It took them a
month and a half to decide on him in 1963.
We don't want to lose the recruiting
momentum provided by the Rose Bowl."
Christiansen said that he *also hopes for a
quick decision but citing the fact that he,
Gambold, and White would be attending the
NCAA convention this weekend and the
American Football Coaches Association
meetings next week, he said that quick action
might be difficult.

"Leaving Stanford was
a difficult decision. I
do it with a lot of
regret

All that is really clear now is that Ralston
won't be the head coach here next fall.
Speaking yesterday morning, he expressed
mixed reactions on the move to Denver.
"I think that coaching at Denver will be a
tremendous thing. I can't wait to get up there,
roll my sleeves up and get my feet wet in
professional football. I'm going to get a team
into the Super Bowl. I don't know when, but
I will and then maybe I'll be ready to quit."
As an afterthought he added, "It's amazing
how quickly Miami has been able to build a
winner."
No Finer Institution
Reflecting on his nine year stay here he
said, "Leaving Stanford was a difficult
decision. I do it with a lot of regret. I would
never have taken another college coaching
job. I have had the greatest employers in the
world. There is no finer institution anywhere
than Stanford University. And this is the
greatest place in the world to live."

Looking ahead to his new assignment he
said "Every time you make the move from
one coaching level to another, you have to
make a lot of adjustments."
Commenting on the recent moves of three
coaches from the college to the professional
ranks (Los Angeles' Tommy Prothro, Green
Bay's Dan Devine and Houston's Bill
Peterson) Ralston said that he didn't think
this trend would "change pro football." But
he did say, "The idea of the in-bred sort of
philosophy of pro football is changing."
Looking specifically at next year's Bronco
squad he said, "I would prefer to set a real
strong foundation through the draft." But he
did say that Denver has already traded away
their 2nd, 3rd, 7th and Bth round draft
choices for next season. According to Ralston,
in the first round, a coin toss will determine
whether the Broncos will get the fourth, fifth
or sixth pick in the upcoming draft.
Dozen Prospects
Answering a question about his Rose Bowl
champions who beat Michigan 13-12, he said,
"There are a dozen or so players off this team
who are pro prospects. I can very definitely
see Don Bunce as a pro style quarterback."
The new Bronco coach will spend
Thursday and Friday in Denver before going
to Mobile, Alabama on Saturday for the
Senior Bowl and to Tampa, Florida on
Sunday for the American Bowl. Next week he
will be at the American Football Coaches
Association convention in Miami. With his
contract here not expiring until January 31,
he will spend at least a few days here cleaning
up after that while concentration mainly the
rest of the month on the upcoming pro draft.
Ralston's wife Patty had a few final
comments to make about the move. "I'm
extremely happy for John. The timing is
excellent. It's hard to top those two wins at
the Rose Bowl. But coaching in the
professional ranks is something he has always
been aspiring for. I don't believe he was
particularly expecting the Denver job. But he
was expecting, or hoping for something."
Four short days after leading
Stanford to a thrilling second
consecutive Rose Bowl championship,
Head Coach John Ralston yesterday
was named as the new head coach of
the National Football League's Denver
Broncos. Ralston was given a five year
contract which reportedly calls for an
annual salary in the $35,000-$50,000
range.
The 44-year-old Ralston has also

been offered the general manager's job
with Denver, and he says he will make
a decision regarding that position
during the next few weeks. "I want to
learn more about the duties of the
job." Regardless of whether he accepts
that job or not, Ralston indicated that
he will have a "free hand" in such
areas as staffing, player deals . ..

Coach-Of-The-Year replaces Lou
Saban, who resigned as the head
coach-general manager at Denver

following the 1971 season to accept a
similar position with the Buffalo Bills.
Saban resigned as head coach on
November 17 but stayed on as general
manager until December 22. Last
season 'under Saban, the Broncos
finished last in the Western Division of
the American Football Conference
with a 4-9-1 record.
Three Candidates
The outgoing Stanford coach said
yesterday that three of the assistant
coaches who worked under him, Jack
Christiansen, Bob Gambold and Mike
White, are prime candidates for the
top coaching spot he vacated.
"Anyone of those three could
ascend to the head coaching job. But
I'd be glad to take all three at Denver.
I will hold open a couple of spots at
Denver and wait until the head
coaching situation is cleared up. I am
very high on some of my Stanford
assistants and I would like to keep
them in my organization."
Speculation from a number of
sources is that White is the most likely
candidate of the three. The
36-year-old offensive coordinator was
the co-author with Ralston of
"Coaching Today's Athlete," a massive
football textbook published two
months ago.
Like Ralston, White is a California
alumnus who was an assistant coach at
California from 1959 until he joined
the Stanford staff in 1964. Over the
past few seasons, he has been
responsible for determining the
majority of Stanford's offensive game
plans.

Christiansen, 43, has been an
assistant at Stanford since 1968.
Before joining Ralston's staff, he was
head coach of the San Francisco 49ers
for five years. At Stanford, he has
coached the linebackers, offensive
backfield and most recently, the
defensive backfield.
Ironically Christiansen told the
Daily last night that he had been
contacted on December 21 in Long
Beach by Saban who asked him about
his future coaching plans. But
Christiansen said that after Saban
resigned his general manager's post the
following day, he didn't hear any
further from the Bronco management.

stay on at Stanford as an assistant if he
doesn't get the head coaching job,

NEW BRONCâ€”After two Rose Bowl wins, Stanford football coach John Ralston
has agreed to try to shape up the Denver Broncos a bit. A search is underway for
a new coach for the Indians.
Christiansen said his plans were "flexible." He
cited his long residence in this area and said
that not getting the head coaching job
wouldn't necessarily mean he would
automatically join Ralston in Denver.
Defensive coordinator Gambold, 42, is the
only remaining assistant coach from Ralston's
original staff in 1963. Prior to coming here,
Gambold had coached at Oregon State under
the current Los Angeles Ram's head coach,
Tommy Prothro.
Sabbatical Postponed
Stanford Athletic Director Chuck Taylor,
who was to have begun a nine month sabbatical
this week, was back working in his office
yesterday afternoon, mainly because acting
Athletic Director Bob Young was attending
meetings of the National Collegiate Athletic
Association in Florida.
Taylor himself will leave for the NCAA
convention on Friday, but said, "before
leaving, I'll try to get as many procedural
questions resolved as possible. The faster a
decision can be reached, the better it will be
for everybody. We will move quickly to name
John's successor, so that no gaps will be left in
the winning spirit and momentum that he has
created in our football program."
Following the NCAA meetings, Taylor said
that he will be leaving on a 10-day cruise and
Young will assume his responsibilities in the
negotiations. He expressed hope that a
decision will be reached before he returns
from his cruise and the general opinion among
athletic department personnel was that a
decision should come within a week to 10
days.

President Richard Lyman will be involved

with a 4-9-1 record.
Three Candidates
The outgoing Stanford coach said
yesterday that three of the assistant
coaches who worked under him, Jack
Christiansen, Bob Gambold and Mike
White, are prime candidates for the
top coaching spot he vacated.
"Anyone of those three could
ascend to the head coaching job. But
I'd be glad to take all three at Denver.
I will hold open a couple of spots at
Denver and wait until the head
coaching situation is cleared up. I am
very high on some of my Stanford
assistants and I would like to keep
them in my organization."
Speculation from a number of
sources is that White is the most likely
candidate of the three. The
36-year-old offensive coordinator was
the co-author with Ralston of
"Coaching Today's Athlete," a massive
football textbook published two
months ago.
Like Ralston, White is a California
alumnus who was an assistant coach at
California from 1959 until he joined
the Stanford staff in 1964. Over the
past few seasons, he has been
responsible for determining the
majority of Stanford's offensive game
plans.

Christiansen, 43, has been an
assistant at Stanford since 1968.
Before joining Ralston's staff, he was
head coach of the San Francisco 49ers
for five years. At Stanford, he has
coached the linebackers, offensive
backfield and most recently, the
defensive backfield.
Ironically Christiansen told the
Daily last night that he had been
contacted on December 21 in Long
Beach by Saban who asked him about
his future coaching plans. But
Christiansen said that after Saban
resigned his general manager's post the
following day, he didn't hear any
further from the Bronco management.

NEW BRONCâ€”After two Rose Bowl wins, Stanford football coach John Ralston
has agreed to try to shape up the Denver Broncos a bit. A search is underway for
a new coach for the Indians.
Christiansen said his plans were "flexible." He
cited his long residence in this area and said
that not getting the head coaching job
wouldn't necessarily mean he would
automatically join Ralston in Denver.
Defensive coordinator Gambold, 42, is the
only remaining assistant coach from Ralston's
original staff in 1963. Prior to coming here,
Gambold had coached at Oregon State under
the current Los Angeles Ram's head coach,
Tommy Prothro.
Sabbatical Postponed
Stanford Athletic Director Chuck Taylor,
who was to have begun a nine month sabbatical
this week, was back working in his office
yesterday afternoon, mainly because acting
Athletic Director Bob Young was attending
meetings of the National Collegiate Athletic
Association in Florida.
Taylor himself will leave for the NCAA
convention on Friday, but said, "before
leaving, I'll try to get as many procedural
questions resolved as possible. The faster a
decision can be reached, the better it will be
for everybody. We will move quickly to name
John's successor, so that no gaps will be left in
the winning spirit and momentum that he has
created in our football program."
Following the NCAA meetings, Taylor said
that he will be leaving on a 10-day cruise and
Young will assume his responsibilities in the
negotiations. He expressed hope that a
decision will be reached before he returns
from his cruise and the general opinion among
athletic department personnel was that a
decision should come within a week to 10
days.
Lyman Comments
President Richard Lyman will be involved
in the decision on a new coach. Yesterday, he
stated, "John Ralston has done a magnificent
job here and we're going to miss him. He has
understood the importance of treating
student-athletes as mature and thoughtful
people.
"We intend to maintain that tradition at
Stanford and I know that thousands of
Stanford people would wish to join me in

wishing John and Patty every good fortune as
they take up an exciting new life in Denver."
Gambold was quick to echo the hope for a
rapid decision. "Unfortunately it's not totally
a one man decision. So it may be lengthy, as it
was when John was hired. It took them a
month and a half to decide on him in 1963.
We don't want to lose the recruiting
momentum provided by the Rose Bowl."
Christiansen said that he *also hopes for a
quick decision but citing the fact that he,
Gambold, and White would be attending the
NCAA convention this weekend and the
American Football Coaches Association
meetings next week, he said that quick action
might be difficult.

"Leaving Stanford was
a difficult decision. I
do it with a lot of
regret

All that is really clear now is that Ralston
won't be the head coach here next fall.
Speaking yesterday morning, he expressed
mixed reactions on the move to Denver.
"I think that coaching at Denver will be a
tremendous thing. I can't wait to get up there,
roll my sleeves up and get my feet wet in
professional football. I'm going to get a team
into the Super Bowl. I don't know when, but
I will and then maybe I'll be ready to quit."
As an afterthought he added, "It's amazing
how quickly Miami has been able to build a
winner."
No Finer Institution
Reflecting on his nine year stay here he
said, "Leaving Stanford was a difficult
decision. I do it with a lot of regret. I would
never have taken another college coaching
job. I have had the greatest employers in the
world. There is no finer institution anywhere
than Stanford University. And this is the
greatest place in the world to live."

Looking ahead to his new assignment he
said "Every time you make the move from
one coaching level to another, you have to
make a lot of adjustments."
Commenting on the recent moves of three
coaches from the college to the professional
ranks (Los Angeles' Tommy Prothro, Green
Bay's Dan Devine and Houston's Bill
Peterson) Ralston said that he didn't think
this trend would "change pro football." But
he did say, "The idea of the in-bred sort of
philosophy of pro football is changing."
Looking specifically at next year's Bronco
squad he said, "I would prefer to set a real
strong foundation through the draft." But he
did say that Denver has already traded away
their 2nd, 3rd, 7th and Bth round draft
choices for next season. According to Ralston,
in the first round, a coin toss will determine
whether the Broncos will get the fourth, fifth
or sixth pick in the upcoming draft.
Dozen Prospects
Answering a question about his Rose Bowl
champions who beat Michigan 13-12, he said,
"There are a dozen or so players off this team
who are pro prospects. I can very definitely
see Don Bunce as a pro style quarterback."
The new Bronco coach will spend
Thursday and Friday in Denver before going
to Mobile, Alabama on Saturday for the
Senior Bowl and to Tampa, Florida on
Sunday for the American Bowl. Next week he
will be at the American Football Coaches
Association convention in Miami. With his
contract here not expiring until January 31,
he will spend at least a few days here cleaning
up after that while concentration mainly the
rest of the month on the upcoming pro draft.
Ralston's wife Patty had a few final
comments to make about the move. "I'm
extremely happy for John. The timing is
excellent. It's hard to top those two wins at
the Rose Bowl. But coaching in the
professional ranks is something he has always
been aspiring for. I don't believe he was
particularly expecting the Denver job. But he
was expecting, or hoping for something."
Four short days after leading
Stanford to a thrilling second
consecutive Rose Bowl championship,
Head Coach John Ralston yesterday
was named as the new head coach of
the National Football League's Denver
Broncos. Ralston was given a five year
contract which reportedly calls for an
annual salary in the $35,000-$50,000
range.
The 44-year-old Ralston has also

been offered the general manager's job
with Denver, and he says he will make
a decision regarding that position
during the next few weeks. "I want to
learn more about the duties of the
job." Regardless of whether he accepts
that job or not, Ralston indicated that
he will have a "free hand" in such
areas as staffing, player deals . ..
The 1970 Sporting News Collegiate
Coach-Of-The-Year replaces Lou
Saban, who resigned as the head
coach-general manager at Denver

following the 1971 season to accept a
similar position with the Buffalo Bills.
Saban resigned as head coach on
November 17 but stayed on as general
manager until December 22. Last

into the Super Bowl. I don't know when, but
I will and then maybe I'll be ready to quit."
As an afterthought he added, "It's amazing
how quickly Miami has been able to build a
winner."
No Finer Institution
Reflecting on his nine year stay here he
said, "Leaving Stanford was a difficult
decision. I do it with a lot of regret. I would
never have taken another college coaching
job. I have had the greatest employers in the
world. There is no finer institution anywhere
than Stanford University. And this is the
greatest place in the world to live."

Looking ahead to his new assignment he
said "Every time you make the move from
one coaching level to another, you have to
make a lot of adjustments."
Commenting on the recent moves of three
coaches from the college to the professional
ranks (Los Angeles' Tommy Prothro, Green
Bay's Dan Devine and Houston's Bill
Peterson) Ralston said that he didn't think
this trend would "change pro football." But
he did say, "The idea of the in-bred sort of
philosophy of pro football is changing."
Looking specifically at next year's Bronco
squad he said, "I would prefer to set a real
strong foundation through the draft." But he
did say that Denver has already traded away
their 2nd, 3rd, 7th and Bth round draft
choices for next season. According to Ralston,
in the first round, a coin toss will determine
whether the Broncos will get the fourth, fifth
or sixth pick in the upcoming draft.
Dozen Prospects
Answering a question about his Rose Bowl
champions who beat Michigan 13-12, he said,
"There are a dozen or so players off this team
who are pro prospects. I can very definitely
see Don Bunce as a pro style quarterback."
The new Bronco coach will spend
Thursday and Friday in Denver before going
to Mobile, Alabama on Saturday for the
Senior Bowl and to Tampa, Florida on
Sunday for the American Bowl. Next week he
will be at the American Football Coaches
Association convention in Miami. With his
contract here not expiring until January 31,
he will spend at least a few days here cleaning
up after that while concentration mainly the
rest of the month on the upcoming pro draft.
Ralston's wife Patty had a few final
comments to make about the move. "I'm
extremely happy for John. The timing is
excellent. It's hard to top those two wins at
the Rose Bowl. But coaching in the
professional ranks is something he has always
been aspiring for. I don't believe he was
particularly expecting the Denver job. But he
was expecting, or hoping for something."
Four short days after leading
Stanford to a thrilling second
consecutive Rose Bowl championship,
Head Coach John Ralston yesterday
was named as the new head coach of
the National Football League's Denver
Broncos. Ralston was given a five year
contract which reportedly calls for an
annual salary in the $35,000-$50,000
range.
The 44-year-old Ralston has also

been offered the general manager's job
with Denver, and he says he will make
a decision regarding that position
during the next few weeks. "I want to
learn more about the duties of the
job." Regardless of whether he accepts
that job or not, Ralston indicated that
he will have a "free hand" in such
areas as staffing, player deals . ..
The 1970 Sporting News Collegiate
Coach-Of-The-Year replaces Lou
Saban, who resigned as the head
coach-general manager at Denver

following the 1971 season to accept a
similar position with the Buffalo Bills.
Saban resigned as head coach on
November 17 but stayed on as general
manager until December 22. Last
season 'under Saban, the Broncos
finished last in the Western Division of
the American Football Conference
with a 4-9-1 record.
Three Candidates
The outgoing Stanford coach said
yesterday that three of the assistant
coaches who worked under him, Jack
Christiansen, Bob Gambold and Mike
White, are prime candidates for the
top coaching spot he vacated.
"Anyone of those three could
ascend to the head coaching job. But
I'd be glad to take all three at Denver.
I will hold open a couple of spots at
Denver and wait until the head
coaching situation is cleared up. I am
very high on some of my Stanford
assistants and I would like to keep
them in my organization."
Speculation from a number of
sources is that White is the most likely
candidate of the three. The
36-year-old offensive coordinator was
the co-author with Ralston of
"Coaching Today's Athlete," a massive
football textbook published two
months ago.
Like Ralston, White is a California
alumnus who was an assistant coach at
California from 1959 until he joined
the Stanford staff in 1964. Over the
past few seasons, he has been
responsible for determining the
majority of Stanford's offensive game
plans.

Christiansen, 43, has been an
assistant at Stanford since 1968.
Before joining Ralston's staff, he was
head coach of the San Francisco 49ers
for five years. At Stanford, he has
coached the linebackers, offensive
backfield and most recently, the
defensive backfield.
Ironically Christiansen told the
Daily last night that he had been
contacted on December 21 in Long
Beach by Saban who asked him about
his future coaching plans. But
Christiansen said that after Saban
resigned his general manager's post the
following day, he didn't hear any
further from the Bronco management.

stay on at Stanford as an assistant if he
doesn't get the head coaching job,

NEW BRONCâ€”After two Rose Bowl wins, Stanford football coach John Ralston
has agreed to try to shape up the Denver Broncos a bit. A search is underway for
a new coach for the Indians.
Christiansen said his plans were "flexible." He
cited his long residence in this area and said
that not getting the head coaching job
wouldn't necessarily mean he would
automatically join Ralston in Denver.
Defensive coordinator Gambold, 42, is the
only remaining assistant coach from Ralston's
original staff in 1963. Prior to coming here,
Gambold had coached at Oregon State under
the current Los Angeles Ram's head coach,
Tommy Prothro.
Sabbatical Postponed
Stanford Athletic Director Chuck Taylor,
who was to have begun a nine month sabbatical
this week, was back working in his office
yesterday afternoon, mainly because acting
Athletic Director Bob Young was attending
meetings of the National Collegiate Athletic
Association in Florida.
Taylor himself will leave for the NCAA
convention on Friday, but said, "before
leaving, I'll try to get as many procedural
questions resolved as possible. The faster a
decision can be reached, the better it will be
for everybody. We will move quickly to name
John's successor, so that no gaps will be left in
the winning spirit and momentum that he has
created in our football program."
Following the NCAA meetings, Taylor said
that he will be leaving on a 10-day cruise and
Young will assume his responsibilities in the
negotiations. He expressed hope that a
decision will be reached before he returns
from his cruise and the general opinion among
athletic department personnel was that a
decision should come within a week to 10
days.
Lyman Comments
President Richard Lyman will be involved
in the decision on a new coach. Yesterday, he
stated, "John Ralston has done a magnificent
job here and we're going to miss him. He has
understood the importance of treating
student-athletes as mature and thoughtful
people.
"We intend to maintain that tradition at
Stanford and I know that thousands of
Stanford people would wish to join me in

wishing John and Patty every good fortune as
they take up an exciting new life in Denver."
Gambold was quick to echo the hope for a
rapid decision. "Unfortunately it's not totally
a one man decision. So it may be lengthy, as it
was when John was hired. It took them a
month and a half to decide on him in 1963.
We don't want to lose the recruiting
momentum provided by the Rose Bowl."
Christiansen said that he *also hopes for a
quick decision but citing the fact that he,
Gambold, and White would be attending the
NCAA convention this weekend and the
American Football Coaches Association
meetings next week, he said that quick action
might be difficult.

"Leaving Stanford was
a difficult decision. I
do it with a lot of
regret

All that is really clear now is that Ralston
won't be the head coach here next fall.
Speaking yesterday morning, he expressed
mixed reactions on the move to Denver.
"I think that coaching at Denver will be a
tremendous thing. I can't wait to get up there,
roll my sleeves up and get my feet wet in
professional football. I'm going to get a team
