# Will Coach Denver Broncos
## Ralston Resigns, Takes Pro Post 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Four short days after leading
Stanford to a thrilling second
consecutive Rose Bowl championship,
Head Coach John Ralston yesterday
was named as the new head coach of
the National Football League's Denver
Broncos. Ralston was given a five year
contract which reportedly calls for an
annual salary in the $35,000-$50,000
range.
The 44-year-old Ralston has also

been offered the general manager's job
with Denver, and he says he will make
a decision regarding that position
during the next few weeks. "I want to
learn more about the duties of the
job." Regardless of whether he accepts
that job or not, Ralston indicated that
he will have a "free hand" in such
areas as staffing, player deals . ..
The 1970 Sporting News Collegiate
Coach-Of-The-Year replaces Lou
Saban, who resigned as the head
coach-general manager at Denver

following the 1971 season to accept a
similar position with the Buffalo Bills.
Saban resigned as head coach on
November 17 but stayed on as general
manager until December 22. Last
season 'under Saban, the Broncos
finished last in the Western Division of
the American Football Conference
with a 4-9-1 record.
Three Candidates
The outgoing Stanford coach said
yesterday that three of the assistant
coaches who worked under him, Jack
Christiansen, Bob Gambold and Mike
White, are prime candidates for the
top coaching spot he vacated.
"Anyone of those three could
ascend to the head coaching job. But
I'd be glad to take all three at Denver.
I will hold open a couple of spots at
Denver and wait until the head
coaching situation is cleared up. I am
very high on some of my Stanford
assistants and I would like to keep
them in my organization."
Speculation from a number of
sources is that White is the most likely
candidate of the three. The
36-year-old offensive coordinator was
the co-author with Ralston of
"Coaching Today's Athlete," a massive
football textbook published two
months ago.
Like Ralston, White is a California
alumnus who was an assistant coach at
California from 1959 until he joined
the Stanford staff in 1964. Over the
past few seasons, he has been
responsible for determining the
majority of Stanford's offensive game
plans.

Christiansen, 43, has been an
assistant at Stanford since 1968.
Before joining Ralston's staff, he was
head coach of the San Francisco 49ers
for five years. At Stanford, he has
coached the linebackers, offensive
backfield and most recently, the
defensive backfield.
Ironically Christiansen told the
Daily last night that he had been
contacted on December 21 in Long
Beach by Saban who asked him about
his future coaching plans. But
Christiansen said that after Saban
resigned his general manager's post the
following day, he didn't hear any
further from the Bronco management.
Last night when asked if he would
stay on at Stanford as an assistant if he
doesn't get the head coaching job,
