Officials Silent on Leak
WASHINGTON—The Nixon administration maintained
silence yesterday amid its biggest leaked-news furor since
the publication of the Pentagon Papers last June.
While newspapers ran lengthy accounts from secret
documents, FBI and other agents were reported trying to
find out who leaked them to columnist Jack Anderson.
The papers describe key White House strategy sessions
during the India-Pakistan war.
Anderson said the secret documents show an apparent
conflict between the Nixon administration's public
statements early in the two-week India-Pakistan war and
the positions its strategists were taking behind the scenes.

North Viets Toughen Stance
HONG KONG—The North Vietnamese toughened their
terms on the issue of prisoners yesterday by declaring that
the United States must end Vietnamization before they
are released.
This was the first time that Vietnamization was
directly linked to a release of the prisoners. President
Nixon has made Vietnamization a key point in his plans
for withdrawal of U.S. forces from Vietnam.
Radio Hanoi declared that "the only way for President
Nixon to get the U.S. prisoners of war back to their
families," is to observe these two points:
"1. Completely end the war of aggression in Vietnam
and withdraw all its troops from Vietnam, and
"2. Completely end Uie Vietnamization policy of
continuing the war."
Previously, the Communist negotiators at the Paris
peace talks had linked a prisoner release with a timetable
for U.S. withdrawal and the overthrow of President
Nguyen Van Thieu's regime in South Vietnam.
U.S. Bombs North Again
SAIGON—A U.S. escort fighter broke off from planes
assaulting enemy targets in Laos and made the first air
strike of 1972 against North Vietnam, the U.S. Command
said yesterdav.
