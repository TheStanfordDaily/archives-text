# No Drugs Found
## French Police Raid Tours Campus 
### ED KOHN Special to the Daily 
TOURS, FRANCE — Acting on a search warrant
issued by a local judge, 20 members of the French
national police yesterday morning searched seven
rooms for drugs in the Stanford-in-France building
and then briefly held seven students for questioning.
No drugs were found, and no charges have been
lodged against the seven, all but one of whom has
admitted smoking Hashish or marijuana in various
rooms of the campus facility during October.
In their well planned search, the police found
and confiscated one used Hashish pipe, several
unused pipes recently purchased in Morocco, and an
unmarked bottle of pills.
While campus directors and other persons acted
as witnesses, the rooms of three students still on
vacation were searched. The students are expected
to return here by Monday; it is unclear tonight
whether the police were attempting to locate them
for questioning or if they are planning to detain
them upon entry into France.
Police Misconduct?
Local French university officials later lodged a
protest with the police, charging that they violated a
complex French law that prevents them from
entering university buildings without special
permission from the university involved.
The policemen spent nearly two hours in and
around the building which has housed the Stanford
program here for more than 10 years.
After posting men at all exits and along both
exposed sides of the building, the main body of
police entered the building shortly after 8:00 a.m.
At least two men were sent to each floor to keep
students in their rooms.
This morning's search clearly was an extension of
"L'Affair Corcoran," which in the wake of

nationwide publicity, has continued to snowball and
has culminated in the arrest or detention of nearly
200 residents of Tours, most of them young.
Christine Corcoran, a former student here, has
been charged with smuggling about 20 grams of
hashish from Amsterdam into Tours. She apparently
has fled France and returned to the United States.
Director's Comment
In an interview with the Daily, Professor Robert
Walker, the Director of the Overseas Campuses,
inferred that the raid was brought on by "Christine
[Corcoran] and her friends," who. Walker said,
"have created an air of suspicion that will be very
hard to dispel." Walker confirmed that Corcoran
had in fact left France and that she was in the
United States now. He added that he was under the
impression that her departure from France was legal
as defined by the terms of her bail.
Walker said that if it was necessary he would
support the French university officials in their
protest against the police. He said that "raids of this
kind are really in bad form." Walker concluded by
saying that he would take punitive action against
students at the Tours campus if it was confirmed
that they were actually involved "in the
underground dope railroad."
Two Confessions
Today's search was triggered by detailed
confessions fron at least two French youths who
were either questioned or arrested during Christmas
vacation. One of the youths reportedly left for a six
month stay in England minutes after the search
began.
According to one campus official, the search may
have been in the planning stages for two weeks.
French police officials were tight-lipped about the
operation. Several cautioned students against
picture taking, and one, apparently the officer in

charge, told this reporter that, "You can't publicize
this search."
Professor Paul LeMoal, one of the campus
directors, said that he was "surprised" and
"angered" at the search. He stated, however, that at
the time of the search, it appeared to be legal, and
in compliance with the police officers—who were
furnished with a master key to the students'
rooms—was obligatory.
The students themselves were increasingly angry
as the search progressed, and within one half hour,
the police in the corridors were unable to keep
people from leaving their rooms at will. Class
attendance was below normal as students
congregated in the lobbies and corridors to discuss
the search.
No Campus Change
LeMoal, who earlier told students here that the
French government might close down the campus if
there are any more drug incidents, said he didn't
think today's unprecedented search would effect
the campuses' standing. He said he planned to
confer with Overseas Campuses Director Walker.
LeMoal declined to speculate on any possible
disciplinary action that might be taken against the
students who confessed to using drugs.
Today's incident was the second time a group of
Stanford-in-France XXIII members have been taken
to police headquarters in Tours for questioning
about possible drug use. In late October, seven
students were stopped, searched and questioned as
they got off the train from Amsterdam. The police
found no drugs, and all were released.
During the recently ended vacation, three
students from the group were singled out in a
Jerusalem hotel and their room searched at 2:00
a.m. Other students reported difficulties with
Spanish, Swiss, and French border authorities.

attendance was below normal as students
congregated in the lobbies and corridors to discuss
the search.
No Campus Change
LeMoal, who earlier told students here that the
French government might close down the campus if
there are any more drug incidents, said he didn't
think today's unprecedented search would effect
the campuses' standing. He said he planned to
confer with Overseas Campuses Director Walker.
LeMoal declined to speculate on any possible
disciplinary action that might be taken against the
students who confessed to using drugs.
Today's incident was the second time a group of
Stanford-in-France XXIII members have been taken
to police headquarters in Tours for questioning
about possible drug use. In late October, seven
students were stopped, searched and questioned as
they got off the train from Amsterdam. The police
found no drugs, and all were released.
During the recently ended vacation, three
students from the group were singled out in a
Jerusalem hotel and their room searched at 2:00
a.m. Other students reported difficulties with
Spanish, Swiss, and French border authorities.
TOURS, FRANCE — Acting on a search warrant
issued by a local judge, 20 members of the French
national police yesterday morning searched seven
rooms for drugs in the Stanford-in-France building
and then briefly held seven students for questioning.
No drugs were found, and no charges have been
lodged against the seven, all but one of whom has
admitted smoking Hashish or marijuana in various
rooms of the campus facility during October.
In their well planned search, the police found
and confiscated one used Hashish pipe, several
unused pipes recently purchased in Morocco, and an
unmarked bottle of pills.
While campus directors and other persons acted
as witnesses, the rooms of three students still on
vacation were searched. The students are expected
to return here by Monday; it is unclear tonight
whether the police were attempting to locate them
for questioning or if they are planning to detain
them upon entry into France.
Police Misconduct?
Local French university officials later lodged a
protest with the police, charging that they violated a
complex French law that prevents them from
entering university buildings without special
permission from the university involved.
The policemen spent nearly two hours in and
around the building which has housed the Stanford
program here for more than 10 years.
After posting men at all exits and along both
exposed sides of the building, the main body of
police entered the building shortly after 8:00 a.m.
At least two men were sent to each floor to keep
students in their rooms.
This morning's search clearly was an extension of
"L'Affair Corcoran," which in the wake of

nationwide publicity, has continued to snowball and
has culminated in the arrest or detention of nearly
200 residents of Tours, most of them young.
Christine Corcoran, a former student here, has
been charged with smuggling about 20 grams of
hashish from Amsterdam into Tours. She apparently
has fled France and returned to the United States.
Director's Comment
In an interview with the Daily, Professor Robert
Walker, the Director of the Overseas Campuses,
inferred that the raid was brought on by "Christine
[Corcoran] and her friends," who. Walker said,
"have created an air of suspicion that will be very
hard to dispel." Walker confirmed that Corcoran
had in fact left France and that she was in the
United States now. He added that he was under the
impression that her departure from France was legal
as defined by the terms of her bail.
Walker said that if it was necessary he would
support the French university officials in their
protest against the police. He said that "raids of this
kind are really in bad form." Walker concluded by
saying that he would take punitive action against
students at the Tours campus if it was confirmed
that they were actually involved "in the
underground dope railroad."
Two Confessions
Today's search was triggered by detailed
confessions fron at least two French youths who
were either questioned or arrested during Christmas
vacation. One of the youths reportedly left for a six
month stay in England minutes after the search
began.
According to one campus official, the search may
have been in the planning stages for two weeks.
French police officials were tight-lipped about the
operation. Several cautioned students against
picture taking, and one, apparently the officer in

charge, told this reporter that, "You can't publicize
this search."
Professor Paul LeMoal, one of the campus
directors, said that he was "surprised" and
"angered" at the search. He stated, however, that at
the time of the search, it appeared to be legal, and
in compliance with the police officers—who were
furnished with a master key to the students'
rooms—was obligatory.
The students themselves were increasingly angry
as the search progressed, and within one half hour,
the police in the corridors were unable to keep
people from leaving their rooms at will. Class
attendance was below normal as students
congregated in the lobbies and corridors to discuss
the search.
