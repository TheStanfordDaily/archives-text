# Board 5-2 For Dismissal, Kennedy, Brown Dissent
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
The faculty Advisory Board
recommended "immediate dismissal"
of professor-revolutionary H. Bruce
Franklin in a 5-2 decision announced
yesterday.
The majority found that "by urging
and inciting to the use of illegal
coercion and violence" Franklin had
"repeatedly and seriously infringed the
rights of others in the University, and
significantly increased the risk of
injury to them and to University
property."
The five senior professors asked
that Franklin's immediate dismissal be
paired with a continuance of his salary
through August so that the "severity"
of the penalty would be "softened
somewhat."
In dissenting opinions, calling for
suspension rather than dismissal,
Board Chairman Donald Kennedy and
Professor Robert McAfee Brown
warned, "We see substantial costs in

Professor Franklin's loss to the
institution; they are measured
externally in the form of corrosive
effects on academic freedom, and
internally in terms of lost challenge
and the subtle inhibition of dissent."
(See excerpts from the decision,
pages 4, 5,6, and 7).
The Board unanimously agreed that
Franklin should be punished for a
February 10 speech in White Plaza.
The majority said he also should be
disciplined for encouraging resistance
to a police dispersal order at the
Computation Center the same day and
for inciting confrontation during an
Old Union rally that night.
Cleared In Lodge Case
But the Board unanimously found
that Franklin had not "significantly
contributed" to the January 11
disruption of a speech by Henry Cabot
Lodge.
The Board's ruling is formally only
a recommendation to President
Richard W. Lyman, although Lyman is
expected to accept the Board's
endorsement of the charges he brought
against Franklin in February.
Lyman said he was considering the
158-page report as "a matter of
highest priority" but will have no
comment on it until he has completed
his study of the recommendations. His
statement is reportedly not expected
until Friday or later. *
Franklin, an Associate Professor of
English and a well-known Maoist
revolutionary, called the decision
"fascist" and said it proved "there is
no such thing as freedom for people
on the left in any college in this
country."
The decision was delivered to
Franklin and the administration at
about 8 a.m. yesterday, ending the
unprecedented three-month-long
consideration of charges against the
tenured faculty activist.
After a six-week hearing, involving
over 100 witnesses, the Board
deliberated almost two months before
releasing its decision.
The majority report said that a penalty lesser than
dismissal "would fail to recognize the fundamental nature
and severity of Professor Franklin's attacks on the
University of which he is a member."
In the dissent, Kennedy urged that Franklin be
suspended for two quarters, without pay during one of
the quarters. Brown urged the administration and Trustees
to reconsider the dismissal recommendation. He said
Franklin should be suspended for one quarter without pay
and should not be dismissed even if all the charges were
sustained.
Brown's dissent voiced his "fear that we may do untold
harm to ourselves and the cause of higher education
unless, by imposing a penalty short of dismissal, we seek
to keep (Franklin) as a very uncomfortable, but very
important part of what this University, or any university,
is meant to be."
But the majority rejected arguments that Franklin's
dismissal would repress dissent. They said, "Our decision
silences neither political dissent nor criticism of the
University. The only speech or behavior repressed by the
Board's finding is that which clearly urges and incites
others to unlawful coercion or violence, or to acts likely
to increase the risk of injury to other persons."
The majority wrote that Franklin, an expert on the
writings of Herman Melville, "engages in a pattern of
conduct that constitutes a continual challenge to the
institution: he states that he wishes to encourage violent
and coercive actions, but at the same time not to risk loss
of his position in the University."
The entire text of the bulky decision will be published
in the Daily next week, but an initial summarization
follows.
STANDARDS
The Board noted that "much attention has been paid
by the parties to constitutional questions" raised in the
case. It said that Franklin was granted full Constitutional
protections and that the conduct charged by the
administration was "clearly within the reach of
institutional authority."
The opinion rejected Franklin s argument that the
campus rules under which he was charged were vague
and overbroad." It said that the concepts of "appropriate
function" and "duty" in the tenure policy "do reflect
commonly understood and accepted standards of
conduct, including restraints as well as positive
obligations."
The professor-judges added that "the Policy on
Campus Disruptions provides an explicit though not
exhaustive list of conduct which is proscribed" under the
tenure policy.
Although conceding that more specific faculty rules
could be "a more readily interpretable guide," the Board
said it favored the more flexible "present reliance on
largely unwritten standards."
Discussing appropriate standards to draw the line
between "free speech" and incitement, the Board said a
"vague exhortation is not punishable" but that there need
not "be an exact correspondence between specific acts
advocated and those that follow."
The majority said that "one of the central themes in
the entire case" was the mixture of legal and illegal
actions urged in Franklin's speeches. But the Board said
"the presence of peaceful recommendations cannot

immunize a person from sanctions if he has urged
imminent coercion and violence as well."
The decision also rejected Franklin's contention that
his speeches out of the classroom were "extracurricular"
to his duties as a professor, saying "the speech of a faculty
member to a campus audience on campus issues is subject
to regulation."
LODGE INCIDENT
The Board unanimously found that there was not
"strongly persuasive evidence that Professor Franklin's
shouts triggered the demonstration or that he was
personally guilty of 'significantly contributing' to the
disruption that finally forced the cancellation of the
meeting."
Although Franklin was not shown to be a major
participant, the disruption was sufficient to require
closing the meeting, the Board ruled, adding that heckling
which may be appropriate during "political-picnic
oratory" is not proper at a campus symposium.
The recommendation also rejected Franklin's
contentions that the heckling was justified because Lodge
was a "war criminal" or because Hoover Institution had
sponsored a politically biased conference.
WHITE PLAZA SPEECH
The Board unanimously agreed that Franklin had
incited occupation of the Computation Center during a
noontime rally in White Plaza, Feb. 10. The
recommendation commented that Franklin "gave the
longest and closing speech of the rally." He urged a
"shutdown" of the computer, the report charged,
"knowing that his advocacy of 'shutdown' would be
interpreted by at least a substantial portion of the
audience as calling for forceful disruption of the operation
of the Center. Indeed, we believe that this is what he
meant."
Rejecting Franklin's contention that he was sincerely
urging a "voluntary boycott," the Board said Franklin had
used the labor term "strike" as "a flag in which to wrap a
much broader range of conduct."
The Board said that Franklin "must have reasonably
expected" the occupation of the computer facility and
that "there was a risk of serious damage to the computer
and its users."
The Board rejected Franklin's contention that the
protest was justified because of a war-related project using
the computer center illegally. The professors said Franklin
and other protestors never attempted to use appropriate
channels to challenge the "Gamut-H" project.
DISPERSAL ORDER
The five-man majority found that Franklin "played a
central role in reversing the movement" of demonstrators
outside the Computer Center, inciting them to resist a
police dispersal order.
They said that even if Franklin's objections to the
dispersal order were not directly shouted to the crowd,
"he must reasonably have expected" that a result of his
shouts to police from a substantial distance would be to
incite resistance by demonstrators.
The minority ruled that Franklin's "purpose was to
encourage others to remain" and rejected his contentions
that he was only urging "faculty observers" to stay, that
he spoke only to professors and the police, and that he
was attempting to defuse an imminent charge.
In a dissenting interpretation, Brown and Kennedy
argued that Franklin was, in part, "trying to assert" his

right to "question a police order he [believed)
unreasonable and unlawful."
They said they found it "plausible rather than
difficult" to believe that Franklin was attempting
conciliation even though his "manner of seeking this end
was unwise."
It was clearly possible that he was addressing his
remarks only to police and faculty observer Lincoln
Moses, the dissenters added.
OLD UNION SPEECH
With Kennedy and Brown again dissenting, the
majority ruled that Franklin had incited disruption in a
nighttime speech at the Old Union.
They said Franklin delivered an "intense" speech
during the rally, then delivered another address at the end
of the rally.
According to the majority report, Franklin's reference
to "people's war" suggested a range of actions which "can
clearly include guerilla warfare."
The majority argued that Franklin "came into a
combustive situation, focused hostility on certain targets,
intensified existing hostility toward those targets, and
urged a spectrum of actions against them: some peaceful,
some coercive, some violent."
In their dissents on this charge, Kennedy and Brown
argued that no interpretations of Franklin's speech can be
offered with "a great deal of certainty." They said that
although he may have been advocating "a range of actions
some of which may have been illegal, we do not find the
evidence strongly persuasive that his speech constituted
the advocacy of imminent lawless action."
They charged that punishing such an ambiguous speech

could force faculty members "to guard against possible
cryptic meanings" when speaking during a situation of
"high risk." They warned against "the social cost of such
a prohibition."
SANCTIONS
In choosing a sanction, the majority found that
"rehabilitation" was not a useful concept. "Professor
Franklin's announced convictions about the guilt of the
university appear deeply-held, and his opposition to the
institution in its present form seems implacable."
The majority chose the "deterring" function of a
penalty in the case as a more valid standard than
"rehabilitation."
They added that a lesser penalty than dismissal
"assumes that a satisfactory relationship between
Professor Franklin and the other members of the
university can be re-established."
MINORITY REPORTS
Brown and Kennedy argued that it cannot "be argued
conclusively" that penalties other than dismissal would
fail to deter Franklin from "further coercive acts."
Brown and Kennedy said that Franklin was a
"prominent symbol" of the university's "diversity and
challenge."
In his personal dissent, Brown added that "many
aspects of the University need to be changed . . . Albeit in
a harsh and strident manner, Professor Franklin has
helped call attention to many of these realities."
He urged administrators and trustees to "consider once
again" whether "a dismissal penalty does not represent a
higher cost than the University ought to pay."

a harsh and strident manner, Professor Franklin has
helped call attention to many of these realities."
He urged administrators and trustees to "consider once
again" whether "a dismissal penalty does not represent a
higher cost than the University ought to pay."
The faculty Advisory Board
recommended "immediate dismissal"
of professor-revolutionary H. Bruce
Franklin in a 5-2 decision announced
yesterday.
The majority found that "by urging
and inciting to the use of illegal
coercion and violence" Franklin had
"repeatedly and seriously infringed the
rights of others in the University, and
significantly increased the risk of
injury to them and to University
property."
The five senior professors asked
that Franklin's immediate dismissal be
paired with a continuance of his salary
through August so that the "severity"
of the penalty would be "softened
somewhat."
In dissenting opinions, calling for
suspension rather than dismissal,
Board Chairman Donald Kennedy and
Professor Robert McAfee Brown
warned, "We see substantial costs in

Professor Franklin's loss to the
institution; they are measured
externally in the form of corrosive
effects on academic freedom, and
internally in terms of lost challenge
and the subtle inhibition of dissent."
(See excerpts from the decision,
pages 4, 5,6, and 7).
The Board unanimously agreed that
Franklin should be punished for a
February 10 speech in White Plaza.
The majority said he also should be
disciplined for encouraging resistance
to a police dispersal order at the
Computation Center the same day and
for inciting confrontation during an
Old Union rally that night.
Cleared In Lodge Case
But the Board unanimously found
that Franklin had not "significantly
contributed" to the January 11
disruption of a speech by Henry Cabot
Lodge.
The Board's ruling is formally only
a recommendation to President
Richard W. Lyman, although Lyman is
expected to accept the Board's
endorsement of the charges he brought
against Franklin in February.
Lyman said he was considering the
158-page report as "a matter of
highest priority" but will have no
comment on it until he has completed
his study of the recommendations. His
statement is reportedly not expected
until Friday or later. *
Franklin, an Associate Professor of
English and a well-known Maoist
revolutionary, called the decision
"fascist" and said it proved "there is
no such thing as freedom for people
on the left in any college in this
country."
The decision was delivered to
Franklin and the administration at
about 8 a.m. yesterday, ending the
unprecedented three-month-long
consideration of charges against the
tenured faculty activist.
After a six-week hearing, involving
over 100 witnesses, the Board
deliberated almost two months before
releasing its decision.
The majority report said that a penalty lesser than
dismissal "would fail to recognize the fundamental nature
and severity of Professor Franklin's attacks on the
University of which he is a member."
In the dissent, Kennedy urged that Franklin be
suspended for two quarters, without pay during one of
the quarters. Brown urged the administration and Trustees
to reconsider the dismissal recommendation. He said
Franklin should be suspended for one quarter without pay
and should not be dismissed even if all the charges were
sustained.
Brown's dissent voiced his "fear that we may do untold
harm to ourselves and the cause of higher education
unless, by imposing a penalty short of dismissal, we seek
to keep (Franklin) as a very uncomfortable, but very
important part of what this University, or any university,
is meant to be."
But the majority rejected arguments that Franklin's
dismissal would repress dissent. They said, "Our decision
silences neither political dissent nor criticism of the
University. The only speech or behavior repressed by the
Board's finding is that which clearly urges and incites
others to unlawful coercion or violence, or to acts likely
to increase the risk of injury to other persons."
The majority wrote that Franklin, an expert on the
writings of Herman Melville, "engages in a pattern of
conduct that constitutes a continual challenge to the
institution: he states that he wishes to encourage violent
and coercive actions, but at the same time not to risk loss
of his position in the University."
The entire text of the bulky decision will be published
in the Daily next week, but an initial summarization
follows.
STANDARDS
The Board noted that "much attention has been paid
by the parties to constitutional questions" raised in the
case. It said that Franklin was granted full Constitutional
protections and that the conduct charged by the
administration was "clearly within the reach of
institutional authority."
The opinion rejected Franklin s argument that the
campus rules under which he was charged were vague
and overbroad." It said that the concepts of "appropriate
function" and "duty" in the tenure policy "do reflect
commonly understood and accepted standards of
conduct, including restraints as well as positive
obligations."
The professor-judges added that "the Policy on
Campus Disruptions provides an explicit though not
exhaustive list of conduct which is proscribed" under the
tenure policy.
Although conceding that more specific faculty rules
could be "a more readily interpretable guide," the Board
said it favored the more flexible "present reliance on
largely unwritten standards."
Discussing appropriate standards to draw the line
between "free speech" and incitement, the Board said a
"vague exhortation is not punishable" but that there need
not "be an exact correspondence between specific acts
advocated and those that follow."
The majority said that "one of the central themes in
the entire case" was the mixture of legal and illegal
actions urged in Franklin's speeches. But the Board said
"the presence of peaceful recommendations cannot

immunize a person from sanctions if he has urged
imminent coercion and violence as well."
The decision also rejected Franklin's contention that
his speeches out of the classroom were "extracurricular"
to his duties as a professor, saying "the speech of a faculty
member to a campus audience on campus issues is subject
to regulation."
LODGE INCIDENT
The Board unanimously found that there was not
"strongly persuasive evidence that Professor Franklin's
shouts triggered the demonstration or that he was
personally guilty of 'significantly contributing' to the
disruption that finally forced the cancellation of the
meeting."
Although Franklin was not shown to be a major
participant, the disruption was sufficient to require
closing the meeting, the Board ruled, adding that heckling
which may be appropriate during "political-picnic
oratory" is not proper at a campus symposium.
The recommendation also rejected Franklin's
contentions that the heckling was justified because Lodge
was a "war criminal" or because Hoover Institution had
sponsored a politically biased conference.
WHITE PLAZA SPEECH
The Board unanimously agreed that Franklin had
incited occupation of the Computation Center during a
noontime rally in White Plaza, Feb. 10. The
recommendation commented that Franklin "gave the
longest and closing speech of the rally." He urged a
"shutdown" of the computer, the report charged,
"knowing that his advocacy of 'shutdown' would be
interpreted by at least a substantial portion of the
audience as calling for forceful disruption of the operation
of the Center. Indeed, we believe that this is what he
meant."
Rejecting Franklin's contention that he was sincerely
urging a "voluntary boycott," the Board said Franklin had
used the labor term "strike" as "a flag in which to wrap a
much broader range of conduct."
The Board said that Franklin "must have reasonably
expected" the occupation of the computer facility and
that "there was a risk of serious damage to the computer
and its users."
The Board rejected Franklin's contention that the
protest was justified because of a war-related project using
the computer center illegally. The professors said Franklin
and other protestors never attempted to use appropriate
channels to challenge the "Gamut-H" project.
DISPERSAL ORDER
The five-man majority found that Franklin "played a
central role in reversing the movement" of demonstrators
outside the Computer Center, inciting them to resist a
police dispersal order.
They said that even if Franklin's objections to the
dispersal order were not directly shouted to the crowd,
"he must reasonably have expected" that a result of his
shouts to police from a substantial distance would be to
incite resistance by demonstrators.
The minority ruled that Franklin's "purpose was to
encourage others to remain" and rejected his contentions
that he was only urging "faculty observers" to stay, that
he spoke only to professors and the police, and that he
was attempting to defuse an imminent charge.
In a dissenting interpretation, Brown and Kennedy
argued that Franklin was, in part, "trying to assert" his

right to "question a police order he [believed)
unreasonable and unlawful."
They said they found it "plausible rather than
difficult" to believe that Franklin was attempting
conciliation even though his "manner of seeking this end
was unwise."
It was clearly possible that he was addressing his
remarks only to police and faculty observer Lincoln
Moses, the dissenters added.
OLD UNION SPEECH
With Kennedy and Brown again dissenting, the
majority ruled that Franklin had incited disruption in a
nighttime speech at the Old Union.
They said Franklin delivered an "intense" speech
during the rally, then delivered another address at the end
of the rally.
According to the majority report, Franklin's reference
to "people's war" suggested a range of actions which "can
clearly include guerilla warfare."
The majority argued that Franklin "came into a
combustive situation, focused hostility on certain targets,
intensified existing hostility toward those targets, and
urged a spectrum of actions against them: some peaceful,
some coercive, some violent."
In their dissents on this charge, Kennedy and Brown
argued that no interpretations of Franklin's speech can be
offered with "a great deal of certainty." They said that
although he may have been advocating "a range of actions
some of which may have been illegal, we do not find the
evidence strongly persuasive that his speech constituted
the advocacy of imminent lawless action."
They charged that punishing such an ambiguous speech

could force faculty members "to guard against possible
cryptic meanings" when speaking during a situation of
"high risk." They warned against "the social cost of such
a prohibition."
SANCTIONS
In choosing a sanction, the majority found that
"rehabilitation" was not a useful concept. "Professor
Franklin's announced convictions about the guilt of the
university appear deeply-held, and his opposition to the
institution in its present form seems implacable."
The majority chose the "deterring" function of a
penalty in the case as a more valid standard than
"rehabilitation."
They added that a lesser penalty than dismissal
"assumes that a satisfactory relationship between
Professor Franklin and the other members of the
university can be re-established."
MINORITY REPORTS
Brown and Kennedy argued that it cannot "be argued
conclusively" that penalties other than dismissal would
fail to deter Franklin from "further coercive acts."
Brown and Kennedy said that Franklin was a
"prominent symbol" of the university's "diversity and
challenge."
In his personal dissent, Brown added that "many
aspects of the University need to be changed . . . Albeit in
a harsh and strident manner, Professor Franklin has
helped call attention to many of these realities."
He urged administrators and trustees to "consider once

Brown and Kennedy said that Franklin was a
"prominent symbol" of the university's "diversity and
challenge."
In his personal dissent, Brown added that "many
aspects of the University need to be changed . . . Albeit in
a harsh and strident manner, Professor Franklin has
helped call attention to many of these realities."
He urged administrators and trustees to "consider once
again" whether "a dismissal penalty does not represent a
higher cost than the University ought to pay."
The faculty Advisory Board
recommended "immediate dismissal"
of professor-revolutionary H. Bruce
Franklin in a 5-2 decision announced
yesterday.
The majority found that "by urging
and inciting to the use of illegal
coercion and violence" Franklin had
"repeatedly and seriously infringed the
rights of others in the University, and
significantly increased the risk of
injury to them and to University
property."
The five senior professors asked
that Franklin's immediate dismissal be
paired with a continuance of his salary
through August so that the "severity"
of the penalty would be "softened
somewhat."
In dissenting opinions, calling for
suspension rather than dismissal,
Board Chairman Donald Kennedy and
Professor Robert McAfee Brown
warned, "We see substantial costs in

Professor Franklin's loss to the
institution; they are measured
externally in the form of corrosive
effects on academic freedom, and
internally in terms of lost challenge
and the subtle inhibition of dissent."
(See excerpts from the decision,
pages 4, 5,6, and 7).
The Board unanimously agreed that
Franklin should be punished for a
February 10 speech in White Plaza.
The majority said he also should be
disciplined for encouraging resistance
to a police dispersal order at the
Computation Center the same day and
for inciting confrontation during an
Old Union rally that night.
Cleared In Lodge Case
But the Board unanimously found
that Franklin had not "significantly
contributed" to the January 11
disruption of a speech by Henry Cabot
Lodge.
The Board's ruling is formally only
a recommendation to President
Richard W. Lyman, although Lyman is
expected to accept the Board's
endorsement of the charges he brought
against Franklin in February.
Lyman said he was considering the
158-page report as "a matter of
highest priority" but will have no
comment on it until he has completed
his study of the recommendations. His
statement is reportedly not expected
until Friday or later. *
Franklin, an Associate Professor of
English and a well-known Maoist
revolutionary, called the decision
"fascist" and said it proved "there is
no such thing as freedom for people
on the left in any college in this
country."
The decision was delivered to
Franklin and the administration at
about 8 a.m. yesterday, ending the
unprecedented three-month-long
consideration of charges against the
tenured faculty activist.
After a six-week hearing, involving
over 100 witnesses, the Board
deliberated almost two months before
releasing its decision.
The majority report said that a penalty lesser than
dismissal "would fail to recognize the fundamental nature
and severity of Professor Franklin's attacks on the
University of which he is a member."
In the dissent, Kennedy urged that Franklin be
suspended for two quarters, without pay during one of
the quarters. Brown urged the administration and Trustees
to reconsider the dismissal recommendation. He said
Franklin should be suspended for one quarter without pay
and should not be dismissed even if all the charges were
sustained.
Brown's dissent voiced his "fear that we may do untold
harm to ourselves and the cause of higher education
unless, by imposing a penalty short of dismissal, we seek
to keep (Franklin) as a very uncomfortable, but very
important part of what this University, or any university,
is meant to be."
But the majority rejected arguments that Franklin's
dismissal would repress dissent. They said, "Our decision
silences neither political dissent nor criticism of the
University. The only speech or behavior repressed by the
Board's finding is that which clearly urges and incites
others to unlawful coercion or violence, or to acts likely
to increase the risk of injury to other persons."
The majority wrote that Franklin, an expert on the
writings of Herman Melville, "engages in a pattern of
conduct that constitutes a continual challenge to the
institution: he states that he wishes to encourage violent
and coercive actions, but at the same time not to risk loss
of his position in the University."
The entire text of the bulky decision will be published
in the Daily next week, but an initial summarization
follows.
STANDARDS
The Board noted that "much attention has been paid
by the parties to constitutional questions" raised in the
case. It said that Franklin was granted full Constitutional
protections and that the conduct charged by the
administration was "clearly within the reach of
institutional authority."
The opinion rejected Franklin s argument that the
campus rules under which he was charged were vague
and overbroad." It said that the concepts of "appropriate
function" and "duty" in the tenure policy "do reflect
commonly understood and accepted standards of
conduct, including restraints as well as positive
obligations."
The professor-judges added that "the Policy on
Campus Disruptions provides an explicit though not
exhaustive list of conduct which is proscribed" under the
tenure policy.
Although conceding that more specific faculty rules
could be "a more readily interpretable guide," the Board
said it favored the more flexible "present reliance on
largely unwritten standards."
Discussing appropriate standards to draw the line
between "free speech" and incitement, the Board said a
"vague exhortation is not punishable" but that there need
not "be an exact correspondence between specific acts
advocated and those that follow."
The majority said that "one of the central themes in
the entire case" was the mixture of legal and illegal
actions urged in Franklin's speeches. But the Board said
"the presence of peaceful recommendations cannot

immunize a person from sanctions if he has urged
imminent coercion and violence as well."
The decision also rejected Franklin's contention that
his speeches out of the classroom were "extracurricular"
to his duties as a professor, saying "the speech of a faculty
member to a campus audience on campus issues is subject
to regulation."
LODGE INCIDENT
The Board unanimously found that there was not
"strongly persuasive evidence that Professor Franklin's
shouts triggered the demonstration or that he was
personally guilty of 'significantly contributing' to the
disruption that finally forced the cancellation of the
meeting."
Although Franklin was not shown to be a major
participant, the disruption was sufficient to require
closing the meeting, the Board ruled, adding that heckling
which may be appropriate during "political-picnic
oratory" is not proper at a campus symposium.
The recommendation also rejected Franklin's
contentions that the heckling was justified because Lodge
was a "war criminal" or because Hoover Institution had
sponsored a politically biased conference.
WHITE PLAZA SPEECH
The Board unanimously agreed that Franklin had
incited occupation of the Computation Center during a
noontime rally in White Plaza, Feb. 10. The
recommendation commented that Franklin "gave the
longest and closing speech of the rally." He urged a
"shutdown" of the computer, the report charged,
"knowing that his advocacy of 'shutdown' would be
interpreted by at least a substantial portion of the
audience as calling for forceful disruption of the operation
of the Center. Indeed, we believe that this is what he
meant."
Rejecting Franklin's contention that he was sincerely
urging a "voluntary boycott," the Board said Franklin had
used the labor term "strike" as "a flag in which to wrap a
much broader range of conduct."
The Board said that Franklin "must have reasonably
expected" the occupation of the computer facility and
that "there was a risk of serious damage to the computer
and its users."
The Board rejected Franklin's contention that the
protest was justified because of a war-related project using
the computer center illegally. The professors said Franklin
and other protestors never attempted to use appropriate
channels to challenge the "Gamut-H" project.
DISPERSAL ORDER
The five-man majority found that Franklin "played a
central role in reversing the movement" of demonstrators
outside the Computer Center, inciting them to resist a
police dispersal order.
They said that even if Franklin's objections to the
dispersal order were not directly shouted to the crowd,
"he must reasonably have expected" that a result of his
shouts to police from a substantial distance would be to
incite resistance by demonstrators.
The minority ruled that Franklin's "purpose was to
encourage others to remain" and rejected his contentions
that he was only urging "faculty observers" to stay, that
he spoke only to professors and the police, and that he
was attempting to defuse an imminent charge.
In a dissenting interpretation, Brown and Kennedy
argued that Franklin was, in part, "trying to assert" his

right to "question a police order he [believed)
unreasonable and unlawful."
They said they found it "plausible rather than
difficult" to believe that Franklin was attempting
conciliation even though his "manner of seeking this end
was unwise."
It was clearly possible that he was addressing his
remarks only to police and faculty observer Lincoln
Moses, the dissenters added.
OLD UNION SPEECH
With Kennedy and Brown again dissenting, the
majority ruled that Franklin had incited disruption in a
nighttime speech at the Old Union.
They said Franklin delivered an "intense" speech
during the rally, then delivered another address at the end
of the rally.
According to the majority report, Franklin's reference
to "people's war" suggested a range of actions which "can
clearly include guerilla warfare."
The majority argued that Franklin "came into a
combustive situation, focused hostility on certain targets,
intensified existing hostility toward those targets, and
urged a spectrum of actions against them: some peaceful,
some coercive, some violent."
In their dissents on this charge, Kennedy and Brown
argued that no interpretations of Franklin's speech can be
offered with "a great deal of certainty." They said that
although he may have been advocating "a range of actions
some of which may have been illegal, we do not find the
evidence strongly persuasive that his speech constituted
the advocacy of imminent lawless action."
They charged that punishing such an ambiguous speech

could force faculty members "to guard against possible
cryptic meanings" when speaking during a situation of
"high risk." They warned against "the social cost of such
a prohibition."
SANCTIONS
In choosing a sanction, the majority found that
"rehabilitation" was not a useful concept. "Professor
Franklin's announced convictions about the guilt of the
university appear deeply-held, and his opposition to the
institution in its present form seems implacable."
The majority chose the "deterring" function of a
penalty in the case as a more valid standard than
"rehabilitation."
They added that a lesser penalty than dismissal
"assumes that a satisfactory relationship between
Professor Franklin and the other members of the
university can be re-established."
MINORITY REPORTS
Brown and Kennedy argued that it cannot "be argued
conclusively" that penalties other than dismissal would
fail to deter Franklin from "further coercive acts."
Brown and Kennedy said that Franklin was a
"prominent symbol" of the university's "diversity and
challenge."
In his personal dissent, Brown added that "many

university can be re-established."
MINORITY REPORTS
Brown and Kennedy argued that it cannot "be argued
conclusively" that penalties other than dismissal would
fail to deter Franklin from "further coercive acts."
Brown and Kennedy said that Franklin was a
"prominent symbol" of the university's "diversity and
challenge."
In his personal dissent, Brown added that "many
aspects of the University need to be changed . . . Albeit in
a harsh and strident manner, Professor Franklin has
helped call attention to many of these realities."
He urged administrators and trustees to "consider once
again" whether "a dismissal penalty does not represent a
higher cost than the University ought to pay."
The faculty Advisory Board
recommended "immediate dismissal"
of professor-revolutionary H. Bruce
Franklin in a 5-2 decision announced
yesterday.
The majority found that "by urging
and inciting to the use of illegal
coercion and violence" Franklin had
"repeatedly and seriously infringed the
rights of others in the University, and
significantly increased the risk of
injury to them and to University
property."
The five senior professors asked
that Franklin's immediate dismissal be
paired with a continuance of his salary
through August so that the "severity"
of the penalty would be "softened
somewhat."
In dissenting opinions, calling for
suspension rather than dismissal,
Board Chairman Donald Kennedy and
Professor Robert McAfee Brown
warned, "We see substantial costs in

Professor Franklin's loss to the
institution; they are measured
externally in the form of corrosive
effects on academic freedom, and
internally in terms of lost challenge
and the subtle inhibition of dissent."
(See excerpts from the decision,
pages 4, 5,6, and 7).
The Board unanimously agreed that
Franklin should be punished for a
February 10 speech in White Plaza.
The majority said he also should be
disciplined for encouraging resistance
to a police dispersal order at the
Computation Center the same day and
for inciting confrontation during an
Old Union rally that night.
Cleared In Lodge Case
But the Board unanimously found
that Franklin had not "significantly
contributed" to the January 11
disruption of a speech by Henry Cabot
Lodge.
The Board's ruling is formally only
a recommendation to President
Richard W. Lyman, although Lyman is
expected to accept the Board's
endorsement of the charges he brought
against Franklin in February.
Lyman said he was considering the
158-page report as "a matter of
highest priority" but will have no
comment on it until he has completed
his study of the recommendations. His
statement is reportedly not expected
until Friday or later. *
Franklin, an Associate Professor of
English and a well-known Maoist
revolutionary, called the decision
"fascist" and said it proved "there is
no such thing as freedom for people
on the left in any college in this
country."
The decision was delivered to
Franklin and the administration at
about 8 a.m. yesterday, ending the
unprecedented three-month-long
consideration of charges against the
tenured faculty activist.
After a six-week hearing, involving
over 100 witnesses, the Board
deliberated almost two months before
releasing its decision.
The majority report said that a penalty lesser than
dismissal "would fail to recognize the fundamental nature
and severity of Professor Franklin's attacks on the
University of which he is a member."
In the dissent, Kennedy urged that Franklin be
suspended for two quarters, without pay during one of
the quarters. Brown urged the administration and Trustees
to reconsider the dismissal recommendation. He said
Franklin should be suspended for one quarter without pay
and should not be dismissed even if all the charges were
sustained.
Brown's dissent voiced his "fear that we may do untold
harm to ourselves and the cause of higher education
unless, by imposing a penalty short of dismissal, we seek
to keep (Franklin) as a very uncomfortable, but very
important part of what this University, or any university,
is meant to be."
But the majority rejected arguments that Franklin's
dismissal would repress dissent. They said, "Our decision
silences neither political dissent nor criticism of the
University. The only speech or behavior repressed by the
Board's finding is that which clearly urges and incites
others to unlawful coercion or violence, or to acts likely
to increase the risk of injury to other persons."
The majority wrote that Franklin, an expert on the
writings of Herman Melville, "engages in a pattern of
conduct that constitutes a continual challenge to the
institution: he states that he wishes to encourage violent
and coercive actions, but at the same time not to risk loss
of his position in the University."
The entire text of the bulky decision will be published
in the Daily next week, but an initial summarization
follows.
STANDARDS
The Board noted that "much attention has been paid
by the parties to constitutional questions" raised in the
case. It said that Franklin was granted full Constitutional
protections and that the conduct charged by the
administration was "clearly within the reach of
institutional authority."
The opinion rejected Franklin s argument that the
campus rules under which he was charged were vague
and overbroad." It said that the concepts of "appropriate
function" and "duty" in the tenure policy "do reflect
commonly understood and accepted standards of
conduct, including restraints as well as positive
obligations."
The professor-judges added that "the Policy on
Campus Disruptions provides an explicit though not
exhaustive list of conduct which is proscribed" under the
tenure policy.
Although conceding that more specific faculty rules
could be "a more readily interpretable guide," the Board
said it favored the more flexible "present reliance on
largely unwritten standards."
Discussing appropriate standards to draw the line
between "free speech" and incitement, the Board said a
"vague exhortation is not punishable" but that there need
not "be an exact correspondence between specific acts
advocated and those that follow."
The majority said that "one of the central themes in
the entire case" was the mixture of legal and illegal
actions urged in Franklin's speeches. But the Board said
"the presence of peaceful recommendations cannot

immunize a person from sanctions if he has urged
imminent coercion and violence as well."
The decision also rejected Franklin's contention that
his speeches out of the classroom were "extracurricular"
to his duties as a professor, saying "the speech of a faculty
member to a campus audience on campus issues is subject
to regulation."
LODGE INCIDENT
The Board unanimously found that there was not
"strongly persuasive evidence that Professor Franklin's
shouts triggered the demonstration or that he was
personally guilty of 'significantly contributing' to the
disruption that finally forced the cancellation of the
meeting."
Although Franklin was not shown to be a major
participant, the disruption was sufficient to require
closing the meeting, the Board ruled, adding that heckling
which may be appropriate during "political-picnic
oratory" is not proper at a campus symposium.
The recommendation also rejected Franklin's
contentions that the heckling was justified because Lodge
was a "war criminal" or because Hoover Institution had
sponsored a politically biased conference.
WHITE PLAZA SPEECH
The Board unanimously agreed that Franklin had
incited occupation of the Computation Center during a
noontime rally in White Plaza, Feb. 10. The
recommendation commented that Franklin "gave the
longest and closing speech of the rally." He urged a
"shutdown" of the computer, the report charged,
"knowing that his advocacy of 'shutdown' would be
interpreted by at least a substantial portion of the
audience as calling for forceful disruption of the operation
of the Center. Indeed, we believe that this is what he
meant."
Rejecting Franklin's contention that he was sincerely
urging a "voluntary boycott," the Board said Franklin had
used the labor term "strike" as "a flag in which to wrap a
much broader range of conduct."
The Board said that Franklin "must have reasonably
expected" the occupation of the computer facility and
that "there was a risk of serious damage to the computer
and its users."
The Board rejected Franklin's contention that the
protest was justified because of a war-related project using
the computer center illegally. The professors said Franklin
and other protestors never attempted to use appropriate
channels to challenge the "Gamut-H" project.
DISPERSAL ORDER
The five-man majority found that Franklin "played a
central role in reversing the movement" of demonstrators
outside the Computer Center, inciting them to resist a
police dispersal order.
They said that even if Franklin's objections to the
dispersal order were not directly shouted to the crowd,
"he must reasonably have expected" that a result of his
shouts to police from a substantial distance would be to
incite resistance by demonstrators.
The minority ruled that Franklin's "purpose was to
encourage others to remain" and rejected his contentions
that he was only urging "faculty observers" to stay, that
he spoke only to professors and the police, and that he
was attempting to defuse an imminent charge.
In a dissenting interpretation, Brown and Kennedy
argued that Franklin was, in part, "trying to assert" his

right to "question a police order he [believed)
unreasonable and unlawful."
They said they found it "plausible rather than
difficult" to believe that Franklin was attempting
conciliation even though his "manner of seeking this end
was unwise."
It was clearly possible that he was addressing his
remarks only to police and faculty observer Lincoln
Moses, the dissenters added.
OLD UNION SPEECH
With Kennedy and Brown again dissenting, the
majority ruled that Franklin had incited disruption in a
nighttime speech at the Old Union.
They said Franklin delivered an "intense" speech
during the rally, then delivered another address at the end
of the rally.
According to the majority report, Franklin's reference
to "people's war" suggested a range of actions which "can
clearly include guerilla warfare."
The majority argued that Franklin "came into a
combustive situation, focused hostility on certain targets,
intensified existing hostility toward those targets, and
urged a spectrum of actions against them: some peaceful,
some coercive, some violent."
In their dissents on this charge, Kennedy and Brown
argued that no interpretations of Franklin's speech can be
offered with "a great deal of certainty." They said that
although he may have been advocating "a range of actions
some of which may have been illegal, we do not find the
evidence strongly persuasive that his speech constituted
the advocacy of imminent lawless action."
They charged that punishing such an ambiguous speech

could force faculty members "to guard against possible
cryptic meanings" when speaking during a situation of
"high risk." They warned against "the social cost of such
a prohibition."
SANCTIONS
In choosing a sanction, the majority found that
"rehabilitation" was not a useful concept. "Professor
Franklin's announced convictions about the guilt of the
university appear deeply-held, and his opposition to the
institution in its present form seems implacable."
The majority chose the "deterring" function of a
penalty in the case as a more valid standard than
"rehabilitation."
They added that a lesser penalty than dismissal
"assumes that a satisfactory relationship between
Professor Franklin and the other members of the
university can be re-established."
MINORITY REPORTS
Brown and Kennedy argued that it cannot "be argued

penalty in the case as a more valid standard than
"rehabilitation."
They added that a lesser penalty than dismissal
"assumes that a satisfactory relationship between
Professor Franklin and the other members of the
university can be re-established."
MINORITY REPORTS
Brown and Kennedy argued that it cannot "be argued
conclusively" that penalties other than dismissal would
fail to deter Franklin from "further coercive acts."
Brown and Kennedy said that Franklin was a
"prominent symbol" of the university's "diversity and
challenge."
In his personal dissent, Brown added that "many
aspects of the University need to be changed . . . Albeit in
a harsh and strident manner, Professor Franklin has
helped call attention to many of these realities."
He urged administrators and trustees to "consider once
again" whether "a dismissal penalty does not represent a
higher cost than the University ought to pay."
The faculty Advisory Board
recommended "immediate dismissal"
of professor-revolutionary H. Bruce
Franklin in a 5-2 decision announced
yesterday.
The majority found that "by urging
and inciting to the use of illegal
coercion and violence" Franklin had
"repeatedly and seriously infringed the
rights of others in the University, and
significantly increased the risk of
injury to them and to University
property."
The five senior professors asked
that Franklin's immediate dismissal be
paired with a continuance of his salary
through August so that the "severity"
of the penalty would be "softened
somewhat."
In dissenting opinions, calling for
suspension rather than dismissal,
Board Chairman Donald Kennedy and
Professor Robert McAfee Brown
warned, "We see substantial costs in

Professor Franklin's loss to the
institution; they are measured
externally in the form of corrosive
effects on academic freedom, and
internally in terms of lost challenge
and the subtle inhibition of dissent."
(See excerpts from the decision,
pages 4, 5,6, and 7).
The Board unanimously agreed that
Franklin should be punished for a
February 10 speech in White Plaza.
The majority said he also should be
disciplined for encouraging resistance
to a police dispersal order at the
Computation Center the same day and
for inciting confrontation during an
Old Union rally that night.
Cleared In Lodge Case
But the Board unanimously found
that Franklin had not "significantly
contributed" to the January 11
disruption of a speech by Henry Cabot
Lodge.
The Board's ruling is formally only
a recommendation to President
Richard W. Lyman, although Lyman is
expected to accept the Board's
endorsement of the charges he brought
against Franklin in February.
Lyman said he was considering the
158-page report as "a matter of
highest priority" but will have no
comment on it until he has completed
his study of the recommendations. His
statement is reportedly not expected
until Friday or later. *
Franklin, an Associate Professor of
English and a well-known Maoist
revolutionary, called the decision
"fascist" and said it proved "there is
no such thing as freedom for people
on the left in any college in this
country."
The decision was delivered to
Franklin and the administration at
about 8 a.m. yesterday, ending the
unprecedented three-month-long
consideration of charges against the
tenured faculty activist.
After a six-week hearing, involving
over 100 witnesses, the Board
deliberated almost two months before
releasing its decision.
The majority report said that a penalty lesser than
dismissal "would fail to recognize the fundamental nature
and severity of Professor Franklin's attacks on the
University of which he is a member."
In the dissent, Kennedy urged that Franklin be
suspended for two quarters, without pay during one of
the quarters. Brown urged the administration and Trustees
to reconsider the dismissal recommendation. He said
Franklin should be suspended for one quarter without pay
and should not be dismissed even if all the charges were
sustained.
Brown's dissent voiced his "fear that we may do untold
harm to ourselves and the cause of higher education
unless, by imposing a penalty short of dismissal, we seek
to keep (Franklin) as a very uncomfortable, but very
important part of what this University, or any university,
is meant to be."
But the majority rejected arguments that Franklin's
dismissal would repress dissent. They said, "Our decision
silences neither political dissent nor criticism of the
University. The only speech or behavior repressed by the
Board's finding is that which clearly urges and incites
others to unlawful coercion or violence, or to acts likely
to increase the risk of injury to other persons."
The majority wrote that Franklin, an expert on the
writings of Herman Melville, "engages in a pattern of
conduct that constitutes a continual challenge to the
institution: he states that he wishes to encourage violent
and coercive actions, but at the same time not to risk loss
of his position in the University."
The entire text of the bulky decision will be published
in the Daily next week, but an initial summarization
follows.
STANDARDS
The Board noted that "much attention has been paid
by the parties to constitutional questions" raised in the
case. It said that Franklin was granted full Constitutional
protections and that the conduct charged by the
administration was "clearly within the reach of
institutional authority."
The opinion rejected Franklin s argument that the
campus rules under which he was charged were vague
and overbroad." It said that the concepts of "appropriate
function" and "duty" in the tenure policy "do reflect
commonly understood and accepted standards of
conduct, including restraints as well as positive
obligations."
The professor-judges added that "the Policy on
Campus Disruptions provides an explicit though not
exhaustive list of conduct which is proscribed" under the
tenure policy.
Although conceding that more specific faculty rules
could be "a more readily interpretable guide," the Board
said it favored the more flexible "present reliance on
largely unwritten standards."
Discussing appropriate standards to draw the line
between "free speech" and incitement, the Board said a
"vague exhortation is not punishable" but that there need
not "be an exact correspondence between specific acts
advocated and those that follow."
The majority said that "one of the central themes in
the entire case" was the mixture of legal and illegal
actions urged in Franklin's speeches. But the Board said
"the presence of peaceful recommendations cannot

immunize a person from sanctions if he has urged
imminent coercion and violence as well."
The decision also rejected Franklin's contention that
his speeches out of the classroom were "extracurricular"
to his duties as a professor, saying "the speech of a faculty
member to a campus audience on campus issues is subject
to regulation."
LODGE INCIDENT
The Board unanimously found that there was not
"strongly persuasive evidence that Professor Franklin's
shouts triggered the demonstration or that he was
personally guilty of 'significantly contributing' to the
disruption that finally forced the cancellation of the
meeting."
Although Franklin was not shown to be a major
participant, the disruption was sufficient to require
closing the meeting, the Board ruled, adding that heckling
which may be appropriate during "political-picnic
oratory" is not proper at a campus symposium.
The recommendation also rejected Franklin's
contentions that the heckling was justified because Lodge
was a "war criminal" or because Hoover Institution had
sponsored a politically biased conference.
WHITE PLAZA SPEECH
The Board unanimously agreed that Franklin had
incited occupation of the Computation Center during a
noontime rally in White Plaza, Feb. 10. The
recommendation commented that Franklin "gave the
longest and closing speech of the rally." He urged a
"shutdown" of the computer, the report charged,
"knowing that his advocacy of 'shutdown' would be
interpreted by at least a substantial portion of the
audience as calling for forceful disruption of the operation
of the Center. Indeed, we believe that this is what he
meant."
Rejecting Franklin's contention that he was sincerely
urging a "voluntary boycott," the Board said Franklin had
used the labor term "strike" as "a flag in which to wrap a
much broader range of conduct."
The Board said that Franklin "must have reasonably
expected" the occupation of the computer facility and
that "there was a risk of serious damage to the computer
and its users."
The Board rejected Franklin's contention that the
protest was justified because of a war-related project using
the computer center illegally. The professors said Franklin
and other protestors never attempted to use appropriate
channels to challenge the "Gamut-H" project.
DISPERSAL ORDER
The five-man majority found that Franklin "played a
central role in reversing the movement" of demonstrators
outside the Computer Center, inciting them to resist a
police dispersal order.
They said that even if Franklin's objections to the
dispersal order were not directly shouted to the crowd,
"he must reasonably have expected" that a result of his
shouts to police from a substantial distance would be to
incite resistance by demonstrators.
The minority ruled that Franklin's "purpose was to
encourage others to remain" and rejected his contentions
that he was only urging "faculty observers" to stay, that
he spoke only to professors and the police, and that he
was attempting to defuse an imminent charge.
In a dissenting interpretation, Brown and Kennedy
argued that Franklin was, in part, "trying to assert" his

right to "question a police order he [believed)
unreasonable and unlawful."
They said they found it "plausible rather than
difficult" to believe that Franklin was attempting
conciliation even though his "manner of seeking this end
was unwise."
It was clearly possible that he was addressing his
remarks only to police and faculty observer Lincoln
Moses, the dissenters added.
OLD UNION SPEECH
With Kennedy and Brown again dissenting, the
majority ruled that Franklin had incited disruption in a
nighttime speech at the Old Union.
They said Franklin delivered an "intense" speech
during the rally, then delivered another address at the end
of the rally.
According to the majority report, Franklin's reference
to "people's war" suggested a range of actions which "can
clearly include guerilla warfare."
The majority argued that Franklin "came into a
combustive situation, focused hostility on certain targets,
intensified existing hostility toward those targets, and
urged a spectrum of actions against them: some peaceful,
some coercive, some violent."
In their dissents on this charge, Kennedy and Brown
argued that no interpretations of Franklin's speech can be
offered with "a great deal of certainty." They said that
although he may have been advocating "a range of actions
some of which may have been illegal, we do not find the
evidence strongly persuasive that his speech constituted
the advocacy of imminent lawless action."
They charged that punishing such an ambiguous speech

could force faculty members "to guard against possible
cryptic meanings" when speaking during a situation of
"high risk." They warned against "the social cost of such
a prohibition."
SANCTIONS
In choosing a sanction, the majority found that
"rehabilitation" was not a useful concept. "Professor
Franklin's announced convictions about the guilt of the
university appear deeply-held, and his opposition to the
institution in its present form seems implacable."
The majority chose the "deterring" function of a
penalty in the case as a more valid standard than
"rehabilitation."
They added that a lesser penalty than dismissal
"assumes that a satisfactory relationship between
Professor Franklin and the other members of the
university can be re-established."
MINORITY REPORTS
Brown and Kennedy argued that it cannot "be argued
conclusively" that penalties other than dismissal would
fail to deter Franklin from "further coercive acts."
Brown and Kennedy said that Franklin was a
"prominent symbol" of the university's "diversity and
challenge."
In his personal dissent, Brown added that "many
aspects of the University need to be changed . . . Albeit in
a harsh and strident manner, Professor Franklin has
helped call attention to many of these realities."
He urged administrators and trustees to "consider once
again" whether "a dismissal penalty does not represent a
higher cost than the University ought to pay."
