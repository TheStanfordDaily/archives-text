# Board 5-2 For Dismissal, Kennedy, Brown Dissent
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
The faculty Advisory Board
recommended "immediate dismissal"
of professor-revolutionary H. Bruce
Franklin in a 5-2 decision announced
yesterday.
The majority found that "by urging
and inciting to the use of illegal
coercion and violence" Franklin had
"repeatedly and seriously infringed the
rights of others in the University, and
significantly increased the risk of
injury to them and to University
property."
The five senior professors asked
that Franklin's immediate dismissal be
paired with a continuance of his salary
through August so that the "severity"
of the penalty would be "softened
somewhat."
In dissenting opinions, calling for
suspension rather than dismissal,
Board Chairman Donald Kennedy and
Professor Robert McAfee Brown
warned, "We see substantial costs in

Professor Franklin's loss to the
institution; they are measured
externally in the form of corrosive
effects on academic freedom, and
internally in terms of lost challenge
and the subtle inhibition of dissent."
(See excerpts from the decision,
pages 4, 5,6, and 7).
The Board unanimously agreed that
Franklin should be punished for a
February 10 speech in White Plaza.
The majority said he also should be
disciplined for encouraging resistance
to a police dispersal order at the
Computation Center the same day and
for inciting confrontation during an
Old Union rally that night.
Cleared In Lodge Case
But the Board unanimously found
that Franklin had not "significantly
contributed" to the January 11
disruption of a speech by Henry Cabot
Lodge.
The Board's ruling is formally only
a recommendation to President
Richard W. Lyman, although Lyman is
expected to accept the Board's
endorsement of the charges he brought
against Franklin in February.
Lyman said he was considering the
158-page report as "a matter of
highest priority" but will have no
comment on it until he has completed
his study of the recommendations. His
statement is reportedly not expected
until Friday or later. *
Franklin, an Associate Professor of
English and a well-known Maoist
revolutionary, called the decision
"fascist" and said it proved "there is
no such thing as freedom for people
on the left in any college in this
country."
The decision was delivered to
Franklin and the administration at
about 8 a.m. yesterday, ending the
unprecedented three-month-long
consideration of charges against the
tenured faculty activist.
After a six-week hearing, involving
over 100 witnesses, the Board
deliberated almost two months before
releasing its decision.
