# Franklin's Reaction: 'We're Not Surprised'
## 
### JON DEDMON 
At a crowded 1 p.m. press
conference in Venceremos
headquarters yesterday, Bruce
Franklin said that whatever happens
on the Stanford campus in response to
his firing "is not enough."
"Stanford is a very violent place
and there has to be revolutionary
counter-violence," he said.
When asked if campus violence
might break out as a result of his
dismissal, Franklin commented, "I
hope so."
Throughout the conference, his
wife Jane stood by his side with a rifle
she said was unloaded.
With his usual smile and intense air,
Franklin told newsmen crowded into
the dirty white backroom of his
revolutionary group's headquarters on
University Avenue in E. Palo Alto that
"we were basically not surprised" at
the Advisory Board's decision he be
fired.
"We knew we only had two things
going for us," the Marxist scholar said,
"the fact that the administration had
no case and our mass support."
'Fascist Document'
Franklin, dressed in a black leather
jacket and blue Levis charged that the
Board "had point by point ignored the
evidence presented"and that the
150-odd pages of findings were a
"Fascist document in liberal form."
"There are absolute lies on almost
every page," he said.
He later added however, that
Professors Donald Kennedy and
Robert MacAffee Brown, who voted
against firing him, "were at least
honest about the facts."
But Franklin said that although the
hearing was a short term victory for
repression, it was actually a "roaring
success" since it "brought a lot of
things out from under the rocks and
rugs."
Franklin said that the Board's
findings "show our analysis to be
correct" that there is "no free speech
or 'academic community' at Stanford
or anywhere in the country."
Earlier he told the Daily, "We
provided a political ideology and
people translated it into action. It's

those ideas that were dangerous."
Franklin quoted from a sentence in
the Advisory Board decision saying
that "we are highly dubious whether
rehabilitation is a useful concept in
this case." Franklin said, "They are
absolutely right. We hope that there is
no hope that I can be rehabilitated to
become a liberal fascist like they are."
Disrupt Dornbusch
In an interview with KZSU
yesterday, Franklin said that if he
were a student and disagreed with the
board's decision, he would "join with
two or three or four of my friends and
I would go into Sandy Dornbusch's
class and disrupt that class" and find
out why he has a right to teach when
Franklin can't. He advocated
disrupting the classes of all Advisory
Board members who voted for his
firing.
Following Franklin's comments,
Pierre Noyes, a professor at SLAC,
read a statement from the Faculty
Political Action Group which stated,
"We are outraged by the
recommendation to fire Professor
Franklin. This repressive political act
must be resisted. Now is the time to
stand up for freedom and protest that
genocide in Asia."
Joel Klein, who helped with the
Franklin defense, commented on the
decision, "They claimed to give First
Amendment protection, then they
found against him. If he had said those
speeches in Central Park, every one of
them would have been protected by
the First Amendment."
Although University officials and
members of the Advisory Board
refused to comment on the decision,
in Los Angeles, Raymond Fisher, who
represented the administration, said
that "it's always gratifying to win a
decision you've worked hard for. 1
think it's unfortunate that Bruce got
himself in the position he did. I
certainly feel that Bruce was a very
intelligent and remarkable person."
However, Fisher said, "to the
extent that he threatened the
institution by the conduct that he
engaged in, clearly the University will
be better off without that kind of
agitation and disruption."

no case and our mass support."
'Fascist Document'
Franklin, dressed in a black leather
jacket and blue Levis charged that the
Board "had point by point ignored the
evidence presented"and that the
150-odd pages of findings were a
"Fascist document in liberal form."
"There are absolute lies on almost
every page," he said.
He later added however, that
Professors Donald Kennedy and
Robert MacAffee Brown, who voted
against firing him, "were at least
honest about the facts."
But Franklin said that although the
hearing was a short term victory for
repression, it was actually a "roaring
success" since it "brought a lot of
things out from under the rocks and
rugs."
Franklin said that the Board's
findings "show our analysis to be
correct" that there is "no free speech
or 'academic community' at Stanford
or anywhere in the country."
Earlier he told the Daily, "We
provided a political ideology and
people translated it into action. It's

those ideas that were dangerous."
Franklin quoted from a sentence in
the Advisory Board decision saying
that "we are highly dubious whether
rehabilitation is a useful concept in
this case." Franklin said, "They are
absolutely right. We hope that there is
no hope that I can be rehabilitated to
become a liberal fascist like they are."
Disrupt Dornbusch
In an interview with KZSU
yesterday, Franklin said that if he
were a student and disagreed with the
board's decision, he would "join with
two or three or four of my friends and
I would go into Sandy Dornbusch's
class and disrupt that class" and find
out why he has a right to teach when
Franklin can't. He advocated
disrupting the classes of all Advisory
Board members who voted for his
firing.
Following Franklin's comments,
Pierre Noyes, a professor at SLAC,
read a statement from the Faculty
Political Action Group which stated,
"We are outraged by the
recommendation to fire Professor
Franklin. This repressive political act
must be resisted. Now is the time to
stand up for freedom and protest that
genocide in Asia."
Joel Klein, who helped with the
Franklin defense, commented on the
decision, "They claimed to give First
Amendment protection, then they
found against him. If he had said those
speeches in Central Park, every one of
them would have been protected by
the First Amendment."
Although University officials and
members of the Advisory Board
refused to comment on the decision,
in Los Angeles, Raymond Fisher, who
represented the administration, said
that "it's always gratifying to win a
decision you've worked hard for. 1
think it's unfortunate that Bruce got
himself in the position he did. I
certainly feel that Bruce was a very
intelligent and remarkable person."
However, Fisher said, "to the
extent that he threatened the
institution by the conduct that he
engaged in, clearly the University will
be better off without that kind of
agitation and disruption."
At a crowded 1 p.m. press
conference in Venceremos
headquarters yesterday, Bruce
Franklin said that whatever happens
on the Stanford campus in response to
his firing "is not enough."
"Stanford is a very violent place
and there has to be revolutionary
counter-violence," he said.
When asked if campus violence
might break out as a result of his
dismissal, Franklin commented, "I
hope so."
Throughout the conference, his
wife Jane stood by his side with a rifle
she said was unloaded.
With his usual smile and intense air,
Franklin told newsmen crowded into
the dirty white backroom of his
revolutionary group's headquarters on
University Avenue in E. Palo Alto that
"we were basically not surprised" at
the Advisory Board's decision he be
fired.
"We knew we only had two things
going for us," the Marxist scholar said,
"the fact that the administration had
no case and our mass support."
