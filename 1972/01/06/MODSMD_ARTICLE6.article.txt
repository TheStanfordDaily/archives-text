## Outrageous Decision 
### 
The Advisory Board decision
recommending the firing of H. Bruce
Franklin is outrageous. The decision ignores
many factual matters brought up during
Franklin's defense and brings into sharp
focus the inadequacy of the decision making
process in the University as it is now
constituted.
The decision seems to leave no avenue
open for peaceful redress. Franklin has been
fired. This decision was made with no
student input, even though Franklin was a
competent and popular professor whose
firing deprives students ot a stimulating
intellectual alternative.
We regard the decision as unjust and as
dangerous to the entire community. Since
students were not included in the process
which led to Franklin's firing, they cannot
be asked to "work within the system" to try
to change the decision; yet violent action
will not get Franklin his job back, and will
aggravate an already tense situation.
It would be easy to quietly accept
student lack of power in this situation, and
let Franklin be quietly disposed of, after an
allegedly fair and impartial hearing. This is
not acceptable. The community must decide
on a response to tell the administration that
this decision will not be quietly accepted,
and that the dangerous precedent this case
sets will not be acceptable in the future.
The Board finds Franklin guilty of the
three charges dealing with speech, and finds
him not guilty of the charge dealing with
actions. We feel that the
evidence cited by the majority ot the Board
in reaching their decision does not prove
that Franklin's speech fell outside the vital
protected area of acceptable speech.
We feel that the administration never
proved, and the Board cited no such proof,
that Franklin's speeches were the causal
factor in the resulting actions at the
computation center, and at various locations
following the Old Union rally.
After reading the decision we feel that
political, rather than legal, questions were
the determining factor in the Board's
decision. Franklin is an outspoken,
sometimes "impolite" Maoist, a fact which
ideally should not have affected a decision
based solely on the merits of the evidence.
The evidence cited in the decision does not
seem to justify the penalty, so we are forced
to conclude that narrow political
perceptions entered into the Board's
deliberations.
This conclusion is the most frightening of
all. As Professors Brown and Kennedy
pointed out in their dissenting opinion,
"Because we live in a society in which there
are increasing public pressures to curb
dissident speech and action, the University
has a special responsibility to insulate its
procedures from such influences . . . The
University is obliged to tolerate a great deal
of what it does not like. We see substantial
costs in Professor Franklin's loss to the
institution; they are measured externally in
the form of corrosive effects on academic

freedom, and internally in terms of lost
challenge and the subtle inhibition of
dissent."
Professor Brown correctly assesses the
political nature of the dismissal when he
argues in an additional minority report that
"while we can properly demand, by a severe
penalty, that Professor Franklin's speech
and action not circumscribe the rights of
others, we must recognize that the penalty
of dismissal would deny him a chance to
apply his own perception of reality within
boundaries of permissable conduct that may
now be clearer to him."
This recognition that Franklin's
perception of reality differs from those of
the members of the Board is central to an
understanding of the decision. The Board
states that "we are dubious whether
rehabilitation is a useful concept in this
case. Professor Franklin's announced
convictions about the guilt of the University
appear deeply held, and his opposition to
the institution in its present form seems
implacable . . ." When taken in context this
statement indicates that the rehabilitation
the Board seeks is political. To expect such
a "rehabilitation" is a dangerous and chilling
precedent.
The very use of the word
"rehabilitation" by the Board indicates that
they feel that Franklin's world view is
somehow sick and needs to be cured, a
sentiment which should in no way have
interfered with their judgement of the facts.
At a time when the University is a last
vestige of broadly based freedoms, a
decision which narrows, rather than
broadens speeches totally unacceptable.
