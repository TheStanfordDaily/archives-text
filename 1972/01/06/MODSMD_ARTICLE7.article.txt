Franklin Reaction
Editor, THE DAILY:
I will be leaving Stanford at the end of
this year, and while at one time this
prospect caused me some pain, I now
anticipate my departure.
Coming on the heels of the various SRI
machinations and the repressive response
to the hospital sit-in, the firing of Professor
Bruce Franklin demonstrates beyond a
reasonable doubt the moral and ethical
poverty of Stanford University.
The faculty, as represented by the
Advisory Board, has shown that its
committment to academic freedom
extends only to those who agree, or to
those who do not voice their
disagreements. A man like Franklin, who
passionately and vigorously raised critical
questions about the role of the university
and the social uses of knowledge, was
rightly perceived as a threat by men whose
prime motivation is either the pursuit of
professional honors, or the serving of
power and wealth.
To these men, Franklin will not be
missed. To others of us, some faculty but
mainly students, his loss is devastating. We
must pledge ourselves to the continuation

of the critical tradition of Thorstein
Veblen, C. Wright Mills, Paul Baron and
Bruce Franklin, all of whom dared to
think, to question, to learn and to protest,
and all of whom were denied honor,
consideration and courtesy by their faculty
peers.

Lenny Siegel's contributions used to be
funny; now they are pathetic.
Ralph J. Smith
(Ralph Smith identifies himself as "a
professor in the infamous Electrical
Engineering Department. Although his
name does not appear on any DOD
contracts, he is known to support his
colleagues who do such work. He is a
glib-tongued lecturer who has recruited
many beginning students to engineering.
Furthermore, he is an ex-Dean of
Engineering at San Jose State and probably
hopes to be restored to power.")
