# Spain: Europe's Friendly Police State
## 
### 
TOURS, France-While of late
attention has been focused on
other European nations and
leaders — the presidential
elections in Italy, the continuing
political successes of Messrs.
Brandt and Pompidou, and the
economic struggles within and
without the European Common
Market — Spain is one country
that has suffered from a severe
case of "benign neglect" in the
world's press.
Spain is a beautiful and
outwardly prosperous country.
Her people are at times
easy-going, at times passionate,
but always genteel. Her food and

drink enjoy a well-deserved
international reputation, as does
her culture.
But Spain is also about the
closest one can come to finding a
true police state in Western
Europe: strikes, for example, are
illegal, and their organizers are
subject to harsh punishments.
Spain is ruled over by the aging

Generalissimo Francisco Franco,
who for 35 years has walked a
perilous tight-wire between his
country's strong military and the
Roman Catholic Church. When
Franco dies, his designated heir,
Prince Don Carlos, will take over.
While outwardly tranquil,
Spain can be a frightening country
to visit. While the Spanish people
are generally out-going, they
usually refuse to discuss politics.
University professors won't
comment publicly on the current
political situation, or criticize
Franco or his regime, fearing the
dictator's reprisals.
Even to an outsider, there
seems to be some justification for
all this fear.
As one drives down the
Spanish coast, one notices
tremendous numbers of the
Guardia Civil, the equivalent of
the national police in most
European nations, posted at
frequent intervals along the
highway. They inevitably travel in
pairs on powerful motorcycles.
When they park beside the
highway, one faces his motorcycle
northbound, while his companion,
across the road, faces southbound.
They sit on their bikes and
watch the traffic flow by for a

while and then, for no apparent
reason, zoom off after some
unsuspecting driver. No one we
saw stopped during a recent
five-day trip along the Costa Brava
had committed an obvious traffic
violation. Foreigners also, have
reason to fear the Guardia Civil,
for they can jail anyone for the
slightest offense. Spaniards

involved in auto accidents
practically tremble at the thought
of calling in the police.
But the aura of fear runs much
deeper than that. The Catholic
Church, which in Spain can hardly
be accused of promoting social
ferment, recently condemned the
Franco regime for having
subjected Spain to a "false peace"
based on "force and repression"
since his regime assumed power
after the 1936-39 Civil War.
Issued in mid-December by the
National Committee on Justice
and Peace, the report (entitled "If
You Want Peace, Work for
Justice") is considered to be an
accurate reflection of most
Spanish priests' and bishops'
feelings.
The Ministry of Information
and Tourism — which effectively
controls the Spanish press (and
indeed recently closed Madrid,
one of the capital's newspapers,
and forced its editor, an admitted
monarchist who fought for
Franco during the Civil War, into
exile) — ordered newspapers not
to publicize the report because it
constituted "illegal propaganda".
However, about 10,000 copies of
the report were distributed
throughout Spain, and many

priests read excerpts during
Sunday services.
The report warns of new civil
war unless the government finds
ways to grant social justice and
create "the climate of dialogue
necessary to solve our problems."
It also criticized the Franco
administration's plan of creating a
"consumer society" before
granting any political and social
freedoms. "More and bigger
material goods" is too high a price
to pay for the "depolitization of
the citizenry and a voiceless
public opinion," the report states.
But perhaps the most serious
reports of police and
governmental repression that have
surfaced recently have been those
dealing with Pedro Patino, a
33-year old stonemason, who
apparently was shot to death by a
member of the Guardia Civil as he
was handing out leaflets
supporting a building workers'
strike.
According to eyewitness
accounts, Patino and three other
building workers were walking
along a highway near Madrid in
September when they heard a
police van pull up. The continued
walking. When without warning
the police clicked off the safety
catches on their carbines, the four
stopped. The policemen started
walking towards the group; opje
guard, who had been holding hts
gun horizontally, discharged H,
killing Patino.
Patino was carried to the police
van and died before he reached a
hospital.
Details of this incident are just
now becoming known, due to the
efforts of a Madrid attorney, who,
like the exiled newspaper editor,
fought for Franco during the Civil
War. (Spanish newspapers have
been forbidden to publicize or
comment on Patino's killing.)
The police report on the
incident was issued about 12
hours after Patino was
pronounced dead: it said Patino
was killed when he fought with a
guard and the gun went off. The
statement noted that Patino had
been arrested for pro-communist
activities two years ago, but had
been acquitted.
There were other remarkable
aspects of Pedro Patino's death:
no family-chosen doctors were
permitted to view the autopsy; his
bullet-pierced clothing was
immediately burned in the
hospital's incinerator; and the
record of his death contains at
least three errors, including the
cause of death (gunshot wounds
are not mentioned) and the time
of the shooting.
Patino, however, was not
alone: at least seven other workers
— many of them involved in labor
movements or attempted strikes —
have been shot and killed by the
Spanish police during the past two
years.

subjected Spain to a "false peace"
based on "force and repression"
since his regime assumed power
after the 1936-39 Civil War.
Issued in mid-December by the
National Committee on Justice
and Peace, the report (entitled "If
You Want Peace, Work for
Justice") is considered to be an
accurate reflection of most
Spanish priests' and bishops'
feelings.
The Ministry of Information
and Tourism — which effectively
controls the Spanish press (and
indeed recently closed Madrid,
one of the capital's newspapers,
and forced its editor, an admitted
monarchist who fought for
Franco during the Civil War, into
exile) — ordered newspapers not
to publicize the report because it
constituted "illegal propaganda".
However, about 10,000 copies of
the report were distributed
throughout Spain, and many

priests read excerpts during
Sunday services.
The report warns of new civil
war unless the government finds
ways to grant social justice and
create "the climate of dialogue
necessary to solve our problems."
It also criticized the Franco
administration's plan of creating a
"consumer society" before
granting any political and social
freedoms. "More and bigger
material goods" is too high a price
to pay for the "depolitization of
the citizenry and a voiceless
public opinion," the report states.
But perhaps the most serious
reports of police and
governmental repression that have
surfaced recently have been those
dealing with Pedro Patino, a
33-year old stonemason, who
apparently was shot to death by a
member of the Guardia Civil as he
was handing out leaflets
supporting a building workers'
strike.
According to eyewitness
accounts, Patino and three other
building workers were walking
along a highway near Madrid in
September when they heard a
police van pull up. The continued
walking. When without warning
the police clicked off the safety
catches on their carbines, the four
stopped. The policemen started
walking towards the group; opje
guard, who had been holding hts
gun horizontally, discharged H,
killing Patino.
Patino was carried to the police
van and died before he reached a
hospital.
Details of this incident are just
now becoming known, due to the
efforts of a Madrid attorney, who,
like the exiled newspaper editor,
fought for Franco during the Civil
War. (Spanish newspapers have
been forbidden to publicize or
comment on Patino's killing.)
The police report on the
incident was issued about 12
hours after Patino was
pronounced dead: it said Patino
was killed when he fought with a
guard and the gun went off. The
statement noted that Patino had
been arrested for pro-communist
activities two years ago, but had
been acquitted.
There were other remarkable
aspects of Pedro Patino's death:
no family-chosen doctors were
permitted to view the autopsy; his
bullet-pierced clothing was
immediately burned in the
hospital's incinerator; and the
record of his death contains at
least three errors, including the
cause of death (gunshot wounds
are not mentioned) and the time
of the shooting.
Patino, however, was not
alone: at least seven other workers
— many of them involved in labor
movements or attempted strikes —
have been shot and killed by the
Spanish police during the past two
years.

TOURS, France-While of late
attention has been focused on
other European nations and
leaders — the presidential
elections in Italy, the continuing
political successes of Messrs.
Brandt and Pompidou, and the
economic struggles within and
without the European Common
Market — Spain is one country
that has suffered from a severe
case of "benign neglect" in the
world's press.
Spain is a beautiful and
outwardly prosperous country.
Her people are at times
easy-going, at times passionate,
but always genteel. Her food and

drink enjoy a well-deserved
international reputation, as does
her culture.
But Spain is also about the
closest one can come to finding a
true police state in Western
Europe: strikes, for example, are
illegal, and their organizers are
subject to harsh punishments.
Spain is ruled over by the aging

Generalissimo Francisco Franco,
who for 35 years has walked a
perilous tight-wire between his
country's strong military and the
Roman Catholic Church. When
Franco dies, his designated heir,
Prince Don Carlos, will take over.
While outwardly tranquil,
Spain can be a frightening country
to visit. While the Spanish people
are generally out-going, they
usually refuse to discuss politics.
University professors won't
comment publicly on the current
political situation, or criticize
Franco or his regime, fearing the
dictator's reprisals.
Even to an outsider, there
seems to be some justification for
all this fear.
As one drives down the
Spanish coast, one notices
tremendous numbers of the
Guardia Civil, the equivalent of
the national police in most
European nations, posted at
frequent intervals along the
highway. They inevitably travel in
pairs on powerful motorcycles.
When they park beside the
highway, one faces his motorcycle
northbound, while his companion,
across the road, faces southbound.
They sit on their bikes and
watch the traffic flow by for a

while and then, for no apparent
reason, zoom off after some
unsuspecting driver. No one we
saw stopped during a recent
five-day trip along the Costa Brava
had committed an obvious traffic
violation. Foreigners also, have
reason to fear the Guardia Civil,
for they can jail anyone for the
slightest offense. Spaniards

was killed when he fought with a
guard and the gun went off. The
statement noted that Patino had
been arrested for pro-communist
activities two years ago, but had
been acquitted.
There were other remarkable
aspects of Pedro Patino's death:
no family-chosen doctors were
permitted to view the autopsy; his
bullet-pierced clothing was
immediately burned in the
hospital's incinerator; and the
record of his death contains at
least three errors, including the
cause of death (gunshot wounds
are not mentioned) and the time
of the shooting.
Patino, however, was not
alone: at least seven other workers
— many of them involved in labor
movements or attempted strikes —
have been shot and killed by the
Spanish police during the past two
years.

TOURS, France-While of late
attention has been focused on
other European nations and
leaders — the presidential
elections in Italy, the continuing
political successes of Messrs.
Brandt and Pompidou, and the
economic struggles within and
without the European Common
Market — Spain is one country
that has suffered from a severe
case of "benign neglect" in the
world's press.
Spain is a beautiful and
outwardly prosperous country.
Her people are at times
easy-going, at times passionate,
but always genteel. Her food and

drink enjoy a well-deserved
international reputation, as does
her culture.
But Spain is also about the
closest one can come to finding a
true police state in Western
Europe: strikes, for example, are
illegal, and their organizers are
subject to harsh punishments.
Spain is ruled over by the aging

Generalissimo Francisco Franco,
who for 35 years has walked a
perilous tight-wire between his
country's strong military and the
Roman Catholic Church. When
Franco dies, his designated heir,
Prince Don Carlos, will take over.
While outwardly tranquil,
Spain can be a frightening country
to visit. While the Spanish people
are generally out-going, they
usually refuse to discuss politics.
University professors won't
comment publicly on the current
political situation, or criticize
Franco or his regime, fearing the
dictator's reprisals.
Even to an outsider, there
seems to be some justification for
all this fear.
As one drives down the
Spanish coast, one notices
tremendous numbers of the
Guardia Civil, the equivalent of
the national police in most
European nations, posted at
frequent intervals along the
highway. They inevitably travel in
pairs on powerful motorcycles.
When they park beside the
highway, one faces his motorcycle
northbound, while his companion,
across the road, faces southbound.
They sit on their bikes and
watch the traffic flow by for a

while and then, for no apparent
reason, zoom off after some
unsuspecting driver. No one we
saw stopped during a recent
five-day trip along the Costa Brava
had committed an obvious traffic
violation. Foreigners also, have
reason to fear the Guardia Civil,
for they can jail anyone for the
slightest offense. Spaniards

j trfr fin

involved in auto accidents
practically tremble at the thought
of calling in the police.
But the aura of fear runs much
deeper than that. The Catholic
Church, which in Spain can hardly
be accused of promoting social
ferment, recently condemned the
Franco regime for having
subjected Spain to a "false peace"
based on "force and repression"
since his regime assumed power
after the 1936-39 Civil War.
Issued in mid-December by the
National Committee on Justice
and Peace, the report (entitled "If
You Want Peace, Work for
Justice") is considered to be an
accurate reflection of most
Spanish priests' and bishops'
feelings.
The Ministry of Information
and Tourism — which effectively
controls the Spanish press (and
indeed recently closed Madrid,
one of the capital's newspapers,
and forced its editor, an admitted
monarchist who fought for
Franco during the Civil War, into
exile) — ordered newspapers not
to publicize the report because it
constituted "illegal propaganda".
However, about 10,000 copies of
the report were distributed
throughout Spain, and many

priests read excerpts during
Sunday services.
The report warns of new civil
war unless the government finds
ways to grant social justice and
create "the climate of dialogue
necessary to solve our problems."
It also criticized the Franco
administration's plan of creating a
"consumer society" before
granting any political and social
freedoms. "More and bigger
material goods" is too high a price
to pay for the "depolitization of
the citizenry and a voiceless
public opinion," the report states.
But perhaps the most serious
reports of police and
governmental repression that have
surfaced recently have been those
dealing with Pedro Patino, a
33-year old stonemason, who
apparently was shot to death by a
member of the Guardia Civil as he
was handing out leaflets
supporting a building workers'
strike.
According to eyewitness
accounts, Patino and three other
building workers were walking
along a highway near Madrid in
September when they heard a
police van pull up. The continued
walking. When without warning
the police clicked off the safety
catches on their carbines, the four
stopped. The policemen started
walking towards the group; opje
guard, who had been holding hts
gun horizontally, discharged H,
killing Patino.
Patino was carried to the police
van and died before he reached a
hospital.
Details of this incident are just
now becoming known, due to the
efforts of a Madrid attorney, who,
like the exiled newspaper editor,
fought for Franco during the Civil
War. (Spanish newspapers have
been forbidden to publicize or
comment on Patino's killing.)
The police report on the
incident was issued about 12
hours after Patino was
pronounced dead: it said Patino
was killed when he fought with a
guard and the gun went off. The
statement noted that Patino had
been arrested for pro-communist
activities two years ago, but had
been acquitted.
There were other remarkable
