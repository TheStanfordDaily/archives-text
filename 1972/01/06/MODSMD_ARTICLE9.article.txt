### 
Following is the text of a statement of principles concerning research, adopted
by the Senate of the Academic Council Thursday, Dec. 16, by divided voice vote:
"The transmission of knowledge and conduct of scholarly inquiry are central
and complementary functions of the University. They can be carried out effectively
only if scholars are guaranteed certain freedoms and accept corresponding responsi
bilities. The Senate of the Academic Council of Stanford University hereby affirms
the following principles concerning research:
"The individual scholar should be free to select the subject matter of his or her
lesearch, to seek support from any source for his work, and to form his or her own
findings and conclusions. These findings and conclusions should be available lor
scrutiny and criticism as required by the University's Policy Guidelines on Secrecy
in Research.
"Research techniques should not violate established professional ethics per
taining to the health, safety, privacy, and other personal rights of human beings or
to the infliction of injury or pain on animals.
"The University should foster an environment conducive to research. Where,
because of limited resources, the University cannot support all research demands, it
should allocate space, facilities, funds, and other resources for research programs
based on the scholarly and educational merits of the proposed research, and not on
speculations concerning the political or moral impropriety of the uses which might
be made of its results.
"The above principles circumscribe the University's role with respect to Univer
sity-connected research. They in no way diminish, and indeed they reinforce, the
individual researcher's personal responsibility to assure that the sources of funding
for his or her research, and its perceived applications, are consistent with his or her
own judgment and conscience."
