# 400 March For Franklin
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
Over 400 people marched from a
White Plaza rally to various campus
buildings yesterday, ending up in front
of the locked President's office as
reaction to the firing of H. Bruce
Franklin continued.
Late in the afternoon, Provost
William Miller announced that today's
scheduled Academic Council meeting
had been postponed until later in the
quarter. Although speakers at the rally
had singled out the meeting as a target
for protest, the administration said
that the meeting was postponed due to
President Lyman's illness.
Professor Raymond Giraud,
chairman of the French and Italian
Departments, told the rally that the
Faculty Political Action Group was
"waging a national campaign" to pick
up support—both financial and
moral—for a civil suit to force
Franklin's reinstatement. English
Associate Professor Ron Rebholz said
that Franklin needed $20,000 in legal
aid.
Franklin hasn't actually been fired
yet, but President Richard Lyman is

expected to accept the Advisory
Board's findings, since he was the one
who brought the charges against
Franklin in the first place.
Lyman, home in bed with the flu, is
studying the decision as is his
vice-provost, Robert Rosenzweig.
Rosenzweig said he has read the report
through once, and is in the process of
going over it again. He said Lyman's
reply probably would not be lengthy.
Explanation
Rosenzweig, explaining to reporters
earlier in the afternoon why the
Academic Council meeting might be
called off, said that the main reason
was that "the president is sick." But
he added that "there really isn't
anything on the agenda." And the
possibility of a confrontation with
Franklin supporters was a
"consideration."
The pro-Franklin group said they
would meet at Dinkelspiel Auditorium
today at 4:00 p.m. anyway to discuss
what further action to take. The
Academic Council was to have met
there at that time.
The angriest statement yet in
response to the Advisory Board's
158-page report came from the
Political Science Graduate Students
Association (PSGSA).
Unanimously Approved
The statement, unanimously
approved by 34 members of the
PSGSA at a meeting yesterday noon,
added: "The Advisory Board has
demonstrated conclusively that the
University's oft-cited defense of
political and intellectual liberty is a
facade ... It is the Advisory
Board—not Venceremos—that has
repudiated academic freedom and
freedom of speech on this campus."
Franklin himself said that the
statement was "right on. In the
struggle within the University we'll
take this trade any day—one old
revolutionary English professor for 34
young revolutionary graduate students
in political science."
The English Review Club issued a
statement claiming the decision was
"totally unjustified by the evidence
presented in the case. We feel that his
recommended firing is an act of
political intimidation directly affecting
our present situation as teachers at
Stanford and our futures as American
academics." (The text of the political
science and English students'
announcements can be found on page
two of today's Daily.)
Young Crows Petition
Meanwhile, the Young Crows were
passing around petitions urging the
rehiring of Franklin. "Everyone
opposes the war, it seems, but to do
anything about it brings down the
wrath of the Trustees, and
administration, and now the majority
of the Advisory Board," it read.
The White Plaza rally began at
12:10 p.m. with a speech by Giraud,
who, after making his announcement
of the legal aid fund, urged students to
"continue to press for a reversal of the
decision of the Advisory Board
regarding Bruce Franklin. It is an

unjust one that should be changed."
He said the decision will "incite
timidity if not fear" in faculty
members who will "fear the loss of
their jobs because, like Professor
Franklin, they have spoken up at a
public meeting."
No Law
"The Advisory Board has
recommended that Franklin be fired
for crimes that don't violate laws of
this land," charged Rebholz, who
spoke next. "If they had the evidence,
they would have had the District
Attorney filing charges. They couldn't
do it because they didn't have the
evidence. So Franklin is being tried
under some other standard more
'refined' than a court of law."
Venceremos member Geri Foote
then took the mike and said, "I think
we should take a walk on campus, and
maybe we stop somewhere, and maybe
stay a long time and make our
presence know. Use your
imagination."
Siegel, Kahn Speak
History Professor Hal Kahn urged
students to go to the then-scheduled
Academic Council meeting—"to show
them that we're unrehabilitated"~and
Lenny Siegel of the Pacific Studies
Center said, "If I heard over the radio
there was a sit-in, it's something that I
would enjoy." Two or three other
speakers advocated some sort of sit-in;
a couple spoke against it. Hospital
worker John Dolly's suggestion that
the marchers "build towards
something big" with a march finally
won approval.
About 400 of the demonstrators
marched—slowly and, except for an
occasional chant, quietly—past the
Engineering School, Skilling
Auditorium, the Physics tank, and the
Hansen Lab with periodic stops for
Lenny Siegel to comment on war
research taking place at those
locations. They went to the
Computation Center to hear another
brief talk by Siegel, and then turned
around and went to Lyman's office.
Young Crows Paul Loeb and Steve
Downey tried to get into the office to
speak to someone, but Lyman's staff
locked the door when they saw the
marchers coming, and efforts to signal
presidential assistant John Schwartz
through a window were to no avail.
"This says a lot for Stanford's
supposedly open channels of
communication," Loeb shouted
through a bullhorn. The
marchers—about 200 strong
now—clapped rhythmically for a
minute or two, then listened to a plea
for "people's war" by Geri Foote.
"People should break down into
small groups and do the kinds of
things we've been talking about
around here for a long time. Decide
what you want to do and do it. Bruce
talked one time about 'people's
war'—that you go out, you organize
people and you do it."
The marchers then broke up after a
final speaker told them to go back to
the dorms and organize for action
today.

ON THE MOVE—Over four hundred marchers parade through the campus protesting the Advisory Board
recommendation that H. Bruce Franklin be fired and Stanford's involvement in the war in Asia. The march followed a
noon rally in White Plaza and visited such spots as the Hansen Labs, Engineering corner and the Computation Center,
scene of last year's police confrontation. The march ended at President Lyman's office with a decision to meet this
afternoon at Dinkelspiel Auditorium. The Academic Council will not be meeting today.
