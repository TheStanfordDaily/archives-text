Office.
A. CHARGES
The relevant University charges concerning the Lodge
incident are contained in Paragraphs 6 and 7 of the
Statement of Charges dated March 22, 1971. These
paragraphs read as follows:
6. On January 11, 1971, Drs. Campbell-and Tomp
kins and Ambassador Lodge attempted to proceed
with the scheduled program at Dinkelspiel Auditor
ium but were prevented from doing so by disruptive
conduct by various people in the audience. The
disruptive conduct included, among other things,
loud shouting, chanting and clapping. Because of the
disruptive conduct the audience was often unable to
hear the words of the speakers, Ambassador Lodge
was prevented from delivering his speech, and the
scheduled program had to be cancelled.
7. Professor Franklin was in the audience and
knowingly and intentionally participated in the
disruptive conduct specified in paragraph 6, signifi
cantly contributing thereby to the disruption which
prevented Ambassador Lodge from speaking and
which forced the cancellation of the program. Ambas
sador Lodge and Drs. Campbell and Tompkins were
thus denied their rightful opportunity to be heard,
and members of the audience were denied their
rightful opportunity to hear and to assemble peace
fully.
B. RESPONSE TO PARAGRAPH 6
Paragraph 6 does not connect Professor Franklin with
the events cited, and therefore his personal culpability is
in no way demonstrated if the Board sustains the
correctness of this paragraph. However the defense and
the University Administration both introduced extensive
evidence and argument dealing with the Lodge incident
per se, and the Board is responding to this material.
1) Description of the Incident
It is incontestable from the tape recording that
"disruptive conduct," including "loud shouting,
chanting and clapping" occurred during the Dinkelspiel
program of January 11, 1971, and that at least part ot
the "audience was often unable to hear the words of the
speakers." Dr. Campbell was able to complete his pre
pared speech with only occasional interruptions and
catcalls. On one occasion he asked for quiet, on other
occasions he acknowledged the noise of the audience
with brief pauses, and at one point he commented on it
specifically. Dr. Tompkins engaged in several exchanges
with the audience, one specifically involving Professor
Franklin; there was increased noise, including interplay
among members of the audience, but Dr. Tompkins was
able to complete his introduction of Ambassador Lodge.
From the moment Mr. Lodge took the podium,
however, the noise, clapping, and shouting increased; it
was sufficiently sustained and intense to cause the
cancellation of the meeting some five minutes later.
2. Principal Defenses
(a) Cancellation of the Lodge speech was either
unnecessary or premature. Although there may have
been a degree of ineptness in the way Drs. Campbell and
Tompkins attempted to deal with the crowd, we would
agree that Ambassador Lodge was prevented from deli
vering his speech, and that cancellation of the program
was reasonable under the circumstances. We see no
evidence that the management of the situation was
directed toward entrapment of the demonstrators, as
claimed by Professor Franklin and some other witnesses.
Furthermore, although more skillful management and
additional persistence might have kept the meeting
going, we do not believe that an institution should be
required to supply for such functions presiding officers
who possess exceptional ability at crowd management.
(b) The disruption was justified on grounds of neces
sity. In his testimony and his argument, Professor
Franklin expressed approval of the disruptive conduct of
the protesters, and justified this view by claiming (i) that
the program was a political rather than an academic
function and that the meeting had not been properly
authorized under University regulations governing
speakers prominent in public life; (ii) that the program
was unbalanced because of the exclusion of speakers
from Communist countries; and (iii) that Ambassador
Lodge is a "war criminal."
(i) The Board believes that, in line with a long
practice of similar conferences and meetings on
campus sponsored by the Hoover Institution, the
intent was to hold an academic exercise rather
than a political meeting. Formal approval under
University regulations was secured in a routine
manner.
(ii) Although we agree that no special efforts were made
by the Hoover Institution to include a broad range
of political points of view, the Board emphasizes
that there is no requirement or expectation in
academic life that any single meeting must re
present the full extent of the political spectrum.
There is clearly an opportunity foi many divergent
views to be heard on this campus; the entire range
need not be present at each event.
(iii) Professor Franklin and many of his witnesses
objected to the presence of Ambassador Lodge on
the grounds that he is a "war criminal," and felt
that shouting and heckling were the only ways to
acquaint him with their opposition. There is no
question that there were deep feelings of outrage
within the Stanford community, which Professor
Franklin testified that he shared. Not only was Mr.
Lodge appearing under the apparent sponsorship
of the University, but he had made it clear at a
press conference earlier in the day that he would
entertain no questions dealing with the Vietnam
war. Although the topic of the meeting dealt with
the 25th anniversary of the United Nations, some
members of the academic community felt that by
refusing to deal with such questions Lodge, as a
public official, was refusing to make an accounting
of his stewardship of office. The Board, however,
is not willing to endorse the general principle that
a lecturer-regardless of his official position-must
accept his audience's selection of subject matter
for the discussion period. We further note that
whatever the depth of feeling of the protesters,
disruption was not a "last resort" to influence the
meeting. It was open to those with strong convic
tions to communicate of tiny; with the

Committee on Public Exercises, the President's
Office, or the Hoover Institution, for possible
modification of the format of the meeting; it was
also possible to devise means of non-disruptive
protest. There is no evidence that an effort of
either kind was made.
The Board acknowledges that reasonable men may
believe that Ambassador Lodge could be tried for
"war crimes" under the Nuremberg Principles.
However, it is important to remember that Mr.
Lodge has not been tried and found guilty of "war
crimes"-though the Board noted a tendency on
the part of many witnesses to assume the contrary
without question. We emphasize that just as Pro
fessor Franklin must be presumed innocent until
proven guilty, so too must Mr. Lodge.
Even if any or all of these arguments were supported
by the facts, the Board feels that disruptions of a
magnitude that force the cancellation of a speech on a
university campus simply cannot be justified. To
acquiesce to the indignation of any group in this matter
would permit a tyranny of the few that could deprive
the many of the chance to hear not only Mr. Lodge but
other controversial speakers as well.
(c) Shouting, heckling and other disruptive audience
conduct should be expected and in fact be condoned if a
"public figure" speaks on campus. Professor Franklin
claims that a "public Figure" speaking before an open
meeting should expect extensive "heckling," interrup
tions and argument from the audience. In support of
that view, he cites the decision In re Kay (I C.3d 930,
1970) for the assertion that "robust speech" is not only
expected when a political figure speaks before an audi
ence, but that shouted remarks from the audience
actually contribute to the democratic values of the
meeting. However, the conclusions of In re Kay were
drawn from an entirely different set of circumstancesâ€”
from a meeting in which a U.S. Congressman spoke
during an election campaign before an unfriendly out
door audience. In that instance, the speech was com
pleted, and audibility was impaired only occasionally
and locally.
Even setting aside these important differences, the
Board is unwilling to accept the standards of In re Kay
for an academic function at Stanford University. The
presence of a controversial political figure on the plat
form does not in itself convert the function into a
political meeting; other gatherings presenting speakers of
differing views can be arranged at the University.
Shouted invective and concerted disruption do not
provide a better educational experience than exposure to
divergent views, and the University has a responsibility
to optimize such intellectual transactions. We do not
believe that the University should reach out to the
external legal system for those standards used to protect
political-picnic oratory. Nor does the Board accept
Professor Franklin's view that in the classroom as in
public meetings, "politeness" and orderly procedure and
conduct interfere with the free expression of ideas.
3. Board Finding
The Board finds incontrovertibly strong evidence that
a large number of those in the audience denied the right
of speech, hearing and assembly to others on this
occasion. The Board considers such action destructive to
the fundamental values of the University, and does not
believe that the Defense arguments cited above justify
such conduct.
With the qualification that it became successively
more difficult for each speaker to be heard, the Board
accepts Paragraph 6 as a substant J ally accurate account,
and sustains the statement.
C. RESPONSE TO PARA GRAPH 7
The issues are considerably more complicated in
relation to Paragraph 7, which charges that Professor
Franklin "knowingly and intentionally participated in
the conduct specified in Paragraph 6 [loud shouting,
chanting and clapping], significantly contributing
thereby to the disruption which prevented Ambassador
Lodge from speaking and which forced the cancellation
of the program." There are three matters in coiltroversy
here: first, whether and to what degree Professor
Franklin was involved in the actions attributed to him;
second, whether in those actions he did take he was
"significantly contributing thereby to the disruption
which prevented Ambassador Lodge from speaking and
which forced the cancellation of the program"; and
third, how Piofessor Franklin's conduct relates to his
"appropriate function" and "duty" in the University.
I) Evidence on Professor Franklin's Involvement in
the Disruption of the Lodge Speech
(a) Uncontested items in the testimony of witnesses
from both sides.
(i) Early in Dr. Campbell's remarks Professor Fran
klin shouted the word "napalm!" Other shouts from
the audience were heard during the speech made by
Dr. Campbell.
(ii) When Dr. Tompkins took the podium he began
with a sarcastic reference to the "polite" audience,
upon which Professor Franklin shouted, "Tell us
about politeness at My Lai."
In his affidavit executed on February 24, 1971,
Professor Franklin agrees that he "heckled" Henry
Cabot Lodge; in particular he agrees to the nature of the
shouted remarks attributed to him while Drs. Campbell
and Tompkins were at the podium. Professor Franklin
testified that the statement in his affidavit in which he
"publicly acknowledged my heckling of Henry Cabot
Lodge" referred to the Lodge program in general, and
not to Lodge's own speech in particular.
(b) Items on which the testimony, even if not of
fered by both sides, seems clear and credible.
(i) Members of Professor Franklin's 1:15 class took a
vote, not initiated by him, to leave the class in order
to attend the Lodge speech; a number of them clearly
wished to protest Lodge's presence in some fashion.
(ii) The fact that Ambassador Lodge was coming to
Stanford was not generally known until a few days
before his appearance. There is no evidence that the
disruption in Dinkelspiel was specifically organized,
although there was "word of mouth" communication
to induce protesters having strong views about
Lodge's culpability in connection with the Vietnam
war to attend the Dinkelspiel program of January 11,
1971. In consequence, a significant portion of the
audiencc was composed of people who intended to
protest in some way.
(iii) Professor Franklin is not alleged by any witness
to have part'eipated in attempts to organize a protest

ahead of time. His own testimony is that he intended
to ask Lodge a difficult question at the conclusion of
the speech. Professor Franklin can be assumed from
the evidence to have known, however, that vigorous
protest was probable and outright disruption possible.
(iv) There is no evidence that Professor Franklin was
part of any organized group within Dinkelspiel. He
went to the auditorium accompanied only by his wife
and son, and was joined after he entered by others
who shared his political views.
(v) The audience in Dinkelspiel became increasingly
polarized as the program and the protest unfolded.
The disruptive conduct was clearly initiated by the
protesters; in consequence there was an intense
counter-reaction on the part of the rest of the
audience. Much of the noise that made it difficult to
hear the speakers came from such intra-audience
exchanges.
(c) Items on which there is conflicting testimony.
The length of time between the Lodge incident and the
Advisory Board hearings has increased the difficulty of
reconstructing the details of Professor Franklin's actions,
and this difficulty is apparent in the testimony offered
by both sides. Moreover, the noise, personal political
convictions, and participation of some of the witnesses
clearly interferes with reliable observation of the events.
This makes the problem of evaluating the credibility of
testimony more difficult still, even where it is not
conflicting.
It appears likely to the Board that two of the
University's witnesses (Beckwith and Matthews) may
have been confused in their identification of Professor
Franklin, so that they attributed to him certain actions
that may have been engaged in by another person sitting
near him. By their own testimony, persons near Profes
sor Franklin did engage in the sorts of disruptive con
duct with which he is charged. Two witnesses (Geier and
Laney) alleged in testimony that during the Lodge
meeting Beckwith and Matthews accused them of disrup
tive conduct; however, these two witnesses testified that
they had not participated in any protest activities what
ever. Another University witness (C. Jacobs) did not see
Professor Franklin "clapping or chanting," though she
observed him "shouting." Only one witness (Hanley)
gives strong evidence in support of all three items of
disruptive conduct charged, although there is some
dispute concerning the timing of the events he observed.
On the other hand, while all of Professor Franklin's
witnesses assert that they did not see him engaging in
"loud shouting, chanting or clapping" (save for the two
shouts in 1-a-i and ii), none can say with certainty that
they had him continuously in view. One (Ramirez)
actually testified that the auditorium was so dark as to
make clear vision difficult, while a number of others
were so positioned in the auditorium as to make a clear
view of Professor Franklin exceedingly difficult. While
Ambassador Lodge was at the platform, many persons in
the audience were standing, interfering with the visibility
of Professor Franklin to witnesses. Strong testimony on
Professor Franklin's behalf, however, comes from wit
nesses (Geier and Laney) sitting directly in front of him;
they could be expected to have heard him if he had
engaged in the sustained activities with which he is
charged, although they were not facing him during the
critical period. Professor Franklin himself testified that
he was "just about positive" he did not rhythmically
clap.
The Board does not find the evidence strongly persua
sive that Professor Franklin's conduct included
"chanting and clapping" as specified in the charges. He
did engage in "loud shouting" on at least two occasions
when the rest of the audience was quiet, and possibly at
other times as well, but there is not strongly persuasive

evidence that this shouting took place during the time
Lodge was at the podium.
2) The Contribution of Professor Franklin's Conduct
to the Disruption Which Forced Cancellation of the
Speech
The Board is critical of Professor Franklin's conduct
during the meeting. His verbal attacks on the speakers
constitute questionable behavior, in our view, for a
member of the faculty, since he should have known that
shouts from a recognized leader during relative periods
of calm-clearly audible even on the tape recorded from
the podium microphone - would add to the excitement
of those numerous members of the audience considering
a disruption of the proceedings. However, after re
viewing the testimony the Board does not feel that it has
been presented with strongly persuasive evidence that
Professor Franklin's shouts triggered the demonstration
or that he was personally guilty of "significantly contri
buting" to the disruption that finally forced the cancel
lation of the meeting. Given the mood of the crowd and
the wide distribution of pockets of disruptive activity
through the auditorium, it is plausible that the nature
and intensity of the disruption would not have been
significantly different without Professor Franklin's pre
sence.
Many of Professor Franklin's witnesses claim that
there was a deliberate attempt by Dr. Tompkins to bait
Professor Franklin into disruptive conduct and call
attention to his activity. The Board finds no evidence to
support this claim since (as is uncontested) Professor
Franklin clearly called attention to himself by inter
rupting Dr. Tompkins after one sentence with his com
ment about "politeness at My Lai." Indeed the Board
believes that Professor Franklin, having in fact been
identified in this public way, may well have decided not
to open himself to possible charges by engaging in
further disruptive activity.
3) Professor Franklin's Conduct as a Faculty Member
as it Relates to the Lodge Incident
Professor Franklin has argued that in his shouted
questions about napalm and My Lai he was actually
performing his "appropriate function" as a university
professor since he regarded the featured speaker as a war
criminal. While such convictions may have impelled him
to seek this means of acquainting the University with
these atrocities, other routes are available which could
have served the same purpose without infringing upon
the rights of others. Professor Franklin's right to speak
out in protest at a time and place of his own choosing
must be balanced not only against the right of Mr. Lodge
to speak, but also against the rights of others to hear and
to assemble peacefully. The Board cannot accept the
view that the interruption of University functions - let
alone their disruptionâ€”is part of the appropriate func
tion of a faculty member at Stanford.
We note, finally, that Professor Franklin has des
cribed his own role in the Lodge affair in terms of his
larger role as a leader of the revolutionary movement. He
points out that his position as a tenured professor is
important to that movement, and that his loss to it
would be more serious than that of a student; and he
employs this view in explaining his own caution. At the
same time, he describes the disruption at the Lodge
speech as too weak, and clearly indicates his own
preference for more violent actions. This combination of
views has the effect of making incitement almost a way
of life; and it raises serious questions. Quite aside from
this immediate charge, may a professor regularly encour
age students to engage in proscribed conduct while he
deliberately refrains from the same activities? We return
to this issue later, in connection with the other charges.
4. Board Findings
In view of items 1) and 2) above, the specific charges
against Professor Franklin as drawn in Paragraph 7 are
not sustained.
