# Background To Events Of February 10, 1971
## 
### 
A. PREFACE
The climactic events of February 10, on which the
remaining charges focus, did not occur without warning.
Rather, the preceding several days were characterized by
overt turbulence and escalating protest activities. To
understand the events of February 10, it is helpful to
have some background. We therefore now briefly sketch
events which convey the atmosphere of those days and
are pertinent to the remaining charges.
Dissatisfaction with the Indochina war was rising
again because of rumors that an invasion of Laos was
about to begin, perhaps with participation of American
armed forces. In addition, the Stanford Judicial Council
had been holding hearings on charges brought against
students who were accused of disrupting the January
speech of Henry Cabot Lodge. Professor Franklin and
his associates were strongly opposed to these charges and
to the campus judicial system in which they were being
considered.'
B. CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS PRIOR TO FEB
RUARY 10, 1971
On Saturday, February 6, at about 1 a.m., arson was
attempted on the small wooden building known as the
Free Market-the headquarters of the conservative Free
Campus Movement whose members frequently observe
and photograph demonstrations. Later Saturday evening,
at 9:40 p.m., Molotov cocktails were thrown into the
first-floor office of the ROTC building. Three false fire
alarms were registered soon thereafter at scattered points
on campus. Moments earlier, on the other side of the
campus firemen had responded to a fire in a trash barrel
behind Ventura Hall and a false alarm at the Boathouse.
On Sunday, February 7, the invasion of Laos by
South Vietnamese troops with U.S. air support was
officially announced. At 8 p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditori
um a crowd of some 600 persons attended a perfor
mance of the San Francisco Mime Troupe sponsored by
the Stanford Community Against War and Fascism.
Before the Mime Troupe began to perform, it was
announced that Laos had been invaded. A telegram sent
from Ann Arbor, Michigan by Madame Binh, head of the
North Vietnam delegation to the Paris Peace Talks, was
read which called "for mobilizing peace forces in your
country." The Coalition Against the War in Indochina
distributed a flyer entitled "It's Official!! Laos Has Been
Invaded," which spelled out Madame Binh's message in
detail and called for a rally at White Plaza on Monday,
February 8. Leaflets were distributed by a antiwar group
called The Inquisition, demanding that the University

"release all information on the uses of the Computation
Center" and that war research at the Center "immediate
ly be halted." In this leaflet the Stanford Research
Institute computer program known as Gamut-H was
described. The program was said to simulate the logistics
of deployment of helicopters and ships and the leaflet
asserted that the "work is directly applicable in Indo
china."
After the performance, at about 1 0:30 p.m., over 200
persons protesting the Laos invasion broke about 100
windows in several buildings, including the Graduate
School of Business, Undergraduate Library, Post Office,
Engineering Corner, Terman Engineering, Placement
Center, Cubberly Education, Lou Henry Hoover Build
ing, and the Inner Quad. In addition to campus police on
duty, 35 Sheriffs deputies were brought on to campus
briefly after the first reports of property destruction,
but the "trashing" quickly subsided and the deputies
were not deployed. Windows in two Stanford University
police cars were broken when spotlights from one of the
cars were focused on 15-30 demonstrators hurling rocks
into the Lou Henrv Hoover building. Fights broke out
between demonstrators and members of the Free Cam
pus Movement who were attempting to halt the trashing.
The University Computation Center was evacuated at
9:30 p.m. after a telephoned bomb threat was received,
but after a search people re-entered the facility. (This
was not the first threat to the Center. In the spring of
1970, a part of the computer complex in Polya Hall was
the target of arson, but quick action averted serious
damage.)
On Monday, February 8, the noon rally was attended
by about 800 in White Memorial Plaza. The leaflet from
The Inquisition on the SKI war-related computer pro
gram was distributed together with a flyer entitled "Do
It!" "Do It!" encouraged formation of tight affinity
groups to "do whatever actions you feel ready to do"
and stated "last night's action was the first in a scries in
response to the invasion of Laos." It anticipated trouble
with police and with "right wing fascists," and gave
suggestions for handling such trouble.
An "Open Letter to the Stanford Community" from
the Inquisition also became available at about this time.
It stated that the Computation Center was being used by
Stanford Research Institute for "war research." Six
demands were made in the letter, including making
public the identity of all non-Stanford users of Stanford
facilities and phasing out of all Stanford research funded
by the Department of Defense; attached to this letter
was reply made by Provost Miller to some of these
demands.
About 100 antiwar demonstrators left the rally and
then went to the near-empty Faculty Club dining room
searching for members of the Stanford Board of Trus
tees. The group then left for the Graduate School of
Business where at 1:25 p.m. about 150 persons jammed
into the ground level lobby, blocking entry to a room in
which a trustee committee was meeting and holding the
committee virtually under siege for 45 minutes. At 1:45
p.m., C.D. Marron of the Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Department declared it was an unlawful assembly, with
the group chanting back: "Power to the People." The
crowd dispersed when a squad of sheriff's deputies
appeared. One plain-clothesman suffered a head lacera
tion when hit by a thrown rock. At 2:30 p.m. about 24
police dispersed some 300 demonstrators who had re
assembled outside the ground floor of the Graduate
School of Business.
At about 2:45 p.m. part of the group of demonstra
tors headed for the Old Union. About 150 persons
arrived at the courtyard, and 50 of them proceeded into
the Union lobby. A meeting was then called in the
lobby, and the Old Union was selected as a "strike
center." At 5:30 p.m. about 20 Santa Clara Sheriffs
Deputies moved into the rear (West) of the Old Union,
sweeping about 40 remaining occupants into the court
yard. Simultaneously some 15 members of the San Jose
Tactical Squad moved to the front (East) of the Old
Union. At about 5:45 p.m. the San Jose units left the
scene. Subsequently, however, numerous squads of
Santa Clara County and San Jose police patrolled the
campus on foot as well as by car.
On Tuesday, February 9, there was an afternoon
meeting in the Physics Tank, following the Stanford
Judicial Council hearing, in which a "Cambodia-type
strike" protesting the invasion of Laos was planned. In
the evening, beginning at 8 p.m., a three-hour session
was held in Dinkelspiel Auditorium, attended at the
peak by approximately 800 people. A recording of the
meeting taped by KZSU is available, and an analysis of
the speeches at the session is presented in the following
section.
C. ANALYSIS OF THE DINKELSPIEL RALLY
SPEECHES OF FEBRUARY 9, 1971
An important part of the context for the three
speeches of Professor Franklin on February 10th is the
Dinkelspiel rally of February 9th. That lengthy evening
rally did much to set the stage for the events of the
following day. Its recurrent themes mav help in under
standing the meaning of some significant terms used in
the February 10th speeches of Professor Franklin.
Indeed, in the hearing Professor Franklin urged us to
consider this meeting carefully in order to understand
the subsequent events. He participated in the February
9th rally, made a speech there, and was referred to by
several other speakers. [See Appendix I] His leadership
position may reasonably be inferred from the tape of
this meeting.
Many speakers emphasized Stanford's complicity in
the war. They emphasized the necessity of concentrating
protest activity on the campus rather than off it, and
doing so in a powerful way that would impair the
University and hence the war effort.
There were repeated linkages of the war in Southeast
Asia with the struggle at Stanford, particularly in rela
tion to police on campus. The police were referred to as
pigs and were described as an occupation army. Harrass
ment of police was repeatedly advocated. One speaker
indicated that resistance to the occupation army could
best be carried out late at night. Some speakers pictured
the protesters at Stanford as sharing in a common effort
with the people of Southeast Asia, especially the NLF
and Pathet Lao. The following remarks, which were
made early in the rally and echoed later, exemplify this
approach:
What we have found through research and looking at
how the war is carried out is that it is an immensely
technological war and that Stanford is very useful.
And so the only reason that we would attack the
University would be on the grounds of effectiveness,
so I would try to direct the demands toward specific
things in the community and that are attackable like
the computer center, like the Gamut-H program
that's going on there. Also, in the past things like the
A3M have made other movements start so with the
effectiveness here and exemplary action for other
universities we hope to take to close out and down
things which we think are very valuable to the
carrying on of this type of war to make it that much
more costly.
This is followed by another speaker:
I think that we should take the strongest action
possible tomorrow and the next day and the next day
after that. But that we should also be addressing
ourselves to questions of, and the other things we can
begin to move on immediately are some of the
demands that have already been raised like ending the
occupa. . .the armed occupation of this community.
That kind of thing we should begin to move on
immediately.
There were many references to the Computation
Center. It was clearly the object of intense interest, both
for its alleged war complicity and for its vulnerability. It
emerged as the prime target for protest activity. The
discussion of the Computation Center may be illustrated
by a speech in the middle of the meeting:
I'm not even going to talk about a strike. It doesn't
matter either way. But what, I think that it's appa
rent that the place that has to be hit, and has to be
hit hardest and can be hit not only here but in every
college campus and in every city in the country, are
the computer centers, [applause, shouts of 'Right
on'] and they don't have to be hit violently. Com
puter centers are the most vulnerable places any
where. If, you've seen the lights blink every once in a
while with the power shortage, well, if that were to
happen in a computer center for a millisecond, the
computer has to be shut down, and reloaded. And
that's at least an hour delay. Now what does an hour
delay mean to a computer in the computer center?
Well, it could mean just an hour delay. It could mean
a day delay. It could mean a week delay. It could be a
month delay or a year delay, [laughterj. It's, nobody
knows. It's dependent upon what's destroyed in just
that power shortage. What's destroyed in core
storage. What's destroyed as to the records. What
could be destroyed in the tape reserve rooms by the
temperature going too high. Nobody knows.
[Laughter, by speaker and othersl
Other references to the Computation Center included
a variety of ways in which it might be shut down and
put out of service; for example, by blocking access to it
with hundreds or thousands of people, by attacking it,
even by destroying it. Occasionally, a word of caution
was expressed regarding the more violent possibilities.

At various points throughout the meeting, references
to coercive and violent protest activities were received
with applause or laughter. Acts such as seizing and
occupying a building for long periods tended to be
treated casually. Violent acts were sometimes spoken of
explicitly, and sometimes merely hinted at. Audience
response indicated that these hints evoked considerable
interest. Fifteen speakers advocated actions in protest on
the campus that were most likely coercive or violent in
nature. The following speech illustrates the treatment of
coercive behavior.
Yeah, let me straighten that out. I did not advocate
any kind of violence about this computer. I tried to
say that the beauty of the computer center was no
violence is necessary. None at all to get, to get what
you want. Simple little sitting in doorways with a
thousand people, you know, no violence. You don't
have to break a window. Not one single window. And
you can siiil affect problems with this computer
center. Without any destruction whatsoever. So
there's no violence that would be necessary, please.
(Laughter). . .is used by everybody. If you want to
hit industries, you hit the computer that they're
using. That stops them from functioning. But you
have to hit them with enough people to stop normal
access.
Several speakers, notably Braunstein, advocated
action on different levels, violent and non-violent, each
helping the protest movement in his own way. A
spectrum of activities was included, some of which were
clearly coercive and some even overtly violent. Imagina
tion was required to think of ways to disrupt the
functioning of the University and harass the police.
Altogether, six speakers favored pursuing this multi
ple-levels-of-action, approach, embracing a broad spec
trum of protest activities. The general tendency of these
speakers was to favor the more disruptive end of this
range of activities.
The flavor of this approach is well exemplified in the
speech of Braunstein, which is worth quoting in its
entirety.
One thing we've been noted for over the past few
years when we've done any action, and again tonight,
is a lack of imagination. And, you know, I'd like to
address this not to the people in this audience who
know how they're going to vote and are going to
participate in anything, but people listening on radio
wondering what can I do to relate to all this? How
can I help? I'm not willing to get busted in front of
the Computer Center. Or what have you. And there
are many ways, and all you have to do is just think
about it. Last night there were some people out
playing football who kept just dozens of police busy
asking for IDs all the time. At one point they tried to

bring the football into the Computer Center and it
was searched. The football, [applause] Things like
this that tie up the opposing forces, while are not
directly going to end the war in Vietnam, are making
other people's actions become more effective. And
anybody who says "1 can't relate to this movement
because 1 don't agree with your tactics" just has a bad
imagination, and you know, there are many levels of
other action. There are people breaking windows,
there are people who sit in front of the ROTC
building for days, and days, and days, after other
people got tired. These people just were there. They
deserve, you know, our unending thanks. And there
are other people who have done other things, who for
some reason or other don't want to claim credit for
it. All those people also deserve our thanks,
[applause] And. . . . [KZSU interrupts to say speaker
is Yale Braunstein] . . .like the guy who two years
ago drove into a power pole up in Woodside and put
the Computer Center out for a week. Now they've
built an emergency power system, but you know,
there are other actions both violent and non-violent,
imaginative and very mundane, all of which can help
us and everybody, even if you, you object to how the
final vote comes out, should find some way of
keeping them busy in their off hours and should
devote more and more of that time to helping the
Movement, [applause]
As the meeting proceeded, a suggestion made by
Janet Weiss elicited considerable acceptance: to adopt
the tactics of a "mobile strike." The word "strike" was
used often in the meeting. Some of the usage was
unclear, and most of it bore little relation to the usual
meaning of the term in a labor dispute—i.e., the con
certed withholding of labor on a voluntary basis. In the
latter part of the Dinkelspiel rally, consensus grew on
the "mobile strike" or "mobile strike force," as the
meeting's chairman referred to it. The "mobile strike"
was intended to be a series of disruptive acts, hopefully
leading to a total shutdown of the University. Occupa
tion of the Computation Center was considered a good
way to begin. Then, if the occupants were evicted by the
police, another building could be occupied, and then
other actions taken as issues and targets become appa
rent. Nine speakers forcefully advocated a "mobile
strike," clearly including coercive acts within the scope
of such a "strike." Since Janet Weiss' formulation
seemed to be quite influential, it is worth quoting her
remarks on this subject.
I've heard that at some places they've used a tactic of
shutting down one building with a large group of
people, and then going and shutting something else
down so that nothing is shut down continually but

things are shut down, you know a lot of things are,
are shut down at different times, and maybe that's
the kind of strike that would work here, maybe that's
the kind of thing that would keep people doing
something, keep them involved in it, so that you
don't feel like you're just sitting there all day, bored
and cold. 1 think another thing, though, that, one
thing that seems to me is clear that we need, whatever
kind of action we have as a focus, is a lot of other
little peripheral actions, like the actions about people
going out in groups and causing the pigs that are on
the campus to really have to do their jobs. People can
put up signs and posters in bathrooms and buildings,
and things. You see the pigs dont' go into the
buildings, and any number of things that we can do
from inside the building to cause a lot of disruption,
havoc and chaos on the campus, and to keep it from
functioning properly, without really risking a lot of
things and things that might be very pointed. Now
that's the kind of things that I can see in a strike that
would work, but I'd kind of like to, if we're going to
talk about a strike, I think that we should have some
idea of what we're talking about. Because I don't
think, maybe I'm wrong, that we're going to get a lot
of people interested in a strike which means people
sitting around in different doorways, very isolated
from each other for hours at a time.
Near the end of the meeting, the Hoover Institution
was still mentioned as an attractive target.
Well, anyway, I was going to suggest that if there is a
rally scheduled for tomorrow or however we are
going to do it, we should probably move from there,
when we'll have a crowd already, and 1 think we
should take over Hoover and that, you know, 1 think
that they wouldn't let us stay too long in Hoover
before they brought pigs on to campus in daytime
and, which would be, you know, a very nice thing to
happen, you know, for the "movement", I think. If
we went to the Comp. Center, first of all 1 don't
think we'd have enough people by tomorrow to go to
the Comp Center and secondly it's pretty far removed
from the central part of campus. Hoover's right in the
center and I think it would be a good thing to do
tomorrow. And we'll be kicked out before 5, but
that's good too.
At the end of the meeting, there was general agree
ment that ways must be found the next day to recruit a
larger group of participants for the "mobile strike,"
whether it would begin at the Computation Center or
elsewhere. Concern was expressed by four speakers that
the number remaining in Dinkelspiel was too small to
permit an effective "mobile strike." This was advanced
as the primary reason for calling a noon rally at White
Plaza on February 10.
A. PREFACE
The climactic events of February 10, on which the
remaining charges focus, did not occur without warning.
Rather, the preceding several days were characterized by
overt turbulence and escalating protest activities. To
understand the events of February 10, it is helpful to
have some background. We therefore now briefly sketch
events which convey the atmosphere of those days and
are pertinent to the remaining charges.
Dissatisfaction with the Indochina war was rising
again because of rumors that an invasion of Laos was
about to begin, perhaps with participation of American
armed forces. In addition, the Stanford Judicial Council
had been holding hearings on charges brought against
students who were accused of disrupting the January
speech of Henry Cabot Lodge. Professor Franklin and
his associates were strongly opposed to these charges and
to the campus judicial system in which they were being
considered.'
B. CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS PRIOR TO FEB
RUARY 10, 1971
On Saturday, February 6, at about 1 a.m., arson was
attempted on the small wooden building known as the
Free Market-the headquarters of the conservative Free
Campus Movement whose members frequently observe
and photograph demonstrations. Later Saturday evening,
at 9:40 p.m., Molotov cocktails were thrown into the
first-floor office of the ROTC building. Three false fire
alarms were registered soon thereafter at scattered points
on campus. Moments earlier, on the other side of the
campus firemen had responded to a fire in a trash barrel
behind Ventura Hall and a false alarm at the Boathouse.
On Sunday, February 7, the invasion of Laos by
South Vietnamese troops with U.S. air support was
officially announced. At 8 p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditori
um a crowd of some 600 persons attended a perfor
mance of the San Francisco Mime Troupe sponsored by
the Stanford Community Against War and Fascism.
Before the Mime Troupe began to perform, it was
announced that Laos had been invaded. A telegram sent
from Ann Arbor, Michigan by Madame Binh, head of the
North Vietnam delegation to the Paris Peace Talks, was
read which called "for mobilizing peace forces in your
country." The Coalition Against the War in Indochina
distributed a flyer entitled "It's Official!! Laos Has Been
Invaded," which spelled out Madame Binh's message in
detail and called for a rally at White Plaza on Monday,
February 8. Leaflets were distributed by a antiwar group
called The Inquisition, demanding that the University

"release all information on the uses of the Computation
Center" and that war research at the Center "immediate
ly be halted." In this leaflet the Stanford Research
Institute computer program known as Gamut-H was
described. The program was said to simulate the logistics
of deployment of helicopters and ships and the leaflet
asserted that the "work is directly applicable in Indo
china."
After the performance, at about 1 0:30 p.m., over 200
persons protesting the Laos invasion broke about 100
windows in several buildings, including the Graduate
School of Business, Undergraduate Library, Post Office,
Engineering Corner, Terman Engineering, Placement
Center, Cubberly Education, Lou Henry Hoover Build
ing, and the Inner Quad. In addition to campus police on
duty, 35 Sheriffs deputies were brought on to campus
briefly after the first reports of property destruction,
but the "trashing" quickly subsided and the deputies
were not deployed. Windows in two Stanford University
police cars were broken when spotlights from one of the
cars were focused on 15-30 demonstrators hurling rocks
into the Lou Henrv Hoover building. Fights broke out
between demonstrators and members of the Free Cam
pus Movement who were attempting to halt the trashing.
The University Computation Center was evacuated at
9:30 p.m. after a telephoned bomb threat was received,
but after a search people re-entered the facility. (This
was not the first threat to the Center. In the spring of
1970, a part of the computer complex in Polya Hall was
the target of arson, but quick action averted serious
damage.)
On Monday, February 8, the noon rally was attended
by about 800 in White Memorial Plaza. The leaflet from
The Inquisition on the SKI war-related computer pro
gram was distributed together with a flyer entitled "Do
It!" "Do It!" encouraged formation of tight affinity
groups to "do whatever actions you feel ready to do"
and stated "last night's action was the first in a scries in
response to the invasion of Laos." It anticipated trouble
with police and with "right wing fascists," and gave
suggestions for handling such trouble.
An "Open Letter to the Stanford Community" from
the Inquisition also became available at about this time.
It stated that the Computation Center was being used by
Stanford Research Institute for "war research." Six
demands were made in the letter, including making
public the identity of all non-Stanford users of Stanford
facilities and phasing out of all Stanford research funded
by the Department of Defense; attached to this letter
was reply made by Provost Miller to some of these
demands.
About 100 antiwar demonstrators left the rally and
then went to the near-empty Faculty Club dining room
searching for members of the Stanford Board of Trus
tees. The group then left for the Graduate School of
Business where at 1:25 p.m. about 150 persons jammed
into the ground level lobby, blocking entry to a room in
which a trustee committee was meeting and holding the
committee virtually under siege for 45 minutes. At 1:45
p.m., C.D. Marron of the Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Department declared it was an unlawful assembly, with
the group chanting back: "Power to the People." The
crowd dispersed when a squad of sheriff's deputies
appeared. One plain-clothesman suffered a head lacera
tion when hit by a thrown rock. At 2:30 p.m. about 24
police dispersed some 300 demonstrators who had re
assembled outside the ground floor of the Graduate
School of Business.
At about 2:45 p.m. part of the group of demonstra
tors headed for the Old Union. About 150 persons
arrived at the courtyard, and 50 of them proceeded into
the Union lobby. A meeting was then called in the
lobby, and the Old Union was selected as a "strike
center." At 5:30 p.m. about 20 Santa Clara Sheriffs
Deputies moved into the rear (West) of the Old Union,
sweeping about 40 remaining occupants into the court
yard. Simultaneously some 15 members of the San Jose
Tactical Squad moved to the front (East) of the Old
Union. At about 5:45 p.m. the San Jose units left the
scene. Subsequently, however, numerous squads of
Santa Clara County and San Jose police patrolled the
campus on foot as well as by car.
On Tuesday, February 9, there was an afternoon
meeting in the Physics Tank, following the Stanford
Judicial Council hearing, in which a "Cambodia-type
strike" protesting the invasion of Laos was planned. In
the evening, beginning at 8 p.m., a three-hour session
was held in Dinkelspiel Auditorium, attended at the
peak by approximately 800 people. A recording of the
meeting taped by KZSU is available, and an analysis of
the speeches at the session is presented in the following
section.
C. ANALYSIS OF THE DINKELSPIEL RALLY
SPEECHES OF FEBRUARY 9, 1971
An important part of the context for the three
speeches of Professor Franklin on February 10th is the
Dinkelspiel rally of February 9th. That lengthy evening
rally did much to set the stage for the events of the
following day. Its recurrent themes mav help in under
standing the meaning of some significant terms used in
the February 10th speeches of Professor Franklin.
Indeed, in the hearing Professor Franklin urged us to
consider this meeting carefully in order to understand
the subsequent events. He participated in the February
9th rally, made a speech there, and was referred to by
several other speakers. [See Appendix I] His leadership
position may reasonably be inferred from the tape of
this meeting.
Many speakers emphasized Stanford's complicity in
the war. They emphasized the necessity of concentrating
protest activity on the campus rather than off it, and
doing so in a powerful way that would impair the
University and hence the war effort.
There were repeated linkages of the war in Southeast
Asia with the struggle at Stanford, particularly in rela
tion to police on campus. The police were referred to as
pigs and were described as an occupation army. Harrass
ment of police was repeatedly advocated. One speaker
indicated that resistance to the occupation army could
best be carried out late at night. Some speakers pictured
the protesters at Stanford as sharing in a common effort
with the people of Southeast Asia, especially the NLF
and Pathet Lao. The following remarks, which were
made early in the rally and echoed later, exemplify this
approach:
What we have found through research and looking at
how the war is carried out is that it is an immensely
technological war and that Stanford is very useful.
And so the only reason that we would attack the
University would be on the grounds of effectiveness,
so I would try to direct the demands toward specific
things in the community and that are attackable like
the computer center, like the Gamut-H program
that's going on there. Also, in the past things like the
A3M have made other movements start so with the
effectiveness here and exemplary action for other
universities we hope to take to close out and down
things which we think are very valuable to the
carrying on of this type of war to make it that much
more costly.
This is followed by another speaker:
I think that we should take the strongest action
possible tomorrow and the next day and the next day
after that. But that we should also be addressing
ourselves to questions of, and the other things we can
begin to move on immediately are some of the
demands that have already been raised like ending the
occupa. . .the armed occupation of this community.
That kind of thing we should begin to move on
immediately.
There were many references to the Computation
Center. It was clearly the object of intense interest, both
for its alleged war complicity and for its vulnerability. It
emerged as the prime target for protest activity. The
discussion of the Computation Center may be illustrated
by a speech in the middle of the meeting:
I'm not even going to talk about a strike. It doesn't
matter either way. But what, I think that it's appa
rent that the place that has to be hit, and has to be
hit hardest and can be hit not only here but in every
college campus and in every city in the country, are
the computer centers, [applause, shouts of 'Right
on'] and they don't have to be hit violently. Com
puter centers are the most vulnerable places any
where. If, you've seen the lights blink every once in a
while with the power shortage, well, if that were to
happen in a computer center for a millisecond, the
computer has to be shut down, and reloaded. And
that's at least an hour delay. Now what does an hour
delay mean to a computer in the computer center?
Well, it could mean just an hour delay. It could mean
a day delay. It could mean a week delay. It could be a
month delay or a year delay, [laughterj. It's, nobody
knows. It's dependent upon what's destroyed in just
that power shortage. What's destroyed in core
storage. What's destroyed as to the records. What
could be destroyed in the tape reserve rooms by the
temperature going too high. Nobody knows.
[Laughter, by speaker and othersl
Other references to the Computation Center included
a variety of ways in which it might be shut down and
put out of service; for example, by blocking access to it
with hundreds or thousands of people, by attacking it,
even by destroying it. Occasionally, a word of caution
was expressed regarding the more violent possibilities.

At various points throughout the meeting, references
to coercive and violent protest activities were received
with applause or laughter. Acts such as seizing and
occupying a building for long periods tended to be
treated casually. Violent acts were sometimes spoken of
explicitly, and sometimes merely hinted at. Audience
response indicated that these hints evoked considerable
interest. Fifteen speakers advocated actions in protest on
the campus that were most likely coercive or violent in
nature. The following speech illustrates the treatment of
coercive behavior.
Yeah, let me straighten that out. I did not advocate
any kind of violence about this computer. I tried to
say that the beauty of the computer center was no
violence is necessary. None at all to get, to get what
you want. Simple little sitting in doorways with a
thousand people, you know, no violence. You don't
have to break a window. Not one single window. And
you can siiil affect problems with this computer
center. Without any destruction whatsoever. So
there's no violence that would be necessary, please.
(Laughter). . .is used by everybody. If you want to
hit industries, you hit the computer that they're
using. That stops them from functioning. But you
have to hit them with enough people to stop normal
access.
Several speakers, notably Braunstein, advocated
action on different levels, violent and non-violent, each
helping the protest movement in his own way. A
spectrum of activities was included, some of which were
clearly coercive and some even overtly violent. Imagina
tion was required to think of ways to disrupt the
functioning of the University and harass the police.
Altogether, six speakers favored pursuing this multi
ple-levels-of-action, approach, embracing a broad spec
trum of protest activities. The general tendency of these
speakers was to favor the more disruptive end of this
range of activities.
The flavor of this approach is well exemplified in the
speech of Braunstein, which is worth quoting in its
entirety.
One thing we've been noted for over the past few
years when we've done any action, and again tonight,
is a lack of imagination. And, you know, I'd like to
address this not to the people in this audience who
know how they're going to vote and are going to
participate in anything, but people listening on radio
wondering what can I do to relate to all this? How
can I help? I'm not willing to get busted in front of
the Computer Center. Or what have you. And there
are many ways, and all you have to do is just think
about it. Last night there were some people out
playing football who kept just dozens of police busy
asking for IDs all the time. At one point they tried to

bring the football into the Computer Center and it
was searched. The football, [applause] Things like
this that tie up the opposing forces, while are not
directly going to end the war in Vietnam, are making
other people's actions become more effective. And
anybody who says "1 can't relate to this movement
because 1 don't agree with your tactics" just has a bad
imagination, and you know, there are many levels of
other action. There are people breaking windows,
there are people who sit in front of the ROTC
building for days, and days, and days, after other
people got tired. These people just were there. They
deserve, you know, our unending thanks. And there
are other people who have done other things, who for
some reason or other don't want to claim credit for
it. All those people also deserve our thanks,
[applause] And. . . . [KZSU interrupts to say speaker
is Yale Braunstein] . . .like the guy who two years
ago drove into a power pole up in Woodside and put
the Computer Center out for a week. Now they've
built an emergency power system, but you know,
there are other actions both violent and non-violent,
imaginative and very mundane, all of which can help
us and everybody, even if you, you object to how the
final vote comes out, should find some way of
keeping them busy in their off hours and should
devote more and more of that time to helping the
Movement, [applause]
As the meeting proceeded, a suggestion made by
Janet Weiss elicited considerable acceptance: to adopt
the tactics of a "mobile strike." The word "strike" was
used often in the meeting. Some of the usage was
unclear, and most of it bore little relation to the usual
meaning of the term in a labor dispute—i.e., the con
certed withholding of labor on a voluntary basis. In the
latter part of the Dinkelspiel rally, consensus grew on
the "mobile strike" or "mobile strike force," as the
meeting's chairman referred to it. The "mobile strike"
was intended to be a series of disruptive acts, hopefully
leading to a total shutdown of the University. Occupa
tion of the Computation Center was considered a good
way to begin. Then, if the occupants were evicted by the
police, another building could be occupied, and then
other actions taken as issues and targets become appa
rent. Nine speakers forcefully advocated a "mobile
strike," clearly including coercive acts within the scope
of such a "strike." Since Janet Weiss' formulation
seemed to be quite influential, it is worth quoting her
remarks on this subject.
I've heard that at some places they've used a tactic of
shutting down one building with a large group of
people, and then going and shutting something else
down so that nothing is shut down continually but

things are shut down, you know a lot of things are,
are shut down at different times, and maybe that's
the kind of strike that would work here, maybe that's
the kind of thing that would keep people doing
something, keep them involved in it, so that you
don't feel like you're just sitting there all day, bored
and cold. 1 think another thing, though, that, one
thing that seems to me is clear that we need, whatever
kind of action we have as a focus, is a lot of other
little peripheral actions, like the actions about people
going out in groups and causing the pigs that are on
the campus to really have to do their jobs. People can
put up signs and posters in bathrooms and buildings,
and things. You see the pigs dont' go into the
buildings, and any number of things that we can do
from inside the building to cause a lot of disruption,
havoc and chaos on the campus, and to keep it from
functioning properly, without really risking a lot of
things and things that might be very pointed. Now
that's the kind of things that I can see in a strike that
would work, but I'd kind of like to, if we're going to
talk about a strike, I think that we should have some
idea of what we're talking about. Because I don't
think, maybe I'm wrong, that we're going to get a lot
of people interested in a strike which means people
sitting around in different doorways, very isolated
from each other for hours at a time.
Near the end of the meeting, the Hoover Institution
was still mentioned as an attractive target.
Well, anyway, I was going to suggest that if there is a
rally scheduled for tomorrow or however we are
going to do it, we should probably move from there,
when we'll have a crowd already, and 1 think we
should take over Hoover and that, you know, 1 think
that they wouldn't let us stay too long in Hoover
before they brought pigs on to campus in daytime
and, which would be, you know, a very nice thing to
happen, you know, for the "movement", I think. If
we went to the Comp. Center, first of all 1 don't
think we'd have enough people by tomorrow to go to
the Comp Center and secondly it's pretty far removed
from the central part of campus. Hoover's right in the
center and I think it would be a good thing to do
tomorrow. And we'll be kicked out before 5, but
that's good too.
At the end of the meeting, there was general agree
ment that ways must be found the next day to recruit a
larger group of participants for the "mobile strike,"
whether it would begin at the Computation Center or
elsewhere. Concern was expressed by four speakers that
the number remaining in Dinkelspiel was too small to
permit an effective "mobile strike." This was advanced
as the primary reason for calling a noon rally at White
Plaza on February 10.
A. PREFACE
The climactic events of February 10, on which the
remaining charges focus, did not occur without warning.
Rather, the preceding several days were characterized by
overt turbulence and escalating protest activities. To
understand the events of February 10, it is helpful to
have some background. We therefore now briefly sketch
events which convey the atmosphere of those days and
are pertinent to the remaining charges.
Dissatisfaction with the Indochina war was rising
again because of rumors that an invasion of Laos was
about to begin, perhaps with participation of American
armed forces. In addition, the Stanford Judicial Council
had been holding hearings on charges brought against
students who were accused of disrupting the January
speech of Henry Cabot Lodge. Professor Franklin and
his associates were strongly opposed to these charges and
to the campus judicial system in which they were being
considered.'
B. CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS PRIOR TO FEB
RUARY 10, 1971
On Saturday, February 6, at about 1 a.m., arson was
attempted on the small wooden building known as the
Free Market-the headquarters of the conservative Free
Campus Movement whose members frequently observe
and photograph demonstrations. Later Saturday evening,
at 9:40 p.m., Molotov cocktails were thrown into the
first-floor office of the ROTC building. Three false fire
alarms were registered soon thereafter at scattered points
on campus. Moments earlier, on the other side of the
campus firemen had responded to a fire in a trash barrel
behind Ventura Hall and a false alarm at the Boathouse.
On Sunday, February 7, the invasion of Laos by
South Vietnamese troops with U.S. air support was
officially announced. At 8 p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditori
um a crowd of some 600 persons attended a perfor
mance of the San Francisco Mime Troupe sponsored by
the Stanford Community Against War and Fascism.
Before the Mime Troupe began to perform, it was
announced that Laos had been invaded. A telegram sent
from Ann Arbor, Michigan by Madame Binh, head of the
North Vietnam delegation to the Paris Peace Talks, was
read which called "for mobilizing peace forces in your
country." The Coalition Against the War in Indochina
distributed a flyer entitled "It's Official!! Laos Has Been
Invaded," which spelled out Madame Binh's message in
detail and called for a rally at White Plaza on Monday,
February 8. Leaflets were distributed by a antiwar group
called The Inquisition, demanding that the University

"release all information on the uses of the Computation
Center" and that war research at the Center "immediate
ly be halted." In this leaflet the Stanford Research
Institute computer program known as Gamut-H was
described. The program was said to simulate the logistics
of deployment of helicopters and ships and the leaflet
asserted that the "work is directly applicable in Indo
china."
After the performance, at about 1 0:30 p.m., over 200
persons protesting the Laos invasion broke about 100
windows in several buildings, including the Graduate
School of Business, Undergraduate Library, Post Office,
Engineering Corner, Terman Engineering, Placement
Center, Cubberly Education, Lou Henry Hoover Build
ing, and the Inner Quad. In addition to campus police on
duty, 35 Sheriffs deputies were brought on to campus
briefly after the first reports of property destruction,
but the "trashing" quickly subsided and the deputies
were not deployed. Windows in two Stanford University
police cars were broken when spotlights from one of the
cars were focused on 15-30 demonstrators hurling rocks
into the Lou Henrv Hoover building. Fights broke out
between demonstrators and members of the Free Cam
pus Movement who were attempting to halt the trashing.
The University Computation Center was evacuated at
9:30 p.m. after a telephoned bomb threat was received,
but after a search people re-entered the facility. (This
was not the first threat to the Center. In the spring of
1970, a part of the computer complex in Polya Hall was
the target of arson, but quick action averted serious
damage.)
On Monday, February 8, the noon rally was attended
by about 800 in White Memorial Plaza. The leaflet from
The Inquisition on the SKI war-related computer pro
gram was distributed together with a flyer entitled "Do
It!" "Do It!" encouraged formation of tight affinity
groups to "do whatever actions you feel ready to do"
and stated "last night's action was the first in a scries in
response to the invasion of Laos." It anticipated trouble
with police and with "right wing fascists," and gave
suggestions for handling such trouble.
An "Open Letter to the Stanford Community" from
the Inquisition also became available at about this time.
It stated that the Computation Center was being used by
Stanford Research Institute for "war research." Six
demands were made in the letter, including making
public the identity of all non-Stanford users of Stanford
facilities and phasing out of all Stanford research funded
by the Department of Defense; attached to this letter
was reply made by Provost Miller to some of these
demands.
About 100 antiwar demonstrators left the rally and
then went to the near-empty Faculty Club dining room
searching for members of the Stanford Board of Trus
tees. The group then left for the Graduate School of
Business where at 1:25 p.m. about 150 persons jammed
into the ground level lobby, blocking entry to a room in
which a trustee committee was meeting and holding the
committee virtually under siege for 45 minutes. At 1:45
p.m., C.D. Marron of the Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Department declared it was an unlawful assembly, with
the group chanting back: "Power to the People." The
crowd dispersed when a squad of sheriff's deputies
appeared. One plain-clothesman suffered a head lacera
tion when hit by a thrown rock. At 2:30 p.m. about 24
police dispersed some 300 demonstrators who had re
assembled outside the ground floor of the Graduate
School of Business.
At about 2:45 p.m. part of the group of demonstra
tors headed for the Old Union. About 150 persons
arrived at the courtyard, and 50 of them proceeded into
the Union lobby. A meeting was then called in the
lobby, and the Old Union was selected as a "strike
center." At 5:30 p.m. about 20 Santa Clara Sheriffs
Deputies moved into the rear (West) of the Old Union,
sweeping about 40 remaining occupants into the court
yard. Simultaneously some 15 members of the San Jose
Tactical Squad moved to the front (East) of the Old
Union. At about 5:45 p.m. the San Jose units left the
scene. Subsequently, however, numerous squads of
Santa Clara County and San Jose police patrolled the
campus on foot as well as by car.
On Tuesday, February 9, there was an afternoon
meeting in the Physics Tank, following the Stanford
Judicial Council hearing, in which a "Cambodia-type
strike" protesting the invasion of Laos was planned. In
the evening, beginning at 8 p.m., a three-hour session
was held in Dinkelspiel Auditorium, attended at the
peak by approximately 800 people. A recording of the
meeting taped by KZSU is available, and an analysis of
the speeches at the session is presented in the following
section.
C. ANALYSIS OF THE DINKELSPIEL RALLY
SPEECHES OF FEBRUARY 9, 1971
An important part of the context for the three
speeches of Professor Franklin on February 10th is the
Dinkelspiel rally of February 9th. That lengthy evening
rally did much to set the stage for the events of the
following day. Its recurrent themes mav help in under
standing the meaning of some significant terms used in
the February 10th speeches of Professor Franklin.
Indeed, in the hearing Professor Franklin urged us to
consider this meeting carefully in order to understand
the subsequent events. He participated in the February
9th rally, made a speech there, and was referred to by
several other speakers. [See Appendix I] His leadership
position may reasonably be inferred from the tape of
this meeting.
Many speakers emphasized Stanford's complicity in
the war. They emphasized the necessity of concentrating
protest activity on the campus rather than off it, and
doing so in a powerful way that would impair the
University and hence the war effort.
There were repeated linkages of the war in Southeast
Asia with the struggle at Stanford, particularly in rela
tion to police on campus. The police were referred to as
pigs and were described as an occupation army. Harrass
ment of police was repeatedly advocated. One speaker
indicated that resistance to the occupation army could
best be carried out late at night. Some speakers pictured
the protesters at Stanford as sharing in a common effort
with the people of Southeast Asia, especially the NLF
and Pathet Lao. The following remarks, which were
made early in the rally and echoed later, exemplify this
approach:
What we have found through research and looking at
how the war is carried out is that it is an immensely
technological war and that Stanford is very useful.
And so the only reason that we would attack the
University would be on the grounds of effectiveness,
so I would try to direct the demands toward specific
things in the community and that are attackable like
the computer center, like the Gamut-H program
that's going on there. Also, in the past things like the
A3M have made other movements start so with the
effectiveness here and exemplary action for other
universities we hope to take to close out and down
things which we think are very valuable to the
carrying on of this type of war to make it that much
more costly.
This is followed by another speaker:
I think that we should take the strongest action
possible tomorrow and the next day and the next day
after that. But that we should also be addressing
ourselves to questions of, and the other things we can
begin to move on immediately are some of the
demands that have already been raised like ending the
occupa. . .the armed occupation of this community.
That kind of thing we should begin to move on
immediately.
There were many references to the Computation
Center. It was clearly the object of intense interest, both
for its alleged war complicity and for its vulnerability. It
emerged as the prime target for protest activity. The
discussion of the Computation Center may be illustrated
by a speech in the middle of the meeting:
I'm not even going to talk about a strike. It doesn't
matter either way. But what, I think that it's appa
rent that the place that has to be hit, and has to be
hit hardest and can be hit not only here but in every
college campus and in every city in the country, are
the computer centers, [applause, shouts of 'Right
on'] and they don't have to be hit violently. Com
puter centers are the most vulnerable places any
where. If, you've seen the lights blink every once in a
while with the power shortage, well, if that were to
happen in a computer center for a millisecond, the
computer has to be shut down, and reloaded. And
that's at least an hour delay. Now what does an hour
delay mean to a computer in the computer center?
Well, it could mean just an hour delay. It could mean
a day delay. It could mean a week delay. It could be a
month delay or a year delay, [laughterj. It's, nobody
knows. It's dependent upon what's destroyed in just
that power shortage. What's destroyed in core
storage. What's destroyed as to the records. What
could be destroyed in the tape reserve rooms by the
temperature going too high. Nobody knows.
[Laughter, by speaker and othersl
Other references to the Computation Center included
a variety of ways in which it might be shut down and
put out of service; for example, by blocking access to it
with hundreds or thousands of people, by attacking it,
even by destroying it. Occasionally, a word of caution
was expressed regarding the more violent possibilities.

At various points throughout the meeting, references
to coercive and violent protest activities were received
with applause or laughter. Acts such as seizing and
occupying a building for long periods tended to be
treated casually. Violent acts were sometimes spoken of
explicitly, and sometimes merely hinted at. Audience
response indicated that these hints evoked considerable
interest. Fifteen speakers advocated actions in protest on
the campus that were most likely coercive or violent in
nature. The following speech illustrates the treatment of
coercive behavior.
Yeah, let me straighten that out. I did not advocate
any kind of violence about this computer. I tried to
say that the beauty of the computer center was no
violence is necessary. None at all to get, to get what
you want. Simple little sitting in doorways with a
thousand people, you know, no violence. You don't
have to break a window. Not one single window. And
you can siiil affect problems with this computer
center. Without any destruction whatsoever. So
there's no violence that would be necessary, please.
(Laughter). . .is used by everybody. If you want to
hit industries, you hit the computer that they're
using. That stops them from functioning. But you
have to hit them with enough people to stop normal
access.
Several speakers, notably Braunstein, advocated
action on different levels, violent and non-violent, each
helping the protest movement in his own way. A
spectrum of activities was included, some of which were
clearly coercive and some even overtly violent. Imagina
tion was required to think of ways to disrupt the
functioning of the University and harass the police.
Altogether, six speakers favored pursuing this multi
ple-levels-of-action, approach, embracing a broad spec
trum of protest activities. The general tendency of these
speakers was to favor the more disruptive end of this
range of activities.
The flavor of this approach is well exemplified in the
speech of Braunstein, which is worth quoting in its
entirety.
One thing we've been noted for over the past few
years when we've done any action, and again tonight,
is a lack of imagination. And, you know, I'd like to
address this not to the people in this audience who
know how they're going to vote and are going to
participate in anything, but people listening on radio
wondering what can I do to relate to all this? How
can I help? I'm not willing to get busted in front of
the Computer Center. Or what have you. And there
are many ways, and all you have to do is just think
about it. Last night there were some people out
playing football who kept just dozens of police busy
asking for IDs all the time. At one point they tried to

bring the football into the Computer Center and it
was searched. The football, [applause] Things like
this that tie up the opposing forces, while are not
directly going to end the war in Vietnam, are making
other people's actions become more effective. And
anybody who says "1 can't relate to this movement
because 1 don't agree with your tactics" just has a bad
imagination, and you know, there are many levels of
other action. There are people breaking windows,
there are people who sit in front of the ROTC
building for days, and days, and days, after other
people got tired. These people just were there. They
deserve, you know, our unending thanks. And there
are other people who have done other things, who for
some reason or other don't want to claim credit for
it. All those people also deserve our thanks,
[applause] And. . . . [KZSU interrupts to say speaker
is Yale Braunstein] . . .like the guy who two years
ago drove into a power pole up in Woodside and put
the Computer Center out for a week. Now they've
built an emergency power system, but you know,
there are other actions both violent and non-violent,
imaginative and very mundane, all of which can help
us and everybody, even if you, you object to how the
final vote comes out, should find some way of
keeping them busy in their off hours and should
devote more and more of that time to helping the
Movement, [applause]
As the meeting proceeded, a suggestion made by
Janet Weiss elicited considerable acceptance: to adopt
the tactics of a "mobile strike." The word "strike" was
used often in the meeting. Some of the usage was
unclear, and most of it bore little relation to the usual
meaning of the term in a labor dispute—i.e., the con
certed withholding of labor on a voluntary basis. In the
latter part of the Dinkelspiel rally, consensus grew on
the "mobile strike" or "mobile strike force," as the
meeting's chairman referred to it. The "mobile strike"
was intended to be a series of disruptive acts, hopefully
leading to a total shutdown of the University. Occupa
tion of the Computation Center was considered a good
way to begin. Then, if the occupants were evicted by the
police, another building could be occupied, and then
other actions taken as issues and targets become appa
rent. Nine speakers forcefully advocated a "mobile
strike," clearly including coercive acts within the scope
of such a "strike." Since Janet Weiss' formulation
seemed to be quite influential, it is worth quoting her
remarks on this subject.
I've heard that at some places they've used a tactic of
shutting down one building with a large group of
people, and then going and shutting something else
down so that nothing is shut down continually but

things are shut down, you know a lot of things are,
are shut down at different times, and maybe that's
the kind of strike that would work here, maybe that's
the kind of thing that would keep people doing
something, keep them involved in it, so that you
don't feel like you're just sitting there all day, bored
and cold. 1 think another thing, though, that, one
thing that seems to me is clear that we need, whatever
kind of action we have as a focus, is a lot of other
little peripheral actions, like the actions about people
going out in groups and causing the pigs that are on
the campus to really have to do their jobs. People can
put up signs and posters in bathrooms and buildings,
and things. You see the pigs dont' go into the
buildings, and any number of things that we can do
from inside the building to cause a lot of disruption,
havoc and chaos on the campus, and to keep it from
functioning properly, without really risking a lot of
things and things that might be very pointed. Now
that's the kind of things that I can see in a strike that
would work, but I'd kind of like to, if we're going to
talk about a strike, I think that we should have some
idea of what we're talking about. Because I don't
think, maybe I'm wrong, that we're going to get a lot
of people interested in a strike which means people
sitting around in different doorways, very isolated
from each other for hours at a time.
Near the end of the meeting, the Hoover Institution
was still mentioned as an attractive target.
Well, anyway, I was going to suggest that if there is a
rally scheduled for tomorrow or however we are
going to do it, we should probably move from there,
when we'll have a crowd already, and 1 think we
should take over Hoover and that, you know, 1 think
that they wouldn't let us stay too long in Hoover
before they brought pigs on to campus in daytime
and, which would be, you know, a very nice thing to
happen, you know, for the "movement", I think. If
we went to the Comp. Center, first of all 1 don't
think we'd have enough people by tomorrow to go to
the Comp Center and secondly it's pretty far removed
from the central part of campus. Hoover's right in the
center and I think it would be a good thing to do
tomorrow. And we'll be kicked out before 5, but
that's good too.
At the end of the meeting, there was general agree
ment that ways must be found the next day to recruit a
larger group of participants for the "mobile strike,"
whether it would begin at the Computation Center or
elsewhere. Concern was expressed by four speakers that
the number remaining in Dinkelspiel was too small to
permit an effective "mobile strike." This was advanced
as the primary reason for calling a noon rally at White
Plaza on February 10.
A. PREFACE
The climactic events of February 10, on which the
remaining charges focus, did not occur without warning.
Rather, the preceding several days were characterized by
overt turbulence and escalating protest activities. To
understand the events of February 10, it is helpful to
have some background. We therefore now briefly sketch
events which convey the atmosphere of those days and
are pertinent to the remaining charges.
Dissatisfaction with the Indochina war was rising
again because of rumors that an invasion of Laos was
about to begin, perhaps with participation of American
armed forces. In addition, the Stanford Judicial Council
had been holding hearings on charges brought against
students who were accused of disrupting the January
speech of Henry Cabot Lodge. Professor Franklin and
his associates were strongly opposed to these charges and
to the campus judicial system in which they were being
considered.'
B. CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS PRIOR TO FEB
RUARY 10, 1971
On Saturday, February 6, at about 1 a.m., arson was
attempted on the small wooden building known as the
Free Market-the headquarters of the conservative Free
Campus Movement whose members frequently observe
and photograph demonstrations. Later Saturday evening,
at 9:40 p.m., Molotov cocktails were thrown into the
first-floor office of the ROTC building. Three false fire
alarms were registered soon thereafter at scattered points
on campus. Moments earlier, on the other side of the
campus firemen had responded to a fire in a trash barrel
behind Ventura Hall and a false alarm at the Boathouse.
On Sunday, February 7, the invasion of Laos by
South Vietnamese troops with U.S. air support was
officially announced. At 8 p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditori
um a crowd of some 600 persons attended a perfor
mance of the San Francisco Mime Troupe sponsored by
the Stanford Community Against War and Fascism.
Before the Mime Troupe began to perform, it was
announced that Laos had been invaded. A telegram sent
from Ann Arbor, Michigan by Madame Binh, head of the
North Vietnam delegation to the Paris Peace Talks, was
read which called "for mobilizing peace forces in your
country." The Coalition Against the War in Indochina
distributed a flyer entitled "It's Official!! Laos Has Been
Invaded," which spelled out Madame Binh's message in
detail and called for a rally at White Plaza on Monday,
February 8. Leaflets were distributed by a antiwar group
called The Inquisition, demanding that the University

"release all information on the uses of the Computation
Center" and that war research at the Center "immediate
ly be halted." In this leaflet the Stanford Research
Institute computer program known as Gamut-H was
described. The program was said to simulate the logistics
of deployment of helicopters and ships and the leaflet
asserted that the "work is directly applicable in Indo
china."
After the performance, at about 1 0:30 p.m., over 200
persons protesting the Laos invasion broke about 100
windows in several buildings, including the Graduate
School of Business, Undergraduate Library, Post Office,
Engineering Corner, Terman Engineering, Placement
Center, Cubberly Education, Lou Henry Hoover Build
ing, and the Inner Quad. In addition to campus police on
duty, 35 Sheriffs deputies were brought on to campus
briefly after the first reports of property destruction,
but the "trashing" quickly subsided and the deputies
were not deployed. Windows in two Stanford University
police cars were broken when spotlights from one of the
cars were focused on 15-30 demonstrators hurling rocks
into the Lou Henrv Hoover building. Fights broke out
between demonstrators and members of the Free Cam
pus Movement who were attempting to halt the trashing.
The University Computation Center was evacuated at
9:30 p.m. after a telephoned bomb threat was received,
but after a search people re-entered the facility. (This
was not the first threat to the Center. In the spring of
1970, a part of the computer complex in Polya Hall was
the target of arson, but quick action averted serious
damage.)
On Monday, February 8, the noon rally was attended
by about 800 in White Memorial Plaza. The leaflet from
The Inquisition on the SKI war-related computer pro
gram was distributed together with a flyer entitled "Do
It!" "Do It!" encouraged formation of tight affinity
groups to "do whatever actions you feel ready to do"
and stated "last night's action was the first in a scries in
response to the invasion of Laos." It anticipated trouble
with police and with "right wing fascists," and gave
suggestions for handling such trouble.
An "Open Letter to the Stanford Community" from
the Inquisition also became available at about this time.
It stated that the Computation Center was being used by
Stanford Research Institute for "war research." Six
demands were made in the letter, including making
public the identity of all non-Stanford users of Stanford
facilities and phasing out of all Stanford research funded
by the Department of Defense; attached to this letter
was reply made by Provost Miller to some of these
demands.
About 100 antiwar demonstrators left the rally and
then went to the near-empty Faculty Club dining room
searching for members of the Stanford Board of Trus
tees. The group then left for the Graduate School of
Business where at 1:25 p.m. about 150 persons jammed
into the ground level lobby, blocking entry to a room in
which a trustee committee was meeting and holding the
committee virtually under siege for 45 minutes. At 1:45
p.m., C.D. Marron of the Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Department declared it was an unlawful assembly, with
the group chanting back: "Power to the People." The
crowd dispersed when a squad of sheriff's deputies
appeared. One plain-clothesman suffered a head lacera
tion when hit by a thrown rock. At 2:30 p.m. about 24
police dispersed some 300 demonstrators who had re
assembled outside the ground floor of the Graduate
School of Business.
At about 2:45 p.m. part of the group of demonstra
tors headed for the Old Union. About 150 persons
arrived at the courtyard, and 50 of them proceeded into
the Union lobby. A meeting was then called in the
lobby, and the Old Union was selected as a "strike
center." At 5:30 p.m. about 20 Santa Clara Sheriffs
Deputies moved into the rear (West) of the Old Union,
sweeping about 40 remaining occupants into the court
yard. Simultaneously some 15 members of the San Jose
Tactical Squad moved to the front (East) of the Old
Union. At about 5:45 p.m. the San Jose units left the
scene. Subsequently, however, numerous squads of
Santa Clara County and San Jose police patrolled the
campus on foot as well as by car.
On Tuesday, February 9, there was an afternoon
meeting in the Physics Tank, following the Stanford
Judicial Council hearing, in which a "Cambodia-type
strike" protesting the invasion of Laos was planned. In
the evening, beginning at 8 p.m., a three-hour session
was held in Dinkelspiel Auditorium, attended at the
peak by approximately 800 people. A recording of the
meeting taped by KZSU is available, and an analysis of
the speeches at the session is presented in the following
section.
C. ANALYSIS OF THE DINKELSPIEL RALLY
SPEECHES OF FEBRUARY 9, 1971
An important part of the context for the three
speeches of Professor Franklin on February 10th is the
Dinkelspiel rally of February 9th. That lengthy evening
rally did much to set the stage for the events of the
following day. Its recurrent themes mav help in under
standing the meaning of some significant terms used in
the February 10th speeches of Professor Franklin.
Indeed, in the hearing Professor Franklin urged us to
consider this meeting carefully in order to understand
the subsequent events. He participated in the February
9th rally, made a speech there, and was referred to by
several other speakers. [See Appendix I] His leadership
position may reasonably be inferred from the tape of
this meeting.
Many speakers emphasized Stanford's complicity in
the war. They emphasized the necessity of concentrating
protest activity on the campus rather than off it, and
doing so in a powerful way that would impair the
University and hence the war effort.
There were repeated linkages of the war in Southeast
Asia with the struggle at Stanford, particularly in rela
tion to police on campus. The police were referred to as
pigs and were described as an occupation army. Harrass
ment of police was repeatedly advocated. One speaker
indicated that resistance to the occupation army could
best be carried out late at night. Some speakers pictured
the protesters at Stanford as sharing in a common effort
with the people of Southeast Asia, especially the NLF
and Pathet Lao. The following remarks, which were
made early in the rally and echoed later, exemplify this
approach:
What we have found through research and looking at
how the war is carried out is that it is an immensely
technological war and that Stanford is very useful.
And so the only reason that we would attack the
University would be on the grounds of effectiveness,
so I would try to direct the demands toward specific
things in the community and that are attackable like
the computer center, like the Gamut-H program
that's going on there. Also, in the past things like the
A3M have made other movements start so with the
effectiveness here and exemplary action for other
universities we hope to take to close out and down
things which we think are very valuable to the
carrying on of this type of war to make it that much
more costly.
This is followed by another speaker:
I think that we should take the strongest action
possible tomorrow and the next day and the next day
after that. But that we should also be addressing
ourselves to questions of, and the other things we can
begin to move on immediately are some of the
demands that have already been raised like ending the
occupa. . .the armed occupation of this community.
That kind of thing we should begin to move on
immediately.
There were many references to the Computation
Center. It was clearly the object of intense interest, both
for its alleged war complicity and for its vulnerability. It
emerged as the prime target for protest activity. The
discussion of the Computation Center may be illustrated
by a speech in the middle of the meeting:
I'm not even going to talk about a strike. It doesn't
matter either way. But what, I think that it's appa
rent that the place that has to be hit, and has to be
hit hardest and can be hit not only here but in every
college campus and in every city in the country, are
the computer centers, [applause, shouts of 'Right
on'] and they don't have to be hit violently. Com
puter centers are the most vulnerable places any
where. If, you've seen the lights blink every once in a
while with the power shortage, well, if that were to
happen in a computer center for a millisecond, the
computer has to be shut down, and reloaded. And
that's at least an hour delay. Now what does an hour
delay mean to a computer in the computer center?
Well, it could mean just an hour delay. It could mean
a day delay. It could mean a week delay. It could be a
month delay or a year delay, [laughterj. It's, nobody
knows. It's dependent upon what's destroyed in just
that power shortage. What's destroyed in core
storage. What's destroyed as to the records. What
could be destroyed in the tape reserve rooms by the
temperature going too high. Nobody knows.
[Laughter, by speaker and othersl
Other references to the Computation Center included
a variety of ways in which it might be shut down and
put out of service; for example, by blocking access to it
with hundreds or thousands of people, by attacking it,
even by destroying it. Occasionally, a word of caution
was expressed regarding the more violent possibilities.

At various points throughout the meeting, references
to coercive and violent protest activities were received
with applause or laughter. Acts such as seizing and
occupying a building for long periods tended to be
treated casually. Violent acts were sometimes spoken of
explicitly, and sometimes merely hinted at. Audience
response indicated that these hints evoked considerable
interest. Fifteen speakers advocated actions in protest on
the campus that were most likely coercive or violent in
nature. The following speech illustrates the treatment of
coercive behavior.
Yeah, let me straighten that out. I did not advocate
any kind of violence about this computer. I tried to
say that the beauty of the computer center was no
violence is necessary. None at all to get, to get what
you want. Simple little sitting in doorways with a
thousand people, you know, no violence. You don't
have to break a window. Not one single window. And
you can siiil affect problems with this computer
center. Without any destruction whatsoever. So
there's no violence that would be necessary, please.
(Laughter). . .is used by everybody. If you want to
hit industries, you hit the computer that they're
using. That stops them from functioning. But you
have to hit them with enough people to stop normal
access.
Several speakers, notably Braunstein, advocated
action on different levels, violent and non-violent, each
helping the protest movement in his own way. A
spectrum of activities was included, some of which were
clearly coercive and some even overtly violent. Imagina
tion was required to think of ways to disrupt the
functioning of the University and harass the police.
Altogether, six speakers favored pursuing this multi
ple-levels-of-action, approach, embracing a broad spec
trum of protest activities. The general tendency of these
speakers was to favor the more disruptive end of this
range of activities.
The flavor of this approach is well exemplified in the
speech of Braunstein, which is worth quoting in its
entirety.
One thing we've been noted for over the past few
years when we've done any action, and again tonight,
is a lack of imagination. And, you know, I'd like to
address this not to the people in this audience who
know how they're going to vote and are going to
participate in anything, but people listening on radio
wondering what can I do to relate to all this? How
can I help? I'm not willing to get busted in front of
the Computer Center. Or what have you. And there
are many ways, and all you have to do is just think
about it. Last night there were some people out
playing football who kept just dozens of police busy
asking for IDs all the time. At one point they tried to

bring the football into the Computer Center and it
was searched. The football, [applause] Things like
this that tie up the opposing forces, while are not
directly going to end the war in Vietnam, are making
other people's actions become more effective. And
anybody who says "1 can't relate to this movement
because 1 don't agree with your tactics" just has a bad
imagination, and you know, there are many levels of
other action. There are people breaking windows,
there are people who sit in front of the ROTC
building for days, and days, and days, after other
people got tired. These people just were there. They
deserve, you know, our unending thanks. And there
are other people who have done other things, who for
some reason or other don't want to claim credit for
it. All those people also deserve our thanks,
[applause] And. . . . [KZSU interrupts to say speaker
is Yale Braunstein] . . .like the guy who two years
ago drove into a power pole up in Woodside and put
the Computer Center out for a week. Now they've
built an emergency power system, but you know,
there are other actions both violent and non-violent,
imaginative and very mundane, all of which can help
us and everybody, even if you, you object to how the
final vote comes out, should find some way of
keeping them busy in their off hours and should
devote more and more of that time to helping the
Movement, [applause]
As the meeting proceeded, a suggestion made by
Janet Weiss elicited considerable acceptance: to adopt
the tactics of a "mobile strike." The word "strike" was
used often in the meeting. Some of the usage was
unclear, and most of it bore little relation to the usual
meaning of the term in a labor dispute—i.e., the con
certed withholding of labor on a voluntary basis. In the
latter part of the Dinkelspiel rally, consensus grew on
the "mobile strike" or "mobile strike force," as the
meeting's chairman referred to it. The "mobile strike"
was intended to be a series of disruptive acts, hopefully
leading to a total shutdown of the University. Occupa
tion of the Computation Center was considered a good
way to begin. Then, if the occupants were evicted by the
police, another building could be occupied, and then
other actions taken as issues and targets become appa
rent. Nine speakers forcefully advocated a "mobile
strike," clearly including coercive acts within the scope
of such a "strike." Since Janet Weiss' formulation
seemed to be quite influential, it is worth quoting her
remarks on this subject.
I've heard that at some places they've used a tactic of
shutting down one building with a large group of
people, and then going and shutting something else
down so that nothing is shut down continually but

things are shut down, you know a lot of things are,
are shut down at different times, and maybe that's
the kind of strike that would work here, maybe that's
the kind of thing that would keep people doing
something, keep them involved in it, so that you
don't feel like you're just sitting there all day, bored
and cold. 1 think another thing, though, that, one
thing that seems to me is clear that we need, whatever
kind of action we have as a focus, is a lot of other
little peripheral actions, like the actions about people
going out in groups and causing the pigs that are on
the campus to really have to do their jobs. People can
put up signs and posters in bathrooms and buildings,
and things. You see the pigs dont' go into the
buildings, and any number of things that we can do
from inside the building to cause a lot of disruption,
havoc and chaos on the campus, and to keep it from
functioning properly, without really risking a lot of
things and things that might be very pointed. Now
that's the kind of things that I can see in a strike that
would work, but I'd kind of like to, if we're going to
talk about a strike, I think that we should have some
idea of what we're talking about. Because I don't
think, maybe I'm wrong, that we're going to get a lot
of people interested in a strike which means people
sitting around in different doorways, very isolated
from each other for hours at a time.
Near the end of the meeting, the Hoover Institution
was still mentioned as an attractive target.
Well, anyway, I was going to suggest that if there is a
rally scheduled for tomorrow or however we are
going to do it, we should probably move from there,
when we'll have a crowd already, and 1 think we
should take over Hoover and that, you know, 1 think
that they wouldn't let us stay too long in Hoover
before they brought pigs on to campus in daytime
and, which would be, you know, a very nice thing to
happen, you know, for the "movement", I think. If
we went to the Comp. Center, first of all 1 don't
think we'd have enough people by tomorrow to go to
the Comp Center and secondly it's pretty far removed
from the central part of campus. Hoover's right in the
center and I think it would be a good thing to do
tomorrow. And we'll be kicked out before 5, but
that's good too.
At the end of the meeting, there was general agree
ment that ways must be found the next day to recruit a
larger group of participants for the "mobile strike,"
whether it would begin at the Computation Center or
elsewhere. Concern was expressed by four speakers that
the number remaining in Dinkelspiel was too small to
permit an effective "mobile strike." This was advanced
as the primary reason for calling a noon rally at White
Plaza on February 10.
A. PREFACE
The climactic events of February 10, on which the
remaining charges focus, did not occur without warning.
Rather, the preceding several days were characterized by
overt turbulence and escalating protest activities. To
understand the events of February 10, it is helpful to
have some background. We therefore now briefly sketch
events which convey the atmosphere of those days and
are pertinent to the remaining charges.
Dissatisfaction with the Indochina war was rising
again because of rumors that an invasion of Laos was
about to begin, perhaps with participation of American
armed forces. In addition, the Stanford Judicial Council
had been holding hearings on charges brought against
students who were accused of disrupting the January
speech of Henry Cabot Lodge. Professor Franklin and
his associates were strongly opposed to these charges and
to the campus judicial system in which they were being
considered.'
B. CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS PRIOR TO FEB
RUARY 10, 1971
On Saturday, February 6, at about 1 a.m., arson was
attempted on the small wooden building known as the
Free Market-the headquarters of the conservative Free
Campus Movement whose members frequently observe
and photograph demonstrations. Later Saturday evening,
at 9:40 p.m., Molotov cocktails were thrown into the
first-floor office of the ROTC building. Three false fire
alarms were registered soon thereafter at scattered points
on campus. Moments earlier, on the other side of the
campus firemen had responded to a fire in a trash barrel
behind Ventura Hall and a false alarm at the Boathouse.
On Sunday, February 7, the invasion of Laos by
South Vietnamese troops with U.S. air support was
officially announced. At 8 p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditori
um a crowd of some 600 persons attended a perfor
mance of the San Francisco Mime Troupe sponsored by
the Stanford Community Against War and Fascism.
Before the Mime Troupe began to perform, it was
announced that Laos had been invaded. A telegram sent
from Ann Arbor, Michigan by Madame Binh, head of the
North Vietnam delegation to the Paris Peace Talks, was
read which called "for mobilizing peace forces in your
country." The Coalition Against the War in Indochina
distributed a flyer entitled "It's Official!! Laos Has Been
Invaded," which spelled out Madame Binh's message in
detail and called for a rally at White Plaza on Monday,
February 8. Leaflets were distributed by a antiwar group
called The Inquisition, demanding that the University

"release all information on the uses of the Computation
Center" and that war research at the Center "immediate
ly be halted." In this leaflet the Stanford Research
Institute computer program known as Gamut-H was
described. The program was said to simulate the logistics
of deployment of helicopters and ships and the leaflet
asserted that the "work is directly applicable in Indo
china."
After the performance, at about 1 0:30 p.m., over 200
persons protesting the Laos invasion broke about 100
windows in several buildings, including the Graduate
School of Business, Undergraduate Library, Post Office,
Engineering Corner, Terman Engineering, Placement
Center, Cubberly Education, Lou Henry Hoover Build
ing, and the Inner Quad. In addition to campus police on
duty, 35 Sheriffs deputies were brought on to campus
briefly after the first reports of property destruction,
but the "trashing" quickly subsided and the deputies
were not deployed. Windows in two Stanford University
police cars were broken when spotlights from one of the
cars were focused on 15-30 demonstrators hurling rocks
into the Lou Henrv Hoover building. Fights broke out
between demonstrators and members of the Free Cam
pus Movement who were attempting to halt the trashing.
The University Computation Center was evacuated at
9:30 p.m. after a telephoned bomb threat was received,
but after a search people re-entered the facility. (This
was not the first threat to the Center. In the spring of
1970, a part of the computer complex in Polya Hall was
the target of arson, but quick action averted serious
damage.)
On Monday, February 8, the noon rally was attended
by about 800 in White Memorial Plaza. The leaflet from
The Inquisition on the SKI war-related computer pro
gram was distributed together with a flyer entitled "Do
It!" "Do It!" encouraged formation of tight affinity
groups to "do whatever actions you feel ready to do"
and stated "last night's action was the first in a scries in
response to the invasion of Laos." It anticipated trouble
with police and with "right wing fascists," and gave
suggestions for handling such trouble.
An "Open Letter to the Stanford Community" from
the Inquisition also became available at about this time.
It stated that the Computation Center was being used by
Stanford Research Institute for "war research." Six
demands were made in the letter, including making
public the identity of all non-Stanford users of Stanford
facilities and phasing out of all Stanford research funded
by the Department of Defense; attached to this letter
was reply made by Provost Miller to some of these
demands.
About 100 antiwar demonstrators left the rally and
then went to the near-empty Faculty Club dining room
searching for members of the Stanford Board of Trus
tees. The group then left for the Graduate School of
Business where at 1:25 p.m. about 150 persons jammed
into the ground level lobby, blocking entry to a room in
which a trustee committee was meeting and holding the
committee virtually under siege for 45 minutes. At 1:45
p.m., C.D. Marron of the Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Department declared it was an unlawful assembly, with
the group chanting back: "Power to the People." The
crowd dispersed when a squad of sheriff's deputies
appeared. One plain-clothesman suffered a head lacera
tion when hit by a thrown rock. At 2:30 p.m. about 24
police dispersed some 300 demonstrators who had re
assembled outside the ground floor of the Graduate
School of Business.
At about 2:45 p.m. part of the group of demonstra
tors headed for the Old Union. About 150 persons
arrived at the courtyard, and 50 of them proceeded into
the Union lobby. A meeting was then called in the
lobby, and the Old Union was selected as a "strike
center." At 5:30 p.m. about 20 Santa Clara Sheriffs
Deputies moved into the rear (West) of the Old Union,
sweeping about 40 remaining occupants into the court
yard. Simultaneously some 15 members of the San Jose
Tactical Squad moved to the front (East) of the Old
Union. At about 5:45 p.m. the San Jose units left the
scene. Subsequently, however, numerous squads of
Santa Clara County and San Jose police patrolled the
campus on foot as well as by car.
On Tuesday, February 9, there was an afternoon
meeting in the Physics Tank, following the Stanford
Judicial Council hearing, in which a "Cambodia-type
strike" protesting the invasion of Laos was planned. In
the evening, beginning at 8 p.m., a three-hour session
was held in Dinkelspiel Auditorium, attended at the
peak by approximately 800 people. A recording of the
meeting taped by KZSU is available, and an analysis of
the speeches at the session is presented in the following
section.
C. ANALYSIS OF THE DINKELSPIEL RALLY
SPEECHES OF FEBRUARY 9, 1971
An important part of the context for the three
speeches of Professor Franklin on February 10th is the
Dinkelspiel rally of February 9th. That lengthy evening
rally did much to set the stage for the events of the
following day. Its recurrent themes mav help in under
standing the meaning of some significant terms used in
the February 10th speeches of Professor Franklin.
Indeed, in the hearing Professor Franklin urged us to
consider this meeting carefully in order to understand
the subsequent events. He participated in the February
9th rally, made a speech there, and was referred to by
several other speakers. [See Appendix I] His leadership
position may reasonably be inferred from the tape of
this meeting.
Many speakers emphasized Stanford's complicity in
the war. They emphasized the necessity of concentrating
protest activity on the campus rather than off it, and
doing so in a powerful way that would impair the
University and hence the war effort.
There were repeated linkages of the war in Southeast
Asia with the struggle at Stanford, particularly in rela
tion to police on campus. The police were referred to as
pigs and were described as an occupation army. Harrass
ment of police was repeatedly advocated. One speaker
indicated that resistance to the occupation army could
best be carried out late at night. Some speakers pictured
the protesters at Stanford as sharing in a common effort
with the people of Southeast Asia, especially the NLF
and Pathet Lao. The following remarks, which were
made early in the rally and echoed later, exemplify this
approach:
What we have found through research and looking at
how the war is carried out is that it is an immensely
technological war and that Stanford is very useful.
And so the only reason that we would attack the
University would be on the grounds of effectiveness,
so I would try to direct the demands toward specific
things in the community and that are attackable like
the computer center, like the Gamut-H program
that's going on there. Also, in the past things like the
A3M have made other movements start so with the
effectiveness here and exemplary action for other
universities we hope to take to close out and down
things which we think are very valuable to the
carrying on of this type of war to make it that much
more costly.
This is followed by another speaker:
I think that we should take the strongest action
possible tomorrow and the next day and the next day
after that. But that we should also be addressing
ourselves to questions of, and the other things we can
begin to move on immediately are some of the
demands that have already been raised like ending the
occupa. . .the armed occupation of this community.
That kind of thing we should begin to move on
immediately.
There were many references to the Computation
Center. It was clearly the object of intense interest, both
for its alleged war complicity and for its vulnerability. It
emerged as the prime target for protest activity. The
discussion of the Computation Center may be illustrated
by a speech in the middle of the meeting:
I'm not even going to talk about a strike. It doesn't
matter either way. But what, I think that it's appa
rent that the place that has to be hit, and has to be
hit hardest and can be hit not only here but in every
college campus and in every city in the country, are
the computer centers, [applause, shouts of 'Right
on'] and they don't have to be hit violently. Com
puter centers are the most vulnerable places any
where. If, you've seen the lights blink every once in a
while with the power shortage, well, if that were to
happen in a computer center for a millisecond, the
computer has to be shut down, and reloaded. And
that's at least an hour delay. Now what does an hour
delay mean to a computer in the computer center?
Well, it could mean just an hour delay. It could mean
a day delay. It could mean a week delay. It could be a
month delay or a year delay, [laughterj. It's, nobody
knows. It's dependent upon what's destroyed in just
that power shortage. What's destroyed in core
storage. What's destroyed as to the records. What
could be destroyed in the tape reserve rooms by the
temperature going too high. Nobody knows.
[Laughter, by speaker and othersl
Other references to the Computation Center included
a variety of ways in which it might be shut down and
put out of service; for example, by blocking access to it
with hundreds or thousands of people, by attacking it,
even by destroying it. Occasionally, a word of caution
was expressed regarding the more violent possibilities.

At various points throughout the meeting, references
to coercive and violent protest activities were received
with applause or laughter. Acts such as seizing and
occupying a building for long periods tended to be
treated casually. Violent acts were sometimes spoken of
explicitly, and sometimes merely hinted at. Audience
response indicated that these hints evoked considerable
interest. Fifteen speakers advocated actions in protest on
the campus that were most likely coercive or violent in
nature. The following speech illustrates the treatment of
coercive behavior.
Yeah, let me straighten that out. I did not advocate
any kind of violence about this computer. I tried to
say that the beauty of the computer center was no
violence is necessary. None at all to get, to get what
you want. Simple little sitting in doorways with a
thousand people, you know, no violence. You don't
have to break a window. Not one single window. And
you can siiil affect problems with this computer
center. Without any destruction whatsoever. So
there's no violence that would be necessary, please.
(Laughter). . .is used by everybody. If you want to
hit industries, you hit the computer that they're
using. That stops them from functioning. But you
have to hit them with enough people to stop normal
access.
Several speakers, notably Braunstein, advocated
action on different levels, violent and non-violent, each
helping the protest movement in his own way. A
spectrum of activities was included, some of which were
clearly coercive and some even overtly violent. Imagina
tion was required to think of ways to disrupt the
functioning of the University and harass the police.
Altogether, six speakers favored pursuing this multi
ple-levels-of-action, approach, embracing a broad spec
trum of protest activities. The general tendency of these
speakers was to favor the more disruptive end of this
range of activities.
The flavor of this approach is well exemplified in the
speech of Braunstein, which is worth quoting in its
entirety.
One thing we've been noted for over the past few
years when we've done any action, and again tonight,
is a lack of imagination. And, you know, I'd like to
address this not to the people in this audience who
know how they're going to vote and are going to
participate in anything, but people listening on radio
wondering what can I do to relate to all this? How
can I help? I'm not willing to get busted in front of
the Computer Center. Or what have you. And there
are many ways, and all you have to do is just think
about it. Last night there were some people out
playing football who kept just dozens of police busy
asking for IDs all the time. At one point they tried to

bring the football into the Computer Center and it
was searched. The football, [applause] Things like
this that tie up the opposing forces, while are not
directly going to end the war in Vietnam, are making
other people's actions become more effective. And
anybody who says "1 can't relate to this movement
because 1 don't agree with your tactics" just has a bad
imagination, and you know, there are many levels of
other action. There are people breaking windows,
there are people who sit in front of the ROTC
building for days, and days, and days, after other
people got tired. These people just were there. They
deserve, you know, our unending thanks. And there
are other people who have done other things, who for
some reason or other don't want to claim credit for
it. All those people also deserve our thanks,
[applause] And. . . . [KZSU interrupts to say speaker
is Yale Braunstein] . . .like the guy who two years
ago drove into a power pole up in Woodside and put
the Computer Center out for a week. Now they've
built an emergency power system, but you know,
there are other actions both violent and non-violent,
imaginative and very mundane, all of which can help
us and everybody, even if you, you object to how the
final vote comes out, should find some way of
keeping them busy in their off hours and should
devote more and more of that time to helping the
Movement, [applause]
As the meeting proceeded, a suggestion made by
Janet Weiss elicited considerable acceptance: to adopt
the tactics of a "mobile strike." The word "strike" was
used often in the meeting. Some of the usage was
unclear, and most of it bore little relation to the usual
meaning of the term in a labor dispute—i.e., the con
certed withholding of labor on a voluntary basis. In the
latter part of the Dinkelspiel rally, consensus grew on
the "mobile strike" or "mobile strike force," as the
meeting's chairman referred to it. The "mobile strike"
was intended to be a series of disruptive acts, hopefully
leading to a total shutdown of the University. Occupa
tion of the Computation Center was considered a good
way to begin. Then, if the occupants were evicted by the
police, another building could be occupied, and then
other actions taken as issues and targets become appa
rent. Nine speakers forcefully advocated a "mobile
strike," clearly including coercive acts within the scope
of such a "strike." Since Janet Weiss' formulation
seemed to be quite influential, it is worth quoting her
remarks on this subject.
I've heard that at some places they've used a tactic of
shutting down one building with a large group of
people, and then going and shutting something else
down so that nothing is shut down continually but

things are shut down, you know a lot of things are,
are shut down at different times, and maybe that's
the kind of strike that would work here, maybe that's
the kind of thing that would keep people doing
something, keep them involved in it, so that you
don't feel like you're just sitting there all day, bored
and cold. 1 think another thing, though, that, one
thing that seems to me is clear that we need, whatever
kind of action we have as a focus, is a lot of other
little peripheral actions, like the actions about people
going out in groups and causing the pigs that are on
the campus to really have to do their jobs. People can
put up signs and posters in bathrooms and buildings,
and things. You see the pigs dont' go into the
buildings, and any number of things that we can do
from inside the building to cause a lot of disruption,
havoc and chaos on the campus, and to keep it from
functioning properly, without really risking a lot of
things and things that might be very pointed. Now
that's the kind of things that I can see in a strike that
would work, but I'd kind of like to, if we're going to
talk about a strike, I think that we should have some
idea of what we're talking about. Because I don't
think, maybe I'm wrong, that we're going to get a lot
of people interested in a strike which means people
sitting around in different doorways, very isolated
from each other for hours at a time.
Near the end of the meeting, the Hoover Institution
was still mentioned as an attractive target.
Well, anyway, I was going to suggest that if there is a
rally scheduled for tomorrow or however we are
going to do it, we should probably move from there,
when we'll have a crowd already, and 1 think we
should take over Hoover and that, you know, 1 think
that they wouldn't let us stay too long in Hoover
before they brought pigs on to campus in daytime
and, which would be, you know, a very nice thing to
happen, you know, for the "movement", I think. If
we went to the Comp. Center, first of all 1 don't
think we'd have enough people by tomorrow to go to
the Comp Center and secondly it's pretty far removed
from the central part of campus. Hoover's right in the
center and I think it would be a good thing to do
tomorrow. And we'll be kicked out before 5, but
that's good too.
At the end of the meeting, there was general agree
ment that ways must be found the next day to recruit a
larger group of participants for the "mobile strike,"
whether it would begin at the Computation Center or
elsewhere. Concern was expressed by four speakers that
the number remaining in Dinkelspiel was too small to
permit an effective "mobile strike." This was advanced
as the primary reason for calling a noon rally at White
Plaza on February 10.
A. PREFACE
The climactic events of February 10, on which the
remaining charges focus, did not occur without warning.
Rather, the preceding several days were characterized by
overt turbulence and escalating protest activities. To
understand the events of February 10, it is helpful to
have some background. We therefore now briefly sketch
events which convey the atmosphere of those days and
are pertinent to the remaining charges.
Dissatisfaction with the Indochina war was rising
again because of rumors that an invasion of Laos was
about to begin, perhaps with participation of American
armed forces. In addition, the Stanford Judicial Council
had been holding hearings on charges brought against
students who were accused of disrupting the January
speech of Henry Cabot Lodge. Professor Franklin and
his associates were strongly opposed to these charges and
to the campus judicial system in which they were being
considered.'
B. CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS PRIOR TO FEB
RUARY 10, 1971
On Saturday, February 6, at about 1 a.m., arson was
attempted on the small wooden building known as the
Free Market-the headquarters of the conservative Free
Campus Movement whose members frequently observe
and photograph demonstrations. Later Saturday evening,
at 9:40 p.m., Molotov cocktails were thrown into the
first-floor office of the ROTC building. Three false fire
alarms were registered soon thereafter at scattered points
on campus. Moments earlier, on the other side of the
campus firemen had responded to a fire in a trash barrel
behind Ventura Hall and a false alarm at the Boathouse.
On Sunday, February 7, the invasion of Laos by
South Vietnamese troops with U.S. air support was
officially announced. At 8 p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditori
um a crowd of some 600 persons attended a perfor
mance of the San Francisco Mime Troupe sponsored by
the Stanford Community Against War and Fascism.
Before the Mime Troupe began to perform, it was
announced that Laos had been invaded. A telegram sent
from Ann Arbor, Michigan by Madame Binh, head of the
North Vietnam delegation to the Paris Peace Talks, was
read which called "for mobilizing peace forces in your
country." The Coalition Against the War in Indochina
distributed a flyer entitled "It's Official!! Laos Has Been
Invaded," which spelled out Madame Binh's message in
detail and called for a rally at White Plaza on Monday,
February 8. Leaflets were distributed by a antiwar group
called The Inquisition, demanding that the University

"release all information on the uses of the Computation
Center" and that war research at the Center "immediate
ly be halted." In this leaflet the Stanford Research
Institute computer program known as Gamut-H was
described. The program was said to simulate the logistics
of deployment of helicopters and ships and the leaflet
asserted that the "work is directly applicable in Indo
china."
After the performance, at about 1 0:30 p.m., over 200
persons protesting the Laos invasion broke about 100
windows in several buildings, including the Graduate
School of Business, Undergraduate Library, Post Office,
Engineering Corner, Terman Engineering, Placement
Center, Cubberly Education, Lou Henry Hoover Build
ing, and the Inner Quad. In addition to campus police on
duty, 35 Sheriffs deputies were brought on to campus
briefly after the first reports of property destruction,
but the "trashing" quickly subsided and the deputies
were not deployed. Windows in two Stanford University
police cars were broken when spotlights from one of the
cars were focused on 15-30 demonstrators hurling rocks
into the Lou Henrv Hoover building. Fights broke out
between demonstrators and members of the Free Cam
pus Movement who were attempting to halt the trashing.
The University Computation Center was evacuated at
9:30 p.m. after a telephoned bomb threat was received,
but after a search people re-entered the facility. (This
was not the first threat to the Center. In the spring of
1970, a part of the computer complex in Polya Hall was
the target of arson, but quick action averted serious
damage.)
On Monday, February 8, the noon rally was attended
by about 800 in White Memorial Plaza. The leaflet from
The Inquisition on the SKI war-related computer pro
gram was distributed together with a flyer entitled "Do
It!" "Do It!" encouraged formation of tight affinity
groups to "do whatever actions you feel ready to do"
and stated "last night's action was the first in a scries in
response to the invasion of Laos." It anticipated trouble
with police and with "right wing fascists," and gave
suggestions for handling such trouble.
An "Open Letter to the Stanford Community" from
the Inquisition also became available at about this time.
It stated that the Computation Center was being used by
Stanford Research Institute for "war research." Six
demands were made in the letter, including making
public the identity of all non-Stanford users of Stanford
facilities and phasing out of all Stanford research funded
by the Department of Defense; attached to this letter
was reply made by Provost Miller to some of these
demands.
About 100 antiwar demonstrators left the rally and
then went to the near-empty Faculty Club dining room
searching for members of the Stanford Board of Trus
tees. The group then left for the Graduate School of
Business where at 1:25 p.m. about 150 persons jammed
into the ground level lobby, blocking entry to a room in
which a trustee committee was meeting and holding the
committee virtually under siege for 45 minutes. At 1:45
p.m., C.D. Marron of the Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Department declared it was an unlawful assembly, with
the group chanting back: "Power to the People." The
crowd dispersed when a squad of sheriff's deputies
appeared. One plain-clothesman suffered a head lacera
tion when hit by a thrown rock. At 2:30 p.m. about 24
police dispersed some 300 demonstrators who had re
assembled outside the ground floor of the Graduate
School of Business.
At about 2:45 p.m. part of the group of demonstra
tors headed for the Old Union. About 150 persons
arrived at the courtyard, and 50 of them proceeded into
the Union lobby. A meeting was then called in the
lobby, and the Old Union was selected as a "strike
center." At 5:30 p.m. about 20 Santa Clara Sheriffs
Deputies moved into the rear (West) of the Old Union,
sweeping about 40 remaining occupants into the court
yard. Simultaneously some 15 members of the San Jose
Tactical Squad moved to the front (East) of the Old
Union. At about 5:45 p.m. the San Jose units left the
scene. Subsequently, however, numerous squads of
Santa Clara County and San Jose police patrolled the
campus on foot as well as by car.
On Tuesday, February 9, there was an afternoon
meeting in the Physics Tank, following the Stanford
Judicial Council hearing, in which a "Cambodia-type
strike" protesting the invasion of Laos was planned. In
the evening, beginning at 8 p.m., a three-hour session
was held in Dinkelspiel Auditorium, attended at the
peak by approximately 800 people. A recording of the
meeting taped by KZSU is available, and an analysis of
the speeches at the session is presented in the following
section.
C. ANALYSIS OF THE DINKELSPIEL RALLY
SPEECHES OF FEBRUARY 9, 1971
An important part of the context for the three
speeches of Professor Franklin on February 10th is the
Dinkelspiel rally of February 9th. That lengthy evening
rally did much to set the stage for the events of the
following day. Its recurrent themes mav help in under
standing the meaning of some significant terms used in
the February 10th speeches of Professor Franklin.
Indeed, in the hearing Professor Franklin urged us to
consider this meeting carefully in order to understand
the subsequent events. He participated in the February
9th rally, made a speech there, and was referred to by
several other speakers. [See Appendix I] His leadership
position may reasonably be inferred from the tape of
this meeting.
Many speakers emphasized Stanford's complicity in
the war. They emphasized the necessity of concentrating
protest activity on the campus rather than off it, and
doing so in a powerful way that would impair the
University and hence the war effort.
There were repeated linkages of the war in Southeast
Asia with the struggle at Stanford, particularly in rela
tion to police on campus. The police were referred to as
pigs and were described as an occupation army. Harrass
ment of police was repeatedly advocated. One speaker
indicated that resistance to the occupation army could
best be carried out late at night. Some speakers pictured
the protesters at Stanford as sharing in a common effort
with the people of Southeast Asia, especially the NLF
and Pathet Lao. The following remarks, which were
made early in the rally and echoed later, exemplify this
approach:
What we have found through research and looking at
how the war is carried out is that it is an immensely
technological war and that Stanford is very useful.
And so the only reason that we would attack the
University would be on the grounds of effectiveness,
so I would try to direct the demands toward specific
things in the community and that are attackable like
the computer center, like the Gamut-H program
that's going on there. Also, in the past things like the
A3M have made other movements start so with the
effectiveness here and exemplary action for other
universities we hope to take to close out and down
things which we think are very valuable to the
carrying on of this type of war to make it that much
more costly.
This is followed by another speaker:
I think that we should take the strongest action
possible tomorrow and the next day and the next day
after that. But that we should also be addressing
ourselves to questions of, and the other things we can
begin to move on immediately are some of the
demands that have already been raised like ending the
occupa. . .the armed occupation of this community.
That kind of thing we should begin to move on
immediately.
There were many references to the Computation
Center. It was clearly the object of intense interest, both
for its alleged war complicity and for its vulnerability. It
emerged as the prime target for protest activity. The
discussion of the Computation Center may be illustrated
by a speech in the middle of the meeting:
I'm not even going to talk about a strike. It doesn't
matter either way. But what, I think that it's appa
rent that the place that has to be hit, and has to be
hit hardest and can be hit not only here but in every
college campus and in every city in the country, are
the computer centers, [applause, shouts of 'Right
on'] and they don't have to be hit violently. Com
puter centers are the most vulnerable places any
where. If, you've seen the lights blink every once in a
while with the power shortage, well, if that were to
happen in a computer center for a millisecond, the
computer has to be shut down, and reloaded. And
that's at least an hour delay. Now what does an hour
delay mean to a computer in the computer center?
Well, it could mean just an hour delay. It could mean
a day delay. It could mean a week delay. It could be a
month delay or a year delay, [laughterj. It's, nobody
knows. It's dependent upon what's destroyed in just
that power shortage. What's destroyed in core
storage. What's destroyed as to the records. What
could be destroyed in the tape reserve rooms by the
temperature going too high. Nobody knows.
[Laughter, by speaker and othersl
Other references to the Computation Center included
a variety of ways in which it might be shut down and
put out of service; for example, by blocking access to it
with hundreds or thousands of people, by attacking it,
even by destroying it. Occasionally, a word of caution
was expressed regarding the more violent possibilities.

At various points throughout the meeting, references
to coercive and violent protest activities were received
with applause or laughter. Acts such as seizing and
occupying a building for long periods tended to be
treated casually. Violent acts were sometimes spoken of
explicitly, and sometimes merely hinted at. Audience
response indicated that these hints evoked considerable
interest. Fifteen speakers advocated actions in protest on
the campus that were most likely coercive or violent in
nature. The following speech illustrates the treatment of
coercive behavior.
Yeah, let me straighten that out. I did not advocate
any kind of violence about this computer. I tried to
say that the beauty of the computer center was no
violence is necessary. None at all to get, to get what
you want. Simple little sitting in doorways with a
thousand people, you know, no violence. You don't
have to break a window. Not one single window. And
you can siiil affect problems with this computer
center. Without any destruction whatsoever. So
there's no violence that would be necessary, please.
(Laughter). . .is used by everybody. If you want to
hit industries, you hit the computer that they're
using. That stops them from functioning. But you
have to hit them with enough people to stop normal
access.
Several speakers, notably Braunstein, advocated
action on different levels, violent and non-violent, each
helping the protest movement in his own way. A
spectrum of activities was included, some of which were
clearly coercive and some even overtly violent. Imagina
tion was required to think of ways to disrupt the
functioning of the University and harass the police.
Altogether, six speakers favored pursuing this multi
ple-levels-of-action, approach, embracing a broad spec
trum of protest activities. The general tendency of these
speakers was to favor the more disruptive end of this
range of activities.
The flavor of this approach is well exemplified in the
speech of Braunstein, which is worth quoting in its
entirety.
One thing we've been noted for over the past few
years when we've done any action, and again tonight,
is a lack of imagination. And, you know, I'd like to
address this not to the people in this audience who
know how they're going to vote and are going to
participate in anything, but people listening on radio
wondering what can I do to relate to all this? How
can I help? I'm not willing to get busted in front of
the Computer Center. Or what have you. And there
are many ways, and all you have to do is just think
about it. Last night there were some people out
playing football who kept just dozens of police busy
asking for IDs all the time. At one point they tried to

bring the football into the Computer Center and it
was searched. The football, [applause] Things like
this that tie up the opposing forces, while are not
directly going to end the war in Vietnam, are making
other people's actions become more effective. And
anybody who says "1 can't relate to this movement
because 1 don't agree with your tactics" just has a bad
imagination, and you know, there are many levels of
other action. There are people breaking windows,
there are people who sit in front of the ROTC
building for days, and days, and days, after other
people got tired. These people just were there. They
deserve, you know, our unending thanks. And there
are other people who have done other things, who for
some reason or other don't want to claim credit for
it. All those people also deserve our thanks,
[applause] And. . . . [KZSU interrupts to say speaker
is Yale Braunstein] . . .like the guy who two years
ago drove into a power pole up in Woodside and put
the Computer Center out for a week. Now they've
built an emergency power system, but you know,
there are other actions both violent and non-violent,
imaginative and very mundane, all of which can help
us and everybody, even if you, you object to how the
final vote comes out, should find some way of
keeping them busy in their off hours and should
devote more and more of that time to helping the
Movement, [applause]
As the meeting proceeded, a suggestion made by
Janet Weiss elicited considerable acceptance: to adopt
the tactics of a "mobile strike." The word "strike" was
used often in the meeting. Some of the usage was
unclear, and most of it bore little relation to the usual
meaning of the term in a labor dispute—i.e., the con
certed withholding of labor on a voluntary basis. In the
latter part of the Dinkelspiel rally, consensus grew on
the "mobile strike" or "mobile strike force," as the
meeting's chairman referred to it. The "mobile strike"
was intended to be a series of disruptive acts, hopefully
leading to a total shutdown of the University. Occupa
tion of the Computation Center was considered a good
way to begin. Then, if the occupants were evicted by the
police, another building could be occupied, and then
other actions taken as issues and targets become appa
rent. Nine speakers forcefully advocated a "mobile
strike," clearly including coercive acts within the scope
of such a "strike." Since Janet Weiss' formulation
seemed to be quite influential, it is worth quoting her
remarks on this subject.
I've heard that at some places they've used a tactic of
shutting down one building with a large group of
people, and then going and shutting something else
down so that nothing is shut down continually but

things are shut down, you know a lot of things are,
are shut down at different times, and maybe that's
the kind of strike that would work here, maybe that's
the kind of thing that would keep people doing
something, keep them involved in it, so that you
don't feel like you're just sitting there all day, bored
and cold. 1 think another thing, though, that, one
thing that seems to me is clear that we need, whatever
kind of action we have as a focus, is a lot of other
little peripheral actions, like the actions about people
going out in groups and causing the pigs that are on
the campus to really have to do their jobs. People can
put up signs and posters in bathrooms and buildings,
and things. You see the pigs dont' go into the
buildings, and any number of things that we can do
from inside the building to cause a lot of disruption,
havoc and chaos on the campus, and to keep it from
functioning properly, without really risking a lot of
things and things that might be very pointed. Now
that's the kind of things that I can see in a strike that
would work, but I'd kind of like to, if we're going to
talk about a strike, I think that we should have some
idea of what we're talking about. Because I don't
think, maybe I'm wrong, that we're going to get a lot
of people interested in a strike which means people
sitting around in different doorways, very isolated
from each other for hours at a time.
Near the end of the meeting, the Hoover Institution
was still mentioned as an attractive target.
Well, anyway, I was going to suggest that if there is a
rally scheduled for tomorrow or however we are
going to do it, we should probably move from there,
when we'll have a crowd already, and 1 think we
should take over Hoover and that, you know, 1 think
that they wouldn't let us stay too long in Hoover
before they brought pigs on to campus in daytime
and, which would be, you know, a very nice thing to
happen, you know, for the "movement", I think. If
we went to the Comp. Center, first of all 1 don't
think we'd have enough people by tomorrow to go to
the Comp Center and secondly it's pretty far removed
from the central part of campus. Hoover's right in the
center and I think it would be a good thing to do
tomorrow. And we'll be kicked out before 5, but
that's good too.
At the end of the meeting, there was general agree
ment that ways must be found the next day to recruit a
larger group of participants for the "mobile strike,"
whether it would begin at the Computation Center or
elsewhere. Concern was expressed by four speakers that
the number remaining in Dinkelspiel was too small to
permit an effective "mobile strike." This was advanced
as the primary reason for calling a noon rally at White
Plaza on February 10.
A. PREFACE
The climactic events of February 10, on which the
remaining charges focus, did not occur without warning.
Rather, the preceding several days were characterized by
overt turbulence and escalating protest activities. To
understand the events of February 10, it is helpful to
have some background. We therefore now briefly sketch
events which convey the atmosphere of those days and
are pertinent to the remaining charges.
Dissatisfaction with the Indochina war was rising
again because of rumors that an invasion of Laos was
about to begin, perhaps with participation of American
armed forces. In addition, the Stanford Judicial Council
had been holding hearings on charges brought against
students who were accused of disrupting the January
speech of Henry Cabot Lodge. Professor Franklin and
his associates were strongly opposed to these charges and
to the campus judicial system in which they were being
considered.'
B. CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS PRIOR TO FEB
RUARY 10, 1971
On Saturday, February 6, at about 1 a.m., arson was
attempted on the small wooden building known as the
Free Market-the headquarters of the conservative Free
Campus Movement whose members frequently observe
and photograph demonstrations. Later Saturday evening,
at 9:40 p.m., Molotov cocktails were thrown into the
first-floor office of the ROTC building. Three false fire
alarms were registered soon thereafter at scattered points
on campus. Moments earlier, on the other side of the
campus firemen had responded to a fire in a trash barrel
behind Ventura Hall and a false alarm at the Boathouse.
On Sunday, February 7, the invasion of Laos by
South Vietnamese troops with U.S. air support was
officially announced. At 8 p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditori
um a crowd of some 600 persons attended a perfor
mance of the San Francisco Mime Troupe sponsored by
the Stanford Community Against War and Fascism.
Before the Mime Troupe began to perform, it was
announced that Laos had been invaded. A telegram sent
from Ann Arbor, Michigan by Madame Binh, head of the
North Vietnam delegation to the Paris Peace Talks, was
read which called "for mobilizing peace forces in your
country." The Coalition Against the War in Indochina
distributed a flyer entitled "It's Official!! Laos Has Been
Invaded," which spelled out Madame Binh's message in
detail and called for a rally at White Plaza on Monday,
February 8. Leaflets were distributed by a antiwar group
called The Inquisition, demanding that the University

"release all information on the uses of the Computation
Center" and that war research at the Center "immediate
ly be halted." In this leaflet the Stanford Research
Institute computer program known as Gamut-H was
described. The program was said to simulate the logistics
of deployment of helicopters and ships and the leaflet
asserted that the "work is directly applicable in Indo
china."
After the performance, at about 1 0:30 p.m., over 200
persons protesting the Laos invasion broke about 100
windows in several buildings, including the Graduate
School of Business, Undergraduate Library, Post Office,
Engineering Corner, Terman Engineering, Placement
Center, Cubberly Education, Lou Henry Hoover Build
ing, and the Inner Quad. In addition to campus police on
duty, 35 Sheriffs deputies were brought on to campus
briefly after the first reports of property destruction,
but the "trashing" quickly subsided and the deputies
were not deployed. Windows in two Stanford University
police cars were broken when spotlights from one of the
cars were focused on 15-30 demonstrators hurling rocks
into the Lou Henrv Hoover building. Fights broke out
between demonstrators and members of the Free Cam
pus Movement who were attempting to halt the trashing.
The University Computation Center was evacuated at
9:30 p.m. after a telephoned bomb threat was received,
but after a search people re-entered the facility. (This
was not the first threat to the Center. In the spring of
1970, a part of the computer complex in Polya Hall was
the target of arson, but quick action averted serious
damage.)
On Monday, February 8, the noon rally was attended
by about 800 in White Memorial Plaza. The leaflet from
The Inquisition on the SKI war-related computer pro
gram was distributed together with a flyer entitled "Do
It!" "Do It!" encouraged formation of tight affinity
groups to "do whatever actions you feel ready to do"
and stated "last night's action was the first in a scries in
response to the invasion of Laos." It anticipated trouble
with police and with "right wing fascists," and gave
suggestions for handling such trouble.
An "Open Letter to the Stanford Community" from
the Inquisition also became available at about this time.
It stated that the Computation Center was being used by
Stanford Research Institute for "war research." Six
demands were made in the letter, including making
public the identity of all non-Stanford users of Stanford
facilities and phasing out of all Stanford research funded
by the Department of Defense; attached to this letter
was reply made by Provost Miller to some of these
demands.
About 100 antiwar demonstrators left the rally and
then went to the near-empty Faculty Club dining room
searching for members of the Stanford Board of Trus
tees. The group then left for the Graduate School of
Business where at 1:25 p.m. about 150 persons jammed
into the ground level lobby, blocking entry to a room in
which a trustee committee was meeting and holding the
committee virtually under siege for 45 minutes. At 1:45
p.m., C.D. Marron of the Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Department declared it was an unlawful assembly, with
the group chanting back: "Power to the People." The
crowd dispersed when a squad of sheriff's deputies
appeared. One plain-clothesman suffered a head lacera
tion when hit by a thrown rock. At 2:30 p.m. about 24
police dispersed some 300 demonstrators who had re
assembled outside the ground floor of the Graduate
School of Business.
At about 2:45 p.m. part of the group of demonstra
tors headed for the Old Union. About 150 persons
arrived at the courtyard, and 50 of them proceeded into
the Union lobby. A meeting was then called in the
lobby, and the Old Union was selected as a "strike
center." At 5:30 p.m. about 20 Santa Clara Sheriffs
Deputies moved into the rear (West) of the Old Union,
sweeping about 40 remaining occupants into the court
yard. Simultaneously some 15 members of the San Jose
Tactical Squad moved to the front (East) of the Old
Union. At about 5:45 p.m. the San Jose units left the
scene. Subsequently, however, numerous squads of
Santa Clara County and San Jose police patrolled the
campus on foot as well as by car.
On Tuesday, February 9, there was an afternoon
meeting in the Physics Tank, following the Stanford
Judicial Council hearing, in which a "Cambodia-type
strike" protesting the invasion of Laos was planned. In
the evening, beginning at 8 p.m., a three-hour session
was held in Dinkelspiel Auditorium, attended at the
peak by approximately 800 people. A recording of the
meeting taped by KZSU is available, and an analysis of
the speeches at the session is presented in the following
section.
C. ANALYSIS OF THE DINKELSPIEL RALLY
SPEECHES OF FEBRUARY 9, 1971
An important part of the context for the three
speeches of Professor Franklin on February 10th is the
Dinkelspiel rally of February 9th. That lengthy evening
rally did much to set the stage for the events of the
following day. Its recurrent themes mav help in under
standing the meaning of some significant terms used in
the February 10th speeches of Professor Franklin.
Indeed, in the hearing Professor Franklin urged us to
consider this meeting carefully in order to understand
the subsequent events. He participated in the February
9th rally, made a speech there, and was referred to by
several other speakers. [See Appendix I] His leadership
position may reasonably be inferred from the tape of
this meeting.
Many speakers emphasized Stanford's complicity in
the war. They emphasized the necessity of concentrating
protest activity on the campus rather than off it, and
doing so in a powerful way that would impair the
University and hence the war effort.
There were repeated linkages of the war in Southeast
Asia with the struggle at Stanford, particularly in rela
tion to police on campus. The police were referred to as
pigs and were described as an occupation army. Harrass
ment of police was repeatedly advocated. One speaker
indicated that resistance to the occupation army could
best be carried out late at night. Some speakers pictured
the protesters at Stanford as sharing in a common effort
with the people of Southeast Asia, especially the NLF
and Pathet Lao. The following remarks, which were
made early in the rally and echoed later, exemplify this
approach:
What we have found through research and looking at
how the war is carried out is that it is an immensely
technological war and that Stanford is very useful.
And so the only reason that we would attack the
University would be on the grounds of effectiveness,
so I would try to direct the demands toward specific
things in the community and that are attackable like
the computer center, like the Gamut-H program
that's going on there. Also, in the past things like the
A3M have made other movements start so with the
effectiveness here and exemplary action for other
universities we hope to take to close out and down
things which we think are very valuable to the
carrying on of this type of war to make it that much
more costly.
This is followed by another speaker:
I think that we should take the strongest action
possible tomorrow and the next day and the next day
after that. But that we should also be addressing
ourselves to questions of, and the other things we can
begin to move on immediately are some of the
demands that have already been raised like ending the
occupa. . .the armed occupation of this community.
That kind of thing we should begin to move on
immediately.
There were many references to the Computation
Center. It was clearly the object of intense interest, both
for its alleged war complicity and for its vulnerability. It
emerged as the prime target for protest activity. The
discussion of the Computation Center may be illustrated
by a speech in the middle of the meeting:
I'm not even going to talk about a strike. It doesn't
matter either way. But what, I think that it's appa
rent that the place that has to be hit, and has to be
hit hardest and can be hit not only here but in every
college campus and in every city in the country, are
the computer centers, [applause, shouts of 'Right
on'] and they don't have to be hit violently. Com
puter centers are the most vulnerable places any
where. If, you've seen the lights blink every once in a
while with the power shortage, well, if that were to
happen in a computer center for a millisecond, the
computer has to be shut down, and reloaded. And
that's at least an hour delay. Now what does an hour
delay mean to a computer in the computer center?
Well, it could mean just an hour delay. It could mean
a day delay. It could mean a week delay. It could be a
month delay or a year delay, [laughterj. It's, nobody
knows. It's dependent upon what's destroyed in just
that power shortage. What's destroyed in core
storage. What's destroyed as to the records. What
could be destroyed in the tape reserve rooms by the
temperature going too high. Nobody knows.
[Laughter, by speaker and othersl
Other references to the Computation Center included
a variety of ways in which it might be shut down and
put out of service; for example, by blocking access to it
with hundreds or thousands of people, by attacking it,
even by destroying it. Occasionally, a word of caution
was expressed regarding the more violent possibilities.

At various points throughout the meeting, references
to coercive and violent protest activities were received
with applause or laughter. Acts such as seizing and
occupying a building for long periods tended to be
treated casually. Violent acts were sometimes spoken of
explicitly, and sometimes merely hinted at. Audience
response indicated that these hints evoked considerable
interest. Fifteen speakers advocated actions in protest on
the campus that were most likely coercive or violent in
nature. The following speech illustrates the treatment of
coercive behavior.
Yeah, let me straighten that out. I did not advocate
any kind of violence about this computer. I tried to
say that the beauty of the computer center was no
violence is necessary. None at all to get, to get what
you want. Simple little sitting in doorways with a
thousand people, you know, no violence. You don't
have to break a window. Not one single window. And
you can siiil affect problems with this computer
center. Without any destruction whatsoever. So
there's no violence that would be necessary, please.
(Laughter). . .is used by everybody. If you want to
hit industries, you hit the computer that they're
using. That stops them from functioning. But you
have to hit them with enough people to stop normal
access.
Several speakers, notably Braunstein, advocated
action on different levels, violent and non-violent, each
helping the protest movement in his own way. A
spectrum of activities was included, some of which were
clearly coercive and some even overtly violent. Imagina
tion was required to think of ways to disrupt the
functioning of the University and harass the police.
Altogether, six speakers favored pursuing this multi
ple-levels-of-action, approach, embracing a broad spec
trum of protest activities. The general tendency of these
speakers was to favor the more disruptive end of this
range of activities.
The flavor of this approach is well exemplified in the
speech of Braunstein, which is worth quoting in its
entirety.
One thing we've been noted for over the past few
years when we've done any action, and again tonight,
is a lack of imagination. And, you know, I'd like to
address this not to the people in this audience who
know how they're going to vote and are going to
participate in anything, but people listening on radio
wondering what can I do to relate to all this? How
can I help? I'm not willing to get busted in front of
the Computer Center. Or what have you. And there
are many ways, and all you have to do is just think
about it. Last night there were some people out
playing football who kept just dozens of police busy
asking for IDs all the time. At one point they tried to

bring the football into the Computer Center and it
was searched. The football, [applause] Things like
this that tie up the opposing forces, while are not
directly going to end the war in Vietnam, are making
other people's actions become more effective. And
anybody who says "1 can't relate to this movement
because 1 don't agree with your tactics" just has a bad
imagination, and you know, there are many levels of
other action. There are people breaking windows,
there are people who sit in front of the ROTC
building for days, and days, and days, after other
people got tired. These people just were there. They
deserve, you know, our unending thanks. And there
are other people who have done other things, who for
some reason or other don't want to claim credit for
it. All those people also deserve our thanks,
[applause] And. . . . [KZSU interrupts to say speaker
is Yale Braunstein] . . .like the guy who two years
ago drove into a power pole up in Woodside and put
the Computer Center out for a week. Now they've
built an emergency power system, but you know,
there are other actions both violent and non-violent,
imaginative and very mundane, all of which can help
us and everybody, even if you, you object to how the
final vote comes out, should find some way of
keeping them busy in their off hours and should
devote more and more of that time to helping the
Movement, [applause]
As the meeting proceeded, a suggestion made by
Janet Weiss elicited considerable acceptance: to adopt
the tactics of a "mobile strike." The word "strike" was
used often in the meeting. Some of the usage was
unclear, and most of it bore little relation to the usual
meaning of the term in a labor dispute—i.e., the con
certed withholding of labor on a voluntary basis. In the
latter part of the Dinkelspiel rally, consensus grew on
the "mobile strike" or "mobile strike force," as the
meeting's chairman referred to it. The "mobile strike"
was intended to be a series of disruptive acts, hopefully
leading to a total shutdown of the University. Occupa
tion of the Computation Center was considered a good
way to begin. Then, if the occupants were evicted by the
police, another building could be occupied, and then
other actions taken as issues and targets become appa
rent. Nine speakers forcefully advocated a "mobile
strike," clearly including coercive acts within the scope
of such a "strike." Since Janet Weiss' formulation
seemed to be quite influential, it is worth quoting her
remarks on this subject.
I've heard that at some places they've used a tactic of
shutting down one building with a large group of
people, and then going and shutting something else
down so that nothing is shut down continually but

things are shut down, you know a lot of things are,
are shut down at different times, and maybe that's
the kind of strike that would work here, maybe that's
the kind of thing that would keep people doing
something, keep them involved in it, so that you
don't feel like you're just sitting there all day, bored
and cold. 1 think another thing, though, that, one
thing that seems to me is clear that we need, whatever
kind of action we have as a focus, is a lot of other
little peripheral actions, like the actions about people
going out in groups and causing the pigs that are on
the campus to really have to do their jobs. People can
put up signs and posters in bathrooms and buildings,
and things. You see the pigs dont' go into the
buildings, and any number of things that we can do
from inside the building to cause a lot of disruption,
havoc and chaos on the campus, and to keep it from
functioning properly, without really risking a lot of
things and things that might be very pointed. Now
that's the kind of things that I can see in a strike that
would work, but I'd kind of like to, if we're going to
talk about a strike, I think that we should have some
idea of what we're talking about. Because I don't
think, maybe I'm wrong, that we're going to get a lot
of people interested in a strike which means people
sitting around in different doorways, very isolated
from each other for hours at a time.
Near the end of the meeting, the Hoover Institution
was still mentioned as an attractive target.
Well, anyway, I was going to suggest that if there is a
rally scheduled for tomorrow or however we are
going to do it, we should probably move from there,
when we'll have a crowd already, and 1 think we
should take over Hoover and that, you know, 1 think
that they wouldn't let us stay too long in Hoover
before they brought pigs on to campus in daytime
and, which would be, you know, a very nice thing to
happen, you know, for the "movement", I think. If
we went to the Comp. Center, first of all 1 don't
think we'd have enough people by tomorrow to go to
the Comp Center and secondly it's pretty far removed
from the central part of campus. Hoover's right in the
center and I think it would be a good thing to do
tomorrow. And we'll be kicked out before 5, but
that's good too.
At the end of the meeting, there was general agree
ment that ways must be found the next day to recruit a
larger group of participants for the "mobile strike,"
whether it would begin at the Computation Center or
elsewhere. Concern was expressed by four speakers that
the number remaining in Dinkelspiel was too small to
permit an effective "mobile strike." This was advanced
as the primary reason for calling a noon rally at White
Plaza on February 10.
A. PREFACE
The climactic events of February 10, on which the
remaining charges focus, did not occur without warning.
Rather, the preceding several days were characterized by
overt turbulence and escalating protest activities. To
understand the events of February 10, it is helpful to
have some background. We therefore now briefly sketch
events which convey the atmosphere of those days and
are pertinent to the remaining charges.
Dissatisfaction with the Indochina war was rising
again because of rumors that an invasion of Laos was
about to begin, perhaps with participation of American
armed forces. In addition, the Stanford Judicial Council
had been holding hearings on charges brought against
students who were accused of disrupting the January
speech of Henry Cabot Lodge. Professor Franklin and
his associates were strongly opposed to these charges and
to the campus judicial system in which they were being
considered.'
B. CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS PRIOR TO FEB
RUARY 10, 1971
On Saturday, February 6, at about 1 a.m., arson was
attempted on the small wooden building known as the
Free Market-the headquarters of the conservative Free
Campus Movement whose members frequently observe
and photograph demonstrations. Later Saturday evening,
at 9:40 p.m., Molotov cocktails were thrown into the
first-floor office of the ROTC building. Three false fire
alarms were registered soon thereafter at scattered points
on campus. Moments earlier, on the other side of the
campus firemen had responded to a fire in a trash barrel
behind Ventura Hall and a false alarm at the Boathouse.
On Sunday, February 7, the invasion of Laos by
South Vietnamese troops with U.S. air support was
officially announced. At 8 p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditori
um a crowd of some 600 persons attended a perfor
mance of the San Francisco Mime Troupe sponsored by
the Stanford Community Against War and Fascism.
Before the Mime Troupe began to perform, it was
announced that Laos had been invaded. A telegram sent
from Ann Arbor, Michigan by Madame Binh, head of the
North Vietnam delegation to the Paris Peace Talks, was
read which called "for mobilizing peace forces in your
country." The Coalition Against the War in Indochina
distributed a flyer entitled "It's Official!! Laos Has Been
Invaded," which spelled out Madame Binh's message in
detail and called for a rally at White Plaza on Monday,
February 8. Leaflets were distributed by a antiwar group
called The Inquisition, demanding that the University

"release all information on the uses of the Computation
Center" and that war research at the Center "immediate
ly be halted." In this leaflet the Stanford Research
Institute computer program known as Gamut-H was
described. The program was said to simulate the logistics
of deployment of helicopters and ships and the leaflet
asserted that the "work is directly applicable in Indo
china."
After the performance, at about 1 0:30 p.m., over 200
persons protesting the Laos invasion broke about 100
windows in several buildings, including the Graduate
School of Business, Undergraduate Library, Post Office,
Engineering Corner, Terman Engineering, Placement
Center, Cubberly Education, Lou Henry Hoover Build
ing, and the Inner Quad. In addition to campus police on
duty, 35 Sheriffs deputies were brought on to campus
briefly after the first reports of property destruction,
but the "trashing" quickly subsided and the deputies
were not deployed. Windows in two Stanford University
police cars were broken when spotlights from one of the
cars were focused on 15-30 demonstrators hurling rocks
into the Lou Henrv Hoover building. Fights broke out
between demonstrators and members of the Free Cam
pus Movement who were attempting to halt the trashing.
The University Computation Center was evacuated at
9:30 p.m. after a telephoned bomb threat was received,
but after a search people re-entered the facility. (This
was not the first threat to the Center. In the spring of
1970, a part of the computer complex in Polya Hall was
the target of arson, but quick action averted serious
damage.)
On Monday, February 8, the noon rally was attended
by about 800 in White Memorial Plaza. The leaflet from
The Inquisition on the SKI war-related computer pro
gram was distributed together with a flyer entitled "Do
It!" "Do It!" encouraged formation of tight affinity
groups to "do whatever actions you feel ready to do"
and stated "last night's action was the first in a scries in
response to the invasion of Laos." It anticipated trouble
with police and with "right wing fascists," and gave
suggestions for handling such trouble.
An "Open Letter to the Stanford Community" from
the Inquisition also became available at about this time.
It stated that the Computation Center was being used by
Stanford Research Institute for "war research." Six
demands were made in the letter, including making
public the identity of all non-Stanford users of Stanford
facilities and phasing out of all Stanford research funded
by the Department of Defense; attached to this letter
was reply made by Provost Miller to some of these
demands.
About 100 antiwar demonstrators left the rally and
then went to the near-empty Faculty Club dining room
searching for members of the Stanford Board of Trus
tees. The group then left for the Graduate School of
Business where at 1:25 p.m. about 150 persons jammed
into the ground level lobby, blocking entry to a room in
which a trustee committee was meeting and holding the
committee virtually under siege for 45 minutes. At 1:45
p.m., C.D. Marron of the Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Department declared it was an unlawful assembly, with
the group chanting back: "Power to the People." The
crowd dispersed when a squad of sheriff's deputies
appeared. One plain-clothesman suffered a head lacera
tion when hit by a thrown rock. At 2:30 p.m. about 24
police dispersed some 300 demonstrators who had re
assembled outside the ground floor of the Graduate
School of Business.
At about 2:45 p.m. part of the group of demonstra
tors headed for the Old Union. About 150 persons
arrived at the courtyard, and 50 of them proceeded into
the Union lobby. A meeting was then called in the
lobby, and the Old Union was selected as a "strike
center." At 5:30 p.m. about 20 Santa Clara Sheriffs
Deputies moved into the rear (West) of the Old Union,
sweeping about 40 remaining occupants into the court
yard. Simultaneously some 15 members of the San Jose
Tactical Squad moved to the front (East) of the Old
Union. At about 5:45 p.m. the San Jose units left the
scene. Subsequently, however, numerous squads of
Santa Clara County and San Jose police patrolled the
campus on foot as well as by car.
On Tuesday, February 9, there was an afternoon
meeting in the Physics Tank, following the Stanford
Judicial Council hearing, in which a "Cambodia-type
strike" protesting the invasion of Laos was planned. In
the evening, beginning at 8 p.m., a three-hour session
was held in Dinkelspiel Auditorium, attended at the
peak by approximately 800 people. A recording of the
meeting taped by KZSU is available, and an analysis of
the speeches at the session is presented in the following
section.
C. ANALYSIS OF THE DINKELSPIEL RALLY
SPEECHES OF FEBRUARY 9, 1971
An important part of the context for the three
speeches of Professor Franklin on February 10th is the
Dinkelspiel rally of February 9th. That lengthy evening
rally did much to set the stage for the events of the
following day. Its recurrent themes mav help in under
standing the meaning of some significant terms used in
the February 10th speeches of Professor Franklin.
Indeed, in the hearing Professor Franklin urged us to
consider this meeting carefully in order to understand
the subsequent events. He participated in the February
9th rally, made a speech there, and was referred to by
several other speakers. [See Appendix I] His leadership
position may reasonably be inferred from the tape of
this meeting.
Many speakers emphasized Stanford's complicity in
the war. They emphasized the necessity of concentrating
protest activity on the campus rather than off it, and
doing so in a powerful way that would impair the
University and hence the war effort.
There were repeated linkages of the war in Southeast
Asia with the struggle at Stanford, particularly in rela
tion to police on campus. The police were referred to as
pigs and were described as an occupation army. Harrass
ment of police was repeatedly advocated. One speaker
indicated that resistance to the occupation army could
best be carried out late at night. Some speakers pictured
the protesters at Stanford as sharing in a common effort
with the people of Southeast Asia, especially the NLF
and Pathet Lao. The following remarks, which were
made early in the rally and echoed later, exemplify this
approach:
What we have found through research and looking at
how the war is carried out is that it is an immensely
technological war and that Stanford is very useful.
And so the only reason that we would attack the
University would be on the grounds of effectiveness,
so I would try to direct the demands toward specific
things in the community and that are attackable like
the computer center, like the Gamut-H program
that's going on there. Also, in the past things like the
A3M have made other movements start so with the
effectiveness here and exemplary action for other
universities we hope to take to close out and down
things which we think are very valuable to the
carrying on of this type of war to make it that much
more costly.
This is followed by another speaker:
I think that we should take the strongest action
possible tomorrow and the next day and the next day
after that. But that we should also be addressing
ourselves to questions of, and the other things we can
begin to move on immediately are some of the
demands that have already been raised like ending the
occupa. . .the armed occupation of this community.
That kind of thing we should begin to move on
immediately.
There were many references to the Computation
Center. It was clearly the object of intense interest, both
for its alleged war complicity and for its vulnerability. It
emerged as the prime target for protest activity. The
discussion of the Computation Center may be illustrated
by a speech in the middle of the meeting:
I'm not even going to talk about a strike. It doesn't
matter either way. But what, I think that it's appa
rent that the place that has to be hit, and has to be
hit hardest and can be hit not only here but in every
college campus and in every city in the country, are
the computer centers, [applause, shouts of 'Right
on'] and they don't have to be hit violently. Com
puter centers are the most vulnerable places any
where. If, you've seen the lights blink every once in a
while with the power shortage, well, if that were to
happen in a computer center for a millisecond, the
computer has to be shut down, and reloaded. And
that's at least an hour delay. Now what does an hour
delay mean to a computer in the computer center?
Well, it could mean just an hour delay. It could mean
a day delay. It could mean a week delay. It could be a
month delay or a year delay, [laughterj. It's, nobody
knows. It's dependent upon what's destroyed in just
that power shortage. What's destroyed in core
storage. What's destroyed as to the records. What
could be destroyed in the tape reserve rooms by the
temperature going too high. Nobody knows.
[Laughter, by speaker and othersl
Other references to the Computation Center included
a variety of ways in which it might be shut down and
put out of service; for example, by blocking access to it
with hundreds or thousands of people, by attacking it,
even by destroying it. Occasionally, a word of caution
was expressed regarding the more violent possibilities.

At various points throughout the meeting, references
to coercive and violent protest activities were received
with applause or laughter. Acts such as seizing and
occupying a building for long periods tended to be
treated casually. Violent acts were sometimes spoken of
explicitly, and sometimes merely hinted at. Audience
response indicated that these hints evoked considerable
interest. Fifteen speakers advocated actions in protest on
the campus that were most likely coercive or violent in
nature. The following speech illustrates the treatment of
coercive behavior.
Yeah, let me straighten that out. I did not advocate
any kind of violence about this computer. I tried to
say that the beauty of the computer center was no
violence is necessary. None at all to get, to get what
you want. Simple little sitting in doorways with a
thousand people, you know, no violence. You don't
have to break a window. Not one single window. And
you can siiil affect problems with this computer
center. Without any destruction whatsoever. So
there's no violence that would be necessary, please.
(Laughter). . .is used by everybody. If you want to
hit industries, you hit the computer that they're
using. That stops them from functioning. But you
have to hit them with enough people to stop normal
access.
Several speakers, notably Braunstein, advocated
action on different levels, violent and non-violent, each
helping the protest movement in his own way. A
spectrum of activities was included, some of which were
clearly coercive and some even overtly violent. Imagina
tion was required to think of ways to disrupt the
functioning of the University and harass the police.
Altogether, six speakers favored pursuing this multi
ple-levels-of-action, approach, embracing a broad spec
trum of protest activities. The general tendency of these
speakers was to favor the more disruptive end of this
range of activities.
The flavor of this approach is well exemplified in the
speech of Braunstein, which is worth quoting in its
entirety.
One thing we've been noted for over the past few
years when we've done any action, and again tonight,
is a lack of imagination. And, you know, I'd like to
address this not to the people in this audience who
know how they're going to vote and are going to
participate in anything, but people listening on radio
wondering what can I do to relate to all this? How
can I help? I'm not willing to get busted in front of
the Computer Center. Or what have you. And there
are many ways, and all you have to do is just think
about it. Last night there were some people out
playing football who kept just dozens of police busy
asking for IDs all the time. At one point they tried to

bring the football into the Computer Center and it
was searched. The football, [applause] Things like
this that tie up the opposing forces, while are not
directly going to end the war in Vietnam, are making
other people's actions become more effective. And
anybody who says "1 can't relate to this movement
because 1 don't agree with your tactics" just has a bad
imagination, and you know, there are many levels of
other action. There are people breaking windows,
there are people who sit in front of the ROTC
building for days, and days, and days, after other
people got tired. These people just were there. They
deserve, you know, our unending thanks. And there
are other people who have done other things, who for
some reason or other don't want to claim credit for
it. All those people also deserve our thanks,
[applause] And. . . . [KZSU interrupts to say speaker
is Yale Braunstein] . . .like the guy who two years
ago drove into a power pole up in Woodside and put
the Computer Center out for a week. Now they've
built an emergency power system, but you know,
there are other actions both violent and non-violent,
imaginative and very mundane, all of which can help
us and everybody, even if you, you object to how the
final vote comes out, should find some way of
keeping them busy in their off hours and should
devote more and more of that time to helping the
Movement, [applause]
As the meeting proceeded, a suggestion made by
Janet Weiss elicited considerable acceptance: to adopt
the tactics of a "mobile strike." The word "strike" was
used often in the meeting. Some of the usage was
unclear, and most of it bore little relation to the usual
meaning of the term in a labor dispute—i.e., the con
certed withholding of labor on a voluntary basis. In the
latter part of the Dinkelspiel rally, consensus grew on
the "mobile strike" or "mobile strike force," as the
meeting's chairman referred to it. The "mobile strike"
was intended to be a series of disruptive acts, hopefully
leading to a total shutdown of the University. Occupa
tion of the Computation Center was considered a good
way to begin. Then, if the occupants were evicted by the
police, another building could be occupied, and then
other actions taken as issues and targets become appa
rent. Nine speakers forcefully advocated a "mobile
strike," clearly including coercive acts within the scope
of such a "strike." Since Janet Weiss' formulation
seemed to be quite influential, it is worth quoting her
remarks on this subject.
I've heard that at some places they've used a tactic of
shutting down one building with a large group of
people, and then going and shutting something else
down so that nothing is shut down continually but

things are shut down, you know a lot of things are,
are shut down at different times, and maybe that's
the kind of strike that would work here, maybe that's
the kind of thing that would keep people doing
something, keep them involved in it, so that you
don't feel like you're just sitting there all day, bored
and cold. 1 think another thing, though, that, one
thing that seems to me is clear that we need, whatever
kind of action we have as a focus, is a lot of other
little peripheral actions, like the actions about people
going out in groups and causing the pigs that are on
the campus to really have to do their jobs. People can
put up signs and posters in bathrooms and buildings,
and things. You see the pigs dont' go into the
buildings, and any number of things that we can do
from inside the building to cause a lot of disruption,
havoc and chaos on the campus, and to keep it from
functioning properly, without really risking a lot of
things and things that might be very pointed. Now
that's the kind of things that I can see in a strike that
would work, but I'd kind of like to, if we're going to
talk about a strike, I think that we should have some
idea of what we're talking about. Because I don't
think, maybe I'm wrong, that we're going to get a lot
of people interested in a strike which means people
sitting around in different doorways, very isolated
from each other for hours at a time.
Near the end of the meeting, the Hoover Institution
was still mentioned as an attractive target.
Well, anyway, I was going to suggest that if there is a
rally scheduled for tomorrow or however we are
going to do it, we should probably move from there,
when we'll have a crowd already, and 1 think we
should take over Hoover and that, you know, 1 think
that they wouldn't let us stay too long in Hoover
before they brought pigs on to campus in daytime
and, which would be, you know, a very nice thing to
happen, you know, for the "movement", I think. If
we went to the Comp. Center, first of all 1 don't
think we'd have enough people by tomorrow to go to
the Comp Center and secondly it's pretty far removed
from the central part of campus. Hoover's right in the
center and I think it would be a good thing to do
tomorrow. And we'll be kicked out before 5, but
that's good too.
At the end of the meeting, there was general agree
ment that ways must be found the next day to recruit a
larger group of participants for the "mobile strike,"
whether it would begin at the Computation Center or
elsewhere. Concern was expressed by four speakers that
the number remaining in Dinkelspiel was too small to
permit an effective "mobile strike." This was advanced
as the primary reason for calling a noon rally at White
Plaza on February 10.
A. PREFACE
The climactic events of February 10, on which the
remaining charges focus, did not occur without warning.
Rather, the preceding several days were characterized by
overt turbulence and escalating protest activities. To
understand the events of February 10, it is helpful to
have some background. We therefore now briefly sketch
events which convey the atmosphere of those days and
are pertinent to the remaining charges.
Dissatisfaction with the Indochina war was rising
again because of rumors that an invasion of Laos was
about to begin, perhaps with participation of American
armed forces. In addition, the Stanford Judicial Council
had been holding hearings on charges brought against
students who were accused of disrupting the January
speech of Henry Cabot Lodge. Professor Franklin and
his associates were strongly opposed to these charges and
to the campus judicial system in which they were being
considered.'
B. CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS PRIOR TO FEB
RUARY 10, 1971
On Saturday, February 6, at about 1 a.m., arson was
attempted on the small wooden building known as the
Free Market-the headquarters of the conservative Free
Campus Movement whose members frequently observe
and photograph demonstrations. Later Saturday evening,
at 9:40 p.m., Molotov cocktails were thrown into the
first-floor office of the ROTC building. Three false fire
alarms were registered soon thereafter at scattered points
on campus. Moments earlier, on the other side of the
campus firemen had responded to a fire in a trash barrel
behind Ventura Hall and a false alarm at the Boathouse.
On Sunday, February 7, the invasion of Laos by
South Vietnamese troops with U.S. air support was
officially announced. At 8 p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditori
um a crowd of some 600 persons attended a perfor
mance of the San Francisco Mime Troupe sponsored by
the Stanford Community Against War and Fascism.
Before the Mime Troupe began to perform, it was
announced that Laos had been invaded. A telegram sent
from Ann Arbor, Michigan by Madame Binh, head of the
North Vietnam delegation to the Paris Peace Talks, was
read which called "for mobilizing peace forces in your
country." The Coalition Against the War in Indochina
distributed a flyer entitled "It's Official!! Laos Has Been
Invaded," which spelled out Madame Binh's message in
detail and called for a rally at White Plaza on Monday,
February 8. Leaflets were distributed by a antiwar group
called The Inquisition, demanding that the University

"release all information on the uses of the Computation
Center" and that war research at the Center "immediate
ly be halted." In this leaflet the Stanford Research
Institute computer program known as Gamut-H was
described. The program was said to simulate the logistics
of deployment of helicopters and ships and the leaflet
asserted that the "work is directly applicable in Indo
china."
After the performance, at about 1 0:30 p.m., over 200
persons protesting the Laos invasion broke about 100
windows in several buildings, including the Graduate
School of Business, Undergraduate Library, Post Office,
Engineering Corner, Terman Engineering, Placement
Center, Cubberly Education, Lou Henry Hoover Build
ing, and the Inner Quad. In addition to campus police on
duty, 35 Sheriffs deputies were brought on to campus
briefly after the first reports of property destruction,
but the "trashing" quickly subsided and the deputies
were not deployed. Windows in two Stanford University
police cars were broken when spotlights from one of the
cars were focused on 15-30 demonstrators hurling rocks
into the Lou Henrv Hoover building. Fights broke out
between demonstrators and members of the Free Cam
pus Movement who were attempting to halt the trashing.
The University Computation Center was evacuated at
9:30 p.m. after a telephoned bomb threat was received,
but after a search people re-entered the facility. (This
was not the first threat to the Center. In the spring of
1970, a part of the computer complex in Polya Hall was
the target of arson, but quick action averted serious
damage.)
On Monday, February 8, the noon rally was attended
by about 800 in White Memorial Plaza. The leaflet from
The Inquisition on the SKI war-related computer pro
gram was distributed together with a flyer entitled "Do
It!" "Do It!" encouraged formation of tight affinity
groups to "do whatever actions you feel ready to do"
and stated "last night's action was the first in a scries in
response to the invasion of Laos." It anticipated trouble
with police and with "right wing fascists," and gave
suggestions for handling such trouble.
An "Open Letter to the Stanford Community" from
the Inquisition also became available at about this time.
It stated that the Computation Center was being used by
Stanford Research Institute for "war research." Six
demands were made in the letter, including making
public the identity of all non-Stanford users of Stanford
facilities and phasing out of all Stanford research funded
by the Department of Defense; attached to this letter
was reply made by Provost Miller to some of these
demands.
About 100 antiwar demonstrators left the rally and
then went to the near-empty Faculty Club dining room
searching for members of the Stanford Board of Trus
tees. The group then left for the Graduate School of
Business where at 1:25 p.m. about 150 persons jammed
into the ground level lobby, blocking entry to a room in
which a trustee committee was meeting and holding the
committee virtually under siege for 45 minutes. At 1:45
p.m., C.D. Marron of the Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Department declared it was an unlawful assembly, with
the group chanting back: "Power to the People." The
crowd dispersed when a squad of sheriff's deputies
appeared. One plain-clothesman suffered a head lacera
tion when hit by a thrown rock. At 2:30 p.m. about 24
police dispersed some 300 demonstrators who had re
assembled outside the ground floor of the Graduate
School of Business.
At about 2:45 p.m. part of the group of demonstra
tors headed for the Old Union. About 150 persons
arrived at the courtyard, and 50 of them proceeded into
the Union lobby. A meeting was then called in the
lobby, and the Old Union was selected as a "strike
center." At 5:30 p.m. about 20 Santa Clara Sheriffs
Deputies moved into the rear (West) of the Old Union,
sweeping about 40 remaining occupants into the court
yard. Simultaneously some 15 members of the San Jose
Tactical Squad moved to the front (East) of the Old
Union. At about 5:45 p.m. the San Jose units left the
scene. Subsequently, however, numerous squads of
Santa Clara County and San Jose police patrolled the
campus on foot as well as by car.
On Tuesday, February 9, there was an afternoon
meeting in the Physics Tank, following the Stanford
Judicial Council hearing, in which a "Cambodia-type
strike" protesting the invasion of Laos was planned. In
the evening, beginning at 8 p.m., a three-hour session
was held in Dinkelspiel Auditorium, attended at the
peak by approximately 800 people. A recording of the
meeting taped by KZSU is available, and an analysis of
the speeches at the session is presented in the following
section.
C. ANALYSIS OF THE DINKELSPIEL RALLY
SPEECHES OF FEBRUARY 9, 1971
An important part of the context for the three
speeches of Professor Franklin on February 10th is the
Dinkelspiel rally of February 9th. That lengthy evening
rally did much to set the stage for the events of the
following day. Its recurrent themes mav help in under
standing the meaning of some significant terms used in
the February 10th speeches of Professor Franklin.
Indeed, in the hearing Professor Franklin urged us to
consider this meeting carefully in order to understand
the subsequent events. He participated in the February
9th rally, made a speech there, and was referred to by
several other speakers. [See Appendix I] His leadership
position may reasonably be inferred from the tape of
this meeting.
Many speakers emphasized Stanford's complicity in
the war. They emphasized the necessity of concentrating
protest activity on the campus rather than off it, and
doing so in a powerful way that would impair the
University and hence the war effort.
There were repeated linkages of the war in Southeast
Asia with the struggle at Stanford, particularly in rela
tion to police on campus. The police were referred to as
pigs and were described as an occupation army. Harrass
ment of police was repeatedly advocated. One speaker
indicated that resistance to the occupation army could
best be carried out late at night. Some speakers pictured
the protesters at Stanford as sharing in a common effort
with the people of Southeast Asia, especially the NLF
and Pathet Lao. The following remarks, which were
made early in the rally and echoed later, exemplify this
approach:
What we have found through research and looking at
how the war is carried out is that it is an immensely
technological war and that Stanford is very useful.
And so the only reason that we would attack the
University would be on the grounds of effectiveness,
so I would try to direct the demands toward specific
things in the community and that are attackable like
the computer center, like the Gamut-H program
that's going on there. Also, in the past things like the
A3M have made other movements start so with the
effectiveness here and exemplary action for other
universities we hope to take to close out and down
things which we think are very valuable to the
carrying on of this type of war to make it that much
more costly.
This is followed by another speaker:
I think that we should take the strongest action
possible tomorrow and the next day and the next day
after that. But that we should also be addressing
ourselves to questions of, and the other things we can
begin to move on immediately are some of the
demands that have already been raised like ending the
occupa. . .the armed occupation of this community.
That kind of thing we should begin to move on
immediately.
There were many references to the Computation
Center. It was clearly the object of intense interest, both
for its alleged war complicity and for its vulnerability. It
emerged as the prime target for protest activity. The
discussion of the Computation Center may be illustrated
by a speech in the middle of the meeting:
I'm not even going to talk about a strike. It doesn't
matter either way. But what, I think that it's appa
rent that the place that has to be hit, and has to be
hit hardest and can be hit not only here but in every
college campus and in every city in the country, are
the computer centers, [applause, shouts of 'Right
on'] and they don't have to be hit violently. Com
puter centers are the most vulnerable places any
where. If, you've seen the lights blink every once in a
while with the power shortage, well, if that were to
happen in a computer center for a millisecond, the
computer has to be shut down, and reloaded. And
that's at least an hour delay. Now what does an hour
delay mean to a computer in the computer center?
Well, it could mean just an hour delay. It could mean
a day delay. It could mean a week delay. It could be a
month delay or a year delay, [laughterj. It's, nobody
knows. It's dependent upon what's destroyed in just
that power shortage. What's destroyed in core
storage. What's destroyed as to the records. What
could be destroyed in the tape reserve rooms by the
temperature going too high. Nobody knows.
[Laughter, by speaker and othersl
Other references to the Computation Center included
a variety of ways in which it might be shut down and
put out of service; for example, by blocking access to it
with hundreds or thousands of people, by attacking it,
even by destroying it. Occasionally, a word of caution
was expressed regarding the more violent possibilities.

At various points throughout the meeting, references
to coercive and violent protest activities were received
with applause or laughter. Acts such as seizing and
occupying a building for long periods tended to be
treated casually. Violent acts were sometimes spoken of
explicitly, and sometimes merely hinted at. Audience
response indicated that these hints evoked considerable
interest. Fifteen speakers advocated actions in protest on
the campus that were most likely coercive or violent in
nature. The following speech illustrates the treatment of
coercive behavior.
Yeah, let me straighten that out. I did not advocate
any kind of violence about this computer. I tried to
say that the beauty of the computer center was no
violence is necessary. None at all to get, to get what
you want. Simple little sitting in doorways with a
thousand people, you know, no violence. You don't
have to break a window. Not one single window. And
you can siiil affect problems with this computer
center. Without any destruction whatsoever. So
there's no violence that would be necessary, please.
(Laughter). . .is used by everybody. If you want to
hit industries, you hit the computer that they're
using. That stops them from functioning. But you
have to hit them with enough people to stop normal
access.
Several speakers, notably Braunstein, advocated
action on different levels, violent and non-violent, each
helping the protest movement in his own way. A
spectrum of activities was included, some of which were
clearly coercive and some even overtly violent. Imagina
tion was required to think of ways to disrupt the
functioning of the University and harass the police.
Altogether, six speakers favored pursuing this multi
ple-levels-of-action, approach, embracing a broad spec
trum of protest activities. The general tendency of these
speakers was to favor the more disruptive end of this
range of activities.
The flavor of this approach is well exemplified in the
speech of Braunstein, which is worth quoting in its
entirety.
One thing we've been noted for over the past few
years when we've done any action, and again tonight,
is a lack of imagination. And, you know, I'd like to
address this not to the people in this audience who
know how they're going to vote and are going to
participate in anything, but people listening on radio
wondering what can I do to relate to all this? How
can I help? I'm not willing to get busted in front of
the Computer Center. Or what have you. And there
are many ways, and all you have to do is just think
about it. Last night there were some people out
playing football who kept just dozens of police busy
asking for IDs all the time. At one point they tried to

bring the football into the Computer Center and it
was searched. The football, [applause] Things like
this that tie up the opposing forces, while are not
directly going to end the war in Vietnam, are making
other people's actions become more effective. And
anybody who says "1 can't relate to this movement
because 1 don't agree with your tactics" just has a bad
imagination, and you know, there are many levels of
other action. There are people breaking windows,
there are people who sit in front of the ROTC
building for days, and days, and days, after other
people got tired. These people just were there. They
deserve, you know, our unending thanks. And there
are other people who have done other things, who for
some reason or other don't want to claim credit for
it. All those people also deserve our thanks,
[applause] And. . . . [KZSU interrupts to say speaker
is Yale Braunstein] . . .like the guy who two years
ago drove into a power pole up in Woodside and put
the Computer Center out for a week. Now they've
built an emergency power system, but you know,
there are other actions both violent and non-violent,
imaginative and very mundane, all of which can help
us and everybody, even if you, you object to how the
final vote comes out, should find some way of
keeping them busy in their off hours and should
devote more and more of that time to helping the
Movement, [applause]
As the meeting proceeded, a suggestion made by
Janet Weiss elicited considerable acceptance: to adopt
the tactics of a "mobile strike." The word "strike" was
used often in the meeting. Some of the usage was
unclear, and most of it bore little relation to the usual
meaning of the term in a labor dispute—i.e., the con
certed withholding of labor on a voluntary basis. In the
latter part of the Dinkelspiel rally, consensus grew on
the "mobile strike" or "mobile strike force," as the
meeting's chairman referred to it. The "mobile strike"
was intended to be a series of disruptive acts, hopefully
leading to a total shutdown of the University. Occupa
tion of the Computation Center was considered a good
way to begin. Then, if the occupants were evicted by the
police, another building could be occupied, and then
other actions taken as issues and targets become appa
rent. Nine speakers forcefully advocated a "mobile
strike," clearly including coercive acts within the scope
of such a "strike." Since Janet Weiss' formulation
seemed to be quite influential, it is worth quoting her
remarks on this subject.
I've heard that at some places they've used a tactic of
shutting down one building with a large group of
people, and then going and shutting something else
down so that nothing is shut down continually but

things are shut down, you know a lot of things are,
are shut down at different times, and maybe that's
the kind of strike that would work here, maybe that's
the kind of thing that would keep people doing
something, keep them involved in it, so that you
don't feel like you're just sitting there all day, bored
and cold. 1 think another thing, though, that, one
thing that seems to me is clear that we need, whatever
kind of action we have as a focus, is a lot of other
little peripheral actions, like the actions about people
going out in groups and causing the pigs that are on
the campus to really have to do their jobs. People can
put up signs and posters in bathrooms and buildings,
and things. You see the pigs dont' go into the
buildings, and any number of things that we can do
from inside the building to cause a lot of disruption,
havoc and chaos on the campus, and to keep it from
functioning properly, without really risking a lot of
things and things that might be very pointed. Now
that's the kind of things that I can see in a strike that
would work, but I'd kind of like to, if we're going to
talk about a strike, I think that we should have some
idea of what we're talking about. Because I don't
think, maybe I'm wrong, that we're going to get a lot
of people interested in a strike which means people
sitting around in different doorways, very isolated
from each other for hours at a time.
Near the end of the meeting, the Hoover Institution
was still mentioned as an attractive target.
Well, anyway, I was going to suggest that if there is a
rally scheduled for tomorrow or however we are
going to do it, we should probably move from there,
when we'll have a crowd already, and 1 think we
should take over Hoover and that, you know, 1 think
that they wouldn't let us stay too long in Hoover
before they brought pigs on to campus in daytime
and, which would be, you know, a very nice thing to
happen, you know, for the "movement", I think. If
we went to the Comp. Center, first of all 1 don't
think we'd have enough people by tomorrow to go to
the Comp Center and secondly it's pretty far removed
from the central part of campus. Hoover's right in the
center and I think it would be a good thing to do
tomorrow. And we'll be kicked out before 5, but
that's good too.
At the end of the meeting, there was general agree
ment that ways must be found the next day to recruit a
larger group of participants for the "mobile strike,"
whether it would begin at the Computation Center or
elsewhere. Concern was expressed by four speakers that
the number remaining in Dinkelspiel was too small to
permit an effective "mobile strike." This was advanced
as the primary reason for calling a noon rally at White
Plaza on February 10.
A. PREFACE
The climactic events of February 10, on which the
remaining charges focus, did not occur without warning.
Rather, the preceding several days were characterized by
overt turbulence and escalating protest activities. To
understand the events of February 10, it is helpful to
have some background. We therefore now briefly sketch
events which convey the atmosphere of those days and
are pertinent to the remaining charges.
Dissatisfaction with the Indochina war was rising
again because of rumors that an invasion of Laos was
about to begin, perhaps with participation of American
armed forces. In addition, the Stanford Judicial Council
had been holding hearings on charges brought against
students who were accused of disrupting the January
speech of Henry Cabot Lodge. Professor Franklin and
his associates were strongly opposed to these charges and
to the campus judicial system in which they were being
considered.'
B. CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS PRIOR TO FEB
RUARY 10, 1971
On Saturday, February 6, at about 1 a.m., arson was
attempted on the small wooden building known as the
Free Market-the headquarters of the conservative Free
Campus Movement whose members frequently observe
and photograph demonstrations. Later Saturday evening,
at 9:40 p.m., Molotov cocktails were thrown into the
first-floor office of the ROTC building. Three false fire
alarms were registered soon thereafter at scattered points
on campus. Moments earlier, on the other side of the
campus firemen had responded to a fire in a trash barrel
behind Ventura Hall and a false alarm at the Boathouse.
On Sunday, February 7, the invasion of Laos by
South Vietnamese troops with U.S. air support was
officially announced. At 8 p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditori
um a crowd of some 600 persons attended a perfor
mance of the San Francisco Mime Troupe sponsored by
the Stanford Community Against War and Fascism.
Before the Mime Troupe began to perform, it was
announced that Laos had been invaded. A telegram sent
from Ann Arbor, Michigan by Madame Binh, head of the
North Vietnam delegation to the Paris Peace Talks, was
read which called "for mobilizing peace forces in your
country." The Coalition Against the War in Indochina
distributed a flyer entitled "It's Official!! Laos Has Been
Invaded," which spelled out Madame Binh's message in
detail and called for a rally at White Plaza on Monday,
February 8. Leaflets were distributed by a antiwar group
called The Inquisition, demanding that the University

"release all information on the uses of the Computation
Center" and that war research at the Center "immediate
ly be halted." In this leaflet the Stanford Research
Institute computer program known as Gamut-H was
described. The program was said to simulate the logistics
of deployment of helicopters and ships and the leaflet
asserted that the "work is directly applicable in Indo
china."
After the performance, at about 1 0:30 p.m., over 200
persons protesting the Laos invasion broke about 100
windows in several buildings, including the Graduate
School of Business, Undergraduate Library, Post Office,
Engineering Corner, Terman Engineering, Placement
Center, Cubberly Education, Lou Henry Hoover Build
ing, and the Inner Quad. In addition to campus police on
duty, 35 Sheriffs deputies were brought on to campus
briefly after the first reports of property destruction,
but the "trashing" quickly subsided and the deputies
were not deployed. Windows in two Stanford University
police cars were broken when spotlights from one of the
cars were focused on 15-30 demonstrators hurling rocks
into the Lou Henrv Hoover building. Fights broke out
between demonstrators and members of the Free Cam
pus Movement who were attempting to halt the trashing.
The University Computation Center was evacuated at
9:30 p.m. after a telephoned bomb threat was received,
but after a search people re-entered the facility. (This
was not the first threat to the Center. In the spring of
1970, a part of the computer complex in Polya Hall was
the target of arson, but quick action averted serious
damage.)
On Monday, February 8, the noon rally was attended
by about 800 in White Memorial Plaza. The leaflet from
The Inquisition on the SKI war-related computer pro
gram was distributed together with a flyer entitled "Do
It!" "Do It!" encouraged formation of tight affinity
groups to "do whatever actions you feel ready to do"
and stated "last night's action was the first in a scries in
response to the invasion of Laos." It anticipated trouble
with police and with "right wing fascists," and gave
suggestions for handling such trouble.
An "Open Letter to the Stanford Community" from
the Inquisition also became available at about this time.
It stated that the Computation Center was being used by
Stanford Research Institute for "war research." Six
demands were made in the letter, including making
public the identity of all non-Stanford users of Stanford
facilities and phasing out of all Stanford research funded
by the Department of Defense; attached to this letter
was reply made by Provost Miller to some of these
demands.
About 100 antiwar demonstrators left the rally and
then went to the near-empty Faculty Club dining room
searching for members of the Stanford Board of Trus
tees. The group then left for the Graduate School of
Business where at 1:25 p.m. about 150 persons jammed
into the ground level lobby, blocking entry to a room in
which a trustee committee was meeting and holding the
committee virtually under siege for 45 minutes. At 1:45
p.m., C.D. Marron of the Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Department declared it was an unlawful assembly, with
the group chanting back: "Power to the People." The
crowd dispersed when a squad of sheriff's deputies
appeared. One plain-clothesman suffered a head lacera
tion when hit by a thrown rock. At 2:30 p.m. about 24
police dispersed some 300 demonstrators who had re
assembled outside the ground floor of the Graduate
School of Business.
At about 2:45 p.m. part of the group of demonstra
tors headed for the Old Union. About 150 persons
arrived at the courtyard, and 50 of them proceeded into
the Union lobby. A meeting was then called in the
lobby, and the Old Union was selected as a "strike
center." At 5:30 p.m. about 20 Santa Clara Sheriffs
Deputies moved into the rear (West) of the Old Union,
sweeping about 40 remaining occupants into the court
yard. Simultaneously some 15 members of the San Jose
Tactical Squad moved to the front (East) of the Old
Union. At about 5:45 p.m. the San Jose units left the
scene. Subsequently, however, numerous squads of
Santa Clara County and San Jose police patrolled the
campus on foot as well as by car.
On Tuesday, February 9, there was an afternoon
meeting in the Physics Tank, following the Stanford
Judicial Council hearing, in which a "Cambodia-type
strike" protesting the invasion of Laos was planned. In
the evening, beginning at 8 p.m., a three-hour session
was held in Dinkelspiel Auditorium, attended at the
peak by approximately 800 people. A recording of the
meeting taped by KZSU is available, and an analysis of
the speeches at the session is presented in the following
section.
C. ANALYSIS OF THE DINKELSPIEL RALLY
SPEECHES OF FEBRUARY 9, 1971
An important part of the context for the three
speeches of Professor Franklin on February 10th is the
Dinkelspiel rally of February 9th. That lengthy evening
rally did much to set the stage for the events of the
following day. Its recurrent themes mav help in under
standing the meaning of some significant terms used in
the February 10th speeches of Professor Franklin.
Indeed, in the hearing Professor Franklin urged us to
consider this meeting carefully in order to understand
the subsequent events. He participated in the February
9th rally, made a speech there, and was referred to by
several other speakers. [See Appendix I] His leadership
position may reasonably be inferred from the tape of
this meeting.
Many speakers emphasized Stanford's complicity in
the war. They emphasized the necessity of concentrating
protest activity on the campus rather than off it, and
doing so in a powerful way that would impair the
University and hence the war effort.
There were repeated linkages of the war in Southeast
Asia with the struggle at Stanford, particularly in rela
tion to police on campus. The police were referred to as
pigs and were described as an occupation army. Harrass
ment of police was repeatedly advocated. One speaker
indicated that resistance to the occupation army could
best be carried out late at night. Some speakers pictured
the protesters at Stanford as sharing in a common effort
with the people of Southeast Asia, especially the NLF
and Pathet Lao. The following remarks, which were
made early in the rally and echoed later, exemplify this
approach:
What we have found through research and looking at
how the war is carried out is that it is an immensely
technological war and that Stanford is very useful.
And so the only reason that we would attack the
University would be on the grounds of effectiveness,
so I would try to direct the demands toward specific
things in the community and that are attackable like
the computer center, like the Gamut-H program
that's going on there. Also, in the past things like the
A3M have made other movements start so with the
effectiveness here and exemplary action for other
universities we hope to take to close out and down
things which we think are very valuable to the
carrying on of this type of war to make it that much
more costly.
This is followed by another speaker:
I think that we should take the strongest action
possible tomorrow and the next day and the next day
after that. But that we should also be addressing
ourselves to questions of, and the other things we can
begin to move on immediately are some of the
demands that have already been raised like ending the
occupa. . .the armed occupation of this community.
That kind of thing we should begin to move on
immediately.
There were many references to the Computation
Center. It was clearly the object of intense interest, both
for its alleged war complicity and for its vulnerability. It
emerged as the prime target for protest activity. The
discussion of the Computation Center may be illustrated
by a speech in the middle of the meeting:
I'm not even going to talk about a strike. It doesn't
matter either way. But what, I think that it's appa
rent that the place that has to be hit, and has to be
hit hardest and can be hit not only here but in every
college campus and in every city in the country, are
the computer centers, [applause, shouts of 'Right
on'] and they don't have to be hit violently. Com
puter centers are the most vulnerable places any
where. If, you've seen the lights blink every once in a
while with the power shortage, well, if that were to
happen in a computer center for a millisecond, the
computer has to be shut down, and reloaded. And
that's at least an hour delay. Now what does an hour
delay mean to a computer in the computer center?
Well, it could mean just an hour delay. It could mean
a day delay. It could mean a week delay. It could be a
month delay or a year delay, [laughterj. It's, nobody
knows. It's dependent upon what's destroyed in just
that power shortage. What's destroyed in core
storage. What's destroyed as to the records. What
could be destroyed in the tape reserve rooms by the
temperature going too high. Nobody knows.
[Laughter, by speaker and othersl
Other references to the Computation Center included
a variety of ways in which it might be shut down and
put out of service; for example, by blocking access to it
with hundreds or thousands of people, by attacking it,
even by destroying it. Occasionally, a word of caution
was expressed regarding the more violent possibilities.

At various points throughout the meeting, references
to coercive and violent protest activities were received
with applause or laughter. Acts such as seizing and
occupying a building for long periods tended to be
treated casually. Violent acts were sometimes spoken of
explicitly, and sometimes merely hinted at. Audience
response indicated that these hints evoked considerable
interest. Fifteen speakers advocated actions in protest on
the campus that were most likely coercive or violent in
nature. The following speech illustrates the treatment of
coercive behavior.
Yeah, let me straighten that out. I did not advocate
any kind of violence about this computer. I tried to
say that the beauty of the computer center was no
violence is necessary. None at all to get, to get what
you want. Simple little sitting in doorways with a
thousand people, you know, no violence. You don't
have to break a window. Not one single window. And
you can siiil affect problems with this computer
center. Without any destruction whatsoever. So
there's no violence that would be necessary, please.
(Laughter). . .is used by everybody. If you want to
hit industries, you hit the computer that they're
using. That stops them from functioning. But you
have to hit them with enough people to stop normal
access.
Several speakers, notably Braunstein, advocated
action on different levels, violent and non-violent, each
helping the protest movement in his own way. A
spectrum of activities was included, some of which were
clearly coercive and some even overtly violent. Imagina
tion was required to think of ways to disrupt the
functioning of the University and harass the police.
Altogether, six speakers favored pursuing this multi
ple-levels-of-action, approach, embracing a broad spec
trum of protest activities. The general tendency of these
speakers was to favor the more disruptive end of this
range of activities.
The flavor of this approach is well exemplified in the
speech of Braunstein, which is worth quoting in its
entirety.
One thing we've been noted for over the past few
years when we've done any action, and again tonight,
is a lack of imagination. And, you know, I'd like to
address this not to the people in this audience who
know how they're going to vote and are going to
participate in anything, but people listening on radio
wondering what can I do to relate to all this? How
can I help? I'm not willing to get busted in front of
the Computer Center. Or what have you. And there
are many ways, and all you have to do is just think
about it. Last night there were some people out
playing football who kept just dozens of police busy
asking for IDs all the time. At one point they tried to

bring the football into the Computer Center and it
was searched. The football, [applause] Things like
this that tie up the opposing forces, while are not
directly going to end the war in Vietnam, are making
other people's actions become more effective. And
anybody who says "1 can't relate to this movement
because 1 don't agree with your tactics" just has a bad
imagination, and you know, there are many levels of
other action. There are people breaking windows,
there are people who sit in front of the ROTC
building for days, and days, and days, after other
people got tired. These people just were there. They
deserve, you know, our unending thanks. And there
are other people who have done other things, who for
some reason or other don't want to claim credit for
it. All those people also deserve our thanks,
[applause] And. . . . [KZSU interrupts to say speaker
is Yale Braunstein] . . .like the guy who two years
ago drove into a power pole up in Woodside and put
the Computer Center out for a week. Now they've
built an emergency power system, but you know,
there are other actions both violent and non-violent,
imaginative and very mundane, all of which can help
us and everybody, even if you, you object to how the
final vote comes out, should find some way of
keeping them busy in their off hours and should
devote more and more of that time to helping the
Movement, [applause]
As the meeting proceeded, a suggestion made by
Janet Weiss elicited considerable acceptance: to adopt
the tactics of a "mobile strike." The word "strike" was
used often in the meeting. Some of the usage was
unclear, and most of it bore little relation to the usual
meaning of the term in a labor dispute—i.e., the con
certed withholding of labor on a voluntary basis. In the
latter part of the Dinkelspiel rally, consensus grew on
the "mobile strike" or "mobile strike force," as the
meeting's chairman referred to it. The "mobile strike"
was intended to be a series of disruptive acts, hopefully
leading to a total shutdown of the University. Occupa
tion of the Computation Center was considered a good
way to begin. Then, if the occupants were evicted by the
police, another building could be occupied, and then
other actions taken as issues and targets become appa
rent. Nine speakers forcefully advocated a "mobile
strike," clearly including coercive acts within the scope
of such a "strike." Since Janet Weiss' formulation
seemed to be quite influential, it is worth quoting her
remarks on this subject.
I've heard that at some places they've used a tactic of
shutting down one building with a large group of
people, and then going and shutting something else
down so that nothing is shut down continually but

things are shut down, you know a lot of things are,
are shut down at different times, and maybe that's
the kind of strike that would work here, maybe that's
the kind of thing that would keep people doing
something, keep them involved in it, so that you
don't feel like you're just sitting there all day, bored
and cold. 1 think another thing, though, that, one
thing that seems to me is clear that we need, whatever
kind of action we have as a focus, is a lot of other
little peripheral actions, like the actions about people
going out in groups and causing the pigs that are on
the campus to really have to do their jobs. People can
put up signs and posters in bathrooms and buildings,
and things. You see the pigs dont' go into the
buildings, and any number of things that we can do
from inside the building to cause a lot of disruption,
havoc and chaos on the campus, and to keep it from
functioning properly, without really risking a lot of
things and things that might be very pointed. Now
that's the kind of things that I can see in a strike that
would work, but I'd kind of like to, if we're going to
talk about a strike, I think that we should have some
idea of what we're talking about. Because I don't
think, maybe I'm wrong, that we're going to get a lot
of people interested in a strike which means people
sitting around in different doorways, very isolated
from each other for hours at a time.
Near the end of the meeting, the Hoover Institution
was still mentioned as an attractive target.
Well, anyway, I was going to suggest that if there is a
rally scheduled for tomorrow or however we are
going to do it, we should probably move from there,
when we'll have a crowd already, and 1 think we
should take over Hoover and that, you know, 1 think
that they wouldn't let us stay too long in Hoover
before they brought pigs on to campus in daytime
and, which would be, you know, a very nice thing to
happen, you know, for the "movement", I think. If
we went to the Comp. Center, first of all 1 don't
think we'd have enough people by tomorrow to go to
the Comp Center and secondly it's pretty far removed
from the central part of campus. Hoover's right in the
center and I think it would be a good thing to do
tomorrow. And we'll be kicked out before 5, but
that's good too.
At the end of the meeting, there was general agree
ment that ways must be found the next day to recruit a
larger group of participants for the "mobile strike,"
whether it would begin at the Computation Center or
elsewhere. Concern was expressed by four speakers that
the number remaining in Dinkelspiel was too small to
permit an effective "mobile strike." This was advanced
as the primary reason for calling a noon rally at White
Plaza on February 10.
A. PREFACE
The climactic events of February 10, on which the
remaining charges focus, did not occur without warning.
Rather, the preceding several days were characterized by
overt turbulence and escalating protest activities. To
understand the events of February 10, it is helpful to
have some background. We therefore now briefly sketch
events which convey the atmosphere of those days and
are pertinent to the remaining charges.
Dissatisfaction with the Indochina war was rising
again because of rumors that an invasion of Laos was
about to begin, perhaps with participation of American
armed forces. In addition, the Stanford Judicial Council
had been holding hearings on charges brought against
students who were accused of disrupting the January
speech of Henry Cabot Lodge. Professor Franklin and
his associates were strongly opposed to these charges and
to the campus judicial system in which they were being
considered.'
B. CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS PRIOR TO FEB
RUARY 10, 1971
On Saturday, February 6, at about 1 a.m., arson was
attempted on the small wooden building known as the
Free Market-the headquarters of the conservative Free
Campus Movement whose members frequently observe
and photograph demonstrations. Later Saturday evening,
at 9:40 p.m., Molotov cocktails were thrown into the
first-floor office of the ROTC building. Three false fire
alarms were registered soon thereafter at scattered points
on campus. Moments earlier, on the other side of the
campus firemen had responded to a fire in a trash barrel
behind Ventura Hall and a false alarm at the Boathouse.
On Sunday, February 7, the invasion of Laos by
South Vietnamese troops with U.S. air support was
officially announced. At 8 p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditori
um a crowd of some 600 persons attended a perfor
mance of the San Francisco Mime Troupe sponsored by
the Stanford Community Against War and Fascism.
Before the Mime Troupe began to perform, it was
announced that Laos had been invaded. A telegram sent
from Ann Arbor, Michigan by Madame Binh, head of the
North Vietnam delegation to the Paris Peace Talks, was
read which called "for mobilizing peace forces in your
country." The Coalition Against the War in Indochina
distributed a flyer entitled "It's Official!! Laos Has Been
Invaded," which spelled out Madame Binh's message in
detail and called for a rally at White Plaza on Monday,
February 8. Leaflets were distributed by a antiwar group
called The Inquisition, demanding that the University

"release all information on the uses of the Computation
Center" and that war research at the Center "immediate
ly be halted." In this leaflet the Stanford Research
Institute computer program known as Gamut-H was
described. The program was said to simulate the logistics
of deployment of helicopters and ships and the leaflet
asserted that the "work is directly applicable in Indo
china."
After the performance, at about 1 0:30 p.m., over 200
persons protesting the Laos invasion broke about 100
windows in several buildings, including the Graduate
School of Business, Undergraduate Library, Post Office,
Engineering Corner, Terman Engineering, Placement
Center, Cubberly Education, Lou Henry Hoover Build
ing, and the Inner Quad. In addition to campus police on
duty, 35 Sheriffs deputies were brought on to campus
briefly after the first reports of property destruction,
but the "trashing" quickly subsided and the deputies
were not deployed. Windows in two Stanford University
police cars were broken when spotlights from one of the
cars were focused on 15-30 demonstrators hurling rocks
into the Lou Henrv Hoover building. Fights broke out
between demonstrators and members of the Free Cam
pus Movement who were attempting to halt the trashing.
The University Computation Center was evacuated at
9:30 p.m. after a telephoned bomb threat was received,
but after a search people re-entered the facility. (This
was not the first threat to the Center. In the spring of
1970, a part of the computer complex in Polya Hall was
the target of arson, but quick action averted serious
damage.)
On Monday, February 8, the noon rally was attended
by about 800 in White Memorial Plaza. The leaflet from
The Inquisition on the SKI war-related computer pro
gram was distributed together with a flyer entitled "Do
It!" "Do It!" encouraged formation of tight affinity
groups to "do whatever actions you feel ready to do"
and stated "last night's action was the first in a scries in
response to the invasion of Laos." It anticipated trouble
with police and with "right wing fascists," and gave
suggestions for handling such trouble.
An "Open Letter to the Stanford Community" from
the Inquisition also became available at about this time.
It stated that the Computation Center was being used by
Stanford Research Institute for "war research." Six
demands were made in the letter, including making
public the identity of all non-Stanford users of Stanford
facilities and phasing out of all Stanford research funded
by the Department of Defense; attached to this letter
was reply made by Provost Miller to some of these
demands.
About 100 antiwar demonstrators left the rally and
then went to the near-empty Faculty Club dining room
searching for members of the Stanford Board of Trus
tees. The group then left for the Graduate School of
Business where at 1:25 p.m. about 150 persons jammed
into the ground level lobby, blocking entry to a room in
which a trustee committee was meeting and holding the
committee virtually under siege for 45 minutes. At 1:45
p.m., C.D. Marron of the Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Department declared it was an unlawful assembly, with
the group chanting back: "Power to the People." The
crowd dispersed when a squad of sheriff's deputies
appeared. One plain-clothesman suffered a head lacera
tion when hit by a thrown rock. At 2:30 p.m. about 24
police dispersed some 300 demonstrators who had re
assembled outside the ground floor of the Graduate
School of Business.
At about 2:45 p.m. part of the group of demonstra
tors headed for the Old Union. About 150 persons
arrived at the courtyard, and 50 of them proceeded into
the Union lobby. A meeting was then called in the
lobby, and the Old Union was selected as a "strike
center." At 5:30 p.m. about 20 Santa Clara Sheriffs
Deputies moved into the rear (West) of the Old Union,
sweeping about 40 remaining occupants into the court
yard. Simultaneously some 15 members of the San Jose
Tactical Squad moved to the front (East) of the Old
Union. At about 5:45 p.m. the San Jose units left the
scene. Subsequently, however, numerous squads of
Santa Clara County and San Jose police patrolled the
campus on foot as well as by car.
On Tuesday, February 9, there was an afternoon
meeting in the Physics Tank, following the Stanford
Judicial Council hearing, in which a "Cambodia-type
strike" protesting the invasion of Laos was planned. In
the evening, beginning at 8 p.m., a three-hour session
was held in Dinkelspiel Auditorium, attended at the
peak by approximately 800 people. A recording of the
meeting taped by KZSU is available, and an analysis of
the speeches at the session is presented in the following
section.
C. ANALYSIS OF THE DINKELSPIEL RALLY
SPEECHES OF FEBRUARY 9, 1971
An important part of the context for the three
speeches of Professor Franklin on February 10th is the
Dinkelspiel rally of February 9th. That lengthy evening
rally did much to set the stage for the events of the
following day. Its recurrent themes mav help in under
standing the meaning of some significant terms used in
the February 10th speeches of Professor Franklin.
Indeed, in the hearing Professor Franklin urged us to
consider this meeting carefully in order to understand
the subsequent events. He participated in the February
9th rally, made a speech there, and was referred to by
several other speakers. [See Appendix I] His leadership
position may reasonably be inferred from the tape of
this meeting.
Many speakers emphasized Stanford's complicity in
the war. They emphasized the necessity of concentrating
protest activity on the campus rather than off it, and
doing so in a powerful way that would impair the
University and hence the war effort.
There were repeated linkages of the war in Southeast
Asia with the struggle at Stanford, particularly in rela
tion to police on campus. The police were referred to as
pigs and were described as an occupation army. Harrass
ment of police was repeatedly advocated. One speaker
indicated that resistance to the occupation army could
best be carried out late at night. Some speakers pictured
the protesters at Stanford as sharing in a common effort
with the people of Southeast Asia, especially the NLF
and Pathet Lao. The following remarks, which were
made early in the rally and echoed later, exemplify this
approach:
What we have found through research and looking at
how the war is carried out is that it is an immensely
technological war and that Stanford is very useful.
And so the only reason that we would attack the
University would be on the grounds of effectiveness,
so I would try to direct the demands toward specific
things in the community and that are attackable like
the computer center, like the Gamut-H program
that's going on there. Also, in the past things like the
A3M have made other movements start so with the
effectiveness here and exemplary action for other
universities we hope to take to close out and down
things which we think are very valuable to the
carrying on of this type of war to make it that much
more costly.
This is followed by another speaker:
I think that we should take the strongest action
possible tomorrow and the next day and the next day
after that. But that we should also be addressing
ourselves to questions of, and the other things we can
begin to move on immediately are some of the
demands that have already been raised like ending the
occupa. . .the armed occupation of this community.
That kind of thing we should begin to move on
immediately.
There were many references to the Computation
Center. It was clearly the object of intense interest, both
for its alleged war complicity and for its vulnerability. It
emerged as the prime target for protest activity. The
discussion of the Computation Center may be illustrated
by a speech in the middle of the meeting:
I'm not even going to talk about a strike. It doesn't
matter either way. But what, I think that it's appa
rent that the place that has to be hit, and has to be
hit hardest and can be hit not only here but in every
college campus and in every city in the country, are
the computer centers, [applause, shouts of 'Right
on'] and they don't have to be hit violently. Com
puter centers are the most vulnerable places any
where. If, you've seen the lights blink every once in a
while with the power shortage, well, if that were to
happen in a computer center for a millisecond, the
computer has to be shut down, and reloaded. And
that's at least an hour delay. Now what does an hour
delay mean to a computer in the computer center?
Well, it could mean just an hour delay. It could mean
a day delay. It could mean a week delay. It could be a
month delay or a year delay, [laughterj. It's, nobody
knows. It's dependent upon what's destroyed in just
that power shortage. What's destroyed in core
storage. What's destroyed as to the records. What
could be destroyed in the tape reserve rooms by the
temperature going too high. Nobody knows.
[Laughter, by speaker and othersl
Other references to the Computation Center included
a variety of ways in which it might be shut down and
put out of service; for example, by blocking access to it
with hundreds or thousands of people, by attacking it,
even by destroying it. Occasionally, a word of caution
was expressed regarding the more violent possibilities.

At various points throughout the meeting, references
to coercive and violent protest activities were received
with applause or laughter. Acts such as seizing and
occupying a building for long periods tended to be
treated casually. Violent acts were sometimes spoken of
explicitly, and sometimes merely hinted at. Audience
response indicated that these hints evoked considerable
interest. Fifteen speakers advocated actions in protest on
the campus that were most likely coercive or violent in
nature. The following speech illustrates the treatment of
coercive behavior.
Yeah, let me straighten that out. I did not advocate
any kind of violence about this computer. I tried to
say that the beauty of the computer center was no
violence is necessary. None at all to get, to get what
you want. Simple little sitting in doorways with a
thousand people, you know, no violence. You don't
have to break a window. Not one single window. And
you can siiil affect problems with this computer
center. Without any destruction whatsoever. So
there's no violence that would be necessary, please.
(Laughter). . .is used by everybody. If you want to
hit industries, you hit the computer that they're
using. That stops them from functioning. But you
have to hit them with enough people to stop normal
access.
Several speakers, notably Braunstein, advocated
action on different levels, violent and non-violent, each
helping the protest movement in his own way. A
spectrum of activities was included, some of which were
clearly coercive and some even overtly violent. Imagina
tion was required to think of ways to disrupt the
functioning of the University and harass the police.
Altogether, six speakers favored pursuing this multi
ple-levels-of-action, approach, embracing a broad spec
trum of protest activities. The general tendency of these
speakers was to favor the more disruptive end of this
range of activities.
The flavor of this approach is well exemplified in the
speech of Braunstein, which is worth quoting in its
entirety.
One thing we've been noted for over the past few
years when we've done any action, and again tonight,
is a lack of imagination. And, you know, I'd like to
address this not to the people in this audience who
know how they're going to vote and are going to
participate in anything, but people listening on radio
wondering what can I do to relate to all this? How
can I help? I'm not willing to get busted in front of
the Computer Center. Or what have you. And there
are many ways, and all you have to do is just think
about it. Last night there were some people out
playing football who kept just dozens of police busy
asking for IDs all the time. At one point they tried to

bring the football into the Computer Center and it
was searched. The football, [applause] Things like
this that tie up the opposing forces, while are not
directly going to end the war in Vietnam, are making
other people's actions become more effective. And
anybody who says "1 can't relate to this movement
because 1 don't agree with your tactics" just has a bad
imagination, and you know, there are many levels of
other action. There are people breaking windows,
there are people who sit in front of the ROTC
building for days, and days, and days, after other
people got tired. These people just were there. They
deserve, you know, our unending thanks. And there
are other people who have done other things, who for
some reason or other don't want to claim credit for
it. All those people also deserve our thanks,
[applause] And. . . . [KZSU interrupts to say speaker
is Yale Braunstein] . . .like the guy who two years
ago drove into a power pole up in Woodside and put
the Computer Center out for a week. Now they've
built an emergency power system, but you know,
there are other actions both violent and non-violent,
imaginative and very mundane, all of which can help
us and everybody, even if you, you object to how the
final vote comes out, should find some way of
keeping them busy in their off hours and should
devote more and more of that time to helping the
Movement, [applause]
As the meeting proceeded, a suggestion made by
Janet Weiss elicited considerable acceptance: to adopt
the tactics of a "mobile strike." The word "strike" was
used often in the meeting. Some of the usage was
unclear, and most of it bore little relation to the usual
meaning of the term in a labor dispute—i.e., the con
certed withholding of labor on a voluntary basis. In the
latter part of the Dinkelspiel rally, consensus grew on
the "mobile strike" or "mobile strike force," as the
meeting's chairman referred to it. The "mobile strike"
was intended to be a series of disruptive acts, hopefully
leading to a total shutdown of the University. Occupa
tion of the Computation Center was considered a good
way to begin. Then, if the occupants were evicted by the
police, another building could be occupied, and then
other actions taken as issues and targets become appa
rent. Nine speakers forcefully advocated a "mobile
strike," clearly including coercive acts within the scope
of such a "strike." Since Janet Weiss' formulation
seemed to be quite influential, it is worth quoting her
remarks on this subject.
I've heard that at some places they've used a tactic of
shutting down one building with a large group of
people, and then going and shutting something else
down so that nothing is shut down continually but

things are shut down, you know a lot of things are,
are shut down at different times, and maybe that's
the kind of strike that would work here, maybe that's
the kind of thing that would keep people doing
something, keep them involved in it, so that you
don't feel like you're just sitting there all day, bored
and cold. 1 think another thing, though, that, one
thing that seems to me is clear that we need, whatever
kind of action we have as a focus, is a lot of other
little peripheral actions, like the actions about people
going out in groups and causing the pigs that are on
the campus to really have to do their jobs. People can
put up signs and posters in bathrooms and buildings,
and things. You see the pigs dont' go into the
buildings, and any number of things that we can do
from inside the building to cause a lot of disruption,
havoc and chaos on the campus, and to keep it from
functioning properly, without really risking a lot of
things and things that might be very pointed. Now
that's the kind of things that I can see in a strike that
would work, but I'd kind of like to, if we're going to
talk about a strike, I think that we should have some
idea of what we're talking about. Because I don't
think, maybe I'm wrong, that we're going to get a lot
of people interested in a strike which means people
sitting around in different doorways, very isolated
from each other for hours at a time.
Near the end of the meeting, the Hoover Institution
was still mentioned as an attractive target.
Well, anyway, I was going to suggest that if there is a
rally scheduled for tomorrow or however we are
going to do it, we should probably move from there,
when we'll have a crowd already, and 1 think we
should take over Hoover and that, you know, 1 think
that they wouldn't let us stay too long in Hoover
before they brought pigs on to campus in daytime
and, which would be, you know, a very nice thing to
happen, you know, for the "movement", I think. If
we went to the Comp. Center, first of all 1 don't
think we'd have enough people by tomorrow to go to
the Comp Center and secondly it's pretty far removed
from the central part of campus. Hoover's right in the
center and I think it would be a good thing to do
tomorrow. And we'll be kicked out before 5, but
that's good too.
At the end of the meeting, there was general agree
ment that ways must be found the next day to recruit a
larger group of participants for the "mobile strike,"
whether it would begin at the Computation Center or
elsewhere. Concern was expressed by four speakers that
the number remaining in Dinkelspiel was too small to
permit an effective "mobile strike." This was advanced
as the primary reason for calling a noon rally at White
Plaza on February 10.
A. PREFACE
The climactic events of February 10, on which the
remaining charges focus, did not occur without warning.
Rather, the preceding several days were characterized by
overt turbulence and escalating protest activities. To
understand the events of February 10, it is helpful to
have some background. We therefore now briefly sketch
events which convey the atmosphere of those days and
are pertinent to the remaining charges.
Dissatisfaction with the Indochina war was rising
again because of rumors that an invasion of Laos was
about to begin, perhaps with participation of American
armed forces. In addition, the Stanford Judicial Council
had been holding hearings on charges brought against
students who were accused of disrupting the January
speech of Henry Cabot Lodge. Professor Franklin and
his associates were strongly opposed to these charges and
to the campus judicial system in which they were being
considered.'
B. CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS PRIOR TO FEB
RUARY 10, 1971
On Saturday, February 6, at about 1 a.m., arson was
attempted on the small wooden building known as the
Free Market-the headquarters of the conservative Free
Campus Movement whose members frequently observe
and photograph demonstrations. Later Saturday evening,
at 9:40 p.m., Molotov cocktails were thrown into the
first-floor office of the ROTC building. Three false fire
alarms were registered soon thereafter at scattered points
on campus. Moments earlier, on the other side of the
campus firemen had responded to a fire in a trash barrel
behind Ventura Hall and a false alarm at the Boathouse.
On Sunday, February 7, the invasion of Laos by
South Vietnamese troops with U.S. air support was
officially announced. At 8 p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditori
um a crowd of some 600 persons attended a perfor
mance of the San Francisco Mime Troupe sponsored by
the Stanford Community Against War and Fascism.
Before the Mime Troupe began to perform, it was
announced that Laos had been invaded. A telegram sent
from Ann Arbor, Michigan by Madame Binh, head of the
North Vietnam delegation to the Paris Peace Talks, was
read which called "for mobilizing peace forces in your
country." The Coalition Against the War in Indochina
distributed a flyer entitled "It's Official!! Laos Has Been
Invaded," which spelled out Madame Binh's message in
detail and called for a rally at White Plaza on Monday,
February 8. Leaflets were distributed by a antiwar group
called The Inquisition, demanding that the University

"release all information on the uses of the Computation
Center" and that war research at the Center "immediate
ly be halted." In this leaflet the Stanford Research
Institute computer program known as Gamut-H was
described. The program was said to simulate the logistics
of deployment of helicopters and ships and the leaflet
asserted that the "work is directly applicable in Indo
china."
After the performance, at about 1 0:30 p.m., over 200
persons protesting the Laos invasion broke about 100
windows in several buildings, including the Graduate
School of Business, Undergraduate Library, Post Office,
Engineering Corner, Terman Engineering, Placement
Center, Cubberly Education, Lou Henry Hoover Build
ing, and the Inner Quad. In addition to campus police on
duty, 35 Sheriffs deputies were brought on to campus
briefly after the first reports of property destruction,
but the "trashing" quickly subsided and the deputies
were not deployed. Windows in two Stanford University
police cars were broken when spotlights from one of the
cars were focused on 15-30 demonstrators hurling rocks
into the Lou Henrv Hoover building. Fights broke out
between demonstrators and members of the Free Cam
pus Movement who were attempting to halt the trashing.
The University Computation Center was evacuated at
9:30 p.m. after a telephoned bomb threat was received,
but after a search people re-entered the facility. (This
was not the first threat to the Center. In the spring of
1970, a part of the computer complex in Polya Hall was
the target of arson, but quick action averted serious
damage.)
On Monday, February 8, the noon rally was attended
by about 800 in White Memorial Plaza. The leaflet from
The Inquisition on the SKI war-related computer pro
gram was distributed together with a flyer entitled "Do
It!" "Do It!" encouraged formation of tight affinity
groups to "do whatever actions you feel ready to do"
and stated "last night's action was the first in a scries in
response to the invasion of Laos." It anticipated trouble
with police and with "right wing fascists," and gave
suggestions for handling such trouble.
An "Open Letter to the Stanford Community" from
the Inquisition also became available at about this time.
It stated that the Computation Center was being used by
Stanford Research Institute for "war research." Six
demands were made in the letter, including making
public the identity of all non-Stanford users of Stanford
facilities and phasing out of all Stanford research funded
by the Department of Defense; attached to this letter
was reply made by Provost Miller to some of these
demands.
About 100 antiwar demonstrators left the rally and
then went to the near-empty Faculty Club dining room
searching for members of the Stanford Board of Trus
tees. The group then left for the Graduate School of
Business where at 1:25 p.m. about 150 persons jammed
into the ground level lobby, blocking entry to a room in
which a trustee committee was meeting and holding the
committee virtually under siege for 45 minutes. At 1:45
p.m., C.D. Marron of the Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Department declared it was an unlawful assembly, with
the group chanting back: "Power to the People." The
crowd dispersed when a squad of sheriff's deputies
appeared. One plain-clothesman suffered a head lacera
tion when hit by a thrown rock. At 2:30 p.m. about 24
police dispersed some 300 demonstrators who had re
assembled outside the ground floor of the Graduate
School of Business.
At about 2:45 p.m. part of the group of demonstra
tors headed for the Old Union. About 150 persons
arrived at the courtyard, and 50 of them proceeded into
the Union lobby. A meeting was then called in the
lobby, and the Old Union was selected as a "strike
center." At 5:30 p.m. about 20 Santa Clara Sheriffs
Deputies moved into the rear (West) of the Old Union,
sweeping about 40 remaining occupants into the court
yard. Simultaneously some 15 members of the San Jose
Tactical Squad moved to the front (East) of the Old
Union. At about 5:45 p.m. the San Jose units left the
scene. Subsequently, however, numerous squads of
Santa Clara County and San Jose police patrolled the
campus on foot as well as by car.
On Tuesday, February 9, there was an afternoon
meeting in the Physics Tank, following the Stanford
Judicial Council hearing, in which a "Cambodia-type
strike" protesting the invasion of Laos was planned. In
the evening, beginning at 8 p.m., a three-hour session
was held in Dinkelspiel Auditorium, attended at the
peak by approximately 800 people. A recording of the
meeting taped by KZSU is available, and an analysis of
the speeches at the session is presented in the following
section.
C. ANALYSIS OF THE DINKELSPIEL RALLY
SPEECHES OF FEBRUARY 9, 1971
An important part of the context for the three
speeches of Professor Franklin on February 10th is the
Dinkelspiel rally of February 9th. That lengthy evening
rally did much to set the stage for the events of the
following day. Its recurrent themes mav help in under
standing the meaning of some significant terms used in
the February 10th speeches of Professor Franklin.
Indeed, in the hearing Professor Franklin urged us to
consider this meeting carefully in order to understand
the subsequent events. He participated in the February
9th rally, made a speech there, and was referred to by
several other speakers. [See Appendix I] His leadership
position may reasonably be inferred from the tape of
this meeting.
Many speakers emphasized Stanford's complicity in
the war. They emphasized the necessity of concentrating
protest activity on the campus rather than off it, and
doing so in a powerful way that would impair the
University and hence the war effort.
There were repeated linkages of the war in Southeast
Asia with the struggle at Stanford, particularly in rela
tion to police on campus. The police were referred to as
pigs and were described as an occupation army. Harrass
ment of police was repeatedly advocated. One speaker
indicated that resistance to the occupation army could
best be carried out late at night. Some speakers pictured
the protesters at Stanford as sharing in a common effort
with the people of Southeast Asia, especially the NLF
and Pathet Lao. The following remarks, which were
made early in the rally and echoed later, exemplify this
approach:
What we have found through research and looking at
how the war is carried out is that it is an immensely
technological war and that Stanford is very useful.
And so the only reason that we would attack the
University would be on the grounds of effectiveness,
so I would try to direct the demands toward specific
things in the community and that are attackable like
the computer center, like the Gamut-H program
that's going on there. Also, in the past things like the
A3M have made other movements start so with the
effectiveness here and exemplary action for other
universities we hope to take to close out and down
things which we think are very valuable to the
carrying on of this type of war to make it that much
more costly.
This is followed by another speaker:
I think that we should take the strongest action
possible tomorrow and the next day and the next day
after that. But that we should also be addressing
ourselves to questions of, and the other things we can
begin to move on immediately are some of the
demands that have already been raised like ending the
occupa. . .the armed occupation of this community.
That kind of thing we should begin to move on
immediately.
There were many references to the Computation
Center. It was clearly the object of intense interest, both
for its alleged war complicity and for its vulnerability. It
emerged as the prime target for protest activity. The
discussion of the Computation Center may be illustrated
by a speech in the middle of the meeting:
I'm not even going to talk about a strike. It doesn't
matter either way. But what, I think that it's appa
rent that the place that has to be hit, and has to be
hit hardest and can be hit not only here but in every
college campus and in every city in the country, are
the computer centers, [applause, shouts of 'Right
on'] and they don't have to be hit violently. Com
puter centers are the most vulnerable places any
where. If, you've seen the lights blink every once in a
while with the power shortage, well, if that were to
happen in a computer center for a millisecond, the
computer has to be shut down, and reloaded. And
that's at least an hour delay. Now what does an hour
delay mean to a computer in the computer center?
Well, it could mean just an hour delay. It could mean
a day delay. It could mean a week delay. It could be a
month delay or a year delay, [laughterj. It's, nobody
knows. It's dependent upon what's destroyed in just
that power shortage. What's destroyed in core
storage. What's destroyed as to the records. What
could be destroyed in the tape reserve rooms by the
temperature going too high. Nobody knows.
[Laughter, by speaker and othersl
Other references to the Computation Center included
a variety of ways in which it might be shut down and
put out of service; for example, by blocking access to it
with hundreds or thousands of people, by attacking it,
even by destroying it. Occasionally, a word of caution
was expressed regarding the more violent possibilities.

At various points throughout the meeting, references
to coercive and violent protest activities were received
with applause or laughter. Acts such as seizing and
occupying a building for long periods tended to be
treated casually. Violent acts were sometimes spoken of
explicitly, and sometimes merely hinted at. Audience
response indicated that these hints evoked considerable
interest. Fifteen speakers advocated actions in protest on
the campus that were most likely coercive or violent in
nature. The following speech illustrates the treatment of
coercive behavior.
Yeah, let me straighten that out. I did not advocate
any kind of violence about this computer. I tried to
say that the beauty of the computer center was no
violence is necessary. None at all to get, to get what
you want. Simple little sitting in doorways with a
thousand people, you know, no violence. You don't
have to break a window. Not one single window. And
you can siiil affect problems with this computer
center. Without any destruction whatsoever. So
there's no violence that would be necessary, please.
(Laughter). . .is used by everybody. If you want to
hit industries, you hit the computer that they're
using. That stops them from functioning. But you
have to hit them with enough people to stop normal
access.
Several speakers, notably Braunstein, advocated
action on different levels, violent and non-violent, each
helping the protest movement in his own way. A
spectrum of activities was included, some of which were
clearly coercive and some even overtly violent. Imagina
tion was required to think of ways to disrupt the
functioning of the University and harass the police.
Altogether, six speakers favored pursuing this multi
ple-levels-of-action, approach, embracing a broad spec
trum of protest activities. The general tendency of these
speakers was to favor the more disruptive end of this
range of activities.
The flavor of this approach is well exemplified in the
speech of Braunstein, which is worth quoting in its
entirety.
One thing we've been noted for over the past few
years when we've done any action, and again tonight,
is a lack of imagination. And, you know, I'd like to
address this not to the people in this audience who
know how they're going to vote and are going to
participate in anything, but people listening on radio
wondering what can I do to relate to all this? How
can I help? I'm not willing to get busted in front of
the Computer Center. Or what have you. And there
are many ways, and all you have to do is just think
about it. Last night there were some people out
playing football who kept just dozens of police busy
asking for IDs all the time. At one point they tried to

bring the football into the Computer Center and it
was searched. The football, [applause] Things like
this that tie up the opposing forces, while are not
directly going to end the war in Vietnam, are making
other people's actions become more effective. And
anybody who says "1 can't relate to this movement
because 1 don't agree with your tactics" just has a bad
imagination, and you know, there are many levels of
other action. There are people breaking windows,
there are people who sit in front of the ROTC
building for days, and days, and days, after other
people got tired. These people just were there. They
deserve, you know, our unending thanks. And there
are other people who have done other things, who for
some reason or other don't want to claim credit for
it. All those people also deserve our thanks,
[applause] And. . . . [KZSU interrupts to say speaker
is Yale Braunstein] . . .like the guy who two years
ago drove into a power pole up in Woodside and put
the Computer Center out for a week. Now they've
built an emergency power system, but you know,
there are other actions both violent and non-violent,
imaginative and very mundane, all of which can help
us and everybody, even if you, you object to how the
final vote comes out, should find some way of
keeping them busy in their off hours and should
devote more and more of that time to helping the
Movement, [applause]
As the meeting proceeded, a suggestion made by
Janet Weiss elicited considerable acceptance: to adopt
the tactics of a "mobile strike." The word "strike" was
used often in the meeting. Some of the usage was
unclear, and most of it bore little relation to the usual
meaning of the term in a labor dispute—i.e., the con
certed withholding of labor on a voluntary basis. In the
latter part of the Dinkelspiel rally, consensus grew on
the "mobile strike" or "mobile strike force," as the
meeting's chairman referred to it. The "mobile strike"
was intended to be a series of disruptive acts, hopefully
leading to a total shutdown of the University. Occupa
tion of the Computation Center was considered a good
way to begin. Then, if the occupants were evicted by the
police, another building could be occupied, and then
other actions taken as issues and targets become appa
rent. Nine speakers forcefully advocated a "mobile
strike," clearly including coercive acts within the scope
of such a "strike." Since Janet Weiss' formulation
seemed to be quite influential, it is worth quoting her
remarks on this subject.
I've heard that at some places they've used a tactic of
shutting down one building with a large group of
people, and then going and shutting something else
down so that nothing is shut down continually but

things are shut down, you know a lot of things are,
are shut down at different times, and maybe that's
the kind of strike that would work here, maybe that's
the kind of thing that would keep people doing
something, keep them involved in it, so that you
don't feel like you're just sitting there all day, bored
and cold. 1 think another thing, though, that, one
thing that seems to me is clear that we need, whatever
kind of action we have as a focus, is a lot of other
little peripheral actions, like the actions about people
going out in groups and causing the pigs that are on
the campus to really have to do their jobs. People can
put up signs and posters in bathrooms and buildings,
and things. You see the pigs dont' go into the
buildings, and any number of things that we can do
from inside the building to cause a lot of disruption,
havoc and chaos on the campus, and to keep it from
functioning properly, without really risking a lot of
things and things that might be very pointed. Now
that's the kind of things that I can see in a strike that
would work, but I'd kind of like to, if we're going to
talk about a strike, I think that we should have some
idea of what we're talking about. Because I don't
think, maybe I'm wrong, that we're going to get a lot
of people interested in a strike which means people
sitting around in different doorways, very isolated
from each other for hours at a time.
Near the end of the meeting, the Hoover Institution
was still mentioned as an attractive target.
Well, anyway, I was going to suggest that if there is a
rally scheduled for tomorrow or however we are
going to do it, we should probably move from there,
when we'll have a crowd already, and 1 think we
should take over Hoover and that, you know, 1 think
that they wouldn't let us stay too long in Hoover
before they brought pigs on to campus in daytime
and, which would be, you know, a very nice thing to
happen, you know, for the "movement", I think. If
we went to the Comp. Center, first of all 1 don't
think we'd have enough people by tomorrow to go to
the Comp Center and secondly it's pretty far removed
from the central part of campus. Hoover's right in the
center and I think it would be a good thing to do
tomorrow. And we'll be kicked out before 5, but
that's good too.
At the end of the meeting, there was general agree
ment that ways must be found the next day to recruit a
larger group of participants for the "mobile strike,"
whether it would begin at the Computation Center or
elsewhere. Concern was expressed by four speakers that
the number remaining in Dinkelspiel was too small to
permit an effective "mobile strike." This was advanced
as the primary reason for calling a noon rally at White
Plaza on February 10.
A. PREFACE
The climactic events of February 10, on which the
remaining charges focus, did not occur without warning.
Rather, the preceding several days were characterized by
overt turbulence and escalating protest activities. To
understand the events of February 10, it is helpful to
have some background. We therefore now briefly sketch
events which convey the atmosphere of those days and
are pertinent to the remaining charges.
Dissatisfaction with the Indochina war was rising
again because of rumors that an invasion of Laos was
about to begin, perhaps with participation of American
armed forces. In addition, the Stanford Judicial Council
had been holding hearings on charges brought against
students who were accused of disrupting the January
speech of Henry Cabot Lodge. Professor Franklin and
his associates were strongly opposed to these charges and
to the campus judicial system in which they were being
considered.'
B. CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS PRIOR TO FEB
RUARY 10, 1971
On Saturday, February 6, at about 1 a.m., arson was
attempted on the small wooden building known as the
Free Market-the headquarters of the conservative Free
Campus Movement whose members frequently observe
and photograph demonstrations. Later Saturday evening,
at 9:40 p.m., Molotov cocktails were thrown into the
first-floor office of the ROTC building. Three false fire
alarms were registered soon thereafter at scattered points
on campus. Moments earlier, on the other side of the
campus firemen had responded to a fire in a trash barrel
behind Ventura Hall and a false alarm at the Boathouse.
On Sunday, February 7, the invasion of Laos by
South Vietnamese troops with U.S. air support was
officially announced. At 8 p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditori
um a crowd of some 600 persons attended a perfor
mance of the San Francisco Mime Troupe sponsored by
the Stanford Community Against War and Fascism.
Before the Mime Troupe began to perform, it was
announced that Laos had been invaded. A telegram sent
from Ann Arbor, Michigan by Madame Binh, head of the
North Vietnam delegation to the Paris Peace Talks, was
read which called "for mobilizing peace forces in your
country." The Coalition Against the War in Indochina
distributed a flyer entitled "It's Official!! Laos Has Been
Invaded," which spelled out Madame Binh's message in
detail and called for a rally at White Plaza on Monday,
February 8. Leaflets were distributed by a antiwar group
called The Inquisition, demanding that the University

"release all information on the uses of the Computation
Center" and that war research at the Center "immediate
ly be halted." In this leaflet the Stanford Research
Institute computer program known as Gamut-H was
described. The program was said to simulate the logistics
of deployment of helicopters and ships and the leaflet
asserted that the "work is directly applicable in Indo
china."
After the performance, at about 1 0:30 p.m., over 200
persons protesting the Laos invasion broke about 100
windows in several buildings, including the Graduate
School of Business, Undergraduate Library, Post Office,
Engineering Corner, Terman Engineering, Placement
Center, Cubberly Education, Lou Henry Hoover Build
ing, and the Inner Quad. In addition to campus police on
duty, 35 Sheriffs deputies were brought on to campus
briefly after the first reports of property destruction,
but the "trashing" quickly subsided and the deputies
were not deployed. Windows in two Stanford University
police cars were broken when spotlights from one of the
cars were focused on 15-30 demonstrators hurling rocks
into the Lou Henrv Hoover building. Fights broke out
between demonstrators and members of the Free Cam
pus Movement who were attempting to halt the trashing.
The University Computation Center was evacuated at
9:30 p.m. after a telephoned bomb threat was received,
but after a search people re-entered the facility. (This
was not the first threat to the Center. In the spring of
1970, a part of the computer complex in Polya Hall was
the target of arson, but quick action averted serious
damage.)
On Monday, February 8, the noon rally was attended
by about 800 in White Memorial Plaza. The leaflet from
The Inquisition on the SKI war-related computer pro
gram was distributed together with a flyer entitled "Do
It!" "Do It!" encouraged formation of tight affinity
groups to "do whatever actions you feel ready to do"
and stated "last night's action was the first in a scries in
response to the invasion of Laos." It anticipated trouble
with police and with "right wing fascists," and gave
suggestions for handling such trouble.
An "Open Letter to the Stanford Community" from
the Inquisition also became available at about this time.
It stated that the Computation Center was being used by
Stanford Research Institute for "war research." Six
demands were made in the letter, including making
public the identity of all non-Stanford users of Stanford
facilities and phasing out of all Stanford research funded
by the Department of Defense; attached to this letter
was reply made by Provost Miller to some of these
demands.
About 100 antiwar demonstrators left the rally and
then went to the near-empty Faculty Club dining room
searching for members of the Stanford Board of Trus
tees. The group then left for the Graduate School of
Business where at 1:25 p.m. about 150 persons jammed
into the ground level lobby, blocking entry to a room in
which a trustee committee was meeting and holding the
committee virtually under siege for 45 minutes. At 1:45
p.m., C.D. Marron of the Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Department declared it was an unlawful assembly, with
the group chanting back: "Power to the People." The
crowd dispersed when a squad of sheriff's deputies
appeared. One plain-clothesman suffered a head lacera
tion when hit by a thrown rock. At 2:30 p.m. about 24
police dispersed some 300 demonstrators who had re
assembled outside the ground floor of the Graduate
School of Business.
At about 2:45 p.m. part of the group of demonstra
tors headed for the Old Union. About 150 persons
arrived at the courtyard, and 50 of them proceeded into
the Union lobby. A meeting was then called in the
lobby, and the Old Union was selected as a "strike
center." At 5:30 p.m. about 20 Santa Clara Sheriffs
Deputies moved into the rear (West) of the Old Union,
sweeping about 40 remaining occupants into the court
yard. Simultaneously some 15 members of the San Jose
Tactical Squad moved to the front (East) of the Old
Union. At about 5:45 p.m. the San Jose units left the
scene. Subsequently, however, numerous squads of
Santa Clara County and San Jose police patrolled the
campus on foot as well as by car.
On Tuesday, February 9, there was an afternoon
meeting in the Physics Tank, following the Stanford
Judicial Council hearing, in which a "Cambodia-type
strike" protesting the invasion of Laos was planned. In
the evening, beginning at 8 p.m., a three-hour session
was held in Dinkelspiel Auditorium, attended at the
peak by approximately 800 people. A recording of the
meeting taped by KZSU is available, and an analysis of
the speeches at the session is presented in the following
section.
C. ANALYSIS OF THE DINKELSPIEL RALLY
SPEECHES OF FEBRUARY 9, 1971
An important part of the context for the three
speeches of Professor Franklin on February 10th is the
Dinkelspiel rally of February 9th. That lengthy evening
rally did much to set the stage for the events of the
following day. Its recurrent themes mav help in under
standing the meaning of some significant terms used in
the February 10th speeches of Professor Franklin.
Indeed, in the hearing Professor Franklin urged us to
consider this meeting carefully in order to understand
the subsequent events. He participated in the February
9th rally, made a speech there, and was referred to by
several other speakers. [See Appendix I] His leadership
position may reasonably be inferred from the tape of
this meeting.
Many speakers emphasized Stanford's complicity in
the war. They emphasized the necessity of concentrating
protest activity on the campus rather than off it, and
doing so in a powerful way that would impair the
University and hence the war effort.
There were repeated linkages of the war in Southeast
Asia with the struggle at Stanford, particularly in rela
tion to police on campus. The police were referred to as
pigs and were described as an occupation army. Harrass
ment of police was repeatedly advocated. One speaker
indicated that resistance to the occupation army could
best be carried out late at night. Some speakers pictured
the protesters at Stanford as sharing in a common effort
with the people of Southeast Asia, especially the NLF
and Pathet Lao. The following remarks, which were
made early in the rally and echoed later, exemplify this
approach:
What we have found through research and looking at
how the war is carried out is that it is an immensely
technological war and that Stanford is very useful.
And so the only reason that we would attack the
University would be on the grounds of effectiveness,
so I would try to direct the demands toward specific
things in the community and that are attackable like
the computer center, like the Gamut-H program
that's going on there. Also, in the past things like the
A3M have made other movements start so with the
effectiveness here and exemplary action for other
universities we hope to take to close out and down
things which we think are very valuable to the
carrying on of this type of war to make it that much
more costly.
This is followed by another speaker:
I think that we should take the strongest action
possible tomorrow and the next day and the next day
after that. But that we should also be addressing
ourselves to questions of, and the other things we can
begin to move on immediately are some of the
demands that have already been raised like ending the
occupa. . .the armed occupation of this community.
That kind of thing we should begin to move on
immediately.
There were many references to the Computation
Center. It was clearly the object of intense interest, both
for its alleged war complicity and for its vulnerability. It
emerged as the prime target for protest activity. The
discussion of the Computation Center may be illustrated
by a speech in the middle of the meeting:
I'm not even going to talk about a strike. It doesn't
matter either way. But what, I think that it's appa
rent that the place that has to be hit, and has to be
hit hardest and can be hit not only here but in every
college campus and in every city in the country, are
the computer centers, [applause, shouts of 'Right
on'] and they don't have to be hit violently. Com
puter centers are the most vulnerable places any
where. If, you've seen the lights blink every once in a
while with the power shortage, well, if that were to
happen in a computer center for a millisecond, the
computer has to be shut down, and reloaded. And
that's at least an hour delay. Now what does an hour
delay mean to a computer in the computer center?
Well, it could mean just an hour delay. It could mean
a day delay. It could mean a week delay. It could be a
month delay or a year delay, [laughterj. It's, nobody
knows. It's dependent upon what's destroyed in just
that power shortage. What's destroyed in core
storage. What's destroyed as to the records. What
could be destroyed in the tape reserve rooms by the
temperature going too high. Nobody knows.
[Laughter, by speaker and othersl
Other references to the Computation Center included
a variety of ways in which it might be shut down and
put out of service; for example, by blocking access to it
with hundreds or thousands of people, by attacking it,
even by destroying it. Occasionally, a word of caution
was expressed regarding the more violent possibilities.

At various points throughout the meeting, references
to coercive and violent protest activities were received
with applause or laughter. Acts such as seizing and
occupying a building for long periods tended to be
treated casually. Violent acts were sometimes spoken of
explicitly, and sometimes merely hinted at. Audience
response indicated that these hints evoked considerable
interest. Fifteen speakers advocated actions in protest on
the campus that were most likely coercive or violent in
nature. The following speech illustrates the treatment of
coercive behavior.
Yeah, let me straighten that out. I did not advocate
any kind of violence about this computer. I tried to
say that the beauty of the computer center was no
violence is necessary. None at all to get, to get what
you want. Simple little sitting in doorways with a
thousand people, you know, no violence. You don't
have to break a window. Not one single window. And
you can siiil affect problems with this computer
center. Without any destruction whatsoever. So
there's no violence that would be necessary, please.
(Laughter). . .is used by everybody. If you want to
hit industries, you hit the computer that they're
using. That stops them from functioning. But you
have to hit them with enough people to stop normal
access.
Several speakers, notably Braunstein, advocated
action on different levels, violent and non-violent, each
helping the protest movement in his own way. A
spectrum of activities was included, some of which were
clearly coercive and some even overtly violent. Imagina
tion was required to think of ways to disrupt the
functioning of the University and harass the police.
Altogether, six speakers favored pursuing this multi
ple-levels-of-action, approach, embracing a broad spec
trum of protest activities. The general tendency of these
speakers was to favor the more disruptive end of this
range of activities.
The flavor of this approach is well exemplified in the
speech of Braunstein, which is worth quoting in its
entirety.
One thing we've been noted for over the past few
years when we've done any action, and again tonight,
is a lack of imagination. And, you know, I'd like to
address this not to the people in this audience who
know how they're going to vote and are going to
participate in anything, but people listening on radio
wondering what can I do to relate to all this? How
can I help? I'm not willing to get busted in front of
the Computer Center. Or what have you. And there
are many ways, and all you have to do is just think
about it. Last night there were some people out
playing football who kept just dozens of police busy
asking for IDs all the time. At one point they tried to

bring the football into the Computer Center and it
was searched. The football, [applause] Things like
this that tie up the opposing forces, while are not
directly going to end the war in Vietnam, are making
other people's actions become more effective. And
anybody who says "1 can't relate to this movement
because 1 don't agree with your tactics" just has a bad
imagination, and you know, there are many levels of
other action. There are people breaking windows,
there are people who sit in front of the ROTC
building for days, and days, and days, after other
people got tired. These people just were there. They
deserve, you know, our unending thanks. And there
are other people who have done other things, who for
some reason or other don't want to claim credit for
it. All those people also deserve our thanks,
[applause] And. . . . [KZSU interrupts to say speaker
is Yale Braunstein] . . .like the guy who two years
ago drove into a power pole up in Woodside and put
the Computer Center out for a week. Now they've
built an emergency power system, but you know,
there are other actions both violent and non-violent,
imaginative and very mundane, all of which can help
us and everybody, even if you, you object to how the
final vote comes out, should find some way of
keeping them busy in their off hours and should
devote more and more of that time to helping the
Movement, [applause]
As the meeting proceeded, a suggestion made by
Janet Weiss elicited considerable acceptance: to adopt
the tactics of a "mobile strike." The word "strike" was
used often in the meeting. Some of the usage was
unclear, and most of it bore little relation to the usual
meaning of the term in a labor dispute—i.e., the con
certed withholding of labor on a voluntary basis. In the
latter part of the Dinkelspiel rally, consensus grew on
the "mobile strike" or "mobile strike force," as the
meeting's chairman referred to it. The "mobile strike"
was intended to be a series of disruptive acts, hopefully
leading to a total shutdown of the University. Occupa
tion of the Computation Center was considered a good
way to begin. Then, if the occupants were evicted by the
police, another building could be occupied, and then
other actions taken as issues and targets become appa
rent. Nine speakers forcefully advocated a "mobile
strike," clearly including coercive acts within the scope
of such a "strike." Since Janet Weiss' formulation
seemed to be quite influential, it is worth quoting her
remarks on this subject.
I've heard that at some places they've used a tactic of
shutting down one building with a large group of
people, and then going and shutting something else
down so that nothing is shut down continually but

things are shut down, you know a lot of things are,
are shut down at different times, and maybe that's
the kind of strike that would work here, maybe that's
the kind of thing that would keep people doing
something, keep them involved in it, so that you
don't feel like you're just sitting there all day, bored
and cold. 1 think another thing, though, that, one
thing that seems to me is clear that we need, whatever
kind of action we have as a focus, is a lot of other
little peripheral actions, like the actions about people
going out in groups and causing the pigs that are on
the campus to really have to do their jobs. People can
put up signs and posters in bathrooms and buildings,
and things. You see the pigs dont' go into the
buildings, and any number of things that we can do
from inside the building to cause a lot of disruption,
havoc and chaos on the campus, and to keep it from
functioning properly, without really risking a lot of
things and things that might be very pointed. Now
that's the kind of things that I can see in a strike that
would work, but I'd kind of like to, if we're going to
talk about a strike, I think that we should have some
idea of what we're talking about. Because I don't
think, maybe I'm wrong, that we're going to get a lot
of people interested in a strike which means people
sitting around in different doorways, very isolated
from each other for hours at a time.
Near the end of the meeting, the Hoover Institution
was still mentioned as an attractive target.
Well, anyway, I was going to suggest that if there is a
rally scheduled for tomorrow or however we are
going to do it, we should probably move from there,
when we'll have a crowd already, and 1 think we
should take over Hoover and that, you know, 1 think
that they wouldn't let us stay too long in Hoover
before they brought pigs on to campus in daytime
and, which would be, you know, a very nice thing to
happen, you know, for the "movement", I think. If
we went to the Comp. Center, first of all 1 don't
think we'd have enough people by tomorrow to go to
the Comp Center and secondly it's pretty far removed
from the central part of campus. Hoover's right in the
center and I think it would be a good thing to do
tomorrow. And we'll be kicked out before 5, but
that's good too.
At the end of the meeting, there was general agree
ment that ways must be found the next day to recruit a
larger group of participants for the "mobile strike,"
whether it would begin at the Computation Center or
elsewhere. Concern was expressed by four speakers that
the number remaining in Dinkelspiel was too small to
permit an effective "mobile strike." This was advanced
