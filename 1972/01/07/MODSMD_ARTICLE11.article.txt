# Background To Events Of February 10, 1971
## 
### 
A. PREFACE
The climactic events of February 10, on which the
remaining charges focus, did not occur without warning.
Rather, the preceding several days were characterized by
overt turbulence and escalating protest activities. To
understand the events of February 10, it is helpful to
have some background. We therefore now briefly sketch
events which convey the atmosphere of those days and
are pertinent to the remaining charges.
Dissatisfaction with the Indochina war was rising
again because of rumors that an invasion of Laos was
about to begin, perhaps with participation of American
armed forces. In addition, the Stanford Judicial Council
had been holding hearings on charges brought against
students who were accused of disrupting the January
speech of Henry Cabot Lodge. Professor Franklin and
his associates were strongly opposed to these charges and
to the campus judicial system in which they were being
considered.'
B. CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS PRIOR TO FEB
RUARY 10, 1971
On Saturday, February 6, at about 1 a.m., arson was
attempted on the small wooden building known as the
Free Market-the headquarters of the conservative Free
Campus Movement whose members frequently observe
and photograph demonstrations. Later Saturday evening,
at 9:40 p.m., Molotov cocktails were thrown into the
first-floor office of the ROTC building. Three false fire
alarms were registered soon thereafter at scattered points
on campus. Moments earlier, on the other side of the
campus firemen had responded to a fire in a trash barrel
behind Ventura Hall and a false alarm at the Boathouse.
On Sunday, February 7, the invasion of Laos by
South Vietnamese troops with U.S. air support was
officially announced. At 8 p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditori
um a crowd of some 600 persons attended a perfor
mance of the San Francisco Mime Troupe sponsored by
the Stanford Community Against War and Fascism.
Before the Mime Troupe began to perform, it was
announced that Laos had been invaded. A telegram sent
from Ann Arbor, Michigan by Madame Binh, head of the
North Vietnam delegation to the Paris Peace Talks, was
read which called "for mobilizing peace forces in your
country." The Coalition Against the War in Indochina
distributed a flyer entitled "It's Official!! Laos Has Been
Invaded," which spelled out Madame Binh's message in
detail and called for a rally at White Plaza on Monday,
February 8. Leaflets were distributed by a antiwar group
called The Inquisition, demanding that the University

"release all information on the uses of the Computation
Center" and that war research at the Center "immediate
ly be halted." In this leaflet the Stanford Research
Institute computer program known as Gamut-H was
described. The program was said to simulate the logistics
of deployment of helicopters and ships and the leaflet
asserted that the "work is directly applicable in Indo
china."
After the performance, at about 1 0:30 p.m., over 200
persons protesting the Laos invasion broke about 100
windows in several buildings, including the Graduate
School of Business, Undergraduate Library, Post Office,
Engineering Corner, Terman Engineering, Placement
Center, Cubberly Education, Lou Henry Hoover Build
ing, and the Inner Quad. In addition to campus police on
duty, 35 Sheriffs deputies were brought on to campus
briefly after the first reports of property destruction,
but the "trashing" quickly subsided and the deputies
were not deployed. Windows in two Stanford University
police cars were broken when spotlights from one of the
cars were focused on 15-30 demonstrators hurling rocks
into the Lou Henrv Hoover building. Fights broke out
between demonstrators and members of the Free Cam
pus Movement who were attempting to halt the trashing.
The University Computation Center was evacuated at
9:30 p.m. after a telephoned bomb threat was received,
but after a search people re-entered the facility. (This
was not the first threat to the Center. In the spring of
1970, a part of the computer complex in Polya Hall was
the target of arson, but quick action averted serious
damage.)
On Monday, February 8, the noon rally was attended
by about 800 in White Memorial Plaza. The leaflet from
The Inquisition on the SKI war-related computer pro
gram was distributed together with a flyer entitled "Do
It!" "Do It!" encouraged formation of tight affinity
groups to "do whatever actions you feel ready to do"
and stated "last night's action was the first in a scries in
response to the invasion of Laos." It anticipated trouble
with police and with "right wing fascists," and gave
suggestions for handling such trouble.
An "Open Letter to the Stanford Community" from
the Inquisition also became available at about this time.
It stated that the Computation Center was being used by
Stanford Research Institute for "war research." Six
demands were made in the letter, including making
public the identity of all non-Stanford users of Stanford
facilities and phasing out of all Stanford research funded
by the Department of Defense; attached to this letter
