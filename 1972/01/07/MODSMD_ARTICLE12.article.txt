# Advisory Board Findings: White Plaza Incident
## 
### 
A. CHARGES
The relevant University charges concerning the White
Plaza incident are contained in Paragraph 8 of the
"Statement of Charges" dated March 22, 1971. This
paragraph reads as follows:
8. On February 10, 1971, beginning at about 12
p.m., a rally was held at White Memorial Plaza to,
among other things, discuss methods of protesting
developments in the war in Indochina. Over tive
humdred students and other persons attended. During
the course of the rally two prinicpal courses of action
were discussed, one being to work in the non-Univer
sity community to bring about changes in govern
ment policy, the other being to disrupt University
functions and business. Professor Franklin intention
ally urged and incited students and other persons
present at the rally to follow the latter course of
action and specifically to shut down a University
computer facility known as the Computation Center.
Shortly thereafter a large number of students and
others left the rally and went to the Computation
Center whereupon many of these persons did in fact
occupy the Computation Center, prevent its opera
tion and obstruct movement in and out of the
building for several hours, terminating this unlawful
activity only when ordered to leave the building by
the police.
B. NATURE OF THE CHARGE
The general charge is that Professor Franklin urged
and incited the disruption of University functions; the
specific charge is that he urged and incited his audience
to shut down a University facility, the Computation
Center. Effectively, this means that his words, including
their delivery and their context, significantly increased
the likelihood of prohibited conduct on the part of his
audience; it means, moreover, that he must have anti
cipated that his speech, given its delivery and context,
would significantly increase the imminent likelihood of
prohibited conduct.
C. FINDINGS OF FACT
/. Prominent Themes in the White Plaza Rally
The noon-hour rally at White Plaza, attended at its
peak by about 700 people, had been proposed the night
before at the conclusion of a rally at Dinkelspiel Audi
torium. Most of the speeches given at the White Plaza
rally were available on tape recordings. Only a portion at
the outset was missing, and this was covered in testi
mony. The following themes emerged prominently in
the course of the White Plaza rally:
a. Many speakers discussed ways of protesting the
war in Southeast Asia. Three speakers, including two
student body leaders, favored an off-cainpus focus of
protest. They were severely criticized by five subsequent
speakers, who characterized liberal war protest in such
terms as "counter-insurgency." This may be illustrated
by the following speech:
Yeah, I'd just like to point out that the only time the
liberals and moderates come out of the woodwork is
when there is radical action on campus. . . .That's the
only way moderates and liberals can, can get off their
asses, is when the people around them are doing these
violent things which you consider to be useless.
b. On four occasions, there was reference to selection
of a protest target on campus; the desirability of alterna
tive possibilities was considered.
c. The Computation Center was referred to often
throughout the meeting. Its suitability as a protest target
was cited. In the final speech of the rally, Professor
Franklin called for shutting down the Computation
Center.
d. Some speakers emphasized Stanford's war com
plicity and the desirability of shutting down the Univer
sity in order to end that complicity.
e. Four speakers made reference to the concept of

different people taking protest action on different levels,
each doing his own thing. Three of these clearly included
coercive and violent behavior within the spectrum of
approved activities, and the fourth is unclear on this
poin<. The following quotations help to clarify this
important theme:
And so closing down Stanford is really a concrete
blow against the war. You see, that's a concrete way
of stopping, stopping things that are going on that
help the war by stopping that kind of research, by
stopping the programs that are run in the computer
center....
It's true that if we're writing letters to congressmen
we're probably not doing that much. But by striking
the University and by taking, by taking whatever
kinds of action we can, you see, on a lot of different
levels, some people may want to take over buildings,
some people will want to boycott class, some people
will want to cause classes to be boycotted, you see
it's not much good if English classes and the French
class aren't going on, but the Business School classes
and the Electronic Engineering classes are going on
and the Department of Defense research contracts are
still being carried out.
KZSU: The crowd is still growing here at White Plaza,
now about 700 people.
[new speaker] What really amazes me is like every
body that's here right now is like obviously against
the war. Now all this friction and all this bullshit
that's going on between radicals and conservatives
and liberals or whoever the fuck it is, it's all just
friction. Now, as long as people who are writing
letters or doing strikes, or breaking windows or what,
everybody's doing their own thing to stop that
fucking war over there. So, everybody do their own
thing, and let's stop that war now and altogether,
[applause]
112. The term "strike" was used several times, though
less than it had been the previous night at the Dinkel
spiel rally. Once again, it seemed to bear little relation to
the meaning of "strike" in labor disputes. Rather, it
seemed to refer to a broad spectrum of activities, some
non-coercive and some coercive. The most prominent
connotation was that of the "mobile strike" introduced
February 9th at Dinkelspiel—closing down one universi
ty facility after another by whatever means proved
feasible.
g. Six speakers made favorable reference to coercive
or violent behavior. This may be illustrated by a
recorded passage from Professor Franklin's speech:
. . .so want to talk about, about high consciousness,
the high consciousness is the consciousness of the
people most oppressed by U.S. imperialism, which
includes as a main institution of that Stanford
University. And that's why whenever people from
that community, whenever poor working class youth
from that community, get a chance to come on the
campus at Stanford and do a little material damage,
they are very eager to do so. Because they recognize
what Stanford University is, even if people here
don't.
2. Summary of Professor Franklin's speech
Professor Franklin gave the closing and longest speech
of the rally. (See Appendix II.) He called for a
willingness to sacrifice in the service of protest activity.
He criticized student body leaders for allegedly subvert
ing the activity of protesters. He gave some of his
personal history in antiwar activity. He cited a poll
indicating that people with little education expressed
more opposition to the war in Southeast Asia than those
with higher levels of education.
At the passage quoted earlier, referring to material
damage by working class youth at Stanford, Professor
Franklin's delivery shifted to a higher intensity, remain

ing at this level until the conclusion. He continued later,
Well, when we talk about, see we're just ripping off
the term strike when talking about striking at
Stanford. This isn't a strike. We're not risking
anything. It's a voluntary boycott—a shutdown of
some of the activities of the University as a demon
stration of something. Now, now what we called a
strike last year, and it lasted really about three days
and it kind of dragged on, and you know, in an odds
and ends way and some people did it. But just the
fact that we were able to move our little finger that
much, that electrified the working people of this
area.. ..
He ended the speech by saying,
See, now what we're asking is for people to make that
little tiny gesture to show that we're willing to
inconvenience ourselves a little bit and to begin to
shut down the most obvious machinery of war, such
as, and I think it is a good target, that Computation
Center, [applause and shouts of "right on. .. ."]
Immediately after Professor Franklin's speech, the
chairman asked for a vote to choose between the
Computation Center and Hoover. About 100 hands
(primarily in front) voted affirmatively on the question
of shutting down the former, whereupon the chairman
announced that a majority favored this course. He said,
"And so I would suggest that we go over there and visit
it." At that point, a voice is heard calling, "Shut it
down," echoing the comment made just before by
Professor Franklin and the meeting's chairman.
As the crowd was leaving they were instructed,
When people go over to the Comp Center, they
should all go in a group and move relatively slowly so
that the group can stay together. Also the meeting at
8 o'clock tonight in the Old Union Courtyard is a
very important meeting because we can decide what
we want to do tomorrow. There are some things that
we can't close down now, but we can close them
down if we get to them early in the morning.
3. Interpretation of the Meaning of Professor Frank
lin 's White Plaza Speech
a. Professor Franklin's Own Interpretation
There were several differing points of view regarding
the meaning of the speech given by Professor Franklin.
Professor Franklin himself in an affidavit dated February
24, 1971 described the meaning of his speech:
Actually, in order to understand either the content of
my speech or that of the rally itself, it is necessary to
see it in relation to the events of the previous evening.
The debate was essentially over the same issues, that
is, whether to focus off campus or call for a strike on
campus, and whether a strike could be effective.
Much of the debate was repetitious of the previous
night, but since most of the people at that meeting
felt bound by the vote, those who had wanted to stop
the munition train did not make their proposal. The
main spokesmen for off-campus work were Bob
Grant and Larry Diamond, who proposed doing
precinct work to elect so-called peace candidates. It
was my belief that these two were not being honest,
and that their main purpose was to prevent any
effective action and to advance their own political
careers. It was with this in mind, plus a sense that
many people were becoming very impatient with the
idle debate of the rally, that I rose to speak. My
intention was, as it had been the previous night, to
build the anti-war movement on the campus. ...
He concluded this portion of the affidavit:
Let's move our little finger again and begin to pick up
where we left off with our strike last spring. Let's
begin to shut down the machinery of war. I think
that the suggested target of the computer center is as
good a place to begin as any. So the content of the
entire speech was to strike against the invasion ol
Laos. In making this speech, and the one on the
preceding night, I thought that I was operating
entirely within the precedent established during the
invasion of Cambodia when the overwhelming majori
ty of the faculty and students of the majority of
departments and schools of the University voted to
go on strike. For instance, my own department on
May 4, 1970 voted overwhelmingly in favor of a
strike for an indefinite period, demanding: 1. An
immediate withdrawal ol all American forces from
Southeast Asia; 2. The end of political repression at
home, in particular the government's systematic
attempt to eliminate the Black Panther and other
political dissidents; 3. The removal of KOTC from
the Stanford campus by the end of the academic
quarter; 4. An end to all war-related and secret
research on the Stanford campus by the end of the
quarter.
In the hearing, he described the meaning of his speech
in essentially similar terms.
b. Hearing Witnesses' Interpretation
University Administration witnesses testified that the
crowd was moved by Professor Franklin's speech and
that he served as a catalyst to get the group moving in
the direction of the Computation Center. One of
Professor Franklin's witnesses felt that the Computation
Center was an appropriate target. He said that a
"shutdown" of the University could range from "blast
various parts of it from the face of Santa Clara County"
to taking over a building as had occurred at Lncina Hall
the year before. One of liis witnesses testified that
Professor Franklin was trying to bring factions together
but didn't influence tactics already decided; two felt the
decision to go to the Computation Center had been
arrived at the night before and the purpose of the speech
was to support a Cambodia-type strike; two thought
Professor Franklin's speech was just educational; two
thought that he was not as influential as a middle-aged
salesman who had spoken earlier; one felt that the
purpose of the White Plaza rally was to choose a target
and to recruit more people.
4. Summary of Principal Points oj Defense
Several prominent elements recurred in defense testi
mony and argument on the White Plaza speech:
(a) A widespread inclination to shut down the
Computation Center, and to carry out a variety of
disruptive activities, was formed over the preceding
several days. It was justified in terms of Stanford's
complicity in the war and the Gamut-H program at
the Computation Center. It was consistent with
long-standing antipathy to the war in Asia and to
Stanford's allegedly vital role in the war. It was
exacerbated by the current news of military action in
Laos.
(b) Such an inclination toward disruptive activity in
general, and toward the Computation Center in
particular, was widespread in and around the Univer
sity, especially in the "movement." The persons
inclined to these actions would have carried them out
regardless of any role Professor Franklin might have
had in encouraging, fostering or facilitating them.
(c) Professor Franklin's speech had little effect on
those present. It was political, analytical, and educa
tional, rather than tactical. It presented no danger to
persons or property.
(d) He was simply advocating a voluntary boycott or
legal strike at the Computation Center. Even if his
speech could be construed as advocating disruption of
the Computation Center, he had in mind no seriously
adverse consequences-only a vigorous mode of pro
test of the war and the University's role in it.
5. Analysis of Professor Franklin's White Plaza
Speech, February 10.
a. Background and Foreseeable Consequences of
Computation Center Occupation
The fact that potential for major damage within the
Computation Center existed must have been well known
to Professor Franklin. The mechanisms to achieve such
damage were thoroughly identified during the Dinkel
spiel meeting the previous night. Highly publicized
computer occupations leading to extensive damage had
recently occurred at other universities. Testimony in
dicates that the decision not to damage the computer in
the face of eviction by the police was taken by the
demonstrators after the occupation was in force. Pro
fessor Franklin could reasonably expect that an occupa
tion of the Computation Center would involve great
risks to the computer and to the members of the
University community who rely upon it, including the
staff of the Computation Center. It should be empha
sized that the research and education of many people
throughout the University were in jeopardy.
In some respects a computer plays a role in a modern
university not unlike that of a library: it receives,
catalogues, processes and stores information and it
makes it available in various forms as required. To attack
a computation center because some of its information is
considered evil is little different from attacking an entire
library for harboring a few evil books. Professor Franklin
should have known that the occupation of the Computa
tion Center would lead to an agonizing decision by the
University administration whether to request police to
evict the occupiers, thereby ending a costly seizure at
the expense of an increased risk of damage.
The demonstrators showed no serious inclination to
consider the genuine complexities of computer use.
They made minimal inquiry about uses of the computer
—considering only on-line medical use, and not investiga
ting even that use thoroughly. They showed no concern
for the relation of the computer to other problems
involving human welfare. As a consequence of their
action, 700 to 800 jobs were not run that day; no one
knows how many more would have been impaired if the
occupiers had not been evicted. The social cost of
vigilante action in regard to computers or similar
facilities can become very high.
We heard no evidence that demonstrators made any
serious attempt to communicate with responsible of
ficers of the University in order to inquire about the
state of the Gamut-H program, or the ways in which
research policies are administered in regard to computer
use, prior to the forceful occupation of the Center.
Indeed, one of Professor Franklin's witnesses testified
that the Gamut-H program was known to the "move
ment" for a week or two, but a decision was made to
delay its announcement pending a favorable moment for
protest activity. The military action in Laos provided
such an opportunity. If the news of Gamut-H could be
held a week or two in private, why was instant action
suddenly required on February 10? Professor Franklin
and his witnesses agreed that advocacy towards shut
down of the Computation Center proceeded on the basis
of publications and statements of The Inquisition;
shutdown of the Computation Center was certainly not

a last resort measure. Thus, a poorly checked complaint
was made public after a tactical delay and then rapidly
shifted into coercive action with only the most rudi
mentary attempt at negotiating the grievance. Finally, in
view of the expressed rationale for forceful occupation
of the Computation Center, it is noteworthy that the
Gamut-H program was not even mentioned at any point
in the lengthy tape recording of the White Plaza rally.
b. The Speech Itself
Professor Franklin urged the Board to consider his
speeches in their full context. He particularly called our
attention to protests at Stanford, to the events of the
preceding few days, and to the Dinkelspiel rally of
February 9. These have been summarized earlier.
Throughout these turbulent events, a persistent differ
ence of opinion is manifested between those who place
primary emphasis on the University's role in the war and
those who place primary emphasis on the role of the
government. Professor Franklin clearly belongs in the
former category. In a Dinkelspiel speech of February 9th
and the White Plaza speech of February 10th, he is
severely critical of the University's role in fostering the
design and execution of the war. He strongly urges his
listeners to direct their attention to the University,
expressing hostility toward its trustees, administration,
and some student body leaders. He views the University
as centrally culpable in the war, and directs attention
away from the federal government. This characterization
of the University has the effect of justifying strong
protest or retaliation.
Within this framework, the "movement" chose to
focus attention on the Computation Center as a symbol
and instrument of the war. The February 9th rally is full
of angry references to the Computation Center—the
culpability of its users, its vulnerability, its suitability for
attack and possibly even for destruction. Professor
Franklin must have been aware of this danger to the
Computation Center-to its functions, its hardware, and
to the large number of people who rely upon it in their
work. These matters had been discussed extensively at
the February 9th rally in which he was an active
participant. He also took part in an investigatory march
that followed the February 9th rally, a preparation for
the likelihood of disruptive action the following day. He
admits in testimony and argument that he gave strong
support to the correctness of action against the Compu
tation Center before, during, and after its occupation,
specifically including the White Plaza rally.
In the main, the purpose of the White Plaza rally of
February 10th appears to have been: (1) to increase the
numbers available for protest activity; (2) to settle
firmly on a target. In respect to (2) the Computation
Center appeared to be the most likely target as a result
of the February 9th meeting, but the Hoover Institution
was still under consideration; two student leaders advo
cated nondisruptive political activity, but they were
strongly criticized by Professor Franklin and others.
Professor Franklin was a highly respected leader of a
group advocating intense hostility to the University as
well as disdain for nondisruptive modes of protest and
for electoral politics. His White Plaza speech contains an
approving reference to material damage to Stanlord
University, and his testimony on these events provides
repeated justification for such damage. At White Plaza
on February 10th, this orientation was brought sharply
to bear on the Computation Center.
It is uncontested that at the White Plaza rally
Professor Franklin concluded his speech by stating
". . .what we are asking is.. .to begin to shut down the
most obvious machinery of war, such as, and I think it is
a good target, that Computation Center.. ." and that
subsequently the Stanford Computation Center, al
though officially declared closed, was forcefully oc
cupied, resulting in shutdown of operation and minor

damage. It is also uncontested that many of the
occupiers were in the audience of Professor Franklin's
speech.
Professor Franklin has also asserted that a firm
decision to shut down the Computation Center was
already reached on February 9, and that therefore his
speech on February 10 could not have contributed to
the subsequent course of events. The evidence does not
support the assertion. The meeting on February 9th held
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium identified a spectrum of
options for action, and two-action against the Hoover
Institution and against the Computation Center-were
left as leading candidates. The preceding summary of
Dinkelspiel (February 9) and White Pla/.a (February 10)
rallies makes this clear. Moreover, several witnesses (both
for the administration and for Professor Franklin)
testified that specific action against the University was
not settled, or that they were undecided whether to
participate in the Computation Center action until they
attended this rally at which Professor Franklin gave the
final speech.
C. Professor Franklin's Use of the Term "Strike "
The Board has found it helpful to pay special
attention to the context for subsequent events provided
by the Dinkelspiel rally of the night of February 9th.
Both the University Administration and Professor Frank
lin devoted considerable attention to this background. In
that connection, we think it important to note that
Professor Franklin himself placed special emphasis dur
ing the hearing on the importance of that rally for
providing context. For that reason, we find the introduc
tion to his own analysis of that topic in this supplemen
tary written brief (page 106) rather unreasonable. He
says"The administration attempts to prove that the real
meaning of Franklin's speech can be found lurking in
several statements gleaned from the lengthy meeting at
Dinkelspiel." If the Administration did so, it was at
Professor Franklin's own invitation.
Our view of the matter is that Professor Franklin was
right the first time: the Dinkelspiel rally does provide
important insights into the speech that follows. It is
analyzed extensively above, in the section on "Back
ground to Events of February 10, 1972." We here
comment on the view presented by Prolessor Franklin in
his supplementary written brief. The main thrust of his
argument is that the rally was a very general discussion,
organized primarily along the lines of planning a strike;
he says (p. 109) "The reason there were no plans for a
picket sign is that there were no plans for anything
beyond a meeting and a general sort of strike." He also
asserts (p. 107) "There was never a real discussion of the
variety of ways the Computer Center could be shut
down except along the general lines of a strike."
In fact, his account tends to select heavily those
speeches from the Dinkelspiel rally that emphasize the
non-coercive aspects of the kind of "strike" he is talking
about. For example, he ignores the following speech
early in the rally:
And so the only reason that we would attack the
University would be on the grounds of effectiveness,
though I would try to direct the demands toward
specific things in the community and that are
attackable like the Computation Center.. . .
In addition, there are two other early calJs to stop
talking and commence action. Later, Braunstein recom
mends a range of actions, including some that lie well
outside the range of legal actions that is subsumed under
the term "strike" when used in its normal context.
Indeed, the term "strike" clearly has a different
meaning to members of the "movement" at Stanford
than it does in ordinary usage. When preceded by the
modifying words "Cambodia-type," it encompasses a

wide range of actions, including some that are legal and
some that are illegal. The introduction of the concept of
a "mobile strike," which takes place well before the end
of the Dinkelspiel rally, was clearly a modification
introduced by numerical considerations: it was argued
that the number of people was inadequate to close a
number of things simultaneously, but that they might
succeed if targets were attacked seriatim. It is clear that
in all of these uses, the term "strike" encompasses a
wide range of activities. In his supplementary written
brief, Professor Franklin borrows the conventional
meaning from the labor context, and then employs it as
a flag in which to wrap a much broader range of
conduct. All of the speakers who spoke late in the rally,
after they had developed some consensus around the
notion of "mobile strike" and were discussing a target,
used language that clearly involves the expectation of
being confronted by the police, moved out of buildings,
and the like. Persuading workers to leave their jobs,
standing in the doorways to bear "moral witness,"
picketing — these activities get little or no prominence in
the discussion, although Professor Franklin tries to
persuade us that these activities are really the dominant
elements of a "strike." The context so established is not
substantially changed, in our view, by the earlier
speakers at the White Plaza rally.
The words "shut it down" imply a cessation of
function that can sometimes be achieved by a strike,
strictly defined, but may be achieved by other means as
well. From a careful reading of the Dinkelspiel trans
cript, we are persuaded that the context for the White
Plaza rally was one in which the prospective shutting
down of the Computation Center was to be achieved
primarily by means going beyond the range of legal
"strike" tactics. We find Professor Franklin's use of the
term "strike" disingenuous, and we believe that his own
exhortation to "shut down" the Computation Center
was, given that context, an intentional invitation to
employ such extra-legal means as might be necessary.
In summary, could Professor Franklin reasonably
have expected that his speech would have contributed to
the likelihood of the occupation? Professor Franklin
asserts that he was only advocating a legal strike or
voluntary boycott of the Computation Center, or
alternatively that he gave no thoughts at all to the
consequences of his speech. The preceding analysis of
the Dinkelspiel rally makes this a highly dubious
proposition. Although there clearly were discussions of a
"strike" against Stanford University during the rally at
Dinkelspiel and during the early portions of the White
Plaza rally, there is no evidence of preparation for a legal
strike or boycott: no plans for picketing; no direct effort
at persuasion of the workers of the Computation Center
to withhold their labor or for the users of the Center to
boycott the facility. In the present context, the term
"strike" was a kind of euphemism for a broad range of
protest activities, including peaceful, coercive and vio
lent activities. We conclude that Professor Franklin must
reasonably have expected that his advocacy of "shut
down" would be interpreted by at least a substantial
portion of the audience as calling for forceful disruption
of the operation of the Center. Indeed, we believe that
this is what he meant.
CONCLUSION
We conclude that Professor Franklin must reasonably
have expected that his speech at White Plaza on
February 10, 1971, would increase the likelihood of
illegal occupation of the Computation Center immedi
ately following his speech, and that there was risk of
serious damage to the computer and its users. The Board
finds the evidence strongly persuasive that Professor
Franklin urged and incited his audience at White Plaza
towards disruption of University functions and shut
down of the Computation Center. We therefore sustain
charge No. 8.
A. CHARGES
The relevant University charges concerning the White
Plaza incident are contained in Paragraph 8 of the
"Statement of Charges" dated March 22, 1971. This
paragraph reads as follows:
8. On February 10, 1971, beginning at about 12
p.m., a rally was held at White Memorial Plaza to,
among other things, discuss methods of protesting
developments in the war in Indochina. Over tive
humdred students and other persons attended. During
the course of the rally two prinicpal courses of action
were discussed, one being to work in the non-Univer
sity community to bring about changes in govern
ment policy, the other being to disrupt University
functions and business. Professor Franklin intention
ally urged and incited students and other persons
present at the rally to follow the latter course of
action and specifically to shut down a University
computer facility known as the Computation Center.
Shortly thereafter a large number of students and
others left the rally and went to the Computation
Center whereupon many of these persons did in fact
occupy the Computation Center, prevent its opera
tion and obstruct movement in and out of the
building for several hours, terminating this unlawful
activity only when ordered to leave the building by
the police.
B. NATURE OF THE CHARGE
The general charge is that Professor Franklin urged
and incited the disruption of University functions; the
specific charge is that he urged and incited his audience
to shut down a University facility, the Computation
Center. Effectively, this means that his words, including
their delivery and their context, significantly increased
the likelihood of prohibited conduct on the part of his
audience; it means, moreover, that he must have anti
cipated that his speech, given its delivery and context,
would significantly increase the imminent likelihood of
prohibited conduct.
C. FINDINGS OF FACT
/. Prominent Themes in the White Plaza Rally
The noon-hour rally at White Plaza, attended at its
peak by about 700 people, had been proposed the night
before at the conclusion of a rally at Dinkelspiel Audi
torium. Most of the speeches given at the White Plaza
rally were available on tape recordings. Only a portion at
the outset was missing, and this was covered in testi
mony. The following themes emerged prominently in
the course of the White Plaza rally:
a. Many speakers discussed ways of protesting the
war in Southeast Asia. Three speakers, including two
student body leaders, favored an off-cainpus focus of
protest. They were severely criticized by five subsequent
speakers, who characterized liberal war protest in such
terms as "counter-insurgency." This may be illustrated
by the following speech:
Yeah, I'd just like to point out that the only time the
liberals and moderates come out of the woodwork is
when there is radical action on campus. . . .That's the
only way moderates and liberals can, can get off their
asses, is when the people around them are doing these
violent things which you consider to be useless.
b. On four occasions, there was reference to selection
of a protest target on campus; the desirability of alterna
tive possibilities was considered.
c. The Computation Center was referred to often
throughout the meeting. Its suitability as a protest target
was cited. In the final speech of the rally, Professor
Franklin called for shutting down the Computation
Center.
d. Some speakers emphasized Stanford's war com
plicity and the desirability of shutting down the Univer
sity in order to end that complicity.
e. Four speakers made reference to the concept of

different people taking protest action on different levels,
each doing his own thing. Three of these clearly included
coercive and violent behavior within the spectrum of
approved activities, and the fourth is unclear on this
poin<. The following quotations help to clarify this
important theme:
And so closing down Stanford is really a concrete
blow against the war. You see, that's a concrete way
of stopping, stopping things that are going on that
help the war by stopping that kind of research, by
stopping the programs that are run in the computer
center....
It's true that if we're writing letters to congressmen
we're probably not doing that much. But by striking
the University and by taking, by taking whatever
kinds of action we can, you see, on a lot of different
levels, some people may want to take over buildings,
some people will want to boycott class, some people
will want to cause classes to be boycotted, you see
it's not much good if English classes and the French
class aren't going on, but the Business School classes
and the Electronic Engineering classes are going on
and the Department of Defense research contracts are
still being carried out.
KZSU: The crowd is still growing here at White Plaza,
now about 700 people.
[new speaker] What really amazes me is like every
body that's here right now is like obviously against
the war. Now all this friction and all this bullshit
that's going on between radicals and conservatives
and liberals or whoever the fuck it is, it's all just
friction. Now, as long as people who are writing
letters or doing strikes, or breaking windows or what,
everybody's doing their own thing to stop that
fucking war over there. So, everybody do their own
thing, and let's stop that war now and altogether,
[applause]
112. The term "strike" was used several times, though
less than it had been the previous night at the Dinkel
spiel rally. Once again, it seemed to bear little relation to
the meaning of "strike" in labor disputes. Rather, it
seemed to refer to a broad spectrum of activities, some
non-coercive and some coercive. The most prominent
connotation was that of the "mobile strike" introduced
February 9th at Dinkelspiel—closing down one universi
ty facility after another by whatever means proved
feasible.
g. Six speakers made favorable reference to coercive
or violent behavior. This may be illustrated by a
recorded passage from Professor Franklin's speech:
. . .so want to talk about, about high consciousness,
the high consciousness is the consciousness of the
people most oppressed by U.S. imperialism, which
includes as a main institution of that Stanford
University. And that's why whenever people from
that community, whenever poor working class youth
from that community, get a chance to come on the
campus at Stanford and do a little material damage,
they are very eager to do so. Because they recognize
what Stanford University is, even if people here
don't.
2. Summary of Professor Franklin's speech
Professor Franklin gave the closing and longest speech
of the rally. (See Appendix II.) He called for a
willingness to sacrifice in the service of protest activity.
He criticized student body leaders for allegedly subvert
ing the activity of protesters. He gave some of his
personal history in antiwar activity. He cited a poll
indicating that people with little education expressed
more opposition to the war in Southeast Asia than those
with higher levels of education.
At the passage quoted earlier, referring to material
damage by working class youth at Stanford, Professor
Franklin's delivery shifted to a higher intensity, remain

ing at this level until the conclusion. He continued later,
Well, when we talk about, see we're just ripping off
the term strike when talking about striking at
Stanford. This isn't a strike. We're not risking
anything. It's a voluntary boycott—a shutdown of
some of the activities of the University as a demon
stration of something. Now, now what we called a
strike last year, and it lasted really about three days
and it kind of dragged on, and you know, in an odds
and ends way and some people did it. But just the
fact that we were able to move our little finger that
much, that electrified the working people of this
area.. ..
He ended the speech by saying,
See, now what we're asking is for people to make that
little tiny gesture to show that we're willing to
inconvenience ourselves a little bit and to begin to
shut down the most obvious machinery of war, such
as, and I think it is a good target, that Computation
Center, [applause and shouts of "right on. .. ."]
Immediately after Professor Franklin's speech, the
chairman asked for a vote to choose between the
Computation Center and Hoover. About 100 hands
(primarily in front) voted affirmatively on the question
of shutting down the former, whereupon the chairman
announced that a majority favored this course. He said,
"And so I would suggest that we go over there and visit
it." At that point, a voice is heard calling, "Shut it
down," echoing the comment made just before by
Professor Franklin and the meeting's chairman.
As the crowd was leaving they were instructed,
When people go over to the Comp Center, they
should all go in a group and move relatively slowly so
that the group can stay together. Also the meeting at
8 o'clock tonight in the Old Union Courtyard is a
very important meeting because we can decide what
we want to do tomorrow. There are some things that
we can't close down now, but we can close them
down if we get to them early in the morning.
3. Interpretation of the Meaning of Professor Frank
lin 's White Plaza Speech
a. Professor Franklin's Own Interpretation
There were several differing points of view regarding
the meaning of the speech given by Professor Franklin.
Professor Franklin himself in an affidavit dated February
24, 1971 described the meaning of his speech:
Actually, in order to understand either the content of
my speech or that of the rally itself, it is necessary to
see it in relation to the events of the previous evening.
The debate was essentially over the same issues, that
is, whether to focus off campus or call for a strike on
campus, and whether a strike could be effective.
Much of the debate was repetitious of the previous
night, but since most of the people at that meeting
felt bound by the vote, those who had wanted to stop
the munition train did not make their proposal. The
main spokesmen for off-campus work were Bob
Grant and Larry Diamond, who proposed doing
precinct work to elect so-called peace candidates. It
was my belief that these two were not being honest,
and that their main purpose was to prevent any
effective action and to advance their own political
careers. It was with this in mind, plus a sense that
many people were becoming very impatient with the
idle debate of the rally, that I rose to speak. My
intention was, as it had been the previous night, to
build the anti-war movement on the campus. ...
He concluded this portion of the affidavit:
Let's move our little finger again and begin to pick up
where we left off with our strike last spring. Let's
begin to shut down the machinery of war. I think
that the suggested target of the computer center is as
good a place to begin as any. So the content of the
entire speech was to strike against the invasion ol
Laos. In making this speech, and the one on the
preceding night, I thought that I was operating
entirely within the precedent established during the
invasion of Cambodia when the overwhelming majori
ty of the faculty and students of the majority of
departments and schools of the University voted to
go on strike. For instance, my own department on
May 4, 1970 voted overwhelmingly in favor of a
strike for an indefinite period, demanding: 1. An
immediate withdrawal ol all American forces from
Southeast Asia; 2. The end of political repression at
home, in particular the government's systematic
attempt to eliminate the Black Panther and other
political dissidents; 3. The removal of KOTC from
the Stanford campus by the end of the academic
quarter; 4. An end to all war-related and secret
research on the Stanford campus by the end of the
quarter.
In the hearing, he described the meaning of his speech
in essentially similar terms.
b. Hearing Witnesses' Interpretation
University Administration witnesses testified that the
crowd was moved by Professor Franklin's speech and
that he served as a catalyst to get the group moving in
the direction of the Computation Center. One of
Professor Franklin's witnesses felt that the Computation
Center was an appropriate target. He said that a
"shutdown" of the University could range from "blast
various parts of it from the face of Santa Clara County"
to taking over a building as had occurred at Lncina Hall
the year before. One of liis witnesses testified that
Professor Franklin was trying to bring factions together
but didn't influence tactics already decided; two felt the
decision to go to the Computation Center had been
arrived at the night before and the purpose of the speech
was to support a Cambodia-type strike; two thought
Professor Franklin's speech was just educational; two
thought that he was not as influential as a middle-aged
salesman who had spoken earlier; one felt that the
purpose of the White Plaza rally was to choose a target
and to recruit more people.
4. Summary of Principal Points oj Defense
Several prominent elements recurred in defense testi
mony and argument on the White Plaza speech:
(a) A widespread inclination to shut down the
Computation Center, and to carry out a variety of
disruptive activities, was formed over the preceding
several days. It was justified in terms of Stanford's
complicity in the war and the Gamut-H program at
the Computation Center. It was consistent with
long-standing antipathy to the war in Asia and to
Stanford's allegedly vital role in the war. It was
exacerbated by the current news of military action in
Laos.
(b) Such an inclination toward disruptive activity in
general, and toward the Computation Center in
particular, was widespread in and around the Univer
sity, especially in the "movement." The persons
inclined to these actions would have carried them out
regardless of any role Professor Franklin might have
had in encouraging, fostering or facilitating them.
(c) Professor Franklin's speech had little effect on
those present. It was political, analytical, and educa
tional, rather than tactical. It presented no danger to
persons or property.
(d) He was simply advocating a voluntary boycott or
legal strike at the Computation Center. Even if his
speech could be construed as advocating disruption of
the Computation Center, he had in mind no seriously
adverse consequences-only a vigorous mode of pro
test of the war and the University's role in it.
5. Analysis of Professor Franklin's White Plaza
Speech, February 10.
a. Background and Foreseeable Consequences of
Computation Center Occupation
The fact that potential for major damage within the
Computation Center existed must have been well known
to Professor Franklin. The mechanisms to achieve such
damage were thoroughly identified during the Dinkel
spiel meeting the previous night. Highly publicized
computer occupations leading to extensive damage had
recently occurred at other universities. Testimony in
dicates that the decision not to damage the computer in
the face of eviction by the police was taken by the
demonstrators after the occupation was in force. Pro
fessor Franklin could reasonably expect that an occupa
tion of the Computation Center would involve great
risks to the computer and to the members of the
University community who rely upon it, including the
staff of the Computation Center. It should be empha
sized that the research and education of many people
throughout the University were in jeopardy.
In some respects a computer plays a role in a modern
university not unlike that of a library: it receives,
catalogues, processes and stores information and it
makes it available in various forms as required. To attack
a computation center because some of its information is
considered evil is little different from attacking an entire
library for harboring a few evil books. Professor Franklin
should have known that the occupation of the Computa
tion Center would lead to an agonizing decision by the
University administration whether to request police to
evict the occupiers, thereby ending a costly seizure at
the expense of an increased risk of damage.
The demonstrators showed no serious inclination to
consider the genuine complexities of computer use.
They made minimal inquiry about uses of the computer
—considering only on-line medical use, and not investiga
ting even that use thoroughly. They showed no concern
for the relation of the computer to other problems
involving human welfare. As a consequence of their
action, 700 to 800 jobs were not run that day; no one
knows how many more would have been impaired if the
occupiers had not been evicted. The social cost of
vigilante action in regard to computers or similar
facilities can become very high.
We heard no evidence that demonstrators made any
serious attempt to communicate with responsible of
ficers of the University in order to inquire about the
state of the Gamut-H program, or the ways in which
research policies are administered in regard to computer
use, prior to the forceful occupation of the Center.
Indeed, one of Professor Franklin's witnesses testified
that the Gamut-H program was known to the "move
ment" for a week or two, but a decision was made to
delay its announcement pending a favorable moment for
protest activity. The military action in Laos provided
such an opportunity. If the news of Gamut-H could be
held a week or two in private, why was instant action
suddenly required on February 10? Professor Franklin
and his witnesses agreed that advocacy towards shut
down of the Computation Center proceeded on the basis
of publications and statements of The Inquisition;
shutdown of the Computation Center was certainly not

a last resort measure. Thus, a poorly checked complaint
was made public after a tactical delay and then rapidly
shifted into coercive action with only the most rudi
mentary attempt at negotiating the grievance. Finally, in
view of the expressed rationale for forceful occupation
of the Computation Center, it is noteworthy that the
Gamut-H program was not even mentioned at any point
in the lengthy tape recording of the White Plaza rally.
b. The Speech Itself
Professor Franklin urged the Board to consider his
speeches in their full context. He particularly called our
attention to protests at Stanford, to the events of the
preceding few days, and to the Dinkelspiel rally of
February 9. These have been summarized earlier.
Throughout these turbulent events, a persistent differ
ence of opinion is manifested between those who place
primary emphasis on the University's role in the war and
those who place primary emphasis on the role of the
government. Professor Franklin clearly belongs in the
former category. In a Dinkelspiel speech of February 9th
and the White Plaza speech of February 10th, he is
severely critical of the University's role in fostering the
design and execution of the war. He strongly urges his
listeners to direct their attention to the University,
expressing hostility toward its trustees, administration,
and some student body leaders. He views the University
as centrally culpable in the war, and directs attention
away from the federal government. This characterization
of the University has the effect of justifying strong
protest or retaliation.
Within this framework, the "movement" chose to
focus attention on the Computation Center as a symbol
and instrument of the war. The February 9th rally is full
of angry references to the Computation Center—the
culpability of its users, its vulnerability, its suitability for
attack and possibly even for destruction. Professor
Franklin must have been aware of this danger to the
Computation Center-to its functions, its hardware, and
to the large number of people who rely upon it in their
work. These matters had been discussed extensively at
the February 9th rally in which he was an active
participant. He also took part in an investigatory march
that followed the February 9th rally, a preparation for
the likelihood of disruptive action the following day. He
admits in testimony and argument that he gave strong
support to the correctness of action against the Compu
tation Center before, during, and after its occupation,
specifically including the White Plaza rally.
In the main, the purpose of the White Plaza rally of
February 10th appears to have been: (1) to increase the
numbers available for protest activity; (2) to settle
firmly on a target. In respect to (2) the Computation
Center appeared to be the most likely target as a result
of the February 9th meeting, but the Hoover Institution
was still under consideration; two student leaders advo
cated nondisruptive political activity, but they were
strongly criticized by Professor Franklin and others.
Professor Franklin was a highly respected leader of a
group advocating intense hostility to the University as
well as disdain for nondisruptive modes of protest and
for electoral politics. His White Plaza speech contains an
approving reference to material damage to Stanlord
University, and his testimony on these events provides
repeated justification for such damage. At White Plaza
on February 10th, this orientation was brought sharply
to bear on the Computation Center.
It is uncontested that at the White Plaza rally
Professor Franklin concluded his speech by stating
". . .what we are asking is.. .to begin to shut down the
most obvious machinery of war, such as, and I think it is
a good target, that Computation Center.. ." and that
subsequently the Stanford Computation Center, al
though officially declared closed, was forcefully oc
cupied, resulting in shutdown of operation and minor

damage. It is also uncontested that many of the
occupiers were in the audience of Professor Franklin's
speech.
Professor Franklin has also asserted that a firm
decision to shut down the Computation Center was
already reached on February 9, and that therefore his
speech on February 10 could not have contributed to
the subsequent course of events. The evidence does not
support the assertion. The meeting on February 9th held
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium identified a spectrum of
options for action, and two-action against the Hoover
Institution and against the Computation Center-were
left as leading candidates. The preceding summary of
Dinkelspiel (February 9) and White Pla/.a (February 10)
rallies makes this clear. Moreover, several witnesses (both
for the administration and for Professor Franklin)
testified that specific action against the University was
not settled, or that they were undecided whether to
participate in the Computation Center action until they
attended this rally at which Professor Franklin gave the
final speech.
C. Professor Franklin's Use of the Term "Strike "
The Board has found it helpful to pay special
attention to the context for subsequent events provided
by the Dinkelspiel rally of the night of February 9th.
Both the University Administration and Professor Frank
lin devoted considerable attention to this background. In
that connection, we think it important to note that
Professor Franklin himself placed special emphasis dur
ing the hearing on the importance of that rally for
providing context. For that reason, we find the introduc
tion to his own analysis of that topic in this supplemen
tary written brief (page 106) rather unreasonable. He
says"The administration attempts to prove that the real
meaning of Franklin's speech can be found lurking in
several statements gleaned from the lengthy meeting at
Dinkelspiel." If the Administration did so, it was at
Professor Franklin's own invitation.
Our view of the matter is that Professor Franklin was
right the first time: the Dinkelspiel rally does provide
important insights into the speech that follows. It is
analyzed extensively above, in the section on "Back
ground to Events of February 10, 1972." We here
comment on the view presented by Prolessor Franklin in
his supplementary written brief. The main thrust of his
argument is that the rally was a very general discussion,
organized primarily along the lines of planning a strike;
he says (p. 109) "The reason there were no plans for a
picket sign is that there were no plans for anything
beyond a meeting and a general sort of strike." He also
asserts (p. 107) "There was never a real discussion of the
variety of ways the Computer Center could be shut
down except along the general lines of a strike."
In fact, his account tends to select heavily those
speeches from the Dinkelspiel rally that emphasize the
non-coercive aspects of the kind of "strike" he is talking
about. For example, he ignores the following speech
early in the rally:
And so the only reason that we would attack the
University would be on the grounds of effectiveness,
though I would try to direct the demands toward
specific things in the community and that are
attackable like the Computation Center.. . .
In addition, there are two other early calJs to stop
talking and commence action. Later, Braunstein recom
mends a range of actions, including some that lie well
outside the range of legal actions that is subsumed under
the term "strike" when used in its normal context.
Indeed, the term "strike" clearly has a different
meaning to members of the "movement" at Stanford
than it does in ordinary usage. When preceded by the
modifying words "Cambodia-type," it encompasses a

wide range of actions, including some that are legal and
some that are illegal. The introduction of the concept of
a "mobile strike," which takes place well before the end
of the Dinkelspiel rally, was clearly a modification
introduced by numerical considerations: it was argued
that the number of people was inadequate to close a
number of things simultaneously, but that they might
succeed if targets were attacked seriatim. It is clear that
in all of these uses, the term "strike" encompasses a
wide range of activities. In his supplementary written
brief, Professor Franklin borrows the conventional
meaning from the labor context, and then employs it as
a flag in which to wrap a much broader range of
conduct. All of the speakers who spoke late in the rally,
after they had developed some consensus around the
notion of "mobile strike" and were discussing a target,
used language that clearly involves the expectation of
being confronted by the police, moved out of buildings,
and the like. Persuading workers to leave their jobs,
standing in the doorways to bear "moral witness,"
picketing — these activities get little or no prominence in
the discussion, although Professor Franklin tries to
persuade us that these activities are really the dominant
elements of a "strike." The context so established is not
substantially changed, in our view, by the earlier
speakers at the White Plaza rally.
The words "shut it down" imply a cessation of
function that can sometimes be achieved by a strike,
strictly defined, but may be achieved by other means as
well. From a careful reading of the Dinkelspiel trans
cript, we are persuaded that the context for the White
Plaza rally was one in which the prospective shutting
down of the Computation Center was to be achieved
primarily by means going beyond the range of legal
"strike" tactics. We find Professor Franklin's use of the
term "strike" disingenuous, and we believe that his own
exhortation to "shut down" the Computation Center
was, given that context, an intentional invitation to
employ such extra-legal means as might be necessary.
In summary, could Professor Franklin reasonably
have expected that his speech would have contributed to
the likelihood of the occupation? Professor Franklin
asserts that he was only advocating a legal strike or
voluntary boycott of the Computation Center, or
alternatively that he gave no thoughts at all to the
consequences of his speech. The preceding analysis of
the Dinkelspiel rally makes this a highly dubious
proposition. Although there clearly were discussions of a
"strike" against Stanford University during the rally at
Dinkelspiel and during the early portions of the White
Plaza rally, there is no evidence of preparation for a legal
strike or boycott: no plans for picketing; no direct effort
at persuasion of the workers of the Computation Center
to withhold their labor or for the users of the Center to
boycott the facility. In the present context, the term
"strike" was a kind of euphemism for a broad range of
protest activities, including peaceful, coercive and vio
lent activities. We conclude that Professor Franklin must
reasonably have expected that his advocacy of "shut
down" would be interpreted by at least a substantial
portion of the audience as calling for forceful disruption
of the operation of the Center. Indeed, we believe that
this is what he meant.
CONCLUSION
We conclude that Professor Franklin must reasonably
have expected that his speech at White Plaza on
February 10, 1971, would increase the likelihood of
illegal occupation of the Computation Center immedi
ately following his speech, and that there was risk of
serious damage to the computer and its users. The Board
finds the evidence strongly persuasive that Professor
Franklin urged and incited his audience at White Plaza
towards disruption of University functions and shut
down of the Computation Center. We therefore sustain
charge No. 8.
A. CHARGES
The relevant University charges concerning the White
Plaza incident are contained in Paragraph 8 of the
"Statement of Charges" dated March 22, 1971. This
paragraph reads as follows:
8. On February 10, 1971, beginning at about 12
p.m., a rally was held at White Memorial Plaza to,
among other things, discuss methods of protesting
developments in the war in Indochina. Over tive
humdred students and other persons attended. During
the course of the rally two prinicpal courses of action
were discussed, one being to work in the non-Univer
sity community to bring about changes in govern
ment policy, the other being to disrupt University
functions and business. Professor Franklin intention
ally urged and incited students and other persons
present at the rally to follow the latter course of
action and specifically to shut down a University
computer facility known as the Computation Center.
Shortly thereafter a large number of students and
others left the rally and went to the Computation
Center whereupon many of these persons did in fact
occupy the Computation Center, prevent its opera
tion and obstruct movement in and out of the
building for several hours, terminating this unlawful
activity only when ordered to leave the building by
the police.
B. NATURE OF THE CHARGE
The general charge is that Professor Franklin urged
and incited the disruption of University functions; the
specific charge is that he urged and incited his audience
to shut down a University facility, the Computation
Center. Effectively, this means that his words, including
their delivery and their context, significantly increased
the likelihood of prohibited conduct on the part of his
audience; it means, moreover, that he must have anti
cipated that his speech, given its delivery and context,
would significantly increase the imminent likelihood of
prohibited conduct.
C. FINDINGS OF FACT
/. Prominent Themes in the White Plaza Rally
The noon-hour rally at White Plaza, attended at its
peak by about 700 people, had been proposed the night
before at the conclusion of a rally at Dinkelspiel Audi
torium. Most of the speeches given at the White Plaza
rally were available on tape recordings. Only a portion at
the outset was missing, and this was covered in testi
mony. The following themes emerged prominently in
the course of the White Plaza rally:
a. Many speakers discussed ways of protesting the
war in Southeast Asia. Three speakers, including two
student body leaders, favored an off-cainpus focus of
protest. They were severely criticized by five subsequent
speakers, who characterized liberal war protest in such
terms as "counter-insurgency." This may be illustrated
by the following speech:
Yeah, I'd just like to point out that the only time the
liberals and moderates come out of the woodwork is
when there is radical action on campus. . . .That's the
only way moderates and liberals can, can get off their
asses, is when the people around them are doing these
violent things which you consider to be useless.
b. On four occasions, there was reference to selection
of a protest target on campus; the desirability of alterna
tive possibilities was considered.
c. The Computation Center was referred to often
throughout the meeting. Its suitability as a protest target
was cited. In the final speech of the rally, Professor
Franklin called for shutting down the Computation
Center.
d. Some speakers emphasized Stanford's war com
plicity and the desirability of shutting down the Univer
sity in order to end that complicity.
e. Four speakers made reference to the concept of

different people taking protest action on different levels,
each doing his own thing. Three of these clearly included
coercive and violent behavior within the spectrum of
approved activities, and the fourth is unclear on this
poin<. The following quotations help to clarify this
important theme:
And so closing down Stanford is really a concrete
blow against the war. You see, that's a concrete way
of stopping, stopping things that are going on that
help the war by stopping that kind of research, by
stopping the programs that are run in the computer
center....
It's true that if we're writing letters to congressmen
we're probably not doing that much. But by striking
the University and by taking, by taking whatever
kinds of action we can, you see, on a lot of different
levels, some people may want to take over buildings,
some people will want to boycott class, some people
will want to cause classes to be boycotted, you see
it's not much good if English classes and the French
class aren't going on, but the Business School classes
and the Electronic Engineering classes are going on
and the Department of Defense research contracts are
still being carried out.
KZSU: The crowd is still growing here at White Plaza,
now about 700 people.
[new speaker] What really amazes me is like every
body that's here right now is like obviously against
the war. Now all this friction and all this bullshit
that's going on between radicals and conservatives
and liberals or whoever the fuck it is, it's all just
friction. Now, as long as people who are writing
letters or doing strikes, or breaking windows or what,
everybody's doing their own thing to stop that
fucking war over there. So, everybody do their own
thing, and let's stop that war now and altogether,
[applause]
112. The term "strike" was used several times, though
less than it had been the previous night at the Dinkel
spiel rally. Once again, it seemed to bear little relation to
the meaning of "strike" in labor disputes. Rather, it
seemed to refer to a broad spectrum of activities, some
non-coercive and some coercive. The most prominent
connotation was that of the "mobile strike" introduced
February 9th at Dinkelspiel—closing down one universi
ty facility after another by whatever means proved
feasible.
g. Six speakers made favorable reference to coercive
or violent behavior. This may be illustrated by a
recorded passage from Professor Franklin's speech:
. . .so want to talk about, about high consciousness,
the high consciousness is the consciousness of the
people most oppressed by U.S. imperialism, which
includes as a main institution of that Stanford
University. And that's why whenever people from
that community, whenever poor working class youth
from that community, get a chance to come on the
campus at Stanford and do a little material damage,
they are very eager to do so. Because they recognize
what Stanford University is, even if people here
don't.
2. Summary of Professor Franklin's speech
Professor Franklin gave the closing and longest speech
of the rally. (See Appendix II.) He called for a
willingness to sacrifice in the service of protest activity.
He criticized student body leaders for allegedly subvert
ing the activity of protesters. He gave some of his
personal history in antiwar activity. He cited a poll
indicating that people with little education expressed
more opposition to the war in Southeast Asia than those
with higher levels of education.
At the passage quoted earlier, referring to material
damage by working class youth at Stanford, Professor
Franklin's delivery shifted to a higher intensity, remain

ing at this level until the conclusion. He continued later,
Well, when we talk about, see we're just ripping off
the term strike when talking about striking at
Stanford. This isn't a strike. We're not risking
anything. It's a voluntary boycott—a shutdown of
some of the activities of the University as a demon
stration of something. Now, now what we called a
strike last year, and it lasted really about three days
and it kind of dragged on, and you know, in an odds
and ends way and some people did it. But just the
fact that we were able to move our little finger that
much, that electrified the working people of this
area.. ..
He ended the speech by saying,
See, now what we're asking is for people to make that
little tiny gesture to show that we're willing to
inconvenience ourselves a little bit and to begin to
shut down the most obvious machinery of war, such
as, and I think it is a good target, that Computation
Center, [applause and shouts of "right on. .. ."]
Immediately after Professor Franklin's speech, the
chairman asked for a vote to choose between the
Computation Center and Hoover. About 100 hands
(primarily in front) voted affirmatively on the question
of shutting down the former, whereupon the chairman
announced that a majority favored this course. He said,
"And so I would suggest that we go over there and visit
it." At that point, a voice is heard calling, "Shut it
down," echoing the comment made just before by
Professor Franklin and the meeting's chairman.
As the crowd was leaving they were instructed,
When people go over to the Comp Center, they
should all go in a group and move relatively slowly so
that the group can stay together. Also the meeting at
8 o'clock tonight in the Old Union Courtyard is a
very important meeting because we can decide what
we want to do tomorrow. There are some things that
we can't close down now, but we can close them
down if we get to them early in the morning.
3. Interpretation of the Meaning of Professor Frank
lin 's White Plaza Speech
a. Professor Franklin's Own Interpretation
There were several differing points of view regarding
the meaning of the speech given by Professor Franklin.
Professor Franklin himself in an affidavit dated February
24, 1971 described the meaning of his speech:
Actually, in order to understand either the content of
my speech or that of the rally itself, it is necessary to
see it in relation to the events of the previous evening.
The debate was essentially over the same issues, that
is, whether to focus off campus or call for a strike on
campus, and whether a strike could be effective.
Much of the debate was repetitious of the previous
night, but since most of the people at that meeting
felt bound by the vote, those who had wanted to stop
the munition train did not make their proposal. The
main spokesmen for off-campus work were Bob
Grant and Larry Diamond, who proposed doing
precinct work to elect so-called peace candidates. It
was my belief that these two were not being honest,
and that their main purpose was to prevent any
effective action and to advance their own political
careers. It was with this in mind, plus a sense that
many people were becoming very impatient with the
idle debate of the rally, that I rose to speak. My
intention was, as it had been the previous night, to
build the anti-war movement on the campus. ...
He concluded this portion of the affidavit:
Let's move our little finger again and begin to pick up
where we left off with our strike last spring. Let's
begin to shut down the machinery of war. I think
that the suggested target of the computer center is as
good a place to begin as any. So the content of the
entire speech was to strike against the invasion ol
Laos. In making this speech, and the one on the
preceding night, I thought that I was operating
entirely within the precedent established during the
invasion of Cambodia when the overwhelming majori
ty of the faculty and students of the majority of
departments and schools of the University voted to
go on strike. For instance, my own department on
May 4, 1970 voted overwhelmingly in favor of a
strike for an indefinite period, demanding: 1. An
immediate withdrawal ol all American forces from
Southeast Asia; 2. The end of political repression at
home, in particular the government's systematic
attempt to eliminate the Black Panther and other
political dissidents; 3. The removal of KOTC from
the Stanford campus by the end of the academic
quarter; 4. An end to all war-related and secret
research on the Stanford campus by the end of the
quarter.
In the hearing, he described the meaning of his speech
in essentially similar terms.
b. Hearing Witnesses' Interpretation
University Administration witnesses testified that the
crowd was moved by Professor Franklin's speech and
that he served as a catalyst to get the group moving in
the direction of the Computation Center. One of
Professor Franklin's witnesses felt that the Computation
Center was an appropriate target. He said that a
"shutdown" of the University could range from "blast
various parts of it from the face of Santa Clara County"
to taking over a building as had occurred at Lncina Hall
the year before. One of liis witnesses testified that
Professor Franklin was trying to bring factions together
but didn't influence tactics already decided; two felt the
decision to go to the Computation Center had been
arrived at the night before and the purpose of the speech
was to support a Cambodia-type strike; two thought
Professor Franklin's speech was just educational; two
thought that he was not as influential as a middle-aged
salesman who had spoken earlier; one felt that the
purpose of the White Plaza rally was to choose a target
and to recruit more people.
4. Summary of Principal Points oj Defense
Several prominent elements recurred in defense testi
mony and argument on the White Plaza speech:
(a) A widespread inclination to shut down the
Computation Center, and to carry out a variety of
disruptive activities, was formed over the preceding
several days. It was justified in terms of Stanford's
complicity in the war and the Gamut-H program at
the Computation Center. It was consistent with
long-standing antipathy to the war in Asia and to
Stanford's allegedly vital role in the war. It was
exacerbated by the current news of military action in
Laos.
(b) Such an inclination toward disruptive activity in
general, and toward the Computation Center in
particular, was widespread in and around the Univer
sity, especially in the "movement." The persons
inclined to these actions would have carried them out
regardless of any role Professor Franklin might have
had in encouraging, fostering or facilitating them.
(c) Professor Franklin's speech had little effect on
those present. It was political, analytical, and educa
tional, rather than tactical. It presented no danger to
persons or property.
(d) He was simply advocating a voluntary boycott or
legal strike at the Computation Center. Even if his
speech could be construed as advocating disruption of
the Computation Center, he had in mind no seriously
adverse consequences-only a vigorous mode of pro
test of the war and the University's role in it.
5. Analysis of Professor Franklin's White Plaza
Speech, February 10.
a. Background and Foreseeable Consequences of
Computation Center Occupation
The fact that potential for major damage within the
Computation Center existed must have been well known
to Professor Franklin. The mechanisms to achieve such
damage were thoroughly identified during the Dinkel
spiel meeting the previous night. Highly publicized
computer occupations leading to extensive damage had
recently occurred at other universities. Testimony in
dicates that the decision not to damage the computer in
the face of eviction by the police was taken by the
demonstrators after the occupation was in force. Pro
fessor Franklin could reasonably expect that an occupa
tion of the Computation Center would involve great
risks to the computer and to the members of the
University community who rely upon it, including the
staff of the Computation Center. It should be empha
sized that the research and education of many people
throughout the University were in jeopardy.
In some respects a computer plays a role in a modern
university not unlike that of a library: it receives,
catalogues, processes and stores information and it
makes it available in various forms as required. To attack
a computation center because some of its information is
considered evil is little different from attacking an entire
library for harboring a few evil books. Professor Franklin
should have known that the occupation of the Computa
tion Center would lead to an agonizing decision by the
University administration whether to request police to
evict the occupiers, thereby ending a costly seizure at
the expense of an increased risk of damage.
The demonstrators showed no serious inclination to
consider the genuine complexities of computer use.
They made minimal inquiry about uses of the computer
—considering only on-line medical use, and not investiga
ting even that use thoroughly. They showed no concern
for the relation of the computer to other problems
involving human welfare. As a consequence of their
action, 700 to 800 jobs were not run that day; no one
knows how many more would have been impaired if the
occupiers had not been evicted. The social cost of
vigilante action in regard to computers or similar
facilities can become very high.
We heard no evidence that demonstrators made any
serious attempt to communicate with responsible of
ficers of the University in order to inquire about the
state of the Gamut-H program, or the ways in which
research policies are administered in regard to computer
use, prior to the forceful occupation of the Center.
Indeed, one of Professor Franklin's witnesses testified
that the Gamut-H program was known to the "move
ment" for a week or two, but a decision was made to
delay its announcement pending a favorable moment for
protest activity. The military action in Laos provided
such an opportunity. If the news of Gamut-H could be
held a week or two in private, why was instant action
suddenly required on February 10? Professor Franklin
and his witnesses agreed that advocacy towards shut
down of the Computation Center proceeded on the basis
of publications and statements of The Inquisition;
shutdown of the Computation Center was certainly not

a last resort measure. Thus, a poorly checked complaint
was made public after a tactical delay and then rapidly
shifted into coercive action with only the most rudi
mentary attempt at negotiating the grievance. Finally, in
view of the expressed rationale for forceful occupation
of the Computation Center, it is noteworthy that the
Gamut-H program was not even mentioned at any point
in the lengthy tape recording of the White Plaza rally.
b. The Speech Itself
Professor Franklin urged the Board to consider his
speeches in their full context. He particularly called our
attention to protests at Stanford, to the events of the
preceding few days, and to the Dinkelspiel rally of
February 9. These have been summarized earlier.
Throughout these turbulent events, a persistent differ
ence of opinion is manifested between those who place
primary emphasis on the University's role in the war and
those who place primary emphasis on the role of the
government. Professor Franklin clearly belongs in the
former category. In a Dinkelspiel speech of February 9th
and the White Plaza speech of February 10th, he is
severely critical of the University's role in fostering the
design and execution of the war. He strongly urges his
listeners to direct their attention to the University,
expressing hostility toward its trustees, administration,
and some student body leaders. He views the University
as centrally culpable in the war, and directs attention
away from the federal government. This characterization
of the University has the effect of justifying strong
protest or retaliation.
Within this framework, the "movement" chose to
focus attention on the Computation Center as a symbol
and instrument of the war. The February 9th rally is full
of angry references to the Computation Center—the
culpability of its users, its vulnerability, its suitability for
attack and possibly even for destruction. Professor
Franklin must have been aware of this danger to the
Computation Center-to its functions, its hardware, and
to the large number of people who rely upon it in their
work. These matters had been discussed extensively at
the February 9th rally in which he was an active
participant. He also took part in an investigatory march
that followed the February 9th rally, a preparation for
the likelihood of disruptive action the following day. He
admits in testimony and argument that he gave strong
support to the correctness of action against the Compu
tation Center before, during, and after its occupation,
specifically including the White Plaza rally.
In the main, the purpose of the White Plaza rally of
February 10th appears to have been: (1) to increase the
numbers available for protest activity; (2) to settle
firmly on a target. In respect to (2) the Computation
Center appeared to be the most likely target as a result
of the February 9th meeting, but the Hoover Institution
was still under consideration; two student leaders advo
cated nondisruptive political activity, but they were
strongly criticized by Professor Franklin and others.
Professor Franklin was a highly respected leader of a
group advocating intense hostility to the University as
well as disdain for nondisruptive modes of protest and
for electoral politics. His White Plaza speech contains an
approving reference to material damage to Stanlord
University, and his testimony on these events provides
repeated justification for such damage. At White Plaza
on February 10th, this orientation was brought sharply
to bear on the Computation Center.
It is uncontested that at the White Plaza rally
Professor Franklin concluded his speech by stating
". . .what we are asking is.. .to begin to shut down the
most obvious machinery of war, such as, and I think it is
a good target, that Computation Center.. ." and that
subsequently the Stanford Computation Center, al
though officially declared closed, was forcefully oc
cupied, resulting in shutdown of operation and minor

damage. It is also uncontested that many of the
occupiers were in the audience of Professor Franklin's
speech.
Professor Franklin has also asserted that a firm
decision to shut down the Computation Center was
already reached on February 9, and that therefore his
speech on February 10 could not have contributed to
the subsequent course of events. The evidence does not
support the assertion. The meeting on February 9th held
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium identified a spectrum of
options for action, and two-action against the Hoover
Institution and against the Computation Center-were
left as leading candidates. The preceding summary of
Dinkelspiel (February 9) and White Pla/.a (February 10)
rallies makes this clear. Moreover, several witnesses (both
for the administration and for Professor Franklin)
testified that specific action against the University was
not settled, or that they were undecided whether to
participate in the Computation Center action until they
attended this rally at which Professor Franklin gave the
final speech.
C. Professor Franklin's Use of the Term "Strike "
The Board has found it helpful to pay special
attention to the context for subsequent events provided
by the Dinkelspiel rally of the night of February 9th.
Both the University Administration and Professor Frank
lin devoted considerable attention to this background. In
that connection, we think it important to note that
Professor Franklin himself placed special emphasis dur
ing the hearing on the importance of that rally for
providing context. For that reason, we find the introduc
tion to his own analysis of that topic in this supplemen
tary written brief (page 106) rather unreasonable. He
says"The administration attempts to prove that the real
meaning of Franklin's speech can be found lurking in
several statements gleaned from the lengthy meeting at
Dinkelspiel." If the Administration did so, it was at
Professor Franklin's own invitation.
Our view of the matter is that Professor Franklin was
right the first time: the Dinkelspiel rally does provide
important insights into the speech that follows. It is
analyzed extensively above, in the section on "Back
ground to Events of February 10, 1972." We here
comment on the view presented by Prolessor Franklin in
his supplementary written brief. The main thrust of his
argument is that the rally was a very general discussion,
organized primarily along the lines of planning a strike;
he says (p. 109) "The reason there were no plans for a
picket sign is that there were no plans for anything
beyond a meeting and a general sort of strike." He also
asserts (p. 107) "There was never a real discussion of the
variety of ways the Computer Center could be shut
down except along the general lines of a strike."
In fact, his account tends to select heavily those
speeches from the Dinkelspiel rally that emphasize the
non-coercive aspects of the kind of "strike" he is talking
about. For example, he ignores the following speech
early in the rally:
And so the only reason that we would attack the
University would be on the grounds of effectiveness,
though I would try to direct the demands toward
specific things in the community and that are
attackable like the Computation Center.. . .
In addition, there are two other early calJs to stop
talking and commence action. Later, Braunstein recom
mends a range of actions, including some that lie well
outside the range of legal actions that is subsumed under
the term "strike" when used in its normal context.
Indeed, the term "strike" clearly has a different
meaning to members of the "movement" at Stanford
than it does in ordinary usage. When preceded by the
modifying words "Cambodia-type," it encompasses a

wide range of actions, including some that are legal and
some that are illegal. The introduction of the concept of
a "mobile strike," which takes place well before the end
of the Dinkelspiel rally, was clearly a modification
introduced by numerical considerations: it was argued
that the number of people was inadequate to close a
number of things simultaneously, but that they might
succeed if targets were attacked seriatim. It is clear that
in all of these uses, the term "strike" encompasses a
wide range of activities. In his supplementary written
brief, Professor Franklin borrows the conventional
meaning from the labor context, and then employs it as
a flag in which to wrap a much broader range of
conduct. All of the speakers who spoke late in the rally,
after they had developed some consensus around the
notion of "mobile strike" and were discussing a target,
used language that clearly involves the expectation of
being confronted by the police, moved out of buildings,
and the like. Persuading workers to leave their jobs,
standing in the doorways to bear "moral witness,"
picketing — these activities get little or no prominence in
the discussion, although Professor Franklin tries to
persuade us that these activities are really the dominant
elements of a "strike." The context so established is not
substantially changed, in our view, by the earlier
speakers at the White Plaza rally.
The words "shut it down" imply a cessation of
function that can sometimes be achieved by a strike,
strictly defined, but may be achieved by other means as
well. From a careful reading of the Dinkelspiel trans
cript, we are persuaded that the context for the White
Plaza rally was one in which the prospective shutting
down of the Computation Center was to be achieved
primarily by means going beyond the range of legal
"strike" tactics. We find Professor Franklin's use of the
term "strike" disingenuous, and we believe that his own
exhortation to "shut down" the Computation Center
was, given that context, an intentional invitation to
employ such extra-legal means as might be necessary.
In summary, could Professor Franklin reasonably
have expected that his speech would have contributed to
the likelihood of the occupation? Professor Franklin
asserts that he was only advocating a legal strike or
voluntary boycott of the Computation Center, or
alternatively that he gave no thoughts at all to the
consequences of his speech. The preceding analysis of
the Dinkelspiel rally makes this a highly dubious
proposition. Although there clearly were discussions of a
"strike" against Stanford University during the rally at
Dinkelspiel and during the early portions of the White
Plaza rally, there is no evidence of preparation for a legal
strike or boycott: no plans for picketing; no direct effort
at persuasion of the workers of the Computation Center
to withhold their labor or for the users of the Center to
boycott the facility. In the present context, the term
"strike" was a kind of euphemism for a broad range of
protest activities, including peaceful, coercive and vio
lent activities. We conclude that Professor Franklin must
reasonably have expected that his advocacy of "shut
down" would be interpreted by at least a substantial
portion of the audience as calling for forceful disruption
of the operation of the Center. Indeed, we believe that
this is what he meant.
CONCLUSION
We conclude that Professor Franklin must reasonably
have expected that his speech at White Plaza on
February 10, 1971, would increase the likelihood of
illegal occupation of the Computation Center immedi
ately following his speech, and that there was risk of
serious damage to the computer and its users. The Board
finds the evidence strongly persuasive that Professor
Franklin urged and incited his audience at White Plaza
towards disruption of University functions and shut
down of the Computation Center. We therefore sustain
charge No. 8.
A. CHARGES
The relevant University charges concerning the White
Plaza incident are contained in Paragraph 8 of the
"Statement of Charges" dated March 22, 1971. This
paragraph reads as follows:
8. On February 10, 1971, beginning at about 12
p.m., a rally was held at White Memorial Plaza to,
among other things, discuss methods of protesting
developments in the war in Indochina. Over tive
humdred students and other persons attended. During
the course of the rally two prinicpal courses of action
were discussed, one being to work in the non-Univer
sity community to bring about changes in govern
ment policy, the other being to disrupt University
functions and business. Professor Franklin intention
ally urged and incited students and other persons
present at the rally to follow the latter course of
action and specifically to shut down a University
computer facility known as the Computation Center.
Shortly thereafter a large number of students and
others left the rally and went to the Computation
Center whereupon many of these persons did in fact
occupy the Computation Center, prevent its opera
tion and obstruct movement in and out of the
building for several hours, terminating this unlawful
activity only when ordered to leave the building by
the police.
B. NATURE OF THE CHARGE
The general charge is that Professor Franklin urged
and incited the disruption of University functions; the
specific charge is that he urged and incited his audience
to shut down a University facility, the Computation
Center. Effectively, this means that his words, including
their delivery and their context, significantly increased
the likelihood of prohibited conduct on the part of his
audience; it means, moreover, that he must have anti
cipated that his speech, given its delivery and context,
would significantly increase the imminent likelihood of
prohibited conduct.
C. FINDINGS OF FACT
/. Prominent Themes in the White Plaza Rally
The noon-hour rally at White Plaza, attended at its
peak by about 700 people, had been proposed the night
before at the conclusion of a rally at Dinkelspiel Audi
torium. Most of the speeches given at the White Plaza
rally were available on tape recordings. Only a portion at
the outset was missing, and this was covered in testi
mony. The following themes emerged prominently in
the course of the White Plaza rally:
a. Many speakers discussed ways of protesting the
war in Southeast Asia. Three speakers, including two
student body leaders, favored an off-cainpus focus of
protest. They were severely criticized by five subsequent
speakers, who characterized liberal war protest in such
terms as "counter-insurgency." This may be illustrated
by the following speech:
Yeah, I'd just like to point out that the only time the
liberals and moderates come out of the woodwork is
when there is radical action on campus. . . .That's the
only way moderates and liberals can, can get off their
asses, is when the people around them are doing these
violent things which you consider to be useless.
b. On four occasions, there was reference to selection
of a protest target on campus; the desirability of alterna
tive possibilities was considered.
c. The Computation Center was referred to often
throughout the meeting. Its suitability as a protest target
was cited. In the final speech of the rally, Professor
Franklin called for shutting down the Computation
Center.
d. Some speakers emphasized Stanford's war com
plicity and the desirability of shutting down the Univer
sity in order to end that complicity.
e. Four speakers made reference to the concept of

different people taking protest action on different levels,
each doing his own thing. Three of these clearly included
coercive and violent behavior within the spectrum of
approved activities, and the fourth is unclear on this
poin<. The following quotations help to clarify this
important theme:
And so closing down Stanford is really a concrete
blow against the war. You see, that's a concrete way
of stopping, stopping things that are going on that
help the war by stopping that kind of research, by
stopping the programs that are run in the computer
center....
It's true that if we're writing letters to congressmen
we're probably not doing that much. But by striking
the University and by taking, by taking whatever
kinds of action we can, you see, on a lot of different
levels, some people may want to take over buildings,
some people will want to boycott class, some people
will want to cause classes to be boycotted, you see
it's not much good if English classes and the French
class aren't going on, but the Business School classes
and the Electronic Engineering classes are going on
and the Department of Defense research contracts are
still being carried out.
KZSU: The crowd is still growing here at White Plaza,
now about 700 people.
[new speaker] What really amazes me is like every
body that's here right now is like obviously against
the war. Now all this friction and all this bullshit
that's going on between radicals and conservatives
and liberals or whoever the fuck it is, it's all just
friction. Now, as long as people who are writing
letters or doing strikes, or breaking windows or what,
everybody's doing their own thing to stop that
fucking war over there. So, everybody do their own
thing, and let's stop that war now and altogether,
[applause]
112. The term "strike" was used several times, though
less than it had been the previous night at the Dinkel
spiel rally. Once again, it seemed to bear little relation to
the meaning of "strike" in labor disputes. Rather, it
seemed to refer to a broad spectrum of activities, some
non-coercive and some coercive. The most prominent
connotation was that of the "mobile strike" introduced
February 9th at Dinkelspiel—closing down one universi
ty facility after another by whatever means proved
feasible.
g. Six speakers made favorable reference to coercive
or violent behavior. This may be illustrated by a
recorded passage from Professor Franklin's speech:
. . .so want to talk about, about high consciousness,
the high consciousness is the consciousness of the
people most oppressed by U.S. imperialism, which
includes as a main institution of that Stanford
University. And that's why whenever people from
that community, whenever poor working class youth
from that community, get a chance to come on the
campus at Stanford and do a little material damage,
they are very eager to do so. Because they recognize
what Stanford University is, even if people here
don't.
2. Summary of Professor Franklin's speech
Professor Franklin gave the closing and longest speech
of the rally. (See Appendix II.) He called for a
willingness to sacrifice in the service of protest activity.
He criticized student body leaders for allegedly subvert
ing the activity of protesters. He gave some of his
personal history in antiwar activity. He cited a poll
indicating that people with little education expressed
more opposition to the war in Southeast Asia than those
with higher levels of education.
At the passage quoted earlier, referring to material
damage by working class youth at Stanford, Professor
Franklin's delivery shifted to a higher intensity, remain

ing at this level until the conclusion. He continued later,
Well, when we talk about, see we're just ripping off
the term strike when talking about striking at
Stanford. This isn't a strike. We're not risking
anything. It's a voluntary boycott—a shutdown of
some of the activities of the University as a demon
stration of something. Now, now what we called a
strike last year, and it lasted really about three days
and it kind of dragged on, and you know, in an odds
and ends way and some people did it. But just the
fact that we were able to move our little finger that
much, that electrified the working people of this
area.. ..
He ended the speech by saying,
See, now what we're asking is for people to make that
little tiny gesture to show that we're willing to
inconvenience ourselves a little bit and to begin to
shut down the most obvious machinery of war, such
as, and I think it is a good target, that Computation
Center, [applause and shouts of "right on. .. ."]
Immediately after Professor Franklin's speech, the
chairman asked for a vote to choose between the
Computation Center and Hoover. About 100 hands
(primarily in front) voted affirmatively on the question
of shutting down the former, whereupon the chairman
announced that a majority favored this course. He said,
"And so I would suggest that we go over there and visit
it." At that point, a voice is heard calling, "Shut it
down," echoing the comment made just before by
Professor Franklin and the meeting's chairman.
As the crowd was leaving they were instructed,
When people go over to the Comp Center, they
should all go in a group and move relatively slowly so
that the group can stay together. Also the meeting at
8 o'clock tonight in the Old Union Courtyard is a
very important meeting because we can decide what
we want to do tomorrow. There are some things that
we can't close down now, but we can close them
down if we get to them early in the morning.
3. Interpretation of the Meaning of Professor Frank
lin 's White Plaza Speech
a. Professor Franklin's Own Interpretation
There were several differing points of view regarding
the meaning of the speech given by Professor Franklin.
Professor Franklin himself in an affidavit dated February
24, 1971 described the meaning of his speech:
Actually, in order to understand either the content of
my speech or that of the rally itself, it is necessary to
see it in relation to the events of the previous evening.
The debate was essentially over the same issues, that
is, whether to focus off campus or call for a strike on
campus, and whether a strike could be effective.
Much of the debate was repetitious of the previous
night, but since most of the people at that meeting
felt bound by the vote, those who had wanted to stop
the munition train did not make their proposal. The
main spokesmen for off-campus work were Bob
Grant and Larry Diamond, who proposed doing
precinct work to elect so-called peace candidates. It
was my belief that these two were not being honest,
and that their main purpose was to prevent any
effective action and to advance their own political
careers. It was with this in mind, plus a sense that
many people were becoming very impatient with the
idle debate of the rally, that I rose to speak. My
intention was, as it had been the previous night, to
build the anti-war movement on the campus. ...
He concluded this portion of the affidavit:
Let's move our little finger again and begin to pick up
where we left off with our strike last spring. Let's
begin to shut down the machinery of war. I think
that the suggested target of the computer center is as
good a place to begin as any. So the content of the
entire speech was to strike against the invasion ol
Laos. In making this speech, and the one on the
preceding night, I thought that I was operating
entirely within the precedent established during the
invasion of Cambodia when the overwhelming majori
ty of the faculty and students of the majority of
departments and schools of the University voted to
go on strike. For instance, my own department on
May 4, 1970 voted overwhelmingly in favor of a
strike for an indefinite period, demanding: 1. An
immediate withdrawal ol all American forces from
Southeast Asia; 2. The end of political repression at
home, in particular the government's systematic
attempt to eliminate the Black Panther and other
political dissidents; 3. The removal of KOTC from
the Stanford campus by the end of the academic
quarter; 4. An end to all war-related and secret
research on the Stanford campus by the end of the
quarter.
In the hearing, he described the meaning of his speech
in essentially similar terms.
b. Hearing Witnesses' Interpretation
University Administration witnesses testified that the
crowd was moved by Professor Franklin's speech and
that he served as a catalyst to get the group moving in
the direction of the Computation Center. One of
Professor Franklin's witnesses felt that the Computation
Center was an appropriate target. He said that a
"shutdown" of the University could range from "blast
various parts of it from the face of Santa Clara County"
to taking over a building as had occurred at Lncina Hall
the year before. One of liis witnesses testified that
Professor Franklin was trying to bring factions together
but didn't influence tactics already decided; two felt the
decision to go to the Computation Center had been
arrived at the night before and the purpose of the speech
was to support a Cambodia-type strike; two thought
Professor Franklin's speech was just educational; two
thought that he was not as influential as a middle-aged
salesman who had spoken earlier; one felt that the
purpose of the White Plaza rally was to choose a target
and to recruit more people.
4. Summary of Principal Points oj Defense
Several prominent elements recurred in defense testi
mony and argument on the White Plaza speech:
(a) A widespread inclination to shut down the
Computation Center, and to carry out a variety of
disruptive activities, was formed over the preceding
several days. It was justified in terms of Stanford's
complicity in the war and the Gamut-H program at
the Computation Center. It was consistent with
long-standing antipathy to the war in Asia and to
Stanford's allegedly vital role in the war. It was
exacerbated by the current news of military action in
Laos.
(b) Such an inclination toward disruptive activity in
general, and toward the Computation Center in
particular, was widespread in and around the Univer
sity, especially in the "movement." The persons
inclined to these actions would have carried them out
regardless of any role Professor Franklin might have
had in encouraging, fostering or facilitating them.
(c) Professor Franklin's speech had little effect on
those present. It was political, analytical, and educa
tional, rather than tactical. It presented no danger to
persons or property.
(d) He was simply advocating a voluntary boycott or
legal strike at the Computation Center. Even if his
speech could be construed as advocating disruption of
the Computation Center, he had in mind no seriously
adverse consequences-only a vigorous mode of pro
test of the war and the University's role in it.
5. Analysis of Professor Franklin's White Plaza
Speech, February 10.
a. Background and Foreseeable Consequences of
Computation Center Occupation
The fact that potential for major damage within the
Computation Center existed must have been well known
to Professor Franklin. The mechanisms to achieve such
damage were thoroughly identified during the Dinkel
spiel meeting the previous night. Highly publicized
computer occupations leading to extensive damage had
recently occurred at other universities. Testimony in
dicates that the decision not to damage the computer in
the face of eviction by the police was taken by the
demonstrators after the occupation was in force. Pro
fessor Franklin could reasonably expect that an occupa
tion of the Computation Center would involve great
risks to the computer and to the members of the
University community who rely upon it, including the
staff of the Computation Center. It should be empha
sized that the research and education of many people
throughout the University were in jeopardy.
In some respects a computer plays a role in a modern
university not unlike that of a library: it receives,
catalogues, processes and stores information and it
makes it available in various forms as required. To attack
a computation center because some of its information is
considered evil is little different from attacking an entire
library for harboring a few evil books. Professor Franklin
should have known that the occupation of the Computa
tion Center would lead to an agonizing decision by the
University administration whether to request police to
evict the occupiers, thereby ending a costly seizure at
the expense of an increased risk of damage.
The demonstrators showed no serious inclination to
consider the genuine complexities of computer use.
They made minimal inquiry about uses of the computer
—considering only on-line medical use, and not investiga
ting even that use thoroughly. They showed no concern
for the relation of the computer to other problems
involving human welfare. As a consequence of their
action, 700 to 800 jobs were not run that day; no one
knows how many more would have been impaired if the
occupiers had not been evicted. The social cost of
vigilante action in regard to computers or similar
facilities can become very high.
We heard no evidence that demonstrators made any
serious attempt to communicate with responsible of
ficers of the University in order to inquire about the
state of the Gamut-H program, or the ways in which
research policies are administered in regard to computer
use, prior to the forceful occupation of the Center.
Indeed, one of Professor Franklin's witnesses testified
that the Gamut-H program was known to the "move
ment" for a week or two, but a decision was made to
delay its announcement pending a favorable moment for
protest activity. The military action in Laos provided
such an opportunity. If the news of Gamut-H could be
held a week or two in private, why was instant action
suddenly required on February 10? Professor Franklin
and his witnesses agreed that advocacy towards shut
down of the Computation Center proceeded on the basis
of publications and statements of The Inquisition;
shutdown of the Computation Center was certainly not

a last resort measure. Thus, a poorly checked complaint
was made public after a tactical delay and then rapidly
shifted into coercive action with only the most rudi
mentary attempt at negotiating the grievance. Finally, in
view of the expressed rationale for forceful occupation
of the Computation Center, it is noteworthy that the
Gamut-H program was not even mentioned at any point
in the lengthy tape recording of the White Plaza rally.
b. The Speech Itself
Professor Franklin urged the Board to consider his
speeches in their full context. He particularly called our
attention to protests at Stanford, to the events of the
preceding few days, and to the Dinkelspiel rally of
February 9. These have been summarized earlier.
Throughout these turbulent events, a persistent differ
ence of opinion is manifested between those who place
primary emphasis on the University's role in the war and
those who place primary emphasis on the role of the
government. Professor Franklin clearly belongs in the
former category. In a Dinkelspiel speech of February 9th
and the White Plaza speech of February 10th, he is
severely critical of the University's role in fostering the
design and execution of the war. He strongly urges his
listeners to direct their attention to the University,
expressing hostility toward its trustees, administration,
and some student body leaders. He views the University
as centrally culpable in the war, and directs attention
away from the federal government. This characterization
of the University has the effect of justifying strong
protest or retaliation.
Within this framework, the "movement" chose to
focus attention on the Computation Center as a symbol
and instrument of the war. The February 9th rally is full
of angry references to the Computation Center—the
culpability of its users, its vulnerability, its suitability for
attack and possibly even for destruction. Professor
Franklin must have been aware of this danger to the
Computation Center-to its functions, its hardware, and
to the large number of people who rely upon it in their
work. These matters had been discussed extensively at
the February 9th rally in which he was an active
participant. He also took part in an investigatory march
that followed the February 9th rally, a preparation for
the likelihood of disruptive action the following day. He
admits in testimony and argument that he gave strong
support to the correctness of action against the Compu
tation Center before, during, and after its occupation,
specifically including the White Plaza rally.
In the main, the purpose of the White Plaza rally of
February 10th appears to have been: (1) to increase the
numbers available for protest activity; (2) to settle
firmly on a target. In respect to (2) the Computation
Center appeared to be the most likely target as a result
of the February 9th meeting, but the Hoover Institution
was still under consideration; two student leaders advo
cated nondisruptive political activity, but they were
strongly criticized by Professor Franklin and others.
Professor Franklin was a highly respected leader of a
group advocating intense hostility to the University as
well as disdain for nondisruptive modes of protest and
for electoral politics. His White Plaza speech contains an
approving reference to material damage to Stanlord
University, and his testimony on these events provides
repeated justification for such damage. At White Plaza
on February 10th, this orientation was brought sharply
to bear on the Computation Center.
It is uncontested that at the White Plaza rally
Professor Franklin concluded his speech by stating
". . .what we are asking is.. .to begin to shut down the
most obvious machinery of war, such as, and I think it is
a good target, that Computation Center.. ." and that
subsequently the Stanford Computation Center, al
though officially declared closed, was forcefully oc
cupied, resulting in shutdown of operation and minor

damage. It is also uncontested that many of the
occupiers were in the audience of Professor Franklin's
speech.
Professor Franklin has also asserted that a firm
decision to shut down the Computation Center was
already reached on February 9, and that therefore his
speech on February 10 could not have contributed to
the subsequent course of events. The evidence does not
support the assertion. The meeting on February 9th held
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium identified a spectrum of
options for action, and two-action against the Hoover
Institution and against the Computation Center-were
left as leading candidates. The preceding summary of
Dinkelspiel (February 9) and White Pla/.a (February 10)
rallies makes this clear. Moreover, several witnesses (both
for the administration and for Professor Franklin)
testified that specific action against the University was
not settled, or that they were undecided whether to
participate in the Computation Center action until they
attended this rally at which Professor Franklin gave the
final speech.
C. Professor Franklin's Use of the Term "Strike "
The Board has found it helpful to pay special
attention to the context for subsequent events provided
by the Dinkelspiel rally of the night of February 9th.
Both the University Administration and Professor Frank
lin devoted considerable attention to this background. In
that connection, we think it important to note that
Professor Franklin himself placed special emphasis dur
ing the hearing on the importance of that rally for
providing context. For that reason, we find the introduc
tion to his own analysis of that topic in this supplemen
tary written brief (page 106) rather unreasonable. He
says"The administration attempts to prove that the real
meaning of Franklin's speech can be found lurking in
several statements gleaned from the lengthy meeting at
Dinkelspiel." If the Administration did so, it was at
Professor Franklin's own invitation.
Our view of the matter is that Professor Franklin was
right the first time: the Dinkelspiel rally does provide
important insights into the speech that follows. It is
analyzed extensively above, in the section on "Back
ground to Events of February 10, 1972." We here
comment on the view presented by Prolessor Franklin in
his supplementary written brief. The main thrust of his
argument is that the rally was a very general discussion,
organized primarily along the lines of planning a strike;
he says (p. 109) "The reason there were no plans for a
picket sign is that there were no plans for anything
beyond a meeting and a general sort of strike." He also
asserts (p. 107) "There was never a real discussion of the
variety of ways the Computer Center could be shut
down except along the general lines of a strike."
In fact, his account tends to select heavily those
speeches from the Dinkelspiel rally that emphasize the
non-coercive aspects of the kind of "strike" he is talking
about. For example, he ignores the following speech
early in the rally:
And so the only reason that we would attack the
University would be on the grounds of effectiveness,
though I would try to direct the demands toward
specific things in the community and that are
attackable like the Computation Center.. . .
In addition, there are two other early calJs to stop
talking and commence action. Later, Braunstein recom
mends a range of actions, including some that lie well
outside the range of legal actions that is subsumed under
the term "strike" when used in its normal context.
Indeed, the term "strike" clearly has a different
meaning to members of the "movement" at Stanford
than it does in ordinary usage. When preceded by the
modifying words "Cambodia-type," it encompasses a

wide range of actions, including some that are legal and
some that are illegal. The introduction of the concept of
a "mobile strike," which takes place well before the end
of the Dinkelspiel rally, was clearly a modification
introduced by numerical considerations: it was argued
that the number of people was inadequate to close a
number of things simultaneously, but that they might
succeed if targets were attacked seriatim. It is clear that
in all of these uses, the term "strike" encompasses a
wide range of activities. In his supplementary written
brief, Professor Franklin borrows the conventional
meaning from the labor context, and then employs it as
a flag in which to wrap a much broader range of
conduct. All of the speakers who spoke late in the rally,
after they had developed some consensus around the
notion of "mobile strike" and were discussing a target,
used language that clearly involves the expectation of
being confronted by the police, moved out of buildings,
and the like. Persuading workers to leave their jobs,
standing in the doorways to bear "moral witness,"
picketing — these activities get little or no prominence in
the discussion, although Professor Franklin tries to
persuade us that these activities are really the dominant
elements of a "strike." The context so established is not
substantially changed, in our view, by the earlier
speakers at the White Plaza rally.
The words "shut it down" imply a cessation of
function that can sometimes be achieved by a strike,
strictly defined, but may be achieved by other means as
well. From a careful reading of the Dinkelspiel trans
cript, we are persuaded that the context for the White
Plaza rally was one in which the prospective shutting
down of the Computation Center was to be achieved
primarily by means going beyond the range of legal
"strike" tactics. We find Professor Franklin's use of the
term "strike" disingenuous, and we believe that his own
exhortation to "shut down" the Computation Center
was, given that context, an intentional invitation to
employ such extra-legal means as might be necessary.
In summary, could Professor Franklin reasonably
have expected that his speech would have contributed to
the likelihood of the occupation? Professor Franklin
asserts that he was only advocating a legal strike or
voluntary boycott of the Computation Center, or
alternatively that he gave no thoughts at all to the
consequences of his speech. The preceding analysis of
the Dinkelspiel rally makes this a highly dubious
proposition. Although there clearly were discussions of a
"strike" against Stanford University during the rally at
Dinkelspiel and during the early portions of the White
Plaza rally, there is no evidence of preparation for a legal
strike or boycott: no plans for picketing; no direct effort
at persuasion of the workers of the Computation Center
to withhold their labor or for the users of the Center to
boycott the facility. In the present context, the term
"strike" was a kind of euphemism for a broad range of
protest activities, including peaceful, coercive and vio
lent activities. We conclude that Professor Franklin must
reasonably have expected that his advocacy of "shut
down" would be interpreted by at least a substantial
portion of the audience as calling for forceful disruption
of the operation of the Center. Indeed, we believe that
this is what he meant.
CONCLUSION
We conclude that Professor Franklin must reasonably
have expected that his speech at White Plaza on
February 10, 1971, would increase the likelihood of
illegal occupation of the Computation Center immedi
ately following his speech, and that there was risk of
serious damage to the computer and its users. The Board
finds the evidence strongly persuasive that Professor
Franklin urged and incited his audience at White Plaza
towards disruption of University functions and shut
down of the Computation Center. We therefore sustain
charge No. 8.
A. CHARGES
The relevant University charges concerning the White
Plaza incident are contained in Paragraph 8 of the
"Statement of Charges" dated March 22, 1971. This
paragraph reads as follows:
8. On February 10, 1971, beginning at about 12
p.m., a rally was held at White Memorial Plaza to,
among other things, discuss methods of protesting
developments in the war in Indochina. Over tive
humdred students and other persons attended. During
the course of the rally two prinicpal courses of action
were discussed, one being to work in the non-Univer
sity community to bring about changes in govern
ment policy, the other being to disrupt University
functions and business. Professor Franklin intention
ally urged and incited students and other persons
present at the rally to follow the latter course of
action and specifically to shut down a University
computer facility known as the Computation Center.
Shortly thereafter a large number of students and
others left the rally and went to the Computation
Center whereupon many of these persons did in fact
occupy the Computation Center, prevent its opera
tion and obstruct movement in and out of the
building for several hours, terminating this unlawful
activity only when ordered to leave the building by
the police.
B. NATURE OF THE CHARGE
The general charge is that Professor Franklin urged
and incited the disruption of University functions; the
specific charge is that he urged and incited his audience
to shut down a University facility, the Computation
Center. Effectively, this means that his words, including
their delivery and their context, significantly increased
the likelihood of prohibited conduct on the part of his
audience; it means, moreover, that he must have anti
cipated that his speech, given its delivery and context,
would significantly increase the imminent likelihood of
prohibited conduct.
C. FINDINGS OF FACT
/. Prominent Themes in the White Plaza Rally
The noon-hour rally at White Plaza, attended at its
peak by about 700 people, had been proposed the night
before at the conclusion of a rally at Dinkelspiel Audi
torium. Most of the speeches given at the White Plaza
rally were available on tape recordings. Only a portion at
the outset was missing, and this was covered in testi
mony. The following themes emerged prominently in
the course of the White Plaza rally:
a. Many speakers discussed ways of protesting the
war in Southeast Asia. Three speakers, including two
student body leaders, favored an off-cainpus focus of
protest. They were severely criticized by five subsequent
speakers, who characterized liberal war protest in such
terms as "counter-insurgency." This may be illustrated
by the following speech:
Yeah, I'd just like to point out that the only time the
liberals and moderates come out of the woodwork is
when there is radical action on campus. . . .That's the
only way moderates and liberals can, can get off their
asses, is when the people around them are doing these
violent things which you consider to be useless.
b. On four occasions, there was reference to selection
of a protest target on campus; the desirability of alterna
tive possibilities was considered.
c. The Computation Center was referred to often
throughout the meeting. Its suitability as a protest target
was cited. In the final speech of the rally, Professor
Franklin called for shutting down the Computation
Center.
d. Some speakers emphasized Stanford's war com
plicity and the desirability of shutting down the Univer
sity in order to end that complicity.
e. Four speakers made reference to the concept of

different people taking protest action on different levels,
each doing his own thing. Three of these clearly included
coercive and violent behavior within the spectrum of
approved activities, and the fourth is unclear on this
poin<. The following quotations help to clarify this
important theme:
And so closing down Stanford is really a concrete
blow against the war. You see, that's a concrete way
of stopping, stopping things that are going on that
help the war by stopping that kind of research, by
stopping the programs that are run in the computer
center....
It's true that if we're writing letters to congressmen
we're probably not doing that much. But by striking
the University and by taking, by taking whatever
kinds of action we can, you see, on a lot of different
levels, some people may want to take over buildings,
some people will want to boycott class, some people
will want to cause classes to be boycotted, you see
it's not much good if English classes and the French
class aren't going on, but the Business School classes
and the Electronic Engineering classes are going on
and the Department of Defense research contracts are
still being carried out.
KZSU: The crowd is still growing here at White Plaza,
now about 700 people.
[new speaker] What really amazes me is like every
body that's here right now is like obviously against
the war. Now all this friction and all this bullshit
that's going on between radicals and conservatives
and liberals or whoever the fuck it is, it's all just
friction. Now, as long as people who are writing
letters or doing strikes, or breaking windows or what,
everybody's doing their own thing to stop that
fucking war over there. So, everybody do their own
thing, and let's stop that war now and altogether,
[applause]
112. The term "strike" was used several times, though
less than it had been the previous night at the Dinkel
spiel rally. Once again, it seemed to bear little relation to
the meaning of "strike" in labor disputes. Rather, it
seemed to refer to a broad spectrum of activities, some
non-coercive and some coercive. The most prominent
connotation was that of the "mobile strike" introduced
February 9th at Dinkelspiel—closing down one universi
ty facility after another by whatever means proved
feasible.
g. Six speakers made favorable reference to coercive
or violent behavior. This may be illustrated by a
recorded passage from Professor Franklin's speech:
. . .so want to talk about, about high consciousness,
the high consciousness is the consciousness of the
people most oppressed by U.S. imperialism, which
includes as a main institution of that Stanford
University. And that's why whenever people from
that community, whenever poor working class youth
from that community, get a chance to come on the
campus at Stanford and do a little material damage,
they are very eager to do so. Because they recognize
what Stanford University is, even if people here
don't.
2. Summary of Professor Franklin's speech
Professor Franklin gave the closing and longest speech
of the rally. (See Appendix II.) He called for a
willingness to sacrifice in the service of protest activity.
He criticized student body leaders for allegedly subvert
ing the activity of protesters. He gave some of his
personal history in antiwar activity. He cited a poll
indicating that people with little education expressed
more opposition to the war in Southeast Asia than those
with higher levels of education.
At the passage quoted earlier, referring to material
damage by working class youth at Stanford, Professor
Franklin's delivery shifted to a higher intensity, remain

ing at this level until the conclusion. He continued later,
Well, when we talk about, see we're just ripping off
the term strike when talking about striking at
Stanford. This isn't a strike. We're not risking
anything. It's a voluntary boycott—a shutdown of
some of the activities of the University as a demon
stration of something. Now, now what we called a
strike last year, and it lasted really about three days
and it kind of dragged on, and you know, in an odds
and ends way and some people did it. But just the
fact that we were able to move our little finger that
much, that electrified the working people of this
area.. ..
He ended the speech by saying,
See, now what we're asking is for people to make that
little tiny gesture to show that we're willing to
inconvenience ourselves a little bit and to begin to
shut down the most obvious machinery of war, such
as, and I think it is a good target, that Computation
Center, [applause and shouts of "right on. .. ."]
Immediately after Professor Franklin's speech, the
chairman asked for a vote to choose between the
Computation Center and Hoover. About 100 hands
(primarily in front) voted affirmatively on the question
of shutting down the former, whereupon the chairman
announced that a majority favored this course. He said,
"And so I would suggest that we go over there and visit
it." At that point, a voice is heard calling, "Shut it
down," echoing the comment made just before by
Professor Franklin and the meeting's chairman.
As the crowd was leaving they were instructed,
When people go over to the Comp Center, they
should all go in a group and move relatively slowly so
that the group can stay together. Also the meeting at
8 o'clock tonight in the Old Union Courtyard is a
very important meeting because we can decide what
we want to do tomorrow. There are some things that
we can't close down now, but we can close them
down if we get to them early in the morning.
3. Interpretation of the Meaning of Professor Frank
lin 's White Plaza Speech
a. Professor Franklin's Own Interpretation
There were several differing points of view regarding
the meaning of the speech given by Professor Franklin.
Professor Franklin himself in an affidavit dated February
24, 1971 described the meaning of his speech:
Actually, in order to understand either the content of
my speech or that of the rally itself, it is necessary to
see it in relation to the events of the previous evening.
The debate was essentially over the same issues, that
is, whether to focus off campus or call for a strike on
campus, and whether a strike could be effective.
Much of the debate was repetitious of the previous
night, but since most of the people at that meeting
felt bound by the vote, those who had wanted to stop
the munition train did not make their proposal. The
main spokesmen for off-campus work were Bob
Grant and Larry Diamond, who proposed doing
precinct work to elect so-called peace candidates. It
was my belief that these two were not being honest,
and that their main purpose was to prevent any
effective action and to advance their own political
careers. It was with this in mind, plus a sense that
many people were becoming very impatient with the
idle debate of the rally, that I rose to speak. My
intention was, as it had been the previous night, to
build the anti-war movement on the campus. ...
He concluded this portion of the affidavit:
Let's move our little finger again and begin to pick up
where we left off with our strike last spring. Let's
begin to shut down the machinery of war. I think
that the suggested target of the computer center is as
good a place to begin as any. So the content of the
entire speech was to strike against the invasion ol
Laos. In making this speech, and the one on the
preceding night, I thought that I was operating
entirely within the precedent established during the
invasion of Cambodia when the overwhelming majori
ty of the faculty and students of the majority of
departments and schools of the University voted to
go on strike. For instance, my own department on
May 4, 1970 voted overwhelmingly in favor of a
strike for an indefinite period, demanding: 1. An
immediate withdrawal ol all American forces from
Southeast Asia; 2. The end of political repression at
home, in particular the government's systematic
attempt to eliminate the Black Panther and other
political dissidents; 3. The removal of KOTC from
the Stanford campus by the end of the academic
quarter; 4. An end to all war-related and secret
research on the Stanford campus by the end of the
quarter.
In the hearing, he described the meaning of his speech
in essentially similar terms.
b. Hearing Witnesses' Interpretation
University Administration witnesses testified that the
crowd was moved by Professor Franklin's speech and
that he served as a catalyst to get the group moving in
the direction of the Computation Center. One of
Professor Franklin's witnesses felt that the Computation
Center was an appropriate target. He said that a
"shutdown" of the University could range from "blast
various parts of it from the face of Santa Clara County"
to taking over a building as had occurred at Lncina Hall
the year before. One of liis witnesses testified that
Professor Franklin was trying to bring factions together
but didn't influence tactics already decided; two felt the
decision to go to the Computation Center had been
arrived at the night before and the purpose of the speech
was to support a Cambodia-type strike; two thought
Professor Franklin's speech was just educational; two
thought that he was not as influential as a middle-aged
salesman who had spoken earlier; one felt that the
purpose of the White Plaza rally was to choose a target
and to recruit more people.
4. Summary of Principal Points oj Defense
Several prominent elements recurred in defense testi
mony and argument on the White Plaza speech:
(a) A widespread inclination to shut down the
Computation Center, and to carry out a variety of
disruptive activities, was formed over the preceding
several days. It was justified in terms of Stanford's
complicity in the war and the Gamut-H program at
the Computation Center. It was consistent with
long-standing antipathy to the war in Asia and to
Stanford's allegedly vital role in the war. It was
exacerbated by the current news of military action in
Laos.
(b) Such an inclination toward disruptive activity in
general, and toward the Computation Center in
particular, was widespread in and around the Univer
sity, especially in the "movement." The persons
inclined to these actions would have carried them out
regardless of any role Professor Franklin might have
had in encouraging, fostering or facilitating them.
(c) Professor Franklin's speech had little effect on
those present. It was political, analytical, and educa
tional, rather than tactical. It presented no danger to
persons or property.
(d) He was simply advocating a voluntary boycott or
legal strike at the Computation Center. Even if his
speech could be construed as advocating disruption of
the Computation Center, he had in mind no seriously
adverse consequences-only a vigorous mode of pro
test of the war and the University's role in it.
5. Analysis of Professor Franklin's White Plaza
Speech, February 10.
a. Background and Foreseeable Consequences of
Computation Center Occupation
The fact that potential for major damage within the
Computation Center existed must have been well known
to Professor Franklin. The mechanisms to achieve such
damage were thoroughly identified during the Dinkel
spiel meeting the previous night. Highly publicized
computer occupations leading to extensive damage had
recently occurred at other universities. Testimony in
dicates that the decision not to damage the computer in
the face of eviction by the police was taken by the
demonstrators after the occupation was in force. Pro
fessor Franklin could reasonably expect that an occupa
tion of the Computation Center would involve great
risks to the computer and to the members of the
University community who rely upon it, including the
staff of the Computation Center. It should be empha
sized that the research and education of many people
throughout the University were in jeopardy.
In some respects a computer plays a role in a modern
university not unlike that of a library: it receives,
catalogues, processes and stores information and it
makes it available in various forms as required. To attack
a computation center because some of its information is
considered evil is little different from attacking an entire
library for harboring a few evil books. Professor Franklin
should have known that the occupation of the Computa
tion Center would lead to an agonizing decision by the
University administration whether to request police to
evict the occupiers, thereby ending a costly seizure at
the expense of an increased risk of damage.
The demonstrators showed no serious inclination to
consider the genuine complexities of computer use.
They made minimal inquiry about uses of the computer
—considering only on-line medical use, and not investiga
ting even that use thoroughly. They showed no concern
for the relation of the computer to other problems
involving human welfare. As a consequence of their
action, 700 to 800 jobs were not run that day; no one
knows how many more would have been impaired if the
occupiers had not been evicted. The social cost of
vigilante action in regard to computers or similar
facilities can become very high.
We heard no evidence that demonstrators made any
serious attempt to communicate with responsible of
ficers of the University in order to inquire about the
state of the Gamut-H program, or the ways in which
research policies are administered in regard to computer
use, prior to the forceful occupation of the Center.
Indeed, one of Professor Franklin's witnesses testified
that the Gamut-H program was known to the "move
ment" for a week or two, but a decision was made to
delay its announcement pending a favorable moment for
protest activity. The military action in Laos provided
such an opportunity. If the news of Gamut-H could be
held a week or two in private, why was instant action
suddenly required on February 10? Professor Franklin
and his witnesses agreed that advocacy towards shut
down of the Computation Center proceeded on the basis
of publications and statements of The Inquisition;
shutdown of the Computation Center was certainly not

a last resort measure. Thus, a poorly checked complaint
was made public after a tactical delay and then rapidly
shifted into coercive action with only the most rudi
mentary attempt at negotiating the grievance. Finally, in
view of the expressed rationale for forceful occupation
of the Computation Center, it is noteworthy that the
Gamut-H program was not even mentioned at any point
in the lengthy tape recording of the White Plaza rally.
b. The Speech Itself
Professor Franklin urged the Board to consider his
speeches in their full context. He particularly called our
attention to protests at Stanford, to the events of the
preceding few days, and to the Dinkelspiel rally of
February 9. These have been summarized earlier.
Throughout these turbulent events, a persistent differ
ence of opinion is manifested between those who place
primary emphasis on the University's role in the war and
those who place primary emphasis on the role of the
government. Professor Franklin clearly belongs in the
former category. In a Dinkelspiel speech of February 9th
and the White Plaza speech of February 10th, he is
severely critical of the University's role in fostering the
design and execution of the war. He strongly urges his
listeners to direct their attention to the University,
expressing hostility toward its trustees, administration,
and some student body leaders. He views the University
as centrally culpable in the war, and directs attention
away from the federal government. This characterization
of the University has the effect of justifying strong
protest or retaliation.
Within this framework, the "movement" chose to
focus attention on the Computation Center as a symbol
and instrument of the war. The February 9th rally is full
of angry references to the Computation Center—the
culpability of its users, its vulnerability, its suitability for
attack and possibly even for destruction. Professor
Franklin must have been aware of this danger to the
Computation Center-to its functions, its hardware, and
to the large number of people who rely upon it in their
work. These matters had been discussed extensively at
the February 9th rally in which he was an active
participant. He also took part in an investigatory march
that followed the February 9th rally, a preparation for
the likelihood of disruptive action the following day. He
admits in testimony and argument that he gave strong
support to the correctness of action against the Compu
tation Center before, during, and after its occupation,
specifically including the White Plaza rally.
In the main, the purpose of the White Plaza rally of
February 10th appears to have been: (1) to increase the
numbers available for protest activity; (2) to settle
firmly on a target. In respect to (2) the Computation
Center appeared to be the most likely target as a result
of the February 9th meeting, but the Hoover Institution
was still under consideration; two student leaders advo
cated nondisruptive political activity, but they were
strongly criticized by Professor Franklin and others.
Professor Franklin was a highly respected leader of a
group advocating intense hostility to the University as
well as disdain for nondisruptive modes of protest and
for electoral politics. His White Plaza speech contains an
approving reference to material damage to Stanlord
University, and his testimony on these events provides
repeated justification for such damage. At White Plaza
on February 10th, this orientation was brought sharply
to bear on the Computation Center.
It is uncontested that at the White Plaza rally
Professor Franklin concluded his speech by stating
". . .what we are asking is.. .to begin to shut down the
most obvious machinery of war, such as, and I think it is
a good target, that Computation Center.. ." and that
subsequently the Stanford Computation Center, al
though officially declared closed, was forcefully oc
cupied, resulting in shutdown of operation and minor

damage. It is also uncontested that many of the
occupiers were in the audience of Professor Franklin's
speech.
Professor Franklin has also asserted that a firm
decision to shut down the Computation Center was
already reached on February 9, and that therefore his
speech on February 10 could not have contributed to
the subsequent course of events. The evidence does not
support the assertion. The meeting on February 9th held
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium identified a spectrum of
options for action, and two-action against the Hoover
Institution and against the Computation Center-were
left as leading candidates. The preceding summary of
Dinkelspiel (February 9) and White Pla/.a (February 10)
rallies makes this clear. Moreover, several witnesses (both
for the administration and for Professor Franklin)
testified that specific action against the University was
not settled, or that they were undecided whether to
participate in the Computation Center action until they
attended this rally at which Professor Franklin gave the
final speech.
C. Professor Franklin's Use of the Term "Strike "
The Board has found it helpful to pay special
attention to the context for subsequent events provided
by the Dinkelspiel rally of the night of February 9th.
Both the University Administration and Professor Frank
lin devoted considerable attention to this background. In
that connection, we think it important to note that
Professor Franklin himself placed special emphasis dur
ing the hearing on the importance of that rally for
providing context. For that reason, we find the introduc
tion to his own analysis of that topic in this supplemen
tary written brief (page 106) rather unreasonable. He
says"The administration attempts to prove that the real
meaning of Franklin's speech can be found lurking in
several statements gleaned from the lengthy meeting at
Dinkelspiel." If the Administration did so, it was at
Professor Franklin's own invitation.
Our view of the matter is that Professor Franklin was
right the first time: the Dinkelspiel rally does provide
important insights into the speech that follows. It is
analyzed extensively above, in the section on "Back
ground to Events of February 10, 1972." We here
comment on the view presented by Prolessor Franklin in
his supplementary written brief. The main thrust of his
argument is that the rally was a very general discussion,
organized primarily along the lines of planning a strike;
he says (p. 109) "The reason there were no plans for a
picket sign is that there were no plans for anything
beyond a meeting and a general sort of strike." He also
asserts (p. 107) "There was never a real discussion of the
variety of ways the Computer Center could be shut
down except along the general lines of a strike."
In fact, his account tends to select heavily those
speeches from the Dinkelspiel rally that emphasize the
non-coercive aspects of the kind of "strike" he is talking
about. For example, he ignores the following speech
early in the rally:
And so the only reason that we would attack the
University would be on the grounds of effectiveness,
though I would try to direct the demands toward
specific things in the community and that are
attackable like the Computation Center.. . .
In addition, there are two other early calJs to stop
talking and commence action. Later, Braunstein recom
mends a range of actions, including some that lie well
outside the range of legal actions that is subsumed under
the term "strike" when used in its normal context.
Indeed, the term "strike" clearly has a different
meaning to members of the "movement" at Stanford
than it does in ordinary usage. When preceded by the
modifying words "Cambodia-type," it encompasses a

wide range of actions, including some that are legal and
some that are illegal. The introduction of the concept of
a "mobile strike," which takes place well before the end
of the Dinkelspiel rally, was clearly a modification
introduced by numerical considerations: it was argued
that the number of people was inadequate to close a
number of things simultaneously, but that they might
succeed if targets were attacked seriatim. It is clear that
in all of these uses, the term "strike" encompasses a
wide range of activities. In his supplementary written
brief, Professor Franklin borrows the conventional
meaning from the labor context, and then employs it as
a flag in which to wrap a much broader range of
conduct. All of the speakers who spoke late in the rally,
after they had developed some consensus around the
notion of "mobile strike" and were discussing a target,
used language that clearly involves the expectation of
being confronted by the police, moved out of buildings,
and the like. Persuading workers to leave their jobs,
standing in the doorways to bear "moral witness,"
picketing — these activities get little or no prominence in
the discussion, although Professor Franklin tries to
persuade us that these activities are really the dominant
elements of a "strike." The context so established is not
substantially changed, in our view, by the earlier
speakers at the White Plaza rally.
The words "shut it down" imply a cessation of
function that can sometimes be achieved by a strike,
strictly defined, but may be achieved by other means as
well. From a careful reading of the Dinkelspiel trans
cript, we are persuaded that the context for the White
Plaza rally was one in which the prospective shutting
down of the Computation Center was to be achieved
primarily by means going beyond the range of legal
"strike" tactics. We find Professor Franklin's use of the
term "strike" disingenuous, and we believe that his own
exhortation to "shut down" the Computation Center
was, given that context, an intentional invitation to
employ such extra-legal means as might be necessary.
In summary, could Professor Franklin reasonably
have expected that his speech would have contributed to
the likelihood of the occupation? Professor Franklin
asserts that he was only advocating a legal strike or
voluntary boycott of the Computation Center, or
alternatively that he gave no thoughts at all to the
consequences of his speech. The preceding analysis of
the Dinkelspiel rally makes this a highly dubious
proposition. Although there clearly were discussions of a
"strike" against Stanford University during the rally at
Dinkelspiel and during the early portions of the White
Plaza rally, there is no evidence of preparation for a legal
strike or boycott: no plans for picketing; no direct effort
at persuasion of the workers of the Computation Center
to withhold their labor or for the users of the Center to
boycott the facility. In the present context, the term
"strike" was a kind of euphemism for a broad range of
protest activities, including peaceful, coercive and vio
lent activities. We conclude that Professor Franklin must
reasonably have expected that his advocacy of "shut
down" would be interpreted by at least a substantial
portion of the audience as calling for forceful disruption
of the operation of the Center. Indeed, we believe that
this is what he meant.
CONCLUSION
We conclude that Professor Franklin must reasonably
have expected that his speech at White Plaza on
February 10, 1971, would increase the likelihood of
illegal occupation of the Computation Center immedi
ately following his speech, and that there was risk of
serious damage to the computer and its users. The Board
finds the evidence strongly persuasive that Professor
Franklin urged and incited his audience at White Plaza
towards disruption of University functions and shut
down of the Computation Center. We therefore sustain
charge No. 8.
A. CHARGES
The relevant University charges concerning the White
Plaza incident are contained in Paragraph 8 of the
"Statement of Charges" dated March 22, 1971. This
paragraph reads as follows:
8. On February 10, 1971, beginning at about 12
p.m., a rally was held at White Memorial Plaza to,
among other things, discuss methods of protesting
developments in the war in Indochina. Over tive
humdred students and other persons attended. During
the course of the rally two prinicpal courses of action
were discussed, one being to work in the non-Univer
sity community to bring about changes in govern
ment policy, the other being to disrupt University
functions and business. Professor Franklin intention
ally urged and incited students and other persons
present at the rally to follow the latter course of
action and specifically to shut down a University
computer facility known as the Computation Center.
Shortly thereafter a large number of students and
others left the rally and went to the Computation
Center whereupon many of these persons did in fact
occupy the Computation Center, prevent its opera
tion and obstruct movement in and out of the
building for several hours, terminating this unlawful
activity only when ordered to leave the building by
the police.
B. NATURE OF THE CHARGE
The general charge is that Professor Franklin urged
and incited the disruption of University functions; the
specific charge is that he urged and incited his audience
to shut down a University facility, the Computation
Center. Effectively, this means that his words, including
their delivery and their context, significantly increased
the likelihood of prohibited conduct on the part of his
audience; it means, moreover, that he must have anti
cipated that his speech, given its delivery and context,
would significantly increase the imminent likelihood of
prohibited conduct.
C. FINDINGS OF FACT
/. Prominent Themes in the White Plaza Rally
The noon-hour rally at White Plaza, attended at its
peak by about 700 people, had been proposed the night
before at the conclusion of a rally at Dinkelspiel Audi
torium. Most of the speeches given at the White Plaza
rally were available on tape recordings. Only a portion at
the outset was missing, and this was covered in testi
mony. The following themes emerged prominently in
the course of the White Plaza rally:
a. Many speakers discussed ways of protesting the
war in Southeast Asia. Three speakers, including two
student body leaders, favored an off-cainpus focus of
protest. They were severely criticized by five subsequent
speakers, who characterized liberal war protest in such
terms as "counter-insurgency." This may be illustrated
by the following speech:
Yeah, I'd just like to point out that the only time the
liberals and moderates come out of the woodwork is
when there is radical action on campus. . . .That's the
only way moderates and liberals can, can get off their
asses, is when the people around them are doing these
violent things which you consider to be useless.
b. On four occasions, there was reference to selection
of a protest target on campus; the desirability of alterna
tive possibilities was considered.
c. The Computation Center was referred to often
throughout the meeting. Its suitability as a protest target
was cited. In the final speech of the rally, Professor
Franklin called for shutting down the Computation
Center.
d. Some speakers emphasized Stanford's war com
plicity and the desirability of shutting down the Univer
sity in order to end that complicity.
e. Four speakers made reference to the concept of

different people taking protest action on different levels,
each doing his own thing. Three of these clearly included
coercive and violent behavior within the spectrum of
approved activities, and the fourth is unclear on this
poin<. The following quotations help to clarify this
important theme:
And so closing down Stanford is really a concrete
blow against the war. You see, that's a concrete way
of stopping, stopping things that are going on that
help the war by stopping that kind of research, by
stopping the programs that are run in the computer
center....
It's true that if we're writing letters to congressmen
we're probably not doing that much. But by striking
the University and by taking, by taking whatever
kinds of action we can, you see, on a lot of different
levels, some people may want to take over buildings,
some people will want to boycott class, some people
will want to cause classes to be boycotted, you see
it's not much good if English classes and the French
class aren't going on, but the Business School classes
and the Electronic Engineering classes are going on
and the Department of Defense research contracts are
still being carried out.
KZSU: The crowd is still growing here at White Plaza,
now about 700 people.
[new speaker] What really amazes me is like every
body that's here right now is like obviously against
the war. Now all this friction and all this bullshit
that's going on between radicals and conservatives
and liberals or whoever the fuck it is, it's all just
friction. Now, as long as people who are writing
letters or doing strikes, or breaking windows or what,
everybody's doing their own thing to stop that
fucking war over there. So, everybody do their own
thing, and let's stop that war now and altogether,
[applause]
112. The term "strike" was used several times, though
less than it had been the previous night at the Dinkel
spiel rally. Once again, it seemed to bear little relation to
the meaning of "strike" in labor disputes. Rather, it
seemed to refer to a broad spectrum of activities, some
non-coercive and some coercive. The most prominent
connotation was that of the "mobile strike" introduced
February 9th at Dinkelspiel—closing down one universi
ty facility after another by whatever means proved
feasible.
g. Six speakers made favorable reference to coercive
or violent behavior. This may be illustrated by a
recorded passage from Professor Franklin's speech:
. . .so want to talk about, about high consciousness,
the high consciousness is the consciousness of the
people most oppressed by U.S. imperialism, which
includes as a main institution of that Stanford
University. And that's why whenever people from
that community, whenever poor working class youth
from that community, get a chance to come on the
campus at Stanford and do a little material damage,
they are very eager to do so. Because they recognize
what Stanford University is, even if people here
don't.
2. Summary of Professor Franklin's speech
Professor Franklin gave the closing and longest speech
of the rally. (See Appendix II.) He called for a
willingness to sacrifice in the service of protest activity.
He criticized student body leaders for allegedly subvert
ing the activity of protesters. He gave some of his
personal history in antiwar activity. He cited a poll
indicating that people with little education expressed
more opposition to the war in Southeast Asia than those
with higher levels of education.
At the passage quoted earlier, referring to material
damage by working class youth at Stanford, Professor
Franklin's delivery shifted to a higher intensity, remain

ing at this level until the conclusion. He continued later,
Well, when we talk about, see we're just ripping off
the term strike when talking about striking at
Stanford. This isn't a strike. We're not risking
anything. It's a voluntary boycott—a shutdown of
some of the activities of the University as a demon
stration of something. Now, now what we called a
strike last year, and it lasted really about three days
and it kind of dragged on, and you know, in an odds
and ends way and some people did it. But just the
fact that we were able to move our little finger that
much, that electrified the working people of this
area.. ..
He ended the speech by saying,
See, now what we're asking is for people to make that
little tiny gesture to show that we're willing to
inconvenience ourselves a little bit and to begin to
shut down the most obvious machinery of war, such
as, and I think it is a good target, that Computation
Center, [applause and shouts of "right on. .. ."]
Immediately after Professor Franklin's speech, the
chairman asked for a vote to choose between the
Computation Center and Hoover. About 100 hands
(primarily in front) voted affirmatively on the question
of shutting down the former, whereupon the chairman
announced that a majority favored this course. He said,
"And so I would suggest that we go over there and visit
it." At that point, a voice is heard calling, "Shut it
down," echoing the comment made just before by
Professor Franklin and the meeting's chairman.
As the crowd was leaving they were instructed,
When people go over to the Comp Center, they
should all go in a group and move relatively slowly so
that the group can stay together. Also the meeting at
8 o'clock tonight in the Old Union Courtyard is a
very important meeting because we can decide what
we want to do tomorrow. There are some things that
we can't close down now, but we can close them
down if we get to them early in the morning.
3. Interpretation of the Meaning of Professor Frank
lin 's White Plaza Speech
a. Professor Franklin's Own Interpretation
There were several differing points of view regarding
the meaning of the speech given by Professor Franklin.
Professor Franklin himself in an affidavit dated February
24, 1971 described the meaning of his speech:
Actually, in order to understand either the content of
my speech or that of the rally itself, it is necessary to
see it in relation to the events of the previous evening.
The debate was essentially over the same issues, that
is, whether to focus off campus or call for a strike on
campus, and whether a strike could be effective.
Much of the debate was repetitious of the previous
night, but since most of the people at that meeting
felt bound by the vote, those who had wanted to stop
the munition train did not make their proposal. The
main spokesmen for off-campus work were Bob
Grant and Larry Diamond, who proposed doing
precinct work to elect so-called peace candidates. It
was my belief that these two were not being honest,
and that their main purpose was to prevent any
effective action and to advance their own political
careers. It was with this in mind, plus a sense that
many people were becoming very impatient with the
idle debate of the rally, that I rose to speak. My
intention was, as it had been the previous night, to
build the anti-war movement on the campus. ...
He concluded this portion of the affidavit:
Let's move our little finger again and begin to pick up
where we left off with our strike last spring. Let's
begin to shut down the machinery of war. I think
that the suggested target of the computer center is as
good a place to begin as any. So the content of the
entire speech was to strike against the invasion ol
Laos. In making this speech, and the one on the
preceding night, I thought that I was operating
entirely within the precedent established during the
invasion of Cambodia when the overwhelming majori
ty of the faculty and students of the majority of
departments and schools of the University voted to
go on strike. For instance, my own department on
May 4, 1970 voted overwhelmingly in favor of a
strike for an indefinite period, demanding: 1. An
immediate withdrawal ol all American forces from
Southeast Asia; 2. The end of political repression at
home, in particular the government's systematic
attempt to eliminate the Black Panther and other
political dissidents; 3. The removal of KOTC from
the Stanford campus by the end of the academic
quarter; 4. An end to all war-related and secret
research on the Stanford campus by the end of the
quarter.
In the hearing, he described the meaning of his speech
in essentially similar terms.
b. Hearing Witnesses' Interpretation
University Administration witnesses testified that the
crowd was moved by Professor Franklin's speech and
that he served as a catalyst to get the group moving in
the direction of the Computation Center. One of
Professor Franklin's witnesses felt that the Computation
Center was an appropriate target. He said that a
"shutdown" of the University could range from "blast
various parts of it from the face of Santa Clara County"
to taking over a building as had occurred at Lncina Hall
the year before. One of liis witnesses testified that
Professor Franklin was trying to bring factions together
but didn't influence tactics already decided; two felt the
decision to go to the Computation Center had been
arrived at the night before and the purpose of the speech
was to support a Cambodia-type strike; two thought
Professor Franklin's speech was just educational; two
thought that he was not as influential as a middle-aged
salesman who had spoken earlier; one felt that the
purpose of the White Plaza rally was to choose a target
and to recruit more people.
4. Summary of Principal Points oj Defense
Several prominent elements recurred in defense testi
mony and argument on the White Plaza speech:
(a) A widespread inclination to shut down the
Computation Center, and to carry out a variety of
disruptive activities, was formed over the preceding
several days. It was justified in terms of Stanford's
complicity in the war and the Gamut-H program at
the Computation Center. It was consistent with
long-standing antipathy to the war in Asia and to
Stanford's allegedly vital role in the war. It was
exacerbated by the current news of military action in
Laos.
(b) Such an inclination toward disruptive activity in
general, and toward the Computation Center in
particular, was widespread in and around the Univer
sity, especially in the "movement." The persons
inclined to these actions would have carried them out
regardless of any role Professor Franklin might have
had in encouraging, fostering or facilitating them.
(c) Professor Franklin's speech had little effect on
those present. It was political, analytical, and educa
tional, rather than tactical. It presented no danger to
persons or property.
(d) He was simply advocating a voluntary boycott or
legal strike at the Computation Center. Even if his
speech could be construed as advocating disruption of
the Computation Center, he had in mind no seriously
adverse consequences-only a vigorous mode of pro
test of the war and the University's role in it.
5. Analysis of Professor Franklin's White Plaza
Speech, February 10.
a. Background and Foreseeable Consequences of
Computation Center Occupation
The fact that potential for major damage within the
Computation Center existed must have been well known
to Professor Franklin. The mechanisms to achieve such
damage were thoroughly identified during the Dinkel
spiel meeting the previous night. Highly publicized
computer occupations leading to extensive damage had
recently occurred at other universities. Testimony in
dicates that the decision not to damage the computer in
the face of eviction by the police was taken by the
demonstrators after the occupation was in force. Pro
fessor Franklin could reasonably expect that an occupa
tion of the Computation Center would involve great
risks to the computer and to the members of the
University community who rely upon it, including the
staff of the Computation Center. It should be empha
sized that the research and education of many people
throughout the University were in jeopardy.
In some respects a computer plays a role in a modern
university not unlike that of a library: it receives,
catalogues, processes and stores information and it
makes it available in various forms as required. To attack
a computation center because some of its information is
considered evil is little different from attacking an entire
library for harboring a few evil books. Professor Franklin
should have known that the occupation of the Computa
tion Center would lead to an agonizing decision by the
University administration whether to request police to
evict the occupiers, thereby ending a costly seizure at
the expense of an increased risk of damage.
The demonstrators showed no serious inclination to
consider the genuine complexities of computer use.
They made minimal inquiry about uses of the computer
—considering only on-line medical use, and not investiga
ting even that use thoroughly. They showed no concern
for the relation of the computer to other problems
involving human welfare. As a consequence of their
action, 700 to 800 jobs were not run that day; no one
knows how many more would have been impaired if the
occupiers had not been evicted. The social cost of
vigilante action in regard to computers or similar
facilities can become very high.
We heard no evidence that demonstrators made any
serious attempt to communicate with responsible of
ficers of the University in order to inquire about the
state of the Gamut-H program, or the ways in which
research policies are administered in regard to computer
use, prior to the forceful occupation of the Center.
Indeed, one of Professor Franklin's witnesses testified
that the Gamut-H program was known to the "move
ment" for a week or two, but a decision was made to
delay its announcement pending a favorable moment for
protest activity. The military action in Laos provided
such an opportunity. If the news of Gamut-H could be
held a week or two in private, why was instant action
suddenly required on February 10? Professor Franklin
and his witnesses agreed that advocacy towards shut
down of the Computation Center proceeded on the basis
of publications and statements of The Inquisition;
shutdown of the Computation Center was certainly not

a last resort measure. Thus, a poorly checked complaint
was made public after a tactical delay and then rapidly
shifted into coercive action with only the most rudi
mentary attempt at negotiating the grievance. Finally, in
view of the expressed rationale for forceful occupation
of the Computation Center, it is noteworthy that the
Gamut-H program was not even mentioned at any point
in the lengthy tape recording of the White Plaza rally.
b. The Speech Itself
Professor Franklin urged the Board to consider his
speeches in their full context. He particularly called our
attention to protests at Stanford, to the events of the
preceding few days, and to the Dinkelspiel rally of
February 9. These have been summarized earlier.
Throughout these turbulent events, a persistent differ
ence of opinion is manifested between those who place
primary emphasis on the University's role in the war and
those who place primary emphasis on the role of the
government. Professor Franklin clearly belongs in the
former category. In a Dinkelspiel speech of February 9th
and the White Plaza speech of February 10th, he is
severely critical of the University's role in fostering the
design and execution of the war. He strongly urges his
listeners to direct their attention to the University,
expressing hostility toward its trustees, administration,
and some student body leaders. He views the University
as centrally culpable in the war, and directs attention
away from the federal government. This characterization
of the University has the effect of justifying strong
protest or retaliation.
Within this framework, the "movement" chose to
focus attention on the Computation Center as a symbol
and instrument of the war. The February 9th rally is full
of angry references to the Computation Center—the
culpability of its users, its vulnerability, its suitability for
attack and possibly even for destruction. Professor
Franklin must have been aware of this danger to the
Computation Center-to its functions, its hardware, and
to the large number of people who rely upon it in their
work. These matters had been discussed extensively at
the February 9th rally in which he was an active
participant. He also took part in an investigatory march
that followed the February 9th rally, a preparation for
the likelihood of disruptive action the following day. He
admits in testimony and argument that he gave strong
support to the correctness of action against the Compu
tation Center before, during, and after its occupation,
specifically including the White Plaza rally.
In the main, the purpose of the White Plaza rally of
February 10th appears to have been: (1) to increase the
numbers available for protest activity; (2) to settle
firmly on a target. In respect to (2) the Computation
Center appeared to be the most likely target as a result
of the February 9th meeting, but the Hoover Institution
was still under consideration; two student leaders advo
cated nondisruptive political activity, but they were
strongly criticized by Professor Franklin and others.
Professor Franklin was a highly respected leader of a
group advocating intense hostility to the University as
well as disdain for nondisruptive modes of protest and
for electoral politics. His White Plaza speech contains an
approving reference to material damage to Stanlord
University, and his testimony on these events provides
repeated justification for such damage. At White Plaza
on February 10th, this orientation was brought sharply
to bear on the Computation Center.
It is uncontested that at the White Plaza rally
Professor Franklin concluded his speech by stating
". . .what we are asking is.. .to begin to shut down the
most obvious machinery of war, such as, and I think it is
a good target, that Computation Center.. ." and that
subsequently the Stanford Computation Center, al
though officially declared closed, was forcefully oc
cupied, resulting in shutdown of operation and minor

damage. It is also uncontested that many of the
occupiers were in the audience of Professor Franklin's
speech.
Professor Franklin has also asserted that a firm
decision to shut down the Computation Center was
already reached on February 9, and that therefore his
speech on February 10 could not have contributed to
the subsequent course of events. The evidence does not
support the assertion. The meeting on February 9th held
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium identified a spectrum of
options for action, and two-action against the Hoover
Institution and against the Computation Center-were
left as leading candidates. The preceding summary of
Dinkelspiel (February 9) and White Pla/.a (February 10)
rallies makes this clear. Moreover, several witnesses (both
for the administration and for Professor Franklin)
testified that specific action against the University was
not settled, or that they were undecided whether to
participate in the Computation Center action until they
attended this rally at which Professor Franklin gave the
final speech.
C. Professor Franklin's Use of the Term "Strike "
The Board has found it helpful to pay special
attention to the context for subsequent events provided
by the Dinkelspiel rally of the night of February 9th.
Both the University Administration and Professor Frank
lin devoted considerable attention to this background. In
that connection, we think it important to note that
Professor Franklin himself placed special emphasis dur
ing the hearing on the importance of that rally for
providing context. For that reason, we find the introduc
tion to his own analysis of that topic in this supplemen
tary written brief (page 106) rather unreasonable. He
says"The administration attempts to prove that the real
meaning of Franklin's speech can be found lurking in
several statements gleaned from the lengthy meeting at
Dinkelspiel." If the Administration did so, it was at
Professor Franklin's own invitation.
Our view of the matter is that Professor Franklin was
right the first time: the Dinkelspiel rally does provide
important insights into the speech that follows. It is
analyzed extensively above, in the section on "Back
ground to Events of February 10, 1972." We here
comment on the view presented by Prolessor Franklin in
his supplementary written brief. The main thrust of his
argument is that the rally was a very general discussion,
organized primarily along the lines of planning a strike;
he says (p. 109) "The reason there were no plans for a
picket sign is that there were no plans for anything
beyond a meeting and a general sort of strike." He also
asserts (p. 107) "There was never a real discussion of the
variety of ways the Computer Center could be shut
down except along the general lines of a strike."
In fact, his account tends to select heavily those
speeches from the Dinkelspiel rally that emphasize the
non-coercive aspects of the kind of "strike" he is talking
about. For example, he ignores the following speech
early in the rally:
And so the only reason that we would attack the
University would be on the grounds of effectiveness,
though I would try to direct the demands toward
specific things in the community and that are
attackable like the Computation Center.. . .
In addition, there are two other early calJs to stop
talking and commence action. Later, Braunstein recom
mends a range of actions, including some that lie well
outside the range of legal actions that is subsumed under
the term "strike" when used in its normal context.
Indeed, the term "strike" clearly has a different
meaning to members of the "movement" at Stanford
than it does in ordinary usage. When preceded by the
modifying words "Cambodia-type," it encompasses a

wide range of actions, including some that are legal and
some that are illegal. The introduction of the concept of
a "mobile strike," which takes place well before the end
of the Dinkelspiel rally, was clearly a modification
introduced by numerical considerations: it was argued
that the number of people was inadequate to close a
number of things simultaneously, but that they might
succeed if targets were attacked seriatim. It is clear that
in all of these uses, the term "strike" encompasses a
wide range of activities. In his supplementary written
brief, Professor Franklin borrows the conventional
meaning from the labor context, and then employs it as
a flag in which to wrap a much broader range of
conduct. All of the speakers who spoke late in the rally,
after they had developed some consensus around the
notion of "mobile strike" and were discussing a target,
used language that clearly involves the expectation of
being confronted by the police, moved out of buildings,
and the like. Persuading workers to leave their jobs,
standing in the doorways to bear "moral witness,"
picketing — these activities get little or no prominence in
the discussion, although Professor Franklin tries to
persuade us that these activities are really the dominant
elements of a "strike." The context so established is not
substantially changed, in our view, by the earlier
speakers at the White Plaza rally.
The words "shut it down" imply a cessation of
function that can sometimes be achieved by a strike,
strictly defined, but may be achieved by other means as
well. From a careful reading of the Dinkelspiel trans
cript, we are persuaded that the context for the White
Plaza rally was one in which the prospective shutting
down of the Computation Center was to be achieved
primarily by means going beyond the range of legal
"strike" tactics. We find Professor Franklin's use of the
term "strike" disingenuous, and we believe that his own
exhortation to "shut down" the Computation Center
was, given that context, an intentional invitation to
employ such extra-legal means as might be necessary.
In summary, could Professor Franklin reasonably
have expected that his speech would have contributed to
the likelihood of the occupation? Professor Franklin
asserts that he was only advocating a legal strike or
voluntary boycott of the Computation Center, or
alternatively that he gave no thoughts at all to the
consequences of his speech. The preceding analysis of
the Dinkelspiel rally makes this a highly dubious
proposition. Although there clearly were discussions of a
"strike" against Stanford University during the rally at
Dinkelspiel and during the early portions of the White
Plaza rally, there is no evidence of preparation for a legal
strike or boycott: no plans for picketing; no direct effort
at persuasion of the workers of the Computation Center
to withhold their labor or for the users of the Center to
boycott the facility. In the present context, the term
"strike" was a kind of euphemism for a broad range of
protest activities, including peaceful, coercive and vio
lent activities. We conclude that Professor Franklin must
reasonably have expected that his advocacy of "shut
down" would be interpreted by at least a substantial
portion of the audience as calling for forceful disruption
of the operation of the Center. Indeed, we believe that
this is what he meant.
CONCLUSION
We conclude that Professor Franklin must reasonably
have expected that his speech at White Plaza on
February 10, 1971, would increase the likelihood of
illegal occupation of the Computation Center immedi
ately following his speech, and that there was risk of
serious damage to the computer and its users. The Board
finds the evidence strongly persuasive that Professor
Franklin urged and incited his audience at White Plaza
towards disruption of University functions and shut
down of the Computation Center. We therefore sustain
charge No. 8.
A. CHARGES
The relevant University charges concerning the White
Plaza incident are contained in Paragraph 8 of the
"Statement of Charges" dated March 22, 1971. This
paragraph reads as follows:
8. On February 10, 1971, beginning at about 12
p.m., a rally was held at White Memorial Plaza to,
among other things, discuss methods of protesting
developments in the war in Indochina. Over tive
humdred students and other persons attended. During
the course of the rally two prinicpal courses of action
were discussed, one being to work in the non-Univer
sity community to bring about changes in govern
ment policy, the other being to disrupt University
functions and business. Professor Franklin intention
ally urged and incited students and other persons
present at the rally to follow the latter course of
action and specifically to shut down a University
computer facility known as the Computation Center.
Shortly thereafter a large number of students and
others left the rally and went to the Computation
Center whereupon many of these persons did in fact
occupy the Computation Center, prevent its opera
tion and obstruct movement in and out of the
building for several hours, terminating this unlawful
activity only when ordered to leave the building by
the police.
B. NATURE OF THE CHARGE
The general charge is that Professor Franklin urged
and incited the disruption of University functions; the
specific charge is that he urged and incited his audience
to shut down a University facility, the Computation
Center. Effectively, this means that his words, including
their delivery and their context, significantly increased
the likelihood of prohibited conduct on the part of his
audience; it means, moreover, that he must have anti
cipated that his speech, given its delivery and context,
would significantly increase the imminent likelihood of
prohibited conduct.
C. FINDINGS OF FACT
/. Prominent Themes in the White Plaza Rally
The noon-hour rally at White Plaza, attended at its
peak by about 700 people, had been proposed the night
before at the conclusion of a rally at Dinkelspiel Audi
torium. Most of the speeches given at the White Plaza
rally were available on tape recordings. Only a portion at
the outset was missing, and this was covered in testi
mony. The following themes emerged prominently in
the course of the White Plaza rally:
a. Many speakers discussed ways of protesting the
war in Southeast Asia. Three speakers, including two
student body leaders, favored an off-cainpus focus of
protest. They were severely criticized by five subsequent
speakers, who characterized liberal war protest in such
terms as "counter-insurgency." This may be illustrated
by the following speech:
Yeah, I'd just like to point out that the only time the
liberals and moderates come out of the woodwork is
when there is radical action on campus. . . .That's the
only way moderates and liberals can, can get off their
asses, is when the people around them are doing these
violent things which you consider to be useless.
b. On four occasions, there was reference to selection
of a protest target on campus; the desirability of alterna
tive possibilities was considered.
c. The Computation Center was referred to often
throughout the meeting. Its suitability as a protest target
was cited. In the final speech of the rally, Professor
Franklin called for shutting down the Computation
Center.
d. Some speakers emphasized Stanford's war com
plicity and the desirability of shutting down the Univer
sity in order to end that complicity.
e. Four speakers made reference to the concept of

different people taking protest action on different levels,
each doing his own thing. Three of these clearly included
coercive and violent behavior within the spectrum of
approved activities, and the fourth is unclear on this
poin<. The following quotations help to clarify this
important theme:
And so closing down Stanford is really a concrete
blow against the war. You see, that's a concrete way
of stopping, stopping things that are going on that
help the war by stopping that kind of research, by
stopping the programs that are run in the computer
center....
It's true that if we're writing letters to congressmen
we're probably not doing that much. But by striking
the University and by taking, by taking whatever
kinds of action we can, you see, on a lot of different
levels, some people may want to take over buildings,
some people will want to boycott class, some people
will want to cause classes to be boycotted, you see
it's not much good if English classes and the French
class aren't going on, but the Business School classes
and the Electronic Engineering classes are going on
and the Department of Defense research contracts are
still being carried out.
KZSU: The crowd is still growing here at White Plaza,
now about 700 people.
[new speaker] What really amazes me is like every
body that's here right now is like obviously against
the war. Now all this friction and all this bullshit
that's going on between radicals and conservatives
and liberals or whoever the fuck it is, it's all just
friction. Now, as long as people who are writing
letters or doing strikes, or breaking windows or what,
everybody's doing their own thing to stop that
fucking war over there. So, everybody do their own
thing, and let's stop that war now and altogether,
[applause]
112. The term "strike" was used several times, though
less than it had been the previous night at the Dinkel
spiel rally. Once again, it seemed to bear little relation to
the meaning of "strike" in labor disputes. Rather, it
seemed to refer to a broad spectrum of activities, some
non-coercive and some coercive. The most prominent
connotation was that of the "mobile strike" introduced
February 9th at Dinkelspiel—closing down one universi
ty facility after another by whatever means proved
feasible.
g. Six speakers made favorable reference to coercive
or violent behavior. This may be illustrated by a
recorded passage from Professor Franklin's speech:
. . .so want to talk about, about high consciousness,
the high consciousness is the consciousness of the
people most oppressed by U.S. imperialism, which
includes as a main institution of that Stanford
University. And that's why whenever people from
that community, whenever poor working class youth
from that community, get a chance to come on the
campus at Stanford and do a little material damage,
they are very eager to do so. Because they recognize
what Stanford University is, even if people here
don't.
2. Summary of Professor Franklin's speech
Professor Franklin gave the closing and longest speech
of the rally. (See Appendix II.) He called for a
willingness to sacrifice in the service of protest activity.
He criticized student body leaders for allegedly subvert
ing the activity of protesters. He gave some of his
personal history in antiwar activity. He cited a poll
indicating that people with little education expressed
more opposition to the war in Southeast Asia than those
with higher levels of education.
At the passage quoted earlier, referring to material
damage by working class youth at Stanford, Professor
Franklin's delivery shifted to a higher intensity, remain

ing at this level until the conclusion. He continued later,
Well, when we talk about, see we're just ripping off
the term strike when talking about striking at
Stanford. This isn't a strike. We're not risking
anything. It's a voluntary boycott—a shutdown of
some of the activities of the University as a demon
stration of something. Now, now what we called a
strike last year, and it lasted really about three days
and it kind of dragged on, and you know, in an odds
and ends way and some people did it. But just the
fact that we were able to move our little finger that
much, that electrified the working people of this
area.. ..
He ended the speech by saying,
See, now what we're asking is for people to make that
little tiny gesture to show that we're willing to
inconvenience ourselves a little bit and to begin to
shut down the most obvious machinery of war, such
as, and I think it is a good target, that Computation
Center, [applause and shouts of "right on. .. ."]
Immediately after Professor Franklin's speech, the
chairman asked for a vote to choose between the
Computation Center and Hoover. About 100 hands
(primarily in front) voted affirmatively on the question
of shutting down the former, whereupon the chairman
announced that a majority favored this course. He said,
"And so I would suggest that we go over there and visit
it." At that point, a voice is heard calling, "Shut it
down," echoing the comment made just before by
Professor Franklin and the meeting's chairman.
As the crowd was leaving they were instructed,
When people go over to the Comp Center, they
should all go in a group and move relatively slowly so
that the group can stay together. Also the meeting at
8 o'clock tonight in the Old Union Courtyard is a
very important meeting because we can decide what
we want to do tomorrow. There are some things that
we can't close down now, but we can close them
down if we get to them early in the morning.
3. Interpretation of the Meaning of Professor Frank
lin 's White Plaza Speech
a. Professor Franklin's Own Interpretation
There were several differing points of view regarding
the meaning of the speech given by Professor Franklin.
Professor Franklin himself in an affidavit dated February
24, 1971 described the meaning of his speech:
Actually, in order to understand either the content of
my speech or that of the rally itself, it is necessary to
see it in relation to the events of the previous evening.
The debate was essentially over the same issues, that
is, whether to focus off campus or call for a strike on
campus, and whether a strike could be effective.
Much of the debate was repetitious of the previous
night, but since most of the people at that meeting
felt bound by the vote, those who had wanted to stop
the munition train did not make their proposal. The
main spokesmen for off-campus work were Bob
Grant and Larry Diamond, who proposed doing
precinct work to elect so-called peace candidates. It
was my belief that these two were not being honest,
and that their main purpose was to prevent any
effective action and to advance their own political
careers. It was with this in mind, plus a sense that
many people were becoming very impatient with the
idle debate of the rally, that I rose to speak. My
intention was, as it had been the previous night, to
build the anti-war movement on the campus. ...
He concluded this portion of the affidavit:
Let's move our little finger again and begin to pick up
where we left off with our strike last spring. Let's
begin to shut down the machinery of war. I think
that the suggested target of the computer center is as
good a place to begin as any. So the content of the
entire speech was to strike against the invasion ol
Laos. In making this speech, and the one on the
preceding night, I thought that I was operating
entirely within the precedent established during the
invasion of Cambodia when the overwhelming majori
ty of the faculty and students of the majority of
departments and schools of the University voted to
go on strike. For instance, my own department on
May 4, 1970 voted overwhelmingly in favor of a
strike for an indefinite period, demanding: 1. An
immediate withdrawal ol all American forces from
Southeast Asia; 2. The end of political repression at
home, in particular the government's systematic
attempt to eliminate the Black Panther and other
political dissidents; 3. The removal of KOTC from
the Stanford campus by the end of the academic
quarter; 4. An end to all war-related and secret
research on the Stanford campus by the end of the
quarter.
In the hearing, he described the meaning of his speech
in essentially similar terms.
b. Hearing Witnesses' Interpretation
University Administration witnesses testified that the
crowd was moved by Professor Franklin's speech and
that he served as a catalyst to get the group moving in
the direction of the Computation Center. One of
Professor Franklin's witnesses felt that the Computation
Center was an appropriate target. He said that a
"shutdown" of the University could range from "blast
various parts of it from the face of Santa Clara County"
to taking over a building as had occurred at Lncina Hall
the year before. One of liis witnesses testified that
Professor Franklin was trying to bring factions together
but didn't influence tactics already decided; two felt the
decision to go to the Computation Center had been
arrived at the night before and the purpose of the speech
was to support a Cambodia-type strike; two thought
Professor Franklin's speech was just educational; two
thought that he was not as influential as a middle-aged
salesman who had spoken earlier; one felt that the
purpose of the White Plaza rally was to choose a target
and to recruit more people.
4. Summary of Principal Points oj Defense
Several prominent elements recurred in defense testi
mony and argument on the White Plaza speech:
(a) A widespread inclination to shut down the
Computation Center, and to carry out a variety of
disruptive activities, was formed over the preceding
several days. It was justified in terms of Stanford's
complicity in the war and the Gamut-H program at
the Computation Center. It was consistent with
long-standing antipathy to the war in Asia and to
Stanford's allegedly vital role in the war. It was
exacerbated by the current news of military action in
Laos.
(b) Such an inclination toward disruptive activity in
general, and toward the Computation Center in
particular, was widespread in and around the Univer
sity, especially in the "movement." The persons
inclined to these actions would have carried them out
regardless of any role Professor Franklin might have
had in encouraging, fostering or facilitating them.
(c) Professor Franklin's speech had little effect on
those present. It was political, analytical, and educa
tional, rather than tactical. It presented no danger to
persons or property.
(d) He was simply advocating a voluntary boycott or
legal strike at the Computation Center. Even if his
speech could be construed as advocating disruption of
the Computation Center, he had in mind no seriously
adverse consequences-only a vigorous mode of pro
test of the war and the University's role in it.
5. Analysis of Professor Franklin's White Plaza
Speech, February 10.
a. Background and Foreseeable Consequences of
Computation Center Occupation
The fact that potential for major damage within the
Computation Center existed must have been well known
to Professor Franklin. The mechanisms to achieve such
damage were thoroughly identified during the Dinkel
spiel meeting the previous night. Highly publicized
computer occupations leading to extensive damage had
recently occurred at other universities. Testimony in
dicates that the decision not to damage the computer in
the face of eviction by the police was taken by the
demonstrators after the occupation was in force. Pro
fessor Franklin could reasonably expect that an occupa
tion of the Computation Center would involve great
risks to the computer and to the members of the
University community who rely upon it, including the
staff of the Computation Center. It should be empha
sized that the research and education of many people
throughout the University were in jeopardy.
In some respects a computer plays a role in a modern
university not unlike that of a library: it receives,
catalogues, processes and stores information and it
makes it available in various forms as required. To attack
a computation center because some of its information is
considered evil is little different from attacking an entire
library for harboring a few evil books. Professor Franklin
should have known that the occupation of the Computa
tion Center would lead to an agonizing decision by the
University administration whether to request police to
evict the occupiers, thereby ending a costly seizure at
the expense of an increased risk of damage.
The demonstrators showed no serious inclination to
consider the genuine complexities of computer use.
They made minimal inquiry about uses of the computer
—considering only on-line medical use, and not investiga
ting even that use thoroughly. They showed no concern
for the relation of the computer to other problems
involving human welfare. As a consequence of their
action, 700 to 800 jobs were not run that day; no one
knows how many more would have been impaired if the
occupiers had not been evicted. The social cost of
vigilante action in regard to computers or similar
facilities can become very high.
We heard no evidence that demonstrators made any
serious attempt to communicate with responsible of
ficers of the University in order to inquire about the
state of the Gamut-H program, or the ways in which
research policies are administered in regard to computer
use, prior to the forceful occupation of the Center.
Indeed, one of Professor Franklin's witnesses testified
that the Gamut-H program was known to the "move
ment" for a week or two, but a decision was made to
delay its announcement pending a favorable moment for
protest activity. The military action in Laos provided
such an opportunity. If the news of Gamut-H could be
held a week or two in private, why was instant action
suddenly required on February 10? Professor Franklin
and his witnesses agreed that advocacy towards shut
down of the Computation Center proceeded on the basis
of publications and statements of The Inquisition;
shutdown of the Computation Center was certainly not

a last resort measure. Thus, a poorly checked complaint
was made public after a tactical delay and then rapidly
shifted into coercive action with only the most rudi
mentary attempt at negotiating the grievance. Finally, in
view of the expressed rationale for forceful occupation
of the Computation Center, it is noteworthy that the
Gamut-H program was not even mentioned at any point
in the lengthy tape recording of the White Plaza rally.
b. The Speech Itself
Professor Franklin urged the Board to consider his
speeches in their full context. He particularly called our
attention to protests at Stanford, to the events of the
preceding few days, and to the Dinkelspiel rally of
February 9. These have been summarized earlier.
Throughout these turbulent events, a persistent differ
ence of opinion is manifested between those who place
primary emphasis on the University's role in the war and
those who place primary emphasis on the role of the
government. Professor Franklin clearly belongs in the
former category. In a Dinkelspiel speech of February 9th
and the White Plaza speech of February 10th, he is
severely critical of the University's role in fostering the
design and execution of the war. He strongly urges his
listeners to direct their attention to the University,
expressing hostility toward its trustees, administration,
and some student body leaders. He views the University
as centrally culpable in the war, and directs attention
away from the federal government. This characterization
of the University has the effect of justifying strong
protest or retaliation.
Within this framework, the "movement" chose to
focus attention on the Computation Center as a symbol
and instrument of the war. The February 9th rally is full
of angry references to the Computation Center—the
culpability of its users, its vulnerability, its suitability for
attack and possibly even for destruction. Professor
Franklin must have been aware of this danger to the
Computation Center-to its functions, its hardware, and
to the large number of people who rely upon it in their
work. These matters had been discussed extensively at
the February 9th rally in which he was an active
participant. He also took part in an investigatory march
that followed the February 9th rally, a preparation for
the likelihood of disruptive action the following day. He
admits in testimony and argument that he gave strong
support to the correctness of action against the Compu
tation Center before, during, and after its occupation,
specifically including the White Plaza rally.
In the main, the purpose of the White Plaza rally of
February 10th appears to have been: (1) to increase the
numbers available for protest activity; (2) to settle
firmly on a target. In respect to (2) the Computation
Center appeared to be the most likely target as a result
of the February 9th meeting, but the Hoover Institution
was still under consideration; two student leaders advo
cated nondisruptive political activity, but they were
strongly criticized by Professor Franklin and others.
Professor Franklin was a highly respected leader of a
group advocating intense hostility to the University as
well as disdain for nondisruptive modes of protest and
for electoral politics. His White Plaza speech contains an
approving reference to material damage to Stanlord
University, and his testimony on these events provides
repeated justification for such damage. At White Plaza
on February 10th, this orientation was brought sharply
to bear on the Computation Center.
It is uncontested that at the White Plaza rally
Professor Franklin concluded his speech by stating
". . .what we are asking is.. .to begin to shut down the
most obvious machinery of war, such as, and I think it is
a good target, that Computation Center.. ." and that
subsequently the Stanford Computation Center, al
though officially declared closed, was forcefully oc
cupied, resulting in shutdown of operation and minor

damage. It is also uncontested that many of the
occupiers were in the audience of Professor Franklin's
speech.
Professor Franklin has also asserted that a firm
decision to shut down the Computation Center was
already reached on February 9, and that therefore his
speech on February 10 could not have contributed to
the subsequent course of events. The evidence does not
support the assertion. The meeting on February 9th held
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium identified a spectrum of
options for action, and two-action against the Hoover
Institution and against the Computation Center-were
left as leading candidates. The preceding summary of
Dinkelspiel (February 9) and White Pla/.a (February 10)
rallies makes this clear. Moreover, several witnesses (both
for the administration and for Professor Franklin)
testified that specific action against the University was
not settled, or that they were undecided whether to
participate in the Computation Center action until they
attended this rally at which Professor Franklin gave the
final speech.
C. Professor Franklin's Use of the Term "Strike "
The Board has found it helpful to pay special
attention to the context for subsequent events provided
by the Dinkelspiel rally of the night of February 9th.
Both the University Administration and Professor Frank
lin devoted considerable attention to this background. In
that connection, we think it important to note that
Professor Franklin himself placed special emphasis dur
ing the hearing on the importance of that rally for
providing context. For that reason, we find the introduc
tion to his own analysis of that topic in this supplemen
tary written brief (page 106) rather unreasonable. He
says"The administration attempts to prove that the real
meaning of Franklin's speech can be found lurking in
several statements gleaned from the lengthy meeting at
Dinkelspiel." If the Administration did so, it was at
Professor Franklin's own invitation.
Our view of the matter is that Professor Franklin was
right the first time: the Dinkelspiel rally does provide
important insights into the speech that follows. It is
analyzed extensively above, in the section on "Back
ground to Events of February 10, 1972." We here
comment on the view presented by Prolessor Franklin in
his supplementary written brief. The main thrust of his
argument is that the rally was a very general discussion,
organized primarily along the lines of planning a strike;
he says (p. 109) "The reason there were no plans for a
picket sign is that there were no plans for anything
beyond a meeting and a general sort of strike." He also
asserts (p. 107) "There was never a real discussion of the
variety of ways the Computer Center could be shut
down except along the general lines of a strike."
In fact, his account tends to select heavily those
speeches from the Dinkelspiel rally that emphasize the
non-coercive aspects of the kind of "strike" he is talking
about. For example, he ignores the following speech
early in the rally:
And so the only reason that we would attack the
University would be on the grounds of effectiveness,
though I would try to direct the demands toward
specific things in the community and that are
attackable like the Computation Center.. . .
In addition, there are two other early calJs to stop
talking and commence action. Later, Braunstein recom
mends a range of actions, including some that lie well
outside the range of legal actions that is subsumed under
the term "strike" when used in its normal context.
Indeed, the term "strike" clearly has a different
meaning to members of the "movement" at Stanford
than it does in ordinary usage. When preceded by the
modifying words "Cambodia-type," it encompasses a

wide range of actions, including some that are legal and
some that are illegal. The introduction of the concept of
a "mobile strike," which takes place well before the end
of the Dinkelspiel rally, was clearly a modification
introduced by numerical considerations: it was argued
that the number of people was inadequate to close a
number of things simultaneously, but that they might
succeed if targets were attacked seriatim. It is clear that
in all of these uses, the term "strike" encompasses a
wide range of activities. In his supplementary written
brief, Professor Franklin borrows the conventional
meaning from the labor context, and then employs it as
a flag in which to wrap a much broader range of
conduct. All of the speakers who spoke late in the rally,
after they had developed some consensus around the
notion of "mobile strike" and were discussing a target,
used language that clearly involves the expectation of
being confronted by the police, moved out of buildings,
and the like. Persuading workers to leave their jobs,
standing in the doorways to bear "moral witness,"
picketing — these activities get little or no prominence in
the discussion, although Professor Franklin tries to
persuade us that these activities are really the dominant
elements of a "strike." The context so established is not
substantially changed, in our view, by the earlier
speakers at the White Plaza rally.
The words "shut it down" imply a cessation of
function that can sometimes be achieved by a strike,
strictly defined, but may be achieved by other means as
well. From a careful reading of the Dinkelspiel trans
cript, we are persuaded that the context for the White
Plaza rally was one in which the prospective shutting
down of the Computation Center was to be achieved
primarily by means going beyond the range of legal
"strike" tactics. We find Professor Franklin's use of the
term "strike" disingenuous, and we believe that his own
exhortation to "shut down" the Computation Center
was, given that context, an intentional invitation to
employ such extra-legal means as might be necessary.
In summary, could Professor Franklin reasonably
have expected that his speech would have contributed to
the likelihood of the occupation? Professor Franklin
asserts that he was only advocating a legal strike or
voluntary boycott of the Computation Center, or
alternatively that he gave no thoughts at all to the
consequences of his speech. The preceding analysis of
the Dinkelspiel rally makes this a highly dubious
proposition. Although there clearly were discussions of a
"strike" against Stanford University during the rally at
Dinkelspiel and during the early portions of the White
Plaza rally, there is no evidence of preparation for a legal
strike or boycott: no plans for picketing; no direct effort
at persuasion of the workers of the Computation Center
to withhold their labor or for the users of the Center to
boycott the facility. In the present context, the term
"strike" was a kind of euphemism for a broad range of
protest activities, including peaceful, coercive and vio
lent activities. We conclude that Professor Franklin must
reasonably have expected that his advocacy of "shut
down" would be interpreted by at least a substantial
portion of the audience as calling for forceful disruption
of the operation of the Center. Indeed, we believe that
this is what he meant.
CONCLUSION
We conclude that Professor Franklin must reasonably
have expected that his speech at White Plaza on
February 10, 1971, would increase the likelihood of
illegal occupation of the Computation Center immedi
ately following his speech, and that there was risk of
serious damage to the computer and its users. The Board
finds the evidence strongly persuasive that Professor
Franklin urged and incited his audience at White Plaza
towards disruption of University functions and shut
down of the Computation Center. We therefore sustain
charge No. 8.
A. CHARGES
The relevant University charges concerning the White
Plaza incident are contained in Paragraph 8 of the
"Statement of Charges" dated March 22, 1971. This
paragraph reads as follows:
8. On February 10, 1971, beginning at about 12
p.m., a rally was held at White Memorial Plaza to,
among other things, discuss methods of protesting
developments in the war in Indochina. Over tive
humdred students and other persons attended. During
the course of the rally two prinicpal courses of action
were discussed, one being to work in the non-Univer
sity community to bring about changes in govern
ment policy, the other being to disrupt University
functions and business. Professor Franklin intention
ally urged and incited students and other persons
present at the rally to follow the latter course of
action and specifically to shut down a University
computer facility known as the Computation Center.
Shortly thereafter a large number of students and
others left the rally and went to the Computation
Center whereupon many of these persons did in fact
occupy the Computation Center, prevent its opera
tion and obstruct movement in and out of the
building for several hours, terminating this unlawful
activity only when ordered to leave the building by
the police.
B. NATURE OF THE CHARGE
The general charge is that Professor Franklin urged
and incited the disruption of University functions; the
specific charge is that he urged and incited his audience
to shut down a University facility, the Computation
Center. Effectively, this means that his words, including
their delivery and their context, significantly increased
the likelihood of prohibited conduct on the part of his
audience; it means, moreover, that he must have anti
cipated that his speech, given its delivery and context,
would significantly increase the imminent likelihood of
prohibited conduct.
C. FINDINGS OF FACT
/. Prominent Themes in the White Plaza Rally
The noon-hour rally at White Plaza, attended at its
peak by about 700 people, had been proposed the night
before at the conclusion of a rally at Dinkelspiel Audi
torium. Most of the speeches given at the White Plaza
rally were available on tape recordings. Only a portion at
the outset was missing, and this was covered in testi
mony. The following themes emerged prominently in
the course of the White Plaza rally:
a. Many speakers discussed ways of protesting the
war in Southeast Asia. Three speakers, including two
student body leaders, favored an off-cainpus focus of
protest. They were severely criticized by five subsequent
speakers, who characterized liberal war protest in such
terms as "counter-insurgency." This may be illustrated
by the following speech:
Yeah, I'd just like to point out that the only time the
liberals and moderates come out of the woodwork is
when there is radical action on campus. . . .That's the
only way moderates and liberals can, can get off their
asses, is when the people around them are doing these
violent things which you consider to be useless.
b. On four occasions, there was reference to selection
of a protest target on campus; the desirability of alterna
tive possibilities was considered.
c. The Computation Center was referred to often
throughout the meeting. Its suitability as a protest target
was cited. In the final speech of the rally, Professor
Franklin called for shutting down the Computation
Center.
d. Some speakers emphasized Stanford's war com
plicity and the desirability of shutting down the Univer
sity in order to end that complicity.
e. Four speakers made reference to the concept of

different people taking protest action on different levels,
each doing his own thing. Three of these clearly included
coercive and violent behavior within the spectrum of
approved activities, and the fourth is unclear on this
poin<. The following quotations help to clarify this
important theme:
And so closing down Stanford is really a concrete
blow against the war. You see, that's a concrete way
of stopping, stopping things that are going on that
help the war by stopping that kind of research, by
stopping the programs that are run in the computer
center....
It's true that if we're writing letters to congressmen
we're probably not doing that much. But by striking
the University and by taking, by taking whatever
kinds of action we can, you see, on a lot of different
levels, some people may want to take over buildings,
some people will want to boycott class, some people
will want to cause classes to be boycotted, you see
it's not much good if English classes and the French
class aren't going on, but the Business School classes
and the Electronic Engineering classes are going on
and the Department of Defense research contracts are
still being carried out.
KZSU: The crowd is still growing here at White Plaza,
now about 700 people.
[new speaker] What really amazes me is like every
body that's here right now is like obviously against
the war. Now all this friction and all this bullshit
that's going on between radicals and conservatives
and liberals or whoever the fuck it is, it's all just
friction. Now, as long as people who are writing
letters or doing strikes, or breaking windows or what,
everybody's doing their own thing to stop that
fucking war over there. So, everybody do their own
thing, and let's stop that war now and altogether,
[applause]
112. The term "strike" was used several times, though
less than it had been the previous night at the Dinkel
spiel rally. Once again, it seemed to bear little relation to
the meaning of "strike" in labor disputes. Rather, it
seemed to refer to a broad spectrum of activities, some
non-coercive and some coercive. The most prominent
connotation was that of the "mobile strike" introduced
February 9th at Dinkelspiel—closing down one universi
ty facility after another by whatever means proved
feasible.
g. Six speakers made favorable reference to coercive
or violent behavior. This may be illustrated by a
recorded passage from Professor Franklin's speech:
. . .so want to talk about, about high consciousness,
the high consciousness is the consciousness of the
people most oppressed by U.S. imperialism, which
includes as a main institution of that Stanford
University. And that's why whenever people from
that community, whenever poor working class youth
from that community, get a chance to come on the
campus at Stanford and do a little material damage,
they are very eager to do so. Because they recognize
what Stanford University is, even if people here
don't.
2. Summary of Professor Franklin's speech
Professor Franklin gave the closing and longest speech
of the rally. (See Appendix II.) He called for a
willingness to sacrifice in the service of protest activity.
He criticized student body leaders for allegedly subvert
ing the activity of protesters. He gave some of his
personal history in antiwar activity. He cited a poll
indicating that people with little education expressed
more opposition to the war in Southeast Asia than those
with higher levels of education.
At the passage quoted earlier, referring to material
damage by working class youth at Stanford, Professor
Franklin's delivery shifted to a higher intensity, remain

ing at this level until the conclusion. He continued later,
Well, when we talk about, see we're just ripping off
the term strike when talking about striking at
Stanford. This isn't a strike. We're not risking
anything. It's a voluntary boycott—a shutdown of
some of the activities of the University as a demon
stration of something. Now, now what we called a
strike last year, and it lasted really about three days
and it kind of dragged on, and you know, in an odds
and ends way and some people did it. But just the
fact that we were able to move our little finger that
much, that electrified the working people of this
area.. ..
He ended the speech by saying,
See, now what we're asking is for people to make that
little tiny gesture to show that we're willing to
inconvenience ourselves a little bit and to begin to
shut down the most obvious machinery of war, such
as, and I think it is a good target, that Computation
Center, [applause and shouts of "right on. .. ."]
Immediately after Professor Franklin's speech, the
chairman asked for a vote to choose between the
Computation Center and Hoover. About 100 hands
(primarily in front) voted affirmatively on the question
of shutting down the former, whereupon the chairman
announced that a majority favored this course. He said,
"And so I would suggest that we go over there and visit
it." At that point, a voice is heard calling, "Shut it
down," echoing the comment made just before by
Professor Franklin and the meeting's chairman.
As the crowd was leaving they were instructed,
When people go over to the Comp Center, they
should all go in a group and move relatively slowly so
that the group can stay together. Also the meeting at
8 o'clock tonight in the Old Union Courtyard is a
very important meeting because we can decide what
we want to do tomorrow. There are some things that
we can't close down now, but we can close them
down if we get to them early in the morning.
3. Interpretation of the Meaning of Professor Frank
lin 's White Plaza Speech
a. Professor Franklin's Own Interpretation
There were several differing points of view regarding
the meaning of the speech given by Professor Franklin.
Professor Franklin himself in an affidavit dated February
24, 1971 described the meaning of his speech:
Actually, in order to understand either the content of
my speech or that of the rally itself, it is necessary to
see it in relation to the events of the previous evening.
The debate was essentially over the same issues, that
is, whether to focus off campus or call for a strike on
campus, and whether a strike could be effective.
Much of the debate was repetitious of the previous
night, but since most of the people at that meeting
felt bound by the vote, those who had wanted to stop
the munition train did not make their proposal. The
main spokesmen for off-campus work were Bob
Grant and Larry Diamond, who proposed doing
precinct work to elect so-called peace candidates. It
was my belief that these two were not being honest,
and that their main purpose was to prevent any
effective action and to advance their own political
careers. It was with this in mind, plus a sense that
many people were becoming very impatient with the
idle debate of the rally, that I rose to speak. My
intention was, as it had been the previous night, to
build the anti-war movement on the campus. ...
He concluded this portion of the affidavit:
Let's move our little finger again and begin to pick up
where we left off with our strike last spring. Let's
begin to shut down the machinery of war. I think
that the suggested target of the computer center is as
good a place to begin as any. So the content of the
entire speech was to strike against the invasion ol
Laos. In making this speech, and the one on the
preceding night, I thought that I was operating
entirely within the precedent established during the
invasion of Cambodia when the overwhelming majori
ty of the faculty and students of the majority of
departments and schools of the University voted to
go on strike. For instance, my own department on
May 4, 1970 voted overwhelmingly in favor of a
strike for an indefinite period, demanding: 1. An
immediate withdrawal ol all American forces from
Southeast Asia; 2. The end of political repression at
home, in particular the government's systematic
attempt to eliminate the Black Panther and other
political dissidents; 3. The removal of KOTC from
the Stanford campus by the end of the academic
quarter; 4. An end to all war-related and secret
research on the Stanford campus by the end of the
quarter.
In the hearing, he described the meaning of his speech
in essentially similar terms.
b. Hearing Witnesses' Interpretation
University Administration witnesses testified that the
crowd was moved by Professor Franklin's speech and
that he served as a catalyst to get the group moving in
the direction of the Computation Center. One of
Professor Franklin's witnesses felt that the Computation
Center was an appropriate target. He said that a
"shutdown" of the University could range from "blast
various parts of it from the face of Santa Clara County"
to taking over a building as had occurred at Lncina Hall
the year before. One of liis witnesses testified that
Professor Franklin was trying to bring factions together
but didn't influence tactics already decided; two felt the
decision to go to the Computation Center had been
arrived at the night before and the purpose of the speech
was to support a Cambodia-type strike; two thought
Professor Franklin's speech was just educational; two
thought that he was not as influential as a middle-aged
salesman who had spoken earlier; one felt that the
purpose of the White Plaza rally was to choose a target
and to recruit more people.
4. Summary of Principal Points oj Defense
Several prominent elements recurred in defense testi
mony and argument on the White Plaza speech:
(a) A widespread inclination to shut down the
Computation Center, and to carry out a variety of
disruptive activities, was formed over the preceding
several days. It was justified in terms of Stanford's
complicity in the war and the Gamut-H program at
the Computation Center. It was consistent with
long-standing antipathy to the war in Asia and to
Stanford's allegedly vital role in the war. It was
exacerbated by the current news of military action in
Laos.
(b) Such an inclination toward disruptive activity in
general, and toward the Computation Center in
particular, was widespread in and around the Univer
sity, especially in the "movement." The persons
inclined to these actions would have carried them out
regardless of any role Professor Franklin might have
had in encouraging, fostering or facilitating them.
(c) Professor Franklin's speech had little effect on
those present. It was political, analytical, and educa
tional, rather than tactical. It presented no danger to
persons or property.
(d) He was simply advocating a voluntary boycott or
legal strike at the Computation Center. Even if his
speech could be construed as advocating disruption of
the Computation Center, he had in mind no seriously
adverse consequences-only a vigorous mode of pro
test of the war and the University's role in it.
5. Analysis of Professor Franklin's White Plaza
Speech, February 10.
a. Background and Foreseeable Consequences of
Computation Center Occupation
The fact that potential for major damage within the
Computation Center existed must have been well known
to Professor Franklin. The mechanisms to achieve such
damage were thoroughly identified during the Dinkel
spiel meeting the previous night. Highly publicized
computer occupations leading to extensive damage had
recently occurred at other universities. Testimony in
dicates that the decision not to damage the computer in
the face of eviction by the police was taken by the
demonstrators after the occupation was in force. Pro
fessor Franklin could reasonably expect that an occupa
tion of the Computation Center would involve great
risks to the computer and to the members of the
University community who rely upon it, including the
staff of the Computation Center. It should be empha
sized that the research and education of many people
throughout the University were in jeopardy.
In some respects a computer plays a role in a modern
university not unlike that of a library: it receives,
catalogues, processes and stores information and it
makes it available in various forms as required. To attack
a computation center because some of its information is
considered evil is little different from attacking an entire
library for harboring a few evil books. Professor Franklin
should have known that the occupation of the Computa
tion Center would lead to an agonizing decision by the
University administration whether to request police to
evict the occupiers, thereby ending a costly seizure at
the expense of an increased risk of damage.
The demonstrators showed no serious inclination to
consider the genuine complexities of computer use.
They made minimal inquiry about uses of the computer
—considering only on-line medical use, and not investiga
ting even that use thoroughly. They showed no concern
for the relation of the computer to other problems
involving human welfare. As a consequence of their
action, 700 to 800 jobs were not run that day; no one
knows how many more would have been impaired if the
occupiers had not been evicted. The social cost of
vigilante action in regard to computers or similar
facilities can become very high.
We heard no evidence that demonstrators made any
serious attempt to communicate with responsible of
ficers of the University in order to inquire about the
state of the Gamut-H program, or the ways in which
research policies are administered in regard to computer
use, prior to the forceful occupation of the Center.
Indeed, one of Professor Franklin's witnesses testified
that the Gamut-H program was known to the "move
ment" for a week or two, but a decision was made to
delay its announcement pending a favorable moment for
protest activity. The military action in Laos provided
such an opportunity. If the news of Gamut-H could be
held a week or two in private, why was instant action
suddenly required on February 10? Professor Franklin
and his witnesses agreed that advocacy towards shut
down of the Computation Center proceeded on the basis
of publications and statements of The Inquisition;
shutdown of the Computation Center was certainly not

a last resort measure. Thus, a poorly checked complaint
was made public after a tactical delay and then rapidly
shifted into coercive action with only the most rudi
mentary attempt at negotiating the grievance. Finally, in
view of the expressed rationale for forceful occupation
of the Computation Center, it is noteworthy that the
Gamut-H program was not even mentioned at any point
in the lengthy tape recording of the White Plaza rally.
b. The Speech Itself
Professor Franklin urged the Board to consider his
speeches in their full context. He particularly called our
attention to protests at Stanford, to the events of the
preceding few days, and to the Dinkelspiel rally of
February 9. These have been summarized earlier.
Throughout these turbulent events, a persistent differ
ence of opinion is manifested between those who place
primary emphasis on the University's role in the war and
those who place primary emphasis on the role of the
government. Professor Franklin clearly belongs in the
former category. In a Dinkelspiel speech of February 9th
and the White Plaza speech of February 10th, he is
severely critical of the University's role in fostering the
design and execution of the war. He strongly urges his
listeners to direct their attention to the University,
expressing hostility toward its trustees, administration,
and some student body leaders. He views the University
as centrally culpable in the war, and directs attention
away from the federal government. This characterization
of the University has the effect of justifying strong
protest or retaliation.
Within this framework, the "movement" chose to
focus attention on the Computation Center as a symbol
and instrument of the war. The February 9th rally is full
of angry references to the Computation Center—the
culpability of its users, its vulnerability, its suitability for
attack and possibly even for destruction. Professor
Franklin must have been aware of this danger to the
Computation Center-to its functions, its hardware, and
to the large number of people who rely upon it in their
work. These matters had been discussed extensively at
the February 9th rally in which he was an active
participant. He also took part in an investigatory march
that followed the February 9th rally, a preparation for
the likelihood of disruptive action the following day. He
admits in testimony and argument that he gave strong
support to the correctness of action against the Compu
tation Center before, during, and after its occupation,
specifically including the White Plaza rally.
In the main, the purpose of the White Plaza rally of
February 10th appears to have been: (1) to increase the
numbers available for protest activity; (2) to settle
firmly on a target. In respect to (2) the Computation
Center appeared to be the most likely target as a result
of the February 9th meeting, but the Hoover Institution
was still under consideration; two student leaders advo
cated nondisruptive political activity, but they were
strongly criticized by Professor Franklin and others.
Professor Franklin was a highly respected leader of a
group advocating intense hostility to the University as
well as disdain for nondisruptive modes of protest and
for electoral politics. His White Plaza speech contains an
approving reference to material damage to Stanlord
University, and his testimony on these events provides
repeated justification for such damage. At White Plaza
on February 10th, this orientation was brought sharply
to bear on the Computation Center.
It is uncontested that at the White Plaza rally
Professor Franklin concluded his speech by stating
". . .what we are asking is.. .to begin to shut down the
most obvious machinery of war, such as, and I think it is
a good target, that Computation Center.. ." and that
subsequently the Stanford Computation Center, al
though officially declared closed, was forcefully oc
cupied, resulting in shutdown of operation and minor

damage. It is also uncontested that many of the
occupiers were in the audience of Professor Franklin's
speech.
Professor Franklin has also asserted that a firm
decision to shut down the Computation Center was
already reached on February 9, and that therefore his
speech on February 10 could not have contributed to
the subsequent course of events. The evidence does not
support the assertion. The meeting on February 9th held
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium identified a spectrum of
options for action, and two-action against the Hoover
Institution and against the Computation Center-were
left as leading candidates. The preceding summary of
Dinkelspiel (February 9) and White Pla/.a (February 10)
rallies makes this clear. Moreover, several witnesses (both
for the administration and for Professor Franklin)
testified that specific action against the University was
not settled, or that they were undecided whether to
participate in the Computation Center action until they
attended this rally at which Professor Franklin gave the
final speech.
C. Professor Franklin's Use of the Term "Strike "
The Board has found it helpful to pay special
attention to the context for subsequent events provided
by the Dinkelspiel rally of the night of February 9th.
Both the University Administration and Professor Frank
lin devoted considerable attention to this background. In
that connection, we think it important to note that
Professor Franklin himself placed special emphasis dur
ing the hearing on the importance of that rally for
providing context. For that reason, we find the introduc
tion to his own analysis of that topic in this supplemen
tary written brief (page 106) rather unreasonable. He
says"The administration attempts to prove that the real
meaning of Franklin's speech can be found lurking in
several statements gleaned from the lengthy meeting at
Dinkelspiel." If the Administration did so, it was at
Professor Franklin's own invitation.
Our view of the matter is that Professor Franklin was
right the first time: the Dinkelspiel rally does provide
important insights into the speech that follows. It is
analyzed extensively above, in the section on "Back
ground to Events of February 10, 1972." We here
comment on the view presented by Prolessor Franklin in
his supplementary written brief. The main thrust of his
argument is that the rally was a very general discussion,
organized primarily along the lines of planning a strike;
he says (p. 109) "The reason there were no plans for a
picket sign is that there were no plans for anything
beyond a meeting and a general sort of strike." He also
asserts (p. 107) "There was never a real discussion of the
variety of ways the Computer Center could be shut
down except along the general lines of a strike."
In fact, his account tends to select heavily those
speeches from the Dinkelspiel rally that emphasize the
non-coercive aspects of the kind of "strike" he is talking
about. For example, he ignores the following speech
early in the rally:
And so the only reason that we would attack the
University would be on the grounds of effectiveness,
though I would try to direct the demands toward
specific things in the community and that are
attackable like the Computation Center.. . .
In addition, there are two other early calJs to stop
talking and commence action. Later, Braunstein recom
mends a range of actions, including some that lie well
outside the range of legal actions that is subsumed under
the term "strike" when used in its normal context.
Indeed, the term "strike" clearly has a different
meaning to members of the "movement" at Stanford
than it does in ordinary usage. When preceded by the
modifying words "Cambodia-type," it encompasses a

wide range of actions, including some that are legal and
some that are illegal. The introduction of the concept of
a "mobile strike," which takes place well before the end
of the Dinkelspiel rally, was clearly a modification
introduced by numerical considerations: it was argued
that the number of people was inadequate to close a
number of things simultaneously, but that they might
succeed if targets were attacked seriatim. It is clear that
in all of these uses, the term "strike" encompasses a
wide range of activities. In his supplementary written
brief, Professor Franklin borrows the conventional
meaning from the labor context, and then employs it as
a flag in which to wrap a much broader range of
conduct. All of the speakers who spoke late in the rally,
after they had developed some consensus around the
notion of "mobile strike" and were discussing a target,
used language that clearly involves the expectation of
being confronted by the police, moved out of buildings,
and the like. Persuading workers to leave their jobs,
standing in the doorways to bear "moral witness,"
picketing — these activities get little or no prominence in
the discussion, although Professor Franklin tries to
persuade us that these activities are really the dominant
elements of a "strike." The context so established is not
substantially changed, in our view, by the earlier
speakers at the White Plaza rally.
The words "shut it down" imply a cessation of
function that can sometimes be achieved by a strike,
strictly defined, but may be achieved by other means as
well. From a careful reading of the Dinkelspiel trans
cript, we are persuaded that the context for the White
Plaza rally was one in which the prospective shutting
down of the Computation Center was to be achieved
primarily by means going beyond the range of legal
"strike" tactics. We find Professor Franklin's use of the
term "strike" disingenuous, and we believe that his own
exhortation to "shut down" the Computation Center
was, given that context, an intentional invitation to
employ such extra-legal means as might be necessary.
In summary, could Professor Franklin reasonably
have expected that his speech would have contributed to
the likelihood of the occupation? Professor Franklin
asserts that he was only advocating a legal strike or
voluntary boycott of the Computation Center, or
alternatively that he gave no thoughts at all to the
consequences of his speech. The preceding analysis of
the Dinkelspiel rally makes this a highly dubious
proposition. Although there clearly were discussions of a
"strike" against Stanford University during the rally at
Dinkelspiel and during the early portions of the White
Plaza rally, there is no evidence of preparation for a legal
strike or boycott: no plans for picketing; no direct effort
at persuasion of the workers of the Computation Center
to withhold their labor or for the users of the Center to
boycott the facility. In the present context, the term
"strike" was a kind of euphemism for a broad range of
protest activities, including peaceful, coercive and vio
lent activities. We conclude that Professor Franklin must
reasonably have expected that his advocacy of "shut
down" would be interpreted by at least a substantial
portion of the audience as calling for forceful disruption
of the operation of the Center. Indeed, we believe that
this is what he meant.
CONCLUSION
We conclude that Professor Franklin must reasonably
have expected that his speech at White Plaza on
February 10, 1971, would increase the likelihood of
illegal occupation of the Computation Center immedi
ately following his speech, and that there was risk of
serious damage to the computer and its users. The Board
finds the evidence strongly persuasive that Professor
Franklin urged and incited his audience at White Plaza
towards disruption of University functions and shut
down of the Computation Center. We therefore sustain
charge No. 8.
A. CHARGES
The relevant University charges concerning the White
Plaza incident are contained in Paragraph 8 of the
"Statement of Charges" dated March 22, 1971. This
paragraph reads as follows:
8. On February 10, 1971, beginning at about 12
p.m., a rally was held at White Memorial Plaza to,
among other things, discuss methods of protesting
developments in the war in Indochina. Over tive
humdred students and other persons attended. During
the course of the rally two prinicpal courses of action
were discussed, one being to work in the non-Univer
sity community to bring about changes in govern
ment policy, the other being to disrupt University
functions and business. Professor Franklin intention
ally urged and incited students and other persons
present at the rally to follow the latter course of
action and specifically to shut down a University
computer facility known as the Computation Center.
Shortly thereafter a large number of students and
others left the rally and went to the Computation
Center whereupon many of these persons did in fact
occupy the Computation Center, prevent its opera
tion and obstruct movement in and out of the
building for several hours, terminating this unlawful
activity only when ordered to leave the building by
the police.
B. NATURE OF THE CHARGE
The general charge is that Professor Franklin urged
and incited the disruption of University functions; the
specific charge is that he urged and incited his audience
to shut down a University facility, the Computation
Center. Effectively, this means that his words, including
their delivery and their context, significantly increased
the likelihood of prohibited conduct on the part of his
audience; it means, moreover, that he must have anti
cipated that his speech, given its delivery and context,
would significantly increase the imminent likelihood of
prohibited conduct.
C. FINDINGS OF FACT
/. Prominent Themes in the White Plaza Rally
The noon-hour rally at White Plaza, attended at its
peak by about 700 people, had been proposed the night
before at the conclusion of a rally at Dinkelspiel Audi
torium. Most of the speeches given at the White Plaza
rally were available on tape recordings. Only a portion at
the outset was missing, and this was covered in testi
mony. The following themes emerged prominently in
the course of the White Plaza rally:
a. Many speakers discussed ways of protesting the
war in Southeast Asia. Three speakers, including two
student body leaders, favored an off-cainpus focus of
protest. They were severely criticized by five subsequent
speakers, who characterized liberal war protest in such
terms as "counter-insurgency." This may be illustrated
by the following speech:
Yeah, I'd just like to point out that the only time the
liberals and moderates come out of the woodwork is
when there is radical action on campus. . . .That's the
only way moderates and liberals can, can get off their
asses, is when the people around them are doing these
violent things which you consider to be useless.
b. On four occasions, there was reference to selection
of a protest target on campus; the desirability of alterna
tive possibilities was considered.
c. The Computation Center was referred to often
throughout the meeting. Its suitability as a protest target
was cited. In the final speech of the rally, Professor
Franklin called for shutting down the Computation
Center.
d. Some speakers emphasized Stanford's war com
plicity and the desirability of shutting down the Univer
sity in order to end that complicity.
e. Four speakers made reference to the concept of

different people taking protest action on different levels,
each doing his own thing. Three of these clearly included
coercive and violent behavior within the spectrum of
approved activities, and the fourth is unclear on this
poin<. The following quotations help to clarify this
important theme:
And so closing down Stanford is really a concrete
blow against the war. You see, that's a concrete way
of stopping, stopping things that are going on that
help the war by stopping that kind of research, by
stopping the programs that are run in the computer
center....
It's true that if we're writing letters to congressmen
we're probably not doing that much. But by striking
the University and by taking, by taking whatever
kinds of action we can, you see, on a lot of different
levels, some people may want to take over buildings,
some people will want to boycott class, some people
will want to cause classes to be boycotted, you see
it's not much good if English classes and the French
class aren't going on, but the Business School classes
and the Electronic Engineering classes are going on
and the Department of Defense research contracts are
still being carried out.
KZSU: The crowd is still growing here at White Plaza,
now about 700 people.
[new speaker] What really amazes me is like every
body that's here right now is like obviously against
the war. Now all this friction and all this bullshit
that's going on between radicals and conservatives
and liberals or whoever the fuck it is, it's all just
friction. Now, as long as people who are writing
letters or doing strikes, or breaking windows or what,
everybody's doing their own thing to stop that
fucking war over there. So, everybody do their own
thing, and let's stop that war now and altogether,
[applause]
112. The term "strike" was used several times, though
less than it had been the previous night at the Dinkel
spiel rally. Once again, it seemed to bear little relation to
the meaning of "strike" in labor disputes. Rather, it
seemed to refer to a broad spectrum of activities, some
non-coercive and some coercive. The most prominent
connotation was that of the "mobile strike" introduced
February 9th at Dinkelspiel—closing down one universi
ty facility after another by whatever means proved
feasible.
g. Six speakers made favorable reference to coercive
or violent behavior. This may be illustrated by a
recorded passage from Professor Franklin's speech:
. . .so want to talk about, about high consciousness,
the high consciousness is the consciousness of the
people most oppressed by U.S. imperialism, which
includes as a main institution of that Stanford
University. And that's why whenever people from
that community, whenever poor working class youth
from that community, get a chance to come on the
campus at Stanford and do a little material damage,
they are very eager to do so. Because they recognize
what Stanford University is, even if people here
don't.
2. Summary of Professor Franklin's speech
Professor Franklin gave the closing and longest speech
of the rally. (See Appendix II.) He called for a
willingness to sacrifice in the service of protest activity.
He criticized student body leaders for allegedly subvert
ing the activity of protesters. He gave some of his
personal history in antiwar activity. He cited a poll
indicating that people with little education expressed
more opposition to the war in Southeast Asia than those
with higher levels of education.
At the passage quoted earlier, referring to material
damage by working class youth at Stanford, Professor
Franklin's delivery shifted to a higher intensity, remain

ing at this level until the conclusion. He continued later,
Well, when we talk about, see we're just ripping off
the term strike when talking about striking at
Stanford. This isn't a strike. We're not risking
anything. It's a voluntary boycott—a shutdown of
some of the activities of the University as a demon
stration of something. Now, now what we called a
strike last year, and it lasted really about three days
and it kind of dragged on, and you know, in an odds
and ends way and some people did it. But just the
fact that we were able to move our little finger that
much, that electrified the working people of this
area.. ..
He ended the speech by saying,
See, now what we're asking is for people to make that
little tiny gesture to show that we're willing to
inconvenience ourselves a little bit and to begin to
shut down the most obvious machinery of war, such
as, and I think it is a good target, that Computation
Center, [applause and shouts of "right on. .. ."]
Immediately after Professor Franklin's speech, the
chairman asked for a vote to choose between the
Computation Center and Hoover. About 100 hands
(primarily in front) voted affirmatively on the question
of shutting down the former, whereupon the chairman
announced that a majority favored this course. He said,
"And so I would suggest that we go over there and visit
it." At that point, a voice is heard calling, "Shut it
down," echoing the comment made just before by
Professor Franklin and the meeting's chairman.
As the crowd was leaving they were instructed,
When people go over to the Comp Center, they
should all go in a group and move relatively slowly so
that the group can stay together. Also the meeting at
8 o'clock tonight in the Old Union Courtyard is a
very important meeting because we can decide what
we want to do tomorrow. There are some things that
we can't close down now, but we can close them
down if we get to them early in the morning.
3. Interpretation of the Meaning of Professor Frank
lin 's White Plaza Speech
a. Professor Franklin's Own Interpretation
There were several differing points of view regarding
the meaning of the speech given by Professor Franklin.
Professor Franklin himself in an affidavit dated February
24, 1971 described the meaning of his speech:
Actually, in order to understand either the content of
my speech or that of the rally itself, it is necessary to
see it in relation to the events of the previous evening.
The debate was essentially over the same issues, that
is, whether to focus off campus or call for a strike on
campus, and whether a strike could be effective.
Much of the debate was repetitious of the previous
night, but since most of the people at that meeting
felt bound by the vote, those who had wanted to stop
the munition train did not make their proposal. The
main spokesmen for off-campus work were Bob
Grant and Larry Diamond, who proposed doing
precinct work to elect so-called peace candidates. It
was my belief that these two were not being honest,
and that their main purpose was to prevent any
effective action and to advance their own political
careers. It was with this in mind, plus a sense that
many people were becoming very impatient with the
idle debate of the rally, that I rose to speak. My
intention was, as it had been the previous night, to
build the anti-war movement on the campus. ...
He concluded this portion of the affidavit:
Let's move our little finger again and begin to pick up
where we left off with our strike last spring. Let's
begin to shut down the machinery of war. I think
that the suggested target of the computer center is as
good a place to begin as any. So the content of the
entire speech was to strike against the invasion ol
Laos. In making this speech, and the one on the
preceding night, I thought that I was operating
entirely within the precedent established during the
invasion of Cambodia when the overwhelming majori
ty of the faculty and students of the majority of
departments and schools of the University voted to
go on strike. For instance, my own department on
May 4, 1970 voted overwhelmingly in favor of a
strike for an indefinite period, demanding: 1. An
immediate withdrawal ol all American forces from
Southeast Asia; 2. The end of political repression at
home, in particular the government's systematic
attempt to eliminate the Black Panther and other
political dissidents; 3. The removal of KOTC from
the Stanford campus by the end of the academic
quarter; 4. An end to all war-related and secret
research on the Stanford campus by the end of the
quarter.
In the hearing, he described the meaning of his speech
in essentially similar terms.
b. Hearing Witnesses' Interpretation
University Administration witnesses testified that the
crowd was moved by Professor Franklin's speech and
that he served as a catalyst to get the group moving in
the direction of the Computation Center. One of
Professor Franklin's witnesses felt that the Computation
Center was an appropriate target. He said that a
"shutdown" of the University could range from "blast
various parts of it from the face of Santa Clara County"
to taking over a building as had occurred at Lncina Hall
the year before. One of liis witnesses testified that
Professor Franklin was trying to bring factions together
but didn't influence tactics already decided; two felt the
decision to go to the Computation Center had been
arrived at the night before and the purpose of the speech
was to support a Cambodia-type strike; two thought
Professor Franklin's speech was just educational; two
thought that he was not as influential as a middle-aged
salesman who had spoken earlier; one felt that the
purpose of the White Plaza rally was to choose a target
and to recruit more people.
4. Summary of Principal Points oj Defense
Several prominent elements recurred in defense testi
mony and argument on the White Plaza speech:
(a) A widespread inclination to shut down the
Computation Center, and to carry out a variety of
disruptive activities, was formed over the preceding
several days. It was justified in terms of Stanford's
complicity in the war and the Gamut-H program at
the Computation Center. It was consistent with
long-standing antipathy to the war in Asia and to
Stanford's allegedly vital role in the war. It was
exacerbated by the current news of military action in
Laos.
(b) Such an inclination toward disruptive activity in
general, and toward the Computation Center in
particular, was widespread in and around the Univer
sity, especially in the "movement." The persons
inclined to these actions would have carried them out
regardless of any role Professor Franklin might have
had in encouraging, fostering or facilitating them.
(c) Professor Franklin's speech had little effect on
those present. It was political, analytical, and educa
tional, rather than tactical. It presented no danger to
persons or property.
(d) He was simply advocating a voluntary boycott or
legal strike at the Computation Center. Even if his
speech could be construed as advocating disruption of
the Computation Center, he had in mind no seriously
adverse consequences-only a vigorous mode of pro
test of the war and the University's role in it.
5. Analysis of Professor Franklin's White Plaza
Speech, February 10.
a. Background and Foreseeable Consequences of
Computation Center Occupation
The fact that potential for major damage within the
Computation Center existed must have been well known
to Professor Franklin. The mechanisms to achieve such
damage were thoroughly identified during the Dinkel
spiel meeting the previous night. Highly publicized
computer occupations leading to extensive damage had
recently occurred at other universities. Testimony in
dicates that the decision not to damage the computer in
the face of eviction by the police was taken by the
demonstrators after the occupation was in force. Pro
fessor Franklin could reasonably expect that an occupa
tion of the Computation Center would involve great
risks to the computer and to the members of the
University community who rely upon it, including the
staff of the Computation Center. It should be empha
sized that the research and education of many people
throughout the University were in jeopardy.
In some respects a computer plays a role in a modern
university not unlike that of a library: it receives,
catalogues, processes and stores information and it
makes it available in various forms as required. To attack
a computation center because some of its information is
considered evil is little different from attacking an entire
library for harboring a few evil books. Professor Franklin
should have known that the occupation of the Computa
tion Center would lead to an agonizing decision by the
University administration whether to request police to
evict the occupiers, thereby ending a costly seizure at
the expense of an increased risk of damage.
The demonstrators showed no serious inclination to
consider the genuine complexities of computer use.
They made minimal inquiry about uses of the computer
—considering only on-line medical use, and not investiga
ting even that use thoroughly. They showed no concern
for the relation of the computer to other problems
involving human welfare. As a consequence of their
action, 700 to 800 jobs were not run that day; no one
knows how many more would have been impaired if the
occupiers had not been evicted. The social cost of
vigilante action in regard to computers or similar
facilities can become very high.
We heard no evidence that demonstrators made any
serious attempt to communicate with responsible of
ficers of the University in order to inquire about the
state of the Gamut-H program, or the ways in which
research policies are administered in regard to computer
use, prior to the forceful occupation of the Center.
Indeed, one of Professor Franklin's witnesses testified
that the Gamut-H program was known to the "move
ment" for a week or two, but a decision was made to
delay its announcement pending a favorable moment for
protest activity. The military action in Laos provided
such an opportunity. If the news of Gamut-H could be
held a week or two in private, why was instant action
suddenly required on February 10? Professor Franklin
and his witnesses agreed that advocacy towards shut
down of the Computation Center proceeded on the basis
of publications and statements of The Inquisition;
shutdown of the Computation Center was certainly not

a last resort measure. Thus, a poorly checked complaint
was made public after a tactical delay and then rapidly
shifted into coercive action with only the most rudi
mentary attempt at negotiating the grievance. Finally, in
view of the expressed rationale for forceful occupation
of the Computation Center, it is noteworthy that the
Gamut-H program was not even mentioned at any point
in the lengthy tape recording of the White Plaza rally.
b. The Speech Itself
Professor Franklin urged the Board to consider his
speeches in their full context. He particularly called our
attention to protests at Stanford, to the events of the
preceding few days, and to the Dinkelspiel rally of
February 9. These have been summarized earlier.
Throughout these turbulent events, a persistent differ
ence of opinion is manifested between those who place
primary emphasis on the University's role in the war and
those who place primary emphasis on the role of the
government. Professor Franklin clearly belongs in the
former category. In a Dinkelspiel speech of February 9th
and the White Plaza speech of February 10th, he is
severely critical of the University's role in fostering the
design and execution of the war. He strongly urges his
listeners to direct their attention to the University,
expressing hostility toward its trustees, administration,
and some student body leaders. He views the University
as centrally culpable in the war, and directs attention
away from the federal government. This characterization
of the University has the effect of justifying strong
protest or retaliation.
Within this framework, the "movement" chose to
focus attention on the Computation Center as a symbol
and instrument of the war. The February 9th rally is full
of angry references to the Computation Center—the
culpability of its users, its vulnerability, its suitability for
attack and possibly even for destruction. Professor
Franklin must have been aware of this danger to the
Computation Center-to its functions, its hardware, and
to the large number of people who rely upon it in their
work. These matters had been discussed extensively at
the February 9th rally in which he was an active
participant. He also took part in an investigatory march
that followed the February 9th rally, a preparation for
the likelihood of disruptive action the following day. He
admits in testimony and argument that he gave strong
support to the correctness of action against the Compu
tation Center before, during, and after its occupation,
specifically including the White Plaza rally.
In the main, the purpose of the White Plaza rally of
February 10th appears to have been: (1) to increase the
numbers available for protest activity; (2) to settle
firmly on a target. In respect to (2) the Computation
Center appeared to be the most likely target as a result
of the February 9th meeting, but the Hoover Institution
was still under consideration; two student leaders advo
cated nondisruptive political activity, but they were
strongly criticized by Professor Franklin and others.
Professor Franklin was a highly respected leader of a
group advocating intense hostility to the University as
well as disdain for nondisruptive modes of protest and
for electoral politics. His White Plaza speech contains an
approving reference to material damage to Stanlord
University, and his testimony on these events provides
repeated justification for such damage. At White Plaza
on February 10th, this orientation was brought sharply
to bear on the Computation Center.
It is uncontested that at the White Plaza rally
Professor Franklin concluded his speech by stating
". . .what we are asking is.. .to begin to shut down the
most obvious machinery of war, such as, and I think it is
a good target, that Computation Center.. ." and that
subsequently the Stanford Computation Center, al
though officially declared closed, was forcefully oc
cupied, resulting in shutdown of operation and minor

damage. It is also uncontested that many of the
occupiers were in the audience of Professor Franklin's
speech.
Professor Franklin has also asserted that a firm
decision to shut down the Computation Center was
already reached on February 9, and that therefore his
speech on February 10 could not have contributed to
the subsequent course of events. The evidence does not
support the assertion. The meeting on February 9th held
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium identified a spectrum of
options for action, and two-action against the Hoover
Institution and against the Computation Center-were
left as leading candidates. The preceding summary of
Dinkelspiel (February 9) and White Pla/.a (February 10)
rallies makes this clear. Moreover, several witnesses (both
for the administration and for Professor Franklin)
testified that specific action against the University was
not settled, or that they were undecided whether to
participate in the Computation Center action until they
attended this rally at which Professor Franklin gave the
final speech.
C. Professor Franklin's Use of the Term "Strike "
The Board has found it helpful to pay special
attention to the context for subsequent events provided
by the Dinkelspiel rally of the night of February 9th.
Both the University Administration and Professor Frank
lin devoted considerable attention to this background. In
that connection, we think it important to note that
Professor Franklin himself placed special emphasis dur
ing the hearing on the importance of that rally for
providing context. For that reason, we find the introduc
tion to his own analysis of that topic in this supplemen
tary written brief (page 106) rather unreasonable. He
says"The administration attempts to prove that the real
meaning of Franklin's speech can be found lurking in
several statements gleaned from the lengthy meeting at
Dinkelspiel." If the Administration did so, it was at
Professor Franklin's own invitation.
Our view of the matter is that Professor Franklin was
right the first time: the Dinkelspiel rally does provide
important insights into the speech that follows. It is
analyzed extensively above, in the section on "Back
ground to Events of February 10, 1972." We here
comment on the view presented by Prolessor Franklin in
his supplementary written brief. The main thrust of his
argument is that the rally was a very general discussion,
organized primarily along the lines of planning a strike;
he says (p. 109) "The reason there were no plans for a
picket sign is that there were no plans for anything
beyond a meeting and a general sort of strike." He also
asserts (p. 107) "There was never a real discussion of the
variety of ways the Computer Center could be shut
down except along the general lines of a strike."
In fact, his account tends to select heavily those
speeches from the Dinkelspiel rally that emphasize the
non-coercive aspects of the kind of "strike" he is talking
about. For example, he ignores the following speech
early in the rally:
And so the only reason that we would attack the
University would be on the grounds of effectiveness,
though I would try to direct the demands toward
specific things in the community and that are
attackable like the Computation Center.. . .
In addition, there are two other early calJs to stop
talking and commence action. Later, Braunstein recom
mends a range of actions, including some that lie well
outside the range of legal actions that is subsumed under
the term "strike" when used in its normal context.
Indeed, the term "strike" clearly has a different
meaning to members of the "movement" at Stanford
than it does in ordinary usage. When preceded by the
modifying words "Cambodia-type," it encompasses a

wide range of actions, including some that are legal and
some that are illegal. The introduction of the concept of
a "mobile strike," which takes place well before the end
of the Dinkelspiel rally, was clearly a modification
introduced by numerical considerations: it was argued
that the number of people was inadequate to close a
number of things simultaneously, but that they might
succeed if targets were attacked seriatim. It is clear that
in all of these uses, the term "strike" encompasses a
wide range of activities. In his supplementary written
brief, Professor Franklin borrows the conventional
meaning from the labor context, and then employs it as
a flag in which to wrap a much broader range of
conduct. All of the speakers who spoke late in the rally,
after they had developed some consensus around the
notion of "mobile strike" and were discussing a target,
used language that clearly involves the expectation of
being confronted by the police, moved out of buildings,
and the like. Persuading workers to leave their jobs,
standing in the doorways to bear "moral witness,"
picketing — these activities get little or no prominence in
the discussion, although Professor Franklin tries to
persuade us that these activities are really the dominant
elements of a "strike." The context so established is not
substantially changed, in our view, by the earlier
speakers at the White Plaza rally.
The words "shut it down" imply a cessation of
function that can sometimes be achieved by a strike,
strictly defined, but may be achieved by other means as
well. From a careful reading of the Dinkelspiel trans
cript, we are persuaded that the context for the White
Plaza rally was one in which the prospective shutting
down of the Computation Center was to be achieved
primarily by means going beyond the range of legal
"strike" tactics. We find Professor Franklin's use of the
term "strike" disingenuous, and we believe that his own
exhortation to "shut down" the Computation Center
was, given that context, an intentional invitation to
employ such extra-legal means as might be necessary.
In summary, could Professor Franklin reasonably
have expected that his speech would have contributed to
the likelihood of the occupation? Professor Franklin
asserts that he was only advocating a legal strike or
voluntary boycott of the Computation Center, or
alternatively that he gave no thoughts at all to the
consequences of his speech. The preceding analysis of
the Dinkelspiel rally makes this a highly dubious
proposition. Although there clearly were discussions of a
"strike" against Stanford University during the rally at
Dinkelspiel and during the early portions of the White
Plaza rally, there is no evidence of preparation for a legal
strike or boycott: no plans for picketing; no direct effort
at persuasion of the workers of the Computation Center
to withhold their labor or for the users of the Center to
boycott the facility. In the present context, the term
"strike" was a kind of euphemism for a broad range of
protest activities, including peaceful, coercive and vio
lent activities. We conclude that Professor Franklin must
reasonably have expected that his advocacy of "shut
down" would be interpreted by at least a substantial
portion of the audience as calling for forceful disruption
of the operation of the Center. Indeed, we believe that
this is what he meant.
CONCLUSION
We conclude that Professor Franklin must reasonably
have expected that his speech at White Plaza on
February 10, 1971, would increase the likelihood of
illegal occupation of the Computation Center immedi
ately following his speech, and that there was risk of
serious damage to the computer and its users. The Board
finds the evidence strongly persuasive that Professor
Franklin urged and incited his audience at White Plaza
towards disruption of University functions and shut
down of the Computation Center. We therefore sustain
charge No. 8.
A. CHARGES
The relevant University charges concerning the White
Plaza incident are contained in Paragraph 8 of the
"Statement of Charges" dated March 22, 1971. This
paragraph reads as follows:
8. On February 10, 1971, beginning at about 12
p.m., a rally was held at White Memorial Plaza to,
among other things, discuss methods of protesting
developments in the war in Indochina. Over tive
humdred students and other persons attended. During
the course of the rally two prinicpal courses of action
were discussed, one being to work in the non-Univer
sity community to bring about changes in govern
ment policy, the other being to disrupt University
functions and business. Professor Franklin intention
ally urged and incited students and other persons
present at the rally to follow the latter course of
action and specifically to shut down a University
computer facility known as the Computation Center.
Shortly thereafter a large number of students and
others left the rally and went to the Computation
Center whereupon many of these persons did in fact
occupy the Computation Center, prevent its opera
tion and obstruct movement in and out of the
building for several hours, terminating this unlawful
activity only when ordered to leave the building by
the police.
B. NATURE OF THE CHARGE
The general charge is that Professor Franklin urged
and incited the disruption of University functions; the
specific charge is that he urged and incited his audience
to shut down a University facility, the Computation
Center. Effectively, this means that his words, including
their delivery and their context, significantly increased
the likelihood of prohibited conduct on the part of his
audience; it means, moreover, that he must have anti
cipated that his speech, given its delivery and context,
would significantly increase the imminent likelihood of
prohibited conduct.
C. FINDINGS OF FACT
/. Prominent Themes in the White Plaza Rally
The noon-hour rally at White Plaza, attended at its
peak by about 700 people, had been proposed the night
before at the conclusion of a rally at Dinkelspiel Audi
torium. Most of the speeches given at the White Plaza
rally were available on tape recordings. Only a portion at
the outset was missing, and this was covered in testi
mony. The following themes emerged prominently in
the course of the White Plaza rally:
a. Many speakers discussed ways of protesting the
war in Southeast Asia. Three speakers, including two
student body leaders, favored an off-cainpus focus of
protest. They were severely criticized by five subsequent
speakers, who characterized liberal war protest in such
terms as "counter-insurgency." This may be illustrated
by the following speech:
Yeah, I'd just like to point out that the only time the
liberals and moderates come out of the woodwork is
when there is radical action on campus. . . .That's the
only way moderates and liberals can, can get off their
asses, is when the people around them are doing these
violent things which you consider to be useless.
b. On four occasions, there was reference to selection
of a protest target on campus; the desirability of alterna
tive possibilities was considered.
c. The Computation Center was referred to often
throughout the meeting. Its suitability as a protest target
was cited. In the final speech of the rally, Professor
Franklin called for shutting down the Computation
Center.
d. Some speakers emphasized Stanford's war com
plicity and the desirability of shutting down the Univer
sity in order to end that complicity.
e. Four speakers made reference to the concept of

different people taking protest action on different levels,
each doing his own thing. Three of these clearly included
coercive and violent behavior within the spectrum of
approved activities, and the fourth is unclear on this
poin<. The following quotations help to clarify this
important theme:
And so closing down Stanford is really a concrete
blow against the war. You see, that's a concrete way
of stopping, stopping things that are going on that
help the war by stopping that kind of research, by
stopping the programs that are run in the computer
center....
It's true that if we're writing letters to congressmen
we're probably not doing that much. But by striking
the University and by taking, by taking whatever
kinds of action we can, you see, on a lot of different
levels, some people may want to take over buildings,
some people will want to boycott class, some people
will want to cause classes to be boycotted, you see
it's not much good if English classes and the French
class aren't going on, but the Business School classes
and the Electronic Engineering classes are going on
and the Department of Defense research contracts are
still being carried out.
KZSU: The crowd is still growing here at White Plaza,
now about 700 people.
[new speaker] What really amazes me is like every
body that's here right now is like obviously against
the war. Now all this friction and all this bullshit
that's going on between radicals and conservatives
and liberals or whoever the fuck it is, it's all just
friction. Now, as long as people who are writing
letters or doing strikes, or breaking windows or what,
everybody's doing their own thing to stop that
fucking war over there. So, everybody do their own
thing, and let's stop that war now and altogether,
[applause]
112. The term "strike" was used several times, though
less than it had been the previous night at the Dinkel
spiel rally. Once again, it seemed to bear little relation to
the meaning of "strike" in labor disputes. Rather, it
seemed to refer to a broad spectrum of activities, some
non-coercive and some coercive. The most prominent
connotation was that of the "mobile strike" introduced
February 9th at Dinkelspiel—closing down one universi
ty facility after another by whatever means proved
feasible.
g. Six speakers made favorable reference to coercive
or violent behavior. This may be illustrated by a
recorded passage from Professor Franklin's speech:
. . .so want to talk about, about high consciousness,
the high consciousness is the consciousness of the
people most oppressed by U.S. imperialism, which
includes as a main institution of that Stanford
University. And that's why whenever people from
that community, whenever poor working class youth
from that community, get a chance to come on the
campus at Stanford and do a little material damage,
they are very eager to do so. Because they recognize
what Stanford University is, even if people here
don't.
2. Summary of Professor Franklin's speech
Professor Franklin gave the closing and longest speech
of the rally. (See Appendix II.) He called for a
willingness to sacrifice in the service of protest activity.
He criticized student body leaders for allegedly subvert
ing the activity of protesters. He gave some of his
personal history in antiwar activity. He cited a poll
indicating that people with little education expressed
more opposition to the war in Southeast Asia than those
with higher levels of education.
At the passage quoted earlier, referring to material
damage by working class youth at Stanford, Professor
Franklin's delivery shifted to a higher intensity, remain

ing at this level until the conclusion. He continued later,
Well, when we talk about, see we're just ripping off
the term strike when talking about striking at
Stanford. This isn't a strike. We're not risking
anything. It's a voluntary boycott—a shutdown of
some of the activities of the University as a demon
stration of something. Now, now what we called a
strike last year, and it lasted really about three days
and it kind of dragged on, and you know, in an odds
and ends way and some people did it. But just the
fact that we were able to move our little finger that
much, that electrified the working people of this
area.. ..
He ended the speech by saying,
See, now what we're asking is for people to make that
little tiny gesture to show that we're willing to
inconvenience ourselves a little bit and to begin to
shut down the most obvious machinery of war, such
as, and I think it is a good target, that Computation
Center, [applause and shouts of "right on. .. ."]
Immediately after Professor Franklin's speech, the
chairman asked for a vote to choose between the
Computation Center and Hoover. About 100 hands
(primarily in front) voted affirmatively on the question
of shutting down the former, whereupon the chairman
announced that a majority favored this course. He said,
"And so I would suggest that we go over there and visit
it." At that point, a voice is heard calling, "Shut it
down," echoing the comment made just before by
Professor Franklin and the meeting's chairman.
As the crowd was leaving they were instructed,
When people go over to the Comp Center, they
should all go in a group and move relatively slowly so
that the group can stay together. Also the meeting at
8 o'clock tonight in the Old Union Courtyard is a
very important meeting because we can decide what
we want to do tomorrow. There are some things that
we can't close down now, but we can close them
down if we get to them early in the morning.
3. Interpretation of the Meaning of Professor Frank
lin 's White Plaza Speech
a. Professor Franklin's Own Interpretation
There were several differing points of view regarding
the meaning of the speech given by Professor Franklin.
Professor Franklin himself in an affidavit dated February
24, 1971 described the meaning of his speech:
Actually, in order to understand either the content of
my speech or that of the rally itself, it is necessary to
see it in relation to the events of the previous evening.
The debate was essentially over the same issues, that
is, whether to focus off campus or call for a strike on
campus, and whether a strike could be effective.
Much of the debate was repetitious of the previous
night, but since most of the people at that meeting
felt bound by the vote, those who had wanted to stop
the munition train did not make their proposal. The
main spokesmen for off-campus work were Bob
Grant and Larry Diamond, who proposed doing
precinct work to elect so-called peace candidates. It
was my belief that these two were not being honest,
and that their main purpose was to prevent any
effective action and to advance their own political
careers. It was with this in mind, plus a sense that
many people were becoming very impatient with the
idle debate of the rally, that I rose to speak. My
intention was, as it had been the previous night, to
build the anti-war movement on the campus. ...
He concluded this portion of the affidavit:
Let's move our little finger again and begin to pick up
where we left off with our strike last spring. Let's
begin to shut down the machinery of war. I think
that the suggested target of the computer center is as
good a place to begin as any. So the content of the
entire speech was to strike against the invasion ol
Laos. In making this speech, and the one on the
preceding night, I thought that I was operating
entirely within the precedent established during the
invasion of Cambodia when the overwhelming majori
ty of the faculty and students of the majority of
departments and schools of the University voted to
go on strike. For instance, my own department on
May 4, 1970 voted overwhelmingly in favor of a
strike for an indefinite period, demanding: 1. An
immediate withdrawal ol all American forces from
Southeast Asia; 2. The end of political repression at
home, in particular the government's systematic
attempt to eliminate the Black Panther and other
political dissidents; 3. The removal of KOTC from
the Stanford campus by the end of the academic
quarter; 4. An end to all war-related and secret
research on the Stanford campus by the end of the
quarter.
In the hearing, he described the meaning of his speech
in essentially similar terms.
b. Hearing Witnesses' Interpretation
University Administration witnesses testified that the
crowd was moved by Professor Franklin's speech and
that he served as a catalyst to get the group moving in
the direction of the Computation Center. One of
Professor Franklin's witnesses felt that the Computation
Center was an appropriate target. He said that a
"shutdown" of the University could range from "blast
various parts of it from the face of Santa Clara County"
to taking over a building as had occurred at Lncina Hall
the year before. One of liis witnesses testified that
Professor Franklin was trying to bring factions together
but didn't influence tactics already decided; two felt the
decision to go to the Computation Center had been
arrived at the night before and the purpose of the speech
was to support a Cambodia-type strike; two thought
Professor Franklin's speech was just educational; two
thought that he was not as influential as a middle-aged
salesman who had spoken earlier; one felt that the
purpose of the White Plaza rally was to choose a target
and to recruit more people.
4. Summary of Principal Points oj Defense
Several prominent elements recurred in defense testi
mony and argument on the White Plaza speech:
(a) A widespread inclination to shut down the
Computation Center, and to carry out a variety of
disruptive activities, was formed over the preceding
several days. It was justified in terms of Stanford's
complicity in the war and the Gamut-H program at
the Computation Center. It was consistent with
long-standing antipathy to the war in Asia and to
Stanford's allegedly vital role in the war. It was
exacerbated by the current news of military action in
Laos.
(b) Such an inclination toward disruptive activity in
general, and toward the Computation Center in
particular, was widespread in and around the Univer
sity, especially in the "movement." The persons
inclined to these actions would have carried them out
regardless of any role Professor Franklin might have
had in encouraging, fostering or facilitating them.
(c) Professor Franklin's speech had little effect on
those present. It was political, analytical, and educa
tional, rather than tactical. It presented no danger to
persons or property.
(d) He was simply advocating a voluntary boycott or
legal strike at the Computation Center. Even if his
speech could be construed as advocating disruption of
the Computation Center, he had in mind no seriously
adverse consequences-only a vigorous mode of pro
test of the war and the University's role in it.
5. Analysis of Professor Franklin's White Plaza
Speech, February 10.
a. Background and Foreseeable Consequences of
Computation Center Occupation
The fact that potential for major damage within the
Computation Center existed must have been well known
to Professor Franklin. The mechanisms to achieve such
damage were thoroughly identified during the Dinkel
spiel meeting the previous night. Highly publicized
computer occupations leading to extensive damage had
recently occurred at other universities. Testimony in
dicates that the decision not to damage the computer in
the face of eviction by the police was taken by the
demonstrators after the occupation was in force. Pro
fessor Franklin could reasonably expect that an occupa
tion of the Computation Center would involve great
risks to the computer and to the members of the
University community who rely upon it, including the
staff of the Computation Center. It should be empha
sized that the research and education of many people
throughout the University were in jeopardy.
In some respects a computer plays a role in a modern
university not unlike that of a library: it receives,
catalogues, processes and stores information and it
makes it available in various forms as required. To attack
a computation center because some of its information is
considered evil is little different from attacking an entire
library for harboring a few evil books. Professor Franklin
should have known that the occupation of the Computa
tion Center would lead to an agonizing decision by the
University administration whether to request police to
evict the occupiers, thereby ending a costly seizure at
the expense of an increased risk of damage.
The demonstrators showed no serious inclination to
consider the genuine complexities of computer use.
They made minimal inquiry about uses of the computer
—considering only on-line medical use, and not investiga
ting even that use thoroughly. They showed no concern
for the relation of the computer to other problems
involving human welfare. As a consequence of their
action, 700 to 800 jobs were not run that day; no one
knows how many more would have been impaired if the
occupiers had not been evicted. The social cost of
vigilante action in regard to computers or similar
facilities can become very high.
We heard no evidence that demonstrators made any
serious attempt to communicate with responsible of
ficers of the University in order to inquire about the
state of the Gamut-H program, or the ways in which
research policies are administered in regard to computer
use, prior to the forceful occupation of the Center.
Indeed, one of Professor Franklin's witnesses testified
that the Gamut-H program was known to the "move
ment" for a week or two, but a decision was made to
delay its announcement pending a favorable moment for
protest activity. The military action in Laos provided
such an opportunity. If the news of Gamut-H could be
held a week or two in private, why was instant action
suddenly required on February 10? Professor Franklin
and his witnesses agreed that advocacy towards shut
down of the Computation Center proceeded on the basis
of publications and statements of The Inquisition;
shutdown of the Computation Center was certainly not

a last resort measure. Thus, a poorly checked complaint
was made public after a tactical delay and then rapidly
shifted into coercive action with only the most rudi
mentary attempt at negotiating the grievance. Finally, in
view of the expressed rationale for forceful occupation
of the Computation Center, it is noteworthy that the
Gamut-H program was not even mentioned at any point
in the lengthy tape recording of the White Plaza rally.
b. The Speech Itself
Professor Franklin urged the Board to consider his
speeches in their full context. He particularly called our
attention to protests at Stanford, to the events of the
preceding few days, and to the Dinkelspiel rally of
February 9. These have been summarized earlier.
Throughout these turbulent events, a persistent differ
ence of opinion is manifested between those who place
primary emphasis on the University's role in the war and
those who place primary emphasis on the role of the
government. Professor Franklin clearly belongs in the
former category. In a Dinkelspiel speech of February 9th
and the White Plaza speech of February 10th, he is
severely critical of the University's role in fostering the
design and execution of the war. He strongly urges his
listeners to direct their attention to the University,
expressing hostility toward its trustees, administration,
and some student body leaders. He views the University
as centrally culpable in the war, and directs attention
away from the federal government. This characterization
of the University has the effect of justifying strong
protest or retaliation.
Within this framework, the "movement" chose to
focus attention on the Computation Center as a symbol
and instrument of the war. The February 9th rally is full
of angry references to the Computation Center—the
culpability of its users, its vulnerability, its suitability for
attack and possibly even for destruction. Professor
Franklin must have been aware of this danger to the
Computation Center-to its functions, its hardware, and
to the large number of people who rely upon it in their
work. These matters had been discussed extensively at
the February 9th rally in which he was an active
participant. He also took part in an investigatory march
that followed the February 9th rally, a preparation for
the likelihood of disruptive action the following day. He
admits in testimony and argument that he gave strong
support to the correctness of action against the Compu
tation Center before, during, and after its occupation,
specifically including the White Plaza rally.
In the main, the purpose of the White Plaza rally of
February 10th appears to have been: (1) to increase the
numbers available for protest activity; (2) to settle
firmly on a target. In respect to (2) the Computation
Center appeared to be the most likely target as a result
of the February 9th meeting, but the Hoover Institution
was still under consideration; two student leaders advo
cated nondisruptive political activity, but they were
strongly criticized by Professor Franklin and others.
Professor Franklin was a highly respected leader of a
group advocating intense hostility to the University as
well as disdain for nondisruptive modes of protest and
for electoral politics. His White Plaza speech contains an
approving reference to material damage to Stanlord
University, and his testimony on these events provides
repeated justification for such damage. At White Plaza
on February 10th, this orientation was brought sharply
to bear on the Computation Center.
It is uncontested that at the White Plaza rally
Professor Franklin concluded his speech by stating
". . .what we are asking is.. .to begin to shut down the
most obvious machinery of war, such as, and I think it is
a good target, that Computation Center.. ." and that
subsequently the Stanford Computation Center, al
though officially declared closed, was forcefully oc
cupied, resulting in shutdown of operation and minor

damage. It is also uncontested that many of the
occupiers were in the audience of Professor Franklin's
speech.
Professor Franklin has also asserted that a firm
decision to shut down the Computation Center was
already reached on February 9, and that therefore his
speech on February 10 could not have contributed to
the subsequent course of events. The evidence does not
support the assertion. The meeting on February 9th held
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium identified a spectrum of
options for action, and two-action against the Hoover
Institution and against the Computation Center-were
left as leading candidates. The preceding summary of
Dinkelspiel (February 9) and White Pla/.a (February 10)
rallies makes this clear. Moreover, several witnesses (both
for the administration and for Professor Franklin)
testified that specific action against the University was
not settled, or that they were undecided whether to
participate in the Computation Center action until they
attended this rally at which Professor Franklin gave the
final speech.
C. Professor Franklin's Use of the Term "Strike "
The Board has found it helpful to pay special
attention to the context for subsequent events provided
by the Dinkelspiel rally of the night of February 9th.
Both the University Administration and Professor Frank
lin devoted considerable attention to this background. In
that connection, we think it important to note that
Professor Franklin himself placed special emphasis dur
ing the hearing on the importance of that rally for
providing context. For that reason, we find the introduc
tion to his own analysis of that topic in this supplemen
tary written brief (page 106) rather unreasonable. He
says"The administration attempts to prove that the real
meaning of Franklin's speech can be found lurking in
several statements gleaned from the lengthy meeting at
Dinkelspiel." If the Administration did so, it was at
Professor Franklin's own invitation.
Our view of the matter is that Professor Franklin was
right the first time: the Dinkelspiel rally does provide
important insights into the speech that follows. It is
analyzed extensively above, in the section on "Back
ground to Events of February 10, 1972." We here
comment on the view presented by Prolessor Franklin in
his supplementary written brief. The main thrust of his
argument is that the rally was a very general discussion,
organized primarily along the lines of planning a strike;
he says (p. 109) "The reason there were no plans for a
picket sign is that there were no plans for anything
beyond a meeting and a general sort of strike." He also
asserts (p. 107) "There was never a real discussion of the
variety of ways the Computer Center could be shut
down except along the general lines of a strike."
In fact, his account tends to select heavily those
speeches from the Dinkelspiel rally that emphasize the
non-coercive aspects of the kind of "strike" he is talking
about. For example, he ignores the following speech
early in the rally:
And so the only reason that we would attack the
University would be on the grounds of effectiveness,
though I would try to direct the demands toward
specific things in the community and that are
attackable like the Computation Center.. . .
In addition, there are two other early calJs to stop
talking and commence action. Later, Braunstein recom
mends a range of actions, including some that lie well
outside the range of legal actions that is subsumed under
the term "strike" when used in its normal context.
Indeed, the term "strike" clearly has a different
meaning to members of the "movement" at Stanford
than it does in ordinary usage. When preceded by the
modifying words "Cambodia-type," it encompasses a

wide range of actions, including some that are legal and
some that are illegal. The introduction of the concept of
a "mobile strike," which takes place well before the end
of the Dinkelspiel rally, was clearly a modification
introduced by numerical considerations: it was argued
that the number of people was inadequate to close a
number of things simultaneously, but that they might
succeed if targets were attacked seriatim. It is clear that
in all of these uses, the term "strike" encompasses a
wide range of activities. In his supplementary written
brief, Professor Franklin borrows the conventional
meaning from the labor context, and then employs it as
a flag in which to wrap a much broader range of
conduct. All of the speakers who spoke late in the rally,
after they had developed some consensus around the
notion of "mobile strike" and were discussing a target,
used language that clearly involves the expectation of
being confronted by the police, moved out of buildings,
and the like. Persuading workers to leave their jobs,
standing in the doorways to bear "moral witness,"
picketing — these activities get little or no prominence in
the discussion, although Professor Franklin tries to
persuade us that these activities are really the dominant
elements of a "strike." The context so established is not
substantially changed, in our view, by the earlier
speakers at the White Plaza rally.
The words "shut it down" imply a cessation of
function that can sometimes be achieved by a strike,
strictly defined, but may be achieved by other means as
well. From a careful reading of the Dinkelspiel trans
cript, we are persuaded that the context for the White
Plaza rally was one in which the prospective shutting
down of the Computation Center was to be achieved
primarily by means going beyond the range of legal
"strike" tactics. We find Professor Franklin's use of the
term "strike" disingenuous, and we believe that his own
exhortation to "shut down" the Computation Center
was, given that context, an intentional invitation to
employ such extra-legal means as might be necessary.
In summary, could Professor Franklin reasonably
have expected that his speech would have contributed to
the likelihood of the occupation? Professor Franklin
asserts that he was only advocating a legal strike or
voluntary boycott of the Computation Center, or
alternatively that he gave no thoughts at all to the
consequences of his speech. The preceding analysis of
the Dinkelspiel rally makes this a highly dubious
proposition. Although there clearly were discussions of a
"strike" against Stanford University during the rally at
Dinkelspiel and during the early portions of the White
Plaza rally, there is no evidence of preparation for a legal
strike or boycott: no plans for picketing; no direct effort
at persuasion of the workers of the Computation Center
to withhold their labor or for the users of the Center to
boycott the facility. In the present context, the term
"strike" was a kind of euphemism for a broad range of
protest activities, including peaceful, coercive and vio
lent activities. We conclude that Professor Franklin must
reasonably have expected that his advocacy of "shut
down" would be interpreted by at least a substantial
portion of the audience as calling for forceful disruption
of the operation of the Center. Indeed, we believe that
this is what he meant.
CONCLUSION
We conclude that Professor Franklin must reasonably
have expected that his speech at White Plaza on
February 10, 1971, would increase the likelihood of
illegal occupation of the Computation Center immedi
ately following his speech, and that there was risk of
serious damage to the computer and its users. The Board
finds the evidence strongly persuasive that Professor
Franklin urged and incited his audience at White Plaza
towards disruption of University functions and shut
down of the Computation Center. We therefore sustain
charge No. 8.
A. CHARGES
The relevant University charges concerning the White
Plaza incident are contained in Paragraph 8 of the
"Statement of Charges" dated March 22, 1971. This
paragraph reads as follows:
8. On February 10, 1971, beginning at about 12
p.m., a rally was held at White Memorial Plaza to,
among other things, discuss methods of protesting
developments in the war in Indochina. Over tive
humdred students and other persons attended. During
the course of the rally two prinicpal courses of action
were discussed, one being to work in the non-Univer
sity community to bring about changes in govern
ment policy, the other being to disrupt University
functions and business. Professor Franklin intention
ally urged and incited students and other persons
present at the rally to follow the latter course of
action and specifically to shut down a University
computer facility known as the Computation Center.
Shortly thereafter a large number of students and
others left the rally and went to the Computation
Center whereupon many of these persons did in fact
occupy the Computation Center, prevent its opera
tion and obstruct movement in and out of the
building for several hours, terminating this unlawful
activity only when ordered to leave the building by
the police.
B. NATURE OF THE CHARGE
The general charge is that Professor Franklin urged
and incited the disruption of University functions; the
specific charge is that he urged and incited his audience
to shut down a University facility, the Computation
Center. Effectively, this means that his words, including
their delivery and their context, significantly increased
the likelihood of prohibited conduct on the part of his
audience; it means, moreover, that he must have anti
cipated that his speech, given its delivery and context,
would significantly increase the imminent likelihood of
prohibited conduct.
C. FINDINGS OF FACT
/. Prominent Themes in the White Plaza Rally
The noon-hour rally at White Plaza, attended at its
peak by about 700 people, had been proposed the night
before at the conclusion of a rally at Dinkelspiel Audi
torium. Most of the speeches given at the White Plaza
rally were available on tape recordings. Only a portion at
the outset was missing, and this was covered in testi
mony. The following themes emerged prominently in
the course of the White Plaza rally:
a. Many speakers discussed ways of protesting the
war in Southeast Asia. Three speakers, including two
student body leaders, favored an off-cainpus focus of
protest. They were severely criticized by five subsequent
speakers, who characterized liberal war protest in such
terms as "counter-insurgency." This may be illustrated
by the following speech:
Yeah, I'd just like to point out that the only time the
liberals and moderates come out of the woodwork is
when there is radical action on campus. . . .That's the
only way moderates and liberals can, can get off their
asses, is when the people around them are doing these
violent things which you consider to be useless.
b. On four occasions, there was reference to selection
of a protest target on campus; the desirability of alterna
tive possibilities was considered.
c. The Computation Center was referred to often
throughout the meeting. Its suitability as a protest target
was cited. In the final speech of the rally, Professor
Franklin called for shutting down the Computation
Center.
d. Some speakers emphasized Stanford's war com
plicity and the desirability of shutting down the Univer
sity in order to end that complicity.
e. Four speakers made reference to the concept of

different people taking protest action on different levels,
each doing his own thing. Three of these clearly included
coercive and violent behavior within the spectrum of
approved activities, and the fourth is unclear on this
poin<. The following quotations help to clarify this
important theme:
And so closing down Stanford is really a concrete
blow against the war. You see, that's a concrete way
of stopping, stopping things that are going on that
help the war by stopping that kind of research, by
stopping the programs that are run in the computer
center....
It's true that if we're writing letters to congressmen
we're probably not doing that much. But by striking
the University and by taking, by taking whatever
kinds of action we can, you see, on a lot of different
levels, some people may want to take over buildings,
some people will want to boycott class, some people
will want to cause classes to be boycotted, you see
it's not much good if English classes and the French
class aren't going on, but the Business School classes
and the Electronic Engineering classes are going on
and the Department of Defense research contracts are
still being carried out.
KZSU: The crowd is still growing here at White Plaza,
now about 700 people.
[new speaker] What really amazes me is like every
body that's here right now is like obviously against
the war. Now all this friction and all this bullshit
that's going on between radicals and conservatives
and liberals or whoever the fuck it is, it's all just
friction. Now, as long as people who are writing
letters or doing strikes, or breaking windows or what,
everybody's doing their own thing to stop that
fucking war over there. So, everybody do their own
thing, and let's stop that war now and altogether,
[applause]
112. The term "strike" was used several times, though
less than it had been the previous night at the Dinkel
spiel rally. Once again, it seemed to bear little relation to
the meaning of "strike" in labor disputes. Rather, it
seemed to refer to a broad spectrum of activities, some
non-coercive and some coercive. The most prominent
connotation was that of the "mobile strike" introduced
February 9th at Dinkelspiel—closing down one universi
ty facility after another by whatever means proved
feasible.
g. Six speakers made favorable reference to coercive
or violent behavior. This may be illustrated by a
recorded passage from Professor Franklin's speech:
. . .so want to talk about, about high consciousness,
the high consciousness is the consciousness of the
people most oppressed by U.S. imperialism, which
includes as a main institution of that Stanford
University. And that's why whenever people from
that community, whenever poor working class youth
from that community, get a chance to come on the
campus at Stanford and do a little material damage,
they are very eager to do so. Because they recognize
what Stanford University is, even if people here
don't.
2. Summary of Professor Franklin's speech
Professor Franklin gave the closing and longest speech
of the rally. (See Appendix II.) He called for a
willingness to sacrifice in the service of protest activity.
He criticized student body leaders for allegedly subvert
ing the activity of protesters. He gave some of his
personal history in antiwar activity. He cited a poll
indicating that people with little education expressed
more opposition to the war in Southeast Asia than those
with higher levels of education.
At the passage quoted earlier, referring to material
damage by working class youth at Stanford, Professor
Franklin's delivery shifted to a higher intensity, remain

ing at this level until the conclusion. He continued later,
Well, when we talk about, see we're just ripping off
the term strike when talking about striking at
Stanford. This isn't a strike. We're not risking
anything. It's a voluntary boycott—a shutdown of
some of the activities of the University as a demon
stration of something. Now, now what we called a
strike last year, and it lasted really about three days
and it kind of dragged on, and you know, in an odds
and ends way and some people did it. But just the
fact that we were able to move our little finger that
much, that electrified the working people of this
area.. ..
He ended the speech by saying,
See, now what we're asking is for people to make that
little tiny gesture to show that we're willing to
inconvenience ourselves a little bit and to begin to
shut down the most obvious machinery of war, such
as, and I think it is a good target, that Computation
Center, [applause and shouts of "right on. .. ."]
Immediately after Professor Franklin's speech, the
chairman asked for a vote to choose between the
Computation Center and Hoover. About 100 hands
(primarily in front) voted affirmatively on the question
of shutting down the former, whereupon the chairman
announced that a majority favored this course. He said,
"And so I would suggest that we go over there and visit
it." At that point, a voice is heard calling, "Shut it
down," echoing the comment made just before by
Professor Franklin and the meeting's chairman.
As the crowd was leaving they were instructed,
When people go over to the Comp Center, they
should all go in a group and move relatively slowly so
that the group can stay together. Also the meeting at
8 o'clock tonight in the Old Union Courtyard is a
very important meeting because we can decide what
we want to do tomorrow. There are some things that
we can't close down now, but we can close them
down if we get to them early in the morning.
3. Interpretation of the Meaning of Professor Frank
lin 's White Plaza Speech
a. Professor Franklin's Own Interpretation
There were several differing points of view regarding
the meaning of the speech given by Professor Franklin.
Professor Franklin himself in an affidavit dated February
24, 1971 described the meaning of his speech:
Actually, in order to understand either the content of
my speech or that of the rally itself, it is necessary to
see it in relation to the events of the previous evening.
The debate was essentially over the same issues, that
is, whether to focus off campus or call for a strike on
campus, and whether a strike could be effective.
Much of the debate was repetitious of the previous
night, but since most of the people at that meeting
felt bound by the vote, those who had wanted to stop
the munition train did not make their proposal. The
main spokesmen for off-campus work were Bob
Grant and Larry Diamond, who proposed doing
precinct work to elect so-called peace candidates. It
was my belief that these two were not being honest,
and that their main purpose was to prevent any
effective action and to advance their own political
careers. It was with this in mind, plus a sense that
many people were becoming very impatient with the
idle debate of the rally, that I rose to speak. My
intention was, as it had been the previous night, to
build the anti-war movement on the campus. ...
He concluded this portion of the affidavit:
Let's move our little finger again and begin to pick up
where we left off with our strike last spring. Let's
begin to shut down the machinery of war. I think
that the suggested target of the computer center is as
good a place to begin as any. So the content of the
entire speech was to strike against the invasion ol
Laos. In making this speech, and the one on the
preceding night, I thought that I was operating
entirely within the precedent established during the
invasion of Cambodia when the overwhelming majori
ty of the faculty and students of the majority of
departments and schools of the University voted to
go on strike. For instance, my own department on
May 4, 1970 voted overwhelmingly in favor of a
strike for an indefinite period, demanding: 1. An
immediate withdrawal ol all American forces from
Southeast Asia; 2. The end of political repression at
home, in particular the government's systematic
attempt to eliminate the Black Panther and other
political dissidents; 3. The removal of KOTC from
the Stanford campus by the end of the academic
quarter; 4. An end to all war-related and secret
research on the Stanford campus by the end of the
quarter.
In the hearing, he described the meaning of his speech
in essentially similar terms.
b. Hearing Witnesses' Interpretation
University Administration witnesses testified that the
crowd was moved by Professor Franklin's speech and
that he served as a catalyst to get the group moving in
the direction of the Computation Center. One of
Professor Franklin's witnesses felt that the Computation
Center was an appropriate target. He said that a
"shutdown" of the University could range from "blast
various parts of it from the face of Santa Clara County"
to taking over a building as had occurred at Lncina Hall
the year before. One of liis witnesses testified that
Professor Franklin was trying to bring factions together
but didn't influence tactics already decided; two felt the
decision to go to the Computation Center had been
arrived at the night before and the purpose of the speech
was to support a Cambodia-type strike; two thought
Professor Franklin's speech was just educational; two
thought that he was not as influential as a middle-aged
salesman who had spoken earlier; one felt that the
purpose of the White Plaza rally was to choose a target
and to recruit more people.
4. Summary of Principal Points oj Defense
Several prominent elements recurred in defense testi
mony and argument on the White Plaza speech:
(a) A widespread inclination to shut down the
Computation Center, and to carry out a variety of
disruptive activities, was formed over the preceding
several days. It was justified in terms of Stanford's
complicity in the war and the Gamut-H program at
the Computation Center. It was consistent with
long-standing antipathy to the war in Asia and to
Stanford's allegedly vital role in the war. It was
exacerbated by the current news of military action in
Laos.
(b) Such an inclination toward disruptive activity in
general, and toward the Computation Center in
particular, was widespread in and around the Univer
sity, especially in the "movement." The persons
inclined to these actions would have carried them out
regardless of any role Professor Franklin might have
had in encouraging, fostering or facilitating them.
(c) Professor Franklin's speech had little effect on
those present. It was political, analytical, and educa
tional, rather than tactical. It presented no danger to
persons or property.
(d) He was simply advocating a voluntary boycott or
legal strike at the Computation Center. Even if his
speech could be construed as advocating disruption of
the Computation Center, he had in mind no seriously
adverse consequences-only a vigorous mode of pro
test of the war and the University's role in it.
5. Analysis of Professor Franklin's White Plaza
Speech, February 10.
a. Background and Foreseeable Consequences of
Computation Center Occupation
The fact that potential for major damage within the
Computation Center existed must have been well known
to Professor Franklin. The mechanisms to achieve such
damage were thoroughly identified during the Dinkel
spiel meeting the previous night. Highly publicized
computer occupations leading to extensive damage had
recently occurred at other universities. Testimony in
dicates that the decision not to damage the computer in
the face of eviction by the police was taken by the
demonstrators after the occupation was in force. Pro
fessor Franklin could reasonably expect that an occupa
tion of the Computation Center would involve great
risks to the computer and to the members of the
University community who rely upon it, including the
staff of the Computation Center. It should be empha
sized that the research and education of many people
throughout the University were in jeopardy.
In some respects a computer plays a role in a modern
university not unlike that of a library: it receives,
catalogues, processes and stores information and it
makes it available in various forms as required. To attack
a computation center because some of its information is
considered evil is little different from attacking an entire
library for harboring a few evil books. Professor Franklin
should have known that the occupation of the Computa
tion Center would lead to an agonizing decision by the
University administration whether to request police to
evict the occupiers, thereby ending a costly seizure at
the expense of an increased risk of damage.
The demonstrators showed no serious inclination to
consider the genuine complexities of computer use.
They made minimal inquiry about uses of the computer
—considering only on-line medical use, and not investiga
ting even that use thoroughly. They showed no concern
for the relation of the computer to other problems
involving human welfare. As a consequence of their
action, 700 to 800 jobs were not run that day; no one
knows how many more would have been impaired if the
occupiers had not been evicted. The social cost of
vigilante action in regard to computers or similar
facilities can become very high.
We heard no evidence that demonstrators made any
serious attempt to communicate with responsible of
ficers of the University in order to inquire about the
state of the Gamut-H program, or the ways in which
research policies are administered in regard to computer
use, prior to the forceful occupation of the Center.
Indeed, one of Professor Franklin's witnesses testified
that the Gamut-H program was known to the "move
ment" for a week or two, but a decision was made to
delay its announcement pending a favorable moment for
protest activity. The military action in Laos provided
such an opportunity. If the news of Gamut-H could be
held a week or two in private, why was instant action
suddenly required on February 10? Professor Franklin
and his witnesses agreed that advocacy towards shut
down of the Computation Center proceeded on the basis
of publications and statements of The Inquisition;
shutdown of the Computation Center was certainly not

a last resort measure. Thus, a poorly checked complaint
was made public after a tactical delay and then rapidly
shifted into coercive action with only the most rudi
mentary attempt at negotiating the grievance. Finally, in
view of the expressed rationale for forceful occupation
of the Computation Center, it is noteworthy that the
Gamut-H program was not even mentioned at any point
in the lengthy tape recording of the White Plaza rally.
b. The Speech Itself
Professor Franklin urged the Board to consider his
speeches in their full context. He particularly called our
attention to protests at Stanford, to the events of the
preceding few days, and to the Dinkelspiel rally of
February 9. These have been summarized earlier.
Throughout these turbulent events, a persistent differ
ence of opinion is manifested between those who place
primary emphasis on the University's role in the war and
those who place primary emphasis on the role of the
government. Professor Franklin clearly belongs in the
former category. In a Dinkelspiel speech of February 9th
and the White Plaza speech of February 10th, he is
severely critical of the University's role in fostering the
design and execution of the war. He strongly urges his
listeners to direct their attention to the University,
expressing hostility toward its trustees, administration,
and some student body leaders. He views the University
as centrally culpable in the war, and directs attention
away from the federal government. This characterization
of the University has the effect of justifying strong
protest or retaliation.
Within this framework, the "movement" chose to
focus attention on the Computation Center as a symbol
and instrument of the war. The February 9th rally is full
of angry references to the Computation Center—the
culpability of its users, its vulnerability, its suitability for
attack and possibly even for destruction. Professor
Franklin must have been aware of this danger to the
Computation Center-to its functions, its hardware, and
to the large number of people who rely upon it in their
work. These matters had been discussed extensively at
the February 9th rally in which he was an active
participant. He also took part in an investigatory march
that followed the February 9th rally, a preparation for
the likelihood of disruptive action the following day. He
admits in testimony and argument that he gave strong
support to the correctness of action against the Compu
tation Center before, during, and after its occupation,
specifically including the White Plaza rally.
In the main, the purpose of the White Plaza rally of
February 10th appears to have been: (1) to increase the
numbers available for protest activity; (2) to settle
firmly on a target. In respect to (2) the Computation
Center appeared to be the most likely target as a result
of the February 9th meeting, but the Hoover Institution
was still under consideration; two student leaders advo
cated nondisruptive political activity, but they were
strongly criticized by Professor Franklin and others.
Professor Franklin was a highly respected leader of a
group advocating intense hostility to the University as
well as disdain for nondisruptive modes of protest and
for electoral politics. His White Plaza speech contains an
approving reference to material damage to Stanlord
University, and his testimony on these events provides
repeated justification for such damage. At White Plaza
on February 10th, this orientation was brought sharply
to bear on the Computation Center.
It is uncontested that at the White Plaza rally
Professor Franklin concluded his speech by stating
". . .what we are asking is.. .to begin to shut down the
most obvious machinery of war, such as, and I think it is
a good target, that Computation Center.. ." and that
subsequently the Stanford Computation Center, al
though officially declared closed, was forcefully oc
cupied, resulting in shutdown of operation and minor

damage. It is also uncontested that many of the
occupiers were in the audience of Professor Franklin's
speech.
Professor Franklin has also asserted that a firm
decision to shut down the Computation Center was
already reached on February 9, and that therefore his
speech on February 10 could not have contributed to
the subsequent course of events. The evidence does not
support the assertion. The meeting on February 9th held
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium identified a spectrum of
options for action, and two-action against the Hoover
Institution and against the Computation Center-were
left as leading candidates. The preceding summary of
Dinkelspiel (February 9) and White Pla/.a (February 10)
rallies makes this clear. Moreover, several witnesses (both
for the administration and for Professor Franklin)
testified that specific action against the University was
not settled, or that they were undecided whether to
participate in the Computation Center action until they
attended this rally at which Professor Franklin gave the
final speech.
C. Professor Franklin's Use of the Term "Strike "
The Board has found it helpful to pay special
attention to the context for subsequent events provided
by the Dinkelspiel rally of the night of February 9th.
Both the University Administration and Professor Frank
lin devoted considerable attention to this background. In
that connection, we think it important to note that
Professor Franklin himself placed special emphasis dur
ing the hearing on the importance of that rally for
providing context. For that reason, we find the introduc
tion to his own analysis of that topic in this supplemen
tary written brief (page 106) rather unreasonable. He
says"The administration attempts to prove that the real
meaning of Franklin's speech can be found lurking in
several statements gleaned from the lengthy meeting at
Dinkelspiel." If the Administration did so, it was at
Professor Franklin's own invitation.
Our view of the matter is that Professor Franklin was
right the first time: the Dinkelspiel rally does provide
important insights into the speech that follows. It is
analyzed extensively above, in the section on "Back
ground to Events of February 10, 1972." We here
comment on the view presented by Prolessor Franklin in
his supplementary written brief. The main thrust of his
argument is that the rally was a very general discussion,
organized primarily along the lines of planning a strike;
he says (p. 109) "The reason there were no plans for a
picket sign is that there were no plans for anything
beyond a meeting and a general sort of strike." He also
asserts (p. 107) "There was never a real discussion of the
variety of ways the Computer Center could be shut
down except along the general lines of a strike."
In fact, his account tends to select heavily those
speeches from the Dinkelspiel rally that emphasize the
non-coercive aspects of the kind of "strike" he is talking
about. For example, he ignores the following speech
early in the rally:
And so the only reason that we would attack the
University would be on the grounds of effectiveness,
though I would try to direct the demands toward
specific things in the community and that are
attackable like the Computation Center.. . .
In addition, there are two other early calJs to stop
talking and commence action. Later, Braunstein recom
mends a range of actions, including some that lie well
outside the range of legal actions that is subsumed under
the term "strike" when used in its normal context.
Indeed, the term "strike" clearly has a different
meaning to members of the "movement" at Stanford
than it does in ordinary usage. When preceded by the
modifying words "Cambodia-type," it encompasses a

wide range of actions, including some that are legal and
some that are illegal. The introduction of the concept of
a "mobile strike," which takes place well before the end
of the Dinkelspiel rally, was clearly a modification
introduced by numerical considerations: it was argued
that the number of people was inadequate to close a
number of things simultaneously, but that they might
succeed if targets were attacked seriatim. It is clear that
in all of these uses, the term "strike" encompasses a
wide range of activities. In his supplementary written
brief, Professor Franklin borrows the conventional
meaning from the labor context, and then employs it as
a flag in which to wrap a much broader range of
conduct. All of the speakers who spoke late in the rally,
after they had developed some consensus around the
notion of "mobile strike" and were discussing a target,
used language that clearly involves the expectation of
being confronted by the police, moved out of buildings,
and the like. Persuading workers to leave their jobs,
standing in the doorways to bear "moral witness,"
picketing — these activities get little or no prominence in
the discussion, although Professor Franklin tries to
persuade us that these activities are really the dominant
elements of a "strike." The context so established is not
substantially changed, in our view, by the earlier
speakers at the White Plaza rally.
The words "shut it down" imply a cessation of
function that can sometimes be achieved by a strike,
strictly defined, but may be achieved by other means as
well. From a careful reading of the Dinkelspiel trans
cript, we are persuaded that the context for the White
Plaza rally was one in which the prospective shutting
down of the Computation Center was to be achieved
primarily by means going beyond the range of legal
"strike" tactics. We find Professor Franklin's use of the
term "strike" disingenuous, and we believe that his own
exhortation to "shut down" the Computation Center
was, given that context, an intentional invitation to
employ such extra-legal means as might be necessary.
In summary, could Professor Franklin reasonably
have expected that his speech would have contributed to
the likelihood of the occupation? Professor Franklin
asserts that he was only advocating a legal strike or
voluntary boycott of the Computation Center, or
alternatively that he gave no thoughts at all to the
consequences of his speech. The preceding analysis of
the Dinkelspiel rally makes this a highly dubious
proposition. Although there clearly were discussions of a
"strike" against Stanford University during the rally at
Dinkelspiel and during the early portions of the White
Plaza rally, there is no evidence of preparation for a legal
strike or boycott: no plans for picketing; no direct effort
at persuasion of the workers of the Computation Center
to withhold their labor or for the users of the Center to
boycott the facility. In the present context, the term
"strike" was a kind of euphemism for a broad range of
protest activities, including peaceful, coercive and vio
lent activities. We conclude that Professor Franklin must
reasonably have expected that his advocacy of "shut
down" would be interpreted by at least a substantial
portion of the audience as calling for forceful disruption
of the operation of the Center. Indeed, we believe that
this is what he meant.
CONCLUSION
We conclude that Professor Franklin must reasonably
have expected that his speech at White Plaza on
February 10, 1971, would increase the likelihood of
illegal occupation of the Computation Center immedi
ately following his speech, and that there was risk of
serious damage to the computer and its users. The Board
finds the evidence strongly persuasive that Professor
Franklin urged and incited his audience at White Plaza
towards disruption of University functions and shut
down of the Computation Center. We therefore sustain
charge No. 8.
A. CHARGES
The relevant University charges concerning the White
Plaza incident are contained in Paragraph 8 of the
"Statement of Charges" dated March 22, 1971. This
paragraph reads as follows:
8. On February 10, 1971, beginning at about 12
p.m., a rally was held at White Memorial Plaza to,
among other things, discuss methods of protesting
developments in the war in Indochina. Over tive
humdred students and other persons attended. During
the course of the rally two prinicpal courses of action
were discussed, one being to work in the non-Univer
sity community to bring about changes in govern
ment policy, the other being to disrupt University
functions and business. Professor Franklin intention
ally urged and incited students and other persons
present at the rally to follow the latter course of
action and specifically to shut down a University
computer facility known as the Computation Center.
Shortly thereafter a large number of students and
others left the rally and went to the Computation
Center whereupon many of these persons did in fact
occupy the Computation Center, prevent its opera
tion and obstruct movement in and out of the
building for several hours, terminating this unlawful
activity only when ordered to leave the building by
the police.
B. NATURE OF THE CHARGE
The general charge is that Professor Franklin urged
and incited the disruption of University functions; the
specific charge is that he urged and incited his audience
to shut down a University facility, the Computation
Center. Effectively, this means that his words, including
their delivery and their context, significantly increased
the likelihood of prohibited conduct on the part of his
audience; it means, moreover, that he must have anti
cipated that his speech, given its delivery and context,
would significantly increase the imminent likelihood of
prohibited conduct.
C. FINDINGS OF FACT
/. Prominent Themes in the White Plaza Rally
The noon-hour rally at White Plaza, attended at its
peak by about 700 people, had been proposed the night
before at the conclusion of a rally at Dinkelspiel Audi
torium. Most of the speeches given at the White Plaza
rally were available on tape recordings. Only a portion at
the outset was missing, and this was covered in testi
mony. The following themes emerged prominently in
the course of the White Plaza rally:
a. Many speakers discussed ways of protesting the
war in Southeast Asia. Three speakers, including two
student body leaders, favored an off-cainpus focus of
protest. They were severely criticized by five subsequent
speakers, who characterized liberal war protest in such
terms as "counter-insurgency." This may be illustrated
by the following speech:
Yeah, I'd just like to point out that the only time the
liberals and moderates come out of the woodwork is
when there is radical action on campus. . . .That's the
only way moderates and liberals can, can get off their
asses, is when the people around them are doing these
violent things which you consider to be useless.
b. On four occasions, there was reference to selection
of a protest target on campus; the desirability of alterna
tive possibilities was considered.
c. The Computation Center was referred to often
throughout the meeting. Its suitability as a protest target
was cited. In the final speech of the rally, Professor
Franklin called for shutting down the Computation
Center.
d. Some speakers emphasized Stanford's war com
plicity and the desirability of shutting down the Univer
sity in order to end that complicity.
e. Four speakers made reference to the concept of

different people taking protest action on different levels,
each doing his own thing. Three of these clearly included
coercive and violent behavior within the spectrum of
approved activities, and the fourth is unclear on this
poin<. The following quotations help to clarify this
important theme:
And so closing down Stanford is really a concrete
blow against the war. You see, that's a concrete way
of stopping, stopping things that are going on that
help the war by stopping that kind of research, by
stopping the programs that are run in the computer
center....
It's true that if we're writing letters to congressmen
we're probably not doing that much. But by striking
the University and by taking, by taking whatever
kinds of action we can, you see, on a lot of different
levels, some people may want to take over buildings,
some people will want to boycott class, some people
will want to cause classes to be boycotted, you see
it's not much good if English classes and the French
class aren't going on, but the Business School classes
and the Electronic Engineering classes are going on
and the Department of Defense research contracts are
still being carried out.
KZSU: The crowd is still growing here at White Plaza,
now about 700 people.
[new speaker] What really amazes me is like every
body that's here right now is like obviously against
the war. Now all this friction and all this bullshit
that's going on between radicals and conservatives
and liberals or whoever the fuck it is, it's all just
friction. Now, as long as people who are writing
letters or doing strikes, or breaking windows or what,
everybody's doing their own thing to stop that
fucking war over there. So, everybody do their own
thing, and let's stop that war now and altogether,
[applause]
112. The term "strike" was used several times, though
less than it had been the previous night at the Dinkel
spiel rally. Once again, it seemed to bear little relation to
the meaning of "strike" in labor disputes. Rather, it
seemed to refer to a broad spectrum of activities, some
non-coercive and some coercive. The most prominent
connotation was that of the "mobile strike" introduced
February 9th at Dinkelspiel—closing down one universi
ty facility after another by whatever means proved
feasible.
g. Six speakers made favorable reference to coercive
or violent behavior. This may be illustrated by a
recorded passage from Professor Franklin's speech:
. . .so want to talk about, about high consciousness,
the high consciousness is the consciousness of the
people most oppressed by U.S. imperialism, which
includes as a main institution of that Stanford
University. And that's why whenever people from
that community, whenever poor working class youth
from that community, get a chance to come on the
campus at Stanford and do a little material damage,
they are very eager to do so. Because they recognize
what Stanford University is, even if people here
don't.
2. Summary of Professor Franklin's speech
Professor Franklin gave the closing and longest speech
of the rally. (See Appendix II.) He called for a
willingness to sacrifice in the service of protest activity.
He criticized student body leaders for allegedly subvert
ing the activity of protesters. He gave some of his
personal history in antiwar activity. He cited a poll
indicating that people with little education expressed
more opposition to the war in Southeast Asia than those
with higher levels of education.
At the passage quoted earlier, referring to material
damage by working class youth at Stanford, Professor
Franklin's delivery shifted to a higher intensity, remain

ing at this level until the conclusion. He continued later,
Well, when we talk about, see we're just ripping off
the term strike when talking about striking at
Stanford. This isn't a strike. We're not risking
anything. It's a voluntary boycott—a shutdown of
some of the activities of the University as a demon
stration of something. Now, now what we called a
strike last year, and it lasted really about three days
and it kind of dragged on, and you know, in an odds
and ends way and some people did it. But just the
fact that we were able to move our little finger that
much, that electrified the working people of this
area.. ..
He ended the speech by saying,
See, now what we're asking is for people to make that
little tiny gesture to show that we're willing to
inconvenience ourselves a little bit and to begin to
shut down the most obvious machinery of war, such
as, and I think it is a good target, that Computation
Center, [applause and shouts of "right on. .. ."]
Immediately after Professor Franklin's speech, the
chairman asked for a vote to choose between the
Computation Center and Hoover. About 100 hands
(primarily in front) voted affirmatively on the question
of shutting down the former, whereupon the chairman
announced that a majority favored this course. He said,
"And so I would suggest that we go over there and visit
it." At that point, a voice is heard calling, "Shut it
down," echoing the comment made just before by
Professor Franklin and the meeting's chairman.
As the crowd was leaving they were instructed,
When people go over to the Comp Center, they
should all go in a group and move relatively slowly so
that the group can stay together. Also the meeting at
8 o'clock tonight in the Old Union Courtyard is a
very important meeting because we can decide what
we want to do tomorrow. There are some things that
we can't close down now, but we can close them
down if we get to them early in the morning.
3. Interpretation of the Meaning of Professor Frank
lin 's White Plaza Speech
a. Professor Franklin's Own Interpretation
There were several differing points of view regarding
the meaning of the speech given by Professor Franklin.
Professor Franklin himself in an affidavit dated February
24, 1971 described the meaning of his speech:
Actually, in order to understand either the content of
my speech or that of the rally itself, it is necessary to
see it in relation to the events of the previous evening.
The debate was essentially over the same issues, that
is, whether to focus off campus or call for a strike on
campus, and whether a strike could be effective.
Much of the debate was repetitious of the previous
night, but since most of the people at that meeting
felt bound by the vote, those who had wanted to stop
the munition train did not make their proposal. The
main spokesmen for off-campus work were Bob
Grant and Larry Diamond, who proposed doing
precinct work to elect so-called peace candidates. It
was my belief that these two were not being honest,
and that their main purpose was to prevent any
effective action and to advance their own political
careers. It was with this in mind, plus a sense that
many people were becoming very impatient with the
idle debate of the rally, that I rose to speak. My
intention was, as it had been the previous night, to
build the anti-war movement on the campus. ...
He concluded this portion of the affidavit:
Let's move our little finger again and begin to pick up
where we left off with our strike last spring. Let's
begin to shut down the machinery of war. I think
that the suggested target of the computer center is as
good a place to begin as any. So the content of the
entire speech was to strike against the invasion ol
Laos. In making this speech, and the one on the
preceding night, I thought that I was operating
entirely within the precedent established during the
invasion of Cambodia when the overwhelming majori
ty of the faculty and students of the majority of
departments and schools of the University voted to
go on strike. For instance, my own department on
May 4, 1970 voted overwhelmingly in favor of a
strike for an indefinite period, demanding: 1. An
immediate withdrawal ol all American forces from
Southeast Asia; 2. The end of political repression at
home, in particular the government's systematic
attempt to eliminate the Black Panther and other
political dissidents; 3. The removal of KOTC from
the Stanford campus by the end of the academic
quarter; 4. An end to all war-related and secret
research on the Stanford campus by the end of the
quarter.
In the hearing, he described the meaning of his speech
in essentially similar terms.
b. Hearing Witnesses' Interpretation
University Administration witnesses testified that the
crowd was moved by Professor Franklin's speech and
that he served as a catalyst to get the group moving in
the direction of the Computation Center. One of
Professor Franklin's witnesses felt that the Computation
Center was an appropriate target. He said that a
"shutdown" of the University could range from "blast
various parts of it from the face of Santa Clara County"
to taking over a building as had occurred at Lncina Hall
the year before. One of liis witnesses testified that
Professor Franklin was trying to bring factions together
but didn't influence tactics already decided; two felt the
decision to go to the Computation Center had been
arrived at the night before and the purpose of the speech
was to support a Cambodia-type strike; two thought
Professor Franklin's speech was just educational; two
thought that he was not as influential as a middle-aged
salesman who had spoken earlier; one felt that the
purpose of the White Plaza rally was to choose a target
and to recruit more people.
4. Summary of Principal Points oj Defense
Several prominent elements recurred in defense testi
mony and argument on the White Plaza speech:
(a) A widespread inclination to shut down the
Computation Center, and to carry out a variety of
disruptive activities, was formed over the preceding
several days. It was justified in terms of Stanford's
complicity in the war and the Gamut-H program at
the Computation Center. It was consistent with
long-standing antipathy to the war in Asia and to
Stanford's allegedly vital role in the war. It was
exacerbated by the current news of military action in
Laos.
(b) Such an inclination toward disruptive activity in
general, and toward the Computation Center in
particular, was widespread in and around the Univer
sity, especially in the "movement." The persons
inclined to these actions would have carried them out
regardless of any role Professor Franklin might have
had in encouraging, fostering or facilitating them.
(c) Professor Franklin's speech had little effect on
those present. It was political, analytical, and educa
tional, rather than tactical. It presented no danger to
persons or property.
(d) He was simply advocating a voluntary boycott or
legal strike at the Computation Center. Even if his
speech could be construed as advocating disruption of
the Computation Center, he had in mind no seriously
adverse consequences-only a vigorous mode of pro
test of the war and the University's role in it.
5. Analysis of Professor Franklin's White Plaza
Speech, February 10.
a. Background and Foreseeable Consequences of
Computation Center Occupation
The fact that potential for major damage within the
Computation Center existed must have been well known
to Professor Franklin. The mechanisms to achieve such
damage were thoroughly identified during the Dinkel
spiel meeting the previous night. Highly publicized
computer occupations leading to extensive damage had
recently occurred at other universities. Testimony in
dicates that the decision not to damage the computer in
the face of eviction by the police was taken by the
demonstrators after the occupation was in force. Pro
fessor Franklin could reasonably expect that an occupa
tion of the Computation Center would involve great
risks to the computer and to the members of the
University community who rely upon it, including the
staff of the Computation Center. It should be empha
sized that the research and education of many people
throughout the University were in jeopardy.
In some respects a computer plays a role in a modern
university not unlike that of a library: it receives,
catalogues, processes and stores information and it
makes it available in various forms as required. To attack
a computation center because some of its information is
considered evil is little different from attacking an entire
library for harboring a few evil books. Professor Franklin
should have known that the occupation of the Computa
tion Center would lead to an agonizing decision by the
University administration whether to request police to
evict the occupiers, thereby ending a costly seizure at
the expense of an increased risk of damage.
The demonstrators showed no serious inclination to
consider the genuine complexities of computer use.
They made minimal inquiry about uses of the computer
—considering only on-line medical use, and not investiga
ting even that use thoroughly. They showed no concern
for the relation of the computer to other problems
involving human welfare. As a consequence of their
action, 700 to 800 jobs were not run that day; no one
knows how many more would have been impaired if the
occupiers had not been evicted. The social cost of
vigilante action in regard to computers or similar
facilities can become very high.
We heard no evidence that demonstrators made any
serious attempt to communicate with responsible of
ficers of the University in order to inquire about the
state of the Gamut-H program, or the ways in which
research policies are administered in regard to computer
use, prior to the forceful occupation of the Center.
Indeed, one of Professor Franklin's witnesses testified
that the Gamut-H program was known to the "move
ment" for a week or two, but a decision was made to
delay its announcement pending a favorable moment for
protest activity. The military action in Laos provided
such an opportunity. If the news of Gamut-H could be
held a week or two in private, why was instant action
suddenly required on February 10? Professor Franklin
and his witnesses agreed that advocacy towards shut
down of the Computation Center proceeded on the basis
of publications and statements of The Inquisition;
shutdown of the Computation Center was certainly not

a last resort measure. Thus, a poorly checked complaint
was made public after a tactical delay and then rapidly
shifted into coercive action with only the most rudi
mentary attempt at negotiating the grievance. Finally, in
view of the expressed rationale for forceful occupation
of the Computation Center, it is noteworthy that the
Gamut-H program was not even mentioned at any point
in the lengthy tape recording of the White Plaza rally.
b. The Speech Itself
Professor Franklin urged the Board to consider his
speeches in their full context. He particularly called our
attention to protests at Stanford, to the events of the
preceding few days, and to the Dinkelspiel rally of
February 9. These have been summarized earlier.
Throughout these turbulent events, a persistent differ
ence of opinion is manifested between those who place
primary emphasis on the University's role in the war and
those who place primary emphasis on the role of the
government. Professor Franklin clearly belongs in the
former category. In a Dinkelspiel speech of February 9th
and the White Plaza speech of February 10th, he is
severely critical of the University's role in fostering the
design and execution of the war. He strongly urges his
listeners to direct their attention to the University,
expressing hostility toward its trustees, administration,
and some student body leaders. He views the University
as centrally culpable in the war, and directs attention
away from the federal government. This characterization
of the University has the effect of justifying strong
protest or retaliation.
Within this framework, the "movement" chose to
focus attention on the Computation Center as a symbol
and instrument of the war. The February 9th rally is full
of angry references to the Computation Center—the
culpability of its users, its vulnerability, its suitability for
attack and possibly even for destruction. Professor
Franklin must have been aware of this danger to the
Computation Center-to its functions, its hardware, and
to the large number of people who rely upon it in their
work. These matters had been discussed extensively at
the February 9th rally in which he was an active
participant. He also took part in an investigatory march
that followed the February 9th rally, a preparation for
the likelihood of disruptive action the following day. He
admits in testimony and argument that he gave strong
support to the correctness of action against the Compu
tation Center before, during, and after its occupation,
specifically including the White Plaza rally.
In the main, the purpose of the White Plaza rally of
February 10th appears to have been: (1) to increase the
numbers available for protest activity; (2) to settle
firmly on a target. In respect to (2) the Computation
Center appeared to be the most likely target as a result
of the February 9th meeting, but the Hoover Institution
was still under consideration; two student leaders advo
cated nondisruptive political activity, but they were
strongly criticized by Professor Franklin and others.
Professor Franklin was a highly respected leader of a
group advocating intense hostility to the University as
well as disdain for nondisruptive modes of protest and
for electoral politics. His White Plaza speech contains an
approving reference to material damage to Stanlord
University, and his testimony on these events provides
repeated justification for such damage. At White Plaza
on February 10th, this orientation was brought sharply
to bear on the Computation Center.
It is uncontested that at the White Plaza rally
Professor Franklin concluded his speech by stating
". . .what we are asking is.. .to begin to shut down the
most obvious machinery of war, such as, and I think it is
a good target, that Computation Center.. ." and that
subsequently the Stanford Computation Center, al
though officially declared closed, was forcefully oc
cupied, resulting in shutdown of operation and minor

damage. It is also uncontested that many of the
occupiers were in the audience of Professor Franklin's
speech.
Professor Franklin has also asserted that a firm
decision to shut down the Computation Center was
already reached on February 9, and that therefore his
speech on February 10 could not have contributed to
the subsequent course of events. The evidence does not
support the assertion. The meeting on February 9th held
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium identified a spectrum of
options for action, and two-action against the Hoover
Institution and against the Computation Center-were
left as leading candidates. The preceding summary of
Dinkelspiel (February 9) and White Pla/.a (February 10)
rallies makes this clear. Moreover, several witnesses (both
for the administration and for Professor Franklin)
testified that specific action against the University was
not settled, or that they were undecided whether to
participate in the Computation Center action until they
attended this rally at which Professor Franklin gave the
final speech.
C. Professor Franklin's Use of the Term "Strike "
The Board has found it helpful to pay special
attention to the context for subsequent events provided
by the Dinkelspiel rally of the night of February 9th.
Both the University Administration and Professor Frank
lin devoted considerable attention to this background. In
that connection, we think it important to note that
Professor Franklin himself placed special emphasis dur
ing the hearing on the importance of that rally for
providing context. For that reason, we find the introduc
tion to his own analysis of that topic in this supplemen
tary written brief (page 106) rather unreasonable. He
says"The administration attempts to prove that the real
meaning of Franklin's speech can be found lurking in
several statements gleaned from the lengthy meeting at
Dinkelspiel." If the Administration did so, it was at
Professor Franklin's own invitation.
Our view of the matter is that Professor Franklin was
right the first time: the Dinkelspiel rally does provide
important insights into the speech that follows. It is
analyzed extensively above, in the section on "Back
ground to Events of February 10, 1972." We here
comment on the view presented by Prolessor Franklin in
his supplementary written brief. The main thrust of his
argument is that the rally was a very general discussion,
organized primarily along the lines of planning a strike;
he says (p. 109) "The reason there were no plans for a
picket sign is that there were no plans for anything
beyond a meeting and a general sort of strike." He also
asserts (p. 107) "There was never a real discussion of the
variety of ways the Computer Center could be shut
down except along the general lines of a strike."
In fact, his account tends to select heavily those
speeches from the Dinkelspiel rally that emphasize the
non-coercive aspects of the kind of "strike" he is talking
about. For example, he ignores the following speech
early in the rally:
And so the only reason that we would attack the
University would be on the grounds of effectiveness,
though I would try to direct the demands toward
specific things in the community and that are
attackable like the Computation Center.. . .
In addition, there are two other early calJs to stop
talking and commence action. Later, Braunstein recom
mends a range of actions, including some that lie well
outside the range of legal actions that is subsumed under
the term "strike" when used in its normal context.
Indeed, the term "strike" clearly has a different
meaning to members of the "movement" at Stanford
than it does in ordinary usage. When preceded by the
modifying words "Cambodia-type," it encompasses a

wide range of actions, including some that are legal and
some that are illegal. The introduction of the concept of
a "mobile strike," which takes place well before the end
of the Dinkelspiel rally, was clearly a modification
introduced by numerical considerations: it was argued
that the number of people was inadequate to close a
number of things simultaneously, but that they might
succeed if targets were attacked seriatim. It is clear that
in all of these uses, the term "strike" encompasses a
wide range of activities. In his supplementary written
brief, Professor Franklin borrows the conventional
meaning from the labor context, and then employs it as
a flag in which to wrap a much broader range of
conduct. All of the speakers who spoke late in the rally,
after they had developed some consensus around the
notion of "mobile strike" and were discussing a target,
used language that clearly involves the expectation of
being confronted by the police, moved out of buildings,
and the like. Persuading workers to leave their jobs,
standing in the doorways to bear "moral witness,"
picketing — these activities get little or no prominence in
the discussion, although Professor Franklin tries to
persuade us that these activities are really the dominant
elements of a "strike." The context so established is not
substantially changed, in our view, by the earlier
speakers at the White Plaza rally.
The words "shut it down" imply a cessation of
function that can sometimes be achieved by a strike,
strictly defined, but may be achieved by other means as
well. From a careful reading of the Dinkelspiel trans
cript, we are persuaded that the context for the White
Plaza rally was one in which the prospective shutting
down of the Computation Center was to be achieved
primarily by means going beyond the range of legal
"strike" tactics. We find Professor Franklin's use of the
term "strike" disingenuous, and we believe that his own
exhortation to "shut down" the Computation Center
was, given that context, an intentional invitation to
employ such extra-legal means as might be necessary.
In summary, could Professor Franklin reasonably
have expected that his speech would have contributed to
the likelihood of the occupation? Professor Franklin
asserts that he was only advocating a legal strike or
voluntary boycott of the Computation Center, or
alternatively that he gave no thoughts at all to the
consequences of his speech. The preceding analysis of
the Dinkelspiel rally makes this a highly dubious
proposition. Although there clearly were discussions of a
"strike" against Stanford University during the rally at
Dinkelspiel and during the early portions of the White
Plaza rally, there is no evidence of preparation for a legal
strike or boycott: no plans for picketing; no direct effort
at persuasion of the workers of the Computation Center
to withhold their labor or for the users of the Center to
boycott the facility. In the present context, the term
"strike" was a kind of euphemism for a broad range of
protest activities, including peaceful, coercive and vio
lent activities. We conclude that Professor Franklin must
reasonably have expected that his advocacy of "shut
down" would be interpreted by at least a substantial
portion of the audience as calling for forceful disruption
of the operation of the Center. Indeed, we believe that
this is what he meant.
CONCLUSION
We conclude that Professor Franklin must reasonably
have expected that his speech at White Plaza on
February 10, 1971, would increase the likelihood of
illegal occupation of the Computation Center immedi
ately following his speech, and that there was risk of
serious damage to the computer and its users. The Board
finds the evidence strongly persuasive that Professor
Franklin urged and incited his audience at White Plaza
towards disruption of University functions and shut
down of the Computation Center. We therefore sustain
charge No. 8.
A. CHARGES
The relevant University charges concerning the White
Plaza incident are contained in Paragraph 8 of the
"Statement of Charges" dated March 22, 1971. This
paragraph reads as follows:
8. On February 10, 1971, beginning at about 12
p.m., a rally was held at White Memorial Plaza to,
among other things, discuss methods of protesting
developments in the war in Indochina. Over tive
humdred students and other persons attended. During
the course of the rally two prinicpal courses of action
were discussed, one being to work in the non-Univer
sity community to bring about changes in govern
ment policy, the other being to disrupt University
functions and business. Professor Franklin intention
ally urged and incited students and other persons
present at the rally to follow the latter course of
action and specifically to shut down a University
computer facility known as the Computation Center.
Shortly thereafter a large number of students and
others left the rally and went to the Computation
Center whereupon many of these persons did in fact
occupy the Computation Center, prevent its opera
tion and obstruct movement in and out of the
building for several hours, terminating this unlawful
activity only when ordered to leave the building by
the police.
B. NATURE OF THE CHARGE
The general charge is that Professor Franklin urged
and incited the disruption of University functions; the
specific charge is that he urged and incited his audience
to shut down a University facility, the Computation
Center. Effectively, this means that his words, including
their delivery and their context, significantly increased
the likelihood of prohibited conduct on the part of his
audience; it means, moreover, that he must have anti
cipated that his speech, given its delivery and context,
would significantly increase the imminent likelihood of
prohibited conduct.
C. FINDINGS OF FACT
/. Prominent Themes in the White Plaza Rally
The noon-hour rally at White Plaza, attended at its
peak by about 700 people, had been proposed the night
before at the conclusion of a rally at Dinkelspiel Audi
torium. Most of the speeches given at the White Plaza
rally were available on tape recordings. Only a portion at
the outset was missing, and this was covered in testi
mony. The following themes emerged prominently in
the course of the White Plaza rally:
a. Many speakers discussed ways of protesting the
war in Southeast Asia. Three speakers, including two
student body leaders, favored an off-cainpus focus of
protest. They were severely criticized by five subsequent
speakers, who characterized liberal war protest in such
terms as "counter-insurgency." This may be illustrated
by the following speech:
Yeah, I'd just like to point out that the only time the
liberals and moderates come out of the woodwork is
when there is radical action on campus. . . .That's the
only way moderates and liberals can, can get off their
asses, is when the people around them are doing these
violent things which you consider to be useless.
b. On four occasions, there was reference to selection
of a protest target on campus; the desirability of alterna
tive possibilities was considered.
c. The Computation Center was referred to often
throughout the meeting. Its suitability as a protest target
was cited. In the final speech of the rally, Professor
Franklin called for shutting down the Computation
Center.
d. Some speakers emphasized Stanford's war com
plicity and the desirability of shutting down the Univer
sity in order to end that complicity.
e. Four speakers made reference to the concept of

different people taking protest action on different levels,
each doing his own thing. Three of these clearly included
coercive and violent behavior within the spectrum of
approved activities, and the fourth is unclear on this
poin<. The following quotations help to clarify this
important theme:
And so closing down Stanford is really a concrete
blow against the war. You see, that's a concrete way
of stopping, stopping things that are going on that
help the war by stopping that kind of research, by
stopping the programs that are run in the computer
center....
It's true that if we're writing letters to congressmen
we're probably not doing that much. But by striking
the University and by taking, by taking whatever
kinds of action we can, you see, on a lot of different
levels, some people may want to take over buildings,
some people will want to boycott class, some people
will want to cause classes to be boycotted, you see
it's not much good if English classes and the French
class aren't going on, but the Business School classes
and the Electronic Engineering classes are going on
and the Department of Defense research contracts are
still being carried out.
KZSU: The crowd is still growing here at White Plaza,
now about 700 people.
[new speaker] What really amazes me is like every
body that's here right now is like obviously against
the war. Now all this friction and all this bullshit
that's going on between radicals and conservatives
and liberals or whoever the fuck it is, it's all just
friction. Now, as long as people who are writing
letters or doing strikes, or breaking windows or what,
everybody's doing their own thing to stop that
fucking war over there. So, everybody do their own
thing, and let's stop that war now and altogether,
[applause]
112. The term "strike" was used several times, though
less than it had been the previous night at the Dinkel
spiel rally. Once again, it seemed to bear little relation to
the meaning of "strike" in labor disputes. Rather, it
seemed to refer to a broad spectrum of activities, some
non-coercive and some coercive. The most prominent
connotation was that of the "mobile strike" introduced
February 9th at Dinkelspiel—closing down one universi
ty facility after another by whatever means proved
feasible.
g. Six speakers made favorable reference to coercive
or violent behavior. This may be illustrated by a
recorded passage from Professor Franklin's speech:
. . .so want to talk about, about high consciousness,
the high consciousness is the consciousness of the
people most oppressed by U.S. imperialism, which
includes as a main institution of that Stanford
University. And that's why whenever people from
that community, whenever poor working class youth
from that community, get a chance to come on the
campus at Stanford and do a little material damage,
they are very eager to do so. Because they recognize
what Stanford University is, even if people here
don't.
2. Summary of Professor Franklin's speech
Professor Franklin gave the closing and longest speech
of the rally. (See Appendix II.) He called for a
willingness to sacrifice in the service of protest activity.
He criticized student body leaders for allegedly subvert
ing the activity of protesters. He gave some of his
personal history in antiwar activity. He cited a poll
indicating that people with little education expressed
more opposition to the war in Southeast Asia than those
with higher levels of education.
At the passage quoted earlier, referring to material
damage by working class youth at Stanford, Professor
Franklin's delivery shifted to a higher intensity, remain

ing at this level until the conclusion. He continued later,
Well, when we talk about, see we're just ripping off
the term strike when talking about striking at
Stanford. This isn't a strike. We're not risking
anything. It's a voluntary boycott—a shutdown of
some of the activities of the University as a demon
stration of something. Now, now what we called a
strike last year, and it lasted really about three days
and it kind of dragged on, and you know, in an odds
and ends way and some people did it. But just the
fact that we were able to move our little finger that
much, that electrified the working people of this
area.. ..
He ended the speech by saying,
See, now what we're asking is for people to make that
little tiny gesture to show that we're willing to
inconvenience ourselves a little bit and to begin to
shut down the most obvious machinery of war, such
as, and I think it is a good target, that Computation
Center, [applause and shouts of "right on. .. ."]
Immediately after Professor Franklin's speech, the
chairman asked for a vote to choose between the
Computation Center and Hoover. About 100 hands
(primarily in front) voted affirmatively on the question
of shutting down the former, whereupon the chairman
announced that a majority favored this course. He said,
"And so I would suggest that we go over there and visit
it." At that point, a voice is heard calling, "Shut it
down," echoing the comment made just before by
Professor Franklin and the meeting's chairman.
As the crowd was leaving they were instructed,
When people go over to the Comp Center, they
should all go in a group and move relatively slowly so
that the group can stay together. Also the meeting at
8 o'clock tonight in the Old Union Courtyard is a
very important meeting because we can decide what
we want to do tomorrow. There are some things that
we can't close down now, but we can close them
down if we get to them early in the morning.
3. Interpretation of the Meaning of Professor Frank
lin 's White Plaza Speech
a. Professor Franklin's Own Interpretation
There were several differing points of view regarding
the meaning of the speech given by Professor Franklin.
Professor Franklin himself in an affidavit dated February
24, 1971 described the meaning of his speech:
Actually, in order to understand either the content of
my speech or that of the rally itself, it is necessary to
see it in relation to the events of the previous evening.
The debate was essentially over the same issues, that
is, whether to focus off campus or call for a strike on
campus, and whether a strike could be effective.
Much of the debate was repetitious of the previous
night, but since most of the people at that meeting
felt bound by the vote, those who had wanted to stop
the munition train did not make their proposal. The
main spokesmen for off-campus work were Bob
Grant and Larry Diamond, who proposed doing
precinct work to elect so-called peace candidates. It
was my belief that these two were not being honest,
and that their main purpose was to prevent any
effective action and to advance their own political
careers. It was with this in mind, plus a sense that
many people were becoming very impatient with the
idle debate of the rally, that I rose to speak. My
intention was, as it had been the previous night, to
build the anti-war movement on the campus. ...
He concluded this portion of the affidavit:
Let's move our little finger again and begin to pick up
where we left off with our strike last spring. Let's
begin to shut down the machinery of war. I think
that the suggested target of the computer center is as
good a place to begin as any. So the content of the
entire speech was to strike against the invasion ol
Laos. In making this speech, and the one on the
preceding night, I thought that I was operating
entirely within the precedent established during the
invasion of Cambodia when the overwhelming majori
ty of the faculty and students of the majority of
departments and schools of the University voted to
go on strike. For instance, my own department on
May 4, 1970 voted overwhelmingly in favor of a
strike for an indefinite period, demanding: 1. An
immediate withdrawal ol all American forces from
Southeast Asia; 2. The end of political repression at
home, in particular the government's systematic
attempt to eliminate the Black Panther and other
political dissidents; 3. The removal of KOTC from
the Stanford campus by the end of the academic
quarter; 4. An end to all war-related and secret
research on the Stanford campus by the end of the
quarter.
In the hearing, he described the meaning of his speech
in essentially similar terms.
b. Hearing Witnesses' Interpretation
University Administration witnesses testified that the
crowd was moved by Professor Franklin's speech and
that he served as a catalyst to get the group moving in
the direction of the Computation Center. One of
Professor Franklin's witnesses felt that the Computation
Center was an appropriate target. He said that a
"shutdown" of the University could range from "blast
various parts of it from the face of Santa Clara County"
to taking over a building as had occurred at Lncina Hall
the year before. One of liis witnesses testified that
Professor Franklin was trying to bring factions together
but didn't influence tactics already decided; two felt the
decision to go to the Computation Center had been
arrived at the night before and the purpose of the speech
was to support a Cambodia-type strike; two thought
Professor Franklin's speech was just educational; two
thought that he was not as influential as a middle-aged
salesman who had spoken earlier; one felt that the
purpose of the White Plaza rally was to choose a target
and to recruit more people.
4. Summary of Principal Points oj Defense
Several prominent elements recurred in defense testi
mony and argument on the White Plaza speech:
(a) A widespread inclination to shut down the
Computation Center, and to carry out a variety of
disruptive activities, was formed over the preceding
several days. It was justified in terms of Stanford's
complicity in the war and the Gamut-H program at
the Computation Center. It was consistent with
long-standing antipathy to the war in Asia and to
Stanford's allegedly vital role in the war. It was
exacerbated by the current news of military action in
Laos.
(b) Such an inclination toward disruptive activity in
general, and toward the Computation Center in
particular, was widespread in and around the Univer
sity, especially in the "movement." The persons
inclined to these actions would have carried them out
regardless of any role Professor Franklin might have
had in encouraging, fostering or facilitating them.
(c) Professor Franklin's speech had little effect on
those present. It was political, analytical, and educa
tional, rather than tactical. It presented no danger to
persons or property.
(d) He was simply advocating a voluntary boycott or
legal strike at the Computation Center. Even if his
speech could be construed as advocating disruption of
the Computation Center, he had in mind no seriously
adverse consequences-only a vigorous mode of pro
test of the war and the University's role in it.
5. Analysis of Professor Franklin's White Plaza
Speech, February 10.
a. Background and Foreseeable Consequences of
Computation Center Occupation
The fact that potential for major damage within the
Computation Center existed must have been well known
to Professor Franklin. The mechanisms to achieve such
damage were thoroughly identified during the Dinkel
spiel meeting the previous night. Highly publicized
computer occupations leading to extensive damage had
recently occurred at other universities. Testimony in
dicates that the decision not to damage the computer in
the face of eviction by the police was taken by the
demonstrators after the occupation was in force. Pro
fessor Franklin could reasonably expect that an occupa
tion of the Computation Center would involve great
risks to the computer and to the members of the
University community who rely upon it, including the
staff of the Computation Center. It should be empha
sized that the research and education of many people
throughout the University were in jeopardy.
In some respects a computer plays a role in a modern
university not unlike that of a library: it receives,
catalogues, processes and stores information and it
makes it available in various forms as required. To attack
a computation center because some of its information is
considered evil is little different from attacking an entire
library for harboring a few evil books. Professor Franklin
should have known that the occupation of the Computa
tion Center would lead to an agonizing decision by the
University administration whether to request police to
evict the occupiers, thereby ending a costly seizure at
the expense of an increased risk of damage.
The demonstrators showed no serious inclination to
consider the genuine complexities of computer use.
They made minimal inquiry about uses of the computer
—considering only on-line medical use, and not investiga
ting even that use thoroughly. They showed no concern
for the relation of the computer to other problems
involving human welfare. As a consequence of their
action, 700 to 800 jobs were not run that day; no one
knows how many more would have been impaired if the
occupiers had not been evicted. The social cost of
vigilante action in regard to computers or similar
facilities can become very high.
We heard no evidence that demonstrators made any
serious attempt to communicate with responsible of
ficers of the University in order to inquire about the
state of the Gamut-H program, or the ways in which
research policies are administered in regard to computer
use, prior to the forceful occupation of the Center.
Indeed, one of Professor Franklin's witnesses testified
that the Gamut-H program was known to the "move
ment" for a week or two, but a decision was made to
delay its announcement pending a favorable moment for
protest activity. The military action in Laos provided
such an opportunity. If the news of Gamut-H could be
held a week or two in private, why was instant action
suddenly required on February 10? Professor Franklin
and his witnesses agreed that advocacy towards shut
down of the Computation Center proceeded on the basis
of publications and statements of The Inquisition;
shutdown of the Computation Center was certainly not

a last resort measure. Thus, a poorly checked complaint
was made public after a tactical delay and then rapidly
shifted into coercive action with only the most rudi
mentary attempt at negotiating the grievance. Finally, in
view of the expressed rationale for forceful occupation
of the Computation Center, it is noteworthy that the
Gamut-H program was not even mentioned at any point
in the lengthy tape recording of the White Plaza rally.
b. The Speech Itself
Professor Franklin urged the Board to consider his
speeches in their full context. He particularly called our
attention to protests at Stanford, to the events of the
preceding few days, and to the Dinkelspiel rally of
February 9. These have been summarized earlier.
Throughout these turbulent events, a persistent differ
ence of opinion is manifested between those who place
primary emphasis on the University's role in the war and
those who place primary emphasis on the role of the
government. Professor Franklin clearly belongs in the
former category. In a Dinkelspiel speech of February 9th
and the White Plaza speech of February 10th, he is
severely critical of the University's role in fostering the
design and execution of the war. He strongly urges his
listeners to direct their attention to the University,
expressing hostility toward its trustees, administration,
and some student body leaders. He views the University
as centrally culpable in the war, and directs attention
away from the federal government. This characterization
of the University has the effect of justifying strong
protest or retaliation.
Within this framework, the "movement" chose to
focus attention on the Computation Center as a symbol
and instrument of the war. The February 9th rally is full
of angry references to the Computation Center—the
culpability of its users, its vulnerability, its suitability for
attack and possibly even for destruction. Professor
Franklin must have been aware of this danger to the
Computation Center-to its functions, its hardware, and
to the large number of people who rely upon it in their
work. These matters had been discussed extensively at
the February 9th rally in which he was an active
participant. He also took part in an investigatory march
that followed the February 9th rally, a preparation for
the likelihood of disruptive action the following day. He
admits in testimony and argument that he gave strong
support to the correctness of action against the Compu
tation Center before, during, and after its occupation,
specifically including the White Plaza rally.
In the main, the purpose of the White Plaza rally of
February 10th appears to have been: (1) to increase the
numbers available for protest activity; (2) to settle
firmly on a target. In respect to (2) the Computation
Center appeared to be the most likely target as a result
of the February 9th meeting, but the Hoover Institution
was still under consideration; two student leaders advo
cated nondisruptive political activity, but they were
strongly criticized by Professor Franklin and others.
Professor Franklin was a highly respected leader of a
group advocating intense hostility to the University as
well as disdain for nondisruptive modes of protest and
for electoral politics. His White Plaza speech contains an
approving reference to material damage to Stanlord
University, and his testimony on these events provides
repeated justification for such damage. At White Plaza
on February 10th, this orientation was brought sharply
to bear on the Computation Center.
It is uncontested that at the White Plaza rally
Professor Franklin concluded his speech by stating
". . .what we are asking is.. .to begin to shut down the
most obvious machinery of war, such as, and I think it is
a good target, that Computation Center.. ." and that
subsequently the Stanford Computation Center, al
though officially declared closed, was forcefully oc
cupied, resulting in shutdown of operation and minor

damage. It is also uncontested that many of the
occupiers were in the audience of Professor Franklin's
speech.
Professor Franklin has also asserted that a firm
decision to shut down the Computation Center was
already reached on February 9, and that therefore his
speech on February 10 could not have contributed to
the subsequent course of events. The evidence does not
support the assertion. The meeting on February 9th held
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium identified a spectrum of
options for action, and two-action against the Hoover
Institution and against the Computation Center-were
left as leading candidates. The preceding summary of
Dinkelspiel (February 9) and White Pla/.a (February 10)
rallies makes this clear. Moreover, several witnesses (both
for the administration and for Professor Franklin)
testified that specific action against the University was
not settled, or that they were undecided whether to
participate in the Computation Center action until they
attended this rally at which Professor Franklin gave the
final speech.
C. Professor Franklin's Use of the Term "Strike "
The Board has found it helpful to pay special
attention to the context for subsequent events provided
by the Dinkelspiel rally of the night of February 9th.
Both the University Administration and Professor Frank
lin devoted considerable attention to this background. In
that connection, we think it important to note that
Professor Franklin himself placed special emphasis dur
ing the hearing on the importance of that rally for
providing context. For that reason, we find the introduc
tion to his own analysis of that topic in this supplemen
tary written brief (page 106) rather unreasonable. He
says"The administration attempts to prove that the real
meaning of Franklin's speech can be found lurking in
several statements gleaned from the lengthy meeting at
Dinkelspiel." If the Administration did so, it was at
Professor Franklin's own invitation.
Our view of the matter is that Professor Franklin was
right the first time: the Dinkelspiel rally does provide
important insights into the speech that follows. It is
analyzed extensively above, in the section on "Back
ground to Events of February 10, 1972." We here
comment on the view presented by Prolessor Franklin in
his supplementary written brief. The main thrust of his
argument is that the rally was a very general discussion,
organized primarily along the lines of planning a strike;
he says (p. 109) "The reason there were no plans for a
picket sign is that there were no plans for anything
beyond a meeting and a general sort of strike." He also
asserts (p. 107) "There was never a real discussion of the
variety of ways the Computer Center could be shut
down except along the general lines of a strike."
In fact, his account tends to select heavily those
speeches from the Dinkelspiel rally that emphasize the
non-coercive aspects of the kind of "strike" he is talking
about. For example, he ignores the following speech
early in the rally:
And so the only reason that we would attack the
University would be on the grounds of effectiveness,
though I would try to direct the demands toward
specific things in the community and that are
attackable like the Computation Center.. . .
In addition, there are two other early calJs to stop
talking and commence action. Later, Braunstein recom
mends a range of actions, including some that lie well
outside the range of legal actions that is subsumed under
the term "strike" when used in its normal context.
Indeed, the term "strike" clearly has a different
meaning to members of the "movement" at Stanford
than it does in ordinary usage. When preceded by the
modifying words "Cambodia-type," it encompasses a

wide range of actions, including some that are legal and
some that are illegal. The introduction of the concept of
a "mobile strike," which takes place well before the end
of the Dinkelspiel rally, was clearly a modification
introduced by numerical considerations: it was argued
that the number of people was inadequate to close a
number of things simultaneously, but that they might
succeed if targets were attacked seriatim. It is clear that
in all of these uses, the term "strike" encompasses a
wide range of activities. In his supplementary written
brief, Professor Franklin borrows the conventional
meaning from the labor context, and then employs it as
a flag in which to wrap a much broader range of
conduct. All of the speakers who spoke late in the rally,
after they had developed some consensus around the
notion of "mobile strike" and were discussing a target,
used language that clearly involves the expectation of
being confronted by the police, moved out of buildings,
and the like. Persuading workers to leave their jobs,
standing in the doorways to bear "moral witness,"
picketing — these activities get little or no prominence in
the discussion, although Professor Franklin tries to
persuade us that these activities are really the dominant
elements of a "strike." The context so established is not
substantially changed, in our view, by the earlier
speakers at the White Plaza rally.
The words "shut it down" imply a cessation of
function that can sometimes be achieved by a strike,
strictly defined, but may be achieved by other means as
well. From a careful reading of the Dinkelspiel trans
cript, we are persuaded that the context for the White
Plaza rally was one in which the prospective shutting
down of the Computation Center was to be achieved
primarily by means going beyond the range of legal
"strike" tactics. We find Professor Franklin's use of the
term "strike" disingenuous, and we believe that his own
exhortation to "shut down" the Computation Center
was, given that context, an intentional invitation to
employ such extra-legal means as might be necessary.
In summary, could Professor Franklin reasonably
have expected that his speech would have contributed to
the likelihood of the occupation? Professor Franklin
asserts that he was only advocating a legal strike or
voluntary boycott of the Computation Center, or
alternatively that he gave no thoughts at all to the
consequences of his speech. The preceding analysis of
the Dinkelspiel rally makes this a highly dubious
proposition. Although there clearly were discussions of a
"strike" against Stanford University during the rally at
Dinkelspiel and during the early portions of the White
Plaza rally, there is no evidence of preparation for a legal
strike or boycott: no plans for picketing; no direct effort
at persuasion of the workers of the Computation Center
to withhold their labor or for the users of the Center to
boycott the facility. In the present context, the term
"strike" was a kind of euphemism for a broad range of
protest activities, including peaceful, coercive and vio
lent activities. We conclude that Professor Franklin must
reasonably have expected that his advocacy of "shut
down" would be interpreted by at least a substantial
portion of the audience as calling for forceful disruption
of the operation of the Center. Indeed, we believe that
this is what he meant.
CONCLUSION
We conclude that Professor Franklin must reasonably
have expected that his speech at White Plaza on
February 10, 1971, would increase the likelihood of
illegal occupation of the Computation Center immedi
ately following his speech, and that there was risk of
serious damage to the computer and its users. The Board
finds the evidence strongly persuasive that Professor
Franklin urged and incited his audience at White Plaza
towards disruption of University functions and shut
down of the Computation Center. We therefore sustain
charge No. 8.
