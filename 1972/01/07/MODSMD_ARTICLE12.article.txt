# Advisory Board Findings: White Plaza Incident
## 
### 
A. CHARGES
The relevant University charges concerning the White
Plaza incident are contained in Paragraph 8 of the
"Statement of Charges" dated March 22, 1971. This
paragraph reads as follows:
8. On February 10, 1971, beginning at about 12
p.m., a rally was held at White Memorial Plaza to,
among other things, discuss methods of protesting
developments in the war in Indochina. Over tive
humdred students and other persons attended. During
the course of the rally two prinicpal courses of action
were discussed, one being to work in the non-Univer
sity community to bring about changes in govern
ment policy, the other being to disrupt University
functions and business. Professor Franklin intention
ally urged and incited students and other persons
present at the rally to follow the latter course of
action and specifically to shut down a University
computer facility known as the Computation Center.
Shortly thereafter a large number of students and
others left the rally and went to the Computation
Center whereupon many of these persons did in fact
occupy the Computation Center, prevent its opera
tion and obstruct movement in and out of the
building for several hours, terminating this unlawful
activity only when ordered to leave the building by
the police.
B. NATURE OF THE CHARGE
The general charge is that Professor Franklin urged
and incited the disruption of University functions; the
specific charge is that he urged and incited his audience
to shut down a University facility, the Computation
Center. Effectively, this means that his words, including
their delivery and their context, significantly increased
the likelihood of prohibited conduct on the part of his
audience; it means, moreover, that he must have anti
cipated that his speech, given its delivery and context,
would significantly increase the imminent likelihood of
prohibited conduct.
C. FINDINGS OF FACT
/. Prominent Themes in the White Plaza Rally
The noon-hour rally at White Plaza, attended at its
peak by about 700 people, had been proposed the night
before at the conclusion of a rally at Dinkelspiel Audi
torium. Most of the speeches given at the White Plaza
rally were available on tape recordings. Only a portion at
the outset was missing, and this was covered in testi
mony. The following themes emerged prominently in
the course of the White Plaza rally:
a. Many speakers discussed ways of protesting the
war in Southeast Asia. Three speakers, including two
student body leaders, favored an off-cainpus focus of
protest. They were severely criticized by five subsequent
speakers, who characterized liberal war protest in such
terms as "counter-insurgency." This may be illustrated
by the following speech:
Yeah, I'd just like to point out that the only time the
liberals and moderates come out of the woodwork is
when there is radical action on campus. . . .That's the
only way moderates and liberals can, can get off their
asses, is when the people around them are doing these
violent things which you consider to be useless.
b. On four occasions, there was reference to selection
of a protest target on campus; the desirability of alterna
tive possibilities was considered.
c. The Computation Center was referred to often
throughout the meeting. Its suitability as a protest target
was cited. In the final speech of the rally, Professor
Franklin called for shutting down the Computation
Center.
d. Some speakers emphasized Stanford's war com
plicity and the desirability of shutting down the Univer
sity in order to end that complicity.
e. Four speakers made reference to the concept of

different people taking protest action on different levels,
each doing his own thing. Three of these clearly included
coercive and violent behavior within the spectrum of
approved activities, and the fourth is unclear on this
poin<. The following quotations help to clarify this
important theme:
And so closing down Stanford is really a concrete
blow against the war. You see, that's a concrete way
of stopping, stopping things that are going on that
help the war by stopping that kind of research, by
stopping the programs that are run in the computer
center....
It's true that if we're writing letters to congressmen
we're probably not doing that much. But by striking
the University and by taking, by taking whatever
kinds of action we can, you see, on a lot of different
levels, some people may want to take over buildings,
some people will want to boycott class, some people
will want to cause classes to be boycotted, you see
it's not much good if English classes and the French
class aren't going on, but the Business School classes
and the Electronic Engineering classes are going on
and the Department of Defense research contracts are
still being carried out.
KZSU: The crowd is still growing here at White Plaza,
now about 700 people.
[new speaker] What really amazes me is like every
body that's here right now is like obviously against
the war. Now all this friction and all this bullshit
that's going on between radicals and conservatives
and liberals or whoever the fuck it is, it's all just
friction. Now, as long as people who are writing
letters or doing strikes, or breaking windows or what,
everybody's doing their own thing to stop that
fucking war over there. So, everybody do their own
thing, and let's stop that war now and altogether,
[applause]
112. The term "strike" was used several times, though
less than it had been the previous night at the Dinkel
spiel rally. Once again, it seemed to bear little relation to
the meaning of "strike" in labor disputes. Rather, it
seemed to refer to a broad spectrum of activities, some
non-coercive and some coercive. The most prominent
connotation was that of the "mobile strike" introduced
February 9th at Dinkelspiel—closing down one universi
ty facility after another by whatever means proved
feasible.
g. Six speakers made favorable reference to coercive
or violent behavior. This may be illustrated by a
recorded passage from Professor Franklin's speech:
. . .so want to talk about, about high consciousness,
the high consciousness is the consciousness of the
people most oppressed by U.S. imperialism, which
includes as a main institution of that Stanford
University. And that's why whenever people from
that community, whenever poor working class youth
from that community, get a chance to come on the
campus at Stanford and do a little material damage,
they are very eager to do so. Because they recognize
what Stanford University is, even if people here
don't.
2. Summary of Professor Franklin's speech
Professor Franklin gave the closing and longest speech
of the rally. (See Appendix II.) He called for a
willingness to sacrifice in the service of protest activity.
He criticized student body leaders for allegedly subvert
ing the activity of protesters. He gave some of his
personal history in antiwar activity. He cited a poll
indicating that people with little education expressed
more opposition to the war in Southeast Asia than those
with higher levels of education.
At the passage quoted earlier, referring to material
damage by working class youth at Stanford, Professor
Franklin's delivery shifted to a higher intensity, remain

ing at this level until the conclusion. He continued later,
Well, when we talk about, see we're just ripping off
the term strike when talking about striking at
Stanford. This isn't a strike. We're not risking
anything. It's a voluntary boycott—a shutdown of
some of the activities of the University as a demon
stration of something. Now, now what we called a
strike last year, and it lasted really about three days
and it kind of dragged on, and you know, in an odds
and ends way and some people did it. But just the
fact that we were able to move our little finger that
much, that electrified the working people of this
area.. ..
He ended the speech by saying,
See, now what we're asking is for people to make that
little tiny gesture to show that we're willing to
inconvenience ourselves a little bit and to begin to
shut down the most obvious machinery of war, such
as, and I think it is a good target, that Computation
Center, [applause and shouts of "right on. .. ."]
Immediately after Professor Franklin's speech, the
chairman asked for a vote to choose between the
Computation Center and Hoover. About 100 hands
(primarily in front) voted affirmatively on the question
of shutting down the former, whereupon the chairman
announced that a majority favored this course. He said,
"And so I would suggest that we go over there and visit
it." At that point, a voice is heard calling, "Shut it
down," echoing the comment made just before by
Professor Franklin and the meeting's chairman.
As the crowd was leaving they were instructed,
When people go over to the Comp Center, they
should all go in a group and move relatively slowly so
that the group can stay together. Also the meeting at
8 o'clock tonight in the Old Union Courtyard is a
very important meeting because we can decide what
we want to do tomorrow. There are some things that
we can't close down now, but we can close them
down if we get to them early in the morning.
3. Interpretation of the Meaning of Professor Frank
lin 's White Plaza Speech
a. Professor Franklin's Own Interpretation
There were several differing points of view regarding
the meaning of the speech given by Professor Franklin.
Professor Franklin himself in an affidavit dated February
24, 1971 described the meaning of his speech:
Actually, in order to understand either the content of
my speech or that of the rally itself, it is necessary to
see it in relation to the events of the previous evening.
The debate was essentially over the same issues, that
is, whether to focus off campus or call for a strike on
campus, and whether a strike could be effective.
Much of the debate was repetitious of the previous
night, but since most of the people at that meeting
felt bound by the vote, those who had wanted to stop
the munition train did not make their proposal. The
main spokesmen for off-campus work were Bob
Grant and Larry Diamond, who proposed doing
precinct work to elect so-called peace candidates. It
was my belief that these two were not being honest,
and that their main purpose was to prevent any
effective action and to advance their own political
careers. It was with this in mind, plus a sense that
many people were becoming very impatient with the
idle debate of the rally, that I rose to speak. My
intention was, as it had been the previous night, to
build the anti-war movement on the campus. ...
He concluded this portion of the affidavit:
Let's move our little finger again and begin to pick up
where we left off with our strike last spring. Let's
begin to shut down the machinery of war. I think
that the suggested target of the computer center is as
