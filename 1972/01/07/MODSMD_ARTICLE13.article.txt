# Advisory Board Findings: The Computation Center Incident
## 
### 
A. CHARGES
The relevant University charge concerning the
Computation Center incident is contained in paragraph 9
of the "Statement of Charges."
9. Further, on February 10, 1971 and in connection
with the activity at the Computation Center
described in paragraph 8, students and other persons
were arrested for failure to disperse after orders had
been given to clear an area around the Computation
Center. Professor Franklin signilicantly interfered
with orderly dispersal by intentionally urging and
inciting students and other persons present at the
Computation Center to disregard or disobey such
orders to disperse.
B. FINDING OF FACTS
1. Occupation of the Computation Center. Shortly
before 1:00 p.m. on February 10, 1971, the
Computation Center building was closed on the basis of
a telephone order from Provost Miller, but the computer
was kept running. Handwritten notices were posted on
the doors of the Computation Center; doors, windows,
and gates were locked; and two campus policemen were
stationed at the front door. Provost Miller had been
informed that a group was proceeding from White Plaza
to the Computation Center. An estimated 100 to 200
demonstrators arrived at the Computation Center
shortly after 1:00 p.m. There were apparently no
previous collective decisions or explicit understandings
by the group as to what actions were to be taken or as to
whether to damage the computer. Some subgroups may
have had previous understandings; different individuals
testified as to different expectations. There were no
plans for formal picketing with picket signs as in many
"strikes," and there had been no attempt to
communicate with Computation Center workers about a
strike after the Dinkelspiel meeting of February 9.
At about 1:15 p.m., forcible entry was made into the
Computation Center; the gate was scaled and the back
door forced. About 50 demonstrators then entered
through the back door. As they moved through the
building, they opened other entrances and admitted
other demonstrators. Power to the building and to the
computer was shut off at 1:20 by pulling a master
switch located near the back door. Some 100-200 more
persons entered and milled about inside the
Computation Center. Some demonstrators, according to
officials of the Center, jimmied the door and entered the
machine room. They went to the 2301 drums, yanked
out wires, and flipped switches behind gates or doors on
two of the data storage drums. Other demonstrators in
that group went directly to the racks where tape reels
were stored and began looking through them. The
telephone lines were made inoperative. Once
demonstrators were inside the building and the doors
were thrown open, the Stanford police did not try to

stop movement in and out of the building. Some of the
demonstrators posted themselves at the doors, and to
some extent controlled entry and exit, for example,
denying entry to a photographer.
During this period, there was a continual movement
of demonstrators into and out of the Computation
Center. It is agreed that some time during the
occupation approximately $800 of physical damage was
done to the premises and contents of the Computation
Center, not counting any costs of shut-down time on the
computer. This damage was partly caused by the pulling
of the wires and damage to the 2301 unit, partly to the
premises. Two fire hoses were taken out of racks arid
valves opened, but the water had been turned off earlier
by the University. The printout of each of three printers
was removed. It is agreed that no substantial damage was
done to the computer itself. However, the shutdown,
lasting until about 8:00 p.m., made it impossible for the
Computation Center to process 700-800 student and
faculty jobs scheduled for that period. Montgomery
testified that these jobs would be run during the
succeeding two weeks.
Given the fact that the demonstrators illegally seized
the Computation Center and made impossible
continuation of its regular activities, the Board does not
consider further details on the conduct of the occupiers
important for Charge 9 against Professor Franklin. It
should be noted that the occupiers refused to obey the
requests to leave the building required by law-by Bruce
Wiggins on behalf of Stanford University and by Officers
Marron, Rosa and Tamm of the Santa Clara Sheriffs
office. However, as a context for other events, we note
briefly some undisputed facts concerning the
occupation.
Professor Franklin met his 1:15 class. Only seven of
the 150 registered students were present. He believed the
others were at the Computation Center and suggested
moving the class to the area outside the Center.
Professor Franklin did not hold his class because, he
testified, many of his students were inside the
Computation Center. It is uncontested that he remained
outside the Computation Center, talking with individuals
about a variety of topics prior to the arrival of the
police.
Bruce Wiggins, Stanford Director of Public Safety,
arrived at the Computation Center soon after its
occupation. He walked through and around the building
with Assistant Fire Chief Barr. Soon thereafter, around
2:00 p.m., he telephoned the Santa Clara Sheriffs office
and told them of the occupation.
Shortly after 2:00 p.m., C. D. Marron of the Santa
Clara Sheriffs office arrived at the Computation Center.
He too walked through the building, and then went to
Redwood Hall nearby to confer with Wiggins and others,
including Messrs. Rosenzweig and Schwartz from the

University administration, Sergeant Tamm and Captain
Rosa of the Santa Clara Sheriffs office, and an Assistant
District Attorney of Santa Clara County.
At about 3:00 p.m., it was decided that Wiggins
should return to the Computation Center and issue, in
the name of Stanford University, a declaration of
trespass, declaring the occupation a violation of Stanford
University regulations and ordering the occupants to
leave immediately. Wiggins used a bullhorn as he moved
through the building making this declaration. Wiggins
claims he was jostled, pushed and shoved; it is agreed
that his announcement was greeted by jeers and catcalls,
and that virtually no one left the building in response to
his order. He then returned to the group at Redwood
Hall.
At some point, probably after 3:00 p.m., an informal
meeting was held by the demonstrators. It was chaired
by Janet Weiss, near the door of the Computation
Center, partly inside and partly outside the building.
Although reports on this meeting are somewhat
confused, apparently there was an informal discussion as
to what to do, including whether to continue the
occupation of the Computation Center, what to do if
the police came, and whether to damage the computer.
The discussion, according to Harry Press, a University
witness, included talk about what would be the impact
on student support if the computer were wrecked. Janet
Weiss is reported to have stressed the political neutrality
of machines, urging that they not be damaged.
Apparently agreement was reached to stay in the
Computation Center until the police came, and then to
leave voluntarily without damaging the computer.
Station KZSU, misunderstanding this vote, reported that
the occupiers would damage the computer, but Janet
Weiss asked them to broadcast a retraction of that
report. There may have been other, smaller meetings of
the occupiers during the afternoon; testimony on this
question is confusing.
At about 4:00 p.m., the group in Redwood Hall
decided that Messrs. Marron, Rosa, and Tamm would go
back to the Computation Center and again try to
persuade the occupants to leave voluntarily. They did so,
asking what the occupants wanted, calling attention to
the vulnerability of the computer and the data it
contained, and to possible injury to persons in the
University and in the hospital. The responses of the
demonstrators were that the occupants wanted to get
the Gamut-H program, SRI research, and war-related
research out of the Computation Center; the precise
nature of all the demands is unclear. Marron testified
that there were scattered shouts of "Down with SRI"
and "Get SRI out." Few if any of the occupiers left. The
three officers returned to Redwood Hall.
