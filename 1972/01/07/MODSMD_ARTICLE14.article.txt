A. CHARGES
The University Administration's charge concerning
Professor Franklin's conduct during the Old Union
Courtyard rally on February 10th reads as follows:
10. On the eveing of February 10, 1971, beginning at
approximately 8:00 p.m., a rally was held in the Old
Union Courtyard to, among other things, discuss
methods of protesting developments in the war in
Indochina. Over two hundred students and other
persons attended the rally. During the course of the
rally Professor Franklin intentionally urged and
incited students and other persons present to engage
in conduct calculated to disrupt activities of the
University and of members of the University
community and which threatened injury to
individuals and property. Shortly thereafter students
and other persons were assaulted by persons present
at the rally, and later that evening other acts of
violence occurred.
B. NATURE OF THE CHARGE IN PARAGRAPH 10
The charge centers on intentional incitement that
threatened: (1) disruption of University activities, both
individual and institutional; and (2) injury to persons
and property. It implies that a rish of coercive or violent
behavior existed at the time of the rally and that
Professor Franklin further increased the risk by the
content and manner of his participation. In determining
whether the facts fit the charges, the Board must inquite
(1) What is the entire context surrounding the alleged
incitement? (2) What is being communicated to the
audience? (3) What would the speaker judge to be the
effect of his communication on the audience?
C. FINDINGS OF FACT 1. Prominent Themes in the
1. Prominent Themes in the Old Union Rally,
February 10
On Wednesday, February 10 at 8:00 p.m. about 350
people attended a rally in the Old Union Courtyard.
Speakers debated tactics and demands. Professor
Franklin spoke twice. The themes that emerged
prominently in the course of the rally may he
summarized as follows:
a. There was general agreement on opposition to the
war in Southeast Asia and a wish to protest against
American involvement.
b. There was a major difference of opinion on the
scope of demands and of tactics. A contingent of
students from Roble Hall favored a single demand, an
effort to reach out for the broadest possible support
and strict adherence to non-violent tactics. Another
and larger faction favored a broader set of demands,
even at the risk of losing community support; and
they favored a broader range of tactics, including
coercive and violent ones, depending on
circumstances. This distinction between the two
groups was not only apparent in the speeches, but
was emphasized by a KZSU broadcast interview with
representatives of the Roble contingent near the end
of the rally.

c. Five speakers emphasized Stanford's major war
complicity and severe political repression. This
viewpoint may be illustrated with the following
quotation from one of the speakers.
I work at the phone company and I realize that
everyday one out of every two calls that I place
goes from Stanford University or SRI directly to
the Pentagon, to SRI all over the country and all
over the world, and people realize that Stanford
University is integrally linked with Pacific
Telephone Company, that all the business, you
know, that the whole service which Pacific
Telephone puts out is for the benefit of the
financial interest in this area and people who are
against the war, people that I work with who are
against the war, who are very, very angry and
outraged by the expansion of the war into Laos
realize that, because they have brothers, brothers
and uncles and fathers who are over there fighting,
who have been forced to go over there, they don't
have any choice, they can't afford to go to school,
they are forced to be over there. They have
brothers and sisters who are locked up in the
prisons all over America and they realize that
Stanford University, that the kind of research
Stanford does, the kind of money Stanford has,
which controls the black and brown communities
in the mid-peninsula, is a very dangerous thing and
they:re willing to fight against that for their very
survival and I think that the people here should
respect that, should respect the fact that telephone
workers are getting organized, that we're thinking
now about what kind of support demonstration
we can have when Stanford gets itself together and
the issues become clear to the people that
Stanford University is key in the war, key in the
oppression of political prisoners and it's just got to
go. (applause)
d. Eight speakers were very hostile to the police
especially to their presence on campus. Police had
been called to the campus to terminate the
occupation of the Computation Center and had
remained in view of the likelihood of further illegal
acts. It will be recalled that arson and "trashing" had
occurred on the nights of February 6 and 7. Early in
the Old Union rally of February 10, the presence of
police on campus was announced. No witness
testified that a single uniformed policeman entered
the Old Union courtyard, despite the fact that
Professor Franklin, in his affidavit shortly after the
event, said there were many police there. In the
hearing, he corrected this error. Thus, the police were
not visible to the people at the rally, but their
presence on campus was a focus of deep resentment.
They were often referred to as "pigs" and as an
occupation army or occupying forces. In conjunction
with the previous criticism of Stanford's complicity
in the war. the struggle on campus and the struggle in
Southeast Asia were portrayed as different facets of a
single struggle. Parallels were drawn between the

police on campus and imperialist armies in Asia. The
all-one-war theme was emphasized by urging
resistance to the police as analogous to resistance to
occupying forces in Vietnam.
e. On two occasions, members of the Free Campus
Movement were pointed out in a context of hostility,
and were linked to the police on campus.
112. In response to these various instigations, there was
a desire for action — not merely verbal demands, but
concrete, tangible steps to implement them. There
was a clear preference for strong, vivid action, though
some speakers, including those from the Roble
contingent, put their main emphasis on education.
Little reference was made to "strike" in this rally.
The actions mainly preferred by the speakers may be
illustrated by (he following remarks by the chairman:
Okay, I think it's still pretty clear that we want to
keep the demands as they are. Okay, at this point I
think we should go on to specific proposals for
how we act now. We've had a few proposals; one
guy suggested that after the Comp Center thing
today that in order to escalate rather than
de-escalate we should zero in on SRI, Another
person, other people have proposed that we deal
now with the police state that's on this campus
because if we're going to move against the war,
one of the things we have to do to be able to move
against the war in atmosphere where we're not
intimidated by pigs coming through to surround
our meetings and that kind of thing and that one
of the ways to do that is to begin any kind of
action people want to take to get the pigs off this
campus. I think that people should speak to these
proposals and add more proposals that they have.
g. Five speakers explicitly expressed and several
others implicitly expressed anger, using words and
imagery of fighting. Three speakers suggested actions
to embarrass, humiliate, or confront the police,
particularly late at night, while others made more
general comments advocating resistance to
intimidation.
h. Two speakers favored off-campus protests.
2. Professor Franklin's First Speech at Old Union
(Second speech of February 10)
Professor Franklin's first Old Union speech
(Appendix III) began with an effort to persuade the
Roble contingent of the correctness of the majority
position favoring a broad set of demands, including the
freeing of all "political prisoners" and the end of
Stanford's complicity in the war — not merely
immediate withdrawal of US forces from Southeast Asia.
He spoke with concern about people who must spend
time in jail, emphasized solidarity within the
"movement", and opposed betrayal of political
