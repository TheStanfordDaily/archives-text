# Canteen Fills 'Em Up
## 
### DAN BRENNER 
What eats money, pours Pepsi, and dishes out
entirely too many peanuts? It's one of Stanford's
many hundred vending machines, all serviced by
Canteen Corporation, one tentacle of ITT
Corporation.
Last month members of Local 856 of the
Teamsters Union, the people who force feed the
machines with new stock, struck Canteen.
Management of the corporation was forced to fill
the machines from December 7 to 20, when the
strike was settled for an undisclosed figure.
The vending machines have a long and unpopular
history at Stanford. The first machines were
brought in in the late 1930's and President Wilbur at
that time decided that any profits accruing from
candy bar, cola, or nutroll treats would be used to
pay off the Federal Housing Loan taken out on the
Student Union, known todav as Tresidder.
Student complaints range from too many Pepsi's
to consistent malfunctioning by the machines. One
student complained, "There's too many peanuts in
everything they sell," saying that he has
occasionally found ants wandering about the glass
display case.
A rip-off or not, the machines are here primarily
as a service to the community, not a money-making
venture, notes John Marston, University coordinator
of the machines.
Over a year ago, the Canteen Corporation raised
the prices of can soft drinks to 20c. Primarily as a
result of pressure from the soft drinking
community, the University insisted Canteen lower
the price and thus cut the amount of profit.
What are the profits? Marston reports that gross
sales of all the vending machines, excluding those in
non-University owned houses is approximately

$400,000 a year. Of this, Stanford currently
receives 13.5 per cent, according to Philllip Duffey
of Tresidder's budget office.
The choice of what comes out of the
machines—from old standards like Almond Joy to
the new Jack LaLanne Energy Bars—is decided at
the time of the contract, a procedure stemming
from the early sixties.
For at that time, there were some 14 vendors on
campus filling up machines with the organization of
a dozen mad bunny rabbits hiding Easter eggs. In
order to relieve this situation a study inaugurated by
Duffy suggested that a competitive bidding
procedure be instituted •by the Purchasing
Department among the big vending organizations
like Canteen, Servamation, and the Coca-Cola
Bottling Co. Canteen won out in 1960 and has been
retained, since starting on a new three-year contract
last year.
While the vending biz is profitable, Stanford has
not been exactly Green Acres for the Canteen Corp.
The machines which cost up to $3000, have had
their share of coin thefts, candy liberations and
kicks in the face. Gerald Scott, general manager of
Canteen's San Jose headquarters noted that the loss
experience at Stanford has been about twice the
national overall experience.
And Canteen has made some attempts to assuage
student complaints against the automatic money
eaters. This September Canteen brought in
aluminum Pepsi cans, although Pepsico has not
started marketing aluminum in the area. The action
was the result of meetings with Stanford ecology
groups.
And both Marston and Scott report that they are
happy to take suggestions for other candy
selections.Students with complaints can call Mr.
Marston at x 3340.

not been exactly Green Acres for the Canteen Corp.
The machines which cost up to $3000, have had
their share of coin thefts, candy liberations and
kicks in the face. Gerald Scott, general manager of
Canteen's San Jose headquarters noted that the loss
experience at Stanford has been about twice the
national overall experience.
And Canteen has made some attempts to assuage
student complaints against the automatic money
eaters. This September Canteen brought in
aluminum Pepsi cans, although Pepsico has not
started marketing aluminum in the area. The action
was the result of meetings with Stanford ecology
groups.
And both Marston and Scott report that they are
happy to take suggestions for other candy
selections.Students with complaints can call Mr.
Marston at x 3340.
What eats money, pours Pepsi, and dishes out
entirely too many peanuts? It's one of Stanford's
many hundred vending machines, all serviced by
Canteen Corporation, one tentacle of ITT
Corporation.
Last month members of Local 856 of the
Teamsters Union, the people who force feed the
machines with new stock, struck Canteen.
Management of the corporation was forced to fill
the machines from December 7 to 20, when the
strike was settled for an undisclosed figure.
The vending machines have a long and unpopular
history at Stanford. The first machines were
brought in in the late 1930's and President Wilbur at
that time decided that any profits accruing from
candy bar, cola, or nutroll treats would be used to
pay off the Federal Housing Loan taken out on the
Student Union, known todav as Tresidder.
Student complaints range from too many Pepsi's
to consistent malfunctioning by the machines. One
student complained, "There's too many peanuts in
everything they sell," saying that he has
occasionally found ants wandering about the glass
display case.
A rip-off or not, the machines are here primarily
as a service to the community, not a money-making
venture, notes John Marston, University coordinator
of the machines.
Over a year ago, the Canteen Corporation raised
the prices of can soft drinks to 20c. Primarily as a
result of pressure from the soft drinking
community, the University insisted Canteen lower
the price and thus cut the amount of profit.
What are the profits? Marston reports that gross
sales of all the vending machines, excluding those in
non-University owned houses is approximately

$400,000 a year. Of this, Stanford currently
receives 13.5 per cent, according to Philllip Duffey
of Tresidder's budget office.
The choice of what comes out of the
machines—from old standards like Almond Joy to
the new Jack LaLanne Energy Bars—is decided at
the time of the contract, a procedure stemming
from the early sixties.
For at that time, there were some 14 vendors on
campus filling up machines with the organization of
a dozen mad bunny rabbits hiding Easter eggs. In
order to relieve this situation a study inaugurated by
Duffy suggested that a competitive bidding
procedure be instituted •by the Purchasing
Department among the big vending organizations
like Canteen, Servamation, and the Coca-Cola
Bottling Co. Canteen won out in 1960 and has been
retained, since starting on a new three-year contract
last year.
While the vending biz is profitable, Stanford has
