# 'Dirty Harry'
## A 						Different Kind Of Police Movie 
### TODD McCARTHY 
Don Siegel's "Dirty Harry" is a
film you hate to love. Just as it is
beautifully constructed and
tremendously exciting, it is also
morally reprehensible and one of
the most brutally violent movies 1
have ever seen.
The film's opening shot pays
literal tribute to the members of
the San Francisco police force
who have lost their lives in the
line of duty over the years
(including seven over the last two
years) and Siegel's message seems
to be that modern policemen are
unduly hindered and modern
criminals are unduly protected by
the "liberal" resolutions adopted
in recent years.
Frank Sinatra was originally set

to star in "Dirty Harry," but he
fortunately announced his
retirement and Clint Eastwood
and Don Siegel decided to make
this their fourth collaborative
effort (their "The Beguiled"
rfpiains one of the year's very
btest films). Siegel then called in a
favorite scenarist Dean Riesner
("Coogan's Bluff") to rework an
existing screenplay.
The director claims he is not a
right-winger (and is in fact a
registered Democrat) and that he
made "Dirty Harry" more or less
in reaction to the plethora of
anti-cop films in recent years. In
its pan of the film. Variety opined
tHat "The Warner Bros, release,
rated R in the domestic market,
will be a serviceable programmer
for general action audiences, plus
extremists, sadists, revolutionaries
and law-and-order freaks."
Unfortunately, in these politically
troubled times most of us fall at
least partially into one of these
categories. Besides, few movies
these days deliver a genuine
charge.
Tough Cop
Eastwood plays a tough San
Francisco widower cop who won't
take crap from anyone and who
sees fit to use his own means to
capture a maniacal sniper who
systematically offs random
citizens and holds a young woman
for an ever-increasing ransom. The
mayor and almost everyone else
disapprove of Harry Callahan's
brutal investigative tactics but
must admit that he gets the job
done for, just an hour into the
102-minute film, Harry
apprehends the killer.
Though "Scorpio" is
emphatically guilty, he is
immediately released, since Harry
coerced a confession from the
criminal and neither used a search
warrant nor warned the man of
his rights. From this point on,
Harry's actions are not condoned

by police and governmental
authorities, but he sets out on his
own time to once again catch up
with the again active sniper and
ends by tossing his badge in
disgust into a construction
quagmire.
Though the comparison
between the end of "Dirty Harry"
and that of Orson Welles' brilliant
"Touch of Evil" is interesting, it is
also incidental. Much more to the
point is the resemblance of
Siegel's own "Coogan's Bluff" to
"Dirty Harry" and the
development (and change) of
themes and formal construction.
Granted, each film features Clint
Eastwood playing an
unconventional cop chasing a
marginally hippie criminal and

each has a penchant for violence
and helicopters. Beyond that,
however, the new film marks a
distinct progression from the
1968 release in structure and
characterization.
Complete Arcs
The action of "Coogan's Bluff"
is encompassed by one simple arc,
beginning with Coogan's
pilgrimage to New York and
ending with his return to Arizona,
criminal in hand. "Dirty Harry"
consists of two complete arcs,
considerably pared down and
more directly motivated, as it
covers "Coogan's" ground in half
the time (with all Universally
imposed romantic sub-plots
completely eliminated) and then
proceeds to amplify and deepen
the characterization of both the
protagonist and the events by
imposing moral and political
meaning on the duplicated but
more difficult action in the
second half.
While it may be convenient to
think of Coogan and Harry as the
same man (indeed, a friend of
mine came out of "Dirty Harry"
still calling Eastwood "Coogan"),
it is a tribute both to the film's
complexity and Eastwood's
ever-increasing excellence as an
actor that the differences between
the two are more revealing than
the similarities. Both employ their
unorthodox methods within the
system as long as they are

tolerated and once they are
"relieved of their responsibilities,"
they nonetheless persist and
eventually apprehend the villain.
Coogan, stripped of power in
New York, is forced to make a
"citizen's arrest" of his foe, then
returns west with his live captive
to the more friendly system from
whence he came. Harry, on the
other hand, remains on the force
until he vengefully kills the sniper,
then rejects the restrictive system
which made it so difficult for him
to execute his own (and, in this
case, objective) justice. Harry is
also tougher, more ironic and
single-minded and less
compromising than Coogan and,
as he stands atop a bridge awaiting
his enemy at the film's climax,

Eastwood immediately looms
larger than he ever has before.
Eastwood's Best
Indeed, this is Eastwood's best
performance next to that in "The
Beguiled," where he conveyed the
part's continual subtext
marvellously well. Eastwood
seems to recognize his limitations
but is learning to exploit his assets
very intelligently. Along with
Warren Beatty, Julie Christie,
Dustin Hoffman and very few
others, Eastwood selects his
directors very carefully and so far
has only made a couple of slips.
Because ?. number of his roles
have demanded that he
ferociously brandish a badge, it is
assumed that Eastwood himself is
conservative at very least.
Actually, he is an extreme and
impulsive independent, having
voted for Reagan but currently
being an active McGovern
supporter. "Dirty Harry"
notwithstanding, Eastwood
remains the sort of actor who
looks first for a solid vehicle and
meaty part and then, if at all, to
the political ramifications of his
participation in the project.

Mention must be made of
Andy Robinson's sensational
performance as the crazed killer.
Don Stroud's run made him
memorable in his counterpart role
in "Coogan's Bluff," but
Robinson is continually
extraordinary, perhaps most of all
when only his voice is heard over
the telephone as he leads
Eastwood on a wild goose chase
all over San Francisco. The
roaring scream the red-masked
Robinson lets out when Eastwood
stabs him in the leg is certainly
one of the most memorable
moments of violence to occur in
this overly violent epoch of movie
making.
Memorable Violence
Indeed, much of the violence
in "Dirty Harry" is memorable,
though one sequence appears
gratuitous in retrospect, as it
initiates one of the major plot
holes in the film (and there are
quite a few). Robinson, after
having been captured and
released, visits a black skin
specialist and is brutally
disfigured. Immediately
afterwards, he enters the hospital
and on television claims he was
assaulted by Eastwood, whom he
hopes to get off his back.
Eastwood, claiming he didn't do
it, is nonetheless reprimanded by
his superiors, but the chain of
events is dropped there.
The next we see, Robinson is
back on the rampage and
Eastwood is again on his trail,
with no explanation offered as to
who was believed or what was
thought by the authorities or
public. Thus, this series of
sequences not only confuses the
film by raising a provocative issue
and then dropping it, but admits
the possibility that it was all
included simply for the spectacle
of a black leather man
demolishing a hippie killer.
Like "The French
Connection," "Dirty Harry"
manages to evoke considerable
sympathy for the predicament of
the police in specific
circumstances and for individual
policemen themselves, without
sacrificing realism or softening
characterizations. However, it is
probable that "The French
Connection" will go down as a
classic policier while "Dirty
Harry" will riot, just as card
carrying liberals are clearly lining
up to watch Gene Hackman bust
blacks and enjoying it, while it is

unlikely they will endorse Clint
Eastwood's disenchantment with
civil liberties, even 'though his
menace is a murdering madman.
Smashing Entertainment
What's the difference? Though
each film is primarily designed for
its smashing entertainment value,
I think it has to do with the
nature of the films' implications.
When innocent bystanders and
even a policeman are killed in
"The French Connection," all
morality is swept aside in the
relentless flow of events and
images—decisions must be made
so quickly that there is no time
for either the characters or
audience to contemplate their
significance in the face of an
ultimate goal.
Because of the moral, legal and
political meanings brought into
play in "Dirty Harry," one is left
with the uncomfortable
conclusion that however the
balance of the law is weighted, the
citizen loses—the more liberal the
laws, the easier criminality
becomes; the tougher the laws,
the more we approach a police
state. For all the dazzling
cinematics of "The French
Connection," the moral dilemma
posed in "Dirty Harry" renders it,
if ever so slightly, a more meaty
and provocative film.

Among the programs scheduled
for this weekend are the films of
John and Yoko Lennon, which
are slated for Cubberley on both
Friday and Saturday at 8 and 10
p.m. These shorts, from the best
to the worst, fall into the best
tradition of pop art, as they can
engage for the moment but are
instantly disposable.
When I saw four of the films at
the recent San Francisco Film
Festival, the audience was angered
when the couple pulled a no-show
and quickly became hostile when
the nature of the films became
clear. "Erection" revealed the
warped expectations of most
everyone, as it actually (and
rather hypnotically) records the
construction of a building in
London by a static camera over a
period of months. John and/or
Yoko may have thought of it but
had nothing to do with the
filming, which is rather nicely
accomplished. Indeed, it may be
my favorite of the films.
"Fly" chronicles the
expedition of an adventurous
insect over the ever-changing

landscape of a nude female form.
Too long, often funny and
decidedly Yoko's work, a case
could certainly be made for its
inclusion among the better films
made concerning the repression
and passivity of women.
"Apotheosis" bothered my
audience the most, as the screen is
white for most of the running
time. The end is worth waiting
for, however, and is, in its own
way, cathertic. The relentless

oppressiveness of "Rape" made
me turn almost continually away
from the screen which, I suppose,
is part of the point.
In a curious way, these films
are highly communicative and
provoking. In fact, I've rarely
witnessed a more audible
audience, even if most of the
response was derisive. Oh yes.
These are very much films for The
People. Audience solidarity is
virtually insured.
"Joe" is the Sunday Flick.


NOW IN FlLMS—Several shorts by John and Yoko Lennon will be shown in Cubberley on both Friday
and Saturday nights. The films have created controversy at film festivals from Cannes to San Francisco
and areguaranteed to stimulate the audience in some way.

even a policeman are killed in
"The French Connection," all
morality is swept aside in the
relentless flow of events and
images—decisions must be made
so quickly that there is no time
for either the characters or
audience to contemplate their
significance in the face of an
ultimate goal.
Because of the moral, legal and
political meanings brought into
play in "Dirty Harry," one is left
with the uncomfortable
conclusion that however the
balance of the law is weighted, the
citizen loses—the more liberal the
laws, the easier criminality
becomes; the tougher the laws,
the more we approach a police
state. For all the dazzling
cinematics of "The French
Connection," the moral dilemma
posed in "Dirty Harry" renders it,
if ever so slightly, a more meaty
and provocative film.

Among the programs scheduled
for this weekend are the films of
John and Yoko Lennon, which
are slated for Cubberley on both
Friday and Saturday at 8 and 10
p.m. These shorts, from the best
to the worst, fall into the best
tradition of pop art, as they can
engage for the moment but are
instantly disposable.
When I saw four of the films at
the recent San Francisco Film
Festival, the audience was angered
when the couple pulled a no-show
and quickly became hostile when
the nature of the films became
clear. "Erection" revealed the
warped expectations of most
everyone, as it actually (and
rather hypnotically) records the
construction of a building in
London by a static camera over a
period of months. John and/or
Yoko may have thought of it but
had nothing to do with the
filming, which is rather nicely
accomplished. Indeed, it may be
my favorite of the films.
"Fly" chronicles the
expedition of an adventurous
insect over the ever-changing

landscape of a nude female form.
Too long, often funny and
decidedly Yoko's work, a case
could certainly be made for its
inclusion among the better films
made concerning the repression
and passivity of women.
"Apotheosis" bothered my
audience the most, as the screen is
white for most of the running
time. The end is worth waiting
for, however, and is, in its own
way, cathertic. The relentless

oppressiveness of "Rape" made
me turn almost continually away
from the screen which, I suppose,
is part of the point.
In a curious way, these films
are highly communicative and
provoking. In fact, I've rarely
witnessed a more audible
audience, even if most of the
response was derisive. Oh yes.
These are very much films for The
People. Audience solidarity is
virtually insured.
"Joe" is the Sunday Flick.


NOW IN FlLMS—Several shorts by John and Yoko Lennon will be shown in Cubberley on both Friday
and Saturday nights. The films have created controversy at film festivals from Cannes to San Francisco
and areguaranteed to stimulate the audience in some way.

TOP STAR—Clint Eastwood, recently named world's top film star,
appears as a tough San Francisco cop in Don Siegel's violent but
excellent "Dirty Harry." The film is currently at the Guild in Menlo
Park.
Don Siegel's "Dirty Harry" is a
film you hate to love. Just as it is
beautifully constructed and
tremendously exciting, it is also
morally reprehensible and one of
the most brutally violent movies 1
have ever seen.
The film's opening shot pays
literal tribute to the members of
the San Francisco police force
who have lost their lives in the
line of duty over the years
(including seven over the last two
years) and Siegel's message seems
to be that modern policemen are
unduly hindered and modern
criminals are unduly protected by
the "liberal" resolutions adopted
in recent years.
Frank Sinatra was originally set

to star in "Dirty Harry," but he
fortunately announced his
retirement and Clint Eastwood
and Don Siegel decided to make
this their fourth collaborative
effort (their "The Beguiled"
rfpiains one of the year's very
btest films). Siegel then called in a
favorite scenarist Dean Riesner
("Coogan's Bluff") to rework an
existing screenplay.
The director claims he is not a
right-winger (and is in fact a
registered Democrat) and that he
made "Dirty Harry" more or less
in reaction to the plethora of
anti-cop films in recent years. In
its pan of the film. Variety opined
tHat "The Warner Bros, release,
rated R in the domestic market,
will be a serviceable programmer
for general action audiences, plus
extremists, sadists, revolutionaries
and law-and-order freaks."
Unfortunately, in these politically
troubled times most of us fall at
least partially into one of these
categories. Besides, few movies
these days deliver a genuine
charge.
Tough Cop
Eastwood plays a tough San
Francisco widower cop who won't
take crap from anyone and who
sees fit to use his own means to
capture a maniacal sniper who
systematically offs random
citizens and holds a young woman
for an ever-increasing ransom. The
mayor and almost everyone else
disapprove of Harry Callahan's
brutal investigative tactics but
must admit that he gets the job
done for, just an hour into the
102-minute film, Harry
apprehends the killer.
Though "Scorpio" is
emphatically guilty, he is
immediately released, since Harry
coerced a confession from the
criminal and neither used a search
warrant nor warned the man of
his rights. From this point on,
Harry's actions are not condoned

by police and governmental
authorities, but he sets out on his
own time to once again catch up
with the again active sniper and
ends by tossing his badge in
disgust into a construction
quagmire.
Though the comparison
between the end of "Dirty Harry"
and that of Orson Welles' brilliant
"Touch of Evil" is interesting, it is
also incidental. Much more to the
point is the resemblance of
Siegel's own "Coogan's Bluff" to
"Dirty Harry" and the
development (and change) of
themes and formal construction.
Granted, each film features Clint
Eastwood playing an
unconventional cop chasing a
marginally hippie criminal and

each has a penchant for violence
and helicopters. Beyond that,
however, the new film marks a
distinct progression from the
1968 release in structure and
characterization.
Complete Arcs
The action of "Coogan's Bluff"
is encompassed by one simple arc,
beginning with Coogan's
pilgrimage to New York and
ending with his return to Arizona,
criminal in hand. "Dirty Harry"
consists of two complete arcs,
considerably pared down and
more directly motivated, as it
covers "Coogan's" ground in half
the time (with all Universally
imposed romantic sub-plots
completely eliminated) and then
proceeds to amplify and deepen
the characterization of both the
protagonist and the events by
imposing moral and political
meaning on the duplicated but
more difficult action in the
second half.
While it may be convenient to
think of Coogan and Harry as the
same man (indeed, a friend of
mine came out of "Dirty Harry"
still calling Eastwood "Coogan"),
it is a tribute both to the film's
complexity and Eastwood's
ever-increasing excellence as an
actor that the differences between
the two are more revealing than
the similarities. Both employ their
unorthodox methods within the
system as long as they are

tolerated and once they are
"relieved of their responsibilities,"
they nonetheless persist and
eventually apprehend the villain.
Coogan, stripped of power in
New York, is forced to make a
"citizen's arrest" of his foe, then
returns west with his live captive
to the more friendly system from
whence he came. Harry, on the
other hand, remains on the force
until he vengefully kills the sniper,
then rejects the restrictive system
which made it so difficult for him
to execute his own (and, in this
case, objective) justice. Harry is
also tougher, more ironic and
single-minded and less
compromising than Coogan and,
as he stands atop a bridge awaiting
his enemy at the film's climax,

Eastwood immediately looms
larger than he ever has before.
Eastwood's Best
Indeed, this is Eastwood's best
performance next to that in "The
Beguiled," where he conveyed the
part's continual subtext
marvellously well. Eastwood
seems to recognize his limitations
but is learning to exploit his assets
very intelligently. Along with
Warren Beatty, Julie Christie,
Dustin Hoffman and very few
others, Eastwood selects his
directors very carefully and so far
has only made a couple of slips.
Because ?. number of his roles
have demanded that he
ferociously brandish a badge, it is
assumed that Eastwood himself is
conservative at very least.
Actually, he is an extreme and
impulsive independent, having
voted for Reagan but currently
being an active McGovern
supporter. "Dirty Harry"
notwithstanding, Eastwood
remains the sort of actor who
looks first for a solid vehicle and
meaty part and then, if at all, to
the political ramifications of his
participation in the project.

Mention must be made of
Andy Robinson's sensational
performance as the crazed killer.
Don Stroud's run made him
memorable in his counterpart role
in "Coogan's Bluff," but
Robinson is continually
extraordinary, perhaps most of all
when only his voice is heard over
the telephone as he leads
Eastwood on a wild goose chase
all over San Francisco. The
roaring scream the red-masked
Robinson lets out when Eastwood
stabs him in the leg is certainly
one of the most memorable
moments of violence to occur in
this overly violent epoch of movie
making.
Memorable Violence
Indeed, much of the violence
in "Dirty Harry" is memorable,
though one sequence appears
gratuitous in retrospect, as it
initiates one of the major plot
holes in the film (and there are
quite a few). Robinson, after
having been captured and
released, visits a black skin
specialist and is brutally
disfigured. Immediately
afterwards, he enters the hospital
and on television claims he was
assaulted by Eastwood, whom he
hopes to get off his back.
Eastwood, claiming he didn't do
it, is nonetheless reprimanded by
his superiors, but the chain of
events is dropped there.
The next we see, Robinson is
back on the rampage and
Eastwood is again on his trail,
with no explanation offered as to
who was believed or what was
thought by the authorities or
public. Thus, this series of
sequences not only confuses the
film by raising a provocative issue
and then dropping it, but admits
the possibility that it was all
included simply for the spectacle
of a black leather man
demolishing a hippie killer.
Like "The French
Connection," "Dirty Harry"
manages to evoke considerable
sympathy for the predicament of
the police in specific
circumstances and for individual
policemen themselves, without
sacrificing realism or softening
characterizations. However, it is
probable that "The French
Connection" will go down as a
classic policier while "Dirty
Harry" will riot, just as card
carrying liberals are clearly lining
up to watch Gene Hackman bust
blacks and enjoying it, while it is

unlikely they will endorse Clint
Eastwood's disenchantment with
civil liberties, even 'though his
menace is a murdering madman.
Smashing Entertainment
What's the difference? Though
each film is primarily designed for
its smashing entertainment value,
I think it has to do with the
nature of the films' implications.
When innocent bystanders and
even a policeman are killed in
"The French Connection," all
morality is swept aside in the
relentless flow of events and
images—decisions must be made
so quickly that there is no time
for either the characters or
audience to contemplate their
significance in the face of an
ultimate goal.

but is learning to exploit his assets
very intelligently. Along with
Warren Beatty, Julie Christie,
Dustin Hoffman and very few
others, Eastwood selects his
directors very carefully and so far
has only made a couple of slips.
Because ?. number of his roles
have demanded that he
ferociously brandish a badge, it is
assumed that Eastwood himself is
conservative at very least.
Actually, he is an extreme and
impulsive independent, having
voted for Reagan but currently
being an active McGovern
supporter. "Dirty Harry"
notwithstanding, Eastwood
remains the sort of actor who
looks first for a solid vehicle and
meaty part and then, if at all, to
the political ramifications of his
participation in the project.

Mention must be made of
Andy Robinson's sensational
performance as the crazed killer.
Don Stroud's run made him
memorable in his counterpart role
in "Coogan's Bluff," but
Robinson is continually
extraordinary, perhaps most of all
when only his voice is heard over
the telephone as he leads
Eastwood on a wild goose chase
all over San Francisco. The
roaring scream the red-masked
Robinson lets out when Eastwood
stabs him in the leg is certainly
one of the most memorable
moments of violence to occur in
this overly violent epoch of movie
making.
Memorable Violence
Indeed, much of the violence
in "Dirty Harry" is memorable,
though one sequence appears
gratuitous in retrospect, as it
initiates one of the major plot
holes in the film (and there are
quite a few). Robinson, after
having been captured and
released, visits a black skin
specialist and is brutally
disfigured. Immediately
afterwards, he enters the hospital
and on television claims he was
assaulted by Eastwood, whom he
hopes to get off his back.
Eastwood, claiming he didn't do
it, is nonetheless reprimanded by
his superiors, but the chain of
events is dropped there.
The next we see, Robinson is
back on the rampage and
Eastwood is again on his trail,
with no explanation offered as to
who was believed or what was
thought by the authorities or
public. Thus, this series of
sequences not only confuses the
film by raising a provocative issue
and then dropping it, but admits
the possibility that it was all
included simply for the spectacle
of a black leather man
demolishing a hippie killer.
Like "The French
Connection," "Dirty Harry"
manages to evoke considerable
sympathy for the predicament of
the police in specific
circumstances and for individual
policemen themselves, without
sacrificing realism or softening
characterizations. However, it is
probable that "The French
Connection" will go down as a
classic policier while "Dirty
Harry" will riot, just as card
carrying liberals are clearly lining
up to watch Gene Hackman bust
blacks and enjoying it, while it is

unlikely they will endorse Clint
Eastwood's disenchantment with
civil liberties, even 'though his
menace is a murdering madman.
Smashing Entertainment
What's the difference? Though
each film is primarily designed for
its smashing entertainment value,
I think it has to do with the
nature of the films' implications.
When innocent bystanders and
even a policeman are killed in
"The French Connection," all
morality is swept aside in the
relentless flow of events and
images—decisions must be made
so quickly that there is no time
for either the characters or
audience to contemplate their
significance in the face of an
ultimate goal.
Because of the moral, legal and
political meanings brought into
play in "Dirty Harry," one is left
with the uncomfortable
conclusion that however the
balance of the law is weighted, the
citizen loses—the more liberal the
laws, the easier criminality
becomes; the tougher the laws,
the more we approach a police
state. For all the dazzling
cinematics of "The French
Connection," the moral dilemma
posed in "Dirty Harry" renders it,
if ever so slightly, a more meaty
and provocative film.

Among the programs scheduled
for this weekend are the films of
John and Yoko Lennon, which
are slated for Cubberley on both
Friday and Saturday at 8 and 10
p.m. These shorts, from the best
to the worst, fall into the best
tradition of pop art, as they can
engage for the moment but are
instantly disposable.
When I saw four of the films at
the recent San Francisco Film
Festival, the audience was angered
when the couple pulled a no-show
and quickly became hostile when
the nature of the films became
clear. "Erection" revealed the
warped expectations of most
everyone, as it actually (and
rather hypnotically) records the
construction of a building in
London by a static camera over a
period of months. John and/or
Yoko may have thought of it but
had nothing to do with the
filming, which is rather nicely
accomplished. Indeed, it may be
my favorite of the films.
"Fly" chronicles the
expedition of an adventurous
insect over the ever-changing

landscape of a nude female form.
Too long, often funny and
decidedly Yoko's work, a case
could certainly be made for its
inclusion among the better films
made concerning the repression
and passivity of women.
"Apotheosis" bothered my
audience the most, as the screen is
white for most of the running
time. The end is worth waiting
for, however, and is, in its own
way, cathertic. The relentless

oppressiveness of "Rape" made
me turn almost continually away
from the screen which, I suppose,
is part of the point.
In a curious way, these films
are highly communicative and
provoking. In fact, I've rarely
witnessed a more audible
audience, even if most of the
response was derisive. Oh yes.
These are very much films for The
People. Audience solidarity is
virtually insured.
"Joe" is the Sunday Flick.


NOW IN FlLMS—Several shorts by John and Yoko Lennon will be shown in Cubberley on both Friday
and Saturday nights. The films have created controversy at film festivals from Cannes to San Francisco
and areguaranteed to stimulate the audience in some way.

TOP STAR—Clint Eastwood, recently named world's top film star,
appears as a tough San Francisco cop in Don Siegel's violent but
excellent "Dirty Harry." The film is currently at the Guild in Menlo
Park.
Don Siegel's "Dirty Harry" is a
film you hate to love. Just as it is
beautifully constructed and
tremendously exciting, it is also
morally reprehensible and one of
the most brutally violent movies 1
have ever seen.
The film's opening shot pays
literal tribute to the members of
the San Francisco police force
who have lost their lives in the
line of duty over the years
(including seven over the last two
years) and Siegel's message seems
to be that modern policemen are
unduly hindered and modern
criminals are unduly protected by
the "liberal" resolutions adopted
in recent years.
Frank Sinatra was originally set

to star in "Dirty Harry," but he
fortunately announced his
retirement and Clint Eastwood
and Don Siegel decided to make
this their fourth collaborative
effort (their "The Beguiled"
rfpiains one of the year's very
btest films). Siegel then called in a
favorite scenarist Dean Riesner
("Coogan's Bluff") to rework an
existing screenplay.
The director claims he is not a
right-winger (and is in fact a
registered Democrat) and that he
made "Dirty Harry" more or less
in reaction to the plethora of
anti-cop films in recent years. In
its pan of the film. Variety opined
tHat "The Warner Bros, release,
rated R in the domestic market,
will be a serviceable programmer
for general action audiences, plus
extremists, sadists, revolutionaries
and law-and-order freaks."
Unfortunately, in these politically
troubled times most of us fall at
least partially into one of these
categories. Besides, few movies
these days deliver a genuine
charge.
Tough Cop
Eastwood plays a tough San
Francisco widower cop who won't
take crap from anyone and who
sees fit to use his own means to
capture a maniacal sniper who
systematically offs random
citizens and holds a young woman
for an ever-increasing ransom. The
mayor and almost everyone else
disapprove of Harry Callahan's
brutal investigative tactics but
must admit that he gets the job
done for, just an hour into the
102-minute film, Harry
apprehends the killer.
Though "Scorpio" is
emphatically guilty, he is
immediately released, since Harry
coerced a confession from the
criminal and neither used a search
warrant nor warned the man of
his rights. From this point on,
Harry's actions are not condoned

by police and governmental
authorities, but he sets out on his
own time to once again catch up
with the again active sniper and
ends by tossing his badge in
disgust into a construction
quagmire.
Though the comparison
between the end of "Dirty Harry"
and that of Orson Welles' brilliant
"Touch of Evil" is interesting, it is
also incidental. Much more to the
point is the resemblance of
Siegel's own "Coogan's Bluff" to
"Dirty Harry" and the
development (and change) of
themes and formal construction.
Granted, each film features Clint
Eastwood playing an
unconventional cop chasing a
marginally hippie criminal and

each has a penchant for violence
and helicopters. Beyond that,
however, the new film marks a
distinct progression from the
1968 release in structure and
characterization.
Complete Arcs
The action of "Coogan's Bluff"
is encompassed by one simple arc,
beginning with Coogan's
pilgrimage to New York and
ending with his return to Arizona,
criminal in hand. "Dirty Harry"
consists of two complete arcs,
considerably pared down and
more directly motivated, as it
covers "Coogan's" ground in half
the time (with all Universally
imposed romantic sub-plots
completely eliminated) and then
proceeds to amplify and deepen
the characterization of both the
protagonist and the events by
imposing moral and political
meaning on the duplicated but
more difficult action in the
second half.
While it may be convenient to
think of Coogan and Harry as the
same man (indeed, a friend of
mine came out of "Dirty Harry"
still calling Eastwood "Coogan"),
it is a tribute both to the film's
complexity and Eastwood's
ever-increasing excellence as an
actor that the differences between
the two are more revealing than
the similarities. Both employ their
unorthodox methods within the
system as long as they are

tolerated and once they are
"relieved of their responsibilities,"
they nonetheless persist and
eventually apprehend the villain.
Coogan, stripped of power in
New York, is forced to make a
"citizen's arrest" of his foe, then
returns west with his live captive
to the more friendly system from
whence he came. Harry, on the
other hand, remains on the force
until he vengefully kills the sniper,
then rejects the restrictive system
which made it so difficult for him
to execute his own (and, in this
case, objective) justice. Harry is
also tougher, more ironic and
single-minded and less
compromising than Coogan and,
as he stands atop a bridge awaiting
his enemy at the film's climax,

Eastwood immediately looms
larger than he ever has before.
Eastwood's Best
Indeed, this is Eastwood's best
performance next to that in "The
Beguiled," where he conveyed the
part's continual subtext
marvellously well. Eastwood
seems to recognize his limitations
but is learning to exploit his assets
very intelligently. Along with
Warren Beatty, Julie Christie,
Dustin Hoffman and very few
others, Eastwood selects his
directors very carefully and so far
has only made a couple of slips.
Because ?. number of his roles

ferociously brandish a badge, it is

immediately released, since Harry
coerced a confession from the
criminal and neither used a search
warrant nor warned the man of
his rights. From this point on,
Harry's actions are not condoned

by police and governmental
authorities, but he sets out on his
own time to once again catch up
with the again active sniper and
ends by tossing his badge in
disgust into a construction
quagmire.
Though the comparison
between the end of "Dirty Harry"
and that of Orson Welles' brilliant
"Touch of Evil" is interesting, it is
also incidental. Much more to the
point is the resemblance of
Siegel's own "Coogan's Bluff" to
"Dirty Harry" and the
development (and change) of
themes and formal construction.
Granted, each film features Clint
Eastwood playing an
unconventional cop chasing a
marginally hippie criminal and

each has a penchant for violence
and helicopters. Beyond that,
however, the new film marks a
distinct progression from the
1968 release in structure and
characterization.
Complete Arcs
The action of "Coogan's Bluff"
is encompassed by one simple arc,
beginning with Coogan's
pilgrimage to New York and
ending with his return to Arizona,
criminal in hand. "Dirty Harry"
consists of two complete arcs,
considerably pared down and
more directly motivated, as it
covers "Coogan's" ground in half
the time (with all Universally
imposed romantic sub-plots
completely eliminated) and then
proceeds to amplify and deepen
the characterization of both the
protagonist and the events by
imposing moral and political
meaning on the duplicated but
more difficult action in the
second half.
While it may be convenient to
think of Coogan and Harry as the
same man (indeed, a friend of
mine came out of "Dirty Harry"
still calling Eastwood "Coogan"),
it is a tribute both to the film's
complexity and Eastwood's
ever-increasing excellence as an
actor that the differences between
the two are more revealing than
the similarities. Both employ their
unorthodox methods within the
system as long as they are

tolerated and once they are
"relieved of their responsibilities,"
they nonetheless persist and
eventually apprehend the villain.
Coogan, stripped of power in
New York, is forced to make a
"citizen's arrest" of his foe, then
returns west with his live captive
to the more friendly system from
whence he came. Harry, on the
other hand, remains on the force
until he vengefully kills the sniper,
then rejects the restrictive system
which made it so difficult for him
to execute his own (and, in this
case, objective) justice. Harry is
also tougher, more ironic and
single-minded and less
compromising than Coogan and,
as he stands atop a bridge awaiting
his enemy at the film's climax,

Eastwood immediately looms
larger than he ever has before.
Eastwood's Best
Indeed, this is Eastwood's best
performance next to that in "The
Beguiled," where he conveyed the
part's continual subtext
marvellously well. Eastwood
seems to recognize his limitations
but is learning to exploit his assets
very intelligently. Along with
Warren Beatty, Julie Christie,
Dustin Hoffman and very few
others, Eastwood selects his
directors very carefully and so far
has only made a couple of slips.
Because ?. number of his roles
have demanded that he
ferociously brandish a badge, it is
assumed that Eastwood himself is
conservative at very least.
Actually, he is an extreme and
impulsive independent, having
voted for Reagan but currently
being an active McGovern
supporter. "Dirty Harry"
notwithstanding, Eastwood
remains the sort of actor who
looks first for a solid vehicle and
meaty part and then, if at all, to
the political ramifications of his
participation in the project.

Mention must be made of
Andy Robinson's sensational
performance as the crazed killer.
Don Stroud's run made him
memorable in his counterpart role
in "Coogan's Bluff," but
Robinson is continually
extraordinary, perhaps most of all
when only his voice is heard over
the telephone as he leads
Eastwood on a wild goose chase
all over San Francisco. The
roaring scream the red-masked
Robinson lets out when Eastwood
stabs him in the leg is certainly
one of the most memorable
moments of violence to occur in
this overly violent epoch of movie
making.
Memorable Violence
Indeed, much of the violence
in "Dirty Harry" is memorable,
though one sequence appears
gratuitous in retrospect, as it
initiates one of the major plot
holes in the film (and there are
quite a few). Robinson, after
having been captured and
released, visits a black skin
specialist and is brutally
disfigured. Immediately
afterwards, he enters the hospital
and on television claims he was
assaulted by Eastwood, whom he
hopes to get off his back.
Eastwood, claiming he didn't do
it, is nonetheless reprimanded by
his superiors, but the chain of
events is dropped there.
The next we see, Robinson is
back on the rampage and
Eastwood is again on his trail,
with no explanation offered as to
who was believed or what was
thought by the authorities or
public. Thus, this series of
sequences not only confuses the
film by raising a provocative issue
and then dropping it, but admits
the possibility that it was all
included simply for the spectacle
of a black leather man
demolishing a hippie killer.
Like "The French
Connection," "Dirty Harry"
manages to evoke considerable
sympathy for the predicament of
the police in specific
circumstances and for individual
policemen themselves, without
sacrificing realism or softening
characterizations. However, it is
probable that "The French
Connection" will go down as a
classic policier while "Dirty
Harry" will riot, just as card
carrying liberals are clearly lining
up to watch Gene Hackman bust
blacks and enjoying it, while it is

unlikely they will endorse Clint
Eastwood's disenchantment with
civil liberties, even 'though his
menace is a murdering madman.
Smashing Entertainment
What's the difference? Though
each film is primarily designed for
its smashing entertainment value,
I think it has to do with the
nature of the films' implications.
When innocent bystanders and
even a policeman are killed in
"The French Connection," all
morality is swept aside in the
relentless flow of events and
images—decisions must be made
so quickly that there is no time
for either the characters or
audience to contemplate their
significance in the face of an
ultimate goal.
Because of the moral, legal and
political meanings brought into
play in "Dirty Harry," one is left
with the uncomfortable
conclusion that however the
balance of the law is weighted, the
citizen loses—the more liberal the
laws, the easier criminality
becomes; the tougher the laws,
the more we approach a police
state. For all the dazzling
cinematics of "The French
Connection," the moral dilemma
posed in "Dirty Harry" renders it,
if ever so slightly, a more meaty
and provocative film.

Among the programs scheduled
for this weekend are the films of
John and Yoko Lennon, which
are slated for Cubberley on both
Friday and Saturday at 8 and 10
p.m. These shorts, from the best
to the worst, fall into the best
tradition of pop art, as they can
engage for the moment but are
instantly disposable.
When I saw four of the films at
the recent San Francisco Film
Festival, the audience was angered
when the couple pulled a no-show
and quickly became hostile when
the nature of the films became
clear. "Erection" revealed the
warped expectations of most
everyone, as it actually (and
rather hypnotically) records the
construction of a building in
London by a static camera over a
period of months. John and/or
Yoko may have thought of it but
had nothing to do with the
filming, which is rather nicely
accomplished. Indeed, it may be
my favorite of the films.
"Fly" chronicles the
expedition of an adventurous
insect over the ever-changing

landscape of a nude female form.
Too long, often funny and
decidedly Yoko's work, a case
could certainly be made for its
inclusion among the better films
made concerning the repression
and passivity of women.
"Apotheosis" bothered my
audience the most, as the screen is
white for most of the running
time. The end is worth waiting
for, however, and is, in its own
way, cathertic. The relentless

oppressiveness of "Rape" made
me turn almost continually away
from the screen which, I suppose,
is part of the point.
In a curious way, these films
are highly communicative and
provoking. In fact, I've rarely
witnessed a more audible
audience, even if most of the
response was derisive. Oh yes.
These are very much films for The
People. Audience solidarity is
virtually insured.
"Joe" is the Sunday Flick.


NOW IN FlLMS—Several shorts by John and Yoko Lennon will be shown in Cubberley on both Friday
and Saturday nights. The films have created controversy at film festivals from Cannes to San Francisco
and areguaranteed to stimulate the audience in some way.

TOP STAR—Clint Eastwood, recently named world's top film star,
appears as a tough San Francisco cop in Don Siegel's violent but
excellent "Dirty Harry." The film is currently at the Guild in Menlo
Park.
Don Siegel's "Dirty Harry" is a
film you hate to love. Just as it is
beautifully constructed and
tremendously exciting, it is also
morally reprehensible and one of
the most brutally violent movies 1
have ever seen.
The film's opening shot pays
literal tribute to the members of
the San Francisco police force
who have lost their lives in the
line of duty over the years
(including seven over the last two
years) and Siegel's message seems
to be that modern policemen are
unduly hindered and modern
criminals are unduly protected by
the "liberal" resolutions adopted
in recent years.
Frank Sinatra was originally set

to star in "Dirty Harry," but he
fortunately announced his
retirement and Clint Eastwood
and Don Siegel decided to make
this their fourth collaborative
effort (their "The Beguiled"
rfpiains one of the year's very
btest films). Siegel then called in a
favorite scenarist Dean Riesner
("Coogan's Bluff") to rework an
existing screenplay.
The director claims he is not a
right-winger (and is in fact a
registered Democrat) and that he
made "Dirty Harry" more or less
in reaction to the plethora of
anti-cop films in recent years. In
its pan of the film. Variety opined
tHat "The Warner Bros, release,
rated R in the domestic market,
will be a serviceable programmer
for general action audiences, plus
extremists, sadists, revolutionaries
and law-and-order freaks."
Unfortunately, in these politically
troubled times most of us fall at
least partially into one of these
categories. Besides, few movies
these days deliver a genuine
charge.
Tough Cop
Eastwood plays a tough San
Francisco widower cop who won't
take crap from anyone and who
sees fit to use his own means to
capture a maniacal sniper who
systematically offs random
citizens and holds a young woman
for an ever-increasing ransom. The
mayor and almost everyone else
disapprove of Harry Callahan's
brutal investigative tactics but
must admit that he gets the job
done for, just an hour into the
102-minute film, Harry
apprehends the killer.
Though "Scorpio" is
emphatically guilty, he is
immediately released, since Harry
coerced a confession from the
criminal and neither used a search
warrant nor warned the man of
his rights. From this point on,
Harry's actions are not condoned

by police and governmental
authorities, but he sets out on his
own time to once again catch up

disgust into a construction
quagmire.

TOP STAR—Clint Eastwood, recently named world's top film star,
appears as a tough San Francisco cop in Don Siegel's violent but
excellent "Dirty Harry." The film is currently at the Guild in Menlo
Park.
Don Siegel's "Dirty Harry" is a
film you hate to love. Just as it is
beautifully constructed and
tremendously exciting, it is also
morally reprehensible and one of
the most brutally violent movies 1
have ever seen.
The film's opening shot pays
literal tribute to the members of
the San Francisco police force
who have lost their lives in the
line of duty over the years
(including seven over the last two
years) and Siegel's message seems
to be that modern policemen are
unduly hindered and modern
criminals are unduly protected by
the "liberal" resolutions adopted
in recent years.
Frank Sinatra was originally set

to star in "Dirty Harry," but he
fortunately announced his
retirement and Clint Eastwood
and Don Siegel decided to make
this their fourth collaborative
effort (their "The Beguiled"
rfpiains one of the year's very
btest films). Siegel then called in a
favorite scenarist Dean Riesner
("Coogan's Bluff") to rework an
existing screenplay.
The director claims he is not a
right-winger (and is in fact a
registered Democrat) and that he
made "Dirty Harry" more or less
in reaction to the plethora of
anti-cop films in recent years. In
its pan of the film. Variety opined
tHat "The Warner Bros, release,
rated R in the domestic market,
will be a serviceable programmer
for general action audiences, plus
extremists, sadists, revolutionaries
and law-and-order freaks."
Unfortunately, in these politically
troubled times most of us fall at
least partially into one of these
categories. Besides, few movies
these days deliver a genuine
charge.
Tough Cop
Eastwood plays a tough San
Francisco widower cop who won't
take crap from anyone and who
sees fit to use his own means to
capture a maniacal sniper who
systematically offs random
citizens and holds a young woman
for an ever-increasing ransom. The
mayor and almost everyone else
disapprove of Harry Callahan's
brutal investigative tactics but
must admit that he gets the job
done for, just an hour into the
102-minute film, Harry
apprehends the killer.
Though "Scorpio" is
emphatically guilty, he is
immediately released, since Harry
coerced a confession from the
criminal and neither used a search
warrant nor warned the man of
his rights. From this point on,
Harry's actions are not condoned

by police and governmental
authorities, but he sets out on his
own time to once again catch up
with the again active sniper and
ends by tossing his badge in
disgust into a construction
quagmire.
Though the comparison
between the end of "Dirty Harry"
and that of Orson Welles' brilliant
"Touch of Evil" is interesting, it is
also incidental. Much more to the
point is the resemblance of
Siegel's own "Coogan's Bluff" to
"Dirty Harry" and the
development (and change) of
themes and formal construction.
Granted, each film features Clint
Eastwood playing an
unconventional cop chasing a
marginally hippie criminal and

each has a penchant for violence
and helicopters. Beyond that,
however, the new film marks a
distinct progression from the
1968 release in structure and
characterization.
Complete Arcs
The action of "Coogan's Bluff"
is encompassed by one simple arc,
beginning with Coogan's
pilgrimage to New York and
ending with his return to Arizona,
criminal in hand. "Dirty Harry"
consists of two complete arcs,
considerably pared down and
more directly motivated, as it
covers "Coogan's" ground in half
the time (with all Universally
imposed romantic sub-plots
completely eliminated) and then
proceeds to amplify and deepen
the characterization of both the
protagonist and the events by
imposing moral and political
meaning on the duplicated but
more difficult action in the
second half.
While it may be convenient to
think of Coogan and Harry as the
same man (indeed, a friend of
mine came out of "Dirty Harry"
still calling Eastwood "Coogan"),
it is a tribute both to the film's
complexity and Eastwood's
ever-increasing excellence as an
actor that the differences between
the two are more revealing than
the similarities. Both employ their
unorthodox methods within the
system as long as they are

tolerated and once they are
"relieved of their responsibilities,"
they nonetheless persist and
eventually apprehend the villain.
Coogan, stripped of power in
New York, is forced to make a
"citizen's arrest" of his foe, then
returns west with his live captive
to the more friendly system from
whence he came. Harry, on the
other hand, remains on the force
until he vengefully kills the sniper,
then rejects the restrictive system
which made it so difficult for him
to execute his own (and, in this
case, objective) justice. Harry is
also tougher, more ironic and
single-minded and less
compromising than Coogan and,
as he stands atop a bridge awaiting
his enemy at the film's climax,

Eastwood immediately looms
larger than he ever has before.
Eastwood's Best
Indeed, this is Eastwood's best
performance next to that in "The
Beguiled," where he conveyed the
part's continual subtext
marvellously well. Eastwood
seems to recognize his limitations
but is learning to exploit his assets
very intelligently. Along with
Warren Beatty, Julie Christie,
Dustin Hoffman and very few
others, Eastwood selects his
directors very carefully and so far
has only made a couple of slips.
Because ?. number of his roles
have demanded that he
ferociously brandish a badge, it is
assumed that Eastwood himself is
conservative at very least.
Actually, he is an extreme and
impulsive independent, having
voted for Reagan but currently
being an active McGovern
supporter. "Dirty Harry"
notwithstanding, Eastwood
remains the sort of actor who
looks first for a solid vehicle and
meaty part and then, if at all, to
the political ramifications of his
participation in the project.

Mention must be made of
Andy Robinson's sensational
performance as the crazed killer.
Don Stroud's run made him
memorable in his counterpart role
in "Coogan's Bluff," but
Robinson is continually
extraordinary, perhaps most of all
when only his voice is heard over
the telephone as he leads
Eastwood on a wild goose chase
all over San Francisco. The
roaring scream the red-masked
Robinson lets out when Eastwood
stabs him in the leg is certainly
one of the most memorable
moments of violence to occur in
this overly violent epoch of movie
making.
Memorable Violence
Indeed, much of the violence
in "Dirty Harry" is memorable,
though one sequence appears
gratuitous in retrospect, as it
initiates one of the major plot
holes in the film (and there are
quite a few). Robinson, after
having been captured and
released, visits a black skin
specialist and is brutally
disfigured. Immediately
afterwards, he enters the hospital
and on television claims he was
assaulted by Eastwood, whom he
hopes to get off his back.
Eastwood, claiming he didn't do
it, is nonetheless reprimanded by
his superiors, but the chain of
events is dropped there.
The next we see, Robinson is
back on the rampage and
Eastwood is again on his trail,
with no explanation offered as to
who was believed or what was
thought by the authorities or
public. Thus, this series of
sequences not only confuses the
film by raising a provocative issue
and then dropping it, but admits
the possibility that it was all
included simply for the spectacle
of a black leather man
demolishing a hippie killer.
Like "The French
Connection," "Dirty Harry"
manages to evoke considerable
sympathy for the predicament of
the police in specific
circumstances and for individual
policemen themselves, without
sacrificing realism or softening
characterizations. However, it is
probable that "The French
Connection" will go down as a
classic policier while "Dirty
Harry" will riot, just as card
carrying liberals are clearly lining
up to watch Gene Hackman bust
blacks and enjoying it, while it is

unlikely they will endorse Clint
Eastwood's disenchantment with
civil liberties, even 'though his
menace is a murdering madman.
Smashing Entertainment
What's the difference? Though
each film is primarily designed for
its smashing entertainment value,
I think it has to do with the
nature of the films' implications.
When innocent bystanders and
even a policeman are killed in
"The French Connection," all
morality is swept aside in the
relentless flow of events and
images—decisions must be made
so quickly that there is no time
for either the characters or
audience to contemplate their
significance in the face of an
ultimate goal.
Because of the moral, legal and
political meanings brought into
play in "Dirty Harry," one is left
with the uncomfortable
conclusion that however the
balance of the law is weighted, the
citizen loses—the more liberal the
laws, the easier criminality
becomes; the tougher the laws,
the more we approach a police
state. For all the dazzling
cinematics of "The French
Connection," the moral dilemma
posed in "Dirty Harry" renders it,
if ever so slightly, a more meaty
and provocative film.

Among the programs scheduled
for this weekend are the films of
John and Yoko Lennon, which
are slated for Cubberley on both
Friday and Saturday at 8 and 10
p.m. These shorts, from the best
to the worst, fall into the best
tradition of pop art, as they can
engage for the moment but are
instantly disposable.
When I saw four of the films at
the recent San Francisco Film
Festival, the audience was angered
when the couple pulled a no-show
and quickly became hostile when
the nature of the films became
clear. "Erection" revealed the
warped expectations of most
everyone, as it actually (and
rather hypnotically) records the
construction of a building in
London by a static camera over a
period of months. John and/or
Yoko may have thought of it but
had nothing to do with the
filming, which is rather nicely
accomplished. Indeed, it may be
my favorite of the films.
"Fly" chronicles the
expedition of an adventurous
insect over the ever-changing

landscape of a nude female form.
Too long, often funny and
decidedly Yoko's work, a case
could certainly be made for its
inclusion among the better films
made concerning the repression
and passivity of women.
"Apotheosis" bothered my
audience the most, as the screen is
white for most of the running
time. The end is worth waiting
for, however, and is, in its own
way, cathertic. The relentless

oppressiveness of "Rape" made
me turn almost continually away
from the screen which, I suppose,
is part of the point.
In a curious way, these films
are highly communicative and
provoking. In fact, I've rarely
