# Streisand In Vegas

### DAN BRENNER 
LAS VEGAS Rolling into this neon-drenched
town one senses a subtle, but growing dissatisfaction
with the climate of amorality that characteristically
pervades Las Vegas Boulevard, known to all but the
unitiated as "The Strip."
The traditional casino lounges which showcased
the best of -40's and '50's jazzmen have been
refurbished into resplendent, plastic keno parlors.
The lounges, the hotel bosses said, weren't showing
a profit, and since keno parlors would, they
switched.
Most of the famous hotels, once owned by above
and below board iron-nerved entrepreneurs, have
been gobbled up by Hughes Tool, Recrion
Entertainment Corp, or the Del Webb empire. Its
getting so a small-time crook couldn't touch the
place even if he knew how.
But even Hughes' infatuation with Vegas seems
to have diminished: purchasing has come to a halt;
bookings have felt the pinch of the economic slump;
and the costs of running his palatial domiciles have
blossomed into deficit potential.
Even the world famous chuck wagon dinners
where a person could file by a prime rib buffet line
for $1.99 have vanished from the strip. Today,
vestiges of yesterday's Las Vegas linger only in the
downtown casino areas where penny slot machines
still jingle to a former glamourous heritage.
Diminishing Magic
Today's Las Vegas is business. The lure of
legalized gambling in the United States is there
alright, but the magical sparks that made Las Vegas
an adolescent Fun City seem to be diminishing. As
elsewhere topless appeals have been heightened by
bottomless and adult book stores and peep show
movies are proliferating. But the controlled
recklessness that made Las Vegas the tantalizing
"sin" city is vanishing.
No doubt it is not simply big business's entry
into Vegas hotel ownership that explains this
change. "Sin" in its traditional sense has all but
vanished as an expletive in counter-culture parlance.
Striptease presentations—once a mainstay of lavish
floor shows—have become available in gross
quantities at neighborhood theaters.
But the corporate emblem, stamping itself
everywhere from the green felt of craps tables to
hotel room soapbars, seems to have left a strong
impression in the famous showrooms of this town.
Barbra Streisand's recent presentation at the Las
Vegas Hilton shows this trend clearly.
To say that her singing is brilliant tells one
nothing; Streisand is this country's most celebrated
cinema vocalist ("Funny Girl," "On A Clear Day,"
"Hello, Dolly"). Her singing satisfied expectations
and then some.
Impeccable Tone
Entering stage left with no fanfare or even
announcer's introduction she established a warm
connection with such favorites as "Second Hand
Rose" and "On A Clear Day." Her tone quality was
impeccable, dishing out her Brooklynese in just the
right doses.
Switching to her soul train, she delivered"I Will
I- iliow Where He Leads" with the accompaniment
of four back-up singers and a superb orchestra.
And her last number, the chilling "Happy Days
Are Here Again" left everyone with a solid feeling,
even those who were disappointed by the absence of
"People" and "Stoney End" from the evening's
repertoire.
But it was during the small talk that accompanies
Vegas acts, the talk that makes Shirley Bassey or

Wayne Newton such Vegas superstars, that the
Streisand show sagged.
Last year, in a widely circulated rumor.
Streisand's gigantic stage fright was so bad that it
was reported that she was smoking dope just before
coming on stage.
This year, overconfidence, which almost slipped
into ennui, dominated her stage presence. It seemed
that she was almost bored with the whole affair. She
didn't want to perform; her contract said she had
to.
No Curtain Call
And she did, but occasionally with all the
eagerness of a kid show host who has to
demonstrate a water balloon on himself. This
sluggishness was reflected in the fact that, although
the showroom was packed and it was the second
night of her four week engagement, the evening
went off without a curtain call. Last year Barbra
was back for curtain calls even in the last week of
her run.
Perhaps it is because some of the sparkle, the
glamour of the Las Vegas showroom has been
disappearing. Patrons who pay enough can get
ringside seats even when wearing a sportshirt. When
a performer realizes that many of his or her listeners
come to a show not out of any admiration for their
work but because it is a recess diversion from the
casinos, motivation for going all-out is lessened.
Or maybe it comes from a job security of a
five-year, million dollar package. Or maybe because
the whole show biz trip finally catches up with
someone after some many years.
Nevertheless, the Streisand show delivered a
modicum helping of its performer, who continued
to delight her well-paying spectators.
But there is something growing sour about Las
Vegas entertainment. It may be the stars, or the
bosses who pay them, or the people who watch
them. But if the casino lounges can become grey
keno parlors, imagine what they could do with the
showrooms.
