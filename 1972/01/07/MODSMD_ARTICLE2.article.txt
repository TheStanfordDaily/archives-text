# Attacked For Politics, Policies
## Critics Center On Hoover Boss 
### GARY ATKINS Second in a series 
Back in 1959, somebody suggested
that what Stanford really ought to do
with its Hoover Institution was get rid
of it—by merging it with the library.
That, needless to say, didn't sit very
well with ex-president Herbert Hoover,
who had founded the institute at his
alma mater 50 years earlier and had
kept a hand in running it ever since.
Still, Herbert Hoover had to face
the fact that his institution was
financially strapped. He had to find a
man who could raise enough money to
keep it solvent and could be firm
enough to resist those who would try
to get rid of it.
And he did. He found VV. Glenn
Campbell, a seemingly-diffident man
who, for all his ill-ease in public and all
his unwillingness to smile for cameras,
managed to turn a static library into a
bustling research and publishing
enterprise—and in the process, become
a center of passionate campus
controversy.
Think Tank
Campbell is a conservative—or, as
his many critics will soon let you
know, a Goldwaterite, a "blind
follower" of Ronald Reagan, an
unobjective sort who used his position
as director of Hoover to turn the
Institution into an unacademic
right-wing think tank.
Campbell has repeatedly denied the
charge that he has created a one-sided
institution—but the charge is forever
repeated. And the hostility to
Campbell and to the "new" Hoover he
has built, seems to run deeper than

just to the director's personal politics.
In fact, hostility seems to stem all the
way back to actions taken in 1939.
At that time, shortly before
Campbell was named director, Herbert
Hoover was apparently still a bit
concerned about the suggestion to
merge his institution with the Stanford
library. So, together with the Stanford
Board of Trustees, he agreed to a new
definition of the institution's
relationship with the university.

Before it had simply been
considered another academic
department; now it became a
semiautonomous institution with a
director who reported straight to the
university president, without reference
to faculty committees.
Once the new definition was
worked out and became a Trustee
resolution, Hoover attached a little
preface saying, among other things,
that one of the institution's functions

was to expose the evils of Marxism.
Hoover's Search
Meanwhile, he also launched a
personal search for a new director for
the institution, in spite of a similar
search being conducted by an informal
faculty committee.
In June, 1959, Hoover received a
letter from Raymond Moley, a former
Roosevelt New Dealer. "Dear Chief,"
it said, "I have another suggestion, and
that is Dr. W. Glenn Campbell," a
Harvard Ph.D. in economics and
director of a policy research operation
in Washington, D.C.
By the end of the year, Hoover had
his man, and Stanford had a
controversy.
As far as many faculty members
were concerned, it was bad enough
that they had been excluded from the
selection of a new director—what was
even worse was that there would no
longer be faculty control of the
director. The new relationship
between the institution and the
university had defined the faculty out
of the picture, the director was free to
shape his staff any way he saw fit,
critics said, whereas chairmen of
academic departments could only hire
and fire faculty with approval from
faculty committees.
Then, to make matters worse,
faculty members discovered Hoover's
anti-Marxism statement and became
even more disturbed. They charged
that the institution was being
one-sided and was failing to meet
objective standards of scholarly work.
'Intensive Scrutiny'
Stanford's administration was
eventually required to disassociate
itself from the anti-Marxist statement
(by pointing out that it was part of a
preface to the resolution and not the
resolution itself) and to promise

"intensive scrutiny" of whatever
policies and approintments Hoover's
new director made.
That calmed the controversy for a
while—but it wasn't enough to stop
the criticism. As Campbell begain to
change Hoover from a stagnant
institution into an active research
operation, as he began to appoint
potential donors to a new Hoover
advisory board, as he raised more and
more money, launched new projects,
build a new building—as he did all this,
criticisum began to build.
By the late 19605, the criticism had
combined with radical activism and
the institution had become not just a
"one-sided" think tank but, according
to some of its critics, a "center of
counterinsurgency research."
Rocks and disruptions
From 1969 to 1971, the criticism
reached new peaks—students hurled
rocks through the windows of the Lou
Henry Hoover Building and burned an
effigy of Campbell on the steps of
Hoover Tower. Hoover-sponsored
conferences, one of those new projects
begun by Campbell, began to provoke
more than just Daily articles on the
institution's purpose and history.
During last winter's Hoover
conference on the United Nations, for
example, a speech by former U.S.
Ambassador Henlry Cabot Lodge was
disrupted and finally cancelled.
Again, this fall, a Hoover conference

on Iran was disrupted by protestors
who said that the conference—"lran:
25 Centuries of Achievement" was
another example of Hoover's
one-sidedness since it ignored poverty
and tyranny in Iran.
Campbell's Reaction
Through it all, Campbell, diffident,
nervous and ill-at-ease as he might be
in such confrontations—Campbell did
not budge.
He certainly continued to raise
money, increasing Hoover's budget
five-fold over what it was when he
became director. He continued to

cultivate old and new donors—using
his advisory board as a source of
continuing contact. He continued to
warn protestors that he would not
hesitate to call police if anyone
entered Hoover intending to disrupt it.
And to the charges of one-sidedness,
he responded, "I do not view Hoover
as an ideological institution. It is a
scholarly research institution." And to
criticisms, he responded, "I do not
intend to be intimidated by broken
windows and by being hanged in
effigy."
Hoover had found his man.
Back in 1959, somebody suggested
that what Stanford really ought to do

who, for all his ill-ease in public and all
his unwillingness to smile for cameras,
managed to turn a static library into a
bustling research and publishing
enterprise—and in the process, become
a center of passionate campus
controversy.
Think Tank
Campbell is a conservative—or, as
his many critics will soon let you
know, a Goldwaterite, a "blind
follower" of Ronald Reagan, an
unobjective sort who used his position
as director of Hoover to turn the
Institution into an unacademic
right-wing think tank.
Campbell has repeatedly denied the
charge that he has created a one-sided
institution—but the charge is forever
repeated. And the hostility to
Campbell and to the "new" Hoover he
has built, seems to run deeper than

just to the director's personal politics.
In fact, hostility seems to stem all the
way back to actions taken in 1939.
At that time, shortly before
Campbell was named director, Herbert
Hoover was apparently still a bit
concerned about the suggestion to
merge his institution with the Stanford
library. So, together with the Stanford
Board of Trustees, he agreed to a new
definition of the institution's
relationship with the university.

Before it had simply been
considered another academic
department; now it became a
semiautonomous institution with a
director who reported straight to the
university president, without reference
to faculty committees.
Once the new definition was
worked out and became a Trustee
resolution, Hoover attached a little
preface saying, among other things,
that one of the institution's functions

was to expose the evils of Marxism.
Hoover's Search
Meanwhile, he also launched a
personal search for a new director for
the institution, in spite of a similar
search being conducted by an informal
faculty committee.
In June, 1959, Hoover received a
letter from Raymond Moley, a former
Roosevelt New Dealer. "Dear Chief,"
it said, "I have another suggestion, and
that is Dr. W. Glenn Campbell," a
Harvard Ph.D. in economics and
director of a policy research operation
in Washington, D.C.
By the end of the year, Hoover had
his man, and Stanford had a
controversy.
As far as many faculty members
were concerned, it was bad enough
that they had been excluded from the
selection of a new director—what was
even worse was that there would no
longer be faculty control of the
director. The new relationship
between the institution and the
university had defined the faculty out
of the picture, the director was free to
shape his staff any way he saw fit,
critics said, whereas chairmen of
academic departments could only hire
and fire faculty with approval from
faculty committees.
Then, to make matters worse,
faculty members discovered Hoover's
anti-Marxism statement and became
even more disturbed. They charged
that the institution was being
one-sided and was failing to meet
objective standards of scholarly work.
'Intensive Scrutiny'
Stanford's administration was
eventually required to disassociate
itself from the anti-Marxist statement
(by pointing out that it was part of a
preface to the resolution and not the
resolution itself) and to promise

"intensive scrutiny" of whatever
policies and approintments Hoover's
new director made.
That calmed the controversy for a
while—but it wasn't enough to stop
the criticism. As Campbell begain to
change Hoover from a stagnant
institution into an active research
operation, as he began to appoint
potential donors to a new Hoover
advisory board, as he raised more and
more money, launched new projects,
build a new building—as he did all this,
criticisum began to build.
By the late 19605, the criticism had
combined with radical activism and
the institution had become not just a
"one-sided" think tank but, according
to some of its critics, a "center of
counterinsurgency research."
Rocks and disruptions
From 1969 to 1971, the criticism
reached new peaks—students hurled
rocks through the windows of the Lou
Henry Hoover Building and burned an
effigy of Campbell on the steps of
Hoover Tower. Hoover-sponsored
conferences, one of those new projects
begun by Campbell, began to provoke
more than just Daily articles on the
institution's purpose and history.
During last winter's Hoover
conference on the United Nations, for
example, a speech by former U.S.
Ambassador Henlry Cabot Lodge was
disrupted and finally cancelled.
Again, this fall, a Hoover conference

on Iran was disrupted by protestors
who said that the conference—"lran:
25 Centuries of Achievement" was
another example of Hoover's
one-sidedness since it ignored poverty
and tyranny in Iran.
Campbell's Reaction
Through it all, Campbell, diffident,
nervous and ill-at-ease as he might be
in such confrontations—Campbell did
not budge.
He certainly continued to raise
money, increasing Hoover's budget
five-fold over what it was when he
became director. He continued to

cultivate old and new donors—using
his advisory board as a source of
continuing contact. He continued to
warn protestors that he would not
hesitate to call police if anyone
entered Hoover intending to disrupt it.
And to the charges of one-sidedness,
he responded, "I do not view Hoover
as an ideological institution. It is a
scholarly research institution." And to
criticisms, he responded, "I do not
intend to be intimidated by broken
windows and by being hanged in
effigy."
Hoover had found his man.
Back in 1959, somebody suggested
that what Stanford really ought to do
with its Hoover Institution was get rid
of it—by merging it with the library.
That, needless to say, didn't sit very
well with ex-president Herbert Hoover,
who had founded the institute at his
alma mater 50 years earlier and had
kept a hand in running it ever since.
Still, Herbert Hoover had to face
the fact that his institution was
financially strapped. He had to find a
man who could raise enough money to
keep it solvent and could be firm
enough to resist those who would try
to get rid of it.
And he did. He found VV. Glenn
Campbell, a seemingly-diffident man
who, for all his ill-ease in public and all
his unwillingness to smile for cameras,
managed to turn a static library into a
bustling research and publishing
enterprise—and in the process, become
a center of passionate campus

just to the director's personal politics.
In fact, hostility seems to stem all the
way back to actions taken in 1939.
At that time, shortly before
Campbell was named director, Herbert
Hoover was apparently still a bit
concerned about the suggestion to
merge his institution with the Stanford
library. So, together with the Stanford
Board of Trustees, he agreed to a new
definition of the institution's
relationship with the university.

Before it had simply been
considered another academic
department; now it became a
semiautonomous institution with a
director who reported straight to the
university president, without reference
to faculty committees.
Once the new definition was
worked out and became a Trustee
resolution, Hoover attached a little
preface saying, among other things,
that one of the institution's functions

was to expose the evils of Marxism.
Hoover's Search
Meanwhile, he also launched a
personal search for a new director for
the institution, in spite of a similar
search being conducted by an informal
faculty committee.
In June, 1959, Hoover received a
letter from Raymond Moley, a former
Roosevelt New Dealer. "Dear Chief,"
it said, "I have another suggestion, and
that is Dr. W. Glenn Campbell," a
Harvard Ph.D. in economics and
director of a policy research operation
in Washington, D.C.
By the end of the year, Hoover had
his man, and Stanford had a
controversy.
As far as many faculty members
were concerned, it was bad enough
that they had been excluded from the
selection of a new director—what was
even worse was that there would no
longer be faculty control of the
director. The new relationship
between the institution and the
university had defined the faculty out
of the picture, the director was free to
shape his staff any way he saw fit,
critics said, whereas chairmen of
academic departments could only hire
and fire faculty with approval from
faculty committees.
Then, to make matters worse,
faculty members discovered Hoover's
anti-Marxism statement and became
even more disturbed. They charged
that the institution was being
one-sided and was failing to meet
objective standards of scholarly work.
'Intensive Scrutiny'
Stanford's administration was
eventually required to disassociate
itself from the anti-Marxist statement
(by pointing out that it was part of a
preface to the resolution and not the
resolution itself) and to promise

"intensive scrutiny" of whatever
policies and approintments Hoover's
new director made.
That calmed the controversy for a
while—but it wasn't enough to stop
the criticism. As Campbell begain to
change Hoover from a stagnant
institution into an active research
operation, as he began to appoint
potential donors to a new Hoover
advisory board, as he raised more and
more money, launched new projects,
build a new building—as he did all this,
criticisum began to build.
By the late 19605, the criticism had
combined with radical activism and
the institution had become not just a
"one-sided" think tank but, according
to some of its critics, a "center of
counterinsurgency research."
Rocks and disruptions
From 1969 to 1971, the criticism
reached new peaks—students hurled
rocks through the windows of the Lou
Henry Hoover Building and burned an
effigy of Campbell on the steps of
Hoover Tower. Hoover-sponsored
conferences, one of those new projects
begun by Campbell, began to provoke
more than just Daily articles on the
institution's purpose and history.
During last winter's Hoover
conference on the United Nations, for
example, a speech by former U.S.
Ambassador Henlry Cabot Lodge was
disrupted and finally cancelled.
Again, this fall, a Hoover conference

on Iran was disrupted by protestors
who said that the conference—"lran:
25 Centuries of Achievement" was
another example of Hoover's
one-sidedness since it ignored poverty
and tyranny in Iran.
Campbell's Reaction
Through it all, Campbell, diffident,
nervous and ill-at-ease as he might be
in such confrontations—Campbell did
not budge.
He certainly continued to raise
money, increasing Hoover's budget
five-fold over what it was when he
became director. He continued to

cultivate old and new donors—using
his advisory board as a source of
continuing contact. He continued to
warn protestors that he would not
hesitate to call police if anyone
entered Hoover intending to disrupt it.
And to the charges of one-sidedness,
he responded, "I do not view Hoover
as an ideological institution. It is a
scholarly research institution." And to
criticisms, he responded, "I do not
intend to be intimidated by broken
windows and by being hanged in
effigy."
Hoover had found his man.
Back in 1959, somebody suggested
that what Stanford really ought to do
with its Hoover Institution was get rid
of it—by merging it with the library.
That, needless to say, didn't sit very
well with ex-president Herbert Hoover,
who had founded the institute at his
alma mater 50 years earlier and had
kept a hand in running it ever since.
Still, Herbert Hoover had to face
the fact that his institution was
financially strapped. He had to find a
man who could raise enough money to
keep it solvent and could be firm
enough to resist those who would try
to get rid of it.
And he did. He found VV. Glenn
Campbell, a seemingly-diffident man
who, for all his ill-ease in public and all
his unwillingness to smile for cameras,
managed to turn a static library into a
bustling research and publishing
enterprise—and in the process, become
a center of passionate campus
controversy.
Think Tank
Campbell is a conservative—or, as
his many critics will soon let you
know, a Goldwaterite, a "blind
follower" of Ronald Reagan, an
unobjective sort who used his position
as director of Hoover to turn the
Institution into an unacademic
right-wing think tank.
Campbell has repeatedly denied the
charge that he has created a one-sided
institution—but the charge is forever
repeated. And the hostility to
Campbell and to the "new" Hoover he
has built, seems to run deeper than

just to the director's personal politics.
In fact, hostility seems to stem all the
way back to actions taken in 1939.
