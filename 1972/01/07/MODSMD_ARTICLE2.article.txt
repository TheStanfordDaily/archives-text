# Attacked For Politics, Policies
## Critics Center On Hoover Boss 
### GARY ATKINS Second in a series 
Back in 1959, somebody suggested
that what Stanford really ought to do
with its Hoover Institution was get rid
of it—by merging it with the library.
That, needless to say, didn't sit very
well with ex-president Herbert Hoover,
who had founded the institute at his
alma mater 50 years earlier and had
kept a hand in running it ever since.
Still, Herbert Hoover had to face
the fact that his institution was
financially strapped. He had to find a
man who could raise enough money to
keep it solvent and could be firm
enough to resist those who would try
to get rid of it.
And he did. He found VV. Glenn
Campbell, a seemingly-diffident man
who, for all his ill-ease in public and all
his unwillingness to smile for cameras,
managed to turn a static library into a
bustling research and publishing
enterprise—and in the process, become
a center of passionate campus
controversy.
Think Tank
Campbell is a conservative—or, as
his many critics will soon let you
know, a Goldwaterite, a "blind
follower" of Ronald Reagan, an
unobjective sort who used his position
as director of Hoover to turn the
Institution into an unacademic
right-wing think tank.
Campbell has repeatedly denied the
charge that he has created a one-sided
institution—but the charge is forever
repeated. And the hostility to
Campbell and to the "new" Hoover he
has built, seems to run deeper than

just to the director's personal politics.
In fact, hostility seems to stem all the
way back to actions taken in 1939.
At that time, shortly before
Campbell was named director, Herbert
Hoover was apparently still a bit
concerned about the suggestion to
merge his institution with the Stanford
library. So, together with the Stanford
Board of Trustees, he agreed to a new
definition of the institution's
relationship with the university.

Before it had simply been
considered another academic
department; now it became a
semiautonomous institution with a
director who reported straight to the
university president, without reference
to faculty committees.
Once the new definition was
worked out and became a Trustee
resolution, Hoover attached a little
preface saying, among other things,
that one of the institution's functions

was to expose the evils of Marxism.
Hoover's Search
Meanwhile, he also launched a
personal search for a new director for
the institution, in spite of a similar
search being conducted by an informal
faculty committee.
In June, 1959, Hoover received a
letter from Raymond Moley, a former
Roosevelt New Dealer. "Dear Chief,"
it said, "I have another suggestion, and
