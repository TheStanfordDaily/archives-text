### 
There will be a meeting of all
people who worked on the
Daily Entertainment Staff last
quarter on Sunday at 4 p.m. in
the Daily offices. Regardless of
how little or how much work
you did last quarter, please try
to make it to this very
important meeting. Plans for
the rest of the year will be
discussed in detail, so
attendance is very important.
If you are not able to attend,
please contact Don Tollefson
at 321-2300 x 4632.
