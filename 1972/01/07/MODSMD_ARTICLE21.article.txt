# Swimmers Host Invitational
## 
### MIKE CHASSON 
The Stanford University
Swimming team opens its 1972
season today by hosting the
Stanford Invitational Relays. The
teams competing include Santa
Clara Swim Club, Arden Hills
Swim Club, University of
California, and Foothill Aquatic
Club.
Some of the day's best races
for Stanford will involve Santa
Clara, and Arden Hills, two of the
most powerful AAU swim clubs in
the country.
This year's Stanford team is
young with many freshmen and
sophomores in key roles. Coach
Jim Gaughran believes that any
success this year depends mostly
on potential as the team is so
young. Stanford has been picked
by Swimming World Magazine to

place fourth at the NCAA
Championships at West Point in
late March. Gaughran believes this
prediction is "based on the
expected improvement of the
SAILING
Sailing instruction is now
offered for the first time by
the Physical Education
Department. This course is
aimed at those who have little
or 110 previous sailing
experience. Emphasis is placed
on rigging and boat preparation
along with basic sailing theory
and procedures. Instruction
will be held at Lake Lagunita
and students will receive one
unit of P.E. credit. An
introductory meeting will be
held Thursday at the Lake
Boathouse at 1:15.

freshmen and sophomores." This
year's team is more balanced than
in the past, with two or three
good swimmers in each event and
the team has been working hard
and Gaughran is confident of a
good year.
Stanford, in its earliest swim
meet ever, defeated the University
of the Pacific, 73-38, and the
University of California, 70-41, on
December 18 at the Stanford
pool.
There were some excellent
early season performances from
the meet. Brian Job recorded the
fastest time in the country so far
in the 200 Breaststroke, going
2.09.6. Terry Sutton recorded the
third fastest time in the country
in the 1000 free, 9.57.6, shaving
ten seconds off his previous best.
Other good performances were

turned in by Dean Anderson in
the 200 free, John Stalker and
Rick Loginotti in the 200 fly,
Randy Whitchurch and Jack
Deppe in the 200 back, and
Captain Dave Schilling in the 200
breast. Deppe, Whitchurch,
Anderson, and Stalker are
freshmen.

The Stanford University
Swimming team opens its 1972
season today by hosting the
Stanford Invitational Relays. The
teams competing include Santa
Clara Swim Club, Arden Hills
Swim Club, University of
California, and Foothill Aquatic
Club.
Some of the day's best races
for Stanford will involve Santa
Clara, and Arden Hills, two of the
most powerful AAU swim clubs in
the country.
This year's Stanford team is
young with many freshmen and
sophomores in key roles. Coach
Jim Gaughran believes that any
success this year depends mostly
on potential as the team is so

by Swimming World Magazine to

expected improvement of the

good year.
Stanford, in its earliest swim
meet ever, defeated the University
of the Pacific, 73-38, and the

There were some excellent
early season performances from
the meet. Brian Job recorded the
fastest time in the country so far
in the 200 Breaststroke, going
2.09.6. Terry Sutton recorded the
third fastest time in the country
in the 1000 free, 9.57.6, shaving
