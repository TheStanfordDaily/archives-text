# Winning Indians Open Pac-8 Season Tonight
## 
### CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
Howie Dallmar's cagers will bring a three game winning streak into
their first conference game of the season tonight with Washington
State's Cougars.
Stanford has a good chance of winning its Pac-8 opener because the
Cougars finished in a tie for last place in the 1971 season with the
Cards. While the Indians have shown improvement this year, WSU
does not have much hope of climbing out of the conference cellar.
New coach Bob Greenwood has only one starter returning from last
year's 2-12 squad and is trying to fill the holes with inexperienced
sophomores. The Cougars have had a demanding pre-season schedule,
and they could challenge the Cards if their younger players have
improved with experience.
On Saturday night, Stanford will take on Washington at 8:00 p.m.
The Huskies finished fifth in the Pac-8 last season and they should
improve on that mark under the floor leadership of Steve Hawes, their
6-10 center who led the conference in rebounds and racked up a 20.8
point average last year. Hawes is much improved this season and will
give the Indians trouble. Sophomore Ray Price averaged 27 points on
the freshman team and will help Hawes lead the Husky attack.
In preliminaries to the WSU and Washington games, the undefeated
Indian freshmen will play the frosh teams from San Jose State and
U.C. Davis.
