Amsterdam Argues Death Penalty
LOS ANGELES—The California Supreme Court, declining to wait for a U.S.
Supreme Court decision on the death penalty, began hearing arguments today
from advocates and opponents, with justices engaging in lively debate with both.
Anthony Amsterdam, a Stanford University law professor arguing for
abolition of the death penalty, told the court that the penaltyoffends
"contemporary standards of decency." He added that should California execute
all the persons currently on death row "we would become the greatest executor
in the world."
Deputy Atty. Gen. Ronald George told the justices that executions are valid
as both retribution for a crime and deterrent of future crimes.
When several justices challenged him on whether the death penalty deters
murderers, George replied, "The deterrent would be much more were executions
carried out." Amsterdam contended the penalty is more often invoked against
members of poor minorities.
U.S. Bombs Pound Vietnam
SAIGON -Wave after wave of America's most powerful bombers struck Friday
along the western borders of South Vietnam a few hours after U.S. negotiators
at the Paris peace talks accused North Vietnam of planning new attacks along
the frontier.
The aerial pounding of the southern half of the demilitarized zone between
the warring Vietnams was the heaviest ever reported.
In other air action, the new year's second U.S. "protective reaction",
fighter-bomber strikes hit closer to Hanoi than any raid in North Vietnam in
more than a year.
Up to 30 of the powerful 852 stratofortresses, each carrying 30 tons of
explosives, unleashed 900 tons of bombs on North Vietnamese troop and supply
buildups and infiltration corridors on South Vietnam's western flanks.
Nearly half of the raids were concentrated in the southern half of the western
end of the demilitarized zone at a point where it joins the borders of Laos and
South Vietnam. Other strikes hit in South Vietnam's western central highlands
bordering northeastern Cambodia, where another big enemy buildup is
reportedly under way.
Women 9 s Lib Means Trouble
MADISON. Wise.—A fourth grade girl has been transferred to another class
following her parent's complaint that her teacher had been stressing women's
liberation.
Vikki Howe was removed from the fourth grade class taught by Fat
.Jimmerson at Schenk Elementary School because her mother, Mrs. Howard
Howe, said she and her husbnad were concerned about the women's lib issue.
The class had allegedly discussed the possibility of writing to newspapers and
suggesting that the "women's section" be called the "family section" instead.
Railroad Executives Accused
PHILADELPHIA—The former financial chairman of the Penn Central Railroad
and a business associate were held in $50,000 bail each Thursday on charges of
conspiring to divert more than $21 million from the railroad's treasury for
themselves and others.
David C. Bevan, former finance chairman for the financially troubled railroad,
and Charles J. Hodge, a Wall Street broker, surrendered to the Philadelphia
district attorney's office Thursday.
A third defendant, former Air Force Gen. Albert Lassiter, was arrested in
California on Wednesday and is fighting extradition to Pennsylvania.
Convict Testifies In Soledad Trial
SAN FRANCISCO—A convict who said he fears for his life testified Thursday he
witnessed the Soledad Brothers, fellow black inmates, beat prison guard John
Mills the night Mills was killed.
Thomas A. Yorke said he begged authorities not to make him testify but they
threatened to put him back at Soledad Prison where he said convicts would kill
him for telling what he knew.

Yorke, appearing nervous, said he looked through a small window in the door
of his cell across from the murder scene Jan. 16, 1970. He said he saw the three
Soledad Brothers, George Jackson, Fleeta Drumgo and John Clutchette, holding
Mills, choking him and beating him.
Drumgo and Clutchette have pleaded innocent to charges of murdering Mills.
Jackson was killed last Aug. 21 in what officials said was an escape try at San
Quentin Prison.
"Mr. Jackson started beating the officer in the face area," Yorke said. "The
Officer was lying on the floor face up. Mr. Jackson knelt right in the area and
chopped him so to speak on the chest," he said, demonstrating karate-like chops
with his hands.
He said only the three convicts were in the area, then Drumgo and Clutchette
left and Jackson was alone when "He lifted the guard up, slid him between the
bars and over the tier."
Mills' battered body was thrown over a third floor railing, the prosecution
says. Yorke said that he saw Clutchette pick up a flashlight near the murder
scene and"he wiped it with a towel." The state contends Mills was beaten to
death with his own flashlight.
"I never wanted to be a witness," he said. Yorke said convicts told him "if I
testified, I'd be killed."
