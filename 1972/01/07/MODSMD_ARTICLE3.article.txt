## 
### PHIL REVZIN 
The Faculty Senate yesterday
adopted a charge to a committee to
study the professoriate and
postponed action on a petition by
Jewish students to prevent registration
from conflicting with Jewish High
Holy days.
Also at the meeting, Provost Miller
said that the Board of Trustees
prabably wouldn't be able" to act on
the Franklin decision at their Tuesday
meeting. The Board must approve all
dismissal actions against tenured
faculty.
Miller added that the Academic
Council meeting scheduled for today
had been postponed due to President
Lyman's illness. The charge to the
Ad Hoc Senate Committe on the
Professoriate at Stanford, calls for the
group to study "the general
procedures and policies governing
appointments, reappointments,
promotions, and non-reappointments

of faculty members, including Senior
Lecturers, Senior Research Associates
and Senior Scientists.
The committee,which will consist of
eight faculty and two student
members, will also study
"qualifications and prerogatives" of
non-professorial positions such as
lecturers, research associates, research
scientists, and clinical researchers and
professors.
The group will also deal with
oDtions for retirement by faculty at an
age other than sixty-five.
The committee must report to the
Senate no later than Fall of 1972, and
must submit its final report within
two years.
The Senate, after extensive debate,
postponed action on a request to
prevent registration or the first two
days of classes from falling on the
Jewish holidays of Rosh Hashona or
Yom Kippur.

Dean of Undergraduate Studies
James Gibbs told the Senate that the
administration is considering a
proposal that would allow most
registration functions to be
accomplished at pre-reg, eliminating
the need for special arrangements for
students who had to miss registration
due to religious reasons.
The Senate postponed action until
they receive a report of options
available to alleviate religious holiday
conflicts in the future. Provost Miller's
office is to prepare such a report no
later than next fall quarter. The next
Jewish holiday conflict is fall quarter,
1973.
Also at the meeting, Dean Clavton
Rich of the Medical School announced
that he had accepted the
recommendation of the grievance
panel in the case of hospital worker
John Dolly. Dolly has been
reinstated, and has received some
back pay, Rich said.
