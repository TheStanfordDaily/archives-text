# From Dylan To Catch 22
## Jerry Irish Brings 'Relevance' To Religion 
### LAURIE SMITH 
For Professor Jerry Irish, Bob Dylan's poetry and
Catch 22 can be as relevant to religious studies as
Psalms and the letters of Paul.
"He helps to bring religion into the 20th
century," one of Irish's students notes. His lectures
on Christian ethics include case examples such as
Vietnam, national power, black oppression, student
violence and political revolution.
"Religiously-oriented people are also involved in
other issues... so their religious beliefs are
naturally going to play a part in that involvement,"
the 34-year-old professor asserts. Irish's involvement
with issues includes strong stances against the war
and for minority rights and women's liberation.
His anti-war sentiments are n fleeted not only in
his lectures, but also in his involvement in a Palo
Alto Presbyterian Church which voted for giving
asylum to the Coral Sea sailors who wanted to stop
serving in the Vietnamese war.
Irish grins enthusiastically and his eyes widen
behind gold-rimmed glasses as he recalls the church's
session to discuss the issue. "It would have been
impossible to have ignored something which plays
such a big part in the lives of many of the members
of the congregation. There were differing views on
the subject of asylum, but we left the session
knowing and understanding each other
better ... we had each tried to apply our religious
values to our lives outside the church."
Open-minded Attitude
The willingness of many more young people to
discuss and consider religion today pleases him
especially. "Students were much more cynical about
religion when I was in college," he says. "If a
so-called 'Jesus freak' had come into a dorm to
discuss his philosophy, he probably would have
been laughed out."
Irish's students note that it is difficult to be
cynical about Christianity at least in his classes. "It's

obvious where he stands on issues," one student
says, "but he makes you recognize that there isn't
any absolute set of Christian views."
"Jerry has an excellent rapport with his students,
partially because of his youth," Professor Robert
McAfee Brown notes. "But I doubt if his ability to
communicate will be altered as he grows older."
When Irish first came to Stanford in 1967, he
assisted Brown in his large group lecture courses and
they have become close friends.
Gores Award Recipient
"The large amount of time he devotes to his
students and his confidence with his lecture
materials were also factors in his receiving the Gores
Award last year," Brown adds. Irish was given the
Walter J. Gores Award for Excellence in Teaching
last spring. Recipients are nominated by students
and faculty for "living according to the ideals of
which they speak and succeeding in involving
students in their field of study as deeply as they are
involved."
Two students who are deeply involved in Irish's
activities are in junior high and elementary schools.
"My wife and I believe in having our sons
participate in what we're doing ... or when that's
not possible, in discussing our activities with them,"
Irish says. "We're trying to give them a good
religious background, but of course it will be up to
them to determine their own beliefs and religious
involvement. That's quite a bit different from my
situation as a child."
Raised in upstate New York, Irish's parents gave
him very little religious background. "I started going
to church on my own, mainly because I thought the
minister was a real swinging guy. Since then, I've
been slowly coming toward my present religious
beliefs." But, it wasn't until after the completion of
undergraduate work at Cornell and three years in

the service that he decided to base his profession on
religion.
"I thought I wanted to become a minister, an
idea which my parents looked down on very much.
My father is a personification of the little boy in the
Horatio Alger stories. He managed to work his way
up on his own financially, with very little education.
He views ministers as rather weak people, who don't
make much money, besides." After receiving his
B.D. at Perkins School of Theology, Irish changed
his goals in favor of teaching and completed his
graduate work at Yale.
Late Starter
"As my father saw it, I didn't have a job until I
started teaching here at Stanford at age 30, with a
wife and children," Irish recalls, "He also
disapproves of many of the movements my wife Pat
and I are involved in."
Pat Irish shares her husband's stances against the
war and for minority rights and women's liberation.
She has participated in marches against the war, the
movement of Bay Area churches to give asylum to
the Coral Sea sailors, picketing the placement center
and reviewing Palo Alto grade school books for
racist or sexist connotations. She takes courses
regularly at Stanford and is now enrolled in a
German course because the family will be going to
Stanford-in-Germany next year.
"Since both Jerry and I are for women's
liberation and believe in the husband and wife
sharing the good and the bad of each other's roles, I
have a lot more freedom with my activities outside
the home," she notes. She cites helping her husband
with his freshman seminar as one of her most
enjoyable activities.
"Since 1 have a little more time than Jerry, I can
sometimes get to know the students, whom he
knows academically, on a more personal basis," she
explains. "Sometimes they'll come over to talk
about problems or just to talk. We really do care."
