## Open Recruiting: A Dissenting View 
### 
Second of two parts
Determing the permissible
limits of individual action is,
of course, a difficult
undertaking. In general terms
it was settled for most of us by
John Stuart Mill who, more
than 100 years ago, argued
that a person ought to be
totally free of society's
restraint when his "conduct
affects the interests of no
persons besides himself." But
"as soon as any part of a
person's conduct affects
prejudicially the interests of
others, society has jurisdiction
over it...
By these standards most of
the regulations imposed on
Stanford students are justified.
Our experience suggests that
we could scarcely exist as a
community without some
body of law and regulation.
But the pious declarations
on behalf of freedom that we
hear daily in defense of war
recruiting make a mockery of
the very word, for freedom
can be considered only in the
context of its consequences.
No society on earth
recognizes the "right" of its
citizens to murder others. Nor
should we recognize the
"right" of Stanford students
to make white phosphorous
and cluster bombs or to drop
them on the children of
Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos.
Criminal laws, civil rights
laws, zoning ordinances, all
restrict freedom. Presumably
no member of this community
would defend the right of a
gunman to shoot down a bank
clerk who got in his way, or
the right of a landlord to
refuse housing to a black
apartment-seeker.
Why, then, are the
Administration and the signers
of the faculty advertisement so
eager to defend the right of
Stanford students to join the
military services and the war
manufacturers who together
are laying waste to three
hapless countries more than
8000 miles away?
All of the abstract
references to freedom and
moral choice cannot wipe
away the terrible reality of our
foreign and military policy.
One looks in vain in the

defenses of war recruitment
for any discussion of this issue.
Those of us who oppose war
recruitment have a right to ask
whether it is, indeed,
permissible to commit war
crimes in the name of
freedom.
Finally, the defenders of
war recruitment raise the issue
of practicality. How, they ask,
will we ever decide which
firms are to be prohibited
from recruiting on campus?
Are firms that sell food to the
armed forces to be banned? Is
a cluster bomb any worse than
the radar which enables a
bomber to drop it accurately?
What about the firm which is
engaged principally in civilian
activities but sells part of its
product to the armed forces?
Is it to be banned along with
the firm wholly engaged in war
production?
These are fair questions,
but the near hysteria with
which they are advanced leads
one to wonder whether an
effort is not underway to carry
a moderate request for a
limitation on recruitment to
such logical extremes that it
will appear absurd. Reductio
ad absurdum? Yes, a common
debator's trick.
When one stops to think
about the matter he is
impressed by the fact that we
are quite accustomed at
Stanford to making difficult
decisions. Professor Franklin is
currently being tried on
charges of "personal conduct
substantially impairing the
individual's performance of his
appropriate functions within
the University community."
This is perhaps the vaguest
standard in the history of
mankind. What does
"substantially" mean? What
are the "appropriate
functions" of a faculty
member? How far beyond the
classroom is a faculty member
followed by his "appropriate
functions?"
These are difficult
questions but President Lyman
and the signers of the faculty
advertisement are presumably
willing to ask the Advisory
Board to bite the bullet and
deal with the problem as best
they can. The Advisory Board

is not omniscient, but in an
imperfect world we are usually
content to live by the best
judgment of reasonable and
conscientious men. If we can
do that with faculty discipline,
why not with war
recruitment?
Or consider another
example. A faculty-staff--
student committee at Stanford
determines the architectural
standards which are imposed
on firms that seek to locate in
the Industrial Park. They also
determine the permissible
limits of noise and smoke.
These are difficult decisions to
make. The Taj Mahal at one
extreme and the architectural
monstrosity at the other are
easily differentiated. But
where does one draw the line?
In the gray zone in the
middle there are almost no
firm standards to guide even
the person of good will.
Aesthetic sense is subjective.
Sone designs are accepted;
other designs are rejected and
their firms are denied the right
to build in the Industrial Park.
Here again we find it possible
to live with the good-faith
decisions of dedicated
individuals. Could we not do
the same for war recruting?
One final example: last year
the Board of Trustees adopted
a new policy to govern the
management of the
University's investments.
Under this new policy the
Trustees will give primary
weight to "maximum return
consistent with the
appropriate degree of risk,"
but will give "independent
consideration and weight" to
those proposed investments in
which "the undesirable social,
economic, and political acts of

the company involved are
direct and substantial."
This is a radical departure
from past practice and will
impose grave burdens and
responsibilities on the
committee appointed to
administer the new porgram.
The committee will have to
develop indices of social,
economic and political
malpractice, determine for
each company a final measure
of the social harm it does, and
then weigh this against the
probable economic return to
the University.
This, I submit, is an
infinitely more complex task
than making a unidimensional
assessment of the degree to
which a firm "directly
produces material and research
for the military."
It would be presumptuous
for me to try to predict what
standards a thoughtful
committee might develop to
determine which firms should
be barred from recruiting on
the Stanford campus.
Distinctions can be made
between off-the-shelf items
made for the civilian market
which are also bought by the
military, and items made
exclusively for the military.
Distinctions can be made as to
the total volume of a
company's business with the
military or the percentage of
its output that goes to the
military. And distinctions can
be made between divisions of
large firms that recruit
separatelyâ€”separate divisions
of Litton Industries, for
example, make Polaris
submarines and Stouffer's
frozen foods.
And let no one argue that
there is no difference between

Hubert marshall

Honeywell (which makes the
cluster bomb), Hunt Foods,
and the American Hospital
Supply Corporation, simply
because all three sell to the
military. The difference is that
cluster bombs can be used for
only one purpose while civilian
products can be used for good
or bad. The Vietnamese
people, in their agony, can
testify to that.
The United States has been
at war during more than half
of all the years since 1941. No
other nation has been at war
such a large proportion of the
time. In the past decade alone
we have invaded Cuba, the
Dominican Republic, Vietnam,
Laos and Cambodia in order to
impose governments of our
choice on these hapless
nations.
Militarism is endemic in our
society; it needs to be rooted
out just as racism needs to be
rooted out. And the task is
urgent; the United States is
the greatest threat to
continued human life the
world has ever faced. Electing
a new President is important,
but that alone will not suffice.
The militarization of our
society has proceeded so far
that, if we are to be saved, we
must oppose it wherever we
find it. In this task universities
should not hesitate to take the
lead. This is why war
recruiting at the Placement
Center must be stopped.
