No Classified Research
Editor, THE DAILY:
I understand that there have
been charges that the Stanford
computation center is engaging in
classified work in violation of the
academic senate's policy on
secrecy in research. I can state
flatly that the center is not
certified by the government for
this purpose and that any
processing of classified material
would be in violation of university
policies as well as being illegal.
Our policies also prohibit using
the center for work on classified
contracts (which are banned from
campus in any case), and notice to
this effect is displayed in the
center.
I have checked with the
Associate Provost for Computing,
(Prof. Franklin) and the Director
of SCC (Mr. Dickens) and to the
best of our knowledge no
classified work is being performed
at SCC. Research on unclassified
grants and contracts sponsored by
DOD is undoubtedly being done
at SCC, and that this is in
accordance with university policy.
Also the GAMUT-H program is
gone and has been gone for a
"long, long time."

Vice Provost for Research
DOD Exception
Dear Dr. Geiman,
As you probably know, the
Association of Young Crows has
been waging a campaign against
war research on the Stanford
campus. Most faculty members
with DOD-sponsored research
claim that the positive aspects of
their work outweigh the military
aspects. Unfortunately, this is not
true.
We are pleased to note that
your DOD-sponsored project is an
exception. Research to combat
malaria is positive, even when
funded by the U.S.Army. Many of

us have friends in the U.S.
military, and we are anxious to
see them healthyâ€”and home.
The only problem with your
research is that the results are not
easily available to the Vietnamese.
The National Liberation Front
and North Vietnam, whose
medical establishments are
overtaxed by the War, desperately
need help combatting malaria.
They have asked the Young Crows
and other peace groups in the
United States to help.
We are therefore asking you to
prepare a packet of your technical
papers for transmittal to a
representative of the Democratic
Republic of Vietnam (North
Vietnam). In addition to work on
malaria published in technical
journals, we would like copies of
all reports which you have
submitted to the Army under
your contract. Please send the
reports to me (at the enclosed
address). We will ship them to the
Vietnamese.
In addition, if you have any
other suggestions, other sources,
etc., please let us know.
Thank you.
Peace,
Craig Laugh ton
(for the Young Crows)
(Editor's Note: The above letter
was sent to Dr. Quentin Geiman
(Dept. of Preventive Medicine,
Stanford Med. School) at the end
of last quarter, and a copy was
given to the Daily.)
No Surprise
Editor, THE DAILY:
Contrary to your front page
Franklin story of Jan 6, I reacted
with neither surprise, disbelief or
anger over the Board's decision.
Rather, I congratulate the
Advisory Board for having the
courage to make a decision which
will undoubtedly provoke the
more vocal elements of the
Community.

Open Recruiting
Editor, THE DAILY:
Professor Marshall's article
concerning campus recruiting
raised some questions central to
the entire issue of freedom and
the role of the university which
need to be clearly identified.
It is true that organized society
does impose moral judgements on
the people within that society (in
this case the society we are talking
about is the university
community). The real question is
what system of ethics should be
chosen to determine the moral
standards.
Since ethics and morals are
entirely an individual issue (i.e.,
they exist as value judgements in
the mind of each individual), I
contend that the only proper role
of society is one which allows
each individual the maximum
freedom in determining his own
code of ethics and then acting
accordingly. If this is to be the
case, then the only moral
judgement which a society may
properly impose upon its
members is the prohibition of the
use of fraud, deceit, coercion, and
physical force in all human
relationships.
The announced policy of the
University with regard to
recruiting seems to agree with the
principles stated above, yet in
other areas, as pointed out by
Marshall, it does not. The
argument that follows then states
that since the basic principles are
not followed consistently, the
principles themselves are bad.
Such an argument needs no
further comment. On the other
hand, I suggest that the principles
are valid and that what is need is
more consistent application.
The alternative is indeed a "Big
Brother" society which I, for one,
cannot accept.
