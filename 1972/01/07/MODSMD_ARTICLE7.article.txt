# Franklin Statements Regarding Dismissal
## 
### 
Statement of the ASSU Officers
The ASSU Council of Presidents and the Chairman of the
Student Senate can only condemn the decision of the Faculty
Advisory Board. They have demonstrated that Academic Freedom
is a one way street: it serves the War Researcher but not Bruce
Franklin. To dismiss Professor Franklin from the University while
we welcome others who play an active role in the computerized
murder of thousands of Asians every day in violation of
International Law—this is the most insidiously twisted logic we
have witnessed.
We, as students of this University, resent the implication in the
charges brought against Bruce Franklin that we are not responsible
for our own actions, that we are but sheep to be led by rhetoric
rather than reason. Just as we were not swayed by Franklin, so we
are not swayed by the Advisory Board. It is unjust to strip a man
of his livelihood because of his political beliefs; Professor Franklin
is a victim of this injustice.
This decision will have dangerous repercussions. We fear, like
Profs. Kennedy and Brown, that because of this decision other
institutions may be subject to increased pressures to fire
controversial faculty. In short, the lid may now be off on
repression of political dissent on campus.

Statement Of the Political Science
Graduate Students Association
Words can hardly express the bitter outrage and fury we experience
upon hearing of the Advisory Board's recommendation in the
Franklin case. The Board claims to act in the name of academic
freedom and civil liberties; in fact, it betrays these very values in an
effort to maintain homogeneity of viewpoint and an intellectual
environment both sterile and politically quiescent.
This University has never had a commitment to open discussion, to
the free movement of ideas unrestricted by the privileges of
organizational hierarchy. From the case of Paul Baran to the case of
Bruce Franklin, the record is clear. Those who seek in practice to
open the University—face harassment, attack, and exclusion.
In addition, the action of the Advisory Board involves more than
the betrayal of academic integrity. It is all too evident that the nation
is facing a rise of political forces determined to repress dissent. By
recommending that Franklin be fired, the Advisory Board gives
concrete support to such forces.
Perhaps, however, there is one salutary side effect to this incident.
The Advisory Board has demonstrated conclusively that the
University's oft-cited defense of political and intellectual liberty is a
facade. This is a point worth stressing. It is the Advisory Board—not
Venceremos—that has repudiated academic freedom and freedom of
speech on this campus.
We do not intend to spend the rest of our productive years as
potential teachers subservient to the ideology of an administrative
elite. Politics cannot be removed from the educational process. The
Advisory Board, under the guise of objectivity, has sought to force its
own bias upon the university. In so doing, it has made a serious
misjudgement; truth and the human conscience will not be so easily
banished.
(This statement was unanimously approved, at an official meeting of
the Political Science Graduate Students Association at 12 noon,
January 6, 1971. Thirty-four members were present and voting.

Franklin's Response
"It's right on. In the struggle within the University we'll take this
trade any day —one old revolutionary English professor for 34 young
revolutionary graduate students in political science.
"Victory to the peoples of Indochina! Avenge Attica! Rehabilitate
Stanford!"
