# W. Glenn Campbell: The Man In The Tower
## 
### 
Editor's Note: Daily reporters Gary Atkins and Phil
Revzin interviewed Hoover Institution Director W. Glenn
Campbell recently in his Hoover Tower office. Campbell
commented on the history of himself and the institution
and his hopes for the future.
Q: People speak of Hoover as a think tank, or criticize it
for having a right-wing slant. How would you respond to
this?
A: If I were to respond to every criticism that anyone has
ever made, I would have no time available for other
endeavors. As far as staff and publications, I will simply
let the record speak for itself. Our publications have been
published by many leading University Presses, in addition
to our own press. They have been widely and favorably
reviewed.
Q: Do you view Hoover as an ideological institution?
A: I certainly do not view Hoover as an ideological
institution. I view it a scholarly research institution.
Q: Do you think there is a basis for people labeling
Hoover Institute as basically right wing in tone?
A: I think that we have a very balanced staff.
Q: Would a young political scientist trying to get an
appointment at Hoover feel that he had to take a more

right-wing position than he would otherwise in order to
get an appointment?
A: He certainly would not. That way I wouldn't want him
on the staff.
Q: Do you think criticism of Hoover has peaked?
A: I would certainly hope so, because a large percentage
of it, in my opinion, is counter-productive. My colleagues
and I at the Hoover Institution have always been willing
to cooperate with the regular academic departments of
Stanford.
Q: Herbert Hoover said in 1959 that he felt the purpose
of the Institution should be to expose the evils of the
doctrines of Karl Marx. Do researchers at Hoover work
within the framework of this statement, or is it largely
ignored?
A: This was a personal statement of desire on the part of
the founder—part of an overall statement that made it
very clear that free inquiry was to prevail in the Hoover
Institution, and as far as I'm concerned, I grant Mr.
Hoover his right of free speech as well as everyone else.
Q: Are you or your staff under obligation to follow that
statement?
A: The obligation that the staff and I are under is to
collect material on the important social and political
movements of the twentieth century and to do research
on them. As far as I'm concerned, I interpret that
statement by Mr. Hoover to mean that he hoped we
would have a research program on communism. Since it's
generally acknowledged that we have the outstanding
collection on the rise and spread of communism, I think
it's perfectly natural that we would have a research
program on it.
Q: Some radical critics would ask if Hoover has a research
program on the rise and spread of imperialism, as well as
the rise and spread of communism.
A: We certainly do. A major series on the rise of
imperialism or colonialism in Africa is being published for
Hoover by the Cambridge University Press. A National
Fellow here this year is undertaking a comprehensive
study in the origins and meaning of national socialism.
Q: What do you think caused the criticism of Hoover that
gave rise in recent years to Hoover's windows being
broken and an effigy of you being burned several years
ago?
A: In the first place, we haven't been uniquely favored in
this direction. At least as many nasty adjectives have been
applied to President Lyman, for example, as have been
applied to me. The fact that I'm a regent of the University
of California makes some people upset with the way I
vote occasionally. I intend to vote my convictions in what
I think is the best interests of the University of California,
and the state of California. I do not intend to be
intimidated by broken windows or by being hanged in
effigy, no matter how distasteful or un-university-like I
may consider the behavior.
Q: As a California Regent, what is your philosophy of
higher education?
A: I believe the prime functions of a university are
instruction, research, and public service. There's nothing
very unusual about that. I guess where I differ from a
number of people is that I do not believe that the
University should be used as a staging ground for general
community political and social action programs.
Q: Do you think that Stanford University has been too
involved in these areas?
A: In May of 1970 it was. As a reaction to the Cambodian
invasion a good deal of restructuring of the University was
attempted, both at Stanford and the University of
California. Classes were cancelled and students were sent
out into the general communities to engage in political
propaganda efforts.
Q: How do you feel about such programs as SWOPSI?
A: As a general principle I'm in favor of SWOPSI. I am
not against experimentation and new methods of
teaching. I consider student input important. In my
experience their ideas, on the average, are at least as good
as those of many faculty members.
Q: How do you view President Nixon's forthcoming trip
to China.
A: I favor it. It's verv difficult for an outsider like myself

to comment, because we are not privy to the
conversations which Dr. Kissinger has had with
Chou-en-lai. I think the President knows what he is doing.
Q: How will this effect, if at all, Hoover's contact with
Communist China?
A: We've long had exchange arrangements and programs
with China. I'm sure our East Asian Curator has any
number of plans. I have not yet been able to talk to them.
You can be sure that we will be amongst the leaders if any
new exchange arrangements are worked out. We always
have been in the case of the Soviet Union and Cuba, for
example.
Q: Why would a communist nation want to provide
information to Hoover?
A: Why not? For one thing, the communists recognize
quality, and exchange arrangements with us are much
more to their advantage than exchange arrangements with
Podunk University—that has nothing to offer-no matter
how many self-avowed Maoists there may be on the
faculty.
Q: There has been much controversy surrounding the
conferences, such as the Iranian and United Nations
conferences that Hoover has held recently. What are the
purposes and value of these conferences?

A: The conferences never were that important a part of
our overall program. We tried to hold conferences where
distinguished scholars discuss topics of current interest. I
regret very much that lately some people either on or off
campus don't want to listen to what the speakers have to
say. What our ultimate decision on continuing these
conferences will be depends on what the general trends
are on college campuses. We could very easily hold our
conferences off campus. The real loser then would be the
University community, not the Hoover Institution. I'm
not proposing this though.
Q: Could you clarify the statement you made during
testimony you gave at the Franklin hearing concerning
communists teaching at universities?
A: This came up in the vote in the fall, 1969, when the
California Board of Regents voted to implement what was
then university policy by discharging Angela Davis
because of her membership in the Communist Party.
Members of the Communist Party, because of the concept
of Democratic centralism—that you to adhere to party
discipline, when the leaders have laid down the party
line—have a great deal of difficulty teaching or doing
research objectively. What I was saying was that it's
difficult for a member of the Communist Party to be
objective, so their chances of getting a university
appointment should be relatively small. You may recall
that I mentioned I would have less concern about a
communist teaching mathematics or natural sciences. I
want to make clear that I am talking about members of
the Communist party, and not about self-designated
Troskyites.

'Members of the Communist Party . . . have
a great deal of difficulty teaching or doing
research objectively.'

Q: Would you consider having a member of the
Communist Party on your staff?
A: We would consider him on his merits. Every year we
have several people come from Communist countries to
do research, and undoubtahly some of these are members
of the Communist Party. An interesting sidelight is that
after I returned from the Franklin hearings I had a call
from the Soviet Consul General wanting to arrange for the
visit of a prominent Soviet citizen to Stanford.
Q: Have you ever visited the Soviet Union?
A: No, but I hope to soon. The trip could occur before
this time next year.
Q: Is it Hoover policy not to invite Communists to speak
or do research?
A: No, there is no specific policy in this regard. It just
hasn't happened. There have been a lot of other
conferences at Stanford to which members of the
Communist Party have not been invited.
Q: Is there any connection between Hoover and the U.S.
government, aside from strictly business arrangements?
Several Hoover staff members have taken positions in the
Nixon administration. Are there formal arrangements for
this?
A: No. Have you ever considered the number of Harvard
professors who went to Washington at the beginning of
the Kennedy Administration. No one considered this
unusual. Our staff members are distinguished scholars and
have expertise in certain areas, and if they wish to take a
post with the national administration, I will grant them
leave. The State Department, CIA, Library of Congress,
and others make some of the documents they collect
available to us, just as the government of China makes
some of their documents available to us.
Q: Does Hoover hold any government contracts?
A: We've always had very few government contracts,
because we only try to get contracts if they directly relate
to our planned research and publications programs. The
arms control and disarmament contract that we hold is an
example. The main thrust of the Hoover Institution is
toward the promotion of peace. Studies of possible arms
control arrangements are a natural for us to undertake.
We've also received some grants for HEW to support the
library, in connection with the consortium of Western
universities which use the Hoover library. All of these

grants clear through Stanford University.
Q: What is your background, and why were you chosen
for the job of Hoover director?
A: I received my Ph.D. in Economics from Harvard, and
my primary field is government finance. Amongst my
secondary fields is international economics, which 1
taught at Harvard for a number of years. Then I was
research director for the American Enterprise Institute for
Public Policy Research, and then in the fall of 1959, at
the age of 35, I was appointed Director of the Hoover
Institution.
Q: Had you ever met President Hoover before your
appointment?
A: Yes, 1 met President Hoover in September of 1959,
while I was being considered for the job.
Q: Was Hoover in charge of the selection process?
A: I was offered the position by President Sterling, and I
accepted. The agreement President Hoover had with the
Stanford Board of Trustees called for the new Director to
be approved by Mr. Hoover, which I was.
Q: Had previous directors been likewise approved?
A: Not in that formal sense, but I'm sure informally all
other directors had been cleared, if I may use that term,
with Mr. Hoover before appointment.
Q: Has that right been handed down to Herbert Hoover's
sons?
A: The Directors of the Herbert Hoover Foundation must
approve the appointment of a new Director. This
foundation includes people other than family members.
At a Board of Trustees meeting in January of 1971, the
Trustees adopted a new agreement, which builds on the
1959 agreement for appointment of a new Director.
Should the Directorship become vacant, there would be a
search committee made up of 4 people selected by the
Senior Fellows, three people selected by the President of
Stanford, and three people selected by the Board of
Overseers of Hoover. These people would recommend
people to the President, who would select a nominee, who
would go before the Board of Directors of the Herbert
Hoover Foundation, and finally before the Board of
Trustees of Stanford for approval.
Q: After you became director, Hoover was able to raise a
much greater amount of funds than it had previously.
How was this accomplished?
A: I don't think there's any secret on successful
fund-raising, just a number of ingredients. You have to
have a good program, and a good staff, and you have to
have someone who's willing to work toward that end. You

'I do not intend to be intimidated by
broken windows or by being hanged in
effigy '

don't raise money just by sitting down and writing letters
and spraying them all over the landscape. In the 1950's
the Hoover Institution was in effect running down as a
result of not having very many funds. It was still a very
fine institution with excellent collections. We were
building on the world famous Russian collection and the
Chinese and Japanese and Middle Eastern collection had
started to be built up, and what you needed was someone
to take that base and build on it. That's what we did.
Q: As far as that building, how did you view your role
when you took over, and what do you think you have
accomplished?
A: We had a very fine base in the collections, but because

of the low acquisition rate, in the middle and late 1950'5,
a number of gaps were rapidly developing in the
collections. In a special research library like this, which is
world famous, if you don't keep building it all the time,
the collection is going to gradually deteriorate in quality,
and it could become a dead collection. The important
thing was to aggressively rebuild the collection. The
record will show that in the last 12 years, the book
collection has doubled in size, and the archives and special
collections about the same.
Q: What is the status of contributions to the Institute?
A: We have a fairly sizable group of generous long term
donors. There is less pressure to break new ground now
than there was in the early 1960'5. The important thing
now is to make sure you're doing a sufficiently good job,
that will merit the support of your donors. Bout on the
other hand, you're always breaking new ground.
Q: If I were a donor, why would I want to give to
Hoover?
A: The Hoover Institution is an outstanding center for
advanced study and research on political, social, and
economic change in the 20th century which has the world
famous research library as its base, and has a sizable and
variegated research and publications program. It's a
question of going out and finding potential donors who
are interested in supporting that. Our library is used by
students and professors from universities all over the
country.
Q: Recently Hoover had a $5 million endowment drive.
What is the status of the endowment now?
A: The total of endowment and invested funds is
approximately $10 million.
Q: Have you yet reached the level where income from the
endowment is sufficient to support the nut ill y .

A: We would have come close were it not for the Budget
Adjustment Program (BAP) because we get a si/able
amount of University funds, which, combined with
endowment income, is used to run the Institution.
Q: How much in University funds does Hoover receive?
A: This year slightly in excess of $600,000, from
University General Funds. The total library budget is
about $1.2 million.The endowment is managed as part of
the so-called University merged endowment.
Q: Who has control over Hoover's spending? Do you have
to go through the University finance office?
A: The best way to see this is to think of the Hoover
Institution as being comparable to a school of Stanford
University. Basically, 1 draw up the budget, in the same
way that say, the Dean of the Law School would draw up
his budget. Namely, estimates as to endowment income
for the coming year, and restrictions on its use, and a
general indication of how much in University funds
Hoover will get, and, to oversimplify, the rest is up to the
staff and director of the Hoover institution, in terms of
the amount of funds we are able to raise, and the purposes
for which we are able to raise them.
Q: Since Hoover raises its own funds, does it have more
autonomy than a regular school of the University?
A: Yes, but the autonomy really comes from the ability
of the staff and the projects they are involved with to
attract gift funds. In essence how much we can spend
depends on how much in gift funds we attract. Our
budget for the current year will run in total $2.4 million,
and a little over $600,000 of that comes from the
University, about $450,000 from endowment earnings,
and about $300,000 comes from sales of publications and
microfilms. That means that we have to use $1 million in
gift funds. Obviously, if those gift funds don't keep
coming in, the budget would have to be cut. That was one
of the real problems of the institution in the 1950's —gift
funds tended to go like a roller coaster. I introduced the
concept of building a reserve fund for current
expenditures, so that variations in gift funds wouldn't
have a roller coaster effect on expenditures. The budget
has continually increased during the last ten years, and we
have never had reserve problems.
Q: What exactly is Hoover's connection to Stanford?
A: The Hoover Institution is officially described as an
independent institution within the frame of Stanford
University. The closest analogy is basically to a school.
The major difference between the Hoover Institution and
a school is that the deans report to the Provost. However,
the V.P. for Medical Affairs reports to the President as
much as to the Provost, so there really isn't as much
difference in structure as you might think. I report to the
President formally, but most of my business is conducted
with the Provost, because library matters come under the
Provost.
Q: How has your job changed over the last twelve years?
A: My job is still to plan the overall research and library
program, and to appoint staff, and to go out and take the
lead in raising the necessary funds. In the last three and
one-half years a substantial fraction of my time has gone
into unpaid public service as a Regent of the University of
California. That is the major change that has taken place.
Q: What is the academic status of Hoover researchers?
A: Some researchers have joint appointments, and thus
are members of both the Hoover staff and one of
Stanford's departments. There are relatively few of these.
The President reviews appointments made by the Director
of the Hoover Institution. In the appointment of curators,
I will appoint a search committee on which there would
be faculty representation. This committee would make
recommendations to me, and then I would make
recommendations to the President and Board of Trustees.

At the Senior Fellow level, I consult with the other Senior
Fellows, and after we have made up our minds, my
recommendation goes to the President, who can consult
with anyone, or appoint any kind of advisory committee
that he so chooses.
Q: Do any of your staff have academic tenure?
A: Only those who hold joint appointments to Hoover
and a Stanford Department, but then the tenure is in the
department, not in the Hoover Institution.
Q: Do you have academic tenure?
A: No, I'm happy to state that the Director has tenure as
long as he satisfactorily discharges his duties. It would
make it easier to get rid of the director of the Hoover
Institution than perhaps faculty members at Stanford.
Q: Are you happy with the relationship between Stanford
and Hoover? Are there things you would like to change?
A: Basically Dr. Sterling, Mr. Hoover, and the Board of
Trustees in the late 1950's did an excellent job in drawing
up this set of relationships and other than to have closer
relationships with some departments of Stanford than we
have sometimes had, which I think is not the fault of this
arrangement, would be the only change I would want. I
do not feel that even senior fellows of the Hoover
Institution, since it is basically a research institute, should
have academic tenure.
Q: Would you like more money from Stanford, and would
more money imply greater control by Stanford?
A: I certainly would. Given the present financial situation
of Stanford, I don't think that's an immediate prospect.
But if we got more money from Stanford for the library, I
would redouble my efforts to make sure that the library is
run in a fashion acceptable to the university. I think it is
at the present time anyway. We've always bren responsive
to faculty
