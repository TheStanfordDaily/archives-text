On January 10, once upon a time, the Queen of Hearts said
to Alice, "Sentence first—verdict afterwards."
"Stuff and nonsense!" said Alice. "The idea of having the
sentence first."
"Off with her head," cried the Queen.
Later on, referring to the Mad Hatter, the Red Queen says,
"He's in prison now, being punished: and the trial doesn't even
begin until next Wednesday: and of course the crime comes last
of all."
"Suppose he never commits the crime?" asked Alice.
"That would be all the better, wouldn't it,"the Queen
replied.
If you see any mad tea parties, call our editorial people at
321-2300, ext. 4632.
