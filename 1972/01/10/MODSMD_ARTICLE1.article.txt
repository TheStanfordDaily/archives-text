# Ellsberg Labels Franklin Decision â€˜Fatuous'
## 
### ROBERT VINING 
Daniel Ellsberg, indicted on charges of conspiring to
leak the Pentagon Papers to the press, told a Stanford
audience Friday night that as far as he knew, radical Prof.
H. Bruce Franklin should not be fired.
Ellsberg began his speech by announcing he had
received an assassination threat earlier that evening.
Sharing the speakers'tables at Memorial Church with
Ellsberg were Anthony Russo, indicted along with
Ellsberg, and Russo's bride, Katherine Barkley. They were
married moments before the speech in a small chapel in
the church building. (See Story on page 6 .)
Barkley said they were married so she would not be
legally obligated to testify before the grand jury in
Russo's case.
Assassination Threat
Ellsberg said his speech would be brief because just
before the wedding he was told that "somebody proposed
to assassinate me in this audience tonight." After Ellsberg
was informed of the threat, Sheriff's deputies urged him
not to speak.
Ellsberg said of the Franklin Case: "From what I read
in that account (excerpts from the Advisory Board report
printed in Friday's Daily) I find nothing in the majority
report to criticize in Bruce Franklin's behavior... let
alone dismiss him for." The majority report of the
Advisory Board recommended Franklin's dismissal, on
grounds that the Maoist professor of English had incited
violence during last February's antiwar disruptions.
Ellsberg stated that, "To talk about sitting in as
violence in a Computation Center that's carrying on
computations for amphibious assaults is absolutely absurd
as a basis for dismissing a professor."
Ellsberg qualified his remarks on the Franklin case with
frequent statements that he knew little more about the

matter than what he had read. "It would be stupid of me
to take any flat position," he observed. Ellsberg declared
he shares Franklin's perception of the complicity of the
whole society and of universities in the war. Ellsberg
called the majority report "obtuse and fatuous" for
ignoring this complicity.
Stanford War Involvement
The former Hand Corp. researcher, who has admitted
leaking the secret Pentagon Papers to the press, asserted
"the obvious fact is that Stanford, like most other
institutions in this society, is part of a system that is
destroying the people of Indochina in a massive violence."
Ellsberg, now affiliated with M.1.T., said that although
the Advisory Board report maintains Franklin cannot be
"rehabilitated," it does not allow for the possibility of the
university changing.
Ellsberg confessed "my own bafflement" with the
problem of how to end a war "which is winding down
about as fast as my indictment is." He told the crowd of
over 2,000 that changing presidents, parties, Congresses,
or public opinion was not the answer.
Instead, he argued, people must change "the
bloody-minded values" of those who used violence for
what they felt were good purposes.
He warned that sometimes people who oppose the war
are marked by the "same arrogance, sometimes lies,
sometimes the same acceptance of violence." Ellsberg
then emphasized "that's not an oblique way of criticizing
Bruce Franklin because I do not know whether any of
that applies to Bruce Franklin."
The speech was sponsored by the Faculty Political
Action Group. Professor of Medicine Halsted Holman,
member of the executive committee of the FPAG,
introduced Ellsberg.

ASSASSINATION THREAT-Before a scheduled address to a capacity
crowd in Memorial Church, Daniel Ellsberg was informed of a telephoned
threat on his life. Listening to advisors with two Sheriff's deputies who
relayed the threat, Ellsberg decided to speak planned.
