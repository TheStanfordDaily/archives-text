## Perceptions Of The War, Stanford, And Franklin 
### 
... As I look at the situation
that's in the news here today,
which I don't know much about,
obviously, I see a couple of
parallels with the lessons that I've
drawn in Vietnam and since
Vietnam. Katherine Barkley gave
me a copy of today's paper, the
Stanford Daily, and I read the
account of the majority and
minority reports on the Franklin
case.
That obviously doesn't tell me
enough at this point about the
whole background of that or
anything else. It would be stupid
of me to take any flat position on
the thing. I can certainly say from
what I read in that account, I find
nothing in the majority report to
criticize in Bruce Franklin's
behavior that's reported there, let
alone to dismiss him for.
The statements—and I really
have not been familiar with the

case; I have not followed what
other documentation or what else
may be involved, but judging just
from those documents—the
characterization of the perception
of reality described in that
document—and you can all read
that—strikes me as an extremely
realistic perception which I
share—this is Bruce Franklin's
perception, not talking about
tactics particularly, but his
perception of the complicity of
the society as a whole, the
complicity of universities in
general and from what I can read,
this one, like the one I am part of,
MIT.
The statement that I find in
there that it cannot be expected
that if he were to stay here he
would come into a proper
relation, or an acceptable
relationship with the views of the
other members of the university,

doesn't seem to allow the
possibility that the university
might change, or change in the
direction of his perception, which
is described as a bizarre
characterization, and which is a
characterization in its own turn
which I would guess some years
from now, if consciousness
changes, will itself look pretty
bizarre.
The majority report makes
certain bows in the direction of
the particular circumstances of
the actions described, such as the
invasion of Laos, and then, so far
as I can see just totally ignores the
allegations and the perceptions
attributed to Franklin in those
circumstances, all of which seem
very sensible to me, as they are
reported there.
It reminds me very much of a
situation that arose at Harvard
shortly before I went back to

Cambridge from Rand, where the
Center for International Affairs
was bombed at night, by some
women apparently. The police
tried to get under the skin of the
women who had left their calling
card by saying the job was much
too sophisticated to have been
done by women.
When this Center was bombed.
President Pusey made a very
arresting statement, which seems
to me almost to have exactly the
tame spirit which I read in that
majority report. He said:
"Bombing rejects the very
foundations of civilization." I can
relate to that.
But it seemed a somewhat
obtuse statement from the
president of a university that had
provided a dean who had presided
over the beginning of the largest
bombing campaign in history,
McGeorge Bundy, a campaign that
started just seven years ago, or six
million tons ago. And then had
subsequently provided, from this
same Center for International
Affairs, a professor and an
associate head of that Center,
Henry Kissinger, who had
continued that bombing and
extended it to Cambodia and Laos
producing, as I say, two million
refugees in the last year and a
half.
And that seems to be the case
here. It goes through this report.
To talk about sitting in as violence
in a Computation Center that's
carrying on computations for
amphibious helicopter assaults,
and I'm speaking again, I keep
repeating, just from this
document that I've read, is, it
seems to me, absolutely absurd as
a basis for dismissing a professor.
Should such research go on in a
university? It seems to me,
obviously not.
Should there be classified
research? Should individuals be
doing classified research here at
this university or any other
university—and it's being done at
MIT, where I'm now associated?
It seems to me, obviously not.
The question is, how do you
end a war that's gone on for
twenty-five years? That's a hard
question.
If I had more time here than
I'm going to take, I'd have to start

by expressing my own bafflement
at that. It's something that I'm
continuing to work at to try to
understand.
I don't have an adequate
understanding of it. But one thing
is clear. You don't end that war
by changing a President—we've
had five who have continued that
war. You don't change it by
changing parties—we've had 25
years, 14 Democrat and 11
Republican.
You don't change it just by
getting Congress against it—the
Senate is against it in some sense,
but they continue to vote the
defense appropriations.
You don't change it just by
changing the breadth of public
opinion—73 percent want us out
now, but we're not out.
What does it take? It does seem
to me that it's very unlikely that
the university or any other
institution will come to end its
complicity which exists unless
individuals dramatize that
complicity and find ways of doing
that.
Certainly, a sit-in at a
computation center that obstructs
calculations of the sort described
seems to me an entirely
appropriate way to dramatize
that.
Having said that, and what I
say now should not be interpreted
as a comment on Bruce Franklin,
whom I don't know, and haven't
met—l know people who respect
him highly; I know that he's a
controversial figure. I don't know
what else he is. My contact is as
limited as is indicated in today's
paper, so I'm not commenting on
him, when you come down to
it—but, when we do talk about
the bombing of, in my university,
the Center for International
Studies, or Harvard, the Center
for International Affairs, while it
is obviously ludicrous to put in
the same equation or the same
sentence or in the same balance
the six million tons that have
killed hundreds of thousands of
people in Indochina, and a stick
of dynamite in one of these
places; that would be ludicrous to
equate those.
I still raise the question in my
own mind—l'm clear on what I
feel about this—as to whether

dynamite or trashing or
whatever—trashing here or
trashing there—does dramatize,
among other things, opposition to
the values—the bloody-minded
values—of my former colleagues,
myself when I was in Vietnam,
who used violence instrumentally
for what they thought were good
purposes, supported the use of
that violence with secrecy and
lies, acted arrogantly.
I do question whether in every
case the opposition to that does
not show in some cases the same
arrogance, sometimes lies,
sometimes the same acceptance of
violence. I happen to think that
those values have to be
challenged, not only the means to
which they're put, not only the
people who do them, not just
changing other people to use
violence secretly, arrogantly, and
so forth.
I want to emphasize that that's
not an oblique way of criticizing
Bruce Franklin, because I do not
know whether any of that applies
to Bruce Franklin. I know the
issue was raised by statements
such as are quoted that the
appropriate reaction to his firing
is violence today, which may or
may not be a correct quotation. I
don't know what it means to him
or not. But it does evoke that
reaction in me.
I do know I walktd through
once in Long-an in Vietnam with
a batalion of troops fired at by
the Viet Cong who were
defending their households at that
point. Never seeing them, killing
some innocent people with
artillery by mistake, losing men
but never seeing an enemy, and in
the end coming—these were
American soldiers, brothers, you
know, brothers in Vietnam, some
of them maybe are vets against
the war, I hope, now—but in the
end of that week of frustration
burning every house they came to
just so they would leave some
marks, so that something would
have happened as they passed
through.
Well, I understand why they
did that, and I understand why
people burn down ROTC
buildings or why people use
violence tactics here. I do know
that I didn't come back from

Daniel ellsberg

those people in Vietnam, and
change sides so as to pick up a
torch myself on the other side, in
opposition to the war. I don't
happen to think that that's the
tactic.
At any rate, having said that,
there remains then the necessity,
the inescapable necessity, for
finding ways of dramatizing and
changing people's minds, changing
institutions, changing distribution
of power, certainly all those
things, but in particular changing
people's consciousness so that
they cannot write, they cannot
write a document as obtuse and
fatuous as the majority report
that I read today.
Without realizing the irony of
spending words at this point,
supposedly educated people
spending words in the year 1971
to deny the obvious fact that
Stanford, like most other
institutions in this society, is part
of a system that is destroying the
people of Indochina in massive
violence. Obviously. That's so
obvious that it doesn't need a lot
of comment.
Assassinating me would, I
think, not be a way that would
get people where they wanted, the
kind of society they wanted. I
doubt that, or assassinating other
people. Or bombing other people.
But they've got to find, there
has to be a search for tactics then;
I don't know all of them. Tony
and I involved ourselves in one
exercise in truth-telling. I hope
that this university like other
universities will work with that,
will fight against secrecy on this
campus and elsewhere, against
classified information, militantly;
will find ways of turning the
heads of the people who wrote
that report, and the people who
support it, find ways of separating
this university and the institutions
that you'll be dealing with the rest
of your lives, from complicity in
operations like Vietnam. That's
the task.
It's the path of resistance, of
militant resistance, all of your
lives, and I wish you luck. We've
got a good revolutionary couple
who've been joined tonight in it. I
thank you for your thanks at the
beginning, and I'm going home to
my wife now.
