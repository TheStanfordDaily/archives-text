# exerpts from Sunday morning’s sermon
## On Dealing With Times Of Trouble 
### 
Robert mcafee brown

I had originally planned to preach a sermon
appropriate to the beginning of a new year and
the start of a fresh academic quarter. However, in
the light of the tumultuous events on this
campus of the past few days, and the likely
possibility that things aren't exactly going to be
serene during the next few days, it has seemed to
me more appropriate to preach on the topic "On
Dealing With Times of Trouble."
During a decade cf appearances in this pulpit I
think I have established a reasonably good track
record for plugging the notion that religion and
politics do mix. Nevertheless, for a reason that I
trust is fairly obvious, I do not this morning
propose to deal with the political dimension of
our local troubles, but rather with some of the
personal responses we must all try to bring to
them.
The reason is that as a member of the
Advisory Board I am a signatory to a report
submitted to President Lyman on which he has
not yet acted. My own position, spelled out in
the various minority reports, is fairly clear, and it
would be singularly inappropriate for me to use
this pulpit to push a certain point of view while
the Report is still under consideration by the
President and Board of Trustees.
However, the report is, quite predictably,
stirring up a great deal of furor on this campus,
and is the immediate, though by no means the
only, cause for increasing tension and
polarization. So I want to speak to that latter
issue in terms that do not involve commentary
on the Advisory Board report itself but do
involve reflection upon how all of us can deal
most creatively with times of trouble. People
representing all sorts of perspectives are here this
morning, and I address you all, not just a selected
few.
I
Let me take my starting point from the Old
Testament lesson of the morning, one of those
enduring insights that time has often tried to
challenge and may have occasionally dimmed,
but has never destroyed. The Psalmist is engaged
in a rhapsody of praise to God and his creation.
And when he looks beyond the heavens and the
moon and stars, he thinks of the human beings in
creation, and asks of God,
What is man that thou art mindful of him,
and the son of man that thou dost care for
him?
Yet thou hast made him little less than God,
and dost crown him with glory and honor.
Thou hast given him dominion over the works
of thy hands;
thou hast put all things under his feet.
Now that's an extraordinarily positive
description of who we are. We might be nothing:
One could inflect the question almost
scornfully: In the midst of this vast creation, of
what significance is this infinitesimal speck, man?
But no, he is only a little less than God; he is
given glory and honor; he has been made a
partner with God in the ongoing work of

creation. A breathtaking prospect.
What do such words have to do with a time of
troubles? Just this. The description applies across
the board. It applies to every man. It is not just a
description of your political allies. It is also a
description of your political opponents. It is not
just a description of Jews, but also of Arabs. It
describes the Vietcong as well as the United
States Marine. The one who is "little less than
God" is the one who opposes military
recruitment on campus as well as the one who
supports it.
Now we may quite properly feel that some of
these people are better fulfilling their high calling
as ones who are made in God's image, than
others we can think of, but to those who stand in
the Judaeo-Christian tradition, that can only be

the second and never the first thing we affirm
about all the people who surround us. We have,
every single one of us, no matter how much we
may later feel divided, a common starting point:
we share a common humanity because we are all
those to whom "glory and honor" are given by
God.
And I suggest that in a time of troubles in
particular, this reduces to a very simple and basic
primary rule of attitude and conduct: it is wrong
to demean and depersonalize your opponents.
The ad hominem argument is the easiest but also
the cheapest and least convincing kind of
argument. When you demean the personhood of
your opponent you demean your own
personhood.
This is what happens in Vietnam when
Americans refer to Vietnamese as gooks or
slopeheads. It is what happens on this campus
when, from whatever political perspective, you
try to destroy the position of your opponent
merely by questioning his integrity or sincerity,
or casting aspersions on his motivations.
No—your opponent too is only a "little less than
God," he too is one whom God "crowns with
glory and honor."
Thus a list of people made " in the image of
God" includes the whole spectrum of inspired
and confused and frightened and creative
humanity—it includes Bruce Franklin and
Richard Lyman, Aaron Mangionello and Ray
White, Gerry Foote and Larry Diamond, Hal Kahn
and Paul Hanley, George McGovern and—if I may
make what is for me an exceedingly generous
gesture—Spiro T. Agnew.
II
In addition to refusing to depersonalize our

opponents, there is a second attitude we can
bring to a time of troubles, though I warn you in
advance that it can be separated from a third
attitude only by a semi-colon. The second
attitude is this: you are entitled to believe that if
your cause is right it will prevail. Put another
way, if what you believe in and are working for
really expands the cause of righteousness, of
justice, in the world, then you need not fear its
ultimate defeat.
If you aren't comfortable saying that your
cause "is of God" as Gamaliel did, then at least
you need to believe, I think, that your cause is
"of righteousness," or that it promotes justice, or
that it is inspired by love, or something of the
sort.
This kind of affirmation provides two
important ingredients: On the one hand, it makes
possible a sense of perspective. If you believe
that what you are supporting does, for example,
enhance justice for others, the unless your life is
to be riddled with inconsistency, you must try to
act justly in bringing your point of view home to
others.
If what you seek is the liberation of the
oppressed, then you must realize that oppressive
methods of achieving that do not liberate but
only further enslave.
If you want to save some lives you don't
massively destroy many other lives—a maxim Mr.
Nixon has been honoring in the breach rather
than the observance in his recent bombing of
North Vietnam. A belief in the Tightness of our
cause can give us perspective on the Tightness of
the ways we seek to promote that cause.
On the other hand, a belief in the tightness of
our cause will make it possible for us, if
necessary, to endure momentary failures without
losing heart.
Christopher Fry once said, "The Christian is
one who can afford to fail", by which I take it he
meant that since the Christian believes that
finally the cause of righteousness is in hands
more powerful than his own, he will not lose
heart if his own contribution to the final victory
of righteousness seems minimal or even at the
time self-defeating.
And it is interesting that this sense of a
providential overseeing of history is present in a
secularized version in Marx's insistence of the
inexorability of the dialectic, and indeed the
inevitability of the final victory of the proletariat
over the bourgeoisie. I would suggest that there is
really no cause that long endures in the hearts of
men without some sense on the part of those
inspired by it that the cause is somehow
ingrained in the very nature of things, and that
they are helping, rather than hindering, the
intended purpose of creation by their espousal of
it. So, a second ingredient for a time of trouble is
that you are entitled to believe that if your cause
is right it will prevail Semi-colon!
111
For immediately on the other side of the
semi-colon must go a third thing, if the second is

not to degenerate into a self-righteous fanaticism.
The third thing is this: you must constantly be
critical of your own position, and the way in
which you are expressing it.
There is a glory in the life of the one who
feels that what he is doing is an outworking of
God's will, or the dialectic of history, or the
meaning and purpose of creation. But there is a
demonry as well, best expressed for me in that
statement I have often quoted by that famous
seventeenth century writer, "Anon." Anon
wrote, "I had rather see coming toward me a
whole regiment with drawn swords, than one
lone Calvinist convinced that he is doing the will
of God."
An uncritical acceptance of one's own cause

as right leads one to any number of excesses in
its prosecution. This is true whether one's name
is Adolf Hitler or Joseph Stalin or Richard Nixon
or George Wallace or John Calvin or Pius XII or
whoever. The moment we turn our critical
faculties only on our opponents and not on
ourselves as well, we become very dangerous
human beings.
This insight has been captured for me most
unforgettably in the epigram of Reinhold
Niebuhr: "We must fight their falsehood with
our truth, but we must also fight the falsehood in
our truth."
IV
Now sermons are usually three points long
and I've made three points. But there is another,
a fourth, that is important, I believe, to any of us
as we face times of trouble. And the fourth thing
to remember is this: you must be willing, if
necessary, to suffer for what you believe in. Let
me make very clear that this is a last thing to say,
and never a first thing. To say this first would be
to suggest that our jot is to go out and seek
suffering, as though that were somehow a good
in itself. But as Alan Paton, who certainly ought
to know, has remarked out of his many times of
trouble in South Africa, one does not seek
suffering. That, ~ays Paton, is sick. But, he goes
on, whenever one takes a stand he must be
willing to endure suffering, if it comes.
When I refer to the need to be willing to
endure suffering for the sake of that in which
one believes, I am not simply talking about
getting beaten up, or worse, though that is a part,
in our fallen world, of what often happens to
people who take stands. I am also, and even more
emphatically, talking about the suffering that
comes from being misunderstood not only by

one's enemies but even n>orp .ihatteringly by
one's friends (perhaps the greatest suffering of
all); the suffering of loneliness, of being forsaken
when the chips are down by people one thought
would stand by; the suffering of self-doubt, and
the gnawing wonder about whether one has made
a small error or perhaps a huge and apparently
irretrievable blunder.
There is no route around such suffering that
bypasses it. The only route is through
it—accepting it when it comes, not being surprised
by its presence, and being willing to keep
affirming even so, in spite of the fact that all
sorts of things seem to make affirmation difficult
if not impossible.
How does one handle that kind of response to
a time of troubles, the response of finding
one self suffering? Here the best thing I can offer
is to remind you of the way Dietrich Bonhoeffer
handled the problem when he was in prison
awaiting execution at the hands of the Gestapo
in Germany in World War 11. Bonhoeffer's answer
speaks both to Jews and to Christians.
He found himself returning again and again to
Jeremiah 45, the passage in which Baruch and
Jeremiah lament that things have gotten too
tough and they want out. Their plans seem to
have failed and the future looks absolutely bleak.
And God replies, that his plans have failed too.
He has had to see his plans at least temporarily
scrapped because of the evil of men, and to
realize that the present is a time of plucking up
rather than of planting. It grieves him too. And
the most he will promise Jeremiah and Baruch is
that he will preserve their lives as long as they are
needed to complete their part in his unfolding
plans.
That apparently sustained Baruch and
Jeremiah, and it sustained Dietrich Bonhoeffer
too, who went on to take that Jewish insight of
the presence of God in the very midst of the
reality of the world's suffering and pain, and see
it exemplified, in Christian terms now, by the
figure of the crucified Jesus, Jesus the revelation
of God as embodied in what Bonhoeffer
described as "the man for others."
And Bonhoeffer saw that as the pattern for
himself, sharing as he said, in the suffering of
God in a godless world, realizing that even in the
midst of his suffering, he was not left alone, but
that even there he was sustained and upheld by
God—and also sustained by the community of
friends to whom Bonhoeffer remained very close,
even though physically separated from them by
thick prison walls. We have that gift also in times
of trouble, and a very precious thing it is.
There is a deep mystery here, a mystery no
rational explanation has ever been able to fathom
and chart, that it can be a byproduct of suffering
that it strengthens and ennobles. That is never a
justification for the inflicting of suffering on
others, or for indifference in the face of the
suffering of others, but it is something we can
take with us into the presence of the suffering we
ourselves mav be called upon to endure.

-it is wrong to demean and
depersonalize your opponents
-you are entitled to believe
that if your cause is right
it will prevail

-you must constantly be
critical of your own position
-you must be willing, if
necessary, to suffer for what
you believe in

gesture—Spiro T. Agnew.
II
In addition to refusing to depersonalize our

opponents, there is a second attitude we can
bring to a time of troubles, though I warn you in
advance that it can be separated from a third
attitude only by a semi-colon. The second
attitude is this: you are entitled to believe that if
your cause is right it will prevail. Put another
way, if what you believe in and are working for
really expands the cause of righteousness, of
justice, in the world, then you need not fear its
ultimate defeat.
If you aren't comfortable saying that your
cause "is of God" as Gamaliel did, then at least
you need to believe, I think, that your cause is
"of righteousness," or that it promotes justice, or
that it is inspired by love, or something of the
sort.
This kind of affirmation provides two
important ingredients: On the one hand, it makes
possible a sense of perspective. If you believe
that what you are supporting does, for example,
enhance justice for others, the unless your life is
to be riddled with inconsistency, you must try to
act justly in bringing your point of view home to
others.
If what you seek is the liberation of the
oppressed, then you must realize that oppressive
methods of achieving that do not liberate but
only further enslave.
If you want to save some lives you don't
massively destroy many other lives—a maxim Mr.
Nixon has been honoring in the breach rather
than the observance in his recent bombing of
North Vietnam. A belief in the Tightness of our
cause can give us perspective on the Tightness of
the ways we seek to promote that cause.
On the other hand, a belief in the tightness of
our cause will make it possible for us, if
necessary, to endure momentary failures without
losing heart.
Christopher Fry once said, "The Christian is
one who can afford to fail", by which I take it he
meant that since the Christian believes that
finally the cause of righteousness is in hands
more powerful than his own, he will not lose
heart if his own contribution to the final victory
of righteousness seems minimal or even at the
time self-defeating.
And it is interesting that this sense of a
providential overseeing of history is present in a
secularized version in Marx's insistence of the
inexorability of the dialectic, and indeed the
inevitability of the final victory of the proletariat
over the bourgeoisie. I would suggest that there is
really no cause that long endures in the hearts of
men without some sense on the part of those
inspired by it that the cause is somehow
ingrained in the very nature of things, and that
they are helping, rather than hindering, the
intended purpose of creation by their espousal of
it. So, a second ingredient for a time of trouble is
that you are entitled to believe that if your cause
is right it will prevail Semi-colon!
111
For immediately on the other side of the
semi-colon must go a third thing, if the second is

not to degenerate into a self-righteous fanaticism.
The third thing is this: you must constantly be
critical of your own position, and the way in
which you are expressing it.
There is a glory in the life of the one who
feels that what he is doing is an outworking of
God's will, or the dialectic of history, or the
meaning and purpose of creation. But there is a
demonry as well, best expressed for me in that
statement I have often quoted by that famous
seventeenth century writer, "Anon." Anon
wrote, "I had rather see coming toward me a
whole regiment with drawn swords, than one
lone Calvinist convinced that he is doing the will
of God."
An uncritical acceptance of one's own cause

as right leads one to any number of excesses in
its prosecution. This is true whether one's name
is Adolf Hitler or Joseph Stalin or Richard Nixon
or George Wallace or John Calvin or Pius XII or
whoever. The moment we turn our critical
faculties only on our opponents and not on
ourselves as well, we become very dangerous
human beings.
This insight has been captured for me most
unforgettably in the epigram of Reinhold
Niebuhr: "We must fight their falsehood with
our truth, but we must also fight the falsehood in
our truth."
IV
Now sermons are usually three points long
and I've made three points. But there is another,
a fourth, that is important, I believe, to any of us
as we face times of trouble. And the fourth thing
to remember is this: you must be willing, if
necessary, to suffer for what you believe in. Let
me make very clear that this is a last thing to say,
and never a first thing. To say this first would be
to suggest that our jot is to go out and seek
suffering, as though that were somehow a good
in itself. But as Alan Paton, who certainly ought
to know, has remarked out of his many times of
trouble in South Africa, one does not seek
suffering. That, ~ays Paton, is sick. But, he goes
on, whenever one takes a stand he must be
willing to endure suffering, if it comes.
When I refer to the need to be willing to
endure suffering for the sake of that in which
one believes, I am not simply talking about
getting beaten up, or worse, though that is a part,
in our fallen world, of what often happens to
people who take stands. I am also, and even more
emphatically, talking about the suffering that
comes from being misunderstood not only by

one's enemies but even n>orp .ihatteringly by
one's friends (perhaps the greatest suffering of
all); the suffering of loneliness, of being forsaken
when the chips are down by people one thought
would stand by; the suffering of self-doubt, and
the gnawing wonder about whether one has made
a small error or perhaps a huge and apparently
irretrievable blunder.
There is no route around such suffering that
bypasses it. The only route is through
it—accepting it when it comes, not being surprised
by its presence, and being willing to keep
affirming even so, in spite of the fact that all
sorts of things seem to make affirmation difficult
if not impossible.
How does one handle that kind of response to
a time of troubles, the response of finding
one self suffering? Here the best thing I can offer
is to remind you of the way Dietrich Bonhoeffer
handled the problem when he was in prison
awaiting execution at the hands of the Gestapo
in Germany in World War 11. Bonhoeffer's answer
speaks both to Jews and to Christians.
He found himself returning again and again to
Jeremiah 45, the passage in which Baruch and
Jeremiah lament that things have gotten too
tough and they want out. Their plans seem to
have failed and the future looks absolutely bleak.
And God replies, that his plans have failed too.
He has had to see his plans at least temporarily
scrapped because of the evil of men, and to
realize that the present is a time of plucking up
rather than of planting. It grieves him too. And
the most he will promise Jeremiah and Baruch is
that he will preserve their lives as long as they are
needed to complete their part in his unfolding
plans.
That apparently sustained Baruch and
Jeremiah, and it sustained Dietrich Bonhoeffer
too, who went on to take that Jewish insight of
the presence of God in the very midst of the
reality of the world's suffering and pain, and see
it exemplified, in Christian terms now, by the
figure of the crucified Jesus, Jesus the revelation
of God as embodied in what Bonhoeffer
described as "the man for others."
And Bonhoeffer saw that as the pattern for
himself, sharing as he said, in the suffering of
God in a godless world, realizing that even in the
midst of his suffering, he was not left alone, but
that even there he was sustained and upheld by
God—and also sustained by the community of
friends to whom Bonhoeffer remained very close,
even though physically separated from them by
thick prison walls. We have that gift also in times
of trouble, and a very precious thing it is.
There is a deep mystery here, a mystery no
rational explanation has ever been able to fathom
and chart, that it can be a byproduct of suffering
that it strengthens and ennobles. That is never a
justification for the inflicting of suffering on
others, or for indifference in the face of the
suffering of others, but it is something we can
take with us into the presence of the suffering we
ourselves mav be called upon to endure.

-it is wrong to demean and
depersonalize your opponents

that if your cause is right
it will prevail

critical of your own position

necessary, to suffer for what
you believe in
Robert mcafee brown

I had originally planned to preach a sermon
appropriate to the beginning of a new year and
the start of a fresh academic quarter. However, in
the light of the tumultuous events on this
campus of the past few days, and the likely
possibility that things aren't exactly going to be
serene during the next few days, it has seemed to
me more appropriate to preach on the topic "On
Dealing With Times of Trouble."
During a decade cf appearances in this pulpit I
think I have established a reasonably good track
record for plugging the notion that religion and
politics do mix. Nevertheless, for a reason that I
trust is fairly obvious, I do not this morning
propose to deal with the political dimension of
our local troubles, but rather with some of the
personal responses we must all try to bring to
them.
The reason is that as a member of the
Advisory Board I am a signatory to a report
submitted to President Lyman on which he has
not yet acted. My own position, spelled out in
the various minority reports, is fairly clear, and it
would be singularly inappropriate for me to use
this pulpit to push a certain point of view while
the Report is still under consideration by the
President and Board of Trustees.
However, the report is, quite predictably,
stirring up a great deal of furor on this campus,
and is the immediate, though by no means the
only, cause for increasing tension and
polarization. So I want to speak to that latter
issue in terms that do not involve commentary
on the Advisory Board report itself but do
involve reflection upon how all of us can deal
most creatively with times of trouble. People
representing all sorts of perspectives are here this
morning, and I address you all, not just a selected
few.
I
Let me take my starting point from the Old
Testament lesson of the morning, one of those
enduring insights that time has often tried to
challenge and may have occasionally dimmed,
but has never destroyed. The Psalmist is engaged
in a rhapsody of praise to God and his creation.
And when he looks beyond the heavens and the
moon and stars, he thinks of the human beings in
creation, and asks of God,
What is man that thou art mindful of him,
and the son of man that thou dost care for
him?
Yet thou hast made him little less than God,
and dost crown him with glory and honor.
Thou hast given him dominion over the works
of thy hands;
thou hast put all things under his feet.
Now that's an extraordinarily positive
description of who we are. We might be nothing:
One could inflect the question almost
scornfully: In the midst of this vast creation, of
what significance is this infinitesimal speck, man?
But no, he is only a little less than God; he is
given glory and honor; he has been made a
partner with God in the ongoing work of

creation. A breathtaking prospect.
What do such words have to do with a time of
troubles? Just this. The description applies across
the board. It applies to every man. It is not just a
description of your political allies. It is also a
description of your political opponents. It is not
just a description of Jews, but also of Arabs. It
describes the Vietcong as well as the United
States Marine. The one who is "little less than
God" is the one who opposes military
recruitment on campus as well as the one who
supports it.
Now we may quite properly feel that some of
these people are better fulfilling their high calling
as ones who are made in God's image, than
others we can think of, but to those who stand in
the Judaeo-Christian tradition, that can only be

the second and never the first thing we affirm
about all the people who surround us. We have,
every single one of us, no matter how much we
may later feel divided, a common starting point:
we share a common humanity because we are all
those to whom "glory and honor" are given by
God.
And I suggest that in a time of troubles in
particular, this reduces to a very simple and basic
primary rule of attitude and conduct: it is wrong
to demean and depersonalize your opponents.
The ad hominem argument is the easiest but also
the cheapest and least convincing kind of
argument. When you demean the personhood of
your opponent you demean your own
personhood.
This is what happens in Vietnam when
Americans refer to Vietnamese as gooks or
slopeheads. It is what happens on this campus
when, from whatever political perspective, you
try to destroy the position of your opponent
merely by questioning his integrity or sincerity,
or casting aspersions on his motivations.
No—your opponent too is only a "little less than
God," he too is one whom God "crowns with
glory and honor."
Thus a list of people made " in the image of
God" includes the whole spectrum of inspired
and confused and frightened and creative
humanity—it includes Bruce Franklin and
Richard Lyman, Aaron Mangionello and Ray
White, Gerry Foote and Larry Diamond, Hal Kahn
and Paul Hanley, George McGovern and—if I may
make what is for me an exceedingly generous
gesture—Spiro T. Agnew.
II
In addition to refusing to depersonalize our

opponents, there is a second attitude we can
bring to a time of troubles, though I warn you in
advance that it can be separated from a third
attitude only by a semi-colon. The second
attitude is this: you are entitled to believe that if
your cause is right it will prevail. Put another
way, if what you believe in and are working for
really expands the cause of righteousness, of
justice, in the world, then you need not fear its
ultimate defeat.
If you aren't comfortable saying that your
cause "is of God" as Gamaliel did, then at least
you need to believe, I think, that your cause is
"of righteousness," or that it promotes justice, or
that it is inspired by love, or something of the
sort.
This kind of affirmation provides two
important ingredients: On the one hand, it makes
possible a sense of perspective. If you believe
that what you are supporting does, for example,
enhance justice for others, the unless your life is
to be riddled with inconsistency, you must try to
act justly in bringing your point of view home to
others.
If what you seek is the liberation of the
oppressed, then you must realize that oppressive
methods of achieving that do not liberate but
only further enslave.
If you want to save some lives you don't
massively destroy many other lives—a maxim Mr.
Nixon has been honoring in the breach rather
than the observance in his recent bombing of
North Vietnam. A belief in the Tightness of our
cause can give us perspective on the Tightness of
the ways we seek to promote that cause.
On the other hand, a belief in the tightness of
our cause will make it possible for us, if
necessary, to endure momentary failures without
losing heart.
Christopher Fry once said, "The Christian is
one who can afford to fail", by which I take it he
meant that since the Christian believes that
finally the cause of righteousness is in hands
more powerful than his own, he will not lose
heart if his own contribution to the final victory
of righteousness seems minimal or even at the
time self-defeating.
And it is interesting that this sense of a
providential overseeing of history is present in a
secularized version in Marx's insistence of the
inexorability of the dialectic, and indeed the
inevitability of the final victory of the proletariat
over the bourgeoisie. I would suggest that there is
really no cause that long endures in the hearts of
men without some sense on the part of those
inspired by it that the cause is somehow
ingrained in the very nature of things, and that
they are helping, rather than hindering, the
intended purpose of creation by their espousal of
it. So, a second ingredient for a time of trouble is
that you are entitled to believe that if your cause
is right it will prevail Semi-colon!
111
For immediately on the other side of the
semi-colon must go a third thing, if the second is

not to degenerate into a self-righteous fanaticism.
The third thing is this: you must constantly be
critical of your own position, and the way in
which you are expressing it.
There is a glory in the life of the one who

An uncritical acceptance of one's own cause

is Adolf Hitler or Joseph Stalin or Richard Nixon
or George Wallace or John Calvin or Pius XII or
whoever. The moment we turn our critical

human beings.
This insight has been captured for me most
unforgettably in the epigram of Reinhold

on, whenever one takes a stand he must be
willing to endure suffering, if it comes.
When I refer to the need to be willing to
endure suffering for the sake of that in which
one believes, I am not simply talking about
getting beaten up, or worse, though that is a part,
in our fallen world, of what often happens to
people who take stands. I am also, and even more
emphatically, talking about the suffering that
comes from being misunderstood not only by

one's enemies but even n>orp .ihatteringly by
one's friends (perhaps the greatest suffering of
all); the suffering of loneliness, of being forsaken
when the chips are down by people one thought
would stand by; the suffering of self-doubt, and
the gnawing wonder about whether one has made
a small error or perhaps a huge and apparently
irretrievable blunder.
There is no route around such suffering that
bypasses it. The only route is through
it—accepting it when it comes, not being surprised
by its presence, and being willing to keep
affirming even so, in spite of the fact that all
sorts of things seem to make affirmation difficult
if not impossible.
How does one handle that kind of response to
a time of troubles, the response of finding
one self suffering? Here the best thing I can offer
is to remind you of the way Dietrich Bonhoeffer
handled the problem when he was in prison
awaiting execution at the hands of the Gestapo
in Germany in World War 11. Bonhoeffer's answer
speaks both to Jews and to Christians.
He found himself returning again and again to
Jeremiah 45, the passage in which Baruch and
Jeremiah lament that things have gotten too
tough and they want out. Their plans seem to
have failed and the future looks absolutely bleak.
And God replies, that his plans have failed too.
He has had to see his plans at least temporarily
scrapped because of the evil of men, and to
realize that the present is a time of plucking up
rather than of planting. It grieves him too. And
the most he will promise Jeremiah and Baruch is
that he will preserve their lives as long as they are
needed to complete their part in his unfolding
plans.
That apparently sustained Baruch and
Jeremiah, and it sustained Dietrich Bonhoeffer
too, who went on to take that Jewish insight of
the presence of God in the very midst of the
reality of the world's suffering and pain, and see
it exemplified, in Christian terms now, by the
figure of the crucified Jesus, Jesus the revelation
of God as embodied in what Bonhoeffer
described as "the man for others."
And Bonhoeffer saw that as the pattern for
himself, sharing as he said, in the suffering of
God in a godless world, realizing that even in the
midst of his suffering, he was not left alone, but
that even there he was sustained and upheld by
God—and also sustained by the community of
friends to whom Bonhoeffer remained very close,
even though physically separated from them by
thick prison walls. We have that gift also in times
of trouble, and a very precious thing it is.
There is a deep mystery here, a mystery no
rational explanation has ever been able to fathom
and chart, that it can be a byproduct of suffering
that it strengthens and ennobles. That is never a
justification for the inflicting of suffering on
others, or for indifference in the face of the
suffering of others, but it is something we can
take with us into the presence of the suffering we
ourselves mav be called upon to endure.

I had originally planned to preach a sermon
appropriate to the beginning of a new year and
the start of a fresh academic quarter. However, in
the light of the tumultuous events on this
campus of the past few days, and the likely
possibility that things aren't exactly going to be
serene during the next few days, it has seemed to
me more appropriate to preach on the topic "On
Dealing With Times of Trouble."
During a decade cf appearances in this pulpit I
think I have established a reasonably good track
record for plugging the notion that religion and
politics do mix. Nevertheless, for a reason that I
trust is fairly obvious, I do not this morning
propose to deal with the political dimension of
our local troubles, but rather with some of the
personal responses we must all try to bring to
them.
The reason is that as a member of the
Advisory Board I am a signatory to a report
submitted to President Lyman on which he has
not yet acted. My own position, spelled out in
the various minority reports, is fairly clear, and it
would be singularly inappropriate for me to use
this pulpit to push a certain point of view while
the Report is still under consideration by the
President and Board of Trustees.
However, the report is, quite predictably,
stirring up a great deal of furor on this campus,
and is the immediate, though by no means the
only, cause for increasing tension and
polarization. So I want to speak to that latter
issue in terms that do not involve commentary
on the Advisory Board report itself but do
involve reflection upon how all of us can deal
most creatively with times of trouble. People
representing all sorts of perspectives are here this
morning, and I address you all, not just a selected
few.
I
Let me take my starting point from the Old
Testament lesson of the morning, one of those
enduring insights that time has often tried to
challenge and may have occasionally dimmed,
but has never destroyed. The Psalmist is engaged
in a rhapsody of praise to God and his creation.
And when he looks beyond the heavens and the
moon and stars, he thinks of the human beings in
creation, and asks of God,
What is man that thou art mindful of him,
and the son of man that thou dost care for
him?
Yet thou hast made him little less than God,
and dost crown him with glory and honor.
Thou hast given him dominion over the works
of thy hands;
thou hast put all things under his feet.
Now that's an extraordinarily positive
description of who we are. We might be nothing:
One could inflect the question almost
scornfully: In the midst of this vast creation, of
what significance is this infinitesimal speck, man?
But no, he is only a little less than God; he is
given glory and honor; he has been made a
partner with God in the ongoing work of

creation. A breathtaking prospect.
What do such words have to do with a time of
troubles? Just this. The description applies across
the board. It applies to every man. It is not just a
description of your political allies. It is also a
description of your political opponents. It is not
just a description of Jews, but also of Arabs. It
describes the Vietcong as well as the United
States Marine. The one who is "little less than
God" is the one who opposes military
recruitment on campus as well as the one who
supports it.
Now we may quite properly feel that some of
these people are better fulfilling their high calling
as ones who are made in God's image, than
others we can think of, but to those who stand in
the Judaeo-Christian tradition, that can only be

the second and never the first thing we affirm
about all the people who surround us. We have,
every single one of us, no matter how much we
may later feel divided, a common starting point:
we share a common humanity because we are all
those to whom "glory and honor" are given by
God.
And I suggest that in a time of troubles in
particular, this reduces to a very simple and basic
primary rule of attitude and conduct: it is wrong
to demean and depersonalize your opponents.
The ad hominem argument is the easiest but also
the cheapest and least convincing kind of
argument. When you demean the personhood of
your opponent you demean your own
personhood.
This is what happens in Vietnam when
Americans refer to Vietnamese as gooks or
slopeheads. It is what happens on this campus
when, from whatever political perspective, you
try to destroy the position of your opponent
merely by questioning his integrity or sincerity,
or casting aspersions on his motivations.
No—your opponent too is only a "little less than
God," he too is one whom God "crowns with
glory and honor."
Thus a list of people made " in the image of
God" includes the whole spectrum of inspired
and confused and frightened and creative
humanity—it includes Bruce Franklin and
Richard Lyman, Aaron Mangionello and Ray
White, Gerry Foote and Larry Diamond, Hal Kahn
and Paul Hanley, George McGovern and—if I may
make what is for me an exceedingly generous
gesture—Spiro T. Agnew.
II
In addition to refusing to depersonalize our

opponents, there is a second attitude we can
bring to a time of troubles, though I warn you in
advance that it can be separated from a third
attitude only by a semi-colon. The second
attitude is this: you are entitled to believe that if
your cause is right it will prevail. Put another
way, if what you believe in and are working for
really expands the cause of righteousness, of
justice, in the world, then you need not fear its
ultimate defeat.
If you aren't comfortable saying that your
cause "is of God" as Gamaliel did, then at least
you need to believe, I think, that your cause is
"of righteousness," or that it promotes justice, or
that it is inspired by love, or something of the
sort.
This kind of affirmation provides two
important ingredients: On the one hand, it makes
possible a sense of perspective. If you believe
that what you are supporting does, for example,
enhance justice for others, the unless your life is
to be riddled with inconsistency, you must try to
act justly in bringing your point of view home to
others.
If what you seek is the liberation of the
oppressed, then you must realize that oppressive
methods of achieving that do not liberate but
only further enslave.
If you want to save some lives you don't
massively destroy many other lives—a maxim Mr.
Nixon has been honoring in the breach rather
than the observance in his recent bombing of
North Vietnam. A belief in the Tightness of our
cause can give us perspective on the Tightness of
the ways we seek to promote that cause.
On the other hand, a belief in the tightness of
our cause will make it possible for us, if
necessary, to endure momentary failures without
losing heart.
Christopher Fry once said, "The Christian is
one who can afford to fail", by which I take it he
meant that since the Christian believes that
finally the cause of righteousness is in hands
more powerful than his own, he will not lose
heart if his own contribution to the final victory
of righteousness seems minimal or even at the
time self-defeating.
And it is interesting that this sense of a
providential overseeing of history is present in a
secularized version in Marx's insistence of the
inexorability of the dialectic, and indeed the
inevitability of the final victory of the proletariat
over the bourgeoisie. I would suggest that there is
really no cause that long endures in the hearts of
men without some sense on the part of those
inspired by it that the cause is somehow
ingrained in the very nature of things, and that
they are helping, rather than hindering, the
intended purpose of creation by their espousal of
it. So, a second ingredient for a time of trouble is
that you are entitled to believe that if your cause
is right it will prevail Semi-colon!
111
For immediately on the other side of the
semi-colon must go a third thing, if the second is

not to degenerate into a self-righteous fanaticism.
The third thing is this: you must constantly be
critical of your own position, and the way in
which you are expressing it.
There is a glory in the life of the one who
feels that what he is doing is an outworking of
God's will, or the dialectic of history, or the
meaning and purpose of creation. But there is a
demonry as well, best expressed for me in that
statement I have often quoted by that famous
seventeenth century writer, "Anon." Anon
wrote, "I had rather see coming toward me a
whole regiment with drawn swords, than one
lone Calvinist convinced that he is doing the will
of God."
An uncritical acceptance of one's own cause

as right leads one to any number of excesses in
its prosecution. This is true whether one's name
is Adolf Hitler or Joseph Stalin or Richard Nixon
or George Wallace or John Calvin or Pius XII or
whoever. The moment we turn our critical
faculties only on our opponents and not on
ourselves as well, we become very dangerous
human beings.
This insight has been captured for me most
unforgettably in the epigram of Reinhold
Niebuhr: "We must fight their falsehood with
our truth, but we must also fight the falsehood in
our truth."
IV
Now sermons are usually three points long
and I've made three points. But there is another,
a fourth, that is important, I believe, to any of us
as we face times of trouble. And the fourth thing
to remember is this: you must be willing, if
necessary, to suffer for what you believe in. Let
me make very clear that this is a last thing to say,
and never a first thing. To say this first would be
to suggest that our jot is to go out and seek
suffering, as though that were somehow a good
in itself. But as Alan Paton, who certainly ought
to know, has remarked out of his many times of
trouble in South Africa, one does not seek
suffering. That, ~ays Paton, is sick. But, he goes
on, whenever one takes a stand he must be
willing to endure suffering, if it comes.
When I refer to the need to be willing to
endure suffering for the sake of that in which
one believes, I am not simply talking about
getting beaten up, or worse, though that is a part,
in our fallen world, of what often happens to
people who take stands. I am also, and even more
emphatically, talking about the suffering that
comes from being misunderstood not only by

one's enemies but even n>orp .ihatteringly by
one's friends (perhaps the greatest suffering of
all); the suffering of loneliness, of being forsaken
when the chips are down by people one thought
would stand by; the suffering of self-doubt, and
the gnawing wonder about whether one has made
a small error or perhaps a huge and apparently
irretrievable blunder.
There is no route around such suffering that
bypasses it. The only route is through
it—accepting it when it comes, not being surprised
by its presence, and being willing to keep
affirming even so, in spite of the fact that all
sorts of things seem to make affirmation difficult
if not impossible.
How does one handle that kind of response to

realize that the present is a time of plucking up
rather than of planting. It grieves him too. And
the most he will promise Jeremiah and Baruch is
that he will preserve their lives as long as they are

stirring up a great deal of furor on this campus,
and is the immediate, though by no means the
only, cause for increasing tension and
polarization. So I want to speak to that latter
issue in terms that do not involve commentary
on the Advisory Board report itself but do
involve reflection upon how all of us can deal
most creatively with times of trouble. People
representing all sorts of perspectives are here this
morning, and I address you all, not just a selected
few.
I
Let me take my starting point from the Old
Testament lesson of the morning, one of those
enduring insights that time has often tried to
challenge and may have occasionally dimmed,
but has never destroyed. The Psalmist is engaged
in a rhapsody of praise to God and his creation.
And when he looks beyond the heavens and the
moon and stars, he thinks of the human beings in
creation, and asks of God,
What is man that thou art mindful of him,
and the son of man that thou dost care for
him?
Yet thou hast made him little less than God,
and dost crown him with glory and honor.
Thou hast given him dominion over the works
of thy hands;
thou hast put all things under his feet.
Now that's an extraordinarily positive
description of who we are. We might be nothing:
One could inflect the question almost
scornfully: In the midst of this vast creation, of
what significance is this infinitesimal speck, man?
But no, he is only a little less than God; he is
given glory and honor; he has been made a
partner with God in the ongoing work of

creation. A breathtaking prospect.
What do such words have to do with a time of
troubles? Just this. The description applies across
the board. It applies to every man. It is not just a
description of your political allies. It is also a
description of your political opponents. It is not
just a description of Jews, but also of Arabs. It
describes the Vietcong as well as the United
States Marine. The one who is "little less than
God" is the one who opposes military
recruitment on campus as well as the one who
supports it.
Now we may quite properly feel that some of
these people are better fulfilling their high calling
as ones who are made in God's image, than
others we can think of, but to those who stand in
the Judaeo-Christian tradition, that can only be

the second and never the first thing we affirm
about all the people who surround us. We have,
every single one of us, no matter how much we
may later feel divided, a common starting point:
we share a common humanity because we are all
those to whom "glory and honor" are given by
God.
And I suggest that in a time of troubles in
particular, this reduces to a very simple and basic
primary rule of attitude and conduct: it is wrong
to demean and depersonalize your opponents.
The ad hominem argument is the easiest but also
the cheapest and least convincing kind of
argument. When you demean the personhood of
your opponent you demean your own
personhood.
This is what happens in Vietnam when
Americans refer to Vietnamese as gooks or
slopeheads. It is what happens on this campus
when, from whatever political perspective, you
try to destroy the position of your opponent
merely by questioning his integrity or sincerity,
or casting aspersions on his motivations.
No—your opponent too is only a "little less than
God," he too is one whom God "crowns with
glory and honor."
Thus a list of people made " in the image of
God" includes the whole spectrum of inspired
and confused and frightened and creative
humanity—it includes Bruce Franklin and
Richard Lyman, Aaron Mangionello and Ray
White, Gerry Foote and Larry Diamond, Hal Kahn
and Paul Hanley, George McGovern and—if I may
make what is for me an exceedingly generous
gesture—Spiro T. Agnew.
II
In addition to refusing to depersonalize our

opponents, there is a second attitude we can
bring to a time of troubles, though I warn you in
advance that it can be separated from a third
attitude only by a semi-colon. The second
attitude is this: you are entitled to believe that if
your cause is right it will prevail. Put another
way, if what you believe in and are working for
really expands the cause of righteousness, of
justice, in the world, then you need not fear its
ultimate defeat.
If you aren't comfortable saying that your
cause "is of God" as Gamaliel did, then at least
you need to believe, I think, that your cause is
"of righteousness," or that it promotes justice, or
that it is inspired by love, or something of the
sort.
This kind of affirmation provides two
important ingredients: On the one hand, it makes
possible a sense of perspective. If you believe
that what you are supporting does, for example,
enhance justice for others, the unless your life is
to be riddled with inconsistency, you must try to
act justly in bringing your point of view home to
others.
If what you seek is the liberation of the
oppressed, then you must realize that oppressive
methods of achieving that do not liberate but
only further enslave.
If you want to save some lives you don't
massively destroy many other lives—a maxim Mr.
Nixon has been honoring in the breach rather
than the observance in his recent bombing of
North Vietnam. A belief in the Tightness of our
cause can give us perspective on the Tightness of
the ways we seek to promote that cause.
On the other hand, a belief in the tightness of
our cause will make it possible for us, if
necessary, to endure momentary failures without
losing heart.
Christopher Fry once said, "The Christian is
one who can afford to fail", by which I take it he
meant that since the Christian believes that
finally the cause of righteousness is in hands
more powerful than his own, he will not lose
heart if his own contribution to the final victory
of righteousness seems minimal or even at the
time self-defeating.
And it is interesting that this sense of a
providential overseeing of history is present in a
secularized version in Marx's insistence of the
inexorability of the dialectic, and indeed the
inevitability of the final victory of the proletariat
over the bourgeoisie. I would suggest that there is
really no cause that long endures in the hearts of
men without some sense on the part of those
inspired by it that the cause is somehow
ingrained in the very nature of things, and that
they are helping, rather than hindering, the
intended purpose of creation by their espousal of
it. So, a second ingredient for a time of trouble is
that you are entitled to believe that if your cause
is right it will prevail Semi-colon!
111
For immediately on the other side of the
semi-colon must go a third thing, if the second is

not to degenerate into a self-righteous fanaticism.
The third thing is this: you must constantly be
critical of your own position, and the way in
which you are expressing it.
There is a glory in the life of the one who
feels that what he is doing is an outworking of
God's will, or the dialectic of history, or the
meaning and purpose of creation. But there is a
demonry as well, best expressed for me in that
statement I have often quoted by that famous
seventeenth century writer, "Anon." Anon
wrote, "I had rather see coming toward me a
whole regiment with drawn swords, than one
lone Calvinist convinced that he is doing the will
of God."
An uncritical acceptance of one's own cause

as right leads one to any number of excesses in
its prosecution. This is true whether one's name
is Adolf Hitler or Joseph Stalin or Richard Nixon
or George Wallace or John Calvin or Pius XII or
whoever. The moment we turn our critical
faculties only on our opponents and not on
ourselves as well, we become very dangerous
human beings.
This insight has been captured for me most
unforgettably in the epigram of Reinhold
Niebuhr: "We must fight their falsehood with
our truth, but we must also fight the falsehood in
our truth."
IV
Now sermons are usually three points long
and I've made three points. But there is another,
a fourth, that is important, I believe, to any of us
as we face times of trouble. And the fourth thing
to remember is this: you must be willing, if
necessary, to suffer for what you believe in. Let
me make very clear that this is a last thing to say,
and never a first thing. To say this first would be
to suggest that our jot is to go out and seek
suffering, as though that were somehow a good
in itself. But as Alan Paton, who certainly ought
to know, has remarked out of his many times of
trouble in South Africa, one does not seek
suffering. That, ~ays Paton, is sick. But, he goes
on, whenever one takes a stand he must be
willing to endure suffering, if it comes.
When I refer to the need to be willing to
endure suffering for the sake of that in which
one believes, I am not simply talking about
getting beaten up, or worse, though that is a part,
in our fallen world, of what often happens to
people who take stands. I am also, and even more
emphatically, talking about the suffering that
comes from being misunderstood not only by

one's enemies but even n>orp .ihatteringly by
one's friends (perhaps the greatest suffering of
all); the suffering of loneliness, of being forsaken
when the chips are down by people one thought
would stand by; the suffering of self-doubt, and
the gnawing wonder about whether one has made
a small error or perhaps a huge and apparently
irretrievable blunder.
There is no route around such suffering that
bypasses it. The only route is through
it—accepting it when it comes, not being surprised
by its presence, and being willing to keep
affirming even so, in spite of the fact that all
sorts of things seem to make affirmation difficult
if not impossible.
How does one handle that kind of response to
a time of troubles, the response of finding
one self suffering? Here the best thing I can offer
is to remind you of the way Dietrich Bonhoeffer
handled the problem when he was in prison
awaiting execution at the hands of the Gestapo
in Germany in World War 11. Bonhoeffer's answer
speaks both to Jews and to Christians.
He found himself returning again and again to
Jeremiah 45, the passage in which Baruch and
Jeremiah lament that things have gotten too
tough and they want out. Their plans seem to
have failed and the future looks absolutely bleak.
And God replies, that his plans have failed too.
He has had to see his plans at least temporarily
scrapped because of the evil of men, and to
realize that the present is a time of plucking up
rather than of planting. It grieves him too. And
the most he will promise Jeremiah and Baruch is
that he will preserve their lives as long as they are
needed to complete their part in his unfolding
plans.
That apparently sustained Baruch and
Jeremiah, and it sustained Dietrich Bonhoeffer
too, who went on to take that Jewish insight of
the presence of God in the very midst of the
reality of the world's suffering and pain, and see
it exemplified, in Christian terms now, by the
figure of the crucified Jesus, Jesus the revelation
of God as embodied in what Bonhoeffer
described as "the man for others."
And Bonhoeffer saw that as the pattern for
himself, sharing as he said, in the suffering of
God in a godless world, realizing that even in the
midst of his suffering, he was not left alone, but
that even there he was sustained and upheld by
God—and also sustained by the community of
friends to whom Bonhoeffer remained very close,
even though physically separated from them by
thick prison walls. We have that gift also in times
of trouble, and a very precious thing it is.
There is a deep mystery here, a mystery no
rational explanation has ever been able to fathom
and chart, that it can be a byproduct of suffering
that it strengthens and ennobles. That is never a
justification for the inflicting of suffering on
others, or for indifference in the face of the
suffering of others, but it is something we can
take with us into the presence of the suffering we
ourselves mav be called upon to endure.

-it is wrong to demean and
depersonalize your opponents
-you are entitled to believe
that if your cause is right
it will prevail

-you must constantly be
critical of your own position
-you must be willing, if
necessary, to suffer for what
you believe in

I had originally planned to preach a sermon
appropriate to the beginning of a new year and
the start of a fresh academic quarter. However, in
the light of the tumultuous events on this
campus of the past few days, and the likely
possibility that things aren't exactly going to be
serene during the next few days, it has seemed to
me more appropriate to preach on the topic "On
Dealing With Times of Trouble."
During a decade cf appearances in this pulpit I
think I have established a reasonably good track
record for plugging the notion that religion and
politics do mix. Nevertheless, for a reason that I
trust is fairly obvious, I do not this morning
propose to deal with the political dimension of
our local troubles, but rather with some of the
personal responses we must all try to bring to
them.
The reason is that as a member of the
Advisory Board I am a signatory to a report
submitted to President Lyman on which he has
not yet acted. My own position, spelled out in
the various minority reports, is fairly clear, and it
would be singularly inappropriate for me to use
this pulpit to push a certain point of view while
the Report is still under consideration by the
President and Board of Trustees.
However, the report is, quite predictably,
stirring up a great deal of furor on this campus,
and is the immediate, though by no means the
only, cause for increasing tension and
polarization. So I want to speak to that latter
issue in terms that do not involve commentary

methods of achieving that do not liberate but
only further enslave.
If you want to save some lives you don't
massively destroy many other lives—a maxim Mr.
Nixon has been honoring in the breach rather
than the observance in his recent bombing of
North Vietnam. A belief in the Tightness of our
cause can give us perspective on the Tightness of
the ways we seek to promote that cause.
On the other hand, a belief in the tightness of
our cause will make it possible for us, if
necessary, to endure momentary failures without
losing heart.
Christopher Fry once said, "The Christian is
one who can afford to fail", by which I take it he
meant that since the Christian believes that
finally the cause of righteousness is in hands
more powerful than his own, he will not lose
heart if his own contribution to the final victory
of righteousness seems minimal or even at the
time self-defeating.
And it is interesting that this sense of a
providential overseeing of history is present in a
secularized version in Marx's insistence of the
inexorability of the dialectic, and indeed the
inevitability of the final victory of the proletariat
over the bourgeoisie. I would suggest that there is
really no cause that long endures in the hearts of
men without some sense on the part of those
inspired by it that the cause is somehow
ingrained in the very nature of things, and that
they are helping, rather than hindering, the
intended purpose of creation by their espousal of
it. So, a second ingredient for a time of trouble is
that you are entitled to believe that if your cause
is right it will prevail Semi-colon!
111
For immediately on the other side of the
semi-colon must go a third thing, if the second is

not to degenerate into a self-righteous fanaticism.
The third thing is this: you must constantly be
critical of your own position, and the way in
which you are expressing it.
There is a glory in the life of the one who
feels that what he is doing is an outworking of
God's will, or the dialectic of history, or the
meaning and purpose of creation. But there is a
demonry as well, best expressed for me in that
statement I have often quoted by that famous
seventeenth century writer, "Anon." Anon
wrote, "I had rather see coming toward me a
whole regiment with drawn swords, than one
lone Calvinist convinced that he is doing the will
of God."
An uncritical acceptance of one's own cause

as right leads one to any number of excesses in
its prosecution. This is true whether one's name
is Adolf Hitler or Joseph Stalin or Richard Nixon
or George Wallace or John Calvin or Pius XII or
whoever. The moment we turn our critical
faculties only on our opponents and not on
ourselves as well, we become very dangerous
human beings.
This insight has been captured for me most
unforgettably in the epigram of Reinhold
Niebuhr: "We must fight their falsehood with
our truth, but we must also fight the falsehood in
our truth."
IV
Now sermons are usually three points long
and I've made three points. But there is another,
a fourth, that is important, I believe, to any of us
as we face times of trouble. And the fourth thing
to remember is this: you must be willing, if
necessary, to suffer for what you believe in. Let
me make very clear that this is a last thing to say,
and never a first thing. To say this first would be
to suggest that our jot is to go out and seek
suffering, as though that were somehow a good
in itself. But as Alan Paton, who certainly ought
to know, has remarked out of his many times of
trouble in South Africa, one does not seek
suffering. That, ~ays Paton, is sick. But, he goes
on, whenever one takes a stand he must be
willing to endure suffering, if it comes.
When I refer to the need to be willing to
endure suffering for the sake of that in which
one believes, I am not simply talking about
getting beaten up, or worse, though that is a part,
in our fallen world, of what often happens to
people who take stands. I am also, and even more
emphatically, talking about the suffering that
comes from being misunderstood not only by

one's enemies but even n>orp .ihatteringly by
one's friends (perhaps the greatest suffering of
all); the suffering of loneliness, of being forsaken
when the chips are down by people one thought
would stand by; the suffering of self-doubt, and
the gnawing wonder about whether one has made
a small error or perhaps a huge and apparently
irretrievable blunder.
There is no route around such suffering that
bypasses it. The only route is through
it—accepting it when it comes, not being surprised
by its presence, and being willing to keep
affirming even so, in spite of the fact that all
sorts of things seem to make affirmation difficult
if not impossible.
How does one handle that kind of response to
a time of troubles, the response of finding
one self suffering? Here the best thing I can offer
is to remind you of the way Dietrich Bonhoeffer
handled the problem when he was in prison
awaiting execution at the hands of the Gestapo
in Germany in World War 11. Bonhoeffer's answer
speaks both to Jews and to Christians.
He found himself returning again and again to
Jeremiah 45, the passage in which Baruch and
Jeremiah lament that things have gotten too
tough and they want out. Their plans seem to
have failed and the future looks absolutely bleak.
And God replies, that his plans have failed too.
He has had to see his plans at least temporarily
scrapped because of the evil of men, and to
realize that the present is a time of plucking up
rather than of planting. It grieves him too. And
the most he will promise Jeremiah and Baruch is
that he will preserve their lives as long as they are
needed to complete their part in his unfolding
plans.
That apparently sustained Baruch and
Jeremiah, and it sustained Dietrich Bonhoeffer
too, who went on to take that Jewish insight of
the presence of God in the very midst of the
reality of the world's suffering and pain, and see
it exemplified, in Christian terms now, by the
figure of the crucified Jesus, Jesus the revelation
of God as embodied in what Bonhoeffer
described as "the man for others."
And Bonhoeffer saw that as the pattern for
himself, sharing as he said, in the suffering of
God in a godless world, realizing that even in the
midst of his suffering, he was not left alone, but
that even there he was sustained and upheld by
God—and also sustained by the community of
friends to whom Bonhoeffer remained very close,
even though physically separated from them by
thick prison walls. We have that gift also in times
of trouble, and a very precious thing it is.
There is a deep mystery here, a mystery no
rational explanation has ever been able to fathom
and chart, that it can be a byproduct of suffering
that it strengthens and ennobles. That is never a
justification for the inflicting of suffering on
others, or for indifference in the face of the
suffering of others, but it is something we can
take with us into the presence of the suffering we
ourselves mav be called upon to endure.

-it is wrong to demean and
depersonalize your opponents
-you are entitled to believe
that if your cause is right
it will prevail

-you must constantly be
critical of your own position
-you must be willing, if
necessary, to suffer for what
you believe in
Robert mcafee brown

I had originally planned to preach a sermon
appropriate to the beginning of a new year and
the start of a fresh academic quarter. However, in
the light of the tumultuous events on this
campus of the past few days, and the likely
possibility that things aren't exactly going to be
serene during the next few days, it has seemed to
me more appropriate to preach on the topic "On
Dealing With Times of Trouble."
During a decade cf appearances in this pulpit I
think I have established a reasonably good track
record for plugging the notion that religion and
politics do mix. Nevertheless, for a reason that I
trust is fairly obvious, I do not this morning
propose to deal with the political dimension of
our local troubles, but rather with some of the
personal responses we must all try to bring to
them.
The reason is that as a member of the
Advisory Board I am a signatory to a report
submitted to President Lyman on which he has
not yet acted. My own position, spelled out in
the various minority reports, is fairly clear, and it
would be singularly inappropriate for me to use
this pulpit to push a certain point of view while
the Report is still under consideration by the
President and Board of Trustees.
However, the report is, quite predictably,
stirring up a great deal of furor on this campus,
and is the immediate, though by no means the
only, cause for increasing tension and
polarization. So I want to speak to that latter
issue in terms that do not involve commentary
on the Advisory Board report itself but do
involve reflection upon how all of us can deal
most creatively with times of trouble. People
representing all sorts of perspectives are here this
morning, and I address you all, not just a selected
few.
I
Let me take my starting point from the Old
Testament lesson of the morning, one of those
enduring insights that time has often tried to
challenge and may have occasionally dimmed,
but has never destroyed. The Psalmist is engaged
in a rhapsody of praise to God and his creation.
And when he looks beyond the heavens and the
moon and stars, he thinks of the human beings in
creation, and asks of God,
What is man that thou art mindful of him,
and the son of man that thou dost care for
him?
Yet thou hast made him little less than God,
and dost crown him with glory and honor.
Thou hast given him dominion over the works
of thy hands;
thou hast put all things under his feet.
Now that's an extraordinarily positive
description of who we are. We might be nothing:
One could inflect the question almost
scornfully: In the midst of this vast creation, of
what significance is this infinitesimal speck, man?
But no, he is only a little less than God; he is
given glory and honor; he has been made a
partner with God in the ongoing work of

creation. A breathtaking prospect.
What do such words have to do with a time of
troubles? Just this. The description applies across
the board. It applies to every man. It is not just a
description of your political allies. It is also a
description of your political opponents. It is not
just a description of Jews, but also of Arabs. It
describes the Vietcong as well as the United
States Marine. The one who is "little less than
God" is the one who opposes military
recruitment on campus as well as the one who
supports it.
Now we may quite properly feel that some of
these people are better fulfilling their high calling
as ones who are made in God's image, than
others we can think of, but to those who stand in
the Judaeo-Christian tradition, that can only be

the second and never the first thing we affirm
about all the people who surround us. We have,
every single one of us, no matter how much we
may later feel divided, a common starting point:
we share a common humanity because we are all
those to whom "glory and honor" are given by
God.
And I suggest that in a time of troubles in
particular, this reduces to a very simple and basic
primary rule of attitude and conduct: it is wrong
to demean and depersonalize your opponents.
The ad hominem argument is the easiest but also
the cheapest and least convincing kind of
argument. When you demean the personhood of
your opponent you demean your own
personhood.
This is what happens in Vietnam when
Americans refer to Vietnamese as gooks or
slopeheads. It is what happens on this campus
when, from whatever political perspective, you
try to destroy the position of your opponent
merely by questioning his integrity or sincerity,
or casting aspersions on his motivations.
No—your opponent too is only a "little less than
God," he too is one whom God "crowns with
glory and honor."
Thus a list of people made " in the image of
God" includes the whole spectrum of inspired
and confused and frightened and creative
humanity—it includes Bruce Franklin and
Richard Lyman, Aaron Mangionello and Ray
White, Gerry Foote and Larry Diamond, Hal Kahn
and Paul Hanley, George McGovern and—if I may
make what is for me an exceedingly generous
gesture—Spiro T. Agnew.
II
In addition to refusing to depersonalize our

opponents, there is a second attitude we can
bring to a time of troubles, though I warn you in
advance that it can be separated from a third
attitude only by a semi-colon. The second
attitude is this: you are entitled to believe that if
your cause is right it will prevail. Put another
way, if what you believe in and are working for
really expands the cause of righteousness, of
justice, in the world, then you need not fear its
ultimate defeat.
If you aren't comfortable saying that your
cause "is of God" as Gamaliel did, then at least
you need to believe, I think, that your cause is
"of righteousness," or that it promotes justice, or
that it is inspired by love, or something of the
sort.
This kind of affirmation provides two
important ingredients: On the one hand, it makes
possible a sense of perspective. If you believe
that what you are supporting does, for example,
enhance justice for others, the unless your life is
to be riddled with inconsistency, you must try to
act justly in bringing your point of view home to
others.
If what you seek is the liberation of the
oppressed, then you must realize that oppressive
methods of achieving that do not liberate but
only further enslave.
If you want to save some lives you don't
massively destroy many other lives—a maxim Mr.
Nixon has been honoring in the breach rather
than the observance in his recent bombing of
North Vietnam. A belief in the Tightness of our
cause can give us perspective on the Tightness of
the ways we seek to promote that cause.
On the other hand, a belief in the tightness of
our cause will make it possible for us, if
necessary, to endure momentary failures without
losing heart.
Christopher Fry once said, "The Christian is
one who can afford to fail", by which I take it he
meant that since the Christian believes that
finally the cause of righteousness is in hands
more powerful than his own, he will not lose
heart if his own contribution to the final victory
of righteousness seems minimal or even at the
time self-defeating.
And it is interesting that this sense of a
providential overseeing of history is present in a
secularized version in Marx's insistence of the
inexorability of the dialectic, and indeed the
inevitability of the final victory of the proletariat
over the bourgeoisie. I would suggest that there is
really no cause that long endures in the hearts of
men without some sense on the part of those
inspired by it that the cause is somehow
ingrained in the very nature of things, and that
they are helping, rather than hindering, the
intended purpose of creation by their espousal of
it. So, a second ingredient for a time of trouble is
that you are entitled to believe that if your cause
is right it will prevail Semi-colon!
111
For immediately on the other side of the
semi-colon must go a third thing, if the second is

not to degenerate into a self-righteous fanaticism.
The third thing is this: you must constantly be
critical of your own position, and the way in
which you are expressing it.
There is a glory in the life of the one who
feels that what he is doing is an outworking of
God's will, or the dialectic of history, or the
meaning and purpose of creation. But there is a
demonry as well, best expressed for me in that
statement I have often quoted by that famous
seventeenth century writer, "Anon." Anon
wrote, "I had rather see coming toward me a
whole regiment with drawn swords, than one
lone Calvinist convinced that he is doing the will
of God."
An uncritical acceptance of one's own cause

as right leads one to any number of excesses in
its prosecution. This is true whether one's name
is Adolf Hitler or Joseph Stalin or Richard Nixon
or George Wallace or John Calvin or Pius XII or
whoever. The moment we turn our critical
faculties only on our opponents and not on
ourselves as well, we become very dangerous
human beings.
This insight has been captured for me most
unforgettably in the epigram of Reinhold

our truth, but we must also fight the falsehood in
our truth."

is to remind you of the way Dietrich Bonhoeffer
handled the problem when he was in prison
awaiting execution at the hands of the Gestapo
in Germany in World War 11. Bonhoeffer's answer
speaks both to Jews and to Christians.
He found himself returning again and again to
Jeremiah 45, the passage in which Baruch and
Jeremiah lament that things have gotten too
tough and they want out. Their plans seem to
have failed and the future looks absolutely bleak.
And God replies, that his plans have failed too.
He has had to see his plans at least temporarily
scrapped because of the evil of men, and to
realize that the present is a time of plucking up
rather than of planting. It grieves him too. And
the most he will promise Jeremiah and Baruch is
that he will preserve their lives as long as they are
needed to complete their part in his unfolding
plans.
That apparently sustained Baruch and
Jeremiah, and it sustained Dietrich Bonhoeffer
too, who went on to take that Jewish insight of
the presence of God in the very midst of the
reality of the world's suffering and pain, and see
it exemplified, in Christian terms now, by the
figure of the crucified Jesus, Jesus the revelation
of God as embodied in what Bonhoeffer
described as "the man for others."
And Bonhoeffer saw that as the pattern for
himself, sharing as he said, in the suffering of
God in a godless world, realizing that even in the
midst of his suffering, he was not left alone, but
that even there he was sustained and upheld by
God—and also sustained by the community of
friends to whom Bonhoeffer remained very close,
even though physically separated from them by
thick prison walls. We have that gift also in times
of trouble, and a very precious thing it is.
There is a deep mystery here, a mystery no
rational explanation has ever been able to fathom
and chart, that it can be a byproduct of suffering
that it strengthens and ennobles. That is never a
justification for the inflicting of suffering on
others, or for indifference in the face of the
suffering of others, but it is something we can
take with us into the presence of the suffering we
ourselves mav be called upon to endure.

I had originally planned to preach a sermon
appropriate to the beginning of a new year and
the start of a fresh academic quarter. However, in
the light of the tumultuous events on this
campus of the past few days, and the likely
possibility that things aren't exactly going to be
serene during the next few days, it has seemed to
me more appropriate to preach on the topic "On
Dealing With Times of Trouble."
During a decade cf appearances in this pulpit I
think I have established a reasonably good track
record for plugging the notion that religion and
politics do mix. Nevertheless, for a reason that I
trust is fairly obvious, I do not this morning
propose to deal with the political dimension of
our local troubles, but rather with some of the
personal responses we must all try to bring to
them.
The reason is that as a member of the
Advisory Board I am a signatory to a report
submitted to President Lyman on which he has
not yet acted. My own position, spelled out in
the various minority reports, is fairly clear, and it
would be singularly inappropriate for me to use
this pulpit to push a certain point of view while
the Report is still under consideration by the
President and Board of Trustees.
However, the report is, quite predictably,
stirring up a great deal of furor on this campus,
and is the immediate, though by no means the
only, cause for increasing tension and
polarization. So I want to speak to that latter
issue in terms that do not involve commentary
on the Advisory Board report itself but do
involve reflection upon how all of us can deal
most creatively with times of trouble. People
representing all sorts of perspectives are here this
morning, and I address you all, not just a selected
few.
I
Let me take my starting point from the Old
Testament lesson of the morning, one of those
enduring insights that time has often tried to
challenge and may have occasionally dimmed,
but has never destroyed. The Psalmist is engaged
in a rhapsody of praise to God and his creation.
And when he looks beyond the heavens and the
moon and stars, he thinks of the human beings in
creation, and asks of God,
What is man that thou art mindful of him,
and the son of man that thou dost care for
him?
Yet thou hast made him little less than God,
and dost crown him with glory and honor.
Thou hast given him dominion over the works
of thy hands;
thou hast put all things under his feet.
Now that's an extraordinarily positive
description of who we are. We might be nothing:
One could inflect the question almost
scornfully: In the midst of this vast creation, of
what significance is this infinitesimal speck, man?
But no, he is only a little less than God; he is
given glory and honor; he has been made a
partner with God in the ongoing work of

creation. A breathtaking prospect.
What do such words have to do with a time of
troubles? Just this. The description applies across
the board. It applies to every man. It is not just a
description of your political allies. It is also a
description of your political opponents. It is not
just a description of Jews, but also of Arabs. It
describes the Vietcong as well as the United
States Marine. The one who is "little less than
God" is the one who opposes military
recruitment on campus as well as the one who
supports it.
Now we may quite properly feel that some of
these people are better fulfilling their high calling
as ones who are made in God's image, than
others we can think of, but to those who stand in
the Judaeo-Christian tradition, that can only be

the second and never the first thing we affirm
about all the people who surround us. We have,
every single one of us, no matter how much we
may later feel divided, a common starting point:
we share a common humanity because we are all
those to whom "glory and honor" are given by
God.
And I suggest that in a time of troubles in
particular, this reduces to a very simple and basic
primary rule of attitude and conduct: it is wrong
to demean and depersonalize your opponents.
The ad hominem argument is the easiest but also
the cheapest and least convincing kind of
argument. When you demean the personhood of
your opponent you demean your own
personhood.
This is what happens in Vietnam when
Americans refer to Vietnamese as gooks or
slopeheads. It is what happens on this campus
when, from whatever political perspective, you
try to destroy the position of your opponent
merely by questioning his integrity or sincerity,
or casting aspersions on his motivations.
No—your opponent too is only a "little less than
God," he too is one whom God "crowns with
glory and honor."
Thus a list of people made " in the image of
God" includes the whole spectrum of inspired
and confused and frightened and creative
humanity—it includes Bruce Franklin and
Richard Lyman, Aaron Mangionello and Ray
White, Gerry Foote and Larry Diamond, Hal Kahn
and Paul Hanley, George McGovern and—if I may
make what is for me an exceedingly generous
gesture—Spiro T. Agnew.
II
In addition to refusing to depersonalize our

opponents, there is a second attitude we can
bring to a time of troubles, though I warn you in
advance that it can be separated from a third
attitude only by a semi-colon. The second
attitude is this: you are entitled to believe that if
your cause is right it will prevail. Put another
way, if what you believe in and are working for
really expands the cause of righteousness, of
justice, in the world, then you need not fear its
ultimate defeat.
If you aren't comfortable saying that your
cause "is of God" as Gamaliel did, then at least
you need to believe, I think, that your cause is
"of righteousness," or that it promotes justice, or
that it is inspired by love, or something of the
sort.
This kind of affirmation provides two
important ingredients: On the one hand, it makes
possible a sense of perspective. If you believe
that what you are supporting does, for example,
enhance justice for others, the unless your life is
to be riddled with inconsistency, you must try to
act justly in bringing your point of view home to
others.
If what you seek is the liberation of the
oppressed, then you must realize that oppressive
methods of achieving that do not liberate but
only further enslave.
If you want to save some lives you don't
massively destroy many other lives—a maxim Mr.
Nixon has been honoring in the breach rather
than the observance in his recent bombing of
North Vietnam. A belief in the Tightness of our
cause can give us perspective on the Tightness of
the ways we seek to promote that cause.
On the other hand, a belief in the tightness of
our cause will make it possible for us, if
necessary, to endure momentary failures without
losing heart.
Christopher Fry once said, "The Christian is
one who can afford to fail", by which I take it he
meant that since the Christian believes that
finally the cause of righteousness is in hands
more powerful than his own, he will not lose
heart if his own contribution to the final victory
of righteousness seems minimal or even at the
time self-defeating.
And it is interesting that this sense of a
providential overseeing of history is present in a
secularized version in Marx's insistence of the
inexorability of the dialectic, and indeed the
inevitability of the final victory of the proletariat
over the bourgeoisie. I would suggest that there is
really no cause that long endures in the hearts of
men without some sense on the part of those
inspired by it that the cause is somehow
ingrained in the very nature of things, and that
they are helping, rather than hindering, the
intended purpose of creation by their espousal of
it. So, a second ingredient for a time of trouble is
that you are entitled to believe that if your cause
is right it will prevail Semi-colon!
111
For immediately on the other side of the
semi-colon must go a third thing, if the second is

not to degenerate into a self-righteous fanaticism.
The third thing is this: you must constantly be
critical of your own position, and the way in
which you are expressing it.
There is a glory in the life of the one who
feels that what he is doing is an outworking of
God's will, or the dialectic of history, or the
meaning and purpose of creation. But there is a
demonry as well, best expressed for me in that
statement I have often quoted by that famous
seventeenth century writer, "Anon." Anon
wrote, "I had rather see coming toward me a
whole regiment with drawn swords, than one
lone Calvinist convinced that he is doing the will
of God."
An uncritical acceptance of one's own cause

as right leads one to any number of excesses in
its prosecution. This is true whether one's name
is Adolf Hitler or Joseph Stalin or Richard Nixon
or George Wallace or John Calvin or Pius XII or
whoever. The moment we turn our critical
faculties only on our opponents and not on
ourselves as well, we become very dangerous
human beings.
This insight has been captured for me most
unforgettably in the epigram of Reinhold
Niebuhr: "We must fight their falsehood with
our truth, but we must also fight the falsehood in
our truth."
IV
Now sermons are usually three points long
and I've made three points. But there is another,
a fourth, that is important, I believe, to any of us
as we face times of trouble. And the fourth thing
to remember is this: you must be willing, if
necessary, to suffer for what you believe in. Let
me make very clear that this is a last thing to say,
and never a first thing. To say this first would be
to suggest that our jot is to go out and seek
suffering, as though that were somehow a good
in itself. But as Alan Paton, who certainly ought
to know, has remarked out of his many times of
trouble in South Africa, one does not seek
suffering. That, ~ays Paton, is sick. But, he goes
on, whenever one takes a stand he must be
willing to endure suffering, if it comes.
When I refer to the need to be willing to
endure suffering for the sake of that in which
one believes, I am not simply talking about
getting beaten up, or worse, though that is a part,
in our fallen world, of what often happens to
people who take stands. I am also, and even more
emphatically, talking about the suffering that
comes from being misunderstood not only by

one's enemies but even n>orp .ihatteringly by
one's friends (perhaps the greatest suffering of
all); the suffering of loneliness, of being forsaken
when the chips are down by people one thought
would stand by; the suffering of self-doubt, and
the gnawing wonder about whether one has made
a small error or perhaps a huge and apparently
irretrievable blunder.
There is no route around such suffering that
bypasses it. The only route is through
it—accepting it when it comes, not being surprised
by its presence, and being willing to keep
affirming even so, in spite of the fact that all
sorts of things seem to make affirmation difficult
if not impossible.
How does one handle that kind of response to
a time of troubles, the response of finding
one self suffering? Here the best thing I can offer
is to remind you of the way Dietrich Bonhoeffer
handled the problem when he was in prison
awaiting execution at the hands of the Gestapo
in Germany in World War 11. Bonhoeffer's answer

And God replies, that his plans have failed too.
He has had to see his plans at least temporarily
scrapped because of the evil of men, and to
realize that the present is a time of plucking up
rather than of planting. It grieves him too. And
the most he will promise Jeremiah and Baruch is
that he will preserve their lives as long as they are
needed to complete their part in his unfolding
plans.
That apparently sustained Baruch and
Jeremiah, and it sustained Dietrich Bonhoeffer
too, who went on to take that Jewish insight of
the presence of God in the very midst of the
reality of the world's suffering and pain, and see
it exemplified, in Christian terms now, by the

even though physically separated from them by
