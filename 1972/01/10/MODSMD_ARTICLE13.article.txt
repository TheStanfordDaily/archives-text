# COSS Holds Hearings
## 
### 
The Committee on Student
Services' (COSS) open meetings
on the Placement Center have
been plagued by poor attendance
by its members and its witnesses.
The Committee was asked by
President Lyman to deliver
recommendations to him on the
referendum, taken last April,
banning the Armed Services and
all war industries from recruiting
on campus. Since then Lyman has
said that he will back open
recruitment.
COSS met last week and final
hearings are scheduled for
tomorrow, Wednesday and
Thursday at 7:30 p.m. in
Tresidder Room 271. Nine
witnesses were supposed to testify
last week but only six appeared.
COSS itself also had a significant
absentee rate both last Wednesday
and Thursday.
Most of the witnesses who did
appear favored the upholding of
the referendum. Most witnesses
also expressed the belief that any
loss of funds from the government
or war industries for the
university resulting from the
recruitment ban would have to be
weighed against the tremendous
damage being done to Indo-China
by those whom the recruiters
represent.
The COSS hearings inspired a
large paid advertisement which
was signed by 271 faculty

members and printed in last
Thursday's Daily. The, ad
supported a policy of open
recruiting. In response to an ad,
Political Science Professor Hubert
Marshall authored a two part
column which also appeared in
the Daily at the end of last week.
The column comprised Marshall's
testimony as the first witness
before COSS last Tuesday.
In supporting the results ot
April's referendum Marshall
equated the recruitment ban with
other University regulations (e.g.,
prohibition of disrupting
university functions) which
"prevent individuals from doing
harm to others." He thereby
discounted the ad's sponsors'
contention that "moral
inspection" as typified by the
recruitment prohibition is
unprecedented at Stanford.
Appearing with Marshall at
Tuesday's COSS meeting was
Associate Civil Engineering
Professor James Douglas. Douglas
in his brief testimony said that he
was "in favor of open recruitment
with very little restraint placed on
those who use the Placement
Center for these purposes."
Appearing at Wednesday's
session was ASSU Co-President
Lariy Diamond. Diamond quoted
extensively from Senator George
McGovern's statements on the

horrors of the Vietnam War.
Among the twelve witnesses >
scheduled to testify this week are I
Joseph Pettit, Dean of the School (
of Engineering and Dr. Ralph j
Keller, Director of the Placement i
Center. ,

The Committee on Student
Services' (COSS) open meetings
on the Placement Center have
been plagued by poor attendance
by its members and its witnesses.
The Committee was asked by
President Lyman to deliver
recommendations to him on the
referendum, taken last April,
banning the Armed Services and
all war industries from recruiting
on campus. Since then Lyman has
said that he will back open
recruitment.
COSS met last week and final
hearings are scheduled for
tomorrow, Wednesday and
Thursday at 7:30 p.m. in
Tresidder Room 271. Nine
witnesses were supposed to testify
last week but only six appeared.
COSS itself also had a significant
absentee rate both last Wednesday
and Thursday.
Most of the witnesses who did
appear favored the upholding of
the referendum. Most witnesses
also expressed the belief that any
loss of funds from the government
or war industries for the
university resulting from the
recruitment ban would have to be
weighed against the tremendous
damage being done to Indo-China
by those whom the recruiters
represent.
The COSS hearings inspired a
large paid advertisement which
was signed by 271 faculty

members and printed in last
Thursday's Daily. The, ad
supported a policy of open
recruiting. In response to an ad,
Political Science Professor Hubert
Marshall authored a two part
column which also appeared in
the Daily at the end of last week.
The column comprised Marshall's
testimony as the first witness
before COSS last Tuesday.
In supporting the results ot
April's referendum Marshall
equated the recruitment ban with
other University regulations (e.g.,
prohibition of disrupting
university functions) which
"prevent individuals from doing
harm to others." He thereby
discounted the ad's sponsors'
contention that "moral
inspection" as typified by the
recruitment prohibition is
unprecedented at Stanford.
