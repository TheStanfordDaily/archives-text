The Stanford Women's Center

women former prisoners will
speak.
Cora Lee Mack, Director of the
Stanford YWCA which funds the
Center, states, "The most
important function of the Center
is to provide a place for women to
get to know each other. We want
to provide an open and warm
atmosphere. We have alounge with
coffee in the Clubhouse where
women can come any time and
talk and participate in our
projects if they want to."
The Center will once again
offer courses. This quarter it is
also sponsoring Women's Health

Collective, and a contract
compliance suit against the
University.
This suit is being filed with the
Department of Health, Education,

federal funding of the University
be cut off because of sex
discrimination. Evidence is now
being collected to support the
charge.
Other activities which the

women's group, a graduate
women's bag lunch every Tuesday
