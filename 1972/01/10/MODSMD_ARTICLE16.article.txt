Stanford's basketball team opened up its 1972 Pacific-8 season with
a convincing 76-54 victory over theWashington State Cougars Friday
night at Maples Pavilion.
The Indians started off poorly and trailed throughout the first half.
The lead was cut to three at half-time when the Tribe's Claude Terry
grabbed a loose ball in his forecourt, dribbled behind his back and
then knifed through two Washington State defenders for a brilliant
twisting lay-up.
Stanford was hold to a mere seven field goals in the first half and
stayed close only because of their 15 free throws. On the other hand,
Washington State looked impressive as they moved the ball well and
hit close to 50% of their shots.
However, the second half was all Stanford. Sparked by scrappy
5'9" senior Gary Cain, the Indian defense constantly harassed the
Cougars into bad shots and turnovers. TheTribeoutscored Washington
State 47-22 in the final half, and they dominated the game as they
have rarely done in the past few years.
The Indians were led by Claude Terry who had 25 points and 7
rebounds. Dave Frost added 16, and Bob Buell, playing a great second
half, threw in 10 points.
The Cougars had only one man in double figures -- guard Dan
Steward with 15 points.
The Indians' fourth triumph in a row not only means a first place
tie in the Pac-8 standings, but also ups their season mark to 5-5. This
is truly unique for Stanford's cagers, as the attainment of a .500 mark
at this stage of the season last occured four years ago.
