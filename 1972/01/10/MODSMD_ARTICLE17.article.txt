## 
### 
At its annual meeting Saturday,
the NCAA ruled that beginning in
August, freshmen will be eligible
to compete in post-season and
championship events in football
and basketball.
This landmark decision has
been blunted by the
announcements of several
conferences that they would not
allow freshmen to compete in
regular season basketball and
football games. According to the

Associated Press, the Big Eight has
already declared that it will not
play freshmen and the Big Ten
and Pac-8 are unofficially opposed
to the new ruling.
Two years ago, the NCAA
voted to allow major colleges to
use freshmen in all sports except
football and basketball. Last year,
small colleges were given the
privilege of playing freshmen in
the two major fall and winter
sports.
