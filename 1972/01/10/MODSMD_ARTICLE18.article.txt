# Upset-Minded Hoopsters Win Streak At 5!
## 
### CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
Sophmore Mike Mann thoroughly dominated play Saturday night to
spark the Indians to an upset 85-80 overtime win over Washington.
The surprise victory kept Stanford in first place in the Pac-8 with a
perfect 2-0 record. Most Card basketball seasons of late have begun
with 0-2 marks, but the 1971-2 Cards have ridden a five game winning
streak into the second week of conference play.
Routine Win
Friday night, but the Tribe was not favored to beat the powerful
Huskies who had racked up an 8-2 pre-season record and defeated Cal
Friday night.
Mike Mann, however, snared 13 rebounds, scored 18 points, and
most importantly blocked 12 shots to stymie the Huskies. Ably
containing 6-10 Steve Hawes of Washinton, Mann prevented the
Huskier from driving to the basket. Forced to rely on outside
shooting, Washington could hit on only 42 percent of its shots,
compared to the Indians'sl percent.
The Huskies were ahead for most of the game, and pulled away to
seven points leads on two occasions. The Cards refused to fold,
however, and rallied once to trail y only two points at the half and
also came back to take the lead midway through the second half.
Stanford Lead
Bob Buell's lay-up with two minutes left in the game gave the
Indians a 73-71 lead, but Charles Dudley's lay-up knotted the score
and the Cards set up for the winning basket during a time out. A fan
started shouting, "We want Garcia", but to no avail as Mann missed a
desperation 38 foot shot at the buzzer to send the game into a five
minute overtime.
Steve Shupe hit two free throws in the first minute to send
Stanford into a lead that it would not relinquish for the remainder to
the sloppily played overtime period. Bob Nicholson and Dave Frost
each canned two free throws in the last seconds to push the Card's
winning advantage to 85-80, despite a tip-in by Hawes with seven
seconds remaining.
Claude Terry was the game's high scorer with 20, and most of his
points came on beautiful driving lay-ups. Frost hit for 18 and
Nicholson shot an amazing five for six from the floor to net 12 points.
Playing his finest game of the season, however, was Mann, who must
take much of the credit for the Indian's solid victory.

Mike Mann, however, snared 13 rebounds, scored 18 points, and
most importantly blocked 12 shots to stymie the Huskies. Ably
containing 6-10 Steve Hawes of Washinton, Mann prevented the
Huskier from driving to the basket. Forced to rely on outside
shooting, Washington could hit on only 42 percent of its shots,
compared to the Indians'sl percent.
The Huskies were ahead for most of the game, and pulled away to
seven points leads on two occasions. The Cards refused to fold,
however, and rallied once to trail y only two points at the half and
also came back to take the lead midway through the second half.
Stanford Lead
Bob Buell's lay-up with two minutes left in the game gave the
Indians a 73-71 lead, but Charles Dudley's lay-up knotted the score
and the Cards set up for the winning basket during a time out. A fan
started shouting, "We want Garcia", but to no avail as Mann missed a
desperation 38 foot shot at the buzzer to send the game into a five
minute overtime.
Steve Shupe hit two free throws in the first minute to send
Stanford into a lead that it would not relinquish for the remainder to
the sloppily played overtime period. Bob Nicholson and Dave Frost
each canned two free throws in the last seconds to push the Card's
winning advantage to 85-80, despite a tip-in by Hawes with seven
seconds remaining.
Claude Terry was the game's high scorer with 20, and most of his
points came on beautiful driving lay-ups. Frost hit for 18 and
Nicholson shot an amazing five for six from the floor to net 12 points.
Playing his finest game of the season, however, was Mann, who must
take much of the credit for the Indian's solid victory.

WHERE DID THEY ClO?—There are no Washington defenders in sight
as Captain Claude Terry drives in unmolested for a lay-up in the
Indians' 85-80 overtime win against the Huskies Saturday night. Terry
was the game's high scorer with 20 points.
Sophmore Mike Mann thoroughly dominated play Saturday night to
spark the Indians to an upset 85-80 overtime win over Washington.
The surprise victory kept Stanford in first place in the Pac-8 with a
perfect 2-0 record. Most Card basketball seasons of late have begun
with 0-2 marks, but the 1971-2 Cards have ridden a five game winning
streak into the second week of conference play.
Routine Win
Friday night, but the Tribe was not favored to beat the powerful
Huskies who had racked up an 8-2 pre-season record and defeated Cal
Friday night.
