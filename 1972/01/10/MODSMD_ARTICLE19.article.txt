# Swimmers Sweep Invitational Relay
## 
### DOUG WILSON 
Stanford's varisty swimmers, in
the first important meet of the
1971 season, won their own
Invitational Friday afternoon,
playing rude host to their five
aquatic guests and winning four
of the eleven relay events held at
Encina pool.
In the process, Stanford
Olympian Brian Job served notice
that he had emerged from his
brief "slump" of the past summer
by setting a new pool record of
59.9 in the 100-yd. breaststroke.
Stanford, with 77 points,
defeated Santa Clara Aquatic Club
(66), UC Berkeley (59), and
Arden Hills (25), Foothill Aquatic
Club (20), to repeat its win of last
season without such stars as John
Ferris and Fred Haywood, who
have graduated. Nevertheless,
swimming fans were treated to an
early-season record by Job in the
100-yd. breaststroke relay. The
Stanford junior's new pool record
is two seconds off his NCAA
standard set last year.
Shilling Stars
Also cracking the one-minute
mark in the 100-yd. breaststroke
was teammate Dave Shilling, the
senior captain of this year's
varsity team. Shilling's 59.9
clocking came in the anchor leg of
the 300-yd. breaststroke relay,
won by the Stanford team of Job,
Shilling and freshman Kevin
Lemley in a time of 3:05.5,
beating a runner-up Berkeley
squad by 8 seconds.
Other Stanford victories came
in the opening 200-yd. freestyle
relay; the 200-yd. medley relay;
and the 300-yd. backstroke relay.
The Stanford sprint team of
Martin Pedley, Bob "Hvae"

Wilson, Martin Clevenger, and Ken
Hammer churned to a 1:28.5
clocking to beat Cal's 200
freestyle quartet by four-tenths
of a second.
Meet Highlight
Steve Carey, whose
performance was described by
Stanford coach Jim Gaughran as
"one of the highlights of the
meet" turned in a :21.4 for the
anchor freestyle leg of the 200
medley relay to lead the Indians
to a two-tenth second victory over
Santa Clara. Carey was joined by
Job, butterflier Rick Longinotti
and freshman backstroke ace
Randy Whitchurch in the 1:37.5
effort.
Whitchurch, from Evanston,
111., and frosh teammate Jack
Deppe of Bloomington, Ind.,
indicated a strong potential to
replace Stanford's former
backstroking champion Fred
Haywood by joining with a third
freshman, Dean Anderson of
North Highlands, Calif., to win
the 300-yd. backstroke relay in a
time of 2:47.5.
Stanford's 800-vd. freestyle
relay team, the 300-vd. butterfly
relay, the 400-yd. freestyle and
medley relays, and the 1- and 3-
meter tandem diving teams each
placed second in their respective
events.
Outstanding Swimmers
Gaughran singled out Carey,
Job, Shilling and Longinotti (who
turned in a 52.4 performance in
the butterfly leg of the 400

medley relay) as the outstanding
performers of the meet, and
expressed his satisfaction with the
progress of his admittedly young
and inexperienced squad to date.
"The meet went as hoped," he
said; "I thought we might have
gone harder in the 800 relay, but
we have been putting in a

tremendous amount of distance
work in practice. In general, I'm
very happy with where we are
right now."
Stanford hosts Oregon State
University this Friday, and meets
the University of Oregon on
Saturday. Both meets begin at 2
p.m. at Encina pool.

JOB OF OLD—Brian Job showed that he has recovered from a
summer slump by turning in a Stanford pool record of 59 .9 in the 100
yard breaststroke. His time is two seconds off his performance in last
year's NCAA Championships, but Job's 59.9 indicates that he is in
fine early season shape.
Stanford's varisty swimmers, in
the first important meet of the
1971 season, won their own
Invitational Friday afternoon,
playing rude host to their five
aquatic guests and winning four
of the eleven relay events held at
Encina pool.
In the process, Stanford
Olympian Brian Job served notice
that he had emerged from his
brief "slump" of the past summer
by setting a new pool record of
59.9 in the 100-yd. breaststroke.
Stanford, with 77 points,
defeated Santa Clara Aquatic Club
(66), UC Berkeley (59), and
Arden Hills (25), Foothill Aquatic
Club (20), to repeat its win of last
season without such stars as John
Ferris and Fred Haywood, who
have graduated. Nevertheless,
swimming fans were treated to an
early-season record by Job in the
100-yd. breaststroke relay. The
Stanford junior's new pool record
is two seconds off his NCAA
standard set last year.
Shilling Stars
Also cracking the one-minute
mark in the 100-yd. breaststroke
was teammate Dave Shilling, the
senior captain of this year's
varsity team. Shilling's 59.9
clocking came in the anchor leg of
the 300-yd. breaststroke relay,
won by the Stanford team of Job,
Shilling and freshman Kevin
Lemley in a time of 3:05.5,
beating a runner-up Berkeley
squad by 8 seconds.
Other Stanford victories came
in the opening 200-yd. freestyle
relay; the 200-yd. medley relay;
and the 300-yd. backstroke relay.
The Stanford sprint team of
Martin Pedley, Bob "Hvae"

Wilson, Martin Clevenger, and Ken
Hammer churned to a 1:28.5
clocking to beat Cal's 200
freestyle quartet by four-tenths
of a second.
Meet Highlight
Steve Carey, whose
performance was described by
Stanford coach Jim Gaughran as
"one of the highlights of the
meet" turned in a :21.4 for the
anchor freestyle leg of the 200
medley relay to lead the Indians
to a two-tenth second victory over
Santa Clara. Carey was joined by
Job, butterflier Rick Longinotti
and freshman backstroke ace
Randy Whitchurch in the 1:37.5
effort.
Whitchurch, from Evanston,
111., and frosh teammate Jack
Deppe of Bloomington, Ind.,
indicated a strong potential to
replace Stanford's former
backstroking champion Fred
Haywood by joining with a third
freshman, Dean Anderson of
North Highlands, Calif., to win
the 300-yd. backstroke relay in a
time of 2:47.5.
Stanford's 800-vd. freestyle
relay team, the 300-vd. butterfly
relay, the 400-yd. freestyle and
medley relays, and the 1- and 3-
meter tandem diving teams each
placed second in their respective
events.
Outstanding Swimmers
Gaughran singled out Carey,
Job, Shilling and Longinotti (who
turned in a 52.4 performance in
the butterfly leg of the 400

medley relay) as the outstanding
performers of the meet, and
expressed his satisfaction with the
progress of his admittedly young
and inexperienced squad to date.
"The meet went as hoped," he
said; "I thought we might have
gone harder in the 800 relay, but
we have been putting in a

tremendous amount of distance
work in practice. In general, I'm
very happy with where we are
right now."
Stanford hosts Oregon State
University this Friday, and meets
the University of Oregon on
Saturday. Both meets begin at 2
p.m. at Encina pool.

"The meet went as hoped," he
said; "I thought we might have
gone harder in the 800 relay, but
we have been putting in a

tremendous amount of distance
work in practice. In general, I'm
very happy with where we are
right now."
Stanford hosts Oregon State
University this Friday, and meets
the University of Oregon on
Saturday. Both meets begin at 2
p.m. at Encina pool.

LAST LEG—Junior Tim Broderick, Stanford's top middle distance
freestyler, churns home on the last leg of the Indians' 800 yard
freestyle relay effort in the Invitational last Satirday. Broderick was a
finalist in the 1971 NCAA 200 yard freestyle championships.

JOB OF OLD—Brian Job showed that he has recovered from a
summer slump by turning in a Stanford pool record of 59 .9 in the 100
yard breaststroke. His time is two seconds off his performance in last
year's NCAA Championships, but Job's 59.9 indicates that he is in
fine early season shape.
