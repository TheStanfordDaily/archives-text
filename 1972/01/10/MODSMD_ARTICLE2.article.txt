# DoD Protest Planned
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
A march beginning at Memorial
Church at noon today will culminate
when its participants attempt to
prevent the Department of Defense
from recruiting systems analysts at the
Graduate School of Business (GSB).
Scheduled to speak at GSB are former
Rand Corporation analyst Anthony G.
Russo; his wife Katherine Barkley, a
Stanford grad student; and Jeannie
Friedman, of the Coral Sea Movement.
T*..iiorrow a noon rally is scheduled
for White Plaza to protest President
Lyman's decision yesterday to fire
suspended English Professor Bruce
Franklin. Those sponsoring the rally
have threatened to "seize a building
with the understanding that it will be
defended" unless Lvman rehires
Franklin.
Lee Peterson, placement assistant at
the business school, confirmed that
the DOD recruiters were coming to the
school today. She said that although
the recruiters schedules were not full,
a number of people had scheduled
interviews.
They will probably be at the school
from about 9 a.m. until 5 p.m.
Although she had not talked to the
DOD representatives, Ms. Paterson said
she "assumed" they know that they
might encounter some type of protest
here.
Plans for these actions were
formulated when 200 people occupied
Memorial Church at about 10:30 p.m.
Friday night, immediately after the
speeches of Daniel Ellsberg, Anthony
Russo and Katherine Barkley.
Friday Meeting
The weekend's protest activities
began Friday afternoon with a 1:00
p.m. meeting at Dinkelspiel
Auditorium. The protesters had
planned to confront the Academic
Council during a meeting scheduled
for that time, but because of President
Lyman's absence due to illness, the
Council's meeting was postponed.
During the protesters' meeting
tactics were discussed on how to deal
with the advisory board's
recommendation that Franklin be
fired.
In a possibly related incident, an
attempted fire bombing caused about
$'25 damage to the Stanford golf

driving range office late F>iday night.
A large peanut butter jar fused with a
rag and apparently containing gasoline
soarched a four foot square area on
the building. A handwritten note
found nearby said "These are ashes of
things. Please no more ashes of
children."
Further tactics were discussed
during the two hour occupation of
Mem Chu Friday night. A widely
expressed feeling was that if the police
attempted to clear the demonstrators
out of the building they choose to
seize Tuesday, the demonstrators will
resist. Venceremos member Jim Shoch
said that "when the pigs come to get
us out, we have to make it clear that
we'll raise our level of struggle."
Shoch continued that "we expect a
Cambodian-type trashing if this
peaceful sit-in is broken up." Lenny
Siegel of the Pacific Studies Center
concurred, saying "we're willing to
defend ourselves and Lyman's going to
have to recognize that."
Actions more drastic than a sit-in
were also discussed. It was proposed
that protest be expanded enough "to
shut this University down."
Newsmen Assaulted
Early in the meeting, Stanford News
and Publications Director Robert
Beyers was ejected from the Church.
Beyers was noticed by a speaker at the
podium who referred to him as a "pig"
for his testimony against Franklin.
Beyers was then pushed and fell
part way to the ground. Without
resisting he was guided by about six of
the demonstrators toward the door.
He asked "Am I being forced to
leave?" and he was told several times
that he was.
Immediately after Beyers was
forced out, KZSU reporter Pete
Williams was briefly assaulted and his
tape recorder was token away. After
listening to a few seconds of the
recording the demonstrators returned
it to him.
Midnight March
The rally at Mem Chu ended at
about midnight when the
demonstrators marched to Lyman's
office to deliver their demands.
Waiting for them at the office were
Stanford Police Director Marvin
Herrington and three of his officers.

Two other Stanford police guarded the
back of Lyman's office.
On their arrival at the office, two of
the demonstrators produced a sledge
hammer, a spike and a sign reading
"Rehire Franklin Tuesday Noon."
With no interference from the police,
the demonstrators hammered their
ultimatum into the office door. Jim
Shoch said that he felt that Lyman
and the rest of the administration were
"constipated robber barons." The
demonstrators remained outside
Lyman's office briefly, chanting
rhythmically, and then dispersed.
Saturday was reserved primarily for
planning and preparation for this
week's events. Yesterday afternoon at
3:00 p.m. approximately 150 people
returned to Mem Chu to rename it the
"Bruce Franklin People's Memorial
Church."

out of the building they choose to
seize Tuesday, the demonstrators will
resist. Venceremos member Jim Shoch
said that "when the pigs come to get
us out, we have to make it clear that
we'll raise our level of struggle."
Shoch continued that "we expect a
Cambodian-type trashing if this
peaceful sit-in is broken up." Lenny
Siegel of the Pacific Studies Center
concurred, saying "we're willing to
defend ourselves and Lyman's going to
have to recognize that."
Actions more drastic than a sit-in
were also discussed. It was proposed
that protest be expanded enough "to
shut this University down."
Newsmen Assaulted
Early in the meeting, Stanford News
and Publications Director Robert
Beyers was ejected from the Church.
Beyers was noticed by a speaker at the
podium who referred to him as a "pig"
for his testimony against Franklin.
Beyers was then pushed and fell
part way to the ground. Without
resisting he was guided by about six of
the demonstrators toward the door.
He asked "Am I being forced to
leave?" and he was told several times
that he was.
Immediately after Beyers was
forced out, KZSU reporter Pete
Williams was briefly assaulted and his
tape recorder was token away. After
listening to a few seconds of the
recording the demonstrators returned
it to him.
Midnight March
The rally at Mem Chu ended at
about midnight when the
demonstrators marched to Lyman's
office to deliver their demands.
Waiting for them at the office were
Stanford Police Director Marvin
Herrington and three of his officers.

Two other Stanford police guarded the
back of Lyman's office.
On their arrival at the office, two of
the demonstrators produced a sledge
hammer, a spike and a sign reading
"Rehire Franklin Tuesday Noon."
With no interference from the police,
the demonstrators hammered their
ultimatum into the office door. Jim
Shoch said that he felt that Lyman
and the rest of the administration were
"constipated robber barons." The
demonstrators remained outside
Lyman's office briefly, chanting
rhythmically, and then dispersed.
Saturday was reserved primarily for
planning and preparation for this
week's events. Yesterday afternoon at
3:00 p.m. approximately 150 people
returned to Mem Chu to rename it the
"Bruce Franklin People's Memorial
Church."

HIGH NOON—This ultimatum to rehire English Professor Bruce Franklin by noon tomorrow was nailed into President
Lyman's office door late Friday by demonstrators after a two hour occupation of Mem Chu.
A march beginning at Memorial
Church at noon today will culminate
when its participants attempt to
prevent the Department of Defense
from recruiting systems analysts at the
Graduate School of Business (GSB).
Scheduled to speak at GSB are former
Rand Corporation analyst Anthony G.
Russo; his wife Katherine Barkley, a
Stanford grad student; and Jeannie
Friedman, of the Coral Sea Movement.
T*..iiorrow a noon rally is scheduled
for White Plaza to protest President
Lyman's decision yesterday to fire
suspended English Professor Bruce
Franklin. Those sponsoring the rally
have threatened to "seize a building
with the understanding that it will be
defended" unless Lvman rehires
Franklin.
Lee Peterson, placement assistant at
the business school, confirmed that
the DOD recruiters were coming to the
school today. She said that although
the recruiters schedules were not full,
a number of people had scheduled
interviews.
They will probably be at the school
from about 9 a.m. until 5 p.m.
Although she had not talked to the
DOD representatives, Ms. Paterson said
she "assumed" they know that they
might encounter some type of protest
here.
Plans for these actions were
formulated when 200 people occupied
Memorial Church at about 10:30 p.m.
Friday night, immediately after the
speeches of Daniel Ellsberg, Anthony
Russo and Katherine Barkley.
Friday Meeting
The weekend's protest activities
began Friday afternoon with a 1:00
p.m. meeting at Dinkelspiel
Auditorium. The protesters had
planned to confront the Academic
Council during a meeting scheduled
for that time, but because of President
Lyman's absence due to illness, the
Council's meeting was postponed.
During the protesters' meeting
tactics were discussed on how to deal
with the advisory board's
recommendation that Franklin be
fired.
In a possibly related incident, an
attempted fire bombing caused about
$'25 damage to the Stanford golf

driving range office late F>iday night.
A large peanut butter jar fused with a
rag and apparently containing gasoline
soarched a four foot square area on
the building. A handwritten note
found nearby said "These are ashes of
things. Please no more ashes of
children."
Further tactics were discussed
during the two hour occupation of
Mem Chu Friday night. A widely
expressed feeling was that if the police
attempted to clear the demonstrators
out of the building they choose to
seize Tuesday, the demonstrators will
resist. Venceremos member Jim Shoch
said that "when the pigs come to get
us out, we have to make it clear that

HIGH NOON—This ultimatum to rehire English Professor Bruce Franklin by noon tomorrow was nailed into President
Lyman's office door late Friday by demonstrators after a two hour occupation of Mem Chu.
A march beginning at Memorial
Church at noon today will culminate
when its participants attempt to
prevent the Department of Defense
from recruiting systems analysts at the
Graduate School of Business (GSB).
Scheduled to speak at GSB are former
Rand Corporation analyst Anthony G.
Russo; his wife Katherine Barkley, a
Stanford grad student; and Jeannie
Friedman, of the Coral Sea Movement.
T*..iiorrow a noon rally is scheduled
for White Plaza to protest President
Lyman's decision yesterday to fire
suspended English Professor Bruce
Franklin. Those sponsoring the rally
have threatened to "seize a building
with the understanding that it will be
defended" unless Lvman rehires
Franklin.
Lee Peterson, placement assistant at
the business school, confirmed that
the DOD recruiters were coming to the
school today. She said that although
the recruiters schedules were not full,
a number of people had scheduled
interviews.
They will probably be at the school
from about 9 a.m. until 5 p.m.
Although she had not talked to the
DOD representatives, Ms. Paterson said
she "assumed" they know that they
might encounter some type of protest
here.
Plans for these actions were
formulated when 200 people occupied
Memorial Church at about 10:30 p.m.
Friday night, immediately after the
speeches of Daniel Ellsberg, Anthony
Russo and Katherine Barkley.
Friday Meeting
The weekend's protest activities
began Friday afternoon with a 1:00
p.m. meeting at Dinkelspiel
Auditorium. The protesters had
planned to confront the Academic
Council during a meeting scheduled
for that time, but because of President
Lyman's absence due to illness, the
Council's meeting was postponed.
During the protesters' meeting
tactics were discussed on how to deal
with the advisory board's
recommendation that Franklin be
fired.
In a possibly related incident, an
attempted fire bombing caused about
$'25 damage to the Stanford golf

driving range office late F>iday night.
A large peanut butter jar fused with a
rag and apparently containing gasoline
soarched a four foot square area on
the building. A handwritten note
found nearby said "These are ashes of
things. Please no more ashes of
children."
Further tactics were discussed
during the two hour occupation of
Mem Chu Friday night. A widely
expressed feeling was that if the police
attempted to clear the demonstrators
out of the building they choose to
seize Tuesday, the demonstrators will
resist. Venceremos member Jim Shoch
said that "when the pigs come to get
us out, we have to make it clear that
we'll raise our level of struggle."
Shoch continued that "we expect a
Cambodian-type trashing if this
peaceful sit-in is broken up." Lenny
Siegel of the Pacific Studies Center
concurred, saying "we're willing to
defend ourselves and Lyman's going to
have to recognize that."
Actions more drastic than a sit-in
were also discussed. It was proposed
that protest be expanded enough "to
shut this University down."
Newsmen Assaulted
Early in the meeting, Stanford News
and Publications Director Robert
Beyers was ejected from the Church.
Beyers was noticed by a speaker at the
podium who referred to him as a "pig"
for his testimony against Franklin.
Beyers was then pushed and fell
part way to the ground. Without
resisting he was guided by about six of
the demonstrators toward the door.
He asked "Am I being forced to
leave?" and he was told several times
that he was.
Immediately after Beyers was
forced out, KZSU reporter Pete
Williams was briefly assaulted and his
tape recorder was token away. After
listening to a few seconds of the
recording the demonstrators returned
it to him.
Midnight March
The rally at Mem Chu ended at
about midnight when the
demonstrators marched to Lyman's
office to deliver their demands.
Waiting for them at the office were
Stanford Police Director Marvin
Herrington and three of his officers.

Two other Stanford police guarded the
back of Lyman's office.
On their arrival at the office, two of
the demonstrators produced a sledge
hammer, a spike and a sign reading
"Rehire Franklin Tuesday Noon."
With no interference from the police,
the demonstrators hammered their
ultimatum into the office door. Jim
Shoch said that he felt that Lyman
and the rest of the administration were
"constipated robber barons." The
demonstrators remained outside
Lyman's office briefly, chanting
rhythmically, and then dispersed.
Saturday was reserved primarily for
planning and preparation for this
week's events. Yesterday afternoon at
3:00 p.m. approximately 150 people
returned to Mem Chu to rename it the
"Bruce Franklin People's Memorial
Church."
