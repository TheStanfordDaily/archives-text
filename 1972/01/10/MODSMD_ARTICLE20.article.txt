# Second Half Surge Sinks Cougars Mann Stars In OT Win Over Huskies Kelley, Gilberg Spark Frosh Wins
## 
### MARC SULLIVAN 
The Stanford Frosh basketball team kept its personal five-game
winning streak alive last weekend, racing past the freshmen of San
Jose State and UC Davis. The Indians were not threatened seriously in
either game as they stepped over San Jose 95-69 Friday night and
buried Davis by a 99-59 count.
The Cards came on like UCLA, running, fast-breaking and
harrassing their opponents to distraction. In the Davis game the
Tribe's full court press accounted for fifteen turnovers which were
converted into nine Stanford buckets. Even in the defensive end of the
court, the Indians pressed and gambled, stealing the ball eleven times
(by unofficial count) and forcing numerous errors. Guards Mike
Simons and Mark Gilberg were particularly effective defensively.
Kelley Intimidates
The intimidating presence of seven foot Rich Kelley was also a
significant factor (to put it mildly) in both contests. In Saturday
night's game he blocked six shots in something under thirty minutes
of playing time while collecting seventeen rebounds.
As the scores attest, the Indian offense was hardly impotent, either.
Again Kelley and Gilberg led the charge. Against San Jose Kelley
netted eighteen points and Gilberg fifteen. The following night against
Davis, Gilberg had the best night of his still-young Stanford career,
putting in twenty while Kelley added fifteen.
They were by no means the only stars. Friday night reserve forward
Archie Dean came off the bench to hit seventeen and the next night
starting forward Melvin Arterberry got fifteen.
Running Game
The running game accounted for a lot of those points. More than in
the past, Kelley appeared to be looking for the quick outlet pass as he
came down with rebounds. As often as not he found a man and the
results were numbers of easy Tribe scores, particularly by Gilberg and
Arterberry.
Other encouraging notes were fouling and foul shooting. There was
little of the former and a lot of the latter. Against Davis the whole
Stanford team committed only fourteen fouls with no individual
having more than two. When shooting fouls, the Tribe was deadly,
hitting for 68 percent Friday and 80 percent Saturday.
