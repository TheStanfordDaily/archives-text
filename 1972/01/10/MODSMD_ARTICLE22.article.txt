# Russo, Barkley Wed
## Activists Exchange Vows 
### LARRY LIEBERT Daily Society Editor 
"There are pigs at my wedding and
everything," a disappointed Katherine
Barkley sighed.
Two Santa Clara Sheriff's Deputies
had pushed into a crowded room in
Memorial Church to warn of an
assassination threat against the best
man— Daniel Ellsberg, the former
government advisor who leaked the
"Pentagon Papers."
While more than 2,000 spectators
waited in the church for Ellsberg's
scheduled speech Friday night, a small
crowd in the adjoining Round Room
was watching the wedding of
Stanford's radical activist-author
Katherine Barkley and Anthony G.
Russo, Ellsberg's co-defendent in a
pending "Pentagon Papers" trial.
Russo and Barkley were to join
Ellsberg in the chapel for an anti-war
forum. Their backstage marriage was a
surprise for the audience. But the
assassination threat was an additional
surprise for everyone involved.
Stanford switchboard operator Jean
Lowe received an anonymous cali at
7:35 p.m. from a "young, calm" male,
who warned, "Daniel Ellsberg will be
assassinated tonight. Please pass the
word so that innocent people won't
get hurt."
Ellsberg apparently learned of the
threat at 8:15 p.m., when he arrived at
the Round Room. He talked with two
sheriff's deputies, who at first were

stalled at the door by people who did
not trust their insistent request to
speak with Ellsberg personally.
Goes Ahead With Speech
With newsmen pressing forward,
Ellsberg and friends talked with the
police, eventually rejecting their
recommendation that he cancel the
speech before a filled hall which could
not easily be searched.
Ellsberg described the threat as
"psychological warfare directed at my
wife-at me." He said he would talk
"briefly" to the audience before
rushing away to be w.\h his worried
wife.
The threat was the first he had
received, Ellsberg said glumly, adding,
"I'm going to have to go through a lot
more of this."
Once the decision to continue was
made, Stanford's Marxist minister
Joseph Hardegree performed a brief
and /ery political wedding. Ellsberg,
Barkley, and Russo (who wore a tux
jacket with tails and blue jeans) all
embraced and whispered to one
another. Hardegree ended the brief
ceremony, saying, "May your marriage
become a liberated one of the new
world."
Later Barkley commented that
she met Russo under political
circumstances, when they were both
attending Bruce Franklin's dismissal
hearing a month ago.
Political Reasons
They married for political reasons.

Barkley explained that she and Russo
have been living together for two
weeks and became legally married only
"because a wife can't be forced to
testify against her husband.
"Tony has been harassed and beaten
up a lot," she said. "We don't want
them using the grand jury against me
too."
As Ellsberg prepared to enter the
chapel, several onlookers reminded
him, "Try to mention Bruce
Franklin." Barkley and Russo had
interested the less radical Ellsberg in
Franklin's current problems but some
of their friends were afraid Ellsberg's
cautious advisors would talk him out of
involvement in a local dispute.
At 8:52, Ellsberg, Barkley and
Russo appeared before the enthusiastic
crowd. Ellsberg told the audience,
'The message that we've been waiting
to hear for six months or so has come
to campus police, and that was that
someone proposed to assassinate me
tonight in this auditorium."
"Revolutionary Couple"
He criticized Bruce Franklin's
dismissal in stronger terms than
anyone had expected. He read a letter
which George Jackson wrote to
Angela Davis as his tribute to Barkley,
and he congratulated the
"revolutionary couple."
And in spite of his insistence that he
needed to hurry home, Ellsberg spoke
for about thirty minutes before leaving
to a standing ovation.

Stanford's radical activist-author
Katherine Barkley and Anthony G.
Russo, Ellsberg's co-defendent in a
pending "Pentagon Papers" trial.
Russo and Barkley were to join
Ellsberg in the chapel for an anti-war
forum. Their backstage marriage was a
surprise for the audience. But the
assassination threat was an additional
surprise for everyone involved.
Stanford switchboard operator Jean
Lowe received an anonymous cali at
7:35 p.m. from a "young, calm" male,
who warned, "Daniel Ellsberg will be
assassinated tonight. Please pass the
word so that innocent people won't
get hurt."
Ellsberg apparently learned of the
threat at 8:15 p.m., when he arrived at
the Round Room. He talked with two
sheriff's deputies, who at first were

stalled at the door by people who did
not trust their insistent request to
speak with Ellsberg personally.
Goes Ahead With Speech
With newsmen pressing forward,
Ellsberg and friends talked with the
police, eventually rejecting their
recommendation that he cancel the
speech before a filled hall which could
not easily be searched.
Ellsberg described the threat as
"psychological warfare directed at my
wife-at me." He said he would talk
"briefly" to the audience before
rushing away to be w.\h his worried
wife.
The threat was the first he had
received, Ellsberg said glumly, adding,
"I'm going to have to go through a lot
more of this."
Once the decision to continue was
made, Stanford's Marxist minister
Joseph Hardegree performed a brief
and /ery political wedding. Ellsberg,
Barkley, and Russo (who wore a tux
jacket with tails and blue jeans) all
embraced and whispered to one
another. Hardegree ended the brief
ceremony, saying, "May your marriage
become a liberated one of the new
world."
Later Barkley commented that
she met Russo under political
circumstances, when they were both
attending Bruce Franklin's dismissal
hearing a month ago.
Political Reasons
They married for political reasons.

Barkley explained that she and Russo
have been living together for two
weeks and became legally married only
"because a wife can't be forced to
testify against her husband.
"Tony has been harassed and beaten
up a lot," she said. "We don't want
them using the grand jury against me
too."
As Ellsberg prepared to enter the
chapel, several onlookers reminded
him, "Try to mention Bruce
Franklin." Barkley and Russo had
interested the less radical Ellsberg in
Franklin's current problems but some
of their friends were afraid Ellsberg's
cautious advisors would talk him out of
involvement in a local dispute.
At 8:52, Ellsberg, Barkley and
Russo appeared before the enthusiastic
crowd. Ellsberg told the audience,
'The message that we've been waiting
to hear for six months or so has come
to campus police, and that was that
someone proposed to assassinate me
tonight in this auditorium."
"Revolutionary Couple"
He criticized Bruce Franklin's
dismissal in stronger terms than
anyone had expected. He read a letter
which George Jackson wrote to
Angela Davis as his tribute to Barkley,
and he congratulated the
"revolutionary couple."
And in spite of his insistence that he
needed to hurry home, Ellsberg spoke
for about thirty minutes before leaving
to a standing ovation.
"There are pigs at my wedding and
everything," a disappointed Katherine
Barkley sighed.
Two Santa Clara Sheriff's Deputies
had pushed into a crowded room in
Memorial Church to warn of an
assassination threat against the best
man— Daniel Ellsberg, the former
government advisor who leaked the
"Pentagon Papers."
While more than 2,000 spectators
waited in the church for Ellsberg's
scheduled speech Friday night, a small
crowd in the adjoining Round Room
was watching the wedding of
