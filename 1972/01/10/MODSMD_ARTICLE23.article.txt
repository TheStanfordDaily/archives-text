Bengal Chief Returns Home
NEW DELHI — Sheik Mujibur Rahman landed here this
morning for a triumphal stopover on his way home to a
hero's welcome in Bangladesh, the new nation that calls
him its father.
A British Royal Air Force jetliner carrying the sheik
flew to New Delhi from London. Prime Minister Indira
Gandhi, President V.V. Giri and members of the Indian
Cabinet were on hand to greet him.
Mujib flew to the British capital Saturday after nine
months of detention in West Pakistan.
Mujib, leader of the independence movement in his
country, is recognized by India as the first president of
Bangladesh, the nation born last Dec. 16 when Pakistani
forces in what was then East Pakistan surrendered at the
end of the two-week India-Pakistan war.
After a four-hour stopover in New Delhi, he was
scheduled to fly on to Dacca, the city he left last March
26 when he was arrested by Pakistani authorities on
treason charges.
The sheik thanked Mrs. Gandhi for India's help in
Bangladesh's December war of independence.
McCloskey: 15% Or Out
WASHINGTON — Rep. Paul N. McCloskey (R-Portola
Valley) said yesterday he'll drop out of the presidential
campaign if he fails to get more than 15 to 20 per cent of
the vote in the New Hampshire Republican primary March
7.
"If we do poorly—ls to 20 per cent—it would be clear
that I don't measure up as a presidential candidate . .. and
I'd have to drop out," McCloskey said.
The California congressman has challenged President
Nixon for the party's 1972 nomination because he
opposes Nixon's handling of the Vietnam war and because
he says the administration has deceived the people.
Nixon's other Republican challenger in the New
Hampshire primary, conservative Rep. John M. Ashbrook
of Ohio, said he'll run in several other primaries, including
Florida, "regardless of what I do in New Hampshire."
Klein Blasts Press
WASHINGTON — President Nixon's communications
director, Herbert G. Klein, yesterday accused some news

reporters of libeling Presidential aide Henry Kissinger in
accounts of Kissinger's role in strategy sessions on the
India-Pakistan war. He did not name the publications.
Klein was asked to comment on columnist Jack
Anderson's disclosure of secret papers said to be minutes
of White House strategy sessions on the India-Pakistan
conflict.
The papers quoted Kissinger, the President's national
security adviser, as saying at one point that Nixon wanted
a "tilt in favor of Pakistan." At the same time the
administration was denying that it was anti-India.
Klein said those who conclude that Kissinger "was
lying or distorting the facts" are mistaken.
Ocean Liner Capsizes
HONG KONG — The once-great passenger liner Queen
Elizabeth, gutted by flames, capsized just before noon
today. "She rolled over and died," a harbor official said.
No one was killed in the fire of unknown origin which
broke out yesterday. The ship was being refitted for use as
a floating campus of Chapman College, of Orange,
California.

Assistant German Professor Juan Flores, a member of
Venceremos, and Faculty Political Action Committee
member Hal Kahn held a press conference to react to
Lyman's decision to fire Franklin. Flores said that they
would use the Church "as a base of operations for the
gradual—or quick—rehabilitation of Stanford." Flores
went on to say that "Stanford's present elite government
is doomed to fall."
Plans were announced at the press conference to
present a resolution on war-related industries to the Palo
Alto City Council tonight at 7:30 p.m. Specifically the
resolution calls for the banning from Palo Alto of any
more corporations holding Department of Defense
contracts.
Beginning at 8:00 p.m. last night former Vietnam war
correspondent Richard Boyle, author of The Flower and
the Dragon: Breakdown of the U.S. Army in Vietnam,
spoke and presented slides on his experiences in Vietnam.
Boyle said that "the American soliders aren't going to
play Nazi any more" with the Vietnamese civilians.

Bengal Chief Returns Home
NEW DELHI — Sheik Mujibur Rahman landed here this
morning for a triumphal stopover on his way home to a
hero's welcome in Bangladesh, the new nation that calls
him its father.
A British Royal Air Force jetliner carrying the sheik
flew to New Delhi from London. Prime Minister Indira
Gandhi, President V.V. Giri and members of the Indian
Cabinet were on hand to greet him.
Mujib flew to the British capital Saturday after nine
months of detention in West Pakistan.
Mujib, leader of the independence movement in his
country, is recognized by India as the first president of
Bangladesh, the nation born last Dec. 16 when Pakistani
forces in what was then East Pakistan surrendered at the
end of the two-week India-Pakistan war.
After a four-hour stopover in New Delhi, he was
scheduled to fly on to Dacca, the city he left last March
26 when he was arrested by Pakistani authorities on
treason charges.
The sheik thanked Mrs. Gandhi for India's help in
Bangladesh's December war of independence.
McCloskey: 15% Or Out
WASHINGTON — Rep. Paul N. McCloskey (R-Portola
Valley) said yesterday he'll drop out of the presidential
campaign if he fails to get more than 15 to 20 per cent of
the vote in the New Hampshire Republican primary March
7.
"If we do poorly—ls to 20 per cent—it would be clear
that I don't measure up as a presidential candidate . .. and
I'd have to drop out," McCloskey said.
The California congressman has challenged President
Nixon for the party's 1972 nomination because he
opposes Nixon's handling of the Vietnam war and because
he says the administration has deceived the people.
Nixon's other Republican challenger in the New
Hampshire primary, conservative Rep. John M. Ashbrook
of Ohio, said he'll run in several other primaries, including
Florida, "regardless of what I do in New Hampshire."
Klein Blasts Press
WASHINGTON — President Nixon's communications
director, Herbert G. Klein, yesterday accused some news

reporters of libeling Presidential aide Henry Kissinger in
accounts of Kissinger's role in strategy sessions on the
India-Pakistan war. He did not name the publications.
Klein was asked to comment on columnist Jack
Anderson's disclosure of secret papers said to be minutes
of White House strategy sessions on the India-Pakistan
conflict.
The papers quoted Kissinger, the President's national
security adviser, as saying at one point that Nixon wanted
a "tilt in favor of Pakistan." At the same time the
administration was denying that it was anti-India.
Klein said those who conclude that Kissinger "was
lying or distorting the facts" are mistaken.
