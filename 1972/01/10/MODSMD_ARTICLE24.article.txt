# Russo: Rand To Radical
## 
### CHRIS PECK 
Although his face has been splashed
on the front page of most American
newspapers and lit up millions of
television screens because of the role
he played in the release of the
Pentagon Papers last summer,
Anthony Russo insists that his actions
against the war in Vietnam are no
more or less important than the
protest millions of other Americans
have made against the War.
"I don't feel like a martyr for what
I did," Tony Russo said as he prepared
for a talk show on KGO radio in San
Francisco. "All I've done is try to
develop my conscience about the War
and my sense of self. This is what all
Americans are trying to do."
Russo and Daniel Ellsberg have
publicly taken responsibility for the
release of the top secret Pentagon
study on the Vietnam war and have
done so with very clear consciences. "I
had no intent to harm this country by
taking the action I did," Russo
explained in a Friday interview.
"I think I've helped America
because the government has abdicated
its responsibility to the American
people. The government has pursued a
genocidal, aggressive war in violation
of our constitution and in violation of
all the principles of decency. I protest
that action."
Historical Analysis
Ever since 1961 when he was a
graduate student at Princeton's
Woodrow Wilson School of
International affairs, Tony Russo has
been skeptical about American foreign
policy in Southeast Asia. "I had a
good education at the Woodrow
Wilson school," he explained. "I
realized that the domino theory was a
debacle and that the Kennedy
interpretation of the Vietnam war as
another trick by the Russians was
wrong."
As an undergraduate Russo went to
Virginia Tech and studied plasma
physics. Describing himself as a
"smalltown boy," the 35-year-old
Russo has fond memories of his
boyhood in Suffolk, Virginia. "My
father, Anthony J. Russo Sr. was a
hard working, religious man who spent
most of his life working in the
Planter's peanut factory in Suffolk,"
he recalls. "My mother still lives there
and I'd say I have more support for

my actions in that small Virginia town
than anywhere else."
Russo admits he has had his fair
share of abuse over the Pentagon
Papers incident. "I've found that many
people have animosity towards me
because they feel guilty they haven't
done something about the War," he
explained."
"But I don't think people should
feel guilty, nor powerless. It's possible
to be effective in America, but
everyone must begin by working on
his sense of self. Most of us are
alienated people living in a society
preoccupied with death. The men who
are making the decisions in America
are alienated men. We've all got to
start developing our consciousnesses
away from death, towards life."
Personal Harassment
Russo says the controversy over the
release of the Pentagon Papers has
meant continual harassment for him
by state and federal police, a stint in
prison for contempt of court and four
beatings by the Los Angeles police
while he was jailed there.
While the original charges of
contempt of court have been dropped
against Russo, a new indictment issued
on December 29 charged Ellsberg and
Russo with conspiracy and failure to
deliver government documents to
proper sources. At present Russo is
fighting the indictment on the grounds
that he has already been granted
immunity from prosecution last
summer, and therefore cannot be
prosecuted.
"Still," Russo quipped, "if they can
continue to fight a war 75 percent of
the American people are against they
can find a way to railroad me through
somehow."
The road from a smalltown boy in
Suffolk to a conspirator out on bail
has been a reasoned, enlightened
experience for Tony Russo. Explaining
why he ever joined the Rand
Corporation in the first place, Russo
said, "My interest in Rand wasn't to
get into the organization to destroy it,
but rather I was interested in getting a
broad first-hand view of American
policymaking."
Vietnam Experience
Russo first went to Vietnam with
Rand in 1965. He worked as an
interviewer for the Viet Cong
Motivation and Morale Project. His job

took him to a dozen different South
Vietnamese prisons to talk with Viet
Cong prisoners and defectors.
"I got to know the Vietnamese on
both sides very well while I worked on
the motivation and morale project,"
Russo recalled, "and I was being
labeled a 'radical' by the other Rand
employees. The better I got to know
the Vietnamese the more vulgar the
Americans in Vietnam seemed to me.
We were nothing more than elitists,
racists, and colonialists."
It was in Vietnam that Russo first
met Daniel Ellsberg. Ellsberg was
working at a high level for Rand and
was not yet of the same mind as Russo
about the war effort. Both men
returned to Rand in 1966 and it was
here that the two of them began to
seriously consider the implications of
their work.
Anti-War Activism
"During 1967 Dan and I spent
almost all of our time together talking
about the War," Russo remembered.
"We realized that the men who were
running the Vietnam war in
Washington and at Rand were running
their program on lies, secrecy and
deceit. It was an establishment brand
of L.S.D."
Just prior to the release of the
Pentagon Papers Russo said he felt
"things were getting so heavy I was
insignificant compared to the
Pentagon Papers. I felt that what ever
happened to me was insignificant as
long as the American public got to see
those documents."
More Vietnams?
"There's a good possibility that
there will be more Vietnams in
America's future." he added, "more
academic whores at Rand who will do
anything for money, more alienated
men in Washington to believe in such
wars."
"The old saying 'Power Corrupts' is
very relevant in a discussion of
America's future," Rusco continued.
"It's important to remember a message
given the court during the Satco and
Vanzetti trial by Judge Thayer. Thayer
said that a government which has
come to honor it's own secrets more
than the lives of its citizens has
become a tyranny whether you call it
a republic, a monarchy or anything
else."
