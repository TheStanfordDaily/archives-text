# Lyman Accepts Decision, Asks Franklin Dismissal
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
President Richard Lyman yesterday
accepted the Advisory Board's
majority recommendation, which
upheld his dismissal charges against
revolutionary English Professor H.
Bruce Franklin.
Lyman's announcement reported,
"1 accept the decision of the
majority . .. that Professor Franklin
be dismissed from the faculty
immediately and that a sum equal to
his salary until August 31, 1972 be
paid to him."
The decision came in a letter to
lawyer Robert Minge Brown, president
of the Board of Trustees. Lyman
emphasized that the tenure policy
"requires the concurrence of the
Board of Trustees before such a
decision as this can become effective."
Brown responded that the Board
will "fix a date later this month" to
act upon Lyman's decision at a special
meeting.
Trustee approval of Franklin's
ouster is considered certain, although
Brown wrote that Franklin "will be
given an opportunity to advise the
Board in writing of his reasons why
the Board should not concur."
Franklin insisted he was considering
sending the Trustees a letter, telling
them "this has really taught me a
lesson, that I can be rehabilitated."
The Maoist added he would tell the
Trustees that "my belief that the
university is deeply involved in the war
is a hallucination, and I was probably
fooled by Communist propaganda."
Lyman's letter, drafted by him and
Vice-provost Robert Rosenzweig, said
"The dismissal of a tenured faculty
member is an act with few
precedents."
But Lyman wrote that "on specific
occasions in particular circumstances"
Franklin's speech "exceeded
permissable bounds" by inciting
campus disruptions.
" The present decision provides no
legitimate basis for assaults on the
essential rights of faculty

anywhere . . . That (Advisory Board)
report in all its parts is grounded in a
broad conception of free speech, a
high standard of proof, and a
scrupulous regard for the procedural
rights of faculty."
Lyman admitted some people were
bound, to react with "shock and
uncertainty" at the dismissal decision,
but he insisted the Board's decision
upheld "the freedom to hold and
advocate whatever views one's
conscience or knowledge may lead one
to have, no matter how unpopular or
disturbing to orthodoxy or downright
outrageous those views may appear to
others, and no matter how large the
majority that dislikes them."
"Professor Franklin, in common
with all other members of the
Stanford faculty, has long enjoyed
that freedom," Lyman wrote.
Lyman's decision came two days
after a radical meeting in Memorial
Church demanded Franklin's
reinstatement by noon Tuesday, "or
else."
Less militant objections to the

dismissal also continued. In a personal
letter to Lyman, English Department
Chairman W. Bliss Carnochan charged
that Franklin was not provided full
Constitutional rights and that the
majority's selection of dismissal
seemed to be based on "retaliation."
Franklin this weekend raised the
possibility that he would soon be
permitted to appear on campus
through a loophole in an injunction
which bars him.
The injunction, obtained a year ago,
bars Franklin until "his suspension
shall have been ended." Franklin
insists that his dismissal will end his
suspension, allowing him to return.
Presidential lawyer .lames Siena
would not comment on Franklin's
interpretation, saying, "We're not in
the business of gi\ing advisory
opinions on the injunction."
Franklin insisted that he would
lecture, either on or off campus, to
some sessions of English 190, an "ad
hoc seminar" based on the "Literature
and Revolution" course he had
planned to teach this quarter.

the business of gi\ing advisory
opinions on the injunction."
Franklin insisted that he would
lecture, either on or off campus, to
some sessions of English 190, an "ad
hoc seminar" based on the "Literature
and Revolution" course he had
planned to teach this quarter.
President Richard Lyman yesterday
accepted the Advisory Board's
majority recommendation, which
upheld his dismissal charges against
revolutionary English Professor H.
Bruce Franklin.
Lyman's announcement reported,
"1 accept the decision of the
majority . .. that Professor Franklin
be dismissed from the faculty
immediately and that a sum equal to
his salary until August 31, 1972 be
paid to him."
The decision came in a letter to
lawyer Robert Minge Brown, president
of the Board of Trustees. Lyman
emphasized that the tenure policy
"requires the concurrence of the
Board of Trustees before such a
decision as this can become effective."
Brown responded that the Board
will "fix a date later this month" to
act upon Lyman's decision at a special
meeting.
Trustee approval of Franklin's
ouster is considered certain, although
Brown wrote that Franklin "will be
given an opportunity to advise the
Board in writing of his reasons why
the Board should not concur."
Franklin insisted he was considering
sending the Trustees a letter, telling
them "this has really taught me a
lesson, that I can be rehabilitated."
The Maoist added he would tell the
Trustees that "my belief that the
university is deeply involved in the war
is a hallucination, and I was probably
fooled by Communist propaganda."
Lyman's letter, drafted by him and
Vice-provost Robert Rosenzweig, said
"The dismissal of a tenured faculty
member is an act with few
precedents."
But Lyman wrote that "on specific
occasions in particular circumstances"
Franklin's speech "exceeded
permissable bounds" by inciting
campus disruptions.
" The present decision provides no
legitimate basis for assaults on the
essential rights of faculty

anywhere . . . That (Advisory Board)
report in all its parts is grounded in a
broad conception of free speech, a
high standard of proof, and a
scrupulous regard for the procedural
rights of faculty."
Lyman admitted some people were
bound, to react with "shock and
uncertainty" at the dismissal decision,
but he insisted the Board's decision
upheld "the freedom to hold and
advocate whatever views one's
conscience or knowledge may lead one
to have, no matter how unpopular or
disturbing to orthodoxy or downright
outrageous those views may appear to
others, and no matter how large the
majority that dislikes them."
"Professor Franklin, in common
with all other members of the
Stanford faculty, has long enjoyed
that freedom," Lyman wrote.
Lyman's decision came two days
after a radical meeting in Memorial
Church demanded Franklin's
reinstatement by noon Tuesday, "or
else."
Less militant objections to the

dismissal also continued. In a personal
letter to Lyman, English Department
Chairman W. Bliss Carnochan charged
that Franklin was not provided full
Constitutional rights and that the
majority's selection of dismissal
seemed to be based on "retaliation."
Franklin this weekend raised the
possibility that he would soon be
permitted to appear on campus
through a loophole in an injunction
which bars him.
The injunction, obtained a year ago,
bars Franklin until "his suspension
shall have been ended." Franklin
insists that his dismissal will end his
suspension, allowing him to return.
Presidential lawyer .lames Siena
would not comment on Franklin's
interpretation, saying, "We're not in
the business of gi\ing advisory
opinions on the injunction."
