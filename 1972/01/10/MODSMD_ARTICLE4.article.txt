# Hoover Library Evokes Criticism
## 
### PHIL REVZIN Third in a series 
Libraries are usually non-ideological places.
Where extensive collections are freely available to
people interested in using them, there is little
controversy. However, the Hoover Library, housing
the foremost collection in the United States of
material dealing with the Russian Revolution,
among other things, has not been free of critics.
Most of this controversy comes from a confusion
of the Institution's two reasonably distinct
functions. The most visible function, 285 feet high,
is the library of over one million volumes,
microfilms, documents, and historical memorabilia.
This collection is open to Stanford faculty,
students, and staff, and is used by hundreds of
visiting researchers from universities all over the
world.
Second Function
The second function is that of the research and
publication program operated by Hoover staff
researchers and visiting researchers. The work of
these researchers has been labeled by many as
slanted toward the right-wing.
Researchers have at their disposal personal papers
of people ranging from President Hoover to
Alexander Kerensky to General -Joseph Stilwell, as
well as countless periodicals and publications
dealing with the 1968 Russian intervention in

Prague. Also available are papers of leaders of the
Batista government in Cuba shortly before Castro's
takeover.
Money for the library function of the Institution
comes from University general funds and from
independent sources. Last year the Institution spent
$1 million on the library, and $800,000 on research.
The University provided $550,000. Gifts,
endowment earnings, and sales of publications and
microfilm provided the remainder of the
$2,150,000 total budget.
Hoover Director W. Glenn Campbell explains
that the University funds are in a sense payment for
the service of maintaining the library, and that the
University has been happy in the past with the way
the library has been run.
Collections
The library is divided into six general collections:
Africa, East Asia, Eastern Europe, Latin America,
Middle East, and Western Europe. Each collection
is under the directorship of a curator, responsible to
Campbell.
As the 1969 Hoover Institution Report states,
"archival holdings are the key to the Institution's
importance as a specialized research library." The
library's rare materials attract most of the
researchers who staff Hoover's research and
publications program.
Hoover has participated, since 1967, in a Western

Consortium of 15 universities, designed to increase
Hoover's collections, and to provide better service
to member schools, in terms of shared materials.
Seeking Material
According to Campbell, the Institution is
constantly seeking new material. Much material has
been gathered from communist countries in the
past, through exchange arrangements and outright
purchases. Campbell sees such exchange programs
continuing, and perhaps expanding as United States
relations with Communist China improve.
Campbell himself plans to visit Russia sometime
in the next year. The Director sees as crucial a
vigorous acquisition program. Under Campbell's
leadership the total holdings of the Institution have
more than doubled to their present levels.
As a collection of material, the Hoover
Institution is a valuable research tool. It is in the
application of the resources of the Institution by
staff researchers that controversy arises. Critics
charge that Hoover researchers are biased and
unscholarly, and that the thrust of the research
program is toward Communism and liberation
movements. Others charge that the gift funds which
Hoover receives come from people who expect
certain results from the research they help sponsor,
an unhealthy attitude in an academic community.
