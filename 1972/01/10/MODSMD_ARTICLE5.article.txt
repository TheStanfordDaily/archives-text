## Stop War Recruiting 
### 
The question of war recruitment on campus has
,been undeniably one of the most debated, least
.agreed upon, and most vitally important issues to
attack the consciences of the community over the
past four years. Sparking the 1968 Old Union sit-in,
the issue continued unresolved through last spring's
disregarded student referendum and last quarter's
on-again, off-again protests and disruptions in and
around the Placement Center.
But a return of students to the library, the
excitement over another Rose Bowl, and a general
frustration over the uselessness of protest seemed to
remove the recruiting controversy from the minds
of many. The Committee on Student Services,
authorized by President Lyman to make
recommendations based on April's referendum, has
held open meetings each evening during the past
week to discuss the war recruitment issue but few
witnesses have attended-even some committee
members have failed to show up.
Events over the past few days, however, have put
the war recruitment issue back into the forefront of
the thinking of many activists. Six or more people
arc soon to be charged before the new campus
judicial body for their part in alleged disruptions at
the Placement Center early last November.
Advertisements and opinion columns in last week's
Dailys presented two concise accounts of faculty
opinion on the controversy, and served to re-open
debate on the subject.
The firing of Bruce Franklin, praised by some,
has caused resentment among many segments of the
community. Over 400 people turned out for a rally
and march in Franklin's behalf on Thursday, and
175 radicals met for long hours in the Church
Friday evening after the speeches by Daniel Fllsberg
and Anthony Russo, determined to take some sort
of action in protest of not only the Advisory
Board's decision, but also the University's
contribution to the war that Ellsberg and so many
others have tried to stop.
.The first and most obvious target of protest was
the one selected: the scheduled appearance today at
the Business School of recruiters for the
Department of Defense.
Since the beginning of the school year, the U.S.
Marine Corps, Navy, and Air Force, as well as
Honeywell, Hughes Research Labs, and others all
major contributors to the killing in Southeast
Asia-have recruited on campus. The appearance of
representatives of the DOD itself is merely the
pinnacle of such activities.

We believe it is clear that such recruiting does not
belong on campus.
These companies and organizations are involved
in actions which harm other human beings, and as
Professor Hubert Marshall pointed out in his Daily
column last Thursday, the first step towards those
actions is usually recruitment.
All societies legislate against individuals and
groups which inflict injury and destruction on
others. Stanford must not be an exception.
Defenders of the concept of unrestricted recruiting,
the Administration included, claim a limited policy
must be avoided because it would be nothing more
than "moral inspection"â€” supposedly a new concept
for Stanford. This is a strange fear to voiced by
members of a University which restricts its athletes
from participating against Brigham Young
University, allows living groups (by majority vote)
to impose social regulations on their own members,
and is guided academically and socially by the
Honor Code and the Fundamental Standard. All of
these are imposed moral decisions.
Various members of the University community
have requested that the DOD recruiters take time
out today to meet with them outside the Business
School to discuss their role in the war and at the
University. When such discussions have taken place
in the past between recruiters or Trustees and
community members against the University's
complicity in the war, the results have not been
monumental. Often neither side listens or is able to
relate to the other in the slightest degree. We hope
this will not be the case this time around.
With a serious split existing among Stanford
students, faculty, and staff over the recruitment
question, we feel the DOD representatives here
today cannot afford to ignore those that come to
question them and their purposes. Likewise we hope
those that come to question will do so rationally,
keeping in mind their overall goal of ending
war-related recruitment on campus. Dramatic
confrontations can serve to publicize the issue and
help educate the audience, but violent action could
only serve to cloud the question not only in the
minds of the majority of the community, but in the
minds of the Administration who will ultimately
decide the policy.
Above all, we urge the University to abandon its
hypocritical posture of imposing moral and ethical
codes on its students and faculty in numerous
instances, while at the same time it argues that
limiting recruiting on campus is unthinkable because
it would impose "prepackaged moral judgments for
individuals."
