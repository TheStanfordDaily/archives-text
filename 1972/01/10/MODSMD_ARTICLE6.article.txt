There is only one real issue
at stake during "Meet the DoD
Week" at Stanford: Whether
those who are aiding and
abetting the destruction of
lives and resources in
Indochina should be allowed to
operate free and at large on the
Stanford campus, despite the
manifest criminality of their
activities. We say that these
criminals should be brought to
the bar of justice by any means
necessary.

Learning From Ralston
Editor, THE DAILY:
Stanford University has
proved itself a smaller place
than most of us had thought.
The University has declared it
cannot accommodate Bruce
Franklin, so he must go.
Nevertheless, I hope Bruce
Franklin learns what John

Ralston already knows: That
sometimes a person must leave
Stanford not merely because
the institution has become too
small for the man, but also
oecause the man has become
too large for the institution.

Inciting Violence
Editor, THE DAILY:
Those who support the
firing of Bruce Franklin claim
that they do so not because of
his personal beliefs but because
he incited others to violence.
When the U.S. Air Force, the
Marines, and the Honeywell
Corporation use private offices
at the Placement Center to
persuade students to make a
career of dropping bombs, or
designing them, what are they
doing if not inciting others to
violence?
I can only conclude that
many distinguished faculty
members on this campus
believe that incitement to
violence is wrong when the
violence is directed against
Stanford, but is thoroughly
acceptable when the potential
victims are Asian peasants.
F. Sargent Royce
Against Dismissal
Editor, THE DAILY:
The Advisory Board, I am
convinced, reached its decision
conscientiously and after an

exemplary display of patience
and endurance. I nevertheless
strongly urge President Lyman
to impose some penalty short
of dismissal.
The question of Bruce
Franklin's own rights and
freedoms is perhaps the
primary one. But I wish to
underscore the
Kennedy-Brown opinion that
"less well-buffered institutions
may become more vulnerable
to outside pressures". The
divided vote is particularly
significant. Dismissal by
President Lyman would mean
that tenure (with its essential
protections of freedom of
speech and political affiliation)
was lost even in a case
involving disagreement and
doubt within a blue-ribbon
jury-
Many of us forget the latent
conservatism of many small or
financially insecure colleges
(and some large public ones).
It becomes intensified in times
of political unrest. I can cite a

personal example from 1952,
at the height of the McCarthy
period of intimidation. I was
then a tenured associate
professor at Harvard, where we
believed the commitment to
tenure was absolute. At a late
evening party I ventured
statements critical of
McCarthy, and was surprised
to find new acquaintances
(teachers from New York
universities, some without
tenure) remain silent. After
the party a friend accused me
of thoughtlessly embarassing
the others. "It was all very
well for you to talk. You have
security."
Even the slightest
weakening of Stanford's
commitment to a strong
principle of tenure will, I am
sure, lead to its rapid erosion
in some colleges and its
abolition in others.

Against Dismissal
Editor, THE DAILY:
The Advisory Board, I am
convinced, reached its decision
conscientiously and after an

exemplary display of patience
and endurance. I nevertheless
strongly urge President Lyman
to impose some penalty short
of dismissal.
The question of Bruce
Franklin's own rights and
freedoms is perhaps the
primary one. But I wish to
underscore the
Kennedy-Brown opinion that
"less well-buffered institutions
may become more vulnerable
to outside pressures". The
divided vote is particularly
significant. Dismissal by
President Lyman would mean
that tenure (with its essential
protections of freedom of
speech and political affiliation)
was lost even in a case
involving disagreement and
doubt within a blue-ribbon
jury-
Many of us forget the latent
conservatism of many small or
financially insecure colleges
(and some large public ones).
It becomes intensified in times
of political unrest. I can cite a

personal example from 1952,
at the height of the McCarthy
period of intimidation. I was
then a tenured associate
professor at Harvard, where we
believed the commitment to
tenure was absolute. At a late
evening party I ventured
statements critical of
McCarthy, and was surprised
to find new acquaintances
(teachers from New York
universities, some without
tenure) remain silent. After
the party a friend accused me
of thoughtlessly embarassing
the others. "It was all very
well for you to talk. You have
security."
Even the slightest
weakening of Stanford's
commitment to a strong
principle of tenure will, I am
sure, lead to its rapid erosion
in some colleges and its
abolition in others.

There is only one real issue
at stake during "Meet the DoD
Week" at Stanford: Whether
those who are aiding and
abetting the destruction of
lives and resources in
Indochina should be allowed to
operate free and at large on the
Stanford campus, despite the
manifest criminality of their
activities. We say that these
criminals should be brought to
the bar of justice by any means
necessary.

Learning From Ralston
Editor, THE DAILY:
Stanford University has
proved itself a smaller place
than most of us had thought.
The University has declared it
cannot accommodate Bruce
Franklin, so he must go.
Nevertheless, I hope Bruce
Franklin learns what John

Ralston already knows: That
sometimes a person must leave
Stanford not merely because
the institution has become too
small for the man, but also
oecause the man has become
too large for the institution.

Inciting Violence
Editor, THE DAILY:
Those who support the
firing of Bruce Franklin claim
that they do so not because of
his personal beliefs but because
he incited others to violence.
When the U.S. Air Force, the
Marines, and the Honeywell
Corporation use private offices
at the Placement Center to
persuade students to make a
career of dropping bombs, or
designing them, what are they
doing if not inciting others to
violence?
I can only conclude that
many distinguished faculty
members on this campus
believe that incitement to
violence is wrong when the
violence is directed against
Stanford, but is thoroughly
acceptable when the potential
victims are Asian peasants.
