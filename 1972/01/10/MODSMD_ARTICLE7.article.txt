# Lyman's Letter Asking Dismissal
## 
### 
Following is the text of a Jan. 8
letter from Stanford President
Richard W. Lyman to Robert
Minge Brown, president of the
Stanford Board of Trustees,
accepting the majority decision of
the Advisory Board.
I have received and had the
opportunity of reviewing the
decision of the Advisory Board on
the charges brought by the
University against Professor H.
Bruce Franklin. 1 must now report
that 1 accept the decision of the
majority of the Advisory Board
that Professor Franklin be
dismissed from the faculty
immediately and that a sum equal
to his salary until August 31,
1972, be paid to him. In so doing,
1 call your attention to paragraph
15 (b) of the "Statement of
Policy on Appointment and
Tenure at Stanford University,"
which requires the concurrence of
the Board of Trustees before such
a decision as this can become
effective.
In reaching the above
conclusion I have given full weight
to the fact that the Advisory
Board found in Professor
Franklin's favor on the first of the
four charges and that on the third
and fourth charges, as well as on
the sanction, two members of the
Board dissented. I believe,
however, that the Board's findings
against Prof?ssor Franklin on the
charges arising from the events of
February 10, 1971, are wholly
persuasive. The dissents on
charges three and four do not, in
my view, undermine the
conclusions of the five-man
majority on matters of fact or
motivation.
I wish to call special attention
to an issue addressed by both the
majority and the minority of the
Board, namely the effect of this
decision on free speech and

academic freedom at Stanford and
at other institutions of higher
education. It is significant that the
issue was a salient one for all
members of the Board, and 1 have
given particular thought to the
fact that this concern weighed so
heavily in the conclusions of two
men whom I know to be as
devoted to this University as are
Professors Brown and Kennedy.
Yet I am convinced that no fair
and careful reading of the record
of this case will provide comfort
for any who may be tempted to
use it as precedent for an attack
on the freedoms essential to an
academic institution. Chief among
these is, of course, the freedom to
hold and advocate whatever views
one's conscience and knowledge
may lead one to have, no matter
how unpopular or disturbing to
orthodoxy or downright
outrageous those views may
appear to others, and no matter
how large may be the majority
that dislikes them. Professor
Franklin, in common with all
other members of the Stanford
faculty, has long enjoyed that
freedom. The decision of the
Advisory Board rests on the
conclusion that on specific
occasions in particular
circumstances his speech exceeded
permissible bounds by "urging
and inciting to the use of illegal
coercion and violence, methods
intolerable in a university devoted
to the free exchange and
exploration of ideas." My
agreement with that conclusion is

buttressed by the knowledge that
the minority dissent is based on
disagreement over the
interpretation of fact and motive
and over the appropriateness of
penalty, not on a finding that the
University's intention or action in
bringing the case was directed
against the right of a faculty
member to believe and to espouse
unpopular views.
The dismissal of a tenured
faculty member is an act with few
precedents. Even though in this
case the procedures prescribed in
the "Policy on Appointment and
Tenure" have been followed
scrupulously, and the faculty has
acted through its own elected
representatives with the fullest
due process, there is bound to be
shock and uncertainty in the
minds of many when the result is
a decision for severance. That
persons of integrity should differ
in predicting the consequences
should surprise no one. Clearly no
one can speak with complete
confidence about future events at
other institutions; what can be
said with confidence is that the
present decision provides no
legitimate basis for assaults on the
essential rights of faculty
anywhere. We can speak more
certainly about the future of our
own institution. If any person
doubts that the future of Stanford
will include the full measure of
openness to the expression of the
widest variety of views he must
read in full the report of the
Advisory Board. That report in all

of its parts is firmly grounded in a
broad conception of free speech, a
high standard of proof, and a
scrupulous regard for the
procedural rights of faculty. I am
satisfied that we can ask no more
and I therefore l concur in the
decision presented to me.

.1 â€¢ <i I.
Following is the text of a
statement from Robert Minge
Brown, president of the Board of
'JYustees, released Sunday, Jan. 9,
following receipt of the letter
from President Lyman:
I have received President
Lyman's decision accepting the
majority decision of the Faculty
Advisory Board that Professor
Franklin be dismissed.
The University's policy on
appointment and tenure states:
"In case the decision of the
President is to terminate
employment, such decision shall
not become effective until it has
been reported to and concurred in
by the Board of Trustees."
There is not sufficient time for
the Board to consider and act
upon this matter at its regular
meeting on Tuesday, Jan. 11th. I
expect that on Tuesday the Board
will fix a date later this month for
a special meeting of the Board to
consider this case. I also expect
that Professor Franklin will be
given an opportunity to advise the
Board in writing of his reasons
why the Board should not concur
in the decision of the Advisory
Board and of President Lyman.
