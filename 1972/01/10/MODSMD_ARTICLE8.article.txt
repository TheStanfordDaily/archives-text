## To Meet The DOD Recruiters 
### 
Letter to the Daily,
In line with Stanford's long tradition as an
apolitical institution, the office of the Assistant
Secretary of Defense is recruiting today at the
Graduate School of Business.
The DOD is coming as a community service to
the Stanford Student Body and the people of
Indochina. In response, the Young Crows have sent
the following telegram:
To The Office of the Assistant Secretary of
Defense
In re: Recruiting at Stanford
We have been advised of the forthcoming visit
of your recruiters on January 10 and 11 at the
Stanford Graduate School of Business. This is
very fortunate as it comes in
"meet-the-Department of Defense week" a
series of activities on the Stanford campus aimed
at acquainting students with the presence of the
DOD at Stanford. We welcome this opportunity
to hold open community discussions on your
role in the maintenance of U.S. military and
economic supremacy in S.E. Asia and around the
world. We would be further interested in

discussing the propriety of military recruiting on
the Stanford campus. These discussions will be
held inside or outside the Graduate School of
Business, depending upon your preference. We
suggest 12:45 Monday January 10. We will be
there.
â€”The Association of Young Crows
The role of the DOD in the Indochinese War
and in other U.S. military ventures is well
known. As an instrument of international
repression the DOD has no right to conduct
business by recruiting at Stanford.
The rights of the Indochinese people to live
and to determine their own future take
precedence over the DOD's need to integrate
Stanford students as systems analysts into the
War Machine.
Stanford must be rehabilitated until it serves
the interests of all the people, not just a
corporate-military elite. People will meet outside
the Graduate School of Business at 12:45 today
to greet the recruiters.
