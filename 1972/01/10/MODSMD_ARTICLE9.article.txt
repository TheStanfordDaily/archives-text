## Three Points For Franklin 
###

Editor's Note: The following
letter, dated January 7, was sent
to President Lyman.
I don't want to try to represent
the views of the English
Department in this letter. That
would be inappropriate and
probably impossible. Members of
the Department have no doubt a
wide range of views. I'm speaking
for myself.
Having studied the
recommendation of the Advisory
Board, and having sat in on much
of the hearings, I'm aware of the
time and human energy that have
gone into these proceedings.
Though I disagree with the
Board's recommendation, I don't
do so lightly. Three points seem
to me especially important.
First, I think the
recommendation and findings of
fact do not provide Professor
Franklin with the same
"protection of his Constitutional
rights at Stanford" as "that to
which he would be entitled as a
member of the faculty of a state
university" (p. 8). Surely the
standards of Constitutional
protection differ from those
implied in a sentence on p. 15:
"The general practice of

conforming to norms may instruct
individual faculty members about
those norms just as clearly as
would occasional cases of
discipline for breach of
standards."
And surely the sentence just
quoted conflicts in spirit with the
verbal service that is paid a few
lines later to "faculty autonomy
and initiative." The assertion that
"nothing" in the unwritten
traditions of the University
"collides with Constitutionally
guarded freedoms" (p.
assumes a fact that in this casi
needs to be demonstrated. 1 think
that demonstration has not been
made. The line of argument is
circular. From the beginning, the
question is begged.
Second, the rationale for the
penalty recommended is obscure
and unconvincing. The Board says
that "retaliation" does not
deserve consideration as a warrant
for sanctions, that
"rehabilitation" is not in this case
a useful concept, but that
detterence ("it can be argued")
has real force. It's not clear,
however, what criterion is finally
in use.
The recommendation says (p.
138) that "severe penalties are not
in our view inappropriately
matched to the gravity of the
charges." As a legal principle, that
strikes me as sensible, but in the
light of the categories previously
established this notion of "what is

appropriate" looks suspiciously
like a version of retaliation. The
preliminary discussion of
guidelines for sanction aims to
rationalize a theory of extreme
punitive "benevolence," similar to
the usual theories in favor of
capital punishment.
Theories like those are
implausible, this one no less than
others. It isn't a coincidence, I
think, that the Board describes
the consequences of dismissal in
language that conceals the human
realities it seeks to describe:
"Dismissal is a penalty of
undoubted severity because of
its absolute effect upon the
immediate institutional
relationship combined with its
impact upon employment
opportunities elsewhere within
and even outside the
profession."
Not that style is of first
importance, but it is important
when it points to substance and
intention. That is what it usually
does, and I think that is what it
does here.
Third,. the University's
obligation to protect unpopular
opinion is historically compelling.
It would be superfluous to repeat
what Professors Brown and
Kennedy have said so eloquently
on that subject in their minority
opinion. I hope that you will take
their views into account and also,
perhaps, that you will make an
historian's estimate of the
probabilities: is it likely that, in
the judgement of time, Professor
Franklin's dismissal will seem to
have been warranted? As you will
know, I don't think so.
