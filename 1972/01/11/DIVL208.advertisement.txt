Bruce Franklin is being fired, not because of
illegal acts, but because the political views he
states are, as Professors Brown and Kennedy
say in the Board decision, "uncomfortably
heterodox" — that is, they frighten many
people connected with Stanford University.
Firing Franklin is an act of political repression
which threatens all of us who think that the
freedom to make even the most "uncomfort
ably heterodox" statements must be protected
so long as those statements do not constitute
illegal acts. Bruce Franklin wants to contest his
firing in the courts, and that contest will really
be on behalf of our civil liberties as well as his
own. Costs will be at least $25,000. The
Faculty Political Action Group and the ASSU
