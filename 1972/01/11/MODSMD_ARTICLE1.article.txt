# Are Hoover Publications Biased?

### PHIL REVZIN Last in a series 
"Our publications have been published by many
leading University presses, in addition to our own
press. They have been widely and favorably
reviewed," says Hoover Institution Director W.
Glenn Campbell.
While scholars have complimented much of the
research, Campbell and his staff have come under the
most fire from critics who claim that the research
staff is heavily weighted toward right-wing views,
and that some of this right-wing scholarship is of
low quality.
"We have a balanced staff," says the Director,"
and our research products are favorably recieved
nationally and internationally."
History Professor Peter Stern, in an article in the
September 1,1969 issue of The Nation, commented
"while the direction of Hoover research programs
merits criticism, its outstanding publications and
current research program are praiseworthy. The
conservative stance of many on the staff is
undeniable, but only a few of them can be charged
with producing unscholarly work."
Semi-Autonomy
Hoover's financial situation, and its
semi-autonomy from the University, have
contrinuted to the criticism. The Institution receives
University funds for maintaining the library. The
library amounts for about half of the $2 million budget,the
rest of which concerns the research and publications
program.

Most of the money for the research program
comes from gifts, endowment earnings, and sales of
publications, the Institution also received about
$100,000 in Federal Grants last year.
Campbell and his staff maintain nearly complete
control over how this money is spent, although
federal grants must go through regular University
research committees.
"The autonomy comes from the ability of the
staff and the projects they are involved with to
attract gift funds. In essence, how much we can
spend depends on how much in gift funds we can
attract," says Campbell.
Gift funds are given to Stanford, Campbell points
out, and may be earmarked for Hoover Institution.
Allan Belmont, Associate Director for
Administration, commented that, "if the donors
want to attach strings to their gifts, we won't accept
them,lt is very hard for outside people to control
Hoover, and that is part of the reason for all the
criticism."
Merger With General Collection
Political Science Professor Charles Drekmeir
commented that he felt that there should be a
reexamination of Hoover's connection to the
University. "As of now, the President is the only
link. I feel that there should be a faculty committee
to govern the collection. That material should be a
formal part of the University, perhaps merged with
the general collection."
Drekmeir added that he felt that Hoover's

reputation of being anti-communist tends to color
the perceptions of Stanford to people in other parts
of the country.
The research and publications program supports
staff researchers at Hoover, and aids the Hoover
press in publishing manuscripts of scholars from
throughout the country.
Ongoing projects include a Yearbook on
International Communist Affairs,which, according
to Publications Director Brian Benson, provides an
"objective view of what international communist
parties have been doing, based on Party documents
themselves." The Yearbook has been published
since 1966.
The Hoover Catalog includes listings for books
on Comminist Parties all over the world. Included
are publications on Communist Parties of Cypress,
Venezuela, Yugoslavia, Russia, China, Israel,
Australia, Turkey, Ceylon, and Korea. Of the 101
titles published by Hoover in the 1971 catalog. 57
deal directly with Communism and Communist
Parties.
Reviews In Scholarly Journals
Benson points to reviews of Hoover books in
scholarly journals as being evidence of the quality of
the research. "In the set of reviews, which can only
be called impressive, the criteria used has always
been quality of scholarship rather than
politics."Belmont added, "We don't have time for
that sort of thing."
