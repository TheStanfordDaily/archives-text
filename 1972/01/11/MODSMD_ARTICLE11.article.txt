# What The Footballers Saw Before The Rose Bowl
## 
### TODD McCARTHY 
Any critical comments I could
offer about "Straw Dogs" might
seem irrelevant in face of the fact
that it was this film that the
Stanford football team saw the
night before it went on to win its
second Rose Bowl game in a row.
It is certainly a marvellous
coincidence and perhaps poetic
justice that the Michigan team saw
"The Wild Bunch," for not only is
"Straw Dogs" a slightly better
film but any film critic, especially
Stanford's own, would like to
think that the mighty Thunder
Chickens were at least marginally
inspired by Dustin Hoffman's
successful defense of his own
home against boorish attackers.
Besides, for all the heroism of its
characters, 'The Wild Bunch" is a
film about losers.
"Straw Dogs" may be Sam
Peckinpah's most personal film,
though it can't quite replace "The
Ballad of Cable Hogue" in my
affections as his best. The film has
been cut since it left Peckinpah's
hands, continuing in the worst
tradition of "Major Dundee" and
"The Wild Bunch."
Having shown the film in
October at a San Francisco sneak
preview in its original version,
Cinerama Releasing Company got
scared and pared down the
violence to avoid an X rating
(Warner Brothers reportedly
performed similar surgery on
"Dirty Harry" but doesn't seem
to be suffering commercially with
its X-rated "A Clockwork
Orange").
Some women have reacted
with revulsion to the alleged
anti-woman slant of "Straw Dogs"
and British critics in particular
have lashed out at the film's

extreme violence, maintaining
that such irresponsible actions
simply aren't performed by the
English, "Ryan's Daughter" and
the continuing conflict in Ireland
notwithstanding. The violence of
"Straw Dogs" is certainly
affectingly agonizing but for pure
shock value it can't match that of
"Night of the Living Dead," a film
which features a strikingly similar
climatic situation.
Many of the favorable reviews
of "Straw Dogs" have stressed the
mythic proportions of Dustin
Hoffman's character, that of an
American scholar come to
Cornwall with his beautiful
English wife to escape the
ever-increasing horror of life in
the States. He is, as Peckinpah
sees him, a good American liberal
in the worst sense, not because he
has run away from the problems
of a complex society but because
he carries his spinelessness with
him wherever he goes.
His wife, possessions and
person are respectively threatened
until he is finally forced to
physically defend that which is
most important to him, his house,
his sancutary which defines his
world (and only secondarily, his
wife). It is only the successful
defense of these values which can
define and justify him as a man.
This may sound like
psychological primitivism on
Peckinpah's part, but the director
brings his point home most
compellingly through his excellent
control of the thriller format and
the totally believable modernity

of the Hoffman character.
Peckinpah really doesn't mean for
the viewer to sympathize with or
like the main character, but
Hoffman is more or less the
protagonist by default and at
some spots is treated generously
by the director if only to make
the film work on the basic thriller
level.
Hoffman puts his work before
attentiveness to his wife, disrupts
the natural flow of lovemaking
with her to hang up his clothes
and set the alarm and generally
strives to maintain against all
threats the carefully controlled
comfortable world in which he
has ensconced himself. It is this
aspect of the character that I
think many Americans can
respond to and identify with,
however unwillingly, for
Peckinpah means this
procrastination and cautiousness
to be the character's most
damnable trait.
Thus, at the same time one
feels oneself coming closer to
Hoffman, Peckinpah's implied
scorn and distancing evoke the
uncomfortable realization that
what may be closest to the truth
about many Americans is what
Peckinpah is condemning most
severely.
It may seem curious that
Peckinpah, whose work is so
irrevocably linked with the Old
West, migrated to modem
England to make his most closely
felt statement about America
today. In 'The Wild Bunch" and

"Cable Hogue," Peckinpah
mourned the passing of the
American originals who, through
the force of their personalities and
actions, forged a distinctive
portion of the mythic American
character. Hoffman's character in
"Straw Dogs" is a total wash-out
who doesn't assert himself even
after his pet has been murdered,
his privacy invaded and his wife
raped.
Only when confronted with a
threat to the very core of his
world does he react, and then it is
with such all-out effort and
resourcefulness that it can only be
traced to that bit of courage and
originality that perhaps Peckinpah
hopes is still present, if only
latently, in the American persona.
The American makes his stand
successfully, but one is
nonetheless left with a rather
ambivalent response to his
performance, as if it was the least
he could do.
As for the charge that "Straw
Dogs" is disgustingly anti-woman,
Peckinpah's has always been a
man's world and he probably
couldn't care less about feminist
(or any other) rhetoric. The
depiction of rape on the screen by
no means defines a director as
anti-woman but what provokes
some doubt is the response with
which Peckinpah endows the
woman. Hoffman's wife clearly
teases the men working around
the house and though terrified of
the rapist, doesn't offer an
exceptional amount of resistance

and can even be said to show
some signs of enjoying the
experience.
Indeed, it remains unclear as to
whether she ever mentions the
episode to her husband. Of what
there can't be any doubt is that
Susan George, who plays Amy, is
one of the most appealing and
sexy new figures to have emerged
recently on the screen. As for
Hoffman, he continues to assert
himself as a most competant
young character actor, injecting
welcome elements of humor and
even betraying the temptation to
which many Americans yield of
awkwardly attempting British
speech patterns, both out of
respect and the impulse to
conform.
Even considering the cuts
made, the film's climatic seige is a
model of photography and
editing. The violence, however
gruesome, is memorable, notably
the moment when the most oafish
and offensive attacker manages to
blow his foot off with a shotgun.
In retrospect, the plot seems a bit
single-minded, the
characterizations of the peripheral
characters a bit crude and even
the detailing of the leads'
relationship somewhat uneasy.
Nonetheless, with most of the
"American original" directors
now either dead or largely
inactive, it is reassuring to see a
strong American artist asserting
himself so forthrightly. Like
Hemingway, Peckinpah may at

times be unpleasant and express a
moral code which may be
unfashionable and objectionable,
but when he strides upon the
scene his very forcefulness makes
him impossible to dismiss or
ignore.

Showing tonight in Cubberley
is Gillo Pontecorvo's excellent
documentary-like recreation of
the French-Algerian conflict,
"Battle of Algiers." During its
initial run in New York, black
militants reportedly viewed the
film repeatedly to learn battle
tactics â€” the mood of the
Stanford audience after the 7:30
and 9:30 screenings is, at this
point, fairly easy to guess.
Antonioni's "L'awentura" was
hailed as a masterpiece when
released but has since been found
to be a colossal bore by many
viewers, myself included.
However, it will be shown at no
charge on Wednesday at 7:30 in
Geology 320, so this may be your

least irksome opportunity to see
it.
v The first half of Leni
Reifenstahl's brilliant epic
"Olympiad" will be shown by the
International Association on
Thursday at 7:30, also in Geology
320. The film is a comprehensive
and lyrical account of the 1936
Olympic games in Berlin, when
Jesse Owens embarassed Hitler by
sweeping every gold medal in
sight.
"Performance," one of the
weirder films to come out of the
late sixties, will be shown at 7:30
and 9:30 in Cubberley on Friday.
Co-director Nicolas Roeg's
photography is certainly stunning,
as is Mick Jagger's delivery of the
great number, "Memo to Turner."
This Sunday's Flick is 'The
Andromeda Strain." Though it is
rated G, the ads advise that it
"may be too intense for younger
children." Attend at your own
risk.

man's world and he probably
couldn't care less about feminist
(or any other) rhetoric. The
depiction of rape on the screen by
no means defines a director as
anti-woman but what provokes
some doubt is the response with
which Peckinpah endows the
woman. Hoffman's wife clearly
teases the men working around
the house and though terrified of
the rapist, doesn't offer an
exceptional amount of resistance

and can even be said to show
some signs of enjoying the
experience.
Indeed, it remains unclear as to
whether she ever mentions the

there can't be any doubt is that
Susan George, who plays Amy, is
one of the most appealing and
sexy new figures to have emerged
recently on the screen. As for
Hoffman, he continues to assert
himself as a most competant
young character actor, injecting
welcome elements of humor and
even betraying the temptation to
which many Americans yield of
awkwardly attempting British
speech patterns, both out of
respect and the impulse to

Even considering the cuts

model of photography and
editing. The violence, however
gruesome, is memorable, notably
the moment when the most oafish

blow his foot off with a shotgun.
In retrospect, the plot seems a bit
single-minded, the

characters a bit crude and even
the detailing of the leads'

"American original" directors
now either dead or largely
inactive, it is reassuring to see a
strong American artist asserting
himself so forthrightly. Like

moral code which may be
unfashionable and objectionable,
but when he strides upon the

him impossible to dismiss or

v The first half of Leni
Reifenstahl's brilliant epic
"Olympiad" will be shown by the

and lyrical account of the 1936
Olympic games in Berlin, when
Jesse Owens embarassed Hitler by
sweeping every gold medal in

"Performance," one of the
weirder films to come out of the
late sixties, will be shown at 7:30

Any critical comments I could
offer about "Straw Dogs" might
seem irrelevant in face of the fact
that it was this film that the
Stanford football team saw the
night before it went on to win its
second Rose Bowl game in a row.
It is certainly a marvellous
coincidence and perhaps poetic
justice that the Michigan team saw
"The Wild Bunch," for not only is
"Straw Dogs" a slightly better
film but any film critic, especially
Stanford's own, would like to
think that the mighty Thunder
Chickens were at least marginally
inspired by Dustin Hoffman's
successful defense of his own
home against boorish attackers.
Besides, for all the heroism of its
characters, 'The Wild Bunch" is a
film about losers.
"Straw Dogs" may be Sam
Peckinpah's most personal film,
though it can't quite replace "The
Ballad of Cable Hogue" in my
affections as his best. The film has
been cut since it left Peckinpah's
hands, continuing in the worst
tradition of "Major Dundee" and
"The Wild Bunch."
Having shown the film in
October at a San Francisco sneak
preview in its original version,
Cinerama Releasing Company got
scared and pared down the
violence to avoid an X rating
(Warner Brothers reportedly
performed similar surgery on
"Dirty Harry" but doesn't seem
to be suffering commercially with
its X-rated "A Clockwork
Orange").
Some women have reacted
with revulsion to the alleged
anti-woman slant of "Straw Dogs"
and British critics in particular
have lashed out at the film's

extreme violence, maintaining
that such irresponsible actions
simply aren't performed by the
English, "Ryan's Daughter" and
the continuing conflict in Ireland
notwithstanding. The violence of
"Straw Dogs" is certainly
affectingly agonizing but for pure
shock value it can't match that of
"Night of the Living Dead," a film
which features a strikingly similar
climatic situation.
Many of the favorable reviews
of "Straw Dogs" have stressed the
mythic proportions of Dustin
Hoffman's character, that of an
American scholar come to
Cornwall with his beautiful
English wife to escape the
ever-increasing horror of life in
the States. He is, as Peckinpah
sees him, a good American liberal
in the worst sense, not because he
has run away from the problems
of a complex society but because
he carries his spinelessness with
him wherever he goes.
His wife, possessions and
person are respectively threatened
until he is finally forced to
physically defend that which is
most important to him, his house,
his sancutary which defines his
world (and only secondarily, his
wife). It is only the successful
defense of these values which can
define and justify him as a man.
This may sound like
psychological primitivism on
Peckinpah's part, but the director
brings his point home most
compellingly through his excellent
control of the thriller format and
the totally believable modernity

of the Hoffman character.
Peckinpah really doesn't mean for
the viewer to sympathize with or
like the main character, but
Hoffman is more or less the
protagonist by default and at
some spots is treated generously
by the director if only to make
the film work on the basic thriller
level.
Hoffman puts his work before
attentiveness to his wife, disrupts
the natural flow of lovemaking
with her to hang up his clothes
and set the alarm and generally
strives to maintain against all
threats the carefully controlled
comfortable world in which he
has ensconced himself. It is this
aspect of the character that I
think many Americans can
respond to and identify with,
however unwillingly, for
Peckinpah means this
procrastination and cautiousness
to be the character's most
damnable trait.
Thus, at the same time one
feels oneself coming closer to
Hoffman, Peckinpah's implied
scorn and distancing evoke the
uncomfortable realization that
what may be closest to the truth
about many Americans is what
Peckinpah is condemning most
severely.
It may seem curious that
Peckinpah, whose work is so
irrevocably linked with the Old
West, migrated to modem
England to make his most closely
felt statement about America
today. In 'The Wild Bunch" and

"Cable Hogue," Peckinpah
mourned the passing of the
American originals who, through
the force of their personalities and
actions, forged a distinctive
portion of the mythic American
character. Hoffman's character in
"Straw Dogs" is a total wash-out
who doesn't assert himself even
after his pet has been murdered,
his privacy invaded and his wife
raped.
Only when confronted with a
threat to the very core of his
world does he react, and then it is
with such all-out effort and
resourcefulness that it can only be
traced to that bit of courage and
originality that perhaps Peckinpah
hopes is still present, if only
latently, in the American persona.
The American makes his stand
successfully, but one is
nonetheless left with a rather
ambivalent response to his
performance, as if it was the least
he could do.
As for the charge that "Straw
Dogs" is disgustingly anti-woman,
Peckinpah's has always been a
man's world and he probably
couldn't care less about feminist
(or any other) rhetoric. The

English, "Ryan's Daughter" and
the continuing conflict in Ireland
notwithstanding. The violence of
"Straw Dogs" is certainly
affectingly agonizing but for pure
shock value it can't match that of
"Night of the Living Dead," a film
which features a strikingly similar
climatic situation.
Many of the favorable reviews
of "Straw Dogs" have stressed the
mythic proportions of Dustin
Hoffman's character, that of an
American scholar come to
Cornwall with his beautiful
English wife to escape the
ever-increasing horror of life in
the States. He is, as Peckinpah
sees him, a good American liberal
in the worst sense, not because he
has run away from the problems
of a complex society but because
he carries his spinelessness with
him wherever he goes.
His wife, possessions and
person are respectively threatened
until he is finally forced to
physically defend that which is
most important to him, his house,
his sancutary which defines his
world (and only secondarily, his
wife). It is only the successful
defense of these values which can
define and justify him as a man.
This may sound like
psychological primitivism on
Peckinpah's part, but the director
brings his point home most
compellingly through his excellent
control of the thriller format and
the totally believable modernity

of the Hoffman character.
Peckinpah really doesn't mean for
the viewer to sympathize with or
like the main character, but
Hoffman is more or less the
protagonist by default and at
some spots is treated generously
by the director if only to make
the film work on the basic thriller
level.
Hoffman puts his work before
attentiveness to his wife, disrupts
the natural flow of lovemaking
with her to hang up his clothes
and set the alarm and generally
strives to maintain against all
threats the carefully controlled
comfortable world in which he
has ensconced himself. It is this
aspect of the character that I
think many Americans can
respond to and identify with,
however unwillingly, for
Peckinpah means this
procrastination and cautiousness
to be the character's most
damnable trait.
Thus, at the same time one
feels oneself coming closer to
Hoffman, Peckinpah's implied
scorn and distancing evoke the
uncomfortable realization that
what may be closest to the truth
about many Americans is what
Peckinpah is condemning most
severely.
It may seem curious that
Peckinpah, whose work is so
irrevocably linked with the Old
West, migrated to modem
England to make his most closely
felt statement about America
today. In 'The Wild Bunch" and

"Cable Hogue," Peckinpah
mourned the passing of the
American originals who, through
the force of their personalities and
actions, forged a distinctive
portion of the mythic American
character. Hoffman's character in
"Straw Dogs" is a total wash-out
who doesn't assert himself even
after his pet has been murdered,
his privacy invaded and his wife
raped.
Only when confronted with a
threat to the very core of his
world does he react, and then it is
with such all-out effort and
resourcefulness that it can only be
traced to that bit of courage and
originality that perhaps Peckinpah
hopes is still present, if only
latently, in the American persona.
The American makes his stand
successfully, but one is
nonetheless left with a rather
ambivalent response to his
performance, as if it was the least
he could do.
As for the charge that "Straw
Dogs" is disgustingly anti-woman,
Peckinpah's has always been a
man's world and he probably
couldn't care less about feminist
(or any other) rhetoric. The
depiction of rape on the screen by
no means defines a director as
anti-woman but what provokes
some doubt is the response with
which Peckinpah endows the
woman. Hoffman's wife clearly
teases the men working around
the house and though terrified of
the rapist, doesn't offer an
exceptional amount of resistance

and can even be said to show
some signs of enjoying the
experience.
Indeed, it remains unclear as to
whether she ever mentions the
episode to her husband. Of what
there can't be any doubt is that
Susan George, who plays Amy, is
one of the most appealing and
sexy new figures to have emerged
recently on the screen. As for
Hoffman, he continues to assert
himself as a most competant
young character actor, injecting
welcome elements of humor and
even betraying the temptation to
which many Americans yield of
awkwardly attempting British
speech patterns, both out of
respect and the impulse to
conform.
Even considering the cuts
made, the film's climatic seige is a
model of photography and
editing. The violence, however
gruesome, is memorable, notably
the moment when the most oafish
and offensive attacker manages to
blow his foot off with a shotgun.
In retrospect, the plot seems a bit
single-minded, the
characterizations of the peripheral
characters a bit crude and even
the detailing of the leads'
relationship somewhat uneasy.
Nonetheless, with most of the
"American original" directors
now either dead or largely
inactive, it is reassuring to see a
strong American artist asserting
himself so forthrightly. Like
Hemingway, Peckinpah may at

times be unpleasant and express a
moral code which may be
unfashionable and objectionable,
but when he strides upon the
scene his very forcefulness makes
him impossible to dismiss or
ignore.

Showing tonight in Cubberley
is Gillo Pontecorvo's excellent
documentary-like recreation of
the French-Algerian conflict,
"Battle of Algiers." During its
initial run in New York, black
militants reportedly viewed the
film repeatedly to learn battle
tactics â€” the mood of the
Stanford audience after the 7:30
and 9:30 screenings is, at this
point, fairly easy to guess.
Antonioni's "L'awentura" was
hailed as a masterpiece when
released but has since been found
to be a colossal bore by many
viewers, myself included.
However, it will be shown at no
charge on Wednesday at 7:30 in
Geology 320, so this may be your

least irksome opportunity to see
it.
v The first half of Leni
Reifenstahl's brilliant epic
"Olympiad" will be shown by the
International Association on
Thursday at 7:30, also in Geology
320. The film is a comprehensive
and lyrical account of the 1936
Olympic games in Berlin, when
Jesse Owens embarassed Hitler by
sweeping every gold medal in
sight.
"Performance," one of the
weirder films to come out of the
late sixties, will be shown at 7:30
and 9:30 in Cubberley on Friday.
Co-director Nicolas Roeg's
photography is certainly stunning,
as is Mick Jagger's delivery of the
great number, "Memo to Turner."
This Sunday's Flick is 'The
Andromeda Strain." Though it is
rated G, the ads advise that it
"may be too intense for younger
children." Attend at your own
risk.
Any critical comments I could
offer about "Straw Dogs" might
seem irrelevant in face of the fact
that it was this film that the
Stanford football team saw the
night before it went on to win its
second Rose Bowl game in a row.
It is certainly a marvellous
coincidence and perhaps poetic
justice that the Michigan team saw
"The Wild Bunch," for not only is
"Straw Dogs" a slightly better
film but any film critic, especially
Stanford's own, would like to
think that the mighty Thunder
Chickens were at least marginally
inspired by Dustin Hoffman's
successful defense of his own
home against boorish attackers.
Besides, for all the heroism of its
characters, 'The Wild Bunch" is a
film about losers.
"Straw Dogs" may be Sam
Peckinpah's most personal film,
though it can't quite replace "The
Ballad of Cable Hogue" in my
affections as his best. The film has
been cut since it left Peckinpah's
hands, continuing in the worst
tradition of "Major Dundee" and
"The Wild Bunch."
Having shown the film in
October at a San Francisco sneak
preview in its original version,
Cinerama Releasing Company got
scared and pared down the
violence to avoid an X rating
(Warner Brothers reportedly
performed similar surgery on
"Dirty Harry" but doesn't seem
to be suffering commercially with
its X-rated "A Clockwork
Orange").
Some women have reacted
with revulsion to the alleged
anti-woman slant of "Straw Dogs"
and British critics in particular
have lashed out at the film's

extreme violence, maintaining
that such irresponsible actions
simply aren't performed by the
English, "Ryan's Daughter" and
the continuing conflict in Ireland
notwithstanding. The violence of
"Straw Dogs" is certainly

is Gillo Pontecorvo's excellent

Stanford audience after the 7:30

hailed as a masterpiece when
released but has since been found

viewers, myself included.

least irksome opportunity to see
it.
v The first half of Leni
Reifenstahl's brilliant epic
"Olympiad" will be shown by the
International Association on
Thursday at 7:30, also in Geology
320. The film is a comprehensive
and lyrical account of the 1936
Olympic games in Berlin, when
Jesse Owens embarassed Hitler by
sweeping every gold medal in
sight.
"Performance," one of the
weirder films to come out of the
late sixties, will be shown at 7:30
and 9:30 in Cubberley on Friday.
Co-director Nicolas Roeg's
photography is certainly stunning,
as is Mick Jagger's delivery of the

rated G, the ads advise that it
"may be too intense for younger

Any critical comments I could
offer about "Straw Dogs" might
seem irrelevant in face of the fact
that it was this film that the
Stanford football team saw the
night before it went on to win its
second Rose Bowl game in a row.
It is certainly a marvellous
coincidence and perhaps poetic
justice that the Michigan team saw
"The Wild Bunch," for not only is
"Straw Dogs" a slightly better
film but any film critic, especially
Stanford's own, would like to
think that the mighty Thunder
Chickens were at least marginally
inspired by Dustin Hoffman's
successful defense of his own
home against boorish attackers.
Besides, for all the heroism of its
characters, 'The Wild Bunch" is a
film about losers.
"Straw Dogs" may be Sam
Peckinpah's most personal film,
though it can't quite replace "The
Ballad of Cable Hogue" in my
affections as his best. The film has
been cut since it left Peckinpah's
hands, continuing in the worst
tradition of "Major Dundee" and
"The Wild Bunch."
Having shown the film in
October at a San Francisco sneak
preview in its original version,
Cinerama Releasing Company got
scared and pared down the
violence to avoid an X rating
(Warner Brothers reportedly
performed similar surgery on
"Dirty Harry" but doesn't seem
to be suffering commercially with
its X-rated "A Clockwork
Orange").
Some women have reacted
with revulsion to the alleged
anti-woman slant of "Straw Dogs"
and British critics in particular
have lashed out at the film's

extreme violence, maintaining
that such irresponsible actions
simply aren't performed by the
English, "Ryan's Daughter" and
the continuing conflict in Ireland
notwithstanding. The violence of
"Straw Dogs" is certainly
affectingly agonizing but for pure
shock value it can't match that of
"Night of the Living Dead," a film
which features a strikingly similar
climatic situation.
Many of the favorable reviews
of "Straw Dogs" have stressed the
mythic proportions of Dustin
Hoffman's character, that of an
American scholar come to
Cornwall with his beautiful
English wife to escape the
ever-increasing horror of life in
the States. He is, as Peckinpah
sees him, a good American liberal
in the worst sense, not because he
has run away from the problems
of a complex society but because
he carries his spinelessness with
him wherever he goes.
His wife, possessions and
person are respectively threatened
until he is finally forced to
physically defend that which is
most important to him, his house,
his sancutary which defines his
world (and only secondarily, his
wife). It is only the successful
defense of these values which can
define and justify him as a man.
This may sound like
psychological primitivism on
Peckinpah's part, but the director
brings his point home most
compellingly through his excellent
control of the thriller format and
the totally believable modernity

of the Hoffman character.
Peckinpah really doesn't mean for
the viewer to sympathize with or
like the main character, but
Hoffman is more or less the
protagonist by default and at
some spots is treated generously
by the director if only to make
the film work on the basic thriller
level.
Hoffman puts his work before
attentiveness to his wife, disrupts
the natural flow of lovemaking
with her to hang up his clothes
and set the alarm and generally
strives to maintain against all
threats the carefully controlled
comfortable world in which he
has ensconced himself. It is this
aspect of the character that I
think many Americans can
respond to and identify with,
however unwillingly, for
Peckinpah means this
procrastination and cautiousness
to be the character's most
damnable trait.
Thus, at the same time one
feels oneself coming closer to
Hoffman, Peckinpah's implied
scorn and distancing evoke the
uncomfortable realization that
what may be closest to the truth
about many Americans is what
Peckinpah is condemning most
severely.
It may seem curious that
Peckinpah, whose work is so
irrevocably linked with the Old
West, migrated to modem
England to make his most closely
felt statement about America
today. In 'The Wild Bunch" and

"Cable Hogue," Peckinpah
mourned the passing of the
American originals who, through
the force of their personalities and
actions, forged a distinctive
portion of the mythic American
character. Hoffman's character in
"Straw Dogs" is a total wash-out
who doesn't assert himself even
after his pet has been murdered,
his privacy invaded and his wife
raped.
Only when confronted with a
threat to the very core of his
world does he react, and then it is
with such all-out effort and
resourcefulness that it can only be
traced to that bit of courage and
originality that perhaps Peckinpah
hopes is still present, if only
latently, in the American persona.
The American makes his stand
successfully, but one is
nonetheless left with a rather
ambivalent response to his
performance, as if it was the least
he could do.
As for the charge that "Straw
Dogs" is disgustingly anti-woman,
Peckinpah's has always been a
man's world and he probably
couldn't care less about feminist
(or any other) rhetoric. The
depiction of rape on the screen by
no means defines a director as
anti-woman but what provokes
some doubt is the response with
which Peckinpah endows the
woman. Hoffman's wife clearly
teases the men working around
the house and though terrified of
the rapist, doesn't offer an
exceptional amount of resistance

and can even be said to show
some signs of enjoying the
experience.
Indeed, it remains unclear as to
whether she ever mentions the
episode to her husband. Of what
there can't be any doubt is that
Susan George, who plays Amy, is
one of the most appealing and
sexy new figures to have emerged
recently on the screen. As for
Hoffman, he continues to assert
himself as a most competant
young character actor, injecting
welcome elements of humor and
even betraying the temptation to
which many Americans yield of
awkwardly attempting British
speech patterns, both out of
respect and the impulse to
conform.
Even considering the cuts
made, the film's climatic seige is a
model of photography and
editing. The violence, however
gruesome, is memorable, notably
the moment when the most oafish
and offensive attacker manages to
blow his foot off with a shotgun.
In retrospect, the plot seems a bit
single-minded, the
characterizations of the peripheral
characters a bit crude and even
the detailing of the leads'
relationship somewhat uneasy.
Nonetheless, with most of the
"American original" directors
now either dead or largely
inactive, it is reassuring to see a
strong American artist asserting
himself so forthrightly. Like
Hemingway, Peckinpah may at

times be unpleasant and express a
moral code which may be
unfashionable and objectionable,
but when he strides upon the
scene his very forcefulness makes
him impossible to dismiss or
ignore.
