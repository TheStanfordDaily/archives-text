# New German Campus Opens In Cologne
## 
### 
If you plan to attend an
overseas campus, you might
consider the program currently
being proposed by the
Department of German Studies.
Beginning in the Spring of
1972, students will have the
opportunity to attend the
Universities of Cologne and Bonn.
They will be enrolled
simultaneously at Stanford (for
two quarters) and fully
matriculated at the University of
Cologne (for one semester) with
permission to attend lecturers and
seminars at the nearby University
of Bonn as well.
The regular Cologne and Bonn
courses will be complemented by
Stanford colbquia and tutorials.
Students will, normally, receive
fifteen units of credit per quarter
for completed course work. This
program will be open to advanced
students majoring in German
Studies or related fields in the
Humanities and Social Sciences.
However, anyone who has
completed at least two years of
German and passes a language
examination, is eligible for the
program.

Not more than fifteen students
at a time will be allowed to attend
each session abroad. According to
program coordinator, Joschi
Hutschneider, "This small number
of students will keep our
community small. There will be
no group structure and students
will live in German dorms or
private homes. I serve them
simply as an advisor."
The Department of German
Studies and the Overseas
Campuses Office are jointly
sponsering the Cologne-Bonn
Program. Participants will pay
normal tuition, room and board
fees for two Stanford Quarters,
and on March 21, 1972, Stanford
will provide students with
transportation from San Francisco
to Cologne as well as room, board,
local transportation in Cologne
and Bonn, course fees at the
Universities of Cologne and Bonn
and additional considerations
while in Germany.
Dr. Edgar Lohner, German,
Department Chairman,
emphasized that the new program
will not only offer better
professors, but "The substance of

our program here at Stanford will
be enhanced: Cologne certainly
offers a more friendly atmosphere
for Americans than Hamburg, and
generally speaking, the city will
do much more for our students
than Hamburg did."
The Cologne-Bonn program
could very possibly expand into
an exchange program, whereby
students and faculty from
Cologne would come to Stanford.

The deadline for applying to
the 1972 Bonn-Cologne Program
is December 10. If you wish tc
inquire further about the
program, contact Mr. Joschi
Hutschneider Department of
German Studies 321-2300, ext.

the overseas campuses in Austria
and Germany might be especially
interested.
