# Mexico City Program Offered
## 
### 
The Center for Latin American Studies and the Overseas Campuses
Office are sponsoring a two-quarter academic program in Mexico City.
The program emphasizes the social sciences and the humanities in
conjunction with one-quarter of language training.
Each undergraduate will plan his own course of study, which
includes work at institutions at El Colegio de Mexico, La Escuela
Nacional de Antropologia Historica, and La Universidad Autonoma de
Mexico.
Extensive travel in Mexico is considered to be an integral part of
the program; last year's group visited Oaxaca and Yucatan.
Applicants must be at least in their sophomore year and are
expected to have completed second-year Spanish before going.
Applications are available from the Overseas Campuses Office or the
Department of Spanish and Portuguese and are due January 31.
Contact Margaret Herlin, ext. 4444 for more information.
