# Local TV Experiment
## Public Service Policy Change 
### DAN BRENNER News Analysis 
In 1969 the Supreme Court
held in the historic "Red Lion
Broadcasting Co." case that "It is
the right of the viewers and
listeners, not the right of the
broadcasters which is
paramount." -
More than two years later the
impact of that ruling is being
strongly felt in three San
Francisco-Bay Area television
stations—Oakland's KTVU (2),
San Francisco's KGO (7), and San
Jose's KNTV (11). Next week
controversial public service
announcements (PSA's) 50-second
speeches by spokesmen covering a
wide range of previously taboo
TV topics—will be aired by these
stations in what is the first
commercial attempt for public
access in the formerly milquetoast
area of PSA's.
Agreements were worked out
with the stations by the
Committee for Open Media
(COM), a group of students and
teachers from San Jose State,
Stanford, and Berkeley interested
in the emerging field of the First
Amendment's right of free access.
The Stanford group,
coordinated through two SWOPS I
courses, has been instrumental in
working with KGO-TV, the
strongest of the stations, to agree
to the experiment. The
ABC-owned station will offer
fifteen minutes per week for five
50-second messages that will be
aired three times each. Seven
spots will be in prime time.
New Open Door
For community groups or
individual citizens who have had
something to say but who have
been afraid that it was too
controversial for the usual puree
blandness that is synonymous
with most commercial television,
the experiment means a new open
door to the public forum.
In fact controversy, an area
broadcasters previously wouldn't

touch with a ten-foot TV antenna,
has become more acceptable as
citizens have successfully
challenged stations' ban on
touchy but relevant topics.
The big change came late last
summer in two decisions. The
Businessmen's Executive Move, a
San Erancisco-based anti-war
activist group, successfully
challenged a network's refusal to
sell them air time for controversial
commercials, in the Fifth Circuit
Appeals Court in Washington,
D.C.
Not long after that
breakthrough, the Friends of the
Earth won the right to rebut
pollution claims of a major oil
company, appealing to their right
of responsible reply guaranteed by
the Fairness Doctrine.
Controversy had not only become
acceptable, but could be
presented free of charge, in some
circumstances.
Using such court decisions as a
guide and an encouragement
COM, directed by Professor
Phillip Jacklin of San Jose State
College, convinced three of the
Bay area's five broadcasters that
controversial public service
messages would benefit people in
tiie community who had

something to say but had no place
in televisionland to say it.
Many Applicants
KTVU's lan Zellick, who is
coordinating announcement
requests for the Cox
Broadcasting-owned Oakland
outlet, reports, that while requests
were small for the first few weeks
of the project, they are now
receiving large numbers of letters
asking for a chance to speak up on
important issues. KGO says that
they had a thick file of applicants.
Jeff Parks, public affairs
director of San Jose's KNTV, an
ABC-affiliate, said that on-the-air
promotion for his station will
commence this week. Already he
has received requests from a wide
array of political and social groups
who have had only slight public
exposure if any.
There are a number of reasons
why these stations have come
forward in supporting the
presentation of controversial
public opinion on their channel.
First, other communities are also
beginning to provide access. In
New York City, Tele Prompter,
the city's major cablecaster, has
set aside one of its channels for
the public to present controversial
or community opinion. And in
Boston, WGBH, the prestigious

educational station, is running a
program which gives full half-hour
exposure to organizations such as
the Black Panthers and women's
activist groups.
Redefined Responsibility
Also as public groups begin to
complain about the
entertainment-dominated nature
of prime time programming,
broadcaster responsibility has
become in part defined in terms
of how much programming geared
to local problems is presented.
Furthermore, through the
citizen-oriented decisions of the
Fifth Circuit Court, whose
jurisdiction includes Federal
Communications Commission
rulings, uninhibited and robust
exchanges of opinion has been
promulgated as licensing Brownie
points for stations.
Individuals or groups in the
area who wish to take advantage
of their new powers of access can
contact the public affairs directors
of KGO, KNTV, or KTVU. In
addition, two other San Francisco
stations—KPlX (5), and KRON
(4)— although they have not
formally agreed to present the
announcements, report that they
also will accept requests for air
time to present messages. The
time for talking has begun.

*VAKE UP!—Bay Area television may be enlivened a bit in the near
future when three of the five local VHP stations begin broadcasting
public service announcements about controversial subjects made by
various community groups. KTVU (2), KGO (7 ), and KNTV (11) will
be the three stations doing this and KRON (4) and KPIX (5) while not
formally agreeing to present the announcements, have reported they
will accept requests.
