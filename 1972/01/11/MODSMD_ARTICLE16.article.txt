Pakistan Sheik Returns
DACCA — Sheik Mujibur Rahman came home
weeping with emotion yesterday and told his
Bangladesh people their ties with Pakistan were
gone forever.
Hundreds of thousands turned out to welcome
him as Bangladesh's first president. A U.S. diplomat
joined the official reception.
In a 15-minute speech at the Dacca
racecourse—the same place where the Bengali leader
launched a civil disobedience campaign against
Pakistani rule last March 7-the 51-year-old sheik
publicly rejected appeals by President Zulfikar Ali
Bhutto of Pakistan that Bangladesh remain within
Pakistan.
The racecourse also was the site of the surrender
Dec. 15 of Pakistani troops in what was then East
Pakistan.
Amid thunderous applause, the Sheik declared:
"I tell the people of Pakistan: You be happy.
You are not responsible for what your army has
done in my country. But I regret it is no longer
possible for Bangladesh to remain with Pakistan.
The links are broken."
And he warned: "If Pakistan should embark on
any adventures, at the bidding of any power, we will
not allow it to succeed."
The sheik called for an international tribunal to
inquire into atrocities he said had been committed
by Pakistani forces in Bangladesh and against
Bengalis in West Pakistan.
But the sheik said that persons living in his
nation who are guilty of having aided the Pakistani
forces would be dealt with by the laws of
Bangladesh.
Police, Blacks Killed
BATON ROUGE, La. - Two deputy sheriffs and
two young black demonstrators were killed
yesterday in an exchange of shots in a
predominantly black area, police said. The gunfire
reportedly began shortly after noon when young
blacks blocked area streets with cars bearing
out-of-state license tags and told residents: "We're
here to give you your city back."
Mayor W.WT "Woody" Dumas said five police
officers as well as the city's chief of police had been
beaten badly when police attempted to move the
barricades. The mayor said the incident apparently

stemmed from the arrest of two or three Black
Muslims seized while soliciting funds last week
without a license.
"They're talking about taking over our city,"
Dumas said. "We're clearing the deck and we're
ready to take them on."
The last count from police on those injured
totaled 20, including newsmen Bob Johnson and
Maurice Cockerham, both of WBRZ-TV in Baton
Rouge.
Eight black men were charged Monday night
with the murder of the two sheriff's deputies after
authorities had run ballistics tests on weapons seized
at the scene, the sheriff's department said.
The eight were among 20 blacks arrested at the
site of the gun battle and initially booked on
charges of disturbing the peace.
Dumas imposed a 5:30 p.m. citywide curfew to
last until 6 a.m. today, and governor John
McKeithen called out state police and National
Guardsmen.
Humphrey Declares
PHILADELPHIA, Pa. — Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey
formally announced yesterday that he will try again
for the presidency. He promised to end the war in
Indochina and said that if he had been elected in
1968, U.S. involvement in the fighting would be
over by now.
The Minnesota Senator made the announcement
in Philadelphia, where he entered the Pennsylvania
Democratic primary and joined a long list of other
candidates in that contest.
Humphrey, 61, who lost to John F. Kennedy in a
bid for the 1960 Democratic presidential
nomination and was defeated by Richard M. Nixon
four years ago, said America needs "leadership and
vision . . . renewed faith in itself."
He added, "A nation that developed a Marshall
Plan to rebuild Europe can develop another to
rebuild our neighborhoods and crime-ridden
cities . . . Our task is reconciliation, rebuilding and
rebirth."
Humphrey joined a long list of Democratic
candidates in Pennsylvania. Also filing in that
contest Monday were Sens. Edmund S. Muskie of
Maine, George S. McGovern of South Dakota,
Vance Hartke of Indiana, and Henry M. Jackson of
Washington; U.S. Rep. Shirley Chisholm of New
York and Alabama Gov. George C. Wallace, a third
party candidate in 1968. Mayor John V. Lindsay of

New York and former Sen. Eugene J. McCarthy of
Minnesota had entered the primary earlier.
Patchen Dies
PALO ALTO, Calif. — The ashes of poet Kenneth
Patchen, widely considered one of the major voices
in American poetry, will be strewn over the Pacific
Ocean.
His widow, Miriam Patchen, said the family was
planning no memorial services for the 60-year-old
Patchen, who died at his small home here Saturday
of a heart attack.
A native of Niles, Ohio, Patchen wrote
constantly from his youth until shortly before his
death—his poetry ranging from satire to lyricism.
He first published in the 1930s but his works
became far better known in the 1950s when he
began reading to jazz accompaniment.
Though his fame often was associated with San
Francisco's Beat Generation of the 19505, Mrs.
Patchen said: "He despised it, though he never raged
about it like I did."
Patchen attended the University of Wisconsin,
was a Guggenheim Fellow in 1936, and in 1967 the
National Foundation of Arts and Humanities
awarded him $10,000 for "lifelong contributions to
American Letters."
Saigon Attacked
SAIGON — A Viet Cong squad bombed a
government office and wounded seven militiamen
with gunfore yesterday after slipping past defenses
at a hamlet on thy outskirts of Saigon.
It was the closest enemy attack to the South
Vietnamese capital since a sapper blew up tons of
ammunition near Tan Son Nhut air base Sept. 19.
The hamlet lies six miles west of downtown Saigon.
Sources said some of the terror bombers
apparently were wounded during a gunfight with
the militiamen.
Other terrorists damaged two U.S. 852 bombers
in a raid on the Utapao air base in southern
Thailand. The attack appeared to be a response to
continuing operations by the 852s against enemy
supply lines in Cambodia, northeastern Laos and
along the Ho Chi Minh trail.
Despite the assault, the U.S. Command said
Monday's missions by the eight-engine
Strato fortresses were not disrupted.
Hughes' Voice Disputed
NEW YORK — Clifford Irving, the man publisher
McGraw-Hill says collaborated with Howard Hughes
in a forthcoming autobiography, said Monday that
the voice heard by seven reporters last Friday in a
telephoned news conference was not that of the
elusive billionaire.
"It is definitely my opinion that was not Howard
Hughes talking," Irving said in reference to a taped,
2'/2-hour long-distance telephone call between a man
introduced as Hughes and the seven reporters.
On the other hand, Harold McGraw Jr., president
of McGraw-Hill, said he believed the voice heard by
newsmen in Los Angeles was indeed that of Hughes.
"My only thought is that he Hughes talked too
openly," McGraw said. "Some of his advisers must
have advised him on the damaging aspects of the
information as far as his business and personal life is
concerned."
McGraw also said the publishing company was
"absolutely convinced of the authenticity of this
book and that the documentation we have contains
the signature of Howard Hughes.
"Clifford Irving has our full confidence. I've
known Irving for a long time. McGraw-Hill has
published three of his books."
McGraw said his company has a nine-page
handwritten letter from Hughes containing "full
authorization" for the manuscript and Hughes'
personal instructions. He held up for photographers
two photostats of checks endorsed by "H. R.
Hughes."
