# Defense Ban Proposed

Palo Alto City Councilwoman Enid
Pearson told a group of 25
Venceremos members at last night's
Council meeting that a proposal to ban
defense contractors from the city was
a "valid question" and promised to
put it on the agenda for next
Monday's meeting.
The promise came after Jim Shoch,
a former Stanford student acting as a
group spokesman, offered a resolution
asking for a report from the city
attorney "regarding the possibilities of
drafting laws and/or employing city
zoning laws to prohibit any
corporation which receives funding
from the United States Department of
Defense from establishing new
operations and/or facilities in Palo
Alto."
Councilman John Berwald
responded by calling the proposal "the
most empty presentation I have heard
in this Council chamber." He said it
was "unsupportable."
Mayor Kirke Comstock cut off
further attempts at rebuttal, pointing
out that the matter should be debated
at Monday's meeting of the Council.
"Using city laws to keep war
industry out of Palo Alto would
constitute a major blow against the
war and against U.S. imperialism in
general," said Shoch, reading quickly
from a prepared text to introduce the
resolution.
He pointed out that many firms
with large defense contracts locate in
the Palo Alto area to take advantage of
the "scientists and facilities" available
at Stanford and the Stanford Research

Institute, and called the Midpeninsula
a "hub" of defense activity, "second
only to the Boston-Cambridge area as
a center for weapons research."
Shoch's 15-minute presentation was
followed by a brief speech from
hospital worker John Dolly, another
Venceremos member, who told the
120 spectators that "the main reason
for this has to do with something else
going on in town this week (besides
the war). The big news is that Bruce
Franklin lost his job.
"It was not a question of tenure or
academic freedom," Dolly said,
intently addressing the nine Council
members and the audience. "The
reason Bruce was fired is that he's a
very, very effective organizer, a very,
very effective leader, a very, very
effective teacher about the U.S. role in
southeast Asia."
He was followed by a quick
presentation from Ed Jackson, a
member of the Stanford War Crimes
Study Group, who said that American
actions in Vietnam are in violation of
several war crimes agreements signed
by the United States. He suggested
that Palo Alto might examine its role
in the war to see if it might be
complicity in war crimes as well.
The next one in the lineup of
speakers was Shiela Harper, who
identified herself as a "worker in the
war industry." She called defense
contractors "sweatshops,"
"union-busters," "racists," and said
that "a number of us in the war
industry support Stanford students
who are fighting war research."

AT THE END OF HIS ROPE?—Or is it just a new high? Maybe he's getting a
good seat for this Sunday's flick. Since this week it's "The Andromeda Strain' it
might not be a bad idea to get there early.
