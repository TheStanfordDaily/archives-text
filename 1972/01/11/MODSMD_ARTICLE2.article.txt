# Protesters Invade Biz School, DoD Recruiters Already Gone
## 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
Over 200 protesters marched into
the Graduate School of Business
(GSB) yesterday to confront
Department of Defense (DoD)
recruiters interviewing students there.
The recruiters could not be found
however, as they had apparently
rescheduled all their interviews for the
morning and had left.
After briefly milling around the
business school, over 100 persons then
marched across campus and through
the Hansen Microwave Laboratories.
The group then held a meeting in the
iab courtyard at which they discussed
the lab's work with researchers there.
Afterwards, they marched to
President Lyman's office and
disbanded.
A rally has been scheduled for
White Plaza today at noon.
Demonstrators Friday evening gave
Lyman until then to rehire English
Professor H. Bruce Franklin, whose
dismissal Lyman has recommended to
the Board of Trustees.
Yesterday's march into the GSB
came after a half-hour rally outside the
building to kick off "Meet The DoD
Week." About 350 persons attended.
The decision to invade the business
school came after DoD recruiters
failed to appear at the rally. A
telegram had been sent to the
recruiters last week asking them to
attend.
Demonstrators outside the building
counted to 10 and then yelled "Come
out, come out, wherever you are."
When the recruiters still failed to
appear, sophomore and Young Crow
Peter Knutson said, "if they don't
come out, we'd better go in."
Once inside, the group was met by
Assistant Dean Gerard Peterson who is
in charge of Placement at the business
school. Peterson told the group
outside his locked office door that the
interviews had been rescheduled and

that the recruiters had done all their
interviews in the morning and had
departed.
Demonstrators then asked Peterson
if they could make sure the DoD
recruiters were not in his office.
"We've already been lied to once
today, when it was publicly
announced that they would be here,"
said one demonstrator. "We want to
make sure they're not lying to us
again."
After one demonstrator searched
Peterson's office, the group left for the
third floor where the interviews were
scheduled to be held. Once again no
recruiters were found.
Peterson told the Daily last night
that the DoD will continue their
interviewing this morning and possibly
this afternoon. Vice-Provost Robert
Rosenzweig said that all the interviews
had been rescheduled by the GSB after
"preliminary conferences" with the
President's office last week.
Rosenzweig added that "everybody
who asked for an interview is getting
one."
Business School Dean Arjay Miller
said last night that he had no comment
about the day's proceedings.
At the rally outside the business
school, Anthony Russo, who has
admitted helping leak the "Pentagon
Papers," told the crowd that "I just
want to emphasize the importance of
exposing government lies, secrecy and
deceit."
Russo added, "I can see why you
want to burn down the goddam
place." But Russo said he wasn't
advocating anything and that he
hadn't crossed any state lines either.
In the most entertaining speech of
the afternoon, Young Crow Lenny
Siegel, dressed in Army fatigues and a
helmet and identifying himself as
Captain Seagull of the Air Force,
displayed "the latest technological
advance," a "gook detector." It was a

heater mounted on a cardboard box
wired to a piece of styrofoam and
headsets.
Siegel said, "All we need is a
volunteer to go over to Vietnam and
plug it in."
After protesters had been unable to
find recruiters inside the business
school in one crowded entranceway,
Columbae resident and "Guest
Professor of Social Thought" Dave
Josephson debated the recruitment
problem with Rosenzweig.
Josephson asked how students
should implement as University policy
their desire that DoD not be allowed
to recruit on campus.
Rosenzweig answered that they
should persuade people not to sign up
for interviews, to which Josephson
responded "why didn't you persuade
people not to go to Bruce Franklin's
class?"
Rosenzweig said that the analogy
was "false and preposterous."
Josephson also asked how the
University had arrived at its moral
decision not to have athletic contests
with Brigham Young University.
Rosenzweig replied this was a different
case since "the players didn't want to
play ball with BYU."
"Well, we don't want to play ball
with DoD," countered Josephson.
Upstairs, protesters were also
meeting, and they finally decided to
march to the Hansen Labs.
As the group arrived clapping and
chanting, Stanford police began
locking doorways. But one protester
got in before one door had been
secured and let everyone else in.
The group then marched through
the lab yelling "investigate to liberate"
and eventually grouped in an open
courtyard.
Several researchers including
Professors Steven Harris and Gordon
Kino debated with the group. The
researchers said that although more

than half of the research in Hansen
was probably DoD funded, most of it
was basic and had civilian applications.
Former Stanford student and
Ramparts magazine contributor Steve
Weissman argued that the researchers
had the "responsibility to see that the
research goes in the right direction."
Siegel said that the problem was
"political and not technological" and
that the researchers had an obligation
to organize themselves actively."
Following the meeting, the group
marched to Lyman's office and gave a
cheer to rehire Franklin. A poster with
a drawing of a Molotov cocktail and
the inscription "Rehire Bruce or no
more truce" was tacked to the door.
Lyman is still in bed with the flu.

people not to go to Bruce Franklin's
class?"
Rosenzweig said that the analogy
was "false and preposterous."
Josephson also asked how the
University had arrived at its moral
decision not to have athletic contests
with Brigham Young University.
Rosenzweig replied this was a different
case since "the players didn't want to
play ball with BYU."
"Well, we don't want to play ball
with DoD," countered Josephson.
Upstairs, protesters were also
meeting, and they finally decided to
march to the Hansen Labs.
As the group arrived clapping and
chanting, Stanford police began
locking doorways. But one protester
got in before one door had been
secured and let everyone else in.
The group then marched through
the lab yelling "investigate to liberate"
and eventually grouped in an open
courtyard.
Several researchers including
Professors Steven Harris and Gordon
Kino debated with the group. The
researchers said that although more

than half of the research in Hansen
was probably DoD funded, most of it
was basic and had civilian applications.
Former Stanford student and
Ramparts magazine contributor Steve
Weissman argued that the researchers
had the "responsibility to see that the
research goes in the right direction."
Siegel said that the problem was
"political and not technological" and
that the researchers had an obligation
to organize themselves actively."
Following the meeting, the group
marched to Lyman's office and gave a
cheer to rehire Franklin. A poster with
a drawing of a Molotov cocktail and
the inscription "Rehire Bruce or no
more truce" was tacked to the door.
Lyman is still in bed with the flu.
Over 200 protesters marched into
the Graduate School of Business
(GSB) yesterday to confront
Department of Defense (DoD)
recruiters interviewing students there.
The recruiters could not be found
however, as they had apparently
rescheduled all their interviews for the
morning and had left.
After briefly milling around the
business school, over 100 persons then
marched across campus and through
the Hansen Microwave Laboratories.
The group then held a meeting in the
iab courtyard at which they discussed
the lab's work with researchers there.
Afterwards, they marched to
President Lyman's office and
disbanded.
A rally has been scheduled for
White Plaza today at noon.
Demonstrators Friday evening gave
Lyman until then to rehire English
Professor H. Bruce Franklin, whose
dismissal Lyman has recommended to
the Board of Trustees.
Yesterday's march into the GSB
came after a half-hour rally outside the
building to kick off "Meet The DoD
Week." About 350 persons attended.
The decision to invade the business
school came after DoD recruiters
failed to appear at the rally. A
telegram had been sent to the
recruiters last week asking them to
attend.
Demonstrators outside the building
counted to 10 and then yelled "Come
out, come out, wherever you are."
When the recruiters still failed to
appear, sophomore and Young Crow
Peter Knutson said, "if they don't
come out, we'd better go in."
Once inside, the group was met by
Assistant Dean Gerard Peterson who is
in charge of Placement at the business
school. Peterson told the group
outside his locked office door that the
interviews had been rescheduled and

that the recruiters had done all their
interviews in the morning and had
departed.
Demonstrators then asked Peterson
if they could make sure the DoD
recruiters were not in his office.
"We've already been lied to once
today, when it was publicly
announced that they would be here,"
said one demonstrator. "We want to
make sure they're not lying to us
again."
After one demonstrator searched
Peterson's office, the group left for the
third floor where the interviews were
scheduled to be held. Once again no
recruiters were found.
Peterson told the Daily last night
that the DoD will continue their
interviewing this morning and possibly
this afternoon. Vice-Provost Robert
Rosenzweig said that all the interviews
had been rescheduled by the GSB after
"preliminary conferences" with the
President's office last week.
Rosenzweig added that "everybody
who asked for an interview is getting
one."
Business School Dean Arjay Miller
said last night that he had no comment
about the day's proceedings.
At the rally outside the business
school, Anthony Russo, who has
admitted helping leak the "Pentagon
Papers," told the crowd that "I just
want to emphasize the importance of
exposing government lies, secrecy and
deceit."
Russo added, "I can see why you
want to burn down the goddam
place." But Russo said he wasn't
advocating anything and that he
hadn't crossed any state lines either.
In the most entertaining speech of
the afternoon, Young Crow Lenny
Siegel, dressed in Army fatigues and a
helmet and identifying himself as
Captain Seagull of the Air Force,
displayed "the latest technological
advance," a "gook detector." It was a

heater mounted on a cardboard box
wired to a piece of styrofoam and
headsets.
Siegel said, "All we need is a
volunteer to go over to Vietnam and
plug it in."
After protesters had been unable to
find recruiters inside the business
school in one crowded entranceway,
Columbae resident and "Guest
Professor of Social Thought" Dave
Josephson debated the recruitment
problem with Rosenzweig.
Josephson asked how students
should implement as University policy
their desire that DoD not be allowed
to recruit on campus.
Rosenzweig answered that they
should persuade people not to sign up
for interviews, to which Josephson
responded "why didn't you persuade
people not to go to Bruce Franklin's
class?"
Rosenzweig said that the analogy
was "false and preposterous."
Josephson also asked how the
University had arrived at its moral

"preliminary conferences" with the
President's office last week.
Rosenzweig added that "everybody
who asked for an interview is getting
one."
Business School Dean Arjay Miller
said last night that he had no comment
about the day's proceedings.
At the rally outside the business
school, Anthony Russo, who has
admitted helping leak the "Pentagon
Papers," told the crowd that "I just
want to emphasize the importance of
exposing government lies, secrecy and
deceit."
Russo added, "I can see why you
want to burn down the goddam
place." But Russo said he wasn't
advocating anything and that he
hadn't crossed any state lines either.
In the most entertaining speech of
the afternoon, Young Crow Lenny
Siegel, dressed in Army fatigues and a
helmet and identifying himself as
Captain Seagull of the Air Force,
displayed "the latest technological
advance," a "gook detector." It was a

heater mounted on a cardboard box
wired to a piece of styrofoam and
headsets.
Siegel said, "All we need is a
volunteer to go over to Vietnam and
plug it in."
After protesters had been unable to
find recruiters inside the business
school in one crowded entranceway,
Columbae resident and "Guest
Professor of Social Thought" Dave
Josephson debated the recruitment
problem with Rosenzweig.
Josephson asked how students
should implement as University policy
their desire that DoD not be allowed
to recruit on campus.
Rosenzweig answered that they
should persuade people not to sign up
for interviews, to which Josephson
responded "why didn't you persuade
people not to go to Bruce Franklin's
class?"
Rosenzweig said that the analogy
was "false and preposterous."
Josephson also asked how the
University had arrived at its moral
decision not to have athletic contests
with Brigham Young University.
Rosenzweig replied this was a different
case since "the players didn't want to
play ball with BYU."
"Well, we don't want to play ball
with DoD," countered Josephson.
Upstairs, protesters were also
meeting, and they finally decided to
march to the Hansen Labs.
As the group arrived clapping and
chanting, Stanford police began
locking doorways. But one protester
got in before one door had been
secured and let everyone else in.
The group then marched through
the lab yelling "investigate to liberate"
and eventually grouped in an open
courtyard.
Several researchers including
Professors Steven Harris and Gordon
Kino debated with the group. The
researchers said that although more

than half of the research in Hansen
was probably DoD funded, most of it
was basic and had civilian applications.
Former Stanford student and
Ramparts magazine contributor Steve
Weissman argued that the researchers
had the "responsibility to see that the
research goes in the right direction."
Siegel said that the problem was
"political and not technological" and
that the researchers had an obligation
to organize themselves actively."
Following the meeting, the group
marched to Lyman's office and gave a
cheer to rehire Franklin. A poster with
a drawing of a Molotov cocktail and
the inscription "Rehire Bruce or no
more truce" was tacked to the door.
Lyman is still in bed with the flu.
Over 200 protesters marched into
the Graduate School of Business
(GSB) yesterday to confront
Department of Defense (DoD)
recruiters interviewing students there.
The recruiters could not be found
however, as they had apparently
rescheduled all their interviews for the
morning and had left.
After briefly milling around the
business school, over 100 persons then
marched across campus and through
the Hansen Microwave Laboratories.
The group then held a meeting in the
iab courtyard at which they discussed
the lab's work with researchers there.
Afterwards, they marched to
President Lyman's office and
disbanded.
A rally has been scheduled for
White Plaza today at noon.
Demonstrators Friday evening gave
Lyman until then to rehire English
Professor H. Bruce Franklin, whose
dismissal Lyman has recommended to
the Board of Trustees.
Yesterday's march into the GSB
came after a half-hour rally outside the
building to kick off "Meet The DoD
Week." About 350 persons attended.
The decision to invade the business
school came after DoD recruiters
failed to appear at the rally. A
telegram had been sent to the
recruiters last week asking them to
attend.
Demonstrators outside the building
counted to 10 and then yelled "Come
out, come out, wherever you are."
When the recruiters still failed to
appear, sophomore and Young Crow
Peter Knutson said, "if they don't
come out, we'd better go in."
Once inside, the group was met by
Assistant Dean Gerard Peterson who is
in charge of Placement at the business
school. Peterson told the group
outside his locked office door that the
interviews had been rescheduled and

that the recruiters had done all their
interviews in the morning and had
departed.
Demonstrators then asked Peterson
if they could make sure the DoD
recruiters were not in his office.
"We've already been lied to once
today, when it was publicly
announced that they would be here,"
said one demonstrator. "We want to
make sure they're not lying to us
again."
After one demonstrator searched
Peterson's office, the group left for the
third floor where the interviews were
scheduled to be held. Once again no
recruiters were found.
Peterson told the Daily last night
that the DoD will continue their
interviewing this morning and possibly
this afternoon. Vice-Provost Robert
Rosenzweig said that all the interviews
had been rescheduled by the GSB after
"preliminary conferences" with the
President's office last week.
Rosenzweig added that "everybody
