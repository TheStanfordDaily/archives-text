# Angela Davis Trial
## Another Venue Change Asked 
### DAVID THIEMANN 
Attorneys for black revolutionary Angela Davis filed a
motion for a second change of venue yesterday with
Judge Richard Arnason of the North Santa Clara County
Superior Court in Palo Alto.
Davis' chief attorney, Howard Moore, Jr., requested
the change to some location other than Santa Clara
County because of the "pervasive and widespread
publicity which the removal of this case to Santa Clara
County has generated and, in particular, the publicity
relative to the costs and expenses for the security, trial,
and detention of the defendant." Projected costs for the
trial now exceed $700,000.
The case was transferred to Santa Clara County from
Marin County after defense attorneys moved for a change
of venue, and recommended to the judge that he choose
San Francisco County. They then appealed his ruling to
the State District Court of Appeals, which rejected their
contention.
The motion yesterday represents another attempt to
move the trial to San Francisco.
Held Without Bail
Davis is now held without bail at North County Jail in
Palo Alto, where she was moved on December 1, 1971. In
Marin she was jailed in a seven foot square cell, and
allowed access to a 10 by 10 foot workroom—in Palo
Alto, she is held in a six by eight foot cell, and allowed
access to another of the same size, which contains an
electric typewriter, radio, and her legal books and papers.
Moore and Franklin Alexander, co-chairman of the
National Committee to Free Angela Davis, have
complained that Davis' cell in Palo Alto is "tiny, cold, and
noisy," but Sheriff James Geary contends that she is
allowed the same privileges as other prisoners, and that

the jail is one of the most modern in the state.
Davis will be transferred to the main county jail in San
Jose for her January 31 trial, according to orders issued
by Presiding Superior Court Judge John Racanelli.
Workmen are now modifying a juvenile cell area for Davis,
at an approximate cost of $165,000.
Racanelli has also ordered elaborate security
precautions for the trial, including new fences, buildings
for body searches, closed circuit television systems for
newsmen and to monitor the courtroom, and metal
detectors.
The case is being prosecuted by Albert Harris, Jr., an
Assistant State Attorney General, who estimates that the
trial will take four to six months. Harris has said he plans
to present about 110 witnesses.
Medical and Dental Tests
Davis was taken to Santa Clara Valley Medical Center
last week for medical and dental tests. When she was
transferred to Santa Clara County, her personal physician.
Dr. Tolbert Small, said she suffered from deteriorating
vision, a sty over her left eye, influenza, and menstrual
problems. Dr. Russell Lee, an eminent Palo Alto
physician, has also attended Davis during her stay at the
Palo Alto jail.
Stanford students have organized a group for the
defense of Davis, and have conducted rallies and
fund-raising activities for her cause. They advocate
removal of the trial to San Francisco, and immediate
release on bail.
Davis has been jailed since October, 1970.
Davis is charged with conspiracy, kidnapping, and
murder in connection with an August 7, 1970 shootout in
a Marin County courthouse parking lot in which four
people died and two were injured.

Marin County after defense attorneys moved for a change
of venue, and recommended to the judge that he choose
San Francisco County. They then appealed his ruling to
the State District Court of Appeals, which rejected their
contention.
The motion yesterday represents another attempt to
move the trial to San Francisco.
Held Without Bail
Davis is now held without bail at North County Jail in
Palo Alto, where she was moved on December 1, 1971. In
Marin she was jailed in a seven foot square cell, and
allowed access to a 10 by 10 foot workroom—in Palo
Alto, she is held in a six by eight foot cell, and allowed
access to another of the same size, which contains an
electric typewriter, radio, and her legal books and papers.
Moore and Franklin Alexander, co-chairman of the
National Committee to Free Angela Davis, have
complained that Davis' cell in Palo Alto is "tiny, cold, and
noisy," but Sheriff James Geary contends that she is
allowed the same privileges as other prisoners, and that

the jail is one of the most modern in the state.
Davis will be transferred to the main county jail in San
Jose for her January 31 trial, according to orders issued
by Presiding Superior Court Judge John Racanelli.
Workmen are now modifying a juvenile cell area for Davis,
at an approximate cost of $165,000.
Racanelli has also ordered elaborate security
precautions for the trial, including new fences, buildings
for body searches, closed circuit television systems for
newsmen and to monitor the courtroom, and metal
detectors.
The case is being prosecuted by Albert Harris, Jr., an
Assistant State Attorney General, who estimates that the
trial will take four to six months. Harris has said he plans
to present about 110 witnesses.
Medical and Dental Tests
Davis was taken to Santa Clara Valley Medical Center
last week for medical and dental tests. When she was
transferred to Santa Clara County, her personal physician.
Dr. Tolbert Small, said she suffered from deteriorating
vision, a sty over her left eye, influenza, and menstrual
problems. Dr. Russell Lee, an eminent Palo Alto
physician, has also attended Davis during her stay at the
Palo Alto jail.
Stanford students have organized a group for the
defense of Davis, and have conducted rallies and
fund-raising activities for her cause. They advocate
removal of the trial to San Francisco, and immediate
release on bail.
Davis has been jailed since October, 1970.
Davis is charged with conspiracy, kidnapping, and
murder in connection with an August 7, 1970 shootout in
a Marin County courthouse parking lot in which four
people died and two were injured.
Attorneys for black revolutionary Angela Davis filed a
motion for a second change of venue yesterday with
Judge Richard Arnason of the North Santa Clara County
Superior Court in Palo Alto.
Davis' chief attorney, Howard Moore, Jr., requested
the change to some location other than Santa Clara
County because of the "pervasive and widespread
publicity which the removal of this case to Santa Clara
County has generated and, in particular, the publicity
relative to the costs and expenses for the security, trial,
and detention of the defendant." Projected costs for the
trial now exceed $700,000.
The case was transferred to Santa Clara County from
Marin County after defense attorneys moved for a change
of venue, and recommended to the judge that he choose
San Francisco County. They then appealed his ruling to
the State District Court of Appeals, which rejected their
