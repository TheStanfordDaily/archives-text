# Hotel Opponents File Referendum In Attempt To Block Holiday Inn
## 
### BOB BACON 
Opponents of a proposed 280-room
hotel development between Stanford
and downtown Palo Alto are
optimistic they have succeeded in
referring the plan to Palo Alto voters
for a final decision, but their efforts
have been clouded by legal
technicalities.
On November 9, the City Council
approved a developer's plans to build a
Holiday Inn on the old Corporation
Yard site just south of University
Avenue, between El Camino and the
railroad tracks. A group led by the
Palo Alto Tenants Union then filed
referendum petitions to put the final
decision in the hands of the voters.
In mid-December they submitted
2805 names, well over the necessary
1650 signatures, but the city attorney
ruled about two-thirds invalid, since
the opponents had not complied with
a law requiring them to register their
intentions with elections officials.
Campaigners filed and circulated
additional petitions last week, and
David Parks, a leader of the petition
drive and a Stanford physics student,
feels that they have succeeded.
Unquestionable
"There shouldn't be any question.
We got about 2000 more names," he
said. He explained that 20 to 30
percent of signatures usually have to
be rejected by elections officials, and
fears the figure will be higher in this
case because of persons who may have
signed one of the earlier valid petitions
as well.
Election officials are in the process
of checking the lists of names, and if

sufficient signatures are obtained, the
City Council will set an election date.
The hotel's backers threatened a
lawsuit after a January 4 City Council
vote to ignore the attorney's ruling
and accept all the earlier petitions.
Attempting to reassert citizen
opposition, Parks' group collected
additional signatures.
If the project is approved, the city
will sublet the 6.7 acre site to the
Pacific Hotel Development Venture, a
San Francisco firm which plans to
construct the $5 million Holiday Inn
Hotel.
Palo Alto leases the land from
Stanford and the lease has 42 more
years until it expires. Under the
University Founding Grant, Stanford
is the perpetual owner of the land and
may not sell it.
From the 1920's until recently,
Palo Alto used the land as a storage
yard for maintenance vehicles and
equipment. The city animal shelter
was also located on the site.
Liberals and Radicals
Opposition to the hotel comes from
liberal "residentialists" including
Mayor Kirke Comstock, and radical
groups such as the Tenants Union.
They object to permitting a private
developer to erect a profit-making
structure on land leased from the city,
and they question the need for a new
hotel. The opponents also charge that
the hotel would increase traffic
volume beyond the capacity of the El
Camino-University interchange built
before World War 11.
At the November 9 council
meeting, opponents suggested possible

uses for the site, including housing for
the elderly or a station for a future
rapid transit line.
Clement Chen, Jr., of the
development firm, last week sent a
letter to all signers of the petition,
asking them to remove their names by
returning an enclosed reply postcard.
In the letter he stressed the revenue
which the project would bring to the
city government and said that
opponents of the plan were trying to
"halt the beautification of your
downtown."
The city would share in profits
from the development under terms of
the lease. The expected revenue for
the city from profits and taxes is
about $250,000 per year.
Like Superblock
The issues are very similar to those
raised by the Bryant Street Project,
also known as Superblock, an office
building complex proposed in 1970
for downtown Palo Alto. On January
26, 1971, voters defeated that
proposal.
The Stanford trustees authorized
the use of the university-owned site
for the hotel project on May 11, 1971.
Last November 9 they approved
schematic architectural plans for the
proposed building.
In a vote of 8-2, the city council
approved the lease last June 14. But
approval of the developer's plans for
the building is still pending. Terms of
the lease require separate approval of
the proposal and the plans before
construction can begin.
Election officials last week reported
that Chen's efforts to have signers
remove their signatures was too late.
They said that once the petitions are
filed with the City Clerk it is too late
for a signer to remove his
endorsement.
Chen has been very critical of the
petition drive, claiming that the
referendum procedure allows "any
small radical group" to halt a major
project. He stated that even if the
project is approved by the voters, the
six-month delay in construction will
cost his firm about $175,000 due to
inflation.
If the voters approve the
development, construction of the
four-story hotel, which will have a red
tile roof and an "Oriental water
garden," must begin within 18 months
and must be within three
irpprc that â€¢- ' v Hio ot
