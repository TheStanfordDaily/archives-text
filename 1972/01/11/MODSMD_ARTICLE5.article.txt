## Implications Of The New Standard 
### 
Joel klein

The majority report in the
Bruce Franklin case is so replete
with misstatements,
misrepresentations and prejudice,
that I am hesitant to single out
one aspect for discussion.
Yet from my perspective, from
the perspective of civil liberties,
the Board's emasculation of the
First Amendment as it is to be
applied at Stanford is the most
troubling implication of an
opinion filled with troubling
implications.
The amount of speech that this
community will allow is relevant
to all of us who are interested in
political events on the Stanford
campus, not just to Bruce
Franklin or other revolutionaries.
The Board claims to be
granting the full protection of the
First Amendment, the same
protection that the Supreme
Court has afforded members of
the general public in Brandenburg
v. Ohio.
But the Board is incorrect in its
application of the First
Amendment standard to the
Franklin speeches, and it had
every reason to know that it was
misapplying the standard. Two
recent California state court cases
involved speeches similar to the
ones delivered by Professor
Franklin.
Dan Siegel, a law student at
Berkeley, when speaking during
the People's Park episode, urged
people to "go down there and
take the Park," a more explicit
call to unlawful action than
anything in Bruce Franklin's
speeches.
At a later time Siegel made
another speech, this time telling
people that "We have to use
whatever force is necessary in
order to make sure this war
stops," and "We have to get
people involved so that we can
really close this University down,
if that's what it takes in order to
make this University stop being
part of the war machine. Then we
have to close it down."
Siegel was prosecuted for both
of these speeches and in both
cases he was acquitted because his

speeches were not incitements.
(Incidentally, for these two
speeches Berkeley placed Siegel
on probation for one year, they
did not dismiss, or even suspend
him. Siegel is now challenging the
probation in federal court.)
The Advisory Board not only
had these cases before it, it also
had Cox v. Louisiana a United
States Supreme Court decision. In
Cox, during a civil rights protest
against segregated lunch counters,
Reverend Cox told his listeners to
go and sit-in at these segregated
counters, a command which was
in violation of state law. The
Supreme Court held that
irrespective of the lawfulness of
the sit-in Reverent Cox's advocacy
was lawful.
Against these cases not one
case has been cited demonstrating
that speeches similar to Professor
Franklin's are not protected by
the First Amendment — not one
case! And the reason that no case
has been cited — either by the
Board or the Administration — is
clear: The First Amendment, as it
was applied by the Supreme Court
in Brandenburg, protects speeches
such as Professor's Franklin's.
There are some who will say
that the above discussion is
irrelevant, that Stanford is a
private institution and that it is
not bound by the dictates of the
United States Constitution. The
validity of that assertion will soon
be tested in court, but the
purpose of the above discussion
was only to show that the Board
was incorrect in asserting that it
gave the same First Amendment
protection as the Supreme Court
would have given under
Brandenburg.
The Board, or President
Lyman, should reconsider the
decision in light of the legal
realities: If the First Amendment
is to be the governing standard at
Stanford, then Professor Franklin
cannot be dismissed for his
speeches — a point made crystally
clear by the American Civil
Liberties Brief.
As I indicated earlier, though,
the major importance of the

Board's decision is not its
misstatement of First Amendment
doctrine, but the implciations of
that misstatement. The reason
that Professor Franklin's speeches
would be protected by the First
Amendment is because they do
not, on their face, urge anything
unlawful. Rather what Professor
Franklin has been told is that even
though he advocated nothing
unlawful, he should have known
that some people would interpret
his speeches to be a call for
unlawful activities.
At a public rally, where
speakers often do not speak from
a prepared text, the speaker can
be careful that he does not
advocate anything illegal. But
certainly, in an emotionally
charged atmosphere, he cannot
know whether someone in his
audience is likely to parcel out a
phrase, or read it out of context,
and understand it as a call to
illegal action.
Thus, after the decision in the
Franklin case people would be
unwise to address a public rally
discussing a charged political
event at Stanford because if
anything unlawful happens after
the speech, the Administration
(in the calm of the
President's office— comb through
the speech to see if any phrases
can be interpreted as some form
of incitement.
Phrases such as "we must fight
repression" or "we must struggle
against University involvement in
the war" or "all power to the
people" could all be turned
against a speaker and viewed as
incitement by the same body that
found the "methods of people's
war" in the context of a call to
return to the dormitories to
heighten consciousness, an
incitement. (In this respect, it is
interesting to note that the Board
never was able to say what
Franklin was inciting to.
Presumably everything that
happened after the Old Union —
legal or illegal — was incited by
Professor Franklin.)
In these circumstances,
circumstances that now exist at

Stanford unless the Franklin
decision is reversed, mass meetings
and public rallies are no longer
viable political pressure tactics.
Instead members of the
community should make an
appointment to see the President
or some other administrator so
that they can reasonably discuss,
in a calm atmosphere their
differences in views.
If the President disagrees, and
we are told reasonable people do
disagree, then at least you've had
a rational discussion and you can
take comfort knowing your views
are being considered. If the
Gamut-H program is deployed in
the mean time, well, at least
violence was avoided.
There are some who think the
model of rational discussion in the
calm of the President's office is
desirable for an academic

community. Maybe in a world
where the university truly is an
ivory tower. thoroughly
disengaged from political issues,
the manner of exchange is
desirable. But ROTC, DoD,
Gamut-Hand a host of other
University involvements
demonstrate that the university is
not an ivory tower.
In order for a community to
discuss and consider political
decisions that directly affect its
life, the Constitution secured the
First Amendment freedoms of
speech, press and assembly. It is
tragic indeed that Stanford no
longer has the same respect for
the members of its community
that the United States
Constitution demands of the state
and national governments.

speeches — a point made crystally
clear by the American Civil
Liberties Brief.
As I indicated earlier, though,
the major importance of the

Board's decision is not its
misstatement of First Amendment
doctrine, but the implciations of
that misstatement. The reason
that Professor Franklin's speeches
would be protected by the First
Amendment is because they do
not, on their face, urge anything
unlawful. Rather what Professor
Franklin has been told is that even
though he advocated nothing
unlawful, he should have known
that some people would interpret
his speeches to be a call for
unlawful activities.
At a public rally, where
speakers often do not speak from
a prepared text, the speaker can
be careful that he does not
advocate anything illegal. But
certainly, in an emotionally
charged atmosphere, he cannot
know whether someone in his
audience is likely to parcel out a
phrase, or read it out of context,
and understand it as a call to
illegal action.
Thus, after the decision in the
Franklin case people would be
unwise to address a public rally
discussing a charged political
event at Stanford because if
anything unlawful happens after
the speech, the Administration
(in the calm of the
President's office— comb through
the speech to see if any phrases
can be interpreted as some form
of incitement.
Phrases such as "we must fight
repression" or "we must struggle
against University involvement in
the war" or "all power to the
people" could all be turned
against a speaker and viewed as
incitement by the same body that
found the "methods of people's
war" in the context of a call to
return to the dormitories to
heighten consciousness, an
incitement. (In this respect, it is
interesting to note that the Board
never was able to say what
Franklin was inciting to.
Presumably everything that
happened after the Old Union —
legal or illegal — was incited by
Professor Franklin.)
In these circumstances,
circumstances that now exist at

Stanford unless the Franklin
decision is reversed, mass meetings
and public rallies are no longer
viable political pressure tactics.
Instead members of the
community should make an
appointment to see the President
or some other administrator so
that they can reasonably discuss,
in a calm atmosphere their
differences in views.
If the President disagrees, and
we are told reasonable people do
disagree, then at least you've had
a rational discussion and you can
take comfort knowing your views
are being considered. If the
Gamut-H program is deployed in
the mean time, well, at least
violence was avoided.
There are some who think the
model of rational discussion in the
calm of the President's office is
desirable for an academic

community. Maybe in a world
where the university truly is an
ivory tower. thoroughly
disengaged from political issues,
the manner of exchange is
desirable. But ROTC, DoD,
Gamut-Hand a host of other
University involvements
demonstrate that the university is
not an ivory tower.
In order for a community to
discuss and consider political
decisions that directly affect its
life, the Constitution secured the
First Amendment freedoms of
speech, press and assembly. It is
tragic indeed that Stanford no
longer has the same respect for
the members of its community
that the United States
Constitution demands of the state
and national governments.

The majority report in the
Bruce Franklin case is so replete
with misstatements,
misrepresentations and prejudice,
that I am hesitant to single out
one aspect for discussion.
Yet from my perspective, from
the perspective of civil liberties,
the Board's emasculation of the
First Amendment as it is to be
applied at Stanford is the most
troubling implication of an
opinion filled with troubling
implications.
The amount of speech that this
community will allow is relevant
to all of us who are interested in
political events on the Stanford
campus, not just to Bruce
Franklin or other revolutionaries.
The Board claims to be
granting the full protection of the
First Amendment, the same
protection that the Supreme
Court has afforded members of
the general public in Brandenburg
v. Ohio.
But the Board is incorrect in its
application of the First
Amendment standard to the
Franklin speeches, and it had
every reason to know that it was
misapplying the standard. Two
recent California state court cases
involved speeches similar to the
ones delivered by Professor
Franklin.
Dan Siegel, a law student at
Berkeley, when speaking during
the People's Park episode, urged
people to "go down there and
take the Park," a more explicit
call to unlawful action than
anything in Bruce Franklin's
speeches.
At a later time Siegel made
another speech, this time telling
people that "We have to use
whatever force is necessary in
order to make sure this war
stops," and "We have to get
people involved so that we can
really close this University down,
if that's what it takes in order to
make this University stop being
part of the war machine. Then we
have to close it down."
Siegel was prosecuted for both
of these speeches and in both
cases he was acquitted because his

speeches were not incitements.
(Incidentally, for these two
speeches Berkeley placed Siegel
on probation for one year, they
did not dismiss, or even suspend
him. Siegel is now challenging the
probation in federal court.)
The Advisory Board not only
had these cases before it, it also
had Cox v. Louisiana a United
States Supreme Court decision. In
Cox, during a civil rights protest
against segregated lunch counters,
Reverend Cox told his listeners to
go and sit-in at these segregated
counters, a command which was
in violation of state law. The
Supreme Court held that
irrespective of the lawfulness of
the sit-in Reverent Cox's advocacy
was lawful.
Against these cases not one
case has been cited demonstrating
that speeches similar to Professor
Franklin's are not protected by
the First Amendment — not one
case! And the reason that no case
has been cited — either by the
Board or the Administration — is
clear: The First Amendment, as it
was applied by the Supreme Court
in Brandenburg, protects speeches
such as Professor's Franklin's.
There are some who will say
that the above discussion is
irrelevant, that Stanford is a
private institution and that it is
not bound by the dictates of the
United States Constitution. The
validity of that assertion will soon
be tested in court, but the
purpose of the above discussion
was only to show that the Board
was incorrect in asserting that it
gave the same First Amendment
protection as the Supreme Court
would have given under
Brandenburg.
The Board, or President
Lyman, should reconsider the
decision in light of the legal
realities: If the First Amendment
is to be the governing standard at
Stanford, then Professor Franklin
cannot be dismissed for his
speeches — a point made crystally
clear by the American Civil
Liberties Brief.

the major importance of the

Joel klein

The majority report in the
Bruce Franklin case is so replete
with misstatements,
misrepresentations and prejudice,
that I am hesitant to single out
one aspect for discussion.
Yet from my perspective, from
the perspective of civil liberties,
the Board's emasculation of the
First Amendment as it is to be
applied at Stanford is the most
troubling implication of an
opinion filled with troubling
implications.
The amount of speech that this
community will allow is relevant
to all of us who are interested in
political events on the Stanford
campus, not just to Bruce
Franklin or other revolutionaries.
The Board claims to be
granting the full protection of the
First Amendment, the same
protection that the Supreme
Court has afforded members of
the general public in Brandenburg
v. Ohio.
But the Board is incorrect in its
application of the First
Amendment standard to the
Franklin speeches, and it had
every reason to know that it was
misapplying the standard. Two
recent California state court cases
involved speeches similar to the
ones delivered by Professor
Franklin.
Dan Siegel, a law student at
Berkeley, when speaking during
the People's Park episode, urged
people to "go down there and
take the Park," a more explicit
call to unlawful action than
anything in Bruce Franklin's
speeches.
At a later time Siegel made
another speech, this time telling
people that "We have to use
whatever force is necessary in
order to make sure this war
stops," and "We have to get
people involved so that we can
really close this University down,
if that's what it takes in order to
make this University stop being
part of the war machine. Then we
have to close it down."
Siegel was prosecuted for both
of these speeches and in both
cases he was acquitted because his

speeches were not incitements.
(Incidentally, for these two
speeches Berkeley placed Siegel
on probation for one year, they
did not dismiss, or even suspend
him. Siegel is now challenging the
probation in federal court.)
The Advisory Board not only
had these cases before it, it also
had Cox v. Louisiana a United
States Supreme Court decision. In
Cox, during a civil rights protest
against segregated lunch counters,
Reverend Cox told his listeners to
go and sit-in at these segregated
counters, a command which was
in violation of state law. The
Supreme Court held that
irrespective of the lawfulness of
the sit-in Reverent Cox's advocacy
was lawful.
Against these cases not one
case has been cited demonstrating
that speeches similar to Professor
Franklin's are not protected by
the First Amendment — not one
case! And the reason that no case
has been cited — either by the
Board or the Administration — is
clear: The First Amendment, as it
was applied by the Supreme Court
in Brandenburg, protects speeches
such as Professor's Franklin's.
There are some who will say
that the above discussion is
irrelevant, that Stanford is a
private institution and that it is
not bound by the dictates of the
United States Constitution. The
validity of that assertion will soon
be tested in court, but the
purpose of the above discussion
was only to show that the Board
was incorrect in asserting that it
gave the same First Amendment
protection as the Supreme Court
would have given under
Brandenburg.
The Board, or President
Lyman, should reconsider the
decision in light of the legal
realities: If the First Amendment
is to be the governing standard at
Stanford, then Professor Franklin
cannot be dismissed for his
speeches — a point made crystally
clear by the American Civil
Liberties Brief.
As I indicated earlier, though,
the major importance of the

Board's decision is not its
misstatement of First Amendment
doctrine, but the implciations of
that misstatement. The reason
that Professor Franklin's speeches
would be protected by the First
Amendment is because they do
not, on their face, urge anything
unlawful. Rather what Professor
Franklin has been told is that even
though he advocated nothing
unlawful, he should have known
that some people would interpret
his speeches to be a call for
unlawful activities.
At a public rally, where
speakers often do not speak from
a prepared text, the speaker can
be careful that he does not
advocate anything illegal. But
certainly, in an emotionally
charged atmosphere, he cannot
know whether someone in his
audience is likely to parcel out a
phrase, or read it out of context,
and understand it as a call to
illegal action.
Thus, after the decision in the
Franklin case people would be
unwise to address a public rally
discussing a charged political
event at Stanford because if
anything unlawful happens after
the speech, the Administration
(in the calm of the
President's office— comb through
the speech to see if any phrases
can be interpreted as some form
of incitement.
Phrases such as "we must fight
repression" or "we must struggle
against University involvement in
the war" or "all power to the
people" could all be turned
against a speaker and viewed as
incitement by the same body that
found the "methods of people's
war" in the context of a call to
return to the dormitories to
heighten consciousness, an
incitement. (In this respect, it is
interesting to note that the Board
never was able to say what
Franklin was inciting to.
Presumably everything that
happened after the Old Union —
legal or illegal — was incited by
Professor Franklin.)
In these circumstances,
circumstances that now exist at

Stanford unless the Franklin
decision is reversed, mass meetings
and public rallies are no longer
viable political pressure tactics.
Instead members of the
community should make an
appointment to see the President
or some other administrator so
that they can reasonably discuss,
in a calm atmosphere their
differences in views.
If the President disagrees, and
we are told reasonable people do
disagree, then at least you've had
a rational discussion and you can
take comfort knowing your views
are being considered. If the
Gamut-H program is deployed in
the mean time, well, at least
violence was avoided.
There are some who think the
model of rational discussion in the
calm of the President's office is
desirable for an academic

community. Maybe in a world
where the university truly is an
ivory tower. thoroughly
disengaged from political issues,
the manner of exchange is
desirable. But ROTC, DoD,
Gamut-Hand a host of other
University involvements
demonstrate that the university is
not an ivory tower.
In order for a community to
discuss and consider political
decisions that directly affect its
life, the Constitution secured the
First Amendment freedoms of
speech, press and assembly. It is
tragic indeed that Stanford no
longer has the same respect for
the members of its community
that the United States
Constitution demands of the state
and national governments.

speeches — a point made crystally
clear by the American Civil
Liberties Brief.
As I indicated earlier, though,
the major importance of the

Board's decision is not its
misstatement of First Amendment
doctrine, but the implciations of
that misstatement. The reason
that Professor Franklin's speeches
would be protected by the First
Amendment is because they do
not, on their face, urge anything
unlawful. Rather what Professor
Franklin has been told is that even
though he advocated nothing
unlawful, he should have known
that some people would interpret
his speeches to be a call for
unlawful activities.
At a public rally, where
speakers often do not speak from
a prepared text, the speaker can
be careful that he does not
advocate anything illegal. But
certainly, in an emotionally
charged atmosphere, he cannot
know whether someone in his
audience is likely to parcel out a
phrase, or read it out of context,
and understand it as a call to
illegal action.
Thus, after the decision in the
Franklin case people would be
unwise to address a public rally
discussing a charged political
event at Stanford because if
anything unlawful happens after
the speech, the Administration
(in the calm of the
President's office— comb through
the speech to see if any phrases
can be interpreted as some form
of incitement.
Phrases such as "we must fight
repression" or "we must struggle
against University involvement in
the war" or "all power to the
people" could all be turned
against a speaker and viewed as
incitement by the same body that
found the "methods of people's
war" in the context of a call to
return to the dormitories to
heighten consciousness, an
incitement. (In this respect, it is
interesting to note that the Board
never was able to say what
Franklin was inciting to.
Presumably everything that
happened after the Old Union —
legal or illegal — was incited by
Professor Franklin.)
In these circumstances,
circumstances that now exist at

Stanford unless the Franklin
decision is reversed, mass meetings
and public rallies are no longer
viable political pressure tactics.
Instead members of the
community should make an
appointment to see the President
or some other administrator so
that they can reasonably discuss,
in a calm atmosphere their
differences in views.
If the President disagrees, and
we are told reasonable people do
disagree, then at least you've had
a rational discussion and you can
take comfort knowing your views
are being considered. If the
Gamut-H program is deployed in
the mean time, well, at least
violence was avoided.
There are some who think the
model of rational discussion in the
calm of the President's office is
desirable for an academic

community. Maybe in a world
where the university truly is an
ivory tower. thoroughly
disengaged from political issues,
the manner of exchange is
desirable. But ROTC, DoD,
Gamut-Hand a host of other
University involvements
demonstrate that the university is
not an ivory tower.
In order for a community to
discuss and consider political
decisions that directly affect its
life, the Constitution secured the
First Amendment freedoms of
speech, press and assembly. It is
tragic indeed that Stanford no
longer has the same respect for
the members of its community
that the United States
Constitution demands of the state
and national governments.
