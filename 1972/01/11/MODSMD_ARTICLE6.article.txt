Free Angela
Editor, THE DAILY:
I would like to submit some
information concerning the plight
of Angela Y. Davis. Angela Davis
has been in confinement now for
well over a year. Yet many people
are blind to the fact that Angela
Davis life is slowly withering
away due to such intense
confinement.
There is reason to believe that
she will be tried in San Jose. San
Jose's population is two percent
Black, almost insuring that Angela
Davis will have an all white jury.
The Board of Supervisors of Santa
Clara County are asking that the
tax payers of Santa Clara County
pay $540,000 for security
measures during Angela's trial.
These same tax payers will
comprise the jury that will judge
Angela Davis.
Reactions to Angela Davis
come as no surprise to me because
in the eyes and judgment of
many Americans she is tried and
convicted before her scheduled

trial date. Angela has three strikes
against her even before she takes
the stand: 1.) she is Black, 2.) she
is a Communist, and 3.) she is a
woman.
Idealistically speaking I would
like to think that all tried under
our system of justice are innocent
until proven guilty, but
realistically speaking, Blacks,
women, and Communists have
suffered under the paradox called
"American Justice". In a majority
of American minds Angela Davis
is not human so it is impossible
for her to be suffering both
mental and physical anguish.
The mental suffering of staying
in a six by eight cell in
confinement for many months,
and the physical suffering of being
denied any medical attention
(despite the fact that she needs an
operation due to her declining
health) plus the fact that she is in
need of oral and optical attention,
is hardly the treatment I would
like to expect for a person who is
innocent until proven guilty.
Because of dehumanization
and conviction, every single
American is affected one way or
another by the racial strife that is
tearing our country asunder from
within.
We must not make any more
pre-convictions. Has not our
country suffered enough from

paradoxical justice, that is
judgment influenced by blind
and misplaced patriotism built
upon half-truths? Then, when we
find out the whole truth we drape
it with the flag and turn the
national anthem up a little louder.
We can no longer cover up the
discrepancies.
Angela Y. Davis needs three
basic things to survive:
1. She needs to be granted bail
2. She needs medical attention
3. She needs to be moved to
San Francisco — the only place
where she has a slim chance of
receiving a fair trial.
I have done extensive research
on the subject. I have met with
Angela Davis' lawyer Howard
Moore, both Co-Chairman of the
National Defense Committee,
Fania Davis and Franklin
Alexander. I have looked into all
aspects of the case and still feel
that several factors need to be
known publicly if Angela Davis is
to receive a fair trial.
I am not seeking division
among the students of Stanford
University. If you are in any way
interested in saving the sister's
life, I would appreciate your
cooperation. We need petitions
filled, phone calls made, doors
knocked on, etc. This is not
intended to hurt any feelings or to
step upon any toes. Angela needs
your help.
Respectfully submitted,
Charles Ogletree

Defense of Angela Davis and All
Political Prisoners)
P.S. There will be a meeting
tonight at 7:30 in the
Roble Hall dining room (A-wing.)
Band Of Hippies!
Editor, THE DAILY:
After watching the Rose
Parade and viewing all the
other "Bowl" games on TV,
may I report that the Stanford
Band stood out like a "sore
thumb"? It looked like a gang
of hippies!
Most of the Stanford alumni
in our group were ashamed of
your band. Is yours so rich a
university that contributions
are no longer needed from
alumni and former friends?
Things have changed—now
the students are taught that
ugly is beautiful, bad is good,
and any kind of discipline is an
undesirable infringement of
personal rights.
Stanford needs a new
Chancellor!

. . . And Bear It
Editor, THE DAILY:
Just a word to all Daily
readers who don't feel that
Franklin's loss is too great a
burden to bear:
'You're by no means alone.'
