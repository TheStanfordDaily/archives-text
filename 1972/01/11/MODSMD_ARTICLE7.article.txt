# firing an employee
## No Reason To Rehire Bruce 
### 
Chris hocker

What have they done to Bruce
Franklin?
Has Stanford violated his First
Amendment rights? Should other
professors be quaking in their
radical-chic boots, not knowing
where the axe will fall next? Is it
true what Bruce said, that there is
nothing more violent than to take
a man's livelihood away from him?
Stanford has cut off his salary,
not his tongue. Franklin can and
will continue to say what he
wants to say. The only difference
is that he must make his money
someplace else. Chances are that
he will be able to find that place
very soon.
What the question boils down
to is this: does an employer have
the right to fire an employee? If
you were the head of a business
firm, and one of your employees
began saying that you were a
dirty, evil, immoral 5.0.8., and
began to convince others that you

were that sort of 5.0.8., and
began to attract a statewide
audience in order to tell them that
you were such an 5.0.8., would
you fire him?
If you did, wouldn't that be
violating his rights? He has the
right to say those things about
you; it's guaranteed under the
law. But he does not have the
right to be employed wherever he
wishes and on his own terms. If he
has that right, then everyone has
that right. This, of course, is
ludicrous — what if everyone
wanted to be an English
professor? What would they eat,
books?
Franklin has tried to keep the
best of both worlds, a
contradiction that has occurred to
many people but which has not
gotten much publicity. If Franklin
is really so outraged at the
workings of Stanford, why has he
held onto his job? Why are his
followers chanting "Rehire
Bruce" when, according to one
Venceremos member, his firing
will "make him a better
communist"?
What do they want, good
communists, or good jobs?
Evidently both; but there is no
reason in the world for Stanford
to rehire Bruce. An employer who
retains an employee who has
made it plain that he will use any

means necessary to change or even
to destroy the business is afflicted
at least with a severe form of
masochism.
Stanford is a business, although
to observe some of the people
passing themselves off as
administrators around here, one
might not believe it. The business
of education should operate
within the framework of the
marketplace just as any business.
The liberalism which permits
the expenditure of thousands of
dollars on a hearing such as
Franklin's only serves as a
detriment to the efficency of the
business. And, just as in the
marketplace, those students and
faculty who are dissatisfied with
Stanford's product may "vote
with their feet" and go elsewhere.
If this type of approach to
education seems crass,
materialistic, and porcine, let me
point out that the attempt to
modify this approach — as
embodied in present-day
Stanford — has resulted in a
perversion of "academic freedom"
to mean the freedom to violate
the rights of others in an academic
setting. The "freedom" to shut
down the university in the name
of a nebulous entity labeled "The
People" is no more of a legitimate
right than the "freedom" to be

employed anywhere one chooses,
on one's own terms.
In Marxist dogma, there is no
dichotomy between mind and
body. Theory must be put into
practice. Therefore, when the
actions of revolution are curtailed,
a Marxist must argue that his ideas
have been likewise curtailed; ergo,
fascism, repression, and denial of
"academic freedom."
The fallacy of this argument is
obvious. Theory alone can violate
no rights, whether it is Marxist,
liberal, conservative, or whatever.
Practice, of course, can result and
has resulted in history's grossest
violations — Stalinist Russia in the
1930's and the Vietnam war are
two recent ones.
For the University to have kept
Franklin would have been to
perpetuate such a violation of
rights, for Bruce has made
unquestionably clear his
participation in and active support
for such actions as have at times
turned Stanford into an armed
camp. Stanford spent vast
amounts of time and money in
order to fire Bruce Franklin. It
had the right to fire him long ago.

What the question boils down
to is this: does an employer have
the right to fire an employee? If
you were the head of a business
firm, and one of your employees
began saying that you were a
dirty, evil, immoral 5.0.8., and
began to convince others that you

were that sort of 5.0.8., and
began to attract a statewide
audience in order to tell them that
you were such an 5.0.8., would
you fire him?
If you did, wouldn't that be
violating his rights? He has the
right to say those things about
you; it's guaranteed under the
law. But he does not have the
right to be employed wherever he
wishes and on his own terms. If he
has that right, then everyone has
that right. This, of course, is
ludicrous — what if everyone
wanted to be an English
professor? What would they eat,
books?
Franklin has tried to keep the
best of both worlds, a
contradiction that has occurred to
many people but which has not
gotten much publicity. If Franklin
is really so outraged at the
workings of Stanford, why has he
held onto his job? Why are his
followers chanting "Rehire
Bruce" when, according to one
Venceremos member, his firing
will "make him a better
communist"?
What do they want, good
communists, or good jobs?
Evidently both; but there is no
reason in the world for Stanford
to rehire Bruce. An employer who
retains an employee who has
made it plain that he will use any

means necessary to change or even
to destroy the business is afflicted
at least with a severe form of
masochism.
Stanford is a business, although
to observe some of the people
passing themselves off as
administrators around here, one
might not believe it. The business
of education should operate
within the framework of the
marketplace just as any business.
The liberalism which permits
the expenditure of thousands of
dollars on a hearing such as
Franklin's only serves as a
detriment to the efficency of the
business. And, just as in the
marketplace, those students and
faculty who are dissatisfied with
Stanford's product may "vote
with their feet" and go elsewhere.
If this type of approach to
education seems crass,
materialistic, and porcine, let me
point out that the attempt to
modify this approach — as
embodied in present-day
Stanford — has resulted in a
perversion of "academic freedom"
to mean the freedom to violate
the rights of others in an academic
setting. The "freedom" to shut
down the university in the name
of a nebulous entity labeled "The
People" is no more of a legitimate
right than the "freedom" to be

employed anywhere one chooses,
on one's own terms.
In Marxist dogma, there is no
dichotomy between mind and
body. Theory must be put into
practice. Therefore, when the
actions of revolution are curtailed,
a Marxist must argue that his ideas
have been likewise curtailed; ergo,
fascism, repression, and denial of
"academic freedom."
The fallacy of this argument is
obvious. Theory alone can violate
no rights, whether it is Marxist,
liberal, conservative, or whatever.
Practice, of course, can result and
has resulted in history's grossest
violations — Stalinist Russia in the
1930's and the Vietnam war are
two recent ones.
For the University to have kept
Franklin would have been to
perpetuate such a violation of
rights, for Bruce has made
unquestionably clear his
participation in and active support
for such actions as have at times
turned Stanford into an armed
camp. Stanford spent vast
amounts of time and money in
order to fire Bruce Franklin. It
had the right to fire him long ago.

What have they done to Bruce
Franklin?
Has Stanford violated his First
Amendment rights? Should other
professors be quaking in their
radical-chic boots, not knowing
where the axe will fall next? Is it
true what Bruce said, that there is
nothing more violent than to take
a man's livelihood away from him?
Stanford has cut off his salary,
not his tongue. Franklin can and
will continue to say what he
wants to say. The only difference
is that he must make his money
someplace else. Chances are that
he will be able to find that place
very soon.
