# rehire franklin by noon
## Extralegal Action Necessary 
###

Richard Lyman has until 12:00 noon today to
reverse his Sunday statement and rehire Bruce
Franklin. If at that time, he has given no indication
that he will move to reinstate Bruce, Stanford
students, faculty, and staff will act.
The division between the pro-war and anti-war
forces on this campus becomes increasingly distinct
as the facade of liberalism is stripped away. Richard
Lyman claims he opposses the War while Stanford
researches and develops the techniques and weapons
necessary for its remote-control prosecution. The
actic j of liberals such as Lyman and the members
of the Advisory Board speak far louder than their
rhetoric.
The "academic freedom" Lyman claims to
protect by firing Franklin, allows Stanford
professors to research new, improved techniques for
mass-killing, to advocate racist sterilization policies,
and to serve local war industry. The misuse of
academic freedom to protect corporate-military
needs and the existence of a wealthy group of war
industrialists (like Arbuckle and Hewlett) serving as
Stanford trustees are not by any means
coincidental.
David Packard's 2.6 million dollar gift to the
University was not donated in the spirit of unselfish
generosity. In the University administration's need
to rid Stanford of radicals and revolutionaries and in
the prostitution of the institution to their own
corporate needs, they violate even their own
professed ideals concerning the mythical "free
university."
It is not the concerned members of the Stanford
community who are causing or have caused
disruption at Stanford. The Advisory Board,
Richard Lyman, and the Stanford administration by
their blatant refusal to recognize even the barest

facts of the Franklin case and by their overtly
political barring of Bruce Franklin from teaching,
have dramatically limited political expression on the
Stanford campus. To fail to respond is to accept an
outrageous escalation of political coercion on an
already repressed campus.
How, then, does one respond to these actions?
What methods of legal redress of grievances have the
Stanford Administration left open? In the past we
have been told to work through committees and
referendums. However, last quarter Richard Lyman
stated that not only did he not await advice from
student committees on the Placement Center issue
but that last Spring's referendum to ban war
recruiters from campus, a duly constituted vote of
the students, would be officially ignored.
Again this year, Lyman ignored a duly
constituted student referendum on the SJC and a
vote of the Student Senate and established his own
"judicial" system, independent of explicitly stated
student desires. Hence we find the traditional
avenues of expression and response — committees,
student government and referendums — denied us.
In other words, extralegal action is the only form of
effective political redress permitted us.
However, no one should be intimidated or
deterred from responding to political coercion by
the absence of legal channels for redress of
grievances on this campus. The primary asset which
the Movement possesses is people willing to act on
their convictions. If Richard Lyman forces us to act
today we shall indeed exercise that power of the
people to achieve the rehiring of Bruce Franklin and
an end to the criminal activities engaged in at
Stanford University.

their blatant refusal to recognize even the barest

facts of the Franklin case and by their overtly
political barring of Bruce Franklin from teaching,
have dramatically limited political expression on the
Stanford campus. To fail to respond is to accept an
outrageous escalation of political coercion on an
already repressed campus.
How, then, does one respond to these actions?
What methods of legal redress of grievances have the
Stanford Administration left open? In the past we
have been told to work through committees and
referendums. However, last quarter Richard Lyman
stated that not only did he not await advice from
student committees on the Placement Center issue
but that last Spring's referendum to ban war
recruiters from campus, a duly constituted vote of
the students, would be officially ignored.
Again this year, Lyman ignored a duly
constituted student referendum on the SJC and a
vote of the Student Senate and established his own
"judicial" system, independent of explicitly stated
student desires. Hence we find the traditional
avenues of expression and response — committees,
student government and referendums — denied us.
In other words, extralegal action is the only form of
effective political redress permitted us.
However, no one should be intimidated or
deterred from responding to political coercion by
the absence of legal channels for redress of
grievances on this campus. The primary asset which
the Movement possesses is people willing to act on
their convictions. If Richard Lyman forces us to act
today we shall indeed exercise that power of the
people to achieve the rehiring of Bruce Franklin and
an end to the criminal activities engaged in at
Stanford University.

Richard Lyman has until 12:00 noon today to
reverse his Sunday statement and rehire Bruce
Franklin. If at that time, he has given no indication
that he will move to reinstate Bruce, Stanford
students, faculty, and staff will act.
The division between the pro-war and anti-war
forces on this campus becomes increasingly distinct
as the facade of liberalism is stripped away. Richard
Lyman claims he opposses the War while Stanford
researches and develops the techniques and weapons
necessary for its remote-control prosecution. The
actic j of liberals such as Lyman and the members
of the Advisory Board speak far louder than their
rhetoric.
The "academic freedom" Lyman claims to
protect by firing Franklin, allows Stanford
professors to research new, improved techniques for
mass-killing, to advocate racist sterilization policies,
and to serve local war industry. The misuse of
academic freedom to protect corporate-military
needs and the existence of a wealthy group of war
industrialists (like Arbuckle and Hewlett) serving as
Stanford trustees are not by any means
coincidental.
David Packard's 2.6 million dollar gift to the
University was not donated in the spirit of unselfish
generosity. In the University administration's need
to rid Stanford of radicals and revolutionaries and in
the prostitution of the institution to their own
corporate needs, they violate even their own
professed ideals concerning the mythical "free
university."
It is not the concerned members of the Stanford
community who are causing or have caused
disruption at Stanford. The Advisory Board,
Richard Lyman, and the Stanford administration by
their blatant refusal to recognize even the barest

facts of the Franklin case and by their overtly
political barring of Bruce Franklin from teaching,
have dramatically limited political expression on the
Stanford campus. To fail to respond is to accept an
