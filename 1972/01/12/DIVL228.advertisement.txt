Statement Concerning Use
Of Memorial Church
Memorial Church is presently the focal point of much attention. Numerous questions are being
raised about the nature of this Church, and the activities permitted within its boundaries. This
statement is an attempt to clarify for the benefit of the Stanford Community the point of view held by
the Church staff and two advisory boards made up of faculty, students and staff, all of whom share
responsibility for the uses of Memorial Church.
1. We affirm that Memorial Church is a place of worship, communion and celebration for
individuals and groups of divergent faiths. It is our opinion that this Church should remain open to all
people. It is our hope that in Memorial Church all may come to understand their particular faith more
clearly, share with others the pursuit of Truth in a peaceful manner, and in the spirit of love and
compassion. We consider this openness essential to the character and well-being of Memorial Church
and believe that the ideals ol community, love and justice give the Church a special quality which
deserves preservation and should not be violated. Individuals and groups wishing to use the Church in
accord with these principles will be welcomed.
2. We think it is necessary that the scheduled activities of the Church be respected. Events which
are established on the Church calendar such as weddings, memorial services, organ lessons and practice,
Mass and University worship services have priority over other assemblies or gatherings. Also, believing
that the Church should be a place for quiet contemplation, prayer or meditation, wc will provide a
place for such activities. The altar area is set aside for use only in worship services.
3. So that the building will not burn down, wc ask people not to smoke in the Church. Also, wc ask
all groups to be responsible for cleaning up after meetings.
