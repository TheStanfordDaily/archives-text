# Protesters Hold Meeting After Buildings Closed
## 
### PHIL REVZIN 
Over 250 demonstrators were
blocked from entering the Hansen
Laboratories by Sheriff's deputies
yesterday afternoon. The group had
marched to Hansen from a noon rally
at White Plaza called to protest the
firing of H. Bruce Franklin and
Defense Department research on
campus.
After an hour meeting in the
Hansen courtyard, about 80
demonstrators met for an hour in the
lobby of the McCullough Electrical
Engineering building. There was no
damage or violence in the building.
Four buildings in the vicinity of
Hansen were also ordered closed
around noon. Vice-Provost for
Research William Massey said that
after consultation, he ordered Hansen,
Electronics Research, Applied
Electronics, Aero and Astro, and the
Computation Center closed at noon.
Stanford police chief Marvin
Herrington said he had requested that
Sheriff's deputies come to the scene
after consultation with Presidential
Assistant John Schwartz.
At the noon rally, attended by over
300 people, Joel Klein, a member of
Franklin's defense team, said that Law
School Professor Anthony Amsterdam
had agreed to aid in Franklin's appeal
to a civil court. Amsterdam was
unavailable for confirmation or
comment last night. Klein added that
Amsterdam would try to help "as
much as his schedule allows."
Klein told the crowd that "an
incitement to oppose the war was not
the same as an incitement to an illegal
act. People at Stanfrod will no longer
be entitled to First Amendment rights
if the Franklin decision stands."
'Revolution Unprotected'
Ramparts contributer Steve
Weissman said that "as long as the
salaries are in the hands of the upper
class, academic freedom will be
tokenism. Revolution is not protected
by the First Amendment."
He added that Universities were
"slowly easing out anti-war and
anti-racist personnel," and said, "We
must come together now for defense,
or years of anti-war work will go down
the drain."
Weissman called for the crowd to
"take the firing of Bruce Franklin and
turn it against the University. We can
create a situation where the anti-war
movement gets bigger. The Trustees
won't rehire Bruce even if 3,000
students burned themselves, let alone
the University."
He closed by saying, "we have to
show the Trustees that there is still
some shit which we will not eat."
Several speakers suggested the
group move to the Hansen laboratories
for a "teach-in." Dave Josephson,
ASSU Guest Professor of Social
Thought, told the group that "our
community is deeply involved in the
war. When Bruce was fired, we were
excluded from legal channels. The
status quo won't let us ask questions,
and we are entitled to know what is
happening in places like the electronics
' a^S Teach-in Voted
The group voted to hold a teach-in
at Hansen, and about 300 people
moved slowly from White Plaza,
through the Quad, chanting briefly.
They were greeted at the door of
Hansen by 11 riot-equipped Sheriff's
deputies.
Josephson told the crowd that
"nothing illegal has happened, and
there is no reason why we shouldn't go
in."
Stanford police chief Marvin
Herrington spoke to the group, saying
the lab had "been closed for the day."
Signs on the door said that "persons
on official University business" could
enter through a side door.
The lab had been closed about 30
minutes before the crowd arrived.
Presidential Assistant John Schwartz

said that most of the buildings were
closed "around noon."
Schwartz told the Daily that
"indications today were that there was
a threat to building used primarily for
research. No buildings were closed in
which classes were held."
However, reporters watched as a
professor looked into his classroom at
Hansen, discovering that none of the
students had shown up for a scheduled
course in that building.
Joint Decision
According to Schwartz, the
decision was made jointly between the
directors of the labs and Massey.
Hansen lab associate Director
Marshall O'Neill said that "it had been
suggested in the morning that I close
the laboratory."

Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Lieutenant Donald Tamm told the
crowd, "We were told by the
University that several labs had been
closed. We cannot allow breaking-in,
or forcible violence."
The crowd stayed away from the
police line, and there were no
incidents.
After a few minutes, about 250
people moved to the open Hansen
courtyard. The group remained there
for about an hour as lab officials and
Sheriff's deputies blocked the doors.
No demonstrators entered Hansen,
and some work continued in the
building, although many employees
watched the demonstration from
windows. Secretary Sue Bennett
