Hang Up
Editor, THE DAILY:
A Stanford Daily reporter
telephoned my home the evening
the decision of the Advisory
Board for the Franklin case was
announced. He asked my opinion
of the matter. I explained that I
had not yet read their statement
as to the basis of the decision so
that I wasn't ready to give a
considered opinion. I did say,
however, that I was surprised at
the five to two decision against
Franklin.
Unfortunately for me, the
conversation didn't end there. The
reporter plied me with
hypothetical questions and
comments in a desperate effort to
get some quotable items.
He read Professor Kennedy's
statement about the corrosive
effect he thought the judgement
against Franklin would have for
one's confidence in tenure as a
protection for academic freedom,
and asked me if 1 subscribed to it.
I said I thought this was true.
Now, however, I find the
statement attributed to me in the
Stanford Daily front page article
(Jan. 6) and furthermore inflected
so that 1 seem to be worried about
my own tenure.
This wouldn't have bothered
me enough to write this letter to
the editor. What does pain me
considerably more is the
statement attributed to me on
page 7 of the same article to the
effect that I had heard from
"some people" that Professor
Kennedy's vote was a political
one.
I did make such a statement in
the course of this labored
interview, but what was left out
of my statement was my
subsequent observation that I
thought such an idea was to
unjustly question the integrity of
Professor Kennedy's vote.
In order not to misconstrue my
position I would like to state here
unequivocally that I do not wish

to impugn the integrity of
Professor Kennedy who
performed the most arduous task
of acting as the chairman of the
Advisory Board through the many
weeks of their deliberations and
indeed whose vote in favor of
Franklin was in accordance with
my own view of the case.
Being quoted out of context,
in the wrong context or with
strategic editing is a peril only too
well-known in professional
journalism. Your Stanford Daily
reporter is getting a running start
on this, and on the basis of this
experience, I can only advise that
when this reporter (one or the
other of them), calls for an
interview, hang up!.
Dwight C. Miller

(Editor's note: The
Daily apoligizes for any
misunderstanding between its
reporter and Professor Miller, but
wishes to protest the manner in
which he typifies their
conversation. Like many faculty
members questioned for reaction
the night that the Franklin
decision was announced, Miller
stated he did not know the details
of the decision. But unlike others,
he did reply to questions about
the implications of the verdict.
The reporter asked, not "plied"
many questions to many people
and was in fact deluged with
quotes from sources rather than
being "desperate" for some.
(No statements were
attributed to Professor Miller
which he himself did not say. Our
reporter maintains that Miller was
not quoted out of context, nor
misquoted. At no point in the
article was he made to seem
critical of Professor Kennedy or
the manner in which he voted.
(Certaily a good reporter will
attempt to elecit response to a
question, especially when two
separate sources state the
individual to be questioned will
have interesting things to say on

the subject. And just as a reporter
is within his/her right to question,
so is a subject within his/her right
to refuse comment.
(We thank Professor Miller for
helpingto clarify his own position
on the Franklin case, but we stand
by our reporter's ethics and
abilities.)
Christian Response
The insights provided in the
excerpts from Dr. Robert McAfee
Brown's Sunday sermon,
published in Monday's Daily,are
ones that are desperately needed
in today's times of trouble. All
those engaged in controversy
would do well to ponder them
carefully.
It is tragic that it is probable
that they will be so little heeded.
Those who are sure of the
righteousness of their cause will
feel little need to search their own
hearts and will feel little
compunction about
depersonalizing and demeaning
others, whom they can hardly
bring themselves to consider as
"human," never mind "made in
the image of God."
Depersonalizing and demeaning
epithets are part of the rhetorical
violence of the day; "pig" ranks
with "nigger," and "liberal fascist"
ranks with "commie." I need not
quote the other standard epithets
that take the place of
person-respecting argument.
Perhaps the call to suffer for
what one believes in comes the
hardest of all. This is not a
popular point of view in a day
when everyone's "rights," both
real and imagined, are to be
demanded with amnesty for
violence.
The tragedy lies in the fact that
Dr. Brown offers a Christian
response to those—on both right
and left-—who have neither the
commitment nor the
understanding to respond in this

way. To hope that a Christian
response can be obtained without
a personal relationship to Him
who makes such a response
possible may be idealistic, but
sadly it is not realistic.
Richard H.Bube
Professor
Stink
You, and Stanford, ar° to be
congratulated on having a faculty
aboard with the depth of
perception necessary to return the
"fire him" verdict against Bruce
Franklin, "avowed maoist,
marxist, leninist, "Professor of
English (tenured). I can only hope
that you have the intestinal
fortitude necessary to rid the
University of this traitor as
expeditiously as possible. The
tendency of radical academicians
to hide behind the role of
"academic freedom" is getting
old, stale and (like ancient cheese)
even beginning to "stink" a little.
