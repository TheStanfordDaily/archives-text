# Franklin Dismissal Reaction
## 
### 
Minimum Obligation
We, the graduate student
teaching assistants in the
Department of Political Science
consider our minimum obligation
in the context of the Bruce
Franklin case to be to prolong
discussion of the case in as many
forums as possible with a view to
raising the consciousness and
comprehension of the issues
involved among people in this
University.
With this end in mind, we
intend to become thoroughly
familiar with the issues in the
case—both narrow and broad—and
to offer to discuss them with our
sections either during classtime or
at a time convenient to the
students. We also plan to invite all
members of our own faculty to
meet with us to discuss the
implications of the case.
We urge at least this minimum
course of action upon all other
segments of the University
community on the theory that
anything less would be wholly

inconsistent with the fact that
these events assuredly affect us all
more profoundly than we yet
realize.
(Signed by 11 political science
teaching assistants.)
Peace And ?
At least the air is clear. We all
now know what some of us have
repeatedly been ridiculed for
suggesting.
The words "academic
freedom" in our country have the
same relation to reality as does
our government's description of
its military aims in Asia. Freedom
of speech at Stanford means just
what it does at Lockheed and at
Hewlett-Packard and at SRI.
The price of intellectual and
personal integrity can be one's
job, a circumstance that turns the
First Amendment into an
indulgence for the independently
wealthy.
An editor of the Daily once
commented, in another context,
that the Stanford faculty had
opted for peace and quiet instead
of peace and freedom. We seem to
have done it again.
Robert Finn,
Professor of Mathematics
Outrage
We, the undersigned Library
workers, wish to express our
outrage at the Advisory Board's
decision to fire Professor Bruce
Franklin.
1) We believe that the
University cannot afford to lose
one of its most effective
spokesmen against imperialism,
racism, and the war crimes being
committed in S.E. Asia.
2) We resent the fact that
Bruce Franklin has been singled
out for his political views, which
are embarrassing to the University
administration, and for his
persistance in exposing the
University's immoral relationship
to and involvement with the
government, the military and large
industrial corporations.
3) The recommendation to fire
Bruce Franklin is another
demonstration of the farcical
nature of the University's
quasi-judicial processes and its
sham grievance procedures, whose
outcome is clearly not based upon
the evidence presented and which
serve merely as smoke screens for
foregone decisions intended to
stifle political dissent and abridge
constitutional freedoms.
4) The concept of academic

freedom will be violated if Bruce
Franklin loses his position as
professor at Stanford, and the
jobs of others on campus who
struggle for justice, peace and
human rights will be jeopardized.
5) We suggest that a University
administration which engages in
such blatant political repression is
itself seriously in need of
rehabilitation.
We insist that President Lyman
reverse the Advisory Board's
decision.
(Signed by 40 Library workers.)
Debt of Gratitude
Quite apart from the nature of
the recommendation made by the
Advisory Board in the case of
Professor Franklin, I believe that
the entire campus community
owes a debt of gratitude to that
group for its skillful, unprejudiced
and persevering effort. These
unselfish men have lost much time
from their regular .vork, albeit in
a project of considerable import. I
wish them well as they return to a
more normal schedule of
academic activities.
May I add that in my view, a
careful reading of the Advisory
Board's Report is a necessary
prerequisite to the formation of
intelligent opinions of any sort
about the case.
Daniel Bershader
Professor of Aeronautics
and Astronautics
Double Standard
As students of African history,
we feel particularly compelled to
speak out because of Professor
Franklin's energetic efforts to
alert members of the Stanford
community as to the imperialist
nature of the University's
complicity in the Vietnam War.
This decision has grave
implications for those within the
University who would speak out
against similar activities in South
Africa and the Portuguese-held
territories.
By calling for Franklin's
dismissal and implying that prople
of his persuasion need
"rehabilitation," the Board has
attacked all of us who would go
beyond the superficialities of the
conventional liberal interpretation
of the U.S, role vis a w'sthe Third
World. Is academic
excommunication to be the lot of
all those whose analyses of the
roots of the contemporary world
crisis do not conform to standard,

"responsible" opinion?
The Board made its
recommendation in the name of
"academic freedom." Yet the
concept of academic freedom
inherent in the Board's action is
peculiar indeed. It forbids certain
kinds of political activity for
tending to "incite viloence" while
it allows continued research into
new weapons systems.
It disallows the revolutionary
arguments of Bruce Franklin
while it protects the racist
rantings of William Shockley. As a
students who feel a strong moral
commitment to the
administration's double-standard a
academic freedom.

Real Violence
Whether inflicted by the state
or incited by Bruce Franklin. We
view violence as a great evil . And
we see Stanford's harrassment and
dismissal of Bruce Franklin as a
real violence done both to him
and to the traditions of academic
freedom and free speech.
For this university to
self-righteously denounce Bruce
Franklin as "violent" is a
disgusting hypocrisy.
In the hearings it came out that
Bruce Franklin had changed from
liberal to pacifist-activist to
militant revolutionary.
To us, however non-violent
activism provides many more
compassionate modes of actiom
offers opportunities for creative
actions, and reinforce the nature
of the ends we seek, rather than
compromising them.
But Bruce Franklin's and our
outrage springs from the same
source. Our anger is as great as his;
we hope we are at least c*
committed to change,
Besides mere words of support,
we would like to offer a tangible
suggestion. The university may
fire Franklin, but we students can
effectively circumvent that
decision. Under the terms of
the injunction, Professor Franklin
is barred from the campus—the
southern boundary being defined
as Campus Drive. Columbae
House lies just beyond, and he is
legally free to come here.
Columbae is also close enough to
be convenient for students to
reach. We offer the use of our
lounge so that Professor Franklin
may teach his course.

Real Violence
Whether inflicted by the state
or incited by Bruce Franklin. We
view violence as a great evil . And
we see Stanford's harrassment and
dismissal of Bruce Franklin as a
real violence done both to him
and to the traditions of academic
freedom and free speech.
For this university to
self-righteously denounce Bruce
Franklin as "violent" is a
disgusting hypocrisy.
In the hearings it came out that
Bruce Franklin had changed from
liberal to pacifist-activist to
militant revolutionary.
To us, however non-violent
activism provides many more
compassionate modes of actiom
offers opportunities for creative
actions, and reinforce the nature
of the ends we seek, rather than
compromising them.
But Bruce Franklin's and our
outrage springs from the same
source. Our anger is as great as his;
we hope we are at least c*
committed to change,
Besides mere words of support,
we would like to offer a tangible
suggestion. The university may
fire Franklin, but we students can
effectively circumvent that
decision. Under the terms of
the injunction, Professor Franklin
is barred from the campus—the
southern boundary being defined
as Campus Drive. Columbae
House lies just beyond, and he is
legally free to come here.
Columbae is also close enough to
be convenient for students to
reach. We offer the use of our
lounge so that Professor Franklin
may teach his course.
The Columbae Community
Minimum Obligation
We, the graduate student
teaching assistants in the
Department of Political Science
consider our minimum obligation
in the context of the Bruce
Franklin case to be to prolong
discussion of the case in as many
forums as possible with a view to
raising the consciousness and
comprehension of the issues
involved among people in this
University.
With this end in mind, we
intend to become thoroughly
familiar with the issues in the
case—both narrow and broad—and
to offer to discuss them with our
sections either during classtime or
at a time convenient to the
students. We also plan to invite all
members of our own faculty to
meet with us to discuss the
implications of the case.
We urge at least this minimum
course of action upon all other
segments of the University
community on the theory that
anything less would be wholly

inconsistent with the fact that
these events assuredly affect us all
more profoundly than we yet
realize.

Peace And ?
At least the air is clear. We all
now know what some of us have
repeatedly been ridiculed for
suggesting.
The words "academic
freedom" in our country have the
same relation to reality as does
our government's description of
its military aims in Asia. Freedom
of speech at Stanford means just
what it does at Lockheed and at
Hewlett-Packard and at SRI.
The price of intellectual and
personal integrity can be one's
job, a circumstance that turns the
First Amendment into an
indulgence for the independently
wealthy.
An editor of the Daily once
commented, in another context,
that the Stanford faculty had
opted for peace and quiet instead
of peace and freedom. We seem to
have done it again.
Robert Finn,

Outrage
We, the undersigned Library
workers, wish to express our
outrage at the Advisory Board's
decision to fire Professor Bruce
Franklin.
1) We believe that the
University cannot afford to lose
one of its most effective
spokesmen against imperialism,
racism, and the war crimes being
committed in S.E. Asia.
2) We resent the fact that
Bruce Franklin has been singled
out for his political views, which
are embarrassing to the University
administration, and for his
persistance in exposing the
University's immoral relationship
to and involvement with the
government, the military and large
industrial corporations.
3) The recommendation to fire
Bruce Franklin is another
demonstration of the farcical
nature of the University's
quasi-judicial processes and its
sham grievance procedures, whose
outcome is clearly not based upon
the evidence presented and which
serve merely as smoke screens for
foregone decisions intended to
stifle political dissent and abridge
constitutional freedoms.
4) The concept of academic

freedom will be violated if Bruce
Franklin loses his position as
professor at Stanford, and the
jobs of others on campus who
struggle for justice, peace and
human rights will be jeopardized.
5) We suggest that a University
administration which engages in
such blatant political repression is
itself seriously in need of
rehabilitation.
We insist that President Lyman
reverse the Advisory Board's
decision.
(Signed by 40 Library workers.)
Debt of Gratitude
Quite apart from the nature of
the recommendation made by the
Advisory Board in the case of
Professor Franklin, I believe that
the entire campus community
owes a debt of gratitude to that
group for its skillful, unprejudiced
and persevering effort. These
unselfish men have lost much time
from their regular .vork, albeit in
a project of considerable import. I
wish them well as they return to a
more normal schedule of
academic activities.
May I add that in my view, a
careful reading of the Advisory
Board's Report is a necessary
prerequisite to the formation of
intelligent opinions of any sort
about the case.

Double Standard
As students of African history,
we feel particularly compelled to
speak out because of Professor
Franklin's energetic efforts to

community as to the imperialist
nature of the University's
complicity in the Vietnam War.
This decision has grave
implications for those within the
University who would speak out
against similar activities in South
Africa and the Portuguese-held
territories.

spokesmen against imperialism,
racism, and the war crimes being
committed in S.E. Asia.
2) We resent the fact that
Bruce Franklin has been singled
out for his political views, which
are embarrassing to the University
administration, and for his
persistance in exposing the
University's immoral relationship
to and involvement with the
government, the military and large
industrial corporations.
3) The recommendation to fire
Bruce Franklin is another
demonstration of the farcical
nature of the University's
quasi-judicial processes and its
sham grievance procedures, whose
outcome is clearly not based upon
the evidence presented and which
serve merely as smoke screens for
foregone decisions intended to
stifle political dissent and abridge
constitutional freedoms.
4) The concept of academic

freedom will be violated if Bruce
Franklin loses his position as
professor at Stanford, and the

struggle for justice, peace and

such blatant political repression is

rehabilitation.

Debt of Gratitude
Quite apart from the nature of
the recommendation made by the
Advisory Board in the case of
Professor Franklin, I believe that
the entire campus community
owes a debt of gratitude to that
group for its skillful, unprejudiced
and persevering effort. These
unselfish men have lost much time
from their regular .vork, albeit in
a project of considerable import. I
wish them well as they return to a
more normal schedule of
academic activities.
May I add that in my view, a
careful reading of the Advisory
Board's Report is a necessary
prerequisite to the formation of
intelligent opinions of any sort
about the case.

Double Standard
As students of African history,
we feel particularly compelled to
speak out because of Professor
Franklin's energetic efforts to
alert members of the Stanford
community as to the imperialist
nature of the University's
complicity in the Vietnam War.
This decision has grave
implications for those within the
University who would speak out
against similar activities in South
Africa and the Portuguese-held
territories.
By calling for Franklin's
dismissal and implying that prople
of his persuasion need
"rehabilitation," the Board has
attacked all of us who would go
beyond the superficialities of the
conventional liberal interpretation
of the U.S, role vis a w'sthe Third
World. Is academic
excommunication to be the lot of
all those whose analyses of the
roots of the contemporary world
crisis do not conform to standard,

"responsible" opinion?
The Board made its
recommendation in the name of
"academic freedom." Yet the
concept of academic freedom
inherent in the Board's action is
peculiar indeed. It forbids certain
kinds of political activity for
tending to "incite viloence" while
it allows continued research into
new weapons systems.
It disallows the revolutionary
arguments of Bruce Franklin
while it protects the racist
rantings of William Shockley. As a
students who feel a strong moral
commitment to the
administration's double-standard a

Real Violence
Whether inflicted by the state
or incited by Bruce Franklin. We
view violence as a great evil . And
we see Stanford's harrassment and
dismissal of Bruce Franklin as a
real violence done both to him
and to the traditions of academic
freedom and free speech.
For this university to
self-righteously denounce Bruce
Franklin as "violent" is a
disgusting hypocrisy.
In the hearings it came out that
Bruce Franklin had changed from
liberal to pacifist-activist to
militant revolutionary.
To us, however non-violent
activism provides many more
compassionate modes of actiom
offers opportunities for creative
actions, and reinforce the nature
of the ends we seek, rather than
compromising them.
But Bruce Franklin's and our
outrage springs from the same
source. Our anger is as great as his;
we hope we are at least c*
committed to change,
Besides mere words of support,
we would like to offer a tangible
suggestion. The university may
fire Franklin, but we students can
effectively circumvent that
decision. Under the terms of
the injunction, Professor Franklin
is barred from the campus—the
southern boundary being defined
as Campus Drive. Columbae
House lies just beyond, and he is
legally free to come here.
Columbae is also close enough to
be convenient for students to
reach. We offer the use of our
lounge so that Professor Franklin
may teach his course.
The Columbae Community
Minimum Obligation
We, the graduate student
teaching assistants in the
Department of Political Science
consider our minimum obligation
in the context of the Bruce
Franklin case to be to prolong
discussion of the case in as many
forums as possible with a view to
raising the consciousness and
comprehension of the issues
involved among people in this
University.
With this end in mind, we
intend to become thoroughly
familiar with the issues in the
case—both narrow and broad—and
to offer to discuss them with our
sections either during classtime or
at a time convenient to the
students. We also plan to invite all
members of our own faculty to
meet with us to discuss the
implications of the case.
We urge at least this minimum
course of action upon all other
segments of the University
community on the theory that
anything less would be wholly

inconsistent with the fact that
these events assuredly affect us all
more profoundly than we yet
realize.

Peace And ?
At least the air is clear. We all
now know what some of us have
repeatedly been ridiculed for
suggesting.
The words "academic
freedom" in our country have the
same relation to reality as does
our government's description of
its military aims in Asia. Freedom
of speech at Stanford means just
what it does at Lockheed and at
Hewlett-Packard and at SRI.
The price of intellectual and
personal integrity can be one's
job, a circumstance that turns the
First Amendment into an
indulgence for the independently
wealthy.
An editor of the Daily once
commented, in another context,
that the Stanford faculty had
opted for peace and quiet instead
of peace and freedom. We seem to
have done it again.

decision. Under the terms of
the injunction, Professor Franklin
is barred from the campus—the
southern boundary being defined
as Campus Drive. Columbae
House lies just beyond, and he is
legally free to come here.
Columbae is also close enough to
be convenient for students to
reach. We offer the use of our
lounge so that Professor Franklin
may teach his course.
