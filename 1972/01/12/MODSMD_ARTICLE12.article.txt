(Editor's Note: RED HOT
ROUNDUP will be running on a
somewhat regular basis to provide
information of interest to
pre-meds and other science
students.)

Medical and Dental Schools are
always pleased to see that their
applicants have had research
experience, and various scientific
organizations throughout the
country provide opportunities
each summer. Announcements for
two such programs have recently
been forwarded to the Academic
Information Center.
The Program of Heart
Associations in California is

sponsoring a student research
associate program this summer to
encourage gifted science students
to consider careers in
cardiovascular research. Students
will be assigned to leading
research laboratories in California
for a ten week period during the

summer and will work under the
supervision of experienced
scientists, receiving stipends of
$750 for the period.
The Program is seekingjuniors,
seniors, or graduate students
currently enrolled in college with
an interst in research and
familiarity with chemical,
biochemical, and/or physiological
principles and laboratory
techniques. Applications for the
program are due February 1, 1972
along with transcripts, and may be
obtained by writing:

Stanford S. Kroopf, M.D.,
chairman
Student Research Sub-Committee
California Heart Association
1370 Mission Street
San Francisco 94103.
Students are selected on the
basis of their application,

REDHOT

transcripts, and letters of
recommendation, and then sent a
list of laboratories from which to
choose that hopefully match his
interests and talents.
The Council on Dental
Research of the American Dental
Association, The American
Association of Dental Schools,
and the National Institute of
Dental Research sponsor a
Program in Dental Research for
College Students during summer
1972.
Designed to provide an
opportunity for college students
to engage in basic research related
to oral health and become familiar
with some of the scientific areas
in which dental research presents
challenges, the program is open to
students who will not receive their
baccalaureate degrees prior to

May of the year following the
program. The stipend is $875 for
ten weeks plus transportation
from the student's home to where
he will be working and
transportation to a post-research
conference of all the program
participants.
Opportunities for research
participation are available in
anatomy, anthropology,
behavioral and social sciences,
biochemistry, cancer research, and
a variety of other fields. Further
information about the program is
available in the AIC and
applications due February 15,
1972 are available from:
Council on Dental Research
American Dental Association
211 East Chicago Avenue
Chicago, Illinois 60611.
As more information of
interest to science, pre-medical, or
pre-veterinary students becomes
available, it will be run through
this column which hopefully will
run on a regular basis. Any
activities of interest to
pre-medical or pre-dental students
can be brought to the attention of
the DAILY through this column.

Students who are planning to
apply to medical school this
coming summer and would like to
discuss certain medical schools
with their recent graduates should
contact their advisors who can put
them in contact with such people
who can answer questions about
various schools from first hand
experience.

transportation to a post-research
conference of all the program
participants.
Opportunities for research
participation are available in
anatomy, anthropology,
behavioral and social sciences,
biochemistry, cancer research, and
a variety of other fields. Further
information about the program is
available in the AIC and
applications due February 15,
1972 are available from:
Council on Dental Research
American Dental Association
211 East Chicago Avenue
Chicago, Illinois 60611.
As more information of
interest to science, pre-medical, or
pre-veterinary students becomes
available, it will be run through
this column which hopefully will
run on a regular basis. Any
activities of interest to
pre-medical or pre-dental students
can be brought to the attention of
the DAILY through this column.

Students who are planning to
apply to medical school this
coming summer and would like to
discuss certain medical schools
with their recent graduates should
contact their advisors who can put
them in contact with such people
who can answer questions about
various schools from first hand
experience.
(Editor's Note: RED HOT
ROUNDUP will be running on a
somewhat regular basis to provide
information of interest to
pre-meds and other science
students.)

Medical and Dental Schools are
always pleased to see that their
applicants have had research
experience, and various scientific
organizations throughout the
country provide opportunities
each summer. Announcements for
two such programs have recently
been forwarded to the Academic
Information Center.
The Program of Heart
Associations in California is

sponsoring a student research
associate program this summer to
encourage gifted science students
to consider careers in
cardiovascular research. Students
will be assigned to leading
research laboratories in California
for a ten week period during the

summer and will work under the
supervision of experienced
scientists, receiving stipends of
$750 for the period.
The Program is seekingjuniors,
seniors, or graduate students
currently enrolled in college with
an interst in research and
familiarity with chemical,
biochemical, and/or physiological
principles and laboratory
techniques. Applications for the
program are due February 1, 1972
along with transcripts, and may be
obtained by writing:

Stanford S. Kroopf, M.D.,
chairman
Student Research Sub-Committee
California Heart Association
1370 Mission Street
San Francisco 94103.
Students are selected on the
basis of their application,

REDHOT

transcripts, and letters of
recommendation, and then sent a
list of laboratories from which to
choose that hopefully match his
interests and talents.
The Council on Dental
Research of the American Dental
Association, The American
Association of Dental Schools,
and the National Institute of
Dental Research sponsor a
Program in Dental Research for
College Students during summer
1972.
Designed to provide an
opportunity for college students
to engage in basic research related
to oral health and become familiar
with some of the scientific areas
in which dental research presents
challenges, the program is open to
students who will not receive their
baccalaureate degrees prior to

May of the year following the
program. The stipend is $875 for
ten weeks plus transportation
from the student's home to where
he will be working and
transportation to a post-research
conference of all the program
participants.
