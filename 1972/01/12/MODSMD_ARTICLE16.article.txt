# Pac-8 To Decide On NCAA Freshman Eligibility Ruling
## 
### CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
At its annual meeting last week
in Hollywood, Florida, the
National Collegiate Athletic
Association members voted to
allow freshman to compete on
varsity football and basketball
squads.
The Atlantic Coast and the
Western Athletic Conferences
introduced the resolution which
passed by a 2-1 margin. It is now
up to the individual conferences
and independents to decide

whether to implement the
NCAA's ruling.
The Southwest, the Big Eight,
the Big Ten, and the Pacific-8
conferences opposed the measure
and the director of the Big Eight,
Charles Neinas, stated that he
would try to gather support
against the local implementation
of the freshman rule.
Domino Effect
The Southwest Conference,
however decided to go along with
the new legislation in order not to
give rival schools a recruiting edge.

Wiles Hallock, the executive
director of the Pac-8, attended the
NCAA meeting and explained the
politics of the resistance to the
freshman rule. "I am afraid that
the action will have a domino
effect since the Southwest
Conference's neighboring Big
Eight will not want its recruiting
to be adversely affected.
"A coach who can tell a top
prospect that he will start on the
team for four years has an obvious
advantage over someone who can
offer only a three year program."
Hallock explained that the Big
Ten is having a special meeting
this Sunday to vote on whether to
allow freshmen play in major
sports. With resistance to the rule
crumbling, Hallock said that the
Pac-8 will also move quickly on
the issue to eliminate the
uncertainty of the conference
school's recruiting status.
Pressure
Bob Sprenger, the Pac-B's
publicity director, feels that
allowing freshmen to play varsity
football and basketball is putting
too much pressure athletically and
academically on youngsters. "We
even limit our freshman football
schedule to four games in order to
give the freshman time to adjust
to college life. Now, if the
conference approves the ruling,
we will have freshmen playing
football in August before they
have ever even been to a class,"
Sprenger explained.
In searching for an alternative
to the freshman program, Hallock
said that the Pac-8 might set up an
expanded junior varsity schedule
involving freshmen.
The NCAA's intention in
passing the freshmen legislation
was to cut the spiraling costs of
running athletic programs. An
expanded JV schedule might incur
extra costs, but Hallock hopes to
keep these down by keeping the
schedules on a local level.

NCAA ruling had come earlier, Winesberry would have been one of the few freshmen talented enough to
