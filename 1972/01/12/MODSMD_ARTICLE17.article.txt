# Gymnasts Prepare For USC

Stanford gymnastics coach Dan
Miliman emphasizes "inner
development through training
rather than winning meets." He
stresses a "humanistic training
program which allows for mature
individual decisions." And he
views gymnastics as more of an art
form than a sport.
But Miliman also believes that
this non-competitive system will
produce many victories in the
upcoming gymnastics season. His
Indian squad opens a promising
1972 campaign at Stanford Friday
with a 7:30 p.m. meet against
USC.
Miliman would seem to be
overly optimistic af*er last year's
dismal 0-7 season. But the
youthful 1972 Indians feature
some of the nation's top
performers and could reverse last
year's mark.
Sophomore Steve Hug has
recovered from a serious back
injury which sidelined him last
year and will display the talent
that won him a spot on the 1968
Olympic team at the age of 16.
Hug is generally recognized as the
outstanding gymnast in the
United States.
Freshman Bob Anderson was
the Illinois State All Around
champion last year and freshman
Hector Neff won the Los Angeles
All Around title. Sophomore
Howard Bessen should be a
national contender on the rings.
Miliman himself is an
outstanding gymnast. The fourth
year Stanford coach won the
world trampoline title in 1964
and captained UC Berkeley's 1968

national champion team.
Since his days as a competitor,
however, Miliman has reshaped
many of his ideas about
gymnastics. "The Japanese are the
world's best gymnasts and I've
looked to Japan for philisophical
as well as mechanical guidance.
"The Japanese see everything
as potentially an artistic activity
and we try to treat gymnastics as
an art."
Miliman has studied Zen
Buddhism and tries to relate its
philosophy of mind-body unity to

gymnastics. He cites the fact that
"there are no status heirarchies of
art in Zen thought—the important
thing is that the individual picks
and pursues an activity
appropriate to himself—that he
strives toward mastery over a long
period of time."
According to Miliman,
Stanford's gymnasts are rapidly
approaching that level of mastery.
"I think we'll outscore USC
Friday night for the first time in
20 years," he predicts.
