Enemy Attack Undetectable
WASHINGTON—CaIIing U.S. air defenses virtually useless,
a House subcommitte said yesterday an enemy attack
could come through a 1,500-mile gap between Florida and
California without advance warning.
It released testimony by the air-defense system's
commanding general that there is no antibomber redar
around the nation's entire perimeter "that cannot be
either underflown or flown around."
But the Pentagon called the possibility of an enemy
attack from the south extremely remote and said there is
no way the Soviets could launch a bomber attack without
the United States knowing about it.
Pentagon spokesman Jerry W. Friedheim
acknowledged, however, that some U.S, border sections
are not under 24-hour radar protection-citing a lapse
between phasedown of the present air-defense system and
development of a new one.
Present air defenses were assailed by the House Armed
Services investigating subcommittee in a report on the
Cuban airliner that landed at New Orleans International
Airport last Oct. 26 with 21 Cubans bound for a sugar
conference.
The Russian-built Cuban plane lumbered into the U.S,
defense zone at 250 miles an hour without being spotted
by the U.S, defense system until the pilot radioed for
landling instructions, the report said, even though Havana
had filed a flight plan into Miami nearly four hours earlier.
Booze Budgeted
SACBAMENTO—California adults will drink an average 31
gallons of beer, 4 gallons of hard liquor and gallons of
table wine during 1972-73, Gov. Reagan's budget
predicted yesterday.
On the basis of that forecast, the state will collect $139
million in alcoholic beverage taxes during the coming
budget year compared with $132 million this year.
"Adult per capita consumption of alcoholic beverages
has been steadily increasing, with the exception of sweet
wine," the budget said.
"A buildup of beer inventories in May and June of
1973 is assumed in anticipation of a strike. This will
inflate the 1972-73 tax receipts although it should not
change calendar year consumption."
Candidate List Compiled
TALLAHASSEE—FIorida Secretary of State Richard
Stone nominated yesterday a field of 12
Demoncrats-including George Wallace and Sen. Edward
Kennedy-for the state's automatic entry March 14
presidential Primary.
Stone also listed two challengers against President
Nixon on the Republican side of the ballot-antiwar Rep.
Paul McCloskey of California and conservative Rep. John
Ashbrook of Ohio.
Under the Florida primary law, Stone based his
nominations on general recognition of candidates by the
state and national news media. However, these
recommendations are not final.
Any person on the list still may remove his name by
filing an affidavit by Feb. 15 asserting he is not and will
not be a candidate.
In Washington, a spokesman for Kennedy said the
Massachusetts senator would file the required affidavit to

take his name off the ballot.
Stone said all doubt that Alabama Governor Wallace
should be listed as a Democrat was swept aside last week
by many news articles quoting the governor's campaign
aide, Charles Snider, as saying Wallace would run under
that banner in Florida.
Other Democratic candidates nominated by Stobe were
Sens. Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota, Vance Hartke of
Indiana, Henry Jackson of Washington, George McGovern
of South Dakota and Edmund Muskie of Maine,
Also nominated as Demoncratic candidates were Rep.
Shirley Chisholm of New York, Mayor John Lindsay of
New York, former Sen. Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota,
Rep. Wilbur Mills of Arkansas, and Los Angeles Mayor
Sam Yorty.
Integration Ordered
RICHMOND, Va.—The City of Richmond and suburban
Henrico and Chesterfield counties were given 30 days by a
federal judge yesterday to "take all steps . . . necessary"
to merge their school systems in September.
U.S, District Court Judge Robert R. Merhige Jr.
entered the order as a followup to his landmark decision
Monday directing the consolidation as a means of
achieving "meaningful integration."
Yesterday's order gave the State Board of Education
30 days to name an administrative staff for the new,
104,000-pupil metropolitan school division and 90 days
to submit a plan for its financial operation.
The two counties took initial steps to appeal the
decision, which envisions the busing of 78,000 pupils to
bring better racial balance to the schools of three
localities.
Richmond's 50.000-pupil system now is more than 60
percent black. Enrollment in both Henrico, with 34,000
pupils, and Chesterfield with about 20,000, is more than
90 per cent white.
Mrs. Hamilton Crockford, chairman of the board, said
she believed most Richmond residents would agree with
the ruling and that the board was "pleased, of course, to
have won the case."
But Irvin G, Horner, chairman of the Chesterfield
Board of Supervisors, said Merhige's decision consisted of
"personal opions disguised as law," and was "outrageous."
"If the ruling sticks," Horner said, "this will be the end
of public schools and we know them. They will become a
black school system and the private schools will be
white."
Allied Troops Retreat
SAIGON—North Vietnam's big winter offensive drove
Laotian troops from the strategic Bolovens Plateau in
southern Laos yesterday and tightened a grip around an
army base in the northern sector. At the same time,
Cambodian forces abandoned Kerk, 10 miles from the
South Vietnamese border, before a North Vietnamese
advance.
Despite a U.S. aerial pounding of the Ho Chi Minh trail
to halt supplies and reinforcements, there was no sign of
abatement in what U.S., sources call the enemy's most
intensive ground offensive ever launched in Laos.

federal judge yesterday to "take all steps . . . necessary"
to merge their school systems in September.
U.S, District Court Judge Robert R. Merhige Jr.
entered the order as a followup to his landmark decision
Monday directing the consolidation as a means of
achieving "meaningful integration."
Yesterday's order gave the State Board of Education
30 days to name an administrative staff for the new,
104,000-pupil metropolitan school division and 90 days
to submit a plan for its financial operation.
The two counties took initial steps to appeal the
decision, which envisions the busing of 78,000 pupils to
bring better racial balance to the schools of three
localities.
Richmond's 50.000-pupil system now is more than 60
percent black. Enrollment in both Henrico, with 34,000
pupils, and Chesterfield with about 20,000, is more than
90 per cent white.
Mrs. Hamilton Crockford, chairman of the board, said
she believed most Richmond residents would agree with
the ruling and that the board was "pleased, of course, to
have won the case."
But Irvin G, Horner, chairman of the Chesterfield
Board of Supervisors, said Merhige's decision consisted of
"personal opions disguised as law," and was "outrageous."
"If the ruling sticks," Horner said, "this will be the end
of public schools and we know them. They will become a
black school system and the private schools will be
white."
Allied Troops Retreat
SAIGON—North Vietnam's big winter offensive drove
Laotian troops from the strategic Bolovens Plateau in
southern Laos yesterday and tightened a grip around an
army base in the northern sector. At the same time,
Cambodian forces abandoned Kerk, 10 miles from the
South Vietnamese border, before a North Vietnamese
advance.
Despite a U.S. aerial pounding of the Ho Chi Minh trail
to halt supplies and reinforcements, there was no sign of
abatement in what U.S., sources call the enemy's most
intensive ground offensive ever launched in Laos.
Enemy Attack Undetectable
WASHINGTON—CaIIing U.S. air defenses virtually useless,
a House subcommitte said yesterday an enemy attack
could come through a 1,500-mile gap between Florida and
California without advance warning.
It released testimony by the air-defense system's
commanding general that there is no antibomber redar
around the nation's entire perimeter "that cannot be
either underflown or flown around."
But the Pentagon called the possibility of an enemy
attack from the south extremely remote and said there is
no way the Soviets could launch a bomber attack without
the United States knowing about it.
Pentagon spokesman Jerry W. Friedheim
acknowledged, however, that some U.S, border sections
are not under 24-hour radar protection-citing a lapse
between phasedown of the present air-defense system and
development of a new one.
Present air defenses were assailed by the House Armed
Services investigating subcommittee in a report on the
Cuban airliner that landed at New Orleans International
Airport last Oct. 26 with 21 Cubans bound for a sugar
conference.
The Russian-built Cuban plane lumbered into the U.S,
defense zone at 250 miles an hour without being spotted
by the U.S, defense system until the pilot radioed for
landling instructions, the report said, even though Havana
had filed a flight plan into Miami nearly four hours earlier.
Booze Budgeted
SACBAMENTO—California adults will drink an average 31
gallons of beer, 4 gallons of hard liquor and gallons of
table wine during 1972-73, Gov. Reagan's budget
predicted yesterday.
On the basis of that forecast, the state will collect $139
million in alcoholic beverage taxes during the coming
budget year compared with $132 million this year.
"Adult per capita consumption of alcoholic beverages
has been steadily increasing, with the exception of sweet
wine," the budget said.
"A buildup of beer inventories in May and June of
1973 is assumed in anticipation of a strike. This will
inflate the 1972-73 tax receipts although it should not
change calendar year consumption."
Candidate List Compiled
TALLAHASSEE—FIorida Secretary of State Richard
Stone nominated yesterday a field of 12
Demoncrats-including George Wallace and Sen. Edward
Kennedy-for the state's automatic entry March 14
presidential Primary.
Stone also listed two challengers against President
Nixon on the Republican side of the ballot-antiwar Rep.
Paul McCloskey of California and conservative Rep. John
Ashbrook of Ohio.
Under the Florida primary law, Stone based his
nominations on general recognition of candidates by the
state and national news media. However, these
recommendations are not final.
Any person on the list still may remove his name by
filing an affidavit by Feb. 15 asserting he is not and will
not be a candidate.
In Washington, a spokesman for Kennedy said the
Massachusetts senator would file the required affidavit to

take his name off the ballot.
Stone said all doubt that Alabama Governor Wallace
should be listed as a Democrat was swept aside last week
by many news articles quoting the governor's campaign
aide, Charles Snider, as saying Wallace would run under
that banner in Florida.
Other Democratic candidates nominated by Stobe were
Sens. Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota, Vance Hartke of
Indiana, Henry Jackson of Washington, George McGovern
of South Dakota and Edmund Muskie of Maine,
Also nominated as Demoncratic candidates were Rep.
Shirley Chisholm of New York, Mayor John Lindsay of
New York, former Sen. Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota,
Rep. Wilbur Mills of Arkansas, and Los Angeles Mayor
Sam Yorty.

On the basis of that forecast, the state will collect $139
million in alcoholic beverage taxes during the coming
budget year compared with $132 million this year.
"Adult per capita consumption of alcoholic beverages
has been steadily increasing, with the exception of sweet
wine," the budget said.
"A buildup of beer inventories in May and June of
1973 is assumed in anticipation of a strike. This will
inflate the 1972-73 tax receipts although it should not
change calendar year consumption."
Candidate List Compiled
TALLAHASSEE—FIorida Secretary of State Richard
Stone nominated yesterday a field of 12
Demoncrats-including George Wallace and Sen. Edward
Kennedy-for the state's automatic entry March 14
presidential Primary.
Stone also listed two challengers against President
Nixon on the Republican side of the ballot-antiwar Rep.
Paul McCloskey of California and conservative Rep. John
Ashbrook of Ohio.
Under the Florida primary law, Stone based his
nominations on general recognition of candidates by the
state and national news media. However, these
recommendations are not final.
Any person on the list still may remove his name by
filing an affidavit by Feb. 15 asserting he is not and will
not be a candidate.
In Washington, a spokesman for Kennedy said the
Massachusetts senator would file the required affidavit to

take his name off the ballot.
Stone said all doubt that Alabama Governor Wallace
should be listed as a Democrat was swept aside last week
by many news articles quoting the governor's campaign
aide, Charles Snider, as saying Wallace would run under
that banner in Florida.
Other Democratic candidates nominated by Stobe were
Sens. Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota, Vance Hartke of
Indiana, Henry Jackson of Washington, George McGovern
of South Dakota and Edmund Muskie of Maine,
Also nominated as Demoncratic candidates were Rep.
Shirley Chisholm of New York, Mayor John Lindsay of
New York, former Sen. Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota,
Rep. Wilbur Mills of Arkansas, and Los Angeles Mayor
Sam Yorty.
Integration Ordered
RICHMOND, Va.—The City of Richmond and suburban
Henrico and Chesterfield counties were given 30 days by a
federal judge yesterday to "take all steps . . . necessary"
to merge their school systems in September.
U.S, District Court Judge Robert R. Merhige Jr.
entered the order as a followup to his landmark decision
Monday directing the consolidation as a means of
achieving "meaningful integration."
Yesterday's order gave the State Board of Education
30 days to name an administrative staff for the new,
104,000-pupil metropolitan school division and 90 days
to submit a plan for its financial operation.
The two counties took initial steps to appeal the
decision, which envisions the busing of 78,000 pupils to
bring better racial balance to the schools of three
localities.
Richmond's 50.000-pupil system now is more than 60
percent black. Enrollment in both Henrico, with 34,000
pupils, and Chesterfield with about 20,000, is more than
90 per cent white.
Mrs. Hamilton Crockford, chairman of the board, said
she believed most Richmond residents would agree with
the ruling and that the board was "pleased, of course, to
have won the case."
But Irvin G, Horner, chairman of the Chesterfield
Board of Supervisors, said Merhige's decision consisted of
"personal opions disguised as law," and was "outrageous."
"If the ruling sticks," Horner said, "this will be the end
of public schools and we know them. They will become a
black school system and the private schools will be
white."
Allied Troops Retreat
SAIGON—North Vietnam's big winter offensive drove
Laotian troops from the strategic Bolovens Plateau in
southern Laos yesterday and tightened a grip around an
army base in the northern sector. At the same time,
Cambodian forces abandoned Kerk, 10 miles from the
South Vietnamese border, before a North Vietnamese
advance.
Despite a U.S. aerial pounding of the Ho Chi Minh trail
to halt supplies and reinforcements, there was no sign of
abatement in what U.S., sources call the enemy's most
intensive ground offensive ever launched in Laos.
Enemy Attack Undetectable
WASHINGTON—CaIIing U.S. air defenses virtually useless,
a House subcommitte said yesterday an enemy attack
could come through a 1,500-mile gap between Florida and
California without advance warning.
It released testimony by the air-defense system's
commanding general that there is no antibomber redar
around the nation's entire perimeter "that cannot be
either underflown or flown around."
But the Pentagon called the possibility of an enemy
attack from the south extremely remote and said there is
no way the Soviets could launch a bomber attack without
the United States knowing about it.
Pentagon spokesman Jerry W. Friedheim
acknowledged, however, that some U.S, border sections
are not under 24-hour radar protection-citing a lapse
between phasedown of the present air-defense system and
development of a new one.
Present air defenses were assailed by the House Armed
Services investigating subcommittee in a report on the
Cuban airliner that landed at New Orleans International
Airport last Oct. 26 with 21 Cubans bound for a sugar
conference.
The Russian-built Cuban plane lumbered into the U.S,
defense zone at 250 miles an hour without being spotted
by the U.S, defense system until the pilot radioed for
landling instructions, the report said, even though Havana
had filed a flight plan into Miami nearly four hours earlier.
Booze Budgeted
SACBAMENTO—California adults will drink an average 31
gallons of beer, 4 gallons of hard liquor and gallons of
table wine during 1972-73, Gov. Reagan's budget
predicted yesterday.

million in alcoholic beverage taxes during the coming
budget year compared with $132 million this year.
