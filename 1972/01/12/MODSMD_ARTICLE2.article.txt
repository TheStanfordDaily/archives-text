TOURS, FRANCE—In an unusual
statement published today in one of
France's largest regional newspapers,
the two directors of the
Stanford-in-France program blasted
the French press for printing
"defamatory articles and rumors"
about the recent police search at the
campus.
The quasi-legal statement
threatened lawsuits against authors
and newspapers who have written or
printed such articles.
Professors Paul LeMoal and Rene
Borious, in a statement published in
the Nouvelle Republique (circulation
295,000) wrote: "The directors of
Stanford-in-France, conscious of the
moral damage to this campus and
some of the students here, reserve the
right to bring suit against those
responsible for remarks, rumors or
articles they judge defamatory."
The professors' statement
reaffirmed that the recent search of
seven rooms here does not represent a
new investigation into drug usage but
rather is a continuation of "L'Affair
Corcoran," and that the police found
no drugs during their two hour search.
January Search
[During a January 5 search, 20
French national police, acting on a
search warrant obtained during
Christmas vacation, found several
hashish pipes—only one of them

used—a small, unlabeled bottle of
toothache medicine, and some
cigarette papers. No drugs were found
and no charges have been lodged
against the seven students questioned
at the time, six of whom had admitted
smoking marijuana or hashish on
campus during October, j
The LeMoal-Borious statement
followed a week of wildly inaccurate,
if not intentionally libelous, reporting
on both sides of the Atlantic that
included these major developments:
United Press International (UPI)
obtained from unknown sources the
names and places of birth of the seven
students who had been questioned and
released. UPI, possibly in violation of
French law, named the students in its
dispatches and said that they had been
arrested and charged with possession
of hashish and were awaiting trial in
Paris.
The UPI story appeared at scattered
points around the United States and
Europe. It set off a wave of
transatlantic telephone calls between
"arrested" students and their
frightened and confused parents.
Later, UPI retracted the story, and in
some parts of the country, again listed
the names of the students.
—An Associated Press (AP)— report
neglected to mention that police
found no drugs and only one hashish
pipe during the search. The AP report
printed on page two of the
International Herald Tribune,
contained at least five other mistakes
in the first four paragraphs.
—One Paris daily carried a story
detailing alleged "drug parties" at the
Tours campus.
—A short article in the Nouvelle
Republique carried a misleading
headline with an article suggesting that
police had made a major haul at the
Stanford facility. The paper's story
failed to substantiate the headline and
was inaccurate.
Reputation Damaged
In an interview today, LeMoal
explained "We really thought
Stanford-in-France's reputation was
being damaged by false news that had
been circulating in Tours due to
ambiguous presentation and
over-dramatization by the press. It is
not a question of ill-will, but it is
necessary to re-establish facts on a

local level.
'There is no suit for the time
being," he said. "Nothing of the kind
has ever happened in France. ... No
name of any student not charged has
ever been published in the French
press—Chris Corcoran was under arrest
when her name appeared—and in so far
as some damage may have been done
to Stanford University and its
reputation, I am considering our right
to sue."
Visibly angered and puzzled by the
appearance of the students' names and
birthplaces in the UPI dispatches,
LeMoal said he could not determine
how UPI obtained the data. Students,
however, generally believe the police
are responsible, primarily because they
are known to have elicited passport
information during the students'
interrogations.
"There is no possibility of entering
an action at least for the time being,
against the police because they
steadfastly deny that they released the
names," LeMoal said. "I have asked to
see the judge and the grand jury, and
our lawyer has asked for an
appointment with the head of the
grand jury."
Elaborating on the campus's
reputation in the Tours area, LeMoal
said, "The fact that rumors are
circulating about hashish and
marijuana at Stanford University
damages our good relations with the
town. Some people might refrain from
letting their sons and daughers come
here because they don't want them to
get involved."
LeMoal was highly critical of the
police department's handling of the
"operation" and charged that the
French police had discriminated
against the Stanford-in-France
program.
"The police's position seems to be
awkward: if they have a right to search
this campus, and this seems to be the
case, it means that they can search all
the dorms belonging to the French
university system. It seems as though
they don't want to do so, and that's
because they are afraid of starting a
riot among French students.
"We are the victims of our good
behavior; if they came to our building
and to no other, it's because they

LAZY DAYS-Protesting students confront riot-ready police officers outside Hansen Laboratories (above) after finding
building closed yesterday during afternoon march. Officer encounters two students near lab (bottom left), while Santa
Clara Sheriff Community Relations Officer Donald Tamm eyes David Josephson, a Columbae resident and "Guest
Professor of Social Thought,"who spoke during brief meeting in the building's courtyard
know foreign students wouldn't start
any riotous movement in a French
university."
LeMoal, who has confered with the
French chief of police, said, "I insisted
to the police that I consider their
attitude unfair and undiplomatic
toward American students. . . What I
have said is approved by
representatives of the French
universities, who are backing me in my
efforts."
Until now there has been no
reaction by the French government.
"If there is an absence of reaction,
it is probably because of
embarrassment," LeMoal explained.
"The police look a bit ridiculous."

LeMoal said the directors' statement
was not intended as a warning to the
American press. "It is more the job of
the overseas campuses office to defend
the campus and students (in
America),"he explained. "They have
the necessary documents and
information."
In a related development, LeMoal
said the Tours police chief informed
him Monday that the three students
whose rooms were searched in their
absence would be called in for
questioning.
"There is no question of arrest in
any way," he stated. And LeMoal
predicted that their interrogation "will
complete all questioning in 'L'Affair
Corcoran,'" which has been under
investigation since September.
