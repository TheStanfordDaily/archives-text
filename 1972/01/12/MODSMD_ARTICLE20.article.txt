Confirming that a SWOPSI study
found that financial disaster would
ensue if Defense Department-funded
research was banned from campus,
Associate Vice Provost for Research
William Massey explained the
University's "freedom of research"
posture last night.
Massey, speaking at a KZSU press
conference, said that $10 million in
contracts would disappear if Pentagon
support was ordered off campus.
A "freedom of research"
resolution, which said that faculty
may seek support for research from
any source except classified research,
was confirmed in the Faculty Senate
in December.
Massey dismissed demands that all
Defense Department research be
banned by saying the University

cannot legislate morality: "Who is to
tell a man whether he can think those
thoughts?"
He added that there were "solid
academic reasons" for eliminating
classified research. He noted that at
present "there is nothing that violates
the classified ban guidelines."
Nevertheless, he conceded it was
possible that some non-classified work
might be in progress as part of a larger
classified Pentagon project.
His office is looking into
non-Pentagon funding sources for
research. He cited the Research
Information Center, the Research
Development Fund, and programs
within individual schools as ways that
government funding --which
constitutes over 80% of identified
research—might be diminished.
