# Angela Davis Job Rumors Denied
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Will Angela Davis, currently jailed
in Palo Alto under an indictment
charging her with kidnap and murder,
be offered a position on the faculty of
the Stanford German Studies
Department?
The Palo Alto Times yesterday
quoted Assistant German Professor
Juan Flores as stating that Davis' name
would be submitted to a vote of the 15
faculty members of the Department.
Reaction to the report from
University and department officials
ranged from incredulity to outrage.
Edgar Lohner, cha'rman of the
German Studies Department, angrily
told the Daily yesterday that the
report was totally untrue.
"I just called the paper, and told
them that there was absolutely no
truth in that story," he snapped. "One
faculty member went to the Times and
brought that up, but it is simply not
true."
Vice-provost Robert M.
Rosenzweig, Acting President of the
University during the illness of
President Lyman and the absence of
Provost William Miller, refused to even
speculate on whether the
administration would accept or reject
such an appointment.
"It's so remote... it seems so
highly improbable that this would ever
reach us. .. it's so hypothetical I'm
almost speechless," he said.
Idea Supported
However, Associate Professor of
German Peter Foulkes confirmed that
the idea of offering Davis a position in
the department has received
substantial support from Department
members.
According to Foulkes, who is also
Associate Dean of the School of
Humanities and Sciences, talk of a
possible Davis appointment has been
"sporadic."
He said the idea first surfaced about
two years ago, when Davis was fired
from her job in UCLA's philosophy
department on the grounds that she
was an admitted Communist. He said
the idea came up again at the end of
last quarter.
Although a philosophy instructor at
UCLA, Davis spent two years studying
in Germany, and has developed a
strong familiarity with German
literature and philosophy, according to
Foulkes.
Verdict Awaited
He said that any offer of a position
would have to come from a majority
vote of Department members, and that
the Department "couldn't consider"
making the offer unless Davis is cleared
of the criminal charges againct her.
She is currently awaiting trial in San
Jose on charges stemming from an
August, 1970 shootout at the Marin
County Courthouse that claimed the
life of Superior Court Judge Harold
Haley and Jonathan Jackson,
17-year-old brother of the late
"Soledad Brother" George Jackson.
Davis is accused of supplying the
weapons for the aborted escape
attempt.
Foulkes said "I think that there are
one or two faculty members who
would consider it a grand political
gesture" to tender the offer before a
verdict has been reached, but
estimated that such a proposal would
only attract the support of "two or
three" people on the 15-member
faculty.
However, if Davis is cleared,
Foulkes estimated that she has a
50-50 chance to land a job.
He expressed the belief that should

Davis be acquitted and should she be
offered a post, the Dean of Humanities
and Sciences' office and the President's
office, both of which must approve
faculty appointments, would make a
decision "based on the academic
merits of the case."
Foulkes also criticized the Times
story, which he said "misinterpreted
the implications" of some of his
comments.
Quote Inaccurate
The Times quoted him as stating
"there is no policy at Stanford now
that would prevent the Department
from hiring a known Communist as a
faculty member," after which the
article attributed to him a statement
that funds had recently been made
available to hire one Communist
professor a year.
What he really said, Foulkes told
the Daily, was that funds had been
made available for"one visiting Marxist
professor per year, to teach one or two
quarters."
He said that the Times quote
implied that "we would hire a
Communist a year, and in 30 years
have 30 Communists on the faculty."
He also stressed his use of the term
"Marxist" rather than "Communist."
Even assuming the Department
faculty would vote to offer Davis a
post, the most difficult tests would be
yet to come. The appointment would
have to clear the of/ices of President
Lyman, Humanities and Sciences Dean
Albert Hastdorf, the Faculty Advisory
Board, as well as gain the approval of
the Board of Trustees.
