President Richard Lyman concurred
with the faculty group Sunday.

Supreme Court Justice William
Rehnquist and former Assistant

of the Academic Affairs Committee

consider the Franklin firing before the
entire board does so that students
would have input into the decision.

the committee and one of the ASSU
Council of Presidents, told the

be able to present some student
perspective to the Board. She noted

students on the Board, only on Board
Committees.

the Committee would hear the issue.
