# Who Is Green Avenger
## 
### 
The Green Avenger stalks the
corridors of Roble, You don't
mess with the Green Avenger.
He's a mean one, the Green A.
You just step aside and let him
pass. "Lookie there," you might
whisper to a gaping freshman.
'That's the Green Avenger. Don't
mess with him."
And the Green Avenger walks
on by, cool, catlike, a mysterious

home for Christmas, and if so,
what did he get from Santa Claus?
Nobody know but the jolly old
elf, and maybe Mr. and Mrs.
Avenger, if they exist.
Some people whisper that the
Green Avenger is an ex-hasher
who fell into a giant pot of Weird
Green Beans, thereby altering his
body chemistry and receiving
unnatural powers. But all hashers

WELCOME

smile playing on his lips.
Implacable, Remorseless.
Where's he going, this Green
Avenger? What's he up to?
Nobody knows, but you better
believe it's important.
He's not going to the library to
study. Not the Green A. He's not
going to the post office to check
for mail. The Green Avenger never
gets mail.
He's not going down to the
basement to watch TV or get a
pepsi. Or to the dining room to
play poker or up to 3-center to
eat popcorn. The Green Avenger
is above all that.
"What is the Green Avenger
avenging?" an addled pre-med
might ask, looking up from his
organic. Is he fighting to make the
world safe for Bruce Franklin?
Donald Duck? Jesus?
Nah.
Well, why green?
It's rumored that the Green A
is distantly related to Green
Arrow and Green Lantern on his
mother's side. Others say that he's
an eco-freak and Standard Oil
better watch out. But the Avenger
never recycles nothing, so this is
doubtful.
Does the Green Avenger go

claim unnatural powers: physical,
emotional, moral, mental or
vegetable, and Roble residents
don't set much credence to this
theory.
You never see the Green
Avenger eating at Roble, which is
another proof that he is a right-on
cookie, but now and then he
stalks over to see his old buddy,
the Mad Rapist, just to have a
warm beer and reminisce.
"Hey Greenie, remember that
time we cruised up to Mills and
picked up those chickies?"
"The old Canine Patrol?"
"Yeah, heh, heh. What a
night."
"Yeah, what a night."
"Yeah."
"Say M. R.. this beer is pretty
bad."
"It sure is. This beer is really
bad."
"Sure is. I had a pizza last
night. It was really, really bad."
"Yeah. Hey, wanna go outside
and shoot some baskets?"
"Nah."
"Wanna go dowr. .tairs and play
a little pingpong for Chairman
Mao."
"Nah. Can't ruin my rep in the
dorm."

"Hey, I know a chickie that's
really hot for you, Greenie."
"Yeah?"
"Yeah, she's five feet, 180
pounds, wonderful personality, a
terrific cook."
"A dog?"
"Makes Rin Tin Tin look
sexy."
"I always went for Lassie,
myself."
"Heh, heh."
"Heh."
"Want another beer?"
"Yeah, sure."
The Green Avenger opens
another can of warm beer. He
lights a cigarette and places it
carefully at the corner of his
mouth so that it rests precariously
on his lower lip.
Will the Green Avenger's
cigarette fall into his beer?
That's what they wonder in the
halls of Roble, if they dare to
wonder at all. The Green Avenger
is mean and the Green Avenger is
baaad. The Green Avenger is cool
and catlike down the long, green
halls of Roble.
Nobody messes with the Green
Avenger.


"Hit 'em again! Hit 'em again! Harder! Harder!"
