## Franklin's Political Trial 
### 
One type of political trial is
one where the decision to
prosecute was based on political
factors, where there would have
been no trial had the defendant's
views and political aims been in
line with those of the prosecuting
authority. A comparison of the
charges lodged against Franklin
with generically similar actions by
others, where University
prosecution was never even
considered, shows that Franklin's
was a political trial.
The key factor is whether the
alleged free speech threat, illegal
incitement, or actual disruption
was on behalf of present
University policies or in
opposition to them.
Franklin was charged with
disrupting a University function
and preventing Lodge from
speaking. No charges were filed
against those who halted
Franklin's classes and ordered him
barred from campus. The reasons
for and the means of causing the
two disruptions were different;
the results were cut from the same
cloth. (Certainly it is as
demonstrable at a fair adversary
hearing that Lodge committed
war crimes for which his worst
punishment will be heavy
heckling, as it would have been
that Franklin was a danger to the
campus. Neither action is more
clearly justifiable before trial of
the "disrupter" than the other.)
Franklin was found guilty of
using words at White Plaza that he
must have known would increase
the risk of students halting normal
business at the computer center
and even damaging it. No action
has been taken against those who
did not merely incite, but actually
locked the doors of
administration offices last week,
in the face of two students who
wanted to go through legitimate
channels and discuss the Franklin
case with officials.
This was a disruption of a
University function at least as
important as computer
operations, and it, too, was
accomplished in circumstances
where it increased the risk that the
400 angry and dangerous activists
waiting nearby would commit
lawless and violent acts. Either

disruption may or may not be
justifiable at a fair hearing; the
point is that only one was
prosecuted.
Franklin was found guilty of
shouting his arguments on the
illegality of a police dispersal
order in a way that he should have
known would increase the risk of
people's defying that order. No
one has been charged with
inciting or aiding and abetting
daily war crimes.
A number of people have made
vociferous statements supporting
the legitimacy of campus
recruiting by weapons
manufactures. It is certainly
arguable that these people should
have known that they were
increasing the risk of industrial
recruiters' defying international
laws of war by coming here to
convince people to help them
build better weapons for
murdering Indochinese. Both the
alleged inciters' good faith and the
difficult questions of legality
would be arguable at a trial of
either case, but Franklin's is the
only one that will be tried.
Franklin was found guilty of
increasing the likelihood of
imminent lawless action by
making speeches at the Old Union
wh :h were aimed at increasing
hostility towards the police and
the University and urging, in
general terms, action to combat
the objectionable work of those
forces
No one faces similar changes
for calling police to the hospital
last spring. Yet that direct
incitement came under
circumstances where it was
foreseeable that the police would
convert a nearly completed,
peaceful protest and productive
negotiations into a bloody brawl
and that serious injuries and
damage to the building would
result.
Some may think that
increasing the risk of such police
behavior is somehow more
justifiable than increasing the risk
of student disruptions, but only
one alleged inciter has been called
upon to justify his actions.
Finally, despite spending so
much of our money for
investigators, photographers, and

law association

prosecutors, the University could
only come up with incitement
charges against Franklin. What
action has it taken against the
criminals among the police, those
who go beyond illegal incitement
and manage to club unresisting
Stanford students virtually every
time they are called to campus to
"prevent disturbances"?
When conduct threatening free
speech, disrupting university
functions, or encouraging illegal
action for political ends, is
thought to be done as a challenge
to University policies or its
present role in society, the full
thrust of the University's
law-and-order machine is aimed to
rid us of the offender. When
conduct falling into the same
categories, or even physical
attacks on people and property, are
done in the name of defending the
established order, the very
suggestion of prosecution sounds
ludicrous.
This is what we mean when we
say that Franklin's trial was a
political trial, for his alleged
infractions have been identified
for prosecution according to
highly political criteria.
(The foregoing is a column by the
officers of the Stanford Law
Association, Michael Goldstein,
Edward Hayes, and Priscilla Fox.
The fourth officer, Beth Jay, joins
in the disagreement with the
Board's action but does not fully
concur in the above analysis.)

daily war crimes.
A number of people have made
vociferous statements supporting
the legitimacy of campus
recruiting by weapons
manufactures. It is certainly
arguable that these people should
have known that they were
increasing the risk of industrial
recruiters' defying international
laws of war by coming here to
convince people to help them
build better weapons for
murdering Indochinese. Both the
alleged inciters' good faith and the
difficult questions of legality
would be arguable at a trial of
either case, but Franklin's is the
only one that will be tried.
Franklin was found guilty of
increasing the likelihood of
imminent lawless action by
making speeches at the Old Union
wh :h were aimed at increasing
hostility towards the police and
the University and urging, in
general terms, action to combat
the objectionable work of those
forces
No one faces similar changes
for calling police to the hospital
last spring. Yet that direct
incitement came under
circumstances where it was
foreseeable that the police would
convert a nearly completed,
peaceful protest and productive
negotiations into a bloody brawl
and that serious injuries and
damage to the building would
result.
Some may think that
increasing the risk of such police
behavior is somehow more
justifiable than increasing the risk
of student disruptions, but only
one alleged inciter has been called
upon to justify his actions.
Finally, despite spending so
much of our money for
investigators, photographers, and

law association

prosecutors, the University could
only come up with incitement
charges against Franklin. What
action has it taken against the
criminals among the police, those
who go beyond illegal incitement
and manage to club unresisting
Stanford students virtually every
time they are called to campus to
"prevent disturbances"?
When conduct threatening free
speech, disrupting university
functions, or encouraging illegal
action for political ends, is
thought to be done as a challenge
to University policies or its
present role in society, the full
thrust of the University's
law-and-order machine is aimed to
rid us of the offender. When
conduct falling into the same
categories, or even physical
attacks on people and property, are
done in the name of defending the
established order, the very
suggestion of prosecution sounds
ludicrous.
This is what we mean when we
say that Franklin's trial was a
political trial, for his alleged
infractions have been identified
for prosecution according to
highly political criteria.

Tomorrow: The Results
One type of political trial is
one where the decision to
prosecute was based on political
factors, where there would have
been no trial had the defendant's
views and political aims been in
line with those of the prosecuting
authority. A comparison of the
charges lodged against Franklin
with generically similar actions by
others, where University
prosecution was never even
considered, shows that Franklin's
was a political trial.
The key factor is whether the
alleged free speech threat, illegal
incitement, or actual disruption
was on behalf of present
University policies or in
opposition to them.
Franklin was charged with
disrupting a University function
and preventing Lodge from
speaking. No charges were filed
against those who halted
Franklin's classes and ordered him
barred from campus. The reasons
for and the means of causing the
two disruptions were different;
the results were cut from the same
cloth. (Certainly it is as
demonstrable at a fair adversary
hearing that Lodge committed
war crimes for which his worst
punishment will be heavy
heckling, as it would have been
that Franklin was a danger to the
campus. Neither action is more
clearly justifiable before trial of
the "disrupter" than the other.)
Franklin was found guilty of
using words at White Plaza that he
must have known would increase
the risk of students halting normal
business at the computer center
and even damaging it. No action
has been taken against those who
did not merely incite, but actually
locked the doors of
administration offices last week,
in the face of two students who
wanted to go through legitimate
channels and discuss the Franklin
case with officials.
This was a disruption of a
University function at least as
important as computer
operations, and it, too, was
accomplished in circumstances
where it increased the risk that the
400 angry and dangerous activists
waiting nearby would commit
lawless and violent acts. Either

disruption may or may not be
justifiable at a fair hearing; the
point is that only one was
prosecuted.
Franklin was found guilty of
shouting his arguments on the
illegality of a police dispersal

Tomorrow: The Results
One type of political trial is
one where the decision to
prosecute was based on political
factors, where there would have
been no trial had the defendant's
views and political aims been in
line with those of the prosecuting
authority. A comparison of the
charges lodged against Franklin
with generically similar actions by
others, where University
prosecution was never even
considered, shows that Franklin's
was a political trial.
The key factor is whether the
alleged free speech threat, illegal
incitement, or actual disruption
was on behalf of present
University policies or in
opposition to them.
Franklin was charged with
disrupting a University function
and preventing Lodge from
speaking. No charges were filed
against those who halted
Franklin's classes and ordered him
barred from campus. The reasons
for and the means of causing the
two disruptions were different;
the results were cut from the same
cloth. (Certainly it is as
demonstrable at a fair adversary
hearing that Lodge committed
war crimes for which his worst
punishment will be heavy
heckling, as it would have been
that Franklin was a danger to the
campus. Neither action is more
clearly justifiable before trial of
the "disrupter" than the other.)
Franklin was found guilty of
using words at White Plaza that he
must have known would increase
the risk of students halting normal
business at the computer center
and even damaging it. No action
has been taken against those who
did not merely incite, but actually
locked the doors of
administration offices last week,
in the face of two students who
wanted to go through legitimate
channels and discuss the Franklin
case with officials.
This was a disruption of a
University function at least as
important as computer
operations, and it, too, was
accomplished in circumstances
where it increased the risk that the
400 angry and dangerous activists
waiting nearby would commit
lawless and violent acts. Either

disruption may or may not be
justifiable at a fair hearing; the
point is that only one was
prosecuted.
Franklin was found guilty of
shouting his arguments on the
illegality of a police dispersal
order in a way that he should have
known would increase the risk of
people's defying that order. No
one has been charged with
inciting or aiding and abetting
daily war crimes.
A number of people have made
vociferous statements supporting
the legitimacy of campus
recruiting by weapons
manufactures. It is certainly
arguable that these people should
have known that they were
increasing the risk of industrial
recruiters' defying international
laws of war by coming here to
convince people to help them
build better weapons for
murdering Indochinese. Both the
alleged inciters' good faith and the
difficult questions of legality
would be arguable at a trial of
either case, but Franklin's is the
only one that will be tried.
Franklin was found guilty of
increasing the likelihood of
imminent lawless action by
making speeches at the Old Union
wh :h were aimed at increasing
hostility towards the police and
the University and urging, in
general terms, action to combat
the objectionable work of those
forces
No one faces similar changes
for calling police to the hospital
last spring. Yet that direct
incitement came under
circumstances where it was
foreseeable that the police would
convert a nearly completed,
peaceful protest and productive
negotiations into a bloody brawl
and that serious injuries and
damage to the building would
result.
Some may think that
increasing the risk of such police
behavior is somehow more
justifiable than increasing the risk
of student disruptions, but only
one alleged inciter has been called
upon to justify his actions.
Finally, despite spending so
much of our money for
investigators, photographers, and

law association

prosecutors, the University could
only come up with incitement
charges against Franklin. What
action has it taken against the
criminals among the police, those
who go beyond illegal incitement
and manage to club unresisting
Stanford students virtually every
time they are called to campus to
"prevent disturbances"?
When conduct threatening free
speech, disrupting university
functions, or encouraging illegal
action for political ends, is
thought to be done as a challenge
to University policies or its
present role in society, the full
thrust of the University's
law-and-order machine is aimed to
rid us of the offender. When
conduct falling into the same
categories, or even physical
attacks on people and property, are
done in the name of defending the
established order, the very
suggestion of prosecution sounds
ludicrous.
This is what we mean when we
say that Franklin's trial was a
political trial, for his alleged
infractions have been identified
for prosecution according to
highly political criteria.
