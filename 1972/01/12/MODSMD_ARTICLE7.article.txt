# Japan's New Economy
## 
### 
Many—if hardly all—of the
economic problems that forced
Nixon into adopting his New
Economic Policy (NEP) began in
the way the United States
structured Japan into its post
World War II plans for dominating
Asia.
In essence, the US used its
power during the Occupation to
construct an expansionist
Japanese economy; Washington
hoped that Japan's resulting need
to expand overseas would interest
the Japanese in keeping
communism out of Asia and thus
keep the area open to foreign
investment and exports.

However, Japan's expansion
has led to a basic contradiction:
while it shares US interest in
anticommunism, its imperialist
economy is seizing major US
markets and investment
opportunities. Japan thus bears
considerable responsibility for US

international economic troubles,
centered in the balance of
payments deficit and especially in
the unprecedented trade deficit.
Serious antagonism has resulted.
Thirty years ago, the roots of
the US war with Japan lay in a
conflict between Japanese
expansion and American
determination to keep the Open
Door in Asia for US trade and
investment.
A constant postwar US
objective was to dominate Asia.
To do this at a relatively small
cost required a major ally to
police the area and help put down
nationalist rebellions.
During the abortive attempt to
strengthen Chiang Kai-shek for
the role of US ally, Japan was
weakened. The former rival's
industry was being broken into
small units, the ruling class nearly
bankrupted, and labor unions
strengthened. Washington did not
want a resumption of the rivalry
that brought World War 11.
By late 1947, however,
increasing Communist victories in
China made it clear that the China
tactic would not work, and the
US quickly reversed course. This
involved reconstructing the
Japanese economy in an
imperialist form.
The great prewar corporations
(e.g. Mitsubishi) were rescued but
scarcely reformed. As before the
war, Japan's economic structure
now required overseas expansion;
this fit US plans by giving Japan a
heavy stake in preserving the
capitalist "free world." By 1950
Dean Acheson would be trying to
integrate Japan's economy into
SE Asia and Dulles would ask the
former enemy to rearm.
The expansionist Japanese
economy which Washington
desired has come to haunt the US.
During the 1950's the US tried tot
direct Japan's exports to SE Asia
and even here to prevent Tokyo |
from returning to its prewar i
economic ties with China. The
policy worked so well that it
backfired. In 1971, Japan had a
staggering 2 1/2 billion dollar
export surplus to America
creating a very serious balance of
payments problem for the US.
The Japanese are also shutting
out US exports elsewhere in the
world. Rapidly taking over
traditional US markets in South

America, Japan is also expanding
exports strongly in SE Asia—with
the US picking up the tab. With a
$2 billion export surplus to that
area, Japan recently sold $200
million worth of goods to South
Vietnam (worst example) and
imported $3 million. There, as

elsewhere in the region, the
difference was partially—if
indirectly—made up by US foreign
aid.
Japan is also the top foreign
investor in Thailand and
approaching that status in South
Korea and Taiwan. In short, the
US-created Japanese imperialist
economy has again become a
dangerous threat to American
imperialism itself—and
particularly to the American
"Pacific Rim Strategy."
Nixon's NEP is in part a
counter-offensive agaist Japan. A
major aim has been to cut
Japanese exports to the US and to
force Japan to revalue the yen
upward so that American
products will become relatively
cheaper and more competitive
overseas. He has already been very
successful on revaluation, and
hopes the key international sector
will pull the economy out of its
stagnation.
Profits and unemployment are
the two big considerations. (1) US
corporations have traditionally
found foreign operations much
more profitable than domestic
ones; Nixon is helping exporters
tremendously through
revaluation. (2) Stanford trustee
Bill Eberle—Nixon's special trade
representative-believes that for
every 1% devaluation between
40,000 and 80,000 jobs will be
created in the US; "you're talking
about more than half a million
jobs when you consider an average
11% realignment." With big
profits and half a million jobs
involved, markets and overseas
expansion are what the world
financial and monetary crisis is all
about.
This is hitting a Japan already
gripped by a severe economic
slump. (West Germany is also

facing rising unemployment and a
scant 1% increase in GNP this
year). Still, most Japanese
business and government leaders
have been making sincere efforts
to be agreeable, in order to avoid
all-out economic war.
The New Economic Policy and
revaluation will strike the
Japanese really hard sometime
this spring. It should reduce
somewhat that 30% of Japanese
exports which go to the US and
also should make US goods more
competitive in foreign markets.
Moreover, as Business Week (20 N
71) points out, "since counries
such as the Philippines, Taiwan,
and Korea also will be adversely
affected by US polici&s, the
Japanese will sell less to those
areas as well." It's not surprising
that Japanese Foreign Minister
Takeo Fukuda called the
revaluation "the greatest
economic shock" suffered by his
country since World War 11.
The Japanese economy (like
the American) cannot survive
without expanding overseas. In
doing so, it has to compete against
the US for crucial markets.
Since the international
capitalist economy is basically a
closed system, what the US gains
will be lost by others like Japan
and West Germany. With their
economies already in recessions,
the Japanese and Europeans
cannot be expected to suffer for
Washington's benefit for very
long.
Although America's greatest
strength has produced
considerable gains with i
revaluation that should
temporarily boost the US
economy, Japan and Germany
will have to strike back
eventually. This will mean j
increasingly severe competition |
and much deeper economic j
problems for both the US and its:
competitors.
Even though Nixon and Sato :
have agreed on Okinawa, the ;
surcharge is over, and the global '
monetary system is temporarily j
stable, the basic contradiction is
still there: Both the US and Japan
must constantly expand their
exports and foreign investments
but there just is not room for
both of them. Washington,
desiring an Asian junior partner,
created an imperialist competitor
which can be expected to give its
own imperialism more trouble in i
years to come.
