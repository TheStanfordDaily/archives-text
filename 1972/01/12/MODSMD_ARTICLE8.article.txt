# research freedom?
## If No DoD Funds 
### 
Research in certain fields is so
costly that it virtually cannot
exist without outside funding.
Junior faculty members must do
research even to hope for tenure,
and thus they must seek funding.
However, in some fields,
particularly Engineering, Applied
Physics and Computer Science,
the funding is dominated by an
agen y whose well-organized
program supports research and
development with a high mission
orientation.
What if a junior faculty
member, exercising his freedom
"to select the subject matter of
his research," doesn't want to
study what that funding agency
wants studied? Does he in fact
have any such freedom to select
the subject matter of his research,
keeping in mind that if he doesn't
do research, he won't get
promoted?
A solution was once proposed:
a tax on research contracts to
create a fund to support scholars

who, motivated by their scientific
consciences and a desire for the
respect of their fellow experts,
wanted to study something which
the dominating agency was not
intersted in. The problem here is
that Congress wouldn't stand for
it, and if such a tax were placed
on the contracts, they would be
taxed out of existence. So be it,
say those who value the right to
select a research area above the
right to seek funding anywhere.
Consider, however, what would
happen if sponsored research
stopped: The University would
lose roughly $50 million worth of
sponsored projects. Most
non-tenured personnel involved,
including graduate students,
would be laid off. About 40% of
the $50 million goes toward
salaries. At a rate of $10,000 per
worker, 2000 employees would be
fired as a direct result of the
termination. Furthermore, $11
million in indirect cost recovery
would vanish, and all tenured
faculty taking salary offsets (a
provision whereby a sizeable
fraction of a faculty member's
salary is paid by a contract) would
return to full pay status,
increasing Stanford's financial
burden by another $3 million.
Many more of the non-tenured
would probably lose their jobs
then because of the tremendous
($l4 million) consequent
imbalance in the Operating
Budget. If spending were not cut
drastically, the $5 million savings
account would evaporate in four
months, and consumption of the
endowment would begin. In other
words, arguments over the
principles of research would
become meaningless, for without
sponsored research Stanford
would become a ghost town in a
matter of months.
