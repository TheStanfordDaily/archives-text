## Protecting Freedom 
### 
Reprinted from yesterday's edition.
The recommenda' : on by a seven-man faculty
advisory board al Stai lord University that a tenured
professor be dismissed for repeatedly inciting
students to "the use of illegal coercion and
violence" is a matter of utmost gravity in the
nation's academic community. If the Board of
Trustees follows suit, this would be the first such
step by a major university in the context of recent
campus unrest.
Although the professor's defenders have
predictably charged that the 5-to-2 faculty
recommendation is a violation of academic freedom,
massive evidence shows that it is quite the opposite:
a painful but necessary attempt to protect such
freedom against coercion and disruption from
within the academy.
H. Bruce Franklin, an associate professor of
English, has long and publicly encouraged students
to commit illegal acts. He urged actions that
threated injury to persons, damage to property and
interference with the lawful activities of other
members of the community. He has in effect cried
"fire" in a crowded theater. His conduct has been
cowardly as well as irresponsible, manipulating
students, endangering their own safety and
damaging their future careers. It makes pawns of
vulnerable young men and women, while the
professor as instigator seeks immunity behind the
shield of tenure.

At no time has Professor Franklin's Maoist
ideology been an issue. What is at stake is the
university's right physically to protect itself. The
senior faculty panel's painstaking deliberations,
after six weeks of hearings of more than 100
witnesses, led to the unimpeachable conclusion that
incitement to illegal conduct is "an abuse of power"
rendered particularly serious when it ignores a
teacher's responsibility toward his students. In a
flagrant instance last February, a student
occupation of the university's Computation Center
followed Dr. Franklin's appeal for just such a
take-over.
The panel's two dissenting members disagreed
with the majority only with regard to the severity of
the penalty. Their counsel of leniency might be
supported had the offense been an aberration of
momentary passion. But Professor Franklin's
consistent contempt for the foundations of a free,
rational and non-violent community was
unmistakably reaffirmed when he responded to the
faculty verdict with a call for "revolutionary
counter-violence," while his wife "symbolically"
stood by his side with a rifle.
A better symbol of the universities'
determination to uphold freedom through
self-government under law will be Stanford's notice
that neither tenure nor inflammatory rhetoric
constitutes a license for coercive and illegal action.
