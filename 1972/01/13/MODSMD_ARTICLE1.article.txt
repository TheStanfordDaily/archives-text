# Campus Housing Helps
## Married Life Harried, Comfortable 
### JANE BUSSEY First in a series 
Starting or continuing married life as a Stanford
student may not insure connubial bliss, but the large
number of married students show that marital
bonds are among the most popular commodities at
Stanford.
More than one half of all graduate students are
married, while only about one student in 30 is
married on the undergraduate level.
Of the 6,431 undergraduate students
matriculated fall quarter, only 220 listed themselves
as married, including 137 men and 83 women.
Among the 5,072 graduate students enrolled the
same quarter, 2,659 were married. Proportionately
more male graduate students are married (2,347 out
of 4,227) than female graduate students (272 out of
845).
Stanford's married students lead varying lives, but
from the newly married couples living off campus,
to the older couples with families returning from
the community to complete a degree, all agree that
married life at Stanford is unique.
"It's a big change," commented law student Peter
Borak on the difference between married graduate
life and his single undergraduate years at Stanford.
"If you go back to the idea of Stanford as being sort
of a lonely place, then being married means some of
the frustrations of undergraduate life aren't present.
Besides, there's always somebody to do something
with and to talk to."
Time Limit
Marriage for some graduate students limits the
time and necessity for friendships. "It was harder to
make friends, but there's also a lot less social

pressure on you, and you get a lot more studying
done," said Diane Harrison now a secretary in the
Academic Planning office.
She explained that she and her husband did not
know other students when they came here for
graduate school, and did not meet the other married
couples living in their dormitory until the end of the
year.
Totally Different'
Combining graduate school with marriage and a
family makes "the University a totally different
experience from the undergraduate years," she
added.
"Graduate students are so busy with their work
that they don't have time to socialize," said Laurie
Chertock, an Escondido Village resident. "I can't
imagine continuing the social life I carried on in
college."
Stephanie Beach, president of the Escondido
Village Family Council, agreed that graduate school
involves more time and pressures for married
students. "It's a far different bag from just having a
nine-to-five job, and the wife not only has to take
care of the house, children and maybe a job, but
also has to provide a lot of support to withstand
academic pressures."
Housing
A major problem facing students with families is
getting housing on campus. Presently most married
students are housed in Escondido Village. Helen
Meyer, executive secretary at Escondido, explained
that students sometimes wait up to 15 months for a
one-bedroom apartment and nine months for a
two-bedroom apartment.
Living in student housing is a large benefit for the

students and their children. Kor those couples living
as far away as Mountain View, moving into
Escondido has eliminated the endless commuting
along El Camino. When the new dormitory complex
is finished, 151 new married-student apartments will
be available.
Stanford provides a day care center and
elementary schools are located nearby for faculty
and student offspring. "Escondido is great for the
kids," Beach said, "because they're used to a social
community around Escondido. They adjust faster
when they first attend school."
Escondido Different
"Living in Escondido is very different from living
in a public community. Handling of problems as far
as the administration goes is different," Beach said.
"The Family Council works out social problems
that grow out of living in such a tight situation."
The family council functions as a sounding board
for complaints "mostly involving behavior problems
of children and sometimes of adults." Beach said
that, although Escondido Village residents tend to
be "more conservative and private in their affairs,"
concern for the effect of biocides on children
stimulated a drive to control the use of pesticides in
the Escondido area.
Marriage alleviates some of the social pressures of
single undergraduate life, and some members of the
University community are working to eliminate
pressures on married students since so many couples
are deciding to continue their education.
"If anything, Escondido helps," Beach said. "It
tends to be very supportive because you know
you're all in the same boat with academic and
personal pressures."
