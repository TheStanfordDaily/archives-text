The statement from five
students in African history
printed in yesterday's Daily had a
line dropped from the last
paragraph. It should have read:
As students who feel a strong
moral commitment to the
liberation of the Third World, we
must protest against the
administration's double-standard
of academic freedom.
Finally, we join Professors
Brown, Kennedy and Guerrard in
expressing our deep concern
about the possible ill effects of
the Board's recommendation on
other educational institutions. If
this decision becomes a precedent
for firing politically dissident
tenured professors elsewhere, we
shall surely have passed another
milestone on the road to some
American version of fascism.
