# New Course Review Staff
## 
### 
If you were a freshman last
quarter, and looked through the
time schedule trying to find some
good courses, you could have used
a course review. If you have taken
some courses that were so bad
that you would rather not think
about them, you could have used
a course review.
If you have ever heard about a
really good course or instructor
after it was too late to take the
course, you could have used a
course review. We think that every
student at Stanford fits into one
of these categories, and that every
student could have used, and still
could use, a course review.
A course review is not to be
confused with the course
abstracts, which are simply a short
description of the syllabus of
various courses. A course review is
an evaluation of courses, written
by students who have previously
taken the course. By consulting
this handy little publication, you
would be able to tell how

successful a course turned out to
be the last time it was offered,
and whether it is worth taking.
"We" are the members of the
Education Committee of the
ASSU Council of Presidents. We
are all students; we do not deal
with administration or faculty.

Our primary concern is the
publication of a course review as
described above, simply to help
students in the selection of their
courses.
To do this we need help. We
need information, evaluations of
courses, suggestions regarding
which courses to evaluate, bodies
to help with the mechanics of
editing and publication. Our most

pressing immediate need is
manpower to help with
information gathering, and
compilation of that information
into a useable form.
We want to evaluate the 20
most popular courses during both
Spring and Fall of 1971. About

7000 students enrolled in these
courses each quarter. We will ask a
random sampling of these
students to answer a standard set
of questions which will allow us
to formulate an essay about the
course which will be fair to the
Professor, as well as useful to a
student using the Course Review.
If you would like to help, we
need you. Please drop by the
ASSU office and leave your name
with the Secretary or call x 4331.
Any questions should be directed
to Anne Kimball of the ASSU
Council of Presidents.
