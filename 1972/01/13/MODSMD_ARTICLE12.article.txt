Second of Two Parts
The results of the Franklin
case, typical of political trials, are
fourfold, and they are all clear
from a careful reading of the
Advisory Board report.
The first is simple bias in the
evaluation of conflicting
testimony. The majority of the
Board obstinately clung to the
ability to be "strongly persuaded"
on the basis of totally ambiguous
data. They did this,
unconsciously, we hope, by
systematically believing
prosecution witnesses where
credible testimony conflicted,and
by consistently using questionable
logical inferences to resolve
uncertainties resolving them
against Franklin. (They even read
defense witnesses' statements of
failure to see Franklin engaged in
the alleged misconduct as saying
failure to be looking at Franklin
at the relevant times!)
Virtually every time that there
was more than one plausible
conclusion as to what Franklin
did, said, or meant, the Board's
majority reiterated the turbulence
of the circumstances and the
nature of Franklin's radical
ideology to justify its adopting
the most damning theory. With all
their emphasis upon Franklin's
world-view, they failed to notice
how their own affected their
judgment at a political trial.
(It should be added that it was
totally inexcusable for the Board
to pressure Franklin to shorten his
case and force him not to call
some of his witnesses, in a
situation where they did not
believe that prosecution
testimony had yet been refuted.
Those working for the defense
were wondering how many
politically suspect students it took
to counter one administration
witness. Apparently the Board
concluded at some point that it
would not believe Franklin's side
of the story, no matter how many
witnesses agreed with his version
of the events in controversy.)
Quasi-legal
Second in case its perspective
on the facts was not enough to
convict Franklin, the Board
adopted quasi-legal standards that
are nothing short of outrageous to
anyone familiar with the
safeguards of First Amendment
law. Both the administration and
the Board claimed that the
University will not threaten free
expression any more than the
government may, and then they
both promptly threw away the
doctrines developed through fifty
years of First-Amendment
litigation.
Thus, the Board agrees that
enforcement of a vague standard
or an overbroad one (one that
purports to outlaw both
unprotected incitement and forms
of protected speech) could deter
legitimate expression. The Board
agrees that government should
protect free speech by refraining
from enforcing such rules, even
against one who could be
punished under a more specific
and narrowly-drawn standard.
Then it dismisses all of this as
irrelevant by saying that, even
though "substantial and manifest
neglect of duty, or personal
conduct substantially impairing
the individual's performance of

his appropriate function," may be
both vague and overbroad if
thought to apply to Franklin's
alleged conduct, there is no
problem because "the regulation
invokes a web of largely unwritten
rules as tough and living as the
British Constitution."
Political Thorn
"Tough," "Living," and
"unwritten" rules are exactly
what Franklin stands convicted of
violating. Such "rules," stated
only when it is time to remove a
political thorn from the
University's side, are vagueness
and overbreadth raised to
perfection.
They are hardly well adapted
for maintaining free expression by
letting people know what
contemplated conduct or
expression is punishable and what
may be said or done without fear.
When a university claims it can set
much lower standards for
maintaining free expression than
government sets for itself, that
university cannot credibly call
itself a center of academic
freedom.
The Board also made its
decision easier by playing similar
havoc with another key legal
standard, the definition of
incitement.
Brandenburg Standard
The three charges of which
Franklin was found guilty were all
based on "intentionally urging
and inciting" various behavior,
and the Board quotes the
punishable advocacy standard of
Brandenburg v. Ohio: the speech
must "be directed to inciting or
producing imminent lawless
action, and . .. likely to produce
such action."
But the Board tacitly scraps
the purpose or intent element of
the offense, needing proof only of
the second requirement, that the
speech was foreseeably "likely to
produce" the proscribed action. It
did this by simply presuming
purpose or intent whenever it
found speech that, from today's
perspective, appeared likely to
produce such action, thereby
eliminating the need for any
actual evidence of intent.
Therefore a reckless or even
negligent failure to foresee that
his words would "increase the
likelihood of illegal occupation of
the Computation Center,"
"increase the risk of personal
injury" to people hearing his
arguments that they were lawfully
assembled outside the
Computation Center, or "increase
the likelihood of imminent lawful
action" after the Old Union rally,
becomes equivalent to intentional
incitement.
True Standard
This is truly the standard

which the Board adopted, for it
contents itself, on each charge,
with finding that Franklin must
"reasonably have expected" that
he was increasing the risk of the
occurence of the events he is
charged with inciting. (Failure to
develop reasonable expectations is
the legal definition of negligence.)
Then there comes the pro forma
statement that the Board is
strongly persuaded that Franklin
"intentionally incited" the
forbidden action.
In so doing, the Board creates a
new crime of "negligent
incitement" that no honest court
in the country would uphold
against a First-Amendment
challenge. Moreover, under the
'' foreseeably-increasing-the
likelihood" standard, a mere
recitation of facts,
unaccompanied by any urging to
action, can amount to
"intentional incitement and
urging," if those facts would be
likely to anger the crowd being
addressed. (Indeed, in finding
Franklin's speeches punishable,
the Board stresses in several places
that the portions of those
speeches directing attention to the
University's role in furthering the
war could have the affect of
justifying strong protest against
Stanford.)
On Notice
In other words, every radical
faculty member who chooses to
remain here has been put on
notice. If, during a period of
campus demonstrations, he does
so much as criticize or even make
factual revelations about
controversial Stanford policies, so
that an Advisory Board might
later think his discussion of issues
could foreseeably have heightened
the risk of disruption, it will be
presumed that he sought to cause
disruptions.
Then he can be canned for
"intentionally urging and
inciting" disruption. The only
possible grounds for arguing that
this approach will not
significantly "heighten the risk"
of inhibiting expression about
controversial issues is to note that
there are few radical faculty
members to worry about
inhibiting. Certainly we do not
have to worry about any more
coming.
Standards like these, where
words like vagueness, overbreadth,
and incitement are completely
redefined to the detriment of the
defendant, are found only when
there is a strong feeling before
trial that the defendant is
probably too dangerous to remain
in the community, a situation
common to most political trials.
Who's Right
The third failing the Board

made as a consequence of its
hearing a political case was its
refusal to consider whether, even
if Franklin had committed the
acts he was accused of, he might
not have been right in doing so. It
is recognized that those who
refuse to obey unconstitutional
racial segregation statutes are not
lawbreakers.
Similarly, people who destroy
draft records used to obtain
conscripts for a war waged in
violation of the Constitution,
international law on military
intervention, and the law of war
regarding tactics against civilians,
should have a legally airtight
defense against the felony of
interfering with the draft. (This
conclusion follows from the
doctrines that acts cannot be
punished if they violate being
used to further unconstituional
purposes or if justified by their
prevention of more serious crimes.
Their only problem is that no
court in the country will permit
the introduction of evidence
concerning these matters, since
the crime is a political one.
Justification
Franklin's problem was the
same. Any jury whom he could
win over to his belief that the
University is a knowing and
obstinate accomplice to America's
lawless, violent, murderous
imposition of its neo-imperialist
hegemony over much of the rest
of the world might well conclude
that the tactics Franklin was
accused of were justified and that
the University should radically
change its very nature, rather than
banish the protesters.
But Franklin never had the
chance to present evidence
pertinent to the issue of
justification. Such evidence could
have been immediately ruled
beyond the scope of the hearings,
as, of course, it was.
Finally, despite the mandatory
disclaimers, the majority of the

Board succumbed to the
temptation to determine a
political defendant's punishment
according to the dangerousness of
his beliefs, rather than his actions.
After a long discourse on factors
relevant to determination of
sanctions, the majority ignores the
analysis that convicned the
dissenters that temporary
suspension without pay will serve
as a serious enough warning to
keep Franklin and others from
overstepping the boundaries in the
future.
Nor does the majority permit
their verbal reaffirmation of the
University's openness to
ideological challenge to make
them tread carefully in meting out
punishment or to give the
dissenters' predictions the benefit
of the doubt.
Long Winded
In their long-winded discussion
of sanctions, we could find only
two statements of why dismissal is
the necessary sanction: (1)
"Professor Franklin's announced
convictions about the guilt of the
university appear deeply-held, and
his opposition to the institution in
its present form seems inplacable.
.. . Barring a dramatic change in
perception, he is unlikely to
change this conduct. . . (2)
"But a lesser penalty would fail to
recognize the fundamental nature
and severity of Professor
Franklin's attacks on the
University of which he is a
member."
The first statement ignores the
minority's suggestion that lesser
penalties would at least change
Franklin's perception of what
conduct the University will
tolerate. Instead, the Board
merely assumes that ideological
"opposition to the University in
its present form" must inevitably
lead to intolerable action.
Therefore Franklin's beliefs
themselves are sufficient proof

that the University cannot
tolerate his continued presence.
Political Test
The political test summarized
by the second statement is more
subtle but just as important. What
makes the "attacks" the majority
thinks Franklin committed so
fundamental and severe is not this
alleged use of proscribed means,
but his use of those means in an
attempt to reorient the University
to serve different classes of people
than it serves today.
Franklin was charged with
inciting disruptions aimed at
provoking a radical reexamination
of this University's role in society.
The actions he is said to have
incited are in themselves no more
dangerous than ones which
have received no official
condemnation.
All that gives Franklin's alleged
incitements their "fundamental
nature and severity" is their
political goals, which happen to
be the opposite of the political
goals of anti-movement
disruption and violence. It is the
goals, not the tactics, which
define the need for punishment.

Thus, despite all its piaties, the
Board has found that Franklin's
politics rate the choice of
dismissal over lesser penalties.
This has a highly political
prosecution, and neither the
serious but unrecognized bias in
evaluating evidence, nor the
creation of outrageous new legal
standards to meet fears of
Franklin and the movement with
which he is assocaited, nor the
exclusion of evidence on the
political context as possible
justification for the "offenses,"
nor the decision that a man's
political beliefs are relevant in
sentencing him should have come
as much of a surprise.
Still, we, like the Board itself,
had been taken in by the show of
due process, so we had hoped for
something a little better than
what emerged.

Association, Michael Goldstein,

Board's action but does not fully
concur in the above analysis.)
