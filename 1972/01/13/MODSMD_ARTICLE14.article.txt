# Keio Committee Plans Exchange Program
## 
### 
This summer, as for the past
summers since 1956, twelve
Stanford students will participate
in Stanford's annual cultural
exchange program with Keio
University inTokyo.
The summer progam is
organized by the student-run
Institute of International
Relations at Keio University,
Japan's foremost private
university. Planned activities
include living with a Japanese
family in Tokyo, meeting and
ecchanging ideas with Japanese
students, discussing current events
in Japan's coniety and exonomu
with Keio professors, visiting a
Zen monastery for several days,
living for four or five days in a
farming villiage, and extensive
independent travel to Kyoto,
Nara, the mountains and ocean.
The exchange is primarily a
cultural one, with no formal
academic work. Under the
program, the 12 Stanford students
will visit Japan for approximately
two months, July and August.
There are no language
prerequisities for the program,
although knowledge of even a

little Japanese would be helpful.
Any Stanford student may apply.
The main criteria for selection are
interest in Japan and ability to
adjust to a foreign home
environment.
The twelve Stanford students
who are selected to go to Keio
University will act as "host
brothers" or sisters" to twelve
Japanese students from Keio here
at Stanford this spring. The Keio
students will be living on campus -
with Stanford families and then in
either dorms or fraternities in
their first experience with a
residence university.
The twelve Stanford students
who participated in last summer's
Keio program included graduate
and undergraduate students. With
a disparate background on
interests, they found living in
Tokyo with Japanese families a
conducive way to avoid the
"group tour" existance.
Applications, which must be
completed by Monday, January
19, are available in the office of
Lagunita Hall. More information
on the Stanford Keio exchange is
included with the application.
