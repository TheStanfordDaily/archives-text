# Dance Theater Of Harlem Gives Two Performances
## 
### 
The Winter Quarter cultural
program of the Office of Public
Events begins tonight when the
highly-acclaimed Dance Theatre
of Harlem gives the first of its two
campus performances tonight at 8
p.m. in Memorial Auditorium.
The troupe's second performance
will be tomorrow night, again at 8
p.m. in Mem Aud.
Under the direction of Arthur
Mitchell, former lead dancer with
the New York City Ballet, the
three-year old troupe has quickly
established itself as one of the
world's leading dance companies.
The Harlem group is the first
all-black American classical ballet
company.
Last summer, Dance Theatre
was the resident ballet company
at the Festival of Two Worlds in
Spoleto, Italy, where it received
standing ovations lasting up to 20
minutes. Following this highly
successful engagement, the
company toured throughout Italy,
Belgium and Holland. The troupe

had to extend their engagement in
Amsterdam due to the public
clamor for tickets.
Anne Kisselgoff of The New
York Times has said, "No
company has made such progress
in so short a time." Another critic
added, "The Dance Theatre of
Harlem is to be admired not so
much for being black, but for
being a very good and most
exciting young dance troupe."
Tonight's program will consist
of George Balanchine's "Concerto
Baroeco," performed to the music
of Bach; Lester Horton's "The
Beloved,"; Balanchine's "Agon,"
performed to a score by
Stravinsky and Arthur Mitchell's
"Rhythmetron," performed to
the music of Marios Nobre.

Friday night's program will
consist of Mitchell's "Fete
Noire,"; Louis Johnson's "Forces
of Rhythm," a pure dance work
capturing the essence of ballet and
ethnic dancing styles; a Mitchell
Pas de Deux entitled "Biosfera"
and a repeat performance of
"Rhythmetron."
Tickets for the two
performances are priced from
$2-$4 general and from
$1.25-$3.25 for students. Student
rush tickets at $2 will be sold 15
minutes before curtain if
available.
Following their Stanford
engagement, the company will
give performances at UC-Berkeley
on Sunday and Monday nights.
For information on those
performances, call 642-2561.

GETTING OFF THE GROUND-Samuel Smalls is one of the dancers
in the Dance Theater of Harlem which will perform tonight and
tomorrow night at 800 p.m. in Memorial Auditorium. Tickets for the
performances are priced from $2-$4 general and from $1.25-$3.25 for
students. Student rush tickets at $2 are sold 15 minutes before curtain
if available.
The Winter Quarter cultural
program of the Office of Public
Events begins tonight when the
highly-acclaimed Dance Theatre
of Harlem gives the first of its two
campus performances tonight at 8
p.m. in Memorial Auditorium.
The troupe's second performance
will be tomorrow night, again at 8
p.m. in Mem Aud.
Under the direction of Arthur
Mitchell, former lead dancer with
the New York City Ballet, the
three-year old troupe has quickly
established itself as one of the
world's leading dance companies.
The Harlem group is the first
all-black American classical ballet
company.
Last summer, Dance Theatre
was the resident ballet company
at the Festival of Two Worlds in
Spoleto, Italy, where it received
standing ovations lasting up to 20
minutes. Following this highly
successful engagement, the
company toured throughout Italy,
Belgium and Holland. The troupe

had to extend their engagement in
Amsterdam due to the public
clamor for tickets.
Anne Kisselgoff of The New
York Times has said, "No
company has made such progress
in so short a time." Another critic
added, "The Dance Theatre of
Harlem is to be admired not so
much for being black, but for
being a very good and most
exciting young dance troupe."
Tonight's program will consist
of George Balanchine's "Concerto
Baroeco," performed to the music
of Bach; Lester Horton's "The
Beloved,"; Balanchine's "Agon,"
performed to a score by
Stravinsky and Arthur Mitchell's
"Rhythmetron," performed to
