### DOUG ARTHUR 
"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
Are Dead," Tom Stoppard's
post-Beckett interpretation of
"Hamlet," is a stroke of dramatic
genius. The idea of viewing the
grandiose events of Shakespeare's
play from the vantage point of its
two most expendable characters
delights the imagination.
The play becomes an apt
metaphor for the twentieth
century: like the two characters,
we see the world in a tailspin and
are unable to do anything about
it. The playwright isn't
heavyhanded either (the direction
is something else again); the play
reveals itself in a parabolic way
through suggestion, ambiguity,
synechdoche. And it's funny. It's
the uneasy humor of ultimate
bewilderment.
For some reason, Director
William Ball didn't trust this fine
material and added several bits of
stage business to garner laughs.
Indeed, the hand of the director
was almost always evident: in the
carefully composed stage
groupings, in the blatant stage
tricks, in the blocking. The play
waan't directed, it was shoved.
Objectionable Hamlet
Paul Shenar appeared as an
older Hamlet, which I found

objectionable. The main contrast
in the play is between
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern and
the powerful, shrewd, vicious
people of the court, to which
Hamlet belongs. As such, a more
youthful, imposing
characterization of Hamlet would
have been in order. One could
never believe that this" Hamlet was
a school buddy of R & G's. The
director's conception of the
character undercut a basic image
in the play: the glamourous
malignancy of Claudius' court.
It is true that Stoppard's
Polonius (Larry Martin) is little
more than a buffoon, but this
does not necessarily apply to the
entire court. Inept, black-robed,
helmeted standard-bearers
obscured the other characters
with their flags, and drowned out
the queen's speech. The
incompetence of the courtiers,
and the king and queen, were
expressed in small mannerisms
and facial expressions.
The only impressive thing
about the court was the elegant
costuming by Robert Fletcher.
Director Ball often staged

exciting scenes, notably the scenes
with the tragedians, to fill the
black emptiness of space. The
bare stage had only steps which
crossed diagonally up-right and a
few benches downstage. The
director seemed more adept at
handling the crowd scenes
(particularly the fabulous scene
with Claudius and Polonius,
standing between curtains,
listening to Hamlet and Ophelia
on the right, while the players
attempt to rehearse on the left)
than the scenes with the two
characters, which sometimes
dragged.
The Best Scene
Perhaps the best scene
concerned the players enactment
of the tragedy, in which two
players act Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern (they are dressed in
the same green and blue robes as
the 'real' characters) while R & G
watch. As the true characters
protest the fate of their images,
the actors playing them mimic
their movements and gestures: it's
a bizarre mirror held up to nature.
After being unsure whether they
exist or not, the double images,

not to mention the revelation that
they will be killed, frighten them.
The direction seemed to falter
at the play's conclusion, and I
think a better way could be found
to end the two 'major' characters
than merely having them stand
with dying spotlights on them.
Indeed, the whole last scene
seemed to die before it was over.
Ken Ruta as the player became
even more somber; his gruff voice
and slow movements made the
scene overly weighty.
I thoroughly enjoyed Larry
Carpenter's portrayal of
Guildenstern as he conveyed the
character's desperate try to get
some grasp of the situation.He
seemed to fully exploit the comic
possibilities of the role as well.
Marc Singer's Rosencrantz was a
trifle uniform emotionally (I
would have liked him to get angry
in the question game), yet he did
create a genuine representation of
the naive character.
Despite a few directorial
quibbles, I found the production
to be an exciting presentation of a
provocative and enthralling play.

they will be killed, frighten them.
The direction seemed to falter
at the play's conclusion, and I
think a better way could be found
to end the two 'major' characters
than merely having them stand
with dying spotlights on them.
Indeed, the whole last scene
seemed to die before it was over.
Ken Ruta as the player became
even more somber; his gruff voice
and slow movements made the
scene overly weighty.
I thoroughly enjoyed Larry
Carpenter's portrayal of
Guildenstern as he conveyed the
character's desperate try to get
some grasp of the situation.He
seemed to fully exploit the comic
possibilities of the role as well.
Marc Singer's Rosencrantz was a
trifle uniform emotionally (I
would have liked him to get angry
in the question game), yet he did
create a genuine representation of
the naive character.
Despite a few directorial
quibbles, I found the production
to be an exciting presentation of a
provocative and enthralling play.

HANGIN' AROUND—(L to R) Ken Ruta, Larry Carpenter, and Marc Singer appear in the American
Conservatory Theater's production of "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, currently in repertory
at the Geary Theater in San Francisco. "Rfc G" is appearing in the ACT repertory for an unprecedented
third season. The next performance of "R &G" will be this Saturday night at 8:30 p.m. Tickets are priced
from $5.90-$7.90. Student rush tickets at $3 are sold 15 minutes before curtain if available.
"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
Are Dead," Tom Stoppard's
post-Beckett interpretation of
"Hamlet," is a stroke of dramatic
genius. The idea of viewing the
grandiose events of Shakespeare's
play from the vantage point of its
two most expendable characters
delights the imagination.
The play becomes an apt
metaphor for the twentieth
century: like the two characters,
we see the world in a tailspin and
are unable to do anything about
it. The playwright isn't
heavyhanded either (the direction
is something else again); the play
reveals itself in a parabolic way
through suggestion, ambiguity,
synechdoche. And it's funny. It's
the uneasy humor of ultimate
bewilderment.
For some reason, Director
William Ball didn't trust this fine
material and added several bits of
stage business to garner laughs.
Indeed, the hand of the director
was almost always evident: in the
carefully composed stage
groupings, in the blatant stage
tricks, in the blocking. The play
waan't directed, it was shoved.
Objectionable Hamlet
Paul Shenar appeared as an
older Hamlet, which I found

objectionable. The main contrast
in the play is between
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern and
the powerful, shrewd, vicious
people of the court, to which
Hamlet belongs. As such, a more
youthful, imposing
characterization of Hamlet would
have been in order. One could
never believe that this" Hamlet was
a school buddy of R & G's. The
director's conception of the
character undercut a basic image
in the play: the glamourous
malignancy of Claudius' court.
It is true that Stoppard's
Polonius (Larry Martin) is little
more than a buffoon, but this
does not necessarily apply to the
entire court. Inept, black-robed,
helmeted standard-bearers
obscured the other characters
with their flags, and drowned out
the queen's speech. The
incompetence of the courtiers,
and the king and queen, were
expressed in small mannerisms
and facial expressions.
The only impressive thing
about the court was the elegant
costuming by Robert Fletcher.
Director Ball often staged

exciting scenes, notably the scenes
with the tragedians, to fill the
black emptiness of space. The
bare stage had only steps which
crossed diagonally up-right and a
few benches downstage. The
director seemed more adept at
handling the crowd scenes
(particularly the fabulous scene
with Claudius and Polonius,
standing between curtains,
listening to Hamlet and Ophelia
on the right, while the players
attempt to rehearse on the left)
than the scenes with the two
characters, which sometimes
dragged.
The Best Scene
Perhaps the best scene
concerned the players enactment
of the tragedy, in which two
players act Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern (they are dressed in
the same green and blue robes as
the 'real' characters) while R & G
watch. As the true characters
protest the fate of their images,
the actors playing them mimic
their movements and gestures: it's
a bizarre mirror held up to nature.
After being unsure whether they
exist or not, the double images,

not to mention the revelation that
they will be killed, frighten them.

Polonius (Larry Martin) is little
more than a buffoon, but this
does not necessarily apply to the
entire court. Inept, black-robed,
helmeted standard-bearers
obscured the other characters
with their flags, and drowned out
the queen's speech. The
incompetence of the courtiers,
and the king and queen, were
expressed in small mannerisms
and facial expressions.
The only impressive thing
about the court was the elegant
costuming by Robert Fletcher.
Director Ball often staged

exciting scenes, notably the scenes
with the tragedians, to fill the
black emptiness of space. The
bare stage had only steps which
crossed diagonally up-right and a
few benches downstage. The
director seemed more adept at
handling the crowd scenes
(particularly the fabulous scene
with Claudius and Polonius,
standing between curtains,
listening to Hamlet and Ophelia
on the right, while the players
attempt to rehearse on the left)
than the scenes with the two
characters, which sometimes
dragged.
The Best Scene
Perhaps the best scene
concerned the players enactment
of the tragedy, in which two
players act Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern (they are dressed in
the same green and blue robes as
the 'real' characters) while R & G
watch. As the true characters
protest the fate of their images,
the actors playing them mimic
their movements and gestures: it's
a bizarre mirror held up to nature.
After being unsure whether they
exist or not, the double images,

not to mention the revelation that
they will be killed, frighten them.
The direction seemed to falter
at the play's conclusion, and I
think a better way could be found
to end the two 'major' characters
than merely having them stand
with dying spotlights on them.
Indeed, the whole last scene
seemed to die before it was over.
Ken Ruta as the player became
even more somber; his gruff voice
and slow movements made the
scene overly weighty.
I thoroughly enjoyed Larry
Carpenter's portrayal of
Guildenstern as he conveyed the
character's desperate try to get
some grasp of the situation.He
seemed to fully exploit the comic
possibilities of the role as well.
Marc Singer's Rosencrantz was a
trifle uniform emotionally (I
would have liked him to get angry
in the question game), yet he did
create a genuine representation of
the naive character.
Despite a few directorial
quibbles, I found the production
to be an exciting presentation of a
provocative and enthralling play.
