# Advance Registration
## Proposed System Will Avoid Reg Day Rush 
### MARCIA FRIEDMAN 
A new registration system that will
allow a harried student to beat
Registration Day crowds will go into
effect midway through this quarter.
The new procedure is called
"advance registration," and that's
exactly what it is—getting a study list
card, a temporary ID card, and paying
fees, and doing it all about half a
quarter in advance. Students will be
able to make use of it this quarter to
register for next spring.
The system which will involve the
completion of the entire registration
process including the payment of fees
if the student wishes, will replace

pre-registration, which involved
program planning only, the Registrar's
office announced.
Students are not required to
advance register, but those who do will
not need to return on Registration
Day, which will take place at its usual
time.
"We want students to advance
register," Registrar Harvey Hall said.
"This new system will help us get out
of the business of trying to take care
of 11,000 students in one day."
What's A PTR?
Instead of receiving the customary
packet of registration cards, the
student will receive a computer

printed form, a Permit To Register
(PTR), divided into six perforated
sections including a temporary ID
card, study list and fee card.
Class cards will no longer be issued
and students will be required to
formulate their programs and turn
them in on the study list card within
the first two weeks of class.
The PTR will be available in the
departments on a day not yet
specified. Students must fill out the
form, pay tuition or make
arrangements to pay (no extra fee for
deferments to Registration Day) and
sign the necessary class lists.
Ten days have been set aside for
paying fees and signing class lists,
which must be done in person at the
Old Union building.
A confirmation of registration,
showing the student's program, will be
mailed to each student who registered
in advance. Any changes on the
confirmation study list must be
reported to the Registrar's
Information Office.
Classes can still be added until the
last four weeks of the quarter and
dropped until the day before finals.
A team of systems analysts and
programmers here, under a Ford
Foundation Grant, have been
developing a generalized information
system of this type for use in colleges
and universities over the last three
years.

process including the payment of fees
if the student wishes, will replace

pre-registration, which involved
program planning only, the Registrar's
office announced.
Students are not required to
advance register, but those who do will
not need to return on Registration
Day, which will take place at its usual
time.
"We want students to advance
register," Registrar Harvey Hall said.
"This new system will help us get out
of the business of trying to take care
of 11,000 students in one day."
What's A PTR?
Instead of receiving the customary
packet of registration cards, the
student will receive a computer

printed form, a Permit To Register
(PTR), divided into six perforated
sections including a temporary ID
card, study list and fee card.
Class cards will no longer be issued
and students will be required to
formulate their programs and turn
them in on the study list card within
the first two weeks of class.
The PTR will be available in the
departments on a day not yet
specified. Students must fill out the
form, pay tuition or make
arrangements to pay (no extra fee for
deferments to Registration Day) and
sign the necessary class lists.
Ten days have been set aside for
paying fees and signing class lists,
which must be done in person at the
Old Union building.
A confirmation of registration,
showing the student's program, will be
mailed to each student who registered
in advance. Any changes on the
confirmation study list must be
reported to the Registrar's
Information Office.
Classes can still be added until the
last four weeks of the quarter and
dropped until the day before finals.
A team of systems analysts and
programmers here, under a Ford
Foundation Grant, have been
developing a generalized information
system of this type for use in colleges
and universities over the last three
years.
The Stanford Law School tried this
method of registration for this year's
fall semester.
