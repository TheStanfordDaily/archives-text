Bengal Sheik Inaugurated
DACCA — Sheik Mujibur Rahman yesterday assumed the post of prime minister
to head a parliamentary government in Bangladesh. Meanwhile the new nation
picked up more support from behind the Iron Curtain.
The heads of all former diplomatic missions in Dacca except those of the
United States and Communist China attended the swearing-in ceremony

Wednesday. Although without official status, the missions have remained open
and operating since the surrender of the Pakistan army Dec. 16.
Herbert D. Spivack, chief of the former U.S. mission, greeted Mujib at the
Dacca airport Monday, the first American contact with the Bangladesh head of
state.
As Mujib took his oath in Dacca, two Moscow-oriented diplomats presented
their governments' compliments to the Bangladesh mission in New Delhi and
extended official recognition. •
Davis Asks Bail
SAN FRANCISCO — Black militant Angela Davis, arguing that her life is at
stake, urged a federal judge yesterday to free her on bail to better defend herself
on murder-kidnap charges.
The 27-year-old one-time UCLA professor, who has been behind bars for one
year and 20 days, said denying bail was "more a political gesture than a legal
gesture" and has "severely eroded the presumption of innocence."
Davis, who is a co-attorney in her case, made the argument at a hearing before
U.S. District Court Judge William T. Sweigert on a defense motion for bail.
Sweigert took the motion under study.
She is slated to go on trial in San Jose Jan. 31 on murder, kidnap and
conspiracy charges stemming from the Aug. 7, 1970, shootout at the Marin
County Civic Center in which a judge, two convicts and an accomplice were
killed. She is not charged with being present at the scene.
Stanford University law Professor Anthony Amsterdam, who presented the
main defense argument, said Superior Court Judge Richard E. Arnason "acted
arbitrarily" when he decided the evidence against Miss Davis was strong enough
to sustain a conviction and denied her bail.
"This is the weakest, the flimsiest case—let alone in a capital
case—that I have ever seen," he said.
China Trip Plans Noted
WASHINGTON — Part of President Nixon's historic journey to Peking next
month will be televised live in the United States and probably will be followed
by a springtime visit here by Chinese table tennis players, a White House
spokesman said yesterday.
Press secretary Ronald L. Ziegler told newsmen that the Chinese will hire an
American firm to set up a portable ground station at the Peking Airport which
will be capable of transmitting full press coverage—voice, print and pictures—to
the United States.
