# Gasoline Fire Set At Hansen Labs
## 
### 
An arsonist last night set a minor
fire around a heat exchanger unit at
the Hansen Laboratory, scene of a
protest Tuesday.
According to Stanford fire officials,
shortly before 11 p.m. a box alarm
was sounded at the Hansen Microwave
Laboratories when a student drove by
the labs and saw flames about two and
a half feet high around the unit.
Units of the Stanford Fire
Department let the flames burn
themselves out in less than 10 minutes.
Also, at about 11:30 last night a
power pole carrying 12,000-volt and
60,000-volt lines was cut. The pole,
located about 300 yards down
Fremont Road from Junipero Serra,
near the Stanford Stables riding ring,
fell only part way, breaking the
12,000-volt line, but leaving the larger
wire intact.
A jogger in the area notified Pacific
Gas and Electric crews of the exact
location of the break, and informed
police of the license number of a car
he saw parked near the pole, according
to workmen in the area. Apparently an
all-points bulletin has been put out for
the car and its occupants.
Power to the Knoll and to the
KZSU transmitter was temporarily
interrupted when the 12,000-volt line
snapped, but was soon restored.
According to PG&E crews, the

60,000-volt line served most of
Stanford, as well as Woodside and
Menlo Park, and would have arced
over a large area if it broke, killing
anyone on the ground.
At the Hansen Lab two burned
match-books and an unbroken wine
bottle with a small amount of
flammable liquid in the bottom were
observed next to the unit.
A scorched one gallon
container-resembling a gas can—was
under the unit. Santa Clara County
Fire Marshal Paul Andre speculated
that the can had contained a
flammable liquid, and someone set up
a cigarette-and-string timing device to
set off the fire.
There was no damage of
consequence to the unit itself;
scorching of the cement pad and
bottom of the unit were the only
things Andre discovered.
Several people working inside the
Hansen Lab left the building after fire
units had arrived complaining about an
odor throughout the building,
apparently from the fire.
The heat exchange unit is located at
the rear of the building, the southwest
corner.
Tuesday about 250 people marched
to the Hansen Lab protesting the firing
of English Professor H. Bruce Franklin
and Defense Department research.

Menlo Park, and would have arced
over a large area if it broke, killing
anyone on the ground.
At the Hansen Lab two burned
match-books and an unbroken wine
bottle with a small amount of
flammable liquid in the bottom were
observed next to the unit.
A scorched one gallon
container-resembling a gas can—was
under the unit. Santa Clara County
Fire Marshal Paul Andre speculated
that the can had contained a
flammable liquid, and someone set up
a cigarette-and-string timing device to
set off the fire.
There was no damage of
consequence to the unit itself;
scorching of the cement pad and
bottom of the unit were the only
things Andre discovered.
Several people working inside the
Hansen Lab left the building after fire
units had arrived complaining about an
odor throughout the building,
apparently from the fire.
The heat exchange unit is located at
the rear of the building, the southwest
corner.
Tuesday about 250 people marched
to the Hansen Lab protesting the firing

and Defense Department research.
An arsonist last night set a minor
fire around a heat exchanger unit at
the Hansen Laboratory, scene of a
protest Tuesday.
According to Stanford fire officials,
shortly before 11 p.m. a box alarm
was sounded at the Hansen Microwave
Laboratories when a student drove by
the labs and saw flames about two and
a half feet high around the unit.
Units of the Stanford Fire
Department let the flames burn
themselves out in less than 10 minutes.
Also, at about 11:30 last night a
power pole carrying 12,000-volt and
60,000-volt lines was cut. The pole,
located about 300 yards down
Fremont Road from Junipero Serra,
near the Stanford Stables riding ring,
fell only part way, breaking the
12,000-volt line, but leaving the larger
wire intact.
A jogger in the area notified Pacific
Gas and Electric crews of the exact
location of the break, and informed
police of the license number of a car
he saw parked near the pole, according
to workmen in the area. Apparently an
all-points bulletin has been put out for
the car and its occupants.
Power to the Knoll and to the
KZSU transmitter was temporarily
interrupted when the 12,000-volt line
snapped, but was soon restored.
According to PG&E crews, the

60,000-volt line served most of
Stanford, as well as Woodside and
Menlo Park, and would have arced
over a large area if it broke, killing
anyone on the ground.
