# ACLU Might Assist In Franklin Defense
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
The Northern California chapter of
the American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLU) will decide next month
whether to join a court challenge of
Professor H. Bruce Franklin's pending
dismissal.
The decision will be made by the
ACLU's Executive Board at its
February meeting in San Francisco.
Franklin has said he will challenge his
dismissal in civil court if--as expected--
it is upheld by Stanford trustees at
their January 22 meeting.
Expressing his personal opinion the
regional ACLU's, Legal Director, Paul
Halvonik, yesterday told the
Daily:"There is no question in my
mind that Bruce Franklin was fired
because theydidn'tlike what he said."
Halvonik said there was also "no
question" that the faculty Advisory
Board judging Franklin's case has
rejected the civil liberties standards
advocated by the ACLU in a "friend
of the court" brief it submitted.
The ACLU was based on mistaken
"faith in the Advisory Board's
statement that they wanted to be
bound by First Amendment
provisions." Halvonik added.
Protected Speech
The ACLU brief argued that
speeches given by Franklin last Feb.
10 were "not even close to the line"
separating protected speech from
unlawful incitement.
The civil liverties lawyer said that
the ACLU Executive Board had
unanimously approved intervention in

Franklin's campus hearing. But
Halvonik revealed that the ACLU's
involvement prompted an unusually
large number of protests from ACLU
members, "who were horrified because
they thought we were supporting
someone who would stop free
speech."
Halvonik said public confusion
resulted from "Stanford's very clever
ploy" of stressing the charge that
Franklin disrupted Henry Cabot
Lodge's speech rather than the
incitement allegations. The Advisory
Board unanimously cleared Franklin
of "substantial involvement" in the
Lodge incident, the only charge for
which the ACLU and Franklin offered
substantially different standards.
In other reactions to the Franklin
decision, the Daily has learned that the
Stanford chapter of the American
Association of University Professors
(AAUP) is sending the Board of
Trustees a letter today, asking for a
delay in their final decision.
Letter
An AAUP official explained the
letter would ask trustees to withhold
their approval af Franklin's ouster
until they receive "input from various
institutions throughout the country on
the important effects a decision like
this might have.
Franklin yesterday announced he
would accept an invitation from
Columbae House to teach there.
Columbae is located outside of the area
covered by an injunction barring
Franklin from the central campus.

Protected Speech
The ACLU brief argued that
speeches given by Franklin last Feb.
10 were "not even close to the line"
separating protected speech from
unlawful incitement.
The civil liverties lawyer said that
the ACLU Executive Board had
unanimously approved intervention in

Franklin's campus hearing. But
Halvonik revealed that the ACLU's
involvement prompted an unusually
large number of protests from ACLU
members, "who were horrified because
they thought we were supporting
someone who would stop free
speech."
Halvonik said public confusion
resulted from "Stanford's very clever
ploy" of stressing the charge that
Franklin disrupted Henry Cabot
Lodge's speech rather than the
incitement allegations. The Advisory
Board unanimously cleared Franklin
of "substantial involvement" in the
Lodge incident, the only charge for
which the ACLU and Franklin offered
substantially different standards.
In other reactions to the Franklin
decision, the Daily has learned that the
Stanford chapter of the American
Association of University Professors
(AAUP) is sending the Board of
Trustees a letter today, asking for a
delay in their final decision.
Letter
An AAUP official explained the
letter would ask trustees to withhold
their approval af Franklin's ouster
until they receive "input from various
institutions throughout the country on
the important effects a decision like
this might have.
Franklin yesterday announced he
would accept an invitation from
Columbae House to teach there.
Columbae is located outside of the area
covered by an injunction barring
Franklin from the central campus.
The Northern California chapter of
the American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLU) will decide next month
whether to join a court challenge of
Professor H. Bruce Franklin's pending
dismissal.
The decision will be made by the
ACLU's Executive Board at its
February meeting in San Francisco.
Franklin has said he will challenge his
dismissal in civil court if--as expected--
it is upheld by Stanford trustees at
their January 22 meeting.
Expressing his personal opinion the
regional ACLU's, Legal Director, Paul
Halvonik, yesterday told the
Daily:"There is no question in my
mind that Bruce Franklin was fired
because theydidn'tlike what he said."
Halvonik said there was also "no
question" that the faculty Advisory
Board judging Franklin's case has
rejected the civil liberties standards
advocated by the ACLU in a "friend
of the court" brief it submitted.
The ACLU was based on mistaken
"faith in the Advisory Board's
statement that they wanted to be
bound by First Amendment
provisions." Halvonik added.
