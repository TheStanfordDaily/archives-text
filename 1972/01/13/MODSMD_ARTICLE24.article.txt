# SUN Asks Involvement, Not Dollars
## 
### JON GRAY 
Stanford University Now (SUN), a
student-initiated fund-raising organization for the
University, will not solicit student funds this year.
This new policy reflects a basis realization among
SUN administrators and students that involvement
is more important than dollars at the undergraduate
level.
"At one time the thought was you had to get the
student to give," stated Bruce Hinchliffe, director of
the Stanford Annual Fund, major alumni
fund-raising organization, "but now the emphasis is
on his involvement in the fund raising itself."
Two years ago, the first SUN Fund request was
sent out to students on high-visibility yellow, blue
and white stationery. The response was never
overwhelming. But last year in response to one
mailing, the SUN Fund received $1,131.50, four
thousand dollars less than two mailings had hauled
in during the first year.
The number of complaints over the . request
soared to 46, and SUN envelbpteS returned
containing everything from penny "donations." to
tossed greed salads.

"It was pretty discouraging," admitted Bob
Ducommun, head of the Student Development Committee,
student fund-raising group. Since then he and others
have revamped the organization. The new SUN has
several goals, the first of these being to inject
student volumteers into the mainstream of the
Annual Fund. As an example, a "phonathon"
financial request over the phone, was held
November 29th to December 2nd, 1971. To
facilitate fund raising, the country is divided into
regions according to alumni density. Scattered
between these regions, however, are alumni not
contacted by any of these organizations.
Requests
Over the four evening, aapproximately 35
students called these individuals and requested
donations for Stanford. The Fairchild Corporation
donated free use of their long-distance phone lines.
Over $17,000 has been received','and all the pledges
aren't in yet," said Hans Carstensen who led the
phonathon.
SUN hopes to inform the student body of the
financial needs of the University. This knowledge is

grJned either throng':- specific University fund
raising or though a SUN education program. A
3UN-sponsored lecture series entitled "Everything
you always wanted to know about Stanford . .. but
didn't know whom to ask" was held last year. The
weekly talks which presented students, faculty, and
staff with facts about Stanford, was fairly well
attended.
This year's project is still undecided, but a
Meyer Library display is being considered. Two
thousand copies of the pamphlet "Stanford Facts
1971-1972" have been ordered for distribution.
"We're aiming at answering the basic questions this
year," said Ducummon, "like why the grass between
Wilbur and Stern isn't being cut or why untenured
professors aren't being rehired."
SUN, previously located in the General
Secretary's Office, has moved to the second floor of
the old Fire House, home of a new Student Center.
Various student organizations which before were
housed in Encina, Bowman Alumni House, the
Placement Center, or the Dean of Students Office
will be there under one roof.

student volumteers into the mainstream of the
Annual Fund. As an example, a "phonathon"
financial request over the phone, was held
November 29th to December 2nd, 1971. To
facilitate fund raising, the country is divided into
regions according to alumni density. Scattered
between these regions, however, are alumni not
contacted by any of these organizations.
Requests
Over the four evening, aapproximately 35
students called these individuals and requested
donations for Stanford. The Fairchild Corporation
donated free use of their long-distance phone lines.
Over $17,000 has been received','and all the pledges
aren't in yet," said Hans Carstensen who led the
phonathon.
SUN hopes to inform the student body of the
financial needs of the University. This knowledge is

grJned either throng':- specific University fund
raising or though a SUN education program. A
3UN-sponsored lecture series entitled "Everything
you always wanted to know about Stanford . .. but
didn't know whom to ask" was held last year. The
weekly talks which presented students, faculty, and
staff with facts about Stanford, was fairly well
attended.
This year's project is still undecided, but a
Meyer Library display is being considered. Two
thousand copies of the pamphlet "Stanford Facts
1971-1972" have been ordered for distribution.
"We're aiming at answering the basic questions this
year," said Ducummon, "like why the grass between
Wilbur and Stern isn't being cut or why untenured
professors aren't being rehired."
SUN, previously located in the General
Secretary's Office, has moved to the second floor of
the old Fire House, home of a new Student Center.
Various student organizations which before were
housed in Encina, Bowman Alumni House, the
Placement Center, or the Dean of Students Office
will be there under one roof.
Stanford University Now (SUN), a
student-initiated fund-raising organization for the
University, will not solicit student funds this year.
This new policy reflects a basis realization among
SUN administrators and students that involvement
is more important than dollars at the undergraduate
level.
"At one time the thought was you had to get the
student to give," stated Bruce Hinchliffe, director of
the Stanford Annual Fund, major alumni
fund-raising organization, "but now the emphasis is
on his involvement in the fund raising itself."
Two years ago, the first SUN Fund request was
sent out to students on high-visibility yellow, blue
and white stationery. The response was never
overwhelming. But last year in response to one
mailing, the SUN Fund received $1,131.50, four
thousand dollars less than two mailings had hauled
in during the first year.
The number of complaints over the . request
soared to 46, and SUN envelbpteS returned
containing everything from penny "donations." to
tossed greed salads.

"It was pretty discouraging," admitted Bob
Ducommun, head of the Student Development Committee,
student fund-raising group. Since then he and others
have revamped the organization. The new SUN has
several goals, the first of these being to inject
student volumteers into the mainstream of the
Annual Fund. As an example, a "phonathon"
