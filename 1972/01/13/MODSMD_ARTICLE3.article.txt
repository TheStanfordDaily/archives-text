# Committee To Ask Open Board Meeting
## 
### DAVID THIEMANN 
The coordinating committee of the
Stanford Rehabilitation Movement
decided yesterday to demand an open
Board of Trustees meeting on campus
the day before the scheduled January
22 special Trustees session. The
Trustees will consider the Advisory
Board's decision, supported by
President Richard Lyman, to dismiss
Bruce Franklin.
The coordinating group also decided
to ask the Student Senate tonight to
schedule a referendum for Wednesday,
January 19, to ascertain student
opinion on Franklin's proposed firing.
In other actions, the group agreed
to move their base of operations from
Memorial Church to room 52K,
Franklin's now-empty office, to which
he provided the key.
The coordinating committee
meeting also agreed to establish a
nine-person "steering committee,"
with six members in charge of specific
activities and three chosen at large.
This new panel is designed to
implement the decisions of the larger,
more informal parent group,
composed of representatives of
dormitories, affinity groups or
"rehabilitation squads," and
representatives of organizations,
including Venceremos, the Young
Crows, Columbae House, the Third
World Liberation Front, and the
Faculty Political Action Group.
According to members of the
steering committee, Franklin will
begin to teach his "Literature and
Revolution" class in the Columbae
Lounge on a regular basis soon.
The six groups represented in the
steering committee include culture,
devoted to innovative, original
methods dramatizing the issues
surrounding the Franklin case;
research and publicity, to produce
leaflets and obtain information on
current issues; events, to organize
rallies, demonstrations, sit-ins, and
other major occasions; referendum and
student government, to establish liason
with the ASSU Council of Presidents
and Student Senate; finance, to obtain
and disburse money for the
movement; and dorm and department
organization, to establish a

communications network on campus.
The "culture" section may begin to
"shadow" Advisory Board members
who voted to dismiss Franklin,
following them everywhere with signs
proclaiming their "guilt." Members of
this section also may begin to ask
Board members questions about the
decision during their classes.
The meeting yesterday established
"general parameters" for action to
protest Franklin's firing, participants
emphasized, and did not preclude any
individual action people or groups
might find necessary.
