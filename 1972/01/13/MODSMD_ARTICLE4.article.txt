York Times bureau there, and soon
went to Washington to work for the
Times.

After a shakeup in the Times office in
1967, he became executive editor—the
top editorial post on the paper.
He has also written for such diverse
organizations as the Springfield, Ohio,
Daily News, the Ohio State University
public relations department, and the
Cincinnati Reds publicity office.
Reston, one of the first US

Award for national reporting and the
Overseas Press Club award for
interpretive reporting of international
news.
