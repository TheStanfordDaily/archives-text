# Student Movement Seeks Voices In Convention Delegate Selection
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
ASSU co-president Larry Diamond,
who was instrumental in organizing
the November Emergency Conference
of New Voters meeting here, is once
again focusing his attention on the
national political scene.
Diamond is currently Northern
California Representative, and chief
organizer, of the National Youth
Caucus, an organization dedicated to
obtaining increased youth
representation at this summer's
Democratic National Convention.
The Caucus will hold a convention
Saturday, January 22, at the San Jose
State College Student Union to map
its program for landing young
delegates on California's massive
271-member delegation to the
upcoming Miami Beach convention.
California, according to Diamond,
because of a newly-revamped delegate
selection procedure, will make an
excellent target for the NYC
movement.
He explained that each declared
Democratic candidate for the
Presidency will be required to hold a
caucus on Saturday morning, February
12, in each of the state's 38
Congressional districts to select
delegates for the slate he will offer in
the June 6 statewide primary.
These caucuses will be the primary
targets for the NYC organizers.
Caucuses
The group is asking young voters to
show up at the individual caucus of
whichever candidate they prefer, to
"make our presence known and
perhaps push the Democratic Party a
little farther left than the party bosses
would like to go," according to
Diamond.
To this end, the San Jose State
conference will include workshops on
California election laws and delegate
selection methods, voter registration
techniques and deadlines, and

techniques on gaining press publicity.
Also, several national and area
political figures are scheduled to
address the San Jose gathering.
Speakers will be Senator Alan
Cranston, visiting Stanford Professor
of Human Biology (and former
Congressman) Allard Lowenstein, and
perhaps State Assemblyman Willie
Brown.
More Speakers
Others who have been invited to
appear include new San Francisco
Sheriff Richard Hongisto, former
Stanford Black Students Union
Chairman Leo Bazile, and Yvonne
Westbrook, 18-year-old candidate for
San Francisco Supervisor who finished
tenth in a field of more than 30 for
the five positions on the Board.
Diamond listed candidates who will
hold caucuses as including Senators
Edmund Muskie, George McGovern,
Hubert Humphrey, Scoop Jackson,
and Vance Hartke; Mayors Sam Yorty
and John Lindsay; and possibly,
Representative Shirley Chisholm and
former Senator Eugene McCarthy.
But if Diamond is enthusiastic over

the NYC's chances for playing an
important role in the selection, others
in the organization are not.
Resigned
The Associated Press reported last
night that Duane Draper, national
co-ordinator of the organization, had
resigned his post to become youth
co-ordinator for Senator Muskie's
Wisconsin primary campaign.
Draper said that the demise of three
favorite son candidacies had convinced
him that the NYC would have little
chance of playing an important role in
the choice of the eventual Democratic
nominee.
He said the NYC had pinned its
hopes on having a large bloc of
uncommitted delegates at the
convention, bound to favorite sons on
the first ballot but then free to make
their own choices.
However, the three hoped-for
favorite son movements failed to
materialize when Governors Milton
Shapp of Pennsylvania and John
Gilligan of Ohio, and Senator John
Tunney of California, all abandoned
their bids to endorse Muskie.
