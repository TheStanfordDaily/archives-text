## the 						basic issue What About DoD Research 
### 
- norm albers

Having co-authored the
SWOPSI reports on DoD research
at Stanford, I have in the past
week or two been engaged in
many discussions on the propriety
of DoD sponsored work here at
the University.
One of our central arguments
in Volume II is that for much of
this work the DoD has sufficiently
well-developed motivation that
the oft-used term "basic research"
is senseless as a descriptor, and
serves only as an obfuscation. In
reasponse several faculty members
have attempted to list criteria
under which the term is still valid,
and consistently the concept of a
long period of time before
application of the work has
appeared as a criterion.
Such attempts at escaping the
reality of consequences already
foreseen by the Defense
Department (certainly not in all
cases, but in enough to be
important) are simply at odds
with the contract work we find at
Stanford. Fully fifteen percent of
the hundred or so DoD contracts
are defined by the military as

exploratory, advanced, or
engineering development work.
This means that DoD funds the
work out just because it lies in an
area of science having for them a
high payoff potential, but because
it constitutes for them a
well-defined building block in a
project to develop weapons or
other military systems.
The work may or may not
produce apparatus which can
actually be "plugged in" to a
system being tested in the
sponsoring military laboratory.
One contract is especially
worth mentioning in this context,
as well as for other reasons I will
shortly describe. The Army
Electronics Command funds Prof.
Marvin Chodorow to develop
"Large Time-Bandwidth Delay
Lines and Parametric Signal
Processing Using Surface Acoustic
Waves" (contract No. DAABO7-71-
C-0145, classed as exploratory
development by the Army).
I quote pages 3-4 of the
contract document:
Part 1. Research and
development work ... in

accordance with United States
Army Electronics Command
Technical Guidelines, dated 19
October 1970, entitled "Surface
Wave Parametric Processors and
Long Delay Lines" and Stanford
University's unsolicited proposal,
dated January 1971.. . .
The following shall be
delivered on 31 March 1972:
Part 4. One each 7-bit Digital
Autocorrelator, Exploratory
Development Model, experimental
type, to demonstrate results of
the work under Part 1.
Part 5. One each FM Sweep
Autocorrelator, Exploratory
Development model, experimental
type, to demonstrate results. .. .
Part 6. One each 300 MHz
Pulse Compressor, Exploratory
Development Model. . . .
Part 7. One each 100 MHz
Closed Loop Delay Line.
Exploratory Development
model. . . .
The contract thus provides for
delivery to the Fort Monmouth
Army lahoratory four prototype
microwave acoustic circuit
elements for testing by the Armv.
These devices hold great
promise for the military because
they allow signals collected by a
radar receiver to be processed as
they travel across a single crystal a
few inches in size, replacing a
great deal of complex circuitry
presently required for this
analysis. v
After speaking with Prof.
Chodorow I recognize that as far
as we know the Army has yet no
radar developed to accept
components sent from Stanford;
rather the Army will seek to
design such systems after
evaluating the performance of the
prototypes developed here.
The fact that such direct
connections with the DoD exist at
Stanford makes it abundantly
clear that criticism of DoD
funding cannot be answered by
allusions to science as a
cornucopeoia of purity and
goodness, whose products are
misused by the forces of evil and
destruction.
Regardless of the motivations
of Stanford researchers, the DoD
is getting exactly what it wants
from this arm of the R&D
establishment.
One other section of this
contract merits special attention.
On page 14 is the following;
In the event of a conflict
between Stanford University
Proposal dated January, 1971,
and the United States Army
Electronics Command Technical
Guidelines referenced in Part 1,
the latter shall take precedence.
It seems that the Army has
been able to insure contractually
that it gets what it wants even if
the researcher wants to follow a
course of action different from
that given in the Army Guidelines.
This may or may not be
significant in the present project,
but such a clause seems to me to
be a highly objectionable
precedent for sponsored research
and development
