Editor, THE DAILY:
The people of the San
Francisco Bay Area deserve to
know as much about the quality
of the air they breathe as the
people of the Los Angeles Area
know about theirs.
Presently, the Bay Area Air
Pollution Control District
publishes a daily report of a
"Combined Pollutant Index" for
North, Central and South sections
of the Bay Area. The North
section being the San Rafael,
Richmond and Pittsburg stations,
the Central section being the San
Francisco and Oakland stations,
and the South section being the
Redwood City and San Jose
stations. While the three daily
"Combined Pollutant Index"
values give some general idea of
the level of smog, they don't
report specific pollutant levels for
every major urban area.
In Los Angeles, the Smog
Report gives a daily forecast for
ozone levels, eye irritation, and
minimum visibilities for the Los
Angeles air basin. It also includes
the previous day's peak readings
for ozone, carbon monoxide and
nitrogen oxides concentrations for
eleven stations in Los Angeles,
San Fernando Valley and Orange
County.
Our Bay Area Air Pollution

Control District should publish a
daily smog report including a
forecast for ozone levels, eye
irritation and minimum
visibilities. It also should report
the previous day's "Combined
Pollutant Index" and peak
readings for ozone, carbon
monoxide and nitrogen oxide
concentrations for the twelve
pollution monitoring stations in
the Bay Area (San Francisco,
Richmond, Pittsburg, Walnut
Creek, Oakland, San Leandro,
Fremont, Livermore, San Jose,
Redwood City and Burlingame).
This daily smog report would
help us to know better the quality
of air we are breathing and might
inspire us to more action in
cleaning it up.
