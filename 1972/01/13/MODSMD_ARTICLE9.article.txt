## A 						Response To Hocker And Knutson 
### 
Scott burke

It is surprising that two such
individuals of high intelligence
and integrity as Chris Hocker and
Peter Knutson can demonstrate as
great a degree of misunderstand
ing of the case of Bruce Franklin
as they did in their articles in
yesterday's Daily.
Mr. Hocker entirely obscures
the issues in question by claiming
that they can be reduced to the
single question: "Does an
employer have the right to fire an
employee?" The issue is not one
of "right", since clearly the
university does possess the right,
as Hocker uses that term, since it
has the power and authority to
take such an action.
The real issue is whether or not
doing so is first, justified, and
second, in the best interests of the
university. Mr. Hocker's indirect

assertion that the action is
justified and in the university's
interests because Franklin has
attacked the university as "dirty,
evil, immoral," and "began to
convince others" that such was
the case, assumes much that is
false about the university.
Stanford is not an ordinary
business whose customers will be
frightened away by a less than
perfect public relations image. It
is a university which as such
justifies its existence by claiming
that it fosters the education of
students attending it. Contrary to
Hocker's view, mere attack and
criticism of such an institution is
not a great danger to it and is not
sufficient reason to fire an
employee.
Such a policy would result in a
university which could not
efficiently conduct its "business."
It would become an institution
wherein all instructors are
frightened rabbits chanting in
unison the party line for fear that

any deviation or criticism would
bring dismissal. A state such as
that would not be conducive to
education—the business of the
university—since education
requires the opportunity and
encouragement to freely choose
among competing and
contradictory philosophical,
political and economic approaches
to the fundamental problems of
human existence.
Knutson's assertions, while
diametrically opposed to those of
Mr. Hocker, are similar because
they too are not well founded.
While it is true that Franklin's
dismissal somewhat limits political
expression on campus, and that
"the traditional avenues of
expression and response" within
the university cannot possibly
achieve the rehiring of Bruce, it
does not follow that "extralegal
action is the only form of political
redress permitted us."
When the established university
procedures for dealing with a

problem of this magnitude have
failed, appeal to outside courts
always remains as a possible
course of action. Much as Mr.
Knutson may dislike admitting it,
nothing which is within our power
to do here on campus can possibly
result in Franklin's rehiring.
The administration and the
trustees are firmly, completely,
sincerely, and inalterably
committed to the notion that the
interests of the university demand
his dismissal. Chances are nil that
any actions students may take will
cause them to change their minds.
These unfortunate circumstances
should be admitted by Knutson
and others, and they should shed
the delusion that any real power
which the people possess to bring
about the rehiring of Bruce
Franklin can be exercized, legally
or extralegally, within the
confines of the university.

dismissal somewhat limits political
expression on campus, and that
"the traditional avenues of
expression and response" within
the university cannot possibly
achieve the rehiring of Bruce, it
does not follow that "extralegal
action is the only form of political
redress permitted us."
When the established university
procedures for dealing with a

problem of this magnitude have
failed, appeal to outside courts
always remains as a possible
course of action. Much as Mr.
Knutson may dislike admitting it,
nothing which is within our power
to do here on campus can possibly
result in Franklin's rehiring.
The administration and the
trustees are firmly, completely,
sincerely, and inalterably
committed to the notion that the
interests of the university demand
his dismissal. Chances are nil that
any actions students may take will
cause them to change their minds.
These unfortunate circumstances
should be admitted by Knutson
and others, and they should shed
the delusion that any real power
which the people possess to bring
about the rehiring of Bruce
Franklin can be exercized, legally
or extralegally, within the
confines of the university.

It is surprising that two such
individuals of high intelligence
and integrity as Chris Hocker and
Peter Knutson can demonstrate as
great a degree of misunderstand
ing of the case of Bruce Franklin
as they did in their articles in
yesterday's Daily.
Mr. Hocker entirely obscures
the issues in question by claiming
that they can be reduced to the
single question: "Does an
employer have the right to fire an
employee?" The issue is not one
of "right", since clearly the
university does possess the right,
as Hocker uses that term, since it
has the power and authority to
take such an action.
The real issue is whether or not
doing so is first, justified, and
second, in the best interests of the
university. Mr. Hocker's indirect

assertion that the action is
justified and in the university's
interests because Franklin has
attacked the university as "dirty,
evil, immoral," and "began to
convince others" that such was
the case, assumes much that is
false about the university.
Stanford is not an ordinary
business whose customers will be
frightened away by a less than
perfect public relations image. It
is a university which as such
justifies its existence by claiming
that it fosters the education of
students attending it. Contrary to
Hocker's view, mere attack and
criticism of such an institution is
not a great danger to it and is not
sufficient reason to fire an
employee.
Such a policy would result in a
university which could not
efficiently conduct its "business."
It would become an institution
wherein all instructors are
frightened rabbits chanting in
unison the party line for fear that

any deviation or criticism would
bring dismissal. A state such as
that would not be conducive to
education—the business of the
university—since education
requires the opportunity and
encouragement to freely choose
among competing and
contradictory philosophical,
political and economic approaches
to the fundamental problems of
human existence.
Knutson's assertions, while
diametrically opposed to those of
Mr. Hocker, are similar because
they too are not well founded.
