Today In The 'Daily 9
Today is Friday, Jan. 14, 1972. Twenty-seven years ago today, the Daily o
launched a crusade to uphold the hallowed Farm tradition banning smoking :!
jj: on the Quad. From 9to 11 on Monday morning, reporters spotted "a grand %
;i| total of 35 people smoking on Quad." Professors and law students were the
;! worst offenders.
;i; The hard-hitting editorial noted: "We owe a lot because we are free to
j shout about the things we don't like and that we want to change. Let the vast j|:
â€¢: majority then protest the reckless few who find no better match for their ',j:
drugged individualism than to flout a tradition which enforcement would:]
''defame/'
'i ' *}'
|j; The editorial hoped to nudge to virtue "people who do not deserve to ;j
;j: wittingly bear the implications of degenerated sensibilities which smoking on :j;
; : Quad, in the final analysis, implies. " ;j;
To degenerate your sensibilities, call the Daily editorial office at 321 2300, ;i
;; ex. 4632. The business office (327-4150) will advertise all manner of \i;
degenerations, and the fellows there will be delighted to hear from you. ;|;
