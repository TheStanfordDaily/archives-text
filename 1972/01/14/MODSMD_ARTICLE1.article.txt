# Calls For Referendum
## Senate Blasts Franklin Decision 
### TINA COOPER 
The Student Senate last night by an
overwhelming vote condemned the
University administration and the
Advisory Board for the "unjustifiable
firing" of English Professor H. Bruce
Franklin and called for a student
referendum next week on his firing.
The referendum, scheduled for
January 19 and 20, asks students
whether they think Franklin should be
retained as a professor at Stanford.
The resolution condemning the
University, offered by Peter F.
Goldscheider, termed the firing one of
"Political oppression, another
manifestation of the University's
desire to protect its interests from the
free expression of opinion."
The Senate also overwhelmingly
requested an open meeting between
Stanford trustees and members of the
Stanford community to "discuss the
implications of the Franklin case."
The Senate alio narrowly adopted
by a 12-11 vote a resolution suggesting
that all students make their feelings on
the case known by "peaceful,

non-coercive types of communication
and demonstration." The resolution,
offered by Senator Chuck Fay,
condemned violent actions as
"antithetical to the concept of
academic freedom."
Expressions of support for Professor
Franklin also came from many other
parts of the campus yesterday.
English TA's Support
Graduate students in the English
Department released a letter in
support of Franklin. The sense of the
letter was approved at a meeting of
graduate students on Wednesday.
"We do not hesitate to describe the
men who condemned Franklin as
being themselves, by virtue of that
condemnation, in an extreme political
position: if he is guilty of excesses,
then it is their excesses which have
made him so," the letter says.
"We fear a new and especially
militant phase of political scrutiny and
coercion at Stanford. No gulf exists
between literature and the moral life
of a society, and their connection
must be brought home forcefully to

everyone who presumes to concern
himself with the advancement of
learning."
"We therefore announce that in the
future the teaching undertaken by the
graduate students of this department
will be directed towards that ideal of
teaching which Franklin courageously
attempted to introduce.
"In pure self-defense, we
vehemently insist on the right of the
University to proclaim that ideal in the
teeth of those determined to prevent
it,"the letter continues.
Noon Rally Today
A rally has been called for today at
noon in White Plaza by supporters of
Franklin. There is a strong possibility
that Nobel Laureate Linus Pauling will
speak.
At the noon rally a letter to the
Board of Trustees will be presented
inviting them to an open meeting on
campus next Thursday night. It is also
expected that a candidate for Dean of
the Engineering school will be
"nominated" and that following the
rally his installation will be held at the
Engineering corner.
Demonstrators have also indicated
that they plan to protest at the Hoover
Institution on Monday over the
University Board of Trustees'
extension of invitations to Supreme
Court Justice William Rehnquist and
former Deputy Secretary of Defense
David Packard to become members of
the Hoover Board of Overseers.
On the following Saturday, the
22nd, demonstrators are expected to
go to San Francisco for some sort of
protest at the site of the Trustees'
special meeting to decide the Franklin
issue.
The Student Senate's actions were
taken last night only after extended
debate. The resolution expressing the
Senate's 'outrage' at Franklin's firing
was adopted only after a long
discussion on the responsibility of its
wording.
Credibility Protected
Larry Diamond, a member of the
ASSU Council of Presidents, objected
to the idea of 'conspiracy' implied in
the wording. He pointed out that that
idea would alienate many students;
John Bradley concurred, citing the
necessity to protect the credibility of
the Senate.
John McNeece offered an
amendment which reworded the

resolution more mildly; however, this
was defeated. Senate sentiment was
almost completely behind Franklin.
Bruce Franklin plans to teach at
Stanford this Monday, in spite of his
suspension and pending dismissal.
Franklin said yesterday that he will
teach at least the first week of English
190, a substitute version of his course
in "Literature and Revolution."
English 190 is a four-unit seminar,
under sponsorship of English Professor
Robert Polhemus and officially taught
by Merle Rabine, an English graduate
student and member of Venceremos.
Franklin said he will lecture to the
class, to be held Mondays and
Wednesdays at 3:15 p.m. at Columbae
House, which is located outside of the
area covered by an injunction
currently barring Franklin from the
central campus.
The Maoist professor suggested that
students sign up for the course in the
English Department office, and he
insisted that those who supported his
ouster would also be welcome because
"we believe in struggle."
Franklin added that prospective
students should buy the books under
"English 81," and read the first
assignmentâ€”Mao's Talk at the Yenan
Forum on Art and Literature.
In other action of the evening, the
Student Senate considered student
applications for various committees,
and eventually approved the
candidates proposed by the
Nominations Committee. ASSU
President Doug McHenry proposed
that the Senate consider a plan to
completely reorganize itself. He
described the present system as
'inefficient.'
Child Care Referendum
The Senate also approved a proposal
by Beth Garfield and Kathy Waller to
return the Child Care Referendum for
another vote by the students. The
referendum will be held February 17.
Students who were confirmed on
committee positions were Carl N.
Anderson, the Committee on Graduate
Studies; Zemmar Lenoir, the
Committee on Minority Employment;
Vincent A. McCarthy, Ann Steinle,
Marilyn Harran, the Search Committee
for the Dean of the Chapel; Richard
Fleming, Land and Building
Development.

CUT TO THE QUICK--This power pole, carrying both a 12,000 volt and 60,000

on Fremont Road near Junipero Serra Blvd., the pole fell only part way, but cut
off power to the Knoll and the KZSU transmitter for a brief time.

support of Franklin. The sense of the
letter was approved at a meeting of
graduate students on Wednesday.
"We do not hesitate to describe the
men who condemned Franklin as
being themselves, by virtue of that
condemnation, in an extreme political
position: if he is guilty of excesses,
then it is their excesses which have
made him so," the letter says.
"We fear a new and especially
militant phase of political scrutiny and
coercion at Stanford. No gulf exists
between literature and the moral life
of a society, and their connection
must be brought home forcefully to

everyone who presumes to concern
himself with the advancement of
learning."
"We therefore announce that in the
future the teaching undertaken by the
graduate students of this department
will be directed towards that ideal of
teaching which Franklin courageously
attempted to introduce.
"In pure self-defense, we
vehemently insist on the right of the
University to proclaim that ideal in the
teeth of those determined to prevent
it,"the letter continues.
Noon Rally Today
A rally has been called for today at
noon in White Plaza by supporters of
Franklin. There is a strong possibility
that Nobel Laureate Linus Pauling will
speak.
At the noon rally a letter to the
Board of Trustees will be presented
inviting them to an open meeting on
campus next Thursday night. It is also
expected that a candidate for Dean of
the Engineering school will be
"nominated" and that following the
rally his installation will be held at the
Engineering corner.
Demonstrators have also indicated
that they plan to protest at the Hoover
Institution on Monday over the
University Board of Trustees'
extension of invitations to Supreme
Court Justice William Rehnquist and
former Deputy Secretary of Defense
David Packard to become members of
the Hoover Board of Overseers.
On the following Saturday, the
22nd, demonstrators are expected to
go to San Francisco for some sort of
protest at the site of the Trustees'
special meeting to decide the Franklin
issue.
The Student Senate's actions were
taken last night only after extended
debate. The resolution expressing the
Senate's 'outrage' at Franklin's firing
was adopted only after a long
discussion on the responsibility of its
wording.
Credibility Protected
Larry Diamond, a member of the
ASSU Council of Presidents, objected
to the idea of 'conspiracy' implied in
the wording. He pointed out that that
idea would alienate many students;
John Bradley concurred, citing the
necessity to protect the credibility of
the Senate.
John McNeece offered an
amendment which reworded the

resolution more mildly; however, this
was defeated. Senate sentiment was
almost completely behind Franklin.
Bruce Franklin plans to teach at
Stanford this Monday, in spite of his
suspension and pending dismissal.
Franklin said yesterday that he will
teach at least the first week of English
190, a substitute version of his course
in "Literature and Revolution."
English 190 is a four-unit seminar,
under sponsorship of English Professor
Robert Polhemus and officially taught
by Merle Rabine, an English graduate
student and member of Venceremos.
Franklin said he will lecture to the
class, to be held Mondays and
Wednesdays at 3:15 p.m. at Columbae
House, which is located outside of the
area covered by an injunction
currently barring Franklin from the
central campus.
The Maoist professor suggested that
students sign up for the course in the
English Department office, and he
insisted that those who supported his
ouster would also be welcome because
"we believe in struggle."
Franklin added that prospective
students should buy the books under
"English 81," and read the first
assignmentâ€”Mao's Talk at the Yenan
Forum on Art and Literature.
In other action of the evening, the
Student Senate considered student
applications for various committees,
and eventually approved the
candidates proposed by the
Nominations Committee. ASSU
President Doug McHenry proposed
that the Senate consider a plan to
completely reorganize itself. He
described the present system as
'inefficient.'
Child Care Referendum
The Senate also approved a proposal
by Beth Garfield and Kathy Waller to
return the Child Care Referendum for
another vote by the students. The
referendum will be held February 17.
Students who were confirmed on
committee positions were Carl N.
Anderson, the Committee on Graduate
Studies; Zemmar Lenoir, the
Committee on Minority Employment;
Vincent A. McCarthy, Ann Steinle,
Marilyn Harran, the Search Committee
for the Dean of the Chapel; Richard
Fleming, Land and Building
Development.

CUT TO THE QUICK--This power pole, carrying both a 12,000 volt and 60,000
volt line, was cut late Wednesday evening by someone using a bucksaw. Located
on Fremont Road near Junipero Serra Blvd., the pole fell only part way, but cut
off power to the Knoll and the KZSU transmitter for a brief time.
The Student Senate last night by an
overwhelming vote condemned the
University administration and the
Advisory Board for the "unjustifiable

Franklin and called for a student

The referendum, scheduled for
January 19 and 20, asks students

The Senate also overwhelmingly

The Senate alio narrowly adopted
by a 12-11 vote a resolution suggesting
that all students make their feelings on
the case known by "peaceful,

non-coercive types of communication
and demonstration." The resolution,
offered by Senator Chuck Fay,
condemned violent actions as
"antithetical to the concept of
academic freedom."

expected that a candidate for Dean of
the Engineering school will be
"nominated" and that following the
rally his installation will be held at the
Engineering corner.
Demonstrators have also indicated
that they plan to protest at the Hoover
Institution on Monday over the
University Board of Trustees'
extension of invitations to Supreme
Court Justice William Rehnquist and
former Deputy Secretary of Defense
David Packard to become members of
the Hoover Board of Overseers.
On the following Saturday, the
22nd, demonstrators are expected to
go to San Francisco for some sort of
protest at the site of the Trustees'
special meeting to decide the Franklin
issue.
The Student Senate's actions were
taken last night only after extended
debate. The resolution expressing the
Senate's 'outrage' at Franklin's firing
was adopted only after a long
discussion on the responsibility of its
wording.
Credibility Protected
Larry Diamond, a member of the
ASSU Council of Presidents, objected
to the idea of 'conspiracy' implied in
the wording. He pointed out that that
idea would alienate many students;
John Bradley concurred, citing the
necessity to protect the credibility of
the Senate.
John McNeece offered an
amendment which reworded the

resolution more mildly; however, this
was defeated. Senate sentiment was
almost completely behind Franklin.
Bruce Franklin plans to teach at
Stanford this Monday, in spite of his
suspension and pending dismissal.
Franklin said yesterday that he will
teach at least the first week of English
190, a substitute version of his course
in "Literature and Revolution."
English 190 is a four-unit seminar,
under sponsorship of English Professor
Robert Polhemus and officially taught
by Merle Rabine, an English graduate
student and member of Venceremos.
Franklin said he will lecture to the
class, to be held Mondays and
Wednesdays at 3:15 p.m. at Columbae
House, which is located outside of the
area covered by an injunction
currently barring Franklin from the
central campus.
The Maoist professor suggested that
students sign up for the course in the
English Department office, and he
insisted that those who supported his
ouster would also be welcome because
"we believe in struggle."
Franklin added that prospective
students should buy the books under
"English 81," and read the first
assignmentâ€”Mao's Talk at the Yenan
Forum on Art and Literature.
In other action of the evening, the
Student Senate considered student
applications for various committees,
and eventually approved the
candidates proposed by the
Nominations Committee. ASSU
President Doug McHenry proposed
that the Senate consider a plan to
completely reorganize itself. He
described the present system as
'inefficient.'
Child Care Referendum
The Senate also approved a proposal
by Beth Garfield and Kathy Waller to
return the Child Care Referendum for
another vote by the students. The
referendum will be held February 17.
Students who were confirmed on
committee positions were Carl N.
Anderson, the Committee on Graduate
Studies; Zemmar Lenoir, the
Committee on Minority Employment;
Vincent A. McCarthy, Ann Steinle,
Marilyn Harran, the Search Committee
for the Dean of the Chapel; Richard
Fleming, Land and Building
Development.

CUT TO THE QUICK--This power pole, carrying both a 12,000 volt and 60,000
volt line, was cut late Wednesday evening by someone using a bucksaw. Located
on Fremont Road near Junipero Serra Blvd., the pole fell only part way, but cut
off power to the Knoll and the KZSU transmitter for a brief time.
The Student Senate last night by an
overwhelming vote condemned the
University administration and the
Advisory Board for the "unjustifiable
firing" of English Professor H. Bruce
Franklin and called for a student
referendum next week on his firing.
The referendum, scheduled for
January 19 and 20, asks students
whether they think Franklin should be
retained as a professor at Stanford.
The resolution condemning the
University, offered by Peter F.
Goldscheider, termed the firing one of
"Political oppression, another
manifestation of the University's
desire to protect its interests from the
free expression of opinion."
The Senate also overwhelmingly
requested an open meeting between
Stanford trustees and members of the
Stanford community to "discuss the
implications of the Franklin case."
The Senate alio narrowly adopted
by a 12-11 vote a resolution suggesting
that all students make their feelings on
the case known by "peaceful,

non-coercive types of communication
and demonstration." The resolution,
offered by Senator Chuck Fay,
condemned violent actions as
"antithetical to the concept of
academic freedom."
Expressions of support for Professor
Franklin also came from many other
parts of the campus yesterday.
English TA's Support
Graduate students in the English
Department released a letter in
support of Franklin. The sense of the
letter was approved at a meeting of
graduate students on Wednesday.
"We do not hesitate to describe the
men who condemned Franklin as
being themselves, by virtue of that
condemnation, in an extreme political
position: if he is guilty of excesses,
then it is their excesses which have
made him so," the letter says.
"We fear a new and especially
militant phase of political scrutiny and
coercion at Stanford. No gulf exists
between literature and the moral life
of a society, and their connection
must be brought home forcefully to

everyone who presumes to concern
himself with the advancement of
learning."
"We therefore announce that in the
future the teaching undertaken by the
graduate students of this department
will be directed towards that ideal of
teaching which Franklin courageously
attempted to introduce.
"In pure self-defense, we
vehemently insist on the right of the
University to proclaim that ideal in the
teeth of those determined to prevent
it,"the letter continues.
Noon Rally Today
A rally has been called for today at
noon in White Plaza by supporters of
Franklin. There is a strong possibility
that Nobel Laureate Linus Pauling will
speak.
At the noon rally a letter to the
Board of Trustees will be presented
inviting them to an open meeting on
campus next Thursday night. It is also
expected that a candidate for Dean of
the Engineering school will be
"nominated" and that following the
