# Best Films Of 1971
## 
### Todd McCarthy 
Many critics annually apologize
for making up lists of the ten best
movies of the year but then
tiredly perform the task anyway,
as if it's just another of the
mundane functions (like
attending screenings and writing
reviews) that critics must perform.
Quite the contrary, I greatly enjoy
compiling my mental notes at
year's end (indeed, many of my
lecture notes of the last couple of
weeks bear margins with
preliminary lists) and though I
still admit the possibility that
comparing a film like "Claire's
Knee" with "Dirty Harry" is like
comparing an apple with an
orange (or, in this case, a fine gem
with a fine gun), I submit my list
forthrightly as bare evidence of
my tastes.
I sometimes think that some
critics have a stock opening
paragraph for their annual
compilations permanently locked
in typeset for use every year, a
paragraph which begins, "Well, it
was another pretty poor year for
movies." Admittedly, the last few
years have been pretty poor, with
a very small number of films
redeeming them from virtual
worthlessness. However, 1
genuinely feel things have
improved this year. A number of
previously "promising" directors
have come into their own, some
artists I never expected much of
surprised me and "slickness,"
which some would maintain is an
unfortunate style unto itself, has
proved to hold some dividends.
Undoubtedly, this has been the
best year since 1968 (the year of
"2001," "Petulia," "Targets,"
"Belle de Jour" and, curiously,
my first appearance in these
pages). The difference is that in
1968 we were slipping into trends
and mediocrity, whereas now we
are (hopefully) regenerating with
individuality and promise.
Below is my list of the best
films of 1971 in relative order of
preference. Excluded are films I
saw at the San Francisco Film
Festival and elsewhere which have
not obtained a distributor, though
I have included a couple of films
which should be released here
very shortly. Among all, I had 82
new films to choose from.
CLAIRE'S KNEE. When I first

saw it in April, I was convinced
there couldn't be a better film this
year than "Claire's Knee." I was
right. Though no one's really
noticed it, Eric Rohmer may turn
out to be the Flaubert of the
cinema. More literate films than
Rohmer's one cannot find, but
they are sublimely beautiful and
cinematic as well. There are still
few films I would be more proud
to have made than "Claire's
Knee."
McCABE AND MRS. MILLER.
The myth-destroying approach
creates new myths of its own and
the immediate cloudiness and
whispers yield with distance to
precision and harmony in Robert
Altman's moving film. Altman,
who was on the verge of
something major last year with
"MASH" and "Brewster McCloud,"
found his stride very quickly with
what is decidedly the best
American film of the year.
THE TOUCH. It is doubtful
that Ingmar Bergman will ever
again make a film in English after
the abysmal reception accorded
this film. All the carping about
Elliott Gould fades into
insignificance in the shadow of
the transcendental Bibi
Andersson, who moved me and
touched me repeatedly with her
extraordinary talent, vulnerability
and womanliness.
TAKING OFF. Milos Forman
created an emminently human
comedy in his first American film,
even if it may have seemed
momentarily cruel. The ensemble
playing is first rate and rarely has
better use been made of New
York's subterranean talent.
Despite the subject, Forman is
fortunately unconcerned with
topicality and thus "Taking Off"
should stand up years from now
just as well as any of his Czech
films.
THE BEGUILED. Don Siegel's
most personal film was maligned
even by some of his previous
supporters. Nonetheless, Clint
Eastwood gives his best
performance to date (a statement
which is beginning to mean
something) and Siegel's treatment

of a Southern gothic horror story
surpasses anything Tennessee
Williams has done in years.
TWO-LANE BLACKTOP.
Another little-seen film,
"Two-Lane Blacktop" actually
has nothing in common with
"Easy Rider" except its setting.
Monte Hellman's staging of scenes
which stay on the fringes of the
action may have disappointed the
thrill-seekers, but his brand of
American existentialism has a
power all its own, as does Warren
Oates' performance as a fast
talking, fast driving would-be
hustler.
THE DEVILS. Of the three
films Ken Russell bestowed upon
us this year, "The Devils" seems
to be the one in which the
director's extraordinary energy
and perversity is best matched
with the material. "The Music
Lovers," on the other hand, was
so frenzied that the psychological
base provided by Tchaikovsky was
lost and"The Boy Friend," while
pleasant and inventive, was not
sufficiently modulated for a
musical. "The Devils" still stands
as an immensely powerful
experience.

THE RISE OF LOUIS XIV.
Finally released in the Bay Area,
Roberto Rossellini's historical
study is the virtual antithesis of
"The Devils," as it is absolutely
controlled, steady and objective.
The deceptively simple style of
the film actually represents the
culminated maturity, intelligence
and theory Rossellini has
developed over 35 years and as
such, may be the purest, least
mannered style in the cinema
today.
GIMME SHELTER. The release
of this superb documentary was
held up in the Bay Area,
presumably because of the Hell's
Angel trial early this year, and
thus must be included in this
year's compilation. The Maysles
Brothers' coverage of the Stones'
tour and Altamont is amazingly
thorough and the freeze frame of
Jagger making his exit may be the
most effective use of this tired
technique since "The 400 Blows."
THE CONFORMIST. The
script may leave something to be
desired, but then Bernardo
Bertolucci may be the only
talented disciple of Josef von
Sternberg and Max Ophuls
working in the cinema today and

"The Conformist" proves beyond
a doubt his abilities as a stylist
with light and color. Visually,
perhaps the richest film of the
year.

Other films I admired over the
past year include Sam Peckinpah's
"Straw Dogs," Jan Kadar's
"Adrift," Don Siegel's "Dirty
Harry," Mike Nichols' "Carnal
Knowledge," William Friedkin's
"The French Connection," Alan
Pakula's "Klute," Vittorio
DeSica's "The Garden of the
F in zi-Co nt in is, " John
Schlesinger's "Sunday Bloody
Sunday," Pier Paolo Pasolini's
"The Decameron" and Louis
Malle's "Murmur of the Heart."

Leading performances by actors
this year were Peter Finch in
"Sunday Bloody Sunday," Jack
Nicholson in "Carnal Knowledge"
(though his directional debut
"Drive, He Said" was a minor
disaster), Warren Beatty in
"McCabe and Mrs. Miller,"
Jean-Marie Patte in "The Rise of
Louis XIV," Clint Eastwood in
"The Beguiled" and "Dirty
Harry," Oliver Reed in "The
Devils," Jean-Claude Brialy in
"Claire's Knee," Malcoln
McDowell in "A Clockwork
Orange," Gene Hackman in "The
French Connection" and Richard
M. Nixon in "Millhouse."

Best female performances

included Bibi Andersson in "The
Touch," Jane Fonda in "Klute,"
Stephane Audran in "Le
Boucher," Ursula Andress in
"Perfect Friday," Faye Dunaway
in "Puzzle of a Downfall Child,"
Lea Masari in "Murmur of the
Heart" and Glenda Jackson in
"Sunday Bloody Sunday."
Though they could hardly be
called performances in a year of
distressingly few meaty female
parts, the mere appearances of
Jennifer O'Neill in "Summer of
'42," Angie Dickenson in "Pretty
Maids All in a Row" and Paula
Pritchett in "Adrift" were
memorable at very least.
* * *
Among supporting actors, I
liked Andy Robinson in "Dirty
Harry," David Warner in "Perfect
Friday," Warren Oates in
"Two-Lane Blacktop," David
Carradine and Hugh Millais in
"McCabe and Mrs. Miller," Ron
Leibman in "Where's Papa?" and
A 1 Vint in "Panic in Needle Park."

Tops among supporting females
were Dominique Sanda in "The
Conformist" and"The Garden of
the Finzi-Continis," Ellen Burstyn
in "The Last Picture Show" and
"Alex in Wonderland," Marcia
Rodd in "Little Murders," Trish
Van Devere in "Where's Papa?",
Beatrice Romand in "Claire's
Knee," Georgina Hale in "The
Devils" and"The Boy Friend,"
Susan George in "Straw Dogs,"
Jessica Walter in "Play Misty For
Me," Elizabeth Hartman in "The
Beguiled" and Pat Nixon in
"Millhouse."
