# Rare Exhibit
## Toulouse At Gallery 
### ANDY ISRAEL 
The Stanford Art Gallery
(across from the History Corner)
continues its excellent exhibit of
the prints and drawings of
Toulouse-Latrec through
February 20th. The Sherman
Butlers' collection on display at
the gallery represents one of the
most extensive collections of the
artist's work in the U.S., and the
owners' quest for quality and
deep discernment manifest
themselves in the works on
display.
One wonders whether the artist
might not be on Madison Avenue
were he alive today. Posters
dominate the collection
advertising things ranging from
literary reviews to cabarets and

give hints of something pretty
much of the past, the
commissioning of artists to
advertise. Aside from the
commissioning of works by
"Time" magazine for its covers or
by "Playboy" for its short stories,
little evidence of such an
artist-sponsor relationship survives
today. The parts of the collection
which aren't posters are for the
most part black and white or
color lithographs by the artist
with an occasional watercolor,
pencil sketch, or ink drawing.
Toulouse-Latrec's works lend
the small gallery an ambience of
grandness and vitality, one can
imagine the posters or other
lithographs on walls of the metro
in late nineteenth century Paris or

on the covers of periodicals
vended by booksellers from stalls
on the Seine. The artist concerns
himself with people and in each
work not only portrays a face or a
form but also electrifies the scene
with moods and emotions. While
the artist's style rarely drifts into
the realm of the representational,
he nonetheless strikes the viewer
with the realness of his subjects.
In the introduction to the
exhibition catalogue which was
artfully compiled by Mrs. Betsy
Fryberger, acting curator of the
Stanford Museum and designed by
Ann Rosener of the General
Secretary's office, Art
Department Chairman Lorenz
Eitner comments on
Toulouse-Latrec. "He was perhaps
the last artist of great stature to
take his subject matter from the
reality of contemporary life, in its
most public, familiar, widely
shared aspect—not from a world
of his private imagination. His
graphic style is functional; it
illuminates reality, and even in its
most startling distortion defines
character. All his work is a form
of portraiture, of penetrating
realism both in the psychological
and social sense."
The most fascinating quality of
the works displayed lies in the
artist's ability to express such
diverse shadings of mood in the
bohemian legend without using
extensive detail. A poster from a
Parisian cabaret shows four chorus
girls dancing, but strikingly on
closer observation one realizes
that each face carries a totally
different expression; the unity of
costume of the dancers does not
spill over as a unity of mood. With
a few strokes of the brush the
artist liberates a host of
psychological comments on his
subject matter.
Walking through the narrow
aisles of the gallery approximates
a stroll through the crowded
streets of 1890's Paris when the
works of Toulouse-Latrec line the
walls. One can only speculate
what the artist would have
produced had he lived past the age
of 37 and farther into the
twentieth century than 1901. The
gallery has hours of 10-5 Tuesday
through Friday and 1-5 Saturday
and Sunday. Guided tours are
offered each Tuesday at 2 p.m.
for those interested in learning
more about the works. An exhibit
of this quality probably won't
come back to the Bay Area for
years so don't miss it.

"Time" magazine for its covers or
by "Playboy" for its short stories,
little evidence of such an
artist-sponsor relationship survives
today. The parts of the collection
which aren't posters are for the
most part black and white or
color lithographs by the artist
with an occasional watercolor,
pencil sketch, or ink drawing.
Toulouse-Latrec's works lend
the small gallery an ambience of
grandness and vitality, one can
imagine the posters or other
lithographs on walls of the metro
in late nineteenth century Paris or

on the covers of periodicals
vended by booksellers from stalls
on the Seine. The artist concerns
himself with people and in each
work not only portrays a face or a
form but also electrifies the scene
with moods and emotions. While
the artist's style rarely drifts into
the realm of the representational,
he nonetheless strikes the viewer
with the realness of his subjects.
In the introduction to the
exhibition catalogue which was
artfully compiled by Mrs. Betsy
Fryberger, acting curator of the
Stanford Museum and designed by
Ann Rosener of the General
Secretary's office, Art
Department Chairman Lorenz
Eitner comments on
Toulouse-Latrec. "He was perhaps
the last artist of great stature to
take his subject matter from the
reality of contemporary life, in its
most public, familiar, widely
shared aspect—not from a world
of his private imagination. His
graphic style is functional; it
illuminates reality, and even in its
most startling distortion defines
character. All his work is a form
of portraiture, of penetrating
realism both in the psychological
and social sense."
The most fascinating quality of
the works displayed lies in the
artist's ability to express such
diverse shadings of mood in the
bohemian legend without using
extensive detail. A poster from a
Parisian cabaret shows four chorus
girls dancing, but strikingly on
closer observation one realizes
that each face carries a totally
different expression; the unity of
costume of the dancers does not
spill over as a unity of mood. With
a few strokes of the brush the
artist liberates a host of
psychological comments on his
subject matter.
Walking through the narrow
aisles of the gallery approximates
a stroll through the crowded
streets of 1890's Paris when the
works of Toulouse-Latrec line the
walls. One can only speculate
what the artist would have
produced had he lived past the age
of 37 and farther into the
twentieth century than 1901. The
gallery has hours of 10-5 Tuesday
through Friday and 1-5 Saturday
and Sunday. Guided tours are
offered each Tuesday at 2 p.m.
for those interested in learning
more about the works. An exhibit
of this quality probably won't
come back to the Bay Area for
years so don't miss it.

AT THE GALLERY—Among the Toulouse-Lautrec works on display
at the Stanford Art Gallery through February 13 are "Mr. Tom, the
Coachman of the Rothschild Family," (above), "The Box with the
Golden Mask," (top right) and "Rosemersholm" and "Le Gage,"
(bottom right).
The Stanford Art Gallery
(across from the History Corner)
continues its excellent exhibit of
the prints and drawings of
Toulouse-Latrec through
February 20th. The Sherman
Butlers' collection on display at
the gallery represents one of the
most extensive collections of the
artist's work in the U.S., and the
owners' quest for quality and
deep discernment manifest
themselves in the works on
display.
One wonders whether the artist
might not be on Madison Avenue
were he alive today. Posters
dominate the collection
advertising things ranging from
literary reviews to cabarets and

give hints of something pretty
much of the past, the
commissioning of artists to
advertise. Aside from the
commissioning of works by
"Time" magazine for its covers or
by "Playboy" for its short stories,
little evidence of such an
artist-sponsor relationship survives
today. The parts of the collection
