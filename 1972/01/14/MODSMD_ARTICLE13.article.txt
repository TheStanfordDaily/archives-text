# Nearly Perfect Night Of Music
## 
### DAVID WILLIAMS 
Nothing is ever perfect, but last Wednesday's sumphony concert
came close enough to satisfy most tastes. Mozart's Symphony No. 32,
represents a subtle blend of the learned French and Italian buffa
styles, and is most interesting in the complete polish of the string
writing; in that respect, this work is hardly less subtle than the
"Prague" Symphony of 1786. Seiji Ozawa's reading was very good
indeed; his tempi seemed the right ones, and his control over the
orchestra was complete.
I confess that this was the first time I had heard violinist Stuart
Canin play. He is a good violinist, and the tone he adopted this
evening reminded one of that of Arnold Steinhardt of the Guarneri
Quartet. His playing of the outer movements was quite good, though
one has to admit an occasional lapse, when extreme subtlety was
demanded. -
Indeed this Mozart concerto, K 219, the fifth and last of the
authenticated works in this form, is as technically difficult as the
serious minded nineteen year old composer could make it, without
lessening its capacity to charm. The last movement, the inspiration for
the work's "nickname," "Turkish," is one whose rondos employ
Turkish themes, a style then very much in vogue. As such, Canin's
playing smelled a bit of the Julliard school, perhaps a bit too
self-conscious.
The second movement, whose mood is something like sunrise on
the lake at Versailles, suffered at moments from a tendency to display
all of Mozart's many allusions to an older generation of composers, a
certain harshness in the second violins, and a curious use of rests
which succeeded in breaking down an elegant romance into a
precocious composition in three parts. Still the purity of Canin's tone,
and his own sense of Mozart's sensitivity to fifty years of Italian violin
composition more than saved this masterpiece.
Mahler's "Knaben Wunderhorn" was begun in 1888 and completed,
I believe in 1899, or so that is what two sets of program notes suggest.
The work is a setting of German folk songs compiled by Achim von
Arnin and Clemens Bretano, and is one of Mahler's finest
compositions. The tone is pure Vienna, though last night's reading was
a trifle Italianate I thought, because of Ozawa's tendancy to
underplay the angst weltsmertz of a crazy mixed-up Jewish Viennese
genius in an age of Wagner quality, usually invoked by an allusion to
Schubert's darkest music, the late lieder, especially "Der Winterreise."
Since this work is a staple of Janet Baker's repetoire (She has
recorded it with Geraint Evans), and she and John Shirley-Quirk have
worked together often, I was surprised by their obvious discomfort at
the beginning of the Mahler, and when she began to initiate
Swcharzkopf, and he to almost overdo the helden-baritone business, I
began to believe that they too were a bit taken aback.
Indeed only in the last couple of songs, where angst conquers all,
was the sense of ensemble in any way apparent. Still the orchestra was
well drilled—although an upgrading trip is a tiresome and expensive
way to do it—and it is prue heaven watching these two singers (who
along with Helen Watts are the brightest stars in the English song,
Bach cantata, German leider, Baroque opera super-group) mature and
somehow improve. In all a delight. Ah yes, Baker wore her green
dress, you know, the one with the sequins.

underplay the angst weltsmertz of a crazy mixed-up Jewish Viennese
genius in an age of Wagner quality, usually invoked by an allusion to
Schubert's darkest music, the late lieder, especially "Der Winterreise."
Since this work is a staple of Janet Baker's repetoire (She has
recorded it with Geraint Evans), and she and John Shirley-Quirk have
worked together often, I was surprised by their obvious discomfort at
the beginning of the Mahler, and when she began to initiate
Swcharzkopf, and he to almost overdo the helden-baritone business, I
began to believe that they too were a bit taken aback.
Indeed only in the last couple of songs, where angst conquers all,
was the sense of ensemble in any way apparent. Still the orchestra was
well drilled—although an upgrading trip is a tiresome and expensive
way to do it—and it is prue heaven watching these two singers (who
along with Helen Watts are the brightest stars in the English song,
Bach cantata, German leider, Baroque opera super-group) mature and
somehow improve. In all a delight. Ah yes, Baker wore her green
dress, you know, the one with the sequins.


Nothing is ever perfect, but last Wednesday's sumphony concert
came close enough to satisfy most tastes. Mozart's Symphony No. 32,
represents a subtle blend of the learned French and Italian buffa
styles, and is most interesting in the complete polish of the string
writing; in that respect, this work is hardly less subtle than the
"Prague" Symphony of 1786. Seiji Ozawa's reading was very good
indeed; his tempi seemed the right ones, and his control over the
orchestra was complete.
I confess that this was the first time I had heard violinist Stuart
Canin play. He is a good violinist, and the tone he adopted this
evening reminded one of that of Arnold Steinhardt of the Guarneri
Quartet. His playing of the outer movements was quite good, though
one has to admit an occasional lapse, when extreme subtlety was
demanded. -
Indeed this Mozart concerto, K 219, the fifth and last of the
authenticated works in this form, is as technically difficult as the
serious minded nineteen year old composer could make it, without
lessening its capacity to charm. The last movement, the inspiration for
the work's "nickname," "Turkish," is one whose rondos employ
Turkish themes, a style then very much in vogue. As such, Canin's
playing smelled a bit of the Julliard school, perhaps a bit too
self-conscious.
The second movement, whose mood is something like sunrise on
the lake at Versailles, suffered at moments from a tendency to display
all of Mozart's many allusions to an older generation of composers, a
certain harshness in the second violins, and a curious use of rests
which succeeded in breaking down an elegant romance into a
precocious composition in three parts. Still the purity of Canin's tone,
and his own sense of Mozart's sensitivity to fifty years of Italian violin
composition more than saved this masterpiece.
Mahler's "Knaben Wunderhorn" was begun in 1888 and completed,
I believe in 1899, or so that is what two sets of program notes suggest.
The work is a setting of German folk songs compiled by Achim von
Arnin and Clemens Bretano, and is one of Mahler's finest
compositions. The tone is pure Vienna, though last night's reading was
a trifle Italianate I thought, because of Ozawa's tendancy to
underplay the angst weltsmertz of a crazy mixed-up Jewish Viennese
genius in an age of Wagner quality, usually invoked by an allusion to
Schubert's darkest music, the late lieder, especially "Der Winterreise."
