Mozart: Le Nozze di Figaro:
Wixell, Norman, Freni, Ganzarolli,
Minton, Davis;
In the first place, I must
confess that I have been looking
forward to the "Colin Davis
version" of this great opera ever
since it was announced some

months ago, and it was certainly
worth the wait. With only minor
reservations, one must
acknowledge that it is the best
available recording, in its way as
interesting and rewarding as any
of the remarkable recordings of
Mozart's operas that have been
released in the last few years:
Kertez's La Clamenza di Tito,
Solte's Die Zamberilote,
Leinsdori's Cosi Fan Tutte, and
Davis's Idomeneo. What
distinguishes all of these
recordings is the conductor's
critical intelligence, and in the
case of this Figaro, that
intelligence extends itself to deal
quite successfully with crucial
editorial problems.
In Act 111, Davis skillfully places
the section from Barbarina's
recitative, "Andiam bell paggio,"
to the countess's aria, "Dove
Sono," before the sextet,
eliminating a series of sequential
problems, the most crucial of
which is having Susanna appear
with the money (presumably from
the countess) before we see the
countess waiting for Susanna, "E
Susanna non vien."
According to the lucid and
elegant liner notes, Davis's
rearrangement restores the text to
its original form; Mozart and Da
Ponte changed the order to allow
Bussani, who played both
Antonio and Bartolo, time to
change costumes.
In the fourth act, Davis
includes two rarely-performed
arias, written for later
performances, one for Marcellina,

on the subject of patience and the
long suffering of women, and one
for Basilio, a fable filled with
wordly advice, between
Barbarina's key scene and Figaro's
great aria, the diatribe against
women, "Aprite un po' quegli
occhi."
The thematic balance thus
created between the newly
reconciled mother and son, with
Basilio's "In quegli anmi"
between their arias, is all but
perfect and the entire section
beginning with Barbarina's arioso
provides a bridge from the sextet
to the great finale of the last set,
gives added depth to two minor
characters and effectively slows
down the pace of this unusually
fast moving and complicated part
of the opera. The changes alone
more than recommend the
performance.
Most of the singers are rather
young, and it is perhaps fair to say
that some of the finer points of
characterization lack definition,
though the singing is everywhere
quite fine. For instance, I think
Panerai's more "mature" Figaro
(Vox-Rosbaud, deleted) is to be
preferred to Ganzarolli's
somewhat low keyed reading, and
perhaps Dieskau's Count is more
convincingly autocratic than
Wixell's, but the fact is that Wixell
is very good indeed, and
Ganzarolli and his admirers have
much to look forward to.
Freni's Susanna, on the other
hand, is without equal, and while
Jessye Norman's countess lacks
some of the assurance one senses

in Jurinac's performance
(Epic-Bohm, deleted), still she is a
great young soprano, new to
American audiences, whose
success in Europe seems
absolutely justified; her acting is
as convincing as her voice is
beautiful, which a careful listening
to her rendering of "Dove Sono"
will surely indicate.
Yvonne Minton's Cherubino is
good enough; Robert Tear's
Basilio, especially in the new aria,
"In quegli anni," just this side of
perfection. Clifford Grant's
Bartolo is really quite remarkable,
and his singing of "La Vendetta"
cannot be too highly praised.
Maria Casula's Marcellina is
delicately and beautifully sung,
and her interpretation of this
complicated matron subtle and
intelligent. David Lennox as Don
Curzio, Lillian Watson as
Barbarina, and Paul Hudson's
Antonio are all very good and
round out what is perhaps the
most evenly and consistently well
sung and well acted Figaro
imaginable. The ensembles, so
important in this opera, are the
real strength of this recording, no
part of the opera is sacrificed to
concept of the "star."
In short, this interpretation
gives Mozart's Marriage of Figaro
fresh life; thus the piece's timeless
exhuberance, its subtle but
obviously revoltuionary overtones
are fully realized. This recording is
and will remain the Figaro for
some years to come; it is from
every point of view exquisite and
more than worth the expense.

to her rendering of "Dove Sono"
will surely indicate.
Yvonne Minton's Cherubino is
good enough; Robert Tear's
Basilio, especially in the new aria,
"In quegli anni," just this side of
perfection. Clifford Grant's
Bartolo is really quite remarkable,
and his singing of "La Vendetta"
cannot be too highly praised.
Maria Casula's Marcellina is
delicately and beautifully sung,
and her interpretation of this
complicated matron subtle and
intelligent. David Lennox as Don
Curzio, Lillian Watson as
Barbarina, and Paul Hudson's
Antonio are all very good and
round out what is perhaps the
most evenly and consistently well
sung and well acted Figaro
imaginable. The ensembles, so
important in this opera, are the
real strength of this recording, no
part of the opera is sacrificed to
concept of the "star."
In short, this interpretation
gives Mozart's Marriage of Figaro
fresh life; thus the piece's timeless
exhuberance, its subtle but
obviously revoltuionary overtones
are fully realized. This recording is
and will remain the Figaro for
some years to come; it is from
every point of view exquisite and
more than worth the expense.
-DAVID WILLIAMS
Mozart: Le Nozze di Figaro:
Wixell, Norman, Freni, Ganzarolli,
Minton, Davis;
In the first place, I must
confess that I have been looking
forward to the "Colin Davis
version" of this great opera ever
since it was announced some

months ago, and it was certainly
worth the wait. With only minor
reservations, one must
acknowledge that it is the best
available recording, in its way as
interesting and rewarding as any
of the remarkable recordings of
Mozart's operas that have been
released in the last few years:
Kertez's La Clamenza di Tito,
Solte's Die Zamberilote,
Leinsdori's Cosi Fan Tutte, and
Davis's Idomeneo. What
distinguishes all of these
recordings is the conductor's
critical intelligence, and in the
case of this Figaro, that
intelligence extends itself to deal
quite successfully with crucial
editorial problems.
In Act 111, Davis skillfully places
the section from Barbarina's
recitative, "Andiam bell paggio,"
to the countess's aria, "Dove
Sono," before the sextet,
eliminating a series of sequential
problems, the most crucial of
which is having Susanna appear
with the money (presumably from
the countess) before we see the
countess waiting for Susanna, "E
Susanna non vien."
According to the lucid and
elegant liner notes, Davis's
rearrangement restores the text to
its original form; Mozart and Da
Ponte changed the order to allow
Bussani, who played both
Antonio and Bartolo, time to
change costumes.
In the fourth act, Davis
includes two rarely-performed
arias, written for later
performances, one for Marcellina,

on the subject of patience and the
long suffering of women, and one
for Basilio, a fable filled with
wordly advice, between
Barbarina's key scene and Figaro's
great aria, the diatribe against
women, "Aprite un po' quegli
occhi."
The thematic balance thus
created between the newly
reconciled mother and son, with
Basilio's "In quegli anmi"
between their arias, is all but
perfect and the entire section
beginning with Barbarina's arioso
provides a bridge from the sextet
to the great finale of the last set,
gives added depth to two minor
characters and effectively slows
down the pace of this unusually
fast moving and complicated part
of the opera. The changes alone
more than recommend the
performance.
Most of the singers are rather
young, and it is perhaps fair to say
that some of the finer points of
characterization lack definition,
though the singing is everywhere
quite fine. For instance, I think
Panerai's more "mature" Figaro
(Vox-Rosbaud, deleted) is to be
preferred to Ganzarolli's
somewhat low keyed reading, and
perhaps Dieskau's Count is more
convincingly autocratic than
Wixell's, but the fact is that Wixell
is very good indeed, and
Ganzarolli and his admirers have
much to look forward to.
Freni's Susanna, on the other
hand, is without equal, and while
Jessye Norman's countess lacks
some of the assurance one senses

in Jurinac's performance
(Epic-Bohm, deleted), still she is a
great young soprano, new to
American audiences, whose
success in Europe seems
absolutely justified; her acting is
as convincing as her voice is
beautiful, which a careful listening
to her rendering of "Dove Sono"
will surely indicate.
Yvonne Minton's Cherubino is

to the great finale of the last set,
gives added depth to two minor
characters and effectively slows
down the pace of this unusually
fast moving and complicated part
of the opera. The changes alone
more than recommend the
performance.
Most of the singers are rather
young, and it is perhaps fair to say
that some of the finer points of
characterization lack definition,
though the singing is everywhere
quite fine. For instance, I think
Panerai's more "mature" Figaro
(Vox-Rosbaud, deleted) is to be
preferred to Ganzarolli's
somewhat low keyed reading, and
perhaps Dieskau's Count is more
convincingly autocratic than
Wixell's, but the fact is that Wixell
is very good indeed, and
Ganzarolli and his admirers have
much to look forward to.
Freni's Susanna, on the other
hand, is without equal, and while
Jessye Norman's countess lacks
some of the assurance one senses

in Jurinac's performance
(Epic-Bohm, deleted), still she is a
great young soprano, new to
American audiences, whose
success in Europe seems
absolutely justified; her acting is
as convincing as her voice is
beautiful, which a careful listening
to her rendering of "Dove Sono"
will surely indicate.
Yvonne Minton's Cherubino is
good enough; Robert Tear's
Basilio, especially in the new aria,
"In quegli anni," just this side of
perfection. Clifford Grant's
Bartolo is really quite remarkable,
and his singing of "La Vendetta"
cannot be too highly praised.
Maria Casula's Marcellina is
delicately and beautifully sung,
and her interpretation of this
complicated matron subtle and
intelligent. David Lennox as Don
Curzio, Lillian Watson as
Barbarina, and Paul Hudson's
Antonio are all very good and
round out what is perhaps the
most evenly and consistently well
sung and well acted Figaro
imaginable. The ensembles, so
important in this opera, are the
real strength of this recording, no
part of the opera is sacrificed to
concept of the "star."
In short, this interpretation
gives Mozart's Marriage of Figaro
fresh life; thus the piece's timeless
exhuberance, its subtle but
obviously revoltuionary overtones
are fully realized. This recording is
and will remain the Figaro for
some years to come; it is from
every point of view exquisite and
more than worth the expense.
