# Swimmers Face OSU
## Aquatic Action Tomorrow 
### DOUG WILSON 
Stanford's varsity swimmers,
with a 3-0 record in a still-early
season, host Oregon State
University at 2 p.m. tomorrow at
Encina Pool in their only contest
this weekend. A meet with the
University of Oregon, slated for
this afternoon, has been cancelled.
The Stanford junior varsity will
host the De Anza Swim Club
Saturday morning at 10 a.m.
The De Anza and Oregon State
meets, while not expected to be
challenging contests, will
nevertheless provide area
swimming fans with their first full
dual-meet look at the promising
newcomers-many of them
freshman-on whom coach Jim
Gaughran will count heavily for
success this year.
Breaststroke Duo
Returning, of course, the
breaststroke duo considered to be
the toughest in the nation, Brian
Job and Dave Shilling. Job last
week set a new pool record for
the 100 yd. breaststroke with a
59.9 clocking in the 300-yd.
breaststroke relay event of the
Stanford Invitational, well under
the NCAA qualifying standard of
1:01.2. Shilling, a senior, and
captain of this year's squad, also
cracked the minute mark in the
relay, one of Stanford's four
winning efforts in last week's
meet.
Also returning is junior sprint
star Steve Carey, middle distance
standout Tim Broderick, and
sophomore Rick Longinotti, who
swam an impressive 52.7 butterfly
leg of the 400-yd. medley relay.
Butterfly Men
Joining Longinotti in the
butterfly this season will be
freshmen John Stalker and
Richard Foreman. Stalker, from
Eugene, Ore., was timed in :53.1
in the 100 butterfly last week.
Foreman, whose recorded best
time in the 100 fly is :53.3, hails
from Portland.
Broderick is likely to be joined

in the 1000 and 500 freestyle by
returnee Terry Sutton, a
sophomore who recorded a
lifetime best of 9:57.6 in the
1000-yd. event against Cal on
December 18.
Against Oregon State, Carey
will likely lead a sprint team
consisting of 1971 All—American
sprinter Martin Pedley, Ken
Hammer, Marty Clevenger, and
Bob Wilson. Carey's :21.4 (for 50
yds.) in the Invitational is .1 off
his personal best. Pedley, from
Palo Alto, qualified for
All-American honors last year
with a :21.19 clocking.
Freshman Debut
Perhpas the most interesting
"debut" of the afternoon,
however, will be that of the twc
freshman backstrokers whc,
contributed to Stanford's victory
in the backstroke relay las;
weekend. Randy Whitchurch, who
will probably join Job, Longinotti
and Carey in Stanford's medley
relay efforts this season, posted a
2:00.3 clocking in the meet, two
seconds faster than that recorded
by teammate Jack Deppe. Both,
however, have swum the 200-yd.
backstroke event in under two
minutes, with personal bests that
are four-tenths of a second apart.
In the 200 yd. freestyle,
veterans Broderick and Hammer
will be joined this year by frosh
Dean Anderson, a 1970 AAU
Indoor finalist in this event, and
by freshman Bert Webb, of
Bakersfield.

Arizona diver Rich Rector, of
Scottsdale, and junior Steve
Riffenburgh of Pasadena head
diving coach Clyde Devine's 1972
team. Devine, who last year saw
protege Bill Main win Pac-8 titles
in both the 1- and 3-meter events,
was undoubtedly pleased with the
expectedly strong finish of his
diving tandem in last week's
competition, when Rector and
Riffenburgh placed second in both
team-diving events.

WHERE EAGLES DARE-Sophomore Rich Longinotti churns to a 52.7 timing in his butterfly leg of the Indians' medley relay team last
weekend in the Stanford Invitational Relays. Closing in on his lifetime best of 51.7 in the 100 yard butterfly, Longinotti will lend strong
support to Coach Jim Gaughran's title hopes. Freshmen Jock Stalker and Rich Foreman also have shown promise in the butterfly, and if the
young trio reach their potential, Stanford will have one of the strongest butterfly threats in the country. The Indian swimmers will face Oregon
State tomorrow at 2:00 p.m. at Stanford Pool.

WHERE EAGLES DARE-Sophomore Rich Longinotti churns to a 52.7 timing in his butterfly leg of the Indians' medley relay team last
weekend in the Stanford Invitational Relays. Closing in on his lifetime best of 51.7 in the 100 yard butterfly, Longinotti will lend strong
support to Coach Jim Gaughran's title hopes. Freshmen Jock Stalker and Rich Foreman also have shown promise in the butterfly, and if the
young trio reach their potential, Stanford will have one of the strongest butterfly threats in the country. The Indian swimmers will face Oregon
State tomorrow at 2:00 p.m. at Stanford Pool.
Stanford's varsity swimmers,
with a 3-0 record in a still-early
season, host Oregon State
University at 2 p.m. tomorrow at
Encina Pool in their only contest
this weekend. A meet with the
University of Oregon, slated for
this afternoon, has been cancelled.
The Stanford junior varsity will
host the De Anza Swim Club
Saturday morning at 10 a.m.
The De Anza and Oregon State
meets, while not expected to be
challenging contests, will
nevertheless provide area
swimming fans with their first full
dual-meet look at the promising
newcomers-many of them
freshman-on whom coach Jim
Gaughran will count heavily for
success this year.
Breaststroke Duo
Returning, of course, the
breaststroke duo considered to be
the toughest in the nation, Brian
Job and Dave Shilling. Job last
week set a new pool record for
the 100 yd. breaststroke with a
59.9 clocking in the 300-yd.
breaststroke relay event of the
Stanford Invitational, well under
the NCAA qualifying standard of
1:01.2. Shilling, a senior, and
captain of this year's squad, also
cracked the minute mark in the
relay, one of Stanford's four
winning efforts in last week's
meet.
Also returning is junior sprint
star Steve Carey, middle distance
standout Tim Broderick, and
sophomore Rick Longinotti, who
swam an impressive 52.7 butterfly
leg of the 400-yd. medley relay.
Butterfly Men
Joining Longinotti in the
butterfly this season will be
freshmen John Stalker and
Richard Foreman. Stalker, from
Eugene, Ore., was timed in :53.1
in the 100 butterfly last week.
Foreman, whose recorded best
time in the 100 fly is :53.3, hails
from Portland.
Broderick is likely to be joined

in the 1000 and 500 freestyle by
returnee Terry Sutton, a
sophomore who recorded a
lifetime best of 9:57.6 in the
1000-yd. event against Cal on
December 18.
Against Oregon State, Carey
will likely lead a sprint team
consisting of 1971 All—American
sprinter Martin Pedley, Ken
Hammer, Marty Clevenger, and
Bob Wilson. Carey's :21.4 (for 50
yds.) in the Invitational is .1 off
his personal best. Pedley, from
Palo Alto, qualified for
All-American honors last year
with a :21.19 clocking.
Freshman Debut
Perhpas the most interesting
"debut" of the afternoon,
however, will be that of the twc
freshman backstrokers whc,
contributed to Stanford's victory
in the backstroke relay las;
weekend. Randy Whitchurch, who
will probably join Job, Longinotti
and Carey in Stanford's medley
relay efforts this season, posted a
2:00.3 clocking in the meet, two
seconds faster than that recorded
by teammate Jack Deppe. Both,
however, have swum the 200-yd.
backstroke event in under two
minutes, with personal bests that
are four-tenths of a second apart.
In the 200 yd. freestyle,
veterans Broderick and Hammer
will be joined this year by frosh
Dean Anderson, a 1970 AAU
Indoor finalist in this event, and
by freshman Bert Webb, of
Bakersfield.

Arizona diver Rich Rector, of
Scottsdale, and junior Steve
Riffenburgh of Pasadena head
diving coach Clyde Devine's 1972
team. Devine, who last year saw
protege Bill Main win Pac-8 titles
in both the 1- and 3-meter events,
was undoubtedly pleased with the
expectedly strong finish of his
diving tandem in last week's
competition, when Rector and
Riffenburgh placed second in both
team-diving events.

Indoor finalist in this event, and
by freshman Bert Webb, of
Bakersfield.

Arizona diver Rich Rector, of
Scottsdale, and junior Steve
Riffenburgh of Pasadena head
diving coach Clyde Devine's 1972
team. Devine, who last year saw
protege Bill Main win Pac-8 titles
in both the 1- and 3-meter events,
was undoubtedly pleased with the
expectedly strong finish of his
diving tandem in last week's
competition, when Rector and
Riffenburgh placed second in both
team-diving events.

WHERE EAGLES DARE-Sophomore Rich Longinotti churns to a 52.7 timing in his butterfly leg of the Indians' medley relay team last
weekend in the Stanford Invitational Relays. Closing in on his lifetime best of 51.7 in the 100 yard butterfly, Longinotti will lend strong
support to Coach Jim Gaughran's title hopes. Freshmen Jock Stalker and Rich Foreman also have shown promise in the butterfly, and if the
young trio reach their potential, Stanford will have one of the strongest butterfly threats in the country. The Indian swimmers will face Oregon
State tomorrow at 2:00 p.m. at Stanford Pool.
