## Indians Face Best 
### Charlie Hoffman 
As the Indians pulled away from the Washington Huskies in
overtime Saturday night, the band started chanting "We're number
one." For a brief moment, the crowd joined in but support for the
cheer rapidly faded, perhaps as the onlookers remembered who the
Cards have to play this weekend.
Unfortunately, the Tribe has to take its beautiful five game winning
streak up against the very best in the nation tonight. UCLA's Walton
gang has not lost a game this season and it does not look like they will
ever falter this year.
New Formation
Concentrating on spreading out their offensive patterns and
working the ball inside for lay-ups, the Indians have finally arrived at
what appears to be a victory formula. Dave Frost, Mike Mann, Steve
Shupe, and Bob Buell have been doing a fine job of getting open
under the basket, and even Claude Terry is scoring most of his points
from short range now.
Stanford has met and defeated one of the most talented big men on
the west coast, Steve Hawes of Washington. The spectacular play of
sophomore Mike Mann was primarily responsible for this, but the
aggresbive Stanford defense rates second in the Pac-8. The Card
offense also occupies second place in the conference with an average
of 80.5 behind UCLA's 82.5
The Walton Gang
Mann and the Indians will have a much tougher time handling super
sophomore Bill Walton and his talented teammates. The Bruins have
already proved their worth by drubbing seventh ranked Ohio State in
the finals of the Bruin Classic. Dallmar's Cards are streaking, but
UCLA is too strong at every position for Stanford to engineer an
upset in the cacophonous confines of Pauley Pavilion.
Saturday, the powerful USC Trojans will host the Indians and the
possibilities for an upset victory will be stronger in this contest. Poor
shooting brought on a 20 point loss to Penn and overconfidence
allowed a hustling Arizona squad to edge the Trojans by one point in
their season opener.
USC still has a 9-2 record and ranks as one of the nation's
finest squads. A patient Indian attack, however, combined with a few
superb individual perfomances could give Stanford the win.

Out of a massive electoral turnout of 65 voters emerged the
LSJUMB's Incomparable Tuba Section plus One Bagpipe and Maybe
A Dead Sheep as next year's yell leaders. Specifically, the winning yell
leaders are Steve Baird, Bruce Dau, Scott Marraige, Mike Holubar,
Rick Miller, John Tolan, and Bill Walter. Who says apathy is dead?
