# COSS Placement Hearings Near End, Advice To Lyman Due Next Month
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
This Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday the Committee on Student
Services (COSS) held its second week
of hearings on the functions of the
Center.
The Committee was asked by
President Lyman last May to deliver
recommendations to him on the April
referendum in which students voted
1947 to 1496 and 1758 to 1596 to
prohibit the military and war-related
industries, respectively, from
recruiting on campus.
If recruiters for both the Armed
Services and war-related industries are
banned from the Placement Center,
Stanford might well lose over $11
million in annual revenue.
$10 million of Department of
Defense funding might be eliminated
in accordance with an amendment to
the 1970 Military Procurement Act. It
is also possible that a portion of the
$1.6 million donated to the University
by all corporations which recruit at
the Placement Center would be cut off
if recruiting is restricted.
Poor Attendance
During the week COSS continued to
suffer from poor attendance by its
members, a carryover from last week.
On Wednesday only four of the
Committee's ten members attended.
What made the lack of interest in
Wednesday's session so surprising was
that Dr. Ralph Keller, the Director of
the Placement Center, appeared that
night to present his views as the
supervisor of the activities being
considered by COSS.
COSS will hold a final session next
Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. in Tresidder
Room 271. Scheduled to appear that
night are SLAC Professor Pierre Noyes
and ASSU Professor of Social Thought
David Josephson.

COSS Chairman Tim Clark, a senior,
told the Daily that he expected the
Committee to present its
recommendations to President Lyman
early next month.
More Information
Appearing before seven of the
committee members Tuesday night
were Dan Higgins of the Stanford
Veterans for Peace, Dwain Fullerton
of the University's General Secretary's
Office and East Asia Studies grad
student Earl Martin of the Concerned
Asian Scholars.
Pointing out that it was "dangerous
to set a precedent censoring freedom
of speech," Higgins said that "the
individual can make his own decisions
on an enlightened basis" without
interference from the student body.
However Higgins did say that he
believed that recruiting corporations
"ought to be required to give more
complete information on what they're
doing, including any defense contracts
they hold."
No Honeywell Beans
Fullerton said that about 100 of the
199 corporations which recruit at the
Placement Center have contributed to
the University during this academic
year. Making specific reference to one
of the more controversial recruiting
corporations, Fullerton said that
"Honeywell doesn't give us beans."
He reported that recruiting
corporations gave a total of
$1,641,000 to the University during
the last academic year. Apparently this
would be the greatest possible amount
that might be lost to the University
from corporations if recruiting were
restricted.
Martin, who did volunteer work
with civilian refugees in Vietnam from
1966 to 1969, recounted instances of
seeing Vietnamese children being

killed by American forces. He said that
Stanford should no more allow the
military and war-related industries to
recruit than it would allow a "group
that would run through the streets of
Palo Alto killing children" to recruit.
Dean Pettit Testifies
On Wednesday, the following
witnesses testified: Dean Joseph Pettit
of the School of Engineering,
Education grad student Howard
Alford and Placement Center Director
Keller.
Pettit called those who favored the
Placement Center recruitment ban
"hypocrites" because students could
just as easily "walk across the street"
to talk to a recruiter. He argued that
"certain rights shouldn't be swept
aside even by a majority vote."
Pettit continued that we should "not
let somebody else prejudge a student
and his ambitions." He concluded that
the referendum was a "hollow and
unconvincing gesture."

Alford said that because of the good
work the Placement Center had done
in the past, "I would support any
expenditures made by Dr. Keller."
The witnesses at last night's hearing
were students Jim Robinson, Pete
Munk, Ron Miller, Paula Johnson and
Bill Munselle. Five committee
members were present.
Essentially, Robinson, Miller,
Johnson and Munselle each supported
continued operation of the Placement
Center without any new restrictions
placed upon its activities.
Undesirable Weapons
Munk favored allowing the Armed
Services and their essential supplies to
recruit. He added that the producers
of "undesirable weapons" should be
banned. Munk identified these
weapons as those which "not only kill
but maim and disfigure. They make
the whole process of killing a more
impersonal, indiscriminate thing to
do."
