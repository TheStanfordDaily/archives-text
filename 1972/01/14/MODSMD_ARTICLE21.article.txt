Troop Pull-out Announced
WASHINGTON -President Nixon announced Thursday
that 70,000 more American troops will be brought home
from Vietnam before May, reducing the U.S. military
force there to the smallest in nearly seven years.
The new withdrawal order, stepping up the pace lightly,
will bring the American commitment in Vietnam down to
69,000 men on May 1-a drop of 474,000 from the peak
shortly after Nixon took office in early 1969.
Following Nixon's brief announcement, Secretary of
Defense Melvin R. Laird fired what sounded like the
opening volley of the President's reelection campaign with
a sharp shot at Democractic White House hopefuls.
"Strangely enough, some of those individuals that are
going around the country today criticizing the program to
withdraw Americans from Vietnam were silent in 1968
and before when we were on the escalator going up, up
and up," Laird said.
"Now when we are going, down, down, down, it seems
they have changed this position and are critical of the
President and the program ... to withdraw Americans
from Southeast Asia and South Vietnam."
Wallace Declares: Fly Right
TALLAHASSEE—Gov. George C. Wallace of Alabama
jumped into the presidential race as a Democrat Thursday
and said if he wins Florida's March 14 primary it will
force other Democrats to "straighten up and fly right"
and scare President Nixon into stopping school busing.
In the formal announcement of his candidacy at the
state Capital in Tallahassee, Fla., the 52-year-old Wallace
said that he was a "conscientious candidate" out to win
the Democratic nomination. He was a third party entry in
1968.
Crime Combat Funded
WASHINGTON—Vice President Spiro T. Agnew and Atty.
Gen. John N. Mitchell announced Thursday a $160
million program to fight crimre in eight cities over the
next three years.
"There will be an across-the-board attack on street
crimes and burglaries, the kinds of crimes that are the
most prevalent and the most feared, Agnew told a news
conference also attended by mayors and governors of the
cities and states affected.
Jerris Leonard, chief of the Law Enforcement

Assistance Administration, indicated however, that the
only thing new about the "high-impact program" is that
various agencies and units of local government will be
forced to work together.
Mayor Kenneth Gibson, of Newark, said he was
surprised to be called to Washington and told that his city
will receive $5 million this year, $10 million in fiscal
1972, and $5 million in fiscal i973.
Gibson said he understood the new money will be
distributed in a non-categorized fashion, somewhat similar
to Preseident Nixon's proposal for revenue sharing.
Aside from Newark, the money will go to Baltimore,
Atlanta, Cleveland, Dallas, Denver, St. Louis and Portland.

SAN FRANCISCO-A former Soledad Prison inmate said
Thursday he saw the late George Jackson strike John Mills
moments before the slain guard was allegedly hurled over
a railing.
"I seen him pick up the body, really gently, almost like
a baby, and came down with three blows." said William
Worzella, 30, at the trial of John Clutchette and Fletta
Drumgo in the Jan. 16, 1970, slaying of Mills.
Kill Ms. Ump?
ALABNY, N.Y. - New York's highest court ruled
Thursday that Mrs. Bernice Gera, a 41-year-old Queens
housewife, can be a lady umpire in professional baseball.
The 5-2 decision rejected the appeal of the New
York-Pennsylvania Professional Baseball League and the
National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues.
They had appealed a ruling by a lower court that they
were guilty of unlawful discrimination in denying Mrs.
Gera the opportunity to become an umpire. Mrs. Gera
said, "It's been a long fight, but every decision has been in
my favor."
