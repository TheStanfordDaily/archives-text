# 'Happy Hour' Returns
## Faculty Club Gets Liquor License 
### DANIEL BRENNER 
After more than two years of
licensing procedure, the Faculty Club
has a happy hour. The State Alcoholic
Beverage Commission (ABC) issued
the license January 4 which permits
table service of wines to the dining
room and a bar with a waiter and
waitress service to the lounge and
dining rooms.
The formal unveiling of the new
facility, slated for high noon today,
was scooped by the overanxious
clubmembers. According to a usually
unimpeachable source, bottles of vino
were out on the tables yesterday, a
sign that members' reception to the
new program will be bubbly.
The January 4 decision smashed the
foes of the drive to get alcoholic
beverages on campus. Up until
October, 1969, faculty members were
able to keep private supplies in liquor
lockers rented by the Club. But then
the ABC ordered the lockers cleared,
stating that the arrangement was in
violation of the California Business
and Professions Code. Furthermore
they said that keeping or serving liquor
without a license was a public
nuisance.
In reply the Faculty Club came to
its feet and formally applied for a
license. It was denied at first; but last
month the Appeals Board of ABC
granted the Club a license (Daily, Dec.
1). And when the ABC failed to appeal
the Appeals Court decision on
December 28, the path was cleared.
However Phillip Duffy, assistant to
Faculty Club manager Forrest Tregea,
said that the bar would not be running
at full capacity for a few weeks as the
bar was not finished.
Indeed the barroom was in some
disorder yesterday. Crates of alcohol
were stacked up in what will become
the new facility. In the backs of the
room were the now derelict liquor
lockers, outdated vehicles for a sport

that seems to be entering a new era of
popularity at the Club.
There has been much speculation as
to what the effect of the license will
be on campus. Will there be a new
Sen-Sen counter established at
Tresidder? Will Club members order
expresso with their luncheon or
dinner? Will it be safe to light a
cigarette near a 1:15 p.m. class

professor? Will students continue to be
content with Martindale's Sparkling
Apple juice from the Coffee House
when more exciting things are
available nearby?
These and other questions will be
raised from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.
and from 4:30 p.m. to 9 p.m. daily,
the hours when the bar will be open.

that seems to be entering a new era of
popularity at the Club.
There has been much speculation as
to what the effect of the license will
be on campus. Will there be a new
Sen-Sen counter established at
Tresidder? Will Club members order
expresso with their luncheon or
dinner? Will it be safe to light a
cigarette near a 1:15 p.m. class

professor? Will students continue to be
content with Martindale's Sparkling
Apple juice from the Coffee House
when more exciting things are
available nearby?
These and other questions will be
raised from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.
and from 4:30 p.m. to 9 p.m. daily,
the hours when the bar will be open.
After more than two years of
licensing procedure, the Faculty Club
has a happy hour. The State Alcoholic
Beverage Commission (ABC) issued
the license January 4 which permits
table service of wines to the dining
room and a bar with a waiter and
waitress service to the lounge and
dining rooms.
The formal unveiling of the new
facility, slated for high noon today,
was scooped by the overanxious
clubmembers. According to a usually
unimpeachable source, bottles of vino
were out on the tables yesterday, a
sign that members' reception to the
new program will be bubbly.
The January 4 decision smashed the
foes of the drive to get alcoholic
beverages on campus. Up until
October, 1969, faculty members were
able to keep private supplies in liquor
lockers rented by the Club. But then
the ABC ordered the lockers cleared,
stating that the arrangement was in
violation of the California Business
and Professions Code. Furthermore
they said that keeping or serving liquor
without a license was a public
nuisance.
In reply the Faculty Club came to
its feet and formally applied for a
license. It was denied at first; but last
month the Appeals Board of ABC
granted the Club a license (Daily, Dec.
1). And when the ABC failed to appeal
the Appeals Court decision on
December 28, the path was cleared.
However Phillip Duffy, assistant to
Faculty Club manager Forrest Tregea,
said that the bar would not be running
at full capacity for a few weeks as the
bar was not finished.
Indeed the barroom was in some
disorder yesterday. Crates of alcohol
were stacked up in what will become
the new facility. In the backs of the
room were the now derelict liquor
lockers, outdated vehicles for a sport
