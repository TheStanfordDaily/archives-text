# Encina Bomb Threat
## 
### 
An early-morning bomb threat
delayed the opening of Encina Hall by
about an hour yesterday.
A female caller to the University at
about 7:30 a.m. yesterday claimed
that five bombs had been planted in
the administrative building and had
been set to explode some time during
the day.
Employees, who normally report
for work at 8 a.m, were not allowed

into the building until 9, after a
search of the premises did not reveal
any explosive devices.
The bomb threat followed a night
which saw an attempted arson fire at
the Hansen Microwave Laboratory and
a vandalized power pole.
The fire caused no damage to the air
conditioning unit at the lab, but the
vandals completely felled the pole near
the Stanford riding stables.
