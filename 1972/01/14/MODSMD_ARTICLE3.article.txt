# Bank Expected On Campus Despite Selection Problems
## 
### 
A campus bank proposed last spring in the campaign of
the current ASSU Council of Presidents isexpected to be
in full operation by September, according to University
business official Rodney Adams.
However, disagreement between student and University
Business Office representatives may lead to problems
unless differences over selection procedures to be used in
awarding the contract for the forthcoming campus bank
are resolved.
Six banks have indicated interest in establishing a
branch on campus, and the contract decision is expected
within the next six weeks so that the bank can be in
operation by September.
However, to what degree students will be involved in the
initial decision, which will serve as a recommendation to
President Lyman and the Board of Trustees, is not clear
and a discrepancy is clearly apparent.
Rodney Adams, a university investment manager,
claims the impending decision will be made "by the
University Administrative Staff and hopefully agreed to
by the Tresidder Union Committee," while Chuck
Peterson, student head of the Committee has stated that
he wants the Committee "in on the final decision."
The location of the bank is yet undecided. The
Tresidder Committee and ASSU Council of Presidents
strongly favor a site in Tresidder as a means of boosting
the student union's sagging income.
Adams appeared less concerned over the location and
cautioned that the banks themselves may prefer other
sites such as Encina. He noted that he prefers not to

interfere with the bank's decision saying "We'd like to get
the best rent possible."
Adams has, thus far, solicited student participation by
requesting that the Tresidder Union Committee, the
ASSU, and the Business School Committee on Corporate
Responsibility submit criteria for bank selection, although
to what extent they will be followed has not been stated.
Difference of opinion is also apparent in the submitted
criteria with perhaps the major disagreement between the
groups dealing with whether or not a bank with
investments in such controversial areas such as South
Africa should be considered or not.
The ASSU Council of Presidents, although it did not
submit criteria and chose instead to be represented by the
Tresidder Union Committee, who it asked be in on the
final decision, stated that outside investments should be
seriously considered and included it with low cost of
services and student hiring as being a point of major
concern.
The Tresidder Committee also included investment
policy in its list of criteria, but committee head Peterson
added that it had not been labeled as mandatory since "It
is hard to get a good idea of where the investments really
99
are.
Adams claims that "most banks would almost
immediately back out if we try to dictate their investment
policies." To want a bank to hire employees that
represent the community is one thing, but to dictate its
investment policies is a little harder to get a handle on."
He cited the Polaroid Company as a corporation that
Regardless of extensive
investigation, it is still not completely
definite that there will be a bank since
following the awarding of the contract
the bank will have to file with State or
Federal regulatory authorities, and a
demographic study justifying the need
for a bank will have to be carried out.
Indeed, Adams questioned "should
we have a bank at all?" He stated that
such a bank will directly compete with
the already existing Credit Union.

serve undergraduates, presently
provides savings accounts and loans to
other members of the University
community, but unlike the proposed
bank, it does not offer checking

accounts.

the government's Apartheid policy,
but has used its power to push for laws

Adams has headed investigation into
establishing a bank on campus, and has
received signs of interest from six of
nine banks with whom he talked.
Three of these, Wells Fargo Bank,
Security National Bank, and United
California Bank have made repeated
campus visits or submitted drafts.
In addition, Security Pacific Bank,
the Bank of California, and a bank
now in the process of forming, the
Peninsula Communities Bank, have
indicated interest and an 1 also under

Adams has, thus far, solicited student participation by
requesting that the Tresidder Union Committee, the
ASSU, and the Business School Committee on Corporate
Responsibility submit criteria for bank selection, although
to what extent they will be followed has not been stated.
Difference of opinion is also apparent in the submitted
criteria with perhaps the major disagreement between the
groups dealing with whether or not a bank with
investments in such controversial areas such as South
Africa should be considered or not.
The ASSU Council of Presidents, although it did not
submit criteria and chose instead to be represented by the
Tresidder Union Committee, who it asked be in on the
final decision, stated that outside investments should be
seriously considered and included it with low cost of
services and student hiring as being a point of major
concern.
The Tresidder Committee also included investment
policy in its list of criteria, but committee head Peterson
added that it had not been labeled as mandatory since "It
is hard to get a good idea of where the investments really
99
are.
Adams claims that "most banks would almost
immediately back out if we try to dictate their investment

are resolved.
Six banks have indicated interest in establishing a

within the next six weeks so that the bank can be in

However, to what degree students will be involved in the
initial decision, which will serve as a recommendation to
President Lyman and the Board of Trustees, is not clear
and a discrepancy is clearly apparent.
Rodney Adams, a university investment manager,
claims the impending decision will be made "by the
University Administrative Staff and hopefully agreed to
by the Tresidder Union Committee," while Chuck
Peterson, student head of the Committee has stated that
