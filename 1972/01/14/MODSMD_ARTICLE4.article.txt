# Alumnus Sought In Bombings
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
The FBI is seeking a Stanford
psychology alumnus in connection
with bombs found last week in safe
deposit boxes of banks in San
Francisco, Chicago, and New York
City.
Ronald received a
Stanford psychology masters degree in
1962 and a PhD in alleged
yesterday to be the "Christopher
Mohr" who rented safe deposit boxes
where nine time bombs were planted.
Kaufman was remembered on
campus as a quiet, intense, bright man,

who developed political awareness as a
civil rights worker in Mississippi.
One of the nine bombs reportedly
exploded in San Francisco last
September, causing little damage.
Police were led to the others by
letters, indicating they were "unusual
prototype bombs" which could be
planted months ahead of their
detonation time.
The letters said such devices could
be used to hold buildings "hostage '
during bargaining for the release of
"political prisoners."
After leaving Stanford, Kaufman
reportedly lived in Chicago and
Berkeley. The Chicago Daily News
alleged he was a close friend of Yippie
Abbie Hoffman during the 1968
Democratic Convention in Chicago.
Went AWOL
The FBI charged Kaufman had
joined the Army under a false name in
July, then had gone AWOL last
month.
Before coming to Stanford,
Kaufman, 33, attended the University
of Wisconsin and served two years in
the Army.
Those who knew Kaufman at
Stanford remember his shift from
academic interests to political
commitment. The change came when
he joined other students and
professors who travelled to Mississippi
for a voter registration drive in
summer, 1964.
Stanford graduate Nancy Gillam,
who worked with Kaufman in the civil
rights project, said the experience
became "a driving force for him, as it
was for so many people who were
down there. He wanted to return."
Kaufman apparently did return to
the South with the Student
Nonviolent Coordinating Committee
(SNCC) after he finished his doctoral
thesis. The paper (involving the effects
on pigeons of different wavelengths of
light) was described as "a very nice
piece of work" by Psychology
Professor Gordon Bower.
But Bower said that "by the time
(Kaufman) got his PhD, he was much
more interested in doing political and

community work than experimental
psychology."
'Fed Up'
Gillam, who said she remembered
the cages of "white pigeons" in his
office, added that after the Mississippi
trip Kaufman grew "sort of fed up
with the academic scene and finally
pulled away."
She said that Kaufman "worked
very hard" after the 1964 trip to
organize the "Stanford Friends of
SNCC," a small civil rights group on
campus.
"He was very quiet, very intense,
very bright," Gillam said. "And I
assume he is still all of those things."
Gillam, who was an undergraduate
then and is a law student in Berkeley
now, recalled that Kaufman "used to
tease me about being so cynical at my
young age. He was more accepting of
things."
Discussed Vietnam
Bob Beyers, Stanford's public
information officer, said he discussed
civil rights and Vietnam with Kaufman
at a dinner after both returned from
volunteer work in the South.
"He presented, as early as '64 or
'65, what would be called now a
radical analysis of Vietnam," Beyers
said.

"He did not view it as any accident
of American policy, and he saw a
relationship of what was happening
there and what was happening in this
country," according to Beyers.
Beyers, who said he exchanged
Christmas cards with Kaufman for
several years after they met, called him
"the type who thought things through
for himself, in contrast to some people
who have prepackaged opinions of
everything."
