## OPINIONS Abortion, FDR, Heroin, And Crime 
### 
An excellent discussion of the
philosophical questions surrounding
the, abortion issue—philosophical
questions which must be resolved
so that public policy in this area
will be morally correct—appears in
an article entitled "A Defense of
Abortion," in the fall 1971 issue
of the new scholarly journal
Philosophy & Public Affairs. The
author is Judith Harvis Thomson,
a professor of philosophy at MIT.
Thomson grants, only for the
sake of argument, the premise of
most opponents of abortion: that
the fetus is a person from the
moment of conception.
She then asks the reader to
imagine the following situation:
"you wake up in the morning and
find yourself back to back in bed
with an unconscious violinist. A
famous unconscious violinist. He
has been found to have a fatal
kidney ailment, and the Society
of Music Lovers has canvassed all
the available medical records and
found that you alone have the
right blood type to help.
"They have therefore
kidnapped you, and last night the
violinist's circulatory system was
plugged into yours, so that your
kidneys can be used to extract
poisons from his blood, as well as
your own.
"The director of the hospital
ndw tells you, 'Look, we're sorry
the Society of Music Lovers did
this to you—we would never have
permitted it if we had known. But
still, they did it, and the violinist
now is plugged into you. To
unplug you would be to kill him.
But never mind, it's only for nine
months. By then he will have
recovered from his ailment, and
can safely be unplugged from
you.' "
Thomson then discusses
whether it is morally incumbent
on one to accede to such a
situation. She concludes that "the
fact that for continued life that
violinist needs the continued use
of your kidneys does not establish
that he has a right to be given the
continued use of your kidneys.
"He certainly has no right
against you that you should give
him continued use of your
kidneys. For nobody has any right
to use your kidneys unless you
give him such a right; and nobody
has the right against you that you
shall give him this right—if you do
allow him to go on using your
kidneys, this is a kindness on your
part, and not something he can
claim from you as his due."
Thomson also deals with many
other arguments, among them the
argument that "would give the
unborn person a right to its
mother's body only if her
pregnancy resulted from a
voluntary act. undertaken in full
knowledge of the chance a
pregnancy might result from it."
Thomson supplies several
examples which show that his
argument is not as strong as its
proponents think it is: "If the
room is stuffy and I therefore

open a window to air it, and a
burglar climbs in, it would be
absurd to say, 'Ah, now he can
stay, she's given him a right to the
use of her house—for she is
partially responsible for his
presence there, having voluntarily
done what enabled him to get in,
in full knowledge that there are
such things as burglars, and that
burglars burgle."
"It would be still more absurd
to say this if I had had bars
installed outside my windows,
precisely to prevent burglars from

getting in, and a burglar got in
only because of a defect in the
bars. . .
"Again, suppose it were like
this: people-seeds drift about in
the air like pollen, and if you
open your windows, one may
drift in and take root in your
carpets or upholstery. You don't
want children, so you fix up your
windows with fine mesh screens,
the very best you can buy. As can
happen, however, and on very,
very rare occasions does happen,
one of the screens is defective;
and a seed drifts in and takes root.
Does the person-plant who now
develops have a right to the use of
your house?"
FDR Promoted War
According to the January 2
New York Times, formerly secret
British government papers made
public at the beginning of the year
"said that President Franklin D.
Roosevelt told Prime Minister
Winston Churchill in August,
1941, that he was looking for an
incident to justify opening
hostilities" against Germany.
This revelation adds further
evidence to the case of those who
contend that Franklin Roosevelt
deliberately deceived the
American public. He had told
the "mothers and fathers" of the
United States "again and again
and again," as he put in a
campaign speech in Boston,
"Your boys are not going to be
sent into any foreign wars."
But here is new additional
evidence, from the British War
Cabinet papers, that Roosevelt
intended to take America into
World War 11.
The Cabinet minutes, quoting
Churchill indirectly, concerning
the August 1941 Atlantic
Conference between Roosevelt
and Churchill, said:
"The President had said he
would wage war but not declare it
and that he would become more
and more provocative... .
Everything was to be done to

force an incident. . .
"The President. . . made it
clear that he would look for an
incident which would justify him
in opening hostilities."
It is clear that the kind of
justification for aggression which
Lyndon Johnson found in the
Tonkin Gulf incident was a
pattern which he had inherited.
Furthermore, these Cabinet
minutes vindicate the historical
research on World War II of such
controversial scholars as Harry
Elmer Barnes, Charles A. Beard,

Charles C. Tansill, Francis
Neilson, and William Henry
Chamberlain. To see how well
these historians documented the
interventionist nature of
American foreign policy (now at
work in Vietnam), one has only to
read chapters four and 15, on the
Atlantic Conference, from Beard's
President Roosevelt and the
Coming of the War, 1941, in the
light of the new historical data
from the British War Cabinet
minutes.
Heroin & Gls
Rehabilitating GI dope fiends
from Vietnam has become a
major, well-publicized "uplift"
project of the Nixon
administration. In an article
entitled "Scapegoating 'Military
Addicts': The Helping Hand
Strikes Again," in the January
1972 issue of Trans-action,
Thomas S. Szasz, professor of
psychiatry at the Upstate Medical
Center of the State University of
New York, challenges this whole
drug abuse prevention and
drug-user rehabilitation program.
In his article Szasz warns
against letting politicians and
physicians "become inquisitors in
a holy war on drug addiction." He
goes on to raise several questions
and to offer some statements of
fact.
One question he raises is put as
follows: "Dr. (Jerome H.) Jaffe
(the head of the new Special
Action Office of Drug Abuse
Prevention) is considered an
expert on drug addiction because
'When he arrived in Illinois in
1966 from the Bronx (reported in
the New York Times, June 18,
1971, p. 22), there wasn't a single
state-supported bed for the
treatment of drug addicts in

Illinois. The first year he got 300
beds. Now there are 1,800.' Are
we to infer from this that drug
addicts are sick? Indeed, that they
are so sick that they need beds to
lie in all day?
"What is the proper duty of the
physician: To create beds for
people who do not want to lie in
them? Or to offer treatment—in
or out of bed—to those who want
it, and to those only?"
Finally, Szasz debunks the
equation of heroin use with
crime: "It is repeatedly and
authoritatively stated that heroin
causes crime. This is .. . false.
Heroin does not cause crime. The
prohibition of free trade in heroin
does."
Crime & Blacks
In the January 3 New York
Times Magazine, Harvard
sociologist Nathan Glazer, sets
forth these thoughts on the status
of blacks who have committed
crimes or are in prisons:
"We see that the equation,
black equals crime, is more and
more accepted by black militants
themselves. Perhaps the first
noteworthy example of this was
Eldridge Cleaver's astonishing
effort in his autobiography to
turn his career as a rapist into a
political act—and the even more
astonishing fact that this
effrontery was accepted by
liberals and radicals as a deep
analysis. We now see that many
black criminals may view their
actions as political ones.
"Criminals have always had
justifications for their crimes.
They used to have weak

justifications, such as, 'All people
do it but only we are caught,' or,
'It isn't my fault but the fault of
my family.' Now we have the very
strongly made argument that
there is no such thing as black
crime—that all black criminals are
revolutionaries, all black prisoners
are political prisoners."
Her Own Body
The New York Times of
December 14 contained a
discussion of the Constitutional
reasons for repealing abortion
laws. Arguing before the Supreme
Court, Mrs. Sarah R. Wedington
contended that the Ninth
Amendment to the Constitution,
which points out that
enumeration of certain specific
rights in the Bill of Rights should
"not be construed to deny or
disparage others retained by the
people," was violated by
legislation that denied a woman
the right to decide whether to
have an abortion.
On June 17, 1970, the
Northern Texas District Court had
ruled on this case (Roe v. Wade).
It had stated that the Texas
statute was unconstitutionally
vague, depriving a woman of her
Ninth Amendment rights.
Possibly because of the
politically explosive potential of
the libertarian Ninth Amendment,
judges are very reluctant to decide
cases on Ninth Amendment
grounds. But attorney Sarah
Wedington decided to directly
confront the question of a
woman's fundamental right to
choose whether or not to bear
children.
