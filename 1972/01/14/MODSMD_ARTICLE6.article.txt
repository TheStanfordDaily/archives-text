## Story Of Radicals 
### 
Following is an editorial reprinted from The Daily Report, the
largest evening paper in San Bernardino County.
Hearings for two radicals concluded yesterday. One was conducted
on the Stanford University campus and the other was a trial in
Moscow.
At the center of the Stanford faculty hearing board proceedings
was English Professor H. Bruce Franklin, a self-admitted revolutionary
against the United States.
He was charged with illegally occupying a university building,
defying police orders and, worst of all, calling for outright violence
during a student dissent rally.
The hearing board, which took on Franklin's case after he was
suspended by the university president, heard testimony from 113
witnesses. The hearings were conducted at the professor's request and
lasted six weeks.
Yesterday the board decided that testimony proved the charges
against Franklin were true, and that the professor was not only guilty
of calling for violence, but was successful in bringing it about.
The board's recommendation: Franklin should lose his job.
It took scarcely any time at all for liberal forces to rally to
Franklin's cause. Certainly he will become a martyr, a "victim of
political persecution" and, to many, a real live, brand new liberal
extremist hero.
Fellow teacher, Linus Pauling, who some regard as one who prefers
socialism to a wider freedom, was quoted as saying the board's
recommendation in the Franklin case was a "great blow, not just to
academic freedom, but to freedom of speech."
He might also have added it could be construed to be a blow against
the freedom to riot and to be violent. He did not.
Compare the case of Franklin, who spends far more time censuring
the ideology practiced in America than he does decrying the ideology
practiced in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, with that of
Vladimir K. Bukovsky in Moscow.
Bukovsky's trial lasted a single day. He was charged with
distributing leaflets criticizing his government for placing political
dissidents in mental institutions and filling them with mind altering
drugs.
Bukovsky was not accused of any violent deed or inciting others to
riot.
For his leaflet-distributing action Bukovsky was sentenced to 12
years in a labor camp and exileâ€”probably in Siberia.
Franklin, on the other hand, might (or might not) lose his teaching
job.
The contrast between the deeds and "sentences" of these two
radicals pretty well illustrates the difference between a Communist
state and one that Professor Franklin is so quick to alter by means of
violence.
