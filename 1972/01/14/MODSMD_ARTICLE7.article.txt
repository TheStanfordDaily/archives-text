## Ruling Class Fears Bruce 
### 
There are a lot of so-called
"radicals" on the Stanford
campus who are decrying the lack
of spirit and militancy among the
undergraduate students. A third
world leader told me, "many
students don't understand the
issues. Several in the dorms think
it's the Administration's right to
fire Bruce since Stanford is private
property." It is their right.
A few days ago the N.Y. Times
editorialized that Stanford was
right to fire a disrupter like Bruce
for advocating the physical
liberation of the corporate
universities. Perhaps a few clever
people will ask themselves why
the N.Y. Times or Time magazine
are so interested in one short
statured Maoist English professor.

The answer is obvious, of course,
Bruce is a practicing revolutionary
whose aim is, in fact, to strip his
bosses (the accusers) of all their
rights and power, the most basic
of which are the absolute rights
and power of capital and the
capitalist class. Under the present
system in the U.S., the ruling class
has not only a right to fire Bruce,
they have the intention and
obligation to fire him and to kill
him soon after, for they rule by
violence and violence alone.
Bruce recognizes that his job is
a small loss compared to the
sacrifices of the Vietnamese
people or of George and Jonathan
Jackson, Malcolm X, Martin
Luther King; but people at
Stanford Corporation Farm had

better learn that Bruce's life (as
well as his livelihood), the lives of
all students, and more important,
the lives of ordinary people from
Saigon to New York City will
remain in the hands of the
(sometimes liberal) U.S. ruling
class unless masses fight back, as
the Vietnamese have done. David
Packard's 2.6 million dollar
reward to Stanford as well as the
editorial of the "prestigious" N.Y.
Times can hardly go unnoticed.
People, wake up.
The N.Y. Times says that
Bruce's supporters are
"predictably" crying about
academic freedom. This is a
boldfaced lie which shows how
the ruling class is trying to conceal
its attack on our most basic

Constitutional right, the right of
free speech and open advocacy. It
is not Bruce's job they are trying
to take back, but his voice, his
mind and his ability to even
communicate with people.
We have reached the key point
in the development of fascism in
the U.S., for now to simply
advocate and fight to preserve the
Bill of Rights (the rights of free
speech, assembly, the right to
keep and bear arms) is a truly
revolutionary position. Of course
there are many at Stanford
aligned with the ruling class; theirs
are more pressing concerns: law,
order, stability, more war,
oppression and exploitation under
U.S. imperialism; for the next
nine months many of them are
going to call for peace and make
believe that McGovern is going to
be president or Nixon is interested
in the welfare of Asian peoples.
But the world cannot wait for
Stanford students to make up
their minds when the facts are
obvious. We, in the community,
must all hang together, or we will
all hang separately. We have no
alternative but to take an eye for
an eye. The loss of our free speech
at Stanford is indeed more serious
than the failures of or
Administration action against any
anti-war demonstrations or other
actions we have tried in 8 years
here; more serious than the
months and years spent in jail by
Stanford students and ex-students
prosecuted by Stanford for
anti-war activity.
While the loss of Bruce's job is
a small loss, the loss of Bruce's
voice is not a small one, and the
implicit loss of all our free speech
through extra-legal bullshit (it
actually started with the trustees'
injunctions the past three years,
keeping certain people off the
campus) is grave enough to
warrant massive retaliation.
If the N.Y. Times and Packard
and Poison Gas Hewlett fear
Bruce's advocacy, we must show
them that broad sections of the
people are willing to accept their
challenge and turn revolutionary
theory into action these pigs
cannot escape. We can make the
administration of this corporation
stand still. We can kick Lyman off
our campus for good. Sterling
retired and Pitzer was fired
because of student resistance.
Fascist Lyman must go now, not
DoD research. DoD research can
go underground but the corporate
leaders need their public puppet
bureaucrats.
By attacking the Stanford
administration we can teach
liberal-fascists there is no place to
hide from the people. Off Lyman
and all academic hacks who try to
take his place.
This demand the trustees will
not meet but it is one we must
force them to meet, by any means
necessary. Bruce for Lyman or the
sky's the limit.
We can successfully fight back
only if we shoot the arrow
straight at the target. Off the chief
lackeys; they are more vulnerable
than the Defense (Offense)
Department.
