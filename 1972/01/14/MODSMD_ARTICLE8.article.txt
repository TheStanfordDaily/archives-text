## Two Important Points 
### 
In the aftermath of the decision
of the Advisory Board in the H.
Bruce Franklin case, much has
been written and said regarding
the opinion, most of it by people
who could have been predicted in
advance to object in the strongest
terms to any decision other than
total exoneration.
To the vast majority of the
people at Stanford, honestly
attempting to evaluate the
decision, two matters of utmost
importance must be kept in mind.
First, the opinion was not
prepared or written by the
University administration or some
faceless "they" so often referred
to by adverse critics. It was
written by seven members of the
Stanford faculty, chosen not by
the President, but by a vote of the
faculty itself. Each member of the
Advisory Board was obviously

elected because he is a person of
outstanding stature and
independence. And although it
should not be necessary to point
this out, individual Board
members, by deed as well as by
word, have over a long period
manifested both their opposition
to the Vietnam war and their
dedication to academic freedom.
Second, the decision of the
seven members of the Board was
unanimous on the crucial section
of the opinion, setting forth the
general standards of conduct to be
applied to the facts. All seven
members applied those standards
so as to recommend the
imposition of a serious penalty,
amounting at least to a period of
suspension without pay. The
attempt by adverse critics to
attack only a "majority opinion"
for its standards is therefore

absurd. The major disagreement
among board members, petty by
comparison, was on a relatively
small area of fact, and on how
serious a penalty the facts
implied. And even then the two
dissenters noted that the
majority's view of the facts was
arguably correct.
Once it is recognized who
wrote the opinion and that it was
a unanimous decision on the
"guts" issue in the case, attention
can be turned unemotionally to
the question of whether or not
that issue was properly decided.
On a matter of such import one
should not rely on the legal

jack h. friedenthal

analysis of persons whose
involvement on behalf of
Professor Franklin throughout his
case thoroughly brands them as
advocates rather than as objective
constitutional scholars.
Whatever one believes the law
should be, a fair evaluation of the
cases which do exist demonstrate
two matters: first, it is simply not
true that no precedents exist to
support the Advisory Board's
decision on the free speech issue;
second, the cases cited as
precluding the Board's decision on
that issue do not do so.

total exoneration.
To the vast majority of the
people at Stanford, honestly
attempting to evaluate the
decision, two matters of utmost
importance must be kept in mind.
First, the opinion was not
prepared or written by the
University administration or some
faceless "they" so often referred
to by adverse critics. It was
written by seven members of the
Stanford faculty, chosen not by
the President, but by a vote of the
faculty itself. Each member of the
Advisory Board was obviously

elected because he is a person of
outstanding stature and
independence. And although it
should not be necessary to point
this out, individual Board
members, by deed as well as by
word, have over a long period
manifested both their opposition
to the Vietnam war and their
dedication to academic freedom.
Second, the decision of the
seven members of the Board was
unanimous on the crucial section
of the opinion, setting forth the
general standards of conduct to be
applied to the facts. All seven
members applied those standards
so as to recommend the
imposition of a serious penalty,
amounting at least to a period of
suspension without pay. The
attempt by adverse critics to
attack only a "majority opinion"
for its standards is therefore

absurd. The major disagreement
among board members, petty by
comparison, was on a relatively
small area of fact, and on how
serious a penalty the facts
implied. And even then the two
dissenters noted that the
majority's view of the facts was
arguably correct.
Once it is recognized who
wrote the opinion and that it was
a unanimous decision on the
"guts" issue in the case, attention
can be turned unemotionally to
the question of whether or not
that issue was properly decided.
On a matter of such import one
should not rely on the legal

jack h. friedenthal

analysis of persons whose
involvement on behalf of
Professor Franklin throughout his
case thoroughly brands them as
advocates rather than as objective
constitutional scholars.
Whatever one believes the law
should be, a fair evaluation of the
cases which do exist demonstrate
two matters: first, it is simply not
true that no precedents exist to
support the Advisory Board's
decision on the free speech issue;
second, the cases cited as
precluding the Board's decision on
that issue do not do so.

In the aftermath of the decision
of the Advisory Board in the H.
Bruce Franklin case, much has
been written and said regarding
the opinion, most of it by people
who could have been predicted in
advance to object in the strongest
terms to any decision other than
total exoneration.
