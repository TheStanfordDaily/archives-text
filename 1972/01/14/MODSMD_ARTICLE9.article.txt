Columbae Addition
Editor, THE DAILY:
In view of the fact that Bruce
Franklin has accepted the offer of
the Columbae House Lounge to
teach his course, we wish to
report that The Daily recklessly
edited the original Columbae
House statement, and now ask
that it reprint the following
sections of that statement which
were deleted.
We oppose the decision of the
Faculty Advisory Board to
recommend the dismissal of Bruce
Franklin.
Columbae was initiated around
a study of non-violence, and some
have argued that we had best not
support anyone who advocates
armed struggle. We deplore
whatever personal tendencies
Bruce Franklin may have for
insensitivity and authoritarianism,
just as we deplore these same
tendencies in ourselves and in
Stanford administrators. Many of
us followed the hearings closely
and found the prosecution's case
unconvincing. We believe that
Bruce Franklin's activities were
protected by guarantees to free
speech, and cannot be directly
linked to physical violence
actually done to anyone last
Spring.
We believe that the Stanford
war researchers and Stanford
ROTC and the Stanford trustees
can be linked to massive,
barbarous destruction of people
and lands, beyond anything Bruce
Franklin has ever done.
Several years ago Bruce
Franklin was a committed
pacifist. At one time he laid his
body down before napalm trucks
in Redwood City—a classic
non-violent act. We have to
admire him for taking personal
risk upon himself to protest
injustice, and for denying himself
the full luxury of a class position
he recognized as inherently
unequal, that of a Stanford
professor.
In the hearings it came out that
Bruce Franklin had changed from
liberal to pacifist-activist to
militant revolutionary.
We know why he is outraged,
and we too recognize the need for
radical change in the university
and the country. Even though we
dislike Bruce Franklin's
intimations of terrorism and
hatred, we agree with Gandhi that
the use of violence to fight for
justice is better than apathy. We
understand the existence of
conflict and the necessity for
struggle.
We will not, as the University
has done, avoid facing ideas that
differ from arid challenge our
own. We would welcome Bruce
Franklin's teaching in our lounge
as a real learning experience. He
has much to share with us. Like
every decision affecting many
people in Columbae, this one was
reached by consensus, after much
discussion. Should Professor
Franklin have other plans for

using our lounge that will
significantly affect the people
living here, he, like anyone else,
will have to submit them to the
consensus decision process.
We encourage every other
student residence on campus to
consider taking Columbae's action
for themselves (i.e. offering their
own lounge for Bruce Franklin to
teach in.).

Professorial Obligation
Editor, THE DAILY:
Although the Stanford
administration apparently did not
do so, I believe an argument could
be made that a Stanford professor
has a positive obligation to use
any influence he may have to
prevent actions that might result
in personal injury to students or
damage to university facilities.
In the rallies and Computation
Center events, the facts in dispute
have been whether Professor
Franklin incited violence or urged
persons to commit crimes against
the university. Obviously there are
differences of opinion on those
facts.
However, there seems no claim
or evidence that Professor
Franklin used his substantial
influence and his persuasive skills
to urge students to disperse, to
avoid potentially dangerous
confrontations, or to refrain from
destroying university facilities
when he had ample opportunity
to do so and clear indications that
a tense and explosive situation
prevailed.
It seems obvious that he did
not do so because he did not wish
to dampen the revolutionary
impulses of his keyed-up
audiences. As an individual
citizen, that was his privilege; as a
salaried member of the university
faculty, it was not. When he chose
to encourage, or to condone, or to
ignore the potentiality for
violence—whichever he did—he
abrogated his responsibility as a
member of the faculty and were
he intellectually honest, he would
have tendered his resignation at
that point.
It is a bizarre twist of logic to
argue that the magic of tenure
obliges the university to retain an
employee who will make no
effort, in a critical situation, Io
protect its students and facilities
from danger or destruction when
it is clearly within his power to do
so at no risk to his own person.

If I work for Dow Chemical
and disapprove of its activities, I
have every right to resign, with as
much lanfare as I can generate, in
order to focus attention on its
moral culpability, but I have no
right to expect it to continue to
pay my salary if I fail to report
sabotage to its equipment or
threats to the safety of its
personnel.
It is trite to say that freedom
and responsibility are
handmaidens, but like most trite
expressions, it is true. Professor
Franklin seeks the one without
the other, a stance which deserves
a decisive rejection by the entire
Stanford community.

Editor, THE DAILY:
I write to correct a substantial
error in a quotation attributed to
Glenn Campbell in the Jan. 11
fourth and final installment of the
series on the Hoover Institution.
Dr. Campbell was quoted as

saying he "had never willingly
invited a member of the
Communist Party to speak at a
Hoover conference, and had no
plans to do so in the future."
A tape of the Franklin hearings
testimony, from which the quote
arose, shows Dr. Campbell's
response to have been that he had
"not knowingly" issued such an
invitation. He made no mention
of the future, but did add that
invitations to speak were made on
the basis of scholarly
qualification, not political
affiliation.

Editor, THE DAILY:
We heard you today on the

Marv Gray show on KABC. You
know, the more we hear jerks like
you, the more we realize that
professors like that weirdo
Stanley (presumably Franklin]
have idiots like yourself so
brainwashed it's impossible for
you to think straight.
So you want academic freedom
for these creeps? Well, 1 wonder
how much academic freedom I'd
have if 1 was sitting in those same
classrooms protesting his teaching.
Do you think for one minute I'd
get passed? Or do you think he'd
allow me to sit in those
classrooms harassing him while
he was expousing his crap!
You know damn well he'd
throw us out!
You poor slobs of students;
when the hell are you going to
start thinking things out for
yourself? You've never learned to
think. Some call you the best
educated generation. I call you a
generation of slobs, followers of
any maladjusted misfit.
You only mouth your privelges
(sic) and none of you truly know
what a great privelge (sic) it is to

live in these United States.
I dare you to print this in your
paper! Come on big mouth—give
people like me equal opportunity.

More Hippies
Open letter to President Lyman,
On New Years Day I watched
the Stanford Band march in the
Tournament of Roses parade
before thousands of people, and
millions of TV viewers. To most
of the people, the Band represents
Stanford. Did you see the Band
that day?
I was so shocked I couldn't
believe what I saw, so when the
parade was rebroadcast over local
TV in the evening, I watched
again. Sure enough I had seen
what I thought I saw.
Several hippies in pseudo-band
uniforms.
Someone pulling a wagon filled
with soft drinks in the middle of
the band.
Very sloppy formation.
A band member with camera
taking pictures.
Is this what Stanford means to
you, Mr. Lyman? Are you proud
of Stanford? I'm not!
I watched the game on TV and
the band's half-time presentation.
Did you? Does Stanford really
stand "extreme left of center" as
presented by the Band? Does it
really turn out students who
represent the school by parodying
the values on which the school has
been built over the years? Is

sloppiness, poor taste, and
disregard for human values part of
the current curriculum at
Stanford?
The football team did not try to
be "the most unusual" in the
country, as the Stanford Observer
considers the Band. They played
to the best of their ability and
won. The Band played to the
worst of its abilty—and lost—lost
much respect for Stanford from
the millions of people who
watched its performance.
Mr. Lyman, I am personally
interested in how you, as leader of
the University, view these
incidents, and what you propose
to do in the future to prevent this
type of immature irresponsibility
of Arthur Barnes and his Band,
from hurting Stanford.

Litter Baskets
Editor, THE DAILY:
For a University as concerned
as Stanford is with ecology, there
is an amazing lack of litter
baskets. One can literally walk
across campus with a piece of
litter without spotting a single
receptacle for trash. I think the
University could afford to spend a
small portion of its recent 2.6
million dollar endowment on
litter baskets.

people in Columbae, this one was
reached by consensus, after much
discussion. Should Professor
Franklin have other plans for

using our lounge that will
significantly affect the people
living here, he, like anyone else,
will have to submit them to the
consensus decision process.
We encourage every other
student residence on campus to
consider taking Columbae's action
for themselves (i.e. offering their
own lounge for Bruce Franklin to
teach in.).

Professorial Obligation
Editor, THE DAILY:
Although the Stanford
administration apparently did not
do so, I believe an argument could
be made that a Stanford professor
has a positive obligation to use
any influence he may have to
prevent actions that might result
in personal injury to students or
damage to university facilities.
In the rallies and Computation
Center events, the facts in dispute
have been whether Professor
Franklin incited violence or urged
persons to commit crimes against
the university. Obviously there are
differences of opinion on those
facts.
However, there seems no claim
or evidence that Professor
Franklin used his substantial
influence and his persuasive skills
to urge students to disperse, to
avoid potentially dangerous
confrontations, or to refrain from
destroying university facilities
when he had ample opportunity
to do so and clear indications that
a tense and explosive situation
prevailed.
It seems obvious that he did
not do so because he did not wish
to dampen the revolutionary
impulses of his keyed-up
audiences. As an individual
citizen, that was his privilege; as a
salaried member of the university
faculty, it was not. When he chose
to encourage, or to condone, or to
ignore the potentiality for
violence—whichever he did—he
abrogated his responsibility as a
member of the faculty and were
he intellectually honest, he would
have tendered his resignation at
that point.
It is a bizarre twist of logic to
argue that the magic of tenure
obliges the university to retain an
employee who will make no
effort, in a critical situation, Io
protect its students and facilities
from danger or destruction when
it is clearly within his power to do
so at no risk to his own person.

If I work for Dow Chemical
and disapprove of its activities, I
have every right to resign, with as
much lanfare as I can generate, in
order to focus attention on its
moral culpability, but I have no
right to expect it to continue to
pay my salary if I fail to report
sabotage to its equipment or
threats to the safety of its
personnel.
It is trite to say that freedom
and responsibility are
handmaidens, but like most trite
expressions, it is true. Professor
Franklin seeks the one without
the other, a stance which deserves
a decisive rejection by the entire
Stanford community.

I write to correct a substantial
error in a quotation attributed to

fourth and final installment of the

Dr. Campbell was quoted as

saying he "had never willingly
invited a member of the
Communist Party to speak at a
Hoover conference, and had no
plans to do so in the future."
A tape of the Franklin hearings
testimony, from which the quote
arose, shows Dr. Campbell's
response to have been that he had
"not knowingly" issued such an

of the future, but did add that
invitations to speak were made on

So you want academic freedom
for these creeps? Well, 1 wonder
how much academic freedom I'd

Do you think for one minute I'd
get passed? Or do you think he'd
allow me to sit in those

he was expousing his crap!
You know damn well he'd
throw us out!
You poor slobs of students;
when the hell are you going to

More Hippies
Open letter to President Lyman,
On New Years Day I watched
the Stanford Band march in the
Tournament of Roses parade
before thousands of people, and
millions of TV viewers. To most
of the people, the Band represents
Stanford. Did you see the Band
that day?
I was so shocked I couldn't
believe what I saw, so when the
parade was rebroadcast over local
TV in the evening, I watched
again. Sure enough I had seen
what I thought I saw.
Several hippies in pseudo-band
uniforms.
Someone pulling a wagon filled
with soft drinks in the middle of
the band.
Very sloppy formation.
A band member with camera
taking pictures.
Is this what Stanford means to
you, Mr. Lyman? Are you proud
of Stanford? I'm not!
I watched the game on TV and
the band's half-time presentation.
Did you? Does Stanford really
stand "extreme left of center" as
presented by the Band? Does it
really turn out students who
represent the school by parodying
the values on which the school has
been built over the years? Is

sloppiness, poor taste, and
disregard for human values part of
the current curriculum at
Stanford?
The football team did not try to
be "the most unusual" in the
country, as the Stanford Observer
considers the Band. They played
to the best of their ability and
won. The Band played to the
worst of its abilty—and lost—lost
much respect for Stanford from
the millions of people who
watched its performance.
Mr. Lyman, I am personally
interested in how you, as leader of
the University, view these
incidents, and what you propose
to do in the future to prevent this
type of immature irresponsibility
of Arthur Barnes and his Band,
from hurting Stanford.

Litter Baskets
Editor, THE DAILY:
For a University as concerned
as Stanford is with ecology, there
is an amazing lack of litter
baskets. One can literally walk
across campus with a piece of
litter without spotting a single
receptacle for trash. I think the
University could afford to spend a
small portion of its recent 2.6
million dollar endowment on
litter baskets.

Columbae Addition
Editor, THE DAILY:
In view of the fact that Bruce
Franklin has accepted the offer of
the Columbae House Lounge to
teach his course, we wish to
report that The Daily recklessly
edited the original Columbae
House statement, and now ask
that it reprint the following
sections of that statement which
were deleted.
We oppose the decision of the
Faculty Advisory Board to
recommend the dismissal of Bruce
Franklin.
Columbae was initiated around
a study of non-violence, and some
have argued that we had best not
support anyone who advocates
armed struggle. We deplore
whatever personal tendencies
Bruce Franklin may have for
insensitivity and authoritarianism,
just as we deplore these same
tendencies in ourselves and in
Stanford administrators. Many of
us followed the hearings closely
and found the prosecution's case
unconvincing. We believe that
Bruce Franklin's activities were
protected by guarantees to free
speech, and cannot be directly
linked to physical violence
actually done to anyone last
Spring.
We believe that the Stanford
war researchers and Stanford
ROTC and the Stanford trustees
can be linked to massive,
barbarous destruction of people
and lands, beyond anything Bruce
Franklin has ever done.
Several years ago Bruce
Franklin was a committed
pacifist. At one time he laid his
body down before napalm trucks
in Redwood City—a classic
non-violent act. We have to
admire him for taking personal
risk upon himself to protest
injustice, and for denying himself
the full luxury of a class position
he recognized as inherently
unequal, that of a Stanford
professor.
In the hearings it came out that
Bruce Franklin had changed from
liberal to pacifist-activist to
militant revolutionary.
We know why he is outraged,
and we too recognize the need for
radical change in the university
and the country. Even though we
dislike Bruce Franklin's
intimations of terrorism and
hatred, we agree with Gandhi that
the use of violence to fight for
justice is better than apathy. We
understand the existence of
conflict and the necessity for
struggle.
We will not, as the University
has done, avoid facing ideas that
differ from arid challenge our
own. We would welcome Bruce
Franklin's teaching in our lounge
as a real learning experience. He
has much to share with us. Like
every decision affecting many
people in Columbae, this one was
reached by consensus, after much
discussion. Should Professor
Franklin have other plans for

using our lounge that will

Dr. Campbell was quoted as

A tape of the Franklin hearings

More Hippies
Open letter to President Lyman,
On New Years Day I watched
the Stanford Band march in the
Tournament of Roses parade
before thousands of people, and
millions of TV viewers. To most
of the people, the Band represents
Stanford. Did you see the Band
that day?
I was so shocked I couldn't
believe what I saw, so when the
parade was rebroadcast over local
TV in the evening, I watched
again. Sure enough I had seen
what I thought I saw.
Several hippies in pseudo-band
uniforms.
Someone pulling a wagon filled
with soft drinks in the middle of
the band.
Very sloppy formation.
A band member with camera
taking pictures.
Is this what Stanford means to
you, Mr. Lyman? Are you proud
of Stanford? I'm not!
I watched the game on TV and
the band's half-time presentation.
Did you? Does Stanford really
stand "extreme left of center" as
presented by the Band? Does it
really turn out students who
represent the school by parodying
the values on which the school has
been built over the years? Is

sloppiness, poor taste, and
disregard for human values part of
the current curriculum at
Stanford?
The football team did not try to
be "the most unusual" in the
country, as the Stanford Observer
considers the Band. They played
to the best of their ability and
won. The Band played to the
worst of its abilty—and lost—lost
much respect for Stanford from
the millions of people who
watched its performance.
Mr. Lyman, I am personally
interested in how you, as leader of
the University, view these
incidents, and what you propose
to do in the future to prevent this
type of immature irresponsibility
of Arthur Barnes and his Band,
from hurting Stanford.

Litter Baskets
Editor, THE DAILY:
For a University as concerned
as Stanford is with ecology, there
is an amazing lack of litter
baskets. One can literally walk
across campus with a piece of
litter without spotting a single
receptacle for trash. I think the
University could afford to spend a
small portion of its recent 2.6
million dollar endowment on
litter baskets.

Columbae Addition
Editor, THE DAILY:
In view of the fact that Bruce
Franklin has accepted the offer of
the Columbae House Lounge to
teach his course, we wish to
report that The Daily recklessly
edited the original Columbae
House statement, and now ask
that it reprint the following
sections of that statement which
were deleted.
We oppose the decision of the
Faculty Advisory Board to
recommend the dismissal of Bruce
Franklin.
Columbae was initiated around
a study of non-violence, and some
have argued that we had best not
support anyone who advocates
armed struggle. We deplore
whatever personal tendencies
Bruce Franklin may have for
insensitivity and authoritarianism,
just as we deplore these same
tendencies in ourselves and in
Stanford administrators. Many of
us followed the hearings closely
and found the prosecution's case
unconvincing. We believe that
Bruce Franklin's activities were
protected by guarantees to free
speech, and cannot be directly
linked to physical violence
actually done to anyone last
Spring.
We believe that the Stanford
war researchers and Stanford
ROTC and the Stanford trustees
can be linked to massive,
barbarous destruction of people
and lands, beyond anything Bruce
Franklin has ever done.
Several years ago Bruce
Franklin was a committed
pacifist. At one time he laid his
body down before napalm trucks
in Redwood City—a classic
non-violent act. We have to
admire him for taking personal
risk upon himself to protest
injustice, and for denying himself
the full luxury of a class position
he recognized as inherently
unequal, that of a Stanford
professor.
In the hearings it came out that
Bruce Franklin had changed from
liberal to pacifist-activist to
militant revolutionary.
We know why he is outraged,
and we too recognize the need for
radical change in the university
and the country. Even though we
dislike Bruce Franklin's
intimations of terrorism and
hatred, we agree with Gandhi that
the use of violence to fight for
justice is better than apathy. We
understand the existence of
conflict and the necessity for
struggle.
We will not, as the University
has done, avoid facing ideas that
differ from arid challenge our
own. We would welcome Bruce
Franklin's teaching in our lounge
as a real learning experience. He
has much to share with us. Like
every decision affecting many
people in Columbae, this one was
reached by consensus, after much
discussion. Should Professor
Franklin have other plans for

using our lounge that will
significantly affect the people
living here, he, like anyone else,
will have to submit them to the
consensus decision process.
We encourage every other
student residence on campus to
consider taking Columbae's action
for themselves (i.e. offering their
own lounge for Bruce Franklin to
teach in.).

Professorial Obligation
Editor, THE DAILY:
Although the Stanford
administration apparently did not
do so, I believe an argument could
be made that a Stanford professor
has a positive obligation to use
any influence he may have to
prevent actions that might result
in personal injury to students or
damage to university facilities.
In the rallies and Computation
Center events, the facts in dispute
have been whether Professor
Franklin incited violence or urged
persons to commit crimes against
the university. Obviously there are
differences of opinion on those
facts.
However, there seems no claim
or evidence that Professor
Franklin used his substantial
influence and his persuasive skills
to urge students to disperse, to
avoid potentially dangerous
confrontations, or to refrain from
destroying university facilities
when he had ample opportunity
to do so and clear indications that
a tense and explosive situation
prevailed.
It seems obvious that he did
not do so because he did not wish
to dampen the revolutionary
impulses of his keyed-up
audiences. As an individual
citizen, that was his privilege; as a
salaried member of the university
faculty, it was not. When he chose
to encourage, or to condone, or to
ignore the potentiality for
violence—whichever he did—he
abrogated his responsibility as a
member of the faculty and were
he intellectually honest, he would
have tendered his resignation at
that point.
It is a bizarre twist of logic to
argue that the magic of tenure
obliges the university to retain an
employee who will make no
effort, in a critical situation, Io
protect its students and facilities
from danger or destruction when
it is clearly within his power to do
so at no risk to his own person.

If I work for Dow Chemical
and disapprove of its activities, I
have every right to resign, with as
much lanfare as I can generate, in
order to focus attention on its
moral culpability, but I have no
right to expect it to continue to
pay my salary if I fail to report
sabotage to its equipment or
threats to the safety of its
personnel.
It is trite to say that freedom

More Hippies
Open letter to President Lyman,
On New Years Day I watched
the Stanford Band march in the
Tournament of Roses parade
before thousands of people, and
millions of TV viewers. To most
of the people, the Band represents
Stanford. Did you see the Band
that day?
I was so shocked I couldn't
believe what I saw, so when the
parade was rebroadcast over local
TV in the evening, I watched
again. Sure enough I had seen
what I thought I saw.
Several hippies in pseudo-band
uniforms.
Someone pulling a wagon filled
with soft drinks in the middle of
the band.
Very sloppy formation.
A band member with camera
taking pictures.
Is this what Stanford means to
you, Mr. Lyman? Are you proud
of Stanford? I'm not!
I watched the game on TV and
the band's half-time presentation.
Did you? Does Stanford really
stand "extreme left of center" as
presented by the Band? Does it
really turn out students who
represent the school by parodying
the values on which the school has
been built over the years? Is

sloppiness, poor taste, and
disregard for human values part of
the current curriculum at
Stanford?
The football team did not try to
be "the most unusual" in the
country, as the Stanford Observer
considers the Band. They played
to the best of their ability and
won. The Band played to the
worst of its abilty—and lost—lost
much respect for Stanford from
the millions of people who
watched its performance.
Mr. Lyman, I am personally
interested in how you, as leader of
the University, view these
incidents, and what you propose
to do in the future to prevent this
type of immature irresponsibility
of Arthur Barnes and his Band,
from hurting Stanford.

Litter Baskets
Editor, THE DAILY:
For a University as concerned
as Stanford is with ecology, there
is an amazing lack of litter
baskets. One can literally walk
across campus with a piece of
litter without spotting a single
receptacle for trash. I think the
University could afford to spend a
small portion of its recent 2.6
million dollar endowment on
litter baskets.

Columbae Addition
Editor, THE DAILY:
In view of the fact that Bruce
Franklin has accepted the offer of
the Columbae House Lounge to
teach his course, we wish to
report that The Daily recklessly
edited the original Columbae
House statement, and now ask
that it reprint the following
sections of that statement which
were deleted.
We oppose the decision of the
Faculty Advisory Board to
recommend the dismissal of Bruce
Franklin.
Columbae was initiated around
a study of non-violence, and some
have argued that we had best not
support anyone who advocates
armed struggle. We deplore
whatever personal tendencies
Bruce Franklin may have for
insensitivity and authoritarianism,
just as we deplore these same
tendencies in ourselves and in
Stanford administrators. Many of
us followed the hearings closely
and found the prosecution's case
unconvincing. We believe that
Bruce Franklin's activities were
protected by guarantees to free
speech, and cannot be directly
linked to physical violence
actually done to anyone last
Spring.
We believe that the Stanford
war researchers and Stanford
ROTC and the Stanford trustees
can be linked to massive,
barbarous destruction of people
and lands, beyond anything Bruce
Franklin has ever done.
Several years ago Bruce
Franklin was a committed
pacifist. At one time he laid his
body down before napalm trucks
in Redwood City—a classic
non-violent act. We have to
admire him for taking personal
risk upon himself to protest
injustice, and for denying himself
the full luxury of a class position
he recognized as inherently
unequal, that of a Stanford
professor.
In the hearings it came out that
Bruce Franklin had changed from
liberal to pacifist-activist to
militant revolutionary.
We know why he is outraged,
and we too recognize the need for
radical change in the university
and the country. Even though we
dislike Bruce Franklin's
intimations of terrorism and
hatred, we agree with Gandhi that
the use of violence to fight for
justice is better than apathy. We
understand the existence of
conflict and the necessity for
struggle.
We will not, as the University
has done, avoid facing ideas that
differ from arid challenge our
own. We would welcome Bruce
Franklin's teaching in our lounge
as a real learning experience. He
has much to share with us. Like
every decision affecting many
people in Columbae, this one was
reached by consensus, after much
discussion. Should Professor
Franklin have other plans for

using our lounge that will
significantly affect the people
living here, he, like anyone else,
will have to submit them to the
consensus decision process.
We encourage every other
student residence on campus to
consider taking Columbae's action
for themselves (i.e. offering their
own lounge for Bruce Franklin to
teach in.).

Professorial Obligation
Editor, THE DAILY:
Although the Stanford
administration apparently did not
do so, I believe an argument could
be made that a Stanford professor
has a positive obligation to use
any influence he may have to
prevent actions that might result
in personal injury to students or
damage to university facilities.
In the rallies and Computation
Center events, the facts in dispute
have been whether Professor
Franklin incited violence or urged
persons to commit crimes against
the university. Obviously there are
differences of opinion on those
facts.
However, there seems no claim
or evidence that Professor
Franklin used his substantial
influence and his persuasive skills
to urge students to disperse, to
avoid potentially dangerous
confrontations, or to refrain from
destroying university facilities
when he had ample opportunity
to do so and clear indications that
a tense and explosive situation
prevailed.
It seems obvious that he did
not do so because he did not wish
to dampen the revolutionary
impulses of his keyed-up
audiences. As an individual
citizen, that was his privilege; as a
salaried member of the university
faculty, it was not. When he chose
to encourage, or to condone, or to
ignore the potentiality for
violence—whichever he did—he
abrogated his responsibility as a
member of the faculty and were
he intellectually honest, he would
have tendered his resignation at
that point.
It is a bizarre twist of logic to
argue that the magic of tenure
obliges the university to retain an
employee who will make no
effort, in a critical situation, Io
protect its students and facilities
from danger or destruction when
it is clearly within his power to do
so at no risk to his own person.

If I work for Dow Chemical
and disapprove of its activities, I
have every right to resign, with as
much lanfare as I can generate, in
order to focus attention on its
moral culpability, but I have no
right to expect it to continue to
pay my salary if I fail to report
sabotage to its equipment or
threats to the safety of its
personnel.
It is trite to say that freedom
and responsibility are
handmaidens, but like most trite
expressions, it is true. Professor
Franklin seeks the one without
the other, a stance which deserves
a decisive rejection by the entire
Stanford community.

Dr. Campbell was quoted as

saying he "had never willingly

Hoover conference, and had no

A tape of the Franklin hearings
testimony, from which the quote
arose, shows Dr. Campbell's

Litter Baskets
Editor, THE DAILY:
For a University as concerned
as Stanford is with ecology, there
is an amazing lack of litter
baskets. One can literally walk
across campus with a piece of
litter without spotting a single
receptacle for trash. I think the
University could afford to spend a
small portion of its recent 2.6
million dollar endowment on
litter baskets.

Columbae Addition
Editor, THE DAILY:
In view of the fact that Bruce
Franklin has accepted the offer of
the Columbae House Lounge to
teach his course, we wish to
report that The Daily recklessly
edited the original Columbae
House statement, and now ask
that it reprint the following
sections of that statement which
were deleted.
We oppose the decision of the
Faculty Advisory Board to
recommend the dismissal of Bruce
Franklin.
Columbae was initiated around
a study of non-violence, and some
have argued that we had best not
support anyone who advocates
armed struggle. We deplore
whatever personal tendencies
Bruce Franklin may have for
insensitivity and authoritarianism,
just as we deplore these same
tendencies in ourselves and in
Stanford administrators. Many of
us followed the hearings closely
and found the prosecution's case
unconvincing. We believe that
Bruce Franklin's activities were
protected by guarantees to free
speech, and cannot be directly
linked to physical violence
actually done to anyone last
Spring.
We believe that the Stanford
war researchers and Stanford
ROTC and the Stanford trustees
can be linked to massive,
barbarous destruction of people
and lands, beyond anything Bruce
Franklin has ever done.
Several years ago Bruce
Franklin was a committed
pacifist. At one time he laid his
body down before napalm trucks
in Redwood City—a classic
non-violent act. We have to
admire him for taking personal
risk upon himself to protest
injustice, and for denying himself
the full luxury of a class position
he recognized as inherently
unequal, that of a Stanford
professor.
In the hearings it came out that
Bruce Franklin had changed from
liberal to pacifist-activist to
militant revolutionary.
We know why he is outraged,
and we too recognize the need for
radical change in the university
and the country. Even though we
dislike Bruce Franklin's
intimations of terrorism and
hatred, we agree with Gandhi that
the use of violence to fight for
justice is better than apathy. We
understand the existence of
conflict and the necessity for
struggle.
We will not, as the University
has done, avoid facing ideas that
differ from arid challenge our
own. We would welcome Bruce
Franklin's teaching in our lounge
as a real learning experience. He
has much to share with us. Like
every decision affecting many
people in Columbae, this one was
reached by consensus, after much
discussion. Should Professor
Franklin have other plans for

using our lounge that will
significantly affect the people
living here, he, like anyone else,
will have to submit them to the
consensus decision process.
We encourage every other
student residence on campus to
consider taking Columbae's action
for themselves (i.e. offering their
own lounge for Bruce Franklin to
teach in.).

Professorial Obligation
Editor, THE DAILY:
Although the Stanford
administration apparently did not
do so, I believe an argument could
be made that a Stanford professor
has a positive obligation to use
any influence he may have to
prevent actions that might result
in personal injury to students or
damage to university facilities.
In the rallies and Computation
Center events, the facts in dispute
have been whether Professor
Franklin incited violence or urged
persons to commit crimes against
the university. Obviously there are
differences of opinion on those
facts.
However, there seems no claim
or evidence that Professor
Franklin used his substantial
influence and his persuasive skills
to urge students to disperse, to
avoid potentially dangerous
confrontations, or to refrain from
destroying university facilities
when he had ample opportunity
to do so and clear indications that
a tense and explosive situation
prevailed.
It seems obvious that he did
not do so because he did not wish
to dampen the revolutionary
impulses of his keyed-up
audiences. As an individual
citizen, that was his privilege; as a
salaried member of the university
faculty, it was not. When he chose
to encourage, or to condone, or to
ignore the potentiality for
violence—whichever he did—he
abrogated his responsibility as a
member of the faculty and were
he intellectually honest, he would
have tendered his resignation at
that point.
It is a bizarre twist of logic to
argue that the magic of tenure
obliges the university to retain an
employee who will make no
effort, in a critical situation, Io
protect its students and facilities
from danger or destruction when
it is clearly within his power to do
so at no risk to his own person.

If I work for Dow Chemical
and disapprove of its activities, I
have every right to resign, with as
much lanfare as I can generate, in
order to focus attention on its
moral culpability, but I have no
right to expect it to continue to
pay my salary if I fail to report
sabotage to its equipment or
threats to the safety of its
personnel.
It is trite to say that freedom
and responsibility are
handmaidens, but like most trite
expressions, it is true. Professor
Franklin seeks the one without
the other, a stance which deserves
a decisive rejection by the entire
Stanford community.

Correction
Editor, THE DAILY:
I write to correct a substantial
error in a quotation attributed to
Glenn Campbell in the Jan. 11
fourth and final installment of the
series on the Hoover Institution.
Dr. Campbell was quoted as

saying he "had never willingly
invited a member of the
Communist Party to speak at a
Hoover conference, and had no
plans to do so in the future."
A tape of the Franklin hearings
testimony, from which the quote
arose, shows Dr. Campbell's
response to have been that he had
"not knowingly" issued such an
invitation. He made no mention
of the future, but did add that
invitations to speak were made on
the basis of scholarly
qualification, not political
affiliation.

Jerks Like You
(Editor's note: Last week. Daily
editor-in-chief Fred Mann was
interviewed on the Marv Gray
radio talk show in Los Angeles
about the newspaper's position on
the Bruce Franklin case. Someone
was listening)
Editor, THE DAILY:
We heard you today on the

Marv Gray show on KABC. You
know, the more we hear jerks like
you, the more we realize that
professors like that weirdo
Stanley (presumably Franklin]
have idiots like yourself so
brainwashed it's impossible for
you to think straight.
So you want academic freedom
for these creeps? Well, 1 wonder
how much academic freedom I'd
have if 1 was sitting in those same
classrooms protesting his teaching.
Do you think for one minute I'd
get passed? Or do you think he'd
allow me to sit in those
classrooms harassing him while
he was expousing his crap!
You know damn well he'd
throw us out!
You poor slobs of students;
when the hell are you going to
start thinking things out for
yourself? You've never learned to
think. Some call you the best
educated generation. I call you a
generation of slobs, followers of
any maladjusted misfit.
You only mouth your privelges
(sic) and none of you truly know
what a great privelge (sic) it is to

live in these United States.
I dare you to print this in your
paper! Come on big mouth—give
people like me equal opportunity.

More Hippies
Open letter to President Lyman,
On New Years Day I watched
the Stanford Band march in the
Tournament of Roses parade
before thousands of people, and
millions of TV viewers. To most
of the people, the Band represents
Stanford. Did you see the Band
that day?
I was so shocked I couldn't
believe what I saw, so when the
parade was rebroadcast over local
TV in the evening, I watched
again. Sure enough I had seen
what I thought I saw.
Several hippies in pseudo-band
uniforms.
Someone pulling a wagon filled
with soft drinks in the middle of
the band.
Very sloppy formation.
A band member with camera
taking pictures.
Is this what Stanford means to
you, Mr. Lyman? Are you proud
of Stanford? I'm not!
I watched the game on TV and
the band's half-time presentation.
Did you? Does Stanford really
stand "extreme left of center" as
presented by the Band? Does it
really turn out students who
represent the school by parodying
the values on which the school has
been built over the years? Is

sloppiness, poor taste, and
disregard for human values part of
the current curriculum at
Stanford?
The football team did not try to
be "the most unusual" in the
country, as the Stanford Observer
considers the Band. They played
to the best of their ability and
won. The Band played to the
worst of its abilty—and lost—lost
much respect for Stanford from
the millions of people who
watched its performance.
Mr. Lyman, I am personally
interested in how you, as leader of
the University, view these
incidents, and what you propose
to do in the future to prevent this
type of immature irresponsibility
of Arthur Barnes and his Band,
from hurting Stanford.
