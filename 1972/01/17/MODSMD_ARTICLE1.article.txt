# Trustees Reject Request To Delay Franklin Move
## 
### ROBERT VINING 
The Board of Trustees has refused a
request from the Stanford chapter of
the American Association of
University Professors (AAUP) to delay
action in the Franklin case.
The local AAUP chapter had asked
the Trustees to consult with leading
members and representatives of the
academic community throughout the
nation before acting on an Advisory
Board report recommending the firing
of revolutionary Associate English
Professor H. Bruce Franklin.
Last Wednesday the Executive
Committee of Stanford AAUP chapter

wrote Trustee Chairman Robert Minge
Brown: "Although President Lyman
has expressed confidence that his
recommendation of severance
'provides no legitimate basis for
assaults on the essential rights of
faculty anywhere,'. . . (t)he question
here is not that of legitimate grounds,
but of likely consequences."
The Executive Committee asked the
Trustees to contact faculty senates and
administrations at other universities,
plus groups like the national AAUP, to
assess effects of the Franklin decision
on academic freedom.
The letter from the Executive

Committee warned that "the Trustees
should not hasten to a judgment on
January 22nd, and .. . fail to avail
themselves of this opportunity."
Stanford President Richard Lyman
has advised the Trustees to accept the
Majority Report of the Advisory
Board, which recommended firing
Franklin on grounds that he incited
violence in last February's antiwar
disruptions. Franklin is a tenured
faculty member.
Trustees President Brown wrote
Stanford AAUP President John
Goheen, Prof, of Philosophy, that "it
would be neither possible nor proper
for the Board to conduct the sort of
inquiry which you suggest."
Brown stated: "The Statement of
Policy on Appointment and
Tenure .. . provides for a hearing
before the Advisory Board. That
hearing has been held. The Board of
Trustees does not believe it is in a
position to reweigh the evidence or to
hear any new evidence . .."
Last Saturday President Lyman also
wrote Goheen. Lyman questioned
what academic spokesmen from
outside Stanford could contribute
"other than sheer speculation."
Lyman concluded by questioning
whether Goheen would be "happy"
with asking the Trustees, "most of
them not academic persons, to
undertake so speculative and delicate a
task of measuring academic conditions
and standards across the country ..."
Contacted Sunday by the Daily,
Goheen said Franklin could appeal the
final Trustees' decision to the national
AAUP. The organization would
investigate the case and, if it found in
Franklin's behalf, would attempt tc
mediate with the university. If these
efforts failed, the entire organization
could vote on censuring Stanford.

wrote Goheen. Lyman questioned
what academic spokesmen from
outside Stanford could contribute
"other than sheer speculation."
Lyman concluded by questioning
whether Goheen would be "happy"
with asking the Trustees, "most of
them not academic persons, to
undertake so speculative and delicate a
task of measuring academic conditions
and standards across the country ..."
Contacted Sunday by the Daily,
Goheen said Franklin could appeal the
final Trustees' decision to the national
AAUP. The organization would
investigate the case and, if it found in
Franklin's behalf, would attempt tc
mediate with the university. If these
efforts failed, the entire organization
could vote on censuring Stanford.
The Board of Trustees has refused a
request from the Stanford chapter of
the American Association of
University Professors (AAUP) to delay
action in the Franklin case.
The local AAUP chapter had asked
the Trustees to consult with leading
members and representatives of the
academic community throughout the
nation before acting on an Advisory
Board report recommending the firing
of revolutionary Associate English
Professor H. Bruce Franklin.
Last Wednesday the Executive
Committee of Stanford AAUP chapter

wrote Trustee Chairman Robert Minge
Brown: "Although President Lyman
has expressed confidence that his
recommendation of severance
'provides no legitimate basis for
assaults on the essential rights of
faculty anywhere,'. . . (t)he question
here is not that of legitimate grounds,
but of likely consequences."
The Executive Committee asked the
Trustees to contact faculty senates and
administrations at other universities,
plus groups like the national AAUP, to
assess effects of the Franklin decision
on academic freedom.
The letter from the Executive

Committee warned that "the Trustees
should not hasten to a judgment on
January 22nd, and .. . fail to avail
themselves of this opportunity."
Stanford President Richard Lyman
has advised the Trustees to accept the
Majority Report of the Advisory
Board, which recommended firing
Franklin on grounds that he incited
violence in last February's antiwar
disruptions. Franklin is a tenured
faculty member.
Trustees President Brown wrote
Stanford AAUP President John
Goheen, Prof, of Philosophy, that "it
would be neither possible nor proper
for the Board to conduct the sort of
inquiry which you suggest."
Brown stated: "The Statement of
Policy on Appointment and
Tenure .. . provides for a hearing
before the Advisory Board. That
hearing has been held. The Board of
Trustees does not believe it is in a
position to reweigh the evidence or to
hear any new evidence . .."
Last Saturday President Lyman also
wrote Goheen. Lyman questioned
what academic spokesmen from
outside Stanford could contribute
"other than sheer speculation."
Lyman concluded by questioning
whether Goheen would be "happy"
with asking the Trustees, "most of
them not academic persons, to

task of measuring academic conditions
and standards across the country ..."
