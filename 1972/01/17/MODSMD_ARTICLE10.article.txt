A.A.U.P. Letter
Mr. Robert Minge Brown:
The Board of Trustees has
before it President Lyman's
recommendation that Professor
Franklin be dismissed from the
Stanford Faculty forthwith, a
recommendation that quickly
accepts the decision of the
majority of the Advisory Board.
On behalf of the Executive Board
of the Stanford chapter of the
A.A.U.P., we urge the Trustees
not to act precipitously in this
matter.
In deliberating upon so serious
a question as the dismissal of a
member of the tenured faculty, it is
vital that you consider not only
the Report of the Advisory Board
and the recommendations of the
President, but accord time and
attention to such views as
representatives of the faculty and
other members of the University
may at this time wish to place
before you.
Members of the Advisory Board
have addressed the issue of the
effects upon academic freedom,
on the Stanford campus and
elsewhere, that are likely to flow
from the actions of this University
in the matter of H. Bruce
Franklin.
Although President Lyman has
expressed confidence that his
recommendation of severance
"provides no legitimate basis for
assaults on the essential rights of
faculty anywhere," we would

respectfully point out that this
assurance is beside the point. The
question here is not that of
legitimate grounds, but of likely
consequences.
And on this the Trustees are
well situated (as others hitherto
involved have not been) to take
counsel with leading members of
the wider academic community
across the nation, and with
spokesmen for Faculty Senates
and other representative
organizations like the National
A.A.U.P., as well as University
administrators, as to the wisdom
of the course of action that
President Lyman now proposes to
follow. In our view the Trustees
should not hasten to a judgment
on January 22nd, and in so doing
fail to avail themselves of this
opportunity.
John D. Goheen, President
Stanford Chapter, A.A.U.P.
Board Response
Professor John D. Goheen:
Your letter of January 12,
1972 relating to the matter of
Professor H. Bruce Franklin was
received by me today.
I can assure you that the Board
of Trustees has very much in mind
and is devoted to maintaining
academic freedom at Stanford.
Both the Advisory Board's
decision and the President's
decision which are before the
Board of Trustees, deal with that
very matter.
The Statement of Policy on
Appointment and Tenure at
Stanford University provides for a
hearing before the Advisory
Board. That hearing has been
held. The Board of Trustees does
not believe it is in a position to
reweigh the evidence or to hear
any new evidence, and it would be
neither possible nor proper for the
Board to conduct the sort of
inquiry which you suggest.
Accordingly, on behalf of the
Board of Trustees I must decline
the request of the Executive
Board of the Stanford Chapter of
the American Association of
University Professors that further
consideration of the Franklin case
be deferred in order that the
Board of Trustees might receive
expressions of viewpoints from
the various sources mentioned in
your letter.
Robert Minge Brown
President, Stanford
Board of Trustees
Lyman's Response
Professor John D. Goheen:
I've received a copy of the
A.A.U.P. Executive Committee's
letter of January 12, 1972 to Mr.
Robert Minge Brown, President of
the Board of Trustees.
Because of the role played by
the University President in the
earlier stages of a disciplinary

proceeding under Stanford's
policy, I shall not be participating
in the deliberations of the Board
of Trustees on Professor
Franklin's case, even though since
the recent Board reorganization
the President is, of course, a
member of the Board ex officio.
The issue which you and your
colleagues have addressed to the
Board is, however, a critical one as
we've all recognized; since I've
addressed myself to it in accepting
the Advisory Board's decision, I
hope that you will not mind if I
take this opportunity to comment
on it a bit further, and with direct
reference to the A.A.U.P.
Executive Committee's
suggestions for Trustee action.
You urge that the Trustees
undertake consultation with
various people and agencies
outside Stanford before deciding
whether to concur in my decision
accepting the decision of the
Advisory Board. You suggest that
the Trustees counsel with
spokesmen for faculty senates
elsewhere, representative
organizations, and administrators
of other universities in an effort
to predict the effects of this
decision elsewhere. I question
both the practicality and the
desirability in principle of such an
undertaking.
As a practical matter, how
would you have the Board
proceed? Who would ensure that
all the most relevant sources were
contacted? How would the Board
proceed so that all its members
could fully inform themselves of
the views of these relevant
sources? Would there not be a
need, given the nature of the
proceedings thus far, to provide
for some sort of cross-examina
tion and the introduction of
rebuttal evidence? To what extent
ought Stanford to take into
account the particular
circumstances at the moment of
other campuses?
All other campuses? If not, on
what basis would the selection be
made? Indeed, even if spokesmen
could be found who would devote
their time to a serious, balanced
and informed consideration of the
matter, what, in the last analysis,
could they contribute other than
sheer speculation?
More fundamentally, I question
the very basis in principle on
which your request appears to
rest. You are really arguing, it
seems to me, that the Trustees
should now set aside the question
of the adequacy or inadequacy,
fairness or unfairness, Tightness or
wrongness of the proceedings and
their outcome here at Stanford,
and put in place of all that a
question of expediency, the
answer to which would be sought
by a process of guesswork
prediction as to indirect
consequences in other
institutions.

Two signers of the Executive
Committee's letter are historians;
does either feel confident of the
kind of prediction-based-on
sampling that seems to be implied
by your request? And how would
we justify our deliberately seeking
a resolution to Stanford's
question by reference to a host of
other places and contexts?
Suppose in the future an Advisory
Board decision the reverse of this
one; would you similarly wish to
have opinions across the country
explored as to the effect upon
other institutions of allowing an
acquittal to stand?
I fully share your concern and
that of your colleagues for the
longrange and broadscale effect of
what we do here and now at
Stanford. But I believe that in
that context the most useful thing
that we can do is to follow our
own policies, as they were
thoughtfully (albeit of course not
perfectly) framed before this
particular case ever arose, and set
a decent example of seeking a
sound judgment based on these
policies.
The heart of the procedure is
the most careful consideration of
all relevant issues by a group of
senior faculty elected by their
colleagues. Their distinction as
individuals, the high regard in
which they are held by the faculty
at large, their long experience at
Stanford, their extensive
knowledge of the academic world,
and the time and thought which
they have devoted to the issues
give to their conclusions a weight
that cannot possibly be matched
by any survey of miscellaneous
opinions from elsewhere, opinions
which would unavoidably lack the
basis I've just described as
underlying the Advisory Board's
work.
Finally, I question whether you
will, on reconsideration, be
entirely happy with the thought
of asking the Board of Trustees,
most of them not acadcmic
persons, to undertake so
speculative and delicate a task of
measuring academic conditions
and standards across the country
as would be necessitated by your
proposed action.
Judgments of the kind involved
in this case are unpleasant and one
would gladly escape the necessity
of making them. But I cannot
believe that the cause of academic
freedom would be served by
seeking at this stage to turn the
matter into a vain search for
consensus among the relatively
less informed and less concerned,
in place of the thoughtful and
sober judgment of our own
faculty's representatives on the
Advisory Board.

that context the most useful thing
that we can do is to follow our
own policies, as they were
thoughtfully (albeit of course not
perfectly) framed before this
particular case ever arose, and set
a decent example of seeking a
sound judgment based on these
policies.
The heart of the procedure is
the most careful consideration of
all relevant issues by a group of
senior faculty elected by their
colleagues. Their distinction as
individuals, the high regard in
which they are held by the faculty
at large, their long experience at
Stanford, their extensive
knowledge of the academic world,
and the time and thought which
they have devoted to the issues
give to their conclusions a weight
that cannot possibly be matched
by any survey of miscellaneous
opinions from elsewhere, opinions
which would unavoidably lack the
basis I've just described as
underlying the Advisory Board's
work.
Finally, I question whether you
will, on reconsideration, be
entirely happy with the thought
of asking the Board of Trustees,
most of them not acadcmic
persons, to undertake so
speculative and delicate a task of
measuring academic conditions
and standards across the country
as would be necessitated by your
proposed action.
Judgments of the kind involved
in this case are unpleasant and one
would gladly escape the necessity
of making them. But I cannot
believe that the cause of academic
freedom would be served by
seeking at this stage to turn the
matter into a vain search for
consensus among the relatively
less informed and less concerned,
in place of the thoughtful and
sober judgment of our own
faculty's representatives on the
Advisory Board.
Richard W. Lyman
President
A.A.U.P. Letter
Mr. Robert Minge Brown:
The Board of Trustees has
before it President Lyman's
recommendation that Professor
Franklin be dismissed from the
Stanford Faculty forthwith, a
recommendation that quickly
accepts the decision of the
majority of the Advisory Board.
On behalf of the Executive Board
of the Stanford chapter of the
A.A.U.P., we urge the Trustees
not to act precipitously in this
matter.
In deliberating upon so serious
a question as the dismissal of a
member of the tenured faculty, it is
vital that you consider not only
the Report of the Advisory Board
and the recommendations of the
President, but accord time and
attention to such views as
representatives of the faculty and
other members of the University
may at this time wish to place
before you.
Members of the Advisory Board
have addressed the issue of the
effects upon academic freedom,
on the Stanford campus and
elsewhere, that are likely to flow
from the actions of this University
in the matter of H. Bruce
Franklin.
Although President Lyman has
expressed confidence that his
recommendation of severance
"provides no legitimate basis for
assaults on the essential rights of
faculty anywhere," we would

respectfully point out that this
assurance is beside the point. The
question here is not that of
legitimate grounds, but of likely
consequences.
And on this the Trustees are
well situated (as others hitherto
involved have not been) to take
counsel with leading members of
the wider academic community
across the nation, and with
spokesmen for Faculty Senates
and other representative
organizations like the National
A.A.U.P., as well as University
administrators, as to the wisdom
of the course of action that
President Lyman now proposes to
follow. In our view the Trustees
should not hasten to a judgment
on January 22nd, and in so doing
fail to avail themselves of this
opportunity.

Board Response
Professor John D. Goheen:
Your letter of January 12,
1972 relating to the matter of
Professor H. Bruce Franklin was
received by me today.
I can assure you that the Board
of Trustees has very much in mind
and is devoted to maintaining
academic freedom at Stanford.
Both the Advisory Board's
decision and the President's
decision which are before the
Board of Trustees, deal with that
very matter.
The Statement of Policy on
Appointment and Tenure at
Stanford University provides for a
hearing before the Advisory
Board. That hearing has been
held. The Board of Trustees does
not believe it is in a position to
reweigh the evidence or to hear
any new evidence, and it would be
neither possible nor proper for the
Board to conduct the sort of
inquiry which you suggest.
Accordingly, on behalf of the
Board of Trustees I must decline
the request of the Executive
Board of the Stanford Chapter of
the American Association of
University Professors that further
consideration of the Franklin case
be deferred in order that the
Board of Trustees might receive
expressions of viewpoints from
the various sources mentioned in
your letter.
Robert Minge Brown
President, Stanford
Board of Trustees
Lyman's Response
Professor John D. Goheen:
I've received a copy of the
A.A.U.P. Executive Committee's
letter of January 12, 1972 to Mr.
Robert Minge Brown, President of
the Board of Trustees.
Because of the role played by
the University President in the
earlier stages of a disciplinary

proceeding under Stanford's
policy, I shall not be participating
in the deliberations of the Board
of Trustees on Professor
Franklin's case, even though since
the recent Board reorganization
the President is, of course, a
member of the Board ex officio.
The issue which you and your
colleagues have addressed to the
Board is, however, a critical one as
we've all recognized; since I've
addressed myself to it in accepting
the Advisory Board's decision, I
hope that you will not mind if I
take this opportunity to comment
on it a bit further, and with direct
reference to the A.A.U.P.
Executive Committee's
suggestions for Trustee action.
You urge that the Trustees
undertake consultation with
various people and agencies
outside Stanford before deciding
whether to concur in my decision
accepting the decision of the
Advisory Board. You suggest that
the Trustees counsel with
spokesmen for faculty senates
elsewhere, representative
organizations, and administrators
of other universities in an effort
to predict the effects of this
decision elsewhere. I question
both the practicality and the
desirability in principle of such an
undertaking.
As a practical matter, how
would you have the Board
proceed? Who would ensure that
all the most relevant sources were
contacted? How would the Board
proceed so that all its members
could fully inform themselves of
the views of these relevant
sources? Would there not be a
need, given the nature of the
proceedings thus far, to provide
for some sort of cross-examina
tion and the introduction of
rebuttal evidence? To what extent
ought Stanford to take into
account the particular
circumstances at the moment of
other campuses?
All other campuses? If not, on
what basis would the selection be
made? Indeed, even if spokesmen
could be found who would devote
their time to a serious, balanced
and informed consideration of the
matter, what, in the last analysis,
could they contribute other than
sheer speculation?
More fundamentally, I question
the very basis in principle on
which your request appears to
rest. You are really arguing, it
seems to me, that the Trustees
should now set aside the question
of the adequacy or inadequacy,
fairness or unfairness, Tightness or
wrongness of the proceedings and
their outcome here at Stanford,
and put in place of all that a
question of expediency, the
answer to which would be sought
by a process of guesswork
prediction as to indirect
consequences in other
institutions.

Two signers of the Executive
Committee's letter are historians;
does either feel confident of the
kind of prediction-based-on
sampling that seems to be implied
by your request? And how would
we justify our deliberately seeking
a resolution to Stanford's
question by reference to a host of
other places and contexts?
Suppose in the future an Advisory
Board decision the reverse of this
one; would you similarly wish to
have opinions across the country
explored as to the effect upon
other institutions of allowing an
acquittal to stand?
I fully share your concern and
that of your colleagues for the
longrange and broadscale effect of
what we do here and now at
Stanford. But I believe that in
that context the most useful thing
that we can do is to follow our
own policies, as they were
thoughtfully (albeit of course not
perfectly) framed before this
particular case ever arose, and set
a decent example of seeking a
sound judgment based on these

ought Stanford to take into
account the particular
circumstances at the moment of
other campuses?
All other campuses? If not, on
what basis would the selection be
made? Indeed, even if spokesmen
could be found who would devote
their time to a serious, balanced
and informed consideration of the
matter, what, in the last analysis,
could they contribute other than
sheer speculation?
More fundamentally, I question
the very basis in principle on
which your request appears to
rest. You are really arguing, it
seems to me, that the Trustees
should now set aside the question
of the adequacy or inadequacy,
fairness or unfairness, Tightness or
wrongness of the proceedings and
their outcome here at Stanford,
and put in place of all that a
question of expediency, the
answer to which would be sought
by a process of guesswork
prediction as to indirect
consequences in other
institutions.

Two signers of the Executive
Committee's letter are historians;
does either feel confident of the
kind of prediction-based-on
sampling that seems to be implied
by your request? And how would
we justify our deliberately seeking
a resolution to Stanford's
question by reference to a host of
other places and contexts?
Suppose in the future an Advisory
Board decision the reverse of this
one; would you similarly wish to
have opinions across the country
explored as to the effect upon
other institutions of allowing an
acquittal to stand?
I fully share your concern and
that of your colleagues for the
longrange and broadscale effect of
what we do here and now at
Stanford. But I believe that in
that context the most useful thing
that we can do is to follow our
own policies, as they were
thoughtfully (albeit of course not
perfectly) framed before this
particular case ever arose, and set
a decent example of seeking a
sound judgment based on these
policies.
The heart of the procedure is
the most careful consideration of
all relevant issues by a group of
senior faculty elected by their
colleagues. Their distinction as
individuals, the high regard in
which they are held by the faculty
at large, their long experience at
Stanford, their extensive
knowledge of the academic world,
and the time and thought which
they have devoted to the issues
give to their conclusions a weight
that cannot possibly be matched
by any survey of miscellaneous
opinions from elsewhere, opinions
which would unavoidably lack the
basis I've just described as
underlying the Advisory Board's
work.
Finally, I question whether you
will, on reconsideration, be
entirely happy with the thought
of asking the Board of Trustees,
most of them not acadcmic
persons, to undertake so
speculative and delicate a task of
measuring academic conditions
and standards across the country
as would be necessitated by your
proposed action.
Judgments of the kind involved
in this case are unpleasant and one
would gladly escape the necessity
of making them. But I cannot
believe that the cause of academic
freedom would be served by
seeking at this stage to turn the
matter into a vain search for
consensus among the relatively
less informed and less concerned,
in place of the thoughtful and
sober judgment of our own
faculty's representatives on the
Advisory Board.
Richard W. Lyman
President
A.A.U.P. Letter
Mr. Robert Minge Brown:
The Board of Trustees has
before it President Lyman's
recommendation that Professor
Franklin be dismissed from the
Stanford Faculty forthwith, a
recommendation that quickly
accepts the decision of the
majority of the Advisory Board.
On behalf of the Executive Board
of the Stanford chapter of the
A.A.U.P., we urge the Trustees
not to act precipitously in this
matter.
In deliberating upon so serious
a question as the dismissal of a
member of the tenured faculty, it is
vital that you consider not only
the Report of the Advisory Board
and the recommendations of the
President, but accord time and
attention to such views as
representatives of the faculty and
other members of the University
may at this time wish to place
before you.
Members of the Advisory Board
have addressed the issue of the
effects upon academic freedom,
on the Stanford campus and
elsewhere, that are likely to flow
from the actions of this University
in the matter of H. Bruce
Franklin.
Although President Lyman has
expressed confidence that his
recommendation of severance
"provides no legitimate basis for
assaults on the essential rights of
faculty anywhere," we would

respectfully point out that this
assurance is beside the point. The
question here is not that of
legitimate grounds, but of likely
consequences.
And on this the Trustees are
well situated (as others hitherto
involved have not been) to take
counsel with leading members of
the wider academic community
across the nation, and with
spokesmen for Faculty Senates
and other representative
organizations like the National
A.A.U.P., as well as University
administrators, as to the wisdom
of the course of action that
President Lyman now proposes to
follow. In our view the Trustees
should not hasten to a judgment
on January 22nd, and in so doing
fail to avail themselves of this
opportunity.

Board Response
Professor John D. Goheen:
Your letter of January 12,
1972 relating to the matter of
Professor H. Bruce Franklin was
received by me today.
I can assure you that the Board
of Trustees has very much in mind
and is devoted to maintaining
academic freedom at Stanford.
Both the Advisory Board's
decision and the President's
decision which are before the
Board of Trustees, deal with that
very matter.
The Statement of Policy on
Appointment and Tenure at
Stanford University provides for a
hearing before the Advisory
Board. That hearing has been
held. The Board of Trustees does
not believe it is in a position to
reweigh the evidence or to hear
any new evidence, and it would be
neither possible nor proper for the
Board to conduct the sort of
inquiry which you suggest.
Accordingly, on behalf of the
Board of Trustees I must decline
the request of the Executive
Board of the Stanford Chapter of
the American Association of
University Professors that further
consideration of the Franklin case
be deferred in order that the
Board of Trustees might receive
expressions of viewpoints from
the various sources mentioned in
your letter.
Robert Minge Brown
President, Stanford
Board of Trustees
Lyman's Response
Professor John D. Goheen:
I've received a copy of the
A.A.U.P. Executive Committee's
letter of January 12, 1972 to Mr.
Robert Minge Brown, President of
the Board of Trustees.
Because of the role played by
the University President in the
earlier stages of a disciplinary

proceeding under Stanford's
policy, I shall not be participating
in the deliberations of the Board
of Trustees on Professor
Franklin's case, even though since
the recent Board reorganization
the President is, of course, a
member of the Board ex officio.
The issue which you and your
colleagues have addressed to the
Board is, however, a critical one as
we've all recognized; since I've
addressed myself to it in accepting
the Advisory Board's decision, I
hope that you will not mind if I
take this opportunity to comment
on it a bit further, and with direct
reference to the A.A.U.P.
Executive Committee's
suggestions for Trustee action.
You urge that the Trustees
undertake consultation with
various people and agencies
outside Stanford before deciding
whether to concur in my decision
accepting the decision of the
Advisory Board. You suggest that
the Trustees counsel with
spokesmen for faculty senates
elsewhere, representative
organizations, and administrators
of other universities in an effort
to predict the effects of this
decision elsewhere. I question
both the practicality and the
desirability in principle of such an
undertaking.
As a practical matter, how
would you have the Board
proceed? Who would ensure that
all the most relevant sources were
contacted? How would the Board
proceed so that all its members
could fully inform themselves of
the views of these relevant
sources? Would there not be a
need, given the nature of the
proceedings thus far, to provide
for some sort of cross-examina
tion and the introduction of
rebuttal evidence? To what extent
ought Stanford to take into
account the particular
circumstances at the moment of
other campuses?
All other campuses? If not, on
what basis would the selection be
made? Indeed, even if spokesmen
could be found who would devote
their time to a serious, balanced
and informed consideration of the
matter, what, in the last analysis,
could they contribute other than
sheer speculation?

Because of the role played by
the University President in the
earlier stages of a disciplinary

proceeding under Stanford's
policy, I shall not be participating
in the deliberations of the Board
of Trustees on Professor
Franklin's case, even though since
the recent Board reorganization
the President is, of course, a
member of the Board ex officio.
The issue which you and your
colleagues have addressed to the
Board is, however, a critical one as
we've all recognized; since I've
addressed myself to it in accepting
the Advisory Board's decision, I
hope that you will not mind if I
take this opportunity to comment
on it a bit further, and with direct
reference to the A.A.U.P.
Executive Committee's
suggestions for Trustee action.
You urge that the Trustees
undertake consultation with
various people and agencies
outside Stanford before deciding
whether to concur in my decision
accepting the decision of the
Advisory Board. You suggest that
the Trustees counsel with
spokesmen for faculty senates
elsewhere, representative
organizations, and administrators
of other universities in an effort
to predict the effects of this
decision elsewhere. I question
both the practicality and the
desirability in principle of such an
undertaking.
As a practical matter, how
would you have the Board
proceed? Who would ensure that
all the most relevant sources were
contacted? How would the Board
proceed so that all its members
could fully inform themselves of
the views of these relevant
sources? Would there not be a
need, given the nature of the
proceedings thus far, to provide
for some sort of cross-examina
tion and the introduction of
rebuttal evidence? To what extent
ought Stanford to take into
account the particular
circumstances at the moment of
other campuses?
All other campuses? If not, on
what basis would the selection be
made? Indeed, even if spokesmen
could be found who would devote
their time to a serious, balanced
and informed consideration of the
matter, what, in the last analysis,
could they contribute other than
sheer speculation?
More fundamentally, I question
the very basis in principle on
which your request appears to
rest. You are really arguing, it
seems to me, that the Trustees
should now set aside the question
of the adequacy or inadequacy,
fairness or unfairness, Tightness or
wrongness of the proceedings and
their outcome here at Stanford,
and put in place of all that a
question of expediency, the
answer to which would be sought
by a process of guesswork
prediction as to indirect
consequences in other
institutions.

Two signers of the Executive
Committee's letter are historians;
does either feel confident of the
kind of prediction-based-on
sampling that seems to be implied
by your request? And how would
we justify our deliberately seeking
a resolution to Stanford's
question by reference to a host of
other places and contexts?
Suppose in the future an Advisory
Board decision the reverse of this
one; would you similarly wish to
have opinions across the country
explored as to the effect upon
other institutions of allowing an
acquittal to stand?
I fully share your concern and
that of your colleagues for the
longrange and broadscale effect of
what we do here and now at
Stanford. But I believe that in
that context the most useful thing
that we can do is to follow our
own policies, as they were
thoughtfully (albeit of course not
perfectly) framed before this
particular case ever arose, and set
a decent example of seeking a
sound judgment based on these
policies.
The heart of the procedure is
the most careful consideration of
all relevant issues by a group of
senior faculty elected by their
colleagues. Their distinction as
individuals, the high regard in
which they are held by the faculty
at large, their long experience at
Stanford, their extensive
knowledge of the academic world,
and the time and thought which
they have devoted to the issues
give to their conclusions a weight
that cannot possibly be matched
by any survey of miscellaneous
opinions from elsewhere, opinions
which would unavoidably lack the
basis I've just described as
underlying the Advisory Board's
work.
Finally, I question whether you
will, on reconsideration, be
entirely happy with the thought
of asking the Board of Trustees,
most of them not acadcmic
persons, to undertake so
speculative and delicate a task of
measuring academic conditions
and standards across the country
as would be necessitated by your
proposed action.
Judgments of the kind involved
in this case are unpleasant and one
would gladly escape the necessity
of making them. But I cannot
believe that the cause of academic
freedom would be served by
seeking at this stage to turn the
matter into a vain search for
consensus among the relatively
less informed and less concerned,
in place of the thoughtful and
sober judgment of our own
faculty's representatives on the
Advisory Board.
Richard W. Lyman
President
A.A.U.P. Letter
Mr. Robert Minge Brown:
The Board of Trustees has
before it President Lyman's
recommendation that Professor
Franklin be dismissed from the
Stanford Faculty forthwith, a
recommendation that quickly
accepts the decision of the
majority of the Advisory Board.
On behalf of the Executive Board
of the Stanford chapter of the
A.A.U.P., we urge the Trustees
not to act precipitously in this
matter.
In deliberating upon so serious
a question as the dismissal of a
member of the tenured faculty, it is
vital that you consider not only
the Report of the Advisory Board
and the recommendations of the
President, but accord time and
attention to such views as
representatives of the faculty and
other members of the University
may at this time wish to place
before you.
Members of the Advisory Board
have addressed the issue of the
effects upon academic freedom,
on the Stanford campus and
elsewhere, that are likely to flow
from the actions of this University
in the matter of H. Bruce
Franklin.
Although President Lyman has
expressed confidence that his
recommendation of severance
"provides no legitimate basis for
assaults on the essential rights of
faculty anywhere," we would

respectfully point out that this
assurance is beside the point. The
question here is not that of
legitimate grounds, but of likely
consequences.
And on this the Trustees are
well situated (as others hitherto
involved have not been) to take
counsel with leading members of
the wider academic community
across the nation, and with
spokesmen for Faculty Senates
and other representative
organizations like the National
A.A.U.P., as well as University
administrators, as to the wisdom
of the course of action that
President Lyman now proposes to
follow. In our view the Trustees
should not hasten to a judgment
on January 22nd, and in so doing
fail to avail themselves of this
opportunity.
John D. Goheen, President
Stanford Chapter, A.A.U.P.
Board Response
Professor John D. Goheen:
Your letter of January 12,
1972 relating to the matter of
Professor H. Bruce Franklin was
received by me today.
I can assure you that the Board
of Trustees has very much in mind
and is devoted to maintaining
academic freedom at Stanford.
Both the Advisory Board's
decision and the President's
decision which are before the
Board of Trustees, deal with that
very matter.
The Statement of Policy on
Appointment and Tenure at
Stanford University provides for a
hearing before the Advisory
Board. That hearing has been
held. The Board of Trustees does
not believe it is in a position to
reweigh the evidence or to hear
any new evidence, and it would be
neither possible nor proper for the
Board to conduct the sort of
inquiry which you suggest.
Accordingly, on behalf of the
Board of Trustees I must decline
the request of the Executive
Board of the Stanford Chapter of
the American Association of
University Professors that further
consideration of the Franklin case
be deferred in order that the
Board of Trustees might receive
expressions of viewpoints from
the various sources mentioned in
your letter.
