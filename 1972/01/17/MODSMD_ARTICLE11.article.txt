## Not A Political Trial 
### 
Herbert 1. packer

As a professor of law, I should
like to comment on the columns
by three officers of the Law
Association. I fear that the
' columns demonstrate that my
colleagues and I are not doing a
very good job of teaching our
students to think like lawyers.
I cannot possibly comment on
: all the errors in the columns; but I
shall focus on one point: the
characterization of the Franklin
| "trial" as "political."
Certainly, in one sense Bruce
Franklin's "trial" is political. Mr
j Franklin is important to
; something called the Movement
| and therefore any "trial" thatin
| volves him regardless of what he
was charged with having done and
| of what evidence was brought
forward is political in at least one
I definition of the term.
Under yet another definition,
i Mr. Franklin's "trial" for anything
i is political since he is charged with
having done something contray to
the law of the University, since
any law, even of the University,
can be termed "political."
The columns are poor because
they seem to establish a standard,
which, as I shall attempt to show.

is no standard at all. They seem to
assert that if Mr. Franklin's
actions had not been political in
that they attempted to halt
Defense Department research at
Stanford or the war in Viet Nam,
he would not have been
prosecuted.
That is, of course, just barely
possible but perhaps one should
examine the hypothetical case in
which Mr. Franklin was
prosecuted for either (a) doing
precisely what he did in an
attempt to extort $100,000 from
the University for his own use or
(b) having made the speeches that
he did make under the same
circumstances urging at the end
that people should shoot the
Chairman of the English
Department. Yet, the change in
purpose of my first hypothetical
case and the addition in the
second do not in any way change
the actual case against Mr.
Franklin
Political, sure! Under their
definition. But now let us suppose
that all the facts in my
hypotheticals remain the same but
that some other faculty member,
not associated with any movement
or counter-movement, is
substituted for Mr. Franklin.
I assume that the writers of the
letter would say: "Not political."
Apparently, the identity of the
faculty member has something to

do with the position that Mr.
Franklin was subjected to a
"political" hearing.
The use of the adjective
"political" as an epithet to
condemn a trial is a good example
of thinking with one's guts. Those
responsible for the deaths of civil
rights workers Sch werner,
Goodman and Chaney were
prosecuted as was the assassin of
Martin Luther King, Would the
authors of the columns term
those prosecutions "political"?
I would make a more modest
use of the adjective "political" in
relation to the legal process, to
denote my perception of the
defendant as one who has beliefs
counter to the existing political
order, beliefs which constitute the
main reason for his prosecution,
like the notorious Moscow purge
trials of the 1930'5.
To justify the use of the term
in this case, one would have to
assume that the members of the
Advisory Board conspired in an
effort to obscure the real reasons
for Mr. Franklin's difficulties.
On the record, I find it
impossible to believe that Mr.
Franklin was fired because of his
beliefs. Rather, I belive that he
was fired for having incited
students and others to violent,
unlawful and disruptive acts.

"political" as an epithet to
condemn a trial is a good example
of thinking with one's guts. Those
responsible for the deaths of civil
rights workers Sch werner,
Goodman and Chaney were
prosecuted as was the assassin of
Martin Luther King, Would the
authors of the columns term
those prosecutions "political"?
I would make a more modest
use of the adjective "political" in
relation to the legal process, to
denote my perception of the
defendant as one who has beliefs
counter to the existing political
order, beliefs which constitute the
main reason for his prosecution,
like the notorious Moscow purge
trials of the 1930'5.
To justify the use of the term
in this case, one would have to
assume that the members of the
Advisory Board conspired in an
effort to obscure the real reasons
for Mr. Franklin's difficulties.
On the record, I find it
impossible to believe that Mr.
Franklin was fired because of his
beliefs. Rather, I belive that he
was fired for having incited
students and others to violent,
unlawful and disruptive acts.

As a professor of law, I should
like to comment on the columns
by three officers of the Law
Association. I fear that the
' columns demonstrate that my
colleagues and I are not doing a
very good job of teaching our
students to think like lawyers.
I cannot possibly comment on
: all the errors in the columns; but I
shall focus on one point: the
characterization of the Franklin
| "trial" as "political."
Certainly, in one sense Bruce
Franklin's "trial" is political. Mr
j Franklin is important to
; something called the Movement
| and therefore any "trial" thatin
| volves him regardless of what he
was charged with having done and
| of what evidence was brought
forward is political in at least one
I definition of the term.
Under yet another definition,
i Mr. Franklin's "trial" for anything
i is political since he is charged with
having done something contray to
the law of the University, since
any law, even of the University,
can be termed "political."
The columns are poor because
they seem to establish a standard,
which, as I shall attempt to show.

is no standard at all. They seem to
assert that if Mr. Franklin's
actions had not been political in
that they attempted to halt
Defense Department research at
Stanford or the war in Viet Nam,
he would not have been
prosecuted.
That is, of course, just barely
possible but perhaps one should
examine the hypothetical case in
which Mr. Franklin was
prosecuted for either (a) doing
precisely what he did in an
attempt to extort $100,000 from
the University for his own use or
(b) having made the speeches that
he did make under the same
circumstances urging at the end
that people should shoot the
Chairman of the English
Department. Yet, the change in
purpose of my first hypothetical
case and the addition in the
second do not in any way change
the actual case against Mr.
Franklin
Political, sure! Under their
definition. But now let us suppose
that all the facts in my
hypotheticals remain the same but
that some other faculty member,
not associated with any movement
or counter-movement, is
substituted for Mr. Franklin.
I assume that the writers of the
letter would say: "Not political."
Apparently, the identity of the
faculty member has something to

do with the position that Mr.
Franklin was subjected to a
"political" hearing.
