## Marxism Always Suppressed 
###

The recommentation of the firing
of Bruce Franklin has been
analyzed from several
perspectives: its constitutional
and legal aspects, its impact upon
academic freedom or upon the
radical movement at Stanford and
its role in illuminating the real
interests of the modern liberal
university.
Significantly absent from the
discussion has been the historical
perspective, which views the
Franklin case as in fact a more
recent and a more sophisticated
manifestation of the anti-Marxist
tradition central to American
history in the 20th century.
Historians have often tried to
explain what factors prevented
the development of a large,
on-going socialist movement in
the United States similar to those
whichdeveloped in many European
countries. The attraction of this
study has been its aspect of
implicit national glorification.
In analyzing the failure of
socialist revolutionary movements
in the United States, historians
have exalted the "unique" virtues
of American society which have
supposedly stunted the
development of revolutionary
alternatives to American industrial
capitalism in the various stages.
Thus historical commentators
have claimed, for example, that
fluid class lines, a high rate of
social mobility, equal economic
opportunity or popular agreement
on fundamental points of political
philosophy have been the
primary factors undercutting
socialist revolutionary appeals.
Only more recently has another

central characteristic of this
process been given the emphasis it
deserves: the tradition of both
legal and extra-legal crusades of
suppression against Marxist parties
and movements carried out in the
name of freedom for all "except
the enemies of freedom."
This is not to deny that
factionalism, rigid dogmatism and
self-serving isolation have
contributed to the weakness or
previous American revolutionary
movements. However, it can be
stated unequivocally that agents
of suppression have continually
crippled Marxist socialist
movements by means of raids and
destruction of meeting places,
mass arrest and detention,
trumped-up legal actions,
deportation and outright murder.
Although these tactics
continue today, since World War
II quasi-legal loyalty boards or
inquiries and academic tribunals
have also come into vogue as more
sophisticated means of achieving
the same ends.
This pattern of suppression has
plagued Marxist movements from
the late 19th century to the
present day. It has been
maintained by powerful private
individuals, voluntary
organizations, elected officials
and legally constituted boards and
committees. The cooperation of
high-level state and federal
officials in manufacturing mass
popular fear and reaction against
socialists has lent the suppression
an air of legitimacy and provided
favorable circumstances for its
success.
An outstanding characteristic
of more recent crusades of

suppression has been the ease with
which the support or at least quiet
acquiesence of the liberal
community has been maintained.
When they have not been in the
vanguard of anti-communist
campaigns, liberals have failed
actively to oppose or frustrate
them. When they have complained
at all it has only been a feeble cry
for fair play.
For commitment to
fundamental principles, the liberal
community has substituted a
commitment to mere procedural
liberalism, a facade of due process
with which to camouflage real acts
of suppression.
Thus in order to garner liberal
support more recent incidents of
suppression have been marked
with increasing sophistication. Of
course para-military attacks on
minority revolutionary
organizations such as the Black
Panthers or Young Lords
continue. However recent attacks
on academic Marxists have been
characterized by scrupulous
regard for procedures as
illustrated in the Franklin case.
Just as demagoguery or violent
silencing of witnesses has
disguised naked suppression on the
popular level, amid the university
towers of rationality dutiful
respect for procedures- not

rights -has accomplished the same
end.
the experience of Cold War
suppression has changed the
emphasis from partisanship to
pretext; the old criteria for
suppression continue, hidden by
ad hoc rationalizations. And once
again a Marxist is suppressed in
the name of support, the Advisory
Board said, "of true academic
freedom and individual rights."
Thus, as the limits on dissent in
the United States have been
applied historically, Marxist
dissent has been placed beyond
the safety of tolerance, suppressed
whenever possible by the
self-proclaimed defenders of
"true" freedom. In fact this policy
of suppression has illustrated
dramtically what it is these agents
have been defending: the freedom
to pursue policy unobstructed.
In the
Franklin case one would be led to
believe that the Advisory Board
has defended precious and
fundamental freedoms. In reality
the opposite has been the case;
fundamental freedoms have been
sacrificed so that the university
may continue its comfortable
complicity in the enormity of
national policy in Southeast Asia.
