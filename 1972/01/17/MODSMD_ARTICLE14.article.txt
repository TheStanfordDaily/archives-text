## Students Can Influence Education 
### 
Judy strasser

A popular misconception on
this campus, reflected in Scott
Burke's Daily column of January
13, holds that the Stanford
Rehabilitation Movement should
"shed the delusion that any real
powerwhich the people possessto
bring about the rehiring of Bruce
Franklin can be exercised
. . .within the confines of this
university."
This line of reasoning parallels a
second defeatist attitude: nothing
students can do on campus can
get us out of Vietnam.
We know that Second attitude
is historically wrong. Student
anti-war organizations like the
Vietnam Day Committee did
much to awaken the public to the
existence of the war. Student
anti-war activity forced Lyndon
Johnson out of the Presidency.
The national student strike
following the Cambodia invasion
was instrumental in changing
Nixon's war policies in stepping
up American troop withdrawals,
Vietnamization protests occurred
on campus, at large rallies, at the
early teach-ins, in front of and
inside buildings in which
university professors engaged in
research for the war.

At Stanford, the anti-war
movement has known for at least
four years that the Vietnam issue
has very clear and important local
ramifications. Early in 1969
students who has been examining
the intimate involvement of
Stanford Trustees in war
industries invaded an on-campus
Trustees meeting, demanding an
end to such involvement.
Later in that school year, having
discovered the intimate
involvement of the Stanford
electronics laboratories in
weapons research, the April 3rd
Movement staged a peaceful 10 day
sit-in at the Applied Electronics
Laboratory.
Campus activity the following
school year (1969-70) fought the
existence of ROTC at Stanford,
revealing the sliminess of an
administration which has
promised, the previous year, to
end the program with the
military. During 1969-70,
the military was forced by
on-campus protests across the
country to drastically revamp the
national ROTC program.
And not to forget our

on-campus successes of last year,
students did end the use of the
Stanford computer for running
the infamous amphibious assault
program, Gamut H.
I don't want to credit us with
too much. I don't think students
alone, on campus, can bring about
all the changes needed in this
country. And it's clear, as many
will argue, that the successes of
on-campus movements that I've
listed above are limited: SRI
continues to do its dirty work,
without formal connections to the
university, the military continues
to recruit on campus; the Trustees
continue their nefarious activities.
I'm not sure, either, that
Stanford students can force the
university to rehire Bruce
Franklin. But it is absolutely vital
that we do everything in our
power to try. Just as it is
necessary to protest a war (or a
draft) which dehumanizes
us--which threatens our ability to
act as sisters and brothers to other
human beings--it is also necessary
to protest a firing which threatens
our own education, our ability to
question and to learn.
Tenured professors are being
censured for political activites at
other universities-- primarily in
state universites, including New
York's Stony Brook campus, the
University of West Florida, San
Diego State, Fresno State, the
Universities of Hawaii and
Nevada, to name only a few.
These attacks are formal
reflections of the kind of political
harassment non-tenured faculty
always have to endure. According
to tenure rules at Stanford and
most other universities,
"academic freedom" is reserved
for those professors who have
"proven" themselves during a
probationary period as instuctors
and assistant professors.
Of course this affects the
education received by
undergraduates taught by assistant
professors who want tenure. It
also-and much more insidiously,
in my experience,—affects the
education (though "socialization"
is probably a better word) of
graduate students.

I have sat in a Stanford
classroom while a student
proposed a class vote to determine
whether another student, critical
of social science methodology,
should be allowed to criticize the
course subject matter any longer.
The vote was averted by the
professor's skillful maneuvering,
but the refrain "I am only here to
receive the Word, not to question
it." is haunting and ever-present in
virtually all graduate studies.
That regrain is obviously not in
the spirit of good education, free
inquiry, academic freedom, or
anything else a university is
supposed to uphold, But it is the
sort of mindless, conformist
attitude that characterizes
Stanford and other American
universities. And it is precisely the
sort of attitude which will be
enhanced and reinforced by the
dismissal of a questioning,
status-quo threatening tenured
professor.
Without using emotion-laden
words like fascism or
repression--the stifling of all a
university is supposed to stand for
is implicit in the firing of Bruce
Franklin. And it is implicit not
just for Stanford, but for colleges
and universities across the
country.
As students we can fight this
suffocation of our education. We
can fight it by voting to retain

Bruce. We can fight it by building
the Stanford Rehabilitation
Movement into a nationally
significant, broadly based, on
campus protest movement.
we can fight it by asking our
liberal professors to act in support
of the academic freedom in which
they profess to believe. And we
can fight it all the time by forcing
our classes to investigate the
important, rather than the trivial
questions of our day, though we
know such questioning may lose
us our popularity, our good
grades, our degree, and perhaps
untimately a hundred thousand
dollars in life-time earnings.
For if we do not take control
over our education and our lives,
who will?

listed above are limited: SRI
continues to do its dirty work,
without formal connections to the
university, the military continues
to recruit on campus; the Trustees
continue their nefarious activities.
I'm not sure, either, that
Stanford students can force the
university to rehire Bruce
Franklin. But it is absolutely vital
that we do everything in our
power to try. Just as it is
necessary to protest a war (or a
draft) which dehumanizes
us--which threatens our ability to
act as sisters and brothers to other
human beings--it is also necessary
to protest a firing which threatens
our own education, our ability to
question and to learn.
Tenured professors are being
censured for political activites at
other universities-- primarily in
state universites, including New
York's Stony Brook campus, the
University of West Florida, San
Diego State, Fresno State, the
Universities of Hawaii and
Nevada, to name only a few.
These attacks are formal
reflections of the kind of political
harassment non-tenured faculty
always have to endure. According
to tenure rules at Stanford and
most other universities,
"academic freedom" is reserved
for those professors who have
"proven" themselves during a
probationary period as instuctors
and assistant professors.
Of course this affects the
education received by
undergraduates taught by assistant
professors who want tenure. It
also-and much more insidiously,
in my experience,—affects the
education (though "socialization"
is probably a better word) of
graduate students.

I have sat in a Stanford
classroom while a student
proposed a class vote to determine
whether another student, critical
of social science methodology,
should be allowed to criticize the
course subject matter any longer.
The vote was averted by the
professor's skillful maneuvering,
but the refrain "I am only here to
receive the Word, not to question
it." is haunting and ever-present in
virtually all graduate studies.
That regrain is obviously not in
the spirit of good education, free
inquiry, academic freedom, or
anything else a university is
supposed to uphold, But it is the
sort of mindless, conformist
attitude that characterizes
Stanford and other American
universities. And it is precisely the
sort of attitude which will be
enhanced and reinforced by the
dismissal of a questioning,
status-quo threatening tenured
professor.
Without using emotion-laden
words like fascism or
repression--the stifling of all a
university is supposed to stand for
is implicit in the firing of Bruce
Franklin. And it is implicit not
just for Stanford, but for colleges
and universities across the
country.
As students we can fight this
suffocation of our education. We
can fight it by voting to retain

Bruce. We can fight it by building
the Stanford Rehabilitation
Movement into a nationally
significant, broadly based, on
campus protest movement.
we can fight it by asking our
liberal professors to act in support
of the academic freedom in which
they profess to believe. And we
can fight it all the time by forcing
our classes to investigate the
important, rather than the trivial
questions of our day, though we
know such questioning may lose
us our popularity, our good
grades, our degree, and perhaps
untimately a hundred thousand
dollars in life-time earnings.
For if we do not take control
over our education and our lives,
who will?

A popular misconception on
this campus, reflected in Scott
Burke's Daily column of January
13, holds that the Stanford
Rehabilitation Movement should
"shed the delusion that any real
powerwhich the people possessto
bring about the rehiring of Bruce
Franklin can be exercised
. . .within the confines of this
university."
This line of reasoning parallels a
second defeatist attitude: nothing
students can do on campus can
get us out of Vietnam.
We know that Second attitude
is historically wrong. Student
anti-war organizations like the
Vietnam Day Committee did
much to awaken the public to the
existence of the war. Student
anti-war activity forced Lyndon
Johnson out of the Presidency.
The national student strike
following the Cambodia invasion
was instrumental in changing
Nixon's war policies in stepping
up American troop withdrawals,
Vietnamization protests occurred
on campus, at large rallies, at the
early teach-ins, in front of and
inside buildings in which
university professors engaged in
research for the war.

At Stanford, the anti-war
movement has known for at least
four years that the Vietnam issue
has very clear and important local
ramifications. Early in 1969
students who has been examining
the intimate involvement of
Stanford Trustees in war
industries invaded an on-campus
Trustees meeting, demanding an
end to such involvement.
Later in that school year, having
discovered the intimate
involvement of the Stanford
electronics laboratories in
weapons research, the April 3rd
Movement staged a peaceful 10 day
sit-in at the Applied Electronics
Laboratory.
Campus activity the following
school year (1969-70) fought the
existence of ROTC at Stanford,
revealing the sliminess of an
administration which has
promised, the previous year, to
end the program with the
military. During 1969-70,
the military was forced by
on-campus protests across the
country to drastically revamp the
national ROTC program.
And not to forget our

on-campus successes of last year,
students did end the use of the
Stanford computer for running
the infamous amphibious assault
program, Gamut H.

A popular misconception on
this campus, reflected in Scott
Burke's Daily column of January
13, holds that the Stanford
Rehabilitation Movement should
"shed the delusion that any real
powerwhich the people possessto
bring about the rehiring of Bruce
Franklin can be exercised
. . .within the confines of this
university."
This line of reasoning parallels a
second defeatist attitude: nothing
students can do on campus can
get us out of Vietnam.
We know that Second attitude
is historically wrong. Student
anti-war organizations like the
Vietnam Day Committee did
much to awaken the public to the
existence of the war. Student
anti-war activity forced Lyndon
Johnson out of the Presidency.
The national student strike
following the Cambodia invasion
was instrumental in changing
Nixon's war policies in stepping
up American troop withdrawals,
Vietnamization protests occurred
on campus, at large rallies, at the
early teach-ins, in front of and
inside buildings in which
university professors engaged in
research for the war.

At Stanford, the anti-war
movement has known for at least
four years that the Vietnam issue
has very clear and important local
ramifications. Early in 1969
students who has been examining
the intimate involvement of
Stanford Trustees in war
industries invaded an on-campus
Trustees meeting, demanding an
end to such involvement.
Later in that school year, having
discovered the intimate
involvement of the Stanford
electronics laboratories in
weapons research, the April 3rd
Movement staged a peaceful 10 day
sit-in at the Applied Electronics
Laboratory.
Campus activity the following
school year (1969-70) fought the
existence of ROTC at Stanford,
revealing the sliminess of an
administration which has
promised, the previous year, to
end the program with the
military. During 1969-70,
the military was forced by
on-campus protests across the
country to drastically revamp the
national ROTC program.
And not to forget our

on-campus successes of last year,
students did end the use of the
Stanford computer for running
the infamous amphibious assault
program, Gamut H.
I don't want to credit us with
too much. I don't think students
alone, on campus, can bring about
all the changes needed in this
country. And it's clear, as many
will argue, that the successes of
on-campus movements that I've
listed above are limited: SRI
continues to do its dirty work,
without formal connections to the
university, the military continues
to recruit on campus; the Trustees
continue their nefarious activities.
I'm not sure, either, that
Stanford students can force the
university to rehire Bruce
Franklin. But it is absolutely vital
that we do everything in our
power to try. Just as it is
necessary to protest a war (or a
draft) which dehumanizes
us--which threatens our ability to
act as sisters and brothers to other
human beings--it is also necessary
to protest a firing which threatens
our own education, our ability to
question and to learn.
Tenured professors are being
censured for political activites at
other universities-- primarily in
state universites, including New
York's Stony Brook campus, the
University of West Florida, San
Diego State, Fresno State, the
Universities of Hawaii and
Nevada, to name only a few.
These attacks are formal
reflections of the kind of political
harassment non-tenured faculty
always have to endure. According
to tenure rules at Stanford and
most other universities,
"academic freedom" is reserved
for those professors who have
"proven" themselves during a
probationary period as instuctors
and assistant professors.
Of course this affects the
education received by
undergraduates taught by assistant
professors who want tenure. It
also-and much more insidiously,
in my experience,—affects the
education (though "socialization"
is probably a better word) of
graduate students.

I have sat in a Stanford
classroom while a student
proposed a class vote to determine
whether another student, critical
of social science methodology,
should be allowed to criticize the
course subject matter any longer.
The vote was averted by the
professor's skillful maneuvering,
but the refrain "I am only here to
receive the Word, not to question
it." is haunting and ever-present in
virtually all graduate studies.
That regrain is obviously not in
the spirit of good education, free
inquiry, academic freedom, or
anything else a university is
supposed to uphold, But it is the
sort of mindless, conformist
attitude that characterizes
Stanford and other American
universities. And it is precisely the
sort of attitude which will be
enhanced and reinforced by the
dismissal of a questioning,
status-quo threatening tenured
professor.
Without using emotion-laden
words like fascism or
repression--the stifling of all a
university is supposed to stand for
is implicit in the firing of Bruce
Franklin. And it is implicit not
just for Stanford, but for colleges
and universities across the
country.
As students we can fight this
suffocation of our education. We
can fight it by voting to retain

Bruce. We can fight it by building
the Stanford Rehabilitation

campus protest movement.
