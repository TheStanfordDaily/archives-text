# Good-by Franklin

The following editorial is reprinted from the Chicago Daily News:
On a campus that has carried political tolerance a very long way,
the faculty advisory board of Stanford University has voted for the
immediate firing of H. Bruce Franklin, an associate professor of
English. And the fascinating part is that Franklin promptly denounced
the act as "fascist" and said it proved that "there is no such thing as
freedom for people on the left in any college in this country."
In point of fact, Franklin's own performance on the campus has
well fitted the definition of fascism with its ruthless and violent
repression of contrary views. The 37-year-old teacher has made no
bones about his devotion to violence and coercion as valid political
weapons. He openly advocated such practices when he harangued a
campus meeting early last year, counseled the forceful occupation of a
campus computer center and violent resistance to the police, and
liberally quoted Mao Tse-tung in trying later to justify his actions.
After the faculty group recommended his dismissal, he expressed
the hope that reaction on the campus would be violent. "This is a very
violent place," he explained. "There has to be counter-revolutionary
violence." [sic]
What Prof. Franklin thinks is his own business. But when he sets -
out to reduce an entire campus to chaos and ruin, that becomes an
infringement upon the rights of thousands. A university whose
campus already has become a scarred and charred battlefield surely
has no obligation 10 go on paying the salary of a man actively
dedicated to its total destruction.
