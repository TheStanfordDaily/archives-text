# Director Named
## 
### 
Prof. Marvin Chodorow, a
distinguished teacher and
researcher in applied physics and
engineering, has been appointed
director of the freshman seminar
program at Stanford. The
appointment was announced by
James L. Gibbs, Jr., dean of
undergraduate studies.
"I think this program is
particularly important because it
gives freshmen, who have usually
just graduated from high school,
some feeling for what the
university can offer them in close
interaction with a faculty

member," commented Chodorow,
who is a professor of applied
physics and electrical engineering.
"I am interested in encouraging
more faculty members,
particularly in the sciences, to
participate in the seminar
program," he added.
Chodorow, who has taught at
Stanford for 25 years, is director
of the Microwave Laboratory. His
principal research activity has
been in the theory and design of
electron devices, and he is the
co-author of Fundamentals of
Microwave Electronics.
