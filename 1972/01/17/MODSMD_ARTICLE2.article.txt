# Alleged Willsey Ouster Clouds Coach Search
## 
### CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
Late last week it appeared that
Stanford's assistant football coach
Mike White was destined to move into
the head coaching position vacated by
John Ralston on January sth. Recent
developments here and at the
University of California, however, have
raised doubts concerning White's
future.
Last Friday, President Richard
Lyman announced the formation of a
formal committee to review
applications for the head coaching
position. Also, Jack Disney of the Los
Angeles Herald-Examiner reported
yesterday that Cal coach Ray Willsey
has been forced to resign and that
White will probably receive a bid to
replace him.
The Stanford search committee,
chaired by John Harbaugh, faculty
representative to the Pac-8, met for
the first time last Friday and is not
expected to make any kind of
recommendation or progress report
until late this week.
The eleven committee members are:
Acting Athletic Director Robert
Young, junior football players Miles
Moore and Eric Cross, senior Peter
Gadd, Professor Lawrence Crowley,
Presidential special assistant James
Simmons, University employment
manager Mark Rosenfeld, Phil Moffat
of Los Angeles, Jack Ditz of Santa
Clara, and Harry Baker of Sacramento.
The establishment of this
committee is unexpected since the
athletic department announced after
Ralston's resignation that it intended
to announce a successor within 7-10
days. Now a decision will not be
possible until at least 17 days after
Ralston's departure for Denver.
Although White has a firm job offer
at Denver and is being seriously
considered at Stanford, more options
may ivelop for him this week. In a
story printed yesterday in the Los
Angeles Herald-Examiner, Jack Disney
reported that he has learned that Cal
head coach Ray Willsey has been asked
to resign and will officially step down
today.

Disney's source claims that two Cal
assistants, Myrel Moore and Bill
Dutton, were quietly dismissed two
weeks ago because of the NCAA's
investigation into the validity of Isaac
Curtis' junior college transcripts. The
Herald-Examiner story claimed that
Willsey was being dismissed as part of
a general house-cleaning due to the
NCAA scandal which rendered Cal
ineligible.
Disney reported that sources close
to Willsey feel that the successful Cal
coach is being used as the scapegoat
for the school's unfortunate position
with the NCAA.
Disney also speculated that Cal
wants to replace Willsey with none
other than Mike White who graduated
from Berkeley in 1958 and worked as
an assistant coach there. Last week's
