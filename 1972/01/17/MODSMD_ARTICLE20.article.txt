# Gymnasts Topple SC
## 
### DOUG WILSON 
Steve Hug, the Stanford
gymnast who made his acrobatic
debut Friday night after a year of
injury, wowed a packed crowd in
the Old Pavilion with virtuoso
performances on the side horse
and high bar, won all but one of
the six gymnastic events, and led a
young, promising Stanford team
to a decisive 150.85-125.15
victory over the University of
Southern California. Hug's lone
loss was to teammate Howard
Bessen on the rings.
The Indian gymnastic squad
showed depth as well as individual
ability in defeating the Trojans for
the first time in 20 years. "Last
year, a much stronger, USC team
scored 148 points," commented
coach Dan Mill man, "but we still
would have beaten them. UCLA
will be tougher, though." The
Indians meet the Bruins here Feb.
4.
Cards Dominate
Stanford dominated the meet
from beginning to end. Hug and
freshman Bob Anderson both
scored higher than the 8.5 point
total accumulated by USC's
George Lee in the opening floor
exercise event to combine with
Hector Neff's 8.25 score, giving
the Indians a four-point lead after
floor ex which increased as the
evening went on.
Hug accumulated the first of
three "over-nine" scores of the
meet on the side horse; his
performance garnered him 9.15
points to runner-up Kurt
Zimmerman of USC (8.40). John
Greene of Southern Cal was third
with 8.25 points, and Neff, of
Stanford, fourth with 7.70.
Hug also totalled nine or better
points in the vaulting and high bar
events, the latter to give him the
loudest ovation as well as the
highest score of the evening
(9.30). Contributing to Stanford's
team effort in the vaulting were
Leo Hollberg and Shawn Skerrett;

Anderson and Neff joined Hug for
a team victory on the high bar.
Bessen Bests Hug
Sophomore Howard Bessen,
clearly one of the team's most
improved members, proved to be
the only competitor on either
squad who could best Hug in an
event. Bessen earned the plaudits
of the crowd and a winning score
of 8.70 from the judges for his
smooth performance on the rings.
Clearly pleased with the
victory, Mill man nevertheless
emphasized that "the team is
winning without putting emphasis
on winning." Millman stresses the
aesthetic value of the sport both
in coaching and in performance;

"aesthetic mastery" counts most
heavily (4 out of a possible 10
points) in scoring a gymnastic
event.
Millman announced that Hug
has been chosen to compete on an
American All-Star team composed
of the country's six top gymnasts
which will face the best Japanese
gymnasts in a meet to be held at
the end of this month in
Pennsylvania. During Hug's
absence, the Indians will be
competing in a non-conference
seven team meet at UCLA and
Millman is very interested to see
how the team will perform
without its most talented
member.

performance garnered him 9.15
points to runner-up Kurt
Zimmerman of USC (8.40). John
Greene of Southern Cal was third
with 8.25 points, and Neff, of
Stanford, fourth with 7.70.
Hug also totalled nine or better
points in the vaulting and high bar
events, the latter to give him the
loudest ovation as well as the
highest score of the evening
(9.30). Contributing to Stanford's
team effort in the vaulting were
Leo Hollberg and Shawn Skerrett;

Anderson and Neff joined Hug for
a team victory on the high bar.
Bessen Bests Hug
Sophomore Howard Bessen,
clearly one of the team's most
improved members, proved to be
the only competitor on either
squad who could best Hug in an
event. Bessen earned the plaudits
of the crowd and a winning score
of 8.70 from the judges for his
smooth performance on the rings.
Clearly pleased with the
victory, Mill man nevertheless
emphasized that "the team is
winning without putting emphasis
on winning." Millman stresses the
aesthetic value of the sport both
in coaching and in performance;

"aesthetic mastery" counts most
heavily (4 out of a possible 10
points) in scoring a gymnastic
event.
Millman announced that Hug
has been chosen to compete on an
American All-Star team composed
of the country's six top gymnasts
which will face the best Japanese
gymnasts in a meet to be held at
the end of this month in
Pennsylvania. During Hug's
absence, the Indians will be
competing in a non-conference
seven team meet at UCLA and
Millman is very interested to see
how the team will perform
without its most talented
member.

EASY RIDER—Bob Anderson, shown here on the side horse, finished second overall in Stanford's triumphant gymnastics
meet against USC Friday night. Anderson was considered to be the top high school gymnast in the nation last year.
Steve Hug, the Stanford
gymnast who made his acrobatic
debut Friday night after a year of
injury, wowed a packed crowd in
the Old Pavilion with virtuoso
performances on the side horse
and high bar, won all but one of
the six gymnastic events, and led a
young, promising Stanford team
to a decisive 150.85-125.15
victory over the University of
Southern California. Hug's lone
loss was to teammate Howard
Bessen on the rings.
The Indian gymnastic squad
showed depth as well as individual
ability in defeating the Trojans for
the first time in 20 years. "Last
year, a much stronger, USC team
scored 148 points," commented
coach Dan Mill man, "but we still
would have beaten them. UCLA
will be tougher, though." The
Indians meet the Bruins here Feb.
4.
Cards Dominate
Stanford dominated the meet
from beginning to end. Hug and
freshman Bob Anderson both
scored higher than the 8.5 point
total accumulated by USC's
George Lee in the opening floor
exercise event to combine with
Hector Neff's 8.25 score, giving
the Indians a four-point lead after
floor ex which increased as the
evening went on.
Hug accumulated the first of
three "over-nine" scores of the
meet on the side horse; his
performance garnered him 9.15
points to runner-up Kurt
Zimmerman of USC (8.40). John
Greene of Southern Cal was third
with 8.25 points, and Neff, of
Stanford, fourth with 7.70.
