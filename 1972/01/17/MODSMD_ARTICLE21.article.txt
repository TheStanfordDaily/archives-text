# Bruins Show That They're Number 1

### MIKE HERMAN 
As a year, 1972 had opened brilliantly for the Stanford athletic
department. After all, the football team had come from the lower
depths of defeat to hand the previously unbeaten Michigan Wolverines
an incredible 13-12 loss. And, while the rest of the country wasn't
looking, the basketball team had begun the new year with victories
over Dartmouth, Washington State and Washington. The latter
accomplishment had placed the Indians in the rarified air of first
place in the Pacific Eight Conference, along with UCLA and USC, the
preseason co-favorites. For the time being, the students might have
been excused for a little bit of dreaming, perhaps even to the extent
of visualizing the great confrontation of the Indians and Long Beach
State in the NCAA Far West Regionals.
Last Friday night, all that dreaming came to an end. The Indians
were shocked back into the realities of the Pac-8, a conference
seemingly owned and operated by the Bruins of UCLA. To an
objective Stanford fan, the feelings were of pity for the Indians and
admiration for the awesome Bruins. To a UCLA fan (there is no such
thing as an objective one), there was only the near-sadistic pleasure of
watching yet another team mutilated by UCLA. For the last eight
years, Sports Illustrated and other sport magazines have gone out of

their respective ways to find some team, from the streets of New York
to the beaches of Florida, from the bluegrass of Kentucky to the
Central neighborhoods of Los Angeles, that could successfully wrest
the NCAA crown away from the Bruins. All have failed. Every March,
for the past eight years, save 1966, the Bruins have walked away with
the NCAA championship.
Friday night, Stanford took the court with a six game winning
streak, a center who had successfully flattened Steve Hawes, the
preseason choice for the best center in the conference, and a guard
who was the second leading scorer in the league last season and
Stanford's most prolific scorer of all time.
The Indians started fairly well in the game, surprising the Pauley
Pavilion crowd by hitting a good percentage of their shots and sticking
successfully to their game plan. Unfortunately, so were the Bruins.
The key to the victory for the Bruins is found in the brilliance of
two performers, guard Henry Bibby and center Bill Walton. Each has a
twenty-one point scoring average, and each may very well find himself
on an All-American team by the end of the season. Against the
Indians, Walton scored 32, Bibby hit for 22 points.
The match-up between Stanford's Claude Terry and UCLA's Bibby
was something to be seen. Terry, guarded by sophomores Greg Lee
and Tommy Curtis, pumped in some beautiful fall-away jumpers that
drew admiring "oohs" and "ahhs" from the Bruin rooting section.
Clearly the one controlling force on the court for the Indians, he
managed to hit 59% of his shots, while scoring twenty-three points
and grabbing six rebounds.
Bibby, on the other hand, was guarded alternately by seniors Bob
Nicholson and Darrell Fregia, yet managed to get open for his usual
assortment of long range bombs. Accepting most of the outlet passes
in the Bruins' famed fast break, he also scored many of his
twenty-two points on spectacular layups. It might be concluded that
the battle of two of the best guards in the country might have been
called a draw.
The 118-79 loss was not unexpected, if surprising in its size. Pauley
Pavilion has earned a reputation for being a death trap for visiting
teams, UCLA having lost only twice there in the past six and a half
years. Last year, Stanford lost to UCLA by 35 points at Pauley, but
was barely edged, 58-53, when the Bruins came up to the Farm. There
is hope in the rematch on the fourth of March, but after witnessing
the massacre that took place in Los Angeles, that hope is slight.
