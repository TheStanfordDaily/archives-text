500-yd freestyle in a time of
4:57.5, followed by Bert Webb of
Stanford (5:08.8). Stanford
completed its sweep of the
distance races with victories in the
1000 by Sutton (10:12.8) and in

(1:47.6). Steve Carey and Martin
Pedley split victories in the
sprints; Carey's winning time in
the 100 was :49.8, and Pedley

failed to lose an event and
succeeded in thoroughly
trouncing Oregon State's hapless
Beavers, 105-28, in Saturday's
meet at Encina Pool.
While veterans Brian Job, Rick
Longinotti and Steve Carey easily
won their events as expected, a
pleasant surprise for the Indians
came in the strong diving
performance of Steve
Riffenburgh, who won both the 1-
and 3-meter diving events, and
from his freshman teammate,
Rich Rector, who placcd second
on the 3-meter board to give the
Indians a clean sweep of the
event. Riffenburgh compiled
219.6 points on the low board,
and 210.45 points on the 3-meter
board, defeating Rector by 11
points.

breaststroke record he set a week
ago by swimming the event in
57.9 seconds (lowering the old
mark by almost two full seconds)
and won the 200 yd IM in a time
of 2:00.2. Team captain Dave
Shilling placed second in the
100-yd breaststroke event
(1:00.7), but won the 200-yd

after Job was disqualified for

taking two false starts.

clocking.

the 100-yd butterfly with times of
: 53.1 and:53.2, respectively.

the 200 butterfly race with a time
of 1:58.0. He was followed by
Indians Terry Sutton (2:01.7) and
Longinotti (2:02.5).
Randy Whitchurch won both
backstroke races, churning to
victory over teammates Jack
Deppe in a winning time of :55.5
