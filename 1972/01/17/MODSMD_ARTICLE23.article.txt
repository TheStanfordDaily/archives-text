# Tough Weekend In LA
## 
### HALL DAILY 
Stanford took its 5-game winning streak to Los
Angeles last weekend and came away with its
accustomed two losses. The Cards, now 6-7 on the
season and 2-2 in Pac-8 conference play, were
thumped by the top-ranked UCLA Bruins on
Friday, 118-79, and edged in the final seven seconds
by the tenth-ranked USC Trojans Saturday, 65-63.
Led by outstanding individual performances by
Claude Terry with 19 points and Bob Buell with 12
rebounds and over-all poised team play, the Indian
hoopsters rallied to tie up the Trojans five times in
the second half. Trailing 63-58 with less than three
minutes to go in the game, the stubborn Stanford
man-to-man defense held Troy scoreless, while
25-foot jumpers by Bob Nicholson and Dave Frost
and a Terry free throw knotted the score at 63 with
44 seconds remaining.
SC called timeout and Coach Bob Boyd told his

team to get the ball to Paul Westphal, Troy's
Ail-American guard. Westphal immediately got the
ball, stalling on the dribble for the final shot.
Getting around Terry, he drove in deep and scored a
left-handed lay-in over Frost despite Frost's foul
with seven seconds left.
Westphal missed the free throw, but 6-10 SC
Sophomore center Mike Westra grabbed the
rebound, hustling the ball back out to Westphal.
Westphal, who led all scorers with 23 points and
5 assists, then threw up an airball from the charity
stripe. Ron Riley picked off the short shot and blew
a cripple with four seconds left.
Last Effort
Buell rebounded Riley's errant attempt and
dribbled to the top of the key before losing control
of the ball in the final second.
USC Coach Boyd, hardly noted for expansiveness
when it comes to Stanford, complimented the
Indians' tenacity. "Stanford played a very smart
game," Boyd said. "I thought their team kept its
poise very well. It could have cracked when we were
ahead by 10 points in the first half, but it didn't."
Trailing 28-18 with 7:30 left in the opening
frame, Stanford outscored the Trojans 18-9 to draw
within one point, 37-36, at the intermission.
Coming off the bench, Darrell Fregia and
Frost - -who scored eleven and ten points
respectively, led the first half rally.
Along with his game-high 12 rebounds, Buell also
tossed in 9 points. Nicholson scored 8 points and
was credited with three assists. Defensively, Steve
Shupe and Mike Mann held SC's two
centers—Westra and Bill Taylor—to 5 points
between them.
UCLA Disaster
At Pavley Pavilion, the high-flying Uclans played
rude host to the Cards as they demolished Stanford,
118-79. 6-11 sophomore center Bill Walton hit on
10 of 12 shots, mostly tip-ins, for 20 points in the
first half. The Bruins outscored the Cards 59-35 in
the opening half, going to the dressing room with a
68 percent field goal shooting mark.
After taking a 2-0 lead on Mann's 25-foot jump
shot, Stanford kep up with the defending NCAA
champs through five minutes, trailing only 10-8.
But by the midway point of the first half, UCLA
had run up a 30-12 margin paced by a ten point
scoring spree by Henry Bibby. After that, the Bruins
never even looked back.
Walton led all scorers with 32 points and 15
rebounds. Coach Howie Dallmar could only say,
"All I saw was Walton... it all goes down to
Walton. My center [Mann] is 6-9 and Walton
appears to be 7-1 next to him. But to me, he looks
like he's 7-8."
