Dock Strike Imminent
SAN FRANCISCO — Faced with a Monday morning
deadline and a threat of further government intervention,
negotiators for longshoremen and shippers held sessions
late last night in an effort to avert resumption of a strike
at 24 West Coast ports.
Negotiators, including J. Curtis Counts, head of the
Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, had no
comment as they went back into joint sessions at 8:15 last
night.
Muskie: Amnesty After War
WASHINGTON — Sen. Edmund S. Muskie said yesterday
he could not support amnesty for exiled draft-evaders
until the end of American fighting in Southeast Asia.
"When the war is over and the fighting is ended," the
Maine senator said, conditional repatriation of those who

fled the United States to avoid the draft should be a
national objective.
Asked whether he could support amnesty now, the
Democratic presidential candidate replied, "I cannot bring
myself to say that, and say to those who are still fighting
and dying, 'your obligation under the draft continues."
Muskie's statement closely paralleled President Nixon's
comments on the subject Jan. 2. Nixon said then that he
"would be very liberal with regard to amnesty, but not
while there are Americans in Vietnam fighting to serve
their country and defend their country and not when
POWs are held by North Vietnam."
Nixon added that any later consideration of amnesty
"would have to be on the basis of their paying the price,
of course, that anyone should pay for violating the law."
Muskie brushed aside former Sen. Eugene McCarthy's
attacks on Muskie's past support of the war.
McCarthy, also a candidate for the Democratic
presidential nomination as he was in 1968, was asked to
comment on the fact that the 1968 Democratic ticket of
Hubert H. Humphrey and Muskie generally supported the
Johnson administration's war policies.
• Admitting errors of 1968, McCarthy said, "is to ask the
people to credit you with rather bad judgment."
Muskie responded, "I've said that I was wrong on the
war. . . That is not my argument for my candidacy, but
an explanation of a past position."
Cowboyg Win Super Bowl
NEW ORLEANS — Dodging Roger Staubach led the
Dallas Cowboys to the biggest victory in the club's
12-year history Sunday—a 24-3 thumping of the Miami
Dolphins in Super Bowl VI.
Passing for two seven-yard touchdowns—to Lance
Alworth and Mike Ditka—and flawlessly directing a
ground attack that set a Super Bowl record, Staubach did
what no other quarterback has been able to do for the
Cowboys—wipe out the derisive "Can't Win The Big
Ones" label.
The people who relish defense had their focal points
too—defensive tackle Bob Lilly, who led a unit that cut

off Miami's vaunted rushing attack, and linebacker Chuck
Howley, who recovered a fumble that set up the
Cowboys' first score and intercepted a pass that set up
another touchdown.
Muskie Leads, CBS Says
NEW YORK — A national survey by CBS News indicates
Sen. Edmund Muskie of Maine would have 1,199 delegate
votes, only 319 votes short of victory, in the Democratic
National Convention.
Muskie's closest rival, according to the CBS survey, was
Sen. Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota, the 1968 candidate,
with 311 delegate votes.
The Democratic convention will have 3,016 delegate
votes with 1,509 required for nomination.
Attendees Party Loses Seats
SANTIAGO, Chile — The anti-Marxist opposition
overwhelmed President Salvador Allende's leftist
government yesterday in two special congressional
elections regarded as popularity tests for his socialist
programs.
The Popular Unity, Allende's party, issued a statement
after the returns, calling the election results "a transitory
defeat." Carlos Altimirano, head of the Socialist party,
said the results showed the need "to radicalize" the
government's programs.
Pakistanis Called 6 Animals 9
DACCA — Sheik Mujibur Rahman called West Pakistani
troops "worse than animals" last night and charged that
they massacred three million people in East Pakistan
before the province became independent Bangladesh.
He said the United Nations should try Pakistani leaders
"the way German fascist war criminals were tried" after
World War 11.
Mujib, prime minister of the new nation, was
interviewed in Dacca by David Frost on British television.

The sheik called the action by Pakistani forces in the
former province the "greatest massacre of a people in
history."
"They are not human beings, they are uncivilized
cretins," he said. "All people have some animal qualities,
but these people are worse than animals."
The Pakistan army arrested Mujib, 51, last March when
it cracked down on his movement for autonomy in East
Pakistan. Millions fled the province to India and India
defeated Pakistan last December in a two-week war for
the independence of Bangladesh.
