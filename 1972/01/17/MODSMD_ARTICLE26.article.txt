# Davis Trial
## 
### 
Public and media accommodations for the upcoming
Angela Davis trial were announced last week by Santa
Clara Sheriff's officials.
Thirty spectators per day will be allowed into the
courtroom to view the trial which begins on January 31.
Seats will be alloted on a first-come, first-serve basis.
Davis will be tried in Superior Courtroom 1 in the
Criminal Legal Building on Hedding St. in San Jose. The
courtroom seats only 60.
Lt. Donald Tamm, Santa Clara Community Relations
Officer, released the tentative allocation of the 30 media
seats to the major wire services, television networks,
newsmagazines, Bay Area newspapers and TV, and
rotating seats for the national and
international press.
College press, including the Daily and the San Jose
State Daily Spartan (both of which applied for a regular
seat on behalf of the college press nationwide), were
denied, and will be seated in the large national press pool
of two seats. Newsmen who lack a courtroom seat will
view the trial on closed circuit TV in an adjacent building.
According to Tamm, the TV monitors will not be trained
on the jury or spectators.
Spectators and newsmen will proceed through metal
detectors before entering the courtroom and press rooms.
Everyone will be subject to search. No cameras or sound
recordings of any type will be permitted in either the
courtroom or closed circuit TV press room.
