# Rally At Hoover Scheduled, Franklin To Lecture Today
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
The Stanford Rehabilitation
Movement's (SRM) second week of
protest against the firing of Associate
English Professor H. Bruce Franklin
will include a rally at noon today at
the Hoover Institution.
The Movement is an ad hoc
committee consisting of members of
Venceremos, the Association of Young
Crows and the Faculty Political Action
Group.
The rally has been called "to
congratulate the new nominees to the
(Institution's) Board of Overseers,"
Supreme Court Justice and Stanford
graduate William H. Rehnquist and
former Stanford Trustee and former
Deputy Defense Secretary David
Packard.
(Last week the University Board of
Trustees extended an invitation to
Rehnquist and Packard to become

members of the Board.)
Demand Reasons
Representatives of SRM say that
they plan to enter the Institution "to
demand the reasons behind the
selection of Packard and Rehnquist."
(See text of SRM's letter on page 2.)
The rally will serve to begin what the
movement has termed "Who Controls
the University Week."
Franklin will begin teaching English
190 today at 3:15 p.m. in Columbae
House, 517 Cowell Lane. "Literature
and Revolution," a four unit seminar
under the sponsorship of English
Professor Robert Polhemus and
graduate student Merle Rabine, is a
substitute for the class which Franklin
was to have taught this quarter.
The SRM has also announced plans
to confront three "liberal" professors
who might "want to get rid of
Franklin." Protesters have announced
they will go today to the 9:00 a.m.
classes of Associate Anthropology
Professor Arthur Wolf and Art
Professor Micheal Sullivan. The 11:00
a.m. class of Economics Professor
John Gurley will also be "visited."
Discussions with other professors in
their classes are planned throughout
the week. Among those professors
who are being considered for "visits"
are: Mark Mancall, History; Herant
Katchadourian, Human Biology;
Robert North, Political Science; Diane
Middlebrook, English; Lyman
Van-Slyke, History; and Paul Seaver,
History.
Friday Rally
SRM sponsored a noon rally Friday
to continue its protest on behalf of
Franklin. More than 200 people
attended.
Venceremos member Don Lee, first
major speaker at the rally, spoke of
SRM's ultimatum to "Rehire Bruce by
Tuesday Noonâ€”Or Else!" Lee said
that "Tuesday noon came and the 'or
else' is still pending."
Lee explained that "the 'or else' is
not a climactic action, but the building
of a movement." As originally
planned, the ultimatum included the
threat to occupy a building. Lee told
the rally that "we couldn't occupy a
building without severe losses to our
ranks."
The SRM was described by Lee as
"a serious threat to the University,
serious enough to have the Tac Squad
called out." He was referring to the 12
members of the Santa Clara County
Sheriffs Tactical Squad which met
250 protesters when they marched to
the Hansen Micro-Wave Laboratory
Tuesday.

In the other major speech at the
rally, Pacific Studies Center
researcher Steve Weissman introduced
the "Dick Lyman Big Broom for Good
Housecleaning." Weissman referred in
his speech to remarks made by Lyman
when he became President: "The
University is going to have to put its
own house in order."
Weissman explained that only
"liberals" are eligible to win the "Big
Broom" and that "the most original
sacrifice of principles at the end of this
week" will win the Broom. Members
of the Faculty Advisory Board which
recommended Franklin's firing are
ineligible, Weissman explained,
"because they would win hands
down."
This Wednesday and Thursday's
student referendum on Franklin's
firing also figures in the plans of the
SRM. Venceremos member Leslie
Rabine said that "we do consider the
referendum important." She explained
that Movement members will be
discussing the vote with students in
the dorms and will be manning the
polls on the election days.
