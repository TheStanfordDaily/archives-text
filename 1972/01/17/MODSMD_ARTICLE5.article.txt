# More Women, Minorities
## Hiring Policy Changed 
### TINA COOPER 
Faced with a pending federal
investigation into Stanford's hiring
practices, administrators say they are
accelerating a program to put more
women and minority members into
faculty, managerial and professional
positions.

Heading this "affirmative action"
program is assistant to the President
Luis Nogales. Nogales coordinates
recruitment efforts of all departments
in the University, and will act as a
liaison with HEW during the
investigation.
Nogales states, however, that the
University has not yet been formally
contacted by HEW Contract
Compliance investigators.
Waite Madison, Chief of the San
Francisco Contract Compliance
Branch, confirmed this. He cited the
"terrible backlog" of recorded
complaints as the reason for delay.
"However," he added, "there will
certainly be an investigation at some
time in the future."
Clerical Women
A study released last fall indicates
women staff the majority of
University clerical and
non-professional jobs, while men
dominate the technical, managerial
and professional areas.
Luis Nogales agrees that it is quite
likely that Stanford will be contacted
in the near future. He emphasized,
however, that the "affirmative action"
program was formed before a suit by
HEW was a threat. It has been active
since 1969.
"Affirmative action" he explained,
formulates programs to relieve
discrimination in two main
employment areas. The first program
concentrates on unbalanced
percentages of employment in specific
fields. Only 15 percent of the
employees in managerial positions at
Stanford are women. In contrast,
women occupy 93 percent of the
clerical and secretarial jobs.
Nogales indicates that a special
counseling program to provide support
and information to women seeking

promotion is being considered.
The second area of concentration is
salary parity. Nogales mentioned
discriminating conditions of
employment as a strong negative
factor here. "Maternity leave should
be allowed for," he said. "A woman
has a right to have a baby without
paying for it on the job."
Recondition Employers
Nogales also mentioned "affirmative
action" attempts to recondition
employers who are simply prejudiced
against hiring women. "We have to
work to change cultural attitudes by
changing behavior," he said.
Members of Venceremos, the
Women's Union, United Stanford
Employees, and the Third World
Liberation Front have joined to form
their own coalition for "affirmative
action."
Leslie Rabine, one of the coalition
leaders, stated that the group was
writing an "independent program" for
equal hiring.
Since 1969, when the federal
government recognized sex as a basis
for complaints about job
discrimination, HEW has taken action
against such major universities as
Columbia and Michigan. After
Columbia University Women's
Liberation filed a complaint against
Columbia's employment practices,
HEW began to pressure the university
to draft and implement an equal
employment plan. After 30 months,
HEW began legal proceedings to
withdraw all federal contracts from
the university. Millions of dollars
would have been lost with those
contracts. Columbia immediately
volunteered to begin work on an
employment plan.
"We're moving as fast as we can,"
comments Luis Nogales.

PROTESTERS CHARGED—This November 4 demonstration inside the Placement Center has resulted in charges against
five students before the Campus Judicial Panel. Assistant to the President John Schwartz has charged Peter Knutson and
Paul Loeb of the Young Crows, Don Lee of Venceremos, sophomore Steve Downey, and an unidentified fifth person
with violating the Policy on Campus Disruption. John Kaplan, Chairman of the Panel, stated that a hearing date has not
yet been set and no pre-hearing motions have been made. About 150 persons participated in the protest which forced
Honeywell Corporation recruiters to leave the center. The demonstrators left only after being threatened with arrest by
police.

Nogales also mentioned "affirmative
action" attempts to recondition
employers who are simply prejudiced
against hiring women. "We have to
work to change cultural attitudes by
changing behavior," he said.
Members of Venceremos, the
Women's Union, United Stanford
Employees, and the Third World
Liberation Front have joined to form
their own coalition for "affirmative
action."
Leslie Rabine, one of the coalition
leaders, stated that the group was
writing an "independent program" for
equal hiring.
Since 1969, when the federal
government recognized sex as a basis
for complaints about job
discrimination, HEW has taken action
against such major universities as
Columbia and Michigan. After
Columbia University Women's
Liberation filed a complaint against
Columbia's employment practices,
HEW began to pressure the university
to draft and implement an equal
employment plan. After 30 months,
HEW began legal proceedings to
withdraw all federal contracts from
the university. Millions of dollars
would have been lost with those
contracts. Columbia immediately
volunteered to begin work on an
employment plan.
"We're moving as fast as we can,"
comments Luis Nogales.

PROTESTERS CHARGED—This November 4 demonstration inside the Placement Center has resulted in charges against
five students before the Campus Judicial Panel. Assistant to the President John Schwartz has charged Peter Knutson and
Paul Loeb of the Young Crows, Don Lee of Venceremos, sophomore Steve Downey, and an unidentified fifth person
with violating the Policy on Campus Disruption. John Kaplan, Chairman of the Panel, stated that a hearing date has not
yet been set and no pre-hearing motions have been made. About 150 persons participated in the protest which forced
Honeywell Corporation recruiters to leave the center. The demonstrators left only after being threatened with arrest by
police.
Faced with a pending federal
investigation into Stanford's hiring
practices, administrators say they are
accelerating a program to put more
women and minority members into
faculty, managerial and professional
positions.

Heading this "affirmative action"
program is assistant to the President
Luis Nogales. Nogales coordinates
recruitment efforts of all departments
in the University, and will act as a
liaison with HEW during the
investigation.
Nogales states, however, that the
University has not yet been formally
contacted by HEW Contract
Compliance investigators.
Waite Madison, Chief of the San
Francisco Contract Compliance
Branch, confirmed this. He cited the
"terrible backlog" of recorded
complaints as the reason for delay.
"However," he added, "there will
certainly be an investigation at some
time in the future."
Clerical Women
A study released last fall indicates
women staff the majority of
University clerical and
non-professional jobs, while men
dominate the technical, managerial
and professional areas.
Luis Nogales agrees that it is quite
likely that Stanford will be contacted
in the near future. He emphasized,
however, that the "affirmative action"
program was formed before a suit by
HEW was a threat. It has been active
since 1969.
"Affirmative action" he explained,
formulates programs to relieve
discrimination in two main
employment areas. The first program
concentrates on unbalanced
percentages of employment in specific
fields. Only 15 percent of the
employees in managerial positions at
Stanford are women. In contrast,
women occupy 93 percent of the
clerical and secretarial jobs.
Nogales indicates that a special
counseling program to provide support
and information to women seeking

promotion is being considered.
The second area of concentration is
salary parity. Nogales mentioned
discriminating conditions of
employment as a strong negative
factor here. "Maternity leave should
be allowed for," he said. "A woman
has a right to have a baby without
paying for it on the job."
Recondition Employers
Nogales also mentioned "affirmative
action" attempts to recondition
employers who are simply prejudiced
against hiring women. "We have to
work to change cultural attitudes by
changing behavior," he said.
