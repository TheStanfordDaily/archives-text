# Lack Of Student Participation Threatens SWOPSI Autonomy

If students do not participate in SWOPSI's operation,
the Dean of Undergraduate Studies will take over its
leadership, SWOPSI Director Dan Lewis has warned.
Currently, the Stanford Workshops on Political and
Social Issues is controlled mainly by its own Policy Board.
The Board is composed of five students, five faculty
members, and one other appointee.
But SWOPSI is officially a "Special Joint Agency,"
under direction of the SWOPSI staff and the Committee
on Undergraduate Studies, as well as the Policy Board.
Lewis denied a recent report of friction between the
staff and the Policy Board. But he conceded there are
conflicts between the Policy Board and the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies.
Student Interest
The problem in part developed from a lack of student
interest in SWOPSI's operations, according to Lewis.
Several student positions on the Policy Board have been
vacant recently, and the Board has found it difficult to
gather a quorum at its meetings.
(Two new names have been accepted for the Board by
the ASSU's Nominations Committee. The nominations are
now pending approval of the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies.)
"If the program is going to have autonomy and
freedom, the Policy Board has to have student support,"
Lewis warned.

He said the lack of student concern will result in
SWOPSI's "institutionalization" and its control by the
administration's Office of Undergraduate Studies.
Criticism
In addition to internal tensions, SWOPSI was criticized
by the Chaparral recently for its proposal to boost next
year's SWOPSI budget from $23,000 to $44,000. The
article charged the budget increase would do little to
"improve innovative education" and implied the budget
increase will result primarily in more administrative red
tape and bureaucracy.
Lewis denies the charge. Although the salary budget
would be double its present level, Lewis said salaries
would still be only a small part of the budget increase.
$5,000 is being requested for an
Instructional Fund. Presently all instructors teach without
pay-
There is also a $5,000 requisition for the Workshop
Fund. This money is used to cover general operating
expenses. The budget for the instruction, workshop, and
publications funds would approximately triple from this
year's level.
Although few Stanford students participate in
SWOPSI's leadership, SWOPSI plays a major role in class
enrollment. Participation in SWOPSI classes seems to
maintain last year's level. Although bureaucratic problems
caused SWOPSI to offer fewer courses than usual this fall,
there are 24 course offerings this quarter, and an
equivalent number is planned for spring.
