## Moving On Hoover 
### 
■ Stanford rehabilitation movement

The Stanford Rehabilitation
Movement is moving on Hoover,
with a rally and actions beginning
at noon in front of Hoover Tower.
Founded in 1919 by Herbert
Hoover, and dedicated to
"demonstrate the evils of Karl
Marx" Hoover institute is in need
of rehabilitation, not only because
of its direct connections with
Franklin's firing, but because of
the role it plays in Stanford's
imperialist propaganda machine.
Concentration on the military
hardware and counter insurgency
research produced at Stanford
should not lose sight of the highly
supportive effects that direct
anti-communist propaganda has
on the right.
Hoover is often considered to
be a "paper tiger," a mindless
institute with a library open to all,
a last-ditch-stand political target.
This is not the case.
Since 1959, when Glen
Campbell was appointed director
of the Institute, to carry out the
resolution to "protect the
American way of life from such
ideologies (communism and
socialism)," Hoover has developed
from a library to an active
propaganda machine. With a
budget of nearly 2 million dollars,
a quarter or more of which comes
directly from Stanford, Hoover
has sponsored right-wing
conferences and lent legitimacy to

war criminals and government
spokesmen on this campus.
Last January, Hoover brought
Henry Cabot Lodge to campus,
and succeeded in bringing charges
against Franklin when he helped
expose the "free speech" issue by
revealing the degree to which
Lodge's opposition is forced to
remain silent.
Last October, the Iranian
Student Association attacked a
Hoover conference entitled "Iran:
25 Centuries of Achievement,"
condemning the conference as
part of the Shah's propaganda
machine. The students revealed
that that achievement has actually
been the consolidation of a regime
characterized by terror and
repression, "economically,
politically and militarily
dependent on United States
imperialism."
In June of this year, Hoover
will co-sponsor a conference on
"China," the first half was held a
year ago on Taiwan, from which
the press was barred and which
was attended by right wing
professors from the United States,
some of whom themselves
criticized the conference as being
right wing propaganda.
Publications and conferences
alone don't indicate the degree of
influence Hoover has. Hoover's
"scholars" and directors are
influential on every level of

American government (including
Glen Campbell's connections with
the Republican party consolidated
when he worked for Goldwater's
presidential campaign.)
Hoover's most recent nominees
to the Board of Overseers
ominously underscore Hoover's
connections with government and
big business, and bring Hoover's
involvement in the imperialist
machine full circle, directly into
the spotlight of Franklin's case.
This will be a prime focus of the
confrontation planned for Hoover
this noon.
First we have the Lodge
incident, where a war criminal is
brought to this campus under the
aegis of Hoover. Then follow the
charges against Franklin and the
hearing. The week the Advisory
board recommends that Franklin
be fired, David Packard, former
deputy secretary of defense
donates $2.6 to Stanford.
Rehnquist is appointed to the
Supreme Court as Franklin's case
moves into the public legal area.
The connections can hardly be
coincidental. Join us today at
noon in front of Hoover tower.

Stanford Rehabilitation
Movement includes Pete Knutson,

Ho, Gerri Foote, and Judy

■ Stanford rehabilitation movement

The Stanford Rehabilitation
Movement is moving on Hoover,
with a rally and actions beginning
at noon in front of Hoover Tower.
Founded in 1919 by Herbert
Hoover, and dedicated to
"demonstrate the evils of Karl
Marx" Hoover institute is in need
of rehabilitation, not only because
of its direct connections with
Franklin's firing, but because of
the role it plays in Stanford's
imperialist propaganda machine.
Concentration on the military
hardware and counter insurgency
research produced at Stanford
should not lose sight of the highly
supportive effects that direct
anti-communist propaganda has
on the right.
Hoover is often considered to
be a "paper tiger," a mindless
institute with a library open to all,
a last-ditch-stand political target.
This is not the case.
Since 1959, when Glen
Campbell was appointed director
of the Institute, to carry out the
resolution to "protect the
American way of life from such
ideologies (communism and
socialism)," Hoover has developed
from a library to an active
propaganda machine. With a
budget of nearly 2 million dollars,
a quarter or more of which comes
directly from Stanford, Hoover
has sponsored right-wing
conferences and lent legitimacy to

war criminals and government
spokesmen on this campus.
Last January, Hoover brought
Henry Cabot Lodge to campus,
and succeeded in bringing charges
against Franklin when he helped
expose the "free speech" issue by
revealing the degree to which
Lodge's opposition is forced to
remain silent.
Last October, the Iranian
Student Association attacked a
Hoover conference entitled "Iran:
25 Centuries of Achievement,"
condemning the conference as
part of the Shah's propaganda
machine. The students revealed
that that achievement has actually
been the consolidation of a regime
characterized by terror and
repression, "economically,
politically and militarily
dependent on United States
imperialism."
In June of this year, Hoover
will co-sponsor a conference on
"China," the first half was held a
year ago on Taiwan, from which
the press was barred and which
was attended by right wing
professors from the United States,
some of whom themselves
criticized the conference as being
right wing propaganda.
Publications and conferences
alone don't indicate the degree of
influence Hoover has. Hoover's
"scholars" and directors are
influential on every level of

American government (including
Glen Campbell's connections with
the Republican party consolidated
when he worked for Goldwater's
presidential campaign.)
Hoover's most recent nominees
to the Board of Overseers
ominously underscore Hoover's
connections with government and
big business, and bring Hoover's
involvement in the imperialist
machine full circle, directly into
the spotlight of Franklin's case.
This will be a prime focus of the
confrontation planned for Hoover
this noon.
First we have the Lodge
incident, where a war criminal is
brought to this campus under the
aegis of Hoover. Then follow the
charges against Franklin and the
hearing. The week the Advisory
board recommends that Franklin
be fired, David Packard, former
deputy secretary of defense
donates $2.6 to Stanford.
Rehnquist is appointed to the
Supreme Court as Franklin's case
moves into the public legal area.
The connections can hardly be
coincidental. Join us today at
noon in front of Hoover tower.
