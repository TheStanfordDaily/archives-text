New Quality
Editor, THE DAILY:
Among the wounds suffered by
Stanford during the past few years
has been a drastic decline in the
style and quality of public
discourse.
The air, and the pages of the
Daily, have resounded with
vulgarity, epithet, insult. Violence
has been justified, sensation
glorified, principle abused, reason
disparaged, civility ridiculed.
Wrapped in the cloak of moral
outrage, many have spoken,

written, and acted outrageously.
Impatient of rational discussion,
they have felt no obligation to
exercise that minimum of
intellectual responsibility (and
honesty) that might be expected
in a university.
The Advisory Board Report
may be more important for its
style and quality than for the
substance of its recommendation
that Professor Franklin be
discharged. The document is civil,
reasonable, principled. Its authors
have taken the trouble to examine
the evidence and the arguments

and to deal carefully,
considerately, and thoughtfully
with them.
The contrast with the prevailing
dialectic is obvious and welcome.
To illustrate that contrast, one
need merely compare passages of
the Report with most of what he
has heard in White Plaza and read
on pages two and three of the
Daily over the past several years.
Reasonable men may disagree
about whether or not Professor
Franklin should be fired. The
lasting value of the Advisory
Board Report is that it moves the
discussion of that and other
public questions at Stanford to a
respectable level.

President Lyman:
Please permit me a few
moments of your time to read
another letter pertaining to the
fine achievements of the athletic
team and bandsmen who
represented Stanford University in
the Rose Bowl.
I write this letter especially to
let you know how impressed I was
(and am) with your band. It was a
most refreshing sight to observe at
least one band (out of hundreds
on T.V. this past weekend)
obviously enjoying itself and
having a grand time making music
together.

I first saw your fine group last
year and looked forward to seeing
it again this year. I was
particularly impressed by the fact
that the band marches and
performs with at least one
member in a wheel chair. I know
of no other university band
program in the country who had a
director who would even consider
such a thing ..."You are indeed
fortunate to have such a person
on your faculty.
Again, my hat is off to your
fine group of young people who
in the long run, make it all
possible. A.E. Harwood,
Tallahassee, Florida
New Line
Editor, THE DAILY:
I just wanted to commend you
and the Edit Board on the
editorial policy of the Daily so far
this quarter. The timid liberalism
of previous years has been
replaced by an edit line which is
both more forceful and more
realistic in view of the political
situation at Stanford, and the
greater frequency with which
editorials on significant issues
have appeared is also an
improvement. I hope the next
editor will continue to present
this more relevant and less fearful
viewpoint to the campus
community.

style and quality of public
discourse.
The air, and the pages of the
Daily, have resounded with
vulgarity, epithet, insult. Violence
has been justified, sensation
glorified, principle abused, reason
disparaged, civility ridiculed.
Wrapped in the cloak of moral
outrage, many have spoken,

written, and acted outrageously.
Impatient of rational discussion,
they have felt no obligation to
exercise that minimum of
intellectual responsibility (and
honesty) that might be expected
in a university.
The Advisory Board Report
may be more important for its
style and quality than for the
substance of its recommendation
that Professor Franklin be
discharged. The document is civil,
reasonable, principled. Its authors
have taken the trouble to examine
the evidence and the arguments

and to deal carefully,
considerately, and thoughtfully
with them.
The contrast with the prevailing
dialectic is obvious and welcome.
To illustrate that contrast, one
need merely compare passages of
the Report with most of what he
has heard in White Plaza and read
on pages two and three of the
Daily over the past several years.
Reasonable men may disagree
about whether or not Professor
Franklin should be fired. The
lasting value of the Advisory
Board Report is that it moves the
discussion of that and other
public questions at Stanford to a
respectable level.

President Lyman:
Please permit me a few
moments of your time to read
another letter pertaining to the
fine achievements of the athletic
team and bandsmen who
represented Stanford University in
the Rose Bowl.
I write this letter especially to
let you know how impressed I was
(and am) with your band. It was a
most refreshing sight to observe at
least one band (out of hundreds
on T.V. this past weekend)
obviously enjoying itself and
having a grand time making music
together.

I first saw your fine group last
year and looked forward to seeing
it again this year. I was
particularly impressed by the fact
that the band marches and
performs with at least one
member in a wheel chair. I know
of no other university band
program in the country who had a
director who would even consider
such a thing ..."You are indeed
fortunate to have such a person
on your faculty.
Again, my hat is off to your
fine group of young people who
in the long run, make it all
possible. A.E. Harwood,
Tallahassee, Florida
New Line
Editor, THE DAILY:
I just wanted to commend you
and the Edit Board on the
editorial policy of the Daily so far
this quarter. The timid liberalism
of previous years has been
replaced by an edit line which is
both more forceful and more
realistic in view of the political
situation at Stanford, and the
greater frequency with which
editorials on significant issues
have appeared is also an
improvement. I hope the next
editor will continue to present
this more relevant and less fearful
viewpoint to the campus
community.
