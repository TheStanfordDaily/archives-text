# Fire Destroys Manzanita Office
## 
### DAN BRENNER 
A fire blamed on arson caused
$35,000 to $40,000 damage early
yesterday at the Manzanita Park
trailers office. The blaze, which gutted
a lounge, washing and vending
machines, and the director's office,
broke out shortly after 2:00 a.m.
Assistant Chief John Barr and
Harold Stalker of the Santa Clara
County Fire Marshall's office declared
that it was "a set fire" after
investigating yesterday. Stalker said
the fire apparently began at the mail
drop in the door to the building.
Campus Fire Chief Frank Jurian
said the blaze might have started in the
lounge area. The Fire Marshall's Office
plans to rope off the area and conduct
an intensive investigation.
The green panel walls of the
burnt-out structure still smelled of
the fiery blaze yesterday afternoon.

Singed shrubs and ash-filled puddles
surrounded the building. "KEEP
OUT" signs were tacked to the
remaining support beams of the office.
Dirty Laundry
One student who carried his
laundry bag over to the facility, now
containing only remnants of washing
and drying machines, stared at the
building's skeleton. "Is the laundry
machine wrecked too?" he asked.
Realizing that it was, he sighed, "It's
amazing."
Reactions from students in trailers
surrounding the office ranged from
surprise to fear. Three of the four
residents of trailer 2X, whose back
wall is a few yards from the office, had
been in Junipero last year when an
arson fire swept through its lounge.
Last year's fire was worse, Ellen
Alston, a 2X resident noted. "It didn't
particularly scare me. But I wished
they'd stop following me around."
Safe Exits?
Emma Brown, another resident of
2X, expressed apprehensions about
safe exit should the fire have spread.
Noting that the bedrooms are
clustered towards one end of the

trailer she said, "There's no way you
could get out," should a fire erupt in
the living room, and the small
bedroom windows become
inaccessable.
Anna Lange, a tenant of 10X who
also happened to be a resident of
Junipero last year, thought that it was
"really frightening" to be that close to
the fire.
"If one of the trailers caught on
fire ... we were joking about how the
trailer would melt down."
Another resident of a trailer
adjacent to the cite of the blaze said,
"It could have been dangerous if there
had been a wind."
But according to Chief Barr, the
all-aluminum trailers meet State Codes
for fire safety. He felt that they are no
more dangerous than other family
dwellings, "except that maybe the
windows are a little bit smaller."
No Safety Demonstrations
Unlike the high rise buildings or
dormitories, however, there are no fire
safety demonstrations given to
residents unless requested. Also,
because the trailers are private
residences, the Stanford Fire

Department has not been allowed to
make periodic safety checks of the
rooms.
Barr adds that the carpets and
drapes, standard features in the
trailers, are not fire resistent. Added to
these accoutrements is a low grill over
the stove which requires cleaning of
cooking greases.
Moreover, many of the panel walls
of the structures are decorated with
flags, posters, and painted cloth.
'Adequate Windows'
Escondido Village manager Ned
Gallager noted that the windows in the
bedrooms, while not comfortable, "are
adequate for persons to get through."
He also noted that the carpets were
somewhat fire retardant and that
because the trailers are all-aluminum
on the outside, the possibility of
flames jumping from roof to roof are
remote.
The Manzanita Park office has been
transferred to Wilbur Hall and has the
same University telephone extensions.
No date for re-opening of the
Manzanita facility has been set, but
Gallager notes that planning is already
underway.

arson fire swept through its lounge.
Last year's fire was worse, Ellen
Alston, a 2X resident noted. "It didn't
particularly scare me. But I wished
they'd stop following me around."
Safe Exits?
Emma Brown, another resident of
2X, expressed apprehensions about
safe exit should the fire have spread.
Noting that the bedrooms are
clustered towards one end of the

trailer she said, "There's no way you
could get out," should a fire erupt in
the living room, and the small
bedroom windows become
inaccessable.
Anna Lange, a tenant of 10X who
also happened to be a resident of
Junipero last year, thought that it was
"really frightening" to be that close to
the fire.
"If one of the trailers caught on
fire ... we were joking about how the
trailer would melt down."
Another resident of a trailer
adjacent to the cite of the blaze said,
"It could have been dangerous if there
had been a wind."
But according to Chief Barr, the
all-aluminum trailers meet State Codes
for fire safety. He felt that they are no
more dangerous than other family
dwellings, "except that maybe the
windows are a little bit smaller."
No Safety Demonstrations
Unlike the high rise buildings or
dormitories, however, there are no fire
safety demonstrations given to
residents unless requested. Also,
because the trailers are private
residences, the Stanford Fire

Department has not been allowed to
make periodic safety checks of the
rooms.
Barr adds that the carpets and
drapes, standard features in the
trailers, are not fire resistent. Added to
these accoutrements is a low grill over
the stove which requires cleaning of
cooking greases.
Moreover, many of the panel walls
of the structures are decorated with
flags, posters, and painted cloth.
'Adequate Windows'
Escondido Village manager Ned
Gallager noted that the windows in the
bedrooms, while not comfortable, "are
adequate for persons to get through."
He also noted that the carpets were
somewhat fire retardant and that
because the trailers are all-aluminum
on the outside, the possibility of
flames jumping from roof to roof are
remote.
The Manzanita Park office has been
transferred to Wilbur Hall and has the
same University telephone extensions.
No date for re-opening of the
Manzanita facility has been set, but
Gallager notes that planning is already
underway.

IN THE HEAT OF THE NlGHT—Yesterday morning, sometime after 2:00 a.m., the Manzanita Park trailers office
caught fire and the building was gutted, destroying vending machines, laundry machines, the lounge and director's office.
The damage was estimated to be between $35,000 and $40,000. The fire apparently began at the mail drop in the door
to the office.
A fire blamed on arson caused
$35,000 to $40,000 damage early
yesterday at the Manzanita Park
trailers office. The blaze, which gutted
a lounge, washing and vending
machines, and the director's office,
broke out shortly after 2:00 a.m.
Assistant Chief John Barr and
Harold Stalker of the Santa Clara
County Fire Marshall's office declared
that it was "a set fire" after
investigating yesterday. Stalker said
the fire apparently began at the mail
drop in the door to the building.
Campus Fire Chief Frank Jurian
said the blaze might have started in the
lounge area. The Fire Marshall's Office
plans to rope off the area and conduct
an intensive investigation.
The green panel walls of the
burnt-out structure still smelled of
the fiery blaze yesterday afternoon.

Singed shrubs and ash-filled puddles
surrounded the building. "KEEP
OUT" signs were tacked to the
remaining support beams of the office.
Dirty Laundry
One student who carried his
laundry bag over to the facility, now
containing only remnants of washing
and drying machines, stared at the
building's skeleton. "Is the laundry
machine wrecked too?" he asked.
Realizing that it was, he sighed, "It's
amazing."
Reactions from students in trailers
surrounding the office ranged from
surprise to fear. Three of the four
residents of trailer 2X, whose back
wall is a few yards from the office, had
been in Junipero last year when an
arson fire swept through its lounge.

Alston, a 2X resident noted. "It didn't
