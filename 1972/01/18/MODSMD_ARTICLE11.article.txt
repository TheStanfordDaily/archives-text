# Dance Theatre Of Harlem
## Very Impressive Dance Show 
### CHRISTINE DOUGLAS 
In their performance last
Thursday evening at Memorial
Auditorium, Arthur Mitchell's
Dance Theatre of Harlem fully
lived up to the excellent
reputation it has earned since it
began three short years ago.
Their first dance, "Fete Noire,"
is a ballet choreographed by
Mitchell himself. Its great
rhythmical and dynamic variety
gives the dance an originality
lacking in most ballet
choreography. In the first
movement, instead of carrying the
women dancers predictably
through the air as in most ballet,
the male dancers pulled their
women partners across the floor
in long smooth movements. The
dancers moved their hands and
feet with unerring precision and
delicacy.
In the third movement of the
dance, Mitchell combines a jazz
rhythm with classical ballet style.
He also ruptures the typical
male-female juxtaposition of most
ballet by creating a dance of three
women and one man. The
unbalanced counterpoint of male
and female movement supported
by the rest of the company
provided an element of intrinsic
building excitement which gave
the dance its greatest strength.
Superb Execution
Their second dance, "The
Beloved," was performed as a
duet by Gayle McKinney and
Walter Raines in movements
which combined the technique of
Doris Humphrey with that of
Martha Graham. Their execution
of the movement material was
superb, but my objections lie in
the arrangement of the
choreography itself. Although the
movements are interesting in
themselves, they lost their initial
impact through constant
repetition. Repetition was

successful only in the beginning
and the end.
The movement was
simultaneously simple and
powerful in its portrayal of the
shameful suppression of black
women. Husband and wife sit side
by side in two chairs. The
husband outstretches his hand and
the woman, after much hesitation,
grabs hold of it. When she does
finally grab hold of his hand, her
husband brutally swings her into
submission at his feet. This
gesture was so striking that the
audience was suspended between
nervous laughter and stunned
silence.
"Agon," their third dance, was
the most debatable of the four
dances, for it had a broad range of
strengths and weaknesses. I realize
that Balanchine intended to do
away with the superfluous aspects
of traditional ballet, but the bare
scenery and the Spartan simplicity
of costume left a noticeable gap in
the fullness of the dance.
However, this deficiency was
temporarily obscured when Derek
Williams and the skilled nineteen
year old Lydia Abarca danced a
duet in which Abarca displayed
outstanding technical brilliance.
She received the loudest applause
of any of the company's lead
dancers.
Almost Flawless
"Rhythmetron" was the most
successful dance of the
performance. In it, Mitchell
recreates the movement and
mystery of ancient tribal ritual.
His choreography is almost
flawless throughout, for he

maintains a perfect balance
between clarity and elusiveness,
emphasis and understatement, and
stability and frenetic movement.
He also provides the audience
with a constant essential element
of surprise.
At several points, the dancers
hit breathtakingly strong diagonal
positions. At one point, the men
carry the women above their
shoulders in such a way that the
women seem crucified. At another
point, the women run into the
waiting arms of their male
partners and upon reaching the
men, they suddenly crumble in a
lifeless heap in their arms. My
only reservation about this dance
was the solo performed by the
"Priestess." Towards the end of
the dance, she suddenly breaks
into a violent combination of
contractions and releases. The
movement seems too uncontained

in comparison with the inner
tension of the rest of the dance.
The standing ovation at the end
of the performance proved
Mitchell's ability to bring dance
alive for a generation which seems
to have lost touch with the beauty
of human movement. As I left the
lobby, I heard a boy say, "to Hell
with school, I'm going to dance."

in long smooth movements. The
dancers moved their hands and
feet with unerring precision and
delicacy.
In the third movement of the
dance, Mitchell combines a jazz
rhythm with classical ballet style.
He also ruptures the typical
male-female juxtaposition of most
ballet by creating a dance of three
women and one man. The
unbalanced counterpoint of male
and female movement supported
by the rest of the company
provided an element of intrinsic
building excitement which gave
the dance its greatest strength.
Superb Execution
Their second dance, "The
Beloved," was performed as a
duet by Gayle McKinney and
Walter Raines in movements
which combined the technique of
Doris Humphrey with that of
Martha Graham. Their execution
of the movement material was
superb, but my objections lie in
the arrangement of the
choreography itself. Although the
movements are interesting in
themselves, they lost their initial
impact through constant
repetition. Repetition was

successful only in the beginning
and the end.
The movement was
simultaneously simple and
powerful in its portrayal of the
shameful suppression of black
women. Husband and wife sit side
by side in two chairs. The
husband outstretches his hand and
the woman, after much hesitation,
grabs hold of it. When she does
finally grab hold of his hand, her
husband brutally swings her into
submission at his feet. This
gesture was so striking that the
audience was suspended between
nervous laughter and stunned
silence.
"Agon," their third dance, was
the most debatable of the four
dances, for it had a broad range of
strengths and weaknesses. I realize
that Balanchine intended to do
away with the superfluous aspects
of traditional ballet, but the bare
scenery and the Spartan simplicity
of costume left a noticeable gap in
the fullness of the dance.
However, this deficiency was
temporarily obscured when Derek
Williams and the skilled nineteen
year old Lydia Abarca danced a
duet in which Abarca displayed
outstanding technical brilliance.
She received the loudest applause
of any of the company's lead
dancers.
Almost Flawless
"Rhythmetron" was the most
successful dance of the
performance. In it, Mitchell
recreates the movement and
mystery of ancient tribal ritual.
His choreography is almost
flawless throughout, for he

maintains a perfect balance
between clarity and elusiveness,
emphasis and understatement, and
stability and frenetic movement.
He also provides the audience
with a constant essential element
of surprise.
At several points, the dancers
hit breathtakingly strong diagonal
positions. At one point, the men
carry the women above their
shoulders in such a way that the
women seem crucified. At another
point, the women run into the
waiting arms of their male
partners and upon reaching the
men, they suddenly crumble in a
lifeless heap in their arms. My
only reservation about this dance
was the solo performed by the
"Priestess." Towards the end of
the dance, she suddenly breaks
into a violent combination of
contractions and releases. The
movement seems too uncontained

in comparison with the inner
tension of the rest of the dance.
The standing ovation at the end
of the performance proved
Mitchell's ability to bring dance
alive for a generation which seems
to have lost touch with the beauty
of human movement. As I left the
lobby, I heard a boy say, "to Hell
with school, I'm going to dance."
In their performance last
Thursday evening at Memorial
Auditorium, Arthur Mitchell's
Dance Theatre of Harlem fully
lived up to the excellent
reputation it has earned since it
began three short years ago.
Their first dance, "Fete Noire,"
is a ballet choreographed by
Mitchell himself. Its great
rhythmical and dynamic variety
gives the dance an originality
lacking in most ballet
choreography. In the first
movement, instead of carrying the
women dancers predictably
through the air as in most ballet,
the male dancers pulled their
women partners across the floor
in long smooth movements. The
dancers moved their hands and
feet with unerring precision and
delicacy.
In the third movement of the
