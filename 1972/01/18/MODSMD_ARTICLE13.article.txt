# Minorities To Study School Of Education
## 
### 
Two new educational task forces, one Black,
one Chicano, have been established by Dean
Arthur Coladarci of the School of Education to
determine how the school can function more
effectively in minority education.
Two two committees have been asked to study
and report to the dean their recommendations on
how the school may provide more effective
graduate education for minority people who plan
careers in teaching, school administration or
educational research.
Dean Coladarci called the appointments "among
the most important" he has made since becoming
dean last year.
"My impression is that no professional school
has given serious and considered thought to the
question of its effective function with racial and
ethnic minorities in this country," he said.
"The results of our groups' thinking will be
valuable not only to the School of Education, but
to the University at large and other institutions."
The Chicano group has five students and five
faculty members, while the Black has six students
and six faculty or staff members.
Chairman of the "Chicano Concern" group is
Arthur Pacheco, acting assistant professor of

education. Students are Jim Lujan, Kicardo J
Martinex, Ramon Quezada, Maria Sofia Robledo, (
and Concepcion Valdez-Love. Faculty include
Richard Mesa, instructor; Robert Politzer,
professor of education and Romance languages;
Renato Rosaldo Jr., assistant professor of
anthropology; and Fannie Shaftel, professor of
education.
Heading the "Black Concern" group is graduate
student Robert Newby. Other student members
are Anne Bouie, Dwight Brown, Debbie Daniels,
Mary Hoover, and Ronald Lewis. Faculty-staff
members include John Bock, assistant professor of
education; Preston Dent, assistant to the provost;
St. Clair Drake, professor of anthropology and
sociology; Henry P. Organ, associate general
secretary; Thomas Rhue, assistant dean of graduate
studies; and Professor Shaftel, who serves on both
committees.
The two groups, the dean said, are expected to
work together in areas of common concern.
Coladarci expressed the hope that the two task
forces could have reports, recommendations and
supporting facts in his hands by the end of Winter
Quarter, March 17, but he said, "I want them to
take all the time they need, rather than set a firm
deadline."
