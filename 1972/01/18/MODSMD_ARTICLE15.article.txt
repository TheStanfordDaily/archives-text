# Terry Aims For The Pros
## 
### BILL CLASTER 
Demonstrating the usual
amount of optimism that is so
characteristic of the Athletic
Publicity Department, Stanford's
1972 basketball press guide notes
that Claude Terry is "sure to be a
Number One choice of the pros
this year," and that he is a
"bonafide All-American
candidate."
Whether or not Claude Terry
will live up to these rather bold
predictions is questionable.
Nevertheless, he is undeniably one
of the premier college players in
America today.
Terry, a senior from Salida
(near Modesto), has truly had a
remarkable career at Stanford. He
holds the single season scoring
mark with 544 points for a 20.9
average. With 12 games to play
this season, he is only 100 points
shy of Tom Dose's 4 year
Stanford record (includes
Freshman points) of 1744 points,
and he is 151 points away from
Dose's varsity record of 1444
points.
His 41 points against Oregon
State last year gave him the Maples
Pavilion single game scoring mark.
Terry has been unbelievably
consistent throughout his career,
as he has always managed to shoot
around 47% from the field, 75%
from the free throw line and
average around 20 points per
game.
He had continued his pace this
season. After a slow start due to a
pelvis injury, Terry is now
averaging 19.6 a game overall and
21.9 in the Pac-8.
Still Improving
Despite his abilities, Terry and
his coaches feel that he is still
improving. Terry notes, "I've been
working on my driving a lot and
I'm beginning to get more points
off my drives." Assistant Coach
Bub Bowling adds, "Claude has
improved on his defense because
he works so hard at it. He
concentrates on it with great
intensity, and it is certainly not a
problem for him."
Terry's entire game seems to be
suited to the pros. He is a
fabulous, if unorthodox, outside
shooter whose range extends to at
least 30 feet. He is superb passer,
a flashy dribbler and a very
adequate defender. He is 6'6" and
he rebounds well. Coach Howie
Dallmar says, "A guard with his
height, his range and his desire is
sure to be one to excel in the
pros."
His only noticeable weakness is
his quickness, which is rated as
just being average. Coach
Bowling feels, "From a pro point
of view, Terry will be jurt because
he is not exceptionally quick.
However, his height should
compensate for that."
Pro Bound
Terrv makes no bones about

his future. "I will definitely play
basketball next year. If I do not
play in the pros, then I'll probably
play somewhere in Europe. I'll
probably try out for the Olympic
team if I'm invited. Yet even if I
make the team I'm not sure I'll
play. There are many factors that
I'll have to consider."
What Terry will have to
consider is his pro contract and
what pro team drafts him. The
pros are his number one goal, and
he knows he must gear his plans
towards them.
What if he doesn't make the
pros and plays in Europe for a
year? "After that I'll probably go
to business school and get my
degree," says Terry, and
Economics major.
Claude Terry's style of play is
very much his own. He shoots his
jump shot with a side-spin on it,
dribbles behind his back almost
regularly and shoots his free
throws jump-shot style. "The

reason I shoot with a side-spin on
my shot goes back to when I was
little and not strong enough to
shoot a jump shot with a normal
spin on it. My wrists were too weak
to spin it backwards, so 1 had to
spin the ball sideways."
Unorthodox Style
Terry adds, "I started to shoot
my free-throw jump-shot style in
order to gain more overall
strength. My high school coach
felt that by constanly shooting
my jumper during all games and
practices I would be stronger at
the end of a game. The reason I'm
shooting poorly from the line now
(67%) is because I'm falling away
a bit and have not really found
my groove."
Terry has never played on a
Stanford varsity team that has
won more than six games in a
season. He does not regret playing
for the Indians despite the fact
that the team's poor showing has
definitely affected him. Terry has

played on a losing team, and he
has suffered the consequences of
it.
Claude has never been named
all Pac-8 first team, and he will
probably not be named to it this
year. This is due in part to guards
Henry Bibby, Paul Westphal and
Freddie Boyd, but also in part to
the fact that Terry plays on a
weaker team than these three
guards. As Coach Dallmar puts it,
"The team record has a big effect
on all-league standing."
Captain and Leader
The captain of the Indians is
then not really a likely
All-American. From the point of
view of ability, he is however the
equal of many Ail-Americans. His
lack of recognition stems from the
fact that he has played for a loser,
arid because he refuses to try to
build personal scoring records at
the expense of the team's success,
limited as it may be. He is an
unselfish 6'6" guard who is the
picture of consistency. Claude
Terry may not be a number one
pro draft choice, but he should be
picked highly. That is all the
recognition that he wants.

Houston defender earlier this season. Clearly the most outstanding
Indian basketball player in many years, Terry has high hopes of
competing in the professional ranks.
