Three very important sports stories emerged from the mass of
weekend game reports that typically populate Monday's sports page.
The Pacific-8 voted to allow freshmen participation in varsity football
and basketball, Stanford delayed the announcement of the new
football coach and set up a credentials committee, and the Los
Angeles Herald-Examiner claimed that Cal coach Ray Willsey would
be fired soon.
All of these stories have direct bearing on Stanford's football
program, and when the newsmakers involved returned to their desks
yesterday, they had some very interesting reactions.
Cal sports information director, Bob Steiner, tersely stated that the
University had "no comment" on the Herald-Examiner story
described in Monday's Daily. Before I could ask him anything else,
Steiner said that Willsey had ". . . no statement to make," and closed
off the conversation. Although Willsey did not resign yesterday as
predicted, clearly something is going on at Cal and a major coaching
change should transpire soon. Mike White's name will figure highly in
Berkeley's coaching search.
At the Farm, the coaching selection process is being drawn out and
acting athletic director Bob Young is getting impatient. "I am pushing
for a decision as soon as possible," emphasized Young. "We hope to
have a recommendation before the end of the week.
Young and faculty representative John Harbaugh dissented in the
5-3 vote allowing freshmen to compete in all varsity sports at a special
Pac-8 meeting Sunday in Burlingame. Young explained that, "We
voted against the measure purely on principle. If it had gone past one
ballot, we would have regarded the practical considerations of the
issue and voted in favor of it. I personally feel, however, that it is a
very bad rule."
