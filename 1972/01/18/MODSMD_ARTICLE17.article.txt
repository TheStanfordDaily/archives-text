Kennedy Leaves Primary
FLORIDA — Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy of Massachusetts removed his
name yesterday from the ballot for
Florida's presidential primary, saying
"without qualification that I am not
now and do not presently intend to
become a candidate for president at
the upcoming nominating
convention."
Kennedy was one of the 12
Democrats listed by Florida Secretary
of State Richard Stone for the March
14 primary. Kennedy said at the time
of Stone's announcement that he
would file an affidavit removing his
name from the ballot.
Longshoremen On Strike
SAN FRANCISCO - West Coast
longshoremen went back on strike
yesterday morning on the order of
Harry Bridges, their 70-year-old leader
who acted in the face of threatened
federal intervention.
Pickets started marching again in
the Pacific Coast ports closed down
last year in a 100-day strike halted last
Oct. 6 by a Taft-Hartley injunction.
Marathon weekend negotiations
with J. Curtis Counts, chief federal
mediator taking part, broke off at the
8 a.m. strike deadline hour.
The break came on basic issues of
cargo container handling and a work
guarantee for 13,000 West Coast
dockers.
Bridges and officials of the
employers' Pacific Maritime

Association (PMA) said the talks
would resume. No time was
announced. The resumption could
come on request by either side or
Counts.
Most strikers talked freely but
refused to give their names, saying the
union had ordered them not to talk
with newsmen.
"None of these strikes are any
good," said a burly dockworker who
said he'd been an ILWU member for
43 years. "You don't make money
when you're out."
Year Of The Rat
SACRAMENTO - The Assembly
adopted a resolution yesterday
offering Californians of Chinese
ancestry good wishes for the Chinese
New Year, but only after the author
assured a Republican that the wishes
didn't extend as far as Peking.
"Is this for the American Chinese
or the Peking Chinese?" asked
Assemblyman John L.E. Collier, R-Los
Angeles, in the drawl of his native
Alabama.
Assemblyman John L. Burton,
D-San Francisco, whose district
includes Chinatown, replied, "This
applies only to Americans of Chinese
origin but if the President received a
copy of this and would take it over to
Mao Tse Tsung in Peking, I couldn't
stop him."
In reply to another question,
Burton told how the Year of the Rat is
the first in the sequence of 12
symbolic animals of the lunar calendar
year.

The story, as related in the
resolution, goes this way:
"When Buddha summoned all the
animals of the world, the rat and the
ox were the first to arrive at the moat
surrounding heaven. The rat gained the
advantage by stealing a ride across on
the ox's back and then leaping through
the gates while the ox clambered
ashore."
The resolution, HR 6, was adopted
46-0.
Court To Hear Death
Penalty, Desegragation
WASHINGTON - The evolving
national conscience must govern the
meaning of the Eighth Amendment in
condemning capital punishment,
lawyers contended yesterday in asking
the Supreme Court to declare the
death penalty unconstitutional.
"The death penalty is virtually
unanimously repudiated by the
conscience of contemporary society,"
argued Stanford University law
professor Anthony G. Amsterdam.
A ruling on the issue is expected
before the court term ends in June. It
will directly affect nearly 700
condemned men and women on death
rows in 34 states.
The Supreme Court also set the
stage yesterday for its first full-scale
inquiry into school segregation outside
the South.
Acting on an appeal by the NAACP
Legal Defense and Educational Fund,
the court announced it would look at
the school situation in Denver, a large

city with sizable black and
Spanish-speaking minorities.
Lower federal courts have granted
the two minority groups some
desegregation action, but the fund,
speaking for them, contends it is not
enough. They want about a dozen
more of the city's 117 public schools
deeply integrated.
Pakistan Offer Made
PAKISTAN — Pakistani President
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto said yesterday he
would make Sheik Mujibur Rahman
"president, prime minister or whatever
he wants" to bring Bangladesh back
and "preserve Pakistan's oneness."
The Pakistan radio said Bhutto
made the offer in a speech at Quetta,
an industrial city 370 miles north of
Karachi.
Radio Pakistan quoted Bhutto as
saying his proposal to hand over
Pakistan's top job to Mujib "is a
sincere offer ... in the hope that it
will be accepted in the same spirit in
which it was issued."

Year Of The Rat
SACRAMENTO - The Assembly
adopted a resolution yesterday
offering Californians of Chinese
ancestry good wishes for the Chinese
New Year, but only after the author
assured a Republican that the wishes
didn't extend as far as Peking.
"Is this for the American Chinese
or the Peking Chinese?" asked
Assemblyman John L.E. Collier, R-Los
Angeles, in the drawl of his native
Alabama.
Assemblyman John L. Burton,
D-San Francisco, whose district
includes Chinatown, replied, "This
applies only to Americans of Chinese
origin but if the President received a
copy of this and would take it over to
Mao Tse Tsung in Peking, I couldn't
stop him."
In reply to another question,
Burton told how the Year of the Rat is
the first in the sequence of 12
symbolic animals of the lunar calendar
year.

The story, as related in the
resolution, goes this way:
"When Buddha summoned all the
animals of the world, the rat and the
ox were the first to arrive at the moat
surrounding heaven. The rat gained the
advantage by stealing a ride across on
the ox's back and then leaping through
the gates while the ox clambered
ashore."
The resolution, HR 6, was adopted
46-0.
Court To Hear Death
Penalty, Desegragation
WASHINGTON - The evolving
national conscience must govern the
meaning of the Eighth Amendment in
condemning capital punishment,
lawyers contended yesterday in asking
the Supreme Court to declare the
death penalty unconstitutional.
"The death penalty is virtually
unanimously repudiated by the
conscience of contemporary society,"
argued Stanford University law
professor Anthony G. Amsterdam.
A ruling on the issue is expected
before the court term ends in June. It
will directly affect nearly 700
condemned men and women on death
rows in 34 states.
The Supreme Court also set the
stage yesterday for its first full-scale
inquiry into school segregation outside
the South.
Acting on an appeal by the NAACP
Legal Defense and Educational Fund,
the court announced it would look at
the school situation in Denver, a large

city with sizable black and
Spanish-speaking minorities.
Lower federal courts have granted
the two minority groups some
desegregation action, but the fund,
speaking for them, contends it is not
enough. They want about a dozen
more of the city's 117 public schools
deeply integrated.
Pakistan Offer Made
PAKISTAN — Pakistani President
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto said yesterday he
would make Sheik Mujibur Rahman
"president, prime minister or whatever
he wants" to bring Bangladesh back
and "preserve Pakistan's oneness."
The Pakistan radio said Bhutto
made the offer in a speech at Quetta,
an industrial city 370 miles north of
Karachi.
Radio Pakistan quoted Bhutto as
saying his proposal to hand over
Pakistan's top job to Mujib "is a
sincere offer ... in the hope that it
will be accepted in the same spirit in
which it was issued."

Kennedy Leaves Primary
FLORIDA — Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy of Massachusetts removed his
name yesterday from the ballot for
Florida's presidential primary, saying
"without qualification that I am not
now and do not presently intend to
become a candidate for president at
the upcoming nominating
convention."

14 primary. Kennedy said at the time

Longshoremen On Strike
SAN FRANCISCO - West Coast
longshoremen went back on strike
yesterday morning on the order of
Harry Bridges, their 70-year-old leader
who acted in the face of threatened
federal intervention.
Pickets started marching again in
the Pacific Coast ports closed down
last year in a 100-day strike halted last
Oct. 6 by a Taft-Hartley injunction.
Marathon weekend negotiations
with J. Curtis Counts, chief federal
mediator taking part, broke off at the
8 a.m. strike deadline hour.
The break came on basic issues of
cargo container handling and a work
guarantee for 13,000 West Coast
dockers.
Bridges and officials of the
employers' Pacific Maritime

Association (PMA) said the talks
would resume. No time was
announced. The resumption could
come on request by either side or
Counts.
Most strikers talked freely but
refused to give their names, saying the
union had ordered them not to talk
with newsmen.
"None of these strikes are any
good," said a burly dockworker who
said he'd been an ILWU member for
43 years. "You don't make money
when you're out."

A ruling on the issue is expected
before the court term ends in June. It
will directly affect nearly 700
condemned men and women on death
rows in 34 states.
The Supreme Court also set the
stage yesterday for its first full-scale
inquiry into school segregation outside
the South.
Acting on an appeal by the NAACP
Legal Defense and Educational Fund,
the court announced it would look at
the school situation in Denver, a large

city with sizable black and
Spanish-speaking minorities.
Lower federal courts have granted
the two minority groups some
desegregation action, but the fund,
speaking for them, contends it is not
enough. They want about a dozen
more of the city's 117 public schools
deeply integrated.
Pakistan Offer Made
PAKISTAN — Pakistani President
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto said yesterday he
would make Sheik Mujibur Rahman
"president, prime minister or whatever
he wants" to bring Bangladesh back
and "preserve Pakistan's oneness."
The Pakistan radio said Bhutto
made the offer in a speech at Quetta,
an industrial city 370 miles north of
Karachi.
Radio Pakistan quoted Bhutto as
saying his proposal to hand over
Pakistan's top job to Mujib "is a
sincere offer ... in the hope that it
will be accepted in the same spirit in
which it was issued."

Kennedy Leaves Primary
FLORIDA — Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy of Massachusetts removed his
name yesterday from the ballot for
Florida's presidential primary, saying
"without qualification that I am not
now and do not presently intend to
become a candidate for president at
the upcoming nominating
convention."
Kennedy was one of the 12
Democrats listed by Florida Secretary
of State Richard Stone for the March
14 primary. Kennedy said at the time
of Stone's announcement that he

Longshoremen On Strike
SAN FRANCISCO - West Coast
longshoremen went back on strike
yesterday morning on the order of
Harry Bridges, their 70-year-old leader
who acted in the face of threatened
federal intervention.
Pickets started marching again in
the Pacific Coast ports closed down
last year in a 100-day strike halted last
Oct. 6 by a Taft-Hartley injunction.
Marathon weekend negotiations
with J. Curtis Counts, chief federal
mediator taking part, broke off at the
8 a.m. strike deadline hour.
The break came on basic issues of
cargo container handling and a work
guarantee for 13,000 West Coast
dockers.
Bridges and officials of the
employers' Pacific Maritime

Association (PMA) said the talks
would resume. No time was
announced. The resumption could
come on request by either side or
Counts.
Most strikers talked freely but
refused to give their names, saying the
union had ordered them not to talk
with newsmen.
"None of these strikes are any
good," said a burly dockworker who
said he'd been an ILWU member for
43 years. "You don't make money
when you're out."
Year Of The Rat
SACRAMENTO - The Assembly
adopted a resolution yesterday
offering Californians of Chinese
ancestry good wishes for the Chinese
New Year, but only after the author
assured a Republican that the wishes
didn't extend as far as Peking.
"Is this for the American Chinese
or the Peking Chinese?" asked
Assemblyman John L.E. Collier, R-Los
Angeles, in the drawl of his native
Alabama.
Assemblyman John L. Burton,
D-San Francisco, whose district
includes Chinatown, replied, "This
applies only to Americans of Chinese
origin but if the President received a
copy of this and would take it over to
Mao Tse Tsung in Peking, I couldn't
stop him."
In reply to another question,
Burton told how the Year of the Rat is
the first in the sequence of 12
symbolic animals of the lunar calendar
year.

The story, as related in the
resolution, goes this way:
"When Buddha summoned all the
animals of the world, the rat and the
ox were the first to arrive at the moat
surrounding heaven. The rat gained the
advantage by stealing a ride across on
the ox's back and then leaping through
the gates while the ox clambered
ashore."
The resolution, HR 6, was adopted
46-0.
Court To Hear Death
Penalty, Desegragation
WASHINGTON - The evolving
national conscience must govern the
meaning of the Eighth Amendment in
condemning capital punishment,
lawyers contended yesterday in asking
the Supreme Court to declare the
death penalty unconstitutional.
"The death penalty is virtually
unanimously repudiated by the
conscience of contemporary society,"
argued Stanford University law
professor Anthony G. Amsterdam.
A ruling on the issue is expected
before the court term ends in June. It
will directly affect nearly 700
condemned men and women on death
rows in 34 states.
The Supreme Court also set the
