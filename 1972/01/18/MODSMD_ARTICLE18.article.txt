# SWOPSI Stresses 'Real World'
## 
### JIM LOBSENZ (Second of two parts) 
In its three-year history, SWOPSTs courses have
changed with the interests of the students who organize
them. The first SWOPSI course list emphasized ecology
and the natural sciences.
This quarter the Stanford Workshops on Political and
Social Issues primarily has offered courses in law and
social sciences.
The SWOPSI catalog includes such diverse subjects as
"The Predominately Black College," the juvenile justice
system, a cultural study of prostitution, and"The Grand
Jury as a Watchdog Against Government Misconduct."
Actual Change
SWOPSI stresses the desire to effect actual change as a
basic, stated purpose. The program's proponents say it
allows students to combine class studies with attempts to
achieve real, physical changes in justice, health, and
political systems.
For example, a course entitled "The Housing System"
is designed to give Santa Clara County government
specific suggestions concerning public housing and
community development.
A new course on life styles will explore the feasibility
of creating an "Alternatives Center" on campus where
students could examine printed and audio-visual materials
in a search for new life styles.
A course on the Black Panther Party will study that
group's theory of "intercommunalism" and how it is put
into practice. Students in SWOP 120 will do volunteer
work with autistic and schizophrenic children at the
Peninsula Children's Center.
SWOPSI was initially organized in the summer of 1969
and began offering courses that fall. At about that time
several other colleges initiated similar programs. At
present SWOPSI is the only surviving member. Now in its
third year, the program has included over 1,000 students
in more than 100 workshops. This quarter SWOPSI is
offering 24 courses as compared to 10 offered in its first

quarter of existence.
During its first year, SWOPSI was funded by a $7,000
grant from the Ford Foundation and by $3,000 from
Stanford. In addition it received $1,500 from the
University Fellow's Innovation Fund. The program for the
academic year '70-'7l was funded by $12,000 from the
Innovation Fund. This year the University Fellows have
donated $5,668 while $17,512 has been received from the
University's General Fund (through the Office of the
Dean of Undergraduate Studies.)
Requested Budget Increase
This year SWOPSI director Dan Lewis has submitted a
request for a budget for the year 1972-1973 calling for an
increase in funds from $23,000 to $44,000. Dean of
Undergraduate Studies James Gibbs feels that this
proposed budget is likely to be cut down in some areas.
Money is spent on administrative expenses and salaries.
Presently workshop leaders serve without pay. Each
workshop is provided with a small "expense account" for
costs such as telephoning, mailings, Xeroxing, resource
materials, etc.
SWOPSI has released 12 publications to date, ranging
in price from 75c to $7.50. Three of them are specifically
concerned with the Stanford community: "Department of
Defense Research at Stanford," "Ride On: Stanford
Guide to Public Transportation," and "Privacy and
Student Records at Stanford University." Other reports
range in topic from"The Politics of Pollution Control in
Monterey Bay" to "The U.S. in Vietnam: A Preliminary
Report on International Law and War Crimes."
Publications planned for future release include reports on
coronary heart disease, national priorities, Stanford Daily
independence, the future of Micronesia and the Davenport
California nuclear reactor.
Some of the courese being planned for this spring
include a sociological analysis of the Veterans for Peace
movement and a study on sewage pollution. Planning a
multi-media traveling ecology train is being considered.
This train would tour college campuses in the U.S.
