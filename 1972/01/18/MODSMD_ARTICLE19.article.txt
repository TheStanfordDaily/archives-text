# Columbae Class
## Franklin Returns To Teaching 
### JONATHAN DEDMON Commentary 
Suspended, banished from the
campus, and about to be fired, Bruce
Franklin nevertheless returned to the
"classroom" yesterday as 120 people
jammed into the Columbae Lounge.
It was the first time Franklin had
taught a class since February but time
hadn't changed a lot. It was Bruce at
his best, or, as many people
undoubtedly feel, his worst.
The meeting was held in Columbae
because Franklin has been banned
from the campus by a court
injunction. The course is officially
taught by graduate English student
Merle Rabine, since Franklin is also
suspended.
"Their ideas are Dinosaur ideas that
are being swept off the face of the
earth," he said of Stanford education.
"I was presenting the dominant ideas
of our times, the ideas that will win.
Those ideas won't be suppressed by
offing one person expressing them."
"If we're serious about an ongoing
class, there has to be some homework
and maybe people could even do
things to get a little extra credit."

What kind of homework?
"Go into the classes of those
professors and not let them get away
with that shit.
"When you have a businessman like
Bach totally committed to
perpetuating the rule of the rich
people, somebody's got to tell him
'Economics 1 is the fact that there are
rich people and poor people."
Franklin moved on to culture.
Referring to Mao's theory of art
(the week's assigned reading), he
continued, "all classes and all society
invariably put the political criteria
first and the artistic criteria second.
"That doesn't mean there's going to
be some professor up there saying
'capitalism is good and rich people are
wonderful. The main idea now being
taught is the idea of being apolitical.
"It would only be on that basis that
you could have someone like English
professor Bill Chace who has the sheer
audacity to call himself a Marxist
while admiring the poetry of Ezra
Pound. Pound said 'I'm a Fascist' and
was an apologist for Nazism and that's
in his poetry. Since Chace is later in
history he can't say 'I'm a fascist just

like Pound,' so he pulls a number on
everybody including himself by saying
'I'm really a Marxist.' "
Further expounding on the merit of
the professorial profession, Franklin
continued, "The main thing they [the
professors] teach is that the stuff
everybody likes is crap and the only
thing that's good is the stuff they [the
professors] like. And not only that,
but the stuff they like is so
complicated that it takes somebody
with a Ph.D. from Harvard or
Stanford—having performed the
obedience tests they call education -to
teach the stuff."
Franklin also argued that the ideas
of radicals Lenny Siegel and Steve
Weissman, were those of "comrades,"
but were still petty bourgeois in failing
to recognize the poor and workers as
vanguards of the revolution.
In a later discussion period,
Weissman asked Franklin if he would
risk coming on the campus for some
sort of convocation, maybe in
Memorial Church.
On the Mem Chu question,
Franklin referred back to the
appearance of Daniel Ellsberg there
two weeks ago, and commented, "This
time if we get 2,000 people in the
church we ought to move. You rarely
get 2,000 people in churches."
When questioned about movement
tactics he commented, "the problem
with tactics at Stanford is that
everybody is looking for the right
tactic, but what they mean by right
tactic is something that will work,
work quickly, and without any risk."
He also added, "The ideas I'm
expressing are more dangerous than
bombs because you can rebuild
buildings."
But he added, "That's not to put
down bombs, they have their place,
too."
No doubt about it, Bruce was back.

of our times, the ideas that will win.
Those ideas won't be suppressed by
offing one person expressing them."
"If we're serious about an ongoing
class, there has to be some homework
and maybe people could even do
things to get a little extra credit."

What kind of homework?
"Go into the classes of those
professors and not let them get away
with that shit.
"When you have a businessman like
Bach totally committed to
perpetuating the rule of the rich
people, somebody's got to tell him
'Economics 1 is the fact that there are
rich people and poor people."
Franklin moved on to culture.
Referring to Mao's theory of art
(the week's assigned reading), he
continued, "all classes and all society
invariably put the political criteria
first and the artistic criteria second.
"That doesn't mean there's going to
be some professor up there saying
'capitalism is good and rich people are
wonderful. The main idea now being
taught is the idea of being apolitical.
"It would only be on that basis that
you could have someone like English
professor Bill Chace who has the sheer
audacity to call himself a Marxist
while admiring the poetry of Ezra
Pound. Pound said 'I'm a Fascist' and
was an apologist for Nazism and that's
in his poetry. Since Chace is later in
history he can't say 'I'm a fascist just

like Pound,' so he pulls a number on
everybody including himself by saying
'I'm really a Marxist.' "
Further expounding on the merit of
the professorial profession, Franklin
continued, "The main thing they [the
professors] teach is that the stuff
everybody likes is crap and the only
thing that's good is the stuff they [the
professors] like. And not only that,
but the stuff they like is so
complicated that it takes somebody
with a Ph.D. from Harvard or
Stanford—having performed the
obedience tests they call education -to
teach the stuff."
Franklin also argued that the ideas
of radicals Lenny Siegel and Steve
Weissman, were those of "comrades,"
but were still petty bourgeois in failing
to recognize the poor and workers as
vanguards of the revolution.
In a later discussion period,
Weissman asked Franklin if he would
risk coming on the campus for some
sort of convocation, maybe in
Memorial Church.
On the Mem Chu question,
Franklin referred back to the
appearance of Daniel Ellsberg there
two weeks ago, and commented, "This
time if we get 2,000 people in the
church we ought to move. You rarely
get 2,000 people in churches."
When questioned about movement
tactics he commented, "the problem
with tactics at Stanford is that
everybody is looking for the right
tactic, but what they mean by right
tactic is something that will work,
work quickly, and without any risk."
He also added, "The ideas I'm
expressing are more dangerous than
bombs because you can rebuild
buildings."
But he added, "That's not to put
down bombs, they have their place,
too."
No doubt about it, Bruce was back.
Suspended, banished from the
campus, and about to be fired, Bruce
Franklin nevertheless returned to the
"classroom" yesterday as 120 people
jammed into the Columbae Lounge.
It was the first time Franklin had
taught a class since February but time
hadn't changed a lot. It was Bruce at
his best, or, as many people
undoubtedly feel, his worst.
The meeting was held in Columbae
because Franklin has been banned
from the campus by a court
injunction. The course is officially
taught by graduate English student
Merle Rabine, since Franklin is also
suspended.
"Their ideas are Dinosaur ideas that
are being swept off the face of the
earth," he said of Stanford education.
"I was presenting the dominant ideas
of our times, the ideas that will win.
