# City Council Requests Study Of Defense Firm Ban Legality
## 
### JOANNE JACOBS 
The Palo Alto City Council voted
5-4 at last night's meeting to ask the
city attorney to prepare an opinion on
"the city's ability to regulate the
activities and location of industries
both with respect to the tangible and
intangible effects on the community
of Palo Alto."
Advocates of Councilwoman Enid
Pearson's controversial motion hope
the legal opinion will pave the way for
a ban on new war-related industries in
Palo Alto.
Bruce Franklin, revolutionary
English professor in the process of
being fired, told the large audience
that war industry has "poisoned our
water, poisoned our resources,
poisoned our lives."
Although a series of Venceremos

members insisted that the issue was, in
reality, the capitalist imperialist
system, the Council members rejected
the radical analysis. Several pointed
out that the move only seeks to set
legal guidelines.
"I am not responding to a small,
vocal minority, but rather to the
majority of Palo Alto," Pearson stated,
referring to a referendum in which
citizens urged a pull-out of troops
from Vietnam by Dec. 31,1971.
Non-radicals, speaking in favor of
the motion, emphasized that it
concerns an extension of the zoning
laws already in force. One speaker
discussed the industries' relationship
to the Nuremberg precedent.
Along with Pearson,
Councilmen/women Alan Henderson,
Sylvia Seman, Richard Rosenbaum
and Mayor Kirke Comstock voted for
the motion.
Stanley Norton, William H. Clark,
John V. Beahrs and John J. Berwald
opposed it.
The opposition questioned whether
a ban on defense industries was
constitutional, appropriate for the
council to consider, meaningful or
wise.
Ethel Anderson, an interested
citizen, warned that the country could
be "caught with its defenses down."
Perhaps reacting negatively to the
heavy Venceremos presence, Walter
Wallis, a private citizen, referred to
"friends of our enemies" and the
"revolutionary ratpack."
Councilman Berwald called the
proposal "preposterous beyond belief"
and "as full of holes as Swiss cheese."
He feared the move would be "a
potentially fatal step" that might
"potentially lead to the downfall of
this nation."
The audience applauded.
Applause was frequent, loudest for

those supporting the motion. Nearly
50 rose to give Venceremos member
Jim Shoch, a former Stanford student,
a standing ovation when he called Palo
Alto a "staging ground for U.S.
intervention in Southeast Asia."
Saying that Palo Alto firms received
over $140 million in DoD contracts in
1971, Shoch declared, "A blow struck
against war industry and profiteering
in Palo Alto would be a blow struck
for the freedom of oppressed people's
everywhere. Human freedom will be
possible only when the rule of the
banks, multinational corporations and
defense contractors has been smashed
once and for all."
Occasionally members of the
audience interrupted speakers
opposing the motion, but the crowd
was generally good-natured, if bored.
They laughed as a youthful speaker
identified himself as David Packard
and complained that "people might
vote to ban war-related industries
everywhere." Elderly Frank Manfredi
compared realtors and industrialists to
"moneychangers in the temple" who,
he said, have lost their grip on the
Council.
Several speakers called the Council
more liberal than its predecessor, and
hit the Palo Alto Times for its editorial
criticizing Pearson.
Although one woman asked that a
"people's lawyer" work with city
attorney Peter Stone on the legal
opinion, Councilwoman Pearson
denied that Stone is hostile to the
motion.
"He doesn't need any help," she
said. "We don't need a guard or
guide."
Stone estimated that the study will
cost $3,000 of his time and will take
120-180 days to complete.
Plainclothes policemen filled the
council chambers during the meeting.
