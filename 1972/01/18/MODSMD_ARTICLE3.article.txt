# Hoover Found Locked
## University News Offices Occupied 
### JIM WASCHER 
Sixty protesters from the Stanford
Rehabilitation Movement occupied the
offices of the University News and
Publications Service in Encina
Commons for two hours yesterday
afternoon.
The SRM, an ad hoc committee
consisting of members of Venceremos,
the Association of Young Crows, and
the Faculty Political Action Group,
had marched to Encina from the
near-by Hoover Institution where they
had been locked out. They had
numbered about 150 during the rally
at Hoover.
News Service Director Robert
Beyers said that there had been no
significant damage done to the office
although a personal set of drawing
instruments was apparently taken.
While at the News and Publications
office, the protesters held discussions
with Beyers and Special Assistant to
the President John Schwartz. The
firing of Associate English Professor H.
Bruce Franklin received the most
attention of those talking with Beyers.
Also at the News and Publications
Office, the SRM issued a statement
saying that they regard "the arson at
the Manzanita Park office to be a
blatant act of provocation designed to
discredit the Movement and terrorize
the people." SRM, with the
endorsement of Venceremos,

condemned "this arson and all other
acts of agent-provocateurs."
Beyers was accused by the
demonstrators of consistently biased
reporting of the news in his press
releases. Pacific Studies Center
researcher Steve Weissman said that
"Beyers' perceptions of reality differ
from those of the people he reports
on.
Responding to the charges, Beyers
said, "I would report whatever I saw
[at a disturbance] as I have
consistently done here." Beyers
insisted, "I have certainly filed more
reports detrimental to the police than
the other way around."
Testimony Criticized
The protesters also criticized Beyers
for his testimony against Franklin
before the Faculty Advisory Board. In
response to this, Beyers said that "I
was not personally committed to any
personal desire to see him removed
from the University."
Schwartz was questioned about his
role in charging four students with
disrupting the attempts of the
Honeywell Corporation to recruit at
the Placement Center on November 4.
He said that he "picked the four
individuals whom the evidence pointed
to as having prevented the interviews
from being conducted."
Schwartz also said, "I can't think of
any University regulations that violate

my moral principles."
While at the News and Publications
office, the SRM used the office Xerox
machine to copy their pamphlets and
issued a "People's Ptess Release"
which criticized Beyers' handling of
his job.
At the 12:30 rally, speakers blasted
the extending of invitations to
Supreme Court Justice William H.
Rehnquist and former Deputy Defense
Secretary David Packard to join
Hoover's Board of Overseers.
Rehnquist is a Stanford graduate and
Packard is a former member of the
University's Board of Trustees.
Law student Wally Hunkeler called
Rehnquist a "racist, sexist, Fascist,
imperialist who has no place in this
University when our token radicals are
being thrown out."
Sit-In Urged
Venceremos member Don Lee said,
for the benefit of the University's legal
authorities, that he would "urge, incite
and advocate a sit-in at Hoover right
here and right now." It was at that
time that it was discovered that the
Institution's doors had been locked.
Hoover Institution Information
Officer James Hobson said that the
building had been locked at 11:00
a.m. on the orders of Director W.

Glenn Campbell. Campbell had
consulted with representatives of the
Administration before closing the
building.
Yesterday morning representatives
of the SRM visited several classes to
talk with professors whom they said
had not taken a public position on
Franklin's firing. The first class visited
was taught by Applied Mechanics
Department Chairman Arthur Bryson.
Bryson left the class, refusing to
discuss the Franklin case.
Faculty Advisory Board member
G.L. Bach's Econ I class was also
visited, but when protesters discovered
that the class was taking a quiz, they
left without any further disturbance.
Gurley Comments
Economics Professor John Gurley
did talk with the protesters about
Franklin's firing. The Marxist
economist said that "I object to his
being fired," but that "I don't feel any
immediate threat from the decision. I
don't operate on the level that Bruce
Franklin operates."
In a related development, 338 of
the 1,240 employees at SLAC signed a
petition supporting SLAC Director

Wolfgang Panofsky's vote against
Franklin on the Faculty Advisory
Board. The signatures were gathered in
less than a day of circulation on
Friday.
The letter to Panofsky said, "It is
seldom in our lifetime that we are
called upon, as you were in the recent
Franklin case, to make the decision
which might be not only unpopular
with an active and very vocal group,
but might also bring upon ourselves
and our families the threat of physical
violence."
