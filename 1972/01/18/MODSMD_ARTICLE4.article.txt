# Trustees Reinstate ROTC At Princeton
## 
### 
After 18 months, the Princeton University board of trustees has reversed
itself and voted to permit ROTC to remain on that campus as an extracurricular
activity.
Princeton is believed to be the first Ivy League college to reverse itself on the
ROTC question. Reports circulating allege that Brown University is also
considering such a decision.
In the spring of 1970, after a student strike against the use of American
troops in Cambodia, Princeton decided to cancel their contract with the Army,
Air Force and Navy ROTC's.
The plan approved by the trustees there Saturday allows ROTC to return as
an extracurricular activity, without credit for ROTC classes; it will operate with
no financial loss to the university, and military instructors will have no faculty
status.
The Air Force and Army have shown an interest in starting units again at the
school although it is doubtful the Navy will form an ROTC unit at the school.
Conflicting Recommendations
Debate over the possible revival of ROTC there has raged all fall at Princeton.
The faculty and undergraduate student organizations voted against revival while
the University Council, a student, faculty, and administration advisory body,
approved the proposal. A student referendum last spring supported the revival of
ROTC with a 1,239 to 945 vote.
The trustee vote was 30-4.
At Stanford, vice provost Robert Rosenzweig said that "nothing has
changed" with ROTC here. "It is being phased out on schedule (June 1973)," he
said. Rosenzweig also denied a rumor that Stanford was interested in reviving the
ROTC programs here.
In June 1970 the Stanford Faculty Senate endorsed the report of a
faculty-student committee recommending that ROTC be phased out at Stanford.
A month earlier the Faculty Senate had denied credit to ROTC classes.
