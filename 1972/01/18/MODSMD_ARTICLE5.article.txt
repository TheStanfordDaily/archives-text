# Pipe Bomb Found In Substation
## 
### 
A Palo Alto utilities worker
discovered a large pipe bomb,
containing almost two pounds of
gunpowder, at the electrical substation
in the Stanford Industrial Park
yesterday morning.
According to Palo Alto police, the
bomb, filled with black smokeless
powder, was housed in a 14V2-inch

steel pipe, three inches in diameter
which was capped at both ends.
The bomb failed to explode
because a piece of punk, a wood often
used to ignite fireworks, failed to burn
completely and did not light a 30-foot
long fuse attached to the pipe.
Bomb Disarmed
Police cordoned off the substation,
located at Hanover and Hillview near
Hewlitt-Packard, at about 8:40 a.m.,
and two soldiers from the 6th Army
bomb disposal unit based at the
Presidio disarmed the device just after
10 a.m.
The bomb was placed on a narrow,
seven-foot high beam, adjacent to
three large circuit breakers in the
center of the substation. Had it
exploded, it would have temporarily
interrupted service to most of the
Industrial Park.
The bomber apparently entered the
substation yard through a two-foot

wide, triangularly shaped ( iole in the
chain link fence sum/ nding the
station yard.
Weekend Plant
It apparently was planted some
time between 4 p.m. Friday, when
workmen left the yard, and the time it
was discovered yesterday.
The bomb squad arrived at the
substation about 10 a.m. and listened
to the bomb with a stethoscope before
attempting to disarm it.
They tied a string to it and pulled it
off the beam. After another
stethoscope check, the two men put
the bomb in a portable vice and
unscrewed one end, revealing the
powder inside.
Palo Alto officials said they would
tighten security on other substations
around the city.
The bomb's components have been
sent to the laboratory of Alcohol and
Tobacco Tax Division of the Treasury
Department.
