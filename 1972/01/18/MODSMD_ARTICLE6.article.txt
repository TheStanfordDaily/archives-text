## 1st Amendment Law: Another View 
### 
Joel Klein, a member of the
Franklin Defense Committee,
charged in an article which
appeared in the Daily on January
11th that "the majority report in
the Bruce Franklin case is so
replete with misrepresentations
and prejudice, that I am hesitant
to single out one aspect for
discussion."
Mr Klein's hesitancy is
overcome by the next sentence
and he unhesitatingly singles out
one aspect of the Franklin case
for lengthy discussion. The basic
thesis of the Klein article is his
assertion that the Board's decision
deprives Bruce Franklin of his
rights of free speech guaranteed
by the first amendment of the
Constitution, and that the Board
had every reason to know that it
was depriving Franklin of his
constitutional rights in view of
three recent court cases.
The three cases cited by Mr.
Klein in support of his views are
Brandenburg v. Ohio (395 U.S.
444), the so-called Siegel Case (no
citation or opinion available),and
Cox v. Louisiana (379 U.S. 536
and 379 U.S. 559).
Mr. Klein briefly refers to these
three cases and asks his readers to
trust his unstated legal analysis
that these cases clearly support his
views that Mr. Franklin's
constitutional rights have been
trod upon. Either Mr. Klein has
neglected to read these three cases
or his emotional desires have
interferred with his analytical
abilities.
While honest and objective
attorneys may differ as to the
exact holdings in these cases, it is
clear that, even when viewed in a
manner most favorable to
Franklin's cause, these cases offer
far more support for the Board's
decision than they do for Klein's
contentions. Unlike Mr. Klein, let
me give some of the details of the
three cases.
Brandenberg v. Ohio was a
1969 decision by the U.S.
Supreme Court. One Brandenberg,
a Ku Klux Klan leader, was
convicted under an Ohio state
statute which prohibited
"advocat [ing] . . . the duty,
necessity, or propriety of crime,
sabotage, violence, or unlawful
methods of terrorism as a means

of accomplishing industrial or
political reform.. . ."
In short, the Ohio statute
purported to make the mere
advocacy of violence a crime.
After reciting the specific acts of
advocacy which led to
Brandenburg's conviction in state
court and the history of the Ohio
statute, the Supreme Court
pointed out that it had upheld a
similar California statute in a
1927 opinion. (Whitney v.
California, 274 U.S. 357)
The court then made it crystal
clear that it was overruling its
1927 opinion and reversed
Brandenburg's conviction on the
grounds that the Ohio statute
under which he was convicted
violated the guarantee of free
speech in the First amendment of
the Constitution.
In finding the Ohio statute
unconstitutional the court
reiterated the basic constitutional
principle by stating that. .; the
guarantees of free speech and free
press do not permit a State to
forbid or proscribe advocacy of
the use of force or of law
violation except where such
advocacy is directed to inciting or
producing imminent lawless
action and is likely to incite or
produce such action."
The Court then quoted from
an earlier decision (Noto v. United
States, 367 U.S. 290) in stating
that "the mere abstract
teacing ... of the moral propriety
or even moral necessity for a
resort to force and violence is not
the same as preparing a group for
violent action and steeling it to
such action."
If one thing is crystal clear
from the Court's opinion in
Brandenburg, it is that while mere
advocacy of violence or illegal acts
is constitutionally protected.
ADVOCACY DIRECTED TO
PRODUCING OR INCITING
IMMINENT LAWLESS ACTION
AND WHICH IS LIKELY TO
PRODUCE OR INVITE SUCH
ACTION IS NOT
CONSTITUTIONALLY
PROTECTED.
Anyone who has bothered to
read the Advisory Board's
decision in the Franklin Case must
realize that the Board found that
Professor Franklin did not engage
in the "mere advocacy" of illegal
acts. Indeed the Board in its
findings of fact specifically found
that Professor Franklin urged and
incited his audience towards
specific acts and that Professor
Franklin must reasonably have
expected that his incitements and
urgings would increase the
likelihood of illegal acts.
I have not addressed myself to
the question of whether the
Board's findings of fact are
supported by the evidence,
although in my opinion they are.
What I am saying is that anyone
who reads both the Board's
decision and the decision of the
United States Supreme Court in
Brandenburg must conclude that
the charges that Professor
Franklin's constitutional rights
were violated are clearly specious.
It is interesting that Justice
Douglas wrote a somewhat
confusing concurring opinion in

Brandenburg, supported in part
by Justice Black which could be
used to support Mr. Klein's views.
However, the fact that Justice
Douglas could only attract the
partial support of one additional
Justice for his concurring opinion
is another convincing argument
against Mr. Klein's statements.
After invoking Brandenburg,
Mr. Klein offers us the case of
Dan Siegel prosecuted speeches in
the peoples park incidents. After a
brief description of the speeches
made by Mr. Siegel, Klein states
"Siegel was prosecuted for both
speeches and in both cases he was
acquitted because his speeches
were not incitements."
I have several comments in this
area. First, how does Mr. Klein
know why Siegel was acquitted:
there are numerous possible
explanations including the one
that the prosecution simply failed
to prove its case.
Second, an acquittal is a
finding of fact, not a precedent of
Constitutional law. Thus, even
assuming Mr. Klein is correct in
assuming that Siegel was acquitted
because his speeches did not
constitute "incitement," this
factual finding is irrelevant to
interpreting the meaning of the
Supreme Court's decision in
Brandenburg.
Third, Mr. Klein himself admits
that Siegel was suspended for his
speeches and that he has so far
been unsuccessful in seeking
judicial relief for this
administrative action by the
University of California.
In passing, I must add that it
amazed me that a graduate of
Harvard Law school would baldly
cite an acquittal in a criminal case
as binding constitutional
precedent. Any student who
relied on such a verdict to support
his opinions in even a basic law
school course in Constitutional
Law would not expect a passing
grade.
The third case used by Mr.
Klein in support of his
contentions was Cox v. Louisiana,
(379 U.S. 566 and 379 U.S. 559).
It is interesting that Mr. Klein
neglected to inform his readers
that there were really two cases
arising out of the same series of
incidents which were decided by
the court on the same day. More
important, the Cox cases were
decided over five years before the
court's opinion in Brandenburg
and Cox does not deal with the
incitement problems raised by
Brandenburg and the decision in
the Franklin case.
In his article, Mr. Klein stated
that "in Cox, during civil rights
protests . . . Reverand Cox told
his listeners to go and sit-in
at . .. segregated lunch counters, a
command which was in violation
of state law. The Supreme Court
held that irrespective of the
lawfulness of the sit-in, Reverand
Cox's advocacy was lawful." This
is correct as far as it goes.
However, Mr. Klein neglected to
disclose the following information
and distinctions contained in the
Cox opinions:
1. The statute under which
Cox was convicted was not
concerned with incitement; rather

it was a state breach of the peace
statute. Indeed, the problems of
"incitement" are never directly
discussed by the court in Cox as
they were in Brandenburg five
years later.
2. The Louisiana breach of
peace statute was declared to be
unconstitutionally vague in its
overly broad scope precisely
because its language could be used
to punish the "mere advocacy"
which was protected by the court
in Brandenburg.
3. Nowhere in the Cox cases
were there any allusion to
violence, the likelihood of
violence, or even the real
possibility of violence. Indeed, it
is clear from reading the opinion
that all parties recognized that
Reverand Cox's speeches and
conduct posed little danger of
provoking or causing violence.
In conclusion, it is my opinion
that Mr. Klein's contention that

ihomas 112. bartman

the Advisory Board's decision
clearly deprives Bruce Franklin of
his first amendment rights in view
of the three cases cited by Joel
Klein, himself, is false.
While the problems of
"incitement" raised in
Brandenburg are complex and
uncertain areas of Constitutional
law, Mr. Klein's simplistic
discussion of these problems in on
an incredibly low level.
Unlike Mr. Klein, I do not
expect the readers of my article to
trust my unsupported statements.
Anyone who has doubts about my
views can easily go to the law
library on the third floor of the
law school and ask the librarians
or any law student to locate the
cases involved.

The Court then quoted from
an earlier decision (Noto v. United
States, 367 U.S. 290) in stating
that "the mere abstract
teacing ... of the moral propriety
or even moral necessity for a
resort to force and violence is not
the same as preparing a group for
violent action and steeling it to
such action."
If one thing is crystal clear
from the Court's opinion in
Brandenburg, it is that while mere
advocacy of violence or illegal acts
is constitutionally protected.
ADVOCACY DIRECTED TO
PRODUCING OR INCITING
IMMINENT LAWLESS ACTION
AND WHICH IS LIKELY TO
PRODUCE OR INVITE SUCH
ACTION IS NOT
CONSTITUTIONALLY
PROTECTED.
Anyone who has bothered to
read the Advisory Board's
decision in the Franklin Case must
realize that the Board found that
Professor Franklin did not engage
in the "mere advocacy" of illegal
acts. Indeed the Board in its
findings of fact specifically found
that Professor Franklin urged and
incited his audience towards
specific acts and that Professor
Franklin must reasonably have
expected that his incitements and
urgings would increase the
likelihood of illegal acts.
I have not addressed myself to
the question of whether the
Board's findings of fact are
supported by the evidence,
although in my opinion they are.
What I am saying is that anyone
who reads both the Board's
decision and the decision of the
United States Supreme Court in
Brandenburg must conclude that
the charges that Professor
Franklin's constitutional rights
were violated are clearly specious.
It is interesting that Justice
Douglas wrote a somewhat
confusing concurring opinion in

Brandenburg, supported in part
by Justice Black which could be
used to support Mr. Klein's views.
However, the fact that Justice
Douglas could only attract the
partial support of one additional
Justice for his concurring opinion
is another convincing argument
against Mr. Klein's statements.
After invoking Brandenburg,
Mr. Klein offers us the case of
Dan Siegel prosecuted speeches in
the peoples park incidents. After a
brief description of the speeches
made by Mr. Siegel, Klein states
"Siegel was prosecuted for both
speeches and in both cases he was
acquitted because his speeches
were not incitements."
I have several comments in this
area. First, how does Mr. Klein
know why Siegel was acquitted:
there are numerous possible
explanations including the one
that the prosecution simply failed
to prove its case.
Second, an acquittal is a
finding of fact, not a precedent of
Constitutional law. Thus, even
assuming Mr. Klein is correct in
assuming that Siegel was acquitted
because his speeches did not
constitute "incitement," this
factual finding is irrelevant to
interpreting the meaning of the
Supreme Court's decision in
Brandenburg.
Third, Mr. Klein himself admits
that Siegel was suspended for his
speeches and that he has so far
been unsuccessful in seeking
judicial relief for this
administrative action by the
University of California.
In passing, I must add that it
amazed me that a graduate of
Harvard Law school would baldly
cite an acquittal in a criminal case
as binding constitutional
precedent. Any student who
relied on such a verdict to support
his opinions in even a basic law
school course in Constitutional
Law would not expect a passing
grade.
The third case used by Mr.
Klein in support of his
contentions was Cox v. Louisiana,
(379 U.S. 566 and 379 U.S. 559).
It is interesting that Mr. Klein
neglected to inform his readers
that there were really two cases
arising out of the same series of
incidents which were decided by
the court on the same day. More
important, the Cox cases were
decided over five years before the
court's opinion in Brandenburg
and Cox does not deal with the
incitement problems raised by
Brandenburg and the decision in
the Franklin case.
In his article, Mr. Klein stated
that "in Cox, during civil rights
protests . . . Reverand Cox told
his listeners to go and sit-in
at . .. segregated lunch counters, a
command which was in violation
of state law. The Supreme Court
held that irrespective of the
lawfulness of the sit-in, Reverand
Cox's advocacy was lawful." This
is correct as far as it goes.
However, Mr. Klein neglected to
disclose the following information
and distinctions contained in the
Cox opinions:
1. The statute under which
Cox was convicted was not
concerned with incitement; rather

it was a state breach of the peace
statute. Indeed, the problems of
"incitement" are never directly
discussed by the court in Cox as
they were in Brandenburg five
years later.
2. The Louisiana breach of
peace statute was declared to be
unconstitutionally vague in its
overly broad scope precisely
because its language could be used
to punish the "mere advocacy"
which was protected by the court
in Brandenburg.
3. Nowhere in the Cox cases
were there any allusion to
violence, the likelihood of
violence, or even the real
possibility of violence. Indeed, it
is clear from reading the opinion
that all parties recognized that
Reverand Cox's speeches and
conduct posed little danger of
provoking or causing violence.
In conclusion, it is my opinion
that Mr. Klein's contention that

ihomas 112. bartman

the Advisory Board's decision
clearly deprives Bruce Franklin of
his first amendment rights in view
of the three cases cited by Joel
Klein, himself, is false.
While the problems of
"incitement" raised in
Brandenburg are complex and
uncertain areas of Constitutional
law, Mr. Klein's simplistic
discussion of these problems in on
an incredibly low level.
Unlike Mr. Klein, I do not
expect the readers of my article to
trust my unsupported statements.
Anyone who has doubts about my
views can easily go to the law
library on the third floor of the
law school and ask the librarians
or any law student to locate the

Joel Klein, a member of the
Franklin Defense Committee,
charged in an article which
appeared in the Daily on January
11th that "the majority report in
the Bruce Franklin case is so
replete with misrepresentations
and prejudice, that I am hesitant
to single out one aspect for
discussion."
Mr Klein's hesitancy is
overcome by the next sentence
and he unhesitatingly singles out
one aspect of the Franklin case
for lengthy discussion. The basic
thesis of the Klein article is his
assertion that the Board's decision
deprives Bruce Franklin of his
rights of free speech guaranteed
by the first amendment of the
Constitution, and that the Board
had every reason to know that it
was depriving Franklin of his
constitutional rights in view of
three recent court cases.
The three cases cited by Mr.
Klein in support of his views are
Brandenburg v. Ohio (395 U.S.
444), the so-called Siegel Case (no
citation or opinion available),and
Cox v. Louisiana (379 U.S. 536
and 379 U.S. 559).
Mr. Klein briefly refers to these
three cases and asks his readers to
trust his unstated legal analysis
that these cases clearly support his
views that Mr. Franklin's
constitutional rights have been
trod upon. Either Mr. Klein has
neglected to read these three cases
or his emotional desires have
interferred with his analytical
abilities.
While honest and objective
attorneys may differ as to the
exact holdings in these cases, it is
clear that, even when viewed in a
manner most favorable to
Franklin's cause, these cases offer
far more support for the Board's
decision than they do for Klein's
contentions. Unlike Mr. Klein, let
me give some of the details of the
three cases.
Brandenberg v. Ohio was a
1969 decision by the U.S.
Supreme Court. One Brandenberg,
a Ku Klux Klan leader, was
convicted under an Ohio state
statute which prohibited
"advocat [ing] . . . the duty,
necessity, or propriety of crime,
sabotage, violence, or unlawful
methods of terrorism as a means

of accomplishing industrial or
political reform.. . ."
In short, the Ohio statute
purported to make the mere
advocacy of violence a crime.
After reciting the specific acts of
advocacy which led to
Brandenburg's conviction in state
court and the history of the Ohio
statute, the Supreme Court
pointed out that it had upheld a
similar California statute in a
1927 opinion. (Whitney v.
California, 274 U.S. 357)
The court then made it crystal
clear that it was overruling its
1927 opinion and reversed
Brandenburg's conviction on the
grounds that the Ohio statute
under which he was convicted
violated the guarantee of free
speech in the First amendment of
the Constitution.
In finding the Ohio statute
unconstitutional the court
reiterated the basic constitutional
principle by stating that. .; the
guarantees of free speech and free
press do not permit a State to
forbid or proscribe advocacy of
the use of force or of law
violation except where such
advocacy is directed to inciting or
producing imminent lawless
action and is likely to incite or
produce such action."
The Court then quoted from
an earlier decision (Noto v. United
States, 367 U.S. 290) in stating
that "the mere abstract
teacing ... of the moral propriety
or even moral necessity for a
resort to force and violence is not
the same as preparing a group for
violent action and steeling it to

(379 U.S. 566 and 379 U.S. 559).
It is interesting that Mr. Klein
neglected to inform his readers
that there were really two cases
arising out of the same series of
incidents which were decided by
the court on the same day. More
important, the Cox cases were
decided over five years before the
court's opinion in Brandenburg
and Cox does not deal with the
incitement problems raised by
Brandenburg and the decision in
the Franklin case.
In his article, Mr. Klein stated
that "in Cox, during civil rights
protests . . . Reverand Cox told
his listeners to go and sit-in
at . .. segregated lunch counters, a
command which was in violation
of state law. The Supreme Court
held that irrespective of the
lawfulness of the sit-in, Reverand
Cox's advocacy was lawful." This
is correct as far as it goes.
However, Mr. Klein neglected to
disclose the following information
and distinctions contained in the
Cox opinions:
1. The statute under which
Cox was convicted was not
concerned with incitement; rather

it was a state breach of the peace
statute. Indeed, the problems of
"incitement" are never directly
discussed by the court in Cox as
they were in Brandenburg five
years later.
2. The Louisiana breach of
peace statute was declared to be
unconstitutionally vague in its
overly broad scope precisely
because its language could be used
to punish the "mere advocacy"
which was protected by the court
in Brandenburg.
3. Nowhere in the Cox cases
were there any allusion to
violence, the likelihood of
violence, or even the real
possibility of violence. Indeed, it
is clear from reading the opinion
that all parties recognized that
Reverand Cox's speeches and
conduct posed little danger of
provoking or causing violence.
In conclusion, it is my opinion
that Mr. Klein's contention that

ihomas 112. bartman

the Advisory Board's decision
clearly deprives Bruce Franklin of
his first amendment rights in view
of the three cases cited by Joel
Klein, himself, is false.
While the problems of
"incitement" raised in
Brandenburg are complex and
uncertain areas of Constitutional
law, Mr. Klein's simplistic
discussion of these problems in on
an incredibly low level.
Unlike Mr. Klein, I do not
expect the readers of my article to
trust my unsupported statements.
Anyone who has doubts about my
views can easily go to the law
library on the third floor of the
law school and ask the librarians
or any law student to locate the

Joel Klein, a member of the
Franklin Defense Committee,
charged in an article which
appeared in the Daily on January
11th that "the majority report in
the Bruce Franklin case is so
replete with misrepresentations
and prejudice, that I am hesitant
to single out one aspect for
discussion."
Mr Klein's hesitancy is
overcome by the next sentence
and he unhesitatingly singles out
one aspect of the Franklin case
for lengthy discussion. The basic
thesis of the Klein article is his
assertion that the Board's decision
deprives Bruce Franklin of his
rights of free speech guaranteed
by the first amendment of the
Constitution, and that the Board
had every reason to know that it
was depriving Franklin of his
constitutional rights in view of
three recent court cases.
The three cases cited by Mr.
Klein in support of his views are
Brandenburg v. Ohio (395 U.S.
444), the so-called Siegel Case (no
citation or opinion available),and
Cox v. Louisiana (379 U.S. 536
and 379 U.S. 559).
Mr. Klein briefly refers to these
three cases and asks his readers to
trust his unstated legal analysis
that these cases clearly support his
views that Mr. Franklin's
constitutional rights have been
trod upon. Either Mr. Klein has
neglected to read these three cases
or his emotional desires have
interferred with his analytical
abilities.
While honest and objective
attorneys may differ as to the
exact holdings in these cases, it is
clear that, even when viewed in a
manner most favorable to
Franklin's cause, these cases offer
far more support for the Board's
decision than they do for Klein's
contentions. Unlike Mr. Klein, let
me give some of the details of the
three cases.
Brandenberg v. Ohio was a
1969 decision by the U.S.
Supreme Court. One Brandenberg,
a Ku Klux Klan leader, was
convicted under an Ohio state
statute which prohibited
"advocat [ing] . . . the duty,
necessity, or propriety of crime,
sabotage, violence, or unlawful
methods of terrorism as a means

of accomplishing industrial or
political reform.. . ."
In short, the Ohio statute
purported to make the mere
advocacy of violence a crime.
After reciting the specific acts of
advocacy which led to
Brandenburg's conviction in state
court and the history of the Ohio
statute, the Supreme Court
pointed out that it had upheld a
similar California statute in a
1927 opinion. (Whitney v.
California, 274 U.S. 357)
The court then made it crystal
clear that it was overruling its
1927 opinion and reversed
Brandenburg's conviction on the
grounds that the Ohio statute
under which he was convicted
violated the guarantee of free
speech in the First amendment of
the Constitution.
In finding the Ohio statute
unconstitutional the court
reiterated the basic constitutional
principle by stating that. .; the
guarantees of free speech and free
press do not permit a State to
forbid or proscribe advocacy of
the use of force or of law
violation except where such
advocacy is directed to inciting or
producing imminent lawless
action and is likely to incite or
produce such action."
The Court then quoted from
an earlier decision (Noto v. United
States, 367 U.S. 290) in stating
that "the mere abstract
teacing ... of the moral propriety
or even moral necessity for a
resort to force and violence is not
the same as preparing a group for
violent action and steeling it to
such action."
If one thing is crystal clear
from the Court's opinion in
Brandenburg, it is that while mere
advocacy of violence or illegal acts
is constitutionally protected.
ADVOCACY DIRECTED TO
PRODUCING OR INCITING
IMMINENT LAWLESS ACTION
AND WHICH IS LIKELY TO
PRODUCE OR INVITE SUCH
ACTION IS NOT
CONSTITUTIONALLY
PROTECTED.
Anyone who has bothered to
read the Advisory Board's
decision in the Franklin Case must
realize that the Board found that
Professor Franklin did not engage
in the "mere advocacy" of illegal
acts. Indeed the Board in its
findings of fact specifically found
that Professor Franklin urged and
incited his audience towards
specific acts and that Professor
Franklin must reasonably have
expected that his incitements and
urgings would increase the
likelihood of illegal acts.
I have not addressed myself to
the question of whether the
Board's findings of fact are
supported by the evidence,
although in my opinion they are.
What I am saying is that anyone
who reads both the Board's
decision and the decision of the
United States Supreme Court in
Brandenburg must conclude that
the charges that Professor
Franklin's constitutional rights
were violated are clearly specious.
It is interesting that Justice
Douglas wrote a somewhat
confusing concurring opinion in

Brandenburg, supported in part
by Justice Black which could be
used to support Mr. Klein's views.
However, the fact that Justice
Douglas could only attract the
partial support of one additional
Justice for his concurring opinion
is another convincing argument
against Mr. Klein's statements.
After invoking Brandenburg,
Mr. Klein offers us the case of
Dan Siegel prosecuted speeches in
the peoples park incidents. After a
brief description of the speeches
made by Mr. Siegel, Klein states
"Siegel was prosecuted for both
speeches and in both cases he was
acquitted because his speeches
were not incitements."
I have several comments in this
area. First, how does Mr. Klein
know why Siegel was acquitted:
there are numerous possible
explanations including the one
that the prosecution simply failed
to prove its case.
Second, an acquittal is a
finding of fact, not a precedent of
Constitutional law. Thus, even
assuming Mr. Klein is correct in
assuming that Siegel was acquitted
because his speeches did not
constitute "incitement," this
factual finding is irrelevant to
interpreting the meaning of the
Supreme Court's decision in
Brandenburg.
Third, Mr. Klein himself admits
that Siegel was suspended for his
speeches and that he has so far
been unsuccessful in seeking
judicial relief for this
administrative action by the
University of California.
In passing, I must add that it
amazed me that a graduate of
Harvard Law school would baldly
cite an acquittal in a criminal case
as binding constitutional
precedent. Any student who
relied on such a verdict to support
his opinions in even a basic law
school course in Constitutional
Law would not expect a passing
grade.
The third case used by Mr.
Klein in support of his
contentions was Cox v. Louisiana,
(379 U.S. 566 and 379 U.S. 559).
It is interesting that Mr. Klein
neglected to inform his readers

rights of free speech guaranteed
by the first amendment of the
Constitution, and that the Board
had every reason to know that it
was depriving Franklin of his
constitutional rights in view of
three recent court cases.
The three cases cited by Mr.
Klein in support of his views are
Brandenburg v. Ohio (395 U.S.
444), the so-called Siegel Case (no
citation or opinion available),and
Cox v. Louisiana (379 U.S. 536
and 379 U.S. 559).
Mr. Klein briefly refers to these
three cases and asks his readers to
trust his unstated legal analysis
that these cases clearly support his
views that Mr. Franklin's
constitutional rights have been
trod upon. Either Mr. Klein has
neglected to read these three cases
or his emotional desires have
interferred with his analytical
abilities.
While honest and objective
attorneys may differ as to the
exact holdings in these cases, it is
clear that, even when viewed in a
manner most favorable to
Franklin's cause, these cases offer
far more support for the Board's
decision than they do for Klein's
contentions. Unlike Mr. Klein, let
me give some of the details of the
three cases.
Brandenberg v. Ohio was a
1969 decision by the U.S.
Supreme Court. One Brandenberg,
a Ku Klux Klan leader, was
convicted under an Ohio state
statute which prohibited
"advocat [ing] . . . the duty,
necessity, or propriety of crime,
sabotage, violence, or unlawful
methods of terrorism as a means

of accomplishing industrial or
political reform.. . ."
In short, the Ohio statute
purported to make the mere
advocacy of violence a crime.
After reciting the specific acts of
advocacy which led to
Brandenburg's conviction in state
court and the history of the Ohio
statute, the Supreme Court
pointed out that it had upheld a
similar California statute in a
1927 opinion. (Whitney v.
California, 274 U.S. 357)
The court then made it crystal
clear that it was overruling its
1927 opinion and reversed
Brandenburg's conviction on the
grounds that the Ohio statute
under which he was convicted
violated the guarantee of free
speech in the First amendment of
the Constitution.
In finding the Ohio statute
unconstitutional the court
reiterated the basic constitutional
principle by stating that. .; the
guarantees of free speech and free
press do not permit a State to
forbid or proscribe advocacy of
the use of force or of law
violation except where such
advocacy is directed to inciting or
producing imminent lawless
action and is likely to incite or
produce such action."
The Court then quoted from
an earlier decision (Noto v. United
States, 367 U.S. 290) in stating
that "the mere abstract
teacing ... of the moral propriety
or even moral necessity for a
resort to force and violence is not
the same as preparing a group for
violent action and steeling it to
such action."
If one thing is crystal clear
from the Court's opinion in
Brandenburg, it is that while mere
advocacy of violence or illegal acts
is constitutionally protected.
ADVOCACY DIRECTED TO
PRODUCING OR INCITING
IMMINENT LAWLESS ACTION
AND WHICH IS LIKELY TO
PRODUCE OR INVITE SUCH
ACTION IS NOT
CONSTITUTIONALLY
PROTECTED.
Anyone who has bothered to
read the Advisory Board's
decision in the Franklin Case must
realize that the Board found that
Professor Franklin did not engage
in the "mere advocacy" of illegal
acts. Indeed the Board in its
findings of fact specifically found
that Professor Franklin urged and
incited his audience towards
specific acts and that Professor
Franklin must reasonably have
expected that his incitements and
urgings would increase the
likelihood of illegal acts.
I have not addressed myself to
the question of whether the
Board's findings of fact are
supported by the evidence,
although in my opinion they are.
What I am saying is that anyone
who reads both the Board's
decision and the decision of the
United States Supreme Court in
Brandenburg must conclude that
the charges that Professor
Franklin's constitutional rights
were violated are clearly specious.
It is interesting that Justice
Douglas wrote a somewhat
confusing concurring opinion in

Brandenburg, supported in part
by Justice Black which could be
used to support Mr. Klein's views.
However, the fact that Justice
Douglas could only attract the
partial support of one additional
Justice for his concurring opinion
is another convincing argument
against Mr. Klein's statements.
After invoking Brandenburg,
Mr. Klein offers us the case of
Dan Siegel prosecuted speeches in
the peoples park incidents. After a
brief description of the speeches
made by Mr. Siegel, Klein states
"Siegel was prosecuted for both
speeches and in both cases he was
acquitted because his speeches
were not incitements."
I have several comments in this
area. First, how does Mr. Klein
know why Siegel was acquitted:
there are numerous possible
explanations including the one
that the prosecution simply failed
to prove its case.
Second, an acquittal is a
finding of fact, not a precedent of
Constitutional law. Thus, even
assuming Mr. Klein is correct in
assuming that Siegel was acquitted
because his speeches did not
constitute "incitement," this
factual finding is irrelevant to
interpreting the meaning of the
Supreme Court's decision in
Brandenburg.
Third, Mr. Klein himself admits
that Siegel was suspended for his
speeches and that he has so far
been unsuccessful in seeking
judicial relief for this
administrative action by the
University of California.
In passing, I must add that it
amazed me that a graduate of
Harvard Law school would baldly
cite an acquittal in a criminal case
as binding constitutional
precedent. Any student who
relied on such a verdict to support
his opinions in even a basic law
school course in Constitutional
Law would not expect a passing
grade.
The third case used by Mr.
Klein in support of his
contentions was Cox v. Louisiana,
(379 U.S. 566 and 379 U.S. 559).
It is interesting that Mr. Klein
neglected to inform his readers
that there were really two cases
arising out of the same series of
incidents which were decided by
the court on the same day. More
important, the Cox cases were
decided over five years before the
court's opinion in Brandenburg
and Cox does not deal with the
incitement problems raised by
Brandenburg and the decision in
the Franklin case.
In his article, Mr. Klein stated
that "in Cox, during civil rights
protests . . . Reverand Cox told
his listeners to go and sit-in
at . .. segregated lunch counters, a
command which was in violation
of state law. The Supreme Court
held that irrespective of the
lawfulness of the sit-in, Reverand
Cox's advocacy was lawful." This
is correct as far as it goes.
However, Mr. Klein neglected to
disclose the following information
and distinctions contained in the
Cox opinions:
1. The statute under which
Cox was convicted was not
concerned with incitement; rather

it was a state breach of the peace
statute. Indeed, the problems of
"incitement" are never directly
discussed by the court in Cox as
they were in Brandenburg five
years later.
2. The Louisiana breach of
peace statute was declared to be
unconstitutionally vague in its
overly broad scope precisely
because its language could be used
to punish the "mere advocacy"
which was protected by the court
in Brandenburg.
3. Nowhere in the Cox cases
were there any allusion to
violence, the likelihood of
violence, or even the real
possibility of violence. Indeed, it
is clear from reading the opinion
that all parties recognized that
Reverand Cox's speeches and
conduct posed little danger of
provoking or causing violence.
In conclusion, it is my opinion
that Mr. Klein's contention that

ihomas 112. bartman

the Advisory Board's decision
clearly deprives Bruce Franklin of
his first amendment rights in view
of the three cases cited by Joel
Klein, himself, is false.
While the problems of
"incitement" raised in
Brandenburg are complex and
uncertain areas of Constitutional
law, Mr. Klein's simplistic
discussion of these problems in on
an incredibly low level.
Unlike Mr. Klein, I do not
expect the readers of my article to
trust my unsupported statements.
Anyone who has doubts about my
views can easily go to the law
library on the third floor of the
law school and ask the librarians
or any law student to locate the
cases involved.

Joel Klein, a member of the
Franklin Defense Committee,
charged in an article which
appeared in the Daily on January
11th that "the majority report in
the Bruce Franklin case is so
replete with misrepresentations
and prejudice, that I am hesitant
to single out one aspect for
discussion."
Mr Klein's hesitancy is
overcome by the next sentence
and he unhesitatingly singles out
one aspect of the Franklin case
for lengthy discussion. The basic
thesis of the Klein article is his
assertion that the Board's decision

PRODUCE OR INVITE SUCH
ACTION IS NOT
CONSTITUTIONALLY
PROTECTED.
Anyone who has bothered to
read the Advisory Board's
decision in the Franklin Case must
realize that the Board found that
Professor Franklin did not engage
in the "mere advocacy" of illegal
acts. Indeed the Board in its
findings of fact specifically found
that Professor Franklin urged and
incited his audience towards
specific acts and that Professor
Franklin must reasonably have
expected that his incitements and
urgings would increase the
likelihood of illegal acts.
I have not addressed myself to
the question of whether the
Board's findings of fact are
supported by the evidence,
although in my opinion they are.
What I am saying is that anyone
who reads both the Board's
decision and the decision of the
United States Supreme Court in
Brandenburg must conclude that
the charges that Professor
Franklin's constitutional rights
were violated are clearly specious.
It is interesting that Justice
Douglas wrote a somewhat
confusing concurring opinion in

Brandenburg, supported in part
by Justice Black which could be
used to support Mr. Klein's views.
However, the fact that Justice
Douglas could only attract the
partial support of one additional
Justice for his concurring opinion
is another convincing argument
against Mr. Klein's statements.
After invoking Brandenburg,
Mr. Klein offers us the case of
Dan Siegel prosecuted speeches in
the peoples park incidents. After a
brief description of the speeches
made by Mr. Siegel, Klein states
"Siegel was prosecuted for both
speeches and in both cases he was
acquitted because his speeches
were not incitements."
I have several comments in this
area. First, how does Mr. Klein
know why Siegel was acquitted:
there are numerous possible
explanations including the one
that the prosecution simply failed
to prove its case.
Second, an acquittal is a
finding of fact, not a precedent of
Constitutional law. Thus, even
assuming Mr. Klein is correct in
assuming that Siegel was acquitted
because his speeches did not
constitute "incitement," this
factual finding is irrelevant to
interpreting the meaning of the
Supreme Court's decision in
Brandenburg.
Third, Mr. Klein himself admits
that Siegel was suspended for his
speeches and that he has so far
been unsuccessful in seeking
judicial relief for this
administrative action by the
University of California.
In passing, I must add that it
amazed me that a graduate of
Harvard Law school would baldly
cite an acquittal in a criminal case
as binding constitutional
precedent. Any student who
relied on such a verdict to support
his opinions in even a basic law
school course in Constitutional
Law would not expect a passing
grade.
The third case used by Mr.
Klein in support of his
contentions was Cox v. Louisiana,
(379 U.S. 566 and 379 U.S. 559).
It is interesting that Mr. Klein
neglected to inform his readers
that there were really two cases
arising out of the same series of
incidents which were decided by
the court on the same day. More
important, the Cox cases were
decided over five years before the
court's opinion in Brandenburg
and Cox does not deal with the
incitement problems raised by
Brandenburg and the decision in
the Franklin case.
In his article, Mr. Klein stated
that "in Cox, during civil rights
protests . . . Reverand Cox told
his listeners to go and sit-in
at . .. segregated lunch counters, a
command which was in violation
of state law. The Supreme Court
held that irrespective of the
lawfulness of the sit-in, Reverand
Cox's advocacy was lawful." This
is correct as far as it goes.
However, Mr. Klein neglected to
disclose the following information
and distinctions contained in the
Cox opinions:
1. The statute under which
Cox was convicted was not
concerned with incitement; rather

it was a state breach of the peace
statute. Indeed, the problems of
"incitement" are never directly
discussed by the court in Cox as
they were in Brandenburg five
years later.
2. The Louisiana breach of
peace statute was declared to be
unconstitutionally vague in its
overly broad scope precisely
because its language could be used
to punish the "mere advocacy"
which was protected by the court
in Brandenburg.
3. Nowhere in the Cox cases
were there any allusion to
violence, the likelihood of
violence, or even the real
possibility of violence. Indeed, it
is clear from reading the opinion
that all parties recognized that
Reverand Cox's speeches and
conduct posed little danger of
provoking or causing violence.
In conclusion, it is my opinion
that Mr. Klein's contention that

the Advisory Board's decision
clearly deprives Bruce Franklin of
his first amendment rights in view
of the three cases cited by Joel
Klein, himself, is false.
While the problems of
"incitement" raised in
Brandenburg are complex and
uncertain areas of Constitutional
law, Mr. Klein's simplistic
discussion of these problems in on
an incredibly low level.
Unlike Mr. Klein, I do not
expect the readers of my article to
trust my unsupported statements.
Anyone who has doubts about my
views can easily go to the law
library on the third floor of the
law school and ask the librarians
or any law student to locate the
cases involved.
