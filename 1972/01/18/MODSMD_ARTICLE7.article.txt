# Freedom Or Anarchy
## 
### 
The following editorial is reprinted from the January 10 edition of
the Los Angeles Times.
In recommending the dismissal of Associate Prof. H. Bruce
Franklin, a Stanford University faculty board acted in defense of
academic freedom, not against it.
Franklin's reaction to the recommendation reaffirmed the board's
wisdom. He called for a campus-wide disruption of classes in protest.
"If they (the faculty hearing board) can deny me the right to teach,
then students should deny them the right to teach," he said over the
campus radio.
This view, if sincerely held, is an ingenuous misconception of the
issue, but even so, intellectual innocence is hardly an excuse for an
open appeal to violence. More likely the comment was intended to
rally the academic community to a bad cause under a good name.
Careful distinction must be made when the principle of academic
freedom is raised. Franklin's right to teach was not in question. His
right, as a self-proclaimed revolutionary, to disrupt the campus and
impose his views by force on others, was the issue. His actions were
antithetical to academic freedom and the spirit of free inquiry.
The hearing board found that he incited the occupation of a
campus computer center, urged defiance of a police order to disperse,
and called for "violent and illegal behavior" at a subsequent rally.
The university acted with scrupulous attention to Franklin's rights
and the merits of the case. Seventy-nine witnesses were heard in his
defense and the meticulous hearing lasted six weeks. To confuse
Franklin's behavior with academic freedom would impose a strain on
the most credulous mind.
