Choking Ourselves
Editor, THE DAILY:
Perhaps there are other
students here at Stanford who,
like me, have been jolted from
their former states of apathy by
the decisions of President Lyman
and the Advisory Board regarding
the dismissal of Bruce Franklin.
I was astounded by Chris
Hocker's article (Daily, Jan 11)
which equated this university to
a big business concern, and
revolted by the attitude of
Eustacia Su in her letter to the
Editor in the same issue.
What is the role of a professor
in this, or any university? Must
he agree with the policies of the
administration simply because he
is their employee and could be
fired for a display of dissent?
Has our democratic system so
perverted itself that it will
guiltlessly refute its own ideals?
In one of my classes, a few
days ago, a professor mentioned
the Franklin case unprompted
and was immediately
cold-shouldered by the students.
I'm sure that everyone knew
what was happening, but nobody

(including myself) cared enough
even to discuss the issue! I think
that we are choking ourselves
with apathy and the happy
dream of academic freedom.
How can we allow Bruce
Franklin to be dismissed?
And Eustacia, don't you think
that's beside the point?
Ellen Brodsky,

Destructive Action
Editor, THE DAILY:
The issue of Professor
Franklin's dismissal is
immeasurably complex and, at
bottom, very simple, A man can
survive only if, in a crisis, he is
willing to make a total choice. If
someone declares himself his
enemy and directly threatens his
life, he must respond accordingly,
choosing his survival over that of
his foe.
At Stanford it was our
institutional life that was directly
threatened. War had been declared
by Franklin and his followers. Not
an all-out war as yet, but the
beginnings of one, with weapons

brandished and sporadic violence.
"Charity begins at home" was
never truer. If a man, in this kind
of situation, cannot find his way
to the wellsprings of self-loyalty
and, by extension, loyalty to his
family, his allies, his university,
then he is in deep spiritual
trouble. Not the Franklins: they
know who they are. But the
fence-sitters, the sentimentally
confused, the mealy-mouthed
promulgators of bad faith, these
are doing real harm to their selves
and their vocations.
All the prattle about political
persecution, violation of freedom
of speech and the like is
meaningless in the face of this
root human drama. Not that these
are negligable entities, not that a
university can ever relax in its
endless quest for freedom of
expression, however unpopular.
But destructive action is
another matter entirely; tolerance
implies some minimum bond of
coexistence; it ceases when
confronted with a revolver.
Robert G. Cohn,

Foray Into Comedy
Editor, THE DAILY:
Having always enjoyed a bit of
irony, I found John Merryman's
letter of January 17, 1972 highly
amusing.
Especially enjoyable was
paragraph four wherein he writes,
"The Advisory Board Report may
be more important for its style
and quality than for the substance
of its recommendation. . . How
like Russell Baker! Certainly, why
consider issue and content when
there are style and structure to
worry over.
However, Merry man may have
stretched humor slightly in the
final paragraph where he speaks of
the "lasting value of the Advisory
Board Report" having set a
precedent for "respectable
level(s)" of inquisitions.
But for a lawyer's first foray
into comedy, it was an
applaudable performance. After
all, no one in his right mind could
have read or written that piece
seriously.

Has our democratic system so
perverted itself that it will
guiltlessly refute its own ideals?
In one of my classes, a few
days ago, a professor mentioned
the Franklin case unprompted
and was immediately
cold-shouldered by the students.
I'm sure that everyone knew
what was happening, but nobody

(including myself) cared enough
even to discuss the issue! I think
that we are choking ourselves

Franklin to be dismissed?

The issue of Professor
Franklin's dismissal is
immeasurably complex and, at
bottom, very simple, A man can
survive only if, in a crisis, he is
willing to make a total choice. If
someone declares himself his
enemy and directly threatens his
life, he must respond accordingly,
choosing his survival over that of
his foe.
At Stanford it was our
institutional life that was directly
threatened. War had been declared
by Franklin and his followers. Not
an all-out war as yet, but the
beginnings of one, with weapons

brandished and sporadic violence.
"Charity begins at home" was
never truer. If a man, in this kind
of situation, cannot find his way
to the wellsprings of self-loyalty
and, by extension, loyalty to his
family, his allies, his university,
then he is in deep spiritual
trouble. Not the Franklins: they
know who they are. But the
fence-sitters, the sentimentally
confused, the mealy-mouthed
promulgators of bad faith, these
are doing real harm to their selves
and their vocations.
All the prattle about political
persecution, violation of freedom
of speech and the like is
meaningless in the face of this
root human drama. Not that these
are negligable entities, not that a
university can ever relax in its
endless quest for freedom of
expression, however unpopular.
But destructive action is
another matter entirely; tolerance
implies some minimum bond of
coexistence; it ceases when
confronted with a revolver.

Having always enjoyed a bit of
irony, I found John Merryman's
letter of January 17, 1972 highly
amusing.
Especially enjoyable was
paragraph four wherein he writes,
"The Advisory Board Report may
be more important for its style
and quality than for the substance
of its recommendation. . . How
like Russell Baker! Certainly, why
consider issue and content when
there are style and structure to
worry over.
However, Merry man may have
stretched humor slightly in the
final paragraph where he speaks of
the "lasting value of the Advisory
Board Report" having set a
precedent for "respectable
level(s)" of inquisitions.
But for a lawyer's first foray
into comedy, it was an
applaudable performance. After
all, no one in his right mind could
have read or written that piece
seriously.

Perhaps there are other
students here at Stanford who,
like me, have been jolted from
their former states of apathy by
the decisions of President Lyman
and the Advisory Board regarding
the dismissal of Bruce Franklin.
I was astounded by Chris
Hocker's article (Daily, Jan 11)
which equated this university to
a big business concern, and
revolted by the attitude of
Eustacia Su in her letter to the
Editor in the same issue.
What is the role of a professor
in this, or any university? Must
he agree with the policies of the
administration simply because he
is their employee and could be
fired for a display of dissent?
