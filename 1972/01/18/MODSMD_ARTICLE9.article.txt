## Effects Of Military Funding 
### 
Last Friday at Stanford, Daniel
Ellsberg put the question: "How
do you end a war thats gone on
for twenty five years?". In
discussing the problem of
Stanford's dependence on
Department of Defense funding I
would like to suggest that we
should ask ourselves a related and
perhaps even more elusive

question: "how do you tame the
many-headed hydra of the
Pentagon?"
One should not forget that the
10 million dollars worth of DoD
sponsored research at Stanford,
ably documented in the recent
SWOPSI report of that title, is
merely a tip of the 70 billion
dollar iceberg of Pentagon
Capitalism. In volume 2 of the
SWOPSI report, the authors argue
that the influence of the military
has skewed the direction of
research at Stanford.
In fact this same phenomenon
pervades the whole of American
Society. Seymour Melman in his
book "Pentagon Capitalism"
shows how a whole generation of
engineers has been channeled
towards defense-related industries,
so that industries such as
ship-building and transistor radios
have lost out to Japanese
competition. In this respect
Stanford, during its years of
growth to its present
"Multiversity" era, merely
reflected the economic imbalances
of the nation as a whole.
The notable work of Frederick

Terman in fostering Stanford's
growth may be regarded in this
light as a result (a particularly
successful result) of the logic of
history. In Clark Kerr's words
"The idea of the Multi
versity ... is an imperative rather
than a reasoned choice among
elegant alternatives."
In discussing the character of
DoD influence on the
development of research at
Stanford it is important to
emphasize that the quality of the
work, assessed on a purely
scientific and technical basis is, if
anything, enhanced by the
imaginative way in which funds
are administered by the agencies
of the DoD.
However, in Melman's words
"a proper assessment of the
impact of DoD management on
University research is obtained
not merely by examining what
work is done, but by estimating
what work is not done". It is at
this level, rather than that of
questioning the quality of DoD
supported work that the skewing
effect of the Pentagon influence
on the Nation's economy and

seb doniach

ultimately on the University
becomes most apparent.
Is there any hope? I do feel
that the writers of the SWOPSI
report were unduly pessimistic
about the possibilities of changes
in research direction and funding.
In particular they did not try to
find what attempts are being
made by faculty members to
change over to non-military
support. In fact, perhaps in
response, again, to outside
pressures and directions both in
Congress and publicly for more
concern for environmental and
domestic problems, there are an
appreciable number of people
switching over at least partly to
non-military support.
This is not to say that DoD
funding is going to dissappear
overnight. It is likely to be a
principal source of University
support in this country for years
to come. So despite some
inadequacies of the SWOPSI
report (I particularly feel that the
report's emphasis on
the—perfectly natural—differences
in motivation between the DoD
sponsors and the faculty
investigators is misleading) I feel
that this report and others of its
kind will continue to be
important in highlighting ways in
which the serious national disease
of military dominance in our
society impinges directly on the
Stanford community.

for twenty five years?". In
discussing the problem of
Stanford's dependence on
Department of Defense funding I
would like to suggest that we
should ask ourselves a related and
perhaps even more elusive

question: "how do you tame the
many-headed hydra of the
Pentagon?"
One should not forget that the
10 million dollars worth of DoD
sponsored research at Stanford,
ably documented in the recent
SWOPSI report of that title, is
merely a tip of the 70 billion
dollar iceberg of Pentagon
Capitalism. In volume 2 of the
SWOPSI report, the authors argue
that the influence of the military
has skewed the direction of
research at Stanford.
In fact this same phenomenon
pervades the whole of American
Society. Seymour Melman in his
book "Pentagon Capitalism"
shows how a whole generation of
engineers has been channeled
towards defense-related industries,
so that industries such as
ship-building and transistor radios
have lost out to Japanese
competition. In this respect
Stanford, during its years of
growth to its present
"Multiversity" era, merely
reflected the economic imbalances
of the nation as a whole.
The notable work of Frederick

Terman in fostering Stanford's
growth may be regarded in this
light as a result (a particularly
successful result) of the logic of
history. In Clark Kerr's words
"The idea of the Multi
versity ... is an imperative rather
than a reasoned choice among
elegant alternatives."
In discussing the character of
DoD influence on the
development of research at
Stanford it is important to
emphasize that the quality of the
work, assessed on a purely
scientific and technical basis is, if
anything, enhanced by the
imaginative way in which funds
are administered by the agencies
of the DoD.
However, in Melman's words
"a proper assessment of the
impact of DoD management on
University research is obtained
not merely by examining what
work is done, but by estimating
what work is not done". It is at
this level, rather than that of
questioning the quality of DoD
supported work that the skewing
effect of the Pentagon influence
on the Nation's economy and

seb doniach

ultimately on the University
becomes most apparent.
Is there any hope? I do feel
that the writers of the SWOPSI
report were unduly pessimistic
about the possibilities of changes
in research direction and funding.
In particular they did not try to
find what attempts are being
made by faculty members to
change over to non-military
support. In fact, perhaps in
response, again, to outside
pressures and directions both in
Congress and publicly for more
concern for environmental and
domestic problems, there are an
appreciable number of people
switching over at least partly to
non-military support.
This is not to say that DoD
funding is going to dissappear
overnight. It is likely to be a
principal source of University
support in this country for years
to come. So despite some
inadequacies of the SWOPSI
report (I particularly feel that the
report's emphasis on
the—perfectly natural—differences
in motivation between the DoD
sponsors and the faculty
investigators is misleading) I feel
that this report and others of its
kind will continue to be
important in highlighting ways in
which the serious national disease
of military dominance in our
society impinges directly on the
Stanford community.
