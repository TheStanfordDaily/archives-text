# Trustees Reject Meeting, Referendum Opens Today
## 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
The Board of Trustees has rejected a
student Senate resolution calling for
an open meeting of the Board on
campus as polls open today for the
student referendum on the Franklin
issue.
In a letter to Student Senate
Chairman James Jefferson dated
January 18, Trustee Chairman Robert
Minge Brown said that the University's
Statement on Policy and Tenure "does
not call for the Board of Trustees to
hear new evidence or to reweigh
evidence, and the Board of Trustees
does not believe it would be proper to
do so."
A similar letter was sent to the
Stanford Rehabilitation Movement
(SRM) who had also asked the
Trustees to come to an open meeting
this Friday afternoon in Cubberley.
However, Trustee and former ASSU
President Dennis Hayes has indicated
he will come to the meeting. Possibly
one other Trustee will also attend.
Referendum Begins
Polling places will be open from 10
a.m. to 4 p.m. today and tomorrow.
Students are being asked to vote yes or
no on: "Resolved: that Bruce Franklin
should be retained as a professor at the
University."
Also today SRM is planning a 1
p.m. demonstration at the Placement
Center to protest Marine recruiters
interviewing there.
In a statement released last night,
four students currently charged before
the Campus Judicial Panel for
disrupting the Placement Center over
recruiting last November said "we plan
to enforce international principles and
the expressed will of the Stanford

students tomorrow at the Placement
Center."
The students are Paul Loeb, Peter
Knutson, Don Lee and Steve Downey.
They added "Tomorrow Richard
Lyman is again disrupting Stanford
University by bringing the Marine
Corps to the Placement Center ... We
urge and incite all people to bring the
Marine recruiters out of our Placement
Center!"
Frances Holstander of the
Placement Center confirmed last night
that four interviews were scheduled
for this afternoon but added, "I must
say that most of those on the list are
not interested in joining the Marines as
a career."
The Placement Center
demonstration will follow a noon
White Plaza rally sponsored by the
Faculty Political Action Group
(FPAG). About 20 to 60 professors
are expected to discuss why they
oppose the Franklin decision.
In other events concerning the
Franklin case, anti-war activist David
Harris is scheduled to speak on campus
Friday night against the Franklin
decision. There is also a possibility
Franklin himself might speak. The
decision will probably be made at a
SRM coordinating committee meeting
Thursday afternoon after Franklin's

class in Columbae House.
A court injunction currently bans
Franklin from the campus while he is
suspended. He could face up to six
months in jail for violation of the
injunction.
Saturday Demo
On Saturday, SRM has called for a
show of support for Franklin at a
meeting of the Trustees in San
Francisco. At that time the Board will
consider Lyman's recommendation to
accept the Advisory Board's
recommendation that Franklin be
dismissed.
FPAG has also written the Trustees
requesting time to present arguments
before the Board that they felt the
Board might not be familiar with.
Sunday dorm meetings are planned
with a mass meeting scheduled for
Monday evening.
Franklin supporters also began
shadowing Advisory Board members
yesterday.
Guest Professor of Social Thought
and pro-Franklin activist Dave
Josephson said that a week ago letters
were sent to Advisory Board members
asking them to explain their decision
to the community. Josephson said that
four Board members replied and said
they couldn't respond for numerous

reasons, including legal. Franklin plans
a suit in the courts.
But Josephson said that as of
yesterday, Advisory Board members
will be followed by someone carrying
a sign saying that "this man has made
a decision that affects your life." The
signs also urge people to ask the
member about the decision.
Josephson stressed the non-violence
of the action and added that the signs
say nothing about the correctness of
the Board's decision.
Polling Places
Polling places for today's
referendum are located at the
Engineering Corner, Post Office,
Physics Tank, Law School Lounge,
Med Center, and Computation Center.
The Council of Presidents issued a
statement saying, "We urge all
Stanford students to vote in the
referendum election Wednesday and
Thursday of this week. It is our
position that scrutiny of the actual
facts of the Franklin affair will lead
one to vote that Professor Franklin
should be rehired.
"The principle of academic freedom
is too fragile and valuable to be
sacrificed simply because the
University disagrees with one man's
political philosophy. It is crucial that
the students at Stanford make a stand
for the principle of free speech in the
interests of students throughout the
United States."

yesterday.
Guest Professor of Social Thought
and pro-Franklin activist Dave
Josephson said that a week ago letters
were sent to Advisory Board members

to the community. Josephson said that
four Board members replied and said
they couldn't respond for numerous

reasons, including legal. Franklin plans
a suit in the courts.
But Josephson said that as of
yesterday, Advisory Board members
will be followed by someone carrying
a sign saying that "this man has made
a decision that affects your life." The
signs also urge people to ask the
member about the decision.
Josephson stressed the non-violence
of the action and added that the signs
say nothing about the correctness of
the Board's decision.
Polling Places
Polling places for today's
referendum are located at the
Engineering Corner, Post Office,
Physics Tank, Law School Lounge,
Med Center, and Computation Center.
The Council of Presidents issued a
statement saying, "We urge all
Stanford students to vote in the
referendum election Wednesday and
Thursday of this week. It is our
position that scrutiny of the actual
facts of the Franklin affair will lead
one to vote that Professor Franklin
should be rehired.
"The principle of academic freedom
is too fragile and valuable to be
sacrificed simply because the
University disagrees with one man's
political philosophy. It is crucial that
the students at Stanford make a stand
for the principle of free speech in the
interests of students throughout the
United States."
The Board of Trustees has rejected a
student Senate resolution calling for
an open meeting of the Board on
campus as polls open today for the
student referendum on the Franklin
issue.
In a letter to Student Senate
Chairman James Jefferson dated
January 18, Trustee Chairman Robert
Minge Brown said that the University's
Statement on Policy and Tenure "does
not call for the Board of Trustees to
hear new evidence or to reweigh
evidence, and the Board of Trustees
does not believe it would be proper to
do so."
A similar letter was sent to the
Stanford Rehabilitation Movement
(SRM) who had also asked the
Trustees to come to an open meeting
this Friday afternoon in Cubberley.
However, Trustee and former ASSU
President Dennis Hayes has indicated
he will come to the meeting. Possibly
one other Trustee will also attend.
Referendum Begins
Polling places will be open from 10
a.m. to 4 p.m. today and tomorrow.
Students are being asked to vote yes or
no on: "Resolved: that Bruce Franklin
should be retained as a professor at the
University."
Also today SRM is planning a 1
p.m. demonstration at the Placement
Center to protest Marine recruiters
interviewing there.
In a statement released last night,
four students currently charged before
the Campus Judicial Panel for
disrupting the Placement Center over
recruiting last November said "we plan
to enforce international principles and
the expressed will of the Stanford

students tomorrow at the Placement
Center."
The students are Paul Loeb, Peter
Knutson, Don Lee and Steve Downey.
They added "Tomorrow Richard
Lyman is again disrupting Stanford
University by bringing the Marine
Corps to the Placement Center ... We
urge and incite all people to bring the
Marine recruiters out of our Placement
Center!"
Frances Holstander of the
Placement Center confirmed last night
that four interviews were scheduled
for this afternoon but added, "I must
say that most of those on the list are
not interested in joining the Marines as
a career."
The Placement Center
demonstration will follow a noon
White Plaza rally sponsored by the
Faculty Political Action Group
(FPAG). About 20 to 60 professors
are expected to discuss why they
oppose the Franklin decision.
In other events concerning the
Franklin case, anti-war activist David
Harris is scheduled to speak on campus
Friday night against the Franklin
decision. There is also a possibility
Franklin himself might speak. The
decision will probably be made at a
SRM coordinating committee meeting
Thursday afternoon after Franklin's

class in Columbae House.
A court injunction currently bans
Franklin from the campus while he is
suspended. He could face up to six
months in jail for violation of the
injunction.

a.m. to 4 p.m. today and tomorrow.
Students are being asked to vote yes or
no on: "Resolved: that Bruce Franklin
should be retained as a professor at the
University."
Also today SRM is planning a 1
p.m. demonstration at the Placement
Center to protest Marine recruiters
interviewing there.
In a statement released last night,
four students currently charged before
the Campus Judicial Panel for
disrupting the Placement Center over
recruiting last November said "we plan
to enforce international principles and
the expressed will of the Stanford

students tomorrow at the Placement
Center."
The students are Paul Loeb, Peter
Knutson, Don Lee and Steve Downey.
They added "Tomorrow Richard
Lyman is again disrupting Stanford
University by bringing the Marine
Corps to the Placement Center ... We
urge and incite all people to bring the
Marine recruiters out of our Placement
Center!"
Frances Holstander of the
Placement Center confirmed last night
that four interviews were scheduled
for this afternoon but added, "I must
say that most of those on the list are
not interested in joining the Marines as
a career."
The Placement Center
demonstration will follow a noon
White Plaza rally sponsored by the
Faculty Political Action Group
(FPAG). About 20 to 60 professors
are expected to discuss why they
oppose the Franklin decision.
In other events concerning the
Franklin case, anti-war activist David
Harris is scheduled to speak on campus
Friday night against the Franklin
decision. There is also a possibility
Franklin himself might speak. The
decision will probably be made at a
SRM coordinating committee meeting
Thursday afternoon after Franklin's

class in Columbae House.
A court injunction currently bans
Franklin from the campus while he is
suspended. He could face up to six
months in jail for violation of the
injunction.
Saturday Demo
On Saturday, SRM has called for a
show of support for Franklin at a
meeting of the Trustees in San
Francisco. At that time the Board will
consider Lyman's recommendation to
accept the Advisory Board's
recommendation that Franklin be
dismissed.
FPAG has also written the Trustees
requesting time to present arguments
before the Board that they felt the
Board might not be familiar with.
Sunday dorm meetings are planned
with a mass meeting scheduled for
Monday evening.
Franklin supporters also began
shadowing Advisory Board members
yesterday.
Guest Professor of Social Thought
and pro-Franklin activist Dave
Josephson said that a week ago letters
were sent to Advisory Board members
asking them to explain their decision
to the community. Josephson said that
four Board members replied and said
they couldn't respond for numerous

reasons, including legal. Franklin plans
a suit in the courts.
But Josephson said that as of
yesterday, Advisory Board members
will be followed by someone carrying
a sign saying that "this man has made
a decision that affects your life." The
signs also urge people to ask the
member about the decision.
Josephson stressed the non-violence
of the action and added that the signs
say nothing about the correctness of
the Board's decision.
Polling Places
Polling places for today's
referendum are located at the
Engineering Corner, Post Office,
Physics Tank, Law School Lounge,
Med Center, and Computation Center.
The Council of Presidents issued a
statement saying, "We urge all
Stanford students to vote in the
referendum election Wednesday and
Thursday of this week. It is our
position that scrutiny of the actual
facts of the Franklin affair will lead
one to vote that Professor Franklin
should be rehired.
"The principle of academic freedom
is too fragile and valuable to be
sacrificed simply because the
University disagrees with one man's
political philosophy. It is crucial that
the students at Stanford make a stand
for the principle of free speech in the
interests of students throughout the
United States."
