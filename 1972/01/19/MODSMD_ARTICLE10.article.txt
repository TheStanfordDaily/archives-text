## A 						Student Voice? 
### 
Bruce Franklin will be fired on Saturday.
No matter what the outcome of the student referendum
today and tomorrow concerning the Advisory Board
decision, the University Board of Trustees has made it clear
that they will not be swayed by student input on the
Franklin question. They have rejected the idea of holding an
on-campus open meeting to hear community views even
though those most affected by Franklin's dismissal have had
no voice in the decision-making process.
The referendum, however, is not without meaning. The
decision of the Advisory Board and President Lyman has
received national attention and praise. Student response here
has been characterized as generally passive, except of course
for the expected rallies and demonstrations staged by
"radical followers of the Maoist professor."
We cannot afford to let this characterization go
unchallenged. The student referendum is the best available
way for the student body as a whole to educate not only the
Trustees but also the nation's press of their feelings about
the proposed dismissal.
Today's vote would not legitimize the decision-making
process used by the University in this case, but could serve
to demonstrate that the present mechanism in no way
represents the views of the largest segment of the Stanford
community. This referendum and indeed the entire Franklin
issue can only point out the woeful lack of student power
in the University-especially on issues of greatest
significance.
It must be remembered that a vote against the decision of
the Advisory Board recommendation is not necessarily a
vote for Franklin's ideas or political tactics. The overriding
issue is one of abridgement of the right of free speech.
As we have stated twice before, we believe Franklin's
firing both outrageous and dangerous. We urge support of
his right to speak and teach on campus, and strongly
recommend a vote for that cause.

Bruce Franklin will be fired on Saturday.
