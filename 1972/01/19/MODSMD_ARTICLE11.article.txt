Who should control Stanford?
Should it "become the property
of poor and working people," in
Bruce Franklin's imprecise words?
Should it be given back to the
Indians? Should it be run by an
amorphous town meeting of
everyone affected (whatever that
means) by Stanford activities?
Should it be run by a different
board of directors (perhaps with
each member drawn from an
organized special interest group
affected by Stanford, along the
lines of Mussolini's plan for social
organizations in fascist Italy)?
Who really has legitimate title
to the land here, and the
equipment? And who should be
making the decisions about its
use?
These questions, and others
along the same lines, lie at the
base of much of the troubles
Stanford University has
experienced since 1966.
To answer these questions
correctly will necessitate a foray
into the past history of the
University, a sort of title search,
but before that, it is important to
lay out the principles which will
inform our quest for the
legitimate owners of Stanford
University. Needless to say,
neither of the authors of this
essay considers it the final word
on the subject. All the needed
historical data is not in, and full

philosophical refinement has not
yet been achieved.
Legitimate Land-Owners
In radical libertarian social
theory, a legitimate title to land
(meaning any original,
nature-giving factor of
production) comes into existence
when a human being appropriates
and transforms such a natural
factor of production, when he
mixes his labor with it, cultivates
it, and makes it more useful. This
theory can thus be termed the
"first user, first owner" or
homesteading principle of land
tenure.
The first users of the land in
the Stanford area were the
Costanoan Indians who had
villages and settlements in the
region. These Indians are now
extinct or virtually extinct. But if
any survivors can show that their
ancestors came from Stanford
land, many libertarians would
support, as fully justified, their
claims to any land which had been
systematically cultivated by their
ancestors, or was the site of
permanent settlements of their
ancestors, just as many
libertarians support Tijerina's
efforts to reclaim the land-grants
in the State of New Mexico which
were stolen from the
Mexican-Americans' ancestors.
To return to the history of
Stanford University land, after the
Indians in the general area were
killed or enslaved, the land
eventually became ranchos, where
cattle-grazing (a form of
cultivation) gave the land-grant
holders homestead rights that
make their land titles valid under
libertarian social theory, except,
of course, these rancheros did not
have a right to that land on the
ranchos which had been taken
from the Indians.
This situation of rancho
holdings, which began around
1800, persisted in its
predominantly legitimate form
(property titles were voluntarily
exchanged) until Leland Stanford
came on the scene in 1876 and
bought the old Rancho San
Francisquito.
Stolen Wealth
At this point, the question of
legitimate ownership of Stanford
University land becomes further
complicated by the fact that
much of Leland Stanford's wealth
was based on stolen (and thus
morally illegitimate) property
titles.
As one of the Big Four of the

Central Pacific Railroad, Leland
Stanford acquired vast wealth
through government subsidies
(money stolen from people
through taxes). Also, feudalistic
land monopoly grants from the
government gave him land not
acquired through transforming it
from a state of nature.
These government grants
consisted of alternate sections of
land to the side of the path of the
railway. By extracting payments
from legitimate homesteaders on
this land and by securing
government protection from
commercial rivals, Stanford
increased his fortune.
The consequence of Leland
Stanford's dealings, as far as
legitimate title to Stanford
University is concerned, is that
the true owners of at least part of
the University are those from
whom Senator Stanford had
coercively taken his wealth. Their
heirs still have a claim on the
University.
Libertarian social theory must
also be utilized if we wish to
understand and explain the
modern era in which we find
Stanford University thoroughly
enmeshed with the national
government and the
Military-Industrial Complex.
In the post-war period Stanford
University has become heavily
dependent on funds taken from
taxpayers. Yet nowhere do we
find faculty members asking what
makes their personal intellectual
work so important that it justifies
stealing from others.
Government Funds
Total national government
obligations to the University were,
for example, $52.7 million in
1968, $53.7 million in 1969, and
$53.4 million in 1970, with
additional funds going to the
Linear Accelerator and the
Medical Center. This total
included money for research,
buildings, and other projects.
National government funding
of research reached a high of
$46.1 million in 1968, with an
additional $25.6 million to the
Linear Accelerator.
In a recent KZSU radio
interview, William Massey stated
that over 80 percent of the money
for "specific line of inquiry"
research comes from the national
government.
Furthermore, much additional
money that Stanford receives
comes from the Military-Industrial
Complex, which lives off of

government funds. (Money
coming from the Military-Indus
trial Complex and the Department
of Defense is doubly evil. It not
only has its source in aggression
against the tax-burden citizens,
but it has as its direct aim further
violence and aggression.)
All of this government money
doesn't come from nowhere. The
government is not a productive
entity. It can only obtain wealth
by stealing from productive
citizens.
So far we have been treating
Stanford University as a sort of
bloodless entity. But in reality,
Stanford is controlled by flesh
and blood individuals. Just as
there are taxpayer-victims in the
financing of Stanford and
Vietnamese victims of some of the
research done at Stanford,
likewise there are real flesh and
blood victimizers who benefit
from the system as it is and act to
perpetuate its existence.
Much de facto control over the
University as an institution
control over hiring, firing,
research, and curriculum—lies in
the hands of faculty members.
Structurally this is natural because
of below-cost pricing in student
tuition, because of the design and
job-description impressed upon
this educational institution by
Jane and Leland Stanford, and
because of the subsidy to the
faculty of money extracted from
taxpayers. Additional power is
wielded by the government itself
and by the University
administration (which largely
reflects faculty views). The
trustees are supervisors, drawn
from and representing the elite
elements of the exploiting caste
based on stolen wealth.
Redistribution of Property
Who should control Stanford?
The victims of those who control
Stanford have just claims against

them, claims which can and
should be met, in part, by giving
those victims title to land and
equipment at Stanford. Although
redistribution of Stanford
property to these people is
justified right now and should be
done immediately, this will
probably only become possible
when the general populace throws
off the yoke of the State.
What should we all be doing
now practically to achieve this
goal? At the very least attempts
can be made to liberate Stanford
from the influence and control of
the government and the ruling
predatory caste. The freeing of
Stanford includes not only an end
to direct government aid in the
form of research grants and
contracts, but an end to all
funding that arises out of the
University's ties with the
Military-Industrial Complex.
National Defense Education Act
loan funds ($1.4 million in 1968)
must be cut off.
Indeed the freeing of Stanford
calls for the severing of all
relationships in which the
violation of human rights serve
either as the basis or goal of those
relationships.
As a final matter, we must deal
with the contention, often voiced
at Stanford, that if you cut
Stanford off from the
government, the University will
not survive.
Well, if that is the case, if
Stanford does not have enough to
offer to induce its voluntary
support, if the existence of
Stanford University must be based
on the coercive violation of men's
rights, if it cannot survive unless it
has a part in the killing of
innocent people, if it cannot
survive without money stolen
from innocent victims, then
Stanford should not survive.
Who should control Stanford?
Should it "become the property
of poor and working people," in
Bruce Franklin's imprecise words?
Should it be given back to the
Indians? Should it be run by an
amorphous town meeting of
everyone affected (whatever that
means) by Stanford activities?
Should it be run by a different
board of directors (perhaps with
each member drawn from an
organized special interest group
affected by Stanford, along the
lines of Mussolini's plan for social
organizations in fascist Italy)?
Who really has legitimate title
to the land here, and the
equipment? And who should be
making the decisions about its
use?

Much de facto control over the
University as an institution
control over hiring, firing,
research, and curriculum—lies in
the hands of faculty members.
Structurally this is natural because
of below-cost pricing in student

job-description impressed upon
this educational institution by
Jane and Leland Stanford, and
because of the subsidy to the
faculty of money extracted from

wielded by the government itself
and by the University

Redistribution of Property
Who should control Stanford?
The victims of those who control
Stanford have just claims against

them, claims which can and
should be met, in part, by giving
those victims title to land and
equipment at Stanford. Although
redistribution of Stanford
property to these people is
justified right now and should be
done immediately, this will
probably only become possible
when the general populace throws
off the yoke of the State.
What should we all be doing
now practically to achieve this
goal? At the very least attempts
can be made to liberate Stanford
from the influence and control of
the government and the ruling
predatory caste. The freeing of
Stanford includes not only an end
to direct government aid in the
form of research grants and
contracts, but an end to all
funding that arises out of the
University's ties with the
Military-Industrial Complex.
National Defense Education Act
loan funds ($1.4 million in 1968)
must be cut off.
Indeed the freeing of Stanford
calls for the severing of all
relationships in which the
violation of human rights serve
either as the basis or goal of those
relationships.
As a final matter, we must deal
with the contention, often voiced
at Stanford, that if you cut
Stanford off from the
government, the University will
not survive.
Well, if that is the case, if
Stanford does not have enough to
offer to induce its voluntary
support, if the existence of
Stanford University must be based
on the coercive violation of men's
rights, if it cannot survive unless it
has a part in the killing of
innocent people, if it cannot
survive without money stolen
from innocent victims, then
Stanford should not survive.
Who should control Stanford?
Should it "become the property
of poor and working people," in
Bruce Franklin's imprecise words?
Should it be given back to the
Indians? Should it be run by an
amorphous town meeting of
everyone affected (whatever that
means) by Stanford activities?
Should it be run by a different
board of directors (perhaps with
each member drawn from an
organized special interest group
affected by Stanford, along the
lines of Mussolini's plan for social
organizations in fascist Italy)?
Who really has legitimate title
to the land here, and the
equipment? And who should be
making the decisions about its
use?
These questions, and others
along the same lines, lie at the
base of much of the troubles
Stanford University has
experienced since 1966.
To answer these questions
correctly will necessitate a foray
into the past history of the
University, a sort of title search,
but before that, it is important to
lay out the principles which will
inform our quest for the
legitimate owners of Stanford
University. Needless to say,
neither of the authors of this
essay considers it the final word
on the subject. All the needed
historical data is not in, and full

philosophical refinement has not
yet been achieved.
Legitimate Land-Owners
In radical libertarian social
theory, a legitimate title to land
(meaning any original,
nature-giving factor of
production) comes into existence
when a human being appropriates
and transforms such a natural
factor of production, when he
mixes his labor with it, cultivates
it, and makes it more useful. This
theory can thus be termed the
"first user, first owner" or
homesteading principle of land
tenure.
The first users of the land in
the Stanford area were the
Costanoan Indians who had
villages and settlements in the
region. These Indians are now
extinct or virtually extinct. But if
any survivors can show that their
ancestors came from Stanford
land, many libertarians would
support, as fully justified, their
claims to any land which had been
systematically cultivated by their
ancestors, or was the site of
permanent settlements of their
ancestors, just as many
libertarians support Tijerina's
efforts to reclaim the land-grants
in the State of New Mexico which
were stolen from the
Mexican-Americans' ancestors.
To return to the history of
Stanford University land, after the
Indians in the general area were
killed or enslaved, the land
eventually became ranchos, where
cattle-grazing (a form of
cultivation) gave the land-grant
holders homestead rights that
make their land titles valid under
libertarian social theory, except,
of course, these rancheros did not
have a right to that land on the
ranchos which had been taken
from the Indians.
This situation of rancho
holdings, which began around
1800, persisted in its
predominantly legitimate form
(property titles were voluntarily
exchanged) until Leland Stanford
came on the scene in 1876 and
bought the old Rancho San
Francisquito.
Stolen Wealth
At this point, the question of
legitimate ownership of Stanford
University land becomes further
complicated by the fact that
much of Leland Stanford's wealth
was based on stolen (and thus
morally illegitimate) property
titles.
As one of the Big Four of the

Central Pacific Railroad, Leland
Stanford acquired vast wealth
through government subsidies
(money stolen from people
through taxes). Also, feudalistic
land monopoly grants from the
government gave him land not
acquired through transforming it
from a state of nature.
These government grants
consisted of alternate sections of
land to the side of the path of the
railway. By extracting payments
from legitimate homesteaders on
this land and by securing
government protection from
commercial rivals, Stanford
increased his fortune.
The consequence of Leland
Stanford's dealings, as far as
legitimate title to Stanford
University is concerned, is that
the true owners of at least part of
the University are those from
whom Senator Stanford had
coercively taken his wealth. Their
heirs still have a claim on the
University.
Libertarian social theory must
also be utilized if we wish to
understand and explain the
modern era in which we find
Stanford University thoroughly
enmeshed with the national
government and the
Military-Industrial Complex.
In the post-war period Stanford
University has become heavily
dependent on funds taken from
taxpayers. Yet nowhere do we
find faculty members asking what
makes their personal intellectual
work so important that it justifies
stealing from others.
Government Funds
Total national government
obligations to the University were,
for example, $52.7 million in
1968, $53.7 million in 1969, and
$53.4 million in 1970, with
additional funds going to the
Linear Accelerator and the
Medical Center. This total
included money for research,
buildings, and other projects.
National government funding
of research reached a high of
$46.1 million in 1968, with an
additional $25.6 million to the
Linear Accelerator.
In a recent KZSU radio
interview, William Massey stated
that over 80 percent of the money
for "specific line of inquiry"
research comes from the national
government.
Furthermore, much additional
money that Stanford receives
comes from the Military-Industrial
Complex, which lives off of

government funds. (Money
coming from the Military-Indus
trial Complex and the Department
of Defense is doubly evil. It not
only has its source in aggression
against the tax-burden citizens,
but it has as its direct aim further
violence and aggression.)
All of this government money
doesn't come from nowhere. The
government is not a productive
entity. It can only obtain wealth
by stealing from productive
citizens.
So far we have been treating
Stanford University as a sort of
bloodless entity. But in reality,
Stanford is controlled by flesh
and blood individuals. Just as
there are taxpayer-victims in the
financing of Stanford and
Vietnamese victims of some of the
research done at Stanford,
likewise there are real flesh and
blood victimizers who benefit
from the system as it is and act to
perpetuate its existence.
Much de facto control over the
University as an institution
control over hiring, firing,
research, and curriculum—lies in
the hands of faculty members.
Structurally this is natural because
of below-cost pricing in student
tuition, because of the design and
job-description impressed upon
this educational institution by
Jane and Leland Stanford, and
because of the subsidy to the
faculty of money extracted from
taxpayers. Additional power is
wielded by the government itself

the true owners of at least part of
the University are those from
whom Senator Stanford had
coercively taken his wealth. Their
heirs still have a claim on the
University.
Libertarian social theory must
also be utilized if we wish to
understand and explain the
modern era in which we find
Stanford University thoroughly
enmeshed with the national
government and the
Military-Industrial Complex.
In the post-war period Stanford
University has become heavily
dependent on funds taken from
taxpayers. Yet nowhere do we
find faculty members asking what
makes their personal intellectual
work so important that it justifies
stealing from others.
Government Funds
Total national government
obligations to the University were,
for example, $52.7 million in
1968, $53.7 million in 1969, and
$53.4 million in 1970, with
additional funds going to the
Linear Accelerator and the
Medical Center. This total
included money for research,
buildings, and other projects.
National government funding
of research reached a high of
$46.1 million in 1968, with an
additional $25.6 million to the
Linear Accelerator.
In a recent KZSU radio
interview, William Massey stated
that over 80 percent of the money
for "specific line of inquiry"
research comes from the national
government.
Furthermore, much additional
money that Stanford receives
comes from the Military-Industrial
Complex, which lives off of

government funds. (Money
coming from the Military-Indus
trial Complex and the Department
of Defense is doubly evil. It not
only has its source in aggression
against the tax-burden citizens,
but it has as its direct aim further
violence and aggression.)
All of this government money
doesn't come from nowhere. The
government is not a productive
entity. It can only obtain wealth
by stealing from productive
citizens.
So far we have been treating
Stanford University as a sort of
bloodless entity. But in reality,
Stanford is controlled by flesh
and blood individuals. Just as
there are taxpayer-victims in the
financing of Stanford and
Vietnamese victims of some of the
research done at Stanford,
likewise there are real flesh and
blood victimizers who benefit
from the system as it is and act to
perpetuate its existence.
Much de facto control over the
University as an institution
control over hiring, firing,
research, and curriculum—lies in
the hands of faculty members.
Structurally this is natural because
of below-cost pricing in student
tuition, because of the design and
job-description impressed upon
this educational institution by
Jane and Leland Stanford, and
because of the subsidy to the
faculty of money extracted from
taxpayers. Additional power is
wielded by the government itself
and by the University
administration (which largely
reflects faculty views). The
trustees are supervisors, drawn
from and representing the elite
elements of the exploiting caste
based on stolen wealth.
Redistribution of Property
Who should control Stanford?
The victims of those who control
Stanford have just claims against

them, claims which can and
should be met, in part, by giving
those victims title to land and
equipment at Stanford. Although
redistribution of Stanford
property to these people is
justified right now and should be
done immediately, this will
probably only become possible
when the general populace throws
off the yoke of the State.
What should we all be doing
now practically to achieve this
goal? At the very least attempts
can be made to liberate Stanford
from the influence and control of
the government and the ruling
predatory caste. The freeing of
Stanford includes not only an end
to direct government aid in the
form of research grants and
contracts, but an end to all
funding that arises out of the
University's ties with the
Military-Industrial Complex.
National Defense Education Act
loan funds ($1.4 million in 1968)
must be cut off.
Indeed the freeing of Stanford
calls for the severing of all
relationships in which the
violation of human rights serve
either as the basis or goal of those
relationships.
As a final matter, we must deal
with the contention, often voiced
at Stanford, that if you cut
Stanford off from the
government, the University will
not survive.
Well, if that is the case, if
Stanford does not have enough to
offer to induce its voluntary
support, if the existence of
Stanford University must be based
on the coercive violation of men's
rights, if it cannot survive unless it
has a part in the killing of
innocent people, if it cannot
survive without money stolen
from innocent victims, then
Stanford should not survive.
Who should control Stanford?
Should it "become the property
of poor and working people," in
Bruce Franklin's imprecise words?
Should it be given back to the
Indians? Should it be run by an
amorphous town meeting of
everyone affected (whatever that
means) by Stanford activities?
Should it be run by a different
board of directors (perhaps with
each member drawn from an
organized special interest group
affected by Stanford, along the
lines of Mussolini's plan for social
organizations in fascist Italy)?
Who really has legitimate title
to the land here, and the
equipment? And who should be
making the decisions about its
use?
These questions, and others
along the same lines, lie at the
base of much of the troubles
Stanford University has
experienced since 1966.
To answer these questions
correctly will necessitate a foray
into the past history of the
University, a sort of title search,
but before that, it is important to
lay out the principles which will
inform our quest for the
legitimate owners of Stanford
University. Needless to say,
neither of the authors of this
essay considers it the final word
on the subject. All the needed
historical data is not in, and full

philosophical refinement has not
yet been achieved.
Legitimate Land-Owners
In radical libertarian social
theory, a legitimate title to land
(meaning any original,
nature-giving factor of
production) comes into existence
when a human being appropriates
and transforms such a natural
factor of production, when he
mixes his labor with it, cultivates
it, and makes it more useful. This
theory can thus be termed the
"first user, first owner" or
homesteading principle of land
tenure.
The first users of the land in
the Stanford area were the
Costanoan Indians who had
villages and settlements in the
region. These Indians are now
extinct or virtually extinct. But if
any survivors can show that their
ancestors came from Stanford
land, many libertarians would
support, as fully justified, their
claims to any land which had been
systematically cultivated by their
ancestors, or was the site of
permanent settlements of their
ancestors, just as many
libertarians support Tijerina's
efforts to reclaim the land-grants
in the State of New Mexico which
were stolen from the
Mexican-Americans' ancestors.
To return to the history of
Stanford University land, after the
Indians in the general area were
killed or enslaved, the land
eventually became ranchos, where
cattle-grazing (a form of
cultivation) gave the land-grant
holders homestead rights that
make their land titles valid under
libertarian social theory, except,
of course, these rancheros did not
have a right to that land on the
ranchos which had been taken
from the Indians.
This situation of rancho
holdings, which began around
1800, persisted in its
predominantly legitimate form
(property titles were voluntarily
exchanged) until Leland Stanford
came on the scene in 1876 and
bought the old Rancho San
Francisquito.
Stolen Wealth
At this point, the question of
legitimate ownership of Stanford
University land becomes further
complicated by the fact that
much of Leland Stanford's wealth
was based on stolen (and thus
morally illegitimate) property
titles.
As one of the Big Four of the

Central Pacific Railroad, Leland
Stanford acquired vast wealth
through government subsidies
(money stolen from people
through taxes). Also, feudalistic
land monopoly grants from the
government gave him land not
acquired through transforming it
from a state of nature.
These government grants
consisted of alternate sections of
land to the side of the path of the
railway. By extracting payments
from legitimate homesteaders on
this land and by securing
government protection from
commercial rivals, Stanford
increased his fortune.
The consequence of Leland
Stanford's dealings, as far as
legitimate title to Stanford
University is concerned, is that
the true owners of at least part of
the University are those from
whom Senator Stanford had
coercively taken his wealth. Their
heirs still have a claim on the
University.
Libertarian social theory must
also be utilized if we wish to
understand and explain the

theory can thus be termed the
"first user, first owner" or
homesteading principle of land
tenure.
The first users of the land in
the Stanford area were the
Costanoan Indians who had
villages and settlements in the
region. These Indians are now
extinct or virtually extinct. But if
any survivors can show that their
ancestors came from Stanford
land, many libertarians would
support, as fully justified, their
claims to any land which had been
systematically cultivated by their
ancestors, or was the site of
permanent settlements of their
ancestors, just as many
libertarians support Tijerina's
efforts to reclaim the land-grants
in the State of New Mexico which
were stolen from the
Mexican-Americans' ancestors.
To return to the history of
Stanford University land, after the
Indians in the general area were
killed or enslaved, the land
eventually became ranchos, where
cattle-grazing (a form of
cultivation) gave the land-grant
holders homestead rights that
make their land titles valid under
libertarian social theory, except,
of course, these rancheros did not
have a right to that land on the
ranchos which had been taken
from the Indians.
This situation of rancho
holdings, which began around
1800, persisted in its
predominantly legitimate form
(property titles were voluntarily
exchanged) until Leland Stanford
came on the scene in 1876 and
bought the old Rancho San
Francisquito.
Stolen Wealth
At this point, the question of
legitimate ownership of Stanford
University land becomes further
complicated by the fact that
much of Leland Stanford's wealth
was based on stolen (and thus
morally illegitimate) property
titles.
As one of the Big Four of the

Central Pacific Railroad, Leland
Stanford acquired vast wealth
through government subsidies
(money stolen from people
through taxes). Also, feudalistic
land monopoly grants from the
government gave him land not
acquired through transforming it
from a state of nature.
These government grants
consisted of alternate sections of
land to the side of the path of the
railway. By extracting payments
from legitimate homesteaders on
this land and by securing
government protection from
commercial rivals, Stanford
increased his fortune.
The consequence of Leland
Stanford's dealings, as far as
legitimate title to Stanford
University is concerned, is that
the true owners of at least part of
the University are those from
whom Senator Stanford had
coercively taken his wealth. Their
heirs still have a claim on the
University.
Libertarian social theory must
also be utilized if we wish to
understand and explain the
modern era in which we find
Stanford University thoroughly
enmeshed with the national
government and the
Military-Industrial Complex.
In the post-war period Stanford
University has become heavily
dependent on funds taken from
taxpayers. Yet nowhere do we
find faculty members asking what
makes their personal intellectual
work so important that it justifies
stealing from others.
Government Funds
Total national government
obligations to the University were,
for example, $52.7 million in
1968, $53.7 million in 1969, and
$53.4 million in 1970, with
additional funds going to the
Linear Accelerator and the
Medical Center. This total
included money for research,
buildings, and other projects.
National government funding
of research reached a high of
$46.1 million in 1968, with an
additional $25.6 million to the
Linear Accelerator.
In a recent KZSU radio
interview, William Massey stated
that over 80 percent of the money
for "specific line of inquiry"
research comes from the national
government.
Furthermore, much additional
money that Stanford receives
comes from the Military-Industrial
Complex, which lives off of

government funds. (Money
coming from the Military-Indus
trial Complex and the Department
of Defense is doubly evil. It not
only has its source in aggression
against the tax-burden citizens,
but it has as its direct aim further
violence and aggression.)
All of this government money
doesn't come from nowhere. The
government is not a productive
entity. It can only obtain wealth
by stealing from productive
citizens.
So far we have been treating
Stanford University as a sort of
bloodless entity. But in reality,
Stanford is controlled by flesh
and blood individuals. Just as
there are taxpayer-victims in the
financing of Stanford and
Vietnamese victims of some of the
research done at Stanford,
likewise there are real flesh and
blood victimizers who benefit
from the system as it is and act to
perpetuate its existence.
Much de facto control over the
University as an institution
control over hiring, firing,
research, and curriculum—lies in
the hands of faculty members.
Structurally this is natural because
of below-cost pricing in student
tuition, because of the design and
job-description impressed upon
this educational institution by
Jane and Leland Stanford, and
because of the subsidy to the
faculty of money extracted from
taxpayers. Additional power is
wielded by the government itself
and by the University
administration (which largely
reflects faculty views). The
trustees are supervisors, drawn
from and representing the elite
elements of the exploiting caste
based on stolen wealth.
Redistribution of Property
Who should control Stanford?
The victims of those who control
Stanford have just claims against

them, claims which can and
should be met, in part, by giving
those victims title to land and
equipment at Stanford. Although
redistribution of Stanford
property to these people is
justified right now and should be
done immediately, this will
probably only become possible
when the general populace throws
off the yoke of the State.
What should we all be doing
now practically to achieve this
goal? At the very least attempts
can be made to liberate Stanford
from the influence and control of
the government and the ruling
predatory caste. The freeing of
Stanford includes not only an end
to direct government aid in the
form of research grants and
contracts, but an end to all
funding that arises out of the
University's ties with the
Military-Industrial Complex.
National Defense Education Act
loan funds ($1.4 million in 1968)
must be cut off.
Indeed the freeing of Stanford
calls for the severing of all
relationships in which the
violation of human rights serve
either as the basis or goal of those
relationships.
As a final matter, we must deal
with the contention, often voiced
at Stanford, that if you cut
Stanford off from the
government, the University will
not survive.
Well, if that is the case, if
Stanford does not have enough to
offer to induce its voluntary
support, if the existence of
Stanford University must be based
on the coercive violation of men's
rights, if it cannot survive unless it
has a part in the killing of
innocent people, if it cannot
survive without money stolen
from innocent victims, then
Stanford should not survive.
Who should control Stanford?
Should it "become the property
of poor and working people," in
Bruce Franklin's imprecise words?
Should it be given back to the
Indians? Should it be run by an
amorphous town meeting of
everyone affected (whatever that
means) by Stanford activities?
Should it be run by a different
board of directors (perhaps with
each member drawn from an
organized special interest group
affected by Stanford, along the
lines of Mussolini's plan for social
organizations in fascist Italy)?
Who really has legitimate title
to the land here, and the
equipment? And who should be
making the decisions about its
use?
These questions, and others
along the same lines, lie at the
base of much of the troubles
Stanford University has
experienced since 1966.
To answer these questions
correctly will necessitate a foray
into the past history of the
University, a sort of title search,
but before that, it is important to
lay out the principles which will
inform our quest for the
legitimate owners of Stanford
University. Needless to say,
neither of the authors of this
essay considers it the final word
on the subject. All the needed
historical data is not in, and full

philosophical refinement has not
yet been achieved.
Legitimate Land-Owners
In radical libertarian social
theory, a legitimate title to land
(meaning any original,
nature-giving factor of
production) comes into existence
when a human being appropriates
and transforms such a natural
factor of production, when he
mixes his labor with it, cultivates
it, and makes it more useful. This
theory can thus be termed the
"first user, first owner" or
homesteading principle of land
tenure.
The first users of the land in
the Stanford area were the
Costanoan Indians who had
