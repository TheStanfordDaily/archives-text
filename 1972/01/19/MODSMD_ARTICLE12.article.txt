# ASSU Complaint
## Students Do Not Run The University 
### ASSU Council of Presidents 
For the past quarter we have
witnessed events in which
concerned students attempted to
take part in the decision-making
process. These events did not deal
with the idea that students should
be able to manage their personal
dorm lives—i.e., hours,
roommates, what to wear on
Quad—for those days are over.
Students now are concerned with
the real quality of the University.
Concern With University
This concern encompasses not
only the management of their
own judicial system and their own
services. It encompasses issues
such as how the University invests
its money, what research is carried
on at the University, academic
freedom, and in general, whether
or not the University should be
inextricably involved with the
political (especially foreign)
policies of the U.S. Government.
It should be obvious to
students here that we do not run
the University and that we have

The Daily's next opinion forum
will be on the topic, "Should
war-related industry in the Palo
Alto area be controlled, and if so,
how?"
The Forum is tentatively
scheduled for Wednesday, Jan. 26.
The Daily invites all members of
the community to submit
opinions. Anyone who intends to
write a column should contact Jan
Feldman at the Daily as soon as
possible.

very little to do with its operation
outside of paying tuition, room
and board. This fact can be seen
through the attempts of students
to change the Placement Center's
recruitment policy. Even though
there are many diversified
opinions as to recruitment at the
Placement Center, students should
be able to decide the policy of our
own services.
Interim Judicial Board
Look again at the so-called
Interim Judicial Board (previously
called the SJC). Students
attempted to change portions of
the Charter which seemed unfair
to the student being charged
through the appropriate body (the
C-15). Changes were slow in
coming and the students
non-cooperation was met with the
emergency powers of President
Lyman.
What students must understand
now is that President Lyman and
the Trustees run this school. And
there is a force of faculty,
administrators, alumni, and
students which supports them.
But because the issues with which
we are dealing concern more than
just keeping us satisfied in our
personal dorm lives, we as
students are facing the reality that
the status quo at Stanford does
not allow for students to have
optimum participation in the
decision making process. Some
will of course point to the excess
of committees which exist here
and on which students may have a
voice. However, those committees
are all a part of the slow-moving
bureaucracy which recommends

policy to the President and the
Trustees. They also tend to
neutralize students to a middle of
the road compromise position.
Because of the University's
involvement in research and in
investments (both of which can
and do tie the University to not
only governmental policies but
also governmental money), the
University must begin to be
managed in such a way which
reflects the opinions and ideas of
students, faculty and staff who
may or may not agree with the
policies implemented.
Control To The People
Ultimate control over
University policy, University
facilities, and the directions of the
University, should lie with the
people who live, work, study and
teach here. Though a special
policy district and incorporation
where people would have legal
voting control over services at
Stanford may not be feasible,
some kind of electoral control by
the various constituencies of the
University must be instituted.
One idea that we believe
deserves serious consideration is
creation of a University-wide
assembly that would include
elected representatives from the
student body, faculty,
administration and, for the first
time, the working staff. This
assembly would consider issues
which affect the entire University.
Widen Board Membership
And we must begin to analyze
seriously whether it is right that
thirty people, some of whom are
alumni, with very little contact

with the University on a day to
day basis should legally own and
run the University and have
ultimate control over every aspect
of it. We believe this is wrong and
if the Board of Trustees is to be
maintained at all as an element in
the governing of the University,
its membership must be widened
to include elected representatives (
of the above mention
constituencies.
We have been able to change
some policies, but we have always
had to appeal and plead with
higher authorities. We have never
had and do not have now any
element of legal control over
policies of this University.
More Democratic Control
Our goal for the remainder of
our term will be to begin to move
the issue of University
government in the direction of
more democratic control on the
part of the many constituencies
which make up the Stanford
community. In this University we
must begin to examine better
ways of governing. And if there is
I

a solution or a series of solutions
we must take steps to implement
them as soon as possible.
