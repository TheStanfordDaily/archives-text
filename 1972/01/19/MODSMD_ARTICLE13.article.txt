# findings of fact
## The 						Charges Are Not Proven 
### 
First of Two Parts
President Lyman derives
various consolations from his "fair
and careful reading" of the
Advisory Board's Decision to fire
Professor Franklin (Stanford
Daily, January 10,1972).
Perhaps my reading may be no
more "fair" than anyone else's,
though I am at least not in the
position of being, simultaneously,
plaintiff, prosecutor, and judge of
the case. But 1 have given the
decision several careful readings
and I reach conclusions opposite
to those of the President: the
charges are not proven; the
standards by which Franklin is
judged are not compatible with
the Constitutional protections
that the Board claims to
guarantee; the penalty of dismissal
is absurdly out of proportion to
the charges sustained by the
majority and ridiculous with
respect to the charge sustained
unanimously; Franklin is really
being dismissed, not on the
charges, but for political views
and conduct against which the
majority of the Advisory Board
and President Lyman share a
profound bias; and the result of
this case will be a blow to free
political speech and action here
and in other colleges and
universities.
Let me begin an analysis of the
decision with the Board's "finding
of facts" on the charges, passing
over the Lodge incident since the
Board did not sustain the relevant
charge.
White Plaza Rally
The charge concerning the
White Plaza rally at noon of
February 10 turns on the meaning
of "strike" and "shut down" in
Franklin's speech at the end of
the rally (60-62; numbers in
parentheses refer to pages in the
Advisory Board's decision). It
seems plausible that Franklin had
in mind the kind of "strike"
which "shut down" several
departments of the university in
the Spring of 1970 in response to
the invasion of Cambodia—that is,

a "strike" which resulted from
talking the members of a
department or facility into
"boycotting" its usual activities as
a gesture of opposition to the war.
The fact that there was little
discussion of persuading workers
to leave their jobs or of picketing
(61) does not differentiate
Franklin's speech or other
speeches that make up its context
from the kind given in Spring of
1970. On the other hand, the
definition of "strike" as
"voluntary boycott" may have
been too distant from the
suggestion "to shut down the
most obvious machinery of war"
(51 and Appendix 11, pp. 2-3) to
allow an easy connection in the
minds of the audience; in that
case the Board may be right in
thinking that a "substantial
portion of the audience" might
have interpreted "shut down" to
mean "forceful disruption" (62).
About Franklin's intentions or
reasonable expectations it is more
difficult to be "strongly
persuaded," especially since the
Board's position assumes that he
did not mean what he said. It is
only on this charge that the
findings of the Board are
unanimous, and even here there
seem grounds for reasonable
doubt.
Computer Center
The majority 's decision on the
third charge rests finally on the
assumption that Franklin's
shouting at Moses and at Tamm
meant he was in fact inciting the
crowd (73-77, 86). Here the
dissenting opinion of Professors
Brown and Kennedy (90-94) does
a great service in exposing the bias
of the majority.
The majority, having identified
conciliation with the volume of
speech they use in conciliating,
cannot believe that shouts might
be intended to conciliate. They
therefore cannot believe the
obvious: that Franklin was really
trying to persuade Moses to stay
on as a faculty observer in order
to deter a police charge; and that

Franklin was really arguing with
Tamm's order to disperse because
he knew, if the order remained in
effect, a police charge was
inevitable.
The majority's preoccupation
with the distance between Tamm
and Franklin standing with Moses
seems especially odd: at 40 to 60
feet Franklin would have had to
shout to be heard, and for those
of us who have played even
sand-lot baseball it is quite usual
to shout at that distance. Here the
construction put on the physical
evidence by the minority seems
not only plausible but compelling.
They also make the important
point, soft-pedaled by the
majority (85), that a citizen has a
right to contest briefly a dispersal
order that he thinks unreasonable
and unlawful, and the right also to
remind other citizens of their
right to do likewise (93-94).
Franklin's three conversations—
with Tamm, Moses, and again
with Tamm—"took no more than
three or four minutes." (93) That
does not seem an excessively long
protest. There seems little doubt
that the minority, not the
majority, "finds the facts" on the
third charge.
People's War
The majority's opinion on the
fourth charge depends on
"people's war" being a code
phrase understood by members of
"the movement" to include
coercive and violent acts
(110-111) even in a context where
Franklin explicitly defines the
phrase solely with reference to
dormitory discussions and touch
football games (101, reinforced
by Bennion, 103 .)
For its broad construction of
the phrase, the majority derives a
context from rallies "during the
past few years" and the "violent
activities" which follow them
(111). It then moves from this
speculative construction of the
term to an assertion of its truth,
makes a seeming concession that
some of the actions Franklin

advocated were peaceful
(113-115), and then tries to cover
its traces with the banal "moral"
question, hopefully but not
clearly rhetorical: "If a person
removes valuable merchandise
from a store, paying for half, but
not paying for the other half, is he
culpable for the part he stole?"
(15).
Again the dissenting opinion
does us the service of defining the
more probable context of the
speech and the phrase as the
attempt of Franklin to bring the
Roble group into a united
front—an attempt that would have
been thwarted by the suggestion
of violent actions (119-121). The
minority's subsequent comment
about reconstructing wordking
and meaning of an unrecorded
speech applies to the majority as

. ronald rebholz

well as to the witnesses:
The "hard" core data on
words . . . fragmentary, and
depend . . . much on the kind
of context-construction that is
very sensitive to whatever bias
the wit n esses may
have .. . (122-123).
The biases of the majority against
Franklin obviously affect their
construction of context with
respect to both the third and the
fourt charges.
After 101 pages of "Finding of
Facts," we are left with one
charge sustained unanimously be
the Board and about which there
still seem grounds for reasonable
doubt.
