A Fascist?
Editor, THE DAILY:
I have just read Jonathan
Dedmon's "Commentary" titled
"Franklin Returns to Teaching."
Certain of Franklin's quoted
statements demand a reply from
me; I think I have been accused of
being a Fascist.
Franklin is baffled by the fact
that someone (like myself) could
come to literature with a Marxist
perspective and, at the same time,
admire the work of a self-declared
Fascist like Ezra Pound. In his
bafflement, Franklin believes such
a person must be "pulling a
number on everybody including
himself" and must really be a
Fascist.
I urge Franklin not to be so
baffled. Indeed, since Franklin has
returned to teaching, I urge him
to acquaint his students with the
complex thought of Lenin (who
was no Fascist at all, but really a
Marxist). It so happens that Lenin
faced the same problem that
many Marxists face: how to
reconcile one's personal respect
and pleasure in aesthetic works
which embrace values antipathetic
to one. Lenin himself loved the
"miracle" of great music but
feared listening to it often: "It
acts on my nerves, makes me want
to talk amiable stupidities and
stroke the heads of these beings
who, living in a filthy hell, can
create such beauty."
And when Tolstoy died, Lenin
wrote no fewer than five
obituaries; he was bent on
resolving the contradiction
between "an artist of genius who
not only paints incomparable
pictures of Russian life, but who
contributes works of the first
order to world literature" and "a
landowner wearing the martyr's
crown in the name of Christ."
These are tough problems indeed;
someone should study them.

I close by noting another
example: Karl Marx. He was a
Marxist. And he, strange to tell,
admired the works of Balzac. Who
was not a Marxist. Marx was
intending to write a long study of
Balzac, but other things got in the
way. Franklin might tell his
students that Marx once said:
"Well, Balzac was politically a
legitimist; his great work is a
constant elegy on the irreparable
decay of good society; his
sympathies are with the class that
is doomed to extinction. But for
all that his satire is never keener,
his irony never bitterer, than
when he sets in motion the very
men and women with whom he
sympathizes most deeply—the
nobles."
Bill Chace,
Assistant Professor of English
On Record
Editor, THE DAILY:
My name is mentioned in the
Daily as being one of the "liberal"
professors who might "want to
get rid of Franklin." This is not
correct.
To put the record straight, may
I say briefly that I doubted the
wisdom of bringing the charges in
the first place, but once this was
done, I felt that the Advisory
Board heard them with
scrumpulous fairness and
forbearance; that, given their
terms of reference, I agree in
general with the Board's findings,
but feel that the sentence is both
excessive and unwise,—not
because I believe in the sanctity of
tenure, which would not seem to
be the main issue, but because I
believe that a strong university
with a liberal tradition should be
able to carry its dissidents,
however unpopular or
uncomfortable.
A strict constructionist

interpretation of the rules,
moreover, at this particular time
when tensions need to be cooled
rather than exacerbated, is likely
to do Stanford more harm than
good.

Scribbling
Editor, THE DAILY:
I would like to ask those
people who have been
spray-painting various sayings on
buildings around the campus if
they would grow up and find a
different means of expressing
themselves. Scribbling on the
walls is a pastime that most
people desist from when they
are children.
Don Kimzey,

More Subtle
Editor, THE DAILY:
It seems that the New York
Times has changed only by
becoming more subtle in the years
since, at the beginning of this
century, it published the
following editorial comment
approving Syracuse University's
firing of economics professor
Scott Nearing:
"Men who through toil and
ability have got together enough
money to endow universities or
professors" chairs do not
generally have it in mind that
their money should be spent for
the dissemination of the dogmas
of Socialism or in the teaching of
ingenuous youth how to live
without work. . .."
"We see no reason why the
upholders of academic
freedom . . . should not establish a
university of their own. Let them
provide the funds, erect the
buildingr., lay out the campus, and
then make a requisition on the
padded cells of Bedlam for their
teaching staff. Nobody would
interfere with the full freedom of
professors; they could teach
Socialism and shiftlessness until
Doomsday without restraint."
Judy Strasser,

How Is It?
Editor, THE DAILY:
Less than a fortnight ago in an
advertisement published in the
Hnilir 971 r%f Wt' nnll or*! I/>r

declared that "unless we protect
the minority who hold unpopular,
or as some think, immoral
views . . . then no minority and no
individual is safe here. The rights
of minorities cannot be dealt with
as if they were only political
issues, left to the exigencies of
power."
As Robert McAfee Brown
noted in another document
published in the same Daily: "the
individual . . . particularly if he
espouses unpopular beliefs is not
so amply blessed with
supporters," a truism amply
substantiated by recent events.
I had hoped, though
apparently in vain, that perhaps
Bruce Franklin would suddenly
find himself with 271 unexpected
champions, for there is certainly
considerable evidence concerning
the unpopularity of his views, and
I at least, as a pacifist, would be
prepared to argue that his

advocacy of armed, violent
revolution is immoral.
Admittedly the paid
advertisement appeared in defense
of campus recruitment by the
likes of Honeywell and Dow
Chemical, but, as Hubert Marshall
observed in the same issue of the
Daily, "in a truly literal sense, the
end result of a recruiting interview
at Stanford may be the successful
destruction of a Cambodian
village."
How is it that, as a community,
we find it easier to be solicitous of
the interests of Dow or Honeywell
than of our own, admittedly
unpopular, colleague? Why is
incitement that leads to the
abortive occupation of the
Computation Center intolerable
but not the recruitment that leads
to the destruction of a peasant
village?

baffled. Indeed, since Franklin has
returned to teaching, I urge him
to acquaint his students with the
complex thought of Lenin (who
was no Fascist at all, but really a
Marxist). It so happens that Lenin
faced the same problem that
many Marxists face: how to
reconcile one's personal respect
and pleasure in aesthetic works
which embrace values antipathetic
to one. Lenin himself loved the
"miracle" of great music but
feared listening to it often: "It
acts on my nerves, makes me want
to talk amiable stupidities and
stroke the heads of these beings
who, living in a filthy hell, can
create such beauty."
And when Tolstoy died, Lenin
wrote no fewer than five
obituaries; he was bent on
resolving the contradiction
between "an artist of genius who
not only paints incomparable
pictures of Russian life, but who
contributes works of the first
order to world literature" and "a
landowner wearing the martyr's
crown in the name of Christ."
These are tough problems indeed;
someone should study them.

I close by noting another
example: Karl Marx. He was a
Marxist. And he, strange to tell,
admired the works of Balzac. Who
was not a Marxist. Marx was
intending to write a long study of
Balzac, but other things got in the
way. Franklin might tell his
students that Marx once said:
"Well, Balzac was politically a
legitimist; his great work is a
constant elegy on the irreparable
decay of good society; his
sympathies are with the class that
is doomed to extinction. But for
all that his satire is never keener,
his irony never bitterer, than
when he sets in motion the very
men and women with whom he
sympathizes most deeply—the
nobles."

On Record
Editor, THE DAILY:
My name is mentioned in the
Daily as being one of the "liberal"
professors who might "want to
get rid of Franklin." This is not
correct.
To put the record straight, may
I say briefly that I doubted the
wisdom of bringing the charges in
the first place, but once this was
done, I felt that the Advisory
Board heard them with
scrumpulous fairness and
forbearance; that, given their
terms of reference, I agree in
general with the Board's findings,
but feel that the sentence is both
excessive and unwise,—not
because I believe in the sanctity of
tenure, which would not seem to
be the main issue, but because I
believe that a strong university
with a liberal tradition should be
able to carry its dissidents,
however unpopular or
uncomfortable.
A strict constructionist

interpretation of the rules,
moreover, at this particular time
when tensions need to be cooled
rather than exacerbated, is likely
to do Stanford more harm than
good.

Editor, THE DAILY:
I would like to ask those
people who have been
spray-painting various sayings on
buildings around the campus if
they would grow up and find a

Editor, THE DAILY:
It seems that the New York
Times has changed only by
becoming more subtle in the years
since, at the beginning of this
century, it published the
following editorial comment
approving Syracuse University's
firing of economics professor
Scott Nearing:
"Men who through toil and
ability have got together enough
money to endow universities or
professors" chairs do not
generally have it in mind that
their money should be spent for
the dissemination of the dogmas
of Socialism or in the teaching of
ingenuous youth how to live
without work. . .."
"We see no reason why the
upholders of academic
freedom . . . should not establish a
university of their own. Let them
provide the funds, erect the
buildingr., lay out the campus, and
then make a requisition on the
padded cells of Bedlam for their
teaching staff. Nobody would
interfere with the full freedom of
professors; they could teach
Socialism and shiftlessness until
Doomsday without restraint."
Judy Strasser,

How Is It?
Editor, THE DAILY:
Less than a fortnight ago in an
advertisement published in the
Hnilir 971 r%f Wt' nnll or*! I/>r

declared that "unless we protect
the minority who hold unpopular,
or as some think, immoral
views . . . then no minority and no
individual is safe here. The rights
of minorities cannot be dealt with
as if they were only political
issues, left to the exigencies of
power."
As Robert McAfee Brown
noted in another document
published in the same Daily: "the
individual . . . particularly if he
espouses unpopular beliefs is not
so amply blessed with
supporters," a truism amply
substantiated by recent events.
I had hoped, though
apparently in vain, that perhaps
Bruce Franklin would suddenly
find himself with 271 unexpected
champions, for there is certainly
considerable evidence concerning
the unpopularity of his views, and
I at least, as a pacifist, would be
prepared to argue that his

advocacy of armed, violent
revolution is immoral.
Admittedly the paid
advertisement appeared in defense
of campus recruitment by the
likes of Honeywell and Dow
Chemical, but, as Hubert Marshall
observed in the same issue of the
Daily, "in a truly literal sense, the
end result of a recruiting interview
at Stanford may be the successful
destruction of a Cambodian
village."
How is it that, as a community,
we find it easier to be solicitous of
the interests of Dow or Honeywell
than of our own, admittedly
unpopular, colleague? Why is
incitement that leads to the
abortive occupation of the
Computation Center intolerable
but not the recruitment that leads
to the destruction of a peasant
village?

Editor, THE DAILY:
I have just read Jonathan
Dedmon's "Commentary" titled
"Franklin Returns to Teaching."
Certain of Franklin's quoted
statements demand a reply from
me; I think I have been accused of
being a Fascist.
Franklin is baffled by the fact
that someone (like myself) could
come to literature with a Marxist
perspective and, at the same time,
admire the work of a self-declared
Fascist like Ezra Pound. In his
bafflement, Franklin believes such
a person must be "pulling a
number on everybody including
himself" and must really be a
Fascist.
I urge Franklin not to be so

I close by noting another
example: Karl Marx. He was a
Marxist. And he, strange to tell,
admired the works of Balzac. Who
was not a Marxist. Marx was
intending to write a long study of
Balzac, but other things got in the
way. Franklin might tell his
students that Marx once said:
"Well, Balzac was politically a
legitimist; his great work is a
constant elegy on the irreparable
decay of good society; his
sympathies are with the class that
is doomed to extinction. But for
all that his satire is never keener,
his irony never bitterer, than
when he sets in motion the very
men and women with whom he
sympathizes most deeply—the
nobles."
Bill Chace,
Assistant Professor of English
On Record
Editor, THE DAILY:
My name is mentioned in the
Daily as being one of the "liberal"
professors who might "want to
get rid of Franklin." This is not
correct.
To put the record straight, may
I say briefly that I doubted the
wisdom of bringing the charges in
the first place, but once this was
done, I felt that the Advisory
Board heard them with
scrumpulous fairness and
forbearance; that, given their
terms of reference, I agree in
general with the Board's findings,
but feel that the sentence is both
excessive and unwise,—not
because I believe in the sanctity of
tenure, which would not seem to
be the main issue, but because I
believe that a strong university
with a liberal tradition should be
able to carry its dissidents,
however unpopular or
uncomfortable.
A strict constructionist

interpretation of the rules,
moreover, at this particular time
when tensions need to be cooled
rather than exacerbated, is likely
to do Stanford more harm than
good.

Scribbling
Editor, THE DAILY:
I would like to ask those
people who have been
spray-painting various sayings on
buildings around the campus if
they would grow up and find a
different means of expressing
themselves. Scribbling on the

Editor, THE DAILY:
It seems that the New York
Times has changed only by
becoming more subtle in the years
since, at the beginning of this
century, it published the
following editorial comment
approving Syracuse University's
firing of economics professor
Scott Nearing:
"Men who through toil and
ability have got together enough
money to endow universities or
professors" chairs do not
generally have it in mind that
their money should be spent for
the dissemination of the dogmas
of Socialism or in the teaching of
ingenuous youth how to live
without work. . .."
"We see no reason why the
upholders of academic
freedom . . . should not establish a
university of their own. Let them
provide the funds, erect the
buildingr., lay out the campus, and
then make a requisition on the
padded cells of Bedlam for their
teaching staff. Nobody would
interfere with the full freedom of
professors; they could teach
Socialism and shiftlessness until
Doomsday without restraint."
Judy Strasser,

How Is It?
Editor, THE DAILY:
Less than a fortnight ago in an
advertisement published in the
Hnilir 971 r%f Wt' nnll or*! I/>r

declared that "unless we protect
the minority who hold unpopular,
or as some think, immoral
views . . . then no minority and no
individual is safe here. The rights
of minorities cannot be dealt with
as if they were only political
issues, left to the exigencies of
power."
As Robert McAfee Brown
noted in another document
published in the same Daily: "the
individual . . . particularly if he
espouses unpopular beliefs is not
so amply blessed with
supporters," a truism amply
substantiated by recent events.
I had hoped, though
apparently in vain, that perhaps
Bruce Franklin would suddenly
find himself with 271 unexpected
champions, for there is certainly
considerable evidence concerning
the unpopularity of his views, and
I at least, as a pacifist, would be
prepared to argue that his

advocacy of armed, violent
revolution is immoral.
Admittedly the paid
advertisement appeared in defense
of campus recruitment by the
likes of Honeywell and Dow
Chemical, but, as Hubert Marshall
observed in the same issue of the
Daily, "in a truly literal sense, the
end result of a recruiting interview
at Stanford may be the successful
destruction of a Cambodian
village."
How is it that, as a community,
we find it easier to be solicitous of
the interests of Dow or Honeywell
than of our own, admittedly
unpopular, colleague? Why is
incitement that leads to the
abortive occupation of the
Computation Center intolerable
but not the recruitment that leads
to the destruction of a peasant
village?

A Fascist?
Editor, THE DAILY:
I have just read Jonathan
Dedmon's "Commentary" titled
"Franklin Returns to Teaching."
Certain of Franklin's quoted
statements demand a reply from
me; I think I have been accused of
being a Fascist.
Franklin is baffled by the fact
that someone (like myself) could
come to literature with a Marxist
perspective and, at the same time,
admire the work of a self-declared
Fascist like Ezra Pound. In his
bafflement, Franklin believes such
a person must be "pulling a
number on everybody including
himself" and must really be a
Fascist.
I urge Franklin not to be so
baffled. Indeed, since Franklin has
returned to teaching, I urge him
to acquaint his students with the
complex thought of Lenin (who
was no Fascist at all, but really a
Marxist). It so happens that Lenin
faced the same problem that
many Marxists face: how to
reconcile one's personal respect
and pleasure in aesthetic works
which embrace values antipathetic
to one. Lenin himself loved the
"miracle" of great music but
feared listening to it often: "It
acts on my nerves, makes me want
to talk amiable stupidities and
stroke the heads of these beings
who, living in a filthy hell, can
create such beauty."
And when Tolstoy died, Lenin
wrote no fewer than five
obituaries; he was bent on
resolving the contradiction
between "an artist of genius who
not only paints incomparable
pictures of Russian life, but who
contributes works of the first
order to world literature" and "a

I close by noting another
example: Karl Marx. He was a
Marxist. And he, strange to tell,
admired the works of Balzac. Who
was not a Marxist. Marx was
intending to write a long study of
Balzac, but other things got in the
way. Franklin might tell his
students that Marx once said:
"Well, Balzac was politically a
legitimist; his great work is a
constant elegy on the irreparable
decay of good society; his
sympathies are with the class that
is doomed to extinction. But for
all that his satire is never keener,
his irony never bitterer, than
when he sets in motion the very
men and women with whom he
sympathizes most deeply—the
nobles."
Bill Chace,
Assistant Professor of English
On Record
Editor, THE DAILY:
My name is mentioned in the
Daily as being one of the "liberal"
professors who might "want to
get rid of Franklin." This is not
correct.
To put the record straight, may
I say briefly that I doubted the
wisdom of bringing the charges in
the first place, but once this was
done, I felt that the Advisory
Board heard them with
scrumpulous fairness and
forbearance; that, given their
terms of reference, I agree in
general with the Board's findings,
but feel that the sentence is both
excessive and unwise,—not
because I believe in the sanctity of
tenure, which would not seem to
be the main issue, but because I
believe that a strong university
with a liberal tradition should be
able to carry its dissidents,
however unpopular or
uncomfortable.
A strict constructionist

interpretation of the rules,
moreover, at this particular time
when tensions need to be cooled
rather than exacerbated, is likely
to do Stanford more harm than
good.

Scribbling
Editor, THE DAILY:
I would like to ask those
people who have been
spray-painting various sayings on
buildings around the campus if
they would grow up and find a
different means of expressing
themselves. Scribbling on the
walls is a pastime that most
people desist from when they
are children.

More Subtle
Editor, THE DAILY:
It seems that the New York
Times has changed only by
becoming more subtle in the years
since, at the beginning of this
century, it published the
following editorial comment
approving Syracuse University's
firing of economics professor
Scott Nearing:
"Men who through toil and
ability have got together enough
money to endow universities or
professors" chairs do not
generally have it in mind that
their money should be spent for
the dissemination of the dogmas
of Socialism or in the teaching of
ingenuous youth how to live
without work. . .."
"We see no reason why the
upholders of academic
freedom . . . should not establish a
university of their own. Let them
provide the funds, erect the
buildingr., lay out the campus, and
then make a requisition on the
padded cells of Bedlam for their
teaching staff. Nobody would
interfere with the full freedom of
professors; they could teach
Socialism and shiftlessness until
Doomsday without restraint."

How Is It?
Editor, THE DAILY:
Less than a fortnight ago in an
advertisement published in the
Hnilir 971 r%f Wt' nnll or*! I/>r

declared that "unless we protect
the minority who hold unpopular,
or as some think, immoral
views . . . then no minority and no
individual is safe here. The rights
of minorities cannot be dealt with
as if they were only political
issues, left to the exigencies of
power."
As Robert McAfee Brown
noted in another document
published in the same Daily: "the
individual . . . particularly if he
espouses unpopular beliefs is not
so amply blessed with
supporters," a truism amply
substantiated by recent events.
I had hoped, though
apparently in vain, that perhaps
Bruce Franklin would suddenly
find himself with 271 unexpected
champions, for there is certainly
considerable evidence concerning
the unpopularity of his views, and
I at least, as a pacifist, would be
prepared to argue that his

advocacy of armed, violent
revolution is immoral.
Admittedly the paid
advertisement appeared in defense
of campus recruitment by the
likes of Honeywell and Dow
Chemical, but, as Hubert Marshall
observed in the same issue of the
Daily, "in a truly literal sense, the
end result of a recruiting interview
at Stanford may be the successful
destruction of a Cambodian
village."
How is it that, as a community,
we find it easier to be solicitous of
the interests of Dow or Honeywell
than of our own, admittedly
unpopular, colleague? Why is
incitement that leads to the
abortive occupation of the
Computation Center intolerable
but not the recruitment that leads
to the destruction of a peasant
village?
Paul S. Seaver,

A Fascist?
Editor, THE DAILY:
I have just read Jonathan
Dedmon's "Commentary" titled
"Franklin Returns to Teaching."
Certain of Franklin's quoted
statements demand a reply from
me; I think I have been accused of
being a Fascist.
Franklin is baffled by the fact
that someone (like myself) could
come to literature with a Marxist
perspective and, at the same time,
admire the work of a self-declared
Fascist like Ezra Pound. In his
bafflement, Franklin believes such
a person must be "pulling a
number on everybody including
himself" and must really be a
Fascist.
I urge Franklin not to be so
baffled. Indeed, since Franklin has
returned to teaching, I urge him
to acquaint his students with the
complex thought of Lenin (who
was no Fascist at all, but really a
Marxist). It so happens that Lenin
faced the same problem that
many Marxists face: how to
reconcile one's personal respect
and pleasure in aesthetic works
which embrace values antipathetic
to one. Lenin himself loved the
"miracle" of great music but
feared listening to it often: "It
acts on my nerves, makes me want
to talk amiable stupidities and
stroke the heads of these beings
who, living in a filthy hell, can
create such beauty."
And when Tolstoy died, Lenin
wrote no fewer than five
obituaries; he was bent on
resolving the contradiction
between "an artist of genius who
not only paints incomparable
pictures of Russian life, but who
contributes works of the first
order to world literature" and "a
landowner wearing the martyr's
crown in the name of Christ."
These are tough problems indeed;
someone should study them.
