# 'power to the people'
## Referendum Must Succeed 
### 
r l\vo weeks ago, outraged
people in Memorial Church issued
an ultimatum to rehire Bruce
Franklin by Tuesday noon. The
ultimatum read: "Rehire
Bruce—Or Else."
What the Administration
wanted, and what the bourgeois
press expected, to the "Or Else"
of the ultimatum was Isolated
trashing and sporadic violence by
the more radical elements of the
campus, so that it could be
exploited as a means of alienating
revolutionaries and radicals
against moderates and pacifists.
The people's response was not
to fall into the divisive issue of
violence, but rather to challenge
the Administration with the one
force it could not withstand—a
mass movement which would
embrace every member of the
community in all levels of
struggle.

The Stanford Rehabilitation
Movement was formed with the
understanding that it is the
University, and not Bruce
Franklin, that must be
rehabilitated, and that it is our
perceptions of reality, diverse as
they are, that must flourish and
become reality rather then be
convictions that are repressed.
The Stanford Rehabilitation
Movement is a protracted struggle
organized under a broad united
front, and singly determined to
prove that repression breeds
resistance.
Everyone should realize that
there are conscious attempts to
discredit and sabotage the
Movement. Anonymous bomb
threats such as the one phoned in
to Encina are obvious acts of
provocation which achieve one
sole purpose: to project an image
of the radical left as a lunatic and

dangerous fringe, and thus to
alienate the Movement from the
people.
The San Francisco Chronicle
on Jan. 13 revealed that the FBl's
counter-intelligence bureau has
since 1967 disrupted every peace
march by distributing false
information, and attempted to
foster internal dissension by
sending to various groups
provocative letters with the forged
signatures of political leaders.
It is only in unity that the
Movement finds its strength, and in
the trust of the people for a
Movement which they feel a part
of, that we can find purpose and
determination.
Basic to the issue of Bruce
Franklin's firing is the fact that as
the freedom to dissent diminishes
and repression at Stanford
becomes legitimate, the same old
crowd of people who control the
University consolidates a greater
amount of power.
It was so predictable that
persons like Rehnquist and
Packard should be the new
members of the Board of
Overseers of Hoover Institute. It is
appropriate that as Bruce
Franklin's dismissal is challenged
by the First Amendment, the
University reinforces its position
by bringing in Rehnquist, who is
known for having declared that
the First Amendment is not
absolute and can be abridged
arbitrarily.
A small number of people and
their corporations virtually
control Stanford University. If a
referendum in favor of the
retaining of Bruce Franklin and an
invitation to the Board of
Trustees to have an open,
non-disruptive meeting with the
Stanford community is totally
ignored, it will demonstrate for
once and for all what everyone
has already known: that power
lies only in the hands of the
Trustees, whose vested interests
are contrary to the interests of the
Stanford community.
From this acknowledgement of
our powerlessness we can begin to
reassert ourselves.
The danger to success of the
Movement is not in the
powerlessness of students, but in

-Stanford rehabilitation movement

their apathy. For the slogan
'Tower to the People" becomes
an axiom if the people will believe
and act upon it.
If the arrogance of the Trustees
towards the legitimate wishes of
the student body can build
enough outrage and indignation in
every student, then the Movement
will have advanced qualitatively.
For then the implementation of
the demand to rehire Bruce will
gather greater support and
significance since it will become
the implementation of the student
body's clearly stated wishes.
As is already beginning to
happen, academic departments
will break away from the
established system and offer
alternative forms of education,
challenging the repression in
unison rather than wait idly for it
to knock on every outspoken,
tenured or especially non-tenured,
professor's door.
It is imperative that the
referendum succeed. Those whose
vested interests lie in the
dismissal of Bruce Franklin will
campaign strongly against it. The
success of the referendum
depends on those thousands who
are not particularly enthralled by
Bruce's character, nor agree with
Bruce's ideology, but feel vaguely
uncomfortable at the implications
of the dismissal. It is essential that
these people realize what effect
the dismissal will have on the
freedom of speech on this and
other campuses.
Time magazine, for example,
after an article on Bruce Franklin,
listed three other prominent
professors and ministers in other
parts of the nation who were
being shafted for their political
beliefs. And the list only begins
there.
It is crucial for these students
to express their dissent in the
referendum, and to organize
others to vote in the referendum.
Once our demands are legitimized
in the eyes of the Board and the
nation, our actions will gain not
only greater legitimacy but also
force and effectiveness.

University, and not Bruce
Franklin, that must be
rehabilitated, and that it is our
perceptions of reality, diverse as
they are, that must flourish and
become reality rather then be
convictions that are repressed.
The Stanford Rehabilitation
Movement is a protracted struggle
organized under a broad united
front, and singly determined to
prove that repression breeds
resistance.
Everyone should realize that
there are conscious attempts to
discredit and sabotage the
Movement. Anonymous bomb
threats such as the one phoned in
to Encina are obvious acts of
provocation which achieve one
sole purpose: to project an image
of the radical left as a lunatic and

dangerous fringe, and thus to
alienate the Movement from the
people.
The San Francisco Chronicle
on Jan. 13 revealed that the FBl's
counter-intelligence bureau has
since 1967 disrupted every peace
march by distributing false
information, and attempted to
foster internal dissension by
sending to various groups
provocative letters with the forged
signatures of political leaders.
It is only in unity that the
Movement finds its strength, and in
the trust of the people for a
Movement which they feel a part
of, that we can find purpose and
determination.
Basic to the issue of Bruce
Franklin's firing is the fact that as
the freedom to dissent diminishes
and repression at Stanford
becomes legitimate, the same old
crowd of people who control the
University consolidates a greater
amount of power.
It was so predictable that
persons like Rehnquist and
Packard should be the new
members of the Board of
Overseers of Hoover Institute. It is
appropriate that as Bruce
Franklin's dismissal is challenged
by the First Amendment, the
University reinforces its position
by bringing in Rehnquist, who is
known for having declared that
the First Amendment is not
absolute and can be abridged
arbitrarily.
A small number of people and
their corporations virtually
control Stanford University. If a
referendum in favor of the
retaining of Bruce Franklin and an
invitation to the Board of
Trustees to have an open,
non-disruptive meeting with the
Stanford community is totally
ignored, it will demonstrate for
once and for all what everyone
has already known: that power
lies only in the hands of the
Trustees, whose vested interests
are contrary to the interests of the
Stanford community.
From this acknowledgement of
our powerlessness we can begin to
reassert ourselves.
The danger to success of the
Movement is not in the
powerlessness of students, but in

-Stanford rehabilitation movement

their apathy. For the slogan
'Tower to the People" becomes
an axiom if the people will believe
and act upon it.
If the arrogance of the Trustees
towards the legitimate wishes of
the student body can build
enough outrage and indignation in
every student, then the Movement
will have advanced qualitatively.
For then the implementation of
the demand to rehire Bruce will
gather greater support and
significance since it will become
the implementation of the student
body's clearly stated wishes.
As is already beginning to
happen, academic departments
will break away from the
established system and offer
alternative forms of education,
challenging the repression in
unison rather than wait idly for it
to knock on every outspoken,
tenured or especially non-tenured,
professor's door.
It is imperative that the
referendum succeed. Those whose
vested interests lie in the
dismissal of Bruce Franklin will
campaign strongly against it. The
success of the referendum
depends on those thousands who
are not particularly enthralled by
Bruce's character, nor agree with
Bruce's ideology, but feel vaguely
uncomfortable at the implications
of the dismissal. It is essential that
these people realize what effect
the dismissal will have on the
freedom of speech on this and
other campuses.
Time magazine, for example,
after an article on Bruce Franklin,
listed three other prominent
professors and ministers in other
parts of the nation who were
being shafted for their political
beliefs. And the list only begins
there.
It is crucial for these students
to express their dissent in the
referendum, and to organize
others to vote in the referendum.
Once our demands are legitimized
in the eyes of the Board and the
nation, our actions will gain not
only greater legitimacy but also
force and effectiveness.

r l\vo weeks ago, outraged
people in Memorial Church issued
an ultimatum to rehire Bruce
Franklin by Tuesday noon. The
ultimatum read: "Rehire
Bruce—Or Else."
What the Administration
wanted, and what the bourgeois
press expected, to the "Or Else"
of the ultimatum was Isolated
trashing and sporadic violence by
the more radical elements of the
campus, so that it could be
exploited as a means of alienating
revolutionaries and radicals
against moderates and pacifists.

to fall into the divisive issue of
violence, but rather to challenge
the Administration with the one
force it could not withstand—a
mass movement which would
embrace every member of the
community in all levels of

provocative letters with the forged
signatures of political leaders.
It is only in unity that the
Movement finds its strength, and in
the trust of the people for a
Movement which they feel a part
of, that we can find purpose and
determination.
Basic to the issue of Bruce
Franklin's firing is the fact that as
the freedom to dissent diminishes
and repression at Stanford
becomes legitimate, the same old
crowd of people who control the
University consolidates a greater
amount of power.
It was so predictable that
persons like Rehnquist and
Packard should be the new
members of the Board of
Overseers of Hoover Institute. It is
appropriate that as Bruce
Franklin's dismissal is challenged
by the First Amendment, the
University reinforces its position
by bringing in Rehnquist, who is
known for having declared that
the First Amendment is not
absolute and can be abridged
arbitrarily.
A small number of people and
their corporations virtually
control Stanford University. If a
referendum in favor of the
retaining of Bruce Franklin and an
invitation to the Board of
Trustees to have an open,
non-disruptive meeting with the
Stanford community is totally
ignored, it will demonstrate for
once and for all what everyone
has already known: that power
lies only in the hands of the
Trustees, whose vested interests
are contrary to the interests of the
Stanford community.
From this acknowledgement of
our powerlessness we can begin to
reassert ourselves.
The danger to success of the
Movement is not in the
powerlessness of students, but in

-Stanford rehabilitation movement

their apathy. For the slogan
'Tower to the People" becomes
an axiom if the people will believe
and act upon it.
If the arrogance of the Trustees
towards the legitimate wishes of
the student body can build
enough outrage and indignation in
every student, then the Movement
will have advanced qualitatively.
For then the implementation of
the demand to rehire Bruce will
gather greater support and
significance since it will become
the implementation of the student
body's clearly stated wishes.
As is already beginning to
happen, academic departments
will break away from the
established system and offer
alternative forms of education,
challenging the repression in
unison rather than wait idly for it
to knock on every outspoken,
tenured or especially non-tenured,
professor's door.
It is imperative that the
referendum succeed. Those whose
vested interests lie in the
dismissal of Bruce Franklin will
campaign strongly against it. The
success of the referendum
depends on those thousands who
are not particularly enthralled by
Bruce's character, nor agree with
Bruce's ideology, but feel vaguely
uncomfortable at the implications
of the dismissal. It is essential that
these people realize what effect
the dismissal will have on the
freedom of speech on this and
other campuses.
Time magazine, for example,
after an article on Bruce Franklin,
listed three other prominent
professors and ministers in other
parts of the nation who were
being shafted for their political
beliefs. And the list only begins
there.
It is crucial for these students
to express their dissent in the
referendum, and to organize
others to vote in the referendum.
Once our demands are legitimized
in the eyes of the Board and the
nation, our actions will gain not
only greater legitimacy but also
force and effectiveness.

Rehabilitation Movement)
r l\vo weeks ago, outraged
people in Memorial Church issued
an ultimatum to rehire Bruce
Franklin by Tuesday noon. The
ultimatum read: "Rehire
Bruce—Or Else."
What the Administration
wanted, and what the bourgeois
press expected, to the "Or Else"
of the ultimatum was Isolated
trashing and sporadic violence by
the more radical elements of the
campus, so that it could be
exploited as a means of alienating
revolutionaries and radicals
against moderates and pacifists.
The people's response was not
to fall into the divisive issue of
violence, but rather to challenge
the Administration with the one
force it could not withstand—a
mass movement which would
embrace every member of the
community in all levels of
struggle.

The Stanford Rehabilitation
Movement was formed with the
understanding that it is the
University, and not Bruce
Franklin, that must be
rehabilitated, and that it is our
perceptions of reality, diverse as
they are, that must flourish and
become reality rather then be
convictions that are repressed.
The Stanford Rehabilitation
Movement is a protracted struggle
organized under a broad united
front, and singly determined to
prove that repression breeds
resistance.
Everyone should realize that
there are conscious attempts to
discredit and sabotage the
Movement. Anonymous bomb
threats such as the one phoned in
to Encina are obvious acts of
provocation which achieve one
sole purpose: to project an image
of the radical left as a lunatic and

dangerous fringe, and thus to
alienate the Movement from the
people.
The San Francisco Chronicle
on Jan. 13 revealed that the FBl's
counter-intelligence bureau has
since 1967 disrupted every peace
march by distributing false
information, and attempted to
foster internal dissension by
sending to various groups
provocative letters with the forged
signatures of political leaders.
