Free Norbert!
Norbert?
Rehabilitate University Food
Service!
Right on. But Norbert?
He's a victim of the racist,
sexist, liberal fascist running dogs
of imperialist peanut butter.
Part St. Bernard, part poodle?
Hangs around Tresidder a lot?
No, no. Norbert is a right-on
Third World struggler who is being
smeared by the Man's peanut
butter.
Hey, is he the weird looking
crew-cut guy on the third floor
who smokes cornsilk joints and
wears saddle shoes and white
socks and plays the ukelele and
keeps dropping his Be A Man
Look Like A Man Victor
Strongboy's Guaranteed Or Your
Money Back Bar Bells on the
floor?
We call that heightening the
contradictions.
I call that weird. He can
heighten them all he wants as long
as he doesn't drop them.
You don't understand, he's
raising the level of struggle.
If he raises it any higher
they're going to fall right through
the floor. Listen, I live right
underneath him.
Okay. Be a petty bourgeois
individualist. Be an apathetic,
elitist yoyo. I bet you sit in your
room cmoWinrr Hnnc onrl

incredible sex with beautiful and
passionate women.
No, I'm pre-med.
Well what are you doing to
liberate the people's peanut
butter? What have you done
today to free Norbert?

What does he need to be freed
from, himself?
The lackeys of liberal peanut
butter have glued his mouth shut
with Skippy's "chunky style"
to silence his radishfull anullysis
and further the oppression of the
lumpenprolo.
I don't know, chunky style is
pretty lumpen. Why did the
democratic forces of free peanut
butter do this to old Norbert?
He advocated using the tactics
of people's war to educate the
masses.
Gee, that's sounds pretty
tough. What does that mean, "the
tactics of people's war?"
It means break into
small groups and go back to the
Horrni and nrrrnniâ„¢ " Onr> of

those code phrases.
Organize to do what?
Off peanut butter! Fire Peter
Pan! Rehabilitate Monday
mornings!
Hey, wait a second. You can't
off peanut butter, Why a recent

WELCOME

SWOPSI report shows that 73% of
people in Escondido live on
peanut butter, 81% in Manzanita
Park, 92% in off-campus housing.
And that's without even counting
the jelly! They claim it's for the
good of mankind.
Hah.
I see your point. But what can
these misguided dupes of
capitalist peanut butter do? I
mean, yogurt and crunchy granola
and organically grown rutabaga
can only go so far. Without
peanut butter they'll have to go
back to dorm food.
And that'll hasten the
revolution if anything will.
Boyoboy!
After the revolution, the

Those pigs!
We'll all eat strawberries and
cream.
Gee, I want to join the
Movement, now. Could you
introduce me to some of those
beautiful and passionate women
you were talking about?
I don't know. You'd have to
join the Harriet Beecher Stowe
Affinity Group.
Gee, I don't know if I could
hack that. Don't you have a Zesty
Chickies' Auxiliary to the John
Wayne Machismo Survival
Committee? You know, all power
comes out of the. . . .
Don't even think about it.
That's why my football coach
used to say. "Cold showers and
clean thoughts," he used to say.
This was in the locker room, all
sweaty and steamy, you know,
and all the guys kidding around.
"And you'll never be ashamed to
look your mother in the face," he
used to say. He ate peanut butter
every day of his life and thanked
God that he could do it in a free
country.
Yeah, sounds swell. Well, uh,
see ya around. Free Norbert.
Yeah. Free Norbert to you.
Rehabilitate Friday afternoon
classes.
All Power to the People's
Peanut Butter.
We will win.
