"Gonna take a miracle," Laura
Nyro and Labelle, Columbia,
KC30987.
Laura Nyro has a voice that has
often been likened to the sound
of fingernails scraping on a
blackboard. But I guess what this
album goes to show is that even
scraped fingernails can sound
excellent if they have good
material.
In short, this album is a gas.
This record can justly be
termed a team effort, because it
succeeds only through the
contributions of different
components.
First off is the presence of
Labelle, a female vocal trio which
normally records for Warner
Brothers. Old-timers might
remember the group from the
fifties and early sixties as Patti
Laßelle and the Bluebelles, one of
the endless stream of vocal groups
in the tradition of the Chiffons,
the Ronnettes, the Shirelles, et. al.
But in their latest incarnation,
they have never sounded better,
and their background vocals
perfectly balance out Nyro.
The second group of
contributors is the
Philadelphia-based producing
team of Gamble and Huff, who
control the careers of a number of
top stars, including Wilson
Pickett. Here, they provide a
magnificent job, tastefully using
strings only when they provide
something extra for the song. The
rest of their production work has
been brilliant, but here they
outdo themselves. As opposed to
the Phil Spector school of
producers, they stick closer to the
basics, and the results are
amazing.
Heart-warming Oldies
The third major force on the
record is Nyro herself. According

to the ads for the record, the
choice of material is hers, and the
songs she has chosen will warm
the hearts of many an oldies
freak. There is material by
Smokey Robinson, Marvin Gaye,
Jerry Leiber and Phil Spector, and
the team of Holland, Dozier, and
Holland that was responsible for
many of Motown's earliest hits.
The songs themselves should
hit a responsive chord. They are
all familiar tunes from the fifties
and early sixties. "Spanish
Harlem," "You've Really Got a
Hold on Me," "Jimmy Mack,"
and "Dancin' in the Streets."
As far as performance goes,
Nyro has never been better.
"Spanish Harlem" has been done
in three different ways, and all of
them have been hits: by Ben E.
King, A 1 Martino, and Aretha
Franklin. One would think that its
possibilities have been just about
fully explored, but Nyro does
nothing short of adding another
dimension to it. Similarly,
"Monkey Time/Dancin' in the
Streets" and "You've Really Got
a Hold on Me" are both excellent,
despite their familiarity.
Special mention should be
made of Ronnie Baker, the
album's bass player, who does a
superb job on all cuts, but is
especially noticeable for his
outstanding work on "Hold on
Me" and "Nowhere to Run."
It may be argued, perhaps with
some justification, that nobody
could come up with a bad record
given this sort of material. That
may be true, but it should not
detract from the fact that this is
still one great album.

Farther Along, the Byrds,
Columbia, KC 31050.
What can you say about a good

group that died?
A long time ago, the Byrds
were five from Los Angeles. They
were then Jim MeGuinn, Mike
Clark, Chris Hillman, David
Crosby, and Gene Clark, and they
did some very good stuff indeed,
as perhaps the best interpreters of
Dylan material outside of Dylan
himself. For confirmation, listen
to their version of "My Back
Pages" from "Younger Than
Yesterday,"and compare it with
the Dylan cut on the recent "Bob
Dylan's Greatest Hits Volume 2."
Besides this, the Byrds were
also at least competent in writing
their own material, and in the case
at least of "Eight Miles High,"
they were very, very good.
But as this album graphically
shows, all that is now past.
One Less Byrd
The Byrds are now four: Roger
(formerly Jim) MeGuinn, Gene
Parsons, Clarence White, and Skip
Battin. In arriving at this
configuration, they have gone
through enough personnel changes
to staff a number of groups with
their rejects, including the Flying
Burrito Brothers and of course,
Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young.
But now the Byrds are no
longer a group by themselves.
They are three other men hired
and paid a salary by the "owner"
of the group, the only original
member left, MeGuinn. And, if
"Farther Along" is an indication,
they play music just like the hired
hands they are.
"Tiffany Queen" opens the
album, and promises much more
than the rest of the record can
deliver. It is a good-timey, Lovin'
Spoonful-type electric fun song
that would probably make a good
single if the group is so inclined. It
is not a great song, but certainly
good enough, and in comparison

with the rest of this dismal album
it shines.
What is left of the album is
universally bad, save perhaps a
spirited (if nothing better) version
of "So Fine." Particularly bad
cuts include "America's Great
National Pastime," "Antique
Sanday," and "Precious Kate,"
which sounds like it is being sung
by a constipated Bob Dylan.
All in all, a most eminently
avoidable record. It should
immediately be crossed off all
"must get" shopping lists. Better
you should invest your money in
an Albanian oil stock. You'll get
more enjoyment out of it.

Commentary: Don McLean's
"American Pie."
Don McLean's "American Pie"
is one of the most invigorating
and provocative rock singles to
come out in a long time. Many
accuse it of being obscure and
ambiguous, and perhaps rightly
so, but the fact still remains that
it has evoked such a dialogue. Can
"Sugar Sugar" make the same
claim?
Despite the ambiguities, one
can assemble at least the
foundations of the song. It begins
by recounting the reaction the the
February 3, 1959 deaths of thee
of the biggest names in rock and
roll, Ritchie Valens ("La Bamba,"
"Donna"), J.P. "The Big Bopper"
Richardson ("Chantilly Lace")
and Buddy Holly ("Maybe Baby,"
'That'll Be the Day," "Well All
Right," "Peggy Sue").
The major emphasis is placed
on the death of Holly, at 21
already one of the giants of the
field. "But February made me
shiver, with every paper I'd
deliver. Bad news on the doorstep,
I couldn't take one more step. I

don't remember if I cried when I
read about his widowed bride. But
something touched me deep inside
the day the music died."
The time element then careens
forward. We find Dylan as a Jester
who usurps the crown of those he
performs for, the Beatles as the
sergeants who play at a football
game, the Stones as the
personification of Satan.
The point of the song seems to
be on the surface that rock is dead
as it was once known. But
McLean may be indicating that it
has died only to be reborn.
Rebirth of Rock
He tells us early in the song
that the music died with the death
of Holly. Yet the music lived on,
resurrected when the Beatles hit
the world four and a half years
later. The mid-sixties represent
this rebirth of rock. The Byrds are
there, and Dylan and the Beatles
and the Stones, and for a while it

is right again.
But just as Holly's death
marked the end of the first era, so
does the breakup of the Beatles,
in form if not in name, signal the
end of the second. John Lennon
has said that the last Beatles
album was Sgt. Pepper, because
the next album the group released
at the end of 1968, "The
Beatles," was made up of songs
done not as a group but as Paul
with sidemen, John with sidemen,
etc. At the football game where
"sergeants played a marching
tune," when the players returned
to the field "the marching band
refused to yield. Do you recall
what was revealed the day the
music died?" This was the second
death of rock, with Dylan "on the
sidelines in a cast" from his
near-fatal motorcycle accident that
made him unable to participate.
This is the period we are now

in. McLean says that he recently
went down to the "magic store,
where I heard the music years
before, but the man there said the
music wouldn't play." Notice he
doesn't say "the music wouldn't
play any more," despite the fact
that the extra syllables would still
fit rhythmically. The music will
play again, whether in ten months
or ten years.
Early in the song, McLean
sings, "now do you believe in rock
and roll, can music save your
mortal soul?" in apparent
reference to the Lovin Spoonful's
"Do You Believe in Magic," where
John Sebastian sings, "I'll tell you
about the magic that'll free your
soul, but it's just trying to tell a
stranger about rock and roll."
Don McLean seems to be
admitting that the music has died.
But I think he still believes in
magic. So do 1.

A MARVELOUS NIGHT FOR A MOONDANCE—Van Morrison had it all together over the weekend at
The Boarding House Theatre in San Francisco. Morrison and band made up for a had show they put on
last fall at Winterland, much to the delight of the Morrison freaks who actually saw Van open his eyes and
look at his audience.
