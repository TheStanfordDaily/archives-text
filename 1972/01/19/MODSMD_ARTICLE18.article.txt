# Wild Night With Morrison
## 
### CHRIS PECK 
Listening to Van Morrison's
Moondance, Tupelo Honey or
Band and Street Choir album late
at night with somebody you dig is
one of the brightest, happiest
musical experiences imaginable.
There's a a spark of pure smile in
Morrison's songs that makes him
immensely popular among young
people in love. Unfortunately
many lovers and would-be lovers
have left Van's live performances
wishing they had stayed home
next to the stereo because
Morrison live sometimes isn't as
good as Morrison on vinyl.
For the lucky few who saw Van
Morrison at The Boarding House
Theater in San Francisco over the
weekend however, there was a
special musical treat. For once
the joyous music of this complex
man burst through the usual stiff,
worried face of Van Morrison in
concert. The resulting music
rocked and rolled, laughed and
cried till people were dancing and
cheering like never before at a
Morrison stint.
There are a number of reasons
Van Morrison at the Boarding
House Theatre was an outstanding
show. The theatre itself played a
big part in making* the weekend
shows successful, since it only
seats 300 people and gave the
audience and Morrison more
contact with each other.
Perhaps it was the smaller
theatre, or the addition of two
new band members including

guitarist Doug Messenger, but for
whatever reason, Morrison
appeared much more relaxed than
he did at his Winterland shows last
fall.
Happy Mood
Joking around with Messenger,
bass guitarist Bill Church and
saxophonist Jack Schroer before
the show, drinking beer and
smoking cigars, Morrinson hinted
at his happy mood and the
crowd greeted him with smiles
and applause as he walked on
stage.
The friendly atmosphere at
The Boarding House
performances was enhanced by
the clever and original perfomance
of acoustical guitarist Ken Bloom
who took the second spot on the
bill. Bloom has guitar style akin to
Keo Kottke and a sort of Neil
Young type voice that sang of
"Rock and Roll Rose", a hip LA
chick who drives around in a '54
Nash looking for action.
Anyone who has been to Van
Morrison concerts knows that
Morrison isn't a performer that
does Joe Cocker or Mick Jagger
body gyrations on stage. Instead
Morrision uses lots of hand
motions to direct his band, often
covers up one of his ears to hear
his own voice and even walks
around the stage during a song
listening to the other band
members and making sure he's
getting the sound he wants from
them.
It's unfair to Morrision to call

these techniques "unpolished" or
"distracting." The whole groove
of listening to the group involves
the marvelous way that his band
fits itself around Morrison's
powerfrul voice. Also, if watching
Van doesn't appeal to you, try
keeping an eye on bass guitarist
Church. He smiles and peeks
around the stage like a cat that
has just downed a huge turkey
and who will be content for a
week.
The key to a good Van
Morrison performance is whether
he can bring Church and
saxophonist Jack Schroer and
Boots Stuart Houston together
with his voice. The influence of
jazz in Morrison's music isn't
hard to see, but it is difficult for
Morrison sometimes to keep the
band cohesive enough to make
good jazz renditions of their
songs. At The Boarding House the
balance between Van's voice and
the saxophones was nearly
perfect.
On Friday, at the end of
"Tupelo Honey" when Morrison
finally whispered
She san Angel of the first degree
for the last time, the crowd sat
silent, digging the touching beauty
of the music. Then is when you
realize what a showman Van
really is.
Just like Elvis
That's not to say he can't rock
and roll with the best bands
around either. Cranking up his

saxophone men into and old Elvis
Presley song, "Hound Dog."
Morrison had 'em dancing and
cheering in the aisles. And would
you believe it? Van even grabbed
the microphone at one point and
bent over and crooned into it in
true Elvis style.
The best song Morrison did at
The Boarding House, and perhaps
the best song he's ever written is
"Into The Mystic." Somehow his
wailing, searching voice is at it's
very best wheen he sings
We were born before the wind,
Also younger than the sun,
and then the line about the fog
horns blowing that mystically
blends into Schroer's saxophone,
Get out Moondance and listen to
the song and then imagine
Morrison doing it even better on
stage.
"Into The Mystic" was so good
it was hard to not look off into
space and really feel your soul
and spirits fly, just like the song
says.
After Friday's show was over
and the band had come back on
stage to do "Workin" and "Wild
Nights" as encores, bass guitarist
Bill Church was sitting on the
stage talking to a goup of people.
"You know,"he said, "I enjoyed
playing tonight more than I have
for a long time. It was a lot of fun
tonight."
None of the Van Morrison
freaks at The Boarding House
could have agreed more
completely.

There's a a spark of pure smile in
Morrison's songs that makes him
immensely popular among young
people in love. Unfortunately
many lovers and would-be lovers
have left Van's live performances
wishing they had stayed home
next to the stereo because
Morrison live sometimes isn't as
good as Morrison on vinyl.
For the lucky few who saw Van
Morrison at The Boarding House
Theater in San Francisco over the
weekend however, there was a
special musical treat. For once
the joyous music of this complex
man burst through the usual stiff,
worried face of Van Morrison in
concert. The resulting music
rocked and rolled, laughed and
cried till people were dancing and
cheering like never before at a
Morrison stint.
There are a number of reasons
Van Morrison at the Boarding
House Theatre was an outstanding
show. The theatre itself played a
big part in making* the weekend
shows successful, since it only
seats 300 people and gave the
audience and Morrison more
contact with each other.
Perhaps it was the smaller
theatre, or the addition of two
new band members including

guitarist Doug Messenger, but for
whatever reason, Morrison
appeared much more relaxed than
he did at his Winterland shows last
fall.
Happy Mood
Joking around with Messenger,
bass guitarist Bill Church and
saxophonist Jack Schroer before
the show, drinking beer and
smoking cigars, Morrinson hinted
at his happy mood and the
crowd greeted him with smiles
and applause as he walked on
stage.
The friendly atmosphere at
The Boarding House
performances was enhanced by
the clever and original perfomance
of acoustical guitarist Ken Bloom
who took the second spot on the
bill. Bloom has guitar style akin to
Keo Kottke and a sort of Neil
Young type voice that sang of
"Rock and Roll Rose", a hip LA
chick who drives around in a '54
Nash looking for action.
Anyone who has been to Van
Morrison concerts knows that
Morrison isn't a performer that
does Joe Cocker or Mick Jagger
body gyrations on stage. Instead
Morrision uses lots of hand
motions to direct his band, often
covers up one of his ears to hear
his own voice and even walks
around the stage during a song
listening to the other band
members and making sure he's
getting the sound he wants from
them.
It's unfair to Morrision to call

these techniques "unpolished" or
"distracting." The whole groove
of listening to the group involves
the marvelous way that his band
fits itself around Morrison's
powerfrul voice. Also, if watching
Van doesn't appeal to you, try
keeping an eye on bass guitarist
Church. He smiles and peeks
around the stage like a cat that
has just downed a huge turkey
and who will be content for a
week.
The key to a good Van
Morrison performance is whether
he can bring Church and
saxophonist Jack Schroer and
Boots Stuart Houston together
with his voice. The influence of
jazz in Morrison's music isn't
hard to see, but it is difficult for
Morrison sometimes to keep the
band cohesive enough to make
good jazz renditions of their
songs. At The Boarding House the
balance between Van's voice and
the saxophones was nearly
perfect.
On Friday, at the end of
"Tupelo Honey" when Morrison
finally whispered
She san Angel of the first degree
for the last time, the crowd sat
silent, digging the touching beauty
of the music. Then is when you
realize what a showman Van
really is.
Just like Elvis
That's not to say he can't rock
and roll with the best bands
around either. Cranking up his

saxophone men into and old Elvis
Presley song, "Hound Dog."
Morrison had 'em dancing and
cheering in the aisles. And would
you believe it? Van even grabbed
the microphone at one point and
bent over and crooned into it in
true Elvis style.
The best song Morrison did at
The Boarding House, and perhaps
the best song he's ever written is
"Into The Mystic." Somehow his
wailing, searching voice is at it's
very best wheen he sings
We were born before the wind,
Also younger than the sun,
and then the line about the fog
horns blowing that mystically
blends into Schroer's saxophone,
Get out Moondance and listen to
the song and then imagine
Morrison doing it even better on
stage.
"Into The Mystic" was so good
it was hard to not look off into
space and really feel your soul
and spirits fly, just like the song
says.
After Friday's show was over
and the band had come back on
stage to do "Workin" and "Wild
Nights" as encores, bass guitarist
Bill Church was sitting on the
stage talking to a goup of people.
"You know,"he said, "I enjoyed
playing tonight more than I have
for a long time. It was a lot of fun
tonight."
None of the Van Morrison
freaks at The Boarding House
could have agreed more
completely.
Listening to Van Morrison's
Moondance, Tupelo Honey or
Band and Street Choir album late
at night with somebody you dig is
one of the brightest, happiest
musical experiences imaginable.

wishing they had stayed home
next to the stereo because
Morrison live sometimes isn't as
good as Morrison on vinyl.
For the lucky few who saw Van
Morrison at The Boarding House
Theater in San Francisco over the
weekend however, there was a
special musical treat. For once
the joyous music of this complex
man burst through the usual stiff,
worried face of Van Morrison in
concert. The resulting music
rocked and rolled, laughed and
cried till people were dancing and
cheering like never before at a
Morrison stint.
There are a number of reasons
Van Morrison at the Boarding
House Theatre was an outstanding
show. The theatre itself played a
big part in making* the weekend
shows successful, since it only
seats 300 people and gave the
audience and Morrison more
contact with each other.
Perhaps it was the smaller
theatre, or the addition of two
new band members including

guitarist Doug Messenger, but for
whatever reason, Morrison
appeared much more relaxed than
he did at his Winterland shows last
fall.
Happy Mood
Joking around with Messenger,
bass guitarist Bill Church and
saxophonist Jack Schroer before
the show, drinking beer and
smoking cigars, Morrinson hinted
at his happy mood and the
crowd greeted him with smiles
and applause as he walked on
stage.
The friendly atmosphere at
The Boarding House
performances was enhanced by
the clever and original perfomance
of acoustical guitarist Ken Bloom
who took the second spot on the
bill. Bloom has guitar style akin to
Keo Kottke and a sort of Neil
Young type voice that sang of
"Rock and Roll Rose", a hip LA
chick who drives around in a '54
Nash looking for action.
Anyone who has been to Van
Morrison concerts knows that
Morrison isn't a performer that
does Joe Cocker or Mick Jagger
body gyrations on stage. Instead
Morrision uses lots of hand
motions to direct his band, often
covers up one of his ears to hear
his own voice and even walks
around the stage during a song
listening to the other band
members and making sure he's
getting the sound he wants from
them.
It's unfair to Morrision to call

these techniques "unpolished" or
"distracting." The whole groove
of listening to the group involves
the marvelous way that his band
fits itself around Morrison's
powerfrul voice. Also, if watching
Van doesn't appeal to you, try
keeping an eye on bass guitarist
Church. He smiles and peeks
around the stage like a cat that
has just downed a huge turkey
and who will be content for a
week.
The key to a good Van
Morrison performance is whether
he can bring Church and
saxophonist Jack Schroer and
Boots Stuart Houston together
with his voice. The influence of
jazz in Morrison's music isn't
hard to see, but it is difficult for
Morrison sometimes to keep the
band cohesive enough to make
good jazz renditions of their
songs. At The Boarding House the
balance between Van's voice and
the saxophones was nearly
perfect.
On Friday, at the end of
"Tupelo Honey" when Morrison
finally whispered
She san Angel of the first degree
for the last time, the crowd sat
silent, digging the touching beauty
of the music. Then is when you
realize what a showman Van
really is.
Just like Elvis
That's not to say he can't rock
and roll with the best bands
around either. Cranking up his

saxophone men into and old Elvis
Presley song, "Hound Dog."
Morrison had 'em dancing and
cheering in the aisles. And would
you believe it? Van even grabbed
the microphone at one point and
bent over and crooned into it in
true Elvis style.
The best song Morrison did at
The Boarding House, and perhaps
the best song he's ever written is
"Into The Mystic." Somehow his
wailing, searching voice is at it's
very best wheen he sings
We were born before the wind,
Also younger than the sun,
and then the line about the fog
horns blowing that mystically
blends into Schroer's saxophone,
Get out Moondance and listen to
the song and then imagine
Morrison doing it even better on
stage.
"Into The Mystic" was so good
it was hard to not look off into
space and really feel your soul
and spirits fly, just like the song
says.
After Friday's show was over
and the band had come back on
stage to do "Workin" and "Wild
Nights" as encores, bass guitarist
Bill Church was sitting on the
stage talking to a goup of people.
"You know,"he said, "I enjoyed
playing tonight more than I have
for a long time. It was a lot of fun
tonight."
None of the Van Morrison
freaks at The Boarding House
could have agreed more
completely.
Listening to Van Morrison's
Moondance, Tupelo Honey or
Band and Street Choir album late
at night with somebody you dig is
one of the brightest, happiest
musical experiences imaginable.
There's a a spark of pure smile in
Morrison's songs that makes him
immensely popular among young
people in love. Unfortunately
many lovers and would-be lovers
have left Van's live performances
wishing they had stayed home
next to the stereo because
Morrison live sometimes isn't as
