# '...Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds'
## Disappointing Prize Winner 
### STU ALLEN 
The current San Francisco
production of "The Effects of
Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon
Marigolds" demonstrates either
the fallability of reviewers, or the
difficulties of taking a hit show on
tour or both. The play is being
advertised under banners
proclaiming "Best American Play,
N.Y. Drama Critics Award; 1971
Pulitzer Prize Winner;" and "See
this play—Clive Barnes, N.Y.
Times."
One should not be taken in by
Barnes just because he is the most
widely-read, most powerful drama
critic in the country. He was
talking about the New York
Off-Broadway version of this play,
starring Sada Thompson, the
brightest star in New York.
The San Francisco show would
not win the awards and the
extravagant praise one sees
advertised. The problem could be
in the casting changes that were
made, as Thompson was left
behind in N.Y. The play itself is
flawed, however, and one wonders
how in the world Thompson's
performance could have won for
it the acclaim it received.
At any rate, the story is about

school age daughters in the
slovenly house and former
vegetable shop in which her father
brought her up. Beatrice, played
by Dorothy Loudin, is sometimes
brutally straightforward, as when
she reminds her timid younger
daughter, Tillie, of her ugly face.
Painfully Coy
She can also be painfully coy,
as when she flirts over the phone
with Tillie's science teacher, by
her words giving him the choice of
appearing as a fool or as a queer.
She is most of all pitiful, however,
unable to accept and move
beyond the circumstances that
have victimized her.
Her two daughters are victims
also. Ruth, the elder, is an
epileptic who is painfully aware
that everyone else in town knows
her history: a nervous breakdown
and a generally unbalanced mental
state. The younger, Tillie, is more
indeterminate: she is encouraged
to respect herself by her science
teacher, and she succeeds, in spite
of her mother's viciousness.
Tillie, played well by Kathyryn
Baumann, enters a science fair and
her project is to grow marigold
seeds that have been exposed to
atomic radiation (Get it? "The
T? Pf r\ 112 n Pnt'C

The result is that some grow to be
interesting oddities, while others
are ugly mutants.
The theme of the play lies in
the comparison between
marigolds exposed to radiation
and people exposed to other
people. On stage is a family of
mutilated people, tied together by
kinship, but torn apart by hatred.
Genuine Pity
The appeal of the play is that
one becomes somewhat involved
with the characters. When
Beatrice is recounting her father's
tragic death, one genuinely pities
her. The involvement thus lessens,
but doesn't eliminate, the hatred
one feels toward her for his
mistreatment of Ruth and Tillie.
All in all, the play is a
melodramatic failure. These
emotions come to the audience,
but they are not quite real: they
pass as quickly as they come. The
acting is uneven, without feeling
at times. Furthermore, the play
includes some stupid effects: the
background music, on a tape
recorder, reminds one of "General
Hospital," as does one particularly
silly scene, a speech by girl
explaining her science

I left the theater
disappointed—having felt very
little magic sustained among the
cast, and none among the
audience.
