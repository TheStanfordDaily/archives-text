# Poll Favors Franklin
## 
### BOB LITTERMAN 
A random poll of students
conducted by the Daily early this
week found that only 37 percent
agreed with the faculty advisory board
decision that Professor H. Bruce
Franklin should be dismissed.
Forty-six percent felt he should not,
and 17 percent said they had not
decided or had no opinion.
Almost three-fourths of the
students polled also said they would
like to see an open Trustees meeting on
the issue.
The poll, conducted by telephone
from a random sampling of the
student directory, reached 161
students out of a sample population of
183. The first question read, "On
January sth, the seven man faculty
advisory board announced their
decision in the case of tenured
associate professor of English H. Bruce
Franklin, recommending he be
dismissed from the faculty. Do you
agree with their conclusion that
Franklin should be dismissed?"
The numerical results were 60 yes,
74 no, and 27 no opinion.
The second question read, "Would
you like to see an open Trustees
meeting on this issue?" These results
were 118 yes, 28 no, and 15 no
opinion.
The results were also broken down

by sex and undergraduate versus
graduate status. The complete
breakdown follows:
Question 1
no
yes no opinion
female
undergrads 10 19 6
male
undergrads 14 22 7
female grads 5 9 6
male grads 31 24 8
Question 2
no
yes no opinion
female
undergrads 27 6 2
male
undergrads 33 7 3
female grads 14 2 4
male grads 44 13 6
The names picked were not selected
to proportionately represent
departments or classes, thus the slight
relative over-representation of
graduate students, for example, was a
chance occurance.
The selection process was approved
beforehand by Communication
Department chairman Nathan
Maccoby, and most of the telephoning
was done by non-Daily personnel,
hired without knowing what the poll
would be about.
