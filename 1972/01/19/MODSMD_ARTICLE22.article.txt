# Experiment To Bring Visits For Soledad Inmates
## 
### 
Beto Perea, a Chicano inmate at Soledad prison believes that
outsiders are afraid to come to the correctional institution located in
the lush, flat Salinas Valley. "It makes me angry that although we
have classrooms, they are empty every evening, because there is no
one to teach us."
Friends Outside, an organization dedicated to helping prisoners and
their families, has obtained permission from the Soledad
administration for an experiment. Prison officials will permit Friends
Outside to bring in four to six couples who will meet one evening a
week with inmates who have no visitors. Each of the convicts would
have a release date approximately six months ahead of the beginning
of these visits.
Rosemary Goodenough, founder of Friends Outside, says,"The
least one could expect from the project is that 12-16 men had talked
with 12-16 people from the free world. They had heard young couples
talk about their lives, hopes and fears and their children. They had at
least a few people who wanted them to succeed and who would be
disappointed if they failed.
Couples who are interested in participating should phone the
Friends Outside office at 948-3235. Mrs. Goodenough cautions that
persons who want only to expound their own political and religious
ideologies should not apply.
