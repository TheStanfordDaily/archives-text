## Mike White—The Man In The Middle 
### Charlie Hoffman 
In the latest development in
the Stanford-California mystery
coaching shuttle, Berkeley coach
Ray Willsey stepped down as head
football coach and athletic
director yesterday.
It was reported in Monday's
Daily that Willsey would be asked
for his resignation as part of a
general housecleaning in the wake
of the NCAA's investigation of
the Isaac Curtis-Larry Brumsey
eligibility affair. Chancellor Alfred
Balker released the following
statement late yesterday:"I have
received and accepted Ray
Willsey's resignation today. He has
coached Cal well in its most
difficult years. .. . We wish him
the best."
Willsey's resignation was the
only official development
yesterday in the Bay Area
coaching mess, but it appears that
other decisions have been made
and are merely awaiting

announcement. Dave Maggard,
Cal's head track coach, is
expected to be elevated to the
position of athletic director
today. The 32-year-old coach has
been at Berkeley for three years
and is very highly regarded.
At Stanford, the committee
headed by Geology professor
John Harbaugh will meet today at
noon to review applications for
the vacated head coaching
position. Both President Richard
Lyman and acting athletic
director Bob Young have urged all
haste in choosing John Ralston's
successor. Ralston recommended
Mike White for the job when he
left for Denver and it has been
assumed that Stanford will offer
White the head coaching position.
Lyman's sickness and the
absence of Young (who was
attending the annual NCAA
meeting in Florida) has delayed
the formal selection process

required by Stanford's
Affirmative Action Program. This
administrative action has slowed
up the selection process on The
Farm enough to allow Cal to get
in a bid for White's services.
Maggard respects White's
abilities and Payton Jordan
revealed that his young Berkeley
rival expressed a desire to have
White move across the Bay in a
conversation between the two this
fall. It appears that the first thing
Maggard will try to do after being
appointed athletic director will be
to try and bring Mike White back
to Cal.
White will then have three solid
coaching offers from Cal,
Stanford, and the Denver
Broncos. The young Indian
assistant coach will not have much
time to decide either, because
Ralston has reportedly set a
deadline of this Thursday for
Stanford to decide on a head

coach. Ralston has to gather his
new staff immediately in order to
prepare for the annual college
draft, February 1-2.
Mike White has been the
offensive "brains" behind the
winning and innovative Indians
and he is by far the man most
likely to maintain the successful
momentum of our football
program. The team and the school
need his talents desperately in
order to have any reasonable
chance of fulfilling John Ralston's
dream of four consecutive Rose
Bowls.
A coaching offer from Cal,
White's alma mater, would indeed
be tempting. It is my hope,
however, that White will stay and
work with his players here
towards another dream of Ralston
and his staff, a national
championship.

John Harbaugh will meet today at
noon to review applications for
the vacated head coaching
position. Both President Richard
Lyman and acting athletic
director Bob Young have urged all
haste in choosing John Ralston's
successor. Ralston recommended
Mike White for the job when he
left for Denver and it has been
assumed that Stanford will offer
White the head coaching position.
Lyman's sickness and the
absence of Young (who was
attending the annual NCAA
meeting in Florida) has delayed
the formal selection process

required by Stanford's
Affirmative Action Program. This
administrative action has slowed
up the selection process on The
Farm enough to allow Cal to get
in a bid for White's services.
Maggard respects White's
abilities and Payton Jordan
revealed that his young Berkeley
rival expressed a desire to have
White move across the Bay in a
conversation between the two this
fall. It appears that the first thing
Maggard will try to do after being
appointed athletic director will be
to try and bring Mike White back
to Cal.
White will then have three solid
coaching offers from Cal,
Stanford, and the Denver
Broncos. The young Indian
assistant coach will not have much
time to decide either, because
Ralston has reportedly set a
deadline of this Thursday for
Stanford to decide on a head

coach. Ralston has to gather his
new staff immediately in order to
prepare for the annual college
draft, February 1-2.
Mike White has been the
offensive "brains" behind the
winning and innovative Indians
and he is by far the man most
likely to maintain the successful
momentum of our football
program. The team and the school
need his talents desperately in
order to have any reasonable
chance of fulfilling John Ralston's
dream of four consecutive Rose
Bowls.
A coaching offer from Cal,
White's alma mater, would indeed
be tempting. It is my hope,
however, that White will stay and
work with his players here
towards another dream of Ralston
and his staff, a national
championship.

A BIG DECISION TO MAKE—Stanford Assistant Coach Mike White
hangs his head on the sidelines during the Indians' 24-23 loss to
Washington State last season. Most of White's moments last year were
happier than this one, but now he mast soberly decide where he is
going to coach next year.
In the latest development in
the Stanford-California mystery
coaching shuttle, Berkeley coach
Ray Willsey stepped down as head
football coach and athletic
director yesterday.
It was reported in Monday's
Daily that Willsey would be asked
for his resignation as part of a
general housecleaning in the wake
of the NCAA's investigation of
the Isaac Curtis-Larry Brumsey
eligibility affair. Chancellor Alfred
Balker released the following
statement late yesterday:"I have
received and accepted Ray
Willsey's resignation today. He has
coached Cal well in its most
difficult years. .. . We wish him
the best."
Willsey's resignation was the
only official development
yesterday in the Bay Area
coaching mess, but it appears that
other decisions have been made
and are merely awaiting

announcement. Dave Maggard,
Cal's head track coach, is
expected to be elevated to the
position of athletic director
today. The 32-year-old coach has
been at Berkeley for three years
and is very highly regarded.
At Stanford, the committee
headed by Geology professor
John Harbaugh will meet today at
noon to review applications for

position. Both President Richard
