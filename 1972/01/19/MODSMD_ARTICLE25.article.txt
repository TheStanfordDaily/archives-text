## Pac-8 Basketballâ€”UCLA, USC Style 
### Don Tollefson 
The Stanford and Cal basketball teams
went south last weekend to face USC and
UCLA and fortunately there was one
competitive game out of four. Through the
Los Angeles miracle of late-night tape delayed
TV rebroadcasts of USC and UCLA games, I
was able to attend both Stanford games and
still see most of Cal's two contests.
In watching the four teams in action, two
things impressed me the most. First of all,
Stanford's basketball fortunes are improving.
Despite a sub-par performance by 6-9 center
Mike Mann, who had played awesomely
against Washington a week ago, the Indians
were able to nearly upset the 10th ranked SC
Trojans on Saturday night.
And the Indians came close with a young
front line made up of sophomores Dave Frost,
Steve Shupe and Mann and junior Bob Buell.
Guard Claude Terry, who scored 42 points
last weekend, will be gone next season along
with the other current starting guard Bob
Nicholson, but it seems as if at least a few
players off this year's undefeated freshmen
team have the ability to be at least adequate
performers and probably much more as
varsity guards next season.
Most importantly, Stanford's first real "big
man" will move up to the varsity next season.
Seven-footer Rich Kelley has looked
unpolished at times this year, but his great
potential is indisputable. His presence will
allow the sharp-shooting Mann to move to a
more-natural forward spot and there will be
plenty of talented people to choose from for
the other forward position.
Brighter Future
If a couple of freshmen can mature quickly
at guard, things could be much brighter for
Stanford basketball next season. With their
present personnel however, the Cards have
been playing well in the last few weeks and
they will undoubtedly finish with a much
better record than their 6-20 of a year ago.
It may seem to be a bit early to be
discussing next year's basketball picture, but
six other Pac-8 schools in addition to Stanford
might as well start looking ahead. The second

impression coming out of last weekend is even
more clear and immediately apparent than
Stanford's improving basketball program.
UCLA is definitely once again the class of the
Pacific-8 and very possibly the country.
I have now seen UCLA in five of their 12
victories this season and on the basis of seeing
USC twice last weekend, I would say that
their chances of beating the Bruins are not as
good as many observers have been claiming.
But isn't this the UCLA team that lost
Rowe, Wicks, Patterson and Booker. Yes it is.
But it's also the one which will soon make
Walton, Lee, Wilkes and Farmer as
well-known as the one remaining starter from
last year's NCAA Championship, guard Henry
Bibby.
Up Front
Up front the Bruins start two rangy, quick
jumping-jack forwards in Keith Wilkes (6-6)
and Larry Farmer (6-5). Both average in the
10-15 point range. They flank Bill Walton, a
6-11 red haired center who will be the next in
a long line of superstars to come out of
UCLA.
After Walton had demolished both
Stanford's and Cal's centers and teams, Coach
John Wooden said, "He's just amazing. He's
improving in every game. I really didn't think
he'd be this dominating so soon. But I knew
he had the ability to dominate like he is.
"I think Bill is as good a shot blocker as
any college shot blocker I've seen with the
exception of Bill Russell. He blocks the shots
so cleanly. He doesn't swat it out of bounds.
He always seems to keep control of it."
Wooden characterized well this phenomenal
19 year old who scored 52 points and
garnered 36 rebounds while playing less than
two complete games last weekend.
Behind the front line at the guard positions
are Bibby, who is doing more shooting than
he had as the Bruin's "quarterback" last year
and who is averaging just under 20 points, and
Greg Lee, a solid, sophomore performer.
Strong Reserves
The Bruins' second-stringers could probably

beat most teams by themselves. Walton calls
6-11 reserve center Swen Nater, "the best
center I've faced all year." Forwards Larry
Hollyfield and Vince Carson can both be quite
impressive and if Hollyfield could curb a very
quick temper, he might be an even greater
asset. Reserve guards Tommy Curtis and Andy
Hill continue the pattern of solid performers
and so the beat goes on.
USC, who is also undefeated in four league
contests, does have a big front line with Ron
Riley (6-9) and Joe Mackey (6-6) flanking
Mike Westra (6-10). Seniors Riley and Mackey
are both quite talented, but Riley's
inconsistency, although lessened from last
year, is still apparent. And Westra playing
against Walton will probably be like Wilt
Chamberlain against the infamous Tom
Boerwinkle of Chicago.
USC may try to insert 6-10 Bill Taylor at
times to control Walton, but his lack of speed
could eventually only hurt the Trojans. In the
backcourt, Paul Westphal may be the best
guard in the Pac-8 as Cal coach Jim Padgett
claims (although a lot of people including
myself would give Claude Terry an equal
chance at that honor) but he and his running
mate Dana Anderson would have to perform
incredibly to power the Trojans past UCLA.
SC might put together a phenomenal game
and somehow beat the Bruins. Don't bet on it.
The Bruins look like they'll breeze through
Pac-8 play pretty easily. Young as they are,
they might have trouble in the NCAA
regionals, especially if they have to face
Brigham Young in a hostile Provo, Utah.
But you just have to think the Bruins will
probably overcome the obstacles in Utah and
return to the LA Sports Arena to try and win
their sixth straight NCAA crown in
mid-March. Bibby may be the only notable
returnee on the court, but on the Bruin bench
sits Wooden, the architect of the greatest
dynasty in college sports history. But Wooden
doesn't have much time to reflect on his
construction. His building program is still
going full speed ahead with no end in sight.

allow the sharp-shooting Mann to move to a
more-natural forward spot and there will be
plenty of talented people to choose from for
the other forward position.
Brighter Future
If a couple of freshmen can mature quickly
at guard, things could be much brighter for
Stanford basketball next season. With their
present personnel however, the Cards have
been playing well in the last few weeks and
they will undoubtedly finish with a much
better record than their 6-20 of a year ago.
It may seem to be a bit early to be
discussing next year's basketball picture, but
six other Pac-8 schools in addition to Stanford
might as well start looking ahead. The second

impression coming out of last weekend is even
more clear and immediately apparent than
Stanford's improving basketball program.
UCLA is definitely once again the class of the
Pacific-8 and very possibly the country.
I have now seen UCLA in five of their 12
victories this season and on the basis of seeing
USC twice last weekend, I would say that
their chances of beating the Bruins are not as
good as many observers have been claiming.
But isn't this the UCLA team that lost
Rowe, Wicks, Patterson and Booker. Yes it is.
But it's also the one which will soon make
Walton, Lee, Wilkes and Farmer as
well-known as the one remaining starter from
last year's NCAA Championship, guard Henry
Bibby.
Up Front
Up front the Bruins start two rangy, quick
jumping-jack forwards in Keith Wilkes (6-6)
and Larry Farmer (6-5). Both average in the
10-15 point range. They flank Bill Walton, a
6-11 red haired center who will be the next in
a long line of superstars to come out of
UCLA.
After Walton had demolished both
Stanford's and Cal's centers and teams, Coach
John Wooden said, "He's just amazing. He's
improving in every game. I really didn't think
he'd be this dominating so soon. But I knew
he had the ability to dominate like he is.
"I think Bill is as good a shot blocker as
any college shot blocker I've seen with the
exception of Bill Russell. He blocks the shots
so cleanly. He doesn't swat it out of bounds.
He always seems to keep control of it."
Wooden characterized well this phenomenal
19 year old who scored 52 points and
garnered 36 rebounds while playing less than
two complete games last weekend.
Behind the front line at the guard positions
are Bibby, who is doing more shooting than
he had as the Bruin's "quarterback" last year
and who is averaging just under 20 points, and
Greg Lee, a solid, sophomore performer.
Strong Reserves
The Bruins' second-stringers could probably

beat most teams by themselves. Walton calls
6-11 reserve center Swen Nater, "the best
center I've faced all year." Forwards Larry
Hollyfield and Vince Carson can both be quite
impressive and if Hollyfield could curb a very
quick temper, he might be an even greater
asset. Reserve guards Tommy Curtis and Andy
Hill continue the pattern of solid performers
and so the beat goes on.
USC, who is also undefeated in four league
contests, does have a big front line with Ron
Riley (6-9) and Joe Mackey (6-6) flanking
Mike Westra (6-10). Seniors Riley and Mackey
are both quite talented, but Riley's
inconsistency, although lessened from last
year, is still apparent. And Westra playing
against Walton will probably be like Wilt
Chamberlain against the infamous Tom
Boerwinkle of Chicago.
USC may try to insert 6-10 Bill Taylor at
times to control Walton, but his lack of speed
could eventually only hurt the Trojans. In the
backcourt, Paul Westphal may be the best
guard in the Pac-8 as Cal coach Jim Padgett
claims (although a lot of people including
myself would give Claude Terry an equal
chance at that honor) but he and his running
mate Dana Anderson would have to perform
incredibly to power the Trojans past UCLA.
SC might put together a phenomenal game
and somehow beat the Bruins. Don't bet on it.
The Bruins look like they'll breeze through
Pac-8 play pretty easily. Young as they are,
they might have trouble in the NCAA
regionals, especially if they have to face
Brigham Young in a hostile Provo, Utah.
But you just have to think the Bruins will
probably overcome the obstacles in Utah and
return to the LA Sports Arena to try and win
their sixth straight NCAA crown in
mid-March. Bibby may be the only notable
returnee on the court, but on the Bruin bench
sits Wooden, the architect of the greatest
dynasty in college sports history. But Wooden
doesn't have much time to reflect on his
construction. His building program is still
going full speed ahead with no end in sight.
The Stanford and Cal basketball teams
went south last weekend to face USC and
UCLA and fortunately there was one
competitive game out of four. Through the
Los Angeles miracle of late-night tape delayed
TV rebroadcasts of USC and UCLA games, I
was able to attend both Stanford games and
still see most of Cal's two contests.
In watching the four teams in action, two
things impressed me the most. First of all,
Stanford's basketball fortunes are improving.
Despite a sub-par performance by 6-9 center
Mike Mann, who had played awesomely
against Washington a week ago, the Indians
were able to nearly upset the 10th ranked SC
Trojans on Saturday night.
And the Indians came close with a young
front line made up of sophomores Dave Frost,
Steve Shupe and Mann and junior Bob Buell.
Guard Claude Terry, who scored 42 points
last weekend, will be gone next season along
with the other current starting guard Bob
Nicholson, but it seems as if at least a few
players off this year's undefeated freshmen
team have the ability to be at least adequate
performers and probably much more as
varsity guards next season.
Most importantly, Stanford's first real "big
man" will move up to the varsity next season.
Seven-footer Rich Kelley has looked
unpolished at times this year, but his great
potential is indisputable. His presence will
allow the sharp-shooting Mann to move to a
more-natural forward spot and there will be
plenty of talented people to choose from for
the other forward position.

Up front the Bruins start two rangy, quick
jumping-jack forwards in Keith Wilkes (6-6)
and Larry Farmer (6-5). Both average in the
10-15 point range. They flank Bill Walton, a
6-11 red haired center who will be the next in
a long line of superstars to come out of
UCLA.
After Walton had demolished both
Stanford's and Cal's centers and teams, Coach
John Wooden said, "He's just amazing. He's
improving in every game. I really didn't think
he'd be this dominating so soon. But I knew
he had the ability to dominate like he is.
"I think Bill is as good a shot blocker as
any college shot blocker I've seen with the
exception of Bill Russell. He blocks the shots
so cleanly. He doesn't swat it out of bounds.
He always seems to keep control of it."
Wooden characterized well this phenomenal
19 year old who scored 52 points and
garnered 36 rebounds while playing less than
two complete games last weekend.
Behind the front line at the guard positions
are Bibby, who is doing more shooting than
he had as the Bruin's "quarterback" last year
and who is averaging just under 20 points, and
Greg Lee, a solid, sophomore performer.
Strong Reserves
The Bruins' second-stringers could probably

beat most teams by themselves. Walton calls
6-11 reserve center Swen Nater, "the best
center I've faced all year." Forwards Larry
Hollyfield and Vince Carson can both be quite
impressive and if Hollyfield could curb a very
quick temper, he might be an even greater
asset. Reserve guards Tommy Curtis and Andy
Hill continue the pattern of solid performers
and so the beat goes on.
USC, who is also undefeated in four league
contests, does have a big front line with Ron
Riley (6-9) and Joe Mackey (6-6) flanking
Mike Westra (6-10). Seniors Riley and Mackey
are both quite talented, but Riley's
inconsistency, although lessened from last
year, is still apparent. And Westra playing
against Walton will probably be like Wilt
Chamberlain against the infamous Tom
Boerwinkle of Chicago.
USC may try to insert 6-10 Bill Taylor at
times to control Walton, but his lack of speed
could eventually only hurt the Trojans. In the
backcourt, Paul Westphal may be the best
guard in the Pac-8 as Cal coach Jim Padgett
claims (although a lot of people including
myself would give Claude Terry an equal
chance at that honor) but he and his running
mate Dana Anderson would have to perform
incredibly to power the Trojans past UCLA.
SC might put together a phenomenal game
and somehow beat the Bruins. Don't bet on it.
The Bruins look like they'll breeze through
Pac-8 play pretty easily. Young as they are,
they might have trouble in the NCAA
regionals, especially if they have to face
Brigham Young in a hostile Provo, Utah.
But you just have to think the Bruins will
probably overcome the obstacles in Utah and
return to the LA Sports Arena to try and win
their sixth straight NCAA crown in
mid-March. Bibby may be the only notable
returnee on the court, but on the Bruin bench
sits Wooden, the architect of the greatest
dynasty in college sports history. But Wooden
doesn't have much time to reflect on his
construction. His building program is still
going full speed ahead with no end in sight.
The Stanford and Cal basketball teams
went south last weekend to face USC and
UCLA and fortunately there was one
competitive game out of four. Through the
Los Angeles miracle of late-night tape delayed
TV rebroadcasts of USC and UCLA games, I
was able to attend both Stanford games and
still see most of Cal's two contests.
In watching the four teams in action, two
things impressed me the most. First of all,
Stanford's basketball fortunes are improving.
Despite a sub-par performance by 6-9 center
Mike Mann, who had played awesomely
against Washington a week ago, the Indians
were able to nearly upset the 10th ranked SC
Trojans on Saturday night.
And the Indians came close with a young
front line made up of sophomores Dave Frost,
Steve Shupe and Mann and junior Bob Buell.
Guard Claude Terry, who scored 42 points
last weekend, will be gone next season along
with the other current starting guard Bob
Nicholson, but it seems as if at least a few
players off this year's undefeated freshmen
team have the ability to be at least adequate
performers and probably much more as
varsity guards next season.
Most importantly, Stanford's first real "big
man" will move up to the varsity next season.
Seven-footer Rich Kelley has looked
unpolished at times this year, but his great
potential is indisputable. His presence will
allow the sharp-shooting Mann to move to a
more-natural forward spot and there will be
plenty of talented people to choose from for
the other forward position.
Brighter Future
If a couple of freshmen can mature quickly
at guard, things could be much brighter for
Stanford basketball next season. With their
present personnel however, the Cards have
been playing well in the last few weeks and
they will undoubtedly finish with a much
better record than their 6-20 of a year ago.
It may seem to be a bit early to be
discussing next year's basketball picture, but
six other Pac-8 schools in addition to Stanford
might as well start looking ahead. The second

impression coming out of last weekend is even
more clear and immediately apparent than
Stanford's improving basketball program.
UCLA is definitely once again the class of the
Pacific-8 and very possibly the country.
I have now seen UCLA in five of their 12
victories this season and on the basis of seeing
USC twice last weekend, I would say that
their chances of beating the Bruins are not as
good as many observers have been claiming.
But isn't this the UCLA team that lost
Rowe, Wicks, Patterson and Booker. Yes it is.
But it's also the one which will soon make
Walton, Lee, Wilkes and Farmer as
well-known as the one remaining starter from
last year's NCAA Championship, guard Henry
Bibby.
