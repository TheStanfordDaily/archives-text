# Wrestlers Lose Twice
## 
### STAN WILSON 
Stanford's young wrestling
team dropped a pair of matches
over the weekend, falling to New
Mexico 25 to 13 Friday night, and
losing 24 to 12 Saturday at the
hands of a good UCLA team.
Stanford's Ken Krebs (134),
Chris Horpel (150), and Mark
Feinstein (190), all posted wins
against New Mexico. Horpel, one
of the premiere wrestlers in the
country, continued his winning
ways, pinning new Mexico's
Aundre West with 1:56 elapsed in
the first period.
Horpel Loses First
In Saturday's match with the
Bruins, Horpel lost his first
contest of the year to UCLA's
John Zenith, by a 3-0 score. Dave
Kopolow, Stanford's promising
118 pound wrestler, started off
the match with an 11 to 8
decision and a 3 to 0 lead for the
Indians, but they were unable to
stay in front. Mark Davis (177)
won by decision to make the
score Stanford 6, UCLA 18. In
the heavyweight division, Mark

Feinstein of Stanford won by
forfeit to narrow the score to
18-12. In a desperate attempt to
even the score, Stanford's Jim
Cole was pinned by Jim Bishop of
UCLA, and the Indians lost 24 to
12.
According to coach Joe DeMeo,
the team has been slowed this
year by several key injuries. The
team is young, comprised of two
juniors, and the rest freshmen and
sophomores. Coach DeMeo sees
national potential in David
Kopolow, Chris Horpel; and Ken
Krebs. Kopolow, a junior with
sophomore eligibility, is coming
off an injury from last year, and
has been wrestling well.
3rd In AAU's
Horpel, a co-captain this year,
finished third in the 1971
National AAU wrestling
championships in the 150 pound
class, and could be a possible
national champion this year.
The next contest for the
Indians is Friday, January 21
against Santa Barbara, at UCSB.
