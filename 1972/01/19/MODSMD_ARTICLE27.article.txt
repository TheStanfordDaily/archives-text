# Pucksters Beat Bears At Winter Carnival, 9-3
## 
### 
After a disheartening loss to Belmont, the Stanford Ice Hockey
team rolled over Cal last Saturday night at Squaw Valley.
In their usual close, discouraging, and frustrating loss to Belmont,
Stanford again demonstrated their lack of scoring ability in the big
games. The Cards led 1-0 as Tom Bedford took a pass from Roger
Macy on a two-on-one and beat the Belmont netminder.
The Cards' goalie, Gervin Peters, played an outstanding game and
was not beaten until the second period when Belmont converted on a
power play. Stanford fell behind, 2-1 as Belmont took advantage of a
three-on-two break as the Stanford forwards were all caught up ice on
the play.
With a little more than two minutes to play in the game Russ
MacAusland tied up the game, however, scoring on his own rebound.
But Belmont broke the backs of the Indians as they scored only thirty
seconds later when one of their forwards picked up an errant clearing
pass. Stanford tried to come back but time ran out.
On Saturday night of the Winter Carnival weekend, Stanford faced
Cal at Squaw Valley. Although they were outhit, the Indians
outplayed the Bears in every other aspect of the game on their way to
a 9-3 victory.
The Cards started out quickly as they scored three goals in the first
six minutes of the game. Junior Roger Macy put home the rebound
from defenseman Chris Counihan's shot for the first score. Eddie
Leonard scored the first of his three goals on a scramble in front of
the net and Stanford had already established its dominance over Cal.
The Indians' third goal was tallied by Tom Perrot as he was sent
away on a breakaway by Pat Baldwin. Stanford continued to put
pressure on the Bears. In the second period, Leonard and Macy each
scored again for the Cards. However, Cal also got on the scoreboard,
beating Indian goaltender Rick Bragdon twice on shots from close in.
Though being physically beaten by their opponents, Stanford
refused to be intimidated and scored four more times in the third
period. Leonard scored his third goal of the evening while Counihan,
Rich Jaros, and Tom Bedford added goals also.
On Friday night the team travels to Fresno to face Air Force at the
Fresno Ice Arena. The Cadets will be by far the toughest collegp
opponent the Cards have yet to face. Stanford's showing in this and
their other two encounters against the Cadets in Colorado Springs
later on in the quarter will help the Indians correctly evaluate their
national standing.
