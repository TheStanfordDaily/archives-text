Military Cargo Stopped
SAN FRANCISCO — West Coast shipping companies said
yesterday they would stop handling Pacific ports where
about 75 percent of Southeast Asia-bound military cargo
originates.
The Pacific Maritime Association said its members
would refuse after this week to provide vessels for Defense
Department cargoes, for which the striking longshore
union had agreed to provide crews.
Capt. Robert Friedman, chief operations officer for the
Military Sea Lift Command in Oakland, said the Navy was
seeking alternate ways to move cargo to Pacific and
Southeast Asia installations.
Cargo might be put on government-chartered ships or
on freighters removed from mothballs, he said, but he
added that no decisions had been reached.
Water Plot Uncovered
CHICAGO — Two college students were charged
yesterday with conspiracy to commit murder in what
Cook County State's Atty. Edward V. Hanrahan said was
a plot to poison water supplies in the Midwest with
typhoid and other deadly bacteria.
The aim of the alleged plot, Hanrahan said, was to build
a master race among the survivors of the poisoning who
would have undergone treatments to make them immune.
City authorities said the alleged scheme was uncovered
before any overt action was taken and that water supplies
were safe. They said the scheme would have been virtually
impossible to carry out.
The two defendants, Steve Pera, 18, of suburban
Evanston who formerly worked in a hospital laboratory,
and Allen Schwander, 19, of Chicago, were arrested
Monday in Schwander's North Side apartment.
Hanrahan said in a statement that a week-long
investigation disclosed that Pera and Schwander had
formed an organization called "RISE" which had
allegedly "planned poisoning water supplies and spreading
deadly diseases in Illinois and elsewhere."
"Members of RISE," Hanrahan said, "were allegedly to
be inoculated and immunized, enabling them to survive
the poisonings and diseases to form the basis of a new
master race. Water filtration plants in the Midwest were
allegedly to be infected with typhoid and other deadly
bacteria."
More My Lai Victims
NEW YORK — The U.S. Army has testimony that twice
as many Vietnamese men, women and children were killed
by U.S. troops at My Lai than it has so far publicly
acknowledged, according to Seymour Hersh, the reporter
who first broke the massacre story.
Secret testimony that a second massacre took place at a
nearby hamlet on the same day has been ignored by Army
authorities, Hersh charges in an article in the current issue
of the New Yorker magazine.
Quoting from what he says is a complete transcript of
testimony given to the Army commission set up under Lt.
Gen. William R. Peers to investigate the My Lai incident,
Hersh says Army investigators concluded that 347

civilians had been slain at My Lai on March 16, 1968," a
total twice as large as had been publicly acknowledged."
The Peers Commission transcript has not been publicly
released by the Defense Department, but Hersh claims he
obtained a complete record of the testimony. It reveals,
he said, that the platoon headed by Lt. William L. Calley
Jr. was responsible for 90 to 130 murders at My Lai. A
second platoon apparently murdered as many as 100
civilians, Hersh writes, with the rest of the deaths
attributable to a third platoon and helicopter gunships.
Soviet Ships Seized
JUNEAU, Alaska — Balky crews aboard two Soviet fishing
vessels seized for illegal entry into U.S. waters were
resisting escort to a U.S. Navy base in the Aleutians, the
Coast Guard said yesterday.
One of the two ships earlier had tried to escape but was
recaptured yesterday following a four-hour chase through
the Bering Sea ice pack. That chase nearly ended in
gunfire.
The Coast Guard icebreaker Storis, outnumbered 80 to
1 by the Soviet fishing vessels, had armed boarding parties
on both vessels and two Russians were reported under
arrest aboard the Storis.
Officials said there was no reports of violence.
A spokesman said the Storis, attempting to escort the
two ships 600 miles south to Adak Island, failed to get
under way partially due to the uncooperative Soviet crew.
"It's quite simple for them to say 'no, we're not going
and just sit there," the Coast Guard spokesman said.
The 362-foot Lamut, a processing ship, and the
sidetrawler Kolyvan are charged with conducting illegal
fishery support activity within the U.S. 12-mile limit near
uninhabited St. Matthew Island some 200 miles off the
western Alaskan coast.
Officials said communications with the Storis were
spotty but declined to disclose other details of the ship's
situation.
The Lamut, flagship of the 80-vessel Soviet fleet, fled
with an armed Coast Guard party aboard after it was
seized Monday night. The Storis "came about as close as
you can get" to firing a warning shot at the Lamut during
a four-hour zig-zag chase through foot-thick ice, the Coast
Guard said.
One Coast Guard official said if the two ships could not
be persuaded to head for Adak under their own power,
alternatives would be either to tow them to port or release
the vessels but detain their masters to face charges.
Armed Coast Guardsmen were stationed aboard the
two vessels, but a spokesman said the boarding parties
were not capable of operating the vessels, and the Russian
seamen were "dragging their feet."
The Coast Guard said two Russian fishing officials—the
master of one of the vessels and the fisheries director of
the Soviet fleet—had been arrested and were being held on
the Storis.
Spokesmen said the Storis' 77-man crew is
"considerably outnumbered" by the Soviet seamen,
fishermen and processing crews. But no violence or
harassment was reported.
A Coast Guard cutter from Kodiak, the Balsam, was
scheduled to reach the scene today to assist the Storis.
The three vessels were reported to be sitting about 20
miles from St. Matthews Island Tuesday afternoon.
