Lots of Stanford students take up
various hobbies to offset the tedious
nature of everyday student life. Things
like knitting, painting revolutionary
slogans on the sides of buildings, and
getting stoned are pretty common
endeavors for sizable groups in the
student body. But Jacques Littlefield,
a Stanford graduate student in
Business, has a very unique hobby. He
builds self-propelled models of Army
tanks in his garage.
Tank building isn't the kind of
hobby that can be started in a dorm
room with a pair of pliers and a
screwdriver. Littlefield's tanks are
essentially hand-tooled on lathes and
other power tools and are built in
either one-fourth or one-fifth scale
meaning they are about six feet long
and three feet high.
It takes a certain dedication to
build model tanks too, since one
machine requires at least a year's work
and in the case of Littlefield's latest
effort, nearly two years of calculations
and work in a machine shop. What's
more, Littlefield spent $1200 on his
first model plus more than 600 hours
putting the machine together.
Like many other bored junior high
school boys, Jacques first got
interested in model building in the
sixth and seventh grades. "I spent
nearly all my time in the sixth, seventh
and eighth grades building model
airplanes, tanks and ships," he
remembers, "and I think I probably
built hundreds of models them."
In a basement room of his parents'
Burlingame house, Jacques still has a
few dozen models from those junior
high days and it was from this
collection that he got the model for

his first mechanical tank two years
ago. The first tank he built was the
Russian T-34/85, a revolutionary tank
introduced in World War 11.
"I've always been interested in
model building," Jacques says
explaining how he got into building
tanks in the first place, "and I decided
it would be a challenging hobby to try
to build an actual working model of
some machine."
"I wanted to build a scale model of
something that had a lot of working
parts and so I chose tanks. I like to
think that I build tanks for the
engineering involved, not out of some
love for the military. Also it's better to
build a land model and not have to run
the risk of something going wrong and
having the model either crash or sink."
The Russian tank Littlefield built
was done without the help of any
blueprints, but instead built from a
ten-inch plastic model that Jacques
put together in junior high. "The
T-34/85 isn't built exactly to scale and
all the details aren't right," the tank
builder explains, "because it was very
difficult to get all the right
specifications off the plastic Aurora
model."
As far as the actual performance of
the model goes however, it performs
all the tasks that its full-size brother
can do. Besides having two speeds
forward and two speeds backward the
tank fires pellets from the cannon,
fires smaller projectiles from two
machine guns, and shoots flames 15
feet from a gasoline flame thrower.
It takes two people to operate the
model tank which conceivably can be
run by remote control up to a mile
away. The radio control device in the
tank cost around $900. The actual

power source for the treads come from
two six volt and a twelve volt battery
system.
The "commissioning" of the
Russian tank came last fall in
Burlingame, and Littlefield admits
there were a few bugs in the machine.
The biggest problem came when cars
drove by the backyard where the tank
was being tested and somehow the
ignitions from the automobiles sent
the tank into a fit of crazy turning and
erratic firing.
"We burned up a couple of bushes
that day before we figured out what
was going on," Littlefield
remembers, " but once we got the
remote control system working we had
a very appropriate christening. We got
a toy dinosaur, painted it U.S. Army
drab green and then ignited it with the
flame thrower."
The tank Littlefield and an old
friend from high school, Gary Owens,
are working on now will be an even
more amazing machine than the first
effort. The model American M-60/AL,
the tank currently being used in
Vietnam, will be completed in about a
year and is highly detailed.
Built from actual blueprints from
the Detroit Tank Arsonal, the new
tank will have two revolving turrets,
lights, a powerful engine that will take
it to speeds of six mile per hour and
allow the machine to climb over 4 x
4's without slowing down.
Although Jacques says there is
information on tanks "everywhere
from the Hoover Institution to the
corner toy shop," as far as he knows
there are no other model tank builders
in the country who build tanks to the
scale that he does.
After he completes the latest tank,
Littlefield has no definite plans for
future models. "I've got ideas of
putting a remote control television
camera into a tank, and building it to
specifications that are exact down to
the number of rivets in the wheels."
It makes those models of the '57
Chevys look pretty shabby doesn't it?
