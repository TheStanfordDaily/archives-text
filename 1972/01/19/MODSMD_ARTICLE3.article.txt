# Varied Factors Affect Use Of Stanford Lands
## 
### ROBERT BACON First in a series 
Stanford students "will not forget
the fine waves of our two mountain
ranges, overarched by a soft blue
Grecian sky, nor the ancient oak trees,
nor the gently sloping fields, changing
from vivid green to richest yellow, as
the seasons change."
With those words Stanford's first
president, David Starr Jordan,
described the University's 8800+ acre
land endowment on the institution's
opening day, October 1, 1891.
But three decades later, the pioneer
president wrote of Stanford's vast land
holdings from another viewpoint.
They "will ultimately have large value
for residence purposes, as with the
growth of San Francisco the demand
for suburban homes will greatly
increase," he noted in his
autobiography, Days of a Man.
After another thirty years had
passed, in 1951, Stanford leased a
small parcel of land to Varian
Associates, hereby beginning what was
destined to become the Stanford
Industrial Park.
And now, in 1972, the question of
what to do with Stanford lands is
fraught with controversy and
intertwined with issues of national
economic priorities, ecology and
conservation, and lack of low-income
housing in the area.
Stanford land extends about five
miles west and more than three miles
south from the Quad, and fronts along
El Camino Real for two and one half
miles.
The "inner campus," including the
Arboretum and the athletic fields,
accounts for about 1125 acres, only
one-eighth of the land.
An equivalent amount of land has
been allotted for development,
including the Industrial Park,
Shopping Center, Professional Park
(located near the Medical Center), Oak
Creek Apartments (on Willow Road),
and several smaller parcels.
The Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center and the Jasper Ridge Biological
Preserve, research facilities in the
foothills, occupy another one-eighth.
Faculty and staff housing covers 450
acres, while 665 acres have been
condemned for public use, much of it
for the Junipero Serra Freeway.
Portion Untouched
The remainder of the land, about
4,500 acres, is in nearly the same
condition as when Dr. Jordan
described it 80 years ago.
Once upon a time, there was
no one but Indians here, and they
didn't stake out boundaries and count
acres, nor build universities, industrial
parks, or shopping centers.
The Spanish were nextrand then
the Mexicans. The latter split up
California into large land grants for
various people who found favor with
their government.
About the time of the Civil War,
Leland Stanford bought one of those
parcels, the Rancho San Francisquito,
renamed it the Palo Alto Stock Farm,
and raised trotting horses on it.
When the Stanfords established
Stanford University in the late 1880's,
they gave the new institution,
perpetual title to the entire tract as
part of its endowment.
Except for the central campus, the
land remained virtually untouched for
the first 80 years of the institution.
But rising property tax rates made
the land a financial liability to the

University. Agricultural leases did not
bring sufficient income to pay the
taxes. Furthermore, the University
doubled its enrollment between 1945
and 1950, and was in need of
additional income.
Leasing of land for development
would provide income not only to pay
taxes, but to support educational
programs as well.

The city of Palo Alto would receive
a financial shot in the arm, in taxes
and general growth, from the
development of Stanford land.
Master Plan
So Stanford entered the land
development business. 1951 saw the
beginning of the Industrial Park, the
Shopping Center, and the Professional
Park.
In 1953, a Master Plan for
development of Stanford land was
unveiled by the firm of Skidmore,
Owings, and Merrill. It set aside 2,500
acres for academic uses and 6,000
acres for single-family residences.
University Land Resources Manager
Boyd Smith recently pointed out that
single-family residences on one quarter
to half-acre lots were common in
1952. "Nobody would zone for
apartments; there weren't any in the
area. People thought they were
scummy."
The Board of Trustees accepted the
1953 plan, and construction began on
the Stanford Hills Subdivision off
Sand Hill Road above Junipero Serra
Boulevard.
Planners soon realized that they
had not adequately provided for the
future academic needs of the
University. The short-lived plan which,
according to a special presidential
committee, regarded Stanford "as a
vast potential subdivision which
incidentally has a university occupying
some of its area," was dropped.
Meanwhile, industrial, commercial,
and professional leasing on the fringes
of Stanford land continued. In 1960
the University's net land development
income topped $1 million for the first
time. It now is close to $2 million.
During the 1950'5, the Jasper Ridge
area and a sizeable swath on both sides
of Junipero Serra Boulevard were
placed in the academic reserve.
Officials were thankful that the
foothills were not covered with private
homes when Stanford had the

opportunity in the late 1950's to bid
for the Atomic Energy Commission's
giant linear electron acceleratoi
project. Stanford won the right to
construct SLAC offering the AEC a
rent-free lease and the facility,
covering 480 acres, was opened in
1966.
In recent years, ecological concerns
have motivated many Midpeninsula
residents to seek to preserve the
foothills in their natural state. This has
produced hostility to Stanford's
development plans, specifically the
Coyote Hill industrial project.
Anti-military sentiment has been
vented against the Stanford Industrial
Park, which includes defense
contractors. Some critics have stressed
the imbalance between jobs and
housing units on Stanford land.
A comprehensive review of
University land policy was desired, and
in 1970 Livingston and Blayney, a San
Francisco-based regional planning
firm, was commissioned to undertake
such a study.
The firm sought the advice of
university faculty-student committees
as well as of Stanford development
officials. Its findings, in the form of a
"policy plan" were unveiled in
January 1971.
They proposed additions to the
academic reserve, the industrial lands,
and the lands dedicated to housing.
The report is currently under
evaluation by Stanford officials and is
being circulated to neighboring cities
and the Stanford community. The
faculty-student Committee on Land
and Building Development held
hearings last spring on the plan.
