# Varied Factors Affect Use Of Stanford Lands
## 
### ROBERT BACON First in a series 
Stanford students "will not forget
the fine waves of our two mountain
ranges, overarched by a soft blue
Grecian sky, nor the ancient oak trees,
nor the gently sloping fields, changing
from vivid green to richest yellow, as
the seasons change."
With those words Stanford's first
president, David Starr Jordan,
described the University's 8800+ acre
land endowment on the institution's
opening day, October 1, 1891.
But three decades later, the pioneer
president wrote of Stanford's vast land
holdings from another viewpoint.
They "will ultimately have large value
for residence purposes, as with the
growth of San Francisco the demand
for suburban homes will greatly
increase," he noted in his
autobiography, Days of a Man.
After another thirty years had
passed, in 1951, Stanford leased a
small parcel of land to Varian
Associates, hereby beginning what was
destined to become the Stanford
Industrial Park.
And now, in 1972, the question of
what to do with Stanford lands is
fraught with controversy and
intertwined with issues of national
economic priorities, ecology and
conservation, and lack of low-income
housing in the area.
Stanford land extends about five
miles west and more than three miles
south from the Quad, and fronts along
El Camino Real for two and one half
miles.
The "inner campus," including the
Arboretum and the athletic fields,
accounts for about 1125 acres, only
one-eighth of the land.
An equivalent amount of land has
been allotted for development,
including the Industrial Park,
Shopping Center, Professional Park
(located near the Medical Center), Oak
Creek Apartments (on Willow Road),
and several smaller parcels.
The Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center and the Jasper Ridge Biological
Preserve, research facilities in the
foothills, occupy another one-eighth.
Faculty and staff housing covers 450
acres, while 665 acres have been
condemned for public use, much of it
for the Junipero Serra Freeway.
Portion Untouched
The remainder of the land, about
4,500 acres, is in nearly the same
condition as when Dr. Jordan
described it 80 years ago.
Once upon a time, there was
no one but Indians here, and they
didn't stake out boundaries and count
acres, nor build universities, industrial
parks, or shopping centers.
The Spanish were nextrand then
the Mexicans. The latter split up
California into large land grants for
various people who found favor with
their government.
About the time of the Civil War,
Leland Stanford bought one of those
parcels, the Rancho San Francisquito,
renamed it the Palo Alto Stock Farm,
and raised trotting horses on it.
When the Stanfords established
Stanford University in the late 1880's,
they gave the new institution,
perpetual title to the entire tract as
part of its endowment.
Except for the central campus, the
land remained virtually untouched for
the first 80 years of the institution.
But rising property tax rates made
the land a financial liability to the

University. Agricultural leases did not
bring sufficient income to pay the
taxes. Furthermore, the University
doubled its enrollment between 1945
and 1950, and was in need of
additional income.
Leasing of land for development
would provide income not only to pay
taxes, but to support educational
programs as well.

The city of Palo Alto would receive
a financial shot in the arm, in taxes
and general growth, from the
development of Stanford land.
Master Plan
So Stanford entered the land
development business. 1951 saw the
beginning of the Industrial Park, the
Shopping Center, and the Professional
