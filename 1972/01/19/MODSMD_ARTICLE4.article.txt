# Group Disrupts Shockley Class, Criticizes Controversial Research
## 
### THERESA RAMIREZ JIM WASCHER 
Sixteen people who described
themselves as members of the Third
World Liberation Front and members
of the community yesterday disrupted
the 11:00 a.m. class of William
Shockley. Poniatoff Professor at the
Stanford Electronics Laboratories.
Shockley, who is both widely
known and highly criticized for his
genetic theories on race and IQ, has
recently proposed a government-given
bonus for those genetically inferior
Americans who will volunteer to be
sterilized.
Demonstrators entered his
Electrical Engineering class and one
member of the group, a black
community worker, read a prepared
statement attacking Shockley and his
theories as racist and oppressive.
Shockley told the demonstrators
they were "interfering with a quiz and
the educational activities going on
here." He then asked everyone not
registered in the class to leave.
No one, including the six members
of the class, left, whereupon Shockley
and several of the demonstrators
engaged in an argument about his
theories. One protester accused him of
"advocating genocide of black
people." Shockley said "all we're
advocating here is quantum
mechanics," and again asked that the
protesters leave.
Pictures Taken
Early in the disturbance Shockley
began taking Polaroid pictures of the
demonstration with a camera he had
on hand. He took three pictures and
handed them to Troy Barbee, Lab
Director for Research Sciences and the
Center for Material Research, who was
also present, for what Shockley
termed "safe keeping."
A near fight broke out when one
demonstrator walked by and took the
pictures out of Barbee's hand and then
proceeded to hand them to a fellow
protester in the back of the class.
Barbee, visibly angered, followed the

protester and tried to retrieve
the pictures.
Unsuccessful in his attempts,
Barbee then grabbed the protester by
the shirt and pushed him into a group
sitting in the back row of the room.
Nearby demonstrators began to yell at
Barbee and he gave up on getting
Shockley's pictures back.
A loud discussion was held as
participants in the demonstration
asked Shockley if he would agree to
debate with their spokesman if he
received a formal invitation from a
representative of the Faculty Political
Action Group.
After much argument Shockley said
he would agree to debate only under
the condition that only two or three

other persons would be on the
platform at the same time, v
The demonstration broke up at
11:40 when Nick Bruno, Stanford
Police photographer, arrived on the
scene. Stanford Police Chief Marvin
Herrington arrived soon after the
demonstrators had left and took a
report from Shockley that the
demonstrators had exposed his film
and had taken two of his cassette tape
recordings. He said he had not
recognized any of the demonstrators,
but would probably be able to if he
saw them again.
No Charges Filed
John Schwartz, Special Assistant to
the President, said he had not yet
received sufficient information about
the disruption to file any charges.

report from Shockley that the
demonstrators had exposed his film
and had taken two of his cassette tape
recordings. He said he had not
recognized any of the demonstrators,
but would probably be able to if he
saw them again.
No Charges Filed
John Schwartz, Special Assistant to
the President, said he had not yet
received sufficient information about
the disruption to file any charges.
Sixteen people who described
themselves as members of the Third
World Liberation Front and members
of the community yesterday disrupted
the 11:00 a.m. class of William
Shockley. Poniatoff Professor at the
Stanford Electronics Laboratories.
Shockley, who is both widely
known and highly criticized for his
genetic theories on race and IQ, has
recently proposed a government-given
bonus for those genetically inferior
Americans who will volunteer to be
sterilized.
Demonstrators entered his
Electrical Engineering class and one
member of the group, a black
community worker, read a prepared
statement attacking Shockley and his
theories as racist and oppressive.
Shockley told the demonstrators
they were "interfering with a quiz and
the educational activities going on
here." He then asked everyone not
registered in the class to leave.
No one, including the six members
of the class, left, whereupon Shockley
and several of the demonstrators
engaged in an argument about his
theories. One protester accused him of
"advocating genocide of black
people." Shockley said "all we're
advocating here is quantum
mechanics," and again asked that the
protesters leave.
Pictures Taken
Early in the disturbance Shockley
began taking Polaroid pictures of the
demonstration with a camera he had
on hand. He took three pictures and
handed them to Troy Barbee, Lab
Director for Research Sciences and the
Center for Material Research, who was
also present, for what Shockley
termed "safe keeping."
A near fight broke out when one
demonstrator walked by and took the
pictures out of Barbee's hand and then
proceeded to hand them to a fellow
protester in the back of the class.
Barbee, visibly angered, followed the

protester and tried to retrieve
the pictures.
Unsuccessful in his attempts,
Barbee then grabbed the protester by
the shirt and pushed him into a group
sitting in the back row of the room.
Nearby demonstrators began to yell at
Barbee and he gave up on getting
Shockley's pictures back.
A loud discussion was held as
participants in the demonstration
asked Shockley if he would agree to
debate with their spokesman if he
received a formal invitation from a
representative of the Faculty Political
Action Group.
After much argument Shockley said
he would agree to debate only under
the condition that only two or three

other persons would be on the
platform at the same time, v
The demonstration broke up at
11:40 when Nick Bruno, Stanford
Police photographer, arrived on the
scene. Stanford Police Chief Marvin
Herrington arrived soon after the
demonstrators had left and took a
report from Shockley that the
demonstrators had exposed his film
and had taken two of his cassette tape
recordings. He said he had not
recognized any of the demonstrators,
but would probably be able to if he
saw them again.
