## Marriage Poses Special Problems 
### JANE BUSSEY 
Loneliness might not be a problem
for married students here, but the
number who seek professional
counselling at Cowell Student Health
Center shows that going to school does
not eliminate their marital difficulties.
One of the chief stresses, according
to Cowell psychologist, Dr. Varda
Ganz, is that "Stanford graduate
schools present a fantastic amount of
work."
Or a student returning with a wife
and children from a more affluent
existence outside may find university
life means such trivial problems as,
"the children make too much noise,"
says Ganz.
Older couples experience greater
adjustment problems than young
graduate students who have "been in
school continuously," added Dr. Ganz.
"These people come in with
problems of early marriage, 'roomate
problems' we call them." Students
living in small apartments may become

irritated at little daily habits like
leaving the cap off the toothpaste
twice, but these problems "can be
worked out very well."
"And when both go to school
there's the problem of competing
priorities," said Dr. Ganz, adding that
foreign couples often come fcr
counseling because of the total change
of culture. In addition, a foreign
student sometimes does not bring his
wife and family for financial reasons.
"Stanford is a cultural shock, and
everyone experiences it when they
come here," she said. But a married
student who concentrates on
schoolwork and the new department
associates, may overlook the spouse.
"Wives resent it because they (the
husbands) don't pay much attention
to them," said Dr. Ganz, and added
that "in some cases the wife is helpful,
but in another way, she is out of it,
she represents the old hometown and
school."
When the couple seeks evaluation
and treatment, the counselors "make
sure they understand their position is
caused because they are in school."
Cowell offers a Monday afternoon
married student clinic for evaluation
and short term treatment. In addition,
Dr. Ganz and Dr. Warren Miller, a
Medical School psychiatrist, discuss
marriage problems with couples in a
Tuesday night group.
Couple counseling has grown out of
"the increasing awareness in
psychology in the last 10 years that a
lot of problems are not individual
problems, but deal with groups and
families."
Stanford married students "have
the usual problems of life," Dr. Ganz

commented. "Sexual problems are
very high on the list. Often when they
complain of a lack of communication
it turns out that they can't
communicate in bed."
Cowell does not treat long term
disturbances, "but it is possible to

solve the problems of Stanford, of the
community here," said Dr. Ganz.
She sees "a fairly large number,"
about 19 new couples a quarter, and
these students have good chances of
solving their conflicts" because of the
