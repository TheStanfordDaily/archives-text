# Decision-Making
## Suggestions For Change 
### Sanford M. Dornbusch 
When the Daily requested a
piece about decision-making at
Stanford, lasked,
"Decision-making about what?"
One way to respond to their
vague mandate is to list some
suggestions for improving
Stanford and examine the
decision-making machinery for
each suggestion.
Immersion Courses. This idea,
put forward by Dick Scott of the
Sociology Department, tries to
help undergraduates to take
advantage of being at a
research-oriented University
rather than at a liberal arts
college. Students would take a
single immersion course for 15
credits. Devoting their full
academic energies to it, they
could move from elementary to
advanced study and research.
Working with two faculty, the
students would be participants
rather than spectators.
This suggestion has been
approved by the Sociology
Department for 1972-73. The
place for implementing the idea
and the decision-making unit are
both a single department. The
innovation can thus be considered
and decided without much fuss.
Lifelong Education. Let's turn
to decisions that don't seem to get
made. I keep suggesting a new
approach to education which
inspires lots of enthusiasm and no
action. I don't believe the inaction
comes from the idea being punk,
but rather from the idea being too
big. The proposal is to admit
students to Stanford for life, able
to come back for further
education when they need new
skills, get rid of their last child, or
develop new interests. Right now
we often waste education on
young people who are in reluctant
confinement, eager to break out
of the academic lockstep but
afraid to leave. Stanford, like
other institutions, has lost its
sense of mission and is continuing
to teach young adults because
that's what it has always done.
Lifelong education, even begun on
a small scale, entails enormous

costs and opportunities, and a
completely new relationship to
our students. But Stanford has no
long-range planning unit, and the
President and Provost are often
too busy putting out today's fires
to have time for 1980's problems.
Staff Regeneration. A friend of
mine, Bob Moulton of SLAC,
keeps coming up with suggestions
to renew the thousands of
University staff who are
vegetating, getting stodgy, or plain
fed up. Staff members want and
need a chance to explore
alternatives. For example, Bob
suggests leaves of absence without
pay for as long as two years, with
the guarantee that the same job is
waiting. Some work groups are big
enough to cover for their
colleagues on leave, while others
could hire replacements who
would understand their temporary
status. This idea would provide
some security for staff who want
to try new ventures, from jobs to
living on the land. It would cost
little and might even save money.
Bob also suggested courses for
staff, sabbaticals to up-grade
skills, and part-time registration
for degrees at Stanford. It
shouldn't be beyond a great
University's capacity to devise a
system of representation that
takes into account both level of
staff position and type of work
unit. The lack of a Staff Assembly
forces administrators to work in
the dark, unaware of staff wants
and needs.
Hoover Institution. There are
some excellent people at Hoover,
but there has been apparent
political bias in the selection of
researchers. Hoover's autonomony
over the last dozen years is
reflected in its appointments not
going through the regular review
procedures for faculty. Dick
Lyman, as Provost and as
President, has fought to get some
control over the hiring process.
The Board of Overseers of
Hoover, however, has been tough
opposition. The best tactic for
concerned students and faculty in
this specific situation is to support

President Lyman as he pushes the
Stanford Trustees to pressure the
Hoover Board to put Hoover
appointments under the regular
review procedures.
DoD Grants. For good and bad
reasons, large chunks of Stanford
have become dependent on DoD
support. Right now, the Dean of
Engineering says over half of his
research support comes from
DoD. I don't know how many
hundreds of students, faculty and
staff depend on that flow of
funds, but it's a large number. The
President and Congress have
talked a lot and done little about
transferring research funds from
DoD to NSF and other agencies.
We're still justifying support for
science in this country by citing
the bogey of the Communist
enemy. I don't believe Stanford
can or will take action against
DoD support on this campus
when that action will directly
injure so many people right here.
Stanford can lobby for shifts in
funding, along with the
Association of American
Universities, but that has proved
ineffective so far. Wishful and
improbable though it may seem,
the most likely way to change this
situation is to elect a President,
like McGovern, who will be less
likely to put the military at the
top of his priority list. Some
decisions just don't get made at
Stanford.
These five examples suggest
that there aren't any easy
formulas for changing this
University. The decision-making
for the immersion courses was
simple, while the other examples
suggest that we need a long-range
planning unit, a Staff Assembly,
student and faculty support for
our administrators in the
occasional moments when they
battle for truth and justice, and a
better President of the United
States.

improbable though it may seem,
the most likely way to change this
situation is to elect a President,
like McGovern, who will be less
likely to put the military at the
top of his priority list. Some
decisions just don't get made at
Stanford.
These five examples suggest
that there aren't any easy
formulas for changing this
University. The decision-making
for the immersion courses was
simple, while the other examples
suggest that we need a long-range
planning unit, a Staff Assembly,
student and faculty support for
our administrators in the
occasional moments when they
battle for truth and justice, and a
better President of the United
States.
Sanford M. Dornbusch is a
professor of sociology
When the Daily requested a
piece about decision-making at
Stanford, lasked,
"Decision-making about what?"
One way to respond to their
vague mandate is to list some
suggestions for improving
Stanford and examine the
decision-making machinery for
each suggestion.
Immersion Courses. This idea,
put forward by Dick Scott of the
Sociology Department, tries to
help undergraduates to take
advantage of being at a
research-oriented University
rather than at a liberal arts
college. Students would take a
single immersion course for 15
credits. Devoting their full
academic energies to it, they
could move from elementary to
advanced study and research.
Working with two faculty, the
students would be participants
rather than spectators.
This suggestion has been
approved by the Sociology
Department for 1972-73. The
place for implementing the idea
and the decision-making unit are
both a single department. The
innovation can thus be considered
and decided without much fuss.
Lifelong Education. Let's turn
to decisions that don't seem to get
made. I keep suggesting a new
approach to education which
inspires lots of enthusiasm and no
action. I don't believe the inaction
comes from the idea being punk,
but rather from the idea being too
big. The proposal is to admit
students to Stanford for life, able
to come back for further
education when they need new
skills, get rid of their last child, or
develop new interests. Right now
we often waste education on
young people who are in reluctant
confinement, eager to break out
of the academic lockstep but
afraid to leave. Stanford, like
other institutions, has lost its
sense of mission and is continuing
to teach young adults because
that's what it has always done.
Lifelong education, even begun on
a small scale, entails enormous

costs and opportunities, and a
completely new relationship to
our students. But Stanford has no
long-range planning unit, and the
President and Provost are often
too busy putting out today's fires
to have time for 1980's problems.
Staff Regeneration. A friend of
mine, Bob Moulton of SLAC,
keeps coming up with suggestions
to renew the thousands of
University staff who are
vegetating, getting stodgy, or plain
fed up. Staff members want and
need a chance to explore
alternatives. For example, Bob
suggests leaves of absence without
pay for as long as two years, with
the guarantee that the same job is
waiting. Some work groups are big
enough to cover for their
colleagues on leave, while others
could hire replacements who
would understand their temporary
status. This idea would provide
some security for staff who want
to try new ventures, from jobs to
living on the land. It would cost
little and might even save money.
Bob also suggested courses for
staff, sabbaticals to up-grade
skills, and part-time registration
for degrees at Stanford. It
shouldn't be beyond a great
University's capacity to devise a
system of representation that
takes into account both level of
staff position and type of work
unit. The lack of a Staff Assembly
forces administrators to work in
the dark, unaware of staff wants
and needs.
Hoover Institution. There are
some excellent people at Hoover,
but there has been apparent
political bias in the selection of
researchers. Hoover's autonomony
over the last dozen years is
reflected in its appointments not
going through the regular review
procedures for faculty. Dick
Lyman, as Provost and as
President, has fought to get some
control over the hiring process.
The Board of Overseers of
Hoover, however, has been tough
opposition. The best tactic for
concerned students and faculty in
this specific situation is to support

President Lyman as he pushes the
Stanford Trustees to pressure the
Hoover Board to put Hoover
appointments under the regular
review procedures.
DoD Grants. For good and bad
reasons, large chunks of Stanford
have become dependent on DoD
support. Right now, the Dean of
Engineering says over half of his
research support comes from
DoD. I don't know how many
hundreds of students, faculty and
staff depend on that flow of
funds, but it's a large number. The
President and Congress have
talked a lot and done little about
transferring research funds from
DoD to NSF and other agencies.
We're still justifying support for
science in this country by citing
the bogey of the Communist
enemy. I don't believe Stanford
can or will take action against
DoD support on this campus
when that action will directly
injure so many people right here.
Stanford can lobby for shifts in
funding, along with the
Association of American
Universities, but that has proved
ineffective so far. Wishful and
improbable though it may seem,
the most likely way to change this
situation is to elect a President,
like McGovern, who will be less
likely to put the military at the

DoD. I don't know how many
hundreds of students, faculty and
staff depend on that flow of
funds, but it's a large number. The
President and Congress have
talked a lot and done little about
transferring research funds from
DoD to NSF and other agencies.
We're still justifying support for
science in this country by citing
the bogey of the Communist
enemy. I don't believe Stanford
can or will take action against
DoD support on this campus
when that action will directly
injure so many people right here.
Stanford can lobby for shifts in
funding, along with the
Association of American
Universities, but that has proved
ineffective so far. Wishful and
improbable though it may seem,
the most likely way to change this
situation is to elect a President,
like McGovern, who will be less
likely to put the military at the
top of his priority list. Some
decisions just don't get made at
Stanford.
These five examples suggest
that there aren't any easy
formulas for changing this
University. The decision-making
for the immersion courses was
simple, while the other examples
suggest that we need a long-range
planning unit, a Staff Assembly,
student and faculty support for
our administrators in the
occasional moments when they
battle for truth and justice, and a
better President of the United
States.
Sanford M. Dornbusch is a
professor of sociology
When the Daily requested a
piece about decision-making at
Stanford, lasked,
"Decision-making about what?"
One way to respond to their
vague mandate is to list some
suggestions for improving
Stanford and examine the
decision-making machinery for
each suggestion.
Immersion Courses. This idea,
put forward by Dick Scott of the
Sociology Department, tries to
help undergraduates to take
advantage of being at a
research-oriented University
rather than at a liberal arts
college. Students would take a
single immersion course for 15
credits. Devoting their full
academic energies to it, they
could move from elementary to
advanced study and research.
Working with two faculty, the
students would be participants
rather than spectators.
This suggestion has been
approved by the Sociology
Department for 1972-73. The
place for implementing the idea
and the decision-making unit are
both a single department. The
innovation can thus be considered
and decided without much fuss.
Lifelong Education. Let's turn
to decisions that don't seem to get
made. I keep suggesting a new
approach to education which
inspires lots of enthusiasm and no
action. I don't believe the inaction
comes from the idea being punk,
but rather from the idea being too
big. The proposal is to admit
students to Stanford for life, able
to come back for further
education when they need new
skills, get rid of their last child, or
develop new interests. Right now
we often waste education on
young people who are in reluctant
confinement, eager to break out
of the academic lockstep but
afraid to leave. Stanford, like
other institutions, has lost its
sense of mission and is continuing
to teach young adults because
that's what it has always done.
Lifelong education, even begun on
a small scale, entails enormous

costs and opportunities, and a
completely new relationship to
our students. But Stanford has no
long-range planning unit, and the
President and Provost are often
too busy putting out today's fires
to have time for 1980's problems.
Staff Regeneration. A friend of
mine, Bob Moulton of SLAC,
keeps coming up with suggestions
to renew the thousands of
University staff who are
vegetating, getting stodgy, or plain
fed up. Staff members want and
need a chance to explore
alternatives. For example, Bob
suggests leaves of absence without
pay for as long as two years, with
the guarantee that the same job is
waiting. Some work groups are big
enough to cover for their
colleagues on leave, while others
could hire replacements who
would understand their temporary
status. This idea would provide
some security for staff who want
to try new ventures, from jobs to
living on the land. It would cost
little and might even save money.
Bob also suggested courses for
staff, sabbaticals to up-grade
skills, and part-time registration
for degrees at Stanford. It
shouldn't be beyond a great
University's capacity to devise a
system of representation that
takes into account both level of
staff position and type of work
unit. The lack of a Staff Assembly
forces administrators to work in
the dark, unaware of staff wants
and needs.
Hoover Institution. There are
some excellent people at Hoover,
but there has been apparent
political bias in the selection of
researchers. Hoover's autonomony
over the last dozen years is
reflected in its appointments not
going through the regular review
procedures for faculty. Dick
Lyman, as Provost and as
President, has fought to get some
control over the hiring process.
The Board of Overseers of
Hoover, however, has been tough
opposition. The best tactic for
concerned students and faculty in
this specific situation is to support

President Lyman as he pushes the
Stanford Trustees to pressure the
Hoover Board to put Hoover
appointments under the regular
review procedures.
DoD Grants. For good and bad
reasons, large chunks of Stanford
have become dependent on DoD
support. Right now, the Dean of
Engineering says over half of his
research support comes from
DoD. I don't know how many
hundreds of students, faculty and
staff depend on that flow of
funds, but it's a large number. The
President and Congress have
