# World War In White Plaza
## Governing â€”A Fluid Process 
### Roy Boggs 
Some months before the
beginning of World War 11, in the
fall of 1939, the Prime Minister of
the United Kingdom, Neville
Chamberlain, met with Germany's
Adolf Hitler in Munich. The
primary result of this summit
conference was that Britain
acquiesed to Germany's demands
for territorial aggrandizement at
the expense of carving up other
countries. Chamberlain felt that
by backing down, Hitler's
ambitions could be satisfied and
that to do otherwise, to take a
firm stand against the demands,
would most certainly have meant
war. Chamberlain returned to
Britain feeling he had secured
what he proclaimed to be "peace
in our time."
Such did not prove to be the
case. What did follow Munich was
World War 11, a war more ghastly
and globally pervasive than
anything before or since.
Most of the policy-makers at
Stanford and in the country at
large are people, mostly men, who
at least came of age during World
War 11. Many served in the armed
forces during it. Even for those
back here in the States the War
was the major fact of life. It
touched nearly everyone directly
or indirectly through close
relatives or friends at a personal
level. How many of us know anyone
who has fought in Vietnam or
anyone who was wounded or
anyone who was killed? At an
expensive, elite, private school
like Stanford I should wager very
few.
During W.W. II it seemed as
though everyone knew someone
overseas. For many middle-aged
Americans the War remains the
single most dramatic and
traumatic event in their lives, even
more so than the Great
Depression.
Resisting Challenge
People who lived through that
War often have a mind set that
reacts to any conflict situation
with the idea of appeasement as
an integral part of any
decision-making process. Whether
consciously or, as I suspect, more
often subconsciously, when such a
person sees himself challenged by
what he sees as illegitimate forces
that threaten his exclusive and
"rightful" control of a situation,
his answer is to resist the
challenge at all costs. To this way
of thinking, which derives from
the prewar stance Churchill
espoused and everyone else
ignored, an illegitimate challenge
to rightful authority must be
resisted. Appeasement will not

challenges and demands.
Here at Stanford, as at General
Motors headquarters in Detroit
and at the seat of government in
Washington, policy-makers always
feel they are exercising "rightful"
authority. They recognize as
legitimate only those challenges to
their authority that adhere to
rules they have set up themselves,
rules that guarantee that the
challenge will fail or at least be
sufficiently weakened so as to
preclude any real change in the
policy-making process.
Challenges from sources other
than those recognized by the
policy-makers are seen as
illegitimate and as such must be
resisted. This resolute resistance
to challenge is the key to
understanding the real origins of
campus unrest, racial tension and
international upheaval.
Conflicts arise
Stanford students protest,
racial minorities riot and the U.S.
goes on fighting in S.E. Asia not
nearly so much because decisions
were made with which these
groups disagreed; the conflicts
arise when policy decisions are
made and, despite widespread
popular sentiment to reverse or
alter them, the original policies
art 1 adhere to.
Such policies were and are
continued because those in
authority see the groups
demanding change as illegitimate
usurpers of rightful authority.
Giving in to marching students or
rioting blacks or upstart guerillas
in black pajamas is seen as
appeasement which must not be
allowed. So stupid policies are
continued not so much because
the policy-makers see them as
correct (even they probably
recognize how ill-advised they
are), but because they can not
allow themselves to seem to be
giving in to "mob tyranny."
Hospital sit-in
As an employee here I can
point to an incident last year that
illustrates my contention:
During the hospital sit-in the
demonstrators and the
administration had agreed on all
but one point before negotiations
broke down. That point was
whether or not Sam Bridges was
to be rehired before the grievance
procedure was activated. The
demonstrators insisted that he be
rehired first.
This was not an unreasonable
demand in view of policies in
other jobs. If a policeman, for
example, kills someone he may be
suspended from duty, not fired,

as much can be asked for one
accused of sleeping on the job.
The administration said no; it
could not allow such a breach of
policy. Rehiring one janitor was
seen as the first step toward mob
rule over the hospital.
I make the above statement as
one who served on an employee
grievance committee that heard
many hours of testimony from
administrators who made
decisions regarding the sit-in.
Resisting this "threat" to their
authority meant that the
administrators were willing to call
police into a hospital and face the
possibility of guns and gas being
used in the midst of sick people
rather than give in.
When one examines a local
situation like this one carefully,
looking at the states of mind
involved one can see why men
who are no more basically evil
than you or I can continue to
fight and lose a war for ten years
despite massive casualties abroad
and continued popular unrest at
home.
Strategic concessions
Policy at Stanford, as at most
levels of American life, is made by
people who have not learned that
the surest way to maintain power
and dominance is sometimes to
give in to those that challenge that
dominance. Strategic concessions
almost always serve to co-opt the
challenging forces and debilitate
the movement to depose those in
power. A good example of this
technique might be something like
increasing bombing and
announcing troop withdrawals at
the same time in Vietnam.
The problem is that all this is a
bit too Machiavellian for most
Americans. Everyone wants to act
secure in the conviction that he is
right. The result is mindless
intransigence from those in
authority answered by mindless
intransigence from those who
challenge that authority. Both
sides go on fighting while the rest
of the world dies in the cross-fire.
World War in White Plaza
Policy is made at Stanford by
people who think they are
fighting World War II in White
Plaza. The militant response to
that policy is made by other
people who too often think they
are fighting World War 111 in
White Plaza. Neither situation is
the case. Niether side is the bunch
of fascists that they accuse one
another of being. Both sides are
people who simply ignore reality
and its inherent ambiguities and
the natural necessity for
compromise. Meanwhile the world

for people to realize that a good
world for all can only arise when
people see that heroic conviction
must be replaced by humane
efficacy as the ethnical paradigm
for human endeavor.
Stanford and the world will be
a great deal nicer places when
administrators and world leaders
and those who oppose them act
not in terms of what they think is
right for themselves or their allies
but instead act in terms of what is
naturally best for all.

understanding the real origins of
campus unrest, racial tension and
international upheaval.
Conflicts arise
Stanford students protest,
racial minorities riot and the U.S.
goes on fighting in S.E. Asia not
nearly so much because decisions
were made with which these
groups disagreed; the conflicts
arise when policy decisions are
made and, despite widespread
popular sentiment to reverse or
alter them, the original policies
art 1 adhere to.
Such policies were and are
continued because those in
authority see the groups
demanding change as illegitimate
usurpers of rightful authority.
Giving in to marching students or
rioting blacks or upstart guerillas
in black pajamas is seen as
appeasement which must not be
allowed. So stupid policies are
continued not so much because
the policy-makers see them as
correct (even they probably
recognize how ill-advised they
are), but because they can not
allow themselves to seem to be
giving in to "mob tyranny."
Hospital sit-in
As an employee here I can
point to an incident last year that
illustrates my contention:
During the hospital sit-in the
demonstrators and the
administration had agreed on all
but one point before negotiations
broke down. That point was
whether or not Sam Bridges was
to be rehired before the grievance
procedure was activated. The
demonstrators insisted that he be
rehired first.
This was not an unreasonable
demand in view of policies in
other jobs. If a policeman, for
example, kills someone he may be
suspended from duty, not fired,

as much can be asked for one
accused of sleeping on the job.
The administration said no; it
could not allow such a breach of
policy. Rehiring one janitor was
seen as the first step toward mob
rule over the hospital.
I make the above statement as
one who served on an employee
grievance committee that heard
many hours of testimony from
administrators who made
decisions regarding the sit-in.
Resisting this "threat" to their
authority meant that the
administrators were willing to call
police into a hospital and face the
possibility of guns and gas being
used in the midst of sick people
rather than give in.
When one examines a local
situation like this one carefully,
looking at the states of mind
involved one can see why men
who are no more basically evil
than you or I can continue to
fight and lose a war for ten years
despite massive casualties abroad
and continued popular unrest at
home.
Strategic concessions
Policy at Stanford, as at most
levels of American life, is made by
people who have not learned that
the surest way to maintain power
and dominance is sometimes to
give in to those that challenge that
dominance. Strategic concessions
almost always serve to co-opt the
challenging forces and debilitate
the movement to depose those in
power. A good example of this
technique might be something like
increasing bombing and
announcing troop withdrawals at
the same time in Vietnam.
The problem is that all this is a
bit too Machiavellian for most
Americans. Everyone wants to act
secure in the conviction that he is
right. The result is mindless
intransigence from those in
authority answered by mindless
intransigence from those who
challenge that authority. Both
sides go on fighting while the rest
of the world dies in the cross-fire.
World War in White Plaza
Policy is made at Stanford by
people who think they are
fighting World War II in White
Plaza. The militant response to
that policy is made by other
people who too often think they
are fighting World War 111 in
White Plaza. Neither situation is
the case. Niether side is the bunch
of fascists that they accuse one
another of being. Both sides are
people who simply ignore reality
and its inherent ambiguities and
the natural necessity for
compromise. Meanwhile the world

for people to realize that a good
world for all can only arise when
people see that heroic conviction
must be replaced by humane
efficacy as the ethnical paradigm
for human endeavor.
Stanford and the world will be
a great deal nicer places when
administrators and world leaders
and those who oppose them act
not in terms of what they think is
right for themselves or their allies
but instead act in terms of what is
naturally best for all.

Some months before the
beginning of World War 11, in the
fall of 1939, the Prime Minister of
the United Kingdom, Neville
Chamberlain, met with Germany's
Adolf Hitler in Munich. The
primary result of this summit
conference was that Britain
acquiesed to Germany's demands
for territorial aggrandizement at
the expense of carving up other
countries. Chamberlain felt that
by backing down, Hitler's
ambitions could be satisfied and
that to do otherwise, to take a
firm stand against the demands,
would most certainly have meant
war. Chamberlain returned to
Britain feeling he had secured
what he proclaimed to be "peace
in our time."
Such did not prove to be the
case. What did follow Munich was
World War 11, a war more ghastly
and globally pervasive than
anything before or since.
Most of the policy-makers at
Stanford and in the country at
large are people, mostly men, who
at least came of age during World
War 11. Many served in the armed
forces during it. Even for those
back here in the States the War
was the major fact of life. It
touched nearly everyone directly
or indirectly through close
relatives or friends at a personal
level. How many of us know anyone
who has fought in Vietnam or
anyone who was wounded or
anyone who was killed? At an
expensive, elite, private school
like Stanford I should wager very
few.
During W.W. II it seemed as
though everyone knew someone
overseas. For many middle-aged
Americans the War remains the
single most dramatic and
traumatic event in their lives, even
more so than the Great
Depression.
Resisting Challenge
People who lived through that
War often have a mind set that
reacts to any conflict situation
with the idea of appeasement as
an integral part of any
decision-making process. Whether
consciously or, as I suspect, more
often subconsciously, when such a
person sees himself challenged by
what he sees as illegitimate forces
that threaten his exclusive and
"rightful" control of a situation,
his answer is to resist the
challenge at all costs. To this way
of thinking, which derives from
the prewar stance Churchill
espoused and everyone else
ignored, an illegitimate challenge
to rightful authority must be
resisted. Appeasement will not

challenges and demands.
Here at Stanford, as at General
Motors headquarters in Detroit
and at the seat of government in
Washington, policy-makers always
feel they are exercising "rightful"
authority. They recognize as
legitimate only those challenges to
their authority that adhere to
rules they have set up themselves,
rules that guarantee that the
challenge will fail or at least be
sufficiently weakened so as to
preclude any real change in the
policy-making process.
Challenges from sources other
than those recognized by the
policy-makers are seen as
illegitimate and as such must be
resisted. This resolute resistance
to challenge is the key to
understanding the real origins of
campus unrest, racial tension and
international upheaval.

bit too Machiavellian for most
Americans. Everyone wants to act
secure in the conviction that he is
right. The result is mindless
intransigence from those in
authority answered by mindless
intransigence from those who
challenge that authority. Both
sides go on fighting while the rest
of the world dies in the cross-fire.
World War in White Plaza
Policy is made at Stanford by
people who think they are
fighting World War II in White
Plaza. The militant response to
that policy is made by other
people who too often think they
are fighting World War 111 in
White Plaza. Neither situation is
the case. Niether side is the bunch
of fascists that they accuse one
another of being. Both sides are
people who simply ignore reality
and its inherent ambiguities and
the natural necessity for
compromise. Meanwhile the world

for people to realize that a good
world for all can only arise when
people see that heroic conviction
must be replaced by humane
efficacy as the ethnical paradigm
for human endeavor.
Stanford and the world will be
a great deal nicer places when
administrators and world leaders
and those who oppose them act
not in terms of what they think is
right for themselves or their allies
but instead act in terms of what is
naturally best for all.

Some months before the
beginning of World War 11, in the
fall of 1939, the Prime Minister of
the United Kingdom, Neville
Chamberlain, met with Germany's
Adolf Hitler in Munich. The
primary result of this summit
conference was that Britain
acquiesed to Germany's demands
for territorial aggrandizement at
the expense of carving up other
countries. Chamberlain felt that
by backing down, Hitler's
ambitions could be satisfied and
that to do otherwise, to take a
firm stand against the demands,
would most certainly have meant
war. Chamberlain returned to
Britain feeling he had secured
what he proclaimed to be "peace
in our time."
Such did not prove to be the
case. What did follow Munich was
World War 11, a war more ghastly
and globally pervasive than
anything before or since.
Most of the policy-makers at
Stanford and in the country at
large are people, mostly men, who
at least came of age during World
War 11. Many served in the armed
forces during it. Even for those
back here in the States the War
was the major fact of life. It
touched nearly everyone directly
or indirectly through close
relatives or friends at a personal
level. How many of us know anyone
who has fought in Vietnam or
anyone who was wounded or
anyone who was killed? At an
expensive, elite, private school
like Stanford I should wager very
few.
During W.W. II it seemed as
though everyone knew someone
overseas. For many middle-aged
Americans the War remains the
single most dramatic and
traumatic event in their lives, even
more so than the Great
Depression.
Resisting Challenge
People who lived through that
War often have a mind set that
reacts to any conflict situation
with the idea of appeasement as
an integral part of any
decision-making process. Whether
consciously or, as I suspect, more
often subconsciously, when such a
person sees himself challenged by
what he sees as illegitimate forces
that threaten his exclusive and
"rightful" control of a situation,
his answer is to resist the
challenge at all costs. To this way
of thinking, which derives from
the prewar stance Churchill
espoused and everyone else
ignored, an illegitimate challenge
to rightful authority must be
resisted. Appeasement will not

challenges and demands.
Here at Stanford, as at General
Motors headquarters in Detroit
and at the seat of government in
Washington, policy-makers always
feel they are exercising "rightful"
authority. They recognize as
legitimate only those challenges to
their authority that adhere to
rules they have set up themselves,
rules that guarantee that the
challenge will fail or at least be
sufficiently weakened so as to
preclude any real change in the
policy-making process.
Challenges from sources other
than those recognized by the
policy-makers are seen as
illegitimate and as such must be
resisted. This resolute resistance
to challenge is the key to
understanding the real origins of
campus unrest, racial tension and
international upheaval.
Conflicts arise
Stanford students protest,
racial minorities riot and the U.S.
goes on fighting in S.E. Asia not
nearly so much because decisions
were made with which these
groups disagreed; the conflicts
arise when policy decisions are
made and, despite widespread
popular sentiment to reverse or
alter them, the original policies
art 1 adhere to.
Such policies were and are
continued because those in
authority see the groups
demanding change as illegitimate
usurpers of rightful authority.
Giving in to marching students or
rioting blacks or upstart guerillas
in black pajamas is seen as
appeasement which must not be
allowed. So stupid policies are
continued not so much because
the policy-makers see them as
correct (even they probably
recognize how ill-advised they
are), but because they can not
allow themselves to seem to be
giving in to "mob tyranny."
Hospital sit-in
As an employee here I can
point to an incident last year that
illustrates my contention:
During the hospital sit-in the
demonstrators and the
administration had agreed on all
but one point before negotiations
broke down. That point was
whether or not Sam Bridges was
to be rehired before the grievance
procedure was activated. The
demonstrators insisted that he be
rehired first.
This was not an unreasonable
demand in view of policies in
other jobs. If a policeman, for
example, kills someone he may be
suspended from duty, not fired,

as much can be asked for one
accused of sleeping on the job.
The administration said no; it
could not allow such a breach of
policy. Rehiring one janitor was
seen as the first step toward mob
rule over the hospital.
I make the above statement as
one who served on an employee
grievance committee that heard
many hours of testimony from
administrators who made
decisions regarding the sit-in.
Resisting this "threat" to their
authority meant that the
administrators were willing to call
police into a hospital and face the
possibility of guns and gas being
used in the midst of sick people
rather than give in.
When one examines a local
situation like this one carefully,
looking at the states of mind
involved one can see why men
who are no more basically evil
than you or I can continue to
fight and lose a war for ten years
despite massive casualties abroad
and continued popular unrest at
home.
Strategic concessions
Policy at Stanford, as at most
levels of American life, is made by
people who have not learned that
the surest way to maintain power
and dominance is sometimes to
give in to those that challenge that
dominance. Strategic concessions
almost always serve to co-opt the
challenging forces and debilitate
the movement to depose those in
power. A good example of this
technique might be something like
increasing bombing and
announcing troop withdrawals at
the same time in Vietnam.
The problem is that all this is a
bit too Machiavellian for most
Americans. Everyone wants to act
secure in the conviction that he is
right. The result is mindless
intransigence from those in

intransigence from those who

more so than the Great
Depression.
Resisting Challenge
People who lived through that
War often have a mind set that
reacts to any conflict situation
with the idea of appeasement as
an integral part of any
decision-making process. Whether
consciously or, as I suspect, more
often subconsciously, when such a
person sees himself challenged by
what he sees as illegitimate forces
that threaten his exclusive and
"rightful" control of a situation,
his answer is to resist the
challenge at all costs. To this way
of thinking, which derives from
the prewar stance Churchill
espoused and everyone else
ignored, an illegitimate challenge
to rightful authority must be
resisted. Appeasement will not

challenges and demands.
Here at Stanford, as at General
Motors headquarters in Detroit
and at the seat of government in
Washington, policy-makers always
feel they are exercising "rightful"
authority. They recognize as
legitimate only those challenges to
their authority that adhere to
rules they have set up themselves,
rules that guarantee that the
challenge will fail or at least be
sufficiently weakened so as to
preclude any real change in the
policy-making process.
Challenges from sources other
than those recognized by the
policy-makers are seen as
illegitimate and as such must be
resisted. This resolute resistance
to challenge is the key to
understanding the real origins of
campus unrest, racial tension and
international upheaval.
Conflicts arise
Stanford students protest,
racial minorities riot and the U.S.
goes on fighting in S.E. Asia not
nearly so much because decisions
were made with which these
groups disagreed; the conflicts
arise when policy decisions are
made and, despite widespread
popular sentiment to reverse or
alter them, the original policies
art 1 adhere to.
Such policies were and are
continued because those in
authority see the groups
demanding change as illegitimate
usurpers of rightful authority.
Giving in to marching students or
rioting blacks or upstart guerillas
in black pajamas is seen as
appeasement which must not be
allowed. So stupid policies are
continued not so much because
the policy-makers see them as
correct (even they probably
recognize how ill-advised they
are), but because they can not
allow themselves to seem to be
giving in to "mob tyranny."
Hospital sit-in
As an employee here I can
point to an incident last year that
illustrates my contention:
During the hospital sit-in the
demonstrators and the
administration had agreed on all
but one point before negotiations
broke down. That point was
whether or not Sam Bridges was
to be rehired before the grievance
procedure was activated. The
demonstrators insisted that he be
rehired first.
This was not an unreasonable
demand in view of policies in
other jobs. If a policeman, for
example, kills someone he may be
suspended from duty, not fired,

as much can be asked for one
accused of sleeping on the job.
The administration said no; it
could not allow such a breach of
policy. Rehiring one janitor was
seen as the first step toward mob
rule over the hospital.
I make the above statement as
one who served on an employee
grievance committee that heard
many hours of testimony from
administrators who made
decisions regarding the sit-in.
Resisting this "threat" to their
authority meant that the
administrators were willing to call
police into a hospital and face the
possibility of guns and gas being
used in the midst of sick people
rather than give in.
When one examines a local
situation like this one carefully,
looking at the states of mind
involved one can see why men
who are no more basically evil
than you or I can continue to
fight and lose a war for ten years
despite massive casualties abroad
and continued popular unrest at
home.
Strategic concessions
Policy at Stanford, as at most
levels of American life, is made by
people who have not learned that
the surest way to maintain power
and dominance is sometimes to
give in to those that challenge that
dominance. Strategic concessions
almost always serve to co-opt the
challenging forces and debilitate
the movement to depose those in
power. A good example of this
technique might be something like
increasing bombing and
announcing troop withdrawals at
the same time in Vietnam.
The problem is that all this is a
bit too Machiavellian for most
Americans. Everyone wants to act
secure in the conviction that he is
right. The result is mindless
intransigence from those in
authority answered by mindless
intransigence from those who
challenge that authority. Both
sides go on fighting while the rest
of the world dies in the cross-fire.
World War in White Plaza
Policy is made at Stanford by
people who think they are
fighting World War II in White
Plaza. The militant response to
that policy is made by other
people who too often think they
are fighting World War 111 in
White Plaza. Neither situation is
the case. Niether side is the bunch
of fascists that they accuse one
another of being. Both sides are
people who simply ignore reality
and its inherent ambiguities and
the natural necessity for
compromise. Meanwhile the world

for people to realize that a good
world for all can only arise when
people see that heroic conviction
must be replaced by humane
efficacy as the ethnical paradigm
for human endeavor.
Stanford and the world will be
a great deal nicer places when
administrators and world leaders
and those who oppose them act
not in terms of what they think is
right for themselves or their allies
but instead act in terms of what is
naturally best for all.
