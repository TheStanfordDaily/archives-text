## Decision Flow Complicated 
### Robert M. Rosenzweig 
As I was standing in the
Business School the other day
watching a parade, a group of
about 100 people stopped to chat.
Among the subjects of interest to
them was how decisions are made
at Stanford and specifically who is
responsible for deciding whether
or not "war-related" companies
and agencies will be allowed to
recruit here.
I do not intend in this space to
argue the merits of such a
decision, or even to recapitulate
the differences that emerged on
the question of what the
decision-making process ought to
be. What impressed me most
about the discussion was that
none of us, myself included, was
certain about what the
decision-making process is—who
has a voice, with what weight, and
who has responsibility for a final
and binding decision. That such
uncertainty could exist among a
group of attentive people about
an issue of long-standing campus
concern reveals a great deal about
the way in which a university is
governed.
Governing a University
How is a university governed? I

suppose that the short answer is
that it isn't—at least not very
much. Indeed, the term
"governed" is really a kind of
metaphor, and its use can be
misleading if it serves to confirm
other imprecise images. A
university only loosely resembles
a political system; the
"community" of which we hear
so much, is but a distant relative
of a citizenry; our legislatures are
only beginning to be that; and our
courts are still in search of an
appropriate model. The scarcity
of law is matched by the
difficulty of enforcing that which
exists.
Understanding is complicated
still further by two additional
factors. The first is that a
university is not an institution
with a single function. A short list
will suffice to illustrate the point.
Some of the operations of a
university are indistinguishable
from those of a business—for
example, personnel, purchasing,
and accounting—and in carrying
them out the university looks for
all the world like a business.
Instruction is a quite different
function, however. Its patterns
flow from the supremacy of
knowledge over ignorance and
hence they are characterized by
the authority of the learned over
the learners. Research is different
still, harder than the others to
characterize, but marked generally
by a high degree of specialization,

autonomy, indeed even privatism.
Anti-government Tradition
The second complicating factor
is that university life contains a
strong anti-government tradition.
Until very recently it was a widely
shared view among faculties and
administrations that the very
process of governing, e.g.
codifying, enforcing, leading,
allocating, negotiating, etc., was
corrosive of the central values of
openness and private efforts
privately pursued. Such feelings
are by no means dead, but they
have been frayed considerably by
the pressure of events in recent
years.
Is a university a confusing
place? In view of all this, how
could it be otherwise? One looks
in vain for clear lines of authority.
Is the Board of Trustees
responsible for X? Yes, but
perhaps by the time X reaches the
Board for decision, X has gone
through so many hands that the
Board can do nothing but ratify
an accomplished fact. Is the
faculty responsible for Y? Yes,
but Y has implications for the
budget, for fund-raising, for
students, for ... fill in the blank.
I am not saying that nobody is
responsible for anything in the
university; obviously things do get
done. Budgets are made,
appointments and promotions
take place, land is developed (or
not), courses are taught, and so
forth. These are not, however, the

result of a single process which
one can describe with assurance
that similar decisions will follow
the identical process the next time
around. It is not simply that
university processes are evolving
and changing, that is so obvious as
to be hardly worth mentioning. It
is, rather, that the nature of the
institution guarantees a measure
of fluidity and most people in the
institution prefer it that way.
Complex Community
We can become the captive of
our metaphors, and our slogans.
"Faculty Autonomy" is at best
shorthand for an enormously
complex set of relationships.
"Student Power" may bring
people to the barricades, but it
will not tell them what needs to
be done if the revolution
succeeds. The world we are trying
to run here is too rich, too varied
to be described adequately by any
of these. Anyone who needs his
organizational life more tidy
might consider joining the army.
There, at least, you know who's in
charge. Those with a greater
tolerance for ambiguity, an ample
supply of sitzfleisch, a sense of
humor, and a genuine liking for
the interplay of strong minds
ought to stick with the university
for a while.
By the way, who would make
the decision to change recruiting
policy? I am still trying to run
that one down.

As I was standing in the
Business School the other day
watching a parade, a group of
about 100 people stopped to chat.
Among the subjects of interest to
them was how decisions are made
at Stanford and specifically who is
responsible for deciding whether
or not "war-related" companies
and agencies will be allowed to
recruit here.
I do not intend in this space to
argue the merits of such a
decision, or even to recapitulate
the differences that emerged on
the question of what the
decision-making process ought to
be. What impressed me most
about the discussion was that
none of us, myself included, was
certain about what the
decision-making process is—who
has a voice, with what weight, and
who has responsibility for a final
and binding decision. That such
uncertainty could exist among a
group of attentive people about
an issue of long-standing campus
concern reveals a great deal about
the way in which a university is
governed.
Governing a University
How is a university governed? I

suppose that the short answer is
that it isn't—at least not very
much. Indeed, the term
"governed" is really a kind of
metaphor, and its use can be
misleading if it serves to confirm
other imprecise images. A
university only loosely resembles
a political system; the
"community" of which we hear
so much, is but a distant relative
of a citizenry; our legislatures are
only beginning to be that; and our
courts are still in search of an
appropriate model. The scarcity
of law is matched by the
difficulty of enforcing that which
exists.
Understanding is complicated
still further by two additional
factors. The first is that a
university is not an institution
with a single function. A short list
will suffice to illustrate the point.
Some of the operations of a
university are indistinguishable
from those of a business—for
example, personnel, purchasing,
and accounting—and in carrying
them out the university looks for
all the world like a business.
Instruction is a quite different
function, however. Its patterns
flow from the supremacy of
knowledge over ignorance and
hence they are characterized by
the authority of the learned over
the learners. Research is different
still, harder than the others to
characterize, but marked generally
by a high degree of specialization,

autonomy, indeed even privatism.
Anti-government Tradition
The second complicating factor
is that university life contains a
strong anti-government tradition.
Until very recently it was a widely
shared view among faculties and
administrations that the very
process of governing, e.g.
codifying, enforcing, leading,
allocating, negotiating, etc., was
corrosive of the central values of
openness and private efforts
privately pursued. Such feelings
are by no means dead, but they
have been frayed considerably by
the pressure of events in recent
years.
Is a university a confusing
place? In view of all this, how
could it be otherwise? One looks
in vain for clear lines of authority.
Is the Board of Trustees
responsible for X? Yes, but
perhaps by the time X reaches the
Board for decision, X has gone
through so many hands that the
Board can do nothing but ratify
an accomplished fact. Is the
faculty responsible for Y? Yes,
but Y has implications for the
budget, for fund-raising, for
students, for ... fill in the blank.
I am not saying that nobody is
responsible for anything in the
university; obviously things do get
done. Budgets are made,
appointments and promotions
take place, land is developed (or
not), courses are taught, and so
forth. These are not, however, the

result of a single process which
one can describe with assurance
that similar decisions will follow
the identical process the next time
around. It is not simply that
university processes are evolving
and changing, that is so obvious as
to be hardly worth mentioning. It
is, rather, that the nature of the
institution guarantees a measure
of fluidity and most people in the
institution prefer it that way.
Complex Community
We can become the captive of
our metaphors, and our slogans.
"Faculty Autonomy" is at best
shorthand for an enormously
complex set of relationships.
"Student Power" may bring
people to the barricades, but it
will not tell them what needs to
be done if the revolution
succeeds. The world we are trying
to run here is too rich, too varied
to be described adequately by any
of these. Anyone who needs his
organizational life more tidy
might consider joining the army.
There, at least, you know who's in
charge. Those with a greater
tolerance for ambiguity, an ample

appointments and promotions
take place, land is developed (or
not), courses are taught, and so
forth. These are not, however, the

result of a single process which
one can describe with assurance
that similar decisions will follow
the identical process the next time
around. It is not simply that
university processes are evolving
and changing, that is so obvious as
to be hardly worth mentioning. It
is, rather, that the nature of the
institution guarantees a measure
of fluidity and most people in the
institution prefer it that way.
Complex Community
We can become the captive of
our metaphors, and our slogans.
"Faculty Autonomy" is at best
shorthand for an enormously
complex set of relationships.
"Student Power" may bring
people to the barricades, but it
will not tell them what needs to
be done if the revolution
succeeds. The world we are trying
to run here is too rich, too varied
to be described adequately by any
of these. Anyone who needs his
organizational life more tidy
might consider joining the army.
There, at least, you know who's in
charge. Those with a greater
tolerance for ambiguity, an ample
supply of sitzfleisch, a sense of
humor, and a genuine liking for
the interplay of strong minds
ought to stick with the university
for a while.
By the way, who would make
the decision to change recruiting
policy? I am still trying to run
that one down.

As I was standing in the
Business School the other day
watching a parade, a group of
about 100 people stopped to chat.
Among the subjects of interest to
them was how decisions are made
at Stanford and specifically who is
responsible for deciding whether
or not "war-related" companies
and agencies will be allowed to
recruit here.
I do not intend in this space to
argue the merits of such a
decision, or even to recapitulate
the differences that emerged on
the question of what the
decision-making process ought to
be. What impressed me most
about the discussion was that
none of us, myself included, was
certain about what the
decision-making process is—who
has a voice, with what weight, and
who has responsibility for a final
and binding decision. That such
uncertainty could exist among a
group of attentive people about
an issue of long-standing campus
concern reveals a great deal about
the way in which a university is
governed.
Governing a University
How is a university governed? I

suppose that the short answer is
that it isn't—at least not very
much. Indeed, the term
"governed" is really a kind of
metaphor, and its use can be
misleading if it serves to confirm
other imprecise images. A
university only loosely resembles
a political system; the
"community" of which we hear
so much, is but a distant relative
of a citizenry; our legislatures are
only beginning to be that; and our
courts are still in search of an
appropriate model. The scarcity
of law is matched by the
difficulty of enforcing that which
exists.
Understanding is complicated
still further by two additional
factors. The first is that a
university is not an institution
with a single function. A short list
will suffice to illustrate the point.
Some of the operations of a
university are indistinguishable
from those of a business—for
example, personnel, purchasing,
and accounting—and in carrying
them out the university looks for
all the world like a business.
Instruction is a quite different
function, however. Its patterns
flow from the supremacy of
knowledge over ignorance and
hence they are characterized by
the authority of the learned over
the learners. Research is different
still, harder than the others to
characterize, but marked generally
by a high degree of specialization,

autonomy, indeed even privatism.
Anti-government Tradition
The second complicating factor
is that university life contains a
strong anti-government tradition.
Until very recently it was a widely
shared view among faculties and
administrations that the very
process of governing, e.g.
codifying, enforcing, leading,
allocating, negotiating, etc., was
corrosive of the central values of
openness and private efforts
privately pursued. Such feelings
are by no means dead, but they
have been frayed considerably by
the pressure of events in recent
years.
Is a university a confusing
place? In view of all this, how
could it be otherwise? One looks
in vain for clear lines of authority.
Is the Board of Trustees
responsible for X? Yes, but
perhaps by the time X reaches the
Board for decision, X has gone
through so many hands that the
Board can do nothing but ratify
an accomplished fact. Is the
faculty responsible for Y? Yes,
but Y has implications for the
budget, for fund-raising, for
students, for ... fill in the blank.
I am not saying that nobody is
responsible for anything in the
university; obviously things do get
done. Budgets are made,
appointments and promotions
take place, land is developed (or
not), courses are taught, and so
forth. These are not, however, the

result of a single process which
