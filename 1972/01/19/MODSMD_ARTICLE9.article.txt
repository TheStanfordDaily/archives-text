# Minority Rule
## Legitimacy In A Decision-Making Process 
### David Josephson 
At Stanford University we have three different areas of decisions.
There is the University (education), the Stanford Corporation
(investments) and the Stanfotl community (lands) decisions. All three
areas affect each other and all three areas affect thousands of peoples'
lives. These areas of decision-making combine to own and run 8,800
acres of land, resources that directly affect the lives of thousands of
people (investments of approximately $250,000,000 in stocks and
bonds, an industrial park, shopping center, hospital facilities,
residential housing, commercial financial centers (Dillingham), a
university, recreational facilities and lands with a wide variety of
potential uses.)
We can generally see the difference between advising and
implementation in the decision-making process, but what we may not
readily see is the question of legitimacy, not necessarily of legality, in
the manner in which decisions are made at Stanford.
In terms of this question of legitimacy in the decision-making here
at Stanford, let's look at the issues of the Franklin case and the
controversy over the present recruitment policy at Stanford. As we
now all know, the administration of the University, which is simply
one segment of the constituencies that make up Stanford, has decided
to act in firing Bruce Franklin because he has been found guilty of
breaking University policy, not law. This distinction is very important.
Legally an innocent man is being fired from his job because he has
violated University policies. This makes the clear point that the
University administration does set up policies for which all members
of the Stanford community take the consequences (remembering the
distinction between advising and implementing).
Now suppose the question of what is at issue in a particular
controversy cannot be agreed upon. Somebody says the University as
an institution is letting its facilities (placement center) he used to
directly help the military and corporations directly killing people
throughout the world. Another member of the Stanford community
sees the issue as dealing with individual rights. What legitimate process
is open to resolving the conflict between the different points of view?
What is at stake is the fundamental conflict over wanting to define a
problem in basically different ways. At present, only the
administration and Trustees have the actual legal power to decide
these basic differences, even though they are in the middle of the
conflict.
This process is illegitimate, legal perhaps, but illegitimate. The case
of Bruce Franklin illustrates this point. The administration, an active
opponent of Franklin, brings charges of violation of University policy
against him. In what representative manner were these policies
decided? In what representative manner did the constituency have to
implement their decision on Franklin? None. In each case the
administration and Trustees have the power of decision, not the
people whose lives suffer the consequences of these acts.

Stanford is for us to consider the types of creative acts the
administration takes. This question reaches very important dimensions
when we keep in mind 1) the administration in almost all cases has the
sole power to implement decisions, 2) it primarily does not administer
other constituencies' ideas and proposed actions, but initiates and sets
the ground rules for the three areas of decision-making mentioned
earlier.
Where is the low-moderate income housing? Waylaid a hundred
times. Where is the positive supportive action to create innovation in
education at Stanford? Certainly not at the many road blocks
continually put before any innovation in education here. Where is the
change in corporate responsibility for our $250,000,000 in
investments? Not in proposing a fund raising drive for an additional
$300,000,000 which will be invested in a manner highly criticized by
members of the Stanford community, be they Project GM or anti-war
positions. What we do see is an ongoing creation towards highly urban
development on the Stanford lands, and Trustees and Hoover Institute
overseers coming primarily from a small portion of the political
spectrum whose prime purpose is industry and finance, very much
counter to many of the values of a significant portion of the Stanford
Community. Along with this use of the power to implement decisions
at Stanford comes the ever increasing negative forces of stopping
other segments of the community from bringing their creations to
life.
If we of the Stanford community wish to have positive change in
the way the resources of our community are used, and actually have
creative actions in the areas of education and life that can bring
greater equality to peoples' lives, we much change who has power here
at Stanford. Since only one segment of the community has a
monopoly on the power to implement decisions we can clearly claim
this to be illegitimate. We must therefore turn to a struggle that will
carry us beyond University policy (which we do not have the power
to implement or design to begin with).
Levels of bureaucracy cannot cover the fact that decisions go on in
this community that affect thousands of lives and that we are ruled by
a very small minority.
At present we at Stanford have an odd dilemma to work out:
which minority will rule? Given the state of those in our community
who don't care ahout many actions we take as an institution, or are
scared to come out with their own actions, we actually have a conflict
of minorities. This is not a case of majority supressing minorities, but
of which minority will prevail.
I don't want to have the exclusive power of the Trustees or the
administrations, I don't want to take someone's or some group's place
of power. I want no one, or group, to have such power. We want full
power to equally implement decisions.

to act in firing Bruce Franklin because he has been found guilty of
breaking University policy, not law. This distinction is very important.
Legally an innocent man is being fired from his job because he has
violated University policies. This makes the clear point that the
University administration does set up policies for which all members
of the Stanford community take the consequences (remembering the
distinction between advising and implementing).
Now suppose the question of what is at issue in a particular
controversy cannot be agreed upon. Somebody says the University as
an institution is letting its facilities (placement center) he used to
directly help the military and corporations directly killing people
throughout the world. Another member of the Stanford community
sees the issue as dealing with individual rights. What legitimate process
is open to resolving the conflict between the different points of view?
What is at stake is the fundamental conflict over wanting to define a
problem in basically different ways. At present, only the
administration and Trustees have the actual legal power to decide
these basic differences, even though they are in the middle of the
conflict.
This process is illegitimate, legal perhaps, but illegitimate. The case
of Bruce Franklin illustrates this point. The administration, an active
opponent of Franklin, brings charges of violation of University policy
against him. In what representative manner were these policies
decided? In what representative manner did the constituency have to
implement their decision on Franklin? None. In each case the
administration and Trustees have the power of decision, not the
people whose lives suffer the consequences of these acts.

Stanford is for us to consider the types of creative acts the
administration takes. This question reaches very important dimensions
when we keep in mind 1) the administration in almost all cases has the
sole power to implement decisions, 2) it primarily does not administer
other constituencies' ideas and proposed actions, but initiates and sets
the ground rules for the three areas of decision-making mentioned
earlier.
Where is the low-moderate income housing? Waylaid a hundred
times. Where is the positive supportive action to create innovation in
education at Stanford? Certainly not at the many road blocks
continually put before any innovation in education here. Where is the
change in corporate responsibility for our $250,000,000 in
investments? Not in proposing a fund raising drive for an additional
$300,000,000 which will be invested in a manner highly criticized by
members of the Stanford community, be they Project GM or anti-war
positions. What we do see is an ongoing creation towards highly urban
development on the Stanford lands, and Trustees and Hoover Institute
overseers coming primarily from a small portion of the political
spectrum whose prime purpose is industry and finance, very much
counter to many of the values of a significant portion of the Stanford
Community. Along with this use of the power to implement decisions
at Stanford comes the ever increasing negative forces of stopping
other segments of the community from bringing their creations to
life.
If we of the Stanford community wish to have positive change in
the way the resources of our community are used, and actually have
creative actions in the areas of education and life that can bring
greater equality to peoples' lives, we much change who has power here
at Stanford. Since only one segment of the community has a
monopoly on the power to implement decisions we can clearly claim
this to be illegitimate. We must therefore turn to a struggle that will
carry us beyond University policy (which we do not have the power
to implement or design to begin with).
Levels of bureaucracy cannot cover the fact that decisions go on in
this community that affect thousands of lives and that we are ruled by
a very small minority.
At present we at Stanford have an odd dilemma to work out:
which minority will rule? Given the state of those in our community
who don't care ahout many actions we take as an institution, or are
scared to come out with their own actions, we actually have a conflict
of minorities. This is not a case of majority supressing minorities, but
of which minority will prevail.
I don't want to have the exclusive power of the Trustees or the
administrations, I don't want to take someone's or some group's place
of power. I want no one, or group, to have such power. We want full
power to equally implement decisions.

At Stanford University we have three different areas of decisions.
There is the University (education), the Stanford Corporation
(investments) and the Stanfotl community (lands) decisions. All three
areas affect each other and all three areas affect thousands of peoples'
lives. These areas of decision-making combine to own and run 8,800
acres of land, resources that directly affect the lives of thousands of
people (investments of approximately $250,000,000 in stocks and
bonds, an industrial park, shopping center, hospital facilities,
residential housing, commercial financial centers (Dillingham), a
university, recreational facilities and lands with a wide variety of
potential uses.)
We can generally see the difference between advising and
implementation in the decision-making process, but what we may not
readily see is the question of legitimacy, not necessarily of legality, in
the manner in which decisions are made at Stanford.

against him. In what representative manner were these policies
decided? In what representative manner did the constituency have to
implement their decision on Franklin? None. In each case the
administration and Trustees have the power of decision, not the
people whose lives suffer the consequences of these acts.

Stanford is for us to consider the types of creative acts the
administration takes. This question reaches very important dimensions
when we keep in mind 1) the administration in almost all cases has the
sole power to implement decisions, 2) it primarily does not administer
other constituencies' ideas and proposed actions, but initiates and sets
the ground rules for the three areas of decision-making mentioned
earlier.
Where is the low-moderate income housing? Waylaid a hundred
times. Where is the positive supportive action to create innovation in
education at Stanford? Certainly not at the many road blocks
continually put before any innovation in education here. Where is the
change in corporate responsibility for our $250,000,000 in
investments? Not in proposing a fund raising drive for an additional
$300,000,000 which will be invested in a manner highly criticized by
members of the Stanford community, be they Project GM or anti-war
positions. What we do see is an ongoing creation towards highly urban
development on the Stanford lands, and Trustees and Hoover Institute
overseers coming primarily from a small portion of the political
spectrum whose prime purpose is industry and finance, very much
counter to many of the values of a significant portion of the Stanford
Community. Along with this use of the power to implement decisions
at Stanford comes the ever increasing negative forces of stopping
other segments of the community from bringing their creations to
life.
If we of the Stanford community wish to have positive change in
the way the resources of our community are used, and actually have
creative actions in the areas of education and life that can bring
greater equality to peoples' lives, we much change who has power here
at Stanford. Since only one segment of the community has a
monopoly on the power to implement decisions we can clearly claim
this to be illegitimate. We must therefore turn to a struggle that will
carry us beyond University policy (which we do not have the power
to implement or design to begin with).
Levels of bureaucracy cannot cover the fact that decisions go on in
this community that affect thousands of lives and that we are ruled by
a very small minority.
At present we at Stanford have an odd dilemma to work out:
which minority will rule? Given the state of those in our community
who don't care ahout many actions we take as an institution, or are
scared to come out with their own actions, we actually have a conflict
of minorities. This is not a case of majority supressing minorities, but
of which minority will prevail.
I don't want to have the exclusive power of the Trustees or the
administrations, I don't want to take someone's or some group's place
of power. I want no one, or group, to have such power. We want full
power to equally implement decisions.

At Stanford University we have three different areas of decisions.
There is the University (education), the Stanford Corporation
(investments) and the Stanfotl community (lands) decisions. All three
areas affect each other and all three areas affect thousands of peoples'
lives. These areas of decision-making combine to own and run 8,800
acres of land, resources that directly affect the lives of thousands of
people (investments of approximately $250,000,000 in stocks and
bonds, an industrial park, shopping center, hospital facilities,
residential housing, commercial financial centers (Dillingham), a
university, recreational facilities and lands with a wide variety of
potential uses.)
We can generally see the difference between advising and
implementation in the decision-making process, but what we may not
readily see is the question of legitimacy, not necessarily of legality, in
the manner in which decisions are made at Stanford.
In terms of this question of legitimacy in the decision-making here
at Stanford, let's look at the issues of the Franklin case and the
controversy over the present recruitment policy at Stanford. As we
now all know, the administration of the University, which is simply
one segment of the constituencies that make up Stanford, has decided
to act in firing Bruce Franklin because he has been found guilty of
breaking University policy, not law. This distinction is very important.
Legally an innocent man is being fired from his job because he has
violated University policies. This makes the clear point that the
University administration does set up policies for which all members
of the Stanford community take the consequences (remembering the
distinction between advising and implementing).
Now suppose the question of what is at issue in a particular
controversy cannot be agreed upon. Somebody says the University as
an institution is letting its facilities (placement center) he used to
directly help the military and corporations directly killing people
throughout the world. Another member of the Stanford community
sees the issue as dealing with individual rights. What legitimate process
is open to resolving the conflict between the different points of view?
What is at stake is the fundamental conflict over wanting to define a
problem in basically different ways. At present, only the
administration and Trustees have the actual legal power to decide
these basic differences, even though they are in the middle of the
conflict.
This process is illegitimate, legal perhaps, but illegitimate. The case
of Bruce Franklin illustrates this point. The administration, an active
opponent of Franklin, brings charges of violation of University policy
against him. In what representative manner were these policies
decided? In what representative manner did the constituency have to
implement their decision on Franklin? None. In each case the
administration and Trustees have the power of decision, not the
people whose lives suffer the consequences of these acts.
