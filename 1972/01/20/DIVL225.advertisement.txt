BY WALT DISNEY
1 NEWMAN S LAUGHOGRAMS
(1925)
Disney's very first cartoons, never
before seen in Berkeley and only
recently discovered. These are political
cartoons which comment on the evils
of liberalism and the menace of
creeping socialism. Disney himself
appears in this uproarious combination
of live action and animation.
THE MICKEY MOUSE
TRILOGY (1932-1934)
Next to steamboat Willie, these are
unquestionably the classic Mickey
cartoons: MICHEY AND SIMON
LEGREE, GOLDRUSH MICKEY,
ROBINSON CRUSOE MICKEY. Each
one illustrates a part of the
development of the Mouse character
that we all have come to know and
love as the years rolled by.
DONALD DUCK
THE MECHANIC (1933)
| One of the very first that starred the
mad anarchist in this one, Donald,
Mickey, and Goofy encounter the
villainous Black Pete.
DONALD DUCK
THE REPAIRMAN (1934)
Here Donald is on his own, trying to
I cope with his fiery temper and the
machine age.
MICKEY'S GALA PREMIERE
(1933)
I Disney's salute to Hollywood's
: immortals. To the premiere of a new
i Mickey Mouse cartoon at Grand
j Grauman's theater come animated
I characterizations of the stars: Wallace
Beery, Clark Gable, the Marx Brothers,
! Marie Dressier, and Many more.
ALICE S EGG PLANT (1927)
Don't miss this one! A rare gem that is
I Disney's paranoid vision of
I communism in the trade unions as
| fomented by the I.W.W. High Camp.
j CHRISTMAS TOYLAND (1929)
A beautiful, sentimental vision that
was the forrunner of so many musical
| cartoons.
BY OTHER
ANIMATORS:
MOVIE MAD (1930)
This was a brilliant work by V.B.
Iwerkers, a pioneer animator who later
created Disney's WIND IN THE
WILLOWS. This one features Charlie
Chaplin, Laurel & Hardy, and Flip The
Frog.
CONQUEST OF THE POLE
(1909)
I George Melies incredible, surreal bag of
| magic and fantasy.
THE HASHER S DELIRIUM
(1912)
An original Emile Cohl primitive on
I the evils of marijuana and opium.
MARINE FANTASY (1925)
JAn early experiment in the beauties of
J hand-tinted frames. Made in the famed
Pathe-Freres studios. An amazing
! technical triumph which captures the
perfection of an underwater world.
