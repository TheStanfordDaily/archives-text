Now interviewing
Not long ago everybody was, or so it seems. Times change.
And so do many career plans as a result. We find this is true
to an extent in our business. Because, typically, the senior we
interview had his sights set on something else. Chances are,
too, he would have been successful. (We wouldn't have it any
other way.) But now, the promise of a meaningful future lies
in another direction.
What do we offer such a person? Expert supervision and
training when he starts and a salary to meet his immediate
needs. Prospects of earning a much higher than average
income will improve rapidly as he learns our business:
designing financial plans for individual and corporations. It's
something to think about. And then if you're interested in
talking about it, call
