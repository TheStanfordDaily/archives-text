## Land Policy Aids Cities 
### ROBERT BACON Second in a series 
"In many other university towns,
the institution saps city services and
doesn't pay any city tax. Here, it's the
reverse. Our developed
commercial-industrial lands subsidize
the residential areas of Palo Alto,"
stated Land Resources Manger Boyd
Smith.
"Stanford just wants to dump its
problem areas in our laps," countered
Palo Alto councilwoman Enid Person
last November 8.
Stanford's 8,800-acre land
endowment obviously looms large in
any discussion of the interchange
between the University and its
neighboring agencies of local
government.
Annexation
All of Stanford's
commercially-developed lands are
annexed to neighboring
municipalities—the Industrial Park,
Shopping Center, Medical Center,
Professional Park, and Oak Creek
Apartments to Palo Alto; and
relatively small areas in the foothills to
Menlo Park, Woodside, and Portola
Valley. The central campus, faculty

housing, Escondido Village, and
Academic Reserve are not annexed.
Smith pointed out that the
annexation arrangements are beneficial
both to Stanford and to the cities.
"Annexation of the developed
areas means that the city provides the
services, such as water, sewer, power,
streets, and police and fire
protection—Stanford has made its
decision to spend its money on
education, not on providing these
municipal services to the developed
lands," he noted.
Palo Alto benefits substantially as
well. Stanford land generates almost a
third of the city's property tax
revenue and more than a third of its
utility income.
The fact that the central campus
and Academic Reserve, both exempt
from taxation, are not annexed
obviously benefits Palo Alto
financially. The city would receive no
tax revenue from these lands even if
they were annexed, but if they were
part of Palo Alto it would be required
to provide municipal services.
According to Smith,
non-annexation of the main campus
represents a conscious decision in the

University's early history to maintain
autonomy from local governmental
agencies.
School District Gains
Big gainer, taxation-wise, is the Palo
Alto Unified School District, which
includes all of the Stanford land
within Santa Clara County, including
the main campus. Its total tax revenue
from developed Stanford land
(including faculty housing) is nearly
$5 million annually, and the
commercial and industrial lands have
no population and hence no students
whom it must serve.
The faculty housing is not annexed,
says Smith, because the faculty does
not want it. "There is some interest in
annexation in the new Frenchman's
Hill area; no one knows how much. But
in some of the older areas 100 per cent
of the residents bitterly oppose it."
Smith added, "If the faculty
wanted to join Palo Alto, the
University would seriously consider it.
It's not correct to say that Stanford
tries to block annexation of the
faculty housing," the apparent import
of Councilwoman Pearson's remark.
As a general rule, here and

and Stanford, and have evoked criticism from residentialists.
elsewhere, under a property tax,
commercial and industrial property
subsidizes residential property.
Non-residential areas generally pay
more in taxes than the value of the
services they receive from local
agencies, while residential areas receive
more in services (largely public
schools) than they pay in taxes.
Industrial and commercial landowners
pay the same percentage of the value
of their property as do homeowners,
to school districts as well as to other
public agencies.
Tax Exempt
Land use for academic purposes is
exempt from property taxation, under
the California Constitution. Land not
used for academic purposes is not
exempted, even though an educational
institution owns it.
The latter fact is the principal
reason why Stanford entered the land
development business in the early
1950'5. Property taxation made its
lands a financial liability, particularly
as state law requires the tax to be
based on the property's value in its
"highest and best use," regardless of
its actual use.
Under Stanford's leases to
industrial, commercial, and residential
tenants, the tenant pays local property

taxes on both land and buildings to
the governmental agencies, in addition
to paying a lease fee to Stanford.
Last year Stanford's income from
land leases was $2.2 million;
Stanford's tenants paid local property
taxes of about $10 million.
The undeveloped lands outside the
Academic Reserve, largely in the
vicinity of SLAC, cost Stanford itself
$835,000 last year in property taxes.
The fact that all the Academic
Reserve is untaxed, including that
portion being held for future campus
expansion and currently used only for
grazing, has prompted the question,
"Why not put all the undeveloped land
in the Academic Reserve and escape
taxation in that way?"
The nature of property tax
assessment is such that all land is
assumed to be taxable until and unless
proven otherwise, University officials
explain. The decision rests with the
county tax assessor, who might well be
hesitant about exempting from
taxation land with high potential
development value, located several
miles from the main campus.
Williamson Act
Critics of Stanford's land policies
often point to the California Land
Conservation Act of 1965, otherwise
known as the Williamson Act, as
another possible way for Stanford to

escape the heavy tax burden on its
foothill lands without developing
them.
In brief, the Williamson Act
provides that if a landowner agrees to
keep land in agricultural use or open
space for a minimum of 10 years, it
will be assessed on the basis of its
value in its current use, rather than on
the basis of its development potential.
University officials say they are
looking at the possibility of placing
the Webb Ranch, near SLAC, under
the Act, but point to the procedure
for removing land from the Act's
purview as a major drawback.
The agreement between the
landowner and county officials is for
10 years, and is annually renewed, (it
always has between nine and ten years
to run). Hence, if a decision to remove
land from open space and develop it,
for academic or commercial use, is
made, the owner must wait nine years
to do so, and in the meantime pay a
tax almost as high as that imposed on
the land's full development potential.
The alternative, immediate
cancellation of the agreement, requires
approval of the County Board of
Sueprvisers and entails a cancellation
fee equal to one-eighth of the land's
full market value. In many cases this
fee would be greater than the total
amount of taxes saved by placing land

under the Act.
In effect, then, the Williamson Act
imposes a long-term commitment and
effectively precludes recovery of land
for unforeseen academic needs.
In an attempt to make the
Williamson Act better suit Stanford's
needs, a bill was introduced in last
year's State Legislature at the request
of University officials. It would have
permitted educational institutions to
recover land placed under the Act to
meet academic needs without a
cancellation fee. No action was taken
on the bill.
According to Stanford Vice
President for Business and Finance
Robert E. Augsburger, the University
intends to seek such legislation again
this year. "We need the support of
surrounding communities to get it
passed," he said. "We had no such
support last year."
That is a very familiar situation for
Stanford land development officials.
Land policies are based on a nearly
continuous process of interaction
between the University and its
municipal neighbors, each seeking the
other's necessary support. From that
interaction has evolved a situation
that, although far from eliminating all
conflicts, appears, more often than
not, to be mutually beneficial.
