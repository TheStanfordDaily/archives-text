## Land Policy Aids Cities 
### ROBERT BACON Second in a series 
"In many other university towns,
the institution saps city services and
doesn't pay any city tax. Here, it's the
reverse. Our developed
commercial-industrial lands subsidize
the residential areas of Palo Alto,"
stated Land Resources Manger Boyd
Smith.
"Stanford just wants to dump its
problem areas in our laps," countered
Palo Alto councilwoman Enid Person
last November 8.
Stanford's 8,800-acre land
endowment obviously looms large in
any discussion of the interchange
between the University and its
neighboring agencies of local
government.
Annexation
All of Stanford's
commercially-developed lands are
annexed to neighboring
municipalities—the Industrial Park,
Shopping Center, Medical Center,
Professional Park, and Oak Creek
Apartments to Palo Alto; and
relatively small areas in the foothills to
Menlo Park, Woodside, and Portola
Valley. The central campus, faculty

housing, Escondido Village, and
Academic Reserve are not annexed.
Smith pointed out that the
annexation arrangements are beneficial
both to Stanford and to the cities.
"Annexation of the developed
areas means that the city provides the
services, such as water, sewer, power,
streets, and police and fire
protection—Stanford has made its
decision to spend its money on
education, not on providing these
municipal services to the developed
lands," he noted.
Palo Alto benefits substantially as
well. Stanford land generates almost a
third of the city's property tax
revenue and more than a third of its
utility income.
The fact that the central campus
and Academic Reserve, both exempt
from taxation, are not annexed
obviously benefits Palo Alto
financially. The city would receive no
tax revenue from these lands even if
they were annexed, but if they were
part of Palo Alto it would be required
to provide municipal services.
According to Smith,
non-annexation of the main campus
represents a conscious decision in the

University's early history to maintain
autonomy from local governmental
agencies.
School District Gains
Big gainer, taxation-wise, is the Palo
Alto Unified School District, which
includes all of the Stanford land
within Santa Clara County, including
the main campus. Its total tax revenue
from developed Stanford land
(including faculty housing) is nearly
$5 million annually, and the
commercial and industrial lands have
no population and hence no students
whom it must serve.
The faculty housing is not annexed,
says Smith, because the faculty does
not want it. "There is some interest in
annexation in the new Frenchman's
Hill area; no one knows how much. But
in some of the older areas 100 per cent
of the residents bitterly oppose it."
Smith added, "If the faculty
wanted to join Palo Alto, the
University would seriously consider it.
It's not correct to say that Stanford
tries to block annexation of the
faculty housing," the apparent import
of Councilwoman Pearson's remark.
As a general rule, here and

LAND HO—The Stanford lands shown are among those which have both mutually benefited neighboring communities
and Stanford, and have evoked criticism from residentialists.
