# Engineer To Live In Orbit
## 
### 
The first three Skylab space
station crews, announced
yesterday by the National
Aeronautics and Space
Administration, will include
Stanford's scientist-astronaut
Owen K. Garriott, on leave from
his post as a professor of electrical
engineering.
Garriott, 41, will be a member
of the second crew to man the
earth-orbiting Skylab satellite and
the first crew to spend two
months in space. The initial crew
will spend one month aloft.
The 1973 Skylab program will

follow the Apollo moon-landing
program which terminates this
year. The first Skylab crew,
commanded by Capt. Pete Conrad
of Apollo 12, will include scientist
astronaut Dr. Joseph P. Kerwin,a
physician, and Lt. Cdr. Paul J.
Weitz. It is scheduled for lift-off
April 30.
Garriott's mission will be
commanded by Capt. Alan Bean,

and is scheduled for a July 28
lift-off. Maj. Jack Lousma will be
the third crew member.
Garriott was selected as a
scientist-astronaut by NASA in
June 1965. He first completed a
year's flight training in jet
airplanes, and has since been in
training at the Manned Spacecraft
Center in Houston for manned
space flight.
