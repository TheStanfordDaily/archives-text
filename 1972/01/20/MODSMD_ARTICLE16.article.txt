# Play Examines Soviet Persecution
## 
### JOSEPH FIKSEL 
Nestled in the Civic Center of
Menlo Park, just a stone's throw
from campus, is the Burgess
Theatre, one of the many
community theatres that flourish
in the Bay Area.
The Burgess is the home of the
Menlo Player's Guild, a
long-established group of
enthusiastic amateurs, who are
presently introducing the West
Coast Premier of "The
Headhunters," by Henry Denker.
A drama which is just opening
on Broadway, "The Headhunters"
deals with the persecution of
Soviet writers by the state. Much
attention has been focussed on
the plight of Russian intellectuals
such as Alexander Solzhenistyn,
who was prevented from
accepting his Nobel Prize for
Literature, and the Medvedev
brothers, Roy and Zhores, under
constant harrassment for their
courageous exposes of Stalinist
and post-Stalinist repression.
Denker, a well-known
American playwright, had hoped
to adapt Solzhenistyn's "The First
Circle" to the stage—so the story
goes—but learned that further
recognition could only imperil the
author. Instead, he decided to
dramatize the real and poignant
predicament of Solzhenistyn
himself, and so Headhunters was
born.
Stay In Siberia
The play described the
homecoming of Pavel Andreyev, a
Russian novelist who was falsely
accused of permitting his work to
be published abroad, and received
a seven-year sentence at a Siberian
prison-camp.
He comes stumbling into his
old flat, haunted by bleak and
horrible memories of the camp,
consumed by paranoia and
self-doubt, unable to re-establish
contact even with his own wife,
and racked by epileptic fits
resulting from diabetes. His spirit
seems broken; he is ready to
admit defeat.
A well-meaning American
publisher immediately drops in,
seeking permission to publish
Andreyev's most recent novel, and
is shocked by the brutal realities
that Westerners can only dimly
imagine. Through the eyesofthis
familiar character, we experience
emphatically the nightmarish
Orwellian atmosphere of
surveillance and threats that
pervades Andreyev's daily life.
In the second act, Andreyev
begins to emerge from his cocoon
of fear. Angered by a
condescending KGB agent who
seeks to intimidate him, Andreyev

fires off a letter to the Union of
Soviet Writers, denouncing
censorship and tyranny.
Returned Defiance
By the third act his old
defiance has returned completely.
A group ot llow writers try to
pressure him i to withdrawing the
letter, and allowing himself to be
muzzled by the state, but
Andreyev rises in wrath and
indignation, flings security to the
winds, and instructs the publisher
to proceed, although he is almost
certainly incurring another severe
prison sentence.
Despite excellent dialogue and
a commendable performance by
Ed Pliska in the demanding role of
Andreyev, such a swift
transformation from abject terror
to smiling martyrdom is a bit
difficult to swallow. One wishes
that Denker had concentrated
upon the intriguing psychological
conflicts of the first act, rather
than sliding into caricature and
political melodrama in the latter
portion of the play.
The title itself illustrates this
unfortunate priority of
propaganda over artistic
consistency. "Headhunters" is the
name of a play that Andreyev
composed and committed to
memory while incarcerated, and
he takes a moment to explain,
somewhat didactically, the crude
image that inspired him.
African headhunters always
sew up the lips of their victims'
shurnken heads, and Andreyev

speculates that the forces of evil
must figuratively sew up the lips
of a writer before they can
successfully shrink his intellect; he
ruefully adds that they have
sewed up his genitals for good
measure. Needless to say, this
awkward metaphor is an intrusion
on the compelling realism of the
play, especially since Denker
struggles unsuccessfully to
demonstrate thct the
"headhunters" are not only the
state, but cowardly writers as
well.
Tender Loyalty
Why could we not have seen
more of Andreyev's wife, Vera,
whose tender loyalty in the face
of his impotence evoked profound
glimpses into the convolutions of
his tormented mind; And how
could Andreyev so easily shrug off
that episode that he described
with terrifying vividness—deprived
of writing materials (including
toilet paper) by the camp
commandant, half-crazed by
misery, he was reduced to
scratching out sentences in his
own excrement—can you dig that?
It is ironic that Denker's
protagonist nobly sacrifices
himself to the cause of literary
freedom, while Solzhenistyn, his
real-life counterpart, quietly
accepts his limitations. Is this
Denker's subconscious rebuke to
the Nobel Laureate for not
granting him the rights to "The
First Circle"? Or is it simply a
reiteration of the naive American

myth—truth and justice will
triumph over tyranny, because
you can't keep a good man down?
The battle against censorship
and suppression in Russia will be
won through gradual and
painstaking evolution, not
through grandiose heroics.
"Headhunters" is an important
play because it draws attention
and sympathy to Soviet
dissidents, thus discouraging the
state from conveniently silencing
them. But public consciousness
would be better served by telling
it the way it really is.

"The Headhunters" will be
performed at the Burgess Theater
on January 21, 22, 28, and 29.
Admission is $2.00 for students.
For those interested in
participating in any phase of
theatre production, a good
opportunity might be the next
presentation of the Menlo Players
Guild, a pair of satirical one-act
plays entitled "Adaptation" and
"Next". Auditions will be held on

Soviet Writers, denouncing
censorship and tyranny.
Returned Defiance
By the third act his old
defiance has returned completely.
A group ot llow writers try to
pressure him i to withdrawing the
letter, and allowing himself to be
muzzled by the state, but
Andreyev rises in wrath and
indignation, flings security to the
winds, and instructs the publisher
to proceed, although he is almost
certainly incurring another severe
prison sentence.
Despite excellent dialogue and
a commendable performance by
Ed Pliska in the demanding role of
Andreyev, such a swift
transformation from abject terror
to smiling martyrdom is a bit
difficult to swallow. One wishes
that Denker had concentrated
upon the intriguing psychological
conflicts of the first act, rather
than sliding into caricature and
political melodrama in the latter
portion of the play.
The title itself illustrates this
unfortunate priority of
propaganda over artistic
consistency. "Headhunters" is the
name of a play that Andreyev
composed and committed to
memory while incarcerated, and
he takes a moment to explain,
somewhat didactically, the crude
image that inspired him.
African headhunters always
sew up the lips of their victims'
shurnken heads, and Andreyev

speculates that the forces of evil
must figuratively sew up the lips
of a writer before they can
successfully shrink his intellect; he
ruefully adds that they have
sewed up his genitals for good
measure. Needless to say, this
awkward metaphor is an intrusion
on the compelling realism of the
play, especially since Denker
struggles unsuccessfully to
demonstrate thct the
"headhunters" are not only the
state, but cowardly writers as
well.
Tender Loyalty
Why could we not have seen
more of Andreyev's wife, Vera,
whose tender loyalty in the face
of his impotence evoked profound
glimpses into the convolutions of
his tormented mind; And how
could Andreyev so easily shrug off
that episode that he described
with terrifying vividness—deprived
of writing materials (including
toilet paper) by the camp
commandant, half-crazed by
misery, he was reduced to
scratching out sentences in his
own excrement—can you dig that?
It is ironic that Denker's
protagonist nobly sacrifices
himself to the cause of literary
freedom, while Solzhenistyn, his
real-life counterpart, quietly
accepts his limitations. Is this
Denker's subconscious rebuke to
the Nobel Laureate for not
granting him the rights to "The
First Circle"? Or is it simply a
reiteration of the naive American

myth—truth and justice will
triumph over tyranny, because
you can't keep a good man down?
The battle against censorship
and suppression in Russia will be
won through gradual and
painstaking evolution, not
through grandiose heroics.
"Headhunters" is an important
play because it draws attention
and sympathy to Soviet
dissidents, thus discouraging the
state from conveniently silencing
them. But public consciousness
would be better served by telling
it the way it really is.

Nestled in the Civic Center of
Menlo Park, just a stone's throw
from campus, is the Burgess
Theatre, one of the many
community theatres that flourish
in the Bay Area.
The Burgess is the home of the
Menlo Player's Guild, a
long-established group of
enthusiastic amateurs, who are
presently introducing the West
Coast Premier of "The
Headhunters," by Henry Denker.
A drama which is just opening
on Broadway, "The Headhunters"
deals with the persecution of
Soviet writers by the state. Much
attention has been focussed on
the plight of Russian intellectuals
such as Alexander Solzhenistyn,
who was prevented from
accepting his Nobel Prize for
Literature, and the Medvedev
brothers, Roy and Zhores, under
constant harrassment for their
courageous exposes of Stalinist
and post-Stalinist repression.
Denker, a well-known
American playwright, had hoped
to adapt Solzhenistyn's "The First
Circle" to the stage—so the story
goes—but learned that further
recognition could only imperil the
author. Instead, he decided to
dramatize the real and poignant
predicament of Solzhenistyn
himself, and so Headhunters was
born.
Stay In Siberia
The play described the
homecoming of Pavel Andreyev, a
Russian novelist who was falsely
accused of permitting his work to
be published abroad, and received
a seven-year sentence at a Siberian
prison-camp.
He comes stumbling into his
old flat, haunted by bleak and
horrible memories of the camp,
consumed by paranoia and
self-doubt, unable to re-establish
contact even with his own wife,
and racked by epileptic fits
resulting from diabetes. His spirit
seems broken; he is ready to
admit defeat.
A well-meaning American
publisher immediately drops in,
seeking permission to publish
Andreyev's most recent novel, and
is shocked by the brutal realities
that Westerners can only dimly
imagine. Through the eyesofthis
familiar character, we experience
emphatically the nightmarish
Orwellian atmosphere of
surveillance and threats that
pervades Andreyev's daily life.
In the second act, Andreyev
begins to emerge from his cocoon
of fear. Angered by a
condescending KGB agent who
seeks to intimidate him, Andreyev

fires off a letter to the Union of
Soviet Writers, denouncing
censorship and tyranny.

By the third act his old

accepts his limitations. Is this
Denker's subconscious rebuke to
the Nobel Laureate for not
granting him the rights to "The
First Circle"? Or is it simply a
reiteration of the naive American

myth—truth and justice will
triumph over tyranny, because
you can't keep a good man down?
The battle against censorship
and suppression in Russia will be
won through gradual and
painstaking evolution, not
through grandiose heroics.
"Headhunters" is an important
play because it draws attention
and sympathy to Soviet
dissidents, thus discouraging the
state from conveniently silencing
them. But public consciousness
would be better served by telling
it the way it really is.

Nestled in the Civic Center of
Menlo Park, just a stone's throw
from campus, is the Burgess
Theatre, one of the many
community theatres that flourish
in the Bay Area.
The Burgess is the home of the
Menlo Player's Guild, a
long-established group of
enthusiastic amateurs, who are
presently introducing the West
Coast Premier of "The
Headhunters," by Henry Denker.
A drama which is just opening
on Broadway, "The Headhunters"
deals with the persecution of
Soviet writers by the state. Much
attention has been focussed on
the plight of Russian intellectuals
such as Alexander Solzhenistyn,
who was prevented from
accepting his Nobel Prize for
Literature, and the Medvedev
brothers, Roy and Zhores, under
constant harrassment for their
courageous exposes of Stalinist
and post-Stalinist repression.
Denker, a well-known
American playwright, had hoped
to adapt Solzhenistyn's "The First
Circle" to the stage—so the story
goes—but learned that further
recognition could only imperil the
author. Instead, he decided to
dramatize the real and poignant
predicament of Solzhenistyn
himself, and so Headhunters was
born.
Stay In Siberia
The play described the
homecoming of Pavel Andreyev, a
Russian novelist who was falsely
accused of permitting his work to
be published abroad, and received
a seven-year sentence at a Siberian
prison-camp.
He comes stumbling into his
old flat, haunted by bleak and
horrible memories of the camp,
consumed by paranoia and
self-doubt, unable to re-establish
contact even with his own wife,
and racked by epileptic fits
resulting from diabetes. His spirit
seems broken; he is ready to
admit defeat.
A well-meaning American
publisher immediately drops in,
seeking permission to publish
Andreyev's most recent novel, and
is shocked by the brutal realities
that Westerners can only dimly
imagine. Through the eyesofthis
familiar character, we experience
emphatically the nightmarish
Orwellian atmosphere of
surveillance and threats that
pervades Andreyev's daily life.
In the second act, Andreyev
begins to emerge from his cocoon
of fear. Angered by a
condescending KGB agent who
seeks to intimidate him, Andreyev

fires off a letter to the Union of
Soviet Writers, denouncing
censorship and tyranny.
Returned Defiance
By the third act his old
defiance has returned completely.
A group ot llow writers try to
pressure him i to withdrawing the
letter, and allowing himself to be
muzzled by the state, but
Andreyev rises in wrath and
indignation, flings security to the
winds, and instructs the publisher
to proceed, although he is almost
certainly incurring another severe
prison sentence.
Despite excellent dialogue and
a commendable performance by
Ed Pliska in the demanding role of
Andreyev, such a swift
transformation from abject terror
to smiling martyrdom is a bit
difficult to swallow. One wishes
that Denker had concentrated
upon the intriguing psychological
conflicts of the first act, rather
than sliding into caricature and
political melodrama in the latter
portion of the play.
The title itself illustrates this
unfortunate priority of
propaganda over artistic
consistency. "Headhunters" is the
name of a play that Andreyev
composed and committed to
memory while incarcerated, and
he takes a moment to explain,
somewhat didactically, the crude
image that inspired him.
African headhunters always
sew up the lips of their victims'
shurnken heads, and Andreyev

speculates that the forces of evil
must figuratively sew up the lips
of a writer before they can
successfully shrink his intellect; he
ruefully adds that they have
sewed up his genitals for good
measure. Needless to say, this
awkward metaphor is an intrusion
on the compelling realism of the
play, especially since Denker
struggles unsuccessfully to
demonstrate thct the
"headhunters" are not only the
state, but cowardly writers as
well.
Tender Loyalty
Why could we not have seen
more of Andreyev's wife, Vera,
whose tender loyalty in the face
of his impotence evoked profound
glimpses into the convolutions of
his tormented mind; And how
could Andreyev so easily shrug off
that episode that he described
with terrifying vividness—deprived
of writing materials (including
toilet paper) by the camp
commandant, half-crazed by
misery, he was reduced to
scratching out sentences in his
own excrement—can you dig that?
It is ironic that Denker's
protagonist nobly sacrifices
himself to the cause of literary
freedom, while Solzhenistyn, his
real-life counterpart, quietly
accepts his limitations. Is this
Denker's subconscious rebuke to
the Nobel Laureate for not
granting him the rights to "The
First Circle"? Or is it simply a
reiteration of the naive American

myth—truth and justice will
triumph over tyranny, because
you can't keep a good man down?
