Military Cargo Will Move
SAN FRANCISCO - The Pacific Maritime
Association reversed itself yesterday and ordered its
member shippers to begin handling military cargo
immediately at struck West Coast ports, PMA
president Edmund Flynn announced.
The development came as the striking
International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's
Union and shippers agreed to resume negotiations as
soon as possible, Jan. <31 at the latest, and the White
House prepared legislation to force the strikers back
to work.
Flynn told a news conference that the PMA
executive committee took the action after a
telegram had been received from Barry J. Shillito,
Assistant Secretary of Defense.
In a telegram of reply, the PMA said its members
will immediately make ships available for handling
of military cargo.
The International Longshoremen's and
Warehousemen's Union on Monday resumed at 24
West Coast ports a 100-day strike which had been
halted Oct. 6 by a Taft-Hartley Act injunction.
The PMA president told Shillito: "During the
100-day strike which ended Oct. 5, income to
longshoremen from handling military cargo acted as
a substitute for strike benefits normally made
available through union sources.
Flynn said he has received a letter from the ILWU

president, Harry Bridges, saying the union was
willing to resume negotiations by Jan. 31 or earlier
if feasible.
Kaufman Indicted
NEW YORK — Ronald Kaufman, the Stanford
alumnus sought by the FPI for allegedly planting
bombs in several bank vaults, has been indicted by
federal grand juries in three cities.
Kaufman, who is at large, was indicted yesterday
in New York City and San Francisco. On Tuesday
the Chicago grand jury of Judge Julius Hoffman of
Chicago Seven fame returned an indictment.
Federal authorities allege that Kaufman, 33,
placed delayed-explosion bombs in nine bank vaults,
three in each city. The bombs were removed by
police earlier this month after several newspapers
received letters stating their location. One bomb, in
the Bank of America in San Francisco, exploded last
September.
Davis Trial Delayed Again
SAN JOSE — The murder-kidnap trial of Angela
Davis, scheduled to start Jan. 31, will be delayed at
least two weeks to hear defense motions to move
the trial and to pay defense costs with public funds,
attorneys said yesterday.

Prosecutor Albert Harris Jr. said Superior Court
Judge Richard E. Arnason would begin hearing
arguments on the motions Jan. 31. Harris estimated
this would take two weeks.
Howard Moore Jr., chief counsel for Miss Davis,
estimated arguments on the motions could take up
to a month.
Last week, Miss Davis' attorneys filed several
motions, including another request to move her trial
from San Jose. It had been moved here from San
Rafael, scene of the shootout.
Arnason also will hear a defense motion that the
public make "reasonable" appropriations to pay
defense costs. Moore claimed the defense fund is
"on the brink" of being exhausted with expenses
running between $5,000 and $15,000 a month.
Campaign Reforms Approved
WASHINGTON — The most sweeping
campaign-spending reform bill in a half-century
cleared Congress yesterday to climax a bipartisan
effort to curb campaign costs and close financial
loopholes.
By 334 to 19, the House passed a
Senate-approved compromise writing new rules for
political-finances reporting and restricting a
presidential candidate's radio-TV ad budget to $8.4
million this fall.
