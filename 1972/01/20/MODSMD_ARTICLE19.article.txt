# Super Bowl Here?
## Coach Announcement Expected Soon 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
President Richard Lyman is
expected to offer Stanford's head
football coaching position this
morning to a candidate decided upon
yesterday by a University search
committee.
The search committee held a
lengthy meeting yesterday afternoon,
and .Jack Christiansen, one of the three
assistant coaches reportedly under
consideration for the job, told the
Daily last night that Acting Athletic
Director Bob Young had indicated to
him yesterday morning that a decision
would be reached at that meeting.
Assistant coach Mike White is still
considered to be the leading candidate
for the job vacated when John Ralston
left to become head coach of the
National Football League's Denver
Broncos two weeks ago.
The feeling that White will be
offered the job was heightened
yesterday when it was learned that
both Christiansen and Bob Gambold,
the other assistant coach under
consideration, are leaving today for
Denver.
Christiansen said last night that
some sort of announcement will be
made in Denver today regarding his
and Cambold's future plans. Cambold
had said earlier that the two plan to
spend a week in Denver "reviewing
films and working on the draft." The
pro football draft will be held on
February 1 and 2.
Cal Offer
White talked to the Daily yesterday
morning following a meeting he had
with Young and said, "I have
definitely been offered the head
coaching position at California and I
could have taken it four, five or six
days ago. (As of yesterday noon) I
haven't been offered the job here. I
have every reason to believe I will be
offered the job, but it hasn't happened
as of yet."
"I will weigh all the facts and come
to a decision probably by Friday
night. I think that both Stanford and
California are great institutions and I
would enjoy working for either one of
them." White has also of course been
offered a job as an assistant coach
under Ralston at Denver.

Up in Berkeley, Cal remained silent
yesterday regarding the situation and
it is believed that although track coach
Dave Maggard is still considered to
have the best chance at the vacant
athletic directors position, since
Maggard reportedly wants White to be
his head football coach, no
announcement will be made until
White reaches a decision on his future
coaching plans.
Oregon's Frei Resigns
In another development yesterday,
Jerry Frei, head coach at the
University of Oregon resigned his post,
and immediately rumors began that
Frei was a possible candidate for both
the Cal and Stanford vacancies. Frei's
resignation was alleged to have been
triggered by disputes he had with
Oregon's Ail-American running back
Bobby Moore who closed out his
collegiate career last fall.
While most everyone was involved
with following these coaching
maneuvers, a story in Monday's San
Francisco Examiner reported that
Stanford Stadium was being
considered as a possible site for the
1973 Super Bowl.
Melvin Dursiag, a syndicated
columnist from the Los Angeles
Herald-Examiner reported that
Stanford was being considered because
"a segment of National Football
League owners .. . are interested in
taking the game back to California at
the place that will create no problems
with television."
In explaining the television factor
Dursiag said, "In blacking out the San
Francisco area for television, the NFL
would be creating a smaller problem
with NBC, which will do the game
next year, than it would by moving
into Los Angeles and blacking out
there," because, "Los Angeles is the
second-largest TV market in the land,
representing more than 8 percent of
the nation's audience."
Young Interested
Yesterday an athletic department
source said that earlier in the week,
Young had expressed interest in
hosting the game. Young said "We
haven't been contacted by the NFL,"
but he admitted that the University is

currently pressing for an amendment
to a state law which would eliminate a
tax problem which is the only
hindrance to use of the stadium by the
pros.
Cassius Kirk, Stanford's
Vice-President for Business and
Finance and a staff counsel said
yesterday that earlier he had drafted a
proposed bill which would amend a
section of the state education code so
that "not greater than six athletic
events not sponsored by the University
could be held in Stanford Stadium."
Kirk said he didn't exactly know the
present status of the bill, but added "I
gather it is before the legislature."
According to Kirk, as the law
presently stands, Stanford might lose
their state real property tax exemption

if they let professional teams use the
stadium and his amendment would
eliminate this problem. He claimed
there was no federal tax problem in
letting the stadium be used by
professional teams. He added that the
amendment would involve only the
stadium and would not apply to Frost
Ampitheater where problems had
arisen in the past with usage of the
facility by off-campus organizations.
There is a definite possibility that
Stanford Stadium could host next
year's Super Bowl. But for now, the
major athletic question on the mind of
Stanford administrators concerns who
will be leading Stanford's football
team onto the field in that stadium
next September.

California are great institutions and I
would enjoy working for either one of
them." White has also of course been
offered a job as an assistant coach
under Ralston at Denver.

Up in Berkeley, Cal remained silent
yesterday regarding the situation and
it is believed that although track coach
Dave Maggard is still considered to
have the best chance at the vacant
athletic directors position, since
Maggard reportedly wants White to be
his head football coach, no
announcement will be made until
White reaches a decision on his future
coaching plans.
Oregon's Frei Resigns
In another development yesterday,
Jerry Frei, head coach at the
University of Oregon resigned his post,
and immediately rumors began that
Frei was a possible candidate for both
the Cal and Stanford vacancies. Frei's
resignation was alleged to have been
triggered by disputes he had with
Oregon's Ail-American running back
Bobby Moore who closed out his
collegiate career last fall.
While most everyone was involved
with following these coaching
maneuvers, a story in Monday's San
Francisco Examiner reported that
Stanford Stadium was being
considered as a possible site for the
1973 Super Bowl.
Melvin Dursiag, a syndicated
columnist from the Los Angeles
Herald-Examiner reported that
Stanford was being considered because
"a segment of National Football
League owners .. . are interested in
taking the game back to California at
the place that will create no problems
with television."
In explaining the television factor
Dursiag said, "In blacking out the San
Francisco area for television, the NFL
would be creating a smaller problem
with NBC, which will do the game
next year, than it would by moving
into Los Angeles and blacking out
there," because, "Los Angeles is the
second-largest TV market in the land,
representing more than 8 percent of
the nation's audience."
Young Interested
Yesterday an athletic department
source said that earlier in the week,
Young had expressed interest in
hosting the game. Young said "We
haven't been contacted by the NFL,"
but he admitted that the University is

currently pressing for an amendment
to a state law which would eliminate a
tax problem which is the only
hindrance to use of the stadium by the
pros.
Cassius Kirk, Stanford's
Vice-President for Business and
Finance and a staff counsel said
yesterday that earlier he had drafted a
proposed bill which would amend a
section of the state education code so
that "not greater than six athletic
events not sponsored by the University
could be held in Stanford Stadium."
Kirk said he didn't exactly know the
present status of the bill, but added "I
gather it is before the legislature."
According to Kirk, as the law
presently stands, Stanford might lose
their state real property tax exemption

if they let professional teams use the
stadium and his amendment would
eliminate this problem. He claimed
there was no federal tax problem in
letting the stadium be used by
professional teams. He added that the
amendment would involve only the
stadium and would not apply to Frost
Ampitheater where problems had
arisen in the past with usage of the
facility by off-campus organizations.
There is a definite possibility that
Stanford Stadium could host next
year's Super Bowl. But for now, the
major athletic question on the mind of
Stanford administrators concerns who
will be leading Stanford's football
team onto the field in that stadium
next September.
President Richard Lyman is
expected to offer Stanford's head
football coaching position this
morning to a candidate decided upon
yesterday by a University search
committee.
The search committee held a
lengthy meeting yesterday afternoon,
and .Jack Christiansen, one of the three
assistant coaches reportedly under
consideration for the job, told the
Daily last night that Acting Athletic
Director Bob Young had indicated to
him yesterday morning that a decision
would be reached at that meeting.
Assistant coach Mike White is still
considered to be the leading candidate
for the job vacated when John Ralston
left to become head coach of the
National Football League's Denver
Broncos two weeks ago.
The feeling that White will be
offered the job was heightened
yesterday when it was learned that
both Christiansen and Bob Gambold,
the other assistant coach under
consideration, are leaving today for
Denver.
Christiansen said last night that
some sort of announcement will be
made in Denver today regarding his
and Cambold's future plans. Cambold
had said earlier that the two plan to
spend a week in Denver "reviewing
films and working on the draft." The
pro football draft will be held on
February 1 and 2.
Cal Offer
White talked to the Daily yesterday
morning following a meeting he had
with Young and said, "I have
definitely been offered the head
coaching position at California and I
could have taken it four, five or six
days ago. (As of yesterday noon) I
haven't been offered the job here. I
have every reason to believe I will be
offered the job, but it hasn't happened
as of yet."
"I will weigh all the facts and come
to a decision probably by Friday
night. I think that both Stanford and
California are great institutions and I

them." White has also of course been

second-largest TV market in the land,
representing more than 8 percent of
the nation's audience."
Young Interested
Yesterday an athletic department
source said that earlier in the week,
Young had expressed interest in
hosting the game. Young said "We
haven't been contacted by the NFL,"
but he admitted that the University is

currently pressing for an amendment
to a state law which would eliminate a
tax problem which is the only
hindrance to use of the stadium by the
pros.
Cassius Kirk, Stanford's
Vice-President for Business and
Finance and a staff counsel said
yesterday that earlier he had drafted a
proposed bill which would amend a
section of the state education code so
that "not greater than six athletic
events not sponsored by the University
could be held in Stanford Stadium."
Kirk said he didn't exactly know the
present status of the bill, but added "I
gather it is before the legislature."
According to Kirk, as the law
presently stands, Stanford might lose
their state real property tax exemption

if they let professional teams use the
stadium and his amendment would
eliminate this problem. He claimed
there was no federal tax problem in
letting the stadium be used by
professional teams. He added that the
amendment would involve only the
stadium and would not apply to Frost
Ampitheater where problems had
arisen in the past with usage of the
facility by off-campus organizations.
There is a definite possibility that
Stanford Stadium could host next
year's Super Bowl. But for now, the
major athletic question on the mind of
Stanford administrators concerns who
will be leading Stanford's football
team onto the field in that stadium
next September.
President Richard Lyman is
expected to offer Stanford's head
football coaching position this
morning to a candidate decided upon
yesterday by a University search
committee.
The search committee held a
lengthy meeting yesterday afternoon,
and .Jack Christiansen, one of the three
assistant coaches reportedly under
consideration for the job, told the
Daily last night that Acting Athletic
Director Bob Young had indicated to
him yesterday morning that a decision
would be reached at that meeting.
Assistant coach Mike White is still
considered to be the leading candidate
for the job vacated when John Ralston
left to become head coach of the
National Football League's Denver
Broncos two weeks ago.
The feeling that White will be
offered the job was heightened
yesterday when it was learned that
both Christiansen and Bob Gambold,
the other assistant coach under
consideration, are leaving today for
Denver.
Christiansen said last night that
some sort of announcement will be
made in Denver today regarding his
and Cambold's future plans. Cambold
had said earlier that the two plan to
spend a week in Denver "reviewing
films and working on the draft." The
pro football draft will be held on
February 1 and 2.
Cal Offer
White talked to the Daily yesterday
morning following a meeting he had
with Young and said, "I have
definitely been offered the head
coaching position at California and I
could have taken it four, five or six
days ago. (As of yesterday noon) I
haven't been offered the job here. I
have every reason to believe I will be
offered the job, but it hasn't happened
as of yet."
"I will weigh all the facts and come
to a decision probably by Friday
night. I think that both Stanford and
California are great institutions and I
would enjoy working for either one of
them." White has also of course been
offered a job as an assistant coach
under Ralston at Denver.

Up in Berkeley, Cal remained silent
yesterday regarding the situation and
it is believed that although track coach
Dave Maggard is still considered to
have the best chance at the vacant
athletic directors position, since
Maggard reportedly wants White to be
his head football coach, no
announcement will be made until
White reaches a decision on his future
coaching plans.
Oregon's Frei Resigns
In another development yesterday,
Jerry Frei, head coach at the
University of Oregon resigned his post,
and immediately rumors began that
Frei was a possible candidate for both
the Cal and Stanford vacancies. Frei's
resignation was alleged to have been
triggered by disputes he had with
Oregon's Ail-American running back
Bobby Moore who closed out his
collegiate career last fall.
While most everyone was involved
with following these coaching
maneuvers, a story in Monday's San
Francisco Examiner reported that
Stanford Stadium was being
considered as a possible site for the
1973 Super Bowl.
Melvin Dursiag, a syndicated
columnist from the Los Angeles
Herald-Examiner reported that
Stanford was being considered because
"a segment of National Football
League owners .. . are interested in
taking the game back to California at
the place that will create no problems
with television."
In explaining the television factor
Dursiag said, "In blacking out the San
Francisco area for television, the NFL
would be creating a smaller problem
with NBC, which will do the game
next year, than it would by moving
into Los Angeles and blacking out
there," because, "Los Angeles is the
second-largest TV market in the land,
representing more than 8 percent of
the nation's audience."
