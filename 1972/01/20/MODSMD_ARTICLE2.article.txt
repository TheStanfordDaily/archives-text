# Seeks Honorable Release
## Sailor Finds Sanctuary In PA Church 
### DAN BRENNER 
Tonight Navy Fireman Richard
Larson remains in sanctuary at the
First Presbyterian Church of Palo
Alto, 12 days after he was to have
shipped out from San Francisco Bay
on the carrier USS Midway.
Larson, 19, from Rexford, Mich, is
seeking an honorable discharge from
the Navy as a conscietious objector.
He has been joined here by his parents.

He received a visit by the ship's
chaplain on Tuesday who, Larson said,
"had judged my case before I could
bring it into the court."
"He said that I was insincere for
taking sanctuary. I don't know why he
said it. He didn't even know anything
about me."
Last night Larson sent a letter to
the ship's captain, William H. Harris,
Jr., explaining why he has sought

asylum in the church. So far he has
not heard of any Navy plans to
apprehend him.
An unusually long time has elapsed
in this case. According to Rev.
Anthony Meyer, S.J., associate
clergyman at St. Ann's Catholic
Church and coordinator at the
sanctuary, the usual length for the
Navy to act in such cases is 24 hours.
Dinner From Baez
Although tired from his nights of
camping out in the pews of the
church, Larson spoke with vigor as he
munched on a Chinese dinner that
Joan Baez had brought him. Seated in
the church office, he matter-of-factlv
explained why he left the Midway.
"I joined the Navy for very
personal reasons. I guess I wanted to
see the world; I was suckered into
that.
"I just picked the Navy—it was the
first thing that popped into my mind.
I didn't feel any special commitment
to the United States or anything."
Larson enlisted after graduating from
high school in 1970.
He spoke of a deep and intense
motivation, coming from his family,
that had shaped his thoughts during
his tour of Vietnam last year.
Moral Obligation
"Our family wasn't very verbal, but
we still had been brought up on a few
things. One of those was how
important' life was. We weren't very
religious but we knew we had a moral
obligation. It took this war and the
Navy to bring this feeling out."
So far Larson has heard from Cong.
John Conyers (D-Mich.) who has
indicated he intends to push for an
honorable discharge. Conyers
indicated that he might take this
matter up with the ship's captain or
the White House.
He has also received legal guidance
from some community members.

Larson criticized the Navy's lack of
counseling. "You're supposed to go to
the chaplains for advice. But the
chaplains don't help you at all. They
are a complete waste in the Navy.
They don't care."
Larson has been joined for the last
three nights by community people,
sometimes numbering up to 300, in
the church pews. The altar has been
turned into an improvised buffet line
with home-baked casseroles or bowls
of carrot salad highlighting the table.
The only wine to be found was Pink
Chablis, used to honor the spirit of
communality that had grown in the
church.
Joan Baez sat in one corner of the
church, talking to young people about
ways of living. The church organist
piped serene, glowing music. Most of
the people — from many parts of the
community — chatted.
Concert Tonight
Baez will sing tonight at the church,
the second concert she has given since
Larson took sanctuary.
The First Presbyterian is one of 14
churches in eight California cities that
are offering sanctuary to any military
person whose conscience, the churches
have said in a statement, "will not
permit him to participate in military
action."
The churches believe that by
throwing an entire congregation's
support behind attempts such as
Larson's they can demonstrate
widespread opposition to the war.
But although Larson has the visible
support and friendship of the members
of the Palo Alto sanctuary, the degree
of his loneliness is evidenced in the
letter he sent to his captain.
At the end of the letter he wrote,
"I know I will probably be punished
for what I have done. But this is a
chance I must take because it is the
strongest way I know to express what
I believe."

three nights by community people,
sometimes numbering up to 300, in
the church pews. The altar has been
turned into an improvised buffet line
with home-baked casseroles or bowls
of carrot salad highlighting the table.
The only wine to be found was Pink
Chablis, used to honor the spirit of
communality that had grown in the
church.
Joan Baez sat in one corner of the
church, talking to young people about
ways of living. The church organist
piped serene, glowing music. Most of
the people — from many parts of the
community — chatted.
Concert Tonight
Baez will sing tonight at the church,
the second concert she has given since
Larson took sanctuary.
The First Presbyterian is one of 14
churches in eight California cities that
are offering sanctuary to any military
person whose conscience, the churches
have said in a statement, "will not
permit him to participate in military
action."
The churches believe that by
throwing an entire congregation's
support behind attempts such as
Larson's they can demonstrate
widespread opposition to the war.
But although Larson has the visible
support and friendship of the members
of the Palo Alto sanctuary, the degree
of his loneliness is evidenced in the
letter he sent to his captain.
At the end of the letter he wrote,
"I know I will probably be punished
for what I have done. But this is a
chance I must take because it is the
strongest way I know to express what
I believe."

SEE THE WORLD—Navy Eireman Richard has taken sanctuary in the
Eirst Presbyterian Church of Palo Alto after refusing to ship out with his boat 12
days ago. I .arson is seeking an honorable discharge from the Navy.
Tonight Navy Fireman Richard
Larson remains in sanctuary at the
First Presbyterian Church of Palo
Alto, 12 days after he was to have
shipped out from San Francisco Bay
on the carrier USS Midway.
Larson, 19, from Rexford, Mich, is
seeking an honorable discharge from
the Navy as a conscietious objector.
He has been joined here by his parents.

He received a visit by the ship's
chaplain on Tuesday who, Larson said,
"had judged my case before I could
bring it into the court."
"He said that I was insincere for
taking sanctuary. I don't know why he
said it. He didn't even know anything
about me."
Last night Larson sent a letter to
the ship's captain, William H. Harris,
Jr., explaining why he has sought

asylum in the church. So far he has
not heard of any Navy plans to
apprehend him.
An unusually long time has elapsed
in this case. According to Rev.
Anthony Meyer, S.J., associate
clergyman at St. Ann's Catholic
Church and coordinator at the
sanctuary, the usual length for the
Navy to act in such cases is 24 hours.
Dinner From Baez
Although tired from his nights of
camping out in the pews of the
church, Larson spoke with vigor as he
munched on a Chinese dinner that
Joan Baez had brought him. Seated in
the church office, he matter-of-factlv
explained why he left the Midway.
"I joined the Navy for very
personal reasons. I guess I wanted to
see the world; I was suckered into
that.
"I just picked the Navy—it was the
first thing that popped into my mind.
I didn't feel any special commitment
to the United States or anything."
Larson enlisted after graduating from
high school in 1970.
He spoke of a deep and intense
motivation, coming from his family,
that had shaped his thoughts during
his tour of Vietnam last year.
Moral Obligation
"Our family wasn't very verbal, but
we still had been brought up on a few
things. One of those was how
important' life was. We weren't very
religious but we knew we had a moral
obligation. It took this war and the
Navy to bring this feeling out."
So far Larson has heard from Cong.
John Conyers (D-Mich.) who has
indicated he intends to push for an
honorable discharge. Conyers
indicated that he might take this
matter up with the ship's captain or
the White House.
He has also received legal guidance
from some community members.

Larson criticized the Navy's lack of
counseling. "You're supposed to go to
the chaplains for advice. But the
chaplains don't help you at all. They
are a complete waste in the Navy.
They don't care."

An unusually long time has elapsed
in this case. According to Rev.
Anthony Meyer, S.J., associate
clergyman at St. Ann's Catholic
Church and coordinator at the
sanctuary, the usual length for the
Navy to act in such cases is 24 hours.
Dinner From Baez
Although tired from his nights of
camping out in the pews of the
church, Larson spoke with vigor as he
munched on a Chinese dinner that
Joan Baez had brought him. Seated in
the church office, he matter-of-factlv
explained why he left the Midway.
"I joined the Navy for very
personal reasons. I guess I wanted to
see the world; I was suckered into
that.
"I just picked the Navy—it was the
first thing that popped into my mind.
I didn't feel any special commitment
to the United States or anything."
Larson enlisted after graduating from
high school in 1970.
He spoke of a deep and intense
motivation, coming from his family,
that had shaped his thoughts during
his tour of Vietnam last year.
Moral Obligation
"Our family wasn't very verbal, but
we still had been brought up on a few
things. One of those was how
important' life was. We weren't very
religious but we knew we had a moral
obligation. It took this war and the
Navy to bring this feeling out."
So far Larson has heard from Cong.
John Conyers (D-Mich.) who has
indicated he intends to push for an
honorable discharge. Conyers
indicated that he might take this
matter up with the ship's captain or
the White House.
He has also received legal guidance
from some community members.

Larson criticized the Navy's lack of
counseling. "You're supposed to go to
the chaplains for advice. But the
chaplains don't help you at all. They
are a complete waste in the Navy.
They don't care."
Larson has been joined for the last
three nights by community people,
sometimes numbering up to 300, in
the church pews. The altar has been
turned into an improvised buffet line
with home-baked casseroles or bowls
of carrot salad highlighting the table.
The only wine to be found was Pink
Chablis, used to honor the spirit of
communality that had grown in the
church.
Joan Baez sat in one corner of the
church, talking to young people about
ways of living. The church organist
piped serene, glowing music. Most of
the people — from many parts of the
community — chatted.
Concert Tonight
Baez will sing tonight at the church,
the second concert she has given since
Larson took sanctuary.
The First Presbyterian is one of 14
churches in eight California cities that
are offering sanctuary to any military
person whose conscience, the churches
have said in a statement, "will not
permit him to participate in military
action."
The churches believe that by
throwing an entire congregation's
support behind attempts such as
Larson's they can demonstrate
widespread opposition to the war.
But although Larson has the visible
support and friendship of the members
of the Palo Alto sanctuary, the degree
of his loneliness is evidenced in the
letter he sent to his captain.
At the end of the letter he wrote,
"I know I will probably be punished
for what I have done. But this is a
chance I must take because it is the
strongest way I know to express what
I believe."
