# President's Office Entered, Marine Recruitment Delayed
## 
### DAVID THIEMANN 
More than 100 people entered and
occupied Building 10 which houses
the offices of President Richard
Lyman and Provost William Miller,
among others, for an hour and a half
yesterday afternoon.
The protesters moved to Building
10 after occupying the Placement
Center, where Marine Corps recruiters
were scheduled to appear, for about
20 minutes.
A large group of demonstrators
moved from a dispersing Faculty
Political Action Group rally at White
Plaza to the Placement building, where
they inquired after the missing Marine
recruiters.
Two or three of the demonstrators
had scheduled interviews with the
recruiters for the afternoon, but were
told by the Placement staff to
re-schedule the meetings for this
morning.
Dave Josephson and John
Schwartz, Assistant to the President,
discussed what Josephson termed the
"discrimination" the recruiters were
guilty of and the "disruption" they
caused.

After agreeing to leave the
Placement Center, the demonstrators
ran, shrieking and yelling, to Building
10. Three of the protesters entered the
building at about 1:30 p.m., 15
minutes before the others arrived, and
opened locked doors so that the group
could enter.
President Lyman was in
Washington, D.C. for a meeting of the
executive committee of the American
Association of Universities on Tuesday
and Wednesday, and would not return
to his office until Thursday morning,
officials informed the crowd.
Demonstrators then began to
question several University officials,
including Vice-Provost Robert
Rosenzweig, Director of Police
Services Marvin Herrington, University
News Service Director Robert Beyers,
and Schwartz.
As they entered the building, about
50 demonstrators moved upstairs to
the second floor of the building, where
they met Rosenzweig, and found a
large Xerox machine and a refrigerator
stocked with cases of Coke, Fresca,
and V-8 juice, which they distributed
to the crowd outside.
Downstairs, another 50 people,
including Professor of Genetics
Leonard Herzenberg, gathered around
Electrical Engineering professor
William Shockley, who had an
appointment with Schwartz to discuss
a disruption staged by third world
students Tuesday in one of Shockley's
classes.
Shockley defended his controversial
theories on race and intelligence,
asserting that "it is unfortunate that
the least able are perhaps having the
most children."
Most demonstrators left the
building at about 3:00 p.m. to attend
Bruce Franklin's lecture at the
"Literature and Revolution" class at
Columbae House.
Schwartz said after the incident

that he did not expect to prosecute
any of the demonstrators for
violations of University regulations.
Rosenzweig spoke harshly of the
demonstrators, stating: "I don't think
the occupation has any purpose at all,
aside from to cause as much trouble in
as many places as possible."
At his class Franklin released copies
of the four-page brief he submitted to
the Board of Trustees. In the brief
(which appears on page three),
Franklin states unequivocally that "I
did not do the things I was charged
with. Even if I had. not one would
violate either any law or any Stanford
rule, written or unwritten."
At the meeting afterwards, the
steering committee of the Stanford
Rehabilitation Movement (an ad hoc
committee including members of the
Faculty Political Action Group,
Venceremos, and the Young Crows)
decided—in accord with the decision
of the Venceremos central
committee—that Aaron Manganiello,
instead of Franklin, would address a
Friday night "convocation" in
Memorial Church.
The contract with the church
provides that Franklin must not be
present, but Venceremos member Don
Lee and Franklin observed that
Manganiello, too, would be violating
the provisions of a University
injunction barring him from campus.
Franklin said, however, that he will
come to speak on campus at some
time in the near future, in defiance of
the court injunction.
Elaine Wong and Wallace Scott
Burke, student members of the
Trustees' Academic Affairs committee,
yesterday submitted a seven-page brief
on the Franklin case solicited earlier
by the Trustees.
Former ASSU President David
Harris is also scheduled to address
Friday evening's Church Convocation.
