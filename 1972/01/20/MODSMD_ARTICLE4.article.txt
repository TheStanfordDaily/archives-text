# 45 Faculty Support Franklin At Rally
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
A rally protesting the imminent
dismissal of Professor H. Bruce
Franklin drew some 500
demonstrators and 45 faculty
members to White Plaza yesterday
afternoon.
The rally preceeded the occupation
of the Placement Center and President
Lyman's office.
Among the professors who spoke or
sent statements in support of Franklin
were noted population biologist I)r.
Paul Ehrlich, Nobel Laureate Linus
Pauling, Education Professor Martin
Carnoy, and former Chairman of the
Department of Medicine Halsted
Hoi man.
Fhrlich refused to label President
Lyman and the Faculty Advisory
Board "fascists," but said that now is
the time that the University "must do
more to include," rather than exclude,
viewpoints that it might consider
"loathesome," and added that "there
arc other members of our community
that I find far more loathesome than
Bruce Franklin."
v. .air Drake, head of tl

Program in African and Afro-American
Studies, asserted that the University
should be a "free marketplace of
ideas," but said that "you can't have a
marketplace if you don't have a
variety of views."
Disclaimers
Many professors qualified their
support of Franklin with the
disclaimer that "I don't necessarily
agree with him on most issues or with
his tactics."
Seldom mentioned was the fact
that the United States Marine Corps
was recruiting a few hundred feet
away in the Placement Center.
The first to actually broach the
subject was Raymond Giraud,
Chairman of the Department of
French and Italian, who accused the
Corps of being "the perpetrators
of. . . the most savage and brutal
genocidal violence" in history.
Assistant Professor Kd Greenberg of
the Political Science Department
alluded to a "subtle system" employed
by the faculty to stifle dissent.
Greenberg's contract is not being
renewed for next year.
Risks
Many junior professors implied that
they were risking their own positions
to come out publicly in favor of
Franklin. However, Ann Snow, a
lecturer in the German Department,
told the audience that "I'm only on a
one-year contract, so I can say I don't
give a shit about getting tenure."
Hal Kahn, associate professor of
history, advocated the peaceful
occupancy of the Placement Center to
protest the Marine recruitment.
Halstead Holman complained of
"deceit and stealth" on the part of the
University, and likened Franklin to Dr.
Daniel Ellsberg.
Rosenzweig Knew?
Doug Wilde brought up a charge
that would later figure during the
occupation of President Lyman's
office: that Vice Provost Robert M.
Rosenzweig knew, in advance of last
year's computation center
demonstration, that the disputed

program had been dropped, and
deliberately withheld the information
to "trap Bruce." Rosenzweig later
denied the charge in a confrontation
with protesters in Building 10, the
President's office.
The only speaker who expressed
support of the Advisory Board's
decision was Law Professor Jack
Friedenthal, former head of the
embattled Stanford Judicial Council,
who declared that he had "read all the
evidence" and that he would "firmly
support" the decision to oust
Franklin. His comments were met with
a few jeers from the by then dwindling
audience.
The rally was organized by the
Faculty Political Action Group. Before
the rally, students from Beta Chi,
Columbae House, and Jordan House
presented a satirical play concering a
"Dr. Lymanstein" with his
"rehabilitation machine," and the
"Hunchback of Hoover Tower." The
tower itself included one side marked
"liberal-side" and one marked
"geno-cide."

program had been dropped, and
deliberately withheld the information
to "trap Bruce." Rosenzweig later
denied the charge in a confrontation
with protesters in Building 10, the
President's office.
The only speaker who expressed
support of the Advisory Board's
decision was Law Professor Jack
Friedenthal, former head of the
embattled Stanford Judicial Council,
who declared that he had "read all the
evidence" and that he would "firmly
support" the decision to oust
Franklin. His comments were met with
a few jeers from the by then dwindling
audience.
The rally was organized by the
Faculty Political Action Group. Before
the rally, students from Beta Chi,
Columbae House, and Jordan House
presented a satirical play concering a
"Dr. Lymanstein" with his
"rehabilitation machine," and the
"Hunchback of Hoover Tower." The
tower itself included one side marked
"liberal-side" and one marked
"geno-cide."
A rally protesting the imminent
dismissal of Professor H. Bruce
Franklin drew some 500
demonstrators and 45 faculty
members to White Plaza yesterday
afternoon.
The rally preceeded the occupation
of the Placement Center and President
Lyman's office.
Among the professors who spoke or
sent statements in support of Franklin
were noted population biologist I)r.
Paul Ehrlich, Nobel Laureate Linus
Pauling, Education Professor Martin
Carnoy, and former Chairman of the
Department of Medicine Halsted
Hoi man.
Fhrlich refused to label President
Lyman and the Faculty Advisory
Board "fascists," but said that now is
the time that the University "must do
more to include," rather than exclude,
viewpoints that it might consider
"loathesome," and added that "there
arc other members of our community
that I find far more loathesome than
Bruce Franklin."
v. .air Drake, head of tl

Program in African and Afro-American
Studies, asserted that the University
should be a "free marketplace of
ideas," but said that "you can't have a
marketplace if you don't have a
variety of views."
Disclaimers
Many professors qualified their
support of Franklin with the
disclaimer that "I don't necessarily
agree with him on most issues or with
his tactics."
Seldom mentioned was the fact
that the United States Marine Corps
was recruiting a few hundred feet
away in the Placement Center.
The first to actually broach the
subject was Raymond Giraud,
Chairman of the Department of
French and Italian, who accused the
Corps of being "the perpetrators
of. . . the most savage and brutal
genocidal violence" in history.
Assistant Professor Kd Greenberg of
the Political Science Department
alluded to a "subtle system" employed
by the faculty to stifle dissent.
Greenberg's contract is not being
renewed for next year.
Risks
Many junior professors implied that
they were risking their own positions
to come out publicly in favor of
Franklin. However, Ann Snow, a
lecturer in the German Department,
told the audience that "I'm only on a
one-year contract, so I can say I don't
give a shit about getting tenure."
Hal Kahn, associate professor of
history, advocated the peaceful
occupancy of the Placement Center to
protest the Marine recruitment.
Halstead Holman complained of
"deceit and stealth" on the part of the
University, and likened Franklin to Dr.
Daniel Ellsberg.
Rosenzweig Knew?
Doug Wilde brought up a charge
that would later figure during the
occupation of President Lyman's
office: that Vice Provost Robert M.
Rosenzweig knew, in advance of last
year's computation center
demonstration, that the disputed

program had been dropped, and
deliberately withheld the information
to "trap Bruce." Rosenzweig later
denied the charge in a confrontation
