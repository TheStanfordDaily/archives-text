# harsh retaliation applied
## Unjust Standards, Sanctions Reflect Political Bias 
###

Second of Two Parts
Though the section of the
decision that deals with
"Standards" precedes the
"Findings of Facts," it is useful to
consider it after the "Findings"
because the meaning and
implications of its confused prose
become somewhat clearer with
application.
The standard applied to the
Lodge incident, though never
explicitly stated as such, seems to
bo "disruptive conduct" (33) or
"action destructive to the
fundamental values of the
University" (29-30)— that is, acts
defined as "illegal" presumably by
the Policy on Campus Disruptions
or by "common understandings of
appropriate faculty conduct"
(18).
The two speeches at the heart
of the second and fourth charges
are alleged to be "advocacy that is
directed to inciting or producing
i nmine nt lawless action, and
likely to produce such action"
(9); sometimes "lawless" is
replaced by "illegal 1 ' (e.g., top of
19,61).
The third charge "deals with
conduct which miglit unjustifiably

increase the risk of injury to
others" (9). It is not clear in this
last case if "conduct" refers only
to Franklin's shouts, as it does on
page 81, and therefore is another
instance of "speech," or if it
refers to other kinds of
"behavior" as well 89); it is also
not clear if increasing the risk of
injury to others is considered per
se illegal and, if so, by what
stalndard, or if it is illegal because
the means of increasing the
risk—inciting others to disobey a
police order—is advocacy of
imminent lawless action.
What Law?
About all these "standards"
one question arises immediately:
what is the "law" that defines
"lawless" or "illegal" action? At
first the "law referred to is the
"law"of the campus" (20); later it
is extended to include "state or
local laws" as well (116); finally,
"the standards for the judgment
of what speech or conduct can
properly be regulated"—
presumably the standards laid
down by the "law of the
campus" "may or may not
correspond to those in effect in
particular external legal systems"
(iii of Summary).
We should probably assume
that the last definition, though in
the summary is the one intended
(it is that kind of assumption that
is forced on us by the prose of
this document). The implications
of that defintion become clearer
when we explore the definitions
of "campus law": the Policy on
Campus Disruptions, other
"university regulations," and
something called "common-law
understandings of professorial
responsibility" (20,116).
That last, crucial phrase refers
to "a web of largely unwritten
rules as tough and living as the
British Constitution" (14) which
"trace their source to slowly

evolving tradition rather than to
abrupt acts of legislative
intervention...." (13). One
immediately thinks of unwritten
rules against plagiarism or the
failure to teach one's classes and
one affirms the validity of those
rules.
But the unwritten rules do not
stop there. In connection with the
Lodge incident, those rules,
according to the Board, forbid
heckling a political speaker on
campus if his forum is like one of
the pseudo-academic "exercises"
sponsored by the Hoover
Institution (34, 36, 26).
Here the unwritten rule does
not correspond to those in
external legal standards: the board
belittles the relevant case, In re
Kay, which permits heckling, on
the grounds that the University
should not "reach out to the
external legal system for those
standards used to protect
political-picnic oratory" (29)
(presumably that should read "to
protect responses to
political-picnic oratory").
Do we really believe that the
politeness of the club room,
rather than the practice of the
British House of Commons or the
dictates of our own legal system,
should determine the "unwritten
rule" on responses to political
speakers? Surely such a rule is
"overbroad" (9).
Again, with respect to the third
charge, is the alleged, though not
proven, incitement of others to
question the dispersal order
contrary to some unwritten
campus law even though it is not
contrary to external legal
standards? Surely such a rule is
both vague and overbroad (9-10).
In the Spring of 1970 many
professors gave speeches like the
speech which is the subject of the
second charge, and yet no
proceedings to dismiss them were
initiated. Was the standard,
perhaps implcit in the Policy,
vague because of its not having
been previously enforced?
"Unwritten Rules"
Near the end of the Board's
attempt to counter arguments
about vagueness and overbreadth
there occurs a surprising
statement: "What we have called
the web of unwritten rules of
faculty conduct is not clear. . .."
(15). The next paragraph retracts
with the assertion that they are

"adequately clear," but the
assertion is empty after the truth
has been admitted. With respect
to "extra-curricular" activities,
the "unwritten rules" which form
part of the "law of the campus"
are certainly not clear and
probably do not exist.
These questions about the
"law" applied in the case lead to
the conclusion that, despite the
claim of the Board (8), the
constitutional guarantees of due
process and free speech probably
have not prevailed in this case and
the Board has in fact accepted the
University administration's view
"that disciplinary proceedings at a
private institution are not
necessarily subject to
Constitutional protections" (7).
Vagueness and overbreadth are
not the only important defects.
Local tradition cannot be
substituted for "state or local
laws" in defining "illegal
conduct" when free specch and
advocacy are the issues.
If the Faculty Club should
make the "law" that ties are
required for diners, and if
someone should incite a group of
faculty members without ties to
the "imminent lawless act" of
entering the dining room to eat,
prosecution for incitement would
surely violate constitutional
guarantees of free speech.
The same constitutional
guarantees have been violated by
the prosecution of Franklin for
incitement to break these newly
discovered "campus laws" on
heckling and challenging police

dispersal orders. Furthermore,
though I am not a lawyer, I find it
impossible to believe that a
criminal court would have found
Franklin guilty of the fourth
charge when the violent acts
which are alleged to have followed
his speech bore no relationship to
the non-violent acts he suggested
in the speech.
Again, how could a criminal
court have found him guilty of
the third and fourth charges if the
5 to 2 split of the Board were
translated into a hung jury? As
the Board implies, the University's
policies for protecting speech and
due process must be even stricter
than "the minimum standards set
by the Constitution" (8). In this
case not even those minimum
standards were met.
Eloquent Writing
Finally, the Board's decision
and recommendation of sanctions
strikes me as a gigantic non
sequitur. There is much eloquent
writing about Franklin's
perception of reality and hence
his conduct differing from those
of the majority; about limiting
punishment of action, "and most
especially of speech," to serious
infringements of the rights of
others in the university (135);
about the willingness to apply
mitigating circumstances
"asymmetrically" in favor of
Franklin (135); and about the
purposes of various sanctions.
Then the majority decides to
recommend dismissal.
It is an astonishing portion of
the document, the disproportion

between its two parts mirroring
the disproportion between
Franklin's alleged "crimes" and
the punishment meted out. After
a token scuffle with rehabilitation
and deterrence, retaliation
prevails.
Assume, for the sake of
argument, that Franklin is guilty
of the second charge—that his
speech incited the disruption of
the Computation Center. It is the
only charge unanimously
sustained and the only charge of
which conviction is an even
remote possibility.
Does this community really
think that dismissal is an
appropriate punishment for such a
speech? To Franklin's knowledge
at the time of his speech,
GAMUT-H (39, 82), the SRI
war-game simulating the invasion
of a country like North Vietnam,
was still being run at the Stanford
Computation Center. However
subtle in form, GAMUT-H was an
act of great potential violence to
people.
It was also, as Provost William
Miller admitted in an Academic
Senate meeting at the time, a
project that did violence to the
spirit if not the letter of the
university's policy on secret
research because its results could
not be sent out of the country in
their unpublished state.
(Note, by the way, the
administration's hedging of the
truth here on p. 82: "no violation
of University policy .. . not
classified . . . available for
publication.") I-'or allowing

GAMUT-H to be run, the
Computation Center deserved a
strong attack. We may not agree
with Franklin's mode of attack,
but surely it does not warrant his
dismissal.
Apparently, when Stanford
University's complicity in the war
is the target of demonstration, a
special standard—dictating harsh
retaliation—is applied by the
administration. And the majority
of the faculty assents. After all, as
the Board admits, "the
perceptions of reality held by the,
Board are generally more shared
with those of the administration
than with those of Professor
Franklin" (135). Injustice due to
political bias—that is, I think, the
only judgment that can emerge
from a "fair and careful" reading
of the Advisory Board's decision.
Let no one doubt, despite
President Lyman's assurances, the
intimidating effect of this decision
on free political speech and action
here and at other colleges and
universities. The Board has itself
issued the challenge: ". . . persons
considering borderline conduct
must locate the border" (136).
They must, that is, locate the
borderlines of freedom for
themselves and at their own peril.
Stanford University will
hereafter indeed "be less a true
university" (148), not only
because of the loss of Professor
Franklin, but also because of the
unjust way in which he has been
dismissed.
