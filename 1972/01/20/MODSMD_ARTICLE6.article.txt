# a 						different context
## Why Microwave Research

I would like to make some
comments on Mr. Albers' article
of January 13th, concerning a
contract for which I am the
co-responsible investigator. These
comments are intended to place
the whole matter in perhaps a
different context than Mr. Albers'
interpretation would indicate.
It may be that the description
of the genesis of this specific
contract may also shed light on the

whole structure of DoD
sponsorship of scientific research
in universities. Basically, this
contract arose as a result of our
own initiative in trying to
investigate some unusual ideas on
data processing which originated
in our own laboratory and in
order to do further work on these
ideas, we approached the Signal
Corps Laboratory for support.
To put this program in
perspective, I might point out that
over the past ten years or so, a
number of people in our
laboratory had been doing
research on the use of very high
frequency acoustic waves in
crystals as a means of doing high
speed processing of high density
data in a small volume. These
investigations have involved
invention, research on a great
variety of techniques in material
technology, and theoretical
analysis.
The research has obvious
applications to communications,
TV transmission, computers,
navigational systems, radar and
anything else where large amounts
of digital or analog data are
generated and have to be
processed. I may say, without
immodesty perhaps, since most of
this effort represents work by
others in the laboratory than
myself, that we are probably the
outstanding laboratory in this
field in the world, which includes
extensive activities in laboratories
in the U.K., France, USSR and
U.S.

In large part, our work has
been responsible for developing an
entirely new field with broad
applications as listed above. Such
applications, of course, do include
possible DoD applications, since
the DoD is interested and makes
extensive use of computers,
communication systems, and
other electronic systems. Because
of their interest, DoD has
furnished support for these
efforts, not only in the contract
quoted by Mr. Albers, but in
others which have been quoted
elsewhere.
As I have stated, several years
ago we made some important new
advances in methods for
increasing both the quantity and
duration of data storage and in
certain data processing
techniques, essentially
mathematical operations, which
could be performed on the data
while in storage (convolution,
auto-correlation, Fourier
transforms, etc.). These concepts
could have important applications
in all of the areas
communications, etc.-listed above,
and we were anxious to investigate
these ideas further to find the
range of applicability, possible
limitations, etc.
We, therefore, approached the
Signal Corps Laboratory at
Monmouth for funding. We sent
them an elaborate proposal, which
described the effort we wanted to
undertake and included a
description of certain ranges of
performance we would try to

achieve as measures of the value
and limitations of our ideas. The
work would involve building
certain experimental devices in
our laboratory to test these ideas.
It was agreed that any such
experimental vehicles would be
delivered to the Signal Corps
Laboratory at Monmouth at the
end of the contract in order for
them to familiarize themselves
with this technology which is
unique and not available
anywhere else.
The devices that we are
delivering are not prototypes.
They are not intended for specific
systems. Our delivery to the
Research Laboratory at
Monmouth is part of a continuing
exchange of information that we
carry on with laboratories
throughout the world. We have
sent crystals and devices to
research laboratories in California,
on the East Coast, and Europe. In
turn, we have received crystals
from other laboratories without
charge, which have aided us in our
work.
The ideas we are exploring are
not narrowly limited to military
applications. They are interesting,
they are unique with us, and we
do not feel that the research is
contaminated merely because
DoD is interested in supporting a
particular research program.
It is to be regretted that other
government agencies—Health,
Education and Welfare,
Department of Transportation,
National Science Foundation—
which might also have some
| long-term applications of our
ideas are less well-structured at
| the moment to be aware of such
i applications to their needs and to
i finance research in such areas in
| universities.
My colleagues and I make our
own individual decisions on what
: research we are willing to do. We
j choose our own research interests.
Political and moral judgments do
j enter into our choice, but we
certainly do not blacklist an
agency because it happens to be
I an active agent of a U.S. political
decision for which we all
personally have some
: responsibility, including our
• elected representatives.
