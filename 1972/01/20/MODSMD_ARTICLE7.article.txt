## DoD Research Violates Honor Code

Stanford University
Official Examination Book
"HONORABLE CONDUCT in
academic work is the spirit of
conduct in this University.
In recognition of and in the spirit
of the Honor Code, I certify that I
will neither receive nor give
unpermitted aid on this
examination and that I will
report, to the best of my ability,
all Honor Code violations
observed by me."
Each time students face an
examination in the University
they are confronted by the
formality of affixing their
signatures to the Stanford Honor
Code. Often students are pressed
for time, and they scribble their
names as fast as possible, flip the
cover in the same motion, and
start writing the test. What about
that Honor Code—does it mean
anything?
The Honor Code is not just an
empty phrase; it is used as a very
real means of prosecuting students
who cheat during examinations.
According to the Office of the
Special Assistant to the President,
John Schwartz, seven cases have
been filed of charges brought
against students for violations of
the Honor Code. Of these, five
students were placed on probation
of from one to three quarters, and
one student was suspended for a
quarter.
Moral Standard Imposed
Obviously, the University
imposes particular moral
standards on students: one should
not cheat on examinations, or else
he may face prosecution before
the SJC, as seven students did last
year. Given the Honor Code, the
Administration's defense of
military recruitment seems
specious. The question is not
whether moral standards should
be imposed on individuals by this
institution; the question is, which
moral standards are being
promoted by the policies of
Stanford University?
With existing policies, the
University implies it is not right to
copy off your neighbor in an
exam, but it is part of the
approved scheme of things to be
recruited on the Stanford campus
by the military for a job killing
Asians.
So, what is the purpose of the
Honor Code? Perhaps the code is

intended to develop our moral
virtue; perhaps it is deemed
appropriate because this is
supposed to be a community of
scholars in which students should
be trusted.
Pedagogical Pretension
Or perhaps the Honor Code is
simply another bit of bullshit,
hypocrisy, another example of
pedagogical pretension. It is
remarkable that a moralistic
platitude can be used to shame
students into compliance. The
Honor Code virtually demands
that one sign or else stand
self-insinuated a "cheater".
Indeed, the Honor Code is a
convenient admonition, for it
facilitates internalized control
over large numbers of students in
crowded testing situations. The
code is effective in this way only
because so many Stanford
students have had similar past
experience with "honor" in
test-taking.
So, the Honor Code serves as a
sophisticated reminder of the
stern schoolteacher who would
suddenly claim the paper of a
"cheater" and dramatically rip it
up before the class. Obviously,
our obeisance to the Honor Code
is the culmination of a long
socialization process. Signing the
code, we continue to legitimize
certain assumptions about
education at Stanford.
The Honor Code reinforces us
to think in terms of competition
between isolated intellects. The
code conveys that cooperation,
receiving or giving aid, is wrong.
We are also to report to the
best of our ability all Honor Code
violations observed.
So a climate of alienation and
suspicion is created, in which each
mind is out for itself. Knowledge
becomes a commodity to be
jealously guarded—whatever a
person knows is hoarded and used
to outscore others. It is forgotten
that each person is utterly
dependent on the collective
wisdom of humanity, from the
wisdom of those who printed his
books to the wisdom of those
who manufactured his pencils.
Trials of Elimination
The Honor Code is unnecessary
when examinations are based on
good faith, being products of
consultation between students
and teachers as to what is

important in a class, what should
be learned, and how. Sadly
enough, many tests at Stanford
are not cooperative learning
experiences, but trials of
elimination. Often the object is
for students to guess what the
professor thought most
important, and to try to prepare
for obscure or tricky questions.
Such preparation may be entirely
aside from that knowledge
students find interesting or
valuable. In this scheme of
alienated coercion, an "Honor
Code" is a cruel fraud.
The Honor Code allows
Stanford University to assume the
virtuous position, before which
we stand, our morality to be
scrutinized. And we who have
learned to be guilt-stricken and
intimated before institutional
authority, we forget to ask
whether or not "HONORABLE
CONDUCT" is in fact "the spirit
of conduct in this University."
Much of the business of
academic work conducted here is
blatantly dishonorable. What is
honorable about military research
that will soon be used to kill
children? What is honorable about
scheduling the first day of
registration on the holiest day of
the Jewish faith? What is
honorable about a quota system
of admissions that discriminates
against women? What is honorable
about the fact that blacks make
up 8% of Stanford admissions,
while constituting 12% of the
population, and 20% of the
casualties in Vietnam? Despite all
pretense, there is little honor to
be found in the arrogance of our
administrators, in the dismissal of

Bruce Franlin, in the hypertension
of finals week, and in a travesty
like the Honor Code.
Report Violations
In the spirit of the Honor
Code, we are to report all
violations observed. To this end a
petition has been started,
addressed to John Schwartz,
special assistant to the president
who brings charges in Honor Code
disputes. Assuming that this
administrator will not be receptive
to this petition, copies will also be
sent to the University
Ombudswoman, and the
Academic Council of the faculty:
In recognition and support of the
proposition that ".Honorable
Conduct in academic work is the
spirit of conduct in this
University," we, the undersigned,
Stanford students, wish to report
Department of Defense business
on this campus in violation of the
Stanford Honor Code.
Other students are encouraged
to report the violations they
consider most obnoxious.
On that next examination, I
suggest that instead of another
hasty signature students substitute
a statement such as "Knowledge is
the common property of all
mankind," or "Military research is
a violation that must be dealt with
before the Honor Code can begin
to mean anything." Anyone who
signs his name to the Honor Code
and yet does not report "to the
best of their ability all Honor
Code violations observed by
them," is simply being
irresponsible.
