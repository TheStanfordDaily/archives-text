Editor, THE DAILY:
Friday Bill Evers' column
"News in Review" chose a few
arguments from Judith Thomson's
"A Defense of Abortion."
Thomson compared a pregnant
woman's right to kill the fetus to
a hypothetical situation in which
a man's life depended on sharing
the kidneys of another person for
nine months.
Thomson argued that any
person has a right to refuse to let
this man use his kidneys. This is
saying that any person can choose
not to be inconvenienced even
when a man dies as a direct result
of that choice.
If someone were being beaten
to death on the street and you
had the means to prevent that
from happening, you have the
right to do nothing and let that
person die.
I think it's time Bill Evers
re-examined his values. When
personal convenience is valued
above another person's life, adult
or fetus, no wonder there is a
Vietnam or Attica.
Rick Longinotti,
Sophomore at Chi Psi
Rick Longinotti's argument
leads in the end to a justification
for slavery. For, what he is saying
is that someone has a right to
force you to live for other
persons. This is, of course, the
ethical rationale which is given for
military conscription.
I would contend, first, that it is
quite possible that a woman
trying to lead a good, decent life
might desire to remove a fetus.
Secondly, I would contend
that for whatever reason, good or
bad, that a woman chose to

remove the fetus, no one has a
right to prevent her from doing
so. The fetus is, after all,
undesired tissue contained within
her body. Denying a woman
control over her own body is an
aggressive crime against her
person.
Bill Evers,

Editor, THE DAILY:
I am distressed at the
disruption of Professor Shockley's
class on semi-conductor theory
yesterday morning. What
happened is a clear interference
with the freedom of a member of
our faculty to disseminate
knowledge on this campus.
Without that freedom the
University is dead.
Moreover, the use of
strong-arm methods to steal Dr.
Shockley's property represents an
act of hoodlumism which is
simply intolerable. Clearly, the
unpopularity of Dr. Shockley's
views on genetic theory can serve
as no excuse for what transpired.
This incident is neither the first
nor, I fear, the last of mob-type
transgression on the rights of
members of the campus
community. Witness the forced
ejection of Bob Beyers from
Memorial Church during the later
stages of the Ellsberg meeting on
January 7, widely advertised as an
open campus event.
In spite of the best efforts of
University authorities, I suppose it
is difficult to eradicate such
happenings completely on a
campus as large and open as
Stanford. However, their
frequency may be minimized if
the whole campus community

treats these occurrences with less
indifference than it has in the
past.
Daniel Bershader,

Editor, THE DAILY:
In your article "University
News Offices Occupied" (Daily of
18 January) you quoted part of a
letter to Dr. Panofsky which had
been signed by 338 SLAC
employees. Unfortunately, and
probably for lack of adequate
space, you cut off the second and
third paragraphs from the letter
causing your article to end with
the main feeling of the letter
unstated.
Appended is a copy of the
letter which I hope you will be
able to publish in full. At last
count over 450 SLAC employees
had added their signatures:
"It is seldom in our lifetime
that we are called upon, as you
were in the recent Franklin case,
to make a decision which might
be not only unpopular with an
active and very vocal group, but
might also bring upon ourselves
and our families the threat of
physical violence.
"Additionally most of us will
never have to consider such a
complicated case which involves a
number of our basic liberties and
freedoms.
"We, the undersigned workers at
SLAC, believe that you have given
every consideration to all aspects
of this case and have arrived at a
judgement which is equitable
without destroying our traditional
freedoms."

I am distressed at the
disruption of Professor Shockley's
class on semi-conductor theory
yesterday morning. What
happened is a clear interference
with the freedom of a member of
our faculty to disseminate
knowledge on this campus.
Without that freedom the
University is dead.
Moreover, the use of
strong-arm methods to steal Dr.
Shockley's property represents an
act of hoodlumism which is
simply intolerable. Clearly, the
unpopularity of Dr. Shockley's
views on genetic theory can serve
as no excuse for what transpired.
This incident is neither the first
nor, I fear, the last of mob-type
transgression on the rights of
members of the campus
community. Witness the forced
ejection of Bob Beyers from
Memorial Church during the later
stages of the Ellsberg meeting on
January 7, widely advertised as an
open campus event.
In spite of the best efforts of
University authorities, I suppose it
is difficult to eradicate such
happenings completely on a
campus as large and open as
Stanford. However, their
frequency may be minimized if
the whole campus community

treats these occurrences with less
indifference than it has in the
past.

In your article "University
News Offices Occupied" (Daily of
18 January) you quoted part of a
letter to Dr. Panofsky which had
been signed by 338 SLAC
employees. Unfortunately, and
probably for lack of adequate
space, you cut off the second and
third paragraphs from the letter
causing your article to end with
the main feeling of the letter
unstated.
Appended is a copy of the
letter which I hope you will be
able to publish in full. At last
count over 450 SLAC employees
had added their signatures:
"It is seldom in our lifetime
that we are called upon, as you
were in the recent Franklin case,
to make a decision which might
be not only unpopular with an
active and very vocal group, but
might also bring upon ourselves
and our families the threat of
physical violence.
"Additionally most of us will
never have to consider such a
complicated case which involves a
number of our basic liberties and
freedoms.
"We, the undersigned workers at
SLAC, believe that you have given
every consideration to all aspects
of this case and have arrived at a
judgement which is equitable
without destroying our traditional
freedoms."
Robert W. Bradford,

Friday Bill Evers' column
"News in Review" chose a few
arguments from Judith Thomson's
"A Defense of Abortion."
Thomson compared a pregnant
woman's right to kill the fetus to
a hypothetical situation in which
a man's life depended on sharing
the kidneys of another person for
nine months.
Thomson argued that any
person has a right to refuse to let
this man use his kidneys. This is
saying that any person can choose
not to be inconvenienced even
when a man dies as a direct result
of that choice.
If someone were being beaten
to death on the street and you
had the means to prevent that
from happening, you have the
right to do nothing and let that
person die.
I think it's time Bill Evers
re-examined his values. When
personal convenience is valued
above another person's life, adult
or fetus, no wonder there is a
Vietnam or Attica.
Rick Longinotti,
Sophomore at Chi Psi
Rick Longinotti's argument
leads in the end to a justification
for slavery. For, what he is saying
is that someone has a right to
force you to live for other
persons. This is, of course, the
ethical rationale which is given for
military conscription.
I would contend, first, that it is
quite possible that a woman
trying to lead a good, decent life
might desire to remove a fetus.
Secondly, I would contend
that for whatever reason, good or
bad, that a woman chose to

remove the fetus, no one has a
right to prevent her from doing
so. The fetus is, after all,
undesired tissue contained within
her body. Denying a woman
control over her own body is an
